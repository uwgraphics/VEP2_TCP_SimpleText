TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, GEORGE, BY GODS PROVIDENCE, ARCHbishop of
CANTERBVRY his Grace, Primate of all England, and Metropolitan, and one of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council, I. D. wishes all happiness,
temporal and eternal.
SEeing there is nothing (most Reverend) so highly to be esteemed, or so much
to be desired of all Christians, as the glory of God in the salvation of his
people, as being the principal and chief end of our creation and being, of
our preservation and continuing in the world; therefore it behooves all men,
who would not fail of their end, and so live in vain, in their several
callings wherein God has placed them, to have this always in their eye, as
their chief mark, and to propound it as the principal scope of all their
actions, using all good means whereby it may be furthered and advanced. As
Princes and Magistrates, by enacting good laws, and seeing them duly
executed, making their own lives (as it were) rules of that obedience which
they require of the people, and lively examples and patterns for their
imitation. Ministers, by leading those which are committed unto their charge,
in the ways of truth and godliness, not only by their preaching and writing,
instruction, admonition, persuasion and exhortation, but also by practizing
those duties which they teach others, and shining before them in the light of a
godly life. Finally, the people, by yielding their cheerful obedience to the
godly laws of Governors, and by embracing the found and profitable doctrine,
and imitating the Christian and religious examples of their godly Teachers. The
consideration whereof has moved me to employ my talent both by preaching and
writing, for the advancing (as much as in me lies) the glory of my great Lord
and Master, and the good and salvation of my fellow servants; or rather, to
cast my mite into the Churches treasury, hoping that he will accept it, though
not in its own value and worth, yet because I have desired to be faithful in a
little, and willing in my penury to offer unto him all that I have. And
studying how I might best employ my pains and endeavors for the advancing of
the former ends, I could find no one part of Divinity more profitable, in
these times, for me to spend my strength upon, then that which consists more
in experience and practice, then in theory and speculation; and more
principally tends to the sanctification of the heart, then the informing of
the judgment and the increasing of knowledge; and to the stirring up of all to
the practice of that they know in the duties of a godly life, and in bringing
forth the fruits of faith in new obedience; then to fit them for discourse.
For as in the civil state we need not so much to have new laws enacted, as
to have the old executed, and observed; nor to have these cleared to the
understanding by the learned in that Science, as to have them obeyed and
practiced by all estates and conditions; so in the Church, knowledge so far
exceeds our obedience (not that which is saving and experimental, which is
never severed from use and practice, but that which is curious and vselesse)
that we more need all good helps to work that we have into our hearts, for
the inflaming of them with fervent zeal and true devotion, then to have a
greater measure of this light infused into our heads, which being destitute of
feeling and practice, in which the power of godliness chiefly consists,
does (as the Apostle speaks) but puff us up, and makes us rather 1. Cor. 8.
1.
more learned, then more godly and religious. Again, seeing the Lord, above
all other parts, requires the heart, as being the first mouer and chief agent
in this little world of man, which ordreth and disposes of all the rest, me
thinks, his Ambassadors cannot better spend their pains, then in wooing and
winning, espousing and uniting them unto him in those inviolable and
inseparable bonds of fervent love and devout zeal; and in persuading and
enabling men to approve the sincerity of these holy affections, in their godly
lives and virtuous actions Finally, these discourses of practical Divinity
tending to stir up devotion, and to excite men to the duties of a godly life,
are most fit and necessary for these times. First, because the world is already
full of such books as do fully handle the Doctrine of Divinity in all the
points and parts of it, and also of learned controversies wherein the truth is
sufficiently defended, and all errors, which do oppose it, refuted and
refelled. Secondly, because our long peace and prosperity have much cooled and
quenched the fervor of our zeal and devotion, and have caused us (contenting
our selves with some cold formalities, and slight profession) to neglect the
sincere practice of those substantial duties which are required to a godly and
Christian life. Lastly, because in these declining times, wherein many men
waxing weary of the Truth, and being glutted with long feeding on the
spiritual Manna, do desire to return to the fleshpots of Egypt, and for
carnal respects do fearfully relapse into Popery and superstition; there is
no means more effectual to stay them from apostacy and backsliding, then
that first, by catechizing they should be soundly grounded in the knowledge of
the Truth which we profess (In which regard we have just cause to praise God
for our Sovereigns care in reviving this holy exercise, which has long
languished in many places through careless neglect) And secondly, that being
by this means enlightened in the knowledge of the Truth, they have it by
powerful persuasions wrought into their hearts and affections, that they may
also practice it in their lives and conuersations, without which, all other
means will be ineffectual, either for the inlightning of the mind with
saving knowledge, or the inclining of the will to embrace it, and to continue
firm and resolute against errors and heresies. For whereas sound and saving
knowledge of the truth, and the constant acknowledgement and profession of it,
are the gifts of God, which none can attain unto, but those upon whom he
pleases to bestow them; he vouchsafes these graces unto those alone who love
his Truth, and bring forth the fruits of it in their holy practice. To these
only this rich talent of truth is entrusted; to these it is doubled and
redoubled, who make best use of it for the glory of him that gave it, by
causing it to shine in their lives and conuersations. As we see in the example
of David, who became wiser and of greater understanding Psalm. 119. 100.
then the Ancient, yea then his Teachers, because he kept Gods Precepts. Upon
these alone is bestowed the gift of discerning between the saving Truth, and
the traditions and precepts of men; according to that of our Savior, If John
7. 17.
any man will do his will, he shall know the doctrine, whether it be of God,
etc. As for them, who hide this rich talent without use, the Lord will deprive
them of it, and give them over to their own ignorance and errors. And those
who allow a place for it only in their heads, and will afford it no room in
their hearts, by loving, embracing and practizing it, it is just with God to
send them strong delusions, that they should believe 2. These. 2. 10, 11
lies, that they all might be damned who believe not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness. As we see in the example of many in these times,
who having been enlightened with the knowledge of true Religion, have become a
prey to Priests and Jesuits; and (though otherwise of good understanding) have
been seduced and persuaded to believe the most sottish absurdities in all
Popery, of which there can be given no other reason then this, that they did
not love the light of Gods Truth, nor were careful to walk by it in an holy
conversation, but resolved to continue in such profane and wicked courses, even
against knowledge and conscience, as would suffer them to find no shadow of
peace and comfort in the Doctrine of the Truth; and therefore they have sought
it in popish dispensations, and absolutions, which allow them, after that they
have, with the harlot in the Proverbs, wiped their mouths, to return again
to their former uncleanness; in which regard I doubt not to affirm, that
whereas error and ignorance do make one Papist; loose licenciousnesse and
resolved profaneness do make many. Finally, whereas those who have the
knowledge of the truth only seated in their brains, and have no feeling of the
power and efficacy of it, for the sanctifying of their hearts, and the
reforming of their lives, are easily seduced with cunning sophistry, when as
they are puzzled with subtle arguments which they are not able to answer: they
contrariwise who have found and felt in themselves the efficacy of truth, for
the changing of their minds and hearts, and the renewing of their lives, will
never forsake it, but will embrace and profess it unto the death, and
cheerfully seal it with their blood, when for want of learuing and Art* they
are not able to defend it against the subtle objections and cunning sophistry
of their adversaries, As we see in the example of many of the holy Martyrs, who
being unlettered, have maintained the truth in the impregnable fort of their
hearts, when their heads have been too weak to preserve it from violence. In
which regard it were much to be desired, that all Ministers, who have the
charge of souls committed unto them, would be careful, after that by
catechizing they have thoroughly grounded their people in the sound knowledge of
the truth, in the next place, to work it into their hearts and affections, and
to persuade them unto an holy practice of it in their lives and conuersations,
both by shining before them in their light of doctrine, and also of an holy
example; by the one, showing unto them the way of truth, and by the other,
leading them in it like good guides, as it were by the hand. At which marks as
I have aimed in the whole course of my Ministry, both by preaching and
writing; so especially in these my present labors; the which I have made bold
to dedicate unto your Grace; that they may remain unto the world, as a
testimony how much I love and honor you, as being in these perilous times, a
chief pillar under his Majesty, to uphold the sincere truth of Religion,
against all errors, novelties and heresies which otherwise were likely to grow
too fast amongst us; and also a principal Patron of sound and solid
preaching, which you are ready upon all occasions to countenance both with your
authority, and also by your painful practice; as on the other side, to decry,
as much as in you lies, that vain or vanity of such Preachers, which only
seek to preach themselves, by making ostentation of their wit, learning and
reading, without any care to speak unto the capacity of the people, as though
their maine end were rather to make the excellency of their gifts known, for
their own praise or preferment, then to communicate them unto others, to the
Glory of God that gave them, or the good of their fellow servants, for whose
sake they were entrusted unto them. The Lord long continue your Grace to be a
singular instrument of his glory, by maintaining the purity and practice of his
true Religion in his Church, to the joy of all that wi^h well to Sion, and the
increasing of your own glory and happiness in the life to come.

Your Graces humbly devoted in all Christian duty and service, JOHN DOWNHAM.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
IT is the duty (Christian Reader) of all who desire to approve themselves
faithful subjects and servants to our great Lord and Sovereign, that they
consecrate themselves wholly unto his service, not only in the spiritual
Warfare, by fighting his battles, even unto the death, against the many and
mighty enemies of his glory and our salvation; but also in the time of peace,
by doing his will, and performing all holy duties of his service, which in his
Word he requires of them. And therefore as I have endeavored heretofore
(according to the measure of grace received) to prepare and fit all those who
vouchsafe to peruse my poor labors, that they may perform the duties of
valiant Soldiers, in my Books of the Christian Warfare: so perceiving that
those my pains have much above their worth found good acceptance with all
those that fear God; I have now also been encouraged to undertake the other,
and not only to describe the duties of a godly life, in which we ought to serve
our Lord and Master, but also to show the means whereby we may be enabled
hereunto, and how we may remove the impediments which otherwise might hinder us
from entering into, or proceeding in the ways of godliness. The which my
labors, if they prove as profitable to those that read them, as they have
been painful unto me in framing and composing them, I shall think my self
abundantly recompensed, and much more rejoice when I see the harvest of my
hopes, then ever I had cause to sigh and groan, through weariness in my
laborious seed-time. Of which, though I should fail (as I hope I shall not)
yet, as it is said of Virtue, that it always brings a reward with it, so may
I truly say of these my labors; out of which, so much profit, comfort, and
contentment have accrewed unto my self, that I should have no just cause to
repent for the scantnesse of my reward, although no other fruit should spring
from them. But if I be not deceived (as we are apt to be no less blinded in
judging of our spiritual and mental, then of our natural and corporal
births) these my present labors will prove no less profitable unto all that
peruse them, then any of the former. Yea, if my affection corrupting my
judgment, does not cause me to look upon them (like Fathers, upon the children
of their old age) with an ouer-partiall eye, they are in some respects to be
preferred before any of the other, both because the subject on which they
entreat, has the privilege of excellency and necessity, as being the maine
duties of Christianity, which are to be performed thorowout the whole course of
our lives; and also because they generally concern all sorts of men, who
think themselves bound to do God any service, or to carry themselves so, as
that their works and ways may be accepted of him. If any man shall think that
I have described the duties of a godly life with more strictness, and in
greater perfection, then any can attain unto in this state of imperfection,
and so have required more of others, then I can any ways be able to perform
my self; let him know, that the work must be fitted to the rule, and not the
rule to the work, and that this must be straight and perfect, although by
reason of the crookedness of the matter or stuff, no worke-man is able to
frame it so, but that it will in many places decline and swerve from it. And
though the mark of perfection be so small, and so far out of our reach, that
none in this life can hit it; yet must it be set before us, and we must strive
to shoot at it, as near as w(...); seeing they are more likely to have the
prize of the best game, who aim at it, then those who look another way. For
my self, none can accuse me of so many and great imperfections in my course
and practice of these duties, as I am ready to charge my self within the court
of mine own conscience; and yet if I would not belie the grace of God in me, I
must profess, that I do labor to perform that my self which I propound
unto others; and though I cannot attain to the goal of perfection, as I have
here described it out of Gods Word, yet bewayling my stiffenesse and lamenesse
in running the Race, I endeavor and press (in some measure) toward Phil. 3.
13, 14.
the mark, for the price of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ; and no
more then this do I require of others. Now, because we cannot grow in grace
and godliness, without the assistance of Gods Spirit, and this cannot be had,
unless we sue and seek for it; and because also godliness in a great part
consists in pouring forth our souls before God in humble and hearty,
frequent and fervent prayers, therefore lest any thing which is necessary,
should be wanting to this Treatise, I have in the end of it set down diverse
forms, which may serve either for the use of weak Christians, who cannot fit
themselves with better, or for some direction to guide them in composing or
conceiving others, according to their own particular occasions. If any man
think them ouer-long and tedious, to him, I confess, they are so, (though
there is scarce two amongst them that may not be treatably uttered in a quarter
of an hour) and therefore I would not torture his devotion, by persuading him
to rack and stretch it above its due length and strength; but rather I would
advise, if he meet not with shorter Prayers, which better please him, that he
divide both the Confessions and Petitions, with some mark of a Pen, so as he
may use one half at one time, and the rest at another. And so (Christian
Reader) I leave thee to the Lord, and his good blessing upon all thy studies
and endeavors, only requesting these two things at thine hands; First, that as
I have labored much in giving thee directions for the leading of a Christian
life; so thou will also strive with all thine endeavor, to walk in this way
revealed unto thee. And secondly, that if thou reap any fruit of my pains (as
I doubt not thou will, if thou read to profit by them, constantly unto the
end, and not here and there, by fits and snatches) thou will be pleased to
afford me the benefit of thy Prayers, that together with thy self, I may
continue and hold out unto the end, in the profession and practice of all
Christian and holy duties; until having finished our course with joy, we do
both of us receive the Crown of righteousness, which God of his free grace
has laid up for us, and for all those who love his appearing.

it want and poverty. 850 4 That though many godly men are poor, that
godliness is no cause of their poverty. 851
CAP. XVII.
Their objection answered, who allege, that their poverty presses them to
such continual labor, that they have no leisure for the duties of a godly
life. 852 Sect. 1. That Gods Commandments bind to obedience poor and rich.
852 2 That poverty hinders not Gods graces in us, but rather furthers them.
853 3 That the more poor we are, the more earnest we should be in Gods
service. 854 4 That if being poor, we carefully serve God, we may securely
cast our selves upon his gracious providence, and expect him to be our reward.
854 5 That the objection of poverty is but a frivolous and false excuse. 856
CAP. XVIII.
Their objection answered, who pretend, that their multitude of worldly
employments will allow them no leisure for religious duties. 857 Sect. 1. That
earthly blessings are no hindrances to godliness, but the immoderate love of
them. 857 2 That we must not undertake all employments which the world and the
flesh will press upon us. 859 3 That no business is of like moment, as by
serving God, to save our souls. 859 4 That they who neglect the duties of Gods
service, cannot expect good success to their labors. 860 5 That the duties of
our particular callings, must give place to the general calling of
Christianity. 861 6 That we have time sufficient for religious and civil
duties, if it be wisely husbanded. 863 7 That none are exempted by God, from
the duties of his service, under pretense of any business. 860
CAP. XIX.
Their objection answered, who excuse their neglect of religious duties, under
pretense that the times and places wherein they live, are full of corruption.
866 Sect. 1. That the corruption of the times is a strong tentation to withdraw
us from godliness. 866 2 That though it be hard to flesh and blood to live
righteously in corrupt times, yet it is possible, yea easy to the regenerate.
868 3 A note of difference between true zeal and devotion, and that which is
false and hypocritical. 869

and answered. 870 Sect. 1. That it is not enough to live harmelesly, unless
we also perform religious duties. 870 2 That it is not sufficient to serve
God in some things, and at some times. 871 3 Their objection answered, who

The end of the Table.
THE FIRST BOOK OF A GODLY LIFE, CONTAINING THE GROUNDS AND fundamental
graces whereby it is supported.
CAP. I.
Containing the Preface to the following Treatise, which shows the
excellency, profit and necessity of the subject matter therein handled.

. Sect. 1 That the end of every thing is to be preferred before the means
which are destinated unto it.
ACcording to the rules of reason, we esteem the end of al things to be the
best, and to be preferred before the things which are destinated to the
atchieuing of it; and every thing as it does more of less conduce hereunto, so
does it gain or lose a higher place in the work of excellency; because that
which aduanceth the end, most furthereth that which is most to be desired,
namely, perfection and fruition. Thus the end of Physic is health, and
therefore, that Physic is to be esteemed best, which most soundly and surely
confirms or recouereth it. The end of Law is Justice, that every man may
quietly enjoy his own, and therefore, that Law and practice of it, is to be
chiefly esteemed (not which through the help of Sophistical wit and
audacious skill, fills the Lawyers purse, by protracting suites, and
hindering or delaying the course of Justice, but) which best helps the Clyent
to the speediest and surest recovery of his right. The end of War is Peace,
and therefore, that war to be preferred, which being just, always ends in
such a peace as is sure, secure and permanent. Thus man, being the end of all
unreasonable creatures in the heavens and earth, they being made for his use
and benefit, is in this regard to be advanced in excellency above them all; and
every creature to be esteemed more or less good; as they more or less tend to
man's benefit and blessedness. And finally, because Almighty God is the supreme
end, he is also the chief Good, and all creatures to be esteemed in worth and
excellency, as they most serve for the magnifying of their Lord and Creator,
and the advancement of his glory for which end they have their being.

. Sect. 2 That the practice of Religion and godliness is to be preferred
before the theory and bare knowledge of it.
And thus the end of all arts and sciences is the practice of them, and
therefore the habit of skill showed in the exercise of the artsman, is much to
be preferred, because it is the end of theorie and speculation. And as this is
to be confessed in all other arts, so cannot it be denied of Divinity and
Religion, the practice whereof does in excellency surmount the knowledge and
theorie, as being the maine end whereunto it tends. For to what purpose do
men spend their spirits, and tire their wits, in discerning the light of truth,
if they do not use the benefit of it to direct them in all their ways? Why
do they rise betimes to see the Sun, if they mean to sit idly still and do
nothing, which better suiteth with palpable and Egyptian darkness? Why do
they with such care and labor, heap up these rich treasures of learning and
knowledge, if (miser-like) they only look upon them, and never make use of
them for the benefit of themselves and others? Why do they spend their whole
lives in sowing the seed, and never reap the crop? or having brought in the
harvest, and filled their barnes and granaries: what good will all this do
them, if they let it there must and mould, and never eat the fruit of their
labors? How vain therefore is their practice, who spend all their strength in
polemicall disputes, to euince error, and find out the truth, if when they
have found it, they will not walk in this light, nor let it be the guide of
their lives? like herein to foolish boys, who strive for a ball, which when
they have gotten with much sweat, and have no competitour to contend further
for it, they cast into a corner with careless neglect; or having fought even
unto blood, to beat others off a Mole hill, as from a fort of strength, do
make no further use of it when they have gotten quiet possession? How
fruitless are the labors of such Pastors and Preachers, who spend all their
time in painful studies, to barrel up that knowledge, which they mean never
to use, propounding no other end of their knowledge but to know, and as though
they envied all others their esteemed Jewel, never communicate it by painful
preaching unto their people; who through their negligence have no more use of
their gifts, then poor neighbors have of a misers treasure, which is fast
locked up from them in their barred chests; nor are more edifyed by their
knowledge, then if they were ignorant idiots, and destitute of all learning?
Herein also rich misers indeed, in that they do not only deprive others of
the use of their wealth, but defraud their own souls of the benefit of it,
letting it rust without the use and practice of it in a godly life; whereby as
they should shine unto others by a good example; so they should make their own
calling and election sure, and strengthen their faith in the assurance of
eternal blessedness, which is not promised to them that only know, but also do
the will of their Joh. 13. 17.
Master? Finally, how bootlesse and vain is the practice of such professors of
Religion among the people, who in their diligence to hear Sermons, and read
the Scriptures, take care only to inlighten their brains with knowledge,
which they wholly spend in proud disputes and lavish discourse, but never
suffer it to descend into their hearts, to warm and cherrish any holy
affections, nor to shine out unto others in the light of a godly life, to the
glory of God, and edification of their brethren by their godly example?

. Sect. 3 That the practice of godliness is an infallible sign of the
sincerity of our knowledge and profession.
Again, as the practice of all Christian duties in a godly life, is to be
preferred before knowledge and profession of Religion; so is it the sign and
seal whereby we may know if our knowledge be sound and saving, Luke 12. 47.
Ioh. 13. 17. Luke 11. 28.
and our profession in truth and without hypocrisy. For an idle and fruitless
knowledge furthereth not our salvation, but rather leaves us without excuse,
aggrauateth our sins, and increases our condemnation: for they are not
blessed, who know the greatest mysteries of Christ's Kingdom, but they who make
an holy use of what they know; not they that know these things (says our
Savior) but they who do them: not they that hear the Word only, but they
who keep it, are blessed. Not the hearers of the Law, but the doers thereof
are justified, says the Apostle Paul. And the Romans 2. 13.
Apostle James exhorts us to be not only hearers of the Word, but doers
also, seeing otherwise we shall but deceive our selves, and utterly lose all
the Jam. 1. 22.
fruit of our labors. Without which practice, knowledge puffs up: not 1.
Cor. 8. 1.
making us solidly wise, but (like bladders filled with wind) easily tossed up
and down at the pleasure of those who extol us with their praises: and is no
christian knowledge, though it comprehend the greatest mysteries of
Christianity, seeing we truly know only what we practice. For as the Apostle
John, teaching us to examine the truth of our knowledge, says, Hereby we know
that we know him, if we keep his Commandments. And he 1. Ioh. 2. 3, 4.
that says, I know him, and keeps not his Commandments, is a liar, and the
truth is not in him. Finally, the more we know, the more grievous shall our
sin and punishment be, if we do not practice it; For the servant that Luke
12. 47.
knows his masters will, and does it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.
Our profession likewise, without this practice, is but hypocritical, making us
to resemble the stony ground, which brought forth a fair green blade, but no
fruit to due maturity; like the fig tree, which having leaves but no figs, was
accursed; like the tree in the Garden, which cumbring the ground with its
fruitless presence, was threatened to be cut down; like Glowwormes, which
have some luster and brightness, but no heat; seeing such Professors shine
with some light of knowledge, but without all warmth of Christian charity.
Neither is that pure Religion and undefiled Iam. 1. 27.
before God, which like an empty barrel, makes a great sound in an outward
profession, but that which exercises it self in the duties of Christianity,
as to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep a
man's self unspotted of the world.

. Sect. 4 That the practice of godliness is the touchstone of our faith.
Furthermore, the just do live by their faith, which does ingraft them into
Christ their life and righteousness; and a godly life is the touchstone Hab.
2. 4. Ioh. 15. 2, 5.
which discerns a true and sincere faith, from that which is false and
hypocritical. It is the sign of our spiritual union and incision; for they
that are ingrafted into the true Vine Christ, do bring forth much fruit; and
they who do not, are either no branches at all, or such as are dead, and shall
be cut off. It is the fruit which the tree of faith bears, by which we may
discern a living from a dead faith, Iam. 2. 8.
and approve and manifest it unto others. It is the breath of this life of
faith, and the operation of this faculty, whereby we may discern whether it
be a living body, and lively sacrifice acceptable unto God; or a dead
carcass, which has only the show of a true body, but stinketh in his
nostrils, when for an oblation we offer it unto Iam. 2. 26.
him.

. Sect. 5 That though a godly life is not the cause, yet it is the way to
everlasting happiness.
Finally, a godly life, though it do not merit everlasting happiness, with
which it holds no proportion, yet it is the way that leads us thereunto,
Heb. 12. 14.
in which, whosoever travail, shall at the end of their journey surely attain to
eternal blessedness. And they who neglect it, being quite out of the way, can
never come unto that place of joy: For without holiness we shall never see
God. If we have not our part in the first resurrection to newness of life, we
shall have no part in the second, to glory and immortality, but living and
dying dead in sin, the second death also will seize upon us. And if we walk
not in this subordinate way of holiness and righteousness, which leads to
life and happiness, we can have no part in the Ioh. 14. 6.
chief and principal way Jesus Christ, without whom there is no salvation: 2.
Cor. 5. 17.
For as many as are in Christ, are new creatures; They that are Christ's, have
crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts; They that are baptized into
him, Gal. 5. 24.
are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up
from Romans 6. 4.
the dead, by the glory of the Father, even so they also should walk in
newness of Romans 8. 1.
life. They that are in Christ, walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit, and to such only there is no condemnation. Finally, they that are
ingrafted into the true vine Jesus Christ, shall bring forth in him, the ripe
and sweet Grapes of holiness and righteousness, and bearing fruit, shall be
more and more Ioh. 15. 2, 6.
purged by our heavenly Father, that they may daily increase in fruitfulness:
So that there is no other way to assure us of Christ and his benefits, no other
means to make our election and calling sure, then by adding 2. Pet. 1. 10.
one grace unto another, and bringing forth the fruits of them all in a
Christian life and holy conversation.

. Sect. 6 That all Gods Ministers should much enforce this doctrine and
practice of a godly life.
All which, as it evidently shows the excellency, profit, and necessity of
walking in this way of holiness and righteousness, (as I shall more
plentifully prove hereafter) so also how necessary and profitable it is for
Gods Ministers, who are appointed for guides unto others, that they do not
only themselves walk in this way, and shine as lights and patterns of
godliness in their holy and Christian conversation; but also that they shine
unto them in the light of their doctrine, teaching them the way which they
should choose, and what the acceptable will of God is, unto which they should
conform themselves in all holy obedience, persuading and exhorting them to go
forward when they are dull and sluggish, that their words may (as the Wise man
speaks) serve for goades to hasten their speed; and admonishing and
reproouing them when they leave Eccles. 12. 11.
this way, and wander in the by-ways of sin and wickedness, without which,
the godly life of the Minister is not sufficient, and his exemplary actions but
dumb signs, and oftentimes (through humane frailty) erroneous patterns, if
the Word preached do not give light and life unto them. In which regard, among
diverse of my worthy and godly brethren, who have profitably labored in this
Argument, and offered unto God their free will offerings of great value, I
likewise have adventured to cast my poor mite into this Treasury, that I may
not only hereby more and more stir up and provoke my self to walk more
carefully, conscionably, and cheerfully, in this path of piety, but also may,
as much as lies in me, both by word and writing, persuade many others to
bear me company.

CAP. II.
Containing the definition of a godly life, whereby we may know what it is, and
wherein it consists.

. Sect. 1 What a godly life is, both according to the Law, and also Gospel.
NOw that we may more orderly proceed in handling of this Argument, I will
first show what this godly life is, and what the duties are, which principally
are required unto it; and then propound the helps and means, whereby we may
be persuaded to enter into this Christian course, and enabled to proceed in it
conscionably and cheerfully. And first, if we define it in that legal
perfection which God requires: this godly life is an absolute conformity of
all our actions, and whole conversation, unto the will of God, which is the
perfect rule of holiness and righteousness, as it is revealed unto us in his
Word, especially in the Decalogue or ten Commandments, unto which we cannot
attain in this state of corruption and imperfection, seeing we are not
perfectly regenerate, but are partly flesh, and partly Spirit, and have the
relics of sin remaining in us, which as an heavy burden presses us down
in this way, and like fetters on our legs, Heb. 12. 1.
so hinders us, that we can but slowly and lamely proceed in our spiritual
journey: as we may see in the example of the Apostle, who professes that he
could not do the good which he would, but the evil which he would not; Romans
7. 15, 22.
and that whilst he was delighted in the Law of God, he found another law in
his members warring against the law of his mind, and leading him captive to the
law of sin. Notwithstanding we are to walk by this rule, and in our desire
and endeavor (as it were with an holy ambition) to aspire unto it; and though
we cannot reach unto this Sun of perfection, yet we must choose it for our
mark, and shoot toward it as high as we can, and be sorry and ashamed in our
selves, that we can shoot no higher; of which, we have the holy Apostle as a
pattern for our imitation, who forgetting those things Philip. 3. 13, 14.
which were behind, namely, the former part of his race in the way of
godliness, and reaching forth unto those things which were before, to wit,
that Christian perfection, unto which he had not yet attained, did press
toward the mark, for the price of the high calling of God, in Jesus Christ.
And this is that Evangelical and Sonne-like obedience, which God now under the
Covenant of grace requires of us, which if we labor to perform, he will
accept of us in Christ, and remember our sins no more, but will Ier 31 34.
Mal. 3. 17. 2. Cor. 8. 12.
spare us, as a man spares his son who serves him, accept of the will for
the deed, and covering the imperfections of our obedience with Christ's perfect
righteousness, and washing away the pollution and corruption of it, in his
most precious blood, he will be well pleased with us, and approve of us, as
though we had attained to perfect righteousness.

. Sect. 2 That a godly life, chiefly consists in Evangelical and filial
obedience, and what this is.
And in this filial obedience does that godly life principally consist, which
we now entreat of: for it is nothing else but a fervent desire, sound
resolution, and sincere endeavor, to conform our whole lives in all holy
obedience to Gods will, that we may please him in all things, and glorify his
holy name by our Christian conversation; or if we would have a more full
description of it: A godly life is the life of a Christian, who being
regenerate, quickened, and illuminated by Gods Spirit, and ingrafted into Christ
thereby, and by a lively faith, assuring him of Gods love, and his own
salvation, does in love and thankfulness toward him, desire, resolve, and
endeavor to please him in all things, by doing his will revealed in his Word,
and to glorify his name, by walking before him, in the duties of holiness,
righteousness, and sobriety, with faith; a pure heart, and good conscience all
the days of his life. In which description, we are to consider two things.
First, the person that leads this godly life, and secondly, the actions in
this life performed by him; the person is first named, and then described by
his state and properties. Concerning the first; he that leads this life, is
the Christian only. For as for the life of Heathens and Pagans, seem it never
so strict, just, and glorious, as of Socrates, Aristides, Cato, Seneca, and
such like, it is void of all true godliness, and not accepted of God, because
it is joined with ignorance of the true God, and Jesus Christ, idolatry,
will worship, infidelity, and all kind of heathenish impiety.

. Sect. 3 That the regenerate only can lead a godly life.
Neither do all that bear the name of Christians lead this godly life, but
they who are so, not in name and profession only, but in deed and truth; that
is, such only who are in that state, and qualified with those properties which
are set down in the former description. As first, that he be regenerate; for
they that are unregenerate, cannot perform any duty of a godly life which is
pleasing and acceptable to God, because being out of the Covenant, their
persons, and consequently their actions are not accepted of him, but are the
slaves of Satan, held captive to do his will; the 2. Tim. 2. 26. Ephesians. 2. 1, 3.
children of wrath, and enemies unto God and his grace, dead in trespasses and
sins, and therefore no more able to do the duties of holiness and
righteousness, then a dead man is able to do the actions of the living. In
which respect, the Apostle says, that we are not of our selves able to think
a good 2. Cor. 3. 5. Phil. 2. 13.
thought, nor so much as to will that which is good, because it is God only
which works in us both the will and the deed. Neither can we better our
estate by our own strength; for as the Prophet teaches us, as well may the
Ethiopian Ier. 13. 23.
change his blackness, and the Leopard his spots, as we do well, that are
accustomed to do evil: So that the regenerate man alone can lead a godly
life, or perform any duty acceptable unto God; for first Abel was accepted,
and then his sacrifice: and our persons must first be sanctified, before they
Genesis 4. 4.
can please God by our works of holiness. For as in the ceremonial law, the
touching of holy things did not sanctify and cleanse the polluted person, but
the person polluted did make the holy things to become unclean, as Haggai
speaks; so the works, which in themselves materially Hag. 2. 12, 13.
are good and holy, do not sanctify the unregenerate man that does them, but
through the taint and pollution of his sin, they also are polluted and
defiled. Now unto this regeneration two things are necessarily required. First,
that we have the Spirit of God dwelling in us: And secondly, the sanctifying
and saving graces of the Spirit, which always do accompany it: for the Spirit
of God is the Author of our regeneration, which begets us unto God,
according to that of our Savior, Except a man be borne of water and the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. And that John 3. 5.
of the Apostle; But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
justified, in 1. Cor. 6. 11. 2. Cor. 3. 2, 3. Tit. 3. 5.
the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. It is the Spirit
which mortifieth our sinful corruptions, by applying unto us the virtue of
Christ's death, and so by destroying the kingdom of sin, raises us out of
the state of death, and which gives unto us the spiritual life of grace, by
applying unto us the virtue of Christ's resurrection, which inableth us to do
the actions of the living. It is the Spirit that leads us into all John 16.
13. Romans 8. 14.
truth, and hereby assures us that we are the sons of God, seeing we
perform unto him filial obedience: And therefore they who will walk in the
ways of godliness, must have this holy Spirit to be their guide. They who
would outwardly move in the actions of piety and righteousness, must have
this inward cause to stir, strengthen, and support them: for as well may a
blind man travail uncouth ways without a leader, or the body move without
the soul, as we go in this Christian way, or do the works of God, unless
his holy Spirit be our guide and strength. The which must move us in the first
place, to labor earnestly to have this Spirit dwelling in us, and to use to
this purpose, that powerful means of effectual prayer, seeing our heavenly
Father has promised to give his holy Spirit to them that ask him, as our
Savior has Luke 11. 13.
taught us.

. Sect. 4 That the Spirit of God is the Author of spiritual life. 1.
And if we thus gain his company, and give him friendly intertainement when he
dwells in us, possessing our vessels in sanctification and honor, These. 4.
3. Ephesians. 4. 30. 1. These. 5. 19.
that they may be fit Temples for this pure Majesty, and not vexing and
grieuing this holy Ghest, by quenching those good motions which he suggesteth
unto us; then will not he be idle in us, but will direct and guide us in all
our ways, and enable and strengthen us unto all Christian duties of holiness
and righteousness; nor come alone to dwell in us, but accompanied with the
sweet society of all sanctifying and saving graces. And first of all, he will
quicken us in the life of grace, who were before dead in trespasses and sins,
and give unto us spiritual motion in all holy actions: Ephesians. 2. 1.
the which, though at first it be but weak, and scarcely to be discerned (like
a child newly quickened in the womb) yet shall it increase by degrees, until
we be strengthened for the spiritual birth, and grow up from age to age, and
from strength to strength, unto a perfect man, and unto the Ephesians. 4. 13.
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, of which life the Spirit of
God is the principal Author, according to that of the Apostle: If the Spirit
of Romans 8. 11.
him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal body, by his Spirit that
dwells in you: without the which we cannot once move in the ways of
godliness, nor after that we have begun, proceed or grow up unto any
perfection. And therefore when we find our selves dead and dull unto all good
actions, we are earnestly to pray with David, that God will revive and quicken
us Ps. 119. 25, 107.
by his grace and holy Spirit, that we may become active, and able to perform
the duties of a Christian and holy life.

. Sect. 5 That the Spirit inlighteneth us in the ways of godliness.
Secondly, having given unto us this life of grace, he will in the next place
indue us with spiritual light, and illuminate the blind eyes of our minds,
that we may understand the will and ways of God revealed in his Word, and
attain unto such a measure of saving knowledge, as may be sufficient to direct
us in all our thoughts, words, and actions. And this is that voice of the
Spirit, which in our conversion unto God, secretly whispereth in the ear of
our minds, as it were behind us, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when
ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to Esa. 30. 20.
the left. This is that dayspring, which the Sun of righteousness with his
arising has caused to appear and visit us, to give light unto us, who sat
Luke 1. 78, 79.
in darkness and in the shadow of death, and to guide our feet into the way
of peace. This is that Comforter which our Savior promised to send after his
resurrection, who should lead his Disciples, and with them, all the faithful
into all truth. This is that grace of God, which has appeared, teaching John
16. 13. Tit. 2. 11, 12.
us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously,
and godly in this present world. This is that holy ointment and precious
eye-salue, which opens and illighteneth the blind eyes of our minds, that we
may know all things appertaining to our salvation; so as we need no Tutor to
teach us any other doctrine, but as the same anointing has 1. Ioh. 2. 20, 27.
taught us of all things. Whereof he is called the Spirit of truth, not only
because he is most true, and Truth it self, but also teaches and guides us
in the ways of truth. And the spirit of illumination and wisdom, not only
Ioh 14. 17, and 15. 26.
because there is in him a measure, without measure, of light and knowledge,
but also illighteneth our minds darkened with ignorance, and makes us who were
only wise unto evil, wise unto good, and to the eternal Ier. 4. 22.
salvation of our own souls. And unless we be thus illightened by the Spirit
of God, and have the way of salvation revealed unto us, it remains an hidden
mystery, of which we are not capeable in our natural understanding; for as
the Apostle teaches us, The natural man understands Ephesians. 3 3, 5.
not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him;
neither can 1. Cor. 2. 14.
he know them, because they are spiritually discerned, and the things of God
knows no man, but the Spirit of God, and they unto whom by the Spirit they
are revealed. Verse. 10. 11.
Unless this light shine in our hearts, we remain in more then an Egyptian
darkness, sitting still in error and sin, and not being able to move in
the actions of holiness and righteousness; neither is it possible that we
should walk in the ways of God, until by the light of his Spirit they be
revealed unto us. Finally, we must first know the will of God, before we can
do it, and so attain unto everlasting blessedness. And Ioh. 13. 17.
therefore in the next place, if we would lead this godly life, we must desire
to be enlightened by Gods Spirit in the knowledge of his will, and to have the
light of spiritual wisdom added to the life of grace, that knowing it in our
understandings, we may yield obedience unto it in our lives and conuersations;
praying to this purpose without ceasing for our selves, as the Apostle for the
Ephesians; That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Ephesians. 1. 17, 18.
Father of Glory, would give unto us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
the knowledge of him; the eyes of our understanding being enlightened, that we
may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of
his inheritance in the Saints, etc.

. Sect. 6 That we must be ingrafted into Christ, before we can lead a godly
life.
The second maine thing required in those who are to lead a godly life is,
that they be ingrafted into Jesus Christ, by virtue of which union he becoming
their head, and they his members, they have communion with him, and are made
partakers of the virtue of his death and resurrection, Romans 6. 12.
whereby their sins are mortified and crucified, so as they can no longer
reign in their mortal bodies, and they quickened unto holiness and newness
of life, and so enabled to bring forth the fruits of obedience in the whole
course of their conversation. For we are naturally dead and buried in the grave
of sin, and not able to stir or move in the actions of godliness; but no
sooner are we joined to him, and touch his body crucified by the hand of faith,
but presently (like the body touched by Elizaeus 2. King. 13. 21.
in the grave) we receive such virtue and vigor from him, that we are revived
and raised from this grave of sin, unto holiness and newness of life. We
are by nature wild vines, who bring forth nothing but sour grapes of
maliciousness and sin; but when we are ingrafted into the Ioh. 15. 1, 4, 5,
8.
true vine Jesus Christ, we change our nature, and receiving the lively sap of
grace from this root of righteousness, we bring forth the fruits of
obedience, whereby our heavenly Father is glorified, and we assured of our
election and salvation. Finally, without him we can of our selves do Matthew.
5. 16. 2. Pet. 1. 10.
nothing, as he has taught us; but being united unto him, we may say with the
Apostle, that we can do all things through Christ which strengthens us.
Phil. 4. 13.
And this is that which the same Apostle teaches us: We are buried (says Romans
6. 4, 5, 6.
he) with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from
the dead, by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness
of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death;
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: Knowing this, that our
old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that
henceforth we should not serve sin. And therefore if we would be new
creatures, let us put on Jesus Christ, and labor to be united unto him by his
holy Spirit and a Romans 13. 14.
lively faith; for in him alone we are elected unto holiness; in him only we
are created unto good works, which God has before ordained that we should
Ephesians. 1. 4. and 2. 10
walk in them.

. Sect. 7 That only those can lead a godly life, who are in the covenant of
grace.
The third thing required is, that we be in the covenant of grace, made with us
in Jesus Christ, whereby God has assured us that he will be our God, and that
we shall be his people; he our gracious Father, and we his children, whom he
will accept in his best beloved. For until we be in this covenant, our persons
are not accepted, we remaining the slaves of sin, and in the state of death
and condemnation, and consequently, nothing which we can do, seem it never so
glorious, is pleasing in Gods sight. We are till then under the law and
covenant of works, if not as it was given to the Jews, yet as it was engraven
in our hearts in our creation; and Romans 2. 14, 15.
consequently under the curse which is denounced against all that do not Gal.
3. 10.
continue in all which is written in the book of the law to do it, namely, in
that perfection which the law requires. Of which, failing innumerable times,
we cannot, according to this strict rule, yield obedience, nor perform the
duties of a godly life. But when we are admitted into the covenant of grace
made in Jesus Christ, then this rigor of the law is remitted, and we are tied
only to the obedience of sons, which consists more in our wills, desires,
and endeavors, then in our abilities to perform our duty in perfection. The
which obedience as this perfect law of liberty does require, so does it enable
us to do that which it requires. For in this covenant the Lord promises that
he will take away our stony hearts, which Ezekiel. 11. 29. and 36. 26. Ioh. 16. 13.
will rather break, then bow unto his will, and give us hearts of flesh, which
will incline to all good motions of his Word and holy Spirit. And that he will
give his holy Spirit unto us, to conduct and rule us in all our 1. Ioh. 2. 27.
ways, and to support, strengthen, and comfort us against all the difficulties
and discouragements, which do affront and cross us in our Christian course.
That he will write his Law, not in Tables of stone, but in our Ier. 31. 31, 32,
33, 34.
hearts, that we may not depart from him. And if contrary to our purpose we
slip in our way, the Lord has promised that he will not remember our Mal. 3.
17.
sins to impute them unto us, but will spare us as a father spares his son
that serves him. Now what can be a greater encouragement unto the performance
of all the duties of an holy life, then to know that we are accepted of God,
and that our obedience, though imperfect and mingled with much corruption and
weakness, shall in Christ, not only be pardoned, but highly regarded and
richly rewarded by our loving Father? And therefore let us labor to be in the
covenant of grace, unto which, nothing on our part is required, but a lively
faith in Christ, applying all Gods promises made unto us in him, and that we
bring forth the fruits of this faith in unfeigned repentance and new obedience.

. Sect. 8 That a lively faith is necessarily required unto a godly life.
The fourth thing required in those who are to lead a godly life, is a lively
faith; whereby we understand, not only a general faith, whereby we know and
believe that the duties which we perform, are agreeable to Gods will, and
warranted by his Word: but a true, lively, and justifying faith, whereby we are
ingrafted into Jesus Christ, and made partakers of all his benefits. For we
must first by him be made righteous, before we can do the works of
righteousness; we must first become good trees, Matthew. 7. 18.
before we can yield good fruits, and be lively branches of the true Vine Jesus
Christ, which suck from this root the sap of grace and holiness, before we
can bear the sweet and ripe grapes of new and true obedience, which are
acceptable to God, and well rellishing unto his taste. In which respect the
Apostle tells us, that without faith it is impossible to please God, Heb. 11.
6.
because whatsoever is not of faith, is sin. Besides, our best righteousness
is Esa. 64. 6.
like a polluted cloth, stained with our corruptions, and mingled with our
imperfections, and consequently cannot endure the severe trial of Gods strict
justice, nor be accepted of him (who being infinite in perfection in himself,
allows of nothing that is imperfect) unless being united unto Christ, we be
made partakers of the benefit of his death and obedience, and so have the
imperfection of our actions covered with his perfect righteousness, and their
pollution washed clean away in his most precious blood. And therefore if we
would lead such a godly life as may be pleasing unto God, we must first labor
to be endued with a lively faith, that all our fruits of obedience springing
from this root, may be accepted, in and for Christ, and be allowed through
his righteousness and obedience, which deserve to be rejected in respect of
their own pollution and imperfection.

. Sect. 9 That the duties of a godly life must spring from the fountain of
love.
The fifth thing required is, that all the duties of a godly life which we
perform, do spring from the fountain of love, which is a fruit of a lively
faith, whereby being assured of Gods love toward us in Jesus Christ, we begin
to love him again, and our neighbors for his sake; and receiving the bright
beams of his favor into our hearts, have them illightened and warmed thereby,
and so reflect them back again toward God, in our love of his Majesty and
zeal of his glory, abhorring whatsoever is displeasing, and loving and
practicing that which is acceptable in his 1. Tim. 1. 5. Matthew. 22. 40. Romans
13. 10.
sight. For this love is the end of Gods commandments, and compriseth in it
the whole sum and substance of the Law, and therefore it is the base and
foundation of all true obedience; and whatsoever proceeds not from love,
cannot be accounted any service unto God, seeing it is not done for his sake,
but out of self-love, and for worldly respects, which being sinful and
corrupt, do pollute all the actions which do spring from them.

. Sect. 10 That the duties of a godly life must proceed from thankfulness.
The sixth thing required unto a godly life is, that we perform all holy and
Christian duties out of our thankfulness toward God, as for all his benefits
spiritual and corporal bestowed upon us, namely, our election, creation,
preservation, and the rest, so especially for that maine benefit, the great
work of our redemption by Jesus Christ, whereby he has made us, of the slaves
of Satan, his own servants, of the children of wrath, his own children by
adoption and grace, of the servants of sin, the servants of righteousness,
and of the heirs of hell and condemnation, coheires with Christ, and
inheritours of heavenly happiness. The which benefits being rightly
considered, must needs make us truly thankful unto him of whom we have so
great salvation, and out of this thankfulness, truly zealous of his glory to
whom we are so deeply indebted, and to express both the one and the other, by
our earnest endeavor, and conscionable care to glorify his holy name, by
shining before men in the light of a godly life. And that this ought to be the
maine motive to incite unto the practice of an holy conversation; it appears
hereby, in that the Apostles do so frequently use it as a forcible argument
to provoke us unto it. You are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in
your body and in 1 Cor. 5. 20.
your Spirit which are Gods. Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light
in Ephesians. 5. 8.
the Lord, walk as children of light. And therefore we must take heed that we
do not perform holy duties out of an opinion of merit to make God beholding
unto us, or to satisfy his justice which is only done by Christ's perfect
righteousness and obedience, or to leave our works of supererrogation as a
treasure unto the Church, to be sold unto those, who most wanting them, will
buy them at the highest price; or to purchase by them Gods heavenly Kingdom,
which is a free inheritance, and the mere gift Matthew. 25. 31. Romans 6. 23.
of grace, which God has of his sole bounty and good will given unto us, in
and for Jesus Christ; but let us do what we are able (and be sorry in our
hearts that we can do no more) out of unfeigned thankfulness unto God, for
the many and inestimable benefits, which of his free grace and undeserved
goodness he has multiplied on us.

. Sect. 11 That the duties of a godly life must be done in humility.
The seventh thing required unto a godly life is, that all the Christian Esa.
57. 17.
duties which we perform, be done in humility and lowliness of spirit; for
this is a grace most acceptable unto God, which will move him to inhabit in
us as his Temples by his holy Spirit, for he dwells with him, that is of a
contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive
the heart of the humble ones. It moves him to bestow all other graces, and
inlargeth our hearts that they may be fit to receive them; for the meek will
he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. And Psalm. 25. 9.
this Argument the Apostle Peter uses to persuade us to be clothed with 1.
Pet. 5. 5.
humility: Because God resists the proud, and gives grace unto the humble.
It is the ornament and sign of all other graces, and of all Christian duties,
whereby we may know whether they be counterfeit and hypocritical, or in
sincerity and truth: for the oil of saving grace, and the water and wind of
pride, will not mix together, and therefore we must be emptied of the one,
before we can be replenished with the other. According to the song of the
blessed Virgin; He has filled the hungry with good Luke 1. 53.
things, and the rich he has sent empty away. So that if we would be enriched
with Gods graces, and be strengthened by his Spirit unto the duties of a godly
life, we must, as we increase in them, increase also in humility, and as our
Savior has taught us, When we shall have done all those things which are Luke
17. 10.
commanded us, we must acknowledge that we are unprofitable servants, who have
done nothing but that which was our duty to do. To which purpose let us often
meditate of the imperfections and corruptions of our best actions, which might
justly move the Lord to reject them, and us also for them, if in the severity
and strictness of his justice he should look upon them. Let us think not
only of the good we do, but also of the evil which we commit, and the good
which we leave undone, and then there will be no place for pride, but rather
for that bitter and lamentable complaint of the Apostle, That which I do, I
allow not; for the good that I would, I do not, Romans 7. 15, 19, 24.
but the evil which I would not, that I do; O wretched man that I am, who
shall deliver me from the body of this death? Let us consider not so much how
far we have proceeded in the Christian race, but rather how much remains,
and how far we yet come short of the goal of perfection, according to the
Apostles example, I count my self (says he) not to have apprehended; but this
one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, Phil. 3. 13, 14.
and reaching forth to those things which are before, I press toward the
mark for the price of the high calling in Christ Jesus. Finally, though we had
attained unto some perfection, yet there were no place for pride, but rather
for the greater humility, seeing we are the more indebted unto God for his
abundant grace and bounty, for (as the Apostle says) Who makes thee to
differ from another? And what have we that we have not received? now if thou
did receive it, why do thou glory, as if thou had not received it? For
who is proud of his debts? or the more puffed up, the more he is obliged to
another? And as we must in these respects in our greatest perfection be humble
toward God, so also toward our brethren, whom we seem to have out-runne in
the Christian race; seeing we have out-stripped them, not in our own strength,
for naturally we are alike, dead in trespasses and Ephesians. 2. 1, 3.
sins, and the children of wrath as well as they, but it is Gods free grace
that has put this difference between us; which if we be humble and meek in
spirit, he will daily continue with increase, but if we wax proud of our
gifts and progress in the ways of godliness, and boast with the Pharise Luke
18.
of our good deeds, preferring our selves before others whom we think do
come far behind us; God, who abhors pride above all other vices, because
it most impeacheth his glory, can stint his bounty, and withdraw his strength,
he can put a thorn in our foot which will stay our speed, and cause the
messenger of Satan to cross us in our course, and by his buffettings 2. Cor.
12. 7.
to hinder us in our race, till we have learned to be more humble. As on the
other side, he can enrich those whom we have most contemned with a large
measure of saving grace, and put such vigor and virtue into them by his holy
Spirit, that they shall as much outstrip us in the ways of godliness, as
before we seemed unto our selves to have out-runne them.

. Sect. 12 That we must propound Gods glory as the end of all our actions.
The last thing required unto this godly life is, that we propound Gods glory
as the maine end of all our actions, not doing them for worldly respects, Romans
14. 8.
or our own profit either temporal or spiritual principally, but that Gods
will may be done in them; for he is the summum bonum, and supreme end of all
things, and for his glory we were elected, created, redeemed, justified,
sanctified, and shall be glorified. And when we have attained to heavenly
happiness, and have the possession and fruition of Gods everlasting Kingdom,
the maine end of all our glory shall be, to glorify God, who has thus
advanced and glorified us. For the four and twenty Apoc. 4. 10, 11.
Elders (in the Revelation) fell down before him that sat on the throne, and
worshipped him that lives for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the
throne, saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and
praise; for thou have created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and
were created. The which their practice we must imitate in the Kingdom of
grace, if ever we mean to reign with them in the Kingdom of glory; laboring
to do Gods will in earth, as it is done in heaven, with all alacrity and
cheerfulness, speed and diligence, that his name may be hallowed and
glorified, and his Kingdom advanced and magnified, as we beg in the Lords
prayer. For as it is the subordinate end of our election, that we may be holy,
so the maine and supreme end of this end is, that our holiness and
glorification may be to the praise of the glory of Gods grace, Ephesians. 1. 4, 6.
who of his free mercy has sanctified and glorified us. And therefore in all
our actions we must propound Gods glory as the supreme end of them, according
to that of the Apostle; Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, 1.
Cor. 11. 31.
do all to the glory of God. So our Savior commands us, that our lights
should to this end shine before men, that they seeing our good works, may
glorify Matthew. 5. 16.
our Father which is in heaven. And the Apostle Peter exhorts us, to have our
conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak against us as
1. Pet. 2. 12.
evil doers, they may by our good works which they shall behold, glorify God
in the day of visitation. And if thus by our godly lives we glorify God on
earth, he will glorify us in heaven; but if in leading these lives, we
Pharisaically Matthew. 6. 2.
aim at our own glory, we have all the reward which we can expect; or if
neglecting this maine end, we principally aim at our own good, which should
be subordinate unto it, as the satisfying of Gods justice for our sins, to be
registered in the Calender of the Saints, or to merit and purchase for our
selves the Crown of eternal blessedness, we shall hereby derogate from the
glory of Gods free grace, and the all-sufficient merits and satisfaction of
Jesus Christ, and so, after all our pains and labor, be utterly frustrate of
our hopes.

CAP. III.
Of the maine matter of a godly life, namely, that it must be framed according
to Gods will, in holiness, righteousness, and sobriety.

. Sect. 1 That we can no otherwise please God, then by framing our lives
according to his will.
WHat the person must be that is to lead a godly life, and how he ought to be
qualified that must offer unto God any acceptable service, we have showed in
the former Chapter. And now it remains that we entreat of the latter part of
the description, wherein the actions which in this life are to be performed,
are generally expressed. And here two things are to be considered, first, the
matter of this godly life, or the maine duties which are to be performed; and
secondly, the form and manner how they ought to be done. The matter is either
general, or more special. Generally, it is required, that we please God in
all things, conforming our wills and actions, our thoughts, words, and works,
in all holy obedience to his will, leaving and forsaking whatsoever is
displeasing unto him, and repugnant to his holy will and commandment, and
contrariwise embracing and practicing whatsoever is acceptable in his sight;
for his will is the perfect rule of righteousness, and whatsoever agrees with
it, is just and good, but whatsoever swarueth from it, either on the right hand
o^ the left, is crooked, evil, and wicked, and consequently odious and
displeasing in his sight. And therefore if we would please God, we must in the
first place deny our selves and our own wills, saying with our Savior, Not my
will, but thine be done; neither must we ask counsel of carnal reason, nor
when we know Gods will, dispute with flesh and blood, whether it be fit or
unfit, profitable or unprofitable, reasonable or against reason, to do that
which God commands, but we must yield unto it absolute obedience, doing Gods
will, as the Saints and Angels do it in heaven, cheerfully and readily,
without gainesaying, doubting, or replying. For if earthly Princes will not
endure to have subjects scan their Laws, nor examine their Proclamations, to
see with what reason they command, but require absolute obedience in all things
not repugnant to the Law of God, and will not be served according to their
subjects best intentions, but will have their obedience squared by their Laws:
If every master in a family will be served according to his own pleasure, and
will not for matter or manner leave it to his servants choice, to perform what
service best sorteth with their own humor and liking; And if the Captain of
a company, or General of an Army, will not excuse in a Soldier the neglect
of their commands, upon the fairest pretense, but severely punish even
prosperous disobedience, and succesfull disorder with great severity; then how
much less will the King of kings endure to have his will neglected, and ours
preferred in his service? And how much more will he who is the Lord of hosts,
be displeased with us, if in our spiritual warfare we regard not what he
commands, but perform such service as best suiteth with our own conceits?
No man that warreth (says the Apostle) intangleth 2. Tim. 2. 4.
himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who has
chosen him to be a Soldier; and if a man strive for masteries, yet is he not
crowned, except he strive lawfully; that is, according to the orders appointed
by him who is master of the games. And therefore let us not think to have the
Crown and Garland of happiness, if we stint God of this royalty and
privilege which we give unto men, not striving for victory according to his
will, nor offering unto him that service which he requires, but such as
seems good in our own eyes.

. Sect. 2 That not Gods secret but revealed will must be the rule of our lives
and actions.
Now whereas I say that we must please God in all things by doing his will, I
do not hereby understand his secret will, which being unknown Deuteronomy. 29. 29.
to us we cannot obey. Neither does this will appertain to us, according to
that, The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which
are revealed, belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do the
words of this Law. Nor does it need our endeavor to bring it to performance:
for who has resisted this will of the Lord? What wisdom or understanding can
cross his counsel? Seeing he who is infinite in power, Romans 9. 19. Pro. 21.
30.
and immutable in truth, has said, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all
Esa. 46. 10.
my pleasure. Yea this will is done by wicked men and the devils themselves
whether they will or no, and when they most seek to resist it, they accomplish
and bring it to pass. Neither are we with Euthusiasts and Familists to expect
that the will, which must be the rule of our obedience, should be made known
unto us by new revelations: for the Lord has once spoken unto us by his Son,
the true and only Prophet of his Heb. 1. 1, 2.
Church, and by him has perfectly revealed unto us his will and pleasure, with
all things that are necessary for our salvation. All which is contained fully
in the Book of holy Scriptures which were indicted by his Spirit, and 2. Pet.
1. 21.
written by holy men inspired thereby to this purpose, that revealing perfectly
the will of God, they might for ever serve to be unto the whole Church and
every faithful member of it, the sole rule and squyre of all their actions,
from which they are enjoined under that great penalty of Gods curse, not to
swerve, either on the one side or on the other. So by Moses the Lord
commands, that the people should hearken unto his Statutes Deuteronomy 4. 2.
and Judgments to do them, and that they should add nothing to the Deuteronomy. 12.
8, 32. Number. 15. 39.
words which he commanded them, nor diminish ought from them; and restrains
them from their own will in his service: Ye shall not (says he) do after
Deuteronomy. 5. 32. and 28. 14.
all the things that we do hear this day, every man what is right in his own
eyes: whatsoever thing I command you, observe to do it; you shall not add
unto it, nor diminish from it. So Iosuah is commanded to do according to the
Law, and not to turn from it, to the right hand, nor to the left. So Hierome
Ios. 1. 7. Ad normam omnia diriguntur, etc. Hieron. in Galat. 6.
speaks to the same purpose; All things (says he) are directed according to
the rule, which shows whether they be crooked or straight. And so the
doctrine of God is a certain rule of speech, which judges between things
just and unjust, which whosoever follows, shall have peace in himself, that
passes all sense and understanding; and with it the mercy of God which is
above all.

. Sect. 3 Reasons proouing that we can no otherwise please God then by doing
his will.
Unto which testimonies diverse reasons might be added, which evidently prove,
that we can no otherwise please God by our lives, then by framing them
according to his will, and doing such service as in his Word he requires, both
in respect of the matter, and also the manner. As first, because hereby we
shall prefer our own wisdom before the wisdom of God, neglecting that
worship which he has appointed, either in respect of the matter or manner,
because in our foolish conceit we suppose that we can devise a better; which
is such an indignity offered unto his Majesty, that no earthly Prince would
endure it at the hand of his greatest subjects. Secondly, we shall hereby
disgrace Gods Law and Word, which he has appointed to be the rule of all our
lives and actions, as though it were insufficient to that end for which God
has ordained it; whereas the Apostle tells us, that they are profitable for
doctrine, reproof, 2. Tim. 3. 16, 17.
correction, instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. And the Lord himself has
enjoined us to go unto them as unto the only Judge and counselor, to be
resolved in all our doubts, and directed in all our actions. To the Law and
Esa. 8. 20.
to the Testimony. And our Savior to the same purpose has exhorted us Joh.
5. 39.
to search the Scriptures, because our ignorance of them, is the maine cause
Matthew. 22. 29.
of all our errors both in doctrine and manners. Thirdly, whilst we neglect
Gods Word in serving him, and follow our own inventions, we shall not do
Gods will, but our own, and in stead of doing him service, we shall serve our
own lusts which are most opposite unto him, committing herein a gross
absurdity, in thinking to please God, by offering unto him a service, not
which he in his wisdom has prescribed as most fit, but that which is devised
and appointed by our own fleshly wisdom, Romans 8. 6, 7, 8. Genesis 6. 5.
which is enmity against him, and our natural imaginations, which are only
and continually evil. Fourthly, if we neglect the direction of Gods Word, in
performing service unto him, though it be, not in the matter, but the manner
only, God will neglect our service, as being mere will worship, and not that
which he has appointed, according to his saying to the Jews by the Prophet
Esaias, Who has required these things at your hands? yea he will reject it as
odious and abominable, as he did the sacrifices Esa. 1. 12.
of the Jews, who in serving him, chose their own ways, and in their hearts
and souls still delighted in their abominations, when in outward appearance
they seemed devout in offering unto him sacrifices and oblations, Esa. 66. 3.
as elsewhere he protests by the same Prophet. Neither will our good
meanings, blind zeal, and superstitious devotion, make our will worship
accepted of God, seeing they are in themselves sinful, and one sin will not
excuse another. Yea if we have no better guides to direct us, we shall for Gods
true service, embrace, and even tire our selves in the service of the devil,
as we see in the example of the Jews, whose blind zeal misled them out of
the way of salvation, into the way of destruction, whilst neglecting the
righteousness of faith in Jesus Christ, they endeavored to establish their
own righteousness. And of the Apostle Paul, who by Romans 10. 3.
an ignorant zeal was made (as he confesses) even mad against the Act. 26.
11.
Saints, and with all raging cruelty, set himself to destroy the Church of
God. And finally, of those honorable women spoken of in the Acts of the
Apostles, who out of their blind devotion, raised persecution against Paul and
Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. Fifthly, if we serve Act. 13.
50.
not God according to his will and Word, but according to our own good
meanings and blind devotions, it will not be pleasing to God, as not being
done in faith, but doubtingly, not knowing whether the duties which we
perform, be agreeable to his will or no: or rather without doubting we may
know, that our service is not according to Gods will; and therefore displeasing
unto him, seeing he has prefectly revealed his will in his Word, both
concerning that which he would have us do, and Romans 6. 23.
that which he would have us leave undone; and consequently, such service is
not only without, but contrary to faith, and most odious unto God. Sixthly, all
our pains taken in this service, which is not warranted by Gods Word, but done
according to our own inventions, good meanings, and traditions of men, are in
vain, and all our labor lost, which is thus spent in will worship and blind
superstition; according to that of our Savior, In vain they worship me,
teaching for doctrines men's precepts. Yea Matthew. 15. 8, 9.
they are not only vain, and as the Apostle speaks, perish in the using,
Col. 2. 22.
but evil, both simply and by accident: for who can bring good out of evil?
that which is clean, out of that which is unclean? or spiritual service unto
Job 14 4.
God, out of the forge of our carnal reason and evil imaginations? seeing
Genesis 6. 5. John 3. 6.
our Savior has taught us, that, that which is of the flesh, is flesh; and
that which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit. And as it is simply evil in
respect of the evil fountain from which it springs, so also accidentally,
in that it is preferred before the Word and will of God, and by taking place of
it, does cause it to be clean thrust out of doors, as we see in the example of
the superstitious Pharisees, who in setting up their own traditions, made Math.
15. 4, 5, 6.
Gods Commandments void and of none effect; and of the Papists, who by making
room for their blind devotions, have quite exiled all the parts and means of
the true service of God. In which regard, all the labor which is thus spent,
does not only not please God, and so lose all reward, but much displease him
and provoke his wrath, and pull down his heavy judgments upon all such as
tender such service unto him, both in this life and the life to come. Of the
former we have an example in Nadab Leuit. 10. 2. and 9. 24.
and Abihu, who were consumed with fire from heaven, because they offered
strange fire unto God, and did not use that fire which he had sent down from
heaven to this purpose. In Saul, whose kingdom was rent from him, either for
offering sacrifice himself which did not belong unto him (for which sin also
Vzziah was smitten with leprosy) or for not staying the time appointed by God
and his Prophet Samuel. And in Vzzah, who 2. Chro. 26. 19.
was smitten with present death, because being but a Leuite, he took upon 2.
Sam. 6. 6.
him to touch the Arc, which none might do but the Priests, and suffered it
to be carried in a cart, which should have been borne upon their shoulders.
Number. 4. 15.
Unto which punishments (and the like) of this life, God will add those
eternal punishments in the life to come, upon those that add unto, or detract
from his will, which the Apostle John threatens against those who add unto,
or detract from his Prophecy, namely, loss of heavenly Apoc. 22. 18.
happiness, and all the plagues written in that book, among which are the
torments of hell fire, and everlasting condemnation of body and soul. And
therefore when we come thus far, as to have fervent desires and great
devotion to serve God, let us take heed that the devil do not delude us, by
persuading us through his instruments, to spend all our labor, not only in
vain, but also to loss, nor to lay out our good intentions (as it were) good
coin, upon the base trifles of humane traditions, will worship, and our own
inventions, as worshipping of Saints and Angels, Masses, Pilgrimages, Popish
Fasts, Penances, and punishing of our bodies, mumbling of Latin Prayers
without understanding, satisfactions, and such like; seeing these are not only
not commanded, but expressly contrary to Gods will and Word. And the Apostle
also has given us warning to take heed of, and avoid them, as having only a
show of wisdom, in will worship, and humility, and not sparing of the body,
and in truth are meerefolly, being Col. 2. 23.
flatly opposite to the wisdom of God. But resolving to please God by leading
a godly life, let us make his will revealed in his Word, the rule and squyre of
all our actions, resolving and indeuouring to do that which in this Word is
commanded and enjoined, and to leave undone what in it is forbidden and
condemned.

. Sect. 4 The special duties in which a godly life chiefly consists.
And thus we see what is the maine and general matter of a godly life, namely,
such a carriage and conversation whereby we please God in all things, by doing
his will revealed in the Scriptures; more specially a godly life consists in
our walking before him in the duties of piety, righteousness and sobriety,
with faith, a pure heart, and good conscience all the days of our lives. In
which words, three things are contained. First, the duties which in this godly
life are to be performed. Secondly, the foundation upon which they are
grounded, and the fountains from which they ought to flow. Thirdly, their time
of continuance, and how long by us they are to be performed. The duties of a
godly life are all referred unto three heads. First, piety toward God which
compriseth in it all Religion, the whole worship and service of God both
public and private, with the matter, manner, time, means, and all
circumstances, and in a word, all the duties required in the first table.
Secondly, righteousness toward our neighbors, whereby we deal with them, as
we would have them to deal with us, and give unto every one their own,
behauing our selves justly with all, and mercifully with all those who need our
help. Thirdly, sobriety and temperance toward our selves, whereby we possess
our vessels in purity and honor, as it becomes the Temples of the holy 1.
Tim. 2. 5.
Ghost. Secondly, there is here expressed certain fundamental virtues, upon
which, our virtuous and godly actions ought to be grounded, and from which
they must spring and flow, if we would have them acceptable unto God; namely, a
lively faith, without which we cannot please him; a pure heart, from which as
a fountain flows all true obedience; and a good conscience, purged from dead
works by the precious blood of Christ, which warranteth all our actions done
in faith, as approved of God, and so inciteth and incourageth us to bring
forth the fruits of new obedience, when as we know that our persons and all
our actions are accepted of God in Jesus Christ. And lastly, here is expressed
the time how long we are to continue in the doing of the duties of a godly
life, namely, not for a while, no nor yet for a long time together, but
indefinitely we are to continue in bringing forth these fruits of obedience,
throughout the whole course of our lives, and as the Apostle teaches us, never
be weary of well-doing. But of these points I shall have occasion to speak
more largely afterward, and therefore 2. These. 3. 13.
will content my self for the present, thus briefly to have touched them, for
the explaining of the former description of a godly life.

CAP. IIII.
Of the form and manner how all Christian duties ought to be performed,
namely, with feruency of desire, a settled resolution, and earnest endeavor to
please God in all things.

. Sect. 1 That these desires, resolutions, and endeavors are required of all
those who will serve and please God.
ANd so I come from the matter of it, and the duties therein required, to
speak of the form and manner, how they may be so performed, as that they may
be acceptable in Gods sight. And heereunto there concur three things: First,
feruencie of desire: Secondly, a settled resolution: And thirdly, an hearty and
earnest endeavor to please God in all things by doing his will, in the duties
of piety, righteousness, and sobriety. First, our hearts must be inflamed
with fervent desires to please God in all things, and to do his will in as
great perfection here on earth, as the Angels and Saints do it in heaven,
although we cannot possibly in this state of sin and corruption attain unto
it. So the Church professes of her self: In the way of Esa. 26. 8, 9.
thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee, the desire of our soul is to
thy name, and to the remembrance of thee; with my soul have I desired thee in
the night, yea with my spirit within me will I seek thee early. The which
desires break out into longing wishes after that perfection which we cannot as
yet compass, as we see in David; O that my ways were directed to keep thy
Psalm. 119. 5.
statutes! And are accompanied with bitter grief and lamentable complaints,
when as we find them crossed with our corruption, and defeated by the
tentations of the devil and the world; as we see in the Apostles example; To
will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find To. 7.
18, 19, etc.
not. For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not,
that I do, etc. for I delight in the Law of God after the inner man, but I see
another law in my members warring against the Law of my mind, and bringing me
into captivity to the law of sin, which is in my members. O wretched man that
I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? And this fervent
desire of the heart to please God by doing his will, is always accompanied
with an undaunted resolution and settled purpose of the will to shake off all
delays, and break through all difficulties which hinder us in our course, and
with all care and good conscience, to use all helps, whereby we may be enabled
and furthered in Gods service. And thus David resolves that he will keep
Psalm. 119. 8, 30, 32, 33, 34.
Gods statutes. I have chosen the way of truth, thy judgments have I laid
before me. I will run the way of thy Commandments; when thou shall enlarge
my heart. Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I shall keep it unto
the end. Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy Word; yea I shall observe
it with my whole heart. And from this desire of the heart, and resolution of
the will, there follows an earnest endeavor in the whole man, of conforming
all our powers and parts, words and works, intentions and actions to the will
of God, that we may in all things please him, and glorify his name, by having
the light of our lives shining before men; according Matthew. 5. 16.
to the exhortation of the Apostle, Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever 1.
Cor. 10. 31.
ye do, do all to the glory of God.

. Sect. 2 That all Evangelical obedience consists chiefly in these desires,
resolutions and endeavors.
And in these desires, resolutions, and endeavors does consist the very form
and essence of a godly life, it being the top of that perfection which Act. 11.
23.
we can attain unto in this state of imperfection. This is that Evangelical
obedience which in the Gospel is required of us, as we see in the Acts of the
Apostles, where Barnabas exhorts the Church of Antioch, not to perform that
perfect obedience which the Law exacteth, which was a yoke too heavy for any to
bear, but that with purpose of heart, they would cleave unto the Lord. Unto
which also the Gospel inableth us, being made powerful and effectual by Gods
grace, and the inward operation of his holy Spirit. This is that sonne-like
obedience which God now requires of us, which if we perform, we and our
service shall be accepted of God in Christ, our imperfect righteousness being
covered with his perfect obedience, and our corruptions washed away in his
blood. For he spares us, as a loving father spares his son that serves
him, who in the duties Mal. 3. 17.
which he requires, respects his affection, more then the action, and the
intention and desire of his heart to please him, more then of his abilities in
performance; according to that of the Apostle; If there be first a willing 2.
Cor. 8. 12.
mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that
he has not. An example whereof we have in David, who having in his heart 2.
Sam. 7. 16.
a desire and resolution to build the Temple, though he did it not, was
accepted and rewarded of God, as if he had built it. And in Abraham, Genesis 22.
16.
whose resolution to sacrifice his son, was as pleasing in Gods sight, as if
he had been sacrificed. Now the reason why our desires and resolutions are so
acceptable unto God, is first, because they are the chief service of the
heart, which the Lord respects above all other parts and outward
performances. And secondly, because all our endeavors and actions are according
to our desires, either forward and fervent, or slack and remiss. For as
Philosophy teaches, the love and desire of attaining to the end, is the first
cause in the intention of the agent, which sets him on work, and according
to the greatness of this love and desire, to the end at which we aim, such
is our care and diligence in the use of all good means whereby we may attain
unto it. Moreover, as it will make our persons and actions accepted of God, so
our prayers which God has promised to hear and grant. According to that of
the Psalmist; Lord, thou Psalm. 10. 17.
have heard the desire of the humble; thou will prepare their heart, thou will
cause thine ear to hear. And again, He will fulfill the desire of them that
fear Psalm. 145. 9.
him, he will hear their cry, and will save them. And the Wiseman tells us,
that the desire of the righteous shall be granted, that is, not they who are
Pro. 10. 24.
righteous, according to the rigor of the Law, but they who are Euangelically
righteous, and desire and labor to attain unto it, as it is expounded in the
prayer of Nehemiah, O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive
Nehem. 1. 11.
to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to
fear thy name. And consequently, this being one of their most principal
desires, that they may be so freed from their corruptions and imperfections, as
that they may perform unto God that perfect obedience which the Law requires,
and their soul longs after; the Lord will satisfy it; and though for a time
they be turmoiled and humbled in the sight and sense of their corruptions, yet
by degrees he will bring them unto this perfect age in Christ, and to that
height of perfection which they so much desire, when as having put off, with
their mortality, all relikes of corruption, they shall be clothed with those
long white robes of perfect Apoc. 6. 11.
holiness in his heavenly Kingdom. Unto which happy estate in the mean time,
their longing and thirsting desires do give them full title and interest: for
they are blessed, not who are replenished with perfect righteousness, but who
hunger and thirst after it, as our Savior has Matthew. 5. 6.
taught us.

. Sect. 3 That our desires, resolutions, and endeavors must not be faint and
weak, but seruent and earnest.
But yet, that we may not in our carnal sloth and security deceive our selves
with shadows in stead of substances, we are to know, that not all kind of
desires, resolutions, and endeavors are acceptable unto God, nor make us to be
accepted of him, but those only which are sound and solid, sincere and upright;
unto which, diverse properties are required. First, that they be not faint and
weak, fickle and slight; but strong and vehement, earnest and fervent, like
the desires of women with child, which are even heart-sicke, unless they be
satisfied in the things which they long after, as David implies where he
says; Behold, I have longed after thy precepts, Psalm. 119. 40.
quicken me in thy righteousness. And again, My soul faints for thy
salvation, Verse. 81.
but I hope in thy Word, that is, thy promise, whereby thou have assured me
that thou will satisfy my desire. They must not be inferior to the desires of
worldlings, seeing the things desired are so much superior, exceeding them in
excellency, profit, and permanencie, as far as heaven exceeds earth. Now
we know that the desires of worldlings after their riches, pleasures, and
preferments, are so fervent and earnest, that they wholly take up their
thoughts in thinking of them, and their care in compassing them. Neither is
there any pains so great, or danger so desperate, which they will not venture
upon, but night and day, by sea and land, labor after that which their soul
loves. They must be like the desires of the Spouse in the Canticles, which
made her sick through their fervent Cant. 2. 5.
heat, and ready to swoune, had she not been stayed and refreshed with the
wine and apples of spiritual comforts. They must so enlarge our hearts, that
they will be ready to break, if they be not replenished and mollified with the
oil of Gods grace and holy Spirit, according to that of David, My soul
breaks for the longing that it has to thy judgments at all Psalm. 119. 20.
times. They must (as they are compared) resemble hunger and thirst, Matthew. 5.
6.
which make men sick till they be satisfied, and so resolute, that nothing
can withstand them, no difficulty or danger so great and desperate, which they
will not hazard themselves unto, that they may procure meat and drink to
preserve them from famishing; and with such care and diligence use all means
tending heereunto, as if they were religiously bound to do it by a solemn
oath; as we see in that desire and resolution of David; I have sworn, and will
perform it; that I will keep thy righteous judgments. Psalm. 119. 106.
And thus Job, to strengthen his desires and resolutions, in shunning sin,
and serving God, binds himself and all his members heereunto by solemn
covenant; I have (says he) made a covenant with mine eyes, why then Job 31. 1.
should I think upon a maiden?

. Sect. 4 They must be entire and total, both in respect of the subject and
object.
Secondly, these desires, resolutions, and endeavors, must be entire and
total, both in respect of the subject and object. For they must proceed from
the whole heart and will, so far forth as they are regenerate, and hold
place in all our actions and endeavors. Neither will God in his service accept
of a heart divided, whereof one part is given unto him, and another to the
world; nor of a double heart, one while aiming at his glory, and another while
at the glory of the world, sinister and earthly respects. Neither can we after
this sort serve God and Mammon, nor with an unsettled resolution, which now
inclines to Gods service, and soon Matthew. 6. 24.
after to the service of Satan, for the base wages of sinful profits and
pleasures; nor with such a lame endeavor, as makes us halt between gain and
godliness, Religion and worldliness, the praises of men, and the approbation
of God and a good conscience. But we ought with such firm resolution go out
of the Sodom of sin, that we must not cast a look backward, Luke 17. 32.
as relenting in our purpose, and seeming loath to leave it; and so set our
hearts and hands to the plow of Gods husbandry, that we never give it over,
till we bring forth plentiful fruits of holiness, that so after, we may
reap the harvest of heavenly happiness. In regard of the object Luke 9. 62.
also, they must be entire, and have respect unto all Gods Commandments,
desiring, Psalm. 119. 6.
resolving, and indeuouring to please God in all things, both in flying and
forsaking all manner of sin which he has forbidden, and embracing and
practicing whatsoever duties he has enjoined and commanded. So that it is not
enough, if with Herod we serve God in some things, and take liberty to serve
the devil, the world, and our own lusts in others; that we leave some sins
which are less pleasant or profitable, and retain others which bring more
profit or delight; nor that we embrace and practice some virtues and Christian
duties, which are more easy and less costly, and neglect others which are
more chargeable, and require greater pains and diligence. And when we are
commanded by God to slay all the cursed Canaanites and Amalekites of sinful
corruptions, we must not put some only to the sword, and keep others alive to
pay the tribute of pleasure or profit to our carnal lusts, neither kill and
mortify the leanest of this cursed cattle, which serve us for little or no
use, and let the fattest live, as best serving to feed our fleshly appetite:
but we must deuote them all unto God as an accursed thing, and desire and
resolve (as much as in us lies) not to leave any one alive to carry tidings to
the devil of the slaughter of the rest. Yea if there be an Agag which is more
potent and powerful in us then any other, we must take our first and chief
care how that may be subdued and killed; or such an Herodias and darling sin,
that our flesh more doteth on, then any other of our corruptions; we must with
most care and circumspection, yea with most hatred and detestation, in respect
of our part regenerate, put that farthest from us, as most hurting our
Christian growth, and hindering our proceedings in the ways of godliness.
According to the exhortation of the Apostle; Let Heb. 12. 1.
us lay aside every weight, and the sin that does so easily beset us, and let
us run with patience the race that is set before us. As on the other side,
the more difficulty we find in any holy duty, by reason of that auersenesse
which we feel in our corrupt nature unto it, the more vehement must our
desires, resolutions, and endeavors be to embrace and practice it; even as the
trauailer takes willingly most pains in going up the hill that lies in his
way homewards, and the Water-man imployeth the more strength and endeavor in
handling his Oars, when as he roweth against wind and tide, then when they
both favor and further him.

. Sect. 5 That our desires, resolutions, and endeavors, must aim at the means
as well as the end.
Thirdly, that our desires, resolutions, and endeavors may be sincere and
acceptable unto God, it is required, that we as well aim in them at the means
whereby they may be accomplished, as at the end, and take all occasions, and
use all helps, which may enable us to Gods service, and with like diligence
avoid all lets and impediments, whereby we might be hindered in it, as we
desire and endeavor to perform the service it self which God requires. For
where he inioyeth any duty, there he no less requires the means and
opportunities which enable us thereunto; and to think that we can perform the
duty, and neglect these helps, is to imagine that we can live long, and eat
no food, or come speedily to our iourneys end, and never travail in the way
that leads unto it. As therefore it was a vain wish of Balaam to die the
death of the righteous, when as he never took care to lead a righteous life:
so is it no less vain to desire, that we may lead the life of the righteous,
when we do not desire, resolve, and endeavor to use the means that enable us
to do it. And such are the desires and resolutions of those, who out of blind
devotion endeavor to lead a godly life, continuing in their ignorance, and
neglecting all good means, whereby they might come to the knowledge of Gods
will, and so conform their lives in obedience unto it; who thinking it enough
to have a good meaning, do tire themselves in their own superstition, and
spend all their labor in vain, offering unto God, in stead of his pure
service, which he has commanded, their own will worship, and humane
inventions and traditions, which he has so often in his Word forbidden and
condemned. But quite contrary was the course and carriage of holy David, in his
desire and resolution to lead a godly life: for as he longed, and had his
heart even broken with the vehemency of his desires, to keep Gods Satutes and
Laws; so with like earnestness he hungered and thirsted after the means
which might enable him unto it; which was, to come into Gods Courts, the
visible place of his presence, to hear his holy Word read and preached unto
him. As the Psalm. 42. 1, 2.
Heart (says he) pants after the water-brookes, so pants my soul after
thee, O God; my soul thirsts for God, for the living God: When shall I come
and appear before God? And again, O God, thou art my God, early will I seek
Psalm. 63. 1, 2.
thee, my soul thirsts for thee, my flesh longs for thee, in a dry and
thirsty land, where no water is, to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have
seen thee in the Sanctuary.

. Sect. 6 That they must not be lazy and idle, but diligent and painful.
Fourthly, our desires, resolutions, and endeavors to lead a godly life, must
not be lazy and luskish, idle and slothful; but exceeding industrious,
painful, and diligent in the use of all good means whereby we may attain
unto it. For being a Jewel of such price, we may not think to have it for the
bare wishing; but that we must compass it with some difficulty, and have our
cost and labor, in some proportion, answerable to this precious pearl, which
is much to be preferred before many worlds. And considering what cost and
pains worldly men willingly undergo in pursuing their earthly desires, out of
a bare, and (often) false hope to obtain them; with what industry and labor,
hazard and danger, the ambitious man aspireth unto honors, the covetous man
hunteth after riches, and the voluptuous man after pleasures; let us be sorry
and ashamed to think any pains or peril too much, in walking in the way of a
godly life, which shall assuredly be crowned with glory and immortality,
rewarded 1. Cor. 2. 9.
with heavenly treasures which will never fade, and with such everlasting
joys, as our eyes have not seen, nor our hearts conceived. The soul Pro. 13.
4.
of the sluggard (says Solomon) desires, and has nothing, but the soul of
the diligent shall be made fat. The which, as it is true in respect of earthly
riches, so also of spiritual grace and the treasures of holiness, the which
we may long idly wish, and yet never enjoy them; whereas if, as our desires be
earnest, so our endeavors diligent and laborious, we may have much more
assurance to be enriched with them, then to compass, with all our pains, our
worldly desires; seeing we have Gods promises more absolute for them. Neither
do they flee their followers as earthly riches do, which make themselves
wings, and fly away as the Eagle toward heaven, Pro. 23. 5.
deluding their hopes, which with most speed pursue them. Yea slothful
desires rather hurt, then help us in the ways of godliness, causing the
sluggard to rest in them, as sufficient without using any means to have them
satisfied. In which respect, the saying of Solomon is truly verified of them;
The desire of the slothful kills him, for his hands refuse to labor. For
Pro. 21. 25.
as his body must needs famish, who only wishes meat, but uses no endeavor
to satisfy his hunger; so his soul will soon be deprived of the spiritual
life of grace and godliness, who idly desires to be replenished with this
spiritual food, and takes no pains to attain unto it. The Kingdom of God
(says our Savior) suffers violence, and the violent Matthew. 11. 12.
take it by force. Neither shall they enter into it, who sit down idly, and
cry out, Lord, Lord, open unto us, that is, content themselves with a bare Mat.
7. 12, 13, 21
profession of Christianity, and labor not to do the will of our heavenly
Father, but they who strive to enter in at the straight gate, and take much
pains in travailing that narrow path of righteousness which leads to Gods
Kingdom.

. Sect. 7 That our desires, resolutions, and endeavors must not be by fits and
flashes, but constant and durable.
Lastly, our desires, resolutions, and endeavors, must not be by fits and
flashes, one while hot and earnest, and another while cold and remiss;
Perseuerandum est and assiduo studio robur addendum, donec bona men's sit quod
bona voluntas est. Sen. Epist. 16.
but constant and durable, like those in covetous men, which never cease, till
they be satisfied, or rather because they can never be satisfied whilst we
live on earth: therefore they must never cease, but the more we have of these
spiritual riches, the more earnestly we must desire and endeavor to have them
still increased. For this life is not the time of our perfection, and full age
in Christ, but of spiritual growth in grace, from strength to strength, and
from a lesser, to a greater measure of godliness and righteousness. We must
not, like those who are sick of an ague, be one while cold, and another while
hot, nor have a good day for Gods service, and an ill day for the service of
the devil and the world: for this were a sickness, and no spiritual health,
which would prepare us for death and destruction, and not for life and
happiness. Neither will God ever accept of it, who can no more endure to have
thus our time, then to have our hearts divided between him and his enemies.
But our souls (with David's) must Psalm. 119. 20, 33, 112.
break for the longing that they have unto Gods judgments at all times; we
must with him resolve to keep Gods statutes unto the end, and have our hearts
inclined to keep his statutes always. We must not, like the hypocrites, of
whom Hosea speaks, offer unto God a righteousness like unto the morning dew,
which vanishes when the Sun arises, but such as will endure the heat Hos.
6. 4.
of the day, like the streams that flow from a springing fountain. For the
waters of life which Christ does give, are never dry, but shall be in him that
has them, a well of water springing up to everlasting life. And the trees Ioh.
4. 14.
of righteousness, which are of Gods planting, are like those planted by the
Psalm. 1. 3.
rivers side, which are never barren, but bring forth their fruit in due
season; and they that be planted in the House of the Lord, shall like the Palm
Ps. 92. 12, 14.
tree perpetually flourish, and bring forth fruit in their old age, as the
Psalmist speaks.

CAP. V.
Of saving knowledge, which is the first main ground of a godly life: How
necessary it is, and the causes of it.

. Sect. 1 Of the maine grounds of a godly life.
Having explained the description of a godly life, and in part showed what is
required in him that is to lead it, and wherein it principally does consist;
we will now proceed, and more fully handle some main points, before briefly
touched, which are necessary to be known of him, who desires to make any
progress in the ways of godliness. And here two things come chiefly to be
considered. First, the grounds. And secondly, the parts of a godly life, which
contain the duties that are to be performed by those who lead it. The
grounds of this godly life, are certain fundamental virtues whereupon it is
built, and from which as living fountains, all other virtues and holy duties
do spring and flow. And these are principally two. First, saving knowledge of
God, his will and works. And secondly, a lively faith in Jesus Christ. From
which, two other maine graces arise, which as principal causes produce all
special duties of a godly life, namely, First, a sanctified heart purified by
faith. Act. 15. 9.
And secondly, a good conscience, which follows our justification.

. Sect. 2 That saving knowledge is the prime virtue, and mother grace, from
which all others have their beginning.
The first maine ground of a godly life, is saving knowledge, which is the
prime virtue, and mother grace, from which all others take their beginning. It
is the root of this tree of grace, from which, being effectual, lively, and
full of spiritual sap, faith springs (as it were) the main body of the
tree, and from it all other virtues and graces, like the boughs and branches,
and the profession and practice of Christianity in good works, and the duties
of godliness, like the leaves and fruits, do proceed and grow. For first, we
know God and his saving attributes, and then by faith we apprehend and believe
them. And when by an effectual knowledge we conceive, and by a lively faith
believe them, as that Jehovah who is our God, is infinite in all perfection;
omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and all-sufficient, most good and
gracious, most merciful and true, then do we trust in him, love him, and grow
zealous of his glory, obey and serve him, praise and rejoice in him, and in all
things submit our selves to his good pleasure. And so when we know and believe
the former attributes, joined with his justice and hatred of sin, they work
in our hearts the true fear of God, humility, and awful reverence; moving us
to honor and worship him in spirit and truth, to embrace and practice all
virtues and holy duties, because they are acceptable unto him, and to fly and
forsake all vice and wickedness, because they are odious in his sight. So that
saving knowledge, as the root, does comprize in it the life and sap of all
other graces, whereof it is, that in the Scriptures it is put for them all, and
comprehends in it alone, all Religion, and the duties of godliness. Thus the
Lord prohibiteth us to glory in our wisdom, strength, and riches; but let him
that glories, glory in this, that he Jer. 9. 24.
understands and knows me. And our Savior tells us, that This is life
eternal, to know God, and whom he has sent, Jesus Christ It is the maine
Ioh. 17. 3.
ground and cause of all true obedience, and therefore the Lord, before he
gives his Law which he would have kept and performed, prefixeth a Preface,
wherein he describes himself, that his people might know him: I am the Lord
thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and out of the house of
bondage. And David exhorting his son Solomon unto Gods service, does first
require, that he should know him. And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God
of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, 1. Chro. 28. 9.
and a willing mind. Neither will any do him cheerful service, till they
Heb. 11. 6.
know what a mighty and gracious Lord he is, and what bountiful wages, both of
temporal and eternal blessings, he gives unto those that faithfully serve
him. It comprizeth in it the sum of all Gods promises, concerning his gifts
temporal and spiritual, in the covenant of Grace. I will put my Law in their
inward parts, and write it in their hearts, etc. and Ier. 31. 33, 34.
they shall all know me, from the least of them, to the greatest of them, says
the Lord. It is the cause of all other virtues: for before we know them, we
cannot so much as desire them, as our Savior implies in his speech to the
woman of Samaria, If thou knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to
John 4. 10.
thee, Give me drink, thou would have asked of him, and he would have
given thee living water. More particularly, it is the cause of faith: for we
cannot come unto him, nor believe in God, till we know him, and what he Heb.
11. 6.
is. And affiance; for as the Psalmist says, They that know thy name, will put
Psalm. 9. 10.
their trust in thee; for thou, Lord, have not forsaken them that seek thee.
Of our love of God: for we must know how loving and lovely he is, before we can
love him; and as the Apostle says, We love God, because he loves us first.
And the usual speech is, There is no love of that, of which there 1. Ioh. 4.
19.
is no knowledge. To which purpose Augustine says, that we may love Ignoti
nulla cupido. Inuisa possumus cupere, incognita nequaquam. Romans 10. 15.
things unseen, but not unknown. Of our invocation and prayer: for how shall
they call upon him, in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe
in him, of whom they have not heard? It is the cause also of our conversion
unto God, and of turning to him from our sins, by true repentance. For the
first grace wrought in us by the Spirit, is illumination, whereby our minds
are enlightened with a sight of our misery, and our hearts inflamed with a
desire to come out of it. And to this purpose it is said, that the Apostle Paul
was sent unto the Gentiles, first, to open their Act. 26. 18.
eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light; and then to recover them,
from the power of Satan unto God, etc. In a word, by knowledge of God, we
attain unto all grace and peace requisite to life and godliness; according to
that of the Apostle, Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the 2.
Pet. 1. 2, 3.
knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord; according as his divine power has
given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the
knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue. So that grace and
glory, holiness and happiness, are derived unto us by this saving knowledge;
and that in such measure, as this knowledge is, unto which we have attained.
Here in this life our knowledge is but begun, and so with it our
sanctification and glory; and that being but in part, these are imperfect also;
but when we have this knowledge in perfection, we shall be perfect also in
righteousness and blessedness; and when the dim glass is removed, and we
see God face to face, and know as we are known, then shall we in his presence
1 Cor. 13. 12.
have fullness of joy, and pleasures at his right hand for evermore. To which
purpose, Psalm. 16. 11. 1. Ioh. 3. 2.
the Apostle also says; Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not
yet appear what we shall be; but we know, that when he shall appear, we shall
be like him, for we shall see him as he is.

. Sect. 3 That ignorance estrangeth us from God, and the life of grace and
glory.
Contrariwise, want of this knowledge, and ignorance of God, and his will,
makes us strangers from God and the Common wealth of Israel, and Ier. 31. 33,
34. Ioh. 10. 14, 4, 5.
howsoever we be the Church, yet to be no true members of the Church. For God
has promised to all that are in the Covenant of grace, that he will put his
Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and that they shall
all know him, from the least of them, to the greatest of them. And our Savior
says, that he knows all the sheep of his fold, and is known of them; and
that they know his voice, and are able to discern it from the voice of a
stranger. And as it makes us strangers from God, and the Covenant of grace, so
also from the life of God, or the godly life which he commands, as we see in
the example of the Gentiles, who, having their understanding darkened, were
alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that was in them, because
of the blindness of their heart. And contrariwise, thrusts us headlong into
all manner of sin; for as the Apostle says in the same place, When the
Gentiles, through their ignorance, were thus estranged from the life of God,
they became past feeling, and so gave themselves over to lasciuiousnes, Ephesians. 4.
18, 19.
to work all uncleanness with greediness. So Hosea, having set down a
Catalogue Hos. 4. 1, 6.
of many grievous sins, which made the Jews liable to Gods heavy judgments,
does after show, that the cause of all their sin and punishment was, because
they lacked the true knowledge of God in the land. Whereof it also is, that
sinners of all kinds, are included under the name of ignorant persons, who know
not God. So the Psalmist: Power out thy wrath upon Psalm. 79. 6. Ier 10. 25.
the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not
called upon thy name. And the Apostle says, that the Lord Jesus shall come
with 2. These. 1. 7, 8.
his mighty Angels in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them that know not
God. And therefore if we would have any portion in Gods saving graces, or part
in heavenly glory; if we would not be strangers from God, and aliants from his
Church; if we would perform any duty of a godly life, or not be carried
headlong into all wickedness, if we would not be subject to Gods judgments,
and fearful destruction, nor exposed to the imprecations of the faithful in
this life, nor to the vengeance of a terrible Judge, when Christ shall appear
at his second coming; let us not live in ignorance, but use all our endeavor
to attain unto the saving knowledge of God and his will. Neither let us with
ignorant people, content our selves with our own good meanings and blind
devotions, as our guides in godliness; for then our service of God will be but
will worship, and the carnal conceits of our own brains; and all our
Religion, being nothing else, but bodily exercise, and Esa. 1. 12. and 29. 13.
ignorant superstition, will be rejected of God, as odious and abominable.

. Sect. 4 That God is the chief Author and efficient cause of saving knowledge.
Seeing therefore knowledge is so necessary unto a godly life, we will a little
further insist upon it, showing what it is, and the nature and properties of
it, whereby we shall be the better able to labor after it in the use of all
good means, and know to our comforts, when we have attained unto it. Saving
knowledge then is a grace of God, wrought in us by his holy Spirit, which
inlighteneth our minds, to know those things which are revealed of God and his
will, by his Word and works, that we may make an holy use of it, for the
sanctifying of our hearts, and direction of our lives, in all duties of
holiness and righteousness. Whereby we may perceive, that not nature, but God
only is the Author and efficient cause of this knowledge, and so much only
do we know of God, as we are taught of God. According to that covenant of
grace, in which God promises, that he Ier. 31. 33, 34.
will put his Law in our inward parts, and write it in our hearts, and that we
shall know him from the least to the greatest. So our Savior speaking of his
Elect, says, that they all shall be taught of God. And again; No man knows
the Job. 6. 46.
Son but the Father, neither knows any man the Father but the Son, and he
unto whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Neither is this knowledge a
natural habit of the mind, but a grace of God, which is not purchased by us
or our own merits, or therefore bestowed upon us rather then others, because
God foresaw, that we would use it when we had it, better then they, but Gods
free gift promised in the covenant of grace. The which he works Joel 2. 28.
in us first, by sending his Son, his true essential wisdom, who has
revealed unto us his Fathers will, and being the great Prophet of the Church,
has made known unto us the counsels of God, and all things necessary for our
Salvation; and that not only, nor chiefly, to the wise of the world, but to
the weak and simple; according to that of our Savior; I thank thee, O
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou have hid these Matthew. 11. 25.
things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes. And
secondly, his holy Spirit, who was and is sent from the Father and Son, to
teach and lead us into all truth, as our Savior promised his Apostles. And
this is that holy anointing, of which the Apostle speaks, whereby we Job.
16. 13.
know all things, and need not that any teach us, but as this anointing
teaches us of all things. And that Collyrium, or precious eye-salue, which
Christ Apoc. 3. 18.
promises to give to the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans, to inlighten
their blind eyes in the knowledge of the truth. So the Apostle tells us, that
we cannot see nor conceive the things which appertain to Gods Kingdom, but
God has revealed them unto us, by his Spirit, for the 1. Cor. 2. 10.
Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. And hence it is,
that he is called the Spirit of wisdom, revelation and illumination, and the
Ephe. 1. 17. John 16. 13.
Spirit of truth, because he is both light and truth himself, and also
inlighteneth our minds which are naturally full of darkness, and leads us
into all truth needful for our salvation. And therefore if we would have this
saving knowledge, we must go to the chief Fountain and Author of it, and
pray often and earnestly that he will for his Son, and by his holy Spirit
take away our natural blindness, and open our eyes, that we may see the
wonderful things of his Law. Psalm. 119. 8.


. Sect. 5 Of the isntrumental causes of saving knowledge.
The isntrumental causes of this knowledge, are first, the Book of nature:
secondly, the Book of Grace. The Book of nature; for even this light being
sanctified by Gods Spirit, is helpefull to the regenerate for the revealing of
God and his will unto them. And that both the eternal book of nature, which
is the conscience, and the external Book, which is the great volume of the
creatures. For if there be in all men some relics of the light of nature
shining in their consciences, which convince them that there is a God, and that
this God is most good, powerful, just, bountiful, a liberal rewarder of
good, and revenger of evil, according to the saying of the Apostle; That which
may be known of God, is manifest in them: for God has showed it unto them;
then how much more clearly does this light Romans 1. 19.
shine in the faithful, when as it is renewed and made much brighter and
clearer by Gods holy Spirit? The Book also of the creatures does convince all
men that there is a God, and that he is infinite in wisdom and power,
omnipresent and full of goodness; according to that of the Apostle; The
invisible things of him from the creation of the world, are clearly seen,
Romans 1. 20.
being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
Godhead, so that they are without excuse. And therefore how much more may the
faithful profit by learning and reading this Book, who have the holy Spirit
for their Tutor, which opens their eyes, that they may see Gods wisdom,
goodness and power shining in them; and their hearts, that meditating on them,
they may make an holy use of this knowledge, for the stirring of them up to
render unto God praise and thanksgiving? The Book of grace also is either the
internal writing of Gods Law and will, in the heart and inward parts, by the
Spirit of God, which the Lord promises to do in the covenant of grace; or the
outward Book of the Ier. 31. 34.
holy Scriptures, in which are contained all things necessary to be known of
God and his will, for the salvation of our souls. And lastly, Gods Ministers
are his instruments whereby he reuealeth himself and his will unto us; who do
expound unto us his written Word, and unfold the mysteries and difficulties
thereof that we may understand them. And therefore if we would attain unto the
knowledge of God and his will, we are to use the help of those instruments
which he has ordained for this purpose; especially we are to desire that
inward writing of the Spirit in our hearts, and to make use, by reading, and
meditation, of the Scriptures, and by often hearing of them expounded and
applied unto us by Gods faithful Ministers.

CAP. VI.
Of the object of saving knowledge, namely, God himself and his attributes,
his Word and works.

. Sect. 1 That there is a God, and how we may know it.
ANd these are the causes of saving knowledge. The object of it is God, his
will and works. Where first we are to know, that there is a God, who is to be
worshipped and served of us. Unto which we attain by the light of nature,
which reuealeth this principle unto us, and conuinceth all men of this truth,
by the Book of the creatures, in which the infinite wisdom, power and
goodness of the Creator shines; by the terrors of conscience following the
commission of heinous sins though never so secret; by the series and
dependancy of causes one upon another, in the disquisition whereof there is no
end, till we come to the cause of causes, who having his being of himself,
gives being unto all things; by the goodly order which may be observed in the
creatures, and the motion of the heavens and the celestial bodies; by the
final causes, one thing being referred to another, till we come to the summum
benum and supreme end of all things, which is God; by the accomplishment of
Prophecies foretold long before their events; by the consent of all Nations, in
acknowledging this principle; and finally, by the judgments and punishments
executed upon the wicked, even in this life: by all which we come to the clear
understanding of this truth, that there is a God; although in truth it is so
evident in it self, that no argument can be brought to illustrate it, seeing
nothing is so clear and manifest.

. Sect. 2 Who this God is, and how he may be described.
Secondly, we are to know what this God is, or rather who he is; For what he is
in his own essence, he has not revealed in the Scriptures, neither are we
capeable of this knowledge, nor any other creature, seeing he is infinite and
we finite. But who he is, he has made known in his Word; namely, that he is
Jehovah Elohim, a Spirit infinite in all perfection, one in nature, and three
in persons, the Father, Son and holy Ghost. By which description it
appears, that God is primum ens, and the first being, who has his essence of
himself, and gives being to all things, as his name Jehovah signifies; that
he is uncreated, and a Spirit, as our Savior, John 4. 23.
the wisdom of the Father, has made him known unto us, not so much thereby
showing his essence what he is, which is ineffable and incomprehensible, as
distinguishing him from all corporeal substances. That he is but one, because
he is infinite in all perfection, wisdom, power, presence and the rest: and
it is against the nature of infiniteness to be more then one; because he
made and governs all as supreme Monarch, in which Monarchy there can be no
copartners; and because he is the cause of causes, from which all things have
their being, and upon which they wholly depend.

. Sect. 3 Of Gods attributes, and how they are ascribed unto God.
Thirdly, we must know, that this divine essence is infinite in all perfection.
The which perfection is seen in his properties, which are not properly in God,
who is all essence and no qualities: for whatsoever is in God, is God, but
according to the capacity of our shallow understanding: neither do they differ
from his essence, nor one from another; for God is one, and of a most simple
nature, admitting no division into parts, faculties or properties, nor yet any
essential distinction, but only in our comprehension or manner of
understanding. So as we must not take his properties to be any parts of his
essence, seeing every essential property is his whole essence, and therefore
howsoever distinguished in respect of his diverse manner of working toward the
creatures, yet not in themselves, but are inseparable one from another. In
which respect, the wisdom of God, is the wise God; the power of God, the
powerful God; and so in the rest. And his wisdom, power, mercy, goodness,
justice, truth, are all one in their essence, there being in God but one most
simple and pure act, unto which, diverse names are given in the Scriptures, to
show unto us how it is diversely exercised toward the creatures.

. Sect. 4 Of Gods primary attributes, and how they may be described.
Now these Attributes are of two sorts. First, primary: Secondly, secondary.
Primary, are those which declare unto us the essence of God, as he is
absolutely in himself, of which there being no similitude in the creatures,
they are attributed unto God alone, without communication to any other. And in
this number are Gods Simplicity, Infiniteness, Eternity, Immensity,
Immutability, and Omnipresence, all sufficiency, and omnipotency. His
simplicity is an essential attribute, by which is signified that Exodus 33. 20.
the divine essence is undivided and absolute, without composition, parts or
accidents, invisible, impassible, and all essence, so that whatsoever is in
God, is God. His Infiniteness is, whereby is signified, that he is in his
essence uncircumcised, and above all measure of time, place or any thing
else, but simply immense and incomprehensible. The Eternity of God is Psalm.
102. 27, 28. Apoc. 1. 8. Esaias. 44. 6.
an essential attribute, which signifies that he is infinite and
uncircumcised by time, first and last, without beginning or ending, absolute
without succession, wholly all, always and at once. His immensity is an
essential Psalm. 139. 7. and 145. 3. Ier. 23. 23. 1. King. 8. 27.
attribute, whereby is signified, that the divine essence is without dimension
and circumscription of place, wholly every where present, within the world, and
without the world, containing all things, and being contained of nothing. His
Immutability is an essential property, whereby is signified, that the divine
nature being infinite, absolute, most simple Mat. 3. 6. Iam. 1. 17. Psalm. 102.
28.
and perfect, is subject to no change of generation, corruption, augmentation,
or diminution, passion or alteration, but ever remains one and the same. His
all-sufficiencie is an essential property of the divine essence, whereby is
signified, that in himself alone he is most perfect and absolute, and in all
things sufficient, both for himself and for all creatures. Finally, Genesis 17.
1. Mat. 15. 48. Job 42. 1. Mat. 19. 26.
his Omnipotency is an essential property of Gods nature, whereby is signified
his infinite and transcendent power, whereby he is able to do all things which
are not repugnant to his nature and will.

. Sect. 5 Of Gods secondary attributes, and how they differ from those shadows
of them which are in the creatures.
The secondary attributes of God, are those which are spoken of God in a
secondary relation, as he is the first and the chief Agent working in the
creatures, especially man, some similitudes and resemblances of his own
essential attributes, which are therefore (though improperly) called
communicable, in respect of some analogy and likeness that they have with the
properties which are in the creatures. For there is no perfection or good thing
in them to be desired, of which the Idea and arch-type is not in God most
absolute, infinite and eternal. But as they are essential properties of Gods
nature, they cannot be communicated to any creature, seeing they are most
simple and indivisible, but only (as it were) some shows and shadows of them;
which in many respects differ from those attributes which are in God; for in
him they are his essence, and by it he lives, understands, and is good,
gracious and just: but in the creatures they are qualities, and bare
properties. In him they are all most perfect, infinite, absolute, and most
excellent, immutable and eternal; in which regard he may be said, not only to
be wise, just, good and blessed, but wisdom, justice, goodness and
blessedness it self. So that these secondary attributes in God, being his
nature and essence, are to be understood by the primary, as by their rule and
measure, and therefore are to be attributed unto him, most perfectly, simply,
infinitely and absolutely: But in the creatures, the qualities which are some
similitudes of these attributes, are mixed, imperfect, finite and mutable. In
God all and every his attributes being his essence, they can be but one, as his
essence is one, simple and indivisible, so that by the same essence whereby he
is wise, he is also true, and that, by which he is good, he is also just,
merciful, and blessed: But in the creatures their properties are diverse, and
differ from one another in their forms and operations. For by one faculty a
man is wise, and wills by another, and his qualities of justice, mercy,
goodness, truth, are different properties one from another.

. Sect. 6 What Gods secondary attributes are, and how they may be described.
Now, these secondary attributes of God, though they be all but one in him, yet
in our comprehension and conceit, who can only judge of them according to their
several kinds of working toward the creatures, they are manifold, as Gods
life, and immortality; his wisdom, truth, will, goodness, holiness,
beneficence, love, grace, mercy, clemency, long suffering, patience, his
justice, anger and hatred; all which are needful to be known of every
Christian, not only that we may take notice of Gods actions and operations
toward us, but also may accordingly frame our actions and lives, that so being
agreeable to his pure and holy nature, they may be acceptable in his sight. And
therefore I thought it necessary to describe them briefly and severally,
referring the Reader, who desires to have them fully handled, to such
Treatises as purposely entreat of this argument. Deuteronomy. 32. 40. John 1. 4. Acts
17. 28.
The life of God is an essential attribute: whereby is signified, that the
divine nature lives, works and moves in himself, and gives unto all
things life and motion. Exodus 3. 14. 1. Tim. 6. 16. and 1. 17.
The immortality of God is his essential property: whereby is signified that
he lives eternally, and never dies, but has, does and shall for ever live,
work and move himself, and give life, action and motion to all things that
have life and motion. Job 42. 2. Heb. 4. 13.
The wisdom of God is his essential property: whereby is signified, that God
truly and perfectly with one eternal act of understanding, at once does know
himself and all things; and that not only externally, but also internally in
their essence; not successively by discourse of reason, but at once most
distinctly and clearly. Of which wisdom there are two parts. First, his Romans
8. 29. 1. Pet. 1. 2.
prescience, whereby he has from all eternity, seen and known all things
which are, have been, or shall be, with infallible knowledge, as being all
present to him, though past or to come, in respect of us. Secondly, Pro. 8. 14.
and 16. 4. Acts 2. 23.
his counsel, whereby he resolves to rule and govern all things in the best
and most wise manner, for the setting forth of his own glory. The John 17. 3.
Romans 3. 4.
truth of God, is his essential attribute, whereby he is made known unto us,
to be in himself most true in all his words and works, yea, truth it self, and
the Author of all truth which is in the creatures. The Romans 9. 18. Ephesians. 1. 11.
God, is his essential attribute, whereby is signified, that God with one will
of most free and just act, wills all things, approving or disapprouing
whatsoever he knows. The Mark 10. 18. Iam. 1. 17. Psalm. 145. 7.
goodness of God, is his essential property, whereby is signified, that he is
infinitely good in and of himself, and the Author of all good, in and toward
all the creatures. The Exodus 15. 11. Leuit. 19. 2. Psalm. 145.
holiness of God, is his essential attribute, whereby is signified, that his
nature is wholly and most perfectly just, infinite in all virtue, justice,
truth, mercy and purity, free from all vice, iniquity, and spot of any
corruption, and therefore a lover of all purity and sanctity in the creatures,
and a hater of all vice and impurity, as being contrary to his most holy
nature. Mat. 5. 45. Psalm. 145. 8, 9.
The beneficence of God, is his essential attribute, whereby he is known to
be in himself the fountain of all bounty, and infinitely and absolutely good
to the creatures, toward whom he exercises freely his beneficence and
goodness. 1. John 4. 8, 16. John 3. 35, 16. Romans 5. 8, 10.
The love of God, is his essential attribute, whereby is signified, that he
loves himself chiefly, as being the chief goodness, and the creatures as
they are good, freely approving, rewarding and delighting in them, and willing
and performing all good unto them. The Exodus 34. 6. Psalm. 86. 15. Romans 11. 6.
grace of God, is his essential property, whereby he is known to be in
himself infinite in grace, and extends his favor and benignity freely unto
his creatures. The Exodus 34. 6. Iud. 10. 16. Micah 7. 18.
mercy of God, is his essential property, whereby he is known to be most
pitiful in himself, and in his own nature delights to help them that are
in misery. The Exodus 34. 7. Ezrah 18. 23. and 33. 11.
clemency of God, is his essential attribute, whereby is signified, that he is
in his nature most gentle, and benign toward his creatures, in anger
remembering mercy, and graciously pardoning us when we deserve punishment,
willing rather the conversion then the death of sinners. The Esa. 30. 18. Romans
2. 4.
long-suffering and patience of God, is his essential property, whereby is
noted, that he is patient in bearing with sinners, expecting their repentance,
that he may have mercy upon them. The Psalm. 48. 11. and 145. 17. Romans 1. 17.
Justice of God, is his essential attribute, whereby he is known to be
infinitely just in himself, and exercises Justice toward the creatures,
being also the Author of all righteousness which is in them. The John 3. 36.
Romans 1. 18.
anger of God signifies, his just and free will in punishing sin, and all
injury offered against himself, or his Church and people. The Psalm. 5. 4. and
44. 8.
hatred of God, signifies his just will, whereby he disalloweth, detesteth,
and decrees to punish evil and sin in his creatures.

. Sect. 7 Of the persons in Trinity.
And so much concerning Gods attributes, whereby his nature is made known unto
us, that we may accordingly serve him, and so carry our selves, as that we may
be acceptable in his sight. Now further we must know him in his persons,
namely, that howsoever he is but one in nature and essence, yet he is
distinguished into three persons, the Father, Son and holy Ghost. For the
better understanding whereof, we are to know, that a person in the deity is a
subsistence in the divine essence, comprehending the whole divine nature and
essence in it, but distinguished by an incommunicable property from other
persons, unto which it has relation. Matthew. 3. 16, 17. and 28. 19. Ioh 14. 16.
1. Ioh. 5. 7.
Or it is the Godhead restrained or distinguished by his personal property.
And therefore every person, containing in it the whole divine essence, it
follows, that whatsoever agrees absolutely to, or is spoken of the whole
divine nature, in respect of its outward actions and works toward the
creatures, does alike agree to every distinct person, and whatsoever agrees
to, or is spoken of every of the persons, that likewise agrees to the whole
divine nature. And from hence also it follows, that these three divine
persons, are in glory and all other attributes coequall, and in respect of time
coeternal; but yet every one is distinct from other, by their personal
property. So that the divine nature being considered with the personal
property of begetting, is the Father, and not the Son, nor holy Spirit; being
considered with the personal property of being begotten, is the Son, and not
the holy Ghost nor Father; and with the personal property of proceeding, is
the holy Spirit, and neither the Father nor the Son. The Father then is the
first person in Trinity, who having his being of himself, has communicated
his whole essence unto the Son, and so has begotten him by eternal
generation. The Son is the second person in Trinity, who is begotten of the
Father. The holy Spirit is the third person in the Trinity, proceeding from the
Father and the Son, who is therefore called the Spirit, because he
proceeds, and (as it were) is breathed from them both; and the holy Spirit,
because he does immediately sanctify the elect, and make them holy, and the
Father and Son do it mediately by him.

. Sect. 8 Of the knowledge of Gods works, and first of his decree.
And thus have we briefly spoken of the knowledge of God, in respect of his
nature and persons: now with like or more breuity, we are to entreat of the
knowledge of God, in, and by his works and actions. The which are either
internal, as the actions of the divine persons one toward another; or
external, which are his operations and works toward the creatures. And these
are principally two. First, the decree of God. And secondly, the execution of
his decree. The decree of God is an act of the divine will, whereby he has
from all eternity purposed, that all should be done, which is, has been, or
shall be done, ordaining all things to a good end, and the means also, with
all circumstances, whereby they attain unto it. And this is either common to
all, or special to the reasonable creatures, as Angels and men. Gods decree,
which respects men and Angels, is called predestination, which is Gods
eternal purpose, whereby he has ordained the reasonable creatures to
certain ends, and to the means which conduce unto them. Of which, there are
two parts, election, and reprobation. Election is Gods eternal decree, whereby
of his free grace, he has purposed in Christ, to bring some to everlasting
life, and to the use of the means, whereby they may attain unto it, to the
praise of the glory of his grace. Reprobation is Gods eternal decree, whereby
he has purposed in his election to pass by some men, and to leave them in
their sins, that they may justly be condemned, to the praise of the glory of
his justice.

. Sect. 9 Of the execution of Gods decree in man's creation, fall, and misery.
The execution of Gods decree, is an action or work of God, whereby in time,
he brings to pass all that he has eternally decreed, according to the
counsel of his will. The which is either temporary or eternal. Gods temporary
decree is general or special. The general, is either the creation of all
things of nothing, or the gubernation of them, being made by his providence.
The special execution of his decree, respects either Angels or men. To say
here nothing of Angels, we are to know, that God having created the earth of
nothing, did make man of the earth, in respect of his body, and breathing into
him the breath of life, did create him a living soul; that man was created
according to Gods own image, in wisdom, holiness, and righteousness, made
Lord of all the creatures, and happy in the vision and fruition of God and his
favor, and of the joys and pleasures of Paradise. That being created good,
and yet but mutable, God left him to the freedom of his will, and to be
tempted of the devil. Unto which tentation when he had yielded, by
transgressing Gods commandment, in eating of the forbidden fruit, he fell from
this estate of happiness, into the state of sin, misery, and death. The
which sin is imputed unto us who sinned in his loins, he being no private
person, but the root of mankind; and the corruption of his nature, derived
unto all his posterity by natural propagation, the which we call original
sin, whereby Gods image is defaced in us, and we disabled unto all good, and
made prone unto all evil. From which original corruption, which is the
fountain of all maliciousness, have sprung the cursed streams of actual
transgressions, whereby we have broken Gods whole Law, and every commandment
of it, in thought, word, and deed, both by omitting the duties which are
commanded, and committing the sins which are forbidden. Whereby we have made
our selves subject to the curse of the Law, and all the plagues and punishments
therein threatened, both temporal and eternal; out of which miserable estate
and condition, it was altogether impossible to recover by our own means, or
the help of any, or all the creatures.

. Sect. 10 Of our recovery out of our misery.
And this was the execution of Gods decree, in respect of man's creation, fall,
and misery. Unto which, we must adioyne the knowledge of our recovery out of
this wretched condition. To which purpose we must know, that when we were thus
deeply plunged into this state of death and condemnation; and in respect of
our selves, or any means of our own, hopeless, and helpelesse, for our
recovery, it pleased the Lord, of his mere grace and free mercy, to send his
Son into the world, to take our nature upon him, and therein to work that
great work of our redemption. The which he did perfectly perform, both by
his merits and efficacy. The former he did by satisfying Gods justice, both
by his active obedience, in fulfilling the Law for us, and by his passive
obedience, in suffering death in his body, and the anger of God in his soul.
The which is a sufficient price of redemption for all that do apply it,
because he that did this for us, was God and man. And so as his humane nature
made him capeable of these sufferings, so the divine nature, which was the
Altar upon which this sacrifice was offered, sanctified the gift, and gave unto
it infinite value and dignity, so as it became a sufficient and fit
satisfaction for sin. For as sin being nothing in it self but a privation,
became of infinite guilt, in respect of the infinite Majesty of God, offended
by it; so the sufferings of Christ's humane nature, though temporary, became of
infinite value, in respect of the dignity of the person who suffered, being God
and man. And as thus Christ saved us by his merits, so also by his efficacy,
applying the virtue of his merits unto us by his Spirit and Word; which
begetting in us a lively faith, that brings forth the fruits of unfeigned
repentance, we perform thereby the Covenant of grace, and so are made
partakers of Christ and all his benefits, which are therein promised. For in
the preaching of the Gospel, this covenant is proclaimed, and we are
effectually called to the knowledge and participation thereof, God giving
Christ unto us to be our Savior, and us to Christ to be saved by him, yea,
uniting us unto him in one mystical body, whereof he is the Head, and we his
members, by virtue whereof, as we are partakers of him, so have we also right
and interest unto all his benefits. Of which union, the chief bond on Gods
part, is his holy Spirit, and on our part, a lively and justifying faith; which
is wrought in us by the preaching of the Gospel, made effectual by the inward
operation of the Spirit of God, and confirmed and increased by the use of the
Sacraments, which are the seals annexed to the Covenant, to assure us that God
will not fail to perform all his promises. And these things are the object of
our saving knowledge, or the maine points which we are to know unto salvation,
and to enable us to walk in the way of a godly life that leads unto it. The
which I would not here have touched, were not this knowledge necessary
heereunto; or would have handled them more fully and exactly, but that I
feared, that they would cause this Treatise too much to swell, and far to
exceed the limits which I have proposed unto it; and also considered that there
are already published many Catechismes and sums of Divinity, in which, all
men at their pleasure may find these, and many other the like points of our
Christian Religion thoroughly discussed.

CAP. VII.
Of the quantity and quality of saving knowledge, and how necessary it is to a
godly life.

. Sect. 1 Of the quantity of knowledge, and the diverse degrees of it.
THe next point to be considered in our knowledge, is the quantity and measure
of it; the which is imperfect in the greatest perfection which in this life can
be attained. For as the Apostle (though he had received abundance of the
Spirit, and such revelations as were not lawful to be uttered) confessed of
himself, together with others, We know but in part; and see 1. Cor. 13. 9, 12.
and 8. 2.
through a glass darkely; and if any man think that he knows any thing
(namely in perfection) he knows nothing as he ought to know. For, we 2. Cor.
5. 7. Heb. 11. 1.
walk by faith, and not by sight. And, faith is of things unseen, and not in
vision and fruition. Neither can we attain to perfect knowledge, until we
attain unto perfect happiness, which is not in this life, but the life to
come, when we shall see God face to face, and shall know as we are known; not
by the knowledge of faith, which is but by hearing, signs, semblances, and
revelations; but of vision, fruition, and most firm experience. For the
perfection of our knowledge here, consists most in the knowledge and
acknowledgment of our imperfection, and not in the high degree of quantity,
but in the sincerity and truth. The which knowledge discovers our ignorance,
that we may bewail it, and causes us (not in pride and self-conceit, to
content our selves with that we have, but seeing our imperfections) to labor
in the use of all good means, after a greater measure, till by attaining to
one degree after another, we do in the end obtain, with perfection of
knowledge, perfect happiness. But yet in this imperfect knowledge there are
diverse degrees, which accordingly are diversely required, that they may be
acceptable unto God, and sufficient for us and our salvation. First, in respect
of the diverse times of illumination, for in the twy-light of the Law, when as
the Sun was not yet risen, there was not so great a measure of knowledge
required, as in the broad day of the Gospel, when as God requires some
proportion between our sight of knowledge, and the light of his truth shining
unto us. Otherwise we can have no assurance that we are in the number of his
Church, and of those Esa. 11. 9. Ier. 31. 34. Joel. 2. 28.
with whom the Covenant of grace is made, unless the Prophecies foretold of
such, be verified in us, and among the rest, that we, who are taught by his
Son and Spirit, shall know God and his will in far greater perfection, then
they did which were under the Pedagogie of the Law. So in respect of the
means, God requires a greater measure, according to their greatness;
expecting much, where he has given much; as more of those where the Gospel is
freely and openly preached, then of those, who living in times of persecution,
have it only by stealth, and with many difficulties and dangers. And in a
flourishing Church (such as ours is) he requires the greatest measure, where
he has planted the most faithful Ministry. And therefore in this clear
light of the Gospel, and liberal means which God allows us, we are to
labor after a like measure of knowledge, as the Apostle exhorts the
Colossians, Let the Word of Christ Col. 3. 16.
dwell in you richly, in all wisdom: to which end, we must not cease to pray
for our selves as the Apostle for them, that we may be filled with the
knowledge Col. 1. 9.
of Gods will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. Finally, that our
knowledge may be acceptable, there is a diverse measure required, in respect of
diverse callings. As that the Ministers must exceed the people, seeing they are
appointed their teachers and guides, and the Priests lips Mal. 2. 7.
must preserve knowledge, that the people may seek the Law at their mouth.
That the rich exceed the poor, because they have more leisure, liberty, and
opportunity to use the means; that the husband exceed the wife, and the father
the children, because they are bound by their places to teach and instruct
them. And finally, that they who have been long Scholars in Christ's School,
do excel those who are nouices, and but newly admitted, for want of which
proficiencie, the Hebrews are sharply reproved by Heb. 5. 12.
the Apostle. But yet we are to know, that in all true members of the Church,
who are of age and capacity, it is required, that they understand the maine
principles of Christian Religion, which are contained in ordinary Catechismes,
that they may be able to render an account of their 1. Pet. 3. 15. 1. These. 5.
21. 1. Ioh. 4. 1. Act. 17. 11.
faith to those that ask them; to instruct those who are under their
government, and to know and discern the voice of Christ from the voice of a
stranger, to try the spirits whether they be of God or no, and not hand over
head receive whatsoever is delivered by those who are in the habit and place of
a Minister, but to discern, at least, in maine points necessary to salvation,
the sound doctrines of their faithful teachers, from the errors and untruths
of false seducers.

. Sect. 2 Of the quality of our knowledge, that must be effectual.
The last thing required in our knowledge, respects the quality of it, that
it be sanctifying effectual, and saving knowledge. Neither does every kind of
knowledge make us and our lives acceptable unto God; for 1. Tim. 1. 4. and 6.
20.
there is a false knowledge, consisting in vain speculations, fables, quirkes,
and conceits of wit, endless and vselesse genealogies, which minister
questions, rather then edifying which is in faith, and making men rather more
proud and contentious, then more holy and religious, which is odious unto God.
And there is a litterall or speculatiue knowledge swimming in the brain, which
not being effectual for the sanctifying of the 1. Cor. 13. 2. and 8. 1.
heart, and amendment of the life, does not profit, but rather hurt those that
have it, pussing them up with pride, and making them disdain those that want
it. The which, as it increases their sin, because it is committed against
knowledge and conscience, and leaves men without excuse, so does it make their
punishment more grievous, and their condemnation more intolerable; for the
servant that knows his masters will and does Luk 12. 47.
it not, shall be beaten with many stripes; and it shall be more easy for
Sodom Mat. 11. 21, 22. John 9. 41.
and Gomorrah at the day of Judgment, then for Corazin and Bethsaida, because,
hearing Christ's Word, and seeing his works, they repented not. This knowledge,
though it be true in respect of the object, which is the Word and truth of God,
yet is it vain in regard of the effect, being ineffectual to a godly life,
and to the assuring us of life eternal; in which, when we excel never so
much, yet shall we come short of many wicked men, who are in the state of
death and condemnation, yea of the devils themselves, who in theory and
speculation know more then we. Yea, in truth such knowledge is no better then
ignorance in Gods estimate, seeing we know only so much in Christianity as we
bring into use and practice, according to that of the Apostle; Hereby we do
know that we know God, if we keep his Commandments; he that says, I know
him, and keeps not 1. Job. 2. 3.
his Commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. And again,
Whosoever abides in him, sins not; whosoever sins (that is, in
whomsoever 1. Job. 3. 6.
sin rules and reigns) has not seen him, neither known him.

. Sect. 3 That saving knowledge is necessary to a godly life.
And therefore if we would be accepted of God, and have our lives and ways
pleasing in his sight, we must not content our selves with such a Stude non vt
plus alijs scias, sed vt melius, Seneca. Tit. 1. 16. 1. Tim 4. 8. Ioh. 4. 24.
Psalm. 16. 8. Genesis 5. 24. Genesis 17. 1.
knowledge as swims in the brain, but labor after such a saving and
effectual knowledge, to be the guide of all our works and actions, which
makes use of all we know, for the sanctifying of our hearts and affections,
and the reforming of our lives and conuersations. For example, knowing that
there is a God, we must worship and serve him, and professing him with our
lips, we must not deny him in our lives. Knowing that he is a Spirit, we must
not rest in bodily exercise, which profits nothing, but worship him in spirit
and truth. Knowing that he is infinite and omnipresent, we must with Enoch
walk with God, and in all things carry our selves, as before him. Knowing that
he is all-sufficient, we must trust in him for all things, both in the presence
and absence of inferior means. Knowing that he is omniscient and the searcher
of our inward parts, we must approve our hearts as well as our works unto
him, and make conscience of committing secret sins, as well as those which
are open and manifest to the world. Knowing that he is omnipotent, we must
depend upon him for preservation from all evil, and defense against all
enemies; and that in greatest difficulties and dangers, because things, even
impossible to men, are possible with God. Knowing that he is the chief Good,
we must love him above all things; knowing that he is true, yea truth it self,
we must believe his Word and promises. Knowing that he is just, we must fear
to offend him; that he is merciful, we must hope in him; that he is
bountiful, we must do cheerful service to so gracious a Master. Knowing that
he is but one God, we must worship him alone, and not false gods and graven
Images, and set up no Idols in our hearts, as the earthly Mammon with the
covetous, worldly honors and vain glory with the ambitious, and carnal and
sinful pleasures, with those that are voluptuous. Finally, knowing that he is
one in essence, and three in persons, we must worship the Unity in Trinity.
Mat. 1. 6.
Knowing that God the Father, is our Father in Christ, we must reverence, 1.
Pet. 1. 17. Luke 1. 74.
fear and love him; that God the Son is our Redeemer, we must worship and
serve him, in holiness and righteousness, before him, all the days of our
lives; and knowing that the holy Ghost is our Sanctifier, 1. These. 4. 4. 1.
Cor. 6. 19.
and dwells in us, we must possess our vessels in purity and honor, that
we may be fit temples and habitations for this holy Ghest, etc.

. Sect. 4 Of the means of saving knowledge.
And this is that saving knowledge which is necessary to a godly life; the
which we have not of our selves; for every man is Ier. 10. 14.
beast in his own knowledge, Ier. 4. 22. 1. Cor. 2. 14.
wise unto evil, and unto any good without understanding; but it is a grace
and free gift of God, as before we have showed. And therefore if we would
obtain it, we must carefully and conscionably use all good means which he
has appointed for this purpose. And first we must beg this grace of God by
fervent and effectual prayer, according to that of the Apostle James, Iam. 1.
5.
If any man want wisdom, let him ask it of God, that gives all men
liberally, and vpbraideth not: and it shall be given him; as we see in the
example of 1. King. 3. 6.
Solomon: and desire him to send his holy Spirit into our hearts, which will
John 16. 13.
lead us into all truth, and like a Apoc. 3. 18.
precious eye-salue, will open and illighten the blind Psalm. 119. 18, 27.
eyes of our understandings; that we may see the wonders of Gods Law. The which
our prayer will be more effectual to prevail with God, if we crave this
knowledge to this end, that we may glorify him by it, according to that of
David, Make me Psalm. 119. 27.
to understand the way of thy precepts, so shall I talk of thy wondrous
works; and make our knowledge the rule of our lives, practicing the things we
know in the whole course of our conversation, to which end David beggeth it of
God: Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I shall keep it Verse. 33.
34.
unto the end; Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law, yea, I will
observe it with my whole heart. Secondly, let us be diligent in hearing,
reading and meditating of Gods Word, which gives Psalm. 19. 7, 8. and 119. 130.
Pro. 1. 3, 4, 5.
light and understanding unto the simple, and is sufficient to make us 2. Tim.
3. 15, 16, 17.
wise in all things unto salvation; and to make the man of God perfect and
thoroughly furnished unto all good works. Thirdly, we must use holy conferences
with others, whereby we shall enrich our minds by communicating with them in
their stock, and more firmly imprint in our memories that which we know
already, according to that of the Apostle, Let the Word of Christ dwell in you
richly, in all wisdom, Col. 3. 16.
teaching and admonishing one another. Fourthly, we must labor to be
reconciled unto God in Christ, and then becoming his friends, he will make us
acquainted with his will and counsels, according to that of our Savior; I
have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father, John
15. 15.
I have made known unto you. Fifthly, let us labor to have our hearts
fraughted with Gods fear; for if any man fear the Lord, him shall he teach
the way Psalm. 25. 12. 1. Pet. 5. 5. Psalm. 25. 9. Matthew. 11. 25. 1. Cor. 3. 18.
that he shall choose. Sixthly, let us deck our selves with humility, for he
gives his grace to the humble, and teaches him his way; he reuealeth his
secrets to little babes, and hides them from those who are wise and prudent in
their own conceits. And therefore we must be fools to our selves and to the
world, if we would be wise to God and our own salvation. For there is no true
wisdom, but in the saving knowledge of God and his will, and holy obedience
yielded unto them, according to that of the Prophet, The wise men are ashamed,
they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have Ier. 8. 9. Deuteronomy. 4. 6.
rejected the Word of the Lord, and what wisdom, is in them? Seventhly, we
must labor after holiness, for God reuealeth his mysteries unto his Saints, but
Col. 1. 26.
will not suffer his wisdom to enter into a profane and malicious soul, as
we see in the experience of the greatest Prelates and Doctors of the world, who
living in profaneness and all sensuality, have not so much feeling, saving
and experimental knowledge of God, and the mysteries of his Kingdom, as many
silly women and simple Idiots. Lastly, we must put those things in practice
which we already know, and then will God reveal more unto us, and fasten that
which we know already, in our hearts and memories; for as our Savior says, If
any man will do his will, he shall John. 7. 17.
know of his doctrine; and we shall with David, be wiser then the ancient, yea,
Psalm. 119. 99, 100.
then our teachers, if we have more care then they in keeping Gods
Commandments; For the fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to depart from evil,
is understanding. Job. 28. 28. Psalm. 111. 10.
And as David says, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a good
understanding have all they that do his Commandments.

CAP. VIII.
Of a lively and justifying faith, which is the second main ground of a godly
life.

. Sect. 1 That without faith we cannot perform any duties of a godly life.
THe second mayn ground of a godly life, is a true and justifying faith,
without which we cannot perform any duty acceptable to God. For before our
works can be acceptable, our persons must be accepted; neither can the actions
of an enemy be pleasing unto him with whom he is at emnity, before they be
reconciled: we must first be good trees, before we can bring forth any good
fruits, and have our hearts sanctified by faith, before we can do the works
of sanctification. For who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not
one, says Job. And what is Job 14. 4. and 15. 14.
man, that he should be clean? and he that is borne of a woman, that he shoud
be righteous? As Eliphaz speaks. First Abels person must be accepted, before
Genesis 4. 4.
his sacrifice could be acceptable. And we cannot be accepted in our selves,
being dead in sin, and the children of wrath as well as others, till being by
faith united unto Christ, God accepts of us in his best Beloved. Without Heb.
11. 6.
faith therefore it is impossible to please God, for till our persons please
him, our actions cannot. Again, Whatsoever is not done of faith, is sin; and
our Romans 14. 23.
best actions which seem most glorious in the eyes of men, will not endure the
sight of Gods justice, because they are imperfect, and stained with the filth
of our corruptions, till having applied Christ unto us by faith, our
unrighteousness be covered with his perfect righteousness, and our
corruptions be washed away with his blood. And this was the cause why the
Jews, who followed after the law of righteousness, did not attain Romans 9.
31, 32.
unto the law of righteousness, because they sought it not by faith in Christ,
but by their own works of the law. Moreover, we are wild vines, till we be
ingrafted into the true Vine Jesus Christ; and can bring forth no good fruit,
for without him we can do nothing. But being planted into this living John 15.
5.
Stock by a lively faith, we derive from him such sap of grace, that we are
made fruitful in all holy obedience; and as without him we can do nothing, so
with him we are enabled to the performance of all good duties, according to
that of the Apostle; I can do all things, through Christ that Phil. 4. 13.
strengthens me. Furthermore, faith is the prime grace that is (after we are
illuminated) wrought in us by the Spirit; and the only living Fountain, from
which all true obedience flows: for till it purifieth the heart, we have Act.
15. 9. Gal. 5. 6.
not so much as a desire to please God in the performance of any duty; nor any
power to produce a good action, till faith works by love, and gives 1. John.
4. 19.
unto us life and motion. And finally, without faith there can be no love, for
we cannot love God, till first we be assured that he loves us; and without
love there can be no obedience, for love is the fulfilling of Romans 13. 8.
the law, and therefore the want of love, is the root of all disobedience and
transgression. But when by faith we are persuaded of Gods love in Christ, then
do we love God again who has so loved us: and this love works in us a
desire to please him in all things, both by hating and forsaking that which he
hates, and by loving and embracing that, which he loves and commands. So
that according to the measure of our faith, such is the measure of our love;
and if our love be great or small, such also will be the fruits of our
obedience.

. Sect. 2 That faith and a godly life are inseparable companions.
Faith therefore and a godly life are inseparable companions, being united
together in the bond of love, which is stronger then death it self; Cant. 8. 6.
and as a godly life cannot possibly be without faith, no more then the fruit
without the tree, or a wel-built house without a foundation, or breath without
a living body: So neither can a lively faith be severed from a godly life. For
being by faith assured of Gods love, we cannot choose but love him again, and
approve our love by our new obedience. Being by faith ingrafted into Christ,
and so become trees of righteousness, of Gods own planting, we cannot but
bring forth good fruits; For as an evil tree Mat. 7. 17, 18.
cannot bring forth good fruit, so neither can a good tree bring forth evil
fruit, seeing the fruit always follows the nature of the tree. And as men
do not gather Grapes of thorns, nor Figs of thistles; so neither Crabs of
Apple Trees, nor wild and sour grapes, of a good and fruitful vine. Finally,
faith and the fruits of obedience in a godly life, are the one the cause, and
the other the effect, which have such mutual relation, that they argue and
prove, either the presence or absence one of another; as if there be a Father,
there must needs be a child of which he is a father; and if there be a child,
there must needs be a father of whom he is a child. If there be a Sun, there
must needs be beams spreading from it; and if there be beams, there must
needs be a Sun from which they are spread. If there be a living body, it must
needs move and breathe, and if there be a vital breath, then must there needs
be a living body from which it is breathed. And therefore as we may conclude
that if there be no father, son nor body, there can be no child, beams nor
breath; so where there is no faith, there can be no fruits of obedience, seeing
these, as effects, do arise and spring from that cause. And contrariwise as we
may infer, that if there be no child, beams or breath, there can be no father,
light or body; so also that if there be no fruits of obedience in a godly life,
there can be no faith, but only some show and shadow of it, as a man, though
wanting a child, is like a father, the shadow of the sun in the water, like
unto the sun in the firmament, and a dead carcass, like a living body, nor
yet a godly life Jam. 2. 18, 26.
and true obedience, without faith, but some glorious resemblance of it in
outward appearance. As a fatherless boy is like a child who has a father, the
lightening has some similitude of the beams of the Sun, and the breath of
the wind, has some resemblance to the breath of life.

. Sect. 3 That all those deceive themselves, who disioyne faith from a godly
life.
Where by the way we may perceive that diverse sorts of men are notably
deceived, and coozen themselves of their own salvation. As first, carnal
gospellers and profane protestants, who brag of their faith as being strong
and certain, and yet live in all impiety and unrighteousness, bringing forth
no fruits of their faith in good works, and the duties of a godly life.
Secondly, civil worldlings, and superstitious Papists, who pleasing themselves
with their blind devotion, will worship, humane inventions, and some outward
shows of good works, as fastings, penances, almesdeeds, hospitality and such
like, do think God also pleased with them, and will reward them with heavenly
happiness; when as they are destitute of true faith, and utterly ignorant of
God and his will, making no conscience of the duties of the first Table, to
perform them in that manner which God has required; but either neglect them
altogether, or else do them according to their own meanings, wills, and
humane inventions and traditions. Thirdly, such as being touched with some
inward guilt of conscience for their sins, through some affliction, or upon
the hearing of some powerful Sermon, do somewhat grieve for their sins, and
so betake themselves, at least in many things, to a new course of life. The
which, their sorrow accompanied with this reformation, they think pleasing to
God, and sufficient to secure them of their salvation, though they be
destitute of the saving knowledge of God, and a lively faith in Christ, and do
these duties, not out of love toward God, following their assurance of his
love toward them; but out of self-love, and servile fear, either of
temporal punishments, or eternal death and condemnation. But let them all
know, that a lively faith, and a godly life, are inseparable companions, which
never go asunder; for as well may we part the heat from the fire, the light
from the Sun, and make a good tree, retaining still its nature, barraine of
fruit, as separate true faith, and a godly life one from another. And therefore
that the strong faith of carnal Protestants, is nothing else but fruitless
security, and fond presumption; that the devotion and good works of civil
worldlings and ignorant Papists, are blind superstition, will worship, and
glorious sins; like trees that have no roots, and fair buildings that have
no foundation; and that the sudden flood of sorrow, raised by some tempest of
conscience, or storm of affliction, and springs not from the fountain of
faith, is but worldly sorrow that causes death, which commonly lasts but a
while; and when the causes of it are removed, does easily give place to the
contrary extreme of worldly rejoicing, and carnal liberty.

. Sect. 4 Of a general faith.
Now the faith that is required unto a godly life, as the ground and foundation
of it, is either general or special. The general faith is a common gift of
the Spirit, by which we believe and give firm assent to the whole Word of God,
as true and certain. It is called general, because the object of it is
general, even the whole Word of God, and every part of it; and but a common
gift of the Spirit, because it may be in the reprobate as well as in the elect,
seeing it applies not Christ and his benefits for our justification. For by
this faith Ahab believing and assenting to the truth of Gods threatenings,
outwardly humbled himself, and so adiourned his punishments. And the Nineuites
believing the truth of Gods Word in the mouth of Jonas, repented, as they
believed, that is, after a general and legal manner, out of fear to be
attached with those heavy judgments which were threatened, and so escaped them.
Yet this faith is more then a doubtful opinion, seeing it firmly assenteth to
the whole truth, and is to be preferred before natural knowledge and
persvvasion, grounded upon the evidence of sense and reason, seeing it rests
upon the sole authority of Gods infallible truth, and consequently, is more
firm and undoubted, 2. Pet. 1. 19.
because sense and reason may be deceived, but the truth of God can never
fail. Again, though it be not a sanctifying gift of the Spirit, yet it is
more properly then the other, a gift of the sanctifying Spirit, and necessary
unto justifying faith, as being a degree leading to it; as also unto a godly
life, seeing it is required, that not only all we do, be agreeable to the
Scriptures, but also that we believe and be persuaded, that they are agreeable;
for as the Apostle teaches us, whatsoever is done in doubting, whether it
please God or no, and has not this warrant of faith to make us confident, it
is, though materially a good action, yet formally no better then sin in Gods
sight. Romans 14. 23.


. Sect. 5 Of justifying faith, what it is, and what are the things required
unto it.
The special faith, which is the maine ground of a godly life, is a true,
lively, and justifying faith, which is a sanctifying grace infused by Gods holy
Spirit, whereby we do firmly and effectually believe, and assent unto the
promises of the Gospel, especially those which offer Christ and his benefits
unto us, and also them particularly unto our selves, with assurance that they
all do belong unto us; and so rest wholly upon them for our justification and
salvation; whereby it appears, that there are four things required unto
justifying faith. First, knowledge of Gods Word, especially the gracious
promise of Christ and all his benefits, to all that will receive him as their
Savior, and rest upon him for their salvation. For first we must know the
promises, before we can believe them, according to that of the Apostle, How
shall they believe in him, of whom they Romans 10. 14, 17.
have not heard? namely, by the preaching of the Gospel: for as faith comes
by hearing, so this hearing is only of the Word of God. Secondly, assent to the
truth of the Scriptures, especially the promises of the Gospel; for after that
our minds are enlightened with the knowledge of Gods truth, (by which is
revealed unto us, first, our sin and misery, and that we cannot by our
selves, nor the help of any creature come out of it, to the end that we may be
humbled and despair of our own strength; and secondly, the infinite love of
God, and his free mercies in Jesus Christ, together with the gracious promises
of the Gospel made in him, whereby is offered unto us, mercy, reconciliation,
the forgiveness of our sins, and the salvation of our souls, to all that
believe, and will receive them by the hand of faith, bringing forth the fruits
thereof, in hearty repentance and new obedience) then does Gods holy Spirit, by
his secret operation, make the Ministry of the Word effectual, to work in us
a firm assent to this truth of God, respecting our salvation; not so much in
respect of the clear evidence hereof in it self, or the forciblenesse of the
arguments which are brought to convince and persuade natural reason; as in
regard of Gods authority, who is most infallible in his truth, infinite in his
goodness, and almighty, to perform whatsoever he has promised. Which assent
being effectual in us, does work in our understandings, a persuasion, that
our sins, though in themselves heinous, yet compared with Gods infinite
mercies, and the all-sufficient merits of Jesus Christ, are pardonable; in our
judgments a precious and high esteem of these mercies and merits above all
worldly things: In our hearts an hungring and thirsting desire, to be made
partakers of them for the remission of our sins; in our wills a firm
resolution to renounce all other means, and to rest wholly upon Gods mercies
and Christ's merits for our justification and salvation. And in our actions, a
careful endeavor, to use all good means, whereby we may be more and more
assured of Gods love in Christ, and among the rest, in all things to please
God, in all our thoughts, words, and works, that so we may glorify him from
whom we expect so great grace and mercy, and make our calling and election
sure. The third thing required, is an apprehension and application of the
promises of the Gospel, the infinite mercies of God, and all-sufficient merits
of Christ unto our selves in particular, which is the form and very life of
faith, and makes the things thus applied, useful and effectual for our
justification, and without which we shall have no more benefit by them, then a
man has by a sovereign salve and cordial medicine, not applied and taken, or
by warm clothes which are not put on. The last thing required, is affiance and
confidence, when as knowing, assenting unto, and applying Gods mercies and
Christ's merits unto our selves, we rest and rely wholly upon them for our
justification and salvation.

. Sect. 6 That after illuminatio^ there are three degrees of faith; and the
manner how they are wrought in us.
So that after illumination there are three degrees of faith, the first is an
effectual assent to the promises of the Gospel, which works in our hearts
an hungring desire after Christ and his benefits, and in our wills a resolution
to cast our selves upon him alone for our salvation. By which the Christian
truly lives, but yet like a newborn babe, who weakly performs the actions
of life, but knows not, that he either lives or moves. And so weak it is
in apprehension and application, that he can hardly discern it, and often
calls in question whether he has any hold at all or no. It is strong in
desiring, but feeble in performing; resolved by all means to stick unto
Christ, but yet scarce sensible of any union. It admireth the glorious beams
and brightness of Gods love shining in the Word, but feels little warmth of
joy and comfort by it in his own heart and conscience. It works in the weak
Christian, an hungring after the sincere milk of the Word, that he may grow up
thereby, but with little or no sense, that he is nourished, or any whit
increased in the spiritual growth. He seeks earnestly for grace and peace,
but they seem to fly from him, and is still wishing for more and more, but
has little comfort in feeling and fruition. His desires so far exceed the
proportion which he has received, that it is swallowed up of them, so that
nothing in appearance remains: And (like covetous men) he thinks not on
what he has, but upon what he has not, and spends a great part of that time
in complaints of his wants, which should be employed in praising God for that
plenty which he has received. But this faith is still in growth, though they
that have it, do not see it growing; for the Lord is no more ready to enlarge
our hearts with hungring desires after grace, then to satisfy them; this being
his maine end why (like the Merchant) he stretches out these empty bags, that
he may replenish them with a greater portion of these hid treasures. And
therefore when the weak believer carefully and conscionably labors in the
use of all good means, for the strengthening and increasing of his faith, as
hearing the Word, Sacraments, Meditation, Prayer, and such like, the Lord with
his Spirit so blesses them unto him, that from this first degree of faith he
comes to the second, namely, to a comfortable apprehension of Gods promises,
as belonging to himself, to some sense and feeling of the love of God shed
abroad in his heart by the holy Ghost, and to some assurance that he in
particular has part and interest in Gods mercies and Christ's merits, whereby
he is justified and shall be saved. And this is the second degree of faith,
which being but weak in the apprehension of Christ and his righteousness, and
in the sense and feeling of Gods love, is assaulted with much doubting, and
oftentimes shaken with grievous tentations, whereby the Christians hold seems
for the time wholly lost, and his faith in the operations of it almost quite
extinguished; and therefore having attained unto this degree, he rests not in
it as sufficient, but labors in the use of all good means, whereby his
faith may be more and more strengthened and increased, until it come to the
third and last degree of perfection, which is that plerophorie, and fullness of
persuasion of the remission of our sins, of our union with Christ, and Gods
unchangeable Romans 8. 38, 39.
love toward us in him, from which, nothing in the world shall be able to
divide us, as we see in the Apostle Paul's example. Upon which follows
Christian security, in the assurance of Gods protection, and peace of
conscience, that passes all understanding, which though it be assaulted, yet
Romans 5. 3.
is seldom impeached and impugned with any violence of tentations, trouble of
mind, or terrors of conscience. And from hence springs inward joy,
unspeakable and glorious, out of our assurance and sweet feeling 1. Pet. 1. 8.
of Gods love, and the certain persuasion of our own salvation, whereby we
are made cheerful and constant, not only in doing all which God commands,
but also in suffering whatsoever he inflicteth.

. Sect. 7 That the duties of a godly life hold a proportion with our faith,
whether it be weak or strong.
And these are the degrees of a lively faith, without which, or some one of
them, we cannot do any thing pleasing unto God, or set one step forward in the
way of godliness: for faith is a cause and an inseparable companion of a godly
life, of which, if we be destitute in the least degrees, well may we be
ignorantly devout, and zealously superstitious, but we shall never perform
any one duty in such sort as God will accept of it. And according to the
degree and measure of our faith, such also will be our fruits of godliness,
they holding a proportion the one with the other: for as a weak hand may as
truly live and move as a stronger, but yet is not so powerful in motion, nor
possibly able to do so much work; and as a little tree newly planted, may
bring forth good fruit, as well as one that is come to perfect growth, yet
cannot do it in equal quantity: So he that has the weakest faith, lives an
holy life, does some good works, and brings forth some fruits of godliness
and righteousness; but his works are not so many, not his fruits in such
plenty and abundance, as theirs whose faith is grown to an higher degree.
Neither in truth is it possible, that it should be otherwise, seeing weakelings
in faith have more to do, and less ability to perform. For the devils
policy binds him to use all means to supplant them when as he has most hope,
and to pull up faith by the roots, when it is newly planted; and his malice
rages most against those who have newly escaped out of his bondage, and refuse
any longer to be governed by him. The world more vehemently labors to hinder
the good proceedings of those, who have newly separated from it, as conceiving
more hope of their reclaiming; and the corruptions of their own flesh, are
much stronger to betray them into the hands of their foreign foes. So that
they are in the same case with Nehemiah and his fellows, who must in one hand
hold their working instruments, and in the other their weapons, that they may
be ready to repel their enemies. And therefore having these and so many other
difficulties, with innumerable discouragements to hinder them, and fewer and
weaker comforts to harten them on in their Christian course; it is no marvel
if they do not make so good riddance of their work, nor bring forth such
plentiful fruits of godliness in their lives, as those who are stronger in
faith, and have overcome these difficulties, and after the conquest of their
spiritual enemies, have now attained to some peace and rest. And hereof it is,
that they that are weak in faith, are more unsettled in the Christian course,
one while going forward, another while intermitting their labor; one while
standing still, and soon after slipping and falling in their way, or wandering
out of it into the by-ways of sin; because they have strong opposition, and
are weak to make any resistance: only the Lord, who has promised that none
of his shall be tempted above their power, and 1. Cor. 10. 13. 2. Cor. 12. 9.
delights to glorify his might in their infirmities, does assist them with
his Spirit, and thereby inableth them to overcome all difficulties; and when
they slip, preserves them from falling, or being fallen, raises them up
again; renews their strength when it is decayed, and gives them, in the
end, a good issue out of all their tentations, and an happy victory over all
their enemies.

CAP. IX.
Of the means whereby we may obtain a lively faith, and daily increase it
from the least to the highest degree.

. Sect. 1 Of five special means whereby we may obtain a lively faith.
SEeing then faith is so necessary to a godly life, and higher degrees of it,
for attaining of higher perfection, and making of a further progress in the
ways of holiness and righteousness; it behooves every one, who desires to
lead a life acceptable unto God, to use all good means whereby he may attain
unto faith, and having the first degrees of it, not to rest in them, but to use
all endeavor, whereby he may grow from faith to faith, until he attain unto
fullness of persuasion. Now the means of attaining faith are many. The first
and principal is prayer, which is not only in it self a powerful means to
obtain it of God, but also of making all other means effectual to those ends
for which we use them. For faith is not of Ephesians. 2. 8.
our selves (as the Apostle teaches us) but it is a free grace and gift of
God; and as our Savior says, It is his work that we believe on him whom he
has Ioh. 6. 29.
sent. And none have it, but they unto whom it is given, according to that of
the Apostle; Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
believe Phil. 1. 29.
on him, but also to suffer for his sake. Now the way to get Gods gifts, is, to
beg them at his hands by effectual prayer, according to that, If any Iam. 1. 5.
man want wisdom, let him ask it of God, that gives all men liberally;
seeing he has tied himself by his gracious promise, that if we ask, we
shall receive; Matthew. 7. 7.
and that whatsoever we desire in his Sons name, he will give it us. And Job.
16. 23.
therefore if we would have faith, we must be frequent and fervent in prayer,
and after that by Gods Spirit it is, like a small seed, sown in our hearts,
and scarcely to be discerned, being hidden from our sight under the clods of
our corruptions; we must use the same means to bring it to some growth, saying
with the Apostles, Lord, increase our faith, and with Luke 17. 5.
the father of the possessed child, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief.
Mark. 9. 24.
The second means is, that we adioyne our selves to the true Church of God,
where the Word is sincerely and powerfully taught, and the Sacraments duly and
rightly administered. For howsoever our faith is not built upon the Church, yet
does it prepare our hearts to the receiving of it, not only in respect of that
authority which it has, to move us to the embracing of that which it
imbraceth and commends unto us; but also as it offers the means which
only are effectual for the begetting and increasing of our faith, being the
Master of the Rowles, which has the custody of all our spiritual evidences,
and the keeper of Gods Seals, whereby our faith is assured of the truth of his
promises. The third means, is the careful and conscionable hearing of Gods
Word, with a desire to profit by it; for faith comes by hearing, and hearing
by the Word of God; Romans 10. 17. 1. Cor. 3. 5.
in which respect the Preachers of the Gospel are called Ministers, by whom the
people believe; because their Ministry is the ordinary means of begetting
faith in them. The fourth means, is the use of the Sacraments, which are as
Seals annexed to the Covenant of grace, whereby we are undoubtedly assured,
that God will make good unto us all his promises of grace and salvation in
Jesus Christ. The fifth is, Christian conferences and holy examples, whereby we
gain subjects to Christ's Kingdom, and build up one another in our holy faith,
as we see in the example of the woman Joh. 4. 59.
of Samaria, who by her sayings, drew many to believe in Christ: and of Aquila
and Priscilla, who by their holy conferences, informed Apollos Act. 18. 26. 1.
Pet. 2. 12.
more perfectly in the way of the Lord.

. Sect. 2 Of the last means of obtaining faith, which is meditation on diverse
subjects.
The last means is often to meditate upon these points following. First, upon
Gods everlasting and undeserved love, which moved him, even whilst we were
sinners, the children of wrath, the vassals of Satan, and enemies to God and
his grace, to send his only begotten, and dearly beloved Son into the
world, that taking our nature upon him, he might therein redeem and save us,
by satisfying his justice, in paying for us an all-sufficient price for our
redemption. And therefore he that sought us when we were lost, will not cast
us away when he has found us. He that so loved us when we were enemies,
will not forsake us now, if we seek his favor. He that out of mere love
gave Christ to redeem us by his death, will not, when he has bought us at so
dear a price, suffer us to perish, if we apply Christ and his merits by faith,
when as a free gift he offers him unto us. Secondly, let us meditate on Gods
infinite mercy, which causes him to delight, not in death and destruction, but
the conversion and salvation of sinners. The which his mercy being above all
Romans 5. 10. Ezekiel. 33. 11.
his works, and infinitely greater then all our sins, is freely offered unto
us, and we are sure to receive it, if we do not reject it by unbelief.
Thirdly, let us meditate on Gods immutable and infallible truth in his
promises, and his omnipotent power, whereby he is able to perform them.
Fourthly, upon the all sufficiency of Christ's righteousness and obedience,
whereby Gods justice is fully satisfied, and his wrath appeased, of which we
shall be partakers, if we believe in him as our only Savior and Redeemer.
Fifthly, let us meditate on the Covenant of grace, wherein the Lord promises
the pardon of our sins, and the salvation of our souls, not upon the
condition of our works and worthiness, nor with exception of our sins, but
upon the alone condition of a lively faith, which brings forth the fruits
thereof in unfeigned repentance. Sixthly, let us meditate upon the generality
and indefinitenesse of Gods promises, which exclude no sorts of sinners, who
do not exclude themselves by their unbelief, rejecting Gods pardon when as it
is offered, and pulling off the sovereign salve of Christ's merits and
obedience, so as it cannot cure their sores of sin. Lastly, let us meditate
upon faith, not only as it is an instrument, whereby Christ is applied, but
also as it is a duty, which is not arbitrary to be done or not done at our free
choice, but expressly commanded by God, as the condition of the covenant which
Mark. 1.
he has made with us, the which we also in our baptism have undertaken to
perform. And therefore setting all doubts and disputes aside, we must believe
in obedience to Gods Commandment. And so much the rather, because God has not
only required it at our hands, but has also used all means enabling us to
perform it. For he has made his covenant with us of grace and salvation, and
though he be truth it self, and cannot fail of his promises, yet respecting
our imbecility and weakness of faith, he has, to put away all doubting,
confirmed them by his oath, and by annexing unto his handwriting, his seals
the Sacraments.

. Sect. 3 Of the means whereby we may attain unto fullness of persuasion.
And these are the means of begetting and confirming of our faith, that it may
not only assent unto the truth of Gods promises, but also apply and apprehend
them to our own particular use. Now, that from these two first degrees we may
grow unto fullness of persuasion, which, in assurance of our perseverance in
the fruition of Gods love, does make us, with the Apostle, to triumph over all
difficulties and dangers, there are diverse Romans 8. 38, 39.
other things required. As first, that we esteem faith our chief riches; and
this will make us spiritually covetous, and careful by all means to add unto
this treasure. Secondly, we cannot come to this fullness of faith, but by often
experience of Gods love, shining in the riches of his mercies, especially in
things appertaining to grace and eternal glory. To which purpose we must be
sensible of Gods goodness, and diligently observe his favors toward us, and
so by induction of particulars (that seeing so often and many ways he has bin
gracious, and has given unto us such innumerable testimonies and pledges of
his love, hence) we may gather an experimental conclusion, that being
immutable in his goodness, we shall live and dye in his favor, and nothing
shall be able to separate us from it. Thirdly, we attain unto this fullness of
persuasion, by becoming more and more acquainted with God in the use of his
holy ordinances, as prayer, hearing the Word, receiving the Sacrament of the
Supper, and meditation; for hereby our communion and acquaintance with God is
increased; and the better we know him, the more firmly will we trust and
believe in him, tasting hereby the sweetness of his goodness, and the
infallibility of his mercy and truth. Fourthly, we attain unto certain and
full assurance of Gods love toward us, by our often testifying and approving of
our love toward God, in our care to keep all his Commandments, that thereby
we may glorify his Name, by having the light of our holy conversation shining
before men: seeing we could not possibly love 1 John 4. 19. Ier. 31. 3. John
13. 1.
him, if he had not loved us first: and whom he loves, to the end he loves
them. Finally, we attain unto it by continual exercizing our selves in good
works, and by the daily practice of Christian duties, and leading of a godly
life. For as faith justifying us, by applying Christ's righteousness, does
cause a good conscience, after we have peace with God; so when we keep our
consciences, purged with Christ's blood, clear and unspotted of any known,
willing and gross sin, it does maruailously confirm our faith in the
assurance of Gods love, seeing we are careful to maintain our peace with him,
and therefore assuredly he will be at peace with us; according to that of the
Apostle; If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. 1.
John 3. 21.


. Sect. 4 Of that special faith whereby we apply Christ for our sanctification.
And so much concerning justifying faith, which is the ground and foundation of
a godly life. Besides which generally considered, there is a special faith, or
rather a branch of the other, which is very profitable and necessary to uphold
and further us in our course of Christianity; namely, when as we do by faith
apply Christ, not only for salvation; but also for sanctification, and
apprehend the promises, both for justification and life eternal, and also for
the subduing of our corruptions, and renouation unto newness of life in this
World. In which respect also it may be truly said, that the just do live by
their faith, and that they cannot lead their Heb. 2 4
lives in holiness and righteousness without it. For there are so many mighty
enemies that encounter us in this way, so many difficulties and dangers which
we must overcome, so many duties contrary to our corrupt nature to be
necessarily performed, and so many strange corruptions to be mortified and
subdued in us, that if we respect our own strength, it will plainly appear
to be utterly impossible to go forward in the course of godliness, or to
attain unto any measure of that sanctification which we labor after; whereas
contrariwise, if we renounce our selves, and our own strength, and by a
lively faith rest upon the power and promises of God, for the beginnign,
continuing and perfecting of this work, then need we not to be discouraged by
our wants and weaknesses, from undertaking or proceeding in it, nor by the
malice and might of our spiritual enemies, or any other difficulties which
meet us in the way; seeing we are assured that the Lord our God is
all-sufficient to remove all impediments, to give us strength against all
opposition, to make things in themselves impossible, to become possible and
easy unto us; and not only able, but also willing to bring us on in the ways
of godliness, and to perfect that good work of grace in us which he has
begun. In which respects, we have great cause with all courage and
cheerfulness to undertake this work, and to go on in the ways of
godliness, if by faith we are once persuaded, that we shall, in Gods good
time, overcome our spiritual enemies, subdue our strong corruptions, perform
with ease and comfort, those duties which seem yet so difficult, and in some
good measure attain unto that sanctification, and holiness of life, which we
labor after.

. Sect. 5 Of the means whereby we may strengthen our faith in the assurance
of our sanctification.
Now the means to attain unto this faith, and to be more and more confirmed
in it, is to consider, that God the Father has elected us as well Ephesians. 1. 4.
to the means as to the end; and as he has ordained us unto life eternal, so
also that we shall walk in the way of holiness and righteousness, that leads
unto it; according to that of the Apostle, he has chosen us before the
foundations of the world, that we should be holy and without blame. And
therefore as his election is certain to bring us unto everlasting happiness, so
also to conduct us thither by this way of holiness, either by a shorter cut,
as the thief upon the Cross, who was not converted before he suffered; or by
alonger way, as Simeon, John the Apostle, and many others. So in that golden
chain of salvation; whom he did predestinate, them also he called; Romans 8. 30.
whom he called, them he justified; and whom he justified, them he glorified:
the decree of God is coupled and linked unto the end by the means which come
between them. Again, we have Gods promises, upon which we may build our
faith as well for our sanctification, as for our salvation, and that not only,
as the promises of life eternal include the promise of holiness and a godly
life, as the way that leads to that end, but severally and in special
manner. For in the Covenant of grace, the Lord promises to write his Law in
our hearts, by which phrase is signified, that we shall not only know his will
in our understandings, but incline unto it with our affections, Ier. 31. 34.
that we may practice it in our lives; even as the law of nature written in the
heart of Adam by creation, enabled him both to know it, and also to embrace and
obey it. So God promises, that under the Kingdom of Christ, he will take away
their corruptions of nature, and make them to become new creatures. Yea the
Lord has not only said, but Esa. 11. 6, 9.
sworn it, that all who are redeemed out of the hands of our spiritual
enemies, Luke. 1. 74, 75.
shall worship and serve him in holiness and righteousness, before him, all
the days of their lives; that is, not by fits and starts, but from the day of
their conversion, to the day of their death. Again, the Lord promises to give
his Spirit to those that ask him: and our Savior, that he will send the
Comforter, who shall lead us into all truth, so that he shall not barely teach
Luke. 12. 11. John 16. 13.
us the way, but guide us in it; subduing the flesh with the lusts thereof, and
inabling us to withstand the tentations of Satan and the world, to overcome all
difficulties, and to hold out in our profession and practice of true godliness
unto the end. Moreover, we may have a sufficient ground for this special
faith, if we consider, that the virtue of Christ's death being Romans 6. 4.
applied by faith, is as effectual for the mortifying of our flesh and sinful
corruption, as for the taking away of the guilt and punishment of our sins; and
that his resurrection is as powerful to raise us up to newness of life in
this world, as to the life of glory in the world to come; and therefore they
that have part in Christ, may apply him unto themselves by faith, for assured
sanctification, as well as for justification or salvation; according to that of
the Apostle: But ye are in Christ Jesus, who is of God made unto us, wisdom,
and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, that is, not 1. Cor. 1.
30.
only sufficient to make us holy by imputation of his holiness, but by
working in us inherent holiness by his Spirit. Finally, the holy Ghost who
dwells in us, is all-sufficient to perfect the work which he has begun,
and will not willingly lose his labor, in giving it over before he Phil. 1. 6.
has attained his end. And therefore though our flesh be never so rebellious,
he both can and will tame and mortify it; though our enemies be never so many
and malicious, he is all-sufficient by his own strength, in our greatest
weakness to overcome them. And though we meet with never so many
difficulties, he will so assist and strengthen us, that they shall not be able
to hinder us from proceeding in the way of holiness, till we come to our place
of happiness. Now if by these considerations we strengthen our faith in this
special persuasion, that if we will wait Gods leisure in the use of all good
means, we shall certainly attain unto that sanctification which we labor
after, it will be a notable encouragement to make us go on cheerfully in the
practice of all duties, which concern a Christian life; for who would not
courageously fight, that is beforehand assured of victory? or run a race, that
is sure to come to the goal, and win the garland? or undertake weighty and
necessary enterprises, though of great difficulty, if he be thoroughly
persuaded, that he shall overcome them? whereas on the other side, for want of
this faith, or rather this special art of application, many dear servants of
God are hindered and discouraged, from going on, in the duties of holiness and
righteousness, or else proceed with much vncomfortablenesse and
disquietnesse, because comparing their weakness, with the difficulty of the
work, they think that they shall never atchieue it in any measure acceptable
to God; though in the mean time they want not faith to rest upon the promises
of the Gospel, the mercies of God, and merits of Christ, for their
justification, and the bringing of them to everlasting happiness?

CAP. X.
Of the third ground of a godly life, which is a pure heart.

. Sect. 1 Of a pure heart, what it is; and whence it arises.
BEsides those main grounds of a godly life before spoken of, saving
knowledge, and a lively faith, there are two other which Prou. 20. 9.
arise and spring from them, a pure heart, and a good conscience. By a pure
heart, I do not understand such an one as is free from all sin and
corruption: for who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
sin? But such an heart as being regenerate by Gods Spirit, is in part
purified and sanctified, hating sin, and loving virtue and holiness in the
inner man; feeling the weight of corruption, and desiring to be cleansed from
it, and the want of grace, and resolving to use all good means, whereby it may
be supplied. And this is a fruit of saving knowledge, which discovers unto us
how ugly sin is in it self; and pernicious unto us, and the beauty and
excellency of grace and godliness in it own nature, with the profit which
redoundeth unto us by it; and also of a justifying faith, which applying the
virtue of Christ's death and resurrection, does mortify our carnal
corruptions, and quicken us in the life of grace, making us to hate that sin
which we formerly loved, and to love and embrace that grace and virtue which in
time past we loathed; and answerably to resolve, that we will use all good
means to be freed from the one, and furnished with the other. All which
proceeds out of our assurance of Gods love, which being shed abroad in our
hearts by the holy Ghost, does work in them unfeigned love toward Romans 5. 5.
God again, whereby we desire, resolve, and endeavor, to leave and forsake
what he hates and forbids, and to embrace and practice whatsoever he loves
and commands.

. Sect. 2 That all true fruits of godliness spring from a pure heart.
And this is that pure heart which is necessary to a godly life, as being a
chief pillar that supporteth it, and a lively fountain, from which all good
and virtuous actions do spring and flow. For if the heart be pure, it will
purify all our words and actions: but if it be defiled, we can expect no pure
streams from a polluted fountain; according to that of our Savior, Those
things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth of the heart, Mat. 15. 19.
and they defile the man: for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
murders, adulteries, etc. And therefore as it is in vain to purge the
streams when the fountain is defiled, because it will soon again pollute
them, whereas if the spring be clear, it will soon cleanse the streams,
though much defiled, that issue from it; so is it with the fountain of the
heart, and the words and actions, which from it, as streams do spring and
flow. The heart is the root and tree, and the words and works are the fruits
it bears, which discover what it is; for a good tree brings forth good
fruits, Mat. 7. 17, 18.
and a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruits; neither can a good tree bring
forth evil fruit, nor a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit, as our Savior
has taught us. It is the treasury of all our thoughts, speeches and actions.
And a good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings forth Luke 6.
45.
that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart,
brings forth that which is evil, for of the abundance of the heart, the
mouth speaks. It is the King and Monarch in the little world of man, which
gives laws to all the other members, reigning and ruling over them as it
seems good unto it. It is the primum mobile, and first moouer, which gives
motion to all other parts as inferior spheres; and as it were the first
wheel of the clock, whose motion all the rest follow, standing still when it
stands, and going as it goes. So that if the heart be an inditer Psa. 45.
1. and 57. 7. and 108. 1.
of a good matter, the tongue will be the pen of a ready writer; if the heart
be prepared, so also will be the tongue to sing and give praise; if it nourish
evil thoughts like unto discords, there can be no good music: but if it be
well tuned, we shall, in singing Hymns, Psalms, and spiritual Songs, sing
Col. 3. 16.
with grace, and make sweet melody in Gods ears. And therefore David desiring
to make good speed in the way of godliness, desires first to have his heart
in larged with the love of it; I will run (says he) the way of thy Psalm.
119. 32.
Commandments, when thou shall enlarge my heart.

. Sect. 3 That God chiefly desires the heart above all other parts.
And hereof it is that the Lord chiefly requires the heart, according to that
of Solomon, My son, give me thy heart. The which also David chiefly Pro. 23
26. 1. Chron. 28. 9.
required of him in the service of God; And thou Solomon my son, know thou
the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and willing mind: for
the Lord searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the
thoughts. It is, above all other parts, the sacrifice which is most acceptable
unto God, according to that of the Psalmist, The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou will not despise. An Psalm.
51. 17.
upright heart is his chief delight, and though he requires sincerity both in
our words and works, yet above all, he desires truth in the inward parts.
Verse. 7.
And if the heart be sincere, and desires to offer unto God perfect service,
the Lord passes by and pardons our imperfections, and accepts as perfect,
our weak and worthless endeavors; according to that of the Apostle, If there
be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man 2. Cor. 8 12.
has, and not according to that he has not. An example whereof we have in
Iehosaphat and Asa, who though their inward corruptions did break out into
diverse open sins, yet because they prepared their hearts to seek the 2. Chr.
19. 3.
Lord, he esteemed them as perfect, and what they did, seemed just and 1. King.
15. 11.
right in his eyes. Whereas on the other side, how glorious soever our words
and actions seem to be, yet if we regard wickedness in our hearts, the Lord
Psalm. 66. 18.
will not regard us nor our prayers; if we will not lay Gods Word to our heart,
Mal. 2. 2.
to give glory to his name, he will send a curse upon us, by which, even his
blessings shall be accursed.

. Sect. 3 That God respects no duty, unless it proceed from a pure and
sincere heart.
Neither can any duty of a godly life which we perform unto God, be approved
of him, until our hearts be first approved. And as David 2. Sam. 3. 13.
Deuteronomy. 6. 6.
would not accept of Abners service, nor let him have the favor of seeing his
face, except he brought his wife with him; so neither will the Lord regard any
service which we offer unto him, if we leave our hearts behind us, which are
above all other parts espoused unto him by solemn Covenant. In all our
obedience the heart is chiefly required. These words which I command thee this
day, shall be in thine heart: ye shall lay up these words in your heart, and in
your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as
frontlets between your eyes. And again, Set your hearts unto Deuteronomy. 11. 18.
and 32. 46.
all the words which I testify among you this day. In our conversion unto God,
the heart must first turn unto him. Turn ye unto me with all your heart, etc.
and rent your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your Joel
2. 12, 13.
God. Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns; circumcise your
selves unto the Lord, and take away the foreskin of your hearts. In our Ier. 4.
3, 4.
spiritual warfare against the enemies of our salvation, the Court of guard
must keep the carefullest watch about the Castle of our hearts, that it may
not be surprised, neither by the secret treason of the flesh, nor the open
violence of the devil or the world, seeing if we lose this fort, we shall lose
the life of grace which is preserved in it; according to that of Solomon, Keep
thine heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life. The
curing Pro. 4. 23.
our souls of their spiritual diseases, must begin at the heart; and the
inward cause of corruption must thence be purged, before there can be any
true reformation, or sound health in the outward parts: Even as the heat of
the face is not much abated, by casting upon it water or cooling things, but by
allaying inwardly the heat of the liver. Finally, our service of God (if we
would have it accepted) 1. Tim* 4. 8.
must not be performed only with the outward man: for as the Apostle
speaks, Bodily exercise profits little: but it must be the service of the
heart, and performed in spirit and truth. Otherwise it Ioh. 4. 23.
will be vain, and but lost labor, according to that of the Prophet cited by
our Savior; This people draws nigh unto me with their lips, but their
heart is far from me. But in vain they worship Matthew. 15. 8.
me, etc. If we wash our hands, and not our hearts, and make clean the
outside of the cup and platter, and let the inside be defiled with corruption
and sin, we shall not exceed the Pharisees, who by our Saviors censure, did
not exceed the hypocrites, and were worse then Publicanes and professed
sinners: and if we gild the outside by a glorious profession, and inwardly in
the heart nourish our corruptions, we shall with them be rightly compared to
painted sepulchers, which were outwardly glorious, but within full of dead men's
bones and all uncleanness. Mat. 23. 25, 27.


. Sect. 4 That all true reformation and repentance must begin with the
consecrating of our whole hearts unto God.
And therefore when we go about the reformation of our lives, let us first
begin witht he purging of our hearts, and offer them unto God, as a Psalm. 40.
8. Psalm. 119. 112, 167 and 141. 4.
free will offering, and the first fruits of our new obedience, if we mean to
have a good crop of godliness, and the whole harvest sanctified to our use.
And this was David's practice, watching chiefly over his heart, that he might
consecrate it, above all other parts, to the Service of God. I delight (says
he) to do thy will, O my God, yea thy Law is within my heart. And again, I
have inclined mine heart to perform thy Statutes always even unto the end. My
soul has kept thy testimonies, and I love them exceedingly. So Moses prays
unto God, in behalf of himself and the people, Teach us so to number our
days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom. Neither is it sufficient,
either to please God, or to attain unto sanctification and a godly life, to
consectate our hearts in part only unto Gods service, and to reserve part for
the service of the world. For we cannot serve two masters so contrary in
disposition, nor at once please God and Mammon, as our Savior has taught us.
We must not halt between two opinions, but if God be God, we must serve him:
If Baal be God, we must serve him. God Matthew. 6. 24. 1. King. 18. 21.
is a jealous lover, and will endure no corriuals in the heart, which above all
parts he chiefly loves. And therefore if we intend to lead a godly life, and
to please God in all our courses, we must set our whole hearts to seek and
serve him, and as he requires, love him with all our heart, and Deuteronomy. 6. 5.
Mat. 22. 37. Psalm. 119. 10, 34.
with all our soul, and with all our mind. So David; With my whole heart have
I sought thee, O let me not wander from thy Commandments. Give me
understanding, and I shall keep thy Law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole
heart. And thus Asa and his people entered into a Covenant to seek the Lord God
of 2. Chro. 15. 12.
their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul.

. Sect. 5 That we must take special care for the purifying of our hearts, and
wherein it chiefly consists.
By all which it appears how necessary it is, that intending to lead a Godly
life, we deuote and consecrate our hearts, yea, our whole hearts, Esa. 66. 3.
to the service of God. And because he being most pure, can endure no
corruption or pollution, and therefore will abhor our most formal service,
if our hearts continue and delight in their abominations, yea, will as much
hate the heart it self polluted with sin, if it be offered unto him, as
Swines blood, or a dogs head; therefore from hence also it appears how
necessary it is, when we set our selves to please God by a godly life, to take
special care to have in the first place, our hearts purged, and purified from
the filth of sin. For naturally our hearts are full of all uncleanness,
fountains of maliciousnes, and sinkes of sin, spiritually blind and foolish,
but unto all impiety, witty, sharp-sighted, and, as the Prophet speaks,
wicked and despightfull above all things; auerse unto all Ier. 17. 9.
good, and prone to all evil, dead and dull to Gods service, and full of life
and vigor to the service of the devil, the world, and our own carnal
concupiscence. Finally, they swarm with all noisome lusts, as pride,
hypocrisy, covetousness, voluptuousness, ambition, malice, envy, disdain,
worldly love, and all manner of carnal corruption. And therefore it is most
necessary that our hearts be first cleansed and purged, before we can offer
unto God any acceptable service: for what can issue out of these sinks and
puddles of corruption, but all manner of sinful impiety? and what streams of
Gods service so pure in themselves, which will not be polluted, if they run
through these dens and ditches of all abominations? Now this purging of the
heart consists in the mortification of the flesh, and its sinful lusts, and
in spiritual renewing unto holiness and new obedience, whereby we begin to
hate all that evil which we formerly loved, and to love that good which we
formerly hated; to loath the tyranny of sin and Satan, unto which, with all
willingness we subjected our selves in time past, and to embrace the true
service of God, in all sincerity, which before, we either neglected, or
performed after a formal, cold and careless manner: And finally, have our
hearts and affections weaned from the love of the world and earthly vanities,
upon which, in the days of our ignorance, we wholly doted, as on our chief
delight and treasure, because we now see that they are uncertain, momentany
and mutable, worthless and unprofitable; yea, to those that set their hearts
upon them, hurtful and pernicious. And contrariwise, adhere and cleave unto
the Lord, with all our souls, as being all-sufficient, and infinite in all
perfection, choosing him for our portion, and inheritance, our rock and refuge,
and far preferring him before all earthly treasures and delights. And thus
the Lord, when he called Abraham out of Vr of the Chaldeans, to be his
servant, withdraws his heart from the love of worldly things, as being
insufficient to preserve him from evil, or to furnish him with any true good,
by promising that he himself would be his shield and exceeding great reward.
And thus he persuades him unto uprightness of Genesis 15. 1.
heart, and to walk before him in holiness of life, because, if he would
choose him for his portion, he should find him almighty, and all-sufficient,
and therefore able to preserve him from all danger, and to relieve and Genesis 17.
1.
supply all his wants, though for his profession and practice of Gods true
Religion, he should be abandoned of all worldly helps, and exposed to the
malice of many and mighty enemies. And thus Moses contemned the world, and
refusing the pleasures of Egypt, and the honors of Pharaohs Court, adhered
unto God and his pure Religion, choosing rather to suffer Heb. 11. 25.
affliction with his people, then to inoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
So David being in his heart and affections, like a weaned child, and lothing
the worlds breasts, from which he had formerly sucked the sweet milk of earthly
Psalm. 131. 2.
vanities, with so much delight, does with all his heart and soul cleave unto
the Lord, choosing him for his portion, and inheritance, and esteeming him as
his sole treasure. The Lord (says he) is the portion of mine inheritance,
Psalm. 16. 5, 6.
and of my cup; thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in
pleasant places, yea, I have a goodly heritage. And when he was forsaken of all
worldly helps in the day of trouble, he was not (like worldlings) as a man
forlorn and desperate, but, he cried unto the Lord, and said, Thou Psalm. 142.
5. and 119. 57.
art my refuge and my portion, in the land of the living. So elsewhere he
professes, that all his joy and comfort was in the Lord, and the assurance of
his love, the which was better and greater, then was incident to worldlings in
all their posterity. There be many (says he) that say, Who will show Psalm. 4.
5, 6, 7.
us any good? Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Thou have
put gladness in my heart, more then in the time that their corn and their
wine increased. And thus the Church in the Lamentation, was not in her greatest
misery, left hopeless and helpelesse, but cleaving to the Lord with her heart,
she cries out; The Lord is my portion, says my soul, therefore Lam. 3. 24.
will I hope in him.

. Sect. 6 Of the causes of the hearts purity.
And these are the things wherein this purity of heart does consist. The
principal efficient which works it in us, is the whole Trinity, the Father,
Son and holy Spirit. God the Father begins this sanctification and
holiness in our hearts, by taking away their hardness, and making them soft
and tender, and by giving unto us his Spirit, to purify them from the filth of
corruption, and to quicken them in the life of grace; according to that
promise; I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit Ezech. 11. 19.
and 36. 26.
within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their bodies, and will give
them an heart of flesh. And again; After those days, says the Lord, I will
put my Ier. 31. 33.
Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts. And therefore if we
would have this grace, we must with the Apostle have our recourse to God,
praying for our selves, as he did for the Thessalonians: The very God of peace
sanctify you wholly; and I pray God, your whole spirit, and soul, and 1. These.
5. 23.
body, be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. God
the Son purifieth our hearts by shedding his precious blood, that it might be
a Lauer of regeneration, wherein our polluted hearts might be cleansed. For so
deeply are they engrayned in the skarlet dye of sin, that nothing else will
take away their spots and stains, and bring them unto snowy whiteness. It is
only his Cross, that crucifieth these carnal corruptions, and the virtue of
his death, that kills and mortifieth sin in us. And this is that Fountain
which the Lord promises should be opened Zach. 13. 1.
to the house of David and Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness: in
which if our hearts be not washed, they will remain in their natural
filthiness. God the holy Ghost purifieth our hearts, by uniting them to
Christ, and by dipping and washing them in this Fountain of his blood; and so
makes Ioh. 3. 5.
the death and merits of our Savior, which are sufficient in themselves,
effectual unto us for our purification. For as the Poole of Bethesda had, Ioh.
5.
by the moving of the Angel, virtue in it to cure diseases, but yet did good
to none, but those only which were put into it; so though the blood of Christ
be sufficient to cure the heart of the leprosy of sin, and to make it
clean, yet it is of no efficacy unto any, saving those who are by the holy
Spirit dipped and washed in it; seeing, like the poor lame cripple, we are
naturally impotent, and cannot make any use of these means of our recovery,
unless we be assisted by the holy Spirit. The isntrumental cause of this
purificatio^ is a lively faith wrought in us by the Spirit to this end, the
which we may apply unto our selves, Christ his death and precious bloodshed,
for our spiritual purging from sin: which is perfected in our justification,
in respect of the guilt and punishment, and begun in our sanctification, by
purifying our hearts from their natural corruptions. Act. 15. 9.
In which respect, faith is said to purify our hearts, not materially or
formally, by any virtue inherent in it self, but instrumentally, by applying
unto us the virtue of Christ's death and bloodshed. And until we have this
faith wrought in us by the Spirit, whereby we are assured of the riches of Gods
grace in this life, and glory and happiness in the life to come, our hearts
remain it their natural filthiness, and are full of all carnal and worldly
lusts, neither is it possible that they should be persuaded to contemn the
baits of worldly vanities, and to tread underfoot the pleasures of sin,
with which they are naturally so much delighted, till they have an offer of
better things from God, and have some assurance, that upon their renouncing of
the world and fleshly lusts, and seeking after these richer gifts, they shall
most certainly attain unto them; according to that of the Apostle, Blessed be
God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1. Pet. 1. 4.
who according to his abundant mercy, has begotten us again unto a lively
hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance
incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for
you. And this purged Moses heart from the love of the world, and made him
willing to suffer afflictions with the people of God, because with the eye of
faith he looked upon the recompense of reward. And this caused the Saints of
God Heb. 11. 25.
to content themselves to dwell in tabernacles, and not to regard any earthly
mansions, because they looked for a City which has foundations, whose builder
Heb. 11. 9, 10.
and maker is God: and the holy Martyrs, to endure with patience and joy most
cruel persecution, not accepting deliverance, because by faith they were
persuaded, that they should obtain a better resurrection. Of which comforts of
Heb. 11. 33.
faith, we have great need to be thereby supported under the Cross, and
persuaded unto the contempt of the world; seeing Jesus, the Author and finisher
of our faith, who was free from all worldly lusts and carnal corruption, was
by his heavenly hopes encouraged in his earthly sufferings: for as the Apostle
testifies, He, for the joy that was set before him, endured the crosses,
despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the Heb. 12. 2.
Throne of God.

CAP. XI.
Of the signs of a pure heart, and the means whereby we may both obtain and
preserve it.

. Sect. 1 Of the inward signs of a pure heart.
ANd these are the causes of a pure heart. The signs whereby we may know
whether our hearts be thus purified or no, are either inward or outward. The
inward signs are first the love of holiness and purity; for as when our
hearts are defiled with natural corruption, we loath sanctity, and love and
delight in impure lusts, and the pleasures of sin; so when our hearts are
purified by faith, they are chiefly pleased with those things which please God;
and loving purity and piety, they delight in the exercises of holiness and
righteousness. And therefore when we love purity and holiness, it is an
evident sign that our hearts are pure and holy, seeing the cause of love is
likeness; and where there is no similitude, there can be no love. The second
sign is hatred of sin, which upon the same ground we naturally love;
especially of those sins unto which our corrupted nature is most inclined,
because they most molest and trouble us, and polluting the heart with their
defilements, hinder most our progress in sanctification and holiness. And
thus Paul, when his heart was purified, abhorred all corruption, and delighted
in Gods Law, hating that sin most, which he did most commit, because, like a
Rebel, it warred against the law Romans 7. 15.
of his mind, and made him captive to the law of sin. The third sign is,
our careful avoiding all means and occasions of spiritual pollution: for as
he that has filthy hands, cares not to handle filthy things; but when they
are washed clean, will not willingly touch that which will defile them: so an
impure heart shunneth not the occasions and means of impurity, because they
cannot make it worse then it is in it own nature, in the quality, though they
may increase the pollution, in respect of the degree, yea, rather being like
filthy hogs, naturally inclined unto filthiness, they seek the occasions of
more uncleanness, and purposely wallow themselves in the sink and puddle of
sin, as often as they have opportunity of satisfying their carnal lusts.
More especially, he that has a pure heart, delights in the company of those
who are pure and holy, by whose Christian conversation, his purity and
sanctification may be more and more increased, and cannot endure the society of
the wicked, no not when, like filthy dogs, they fawn upon him, because he
knows that the leprosy of sin is of an infectious and spreading nature,
that he who touches pitch, shall be defiled with it, and that worldly men most
defile, when they most fawn, and do us least hurt, when they are farthest
from us.

. Sect. 2 Of the outward signs of a pure heart.
The outward signs of a pure heart, are the fruits of sanctification and
holiness: for the tree is known by the fruits, and the fountain by the Mat.
7. 17, 18.
streams that flow from it, whether they be good or evil, for a good tree
cannot bring forth evil fruit, nor an evil tree good fruit, as our Savior
has taught us. If therefore the fruits we bear be pure and holy, it is an
evident sign that our hearts be purified and sanctified; if the streams be
clear and sweet, such also is the fountain from which they spring; and if
the coin we outwardly spend and use in our Christian trading one with
another, be current, of pure metal, and the right stamp, then is the treasury
of our hearts good, out of which we bring it. More especially, the purity of
our hearts appears in the purity of our words, when as we delight in the
language of Canaan, and cheerfully intertaine one another Col. 4. 6.
with holy conferences; and when as our speech is powdered with the salt Ephesians. 4.
29.
of wisdom, and ministers grace unto the hearers, edifying one another in
our most holy faith. So also pure hands are a sign of a pure heart, being
inseparable companions, that always go together, and both infallible notes of
a Citizen of heaven; and the works of holiness and Psalm. 24. 4. and 73. 13.
righteousness are signs of an holy and righteous heart, even as clear
streams are a sign that the fountain is pure from which they spring. Whereas
if the hands be full of blood, cruelty, and oppression, bribery and extortion,
fraud and deceit, it is more then manifest, that our hearts remain still
polluted with fleshly lusts, whatsoever profession we make of purity and
sincerity.

. Sect. 3 The means of a pure heart, is, highly to esteem* it.
Now when by these signs, as it were, by the pulse, we come to know the state
of our hearts, whether they be choked up with the gross humors of sinful
lusts, or inliued and quickened with purity and holiness, as it were the
vital spirits of grace, which enable us to the actions of a godly life: in the
next place we must carefully use all good means, whereby we may attain unto
this purity of heart, if we have it not, or preserve it in us, if we already
have it. And first, we are to have it in high esteem, as being a most precious
jewel, not to be valued with any worldly wealth. For it is the fountain of
love, from which all true obedience flows, according to that of the Apostle;
The end of the Commandment is love, out of a pure heart, a good conscience,
and faith unfeigned. So that if the heart be not purified 1. Tim. 1. 5.
by faith, this holy ghest of divine love will not lodge in it, without which,
we cannot perform any duty commanded toward God or our neighbor; or if we
do, yet not growing from the root of love, it fails of its end, and
consequently is done in vain. It is the chief place of residence where Gods
holy Spirit dwells, exercizing his virtue, and showing his divine power and
Majesty; for if our bodies be the temples 1. Cor. 3. 16. and 6. 19.
of the holy Ghost, then sure our hearts being purified, are the Holy of
Holiest, which being his own peculiar, no man may enter or pry into it; and
if we be the habitation of his holy and glorious Majesty, then is the
sanctified heart his privy chamber, in which he suppeth with us, and his
bedcamber, Apoc. 3 18.
in which he lodges. It is that pure Cristall Fountain which purifieth all
our actions, making them accepted as white in Gods sight, which in themselves
are spotted, and causes all other gifts of God to be pure unto us; for to the
pure, all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is
nothing pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled. Tit. 1. 15.
Finally, it is this purity of heart, whereby we attain unto assurance of
blessedness; according to that of our Savior; Blessed are the pure in heart:
for they shall see God. And the Psalmist propounding this great question,
Matthew. 5. 8.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy
place? Psalm. 24. 3, 4.
thus resolves it: He that has clean hands and a pure heart, etc. And if
thus considering the excellency of this Jewel, we do esteem it according to
its true value, it will be a notable means to attain unto it. For according
to that estimate which we set upon Gods rich gifts, such is his bounty in
bestowing them; if we think them much worth, we shall have much; if of little
value, we shall have them but in little measure; but if we contemn and neglect
them as things of no price, (and as those Ruffians, who object purity as an
imputation, and esteem this cleanenesse of heart and hands, the foulest
blemish and aspersion,) the Lord will give unto us none at all, but will
pronounce against us that fearful saying, He that is filthy, Apoc. 22. 11.
let him be filthy still. For he will not cast his Pearls before swine, that
will tread them under their filthy feet; he will not give much of his graces
to them, who have but small esteem of them; but to those who prize them
highly, he will give them liberally, because the thankfulness of their
hearts, will hold proportion with that price which their judgment shall set
upon them. In which respect David was never nearer slipping into the puddle of
impurity, then when he preferred worldly prosperity before Psalm. 73. 13.
sanctity and cleanenesse of soul; Never was he nearer to a polluted heart,
then when he concluded that he had cleansed it in vain. Besides, the more we
esteem this purity, the more dearly will we love it, and the more earnestly
will we labor in the use of all good means, whereby we may be plentifully
enriched with it, begging it of God, who is the sole giver of it, by fervent
prayer, and desiring that he will work it in our hearts by his holy Spirit.
And so the Lord, liberal in himself to bestow his gifts upon them who esteem
them, will give this purity unto us with a much more bountiful hand, having
freely bound himself heereunto by his gracious promise, that if we ask, we
shall have, and if we seek, we shall find, Matthew. 7. 7.
the Lord being as ready to bless the means, that they may be effectual to
their ends, as we can be to use them.

. Sect. 3 Of the manifold evils accompany a polluted heart.
On the other side, let us consider of the manifold evils which do accompany
an heart that is polluted and defiled with sin; for it makes 1. King. 21.
all appearances of graces, though never so excellent, to be nothing less in
truth, and but sole semblances and shows, wherein is nothing but mere
hypocrisy. Our humiliation, like Ahabs, which was not in the heart, but only
in the outward habit; and like the Israelites, who hanged down their heads
like a bulrush, and afflicted their souls, only in the Esa. 58. 5.
day of their fast, their hearts remaining full of pride and cruelty. Our
zeal, like Iehu's, who destroyed Idolatry, to build up his own kingdom. 1.
King. 10. 28.
Our obedience, like Herod's, which was but to the halues, and only so far as
would stand with his carnal lusts. Our profession and following Christ, like
that of Judas, which was no further then he saw it would stand Ioh. 12. 5, 6.
with his ambition and covetousness. Our bounty, in the works of mercy, like
that of Ananias, which was to be praised of men, and not to be approved of
God. It makes our prayers unacceptable to God; for if we regard wickedness in
our hearts, the Lord will not hear us. It polluteth all Psalm. 66. 18.
our actions, as the corrupted fountain polluteth all the streams that issue
from it; and makes all the creatures to become unclean; for unto them Tit. 1.
15.
that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure, but even their mind and
conscience is defiled. Finally, it prophaneth all our vows of holiness, and
makes all our desires, resolutions, and endeavors to lead a godly life,
unsettled, fickle, and unconstant, like unto the burning of an ague, which
proceeds not from natural heat, but from distemper, and therefore ends in
unnatural coldness, the harbinger of death. For these flushings and flashings
of devotion, are not caused with that kindly heat of divine love, but with the
scorching fire of blind and distempred zeal, kindled with self-love and
worldly respects, and therefore last no longer then they last. Whereof it is,
that the righteousness which is grounded on it, is like a goodly house without
a foundation, which falls to the ground, when the tempest of trial arises;
like the Cake, of which the Prophet Hos. 7. 8. and 6. 4.
speaks, which though it may seem outwardly scorched, and more then enough,
yet is it not half baked, and therefore heavy, and not to be disgested by Gods
stomach; and as the morning dew or cloud, which vanishes away, and like the
blade, springing from the seed sown in stony ground, which for want of earth
and moisture withers, when the sun of affliction and persecution rises.

. Sect. 4 The second means of a pure heart is a lively faith.
And these are the arguments which may move us to esteem and seek after a
pure heart, and to hate and avoid the contrary. Now when our Act. 15. 9.
hearts are inflamed with the love of it; the means to obtain it, is a lively
and justifying faith, which purifieth the heart, as the Apostle speaks; not
by any virtue that is in it self, but by applying unto us the blood of Christ,
which alone is sufficient to purge our hearts from all corruption, and to kill
and crucify the flesh with the lusts thereof. And therefore seeing so long as
we continue in infidelity, our hearts will also cintinue in their impurity;
this must make us labor to come out of this estate, and to use to this
purpose, all good means whereby this faith may be begun and increased in
us. Secondly, let us wash them in the tears of unfeigned repentance, bewailing
those sins, in which formerly we delighted, and hating those corruptions,
which in time past we loved. And because we cannot at once purge the deep
sink of our polluted hearts from all their filthiness, therefore we must
make it our daily work, and do it by degrees. And seeing we cannot in one
assault overcome these cursed Canaanites, we must continually make war
against them, and cast them out one after another, as God by his Spirit shall
enable us. Especially let us not, out of fear and cowardice, suffer the sons
of Anakim, our great and Gyant-like corruptions, fortify themselves in the
castle of our hearts; nor let those Agags, which have ruled and reigned most in
us, live out of any carnal respects; but let us even at the first strike at
these maine roots, which being cut off and plucked up, many of the branches
will die, for want of that sap of bitterness which they sucked from them; and
let us drive out these master Bees, and whole swarms of carnal lusts will
issue after them.

. Sect. 5 Of the means to preserve the purity of our hearts.
Now when our hearts are thus purified, our next care must be to preserve them
in this purity and cleanness: for as the cleanest house will gather soil, if
it be not sometime swept; and the brightest armor and weapons are apt to take
rust, if they be not often scowred and oyled: so much more will our hearts
remove to their natural uncleanness, and even rust again in their
corruptions, if we once only take pains to cleanse them, and afterward be
careless to maintain them in their purity. First therefore we must keep a
narrow watch over our hearts, and as the Wiseman exhorts, above all
observations, observe them, that they be Pro. 4. 23.
not carried away from God with loose wanderings, and so (Dina-like) be defiled
with carnal and worldly lusts. For these spiritual enemies are conquered, but
not quite killed; they are beaten and expelled (as it were) out of this city,
but not quite banished out of our coasts. For they lie lurking in secret
corners, and in ambushment; and no sooner do we neglect our watch, and leave
the gate of our hearts unguarded, but presently they take the advantage, and
entering into them in whole troops, they surprise them at unawares. And
therefore it behooves us to keep daily our watch strong, and to nourish and
preserve the garrison of Gods graces in us, that they may either be discovered
and defeated before they approach, or be repelled and beaten back in their
first assaults. For if with loose Christians we neglect this watch and guard,
and let our hearts roue after worldly lusts, and suffer them at pleasure to
riot in them; if we keep them under no government, but suffer them like
masterlesse men, to wander at their pleasure, we shall never reserve them for
Gods use, nor fit them for his service: But like loose vagrants unaccustomed to
work, it will be death unto them to take any constant pains, save only by
fits and starts; and when we would settle them to prayer, hearing, reading, and
meditation, with such like holy exercises, they will by no means be kept in,
unless they be held strictly in their bounds by the strong chain of some
sharp afflictions, but every hand-while, they will start aside, and according
to their accustomed course, wander abroad after worldly vanities. Whereas if we
keep a careful watch over our hearts, we shall keep them from wandering away
from God, or when they begin to stray after the pleasures of sin and worldly
vanities, we shall check them in their course, and bring them back unto Gods
service. We shall be still in readiness to repel and beat back the
tentations of Satan, and to keep out worldly and carnal lusts from entering at
all, and so preserve our hearts in their purity from their defilements; or if
they have entered at unawares, they shall not have time to fortify themselves,
but being like secret traitors observed, and (as it were) taken in the watch,
we will examine them; and finding out their treason, and that they are come in
to defile our hearts, and to betray us to our spiritual enemies, we will kill
and crucify them, and that pollution which they have left behind, we will
presently purge away, by renewing our faith and repentance. And thus by this
careful watch we shall either be preserved from receiving hurt by our carnal
lusts and the devils tentations; or if we have, yet we shall with great ease
recover our losses, when they are no sooner sustained then espied. For these
stains of sin will easily be washed out, if we take them in hand when they
have first tainted our hearts. Our enemies will without any great danger be
beaten out, when they are first entered, and have had no time to fortify and
entrench themselves. Our wounds, whilst they are green, will be soon cured;
and if as soon as we have drunk the poison of sin and carnal lusts, we
presently cast them up again, before they have had time to work, or use our
antidote of faith and repentance, it will not be able to do us any great harm.

. Sect. 6 The second means is to preserve them from all sin.
Secondly, if we would preserve our hearts in purity, we must labor to keep
them from all sin; not only those reigning and raging lusts, which waste the
conscience, and extinguish the vital spirits, like strong poisons; but even
from those lesser corruptions which most men regard not, thinking no sin so
small that we may live in it, nor giving allowance to the least carnal and
worldly lusts. For these also will defile the heart themselves, and make way
for the pollution of fouler sins, whilst they lessen our care to keep them
out; even as when the house is already somewhat fouled, men care not greatly
though it be fouled more, whereas when they see it clean, they more carefully
keep it so from all annoyance. But most especially we must labor to preserve
our hearts pure from those sins, with which they have formerly been most
tainted, and unto which they are still most naturally inclined. And as men take
most care to prevent hereditary diseases; and that they do not by relapse fall
into that sickness, out of which they have newly recovered, because they are
more prone unto them then any other: so also must we do in keeping our hearts
pure from those special corruptions, which have made them sick to the death,
and have fearfully hazarded their everlasting salvation. In time of war we
most strongly man that part of the wall, which being weakest, has most
often been attempted by the enemy; and if a breach be made, we keep it
with a narrovv vvatch and strong guard, till it be again repaired. So the
experience of our enemies policy and power in putting us often to the vvorst,
does make us more vigilant and diligent in our warlike preparations, that we
may be able to make resistance. But if our friends, whom we have formerly
loved, and are acquainted with all our secrets, knowing our outgoings and
commings in, do become our enemies, with what care and circumspection do we
prevent their mischiefs, because we know that by their ancient familiarity
with us, they are acquainted with all advantages? And thus must we do in
warring with our corruptions, if ever we mean to get victory, and to preserve
our hearts from being surprised by them.

. Sect. 7 The third means is, to avoid the occasions of sin.
Thirdly, we must not only labor to keep our hearts pure from the sins
themselves, with which formerly they have been defiled, but also avoid all
Jude 23.
the occasions and means whereby we may be drawn unto them, hating even the
garment which is spotted with flesh. For as in vain he flees the plague in
himself, who haunteth the company of those that are infected; as he fondly
shunneth to be burned, who makes it his sport to play with fire and
gunpowder; and he foolishly protests against whoredom, who delights in the
kisses and wanton imbracement of some common Strumpet; So it is in vain to
think, that we can preserve our hearts from the infection of sin, and from
the fire and filth of burning and polluting lusts, unless we shun the means
and occasions, as well as the corruptions and sins themselves.

. Sect. 8 The fourth means is, often to examine our hearts in Gods sight.
Finally, if we would preserve our hearts in their purity, we must often
examine them in Gods sight, and for the approving of their purity and
integrity, often offer them to his trial. For as the husbands eye and
presence, allowing or disallowing all the wives particular actions, and
behavior to strangers, is the best and surest means to preserve her chastity:
so if the heart betrothed unto God, have all the affections and desires of it
scanned and examined before him, it will not easily be polluted with strange
and unclean lusts. And thus David kept his heart in purity and integrity, by
provoking and offering it often to Gods trial. Judge Psalm. 26. 12. Psalm. 139,
23, 24
me (says he) O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity, etc. Examine me, O
Lord, and prove me, try my reins and mine heart. And again, Search me, O God,
and know mine heart; try me, and know my thoughts, and see if there be any
wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. Whose example if we
follow, it will be a notable means to preserve our hearts in purity. For as we
are extraordinary careful to have our houses cleansed from all filth, when we
prepare them to give entertainment to an honorable and respected friend, who
hating all sluttishnesse, will curiously look into every corner; so will our
care exceed in cleansing our hearts, when as we inuit our God to visit and
lodge in them: yea, we shall have hereby the benefit, not only of our own
care and diligence for the cleansing of our hearts, but of the Lords assistance
to make them more clean, when we have cleansed them as well as we can. For he
is not a curious carper at our infirmities, but a cheerful helper to reform
and amend them; and therefore he that inuiteth the Lord to try and search his
heart, does in another place desire his assistance for the purging of the filth
and guilt of sin, which lurked in such secret corners, that it was not
subject to his own view. Who (says he) can understand his errors? cleanse
thou me from Psalm. 19. 12.
my secret faults.

. Sect. 9 The fifth means is, continually to be taken up in holy exercises.
Lastly, if we would preserve the purity of our hearts, our care must be to
have them continually taken up in holy exercises, either about the general
John 17. 17. Psalm 119. 9. Romans 10. 17.
duties of Christianity, or the special duties of our callings: of the former
sort are the diligent and attentive hearing and reading of the Word, which is a
special means of our sanctification, as our Savior notes, and of the
strengthening of our faith, by which our hearts are purified; and also prayer
at ordinary times either public or private, receiving the Sacrament, holy
conferences one with another singing Psalms, and doing the works of
righteousness unto all, upon all occasions, and the works of mercy unto
those, who do in any respect stand in need of our help: of the other sort
are inward eiaculations, and lifting up our hearts in our secret prayers at all
times, and upon all occasions, and holy meditations of Gods mercies or our own
miseries, or on the means whereby we may be enriched with all grace, and
enabled unto the performance of holy duties. For this privilege the heart has
above all other parts, that whereas they cannot exercise their duties, but when
fit opportunity is offered, as the ear cannot hear the Word, but when it is
preached, nor the hand perform works of mercy, but when it has means to do
them, and fit subjects to work upon, the heart needs never to be idle and
out of holy exercise: but even when our bodies are taken up with the works of
our callings, or honest recreations, we may 1. These. 5. 16, 17. 18.
on all occasions pray, give thanks, and exercise our hearts in holy
meditations, Psalm. 1. 2.
either rejoicing in the Lord and his mercies, or sighing and sorrowing in the
sight and sense of our own miseries. And if our hearts be thus exercised,
being wholly taken up with Gods service, they will have no leisure for the
employments of the devil, the world and the flesh; whereas if they be swept
clean of all spiritual grace and holy duties, the devil will easily enter
with whole swarms of noisome lusts, and Math. 12. 46.
so pollute them at his pleasure with all manner of poisonous abominations.

CAP. XII.
Of Conscience in general, the nature, properties, and effects of it.

. Sect. 1 That the nature of Conscience may partly be known by the name.
THe last ground of a godly life, is a good conscience, without which it is
impossible to please God, or to perform any duty acceptable in his sight. In
speaking whereof, we will first generally show the nature of conscience, and
then more particularly entreat of a good conscience. The nature of conscience
may be partly known by the name, which signifies to know together, or with
another: for as the mind, understanding the nature of things, is said to know
them: so when another joins with it in this knowledge, they are said to know
together. Now there is no creature that can join with man in the knowledge,
that is secret in his mind, according to that of the Apostle; No man knows
the things of a man, but the 1. Cor. 2. 11.
Spirit of a man that is in him. Whereof it is, that humane laws take no
notice of the thoughts of the heart, either to reward or punish them; but it is
only the Lord that searches the heart and reins, who knows and takes
notice together with our minds, of all the secrets which are known unto it.
Whereby the nature of conscience in part appears, namely, that it is such a
faculty in the soul, as takes notice of all our actions, and bears witness
of them before Gods Judgment seat, either with us, when they approve them as
good; or against us, when as they condemn them as evil. So that the
conscience is a certain divine power, which is placed by God in the soul of
man, as a third party indifferent between him and us, sometime speaking for us,
and sometime against us, as the equity of the cause requires. It is Gods
Monitour, which he has set over us, to take notice of all we do, that he
may either reward our well-doing, or punish that which is done amiss. And
because simple knowledge might see and conceal what it sees and knows, God
to this science has added conscience, which being placed in us on the behalf
of the great King of heaven and earth, will not let any thing lie hid and
smothered, but gives impartial witness of whatsoever is done before his
Tribunal, either excusing us when we do well, or accusing us, when we have
sinned against him: Not that the Lord needed any such witness or Monitour to
inform him of our actions; for he sees and knows all things past, present,
and to come, with one perfect and simple act; but because he would in the
administration of his justice, proceed in a legal manner, that we hereby
might be convicted of the uprightness of his judgments, having in our selves
a witness that justifies and approves them.

. Sect. 2 What conscience is, being generally considered.
But that we may yet more clearly discern the nature of conscience, what it
is, we will thus define it. Conscience is a faculty, or power placed by God in
the soul of man, which reflecteth the understanding upon it self, causing it
to apply its general and contemplative knowledge of truth and falsehood, good
and evil, to practical use, for the aiming and determining of all our
particular actions, according to the general rules of reason, either with us
or against us. It is a faculty, and not a natural habit which may be got and
lost: for howsoever the operations of it may be hindered and deadded for a time,
by carnal security, hardness of heart, and the violence of our lusts and
passion: even as reason it self cannot exercise its functions in the time of
sleep or drunkenness; that it never utterly fails; but when it is awakened
by affliction, it shows it self in the actions of accusing, condemning, and
terrifying, as in former times. Neither is it a bare art of understanding, as
some would have it, but a distinct faculty and working power, which in it own
virtue produces diverse So the Apostle Paul speaks, Romans 2. 15. (...). that
is, their reasonings, the mean while, accusing, or else excusing one another.
actions. For when the understanding, in the Thesy and Theory, by way of
general contemplation, approves of any action, as good, or condemns it as
evil, the conscience applies it in the Hypothesy unto a man's own particular
actions, and by virtue of those general notions in the understanding,
determines of them, either with or against us, that they are good or evil.
And this it does (as the schools speak) in a practical Syllogism, in which
the reason or contemplative understanding (so called, because it is exercised
in contemplation, and in seeking out the principles of all knowledge, and is in
respect of this office, named also by Divines, (...), because it is the keeper
and conseruer of those notions implanted in us, concerning good things to be
embraced, and evil things to be shunned of us) this contemplative
understanding (I say) does in this Syllogism offer unto us the Mayor or
Proposition. The conscience which they call (...), because (as I have showed)
it knows not to it self alone, but with God, makes the Minor or assumption,
and the faculty of judgment determining of the fact, infers the
conclusion: As for (...).
example. The understanding suggesteth this Proposition; He that serves God,
who is the supreme cause and chief Good, performs a good duty. The
conscience assumeth, But thou have served God, the supreme cause and chief
goodness; and so the judgment infers; therefore thou have performed a good
duty. Again, on the other side; the understanding says, Whosoever will
worship God truly, must worship him according to his revealed will, and not
according to his own inventions; the conscience assumeth, But thou have not
worshipped him according to his revealed will, but according to thine own
inventions; whereupon the judgment infers, Therefore thou have not
worshipped God truly. Or thus; Whosoever breaks the Law, is accursed, says
the understanding; But thou (says the conscience) have broken the Law:
therefore, says the judgment, thou art accursed.

. Sect. 3 Of the diverse offices of conscience.
Now this faculty of conscience performs diverse offices, in respect of the
diverse parts, wherein it exercises its power and virtue. For in the
understanding, before our actions are achieved, it plays the part of a
friend, or gentle Monitour, telling what is to be done or left undone, with the
penalty or reward which will follow our commission or omission. After the deed
is done, it becomes a Judge, approouing or disallowing the action, and either
absoluing or condemning us, for the doing or not doing of it. In the memory, it
performs the office of a Notary Conscientia est Codex in quo quotidiana
peccata conscribuntur, Chrysostom. in Psalm. 50. Romans 2. 15. 1. Cor. 1. 12.
and Register, in setting down and keeping upon Record, what we have done,
good or evil; and also of a witness, giving evidence, either with or against
us, according to the nature of our fact, accusing us when we have done ill,
and excusing us when we have done well. In the will and affections, it is the
deputy of Gods Spirit, to suggest and inioyne us good duties; and when they
are done, to reward us by comforting, cherishing, and replenishing our hearts
with joy; and when we have done ill, especially by committing sins which are
heinous and against conscience, it executes the office of a Iaylour or
tormentor, filling the heart with shame and sorrow, with fear and terror,
with final desperation, hellish perturbation, and intolerable tortures, that
no rack nor gallows, no hot pincers or scalding lead may be compared with
them, as we see in the example of Cain, who out of a despairing conscience,
cries out, that his punishment Genesis 4. 13.
was greater then he could bear; and of Judas, who, to ease his torment, which
the gnawing worm of conscience caused, hanged himself. And with this office of
conscience the Heathens were acquainted, which gave occasion to that fiction of
hellish furies, which endlesly haunted and tormented those who had committed
heinous sins against the light of nature. The which also appears by their
writings, wherein are many notable sayings to this purpose. What does it
profit, says Seneca, to hide Senec. Epist. 43.
a man's self, and to avoid the eyes and ears of men? A good conscience
calls in the multitude, and an ill is sollicitous and fearful even in
solitude. If the things thou do be honest, care not though all men know
them; if dishonest, what skilleth it though no man know them, seeing thou
know them thy self? O miserable man that thou art, if thou despisest such a
witness! And again, It is the greatest security to do no Epist. 105.
man wrong. They that cannot abstain from it, do lead a life full of
confusion and perturbation, so much fearing as they have hurt. Neither are they
at any time quiet. After they have done mischief, they fear, they are
troubled. Conscience suffers them not to intend any other things, but every
hand while to reuiew themselves. He suffers punishment that expects it, and
he expects that has deserved it. It is possible, by some means, to be safe
with an ill conscience, but never secure. For he thinks he may be taken with
the manner, though yet he be not. In sleep he is troubled, and being awake, as
often as he names any man's wickedness, he thinks of his own. It never
seems enough blotted out, never sufficiently covered. A guilty conscience
has sometime the hap to be hid, but never Exemplo quodcunque malo committitur,
ipsi displicet authori, etc. Iuuen. Satyr. 13. Plut. Apoph.
assurance. So the Satyrist; Whatsoever crime is committed by evil example, it
first displeases the author. This is the first punishment, that no man guilty
can be absolved, himself being Judge, although by the favor of the corrupted
Judge he be acquitted. In which regard Cato was wont to say, that every man
ought to fear and respect himself most when he does any evil, because,
though he may shun others, yet from himself he cannot flee.

. Sect. 4 That conscience has all its power and authority from God only.
Now this power of conscience in judging, witnessing, binding, and punishing,
it has only from God which is the Lord of it, and has seated it in man as
his Viceroy and Deputy, to rule him in all his ways; and, if he will not
obey, to be his Notary, to keep upon record all his faults, his Witness to
give testimony against him, and his Executioner to torment him, when in the
Court of conscience he is condemned. Neither has any creature power over
conscience, either to bind it, or set it at liberty, but God only; nor has
the conscience it self any authority to execute these offices, till it have a
Commission engrossed and sealed from God, which is either the Law of nature,
written in the heart in our first creation, or the divine Oracles of God,
contained in the books of the Old and New Testament. And if without these,
conscience does any thing against us, either by unjust judging, or false
accusing, we may revoke it all by a Writ of error, and make our appeal from
this false judgment in the Court of conscience, to our supreme Lord, to be
judged by him according to his Law. For howsoever in the creation, conscience
was an upright Judge and true witness, yet after the fall, the understanding
being darkened with ignorance, and the judgment corrupted, do offer unto the
conscience false rules and Principles, and so cause it to give wrong evidence
and erroneous judgment, justifying when it should condemn, and condemning
when it should justify, excusing those whom it should accuse, and accusing
them whom the Law of God excuses and absolueth. The which comes to pass,
because the light of nature is through the fall almost extinguished, and the
book of the Law written, according to which, conscience should judge and
testify, is not understood and known, or because it is blinded by lusts and
passions, or being corrupted, has the mouth stopped with the bribes of worldly
vanities, or finally is become seared and senseless with customable sinning
and habitual wickedness.

CAP. XIII.
Of a good Conscience, which is a maine ground of a godly life; what it is, and
the causes of it.

. Sect. 1 What a good conscience is; and of the cause efficient which works it
in us.
IN which regard, conscience thus corrupted and disabled, cannot be a
sufficient ground of a godly life, till after our regeneration, it be renewed
and restored in some measure, unto that integrity and perfection which it had
in our first creation. And this we call good conscience, which is a maine
foundation of godliness, guiding and inabling us to the performance of all
good duties which God requires. In speaking whereof, we will first show what
it is, and then the causes of it, the effects and fruits which spring from it,
the properties and signs whereby we may know it, and the means by which we
may obtain it, if it be wanting; or preserve and keep it, if we already have
it. Concerning the first; A good conscience is that, which being renewed by
Gods Spirit, and a lively faith, applying unto us the virtue of Christ's death
and obedience, does speak peace, and truly testify unto us, according to the
Scriptures, that we are redeemed out of the hands of all our enemies,
reconciled unto God, justified, sanctified, and shall persevere in grace unto
salvation, and that all our actions are warranted by the Word, and accepted of
God in Jesus Christ, though in themselves imperfect; whereby we are comforted
in all things, made cheerful and diligent in Gods service, and willing to do
all things which may be pleasing unto him. The causes of a good conscience are
diverse. The principal efficient is God the Father, Son, and holy Spirit. The
Father bestows this gift upon us, who as in the beginning he first created,
and placed it in us, as an uncorrupted Judge, and impartial witness between
him and us; so it is he alone that does renew and repair the ruins thereof,
contracted through the fall of our first parents, by which, together with all
other faculties, conscience was corrupted, and either so deadded, seared, and
benumbed, that it had no sense and feeling at all; or when it awakened out of
this deadly swowne, did nothing but accuse and terrify us, or unjustly excuse
and encourage us in our sinful courses, by presenting unto us false comforts.

. Sect. 2 Of the meritorious cause of a good conscience.
The meritorious cause of it, is God the Son, and our Savior Jesus Christ,
who satisfying Gods justice, and appeasing his wrath by his death and
obedience, freed us from the guilt and punishment of our sins, reconciled us
unto God, and made our peace with him; upon which, follows peace of
conscience, and freedom from the accusations and terrors of it. For when by
the Law of God, or light of nature, it is set a-worke to Romans 8. 1, 33, 34.
affright and disquiet us in regard of our sins, then showing our pardon
sealed by the blood of Christ, it is calmed and quieted, having nothing to lay
to our charge, which Christ our surety has not satisfied for us. Whereof it is
that our Savior was prophetically named, The Prince of peace, and prefigured
under the type of Melchizedech, because he is not Esa. 9. 6.
only the King of righteousness, by whom we are justified, but also King of
Heb. 7. 2.
peace, as the Apostle speaks, who making our peace with God, did thereby
also procure for us peace of conscience. For the Judge has no authority to
condemn, nor the witness to accuse, nor the Iaylour to imprison, nor the
executioner to punish and torment, when the supreme Sovereign King of heaven
and earth, being satisfied by the sufferings of his Son, has sent us his
free pardon, and we have pleaded it in the Court of conscience: Yea, rather
the Judge does then acquit and absolve us, and the witness says nothing
against us, but as a messenger of good things, does testify unto us this
joyful tidings. And hence it is, that our Savior was no sooner borne unto us,
but the holy Angels were sent as Gods Heralds to proclaim this peace; Glory
be unto God in the highest, and in earth peace, good will toward men. The
which peace, our Savior Luke 2. 14.
wrought as a Mediator between God and us, by satisfying his justice, and
offering himself as an all-sufficient sacrifice for the sins of all his
elect. So the Apostle says, It pleased the Father, that in him should all
fullness dwell; And (having made peace through the blood of his Cross) by him
Col. 1. 19, 20.
to reconcile all things to himself. And elsewhere he affirms, that we were
without Christ, being alients from the Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers
Ephesians. 2. v. 12. to 18.
from the Covenant of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world;
but that now in Christ Jesus, we, who sometimes were far off, are made nigh
by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has
broken down the middle wall of partition between God and us; Having abolished
in his flesh the enmity, even the Law of Commandments contained in ordinances,
to make in himself of twain, one new man, so making peace: And that he might
reconcile both unto God, in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity
thereby: And came and preached peace unto us, both them which were a far off,
and to them that were nigh. And thus working our peace with God, he brought
also peace to our consciences, when as by his blood he had cleansed them from
the guilt and punishment of sin; for if the blood of Bulls and Goats,
sanctified to the outward purifying of the flesh, how much Heb. 9. 13, 14.
more shall the blood of Christ, who through his eternal Spirit, offered
himself without spot to God, purge our consciences from dead works, to serve
the living God? Finally, the conscience is renewed and sanctified by God the
holy Ghost, whilst he applies Christ and all his benefits, the virtue of his
death and precious blood, and makes them effectual for the purging of our
consciences from all sinful corruption, and spiritual defilements, that we
may be enabled to perform pure and acceptable service unto God.

. Sect. 3 Of the isntrumental causes of a good conscience.
For the effecting whereof, he uses as his instruments, the preaching of the
Gospel, and administration of the Sacraments, and a lively faith, which by
them both, made effectual by the inward operation of the Spirit, is begotten
and also confirmed and increased in us. First, the preaching of the Gospel is
the instrument which the Spirit uses, whereby a good conscience is wrought in
us; for when the Law preached, and the curse threatened, like a strange wind
and tempest, has rent the mountains, and broken in pieces the rocks of our
proud and hard hearts, and as the earthquake and fire, which Elias saw and
felt, has terrified the conscience with the guilt of sin, and caused us to
hide our faces from Gods presence, 1. King. 19. 11, 12
then the still voice of the Gospel, causing these storms to cease, does
quiet and calm the conscience, so as we can without terror, yea with much
joy and comfort, hear the voice of God speaking peace, and offering unto us
reconciliation, grace, and salvation in Jesus Christ, assuring us upon the
condition of a lively faith, bringing forth the fruits thereof in unfeigned
repentance, that all Gods gracious promises, respecting this life and the life
to come, do belong unto us. In which regard it is called glad tidings, which
cause, even the very feet of those that bring them, Romans 10. 15. John. 14. 27.
to seem beautiful unto us; and the Gospel of peace, which Christ himself
first preached. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the
Ephesians. 2. 17. Luke 10. 5. 2. Cor. 5. 20.
world gives, give I unto you: Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
be afraid. And when he had reconciled us unto God by his Cross, and slain
enmity thereby; he came also and preached this peace unto us: And afterward
sent his Disciples as his Heralds to proclaim it, to all who by faith received
it, yea as his Ambassadors to beseech us, in his stead, to be reconciled unto
God. By which means when the peace of a good conscience is begun in us, it
is thereby more and more confirmed and increased; as also by the use of the
Sacraments, which being as seals annexed to the covenant of grace, do
confirm our faith in God promises, and so work peace and joy in our
consciences, out of this assurance that Christ and all his benefits are ours,
and that we in him are reconciled unto God.

. Sect. 4 That a good conscience springs from a lively faith.
For neither the Gospel, nor the Sacraments, no nor yet Christ himself, will
bring unto us this peace of conscience, unless we receive and Heb. 5. 2.
apply them by the hand of faith: as the best salve will not heal, unless it
be applied to the wound, nor meat nourish us, unless it be received into the
stomach; nor the purest water purge us from our filth, unless we be washed in
it. But when this precious balsam is applied to our wounded consciences, and
when by the hand of faith they are washed in the Lauer of his precious blood,
then they are healed of the sores of sin, and being rified from the guilt,
punishment, and power of it, do speak peace unto us, and are the messengers of
such joyful tidings as cannot be damped with any worldly tribulation.
According to that of the Apostle, Being justified by faith, we have peace with
God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we Romans 5. 1, 2, 3.
have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of
the glory of God; And not only so; but we glory in tribulation also, etc.
Whereof it is, that in the Scriptures, faith and a good conscience, are as the
1. Tim. 1. 19.
cause and effect joined together, so that one of them cannot miscarry in the
storm of tentations, but we shall make shipwreck of them both, and, together
with our faith, lose both our peace with God, and our peace of conscience.
Whereas our assurance of faith will embolden us to drawneere to the Throne of
Gods grace, with a true heart, having our hearts sprinkled Heb. 10. 22.
from an evil conscience, and our souls washed with pure water. But yet we
must take heed, that we do not attribute that to the instrument, which is
peculiar to the principal cause, nor imagine that faith, by any virtue that is
in it self, does purify our consciences, or work peace in them. For this it
can no more do, then the hand it self can cure a sore by touching it, or
nourish the body, and keep it warm, without food or clothes, though it be the
instrument to apply and put them on: but it is only our good Jonas, which,
being cast into the raging Sea of our troubled consciences, makes them clean
and still; it is the wood of his Cross alone, that is, the virtue of his death
and passion, which being cast into these waters embitterd with the guilt of
sin, that can make them to yield unto us the sweet and pleasant waters of
joy and consolation: Although he will do no more good to pacify the storms,
and sweeten the bitter torments of a raging conscience, if he be not applied by
a lively faith, then Jonas in the ship, or the branches still growing upon the
tree, and not at all cast into the tempestuous Sea, and bitter waters.

CAP. XIIII.
Of the actions and effects of a good Conscience; of the peace which it truly
speaks; and how it differs from the false peace of secure worldlings.

. Sect. 1 That a good conscience speaks goodness and peace only.
ANd so much of the causes of a good conscience, both principal and
isntrumental. The next point to be considered, is the actions and effects of
it, which are to speak peace, and to testify unto us truly, and according to
the Scriptures, good and comfortable things; as a Judge acquitting and
absoluing us; as an advocate pleading for us; as a witness excusing and giving
evidence on our side; and as a sure and faithful friend, admonishing us that
we may not fall; or rebuking us being fallen, that we may rise again by
unfeigned repentance. Where we are to consider, what the conscience witnesses;
and secondly the rule, according to which it gives testimony. The things
which the good conscience speaks and witnesses, are goodness and peace
only; neither is it the action of a good conscience properly, to accuse and
terrify us for sin; but to speak peace unto us, and to justify us as
righteous; not in our own natural righteousness, but in the righteousness of
Christ applied by faith, which is most pure and perfect; and in our
sanctification and inherent righteousness wrought in us by the renewing of the
holy Ghost, which is but begun, spotted, and imperfect in this life, but yet is
growing toward purity and perfection, and in the mean while has the
imperfections covered with Christ's perfect righteousness, and the spots and
staynes of it washed away in his blood. So that the good conscience is the
peaceable conscience only, which witnesses good things unto us, as most
nearly resembling the conscience of Adam in the first Creation, whilst he
remained in the state of innocence, which only justified him and his actions,
and thereby comforted and strengthened him in Gods service; and never accused
or terrified him before his fall, because he was pure and free from all taynt
of sin, unto which purity of Creation, lost by transgression, the holy Ghost
renews the conscience by degrees, unto the highest whereof it attaineth, when
casting to accuse and terrify us, it justifies and excuses us before Gods
Tribunal; being then most good and perfect, when as it is most quiet and
peaceable; so as we can say with Paul, I have lived in all good Acts 23 1.
conscience before God, until this day, namely, from the time of my first
effectual calling and conversion.

. Sect. 2 That a good conscience speaks peace according to the truth of Gods
Word.
But here the carnal worldling and loose Libertine will take occasion to
presume, that above all others, they have the best consciences, because they
seldom or never accuse them, or if they do, yet they can easily put them to
silence; they were never in their lives troubled with any horrors and fears;
but have had their consciences ever quiet and peaceable, witnessing good things
unto them, as that their sins are pardoned, they highly in Gods favor, and
shall most certainly attain unto salvation. But for preventing of this, we
have added in the description of a good conscience, that it does not only
witness peaceable and good things, but also that it does give true testimony
of them. So that if we would have good consciences, they must not be erroneous
in their evidence, but peace and truth must be matched together. And because
they who most err, are ready with the best to brag of truth, as well as of
peace, therefore I also added the Rule and Touchstone, whereby all divine truth
is to be tried, namely, when it agrees with the truth of God revealed in the
Scriptures. For conscience (as I have said) is a witness with God, testifying
that which he also testifyeth; and therefore when it does excuse them whom God
excuses, and secretly whispereth peace to them, unto whom in his Word he has
proclaimed it, then is its testimony true, and truly comfortable. But when it
offers peace to them against whom he has proclaimed war, and excuses
them as good subjects, whom his Word condemns of high treason and wicked
rebellion, then is the testimony of conscience false and erroneous, and can be
no good ground of any sound consolation. And in this case, conscience is a
traitor both to God and us, renouncing his service and that office which he
has imposed upon it, and joining with the enemies of our salvation, to
dishonor him in our destruction. For it mayntaineth a false peace, by giving
us false intelligence, telling us that we are in safety, when as we lie open to
all danger; that we are strong and well fortified against all assaults, when as
we are naked and have upon no part of the spiritual armor, and like a false
Sinon, it testifies that our spiritual enemies are quite departed, whereas
they lie in secret ambushment, ready to assault and surprise us, when by
believing this false intelligence, we are secure, and neglecting the spiritual
watch, give our selves over to worldly delights.

. Sect. 3 The difference betwixt the peace of a good and bad conscience, as
first, that the peace of the wicked proceeds from ignorance of their estate.
Every conscience therefore is not good which is peaceable, but that which
speaks peace in truth; not according to our ignorant conceits, blinded with
pride and self-love, or presumptuous opinions which have no sound ground, but
when it is squared by the perfect and infallible rule of the holy Scriptures,
whereby we may discern, whether that inward peace which we feel in us,
proceeds from a good or a bad conscience. For there are many things by
corrupting and defiling the conscience, and making it worse, and more dead and
senseless, then it is in it own nature, which make it (at least for time)
quiet and peaceable. As first, ignorance of God and his will, which
hood-winking the conscience, gives the devil fit opportunity to carry it
quickly whither he will, and like a thick fogge, and darkness of the night,
depriving us of light and sight, does cause us to err into the by-ways of
sin, whilst we think that we are in that perfect path of righteousness
that leads to Gods Kingdom. As we see in Paul's example, who in the time of
his ignorance, Romans 7. 7, 8, 9.
thought concupiscence to be no sin, which after he was enlightened with the
knowledge of the truth, he discerned to be the root and fountain of all
wickedness. And whilst his judgment was thus blinded, his conscience spoke
peace unto him, testifying that he was alive and in good case, when as being
truly informed, he plainly saw that he was dead, and in the high way that
leads to hell. Such have not their peace disturbed by conscience, because,
being ignorant of the way, it cannot admonish them when they go out of it, and
being it self misinformed, it must needs give unto them false evidence. And
though their hearts be full of sluttish corners, and even deep dungeons full
of all filthiness, yet the eye of conscience does not discern any annoyance,
because it is in the dark, and is not illightened with the knowledge of Gods
truth. But especially this comes to pass, when as ignorance is not only
simple and natural, but embraced and affected, men purposely neglecting, yea,
contemning and shunning the means of knowledge, because for their greater
quietness, they would not have conscience to take notice of their ways. As
they who bless themselves in their good meanings, as sufficient to salvation,
and wholly neglecting Gods true service, do content themselves with their own
blind devotion and superstition. Such shun those places where the light of the
Gospel shines, and like Battes and Owls, delight to live in dark corners,
where they seldom or never hear a Sermon, because they delight in the works
of darkness. They hate the light of Gods truth, because their works are
evil, as our Savior speaks; and as the thief and adulterer wait for the
twy-light, and Ioh. 3. 20.
make choice of the night, as fittest for their purposes, hating the morning as
the shadow of death, because it discovers their faults to others, and
brings them in danger to be apprehended, condemned, and executed. So these
affect the darkness of ignorance, and abhor the light of truth, Job 24 15,
16.
because they would not have conscience to take notice of their wickedness,
lest, like Gods Sergeant, it should arrest and hale them before his Tribunal,
and there, as an impartial witness, give evidence against them, and lest,
being condemned, it should play the executioner, tormenting and vexing them,
day and night with hellish horrors, and deep despair.

. Sect. 4 The peace of a good conscience proceeds from spiritual life: of an
evil, from senselessness and deadness.
Secondly, peace of conscience does often proceed, not from spiritual life and
motion, knowing and doing Gods will, but from the clean contrary, as from
spiritual deadness, idleness and sloth in performing those duties which God
requires. For as when the body is dead, it has no sense of sickness, wounds,
or any hurt which can be done unto it: so when the soul is dead in sin, the
conscience has no feeling of any weight that lies upon it, nor of any wounds
or sores of sin, wherewith it is mangled and deformed. And though corruption
and guilt, like a gangrene, indangereth it, even unto the very death, yet it
never complains, because it has no sense and feeling of this mischief and
misery. Besides, whilst men snort in this lethargy of sin, the devil never
wakeneth nor disquieteth them, because he knows that this temporary rest
will end in restless torments; and that the disturbing them of this ease may
happen to awake them; and so having a sense of their disease, may work a
desire and resolution to use all means whereby they may be cured. Neither will
it stand with his policy, to let them, who are in his thraldom, and ready
with all cheerfulness to do his will, come unto a sight and sense of their
misery, which might make them desirous to come out of it; and therefore he
never terrifieth their consciences with his tentations, but rather more
blinds their eyes, that they may not see their woeful state, and stops
their mouths, that they may not complain of it. And so our flesh and carnal
corruptions are quiet, and never go about to disturb our peace, whilst we
suffer them to live and reign in us: but when we go about to depose them from
their regencie, and like slaves, to bring them in subjection, then they rebel,
and taking arms against the part regenerate, make us feel the vprores and
garboyles of a civil and intestine war. Thus corrupt humors in the body,
though they endanger our lives, yet oftentimes are scarce discerned before they
be moved; but when we stir them with some wholesome potion, which serves
to purge us of them, then they rage and make us more sick in our own sense
then we were before. Thus the sea it self is calm and quiet, when there is no
wind to move it, but in the time of a storm it rages and roareth, as if it
would at once swallow up the earth. And thus gunpowder is quiet and harmless
when it is let alone: but if a spark of fire fall into it, it blows up all
that is near unto it. And so sin and corruption, if it be let alone, will be
so quiet, that it will never disturb our peace: but if we seek to purge it
out by wholesome medicines, or if it be touched with the fire of Gods Spirit,
or but even blown upon with the breath of admonition and rebuke, out of the
mouths of Gods faithful Ministers, then the Sea is no more raging in a
stream, nor gunpowder more clamorous and unruly when the fire is put unto it.
Moreover, spiritual sloth and idleness does oftentimes keep the conscience
which is most corrupted, in peace and quiet, because it makes us neglect all
spiritual exercises which should awaken it, and bring it to some sense and
feeling. As hearing the Word, reading, meditating of our wants and weakness,
the foulness and deformity of sin, the fearfulness of Gods Judgments,
the curse and threatenings of the Law, the daily examination of our estates, by
the strict rule of Gods Word, which are the means, both to cast out the strong
man out of his quiet possession, and to disturb the peace of an ill
conscience, which arises not from any sound security, but rather from want of
spiritual exercise: herein like unto a lame horse, which complains not of his
lamenesse whilst he lies at ease, but when by travel he becomes sensible of
his pain, he cannot endure it, but halteth down right.

. Sect. 5 The third difference between a good and evil conscience.
A third cause of peace to an ill conscience, is carnal security, which does
not take away the guilt and punishment of sin, but only serves as the
devils cradle, to rock us asleep, that we may have no sense and feeling of
it. Whereof it fares with us, as with men sick of dangerous diseases, whose
sleep brings not health, but a cessation of pain, through the binding up of
the senses, who, after they are awakened, do feel themselves more sick then
before. And as it brings us asleep in sin, so the devil and our corrupt
flesh do by it lull conscience a sleep also, lest being disquieted, it should
disquiet us, and waken us with clamor and crying: And intending to sack the
city of our souls, he makes the Watch man drunk with this poisonous and
intoxicating cup, that he may not sound the alarm, nor give us any warning to
prepare for resistance. Now this security being continued and increased,
grows at last to hardness of heart, in the highest and worst degree, which
neglects and contemns all means whereby it might be softened, and to a
reprobate sense, carrying men on in the course of sinning with greediness and
delight. And when they are come to this pass, their consciences also increase
in their carnal peace, their deep sleep causing a lethargy, and their
lethargy death. Such consciences, from a sleepie numnesse, fall into a dead
palsy, having no sense of sin or smart; unto which they grow, by often
quenching the good motions of the Spirit, speaking unto them in the ministry
of the Word, and by customable committing of known sins, without repentance
or remorse. For as festring sores, not cleansed by salues and corrosiues,
quickly gangrene, and running from part to part, destroy the whole body; so if
we do not cleanse our sores of sin, by renewing our faith and repentance,
they will corrupt the whole man, even conscience it self, and make it become
dead and senseless. Such are the consciences of those, of whom the Apostle
speaks, who departing from the faith, and speaking lies in hypocrisy, have
1. Tim. 4. 1, 2.
their consciences seared with an hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding
to abstain from meats, which God has ordained to be received with
thanksgiving. And such had the Gentiles, who were given over of God to their
vile affections, and a reprobate mind, to commit sin Romans 1. 26, 28.
without check and remorse, yea with greediness and delight.

. Sect. 6 The last cause of the peace of an evil conscience, is worldly
employments.
Finally, the conscience is made quiet, and at peace, when men are wholly taken
with worldly vanities, both in their hearts and affections doting upon them,
and in their actions and employments in seeking after them. For Satan, seeing
conscience placed in man by God, as his Deputy and Viceroy to govern him, as
his Judge to absolve or condemn him, and as a witness, to give evidence of
all his particular actions, and having no power to depose it, or to put it out
of its place and office, does labor by all means to pervert and corrupt it,
that it either may be silent, or give unjust judgment and false evidence. And
to this purpose, he offers worldly honors, riches, and pleasures, that by
these bribes he may stop the mouth of conscience, so as it may either say
nothing, or speak as he would have it: And with Satan joins the world and
our own flesh; for no sooner does conscience begin to awaken out of the sleep
of security, and to stir and move, speaking something that concerns its
office (as it were) between sleeping and waking, but presently they endeavor
all they can to bring it asleep again, by rocking it in the cradle of worldly
prosperity, and singing unto it the bewitching songs of carnal pleasures. And
if conscience will needs start up and be meddling, either accusing or
condemning them for sin, or terrifying and tormenting them with the guilt and
punishments due unto it; then do they corrupt this Judge and witness with
carnal pleasures; and when they cannot be rid of their Iaylour, but they
must needs go abroad under his custody, they will make him drunk with these
alluring cups of worldly delights, that they may have more liberty to do what
they list, without check and controulement. And thus when conscience grows
melancholy through the neglect of duty, they cheer it again, that it may
still go on with them in carnal courses, by feasting and reuelling, music
and merry company, sporting and gaming, jesting and wanton dalliance,
sttage-playes, unchaste sonnets, and pleasant histories. And if,
notwithstanding all these, conscience stirs and begins to speak, then
does the world give such a Plaudite to these pastimes, and the flesh entertain
them with so loud an outcry of clamorous lusts and passions, that the voice of
conscience being quite drowned, it becomes silent, because it speaks to no
purpose. And thus also conscience is sometimes at ease and peace, through
worldly cares and employments, in compassing these earthly things: for having
their hearts wholly set upon these vain objects, and all their actions and
endeavors taken up in these exercises and employments, conscience is silent,
because they have no leisure to attend what it says, choosing rather to say
nothing, then to speak much to little purpose.

CAP. XV.
Of the good things which a good Conscience witnesses to the faithful.

. Sect. 1 The first thing which it witnesses, is pardon of our sins and
reconciliation with God.
ANd so much generally of the matter which a good conscience testifies,
namely, peace and good things, and of the manner how it gives witness, to
wit, truly, and according to the rule of Gods Word, wherein the peace which it
brings diversely, differs from the peace of an ill conscience. Now we are to
speak more particularly of the good things whereof it gives evidence, and of
the fruit and benefit which arises from it. First, it witnesses unto us
truly, and according to the rule of Gods Word, that all our sins are
pardoned, and we reconciled unto God; not by any satisfaction which our selves
have made, or any worthiness in us, for which God should accept us above
others; but only out of our assurance of faith, which persuades us, that God,
of his free grace and mercy, for the alone merits and satisfaction of Jesus
Christ, has forgiven us all our sins, and accepts of us in the face of his
best Mat. 3. 17.
Beloved, in whom only he is well pleased: upon which ground, a good conscience
gives comfortable evidence, not only when we please our selves in the sight
and sense of Gods graces in us, and in our cheerful obedience and best
services which we perform to God: but also when we see and feel our
corruptions, and imperfections, our slips, falls, and manifold faylings in our
best actions: Because it gives evidence, according to the assurance of faith,
which is grounded on Gods mercies and Christ's merits, and not upon our works
and worthiness, and therefore cannot be overthrown by our wants and
weaknesses, our corruptions and unworthiness. In which respect, the Apostle
says, that baptism does save us (not the putting away of the filth of the
flesh, but the answer of a good 1. Pet. 3. 21.
conscience toward God) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Which answer is
nothing but this, that when Gods justice and the Law lays sin to our
charge, and requires obedience, the conscience gives in evidence, that
Christ, by his death and resurrection, has made full satisfaction, and in our
stead, has done all which was required of us.

. Sect. 1 That a good conscience witnesses unto us our sanctification.
And as the conscience thus bears witness of our justification, and
reconciliation, so also of our sanctification, namely, that being freed from
sin, we are become servants of righteousness, and not only delivered from
the guilt and punishment of finne, but also from the corruption, power, and
dominion of it, so that though it dwell in us, as a traiterous slave, yet it
does not reign and rule in us, as in times past. And though we be not wholly
freed from all relics of sin and corruption, nor can perform unto God that
perfect obedience which the Law requires; yet our consciences give in evidence
with us, that we are in part sanctified, and shall in Gods good time have this
work thoroughly perfected, and that in the mean while, we hate the evil we
do, and love the good we do not, delighting in the Law of God in the inner
man, even when we Romans 7. 15.
are led captive unto sin; that we desire and resolve to please God in all
things, and endeavor in the use of all good means, to have our desires
satisfied; and consequently, that we perform that Evangelical obedience which
God requires, and are through Christ accepted of him. In which regard we may
say with Paul, from the time of our effectual calling, that we have lived with
all good conscience until this day. Again, a good conscience is our warrant
for all our actions, testifying unto us, that what we Act. 23. 1.
have done, and are about to do, is commanded of God, whereby we are comforted
in those duties which we have performed, and encouraged to proceed in
well-doing, because we do not our own will, but the will of God. And though
our actions be imperfect in themselves, yet being done in sincerity and with
upright hearts, we shall not be discouraged in the sight and sense of our
imperfections, yea, rather we shall find cause of rejoicing and glorying in
them, because being done with a good conscience, it will justify and give
witness unto us, that we are also justified and approved of God, and have
both our persons and works accepted of him through Jesus Christ; according to
that of the Apostle John, If our heart condemn us not, then have we
confidence toward God. And this 1. Job. 3. 21.
made the Apostle Paul most gladly to glory in his infirmities, which otherwise
in themselves would have been a cause of grief and mourning; and 2. Cor. 12.
9.
to rejoice in the conscience of his well-doing, which in respect of the
imperfections even of his best actions, would have filled his face with
blushing, and his heart with shame. Our rejoicing (says he) is this, the
testimony 2. Cor. 1. 12.
of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world.

. Sect. 2 That a good conscience witnesses unto us that we are in all estates
blessed.
Moreover a good conscience testifies unto us, that we are through Christ in
an happy and blessed estate, both in respect of the time present and to come.
In respect of the present, a good conscience will make us bear and brook all
estates, not only with patience, but also with comfort and joy in the holy
Ghost. If we be in prosperity, and abound with Gods blessings, it warranteth
unto us the lawful use of them, and witnesses unto us that we are heirs and
right owners, and not thieues and usurpers; that they are Gods talents, which
being employed to advantage, for Luke 19. 17. Matthew. 25. 21.
the glory of our great Lord, and good of our fellow servants, they shall be
doubled and redoubled, when we are called to give account of them; that they
are pledges of Gods favor in this life, and earnest-pennies of everlasting joy
and happiness in the life to come. If we be in adversity and affliction, a
good conscience, like the good Angel, holding us by the hand in this fiery
furnace, will secure us that we shall not receive any harm. For it will
testify unto us, that these curses in their own nature, are through Gods
mercy turned into blessings; that they are testimonies of Gods love, seeing as
many as he loves, he chastizeth, and signs of our Apoc. 3. 19.
adoption, for the Lord corrects every son that he receives: and they are
Heb 12. 6. Romans 8. 37, 38.
bastards and no sons whom he corrects not. That they will not separate
Gods love from us, but our love from the world. That they are not poisons to
kill us, but medicines to cure us of our spiritual diseases; fannes, and
files, and fires, to winnow us from our chafe, scowre us from our rust, and
purify us from the dross of our corruptions. Finally, that whatsoever they
seem to flesh and blood, yet they shall work together for the best, Romans 8.
28.
to them that love God; and that though they be bitter and unpleasant, for the
present, yet they shall bring forth the quiet fruits of righteousness, to
Heb. 12. 11.
them that are exercised thereby. In respect of the time to come, a good
conscience does give unto us truly, and according to the Scriptures, this
comfortable and joyful evidence, that we shall continue ever to be holy and
happy, perseuering to the end in Gods grace unto salvation; not by virtue of
our own strength, but through the power and promises of God. For he has
assured us, that he will put his fear in our hearts, that we may Ier. 32. 40.
not depart from him. That though we have many fierce Wolves to assault us, and
be but silly weak Sheep, unable to make resistance, yet our Shepherd Christ,
being infinitely stronger then they, none shall be able to pull Ioh. 10. 28.
Ioh. 13. 1. Ier. 31. 3.
us out of his hand. That whom God loves, he loves with an everlasting love,
and to the end; that the gifts and calling of God are without repentance; and
finally, that though we be many ways tried, yet the Lord will never suffer 1.
Cor. 10. 13.
us to be tempted above our power, but will give a good end and issue to all
our tentations.

. Sect. 3 That a good conscience makes us cheerful in Gods service.
Lastly, a good conscience makes us cheerful and diligent in Gods Esa. 30.
21. 1. Ioh. 2. 27.
service, and willing to do all things which are pleasing in his sight. So the
Prophet speaking of the faithful, says, that they should hear a voice behind
them, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right
hand, and when ye turn to the left: That is, besides their outward teaching in
the Ministry of the Word, they should have an inward teacher to direct and
admonish them, even the Spirit of God, speaking unto them in the heart and
conscience. And this is that which David means, where he says, that his
reins did teach him in the night season, that is, the voice Psalm. 16. 7.
of conscience, which did show him the ways of God, and moved him with
cheerfulness to walk in them. The which is the maine end at which the
conscience aims, in witnessing and sealing unto us all the former comforts.
For therefore the conscience gives unto us that comfortable testimony, that
we are delivered out of the hands of all our spiritual Luke 1. 74.
enemies, to the end that we should not still serve them, but worship our Lord
and Redeemer, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our
lives; that he has bought us at so dear a price, that we should glorify him
1. Cor. 6. 20.
in our soul and body, because they are not our own, but his, who has
redeemed them; that we are freed from sin, that it may no longer reign in
Romans 6. 12, 18.
our mortal body, but being delivered out of this cruel tyranny, we should
become the servants of righteousness; that our consciences are purged from
Heb. 9. 14.
dead works, that we may serve the living God; that we are reconciled unto
God, by the death and sufferings of Christ, that we may above all things
esteem our peace with him, which was so dearly purchased, and not be enticed
with the hire of the whole world, to do any thing displeasing unto God, or
which might break or disturb our peace with him, seeing this were to
undervalue this inestimable price, as being of less worth then worldly
vanities, and to tread the precious blood of Christ under our filthy Heb. 10.
26, 29.
feet, as an unholy thing, and even to despite the Spirit of grace with which
we are sanctified. Therefore it witnesses unto us, that we are sanctified,
that we may be made careful to bring forth the fruits of sanctification to
his glory, that has called us out of darkness, into this marvelous 1. Pet.
2. 9.
light, and out of the bondage of sin and Satan, into the glorious liberty of
the sons of God. That though our sanctification be imperfect, and Romans 8. 21.
stained with many corruptions, yet through Christ it is accepted of God, to
this end, that we might be made more cheerful and diligent, in serving so
gracious a Lord. For what greater encouragement can there be unto us, in the
performance of all good duties, then to be assured, that our labor of love
shall not be lost, and that whatsoever we do, shall be taken in good part and
richly rewarded, though never so imperfect, if we desire and endeavor to do
the best we can? Finally, a good conscience gives unto us this comfortable
testimony, that we are most happy in all estates; that no estate, though never
so much crossed and afflicted, may discourage us from going on in the ways of
godliness, seeing no misery can make us miserable, but even our afflictions
themselves shall advance our happiness, and that we shall never lose either
grace or glory, but constantly hold out in the Christian race of godliness and
righteousness, until we be crowned with the Garland of blessedness; that we
may not be discouraged with the sense of our weakness and weariness, nor
with the assaults of our spiritual enemies who encounter us in the way, seeing
fighting Ephesians. 6. 10.
against them, not in our own strength, but in the power of Gods might, we are
sure of support to hold out in the fight, and have his neuer-fayling promise of
obtaining victory.

CAP. XVI.
Of the signs and properties of a good Conscience.

. Sect. 1 The first sign are the causes of it.
THe next point to be considered, is the signs whereby we may discern whether
we have a good conscience, or no; that if 2. Cor. 1. 12.
we have, we may with Paul rejoice in it, if not, we may labor to obtain
this precious jewel. Besides therefore these signs, which by the diligent
Reader may be easily gathered out of the former discourse, there are diverse
others which may be added. And first, if we have a good conscience, we may
discern it by the causes of it; for it is not the work of nature, which by
the fall was corrupted in this, as in all other faculties; but the free gift of
God; not purchased by our own merits, not purged from natural defilements
with our own satisfactions, but purified from dead works by the precious
blood of Christ, Heb. 9. 14.
applied unto us by his holy Spirit and a lively faith. And therefore if we
feel no change in our consciences, but that they still remain the same which
they always were; if they be not washed with the blood of Christ, which
purges them, not only from the guilt of sin, but also from dead works, that
we may serve the living God; or if their purity and peace proceed from any
thing then from this, that being bathed in this fountain Zach. 13. 1.
opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin
and for uncleanness, they are assured that their sins are pardoned, and
shall never be imputed nor laid to their charge; if they be not purified by
faith, which both assures us of salvation, and also works by love; but Gal.
5. 6.
are grounded alone upon groundless presumption; it is clear and manifest,
that we deceive our selves with a shadow, and have not yet attained to a good
conscience.

. Sect. 2 The second sign is taken from the manner of working this good
conscience.
The second sign, is the manner of working this good conscience. For it is not
wrought by worldly persuasions, taken from our credit, pleasure, or profit, but
by the ministry of the Word, begetting faith in us, whereby the heart and
conscience is purified. And this it does first, by terrifying it with the sight
and sense of our sins, and the punishments due unto them, whereby we are
humbled, and brought to despair of our own strength, for our recovery out of
our misery; and then by pacifying and comforting it, by offering unto us in
Christ the free pardon of our sins, reconciliation with God, and the eternal
salvation of our souls. So that here the saying is truly verified, that
peace is the daughter of war; for if our consciences have had no conflict
with Gods justice, and the curse of the Law, and have not been truly humbled
in the sense of his wrath, and the enmity which has been between him and
us, our peace is carnal and corrupt, springing not from assurance of faith,
but from security and presumption, which have caused this ease, not by
recovery of health, but through the numnesse and stupidity of the disease.

. Sect. 3 That a good conscience is known by the effects of it.
Thirdly, a good conscience is known by the effects; for it excuses and
acquitteth us before God of all sin, and speaks peace unto our hearts,
assuring us that we are reconciled, and in Gods favor: and grounding this
testimony upon the infallible truth of holy Scriptures; It makes us bold in
all dangers, and like armor of proof, it contemns the gunshot of any
worldly perils. It makes us courageous in the performance of all good duties,
and not greatly to care who likes or misliketh them, because we carry our
warrant in our bosoms, which will justify our actions before God, what
censure soever men pass of them. It makes us like good servants, to come
often into our Masters presence, because it witnesses unto us, that we are in
his favor, and that he accepts of us and our service. It makes us often to
examine the book of our accounts, even in the presence of our Lord, and to
desire him to survey our reckonings, because it testifies unto us that we have
dealt faithfully with him. So David, Examine me, O Lord, and prove me, try my
reins and my heart. After Psalm. 26. 2.
which Audit, it will justify us in respect of our integrity, as it did him.
Thou have proved mine heart, thou have visited me in the night, thou have
tried me, and shall find nothing: Not in respect of the perfection of our
performance, Psalm. 17. 3.
which is full of wants and weaknesses, but of our desire and resolution, as
he expounds himself in the next words: For I am purposed that my mouth shall
not transgress. If therefore our consciences produce these Psalm. 130. 3. and
143. 2.
effects in us, it is an evident sign that they are pure and peaceable. But if
contrariwise they accuse and terrify us, or excuse and acquit us without the
warrant of Gods Word; If we are bold and valiant in our peace and prosperity,
fearing no evil, but cowardly timorous when we are incountred with any danger;
If we are so courageous in evil, that we are not ashamed, though men hear us
talk wantonly and vainly, or see us in our actions imitate the greatest
number, though unlawful and without warrant: but are ready to blush if a good
speech has slipped from us in bad company, or if we be overtaken at unawares
in performing some religious duty, by such as are ready to flowt us for it; If
we care not how little we come into Gods presence, and seldom or never
examine the book of our accounts between us and him, or else slightly and
ouertly for form and fashion sake, and like unfaithful factors, cannot endure
to have our Master audit our reckonings; then are our consciences defiled, and
can give no true testimony of peace unto us.

. Sect. 4 That a good conscience is known by the properties of it, as first,
that it is pure and peaceable.
Fourthly, a good conscience is known by the properties of it. First, as it is
peaceable, so also it is pure, not only from the guilt of sin, but Heb. 9.
14.
also from the corruption. For the blood of Christ, as it does like a
sovereign salve pacify the rage of conscience, caused by the sores of sin,
so does it draw out the corrupt matter that causes it, clensing these wounds,
as fast as it heals them; and as it saves us from this body of death, as the
Apostle calls it, so does it purge it from dead works, that we may serve the
living God. And therefore if our consciences be thus purged, then are they
truly pacified. But if they witness unto us that we live still in sin, and
so purpose to do for the time to come, and yet testify that we are in Gods
favor, and have our part in Christ and his benefits, they are evil and lying
consciences, and give in false evidence, expressly contrary to the Esa. 48. 22.
testimony of God, who being Truth it self, has said, that there is no such
peace to the wicked.

. Sect. 5 That a good conscience keeps it self clear before God and men.
Secondly, it is the property of a good conscience, with all care and
circumspection to keep it self clear both before God and men; before God,
from faultiness and sin; before men, from offensiuenesse and all appearance
of evil. According to the example of the Apostle, Who herein Act. 24. 16.
exercised himself, to have always his conscience void of offense, toward
God and toward men. So that a good conscience thinks it not sufficient, to
Conscientia necessaria est tibi: fama proximo tuo. Qui fidens conscientiae
suae, negligit famam suam, crudelis est. Aug. ad fratr. in Eremo. Sermon. 52.
Pro. 22. 1. Eccles. 7. 1. Duo sunt tibi necessaria, conscientia and fama:
conscientia propter Deum, fama propter proximum. Ambros. 1. Cor. 4. 3, 4.
have Gods approbation with contempt of man's, when as they will lawfully stand
together: for it is an offense in our neighbors, when they give false
testimony of us, and an offense to them, when we make them to stumble by our
evil example, drawing them on to the practice of that evil, the appearance
whereof they see in us; from both which, Christian charity should restrain us.
Yea it is hurtful also unto our selves in losing our good name, which is to be
pteferred before riches; and though we keep this precious ointment for our
inward comfort, yet we lose the benefit of that beauty, which it outwardly
causes, and the sweet odor of it, at least so far forth as we have it
reflected upon us by others commendation. Much less does it rest contented
with man's approbation, when it is disallowed of God: for when they can say no
evil of us, nor we by our selves, yet are we not thereby justified, seeing it
is the Lord that judges us, who is greater then our hearts; and therefore as
it desires man's approbation, so only thus far forth as it will stand with
Gods allowance, according to the example of the Apostle, who commended himself
to every man's conscience, in 2. Cor. 4. 2.
the sight of God. And if we thus do, then have we a sure sign of a good
conscience: but if when we give just offense, we justify our selves by
pleading a good conscience, and so say and think, that we do not care what
men say or conceive of our actions; or if (like hypocrites) we approve our
selves and our consciences to men, by a fair show in our outward behavior,
and neglecting the Judgment of God, nourish in our hearts secret corruptions,
we discover a bad conscience, and both sin against God, our neighbors, and
our selves.

. Sect. 6 That a good conscience knows it self to be so.
Thirdly, it is the property of a good conscience, not to be doubtful and
wavering, whether it be so or no, but being so, it knows assuredly Heb. 13.
18.
that it is so, and sees it self by its own light: According to that of the
Apostle, We trust, or are assured that we have a good conscience, in all things
willing to live honestly. And this confidence of it self, makes it confident
and courageous against all dangers, and bearing witness to us that God is Romans
8. 31.
with us, it makes us not to care greatly who oppose against us. So the
Wiseman says, that the righteous man is bold as a Lion, because his conscience
justifying him, does also bear witness that he is justified and approved
Pro. 28. 1.
of God, and being in his favor, is under his protection, who is both able and
willing to preserve him against all evil; according to that of the Apostle;
Hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our 1. Ioh. 3. 19,
20, 21
hearts before him. For if our heart (that is, our conscience) condemn us, God
is greater then our heart, and knows all things; but if our heart condemn us
not, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive
of him, because we keep his Commandment, and do those things that are
pleasing in his sight. Neither does the true fear of God, which is always
Pro. 28. 13.
in the faithful, hinder, but much confirm and strengthen this confidence,
seeing it is not servile but filial; and when we fear most in the sight and
sense of our frailty and corruption, then are we most assured that we shall
Ier. 31. 33, 34.
never depart from God, nor he from us, and so shall most firmly stand,
through his power assisting and upholding us.

. Sect. 7 That a good conscience makes us merry and cheerful.
Fourthly, it is the property of a good conscience, to make those that have it
merry, cheerful, and full of joy. It is a pleasant sauce, which makes all
our meats delightful, and whatsoever our cheer be, good Pro. 15. 15, 17.
conscience, if it be our companion, will make it a feast, and fill our heart
with such joy, that a sallad of cold herbs shall be better unto us, then a
stalled Ox, or the greatest dainties, that wealth and wit can provide for
wanton worldlings. It will make the hardest lodging, a bed of down; and the
poorest cottage more pleasant, then the most stately Palace, to them who have
not this inmate to harbor with them. It is (like sugar) sweet in it self,
and sweeteneth all things that are mixed with it, and such a precious ointment
that it perfumeth the whole house. The joy of conscience is complete in it
self, and proceeding from an inward cause (as it were) a living fountain,
that never fails; it always lasts, without any supply from the land-waters
of earthly prosperity; wherein it far exceeds the joy of worldlings, which
arising from carnal comforts, fails when they fail. The ambitious man
cannot rejoice but in his honors, and if (with Haman) he wants cap and knee,
all his other comforts will not keep him from deep melancholy, and
discontent. The covetous man cannot have any joy, if he cannot have that
riches, not which he needs, but which he desires; and he that is voluptuous,
is as moodie and melancholy in the want of music, merry company, and such
like worldly delights, as he is merry when he has them. So that their joy,
like Summer brooks, are not to be seen or found, no longer then they are
supplied by the showers of worldly prosperity. But he that has a good
conscience, rejoices in it when it is alone, without the company of any
worldly comfort, and in the greatest solitude, it presents unto us a Theater
Nullum Theatrum virtuti conscientia maius. Cic. Tusc. l. 2.
of delights: And not only in the absence of all worldly good, but also in the
presence of the greatest worldly evils. For he that has peace with God, and
peace of conscience, rejoices in tribulation, as the Apostle speaks. So when
the Apostles were beaten for Christ's cause, their backs were no more loaded
Romans 5 3. Act. 5. 41.
with stripes, then their hearts lift up with joy, because they were thought
worthy to suffer for him. So when Paul and Sylas were imprisoned, Act. 16.
and their feet in the stocks, their joy was at liberty, and the room that
contained them, was not able to confine it. It accompanies the Conscia men's
recti famae men. dacia ridet. Ovid. 4. Fast.
faithful in all their afflictions, and makes their burden light, which is
intolerable to those that want it. In their greatest poverty, it is in stead
of riches. In all their sickness it is a comfortable cordial. In the noisome
stench of worldly slanders and reproaches, it is a sweet ointment, and
precious perfume, which cheereth and reuiueth their spirits. So when Paul was
apprehended and arraigned as an heinous malefactor, this comfort refreshed him,
that he had lived with all good conscience before God. So when he was pressed
out of measure, even unto death, with troubles and Act. 23. 1.
persecutions, he rejoiced in this, the testimony of his conscience. Yea, even
at the day of death, when all worldly comforts, like false friends, forsake 2.
Cor. 1. 12.
us, or staying with us, do become (like Jobs kinsmen) miserable comforters,
serving for no use, but to aggrauate our griefs; the joy of conscience
triumphs over death it self, because it is unto us, but a straight door,
through which we shall enter into a fair Palace of everlasting blessedness:
Yea it shall cheer our hearts at the day of Judgment, and when they who have
spent their days in carnal delights, shall droope, and desire the hills to
fall upon, and cover them, the joy of conscience Apoc. 6. 16.
will cause us to lift up our heads, because the day of our full redemption
Luke 21. 28. Been sibi conscius falsis non debet moueri conuitijs, nec
aestimare plus ponderis in alieno esse conuitio, quam in suo testimonio. Amb.
de offic. Nemo plus videtur aestimare virtutem, etc. quam qui boni very famam
perdidit, ne conscientiam perderet. Sen. Epist. 72.
draws near. If then we can find in our selves this true spiritual joy,
that will bear us up in all estates, and keep us above water in the greatest
storms of worldly afflictions, it is a manifest sign of a good conscience;
whereas contrariwise, if we have no joy saving that which is fed with the
fuel of worldly prosperity, and is presently extinguished, when the water of
tribulation is cast upon it; if it leave us when we most need it, and will
stay on no terms any longer with us, then whilst it may have the company of
health, wealth, pleasures, and preferments, friends and fame: If we rejoice
more in earthly, then in spiritual and heavenly things, in the name and credit
of virtue and grace, more then in the things themselves, and in the fame, more
then in the conscience of well-doing, and less grieve when we have made
shipwreck of conscience, then when we are at a loss, in the pursuit of glory
and esteem amongst men; it is a sign that the conscience is carnal and
corrupt, sauouring more of the world and earthly vanities, then of spiritual
grace and the things of God.

. Sect. 8 That a good conscience may be known by the integrity and constancy
of it.
Finally, a good conscience may be known by the integrity and constancy of
it. For it labors to approve it self before God and men, in all things,
and at all times. It respects the whole Law of God, and shows it self in
every commandment, as well as in any, due order and proportion being observed
in the weight and excellency of every duty. It joins piety and holiness
with honesty and righteousness, and faith with good works; and so gives
place and precedence to the chief duties, as that it does not thrust out of
doors the least and meanest with careless neglect. As we see in the example of
David, who had respect to all Psalm. 119. 6.
Gods Commandments, and of Paul, who kept a good conscience in all things. So
Heb. 13. 18.
also a good conscience is known by our constancy in holy and righteous
duties, and may justly take to it self that Motto or word of our late renowned
Queen, of happy memory, Semper eadem. It is the same in all places, and in all
companies, at home as well as in the Church, alone as in company, among the
godly and sincere, as the godless and profane. It changes upon no occasion,
but keeps a just and equal tenor in the performance of the duties of
holiness and righteousness, whether honor 2. Cor. 6. 8.
or dishonor, good report or evil report, gain or loss, prosperity or
adversity attend upon them. Which integrity and constancy, if we find in us,
it will give unto us this comfortable evidence, that we have a good
conscience. But if contrariwise we share stakes between God and the world,
and in some things (like Herod) hear and obey his Word willingly, and
willingly in other things stop our ears, and neglecting his revealed will,
give our selves over to be ruled by our own carnal lusts; If like civil
worldlings, we only make conscience of the duties of Justice and honesty, and
neglect the duties of Religion and piety; or if with hypocrites, we are forward
in the outward duties of piety, and make no conscience of honesty and just
dealing with all men, nor of the works of mercy toward those that are in
want and misery, and are so wholly for faith, that we are nothing for good
works; If we are religious and honest by fits, when it will best serve our
worldly ends, and be Saints in the Church, and devils at home; or fit our
conversation to all companies, seeming zealous and devout among them that fear
God, and cold and careless of all Christian duties among the godless and
wicked, we may hence conclude, that our consciences are corrupt and carnal.

CAP. XVII.
Of the means whereby we may get a good Conscience; and preserve it being
gotten.

. Sect. 1 The first means of getting a good conscience, is highly to esteem
it.
NOw when by these signs we have examined our selves, we shall find, either
that we have a good conscience, or that we want it. If we have it not, then are
we carefully to use all good means, whereby we may attain unto it; but if
upon trial we find, that we have it, then are we to rejoice in it, using all
good means, whereby we may preserve and keep safe so precious a Jewel. The
means by which we may get a good conscience, if we want it, are diverse. The
first is, in our judgments highly to esteem it, as one of Gods special
graces and richest gifts, and in our hearts and affections, to love and desire
it above all earthly things. And so will the Lord be more willing to bestow it
upon us, when we esteem and desire it, according to the worth and value of it,
and we also shall be more earnest in using all good means to get it, and more
thankful unto God for it, when we have obtained it. Now that we may esteem
and desire this gift of God, let us consider, First, that it is most excellent,
and one of the chiefest parts of our happiness, giving us a taste and entrance
into the joys of heaven, even whilst we are upon earth. For (as the Apostle
says) The Kingdom of God is not meats and drinks, but righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the holy Ghost. But to what end should I speak of the
excellency Romans 14. 17.
of it which is unspeakable, or labor to set forth the beauty and
brightness of this heavenly light, which no mortal eye can behold in its
perfect glory, seeing as the Apostle tells us, it passes all understanding?
Phil. 4. 7.
And therefore I will content my self to shadow it darkely, and to give some
glimpse of it (as of the Sun in the water) by touching briefly the profit and
necessity of it. And for the vtility of this grace, that may be said of it,
which the Apostle speaks of godliness, that it is profitable unto all
things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to
come. Like a witness it gives evidence on our side before God, and excuses
us of all those faults which Satan accuses us of, or the Law lays to our
charge; like an Advocate it pleads our cause, and proves that we are just
and innocent, through the righteousness and obedience of Jesus Christ. As a
just Judge, upon this evidence and plea it absolueth us, and the judgment
thereof shall never be trauersed or reuersed in this world, nor in the world
to come. But look what sentence good conscience passes on earth, the supreme
Judge will ratify at the great Day of assizes, in which respect, if it
condemn us not here, then may we have confidence toward God, that he will
not condemn us hereafter. As a 1. Joh. 3. 21.
comfortable and true friend, it always bears us company, encouraging us
when we do well, and reproouing us when we do amiss, admonishing and warning
us to look to our footing, when we walk in slippery places, and are in
danger of falling, and to rise, if we do fall for want of care in taking
warning, by renewing our repentance. In our prosperity it is our guide to lead
us on, and direct us in the right use of it; in our affliction it is our
comforter, which speaking peace within, does make us with patience and joy to
bear all outward crosses and calamities. In time of peace, or rather cessation
of that conflict with the spiritual enemies of our salvation, it is a
faithful Watchman, which leaves us to enjoy our rest and quiet when there is
no danger, but yet admonishes us to sleep in our Christian armor, seeing
they are not gone, but have only withdrawn their forces for their greater
advantage; and in time of war Si recte facies, hic murus abeneus esto: nil
conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa. Horat. ad Moecenet. Ep. 1.
when the enemy approaches, and is ready to encounter us, it not only
sounds the alarm, that we may start up and stand in readiness, but also is
armor of proof, and even a brazen wall to keep us from danger when they
assault us. Finally, it performs all good duties, to all sorts of men, at all
times, and all places, accompanying the Judge to the bench, the Lawyer to the
bar, the Divine both in his Study and Pulpit, the Tradesman in his shop, and
the Buyer and Seller in the market, teaching and admonishing them how they
shall carry themselves in all cases, and both approouing them when they
perform their duty, and rebuking them, when for fear or favor, glory or
gain, they do neglect it. And from hence also the necessity of a good
conscience appears, seeing it brings with it so much good, of all which
they are destitute that live without it. Yea they are subject to the contrary
evils, having in them a witness that daily accuses them, and a Judge that
condemns them, no guide to lead them, no friend to admonish them, to
encourage them in good, or discourage them in evil. Neither can they do any
thing pleasing unto God: for the end of the Commandment is love, out of a pure
heart, a good conscience, 1. Tim. 1. 5.
and faith unfeigned; of which end they fail, that are destitute of it, and can
do nothing but sin against God, and bring upon themselves fearful
condemnation: for if our corrupt consciences condemn us, God the righteous and
impartial Judge, who is greater then our consciences, 1. Joh. 3. 20.
will much more condemn us, as the Apostle John speaks.

. Sect. 2 Of the second means to obtain a good conscience.
Secondly, we must labor to know the will of God revealed in the Scriptures,
and to apply what we know, unto our selves, for our own use. For the
conscience judges and witnesses with God, for us, or against us, and
therefore we must know what he approves and condemns, if we would have our
judgment and evidence to agree with his; otherwise our consciences being
unjust and erroneous, will judge unjustly of our actions, and give in false
evidence, when we put our selves upon them for trial. More especially, we
must labor after the knowledge, both of the Law and the Gospel; for the Law,
as it is the rule of our actions, according to which they ought to be wholly
conformed, so also it is the rule of our consciences, whereby they discern
whether they be right or crooked, good or evil. It is the municipall law for
the peculiar government of Gods subjects, and the book of Satutes, set out by
our Sovereign, according to which, conscience is bound to judge and give
evidence, which it cannot do, unless it know, and be able to examine our
actions according unto this law. In which regard, the consciences of ignorant
men do in most things misleade them into manifold errors, because they are not
able to judge of their actions according to Gods Law, which they know not, but
give sentence of them according to their own wills, humane traditions, and
their own inventions, superstitious conceits and good meanings. And the like
may be said of those, who having some knowledge of Gods Law, do through
negligence or profaneness never examine their actions by it, yea, rather
being carried through the violence of their carnal lusts and passions, into
all disobedience and sin, and resolving in themselves to go on in their
course, do cast the Law out of their sight and remembrance, lest conscience
having it to judge by should accuse and condemn their evil actions, and so
abate their pleasure which they take in them. But especially if we would have
good consciences, we must apply unto our selves the sentence of the Law, which
condemns Deuteronomy. 26. 27. Gal. 3. 10.
all of sin, and subiecteth them under the curse, who do not continue in all
that is written in the book of the Law to do it. For until the Law do
convince us of sin, and that we cannot be justified before God in our own
righteousness, we shall rest in it, and never seek to be partakers of the
righteousness of Christ, by which alone we can be justified before God, and
consequently by it only obtain peace of conscience. In which regard it is not
sufficient to know, and apply the Law unto us; for this will work in the
conscience terrors and fears, and no peace: but only use it as a
schoolmaster to teach us our own vileness and sinful corruption, and that
we are in our selves most miserable, and in the fearful state of death and
condemnation, that so it may bring us unto Christ, in whom alone we can be
justified and obtain sound and secure peace. And therefore if we would have
good consciences, we must also know the Gospel, in which God of his free
grace does offer unto us peace and reconciliation in Jesus Christ; we must
acquaint our selves with the covenant of grace, which is the maine foundation
of all our peace, when as thereby we are assured, not only that Gods mercies
are infinite, and Christ's merits all-sufficient, but that they belong unto us,
performing the condition of the covenant, that God for Christ's sake will
forgive us our sins, be reconciled unto us, and Esa. 32. 40.
write his Law in our hearts, that we may not depart from him.

. Sect. 3 The third means of a good conscience is a lively faith.
Thirdly, we must not, for the obtaining of a good conscience, only know the
Gospel and Covenant of grace, with the sweet promises therein contained, but
also apply them by a lively faith, and in a special manner interesse Romans 5. 1.
Heb. 9. 14. Col. 1. 20.
our selves in them, by performing the condition of the covenant, which is our
restipulation that we make with God. For we must be justified by faith, before
we can have peace with him, or peace of conscience. Our consciences must be
purged by the blood of Christ, from dead works, and from the guilt and
punishment of all our sins, before they will speak peace unto us. The
Charter of our peace must be drawn upon the Cross, and sealed with the
effusion of Christ's blood, and must be received and pleaded by faith, before
our consciences will cease accusing and condemning, or stand with us upon any
terms of peace. Now this faith must be approved to be unfeigned and sound by
the fruits which it brings forth in unfeigned repentance, by the changing of
our hearts, and renewing of our minds, our hatred of evil, and love of good,
our sorrow for our sins past, and resolution to leave and forsake them for
the time to come, and to serve the Lord in the contrary duties of holiness and
righteousness; without which fruits, faith is no living Tree, but a dead
stock, which will give us no assurance of peace with God in the remission of
our sins, and consequently will bring with it no peace of conscience. And
hereof it is, that the promises of the Gospel are as often made to repentant
sinners, as to those that believe in Christ, because though faith only be the
condition of the Covenant, yet it is such a faith alone, as is fruitful in
repentance. Neither can this faith be so easily seen and discerned in it
self, but only by the fruits that spring from it, which necessarily inferring
this good Tree from which they spring, the promises are made to them, because
these being more sensible, they may be more easily applied.

. Sect. 4 That the exercises of repentance are notable means to get a good
conscience, and also the love of God and our neighbors.
Fourthly, the exercises of repentance are notable means to work peace of
conscience; as our often humbling of our selves before God in Luke 1. 53. 1
Pet. 5. 5. Esa. 57. 15. Pro. 28. 13.
the sight and sense of our vileness and unworthiness, whereby our stony
hearts are broken, and our spirits made contrite; our daily confession of our
sins unto God, and earnest craving of pardon for them, seeing our faith will
assure us, and answerably our consciences will witness with us, according to
the rule of Gods Word, that humbling our selves, we shall be exalted; that
being empty of all grace and goodness, and hungring after it, we shall be
filled and satisfied; that the God of peace will dwell with us, and bring his
peace unto us, being of broken hearts and contrite spirits: and finally, that
confessing and forsaking our sins, we shall find mercy, seeing it stands
upon the truth of Gods promise, according to that of the Apostle, If we
acknowledge and confess our sins, he is 1. Ioh. 1. 7, 8.
faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. Of which we have experience in the example of David, who
being afflicted in the sight and sense of his sin, with terrors of
conscience, used this means to quiet it and get peace, I acknowledge (says
he) my sin Psalm. 32. 4, 5.
unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I said, I will confess my
transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgauest the iniquity of my sin.
Lastly, the unfeigned love of God and of our neighbors is a notable means for
the obtaining of a good conscience; for if we love God, our consciences will
witness unto us that he loves us, seeing his love shed abroad in our hearts
by the holy Ghost, works this love in us, and is that divine fire and flame
from which this heat comes: for we love him, because he loved 1. Ioh. 4. 19.
us first, as the Apostle testifies. And this love of God toward us, and our
love toward him, will make us careful to keep our consciences unspotted of
any known sin, and zealous in doing all things which may be pleasing in his
sight. From which sense of our mutual love, will spring peace unspeakable,
we resting securely upon him who so loves us, and whom we so love. According
to that of the Apostle; Above Col. 3. 14, 15.
all things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness, and let the
peace of God rule in your hearts.

. Sect. 5 Of the means whereby a good conscience may be preserved.
And these are the means of getting a good conscience. The means of
preserving it being gotten, are diverse. First, the often renewing of our
covenant of peace with God, by renewing the condition of it, on our part, faith
and repentance. For as we daily wound our consciences through our frailty in
falling into sin, whereby the peace of them is disturbed, and defile them, by
casting upon them the filth of our corruptions: so our care must be, to heal
daily these wounds, by applying unto them afresh by the hand of faith, the
sovereign salve and balsam of Christ's blood, which is of sufficient and sole
virtue, and nothing else in the world, to heal these wounds; and also to wash
them as often in the tears of unfeigned repentance, which will give us
assurance that they are purged and cleansed from all filth of sin. Secondly,
being cleansed, our continual care must be to keep them clean from all sin,
especially in our desires, resolutions, and endeavors, and howsoever we cannot
hinder Romans 6. 12.
it from dwelling in us, yet we must take heed that it do not so reign in
us, that we should obey it willingly in the lusts thereof; for sin willingly
nourished, cannot possibly stand with this peace, seeing they do wound and
waste the conscience; which sores, if they fester and putrify with corruption,
will breed in them such a gnawing worm, as will give unto us no peace or rest;
but night and day will torture and torment us. Thirdly, let us daily mortify
all our sinful lusts, as wrath, envy, malice, unclean concupiscence, pride,
and the rest, which will betray conscience unto sin, and with their loud
cries and tumultuous clamours, hinder it of all sound peace and quiet. But
especially, we must crucify all worldly lusts of ambition, covetousness, and
voluptuousness, and weane our hearts from the love of earthly vanities: which
otherwise if it be entertained, will set the peace of conscience unto sale, for
the base price of pleasure, profit, and preferment, as the miserable experience
of these times do too plainly teach us. Fourthly, we must often examine our
consciences by the rule of Gods Word, whether they give unto us true evidence
and judgment, the which must be done in the presence of our supreme Judge, who
perfectly sees all secrets, and gives righteous judgment, not only of all
our actions, but even of conscience also, which as his Deputy judges of them:
Even as the Judges of the Kingdom, according to law, call to account all
subjects, and pass sentence of their actions, but yet are accountable to their
Sovereign, and have all their judgments and determinations subject to his
censure. And this is that answer 1. Pet. 3. 21. Act. 24. 16. and 23. 1.
of a good conscience toward God, whereof S. Peter speaks, which the Apostle
Paul by continual exercise endeavored so to make, as he might be accepted of
him. Which that we may the better do at the great Day of reckoning, we must
often put conscience to judge and examine it self, according to the rule of
the Scriptures, that the Book of Gods Law, and the book of conscience may
agree together; and also desire the Lord in private, often to try and examine
us and it, that all things being cleared Psalm. 26. 1, 2.
between us and him, we may not come to public shame, when we are called to
give an account in the Star Chamber of heaven. Fifthly, we are to keep our
consciences clean and undefiled from dead works, and not to smother any sin
in them without judgment and execution, though for life and liberty, it offer
to bribe us with all the honors, riches, and pleasures in the world. For if
conscience be not pure and impartial, in condemning all sin, it can never be
peaceable, seeing it will be bound over to answer before the supreme Judge,
for conniuencie and partial judgment; and for not condemning and punishing
sin as his Vicegerent, according to law, shall it self be found an
accessory, and guilty of that sin which it tolerated in us, and so shall be
condemned and tortured with that gnawing worm which never dies. Lastly, we
must continually meditate of the day of Judgment, when as a clear and good
conscience will be better unto us then ten thousand worlds. The which will make
us careful to preserve our consciences in their purity and peace, seeing if
they do not approve us at that day, we can never be justified before the
tribunal of Gods Judgment. And as Judges and Notaries, knowing that their
wise, just, and judicious King will exactly view and examine their Books and
Records, are made thereby careful to keep them fair, and without the
aspersion of any faultiness, and, if they have failed in the just executing of
their office, will do what they can to be free from all imputation; so we
being to show our books of conscience before the King of heaven and earth, are
to be much more careful, that they may be unblemished, and without all spots
of sin; and because we often blot and blemish them in this life, and have
our faults and sins often interlined; we must labor to get out all these
blots and stains, by washing them often with the hand of faith in the blood of
Christ, and in that aqua fortis, and powerful water, which flowed out of his
side; that so our sins not being found in these books of account, may not be
imputed unto us, nor bring upon us that just condemnation which they have
deserved. And so much concerning a good conscience, and those fundamental
virtues, which are the maine grounds of a godly life.

THE SECOND BOOK OF A GODLY LIFE, CONTAINING THE MAINE PARTS and principal
duties of it, which we ought generally to perform at all times, and upon all
good occasions.
CAP. I.
Of the maine duties wherein a godly life consists.

. Sect. 1 That a godly life consists in doing all those duties which God has
commanded.
WE have entreated the more largely of the maine grounds of a godly life,
because when the foundation is laid large and deep, the building which is
erected upon it, is more firm and durable. And now we are come to show, first,
wherein it consists: and secondly, what are the properties of it, and of all
the duties required in it. A godly life consists in the conformity of our
whole carriage unto Gods revealed will, both in fleeing and forsaking all that
is evil, and in embracing and practicing that which is good; in leaving undone
that which he has forbidden, and in doing that which he has commanded: And
is generally required in many places of holy Scriptures. Depart from evil, and
do good; cease to do evil, and learn to do well. Put ye off, concerning
the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt, according Psalm. 34. 14.
Esa. 1 16. 1. Pet. 3. 11. Ephesians. 4. 22, 23, 24
to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the Spirit of your mind, and put
on that new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
holiness. So Hierome to this purpose says, That there are two kinds of Gods
Duo sunt genera mandatorum, in quibus clauditur tota iustitia, etc. Ad
Celantiam.
Commandments, in which, all Justice is comprehended. The one forbids, the
other commands; for as evils are prohibited, so good things are enjoined.
There cessation and rest works, here study and endeavor. There the mind is
restrained, here incited. Here it is a fault to Innocentiae imprimis
fundamentum ponatur supra quod facil^us possit arduum culmen iustitiae erigere.
Hieron. ibid.
do, there not to have done. And therefore to the leading of a godly life, it
suffices not (as many think) to be harmless and innocent, unless we also
be diligent and constant, in doing of all holy and just actions, but we must
as he adds, upon the foundation of innocence, erect the building of
righteousness. Yea, in truth a godly life more principally consists in
doing, then not doing; in action, rather then in forbearance. And he no less
displeases God, and sins against his own In quouis proposito, in quouis
gradu, aequale peccatum est, vel prohibita admittere, vel iussa non facere.
ibid.
soul, who neglects the good which he requires, then he who commits the
evil which he forbids. The Idolater offends no more haynously in
worshipping a false god, then the Atheist that acknowledges no God; nor the
superstitious person, who worshippeth him in a false manner, then the profane
worldling, who worshippeth him not at all. He that hid his talent, was cast
into utter darkness, because he did not use it to his masters advantage, as
well as they that abuse and misspend it. Dives was cast into hell for not
feeding Lazarus, as well as others that rob and oppress the poor: the foolish
virgins were shut out, who had not in their lamps the oil of grace, and the
light of a godly life. And they at Christ's left hand, shall at the day of
Judgment have their portion with the devil and his angels, who did not feed
the hungry, and clothe the naked, as well as they who spoil them of their food
and raiment; seeing there is but this difference between them, that the one
withholdeth their right, which God has allotted them, the other takes it away
when they already have it. The one, like the nurse, withholdeth the breast from
the hungry child entrusted to her care and keeping; the other pulls the teate
out of his mouth, when he has taken hold of it. Or if they differ at all (as
in some cases there is some difference) there shall be only this difference in
their punishments; that these innocent and harmless men, who have power to
do good and do it not, shall be damned in hell, but not in so deep a degree
of condemnation as the other.

. Sect. 2 That a godly life consists in evangelical obedience, both in
forsaking that evil which God forbids, and in doing that good which he
commands.
Unto a godly life therefore it is required, that we hate and forsake all
evil, and that we embrace and practice that which is good; that is, that we
abhor and renounce sin in all kinds, without exception, and those most of
all, which whilst we lived in the state of infidelity, we most loved, and to
which, as yet our corrupt nature most inclines, seeing they are our greatest
and most dangerous enemies, and like traytrous Rebels, raising intestine war
within us, do as much as in them lies, expose us to the malice of our open
enemies, the devil and the world. In which total relinquishing of sin, we
must be constant in our resolutions and endeavors, and not do it by fits and
flashes, as we shall see hereafter. And with the like constancy, we are to
settle our selves, in embracing and practicing all good duties, whether they be
hard or easy, pleasant or displeasant, profitable to our worldly estate, or to
our loss and hinderance. Now, because the Word and revealed will of God is the
rule and squire, according to which, we are to judge of good and evil, that
being good which it commands, and evil which it forbids; therefore a
godly life consists in our conformity and obedience to Gods will revealed in
his Word, or to all Gods Commandments contained both in the Law and Gospel.
For because we cannot perform obedience to the Law legally, that is, in that
perfection which the Law requires, therefore a godly life is not, as we
understand it in this Treatise, an absolute conformity unto the Law (though it
be most absolute when it is most conformable) but when we conform our selves
and all our actions, according to the rule of the Law, after an Evangelical
manner, that is, desire, resolve, and endeavor to perform unto it as perfect
obedience as we can, which because through our frailty and corruption it is
defective, and nothing imperfect can be acceptable unto God, therefore unto such
a godly life as may be pleasing unto him, there is required, that to our
obedience of the Law, we add our obedience to the Gospel, which requires a
lively faith in Christ, whereby applying unto our selves both him and all his
benefits, the imperfections of our obedience are covered with his perfect
righteousness, and our sins and corruptions washed away in his blood. And also
that we show forth the fruits of this faith in our unfeigned repentance,
whereby we bewail our sins past, and resolve and endeavor to leave and
forsake them for the time to come, lament the imperfection of our obedience,
and labor and strive after more perfection; without which obedience to the
Gospel, our imperfect obedience to the Law, will not be accepted of God, nor
entitle us to this godly life, which is pleasing in his sight.

. Sect. 3 That we must in a godly life perform obedience to the Law, after an
Evangelical manner.
Our obedience therefore to the Law is required, seeing it is the rule of
holiness and righteousness, according to which, all our thoughts, words, and
actions are to be conformed; and our obedience to the Gospel, to supply and
amend what is imperfect and defective through our frailty and corruption, and
to make our works straight in Gods sight, when through ignorance or impotencie
we have swarued from our rule. The Law must be observed of all that will lead
a godly life, because as a Schoolmaster it teaches us, what is good, and what
is evil, what we must do, and what we must leave undone; The Gospel also
with no less care, because it shows us how it is to be done, and also
ministers courage and strength, whereby we are enabled to perform our duties.
We must make the Law the Canon, according to which, we must carry our selves
in all our thoughts, words, and works, because so far forth only, as they
are conformable unto it, they are holy and righteous; but withal, the
Commandments of the Gospel requiring faith and repentance, must be obeyed,
that what is imperfect in us, may be made perfect through Christ, and that our
new obedience, which cannot be accepted according to the Covenant of works, as
coming from servants, may be acceptable, according to the Covenant of grace,
as coming from sons, whose desires and endeavors are pleasing to our
heavenly Father, who accepts the will for the deed. The Law prescribes the
way wherein all are to walk, that will lead a godly life; The Gospel, as a
faithful companion, incourageth us to go in this way, and leading us by the
hand, preserves us from falling; and when through frailty we are fallen, it
lifts us up again.

. Sect. 4 That in a godly life we must join together the duties of piety,
righteousness, and sobriety.
Now the duties of a godly life, which the Law requires, respect either God or
men: both which are to be considered, first generally, as they are to be
performed of every Christian in the whole course of their lives; and secondly,
as they are to be exercised in them every day. The duties which respect God,
are contained in the first Table, and are all comprehended under the name of
piety. The duties which concern men, are comprehended in the second Table, and
are either the duties of righteousness and mercy, which respect our
neighbors, or the duties of temperance and sobriety belonging to our own
persons. All which must go together, and may in no wise be severed the one
from the other. For piety is the root of righteousness and sobriety, and
these the fruits and signs of piety, and neither of both are accepted of God,
but when they go together, seeing piety without righteousness, is like a
foundation without a building; and righteousness without piety, is like a
building without a foundation; that, as a fire without light; this, like the
fools fire, a light without heat; that alone, at the best, makes but
hypocrites; this without that, no better then proud Iusticiaries and civil
worldlings. And hereof it is, that the holy Ghost in the Scriptures joins
them altogether, requiring no less the one then the other. So he says, that
those who are the redeemed of the Lord, shall worship him in holiness and
righteousness before Luke 1. 74, 75.
him, all the days of their lives; that we must pray for Kings, and all that
1. Tim. 2. 2. and 6. 11. Ephesians. 4. 24.
are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life under their
government, in all godliness and honesty: That our spiritual renewing,
according to Gods image, ought to be both in righteousness and true holiness:
That a Bishop ought to be a lover of hospitality, and a lover of good men,
sober, just, Tit. 1. 8. and 2. 12.
holy, and temperate; that the grace of God which brings salvation appearing,
has taught us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly,
righteously, and godly, in this present world. And that they who will make
their calling and election sure, must not embrace loose and single virtues, nor
perform 2. Pet. 1. ad 10.
scattered duties, but link and chain them one with another. For they are
such twins as live and die together, and the soul, life, and breath of
Christianity, which may be distinguished in doctrine and discourse, but not
derided in our practice and conversation.

. Sect. 5 Of piety, comprising in it all duties of Gods service.
The first and maine duties required unto a godly life, are all comprehended
under the name of piety, required in the first Table. Which is Pietas quid
aliud est quam Deum pura mente colere, quae alio nomine latria nuncupatur. Ad
fratres in Eremo. Sermon 24. Primo amare Deum gratis, haec est pietas, etc. Aug.
de Temp. Sermon. 234. Mat. 4. 10. Deu. 6. 13. and 10. 20.
nothing else, but that true Religion, whereby we worship the only true God,
according to his will revealed unto us. So Augustine, What is piety, but to
serve God with a pure mind? which is otherwise called worship. And again,
this is piety to love God freely and absolutely, and out of him to expect no
reward, but what is expected from him. For he is the chief Goodness: and what
thing of worth can he ask of God, to whom God seems of little worth? So that
piety consists in Gods true service, and in the performance of those holy
duties of his worship which he requires in the first Table: of which, piety is
the sum, according to that of our Savior, repeated out of the Law, Thou
shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve. The which is
sometime signified by the fear of God, a part of divine worship being put for
the whole, Thou shall fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shall swear
by his Name. And sometime by the love of God, which is put for all worship,
because all holy service and true obedience does flow from it. So Moses in his
repetition of the Law, makes this the sum of all: Thou shall love the Lord thy
God with all thine heart, and with Deuteronomy. 6. 5.
all thy soul, and with all thy might. And our Savior Christ tells the
Lawyer, that this is the great Commandment, which comprehends in it the
whole first Table; Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, Mat.
22. 37.
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. Where he shows both the
object of true worship, which is the Lord our God only, and the special and
principal act of it, which is love, from which, as a fountain, all other
parts, like streams, do spring and flow; and also the subject of this duty
which is the whole man. For by the heart, is understood all the affections,
desires, and inclinations; by the soul, the will, purpose and resolution; by
the mind, the reason, understanding, discourse, and memory; and by the might
or strength (which Saint Luke also adds) all the faculties of the soul, and
parts of the body, with all their functions, actions, and Luke 10. 27.
operations, both internal and external. So that the whole man must be
consecrated unto the service and worship of God, by all those who embrace
piety, and desire so to perform the duties of a godly life, as they may be
acceptable and pleasing in the sight of God. The which, as it is required by
him, so there is none but he, who can enable us in any measure to perform it,
seeing it is not in our own power, but his free gift, and the work of his
holy Spirit, which is bestowed upon whom and when he will; for it is God
only, who by his divine power, gives us all things which pertain to life and
godliness, as the Apostle Peter speaks; and therefore 2. Pet. 1. 3.
when he requires it of us, we must return unto him again, and entreat him
by earnest and fervent prayer, that he will enable us to perform that which
he requires; according to that of Augustine, Give what thou Daquod iubes, and
iube quod vis.
command, and then command what thou will.

. Sect. 2 Reasons moving us to embrace piety, first, because it is most
excellent.
And thus we generally see what piety is. Let us in the next place consider
briefly of some arguments which may move us to embrace and practice it, in the
whole course of our lives. The first is, that piety and the duties of it are
most excellent, and to be preferred before righteousness, both in regard of
our judgments, which ought to esteem them above the other, in respect of the
object, God himself, unto whom immediately they are to be performed, who
infinitely exceeding men, the duties which we owe unto him, are incomparably
to be preferred before those which are due to them. In regard also of our
hearts and affections, which ought to embrace with greater love and desire
those things which our judgments do most highly value; and in respect of our
endeavor and practice, wherein we ought to give priority and precedencie, in
regard of time and place, unto the duties of piety, above all earthly things,
according to that of our Savior, First seek the Kingdom of God and his
righteousness, etc. Again, Mat. 6. 33.
Christ calls the first Table, inioyning piety, The great Commandment: Mat.
6. 38.
unto which the second is like, but not equal. For piety is the fountain of
righteousness, and the alone sure foundation, upon which it stands; which if
it wants, or is built upon any other ground, as it were, upon a quagmire or
the sands, it will soon fall and come to ruin, seeing the building can stand
no longer then it has a foundation to rest upon; as we daily see in the Moral
and mere civil righteousness of worldlings, which resting upon their credit,
or profit, or fear of humane Laws, does last no longer then they lust. It is
the heart and head of Justice, which gives life, heat, and motion unto it,
without which, it is but a dead trunk, yea the very soul, which does inform
it, without which, it is but a loathsome carcass in Gods sight. And therefore
in the practice of a godly life, we are more highly to esteem, and answerably
with more care, earnestness and delight, to put in practice the duties of
piety, which concern God immediately, then the duties of righteousness which
respect our neighbors. As for example, we must love, and fear and obey God
more then men; and when both will not stand together, we must neglect the one
in comparison of the other, as we see in the example of the Apostles, who when
men forbade that which God commanded, obeyed him rather Act. 5. 29.
then them. But yet seeing all duties both to God and men are commanded of God,
and in that regard we ferue or disobey him, mediately and indirectly, when we
do or neglect the duties which concern them: therefore in performing the
duties of the first Table in our judgment, affection and practice, we are to
observe a due proportion between them, comparing like with like, the greatest
with the greatest, middle with middle, and the least with the least; neither
are the ceremonies, and circumstances, and means of pious duties, to be
preferred before the maine and substantial duties of righteousness; as we see
in Gods own choice, who preferred mercy before sacrifice, and the duties of
righteousness, Hos. 6. 6. Esa. 58. 3, 6. Mat. 12. 1, 2. etc. Leuit. 24. 9.
Exodus 29. 33.
mercy and love, before an external fast, or the outvvard rest of the Sabbath,
which is but a means of the service of God, and of our spiritual resting
from sin.

. Sect. 3 The second reason is taken from the profit of Piety.
The second reason is taken from the profit of piety, which may much induce us
to the embracing of it. For if men's hearts are set chiefly upon Psalm. 4. 6.
gain, and are ready to enquire after it upon all occasions, according to that
of the Psalmist, There be many that say, Who will show us any good? And if
their affections and desires are inflamed and enlarged, according to the
greatness of the profit which they pursue; then when our judgments are
convinced, and persuaded that there is most gain in godliness, there is
great reason why our hearts should be set upon it as our chiefest treasure. But
the Apostle tells us, that godliness is gain, yea, 1. Tim. 6. 6.
great gain with contentation; where he makes not the gain of godliness to
depend upon the condition of our contentment, as though there were no profit in
it, unless we be contented with it; but that it is the effect, and an
inseparable companion of godliness, to make us contented with all estates, and
therefore not gain only, if it be joined with content, but because it always
brings with it contentation. Even as the Sun is said to be comfortable,
not if it give light, but because it gives light, it does bring us comfort
with his beams and brightness. Now this profit of piety, is incomparably
greater then the gain of the whole world; for this is profitable but for some
purposes, but the other for all things; that only for the present, but this
also for eternity, according to that of the Apostle; Godliness is profitable
unto all things, having promise of the life that 1. Tim. 4. 8.
now is, and of that which is to come. In this life it assures us of Gods
grace and favor, that we are his children and heirs of his promises, who are
continually under his protection, and thereby safe from all danger, that though
we have but little, yet there is cause of great contentment, seeing our small
pittance is better then the riches of many wicked, it being a pledge Psalm. 37.
16.
of Gods love, and an earnest penny of our heavenly happiness. That we are
blessed in all estates, prosperity and adversity, poverty and riches, health
and sickness, life and death, because God that loves us, will by Romans 8. 28.
his wisdom and power, cause all things to work together for our good. In the
life to come also godliness will be most gainefull; for when all worldly
profits are utterly ceased, and the glory and beauty of them withered and
vanished out of sight, then shall we find most profit in our piety, and reap
a joyful harvest of all our holy endeavors. Then shall we with confidence
approach into Gods presence, when as we expect that Crown of glory, which he
has freely promised to those who have served him in holiness and
righteousness all the days of this life; and having on this wedding garment,
we shall be admitted into the Bridal chamber of our Head and Husband Jesus
Christ, and there eternally solace ourselves in the fruition of his love, and
of that heavenly happiness which he has prepared for us. Whereas
contrariwise, all worldly things without piety, are unprofitable to all in many
things, and in all things to many, giving no contentment in their greatest
abundance, but like sweet drinks increase thirst, and as fuel put into the
fire, inflame the heat of carnal concupiscence. Or if they give some seeming
content in the time of health, yet how little pleasure do we take in them upon
our sick beds? though they have some taste unto our carnal appetite in the
time of life and strength, yet what an after tang leave they at parting? and
how little comfort and contentment bring they against the terrors of death,
and the dreadful apprehensions of approaching Judgment?

. Sect. 4 The third reason, which is taken from the necessity of piety.
The third reason is taken from the necessity of piety, seeing without it we
can have no assurance of any spiritual benefit, neither in this life, nor in
the life to come. For it is the end which God has proposed unto Ephe. 1. 4.
them all, unto which he most certainly attaineth, if we ever attain unto
them; seeing he who is infinite in wisdom and power, can never fail of his
end which he propounds to his actions. Now the Lord has chosen us, that we
should be holy; he has redeemed us out of the hands of all our Luke. 1. 74.
Col. 1. 22.
spiritual enemies, that we should worship him in holiness and righteousness
all the days of our lives. We are reconciled by Christ in the body of his
flesh, through death, that he may present us holy and unblameable in Gods
sight. He has adopted us for his children, that we may be holy, as he is
holy. He has justified and pardoned all our sins, that being freed from
Leuit. 19. 2. Mat. 5. 45. Romans 6. 18.
sin, we may become the servants of righteousness. And therefore without
this holiness we can have no assurance that we are elected, redeemed,
reconciled, adopted or justified, and consequently that we shall be saved: for
though it be not the cause of our happiness, yet it is the way that leads
unto it; in which if we walk not, we shall never come into that place of
blessedness: for without holiness none shall see the Lord, as the Apostle
teaches us. Heb. 12. 14.


. Sect. 5 The fourth reason persuading us to piety, which is the consideration
of Gods manifold mercies, and of Christ's coming to Judgment.
Unto these reasons we may add the consideration of Gods manifold mercies in
Jesus Christ, which ought to be notable inducements to move us to the
embracing and practicing of piety. For what greater encouragement can we have
to make us zealous and cheerful in the duties of Gods service, then to
consider how gracious and good, God has been unto us in our creation,
redemption and continual preservation; in giving unto us his Son, and
pardoning our sins, in freeing us out of the cruel bondage of all our
spiritual enemies, and in multiplying his blessings upon us, both in
spiritual and corporal things? And this argument the Apostle uses to this
purpose; I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable Romans 21. 1.
to God, which is your reasonable service. And as the fruition of Gods present
favors ought to make us forward in his service, so also the consideration of
his gracious promises concerning better and more excellent things in time to
come, even the full fruition of his glorious presence, and eternal
blessedness in his everlasting Kingdom. And this reason also the Apostle
uses to this end: Having therefore these promises (dearly beloved) let us 2.
Cor. 7. 1.
cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting our
holiness in the fear of God. Finally, the consideration of Christ's coming to
Judgment should persuade us unto holiness, when as the heavens being on fire,
shall be dissolved and pass away with a noise, the elements melt with fervent
heat, and the earth with all the works thereof shall be burnt up. For then
only they shall be happy who have been holy, and reign with God in glory,
who have faithfully served him in holiness and righteousness in the Kingdom
of grace. And thus the Apostle Peter reasons, Seeing then (says he) that all
these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be, in all
holy conversation and godliness? But I shall 2. Pet. 3. 11.
have hereafter occasion to speak more fully of this point, when I come to
show the manifold reasons and motives which may induce and persuade us unto a
godly life; and therefore for the present I will content my self thus briefly
to have touched them, referring the Reader for his more full satisfaction to
the following discourse.

CAP. III.
Of our adhering and cleaving unto God, with the full purpose and resolution of
our hearts.

. Sect. 1 Of the sum of the first Commandment.
WE have spoken of piety, which is the sum of the first Table. And now it
follows, that we speak briefly of the particular precepts; the first
whereof is contained in these words: Thou shall have no other gods before me,
or before my face. The maine scope and sum whereof is this, that we know,
acknowledge and worship Jehovah, the Father, Son and holy Ghost, in Trinity
of persons, and unity of Essence, and no other gods besides him. For to have
God, is, in our minds and understandings to know and acknowledge him, to be
our God, all-sufficient, incomprehensible, omnipotent, immutable, eternal,
just, merciful, and infinite in all perfection; in our hearts and affections
to adhere and clean unto him with faith, affiance, hope, love, zeal, whom we
know to be the chief Goodness and supreme cause of all our happiness; in our
wills, with all earnest desire and constant resolution to serve and obey him in
all his Commandments, with all the power and faculties of our bodies and
souls, whom we know and acknowledge to be the chief end of all things, and so
infinitely good and gracious unto us; and with our bodies, actions and
endeavors, to worship and serve him alone, with all our might and strength. So
that the true saving knowledge of God is the ground of all other virtues and
obedience, as we have showed; and therefore if we would embrace any virtues,
or perform any Christian duties of a godly life, we must in the first place
labor to have our minds enlightened with the knowledge of God and his truth;
without which, our devotion will be no better then superstition; and all our
endeavors in the performance of religious duties, mere will worship and
idolatry, as we see in the example of the Idolaters, who in stead of
worshipping the only true God, worship stocks, stones and Images, Saints, and
Angels, and in stead of doing Gods will in their devotions, do their own
wills, and therefore tire themselves, and spend all their strength in vain.

. Sect. 2 Of adhering to God, what it is, and the necessity of it.
But of this knowledge of God, which is the maine ground of a godly life, we
have before spoken; and now it remains that we speak of the having of God
in our hearts and affections, wills and resolutions. Of which we will entreat
first generally, and then more specially. The general duty which compriseth
all the particulars, is, that knowing and acknowledging the Lord to be in
himself the chief Goodness, and infinite in all perfection, and our most
gracious and loving Father in Jesus Christ, we do adhere and cleave unto him
with all our souls and wills, hearts and affections, resolving to consecrate
our selves wholly to his worship, and with the uttermost of our endeavor to
please him in all things, by conforming our lives in all holy obedience unto
his revealed will, leaving and forsaking whatsoever he condemns as evil, and
embracing and practizing all that he commands as good. And this the Lord
requires in the first place of all those who serve him. Thou shall fear the
Deuteronomy 10. 20. and 13. 4. Ios. 22. 5.
Lord thy God, him shall thou serve, and to him shall thou cleave. And again,
Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his
Commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him and cleave unto him.
So Barnabas exhorts the new Conuerts of Antioch, that with full purpose of
Act. 13. 23.
heart they would cleave unto the Lord. And the Apostle persuades not to the
bare practice of good duties, but that we cleave unto that which is good.
Which holy resolution was in David, who purposed in his heart that Psalm. 17. 3.
his mouth should not transgress; and fully resolved, that if the Lord would
teach him the way of his statutes, he would keep them with his whole heart and
Psalm. 119, 33, 34.
unto the end. The which resolution is necessary unto all those who intend to
lead a godly life, wherein there are so many lets, difficulties and
discouragements, that if we be not fully resolved to pass by, or overcome
them, we shall either not begin, or soon give over to proceed in the
Christian course. And therefore our holy desires to please God in all things,
must be armed and confirmed with strong resolutions, that we will do our
uttermost endeavor to attain unto our desires; or else they will be but like
those idle and vain desires of the sluggards, of which Solomon speaks, who
desire and have nothing, because they are but bare wishers, never Pro. 13. 4.
purposing to take any pains for the satisfying of their desires. Neither can
such be said to serve God with their whole hearts, but with a part only; For as
Philosophy teaches us, there are two faculties in the heart of man; the one
called concupiscible, which desires and imbraceth that good which reason
discovers, the other the irascible faculty, which being displeased with those
lets and oppositions that hinder the fruition of the good desired, armeth us
with resolution to set upon and overcome them. And with both these we must
serve God, cleaving unto him and his will, with the desires of our heart, as
the chief good, and resolving to enjoy him at any price, and to do that which
is pleasing unto him, notwithstanding all difficulties and dangers which oppose
us in the way.

. Sect. 3 The properties of sound resolution: As first, that it must be
universal, etc.
But seeing many men deceive themselves with shadows and shows of good
purposes and resolutions of cleaving unto God, and pleasing him by their
service; it will not be amiss to set down some properties and signs whereby
we may know that, unto which the Scriptures so earnestly persuade us. And
first, this resolution ought to be general and universal, extending it self
not only to some few of many duties, but unto all without exception. We must
with David have respect unto all Gods Commandments; Psalm. 119. 6. Col. 110.
Heb. 13. 18.
and walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good
work, and having a good conscience in all things, as the Apostle speaks.
Secondly, it must be diligent and painful in the use of all good means
whereby we may attain unto our end; like unto the resolution of worldlings in
compassing earthly things, who spare for no pains for the atchieuing their
purposes, but labor night and day, by Sea and land, for the compassing of
their riches, pleasures and preferments. So as we may say with David, My soul
follows hard after thee; and never rest in our Psalm. 63. 8.
pursuit, till with the Spouse in the Canticles, we enjoy him whom our soul
loves. Thirdly, it must be so magnanimous and courageous, that nothing may be
able to daunt or dismay it: and the greater the difficulties and dangers be
which cross us in our Christian courses, the more must we double and redouble
our resolutions to withstand and overcome them, though it be with the loss of
riches, friends, yea, even life it self. And such a resolution was in good
Joshua, who though all the people did leave Ios. 24. 15. Ruth 1. 16.
the Lord, vowed himself and his family unto his service. And in Ruth, whose
resolution of adhering to Naomi and her God, could not be hindered by any
disswasion. And finally, in the Apostle Paul, who when he was persuaded by his
friends, that he should not expose himself to the peril of persecution, by
going up to Jerusalem, breaks through all difficulties in the strength of his
courageous resolution; What mean you to Act. 21. 13.
weep and break my heart? for I am ready, not to be bound only, but also to
die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. Yea, when the holy Ghost
himself witnessed, that in every City, bonds and afflictions did abide him,
his resolution made him constant in his course: But none of these things (says
he) move Act. 20. 23, 23,
me neither count I my life dear unto my self, so that I might finish my
course with joy, etc. Fourthly, it is the property of this resolution of
adhering unto God, to join with this fortitude and magnanimity, true humility;
not grounding our courage upon our own strength, as Peter did, who trusting to
the ardencie and unchangeableness of his love toward Christ, resolved, that
though all men should forsake him, yet he would Mat. 26. 33, 34.
not. For if we lean upon this weak Reed, it will most fail and deceive us,
when we most rely upon it; but being humbled in the sight and sense of our own
weakness and frailty, we must wholly rest upon the power and promises of
God, and like the child in the mothers arms, we must cling unto him with all
our strength, but not so much trust to the firmness of our hold, as to his
clasping of us, knowing that if he withdraw his strength and leave us, we shall
soon cease cleaving unto him, and fall into those tentations, which the
devil, the world, or our own flesh shall suggest unto us. We must say with
the Apostle Paul, I am able to do all Phil. 4. 13.
things, but we must add that which follows, through the power of Christ
which strengthens me. We must resolve with him, that nothing shall separate
Romans 8. 38, 39. and 7. 14, 15, 18.
us from the love of God in Jesus Christ, in the mean time acknowledging our
impotencie unto any good, and that in us, that is, in our flesh, dwells no
good thing. And so shall our resolution of cleaving unto God be much more
firm, seeing God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble; and
fills the hungry with good things, but sends the rich empty 1. Pet. 5. 5.
Luke 1. 53.
away. Lastly, our resolution must be firm and constant, never leaving to
cling unto the Lord with a lively faith, till by love we have full fruition of
him in his Kingdom. It must not be unsettled, fickle, and by fits, one while
resolving to serve God, and another while drawn from our resolution by worldly
tentations: but we must claspe fast hold of him, as Jacob Genesis 32. 26.
did in his wrestling, and fully resolve never to leave him, till we have our
desire, that is, till we have full fruition of him in heaven, without fear of
losing him. Most of which points I have handled before, and therefore do here
thus briefly touch them.

. Sect. 4 The necessity of our adhering unto God, proved by diverse reasons.
And this holy resolution of cleaving unto God, and pleasing him in all things,
is most necessary unto a godly life; first, because it is the foundation and
ground of all other duties, which whilst it remains firm, there is good
hope, though the rest of the building be shrewdly shaken with the blasts and
storms of trialls and tentations, and much failing and frailty be showed in
many outward actions; seeing so long as the foundation remains, the decayed
parts of the house may be repaired with more ease; but if our resolution be
unsettled and weak, the whole frame that rests upon it, will fall with it
own weight; and the duties themselves of a godly life, will seem irksome and
tedious. It is the very soul which gives life and motion to all our actions,
and in what case it is, in such are they; if strong, then are they strong, if
weak, then they weak also. If it be faint, then they languish; If full of
virtue and vigor, then are they also vigorous and courageous. Secondly,
because it is a main and principal part of true repentance, which chiefly
consists in the full purpose of the heart, the inclination and resolution of
the will, and the constant endeavor in our whole lives, to forsake all evil,
and embrace all good, and in all things both inwardly and outwardly to please
God, by performing unto him that acceptable service, which in his Word he
requires of us. Thirdly, because this purpose of heart, and resolution of our
wills, to serve and please God, does make both our persons and actions
acceptable unto him; for he chiefly requires the service of our hearts, as
being the fountain of all our actions, and respects not so much our deeds as
our will; not the perfection of our actions, as the sincerity of our
affections; according to that of the Apostle; If there be a willing mind, a man
is accepted, 2. Cor. 8. 12.
according to that which he has, and not according to that which he has not.
As we see in the example of the prodigal son, who resolving to go to his
Luke 15. 19, 20. Et tu si proposue^is in cord, declinare a malo, and facere
quod bonum est, etc. Bern.
father, and to acknowledge his sin, before he had done it, and whilst he
was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion on him. To this
purpose one says, If thou purposest in thine heart to leave evil, and do
good, to hold that which thou have received, and to grow daily better, although
(by reason of humane frailty) thou do something not to be justified: Yet if
thou purposest not to persist in it, but repentest and amendest what is amiss,
as far as thou art able, God, without doubt, will repute thee holy. Lastly,
this resolution is necessary, because we shall meet with many difficulties and
discouragements in our course of a godly life, as the tentations of the devil,
the persecutions, scorns, and reproaches of the world, the corruptions of our
nature, and the unpleasantness unto flesh and blood of holy duties; that if we
be not armed with a strong resolution, well grounded and settled with mature
and serious consideration, upon unanswerable reasons which induce unto it, we
shall not be able to continue constantly in our course, but give over with
shame, that which we have rashly and weakly begun. And therefore our Savior
exhorts us to lay a good foundation before we begin this building, and Luke
14. 28, 29, 30.
to prepare a good stock, whereby we may be enabled to finish our work; and
to make sufficient preparations to withstand the force of our spiritual
enemies, before we presume to enter into the field and give them battle. The
which is chiefly done, when we arm our selves with Christian courage and
undaunted resolution, that we will set aside all excuses, and come unto God
when he calls and inuiteth us, that we will break through all difficulties,
and be discouraged with no dangers; that, come prosperity or adversity, honor
or disgrace, riches or poverty, life or death, we will consecrate our selves
to Gods service, and do all things which are pleasing in his sight.

. Sect. 5 Of the means whereby we may confirm our resolution of adhering
unto God.
Now the means of confirming this resolution of adhering unto God with all our
hearts, and pleasing him in all things, are diverse. First, we must often
meditate on Gods infinite goodness in himself, whereby he deserves the
whole heart and affection, with all the service of his creatures, and their
whole endeavor to glorify him who is worthy of all love. Secondly, we must
call often to our remembrance his inestimable love, and exceeding great bounty
toward us, which plainly appear in our election, creation, preservation; but
especially in that great work of our redemption, wherein he has given his
Son to death, that he might save and restore us to life and happiness; as
also the special and singular favors which he has extended unto us in the
whole course of our lives: And this, if any thing will make us resolute to
serve and please him, whom we have tried and tasted to be so infinitely good
and gracious unto us. Thirdly, we must meditate seriously on his power and
all sufficiency, whereby he is able, and on the truth of his gracious promises,
whereby he has assured us, that he is willing to assist us in all
difficulties, and to defend us against all dangers which shall affront and
oppose us in our Christian course, and in the performance of the duties of a
godly life; for what can more strengthen our resolutions in performing
faithful service unto God, then to be assured by his assistance, of victory
over all enemies, strength in ouercomming all difficulties, safety in all
dangers, and prosperous success and an happy issue of all our endeavors? And
thus Moses exhorts Joshua to resolution and courage, because God had promised
to be with him. He it is (says he) that does go before thee, he will be with
Deuteronomy. 31. 8.
thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee; fear not, neither be
dismayed. Fourthly, let us remember, that it is impossible to lose the fruit
and benefit of our labor, whatsoever pains we take in Gods service; for
besides the present pay of temporal benefits, we shall have the rich rewards of
eternal and heavenly happiness, of which, the other are but small earnest
pennies and pawnes. So that if we in Gods service lose our earthly riches, we
shall have for them heavenly treasures; if our fame and reputation amongst men,
we shall be recompensed with eternal glory, in the presence of God, his
Saints, and Angels; yea if we lose our life it self, in losing, we shall find
it, Mat. 10. 39.
even an everlasting and most happy life, for one that was momentany and
miserable. Fifthly, if we would have this Christian resolution firm and
constant, it must be well grounded when we first begin, and we must expect,
when we enter into the course of a godly life, not the favor of men, ease and
prosperity, but many enemies to encounter us, and many difficulties and dangers
in our Christian way; which if we do not forecast before they happen, and arm
our resolution against them, they will utterly daunt and discourage us at their
first approaching. And therefore before we make purchase of this gain of
godliness, let us cast beforehand what it will cost us, and resolve to leave
it at no rate. Sixthly, let us meditate often of the excellency, vtility, and
necessity of a godly life, in which respects it is to be preferred before all
worldly things whatsoever, seeing thereby, and by no other means without it,
we are assured of Gods love and our own salvation, of his grace in this world,
and glory and happiness in the world to come. Seventhly, let us think of the
preciousnesse of our souls, which are of much more value then ten thousand
worlds, and that there is no other means to provide for their eternal
happiness, and their fruition of Gods presence, which perfecteth our
blessedness in heaven, then by framing our hearts to adhere unto him, with
firm resolution to serve and please him whilst we live upon the earth. And
let us often meditate on that speech of our Savior, What will it profit a man
to win the whole world, and lose his soul? For here our souls are saved or
lost; here Mar. 8. 36.
the acceptable time and day of salvation lasts; which if we let pass, it is
never again to be regained, but our precious souls, for the price of
momentany vanities, shall be eternally sold to hellish torments. Lastly,
because our resolution of adhering unto God, and pleasing him in all things, is
apt to faint and languish, therefore our care must be, often to survey it, that
when we find any faylings or vnsettlednesse in it, we may repair and
strengthen it; yea, in truth this is a work fit for every morning, to take a
view of our spiritual state, and to renew our resolution, that we will the
day following use all means whereby it may be improoued and bettered, enrich
our selves in our spiritual stock, and to our uttermost endeavor, do all
things which may please God, as we shall more fully show hereafter. Yea, if
we find our resolutions weak and unsettled, we must confirm them, by making
with God a solemn Covenant, that our hearts in all things shall adhere unto
him, and start aside upon no occasion; according to the example of Asa, and the
rest of Gods people, who entered 2. Chro. 15. 12, 14 and 34. 31.
into a Covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers, with all their heart,
and with all their soul; yea if need be, we must confirm this Covenant, not
only by solemn protestation, but by an inviolable oath, as they did at that
time; and the Prophet David long before them; I have sworn (says Psalm. 119.
106.
he) and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.

CAP. IIII.
Of trust, affiance, and hope in God.

. Sect. 1 Of affiance in God, and wherein it consists; and of the reasons
which may move us unto it.
THe special duties, whereby we adhere and cleave unto God with all our
hearts, are either principal, or those which arise out of them and depend upon
them; the chief and principal are affiance, the love and fear of God. By
affiance we adhere and cleave unto him, when as knowing, acknowledging,
believing, and remembering the omniscience, omnipotence, all sufficiency,
truth, and goodness of God toward us, we do put our trust and affiance in
him, for the obtaining of all good, and preservation from all evil, both in
the presence and absence of all inferior means. Unto which affiance the
Scriptures exhort us. So David, Trust in the Lord, and Psalm. 37. 3.
do good. And Solomon, Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not
Pro. 3. 5.
to thine own understanding. Which if we perform, we have diverse gracious
promises made unto us: as first, that we shall be greatly rewarded; Cast not
away your confidence, which has great recompense of reward; and be Heb. 10. 35.
encompassed with all Gods mercies and favors; according to that of the
Psalmist, He that trusts in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.
Secondly, Psalm. 32. 10.
that we shall be sustained and preserved by his providence. Cast thy Psalm.
55. 22.
burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the
righteous to be moved. And again, They that trust in the Lord, shall be as
mount Ps. 125. 1.
Sion, which cannot be removed, but abides for ever. Thirdly, that we shall
have the good things of the earth for the present, and eternal blessedness in
the life to come; for he that trusts in the Lord, shall possess the land,
and Esa. 57 13.
shall inherit his holy mountain. So Jeremy, Blessed is the man that trusts
in Ier. 17. 7.
the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. And the Psalmist, O trust and see, that
Psalm. 34 8.
the Lord is good, blessed is the man that trusts in him. And thus we must
trust in the Lord for the obtaining of all good, and the avoiding of all evil:
unto the former, David exhorts, Commit thy way unto the Lord; Psalm 37. 5.
trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass. And of the other, we have
him for our example: The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?
Psalm. 27. 1.
the Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? Though an
host should incampe against me, my heart shall not fear, though war should
Psalm. 27 1, 3. Ps. 46. 1, 2. and 23. 4. and 36. 12. Pro. 3. 26. 2. Chr. 20. 20.
arise against me, in this will I be confident. And again, God is our refuge
and strength, a very present help in trouble: therefore will we not fear,
though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be cast into the
midst of the sea, etc. And thus must we trust in the Lord, in the presence
and absence of inferior means. When we have means, we must put our affiance
in him, first, though they be weak and insufficient, knowing that he is able
to give virtue and vigor unto them, seeing we live not by bread only, Mat. 4.
4.
but by every word that proceeds out of Gods mouth. He is able in the famine
to feed us with ravenous birds, which in their own nature are more fit to
take away our meat, then to bring any unto us; and to make our small pittance,
a few pulse, an handful of meal, and a cruize of oil, as sufficient for our
nourishment as the greatest dainties of the worldly wicked. In time of plague
he can keep us safe under the shadow of his wings, and though thousands do
fall at our sides, and ten thousand at our right Psalm. 91. 1, 7.
hand, it shall not come nigh us. In time of war, he is able to save with
few, as well as with many, as Jonathan speaks; and to give victory, not only
to 1. Sam. 14. 6.
those who have a strong army, but to those also that have no power, as 2.
Chro. 14. 11.
Asa confesses. Or if our means be many and mighty, yet we must not trust in
them, but using them as sent of God to serve his providence in our sustentation
and preservation, we must put our whole confidence in him, and rest alone in
his blessing upon them, without which they shall never do us any good. For we
travail in vain, unless God bless the house; In Psalm. 127. 1. Hag. 1. 6.
Esa. 3. 1. Pro. 21. 31.
vain we plow and sow, unless he give the increase. In vain are our
Granaries and Storehouses replenished with all plenty, if he break the
staff of bread. In vain is the horse prepared against the day of battle, if
salvation come not from the Lord. And in vain do Gods spiritual Husbandmen
plant and water, except the Lord do 1. Cor. 3. 6.
give increase. Neither must we less trust in the Lord in the utter absence of
all inferior means, knowing that he is true of his promise, and will never
fail us if we put our affiance in him, and in himself alone, all-sufficient
to preserve and defend us in their absence, as well as in the presence of them.
And thus did David trust in God, though he walked alone in Psalm. 23. 4.
the vale of the shadow of death; the three children in the fiery surnace,
Daniel in the Lions den, Peter guarded with Soldiers, and Paul and Silas Dan.
3. and 6. Act. 12. and 16.
when they were in the stocks. And thus Abraham having Gods promise, respected
not his age, nor the deadness of Sarahs womb, but trusted in him for the
obtaining of a son, and as the Apostle speaks, against hope believed in
hope, that he should become the father of many Romans 4. 18.
nations.

. Sect. 2 Of the means of affiance.
Now the means whereby we may attain unto this firm affiance, are these: The
first is the often consideration of Gods saving attributes, as of his
omniscience, whereby he takes notice of all our wants and dangers; of his
omnipotency, and all-sufficiencie, whereby he is able to relieve and preserve
us; of his providence, which in especial manner watches over us who are his
sons and children, to dispose of all things to our Romans 8. 28.
good; of his mercy, bounty, goodness, and truth of his promises, whereby we
may be assured of his good will and readiness to help us. The second means
is, to observe Gods mercy and goodness in time past, showed both toward
others and toward our selves, in freeing us from evil, and procuring our
good. We must consider what God has done formerly to others, assuring our
selves that he is ready to do the like for us, if with them we fear and serve
him, seeing he is no respecter of persons, Act. 10. 34.
but is alike to all. So David confirmed his affiance in God, by remembering his
goodness toward their ancestors; Our fathers trusted in thee, Psalm. 22. 4, 5.
they trusted in thee, and thou did deliver them; they cried upon thee, and
were delivered; they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. So when he could
with no comfort rest upon God in his present sense and feeling, he remembered
Gods wonders of old, in delivering his people Israel, and drowning their Psalm.
77. 14, 15.
enemies in the red Sea. And thus he says, others would confirm their
affiance by his example. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and
saved Psalm. 34. 6.
him out of all his troubles. But much more will the experience of Gods mercy
and goodness toward our selves, in providing for us in the time of want, and
delivering and preserving us from former dangers, confirm our trust and
confidence in him, seeing he is immutable in his love, and changes Mal. ^. 3.
not, though we be changed. And thus David strengthened his affiance in God,
that he would give him victory over Goliath, because he had former 1. Sam. 17.
34.
experience of Gods goodness toward him, and power assisting him against the
Lion and the Bear. And the Apostle concludes, that as the Lord had formerly
delivered him out of former afflictions, so he would 2. Cor. 1. 10.
be a-like gracious still, and deliver him out of like afflictions in the time
to come. Lastly, if we would confidently trust in God, we must be such as fear
and serve him, and making conscience of our ways, do walk before him in
holiness and righteousness; for with such only he has made his Covenant of
grace and protection, and such only may challenge a part in his promises of
provision and preservation. So Solomon, The Pro. 28. 1.
wicked flee when none pursues, but the righteous are bold as a Lion. And
again, In the fear of the Lord is assured strength, and his children shall
have Pro. 14. 26.
hope. And the Psalmist appropriateth this confidence unto the faithful only;
Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord, he is their help and shield. And
Psalm. 115. 11.
not only those who are professedly wicked, but the close hypocrite also is
excluded from it. For the hypocrites hope shall be cut off, and his trust
shall be Job 8. 13. and 18. 14.
a Spiders web. His confidence shall be rooted out of his Tabernacle; and it
shall bring him to the King of terrors.

. Sect. 3 Of hope in God, what it is, and wherein it consists.
From this affiance in God, arises hope; for when knowing and believing God
and his saving attributes, we trust in him for the accomplishment of all his
gracious promises, then do we by hope expect the accomplishment of them, even
when they are deferred with patience and comfort, knowing that God is immutable
in his love, and most true of his Word: with which hope we are sustained in all
afflictions, that we do not faint under their burden, seeing we hope for
deliverance in Gods due time, are armed against all assaults of our spiritual
enemies with this helmet of salvation, in expectation of assured victory, and
stayed with this anchor in our Christian course, notwithstanding all the
tempestuous storms and boisterous blasts of trialls and tentations. The which
anchor is not fastened on the fleeting and failing sands of our own worth,
works, and merits, but upon the firm ground of Gods immutable love, mercy,
goodness, power and truth, which will never fail those that rest upon them;
according to that of the Psalmist, They that know thy Name, Psalm. 9. 10.
will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, have not forsaken them that
seek thee. And thus Abraham hoped against hope, being fully persuaded, that
what Romans 4. 18, 21.
God had promised, he was able also to perform. And the Apostle exhorts us
to hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, because he is Heb.
10. 23.
faithful that has promised. The object of this hope, are future good things
which God has promised; as fruition of good, and freedom and deliverance from
evil, which are not yet seen (for then there were no place Romans 8. 24, 25.
for hope) but certainly expected in Gods good time. But the main and Ps. 62.
1, 2. and 121. 1.
principal object of our hope, is heavenly happiness, which we shall enjoy
in soul and body, at Christ's coming to Judgment, whereof it is Tit. 2. 13.
called the hope of salvation, and the hope of eternal life. The chief
properties 1. These 5. 8. Tit. 1. 2.
of this hope are, First, that it be patient. Secondly, that it be certain and
assured: of the first the Apostle speaks; If we hope for that we see not,
then do we with patience wait for it: and in this regard calls it Romans 8.
25.
the patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. Of which patience, he tells
us 1. These. 1. 3.
that we have need, because God oftentimes delayeth to accomplish his
promises, as though he had forgotten both us and them. Secondly, it Heb. 10. 36.
must be certain and assured, whereof it is compared to an anchor, which if it
fails in a tempest, it puts the ship in great danger of foundring and
perishing. And therefore the Apostle desires, that the Hebrews might have
full assurance of hope unto the end; which if we have, it will Heb. 6. 11.
make us never to be ashamed, seeing God, upon whom we wait, will never fail
to accomplish his promises. And this is that hope unto which the Romans 5. 5.
Scriptures exhort us. So the Psalmist, Wait on the Lord, be of good courage,
Ps. 27. 14* and 37 7
and he shall strengthen thine heart; wait, I say, on the Lord. And again,
Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him.

. Sect. 4 Of the means of hope.
Which that we may labor after, let us consider, that it is most profitable
and necessary unto all that will lead a godly and Christian life. For it is
not only a part thereof, as being one of the three principal virtues which
the Apostle commends unto us, but a notable means, whereby 1. Cor. 13.
we are moved and enabled to labor after all other virtues, and to put in
practice all other duties, because we are assured of the fruit of our labor,
and hopefully expect the obtaining of it; without which hope we would be
utterly discouraged, sit still and do nothing. Again, this hope makes us not
to be ashamed, in midst of all reproaches and disgraces which we suffer for
Christ's sake, and causes us with him to run with patience Romans 5. 5. Heb.
12. 1, 2.
the race which is set before us, in expectation of that joy which is set
before us. It makes us not only patient, but joyful in afflictions, yea even
to glory Romans 5. 2, 3.
in our rejoicing, in hope of the glory of God, in all our tribulations. It
confirms our faith from which it springs, and makes us cheerful in all
Christian duties. It quickens and rejoices our drooping hearts, and not
only makes the way of godliness delightful unto us, but us also pleasing
and accepted of God. It is an helmet of salvation, to defend us Psalm. 147. 11.
against our spiritual enemies, yea it self saves us, as the Apostle
speaks, 1. These. 5. 8. Romans 8. 24.
because it moves God to save us: for as the Psalmist says, He is the Savior
of them that hope in him. Finally, it makes us blessed in the assured Psalm.
17. 7.
expectation of our blessedness. For happy is he that has the God of Jacob
Psalm. 146. 5. Ier. 17. 7.
for his help, and whose hope is in the Lord his God. Whereas contrariwise,
without this hope, we are as the Apostle tells us, of all men most miserable,
1. Cor. 15. 19.
having neither the comforts of this life, which worldlings enjoy, nor
expectation of better in the life to come. Let us therefore labor after this
hope, and use carefully all good means whereby we may attain unto it. And
seeing it is the gift of God, and grace of his holy Spirit, let us in the 2.
These. 2. 16.
first place beg it at his hands, by frequent and fervent prayer, assuring our
selves, that he who is the God of our hope, will not deny to give it unto Romans
15. 13.
us. Secondly, let us meditate often upon Gods saving attributes, of power,
mercy, goodness, truth, etc. and so our imperfections and unworthiness will
not make us despair, nor weaken our hopes in expectation of his promises.
Thirdly, let us often hear, read, and meditate in the holy Scriptures, which
were purposely written, that we through patience and Romans 15. 4.
comfort of them might have hope. Fourthly, let us, in all the service which we
offer unto God, avoid hypocrisy, and serve and worship him in sincerity and
uprightness of heart. For the hypocrites hope shall perish, and Job 8. 13, 14.
be cut off like a Spiders web, as Bildad speaks. Lastly, if we would have
hope in God, let us lead a godly life, and serve him all our days in
holiness and righteousness; for the flesh of Gods holy ones shall rest in
hope: Act. 2. 26.
whereas when a wicked man dies, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of
Pro. 11. 7.
the unjust men perishes, as the Wiseman speaks.

CAP. V.
Of the love of God, and diverse virtues which spring from it.

. Sect. 1 Of the love of God, what it is, and wherein it consists, and of the
measure and means of it.
THe next main and principal duty is the love of God, when as knowing,
believing, and remembering his infiniteness in all goodness, excellency,
beauty, and all perfection, and his inestimable love, grace, and bounty toward
us, we do love him again with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength,
above all things, and all other things in him, and for his sake. So that the
causes of our love toward God, are his goodness, excellency, beauty and
perfection in himself; and his goodness, grace, and benignity toward us. For
goodness is the only object of love, neither do we love any thing which is
not either truly good, or at least appears good unto us. And therefore seeing
God is the summum bonum, and chief goodness, when his nature appears to be
so, we should love him chiefly, and place our chief happiness in his
fruition. But yet because in this state of corruption we are full of
self-love, therefore we cannot love God perfectly and absolutely for himself
as we ought, till we be assured of his love toward us, and have it shed
abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost: for we love him, because he loved us
first, as the Apostle speaks. Now the Romans 5. 5. 1. Ioh. 4. 19.
measure of our love, wherewith we are to love God, ought to be without
measure, both because he is immeasurable in goodness in his own nature, and
also because his love toward us has exceeded all measure; the which appears
not only in our creation, whereby he has given us unto our selves, and made us
his most excellent creatures, but also in our Redemption, wherein he has given
himself unto us, even his only begotten and dearly beloved Son, of the
same nature with himself, to die for our sins, and rise again for our
justification; and that, when we were not friends, but of no strength,
strangers, sinners, enemies unto him and his grace, the slaves of Satan, and
children of wrath as well as others. And therefore if he thus loved us, when we
merited no love, yea when we deserved wrath and hatred, how much more, if it
were possible, should we love him who is most lovely, and infinitely deserves
our love? But because our nature being finite, we cannot love him infinitely,
we ought therefore to love him as much as is possible for us, with all our
hearts, souls, and strength: Or if we cannot thus do, in respect of our
corruption, yet at least we must love him in sincerity and uprightness of
heart, as much as we can, and be heartily sorry that we can love him no
better. We must love him above all things in the world, as house, lands,
parents, children, wives, yea our own lives, and be ready with all
cheerfulness to lay them down for him, as he has first laid down his life
for us. For if we ought to love all things in him and for him, then ought we
to love him much more, preferring his glory even before our own salvation,
when as they come in comparison, the one with the other. And this is that love
of God, which is to be embraced of us, as being in it self a most excellent
virtue, and in diverse respects to be preferred before faith and hope; 1. Cor.
13. 13.
and to us most profitable, feeing it assures us of Gods love, and remission
Luke 7. 47.
of our sins, transformeth us, after a manner, into the divine nature (for
where is love, there is likeness, and it is the nature of it to change the
lover, as much as may be, into the party beloved) and finally weaneth our
hearts from the love of the world and earthly vanities, and lifts up our
affections and thoughts unto God and heavenly things; makes all that we do or
suffer for Gods sake, easy and tolerable, yea sweet and comfortable: for it
seeks not her own, bears all things, endures all things; it inableth 1.
Cor. 13. 6, 7.
us to offer unto God cheerful obedience, and to perform all duties of
holiness and righteousness required unto a godly life, with joy and delight,
which without it are irksome and unpleasant, yea intolerable and impossible
unto flesh and blood. Now the means whereby our hearts may be inflamed with
this divine fire of Gods love, are, first, that we often meditate upon Gods
infinite goodness, excellency, beauty, and perfection, which make him worthy
of all love, and how he has exercised these saving attributes toward us, in
our creation and preservation, in our redemption, giving his only Son to die
for us, and for his sake forgiving us all our sins, and in bestowing upon us
all the good things which we enjoy in this life, or hope for in the life to
come.

. Sect. 2 Of the zeal of Gods glory, what it is, and wherein it consists.
Now the virtues and graces which arise and issue from love, are diverse, as
zeal of Gods glory, joy, and rejoicing in God, thankfulness and obedience.
Zeal is the fruit and effect of our fervent love toward God, and as it were a
flame arising from this divine fire, whereby we are made most careful and
earnest in seeking Gods glory, both in advancing and furthering all means
whereby it is furthered, and in opposing, hindering, and remoouing all the
impediments whereby it may be hindered. And this is to be showed in all other
virtues, as being the intension of them, and in all duties which we perform
unto God. So the Apostle tells us generally, that it is good to be zealously
affected always in a good thing. Gal. 4. 18.
Our love toward God, and hatred of sin, must be zealous and hot, and not
cold or lukewarm; our repentance must be joined with zeal; Be zealous and
amend. We must zealously worship and serve God, according Apoc. 3. 19.
to that of the Apostle; fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord. We must not Romans
12. 11. Tit. 2. 14. 1. These. 3. 10.
only do good works, but be zealous of them. We must pray with zeal
exceedingly, and power out our hearts like water before the Lord; with Lam. 2.
19.
zeal we must preach the Word, and be inwardly affected with that we speak,
that so also we may affect others; and we must with zeal hear the Word, and
even hunger and thirst after this spiritual food of our souls, 1. Pet. 2. 1.
that we may grow up thereby. But yet our care must be, that our zeal be
guided with knowledge, and not show it self in all things, but (as the Apostle
speaks) only in a good matter; and also that in advancing of the Gal. 4. 18.
means of Gods glory, and remoouing the impediments, we keep our selves
within the limits of our callings. Now the means to attain unto this zeal,
is to consider often and seriously how great things the Lord has done for us,
which will make us think that we can never be too earnest in seeking his
glory, nor too intent and fervent in all holy duties of his service. That it is
an inseparable property of all grace, to be zealous in them, and therefore
there can be no grace at all, where zeal is wanting. That is an undoubted
sign of those who are the redeemed of the Lord, to be zealous of good works:
and therefore where there is no zeal, there can be no Tit. 2. 14.
sign of redemption by Christ; finally, that luke-warmenesse is most loathsome
unto God, and that those who are so, he will spue out of his mouth. Apoc. 3. 17.


. Sect. 3 Of rejoicing in God, what it is, and the means whereby we may attain
unto it.
The second virtue arising from love, is joy and rejoicing in God, when being
assured of his love toward us, and loving him again, tasting for the present,
how good the Lord is, and persuading our selves of the full fruition of him in
the life to come, we are exceedingly delighted, and even glory in the assurance
and sense of Gods favor. For it is the nature of love to make us rejoice in
the thing beloved: and as the more excellent any thing is in our conceit, the
more our love exceeds, so according to the measure of our love, such also is
our joy when we enjoy it. And therefore needs must our joy and rejoicing in
God exceed all other joy, because our love ought to be proportioned to his
goodness and excellency, and our joy to our love. In which respect, this
divine joy swalloweth up all worldly grief, and causes us to glory, not only
in worldly prosperity, but also in persecution and tribulation. Romans 5. 3.
And this is that joy unto which the Scriptures exhort us: Rejoice in the Phil.
4. 4. 1. These. 5. 16. Psalm. 37. 4.
Lord always, and again, I say, Rejoice. Rejoice evermore. Delight thy self in
the Lord, and he will give thee the desires of thine heart. Which if we attain
unto, then have we even in this life, the first beginnings of our heavenly
happiness. For as the Apostle teaches us, the Kingdom of God Romans 14. 17.
consists in righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy Ghost. Now the means
to obtain this joy, is to labor after assurance that we are united unto
Christ; for we cannot have it in our selves, but in, and through him: according
to that of the Apostle, We joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, Romans 5.
11.
by whom now we have received the atonement. Secondly, if we would have this
joy, we must labor after the assurance of our justification, and remission of
our sins; for peace with God follows our justification by faith, Romans 5. 1,
3.
and joy this peace. Thirdly, let us labor after this assurance, that we are
the sons of God by adoption and grace, and to have it sealed unto us in our
hearts and consciences, by his holy Spirit, that so our assurance of our
heavenly inheritance, may uphold our joy and rejoicing in the midst of
temporary crosses and afflictions. Finally, let us labor to feel Gods love
shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, which we shall best discern, by
finding them inflamed with fervent love toward God, approved to be sincere,
by our care to flee all sin which is odious unto him, and embracing all
virtue and goodness which is acceptable in his sight. And if we enjoy God in
this mutual love, we shall in all estates glory and rejoice in it, and in the
midst of all worldly extremities, comfort our selves, with David, in the Lord
1. Sam. 30. 6. 1. These. 1. 6.
our God.

. Sect. 4 Of thankfulness unto God, what is required unto it; and the means of
it.
The third virtue arising from the love of God, is unfeigned thankfulness: for
when in consideration of Gods goodness, mercy, and bounty toward Psalm. 116.
12.
us, our hearts are inflamed with his love, and replenished with joy
unspeakable and glorious, then do we think, with David, what we may return
unto him for all his benefits; and finding no possible means of making the
least requital, in regard of our impotency, and Gods all sufficiency, we do
at last resolve to remain for ever thankful debtors, and to express our
thankfulness, both by our words in praising and magnifying, and in all our
actions by glorifying him our Benefactour, who has been so infinitely
gracious unto us, seeing we have nothing else to return unto him. So that our
love of God, proceeding from his love toward us, is the root of our
thankfulness, and our rejoicing in his love and goodness, an inseparable
companion of it. For this thankfulness is a virtue, whereby knowing,
acknowledging, and rejoicing in the sense and feeling of Gods love, goodness,
and bounty toward us, we are inwardly thankful unto him for all his
benefits, and outwardly express it, by praising and glorifying his holy Name,
both by our lips and lives, whereby it appears what is required to this
virtue of thankfulness. First, that we apprehend Gods love, and inwardly
rejoice in it, having our hearts thoroughly affected with the sense of his
goodness and bounty toward us. Secondly, that we do not ascribe the
blessings and benefits which we enjoy, unto any Jam. 1. 17.
thing else, but only unto God, as our supreme and chief Benefactour, who is
the principal Author of all our good. Thirdly, that we do not smother our
thankfulness in our hearts, but cause it to break forth, first, in our
words, by praising and magnifying Gods holy name; for as the Psalmist speaks,
It becomes the righteous to be thankful; and secondly, in Psalm. 33. 1.
our works, by doing those things which are pleasing unto God, in whom our
soul delights; that so the light of our godly lives shining before men, we
may cause them also to glorify our Father which is in heaven. Mat. 5. 16.
The which ought to be performed of us in all things and at all times, both in
prosperity and adversity, plenty and penury, health and sickness; according to
that of the Apostle, But be filled with the Spirit, speaking to your selves in
Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody Ephesians. 5.
18, 19.
in your hearts to the Lord; giving thanks always for all things unto God the
Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. An example whereof we have in
Job, who blessed the Lord when he was deprived of all his substance; Job 1. 21.
and in the Church grievously afflicted, who in the midst of all her
calamities, did acknowledge Gods mercies, in that they were not utterly Lam. 3.
32.
consumed. Now the means whereby we may be stirred up to this duty, and
enabled to perform it, are first to consider, that this thankfulness and
thanksgiving is good, pleasant and comely; according to that of the Psalmist;
Praise ye the Lord, for it is good to sing praises unto our God: for it is
Psalm. 147. 1.
pleasant, and praise is comely. Secondly, consider that it is the will of God
that we should be thankful unto him for all his benefits, which if we
perform, he requires nothing else at our hands, nor any other requital for
all his mercy and goodness toward us. And this reason the Apostle uses, 1.
These. 5. 18. Psalm. 50. 13, 14.
In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
concerning you. Thirdly, that it is most pleasing unto God, and that the
sacrifice of the calves of the lips is much more acceptable then of Bulls and
Goats. Fourthly, let us continually meditate upon Gods manifold and inestimable
mercies bestowed upon us in time past, his eternal love, our election,
creation, the great work of our redemption by the death of his only begotten
and dearly beloved Son, our vocation and effectual calling to the
participation of this great benefit, from which innumerable others are
excluded; our justification, sanctification, continual preservation, together
with our assured hope of glorificatio^, with all special blessings which from
day to day he bestows upon us. With all which, our hearts will be filled with
thankfulness, and our mouths with praises and thanksgiving, if we thoroughly
meditate on them: especially if withal we consider our unworthiness of the
least of Gods favors, and according to Jacobs example, Genesis 32. 10.
compare Gods inestimable mercies with our demerits. Lastly, let us meditate
and consider what a foul vice ingratitude is, and how vile and odious in the
sight of God and me^, that the Lord will never let it go unpunished, nor suffer
any to enjoy his benefits, who through their ingratitude will not acknowledge
them, nor render the praises which are due unto him.

. Sect. 5 Of obedience unto God, what it is, and wherein it consists; and of
the properties of true obedience.
The fourth and last virtue arising from the love of God, is obedience; which
is a fruit of our love, and thankfulness, whereby in all things we submit our
selves, our wills and actions, wholly unto Gods good will and pleasure, both in
doing all that he requires, and in patient suffering whatsoever he imposes. So
that this obedience is of two kinds. First, our active obedience to Gods Law,
whereby we conform our whole man unto the revealed will of God. The which is
an inseparable fruit of our love toward God, and an infallible note whereby
we may discern that which is sound and sincere, from that which is false and
counterfaite; for if we love God, we will keep his Commandments; And this is
the love of God, if we keep his Commandments, and his Commandments are not
grievous. The Ioh. 14. 15.
properties of this obedience are these: First, that it be absolute unto
whatsoever 1. Ioh. 5. 3.
God requires, and admit of no discourse of reason when we know his will; but
whether profit or disprofit, honor or disgrace, the favor or displeasure of
men do follow upon it, we are to do the things that he Act. 4. 19. and 5. 29.
inioyneth. Secondly, it must be total, both in respect of the object and
subject. In respect of the object, we must obey God in all his Commandments at
all times, neither adding nor detracting, nor declining therefrom Gal. 3. 10.
Deuteronomy. 12. 32. Ios. 1. 7.
on the right hand or on the left. Neither is it sufficient that we obey God
in some things, and neglect others, or in many and most things, and not in some
few: for he that thus sins in one thing, is guilty of all; but we must
propound unto our selves the whole Law of God for the rule Iam. 2. 10.
of our lives, observing one table as well as another, and worship him both in
holiness and righteousness, and that not only for some small time, but Luke
1. 74, 75.
all the days of our lives. In respect of the subject, our obedience must be
Deuteronomy. 11. 1.
with the whole man, and like our love from which it springs, it must be
performed with all our hearts, souls and strength. But especially the Lord
requires the inward obedience of the heart, wherein he chiefly Pro. 23. 26.
John 4. 23. Luke 1. 74. 2. Chro. 25. 2.
delights; we must worship him in spirit and truth, in sincerity and
uprightness of heart, as before his face, and in his sight and presence;
neither is it sufficient that we do that which is right, unless we do it
uprightly. It must be voluntary with cheerfulness and delight, as the Saints
and Angels do the will of God in heaven. For love makes every burden light,
and the Commandments of God not to be grievous. Yet this internal obedience
is not sufficient, unless the external be joined with it. 1. John 5. 3.
For God will be worshipped with the whole man, with our bodies, as well as
with our souls; with our outward actions, as well as with our inward
affections.

. Sect. 6 Of the means of obedience, whereby we may be enabled to perform it.
Now the means which may move and enable us to yield this obedience, are
these; first, we must consider that the Lord has created us to this 1. Cor. 6.
20. Luke 1. 74. Romans 6. 18.
end, that we should serve him, and to the same purpose, when we were by sin
utterly lost, has redeemed us with the inestimable price of his Sons most
precious blood, that we should worship him in holiness and righteousness
before him all the days of our lives, that being freed from sin, we should
become the servants of righteousness; and from the slavery of Satan, that we
should spend our days in Gods service. Secondly, let us meditate on the riches
of reward, and that liberal wages which the Lord has freely promised to give
unto those who faithfully serve him; in which respect we may justly say of our
active obedience, as the Apostle of our passive, that all our service in this
present world, is not worthy the glory Romans 8. 18. 2. Cor. 4. 17.
which shall be reueyled; for it is slight, short and imperfect, but shall
cause unto us a far more excellent and eternal weight of Glory. Thirdly, let
us consider, that though our best service be mingled with many imperfections,
and stained with our corruptions, yet God in Christ will accept of it, and not
only pardon our wants, but reward our wills and works. For he will Mal. 3. 17.
spare us, as a man spares his son that serves him, accepting of our will
for the deed, and of our sincere affections, as of perfect actions. Fourthly,
let us consider, that hereby we shall be assured of all Gods promises: for
Godliness is profitable for all things, having the promises of this life, and
of that 1. Tim. 4. 8.
which is to come. Neither does God require our obedience for his own sake;
(for he is most absolute in perfection, and our righteousness does not Job 22.
2. Psalm. 16. 3.
profit or extend unto him) but for our own good and benefit, that he may
crown our obedience with eternal blessedness. For he that keeps the Law,
happy is he; and he that hears Christ's Word, and keeps it, is by Pro. 29.
18. Luke 11. 28.
him pronounced blessed. Lastly, let us often propound unto our selves the
examples of Gods Saints and Servants, that have gone before us, and set before
us their obedience as a pattern for our imitation: For more cheerfully may we
travail in this way of holiness and righteousness, if we see a plain path
beaten by those that have gone before us. But especially let us set before us
the neuer-erring example of our Savior Christ, who took more delight in doing
his Fathers will, then in his meat and drink, and in all things was obedient
unto him to the death, even the John 4. 34. Phil. 2. 6, 7.
bitter death of the Cross, as the Apostle speaks.

. Sect. 7 Of passive obedience, and patience in afflictions.
The second kind of obedience is passive, and is called patience, which is a
fruit of our love and thankfulness toward God, whereby we submit our selves
meekely and constantly to bear all those crosses and afflictions, Gal. 5. 22.
which it shall please God to lay upon us. The causes of which patience are
diverse; the first and principal is the Spirit of God, of which it is a fruit.
Secondly, a lively faith, which not only apprehends the promise of eternal
happiness, with which our temporary afflictions are not to be compared, but
Gods special promises of strength to endure all trials, and of help and
deliverance in Gods due time. Thirdly, trust and affiance in God, who has
promised to be with us in all our afflictions, and never leave us to our own
weakness, or to the malice and fury of our enemies, upon which we conclude,
that though he kill us, yet we will trust in John 13. 15.
him. But the love of God is the next and immediate cause of our patience,
which makes us meekely to suffer whatsoever he imposes, who so loves us, and
whom we so love. For love endures all things, and the greatest difficulties
are not hard unto it. It is stronger then death, the waters 1. Cor. 13. 7.
Cant. 8. 6, 7.
of afflictions cannot quench it, and the floods of calamities cannot drown
it. The object of this patience is afflictions, which the Lord imposes for the
trial or correction of his children; for all, whom he loves, he chastises:
and whosoever will be Christ's Disciple, must deny himself, take up Heb. 12.
Luke 9. 23.
his Cross, and follow him, that is, that cross and measure of afflictions
which God himself imposes upon him: Neither are we to take upon us burdens
of our own making, but such only as the Lord allotteth unto us; which are
those alone that we cannot by lawful means avoid, or without falling into
sin. The manner how we are to bear these afflictions, is first voluntarily,
with a meek, quiet and contented mind, as being sent of God for our good, yea
cheerfully and joyfully, as they are signs and seals of our adoption, and
special means to further and assure our everlasting salvation. Secondly, we
must bear them constantly, so long as it shall please God to continue them
upon us, that is, till he gives us honest Iam. 1. 4.
and lawful means to be freed and delivered from them; not thinking it enough
that we have borne some few, or many afflictions, but holding out unto the end:
for he is not crowned who has fought well for a time, but he that never gives
over, till he have obtained the victory, acording to that of our Savior; Be
faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the 2. Cor. 4. 16. Apoc. 2. 10.
Crown of life. But of these points, as also of the means whereby we may be
enabled with patience, comfort and joy to endure afflictions, I have written
largely Christian Warfare the third part.
elsewhere, and therefore will content my self thus briefly to have touched
them in this place.

CAP. VI.
Of the fear of God, and humility which arises from it, joined with his love.
And of Gods external worship with the body.

. Sect. 1 Of the fear of God, what it is, and the causes of it.
THe fourth and last main virtue required in this Commandment, is the fear
of God; whereby I understand, not that servile and slavish fear which is in
wicked men, and the very devils themselves, in the apprehension of his justice,
wrath, and power, in punishing sin; but that filial and sonne-like fear,
whereby knowing, believing, and remembering not only Gods Justice, truth,
majesty, power and dominion our all creatures, but also his infinite love,
goodness, and mercy toward us in Jesus Christ, we fear his displeasure, who
is so glorious and gracious, as the greatest evil. In which description is
expressed the grounds and causes of the true fear of God, namely, the
knowledge, belief, and remembrance of Gods attributes; As first, that he is a
just God, and will not let sin go unpunished; with which consideration Mat.
10. 28.
our Savior inciteth us to Gods fear, because he justly casts into hell
those that sin against him. Secondly, that he is true of his Word, in his
promises to those that serve and please him, and his threatenings against Psalm.
33. 7, 8.
those that displease and sin against him. Thirdly, his majesty and glory, in
that he is the supreme Lord, and most glorious King of heaven and earth, which
is alone sufficient to strike an awful fear of God in the hearts of all
creatures. Fourthly, that he is a most powerful and mighty God, and so able to
execute all his judgments, and not only to kill the body, but also to cast
both body and soul into the everlasting fire of hell, as our Savior speaks.
Lastly, his dominion over all creatures, whereby Luke 12. 5.
they are obnoxious and liable to his justice and punishments, is effectual to
strike fear into the hearts of all men; according to that of Malachie, If I be
a master, where is my fear? and that of Jeremy, Who would not fear Mal. 1.
6. Ier. 10. 6, 7.
thee, O King of nations? for unto thee does it appertain. For howsoever the
faithful being in Christ, can receive no hurt from these attributes; for his
justice is satisfied for their sins, and there is no condemnation unto Romans
8. 1.
them, his threatenings do not belong unto them, but contrariwise his sweet
and gracious promises; his majesty, power, and dominion, are arguments of joy
and comfort, seeing they are wholly for their protection and preservation: yet
do the children of God fear, in respect of these attributes, when they
consider them in their own nature, and see the effects of them in wicked men,
even as the son fears his father, when he sees him punish his slave,
though he be sure that he shall never taste of the same stripes, and
reuerenceth him in respect of his power, justice, gravity, and authority over
him, though he expects nothing from them but all good. So the Apostle Peter
uses this argument: And if ye call on 1. Pet. 1. 17.
the Father, who without respect of persons, judges according to every man's
work, pass the time of your soiourning here in fear. And the Apostle Paul
uses Gods severity to the rejected Jews, as a reason to make us to fear God;
and exhorts us to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Rom 11.
28. Phil. 2. 12.
Besides, being partly flesh as well as Spirit, and therefore full of
infirmities and corruptions, it is profitable for the unregenerate part, which
is a slave, and not a son, to be contained in duty, and restrained from
sin, by the fear of Gods Justice, power, and punishments. For our love being
imperfect, our fear cannot attain in this life to filial perfection, but so
far forth as we are unregenerate, is servile and slavish. And to this end
are Gods judgments denounced, and punishments inflicted, in the Heb. 3. 12,
13. Psalm. 119. 120. 1. Cor. 10. 6, 11.
hearing and sight of the godly, that they may fear to offend so just and
mighty a God, and so escape these fearful punishments. But the chief grounds
and causes of Gods fear in the hearts of his children, are saving knowledge,
and a lively faith, whereby being assured of Gods love in Christ, we love him
again, and are above all things afraid to do any thing which is displeasing
in his sight; either in the omission of any duty, or commission of any sin,
which our gracious and loving Father either commands or forbids.

. Sect. 2 That this fear of God is commended unto us in the Scriptures, and of
the great profit of it.
And this is that fear of God, which in the Scriptures is so much commended
unto us, and causes those, who in their hearts embrace it, to be Pro. 28. 14.
Deuteronomy. 6. 13. and 10. 12.
happy and blessed, according to that of Solomon, Blessed is the man that
fears always: which blessedness that we may attain unto, let us labor after
this fear, and to this end let us consider the excellency and profit of it,
that our hearts being inflamed with the love of it, we may carefully use all
good means whereby we may obtain it. The excellency of it herein appears,
in that it compriseth in it all other duties, and is usually put for the whole
service of God, wherein the whole man is to be employed, according to that of
Solomon, Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter, Eccles. 12. 13.
Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole of man. Secondly,
it is called in this respect, the head and beginning of wisdom, that is,
Psalm. 111. 10. Pro. 1. 7.
of all godliness and true Religion. Thirdly, it gives grace and virtue unto
all other duties, and makes them acceptable in Gods sight: For our whole
conversation must be a constant walking in Gods fear. In it we Act. 9. 31.
must worship and serve God. Serve the Lord with fear. And in thy fear will I
worship toward thine holy Temple. By it our sanctification is perfected, Ps.
2. 11. and 5. 7. 2. Cor. 7. 1. Phil. 2. 12.
and our salvation wrought out and finished. The profit of this fear of God is
also inestimable; for it restrains us from all vice and sin, according to
that of Solomon, A wise man fears and departs from evil; and of Pro. 14.
16. and 8. 13. Psalm. 4. 4. Genesis 39. 9.
David, Stand in awe, and sin not. As we see in the example of Joseph, who
had his ears and heart stopped against the unchaste allurements of his
mistress by the fear of God. And of the Egyptian Midwiues, who by the Exodus
1. 17, 21.
fear of God, were kept from obeying the wicked edict of the King. Whereas
contrariwise, the want of this fear is the cause of all disobedience and
sin, as Abraham implies in his speech to Pharaoh; and the Genesis 20. 11.
Apostle plainly expresses: for having set down a Catalogue of many sins,
he concludes with this as the cause of all the rest; There is no fear Romans 3.
15.
of God before their eyes. Secondly, it is a fountain of life, making us to
depart Pro. 14. 27.
from the snares of death. Thirdly, it incites and inables us to the
performance of all good duties; and therefore the Lord having delivered his
Law, wishes that the hearts of his people might be always fraughted Deuteronomy. 5.
29.
with his fear, that thereby they might be moved to obey it: and the
Preacher in this respect, compriseth in it alone all other virtues and duties,
Pro. 15. 33. Eccl. 12. 13.
because it moves us to the embracing of them all. Fourthly, it delivers
from all other fears; and causes them to give place when it is present, as
the Sun all other inferior lights. For if we fear God, we will not fear
the threatenings of men; if we fear him that can cast body and soul into hell,
we need not fear them that can only, and that by his Act. 5. 29. Luke 12. 5.
permission, kill the body, as our Savior implies. Fifthly, it makes us
partakers of all good things promised in this life, for he that fears the
Psalm. 34. 9. Esa. 66. 2.
Lord, wants nothing which is good; but God is present with such, to take
notice of all their wants; and his ears are open to hear their prayers Psalm.
145. 19.
and grant their desires. Finally, it brings with it everlasting
blessedness; For blessed is the man that fears the Lord, that walks in his
ways. Psalm. 128. 1. and 112. Pro. 28. 14.
And happy is the man that fears always: but he that hardens his heart,
shall fall into mischief. Which promises belong not alone to those that fear
God, but also to their posterity after them; for their seed shall be mighty
Psalm. 112. 2.
upon earth, and their generation blessed, as the Psalmist speaks.

. Sect. 3 Of the means of obtaining this fear of God.
Now the means of attaining unto this fear of God are diverse. First, to
consider and meditate of Gods nature and attributes, as of his omnisciency,
whereby he sees all things, even the secret corners of our hearts; of his
omnipotency, whereby he is able to reward us if we fear him, or punish us if
we neglect him; of his Justice, whereby he impartially judges all men without
respect of persons; of his truth, which never fails in his promises or
threatenings: But especially of his mercy and goodness toward us in Christ,
which will inflame our hearts with his love, and out of this love cause us to
fear his displeasure as the greatest evil; according to that of the Psalmist,
There is mercy or forgiveness with thee, that thou may be feared. The
second means, is the consideration of Gods Judgments Psalm. 130. 4.
executed on the wicked, which are so many instructions unto us, to fear God
and avoid his displeasure, that we be not partakers with them in their
punishments. So the Psalmist says, that the righteous seeing the destruction
of the wicked, should fear God, and deride their folly; and the Apostle Psalm.
52. 6.
tells us, that the former examples of Gods Judgments were written for 1.
Cor. 10. 11.
our learning, that they might admonish us to take warning by their harms,
lest we fall into the same evils. The third means, is the diligent reading and
hearing of the Scriptures, which are called, The fear of God, Psalm. 19. 9.
because they work his fear in us. And thus the Lord inioyneth the King to
have the Law with him, and to read therein all the days of his life, that he
Deuteronomy. 17. 19.
may learn to fear the Lord his God. For in them are contained many
Commandments, inioyning many exhortations moving, and many reasons persuading
to this fear. Fear the Lord with reverence, and rejoice Psalm. 2. 11.
with trembling. Let all the earth fear the Lord, let all the inhabitants of
the earth stand in awe of him; for he spoke, and it was done; he commanded, and
it stood fast. O fear the Lord, all ye his Saints, for there is no want to
them that Psalm. 33. 8, 9. and 34. 9. Isa. 8. 13. Heb. 12. 28.
fear him. The fourth means, is to deny our selves and our own wisdom, and
when God commands any thing, not to ask counsel of carnal reason, unto
which the more we incline, the more the fear of God abateth in us, as we see
in the example of Eve, who following sense and reason, obeyed the devils
advice, and cast off the fear of God. And this the Wiseman implies: Be not
wise in thine own eyes, but fear God, and Pro. 3. 7.
depart from evil. The fifth means, is, to meditate often on our own
infirmities and weakness, and of the malice and might of our spiritual 1.
Pet. 5. 8. Ephesians. 6. 11, 12. Phil. 2. 12. 1. Cor. 12. 10.
enemies; which will make us work out our salvation with fear and trembling,
and whilst we stand, to take heed of falling. The sixth is, to remember our
end daily and continually; as first, the day of our death, which will work our
hearts to Gods fear, as the Psalmist implies: and Psalm 90. 12.
secondly, the day of Judgment and end of the world, which is called, The 2.
Cor. 5. 11. (...). 2. Pet. 3. 11, 14.
terror of the Lord, because it is a notable means to work his fear in our
hearts. The last and chief means, whereby all the rest are made effectual,
is fervent prayer. For it is no natural faculty or habit, but the gift of God,
which he promises to put in the hearts of the faithful, that they Ier. 32.
39, 40.
may not depart from him: and is to be obtained by faithful and effectual
prayer: As we see in the example of the Psalmist, who prays the Lord to knit
their hearts unto him, that they might fear his Name. Psalm. 86. 11.


. Sect. 4 Of humility, what it is, and the causes of it.
The last virtue required, is humility, whereby knowing and acknowledging Gods
power, justice, majesty, goodness, mercy, and infinite perfection, and our
own vileness, and unworthiness, imperfections, and sinful corruptions, we
do renounce all glory and praise, as not belonging unto us, and ascribe it
wholly unto God, unto whom alone it rightly appertains So that it is the
nature of humility, to vilify and abase our selves in our own sight, even to
the ground, as the word imports, to cast off all opinion of our works and
worthiness, and in the sight and sense of our sins and corruptions, to
acknowledge our selves worthy of Gods most heavy punishments in this life and
the life to come; and contrariwise, to ascribe all glory and praise unto God
alone, even of all the good we have in us, or is done by us, from whom alone we
have it; according to that of the Psalmist, Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us,
but unto thy Psalm. 115. 1.
name give the glory: And of Daniel, O Lord, righteousness belongs unto Dan.
9. 7, 11.
thee, but unto us confusion of faces, because we have sinned against thee.
The causes of this humility, are first, the knowledge and acknowledgement of
Gods infiniteness in all excellency, goodness, and perfection; in which he is
so incomprehensibly glorious, that when we come in his presence, it makes us
to vilify and abase our selves, what opinion soever before we had of our own
worth and excellency, even as the light of a Glowworme is quite dazeled, when
the glorious beams of the Sun do shine upon it. Thus in the sight and sense
of Gods glory and majesty, Ezechiel was cast to the ground; Manoah concluded
that he should Ezech. 2. 1. Judge. 13. 22. Esa. 6. 5.
die; Esayas cries out, Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of
unclean lips, etc. for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. And
Job having seen the Lord, abhorred himself, and repented in dust and ashes.
Job 42. 6.
Especially if we consider that this God, mighty and glorious in himself, is
so infinitely gracious unto us, in conferring upon us so innumerable benefits,
and above all, that inestimable gift of his only Son, to work that great
work of our Redemption. The consideration whereof, will make us to humble our
selves with Jacob, and to confess that we are less then the least of Gods
mercies, and to say with David, Who am I and my 2. Sam. 7. 18, 22.
house, that thou have brought me hitherto? wherefore thou art great, O Lord
God* for there is none like thee, etc. Secondly, the knowledge and
acknowledgement of our own vileness and unworthiness; both in regard of our
bodies, which are but dust and ashes, as Abraham acknowledges; and in respect
Genesis 18. 27.
of our souls, which howsoever they were created according to Gods Image, in
wisdom, holiness, and righteousness, yet through the fall of our first
parents, and the corruption derived from them unto us, they are wholly defiled
in all the powers and faculties of them, with original corruption, and loaded
with the guilt of innumerable numbers of actual transgressions, whereby we are
made subject to the wrath of God, the curse of the Law, the plagues and
punishments of this life, and eternal death and condemnation in the life to
come. In which regard we have just cause to humble our selves with the
prodigal son, and to say with him; Father, I have sinned against heaven and
earth, and am no more Luke 15.
worthy to be called thy son. And if there be any good thing in us, or done
by us, to acknowledge with the Apostle, that we have it of Gods free 1. Cor.
15. 10.
grace, seeing of our selves, we are not able so much as to think a good
thought, 2. Cor. 3. 5. Phil. 2. 13.
but it is God alone that works in us both the will and the deed.

. Sect. 5 Of the excellency and vtility of humility.
And this is that humility, which as it is in it self most excellent, so unto
us most profitable, and therefore of us to be much esteemed, and earnestly 1.
Pet. 5. 5.
desired. It is most excellent, as being the most beautiful ornament, which
makes us appear glorious in the sight of God, in which respect, the Apostle
exhorts us to deck our selves with it. Yea it adorneth all other virtues,
making them (as the foil, the Jewel) being in themselves rich and beautiful,
much more precious and glorious in the sight of God and men. It is most
profitable also: for when we humble our selves, and become even with the earth,
we are thereby preserved from falling, and when we judge our selves, we shall
not be judged of the Lord. Yea if we humble our selves, the Lord will exalt
us: and if with the poor Publicane we 1. Cor. 15. 32. Luke 18. 12.
acknowledge our sins, we shall depart justified, and find God faithful 1.
Ioh. 1. 9.
of his promise in forgiving us our sins. So the Apostle James, Humble your
selves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. And the Apostle Jam.
4. 10. Pro. 15. 35.
Peter, Humble your selves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may
exalt you in due time. And thus the Lord exalts the humble, by enriching them
with all his gifts, both temporal, spiritual, and eternal. With temporal
benefits, for by humility and the fear of the Lord, are riches, honor, Pro.
22. 4.
and life. With spiritual graces; for he resists the proud, but gives his
1. Pet. 5. 5.
grace to the humble. He fills the hungry with good things, but sends the
proud empty away. For he Psalm. 25. 9. Mat 11. 25. Pro. 11. 2.
teaches them his ways, and reuealeth unto them the secrets of his Kingdom,
making them thereby wise unto their salvation. He gives them the grace of
justification, and the Luk 18. 12. Mat. 11. 28.
forgiveness of of all their sins. He makes them Genesis 32. 10. 1. Chro. 29.
15.
thankful in prosperity, acknowledging themselves with Jacob and David, less
then the least of Gods mercies, and that all the good which they have, they
have received it from God; and not only patient, but also thankful Lam. 3.
22.
in greatest afflictions; acknowledging that it is the mercies of the Lord that
they are not utterly consumed. He blesses them with his Esa. 57. 15. Job 22.
29.
presence, taking delight to dwell with them, that are of an humble heart and
contrite spirit; and so with his power and providence safegardeth them from all
evil. Finally, in the life to come, he crowns humility with eternal glory
and felicity, according to that of our Savior; Blessed are the poor in
spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom Mat. 5. 3.
of heaven. So that, humility is not only it self a most excellent grace, but
the chief means also of obtaining all other graces, seeing God gives them
only to the humble. For they only shall have the riches of Gods best and most
precious gifts, who will be thankful unto God for them; those only are
thankful, who highly esteem them; and they alone make this estimate, who
have felt the want of them, and earnestly desired them; and they and no other
have thus done, who are thoroughly humbled in the sight and sense of their own
poverty, emptiness, and nakedness.

. Sect. 6 Of the means whereby we may attain unto humility.
And thus, when our hearts are enlarged with that love of this excellent and
profitable grace, let us in the next place carefully use all good means,
whereby we may be decked and adorned with it. And first we must often and
seriously meditate upon Gods excellency and infiniteness in wisdom, glory,
power, justice, and goodness, and then the opinion of our own worth will
vanish, like the light of a candle, when the Sun shines in its full
brightness, and our seeming perfection which much pleased us, when we beheld
it alone, or compared it with others who come short of us, will appear to be
nothing but imperfection, and we vile and of no worth in our own eyes.
Secondly, let us compare our state as it is, with that it was in our creation,
and there will be great cause of humiliation, in the best gifts and graces in
us, seeing they are but the ruins of an old building, and like base worne-out
rags of sumptuous apparel. Thirdly, let us compare our virtues and duties,
with that which the Law requires, and so we shall have good cause to be cast
down in the sight of our imperfection, when we see what perfection, even upon
the penalty of the curse it exacteth of us. Fourthly, let us meditate on the
matter whereof we are made, and into which we shall again be resolved; and
then may we in all humility say with Job to corruption, Thou art my father,
and to the Job 17. 14.
worm, Thou art my mother and my sister; yea with David, that we are worms
and no men: And acknowledge with Abraham, that we are but dust and Psalm. 22.
6. Genesis 18. 27.
ashes, unworthy to appear in Gods presence, or to make any suite unto him.
Fifthly, let us set our many and grievous sins before us, our original
corruption, which is the root of all wickedness, and our actual
transgressions, both of omission and commission; and withal, the wrath of God,
and curse of the Law due unto them; and this will make us with the Publicane to
cast down our eyes, and smite our breasts, and with broken and contrite hearts
to cry out, God, be merciful unto me a sinner. Luke 18.
Sixthly, with our graces and virtues, let us compare our vices and
corruptions, and so our few grains of gold will be covered with such a mass
of dross, our small quantity of good corn mixed with so much chafe, that our
good parts will not so much lift us up, as our ill will pull down and humble
us, if we weigh them in the balance of an impartial judgment. Seventhly, let
us remember that we have nothing but what we have received, 1. Cor. 4. 7. and
15. 10.
and that by the grace of God we are that we are; and therefore let us not
boast, as though we had not received them, but retaining the joy and comfort of
Gods graces unto our selves, let us return all the praise and Iam. 1. 17.
glory unto him whose gifts they are; and not carry our selves as proud owners,
but as humble and thankful debtors. Eighthly, let us consider, that what good
things soever are in us, they are the Lords talents, of Luke 16. 2.
which we must give an account at the day of Judgment, and that we are
Stewards, and not absolute owners of the gifts which we have received; and so
our greater gifts will work in us greater humility, seeing they are but
receipts, and consequently debts, for which we shall be accountant unto God,
how we have employed them. Ninthly, let us remember, that though we have never
so many virtues and graces, yet if pride be mixed with them, it will spoil
them all; seeing it is the poison of all virtues, a small portion whereof will
infect a great quantity of wholesome meat and drink. Whereas humility is such
an ornament, as will add much to their native beauty, and make them truly
glorious in the sight of God and men. Tenthly, let us set before us the
examples of Gods servants, who as they have excelled in all other graces, so
also in humility, as of Abraham, Job, David, Paul; but especially of our
Savior Christ himself, the most perfect pattern of humility, who being the
Sovereign Monarch of heaven and earth, disdained not to wash his Apostles
feet; and being equal with his Father in all glory and Majesty, yet made
himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and being
made like unto men, humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the
death of the Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8.
cross. Lastly, if we would attain to true humility, we must not content our
selves with the sparing and seldom use of these means, but exercise our
selves daily in them, because pride will not easily leave his hold, and though
it be once or twice, or many times repelled, yet will it recover new strength,
and make against us fresh assaults, yea it will spring sometimes from the root
of virtues, and even like the Phoenix, when it is consumed with the fire of
Gods Spirit, it will re-enliue it self, and out of its own ashes recover
birth and being.

. Sect. 7 Of external worship with our bodies.
And thus much concerning those virtues whereby we have God inwardly in our
hearts. Besides which, there is also required, that we have him outwardly in
our bodies and external actions; and that is, when as with the outward man we
serve and worship him. The which also we owe unto God, seeing he has created
and redeemed both our 1. Cor. 6. 20.
souls and bodies, that we should in both perform service unto him. And
though alone it be of small value, for as the Apostle says, Bodily 1. Tim. 4.
8.
exercize profits nothing, yet does the Lord require it with the other, and
that with the sweet incense of the heart and mind, we offer Romans 12. 1.
our bodies also a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto him: which Daniel
thought to be a matter of such moment, that he chose rather to Dan. 6.
be cast into the Lions den, then to neglect it for the space of a few
days. Our Savior also requires, not only that we have in us the heat of
spiritual graces, but that also that we cause their light to shine out before
men, that they seeing our good works, may glorify our Father Matthew. 5. 16.
which is in heaven. For as natural fire does retain its virtue and strength,
when as it has some outward vent, and when that is stopped, is choked and
presently dies; so do our inward graces and virtues live and flourish, when
they have the outward vent of corporal obedience, and external works of
piety and righteousness, but soon languish and are extinguished, if they
never put forth themselves in these outward exercises. Now this external
honor, is either in outward signs or actions. Of the former sort, is
religious adoration in external signs and gestures, as prostrating the body,
uncovering the head, bending the knee, lifting up the hands, which being
considered as religious gestures, are proper and peculiar to God alone. Of the
other sort is the outward service of God, in calling upon him, vowing unto him,
Apoc. 19. 20. 22. 9.
swearing by his Name, celebrating feasts to his honor, and all outward
obedience to the Law, which, in respect of the person to whom they are to be
performed, namely, God alone and no other, are all required in the first
Commandment.

CAP. VII.
Of the duties which are required in the second Commandment, as Prayer,
hearing the Word, and administration of the Sacraments.

. Sect. 1 Of the things generally required in the second Commandment.
WE have showed that the first Commandment requires, that we serve and
worship Jehovah, the only true God. In the three other Commandments of the
first Table, is showed how he is to be worshipped, and the time when. The
manner of his worship is, how he is to be served in his solemn and set
service, required in the second Commandment, or how he is to be glorified at
all times in the whole course of our lives in the third. The time when he is
principally to be worshipped, is upon his Sabbaths, required in the fourth
Commandment. In the second Commandment, God requires that we worship him the
true God, after a right and lawful manner, and by such means as are agreeable
to his nature, and which in his Word he has prescribed unto us, unto which
we ought not to add, from which we ought not to detract any thing, as has
before been showed. For this is our reasonable service, to worship so great a
God, not after our own fantasies, but according Deuteronomy. 4. 2. and 12. 8, 32.
Ios. 1 7. Pro. 30. 6. Apoc. 22. 18.
to his own will, and with such a service in which he delights. Now he
delights in such a worship as is agreeable to his nature; which being
spiritual and true, yea Truth it self, it follows, that we must worship
him by spiritual and true means, and after a spiritual and true manner, that
is, we must conform all the service which we offer unto God, according to
the prescript rule of his Word. And thus we are to worship God, both inwardly
with our souls, and outwardly with our bodies; Privately by our selves, in our
families, and publicly in the congregation, in which we are to perform all
our service, with unanimity and joint affection, as if we all worshipped God
with one heart and mind; and with uniformity in all outward rites and actions,
as if we had all but one body. Act. 2. 1. and 8. 6.
Contrariwise, the Lord in this Commandment, forbids both the contempt and
neglect of his worship, which is the sin of Atheists and profane persons; and
also worshipping him by false means, and after a false manner; as first, all
will worship and superstition, which is devised by men's brain, and out of a
good meaning and intention offered unto him in stead of his true service: of
which sort is the making of any Image to represent God thereby, or any other
for religious use; the worshipping of these Images, or of any thing else
besides the true God; by offering unto them any part of that religious service
which is proper and peculiar to him alone: As religious adoration, Invocation,
dedicating Churches, and consecrating of festiuals to their honor and such
like. Secondly, all irreuerence in Gods service: As when the external worship
is performed without the inward, with deceitful lips, and not with the
heart, and in spirit and truth, which is the service of Hypocrites. Lastly,
Mat. 15. 8, 9.
when as the public service is performed without any unanimity of the heart,
or uniformity of external rites and ceremonies, or with such as are uncomely,
apish, light, and opposite to the use of edifying. 1. Cor. 14. 40.


. Sect. 2 Of prayer and invocation.
And these are the things which generally are commanded or forbidden in this
Commandment. The special duties which are here principally required, are
three, Invocation, preaching and hearing the Word, and the administration of
the Sacraments. In respect of the first, there is 1. These. 5. 17. 1. John 5. 14.
first required that we pray, and the neglect hereof condemned. Secondly, that
we pray according to Gods will, performing those things therein which in his
Word he requires. And these are either essential unto prayer or accidental.
The things essential, respect either the person unto Psalm. 50. 15. Luke 11. 2.
Ephe. 2. 12. John 16. 23. Romans 8 26, 27.
whom we must pray, which is God only and no other; or the person in whose name
alone we must pray, namely, Jesus Christ, and not in the mediation or
intercession of any creature. Thirdly, by whose help, to wit, the holy Ghost,
who helps our infirmities, and teaches us to pray as we ought. Fourthly,
After what manner, that is, before prayer with due preparation, and in prayer
in respect of our souls, that we pray in the Psalm. 108. 1. Eccle 4. 17. Col.
3. 16. 1. Cor. 14. 15.
spirit, and not with the lips alone, nor with wandering thoughts. In our
minds, that we pray with understanding, and not in an unknown tongue, nor in
ignorance, not conceiving what we utter with our mouths. In our Eccles. 5. 1.
Genesis 32. 10.
hearts, that we pray with reverence in respect of God, and humility in respect
of our selves. In our bodies there is required, that we use such voice and
gestures, as are most fit to stir up our affections and devotions 1. Cor. 14.
40.
to the religious performing of this duty. Lastly, there is required, that we
pray for those things which are good and lawful, having Mat. 7. 11.
all our suites warranted by the Word of God. The things accidental required
in prayer, are the circumstances of persons, place or time. In respect of
persons, prayer is either public in the Congregation, or private. In respect
of the place, prayer is not limited, 1. Tim. 2. 8.
but we have liberty in all places to lift up pure hands unto God. In respect
of the time, we must pray without ceasing, as often as any 1. These. 5. 17.
fit opportunity and occasion is offered. The kinds of prayer, are Iam. 1. 5.
and 5. 16. and 1. 6. Mat. 21. 22.
either petition or thanksgiving. In all our petitions there is required, 1. A
sense of our wants. 2. Fervent desires to have them supplied. 3. A special
faith, that our requests shall be granted, grounded upon Gods promises. After
our petitions made, we must quietly rest upon God, persuading our selves that
we shall obtain them in due time. Secondly, we must carefully use all good
means, which may serve Gods providence in conferring these blessings upon us.
Thirdly, If we do not presently obtain, we must persevere in prayer without
fainting or weariness. The other part of prayer is giving of thanks, whereby
we praise God for all his benefits, either received or promised, unto which
the same things are Col. 3. 16. Phil. 1. 4.
to be fitted, which were generally required in prayer, as that they be rendered
to God alone, in the name of Christ, by the holy Ghost, with understanding in
our minds, and reverence and humility, with thankfulness and cheerfulness
in our hearts.

. Sect. 3 Of the duties of Gods Ministers.
And so much of the duties respecting prayer. Those that respect the ministry
of the Word, are of two sorts; the first respect Gods Ministers Romans 10. 15. 2.
Cor. 5. 18, 19.
that preach it. The second, the people that hear it. In respect of the
Minister, it is required first, that his person be qualified and fitted for
this high function, in which regard he ought to be once lawfully called to
this office inwardly by God, and outwardly by the Church. Secondly, he is to
have his calling approved and sealed unto him by his sufficiency 1. Tim. 3. 2.
Esa. 6. 8.
of gifts, both in knowledge and utterance; and willingness of mind to employ
them to Gods glory, and good of his people. Secondly, for the matter which he
preaches, it is required, that he deliver nothing but that which is grounded
upon the pure Word of God, and that he rightly expound 1. These. 2. 13. 2. Cor.
2. 17.
the Scriptures by the Scriptures; and divide the Word of God aright, both in
observing profitable doctrines out of the Text, and in applying them to his
hearers, for instruction in the truth, confutation of 1. Tim. 3. 16.
errors, exhortations to duties, reproof of offenders, and consolation of the
weak and afflicted. Thirdly, for the manner, there is required that he speak
in the evidence of the Spirit, as if God by him did speak unto 1. Cor. 2 4.
the people. Secondly, in simplicity without any impiety of humane inue^tions,
or affectation to show his own learning and gifts. 3. in integrity and
vprightnes 1. Cor. 2. 4, 5. 2. Cor. 4. 2. 2 Timothy 2. 15. 1. These. 2. 4. 1. Cor.
4. 2. Mat. 7. 29. Tit. 2. 15. and 2. 7. Ezech. 3. 8, 9. Ephesians. 6. 19. John 7.
18. 2. Cor. 11. 2.
as in Gods sight and presence, chiefly aiming to please God and men. 4. In
fidelity, having in his ministry no respect of persons; but delivering Gods
message impartially to the noble and base, rich and poor, friends and
strangers all alike. Fifthly, with authority and power, according to the
example of our Savior, not fearing the face of any gainsayer or opposer.
Sixthly, with all gravity, as becomes the waightinesse of his Embassage.
Seventhly, with all liberty and freedom of speech and spirit, taxing and
reproving sin wheresoever he finds it. And finally, with fervent zeal of
Gods glory, and the salvation of the people.

. Sect. 4 Of the duties of hearers, and such as respect their preparation.
The duties which respect the hearing of the Word, are of three sorts. The
first, such as are to be performed before we hear, which Eccles. 4. 17. Heb.
4. 2. Luke 8. 13, 14. Ier. 4. 4.
are two principally. The one, that we fit and prepare our selves, before we
presume to approach into Gods presence to perform this holy duty; the which is
done, partly by remoouing those impediments which might hinder us, as
infidelity, impenitencie, carnal security, worldly distractions and
earthly-mindednesse, profaneness and small esteem of the Word, excessive
eating or drinking, conceit of our own knowledge, as though little or nothing
could be added unto it, prejudice and forestalled opinions of our teachers,
hypocrisy, curiosity, itching Iam. 1. 21. Luke 18. 34. Acts 17. 20. 2. Tim. 4.
3. 1. Cor. 1. 11, 12.
ears, factious affections, whereby men have the truth of God in respect of
persons, hearing or not hearing, according to that opinion which they have
conceived of him that speaks. And partly, this preparation consists in
using all good helps and means, which may enable us to the careful and
conscionable hearing of the Word. As to consider the waightinesse of the action
which we are about to perform, namely, an high and holy service unto God,
which will further and seal up unto us our salvation or condemnation, and be
either the savor of life unto life, or of death unto death, soften us like
wax, or harden us like clay, and make us one step nearer either to heaven or
hell. For Gods Word shall never return void, but accomplish what he pleases,
and shall prosper in the thing whereto he sends it. Secondly, to meditate on
the ends for Esa. 55. 11.
which we hear, which are, to glorify God in the means of our salvation, to
be built up in all saving grace, knowledge, faith, obedience, love of God,
zeal, patience, and the rest. Thirdly, we must examine our selves to find out
our sins, that we may gather strength for the mortifying of them; and our
spiritual wants, that we may have them supplied in this spiritual market of
our souls. Fourthly, we must renew our repentance, Heb. 4. 2.
that we come not in our sins; and our faith, without which our hearing will
not profit us. Finally, we must use faithful and fervent prayer, that God will
so assist with his holy Spirit, the Minister in speaking, and us in hearing,
and sanctify to our use his holy ordinances, that they may be effectual to
build us up in our most holy faith, and more and more enrich us with all
sanctifying and saving graces. And being thus prepared, our next duty is, that
setting aside all worldly impediments, we resort unto the holy assemblies, to
be made partakers of Gods holy Word, that we may profit thereby.

. Sect. 5 Of the duties required in hearing, and after we have heard.
The second sort of duties respect the action of hearing it self, unto which
is required, that we set our selves in the presence of God, and (...)s. 10.
33. ^. These. 2. 13. (...) 4. 20. ^ 19. 48.
hear the Word preached, not as the word of mortal man, but as the Word of
the everliving God; with all fear and reverence, with all diligence and
attention, with alacrity and cheerfulness, humility and a good conscience,
avoiding (as much as lies in us) all distractions, wandering thoughts, private
reading, dullness, drowzinesse and carnal weariness. Finally, with hungring
and thirsting after the food of our souls, and earnest desire to profit by
it. To which end we must apply and fit our selves to every thing which is
spoken to profit by it, whether it be doctrine, Luke 8. 15. and 2 19. Pro. 4.
21.
confutation, reproof or consolation, receive the Word into good and honest
hearts, and there reserve it as a precious treasure for our use in the whole
course of our lives and conversation. The third and last sort are those duties
which are to be performed after we have heard; which are, First, to meditate on
that which has been delivered unto us, that we may imprint it in our
memories, and work it into our hearts. Secondly, conference with others, that
we may be mutual helpers for the understanding, remembering, embracing and
practicing of that which we have heard. Thirdly, that we sanctify the Word
unto our use by effectual prayer, desiring that God will give a blessing unto
it, and make it effectual by his Spirit for the inlightning of our minds, the
sanctifying of our hearts and affections, and the reforming and amending of our
sinful lives. Lastly, we must on every fit occasion call to mind what we have
Romans 2. 13. Iam. 1. 22. Luke 8. 15.
heard, that we may bring it unto use, and conscionably practice what we have
learned.

. Sect. 6 Of the administration of the Sacraments.
The third sort of duties required in this Commandment, respect the
administration of the Sacraments, which are only two, Baptism, and the Lords
Supper. Unto both which it is generally required, that they be administered.
First, by a lawful Minister and no other. Secondly, only to those which are in
the Covenant, either the faithful or their seed. Thirdly, that they be
administered according to Christ's institution, without the mixture of humane
inventions. More especially unto the receiving of the Lords Supper, there is
required, that we receive it worthily, to which purpose, diverse duties are
required before, in, and after the Communion. Before, that we duly prepare
our selves for this holy action, which consists, first, in an examination of
our selves, how we are qualified with such saving graces as are necessary to
the worthy receiving of the Lords Supper, the which, are an hungring and
thirsting after Christ and his benefits, as after that spiritual food, which
alone is sufficient to nourish us to life everlasting. Secondly, knowledge of
the main principles of Christian Religion, respecting either God or our
selves, without which we cannot discern the Lords body, no more then a blind
man can by his bodily sight discern the outward signs of bread and wine.
Thirdly, faith in Jesus Christ, approved to be true and lively by the fruits
of it, in the inward sanctification of our hearts, and in our outward works of
piety, mercy, and righteousness. Fourthly, unfeigned repentance, consisting in
an hearty sorrow for our sins past, springing out of faith, and the
apprehension of the love of God toward us, and a settled purpose and
resolution, not only to leave them for the time to come, but also to serve the
Lord in the contrary duties of holiness, righteousness, and sobriety.
Fourthly, love and charity toward our neighbors, approved by our
willingness and readiness to give unto those that want, and to forgive those
that offend. Secondly, after this examination there is required unfeigned
humiliation in the sight and sense of our wants and weaknesses, especially in
these saving graces before spoken of. Secondly, an hungring after the means
whereby they may be supplied, especially the Sacrament which was purposely
ordained to supply our wants, and strengthen our weakness in these graces.
Thirdly, humble confession of our sins in general, and especially of those
which have come to our mind in our examination, wherein we renewed our faith
and repentance. Fourthly, a steadfast resolution in our hearts, and faithful
promise to God, that if he will in Christ accept of us, though not prepared
according to the preparation of the Sanctuary, but full of imperfections, and
weak in those graces 2. Chro. 30. 19.
which are necessary unto the worthy receiving of this holy Sacrament, we will
in that part of our lives which remains, strive after more perfection, and
conscionably labor in the use of all good means, whereby we may increase our
knowledge, faith, repentance, and charity toward our neighbors. And lastly,
earnest and hearty prayer unto God for the remission of our sins, for the
assistance of his Spirit in our intended action, for a new supply of
sanctifying graces, and for his blessing upon his holy Ordinances, the Word and
Sacraments, that they may be effectual for the renewing and increasing of them
in us, and for the strengthening of us unto the duties of a godly life. In the
action of receiving, we are to be exercised both by meditation and action. We
are to meditate on the outward signs, Bread and Wine, and the things signified
by them, the precious Body and Blood of Christ; as also of the Analogy and
relation between them. When we see the Bread and Wine set apart from a common,
to an holy use, we are to be put in mind thereby, that so Christ was set apart
and sealed to the office of Mediatourship, that he might be our Ioh 6. 27.
Esa. 49. 1, 5.
Prophet, Priest, and King, and so work that great work of our Redemption.
When we see one Bread and one Wine, consisting of many Grains and Grapes, we
are to be put in mind thereby, that there is but 1. Tim. 2. 5.
one Mediator between Gods us, even the man Jesus Christ, and that he has
but one body, the Catholic Church, consisting of many members. When 1. Cor.
12. 12, 13.
we see the Bread broken, and the Wine powered out, we are to call to mind,
that so the body of Christ was broken and crucified, and his blood shed for our
sins, that it might be spiritual food for our souls, to nourish them to
life everlasting. When we see the Minister give and deliver the Bread and Wine,
we are to remember that so God offers the Body and Blood of his Son, to be
received spiritually by faith of every worthy receiver. The actions to be
performed, are first, to receive the Bread and Wine at the hands of the
Ministers, and to eat and drink them with our bodily mouths. Secondly, to
perform an inward action answerable thereunto, namely, by the hand and mouth
of faith, to receive and feed upon Christ's Body and Blood for our spiritual
nourishment. Thirdly, to remember the infinite love of God and his Christ to
us, the one, in giving his dear Son; the other, his precious Body and Blood
for our Redemption; and being truly thankful unto them in our hearts, for
these inestimable benefits, to set forth their praises, both by our lips and
lives, songs of Thanksgiving, and holy conversation. After the receiving of
the Supper, we are to perform these duties. First, to be perpetually
thankful unto God the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, as for all his
benefits, so especially for that great work of our Redemption, and for
deriuing and assuring unto us the fruit of it by his Word, Sacraments, and holy
Spirit. Secondly, we must examine how we have profited by receiving of the
Supper, for the satisfying of our spiritual hunger, and the replenishing of
our empty souls with the gifts and graces of Gods holy Spirit, which were the
maine ends for which we came to the Lords Table. Lastly, we are to perform
carefully our purposes and promises made unto God and our selves, that we will
conscionably and diligently use all good means, for the furthering of us in
the duties of repentance and a godly life.

CAP. VIII.
Of the duties required in the third and fourth Commandment.

. Sect. 1 Of the sanctifying of Gods Name, which is taken diversely in the
Scriptures, etc. and how it ought to be done.
THe third Commandment requires that we sanctify Gods Name, and glorify
him out of his public and solemn service, in the whole course of our lives
and conversation. The Name of God signifies diverse things in the Scriptures,
as first, God himself and his attributes, which are his Essence. Secondly, his
Glory. Thirdly, his Titles, as Jehovah, Elohim, Iah. Fourthly, his Word.
Fifthly, his Religion. Sixthly, his Works. And to take it in vain, is to use
it in our thoughts, words, and works, rashly, lightly, and without judgment,
or in vain, and to no end, or falsely, wickedly, and contumeliously to his
dishonor, which is here forbidden. Contrariwise in this Commandment, God
requires that we sanctify and glorify his holy Name: and as it is Holy,
Reverend, and Glorious in it self, so to use it holily and reverently, in all
our thoughts, words, and actions. And on the other side he forbids us to use
Gods Name, that is, his attributes, Titles, Word, Religion, and Works vainly,
that is, rashly, irreuerently, and lightly, upon no just cause, or else
profanely, falsely, and contemptuously to Gods dishonor. The main duties
required of us, are first, that we effectually know, believe, and remember God
and his attributes, and also often think and meditate on them, holily and Romans
10. 10.
reverently, that we make profession of God and his attributes, and upon all
occasions speak of them in like manner; and that we walk worthy such an holy
knowledge and profession in our lives and conuersations. Deuteronomy. 28. 58.
Secondly, that we desire Gods glory in our hearts, and endeavor Psalm. 50. 23.
1. Cor. 10. 31.
to set it forth by all means; making it the matter of our speech, and
glorifying him by our praises and thanksgiving, and the end also of all our
words and actions. Thirdly, that we use Gods Titles and Names iudiciously, in
matters of weight and importance, after a serious and reverent manner, and to a
good end. Fourthly, that we use Gods Word religiously and holily, reading,
meditating, and conferring of it with a desire, study, and endeavor to know,
remember, and practice it. That we make it our Schoolmaster, to teach and
instruct us in all truth, our chief 2. Tim. 3. 16.
guide for the directing and reforming of our hearts and lives, and the Luke
11. 28.
squire and rule, according to which we frame all our words and actions.
Fifthly, that we walk worthy our high calling, and by our holiness and Psalm.
119. 1. Act. 23. 1. and 24. 16.
righteousness adorn the Religion which we profess; carrying our selves in
all things uprightly, in respect of God, and inoffensiuely in respect of men.
Sixthly, that in our thoughts, words, and actions, we make an holy and
religious use of all Gods works, both of creation and government, and both
meditate and speak of them so, as it may redound to Gods glory, knowing him by
his works, and glorifying him in them, by Romans 1. 19, 20, 21 Ps. 19. 1. and
139. 14.
acknowledging them his workmanship, and his wisdom, power, and goodness
shining in them. And also to our own good, imitating in them Pro. 6. 6. Matthew.
6. 26. Psalm. 32. 9.
that which the Scriptures propound, as good for our imitation, and avoiding
the contrary. And finally, that we receive them with thanksgiving, 2. Pet. 2.
22. 1. Tim. 4. 5.
and sanctify them to our use by the Word and Prayer. So also here is required
that we make an holy use of the creatures in respect of Gods government and
providence; as first, for the determining of doubts and controversies (which
can no otherwise be cleared and decided) by casting of lots, in the use whereof
we are to use prayer unto God, and sometimes, Pro. 16. 33. Act. 1. 23, 24.
(when the occasion is weighty) fasting, desiring of him, that by his good
providence he will direct them to the right end, for which we use them. And Pro.
18. 18.
as before they are cast, we are to refer our selves wholly to Gods
determination; so after, we are to rest contented and well pleased with his
sentence. Secondly, we are to make an holy use of Gods providence, first, in
conferring rewards and blessings either upon our selves or others. In respect
of our selves we make a right use of Gods blessings and benefits: When as in
our hearts we be unfeignedly thankful unto God for them; Psalm. 144. 6. and
26. 12. and 66. 16
when in our words we praise and magnify his bounty and goodness toward us,
and tell what great things he has done for us, and when in our works and
actions, we refer them wholly to Gods glory, and both Psalm. 130. 4. Romans 2. 4.
our own and others good, taking occasion of his mercy and goodness to fear
him, and to turn unto him from our sins by unfeigned repentance. In respect
of Gods blessings bestowed upon others, we carry our selves holily, when as we
rejoice with them in Gods bounty and goodness, 1. Cor. 12. 26.
and join with them in praises and thanksgiving. The like holy use we are Psalm
35. 17. Gal. 1. 23.
to make of Gods providence in respect of punishments and afflictions, whether
they be inflicted upon our selves, or upon others. As when Job 1. 20, 21.
God lays his hand upon us by his judgments and chastizements, we are to be
humbled in the sight and sense of our sins, and bear them with patience and
thankfulness, acknowledging Gods mercy, in that we are Lam. 3. 22.
not utterly consumed, and profit by them both for the mortifying of our
sins, and for our spiritual quickening unto new obedience. So when Heb. 5. 8.
we see Gods Judgments upon others, we are to take warning by their example,
and communicate with the faithful in their sorrows, bearing Josh. 22. 20. 1
Cor. 10. 6. Romans 12. 1. Psalm. 58* 11.
a part of their grief; and magnifying Gods Justice, which has found out the
wicked to inflict upon them deserved punishments.

. Sect. 2 Of the sanctifying of Gods name in lawful oaths.
More especially, there is required in this Commandment, that we glorify and
sanctify Gods name by our oaths and vows. First, by our oaths, Deuteronomy. 6. 13.
Esa. 45. 23.
unto which is required, first, that we honor Gods name, in swearing by it
upon a just and necessary occasion, acknowledging thereby Gods infinite
wisdom, from which nothing canly hid; his Truth, which abhors all lies and
falsehoods; his Justice, which when he is called to be a witness and Judge,
will neither suffer truth and innocence to go unrewarded, nor untruth and
guiltiness unpunished without respect of persons. Secondly, that we swear
only by the name of God, either directly Esa. 65. 16. Ier. 12 6.
or indirectly, and by no creature in heaven or earth. Thirdly, that we swear
after a lawful manner, unto which is required that we swear in truth, that
is, to that which is true, and truly, according to the persuasion Ier. 4. 2.
Romans 9. 1.
of our minds; In righteousness, binding our selves thereby only unto things
lawful; and in judgment, whereby we discern the necessity of it, in regard
that we can no otherwise clear the truth, nor be believed in a matter of
importance, which much respects Gods glory, or our own or neighbors good.
And so come to the performance of this high and holy action with all reverence
as in Gods presence, duly weighing and considering the conditions and
circumstances of our oath, according to the Scriptures. Lastly, that we swear
unto a right end, namely, to the glory Josh. 7. 19.
of God, by revealing and ratifying a necessary and unknown truth, which could
no otherwise be made manifest; and to the good of our neighbors Heb. 6. 16.
and our selves, that they may be satisfied, all controversies and strifes
ended, all doubts and suspicions removed, and our own truth and Exodus 22. 11.
innocence declared and cleared.

. Sect. 3 Of the sanctifying Gods name by making and performing our vows.
The second special thing here required, is lawful vows, whereby we
cheerfully promise unto God some thing which may be acceptable unto him,
either because we have already found him gracious and good unto us, which
moves us to do this duty out of love and thankfulness, or because we expect
his mercy and goodness for some benefit to be received, or punishment to be
avoided or removed; out of our faith and hope grounded upon Gods promises. Unto
which vows, that they may be lawful and acceptable unto God, there are two
things required, namely, that we make them lawfully, and truly to perform
them. Unto the making of a lawful vow is required, First, that it be
performed as a religious Psalm. 76. 11.
act to God and none other. Secondly, that it be done after a religious and
holy manner. 1. In truth, with a sincere and cheerful heart. 2. In 2. Chro.
15. 15.
righteousness, unto which is required, in respect of the person, that he
have power in himself to vow that thing, or have the consent of his
governors. Secondly, that the thing vowed, be lawful and acceptable unto God,
as being good and commanded, or of an indifferent nature, but in respect of us,
good and profitable, and therefore to be used, or hurtful and inconvenient and
therefore to be avoided. Thirdly, that we vow in judgment, whereby we
discern that our vow is in the former respects lawful, and very profitable
either for the advancing of Gods glory or our own good. The last thing
required, is, that we make it to a right end, as Psalm. 66. 13.
namely, to the glory of God, the good of our neighbors, and our own benefit;
for the exercising of our temperance and sobriety, or the renewing and 61. 8.
and furthering of our repentance, or for the strengthening of our Number. 30. 14.
1. Sam. 1. 11.
faith, and our good purposes and resolutions about the performance of good
duties. In respect of performance of our vows, there is required, Eccles. 5.
3. Number. 30 3.
that it be done at the time appointed, and without delay, and also without any
diminution or abatement in quantity or quality, of that which we have vowed.
Especially our care must be of performing our common vow in baptism, in
renouncing all our spiritual enemies, and in consecrating our selves wholly
unto Gods service, in performing unto him the duties of holiness,
righteousness, and sobriety all the days of our lives.

. Sect. 4 Of the sanctifying Gods Sabbath, and what things are required unto it.
In the fourth Commandment, the Lord appoints a special time, wherein all
the former duties both public and private, are principally to be performed,
which whosoever do neglect, they manifestly show that they are destitute of
the power of all true Religion. The maine duty required, is, that we remember
to sanctify the Sabbath: In which two things are to be considered: 1. that we
must sanctify the Sabbath: 2. that we must remember to do it, that is, be
mindful and careful to sanctify it. To the sanctification of the Sabbath two
things are required: First, the rest. Secondly, the sanctifying of it. The rest
consists partly in an outward rest from bodily labors and worldly affairs,
and in our inward resting from the servile works of sin. The works from
which we must rest, are bodily labors, and all worldly imploiments, so far
forth as they are distractions and hindrances to the spiritual Sanctification
of the Sabbath; As buying and selling, all manner of works of our ordinary
callings, travailing, feasting of friends with meats not easily cooked, and
such like. For all kinds of bodily labors on the Lords day are unlawful,
Math. 12. 5.
except they be referred to the sanctification of the Sabbath, as the means of
it, of which sort are the labors of the Minister in the duties appertaining to
his ministry; and of the people travailing to the places of Gods worship. Or
secondly, the works of mercy, which are duties of the Sabbath, Hos. 6. 6.
as giving of alms, visiting the sick and prisoners, healing diseases and
sores, by applying fit medicines and salues. Or lastly, works of necessity,
which are of importance, and cannot, without great inconvenience, be done
afterward, nor could have been done before. For as for that necessity, which
arises from our negligence and careless oversight, it is sinful, and in the
first word of this Commandment forbidden and condemned. And among these works
of necessity, we are to reckon labor in providing convenient food for our
bodies, tending of cattle, when it is done rather in mercy, which respects
their necessity, then for our own gain: Labors of Mariners begun before the
Sabbath in their Navigations at Sea: Fight in a lawful war against our
enemies; labors of servants and subjects imposed upon them by their governors
as necessary, and not apparently discerned by them to be otherwise. The inward
and spiritual rest, is our resting from sin, as at all times, so especially
Esa. 56. 2 and 58. 13.
on the Sabbath. For these works of darkness, are above all other most
servile and slavish, seeing thereby we make our selves the vassals of Satan.

. Sect. 5 Of the spiritual sanctification, and the outward rest.
And this is the rest required on the Sabbath; the sanctification of this rest
is either by using the means, or doing the works of sanctification. And this
is done both publicly and privately; publicly, by using the public means of
sanctification in the service of God. And this is done, First, of the
Ministers, by public praying in the congregation, preaching and reading the
Word, and administration of the Sacraments. Secondly, the people, by
frequenting the assemblies in the beginning, and continuing to the end of
divine service; and being there, by carrying and behauing themselves
religiously, diligently and uprightly, in calling upon Gods name, hearing the
Word, and in the right use of the Sacraments. The Leuit. 19. 30. and 23. 2. 1.
Cor. 16. 2.
public works of sanctification, are almesdeeds and collections for the
poor. Privately the Sabbath is sanctified, by our preparation to Gods public
service, which chiefly consists in meditation and prayer; and after the
public service, by meditating on the Word heard, and applying it to our own
use, and by holy conferences with others. Unto which duties, respecting the
public worship, we are to add and use these other means of sanctifying the
remainder of the Lords day; Reading of the Scriptures or other religious and
holy writings; meditation on Gods Word Psalm. 92. 1.
and works, especially of creation, preservation and redemption; Invocation by
prayer; thanksgiving and singing of Psalms: and finally, godly conferences
upon some fit subject, which best forteth to the present occasion, and tends
to the use of edification: unto which means we must add the private works of
sanctification, which are the works of mercy, and appertain chiefly either to
the body, as the giving of alms, visiting the sick and prisoners, curing
diseases, etc. or else to the soul, as, teaching the ignorant, reclaiming
those who are seduced by error, admonishing those who fail of their duty by
frailty and infirmity, rebuking the scandalous and wilful offender, exhorting
the backward and sluggish, comforting the distressed, counsailing them for the
good of their souls that need counsel, and reconciling those whom we know
to be at variance. But we must not only sanctify the Sabbath, but also as a
special help and means hereof, we must remember to do it, that is, use all
providence and care, devotion and diligence about these duties of
sanctification. Before the Sabbath we must so forecast our business, and
dispose of all our worldly affairs, that we be not distracted in performing
of holy duties, by having our minds, tongues or actions exercized and taken up
by them. And on the Sabbath we must remember to sanctify it, by having our
whole man taken up in the service of God, both publicly and privately, and by
performing the duties required with all diligence and attention, sincerity and
uprightness, Esa. 58. 13.
cheerfulness and delight.

CAP. IX.
Of the sum of the second Table.

. Sect. 1 Of the duties of righteousness toward our neighbors.
WE have spoken of the duties of piety contained in the first Table. And now
we are to entreat of the duties of righteousness, and sobriety required in
the second: under righteousness, comprehending all duties which we owe to our
neighbors; and under sobriety, all those which belong to our own persons. By
righteousness, we understand a virtue or habit which orders the whole man to
the good of our neighbors; as the mind and understanding, to think; the
memory, to remember; the will, to desire; the affections and passions, to covet
and affect; the whole body, to act and perform all things which we know good
and profitable both for their souls, bodies, name and state, for their
temporal welfare and prosperity in this world, and their everlasting happiness
in the world to come. The general rule of which righteousness is, that we do
all that, and that only unto others, Math. 5. 12.
which we would have others do unto us; and consequently, seeing we desire that
our neighbors should with all the powers of their mind and body advance, as
much as in them lies, our good in all things respecting our souls, bodies and
states; Justice and righteousness requires the same at our hands toward them;
namely, that to the uttermost of our power we be ever ready to do all things
which tend to their good, and to the preservation of their honor, person,
life, purity, chastity, wealth and good name, not so much as intertaining a
thought, or first motion in our minds or hearts, which in any of these or other
respects may tend to their hurt and prejudice. Of which Justice or
righteousness there are two parts; the one distributive, whereby we do give
unto every one their due, and that which of right appertains unto them; in
which is to be observed a geometrical proportion, which has respect in this
distribution unto every man according to their place, person and such other
relations and circumstances, and is in all things carried with due regard of
equity and moderation. The other is commutatiue, which is usually exercized in
commerce and mutual dealings and trading one with another, as in changing,
borrowing, lending, buying, selling, letting, setting, and such like affairs
of this life; The general rule whereof is, that we keep from no man his
right, but pay every man his debt and due. In which is to be observed an
Arithmeticall proportion, performing all these duties of Justice in a strict
equality, without any respect of place or person.

. Sect. 2 Of the duty of sobriety toward our selves.
The other maine duty is sobriety, which comprehends under it all duties
which respect our own persons; the which in a general sense, as (...). Mark
5. 15. Luke 8. 35. Acts 26. 25. Tit. 1. 8. and 2. 12
it is to be here understood, signifies soundness of mind, which orders
all things to the good and safety of our persons and state. And thus the word,
which is translated sobriety, is taken in the Scriptures for a sound mind; so
it is said, that the demoniacke was by our Savior Christ restored to his right
mind. And the Apostle says, that he was not mad, but spoke forth the words of
truth and soberness, that is, of a right and sound mind, which tended to the
safety and salvation of himself and others; and exhorts all men to be wise
unto sobriety, or to think soberly, not straining Romans 12. 3.
their wits above the measure of their gifts, which is the next way to crack
and lose them. And thus elsewhere he opposes these two, the one against 2.
Cor. 5. 13.
the other, to be sober, and to be besides our selves. Sobriety therefore is a
virtue or habit proceeding from a sound mind, spiritual wisdom and
judgment, whereby we are enabled to rule and order our selves, with all our
powers and faculties of mind and body, and all things else about which they
are exercised to our good, safety and salvation. First, it rules and orders
the mind to the using of all good means, whereby it may be more and more
enlightened with saving knowledge; the memory, as a faithful register to
retain good things; the conscience, to perform its office rightly in excusing
and accusing; the will, to choose the good, and refuse the evil, and in all
things to be conformable to the holy will of God; the affections, to covet
after spiritual and heavenly things with unlimited desires, and temporal good
things with moderation, temperance and purity; and the body in all holiness
and honor, that it may be a fit temple for the holy Ghost, and a ready
instrument unto the soul for all good actions. And thus it rules the whole
man and every faculty and part of him, as they are exercised about their
several and particular objects, causing the mind to approve or condemn; the
memory to retain or cast out; the conscience to accuse or excuse, the will to
choose or reject; the affections, to love and desire, or to hate and contemn;
the body, to do, or leave undone all things good or evil, when they are
propounded unto them. And in respect of these several sorts of objects, this
virtue of sobriety has place, and is commanded in every precept of the second
Table. For as it rules and orders us about the preservation of our honor
and authority, it is required in the first Commandment; as about the good,
preservation and salvation of our lives, our souls and bodies, in the sixth;
as about our chastity, purity, temperance, and sobriety in the use of meats,
drinks, and apparel, in the seventh; as about our goods and possessions,
either in getting or using them righteously and justly, in the eighth; as about
the preserving of our good name, in the ninth; as about withstanding the first
motions and suggestions unto sin, and the recovering of original
righteousness, and holy concupiscence in our minds and hearts, in the tenth
and last.

. Sect. 3 Of the duties of charity.
But seeing our Savior has comprised both these duties of righteousness and
sobriety under charity, and has made love the whole sum of Matthew. 22. 39.
and 19. 19. Gal. 5. 14.
the Law, our love toward God, of the first Table, and our love toward our
selves and our neighbors, of the second Table: I will consider of them both
under this one, first generally, and afterward more specially in every several
Commandment. For charity and true love toward our selves, moves us out of a
sound and right mind, to perform, in thought, word, and deed, all good duties
which tend to our safety and salvation; and charity toward our neighbors, as
it moves us to love them as our selves, so to perform all duties of
righteousness and mercy, which we do unto our selves, or would have others
do unto us. Now this charity is a gift or grace of God, infused into our
hearts by his holy Spirit, which out of the sense of Gods love toward us in
Christ, working true and fervent love toward them again, does move us to
love our selves, and all men as our selves, and as Christ has loved us for
Gods sake, and in obedience to his Commandment. It is a gift of God, and no
natural habit; for naturally, as we are haters of God and men, so even of our
selves, neither is any hatred of an enemy so hurtful and pernicious unto our
souls and bodies, as carnal self-love, which is a chief cause and means of
depriving us here of all grace, and of glory and happiness in the life to
come. And therefore the Apostle exhorting us to love one another, tells us
where we must have this gift; Let us (says he) love one another, 1. Ioh. 4. 7.
for love is of God. Neither is it a common gift of God, but a sanctifying and
saving grace of his holy Spirit: for as the love of God toward us, as the
cause, so our love toward God, as the effect of it, is shed abroad Romans 5. 5.
in our hearts by the holy Ghost, as the Apostle testifies.

. Sect. 4 Of the means and manner of working charity in us.
The means and manner of working this grace in us, is, first by persuading us
that God in Christ loves us, and will give unto us the remission of our
sins, his grace here, and glory hereafter: with the lively heat of which
love, our hearts are inflamed with fervent love toward God again, from which
springs an holy affection toward our selves, who are thus beloved of God,
members of Christ, and Temples of the holy Ghost, whereby we seek the fruition
of our chief goodness, and consequently of our own salvation and eternal
happiness, which whilst we were destitute of the love of God, and were
poisoned with hatred of God and carnal self-love, we neglected and contemned.
And from hence also arises the like affection toward our neighbors, whom
we love for Gods sake, not only as Gods creatures, and bearing his image,
but also in obedience unto his Commandment. So that it is impossible to love
either our selves or our neighbors as we ought, and for our own and their
good, unless we love God in Christ Jesus first and chiefly, from whose
sincere love the other springs and flows. But when we sincerely love God,
and so yield our obedience unto the first Table, our love toward our selves
and our neighbors, which is the sum of the second Table, will necessarily
and inseparably follovv. For as our love toward God is exercized immediately
in religious virtues and holy duties of piety which we perform in his
service, so mediately by performing (in obedience to his Commandments) the
duties of a true and Christian love toward our selves and our neighbors. For
when our little goodness, bounded in narrow limits, will not reach unto God
for the manifestation of our love toward him, we extend it as far as we
are able, and do what good we can, our of a holy and sanctified affection to
our selves and our neighbors, to show our love toward God, in yielding
obedience unto his Commandments. As we see in the example of David, who being
ravished with the apprehension of Gods love, and desiring to show his love
toward him again, could no otherwise do it, then by taking Psalm. 116. 13.
the cup of salvation, and praising the name of the Lord, and by causing his
goodness to extend to Gods poor Saints that are in the earth, and to the
excellent, Psalm. 16. 2, 3.
which, in respect of its smalnesse, and Gods all sufficiency, could in no sort
reach unto him. Where, by the way we may note, that if we love Act. 17. 25.
our selves and our neighbors out of our love toward God, and in obedience
unto his Commandments, performing these duties of the second Table, in and for
him; then do we, when we do most good to our neighbors and our selves,
show most love toward God, and perform unto him such acceptable service as he
requires of us, and will richly reward in this life and the life to come. For
he has sworn, that all those Luke 1. 74, 75.
whom he has redeemed, shall serve him as well in righteousness as in
holiness all the days of their lives. And his grace appearing, has taught us
to deny not only all ungodliness, but also all worldly lusts, and to live as
Tit. 2. 12.
well soberly and righteously, as godly and religiously, in this present world.

. Sect. 5 What charity is, and the properties of it.
But let us come to speak of this duty of charity, as in our Savior Christ's
words it is propounded unto us out of the Law of God; Thou shall Mat. 19. 19.
and 22. 39. Leuit. 19. 18.
love thy neighbor as thy self. Wherein we are to consider two things: the
duty commanded, and the manner of doing it; In the duty, we are to consider
the act of loving, and the object of our love, which is our neighbors and our
selves, the first plainly expressed, the other necessarily employed in the
manner, when as we are commanded to love them as we love our selves. The duty
of love contains in it, First, an affection or motion of the heart, wherewith
we are affected and inclined toward that we love. Secondly, an earnest and
longing desire that we may enjoy it, by being (as it were) united unto it.
Thirdly, joy and delight in the fruition of it, and a contentation, whereby we
rest according to the measure of our love and fruition, satisfied with it. The
properties of it are principally two; the first, that it be sincere and
unfeigned. So the Apostle requires that our love be without dissimulation, and
unfeigned; and the Apostle John disswadeth Romans 12. 9.
us from lip-loue, which is only in profession, but fruitless and 2 Cor. 6.
6. 1. Ioh. 3. 18.
ineffectual in action: Little children (says he) let us not love in word,
neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. The other, that it be fervent and
effectual, according to that of the Apostle, Above all things, have fervent
charity among your selves. And this is that sincere and fervent love, which is
so much and often commended and commanded in the Scriptures. So our Savior
Christ; This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have Ioh. 15.
12.
loved you. And again, A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love Ioh
13. 34. 1. Ioh. 3. 23.
one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. The Apostle
likewise, Walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself
Ephesians. 5. 2.
for us, etc.

. Sect. 6 Of the object of charity, which is our neighbors.
The object of this love plainly expressed, is our neighbors, whereby we are
not with the Pharisees to understand our friends only, nor, according Mat. 5.
43.
to the vulgar use of the word, those that dwell near unto us alone, but all
men, without exception, who are of the same nature with us, consisting of a
reasonable soul and body, whether they be strangers or acquaintance, friends
or enemies unto us. For all men are of the same flesh, Act. 17. 26.
and created according to the same Image of God, and also our brethren, as they
have all alike descended from the same first parents. And this is employed in
the Law, where that Commandment, which is given for the helping of our enemies
Ox or Ass, being repeated in another place, is Ex. 23. 4, 5. com. Deuteronomy. 22.
1, 2, 3. Esa. 58.
rendered thy brothers Ox or Ass. And the Prophet Esaias makes it a work of
mercy to cover the naked, without any exception of stranger or enemy, because
he is of our own flesh. But our Savior plainly presses this duty both by
precept; But I say unto you, love your enemies, Mat. 5. 44.
bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them
that despitefully use you and persecute you; propounding the example of God
himself for our imitation, that you may be the children of your Father which
is in heaven, for he makes his Sun to rise on the evil and the good, and
sends rain on the just and on the unjust. And also by his Parable of the man
which fell among thieves, who being a Jew, Luke 10. 29. 30.
was relieved by a Samaritane, though an enemy to that nation, and therefore
approved as a neighbor unto him. All men therefore being our neighbors, they
are all, in respect of their persons, to be loved of us, with such love, in
respect of the quality, as is sincere, unfeigned, and fervent, even as we love
our selves; although in respect of the quantity, we may and ought in our love
to observe diverse degrees. For seeing we love others, in, and for God,
therefore we must love those above others which are of the household of faith,
and our kindred in the Spirit, brethren of the same heavenly Father, and fellow
members of the same body, in whom the Image of God most brightly shines; so
the whole Church and Commonwealth, more then a private man, and among private
men, our parents, children, kindred, Gal. 6. 10. 1. Tim. 5. 8.
familiar friends, and benefactours, more then strangers or ordinary men.

. Sect. 7 The means of loving our neighbors, namely, as our selves.
The manner of our love toward our neighbors is, that we love them as our
selves. In which, the love of our own persons is necessarily implied; Leuit.
19. 18. Mat. 22. 39.
for if the love of our selves be the rule of our love toward our neighbors,
then must our charity begin at home, and from it, as from the fountain, the
streams of brotherly love must spring and flow. And howsoever we have in the
Scriptures no direct precept, inioyning us to love our selves, yet it is
necessarily implied. First, when we are commanded to love God; for seeing love
unites us unto him, who is the chief Good and fountain of all happiness, we
chiefly love our selves in loving him, in whose fruition consists all
blessedness and felicity. Secondly, in all those Commandments which require
of us that we seek our own good and preservation, both in respect of our
souls, bodies, and states, temporal and eternal, both by avoiding all sin
which would hurt us, as selfe-murther, uncleanness, prodigality, exposing of
our fame and good name to slanders and imputations, and by embracing all
virtues, and practicing all good duties which may further our everlasting
salvation. Besides, where our Savior says, that whosoever loves his own
life better then him, Ephesians* 5. 28, 29.
is not worthy of him, he implies that we ought to love our selves, but with
such a love as is subordinate to the love of him, who has loved us better then
his own life. And the Apostle, in pressing a man's love toward his wife, which
ought to exceed all other natural love, because of that near union between
them whereby they become one flesh, uses this as a reason, that no man ever
hated his own flesh; implying thereby, that seeing man and wife are both one,
therefore we should love our wives as our selves, and consequently our selves
first, according to which rule we are to love them.

. Sect. 8 That natural and carnal self love is not the rule of loving our
neighbors, but that which is holy and spiritual.
But seeing our natural love of our selves is carnal and earthly, plunging us
headlong into sin and death, and is no better then true hatred, in respect
of those miserable effects and fruits which it produces both to our souls and
bodies; therefore this carnal love ought not to be our rule in loving our
neighbors, (although in truth we can love them with no other, whilst this
love rules and swayeth in us) but first this love must be mortified in us; and
in stead thereof our hearts must be replenished with a just and holy love,
whereby we love our selves in and for God, for the advancing of our temporal
and spiritual good, and the eternal salvation of our souls and bodies, in
the fruition of him whom we chiefly love, and with him, of everlasting joy and
happiness. And when we thus truly love our selves, according to this rule we
must love our brethren. So that when we are commanded to love our neighbors as
our selves, Leuit. 19. 17.
it is not required that we should so love them, as we love our selves in the
state of corruption, with a carnal and earthly love, which would draw them
together with us into eternal death and destruction, and is therefore to be
esteemed no better then hatred; but as we ought to love our selves in the
state of regeneration, with a right, lawful, and holy love, which is always
subordinate to the love of God, and loving him first and chiefly, does cause us
to love them, in and for him, and not in such respects as are carnal and
sinful. In which regard, as we are bound to love all men, even our enemies;
yea the most wicked in the world, in respect of their persons, which are Gods
workmanship: so, not our dearest friends, in respect of their vices, or their
vices together with them; seeing our love must be subordinate to the love of
God, and for his sake: and as we love their persons which he also loves, so
must we hate their sins and corruptions, even as we ought also to hate our
own, because he hates and abhors them. And we must love our selves and
them according to Gods will, and not contrary unto it; so far forth as it
may stand with Gods love, and not when there is any opposition between them.
And thus David, who mourned for his enemies, because they Ps. 119. 136, 137
Psalm. 119. 113. Psalm. 139. 21, 22.
kept not Gods Law, and prayed for them, in respect of their persons, yet hated
them, in respect of their sins, which were hateful to God, as he often
professes.

. Sect. 9 The properties of lawful self-love.
Now the lavvfull and right love of our selves has diverse properties; for
first it is unfeigned, and not counterfeit and dissembled; and seated and
settled in the heart, and not in the tongue and lips only. Secondly, it is
fervent and effectual, and not cold, remiss, and careless. Thirdly, constant
and permanent; and not fickle and mutable, alienated and estranged by frailties
and infirmities. And such ought our love to be toward our neighbors, sincere
and unfeigned, fervent and effectual, seeking by all means their good, not
only in word, but in deed and action, doing Mat. 7. 12.
that unto them, which we would have them do unto us: and finally, we must love
them with a constant love, and not alienate our affections from them, in regard
of their frailties and imperfections. And thus we are to love our neighbors,
either with a common and natural love sanctified by Gods Spirit, or with a
special and spiritual love. In respect of the former; as every man out of a
natural love does seek his own good, the preservation of his life, the
welfare and health of his body, the chastity of himself and his wife, the
prosperity of his estate, and his own credit and good name; so ought we with
like love to seek by all means the good and preservation of our neighbors,
in every of these, and all other respects. The special and spiritual love,
whereby a man loves himself, causes him chiefly to seek the enriching of
his soul with all sanctifying grace, and to further by all means his
everlasting salvation; and with such love also we must love our neighbors;
doing them all the good we can, both in respect of their bodies and states,
but principally in seeking their spiritual good, and the eternal salvation of
their bodies and souls.

. Sect. 10 That we must love our neighbors, as Christ has loved us.
But because our love of our selves, by reason of our natural corruption, is,
whilst we continue in this life, weak and imperfect, and therefore no fit rule
for our love toward our neighbors, to be squared by; therefore our Savior
has propounded unto us, a much more perfect pattern for our imitation, even
that most admirable and divine love wherewith he has loved us: This is my
Commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved Ioh. 15. 12.
you. As therefore Christ has loved us first, before we loved him, or any
ways deserved his love, and hereby moved us to love him again; so 1. Ioh. 4.
19.
ought we to prevent one another with our love, and thereby provoke them to
return unto us the like duty. Secondly, as Christ loved all his Romans 5. 8.
elect, freely without any respect of merit, yea when we were strangers,
sinners and enemies, not because of any goodness in us, but that by his Love
he might bring us to good; so ought our love to be free, and not mercinary, so
far forth as it may redound to our own profit; but we must love strangers,
that thereby we may make them our familiar acquaintance; Our enemies, that we
may make them our friends, and even those that are now evil and sinners, that
we may bring them to grace and goodness. Thirdly, as Christ loved all the
elect, without respect of persons, both old and young, rich and poor, base and
noble, wise and simple; so ought we to love all sorts and conditions of men, in
whom we find already, or may hope to find hereafter, the signs and marks
of Gods election. Fourthly, as Christ loved us perfectly, in respect of the
manner, with a sincere and ardent love, and not in tongue and profession only,
but in deed and truth; so as no waters of affliction, nor death it self could
Cant. 8 6.
drown or dampe; so ought we strive to love one another, and to be ready
according to his example, when just occasion is offered, to seal and approve
1. John. 3. 16.
our love toward them, even with the shedding of our blood. Fifthly, as Christ
loved us, who were in him elected of his Father, in a special and peculiar
manner above all others, and out of this love has given himself for us;
according to that of the Apostle, Who has loved me, Gal. 2. 20.
and given himself for me: so ought we to love all with a general and common
love, but Gods elect with a peculiar and special love above the rest, and be
ready, as the Apostle speaks, to do good unto all, but especially Gal. 6. 10.
unto those who are of the household of faith. Lastly, as Christ loves us with
a constant love, and to the end, and will not reject us for our frailties and
infirmities, because in his love he respects not his own profit, but our
salvation: So ought our love to be constant toward our neighbors, and not to
languish and faint upon slight occasions, respecting herein not our own
profit, but their benefit, and above all, the everlasting salvation of their
bodies and souls.

CAP. X.
Of the reasons which may move us to embrace charity.

. Sect. 1 Of the excellency of charity.
ANd thus have I showed what is that charity both toward our selves and our
neighbors, which is required in the second Table: In the next place I will set
down some reasons which may move us to embrace it, all which will reduce unto
these their heads, the excellency, vtility, and necessity of it. The excellency
of this charity herein appears, in that our Savior Christ makes it the
sum of all other duties and virtues required in the second Mat. 22. 39.
Table; so that if we have charity, we have all moral virtues; if that be
wanting, we are destitute of them all. Yea, the Apostles, not without the
direction of his holy Spirit, do seem to go further, making this charity the
epitome and sum of the whole Law; He that loves another (says Romans 13. 8.
Paul) has fulfilled the Law. If ye fulfill the royal Law (says James)
according to the Scripture, thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, ye do
well. Where either by a Synecdoche of the whole for the part, we are, as some
do, to understand the second Table only, or because true obedience to it,
does necessarily infer our obedience to the first, in that it is an
inseparable fruit and undoubted sign of it, it may not unfitly comprehend our
total obedience to the whole Law. Secondly, in that the Apostle prefers 1.
Cor. 12. 31. and 13. 13.
it before those chief and fundamental virtues, Faith and Hope, and that
both, because if we consider them merely in themselves, it is of a more
excellent nature, and also in respect of the extent, both of latitude and time;
for whereas they respect our selves only and our own salvation, this extends
to the good and salvation of many others: and whereas they continue only for
this life, charity attaineth to its greatest perfection in the life to come,
and shall ever remain as a principal part of our everlasting joys. And thus
also the Apostle Peter commends charity unto us above all other duties; Above
all things (says he) have fervent 1. Pet. 4. 8.
charity among your selves, for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
Finally, the Apostle shows the excellency of charity, whereas he exhorts
us above all things to put on Charity, as being the bond of perfectness, or
the most perfect bond, seeing we are thereby united unto Christ our Col. 3. 14.
Head, and as fellow members one with another. For howsoever we are thus united
first and principally by the Spirit of God and a lively faith, yet this bond of
union is perfected and made more firm and strong, by this grace of charity,
which transforming and changing us into the very nature of the things beloved,
does cause us to become one with them, and so inseparably united, that nothing
in the world, no not death Cant. 8. 6.
it self, is of sufficient force to pull us asunder.

. Sect. 2 Of the profit of charity, in respect of our neighbors.
Secondly, charity is to be embraced of us as the most profitable virtue, both
to others and our selves. To others, because it makes us willing and 1. Cor.
13. 4.
ready to perform all Christian duties of holiness and righteousness, which
we desire of others to be done unto us; for it suffers with all patience and
long-suffering all wrongs and injuries, and seeks to gain them who are thus
injurious, by all duties of love. It is so kind, that being provoked, it
seeks not revenge, but labors to overcome evil with goodness. It enuieth
not the prosperity of those that are above us, but causes us to rejoice with
them in all their happiness. It is not puffed up with pride, nor vaunteth it
self above those who are inferior unto us, either in virtues, or in those
rewards, with which God in this life crowns them. It does not behave it self
unseemly, but observes a just decorum, and a Verse 5.
modest and sober course in all conditions. It seeks not her own, but
jointly aduanceth our neighbors good, in many things departing from her own
right, when greater benefit may redound to others; it is not easily provoked to
unjust anger, but bears with many faults for their better reformation, in
consideration of humane frailty and infirmity. It thinks no evil, nor
intends hurt unto any, neither is it suspicious to take any thing in the
worst part, which may admit of a more favorable interpretation. It rejoices
not in iniquity, nor sporteth it self in other men's falls and infirmities,
Verse 6.
but rather in the sense of humane frailty; it lamenteth their sins, and
desires their repentance and reformation, that they may be saved. And
contrariwise it rejoices, when as they approve their profession of truth in
their practice of righteousness. It bears all things with meekness Verse
7, 8.
and patience, and reuengeth not injuries, but leaves vengeance to God, unto
whom it belongs. It believes all things credible, and easily admits all
just apologies and excuses, which tend to the manifesting of innocence in
others, or at least, less faultiness. It hops all things, and when there is
no appearance of good in our righteousness, expects their reformation and
amendment, and despaireth not of their future repentance. Finally, it indureth
all things, and covers a multitude of evils, and is not wearied in
well-doing, but continues constant in doing and suffering all things which may
any ways tend to the good of our neighbors.

. Sect. 3 Of the profit of charity in respect of our selves.
And as it is profitable to all others; so most of all unto our selves. For it
replenisheth our hearts with all sound joy and true comfort, as it is an
infallible sign of all good in us, and belonging unto us, of all grace in this
life, and glory and happiness in the life to come. For hereby we are assured
that God loves us, and has sent his holy Spirit to dwell in us: If we love
one another (says the Apostle) God dwells in us, and his love 1. Ioh. 4. 12,
13. Gal. 5. 22. 1. John 4. 7.
is perfect in us. Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because
he has given us of his Spirit. It is an undoubted sign, which assures us of
our regeneration and new birth. Let us love one another: for love is of God:
and every one that loves, is borne of God. Of our illumination by the Spirit,
and of saving knowledge: for every one that loves, is borne of God, and
knows God, as it follows in the same place. And again; He that 1. John 2.
10.
loves his brother, abides in the light, and there is no occasion of
stumbling in him. It assures us of faith; for faith works by love, as the
Apostle Gal. 5. 6.
speaks; and that by it we are truly justified before God: for if we be so
charitable, as to forgive men their trespasses, then has the Lord promised
Mat. 6. 14.
that he will forgive us our trespasses. So also it is an infallible note of
our adoption; for in this the children of God are manifest, and the children of
the 1. John 3. 10.
devil: whosoever does not righteousness, is not of God, neither he that
loves not his brother; and assures us that we are the true Disciples of Jesus
Christ, if in this we follow his example, and do his will. For this is his
Commandment, John 15. 12.
that we love oue another, as he has loved us. And by this shall all men John
13. 35.
know that we are his Disciples, if we have love one to another. It is an
undoubted sign of all other graces dwelling in us, and principally of our love
of God; for every one who loves him that begat, loves him also that is
begotten 1. John 5. 1. 1. John 4. 20.
of him. And if any man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar:
for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God
whom he has not seen? And of the truth of our Religion; for if we love 1.
John 3. 18, 19. Iam. 1. 27.
not only in word and tongue, but in deed and truth, we may hereby know that
we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before God. It expels all
servile fear, and brings peace of conscience; for there is no fear in love,
but perfect love casts out fear. Yea it is a notable means also of outward
1. John 4. 18. (...). Gregor. Nazian. Pro. 10. 12. 1. Pet. 4 8. 1. John 3. 14.
and 4. 17.
peace with men, whilst it bears with infirmities, passes by offenses, and
covers a multitude of sins. Finally, it assures us of everlasting
happiness: for we know that we have passed from death to life, because we love
the brethren.

. Sect. 4 Of the necessity of charity.
Lastly, the necessity of charity may move us to embrace it. For without
charity humane society cannot subsist and stand, seeing it is the maine bond
whereby they are combined and knit together. Neither is it alone a chief
motive to make men entertain mutual fellowship and intercourse one with
another, but also a principal means to make them to continue with delight and
comfort in this society. For charity covers a Pro. 10. 12.
multitude of sins, and causes us to pass by many frailties and
infirmities, and either not to see and take notice of them, or by extenuating
and excusing them, to make them pardonable and easy to be disgested. Whereas
if charity be wanting, there will easily creep in iealousies, suspicions,
sinister interpretations, injuries both offered and revenged, deadly hatred,
and implacable contentions; for as the Wiseman says, Hatred stirs up
strifes, from whence must needs follow divisions, and Pro. 10. 12.
utter breaking up of all society. For if two cannot walk together, unless
they Amos 3. 3.
be agreed, (as the Prophet speaks) with what bond can innumerable multitudes
be knit together, if charity be wanting, and in stead thereof, heart-burnings
and contentions be admitted? And as without charity there can be no communion
between man and man, so neither between man and God, which principally
consists in fruition, and fruition in love; seeing we cannot love God,
unless we also love one another, as the Apostle tells us. We cannot without
it have any assurance that 1. Ioh. 4. 20.
we belong to God, or that we are his children by adoption and grace; yea
rather we may conclude that we are the children of the devil, seeing the
Apostle John makes the having or not having of charity, a prime mark 1. Ioh.
3. 10.
of difference, whereby they may be discerned the one from the other. Again,
all our other graces and gifts, though they make never so glorious a show, yet
if charity be wanting, are all of no value. If we could speak 1. Cor. 13. 1,
2, 3.
with the tongues of men and Angels, and have not charity, we should become as
sounding brass, or a tinkling Cymball. If we had the gift of Prophecy, and
understood all mysteries and all knowledge; yea if we had all faith (namely, of
working miracles) and could remove mountains, and had not charity, we were
nothing. And though we could bestow all our goods to feed the poor, and could
give our bodies to be burned, and had not charity, it would profit us nothing.
Furthermore, where there is not charity, there faith also is wanting, or in
stead of it, a dead faith, which has no operation, for faith works by Gal.
5. 6.
love; and if we have a living faith, the Apostle James tells us, that we
Iam. 2. 18.
may show it by our works: among which, the works of mercy and charity have a
chief place: Whereas if these be wanting, our faith is (as he compares it)
like a body without breath, and no better then a stinking carcass Verse the
last.
in Gods estimate. Finally, charity is most necessary, if ever we mean to
attain to eternal salvation, or to escape hellish destruction; seeing the
sentence of life or death shall at the day of Judgment be pronounced, Mat. 25.
34, 41.
according to the works of charity, either performed or neglected by us, as
being the chief outward evidences, whereby our inward grace of faith,
apprehending Christ unto salvation, may, to the justifying of Gods righteous
Judgments, be unto all demonstrated and declared.

CAP. XI.
Containing in it the duties which are required in the fifth Commandment.

. Sect. 1 Of the general duties required in the fifth Commandment.
WE have more largely entreated of charity, righteousness, and sobriety, as
those general virtues and duties, which comprize in them the whole sum of
the second Table, because we would more briefly touch the particular duties
which under them are contained, referring the Reader unto such Catechismes and
Common places of divinity as handle them more fully and perfectly, especially
to those exact Tables upon the Commandments, lately published by the right
reverend, and my most honored and dear brother, from whose full and living
fountain, I have in a great part derived these streams: Not that I take any
pleasure in doing that again, which was much better done before, but because
this Treatise of a godly life should have been maimed, if I had not in some
manner handled the maine parts and principal duties required unto it; and I
could add no more unto that exact abstract in so short a discourse, then light
unto the Sun, by setting up a dim shining candle; nor alter the method and
manner of it, unless I could have been content for varieties sake to have
made it worse, and to go out of the right way, because I would not travail in
the beaten path. The duties and virtues then required, and the vices and sins
forbidden in the second Table, are either peculiar to superiors and inferiors
in the fifth Commandment, or common to all in the five other. The duties and
virtues required in the fifth Commandment, are, either common to all
superiors and inferiors; or peculiar to the diverse sorts of them. The
general duties belonging to all superiors, are first to approve themselves
worthy of honor, both in respect of their own virtues and good parts, and also
in their carriage toward their inferiors; and as they desire the honor of
parents, so to perform the duties which belong unto them. Secondly, to behave
themselves moderately, Deuteronomy 17. 20. Job 29 8. 1* Pet. 3. 7.
modestly, and gravely toward their inferiors, and not with proud insolency
and vain lightness. Thirdly, to go before them, according to knowledge, and
to shine unto them in a good example, and the light of a godly life. The duties
common to all inferiors, are both inwardly to esteem reverently of them
according to their place, acknowledging Gods Image in them, and honoring those
gifts of excellency which he has Job 29. 8. Genesis 18. 2, 8. 1. King. 2. 19. Job
29. 9, 10. 1. Pet. 3. 6. 1. Sam. 1. 15. Genesis 18. 4, 5. Mat. 8. 9.
bestowed upon them: and also outwardly to show reverence and respect of them
both, in all signs of honor; as rising up to them, putting off the hat,
bowing the knee, going to meet them, giving them precedence both in place and
speech, and using unto them words of reverence and due respect; and also by our
approouing of the inward reverence of our hearts, and the outward reverence
showed in these signs and complements, in truth and substance by all our
actions, when we have any occasion of performing this real reverence.

. Sect. 2 Of the duties of superiors in excellency, and of inferiors toward
them.
The special duties respect the diverse sorts of superiors and inferiors. For
men are superior unto others, either in excellency only, or in authority also
and government. In excellency, as first, those who are endued with better
gifts, whether inward or outward; Inward, as the gifts of the mind, to wit,
virtue, wisdom, learning, arts, and sciences; whose duty is, that
acknowledging them as talents lent unto them by God, of which Mat. 25. 14. 1.
Cor. 4. 7. 1. Cor. 15. 10.
they must give an account; they be not puffed up in pride because they excel
others, but rather be the more humble, in respect of that straight reckoning
which shall be required of them; and also, that with all care and good
conscience they employ these gifts principally to the glory of God 1. Cor. 12.
7.
that gave them, and in the next place, to the good of their neighbors, and
furthering of their own salvation. The duties of inferiors, are first, to
acknowledge their gifts, to the glory of God, and praising his bounty and
goodness toward them. Secondly, to reverence and respect the party endued
with them, and to seek to be profited by them, as our need requires, and
opportunity is offered. Superiors in outward gifts and place, are first the
aged, whose duties are to be in all their carriage Tit. 2. 2, 4. Pro. 16. 31.
and behavior grave and sober, to counsel and instruct the younger out of
their greater wisdom and experience, and to be examples and precedents unto
them of all good duties. And the duties of the 1. Tim. 5. 1. Leuit. 19. 32. Job
32. 4, 6, 7. Job 12 12. and 32. 7.
younger sort toward them, are to reverence them inwardly and outwardly as
fathers; to imitate their good example, and acknowledging their wisdom and
better experience, to make use of their counsel and instructions for their
information and direction. Secondly, superiors in birth and place, as nobility
and gentry; whose duty is, that as they are Peers of the Realm and pillars
of the Commonwealth, so they above others seek the good and flourishing
estate of it, and be as pillars of Marble, firm and strong, to uphold it with
their strength, like those pillars, Iachin and Boaz, which Solomon built, and
not through luxury, prodigality, and all excess, wasting their estates, and
retayning only their titles and honors, become like rotten posts, gilded and
painted, which let the building fall when it leanes upon them. Secondly, that
they approve themselves truly noble and generous, by being like the nobles of
Berea, more forward in receiving the Word, and Act. 17. 11.
embracing true Religion, then ordinary men. Thirdly, that being placed like
stars in this earthly firmament, they do good to their inferiors, both by
shining unto them in the light of a good and holy example, and by those vital
influences of comfort, in the works of protection, mercy, and Christian
charity, unto which, their greater means, high places and dignities do enable
them; and not like wandering Planets, which keep no where any settled
residence, and are so clouded with obscurity, that the poor know not where to
find them when they most need them. The duty of inferiors toward them is,
that they give unto them that honor and respect which is due unto their
places; and not envy unto them their high dignities, knowing that promotion
comes neither from the East nor West, but from God only wise, who pulls
down one, and sets up another, as it seems best to his godly wisdom.
Thirdly, superiors in wealth and riches, whose duty is to use them as great
and notable instruments of doing good, both publicly in the Church and
Commonwealth, and privately to particular persons, as God offers unto them
occasion and opportunity; and not wastefully consume them on their own lusts,
nor niggardly hoord them up, doing no good with them, either to themselves or
others. The duty of inferiors, and the poorer sort toward them, is, that as
God has advanced them above themselves in these temporal blessings, so in
humility acknowledging their preferment, they give unto them that respect which
their place and state requires; and communicate unto them the benefit of their
labors, as the other unto them the benefit of wages and rewards. Secondly,
that they reverence them, in respect of that ability with which God 1. Sam. 25.
8.
has enabled them, to do good publicly to Church and Commonwealth; and
privately unto themselves and others. Lastly, among superiors in excellency,
we are to number benefactours, whose duty is to give 2. Cor. 9. 7. Luke 6. 33,
34.
their benefits cheerfully, without grudging and quarrelsome wrangling, which
displeases more then the gift contenteth. Secondly, to give freely, and not
with sordid respect of greater advantage. Thirdly, speedily, whilst Pro. 3. 28.
there is power in their hands, and not after many delays. Fourthly,
discreetly making choice, either in respect of the parties worth, or at least,
Mat. 25. 40.
present necessity, and not rashly and carelessly, which is rather through
neglect of the gift, then for love of the party upon whom it is bestowed.
Lastly, having bestowed benefits, they must not boast of them to others, nor
Iam. 1. 5.
insult over the party to whom they have done good, which were but to make
their benefit as a golden chain to bind them to slavery, nor finally to
vpbraid them with what they have done upon every slight occasion, which is no
more pleasant to the party who has fed of their favors, then the distastefull
vpbraydings which follow a surfeit. The duties of inferiors toward their
benefactours, are first, inward and hearty thankfulness, whereby they
acknowledge them as Gods instruments in doing them good, and accordingly love
and respect them according to their desert. Secondly, they are not to vilify
the benefit, but highly to esteem it, either for its worth, or their necessity
and use of it, or the mind and good will of the giver. And outwardly also they
are to testify their thankfulness, both by word in thanksgiving, praising
their benefactour Romans 16. 4.
as opportunity is offered, and magnifying the greatness of the benefit
received; and also in deed, both by being always ready to make requital when
God shall give ability; and by supplying what is wanting in their power, by
their fervent prayers for them unto God, 2. Tim. 1. 16.
who is all-sufficient to recompense and reward their bounty toward them.

. Sect. 3 The duties of superiors in authority in general, and of inferious
toward them.
Superiors in authority are such, as have not only a place of excellency
above us, but also of power and jurisdiction as our governors. Whose duty in
general is to use all good discipline, both in respect of rule and
government, and also due correction and punishment. They ought to govern them
in the Lord as his deputies and in his stead, and therefore to do the acts of
justice, as if God himself were present, or did but use their bodies, tongues
and parts to perform his own will. In which respect their chief care must
be, as to do Justice themselves, and administer righteous judgment; so to
contain their inferiors in the duties of 1. Tim. 2. 2.
piety and justice, therein seeking not themselves or their own gain, by
corruption, bribery, extorsion, or any kind of wrong and oppression, but Romans
13. 4, 6. 2. Chro. 19. 6.
the glory of God chiefly, and next unto it, the good of their societies, and
of every particular person under their government. In respect of correction and
punishment, their duty is, to administer Justice, according to the quality of
their inferiors offense, wherein they are to use discretion, rightly judging
both of the cause and the disposition of the offendour, and correcting lighter
faults and infirmities, with rebukes and threatenings, and greater faults
committed wilfully, with real punishments, proceeding herein with wisdom,
judgment, love and patience, seeking either the amendment of the parties if
they be corrigible, or of the societies in which they live, by taking away
sin and evil, auerting Gods more fearful and general judgments, and
causing others to fear, and Genesis 18. 21. Josh. 7. 25.
so to avoid the like sins; and not out of passion, choler, and hatred of
their persons. And secondly, they must use herein equity and moderation, so
mixing and tempering justice with mercy, as that they be in inflicting these
corrections and punishments, neither indulgent and remiss, nor ouer-seuere and
cruel. The duties of inferiors toward them, Leuit. 19. 3. Ephe. 5. 33. and
6. 5.
are to reverence and stand in awe of them, as standing in Gods place, and
executing his judgments, and not to contemn them or their government; to
obey them in all things lawful, and to submit themselves unto Ephe. 6. 1, 2.
Col. 3. 22, 23. 1. Pet. 2. 13, 18. Romans 13. 2. Pro. 15. 10, 32. Mat. 15. 4, 5,
6.
their corrections, without resistance or murmuring; and to testify their love
and thankfulness toward them, by their cheerful service, and by
communicating their goods unto them, as their own ability, and their necessity
shall require.

. Sect. 4 The duties of superiors and inferiors in the family: And first, of
man and wife toward one another.
The special duties of superiors in government and their inferiors, are to
be distinguished according to their several sorts. For Governors Genesis 2. 14.
Ephe. 5. 27, 28, 29.
are either private in families, or public in the Church and Commonwealth. In
families, as the husband, who is superior in government over his wife,
parents over their children, and Masters and Mistresses over their servants.
The duties of man and wife are either common to both, or special belonging to
either party. Common duties are first, conjugal love, whereby being one flesh,
they love one another above all others, both in respect of their souls and
bodies, temporal and spiritual good, and all that belong to either party, as
kindred and friends. Secondly, communion and communication, first, of their
bodies by mutual benevolence 1. Cor. 7. 2, 3, 4, 5.
performed by one to the other; and conjugal fidelity, whereby either of them
keep themselves proper to the other, and preserve the Pro. 5. 18, 19. Mat. 2.
15. Pro. 2. 17. 1. Pet. 3. 7. 1. Cor. 7. 10. Genesis 2. 18.
marriage bond inviolable; and finally, as a means of both the other, there is
required cohabitation and dwelling together, unless it be for a time, and
upon necessary occasion. Secondly, communion of their goods, labors, endeavors
and mutual help for the good and comfort of one another. The peculiar duties
of the husband are, to behave himself as an 1. Cor. 11. 3 Ephe. 5. 23. 1. Pet.
3. 7. 1. Cor. 14. 35. Ruth 3. 9. Ephe. 5. 23, 25, 33.
head to the body; to carry himself in his place according to knowledge,
governing, guiding and instructing his wife in all good duties; to protect her
to the uttermost of his power against all evil and injury; to bear with her
infirmities, and to cover her weaknesses and frailties; to cherish her as the
more tender part of himself; to provide for her, according to his ability, all
things needful and comfortable; admitting her to the joint fruition of all
their goods, and finally, to rule her with a sweet and amiable government, so
as not only her body, but also Genesis 26. 8. 1. Pet. 3. 7.
her will and heart may be subject unto him. The duties peculiar to the wife,
are, to acknowledge her husband to be her head and governor, 1. Pet. 3. 6.
Ephesians 5. 33. Genesis 20. 6. and 24. 65. Col. 3. 18. 1. Pet. 3. 16. 1. Cor. 14. 34.
1. Tim. 2. 12. Pro 21. 9, 19. Tit. 2. 4.
and accordingly, in her heart to reverence and respect him, in her words to be
dutiful, humble and pleasing, and in all her actions and behavior, to be
meek, submissiue and obedient, as unto her Lord and head. To be amiable and
gracious, indeuouring in all lawful things to please him, and not to usurp
dominion over him, or to vex him, by being of an unquiet and provoking spirit.
To cherish her husband as the better part of her self; and to minister unto
him all things necessary and comfortable; to keep his secrets, and preserve
his honor; to manage well, as becomes a good huswife, all things committed
to her charge, for the good of her husband and the whole family, and to be a
fit helper, Pro. 31. 10, 11, etc. 1. Tim. 5. 14.
and no less loving then careful, assistant for the good of his body and
soul, and for the well managing of their estate, and the wise government of
the whole family.

. Sect. 5 The duties of husband and wife toward the rest of the family.
And these are the mutual duties of man and wife between themselves. Besides
which, there are diverse duties by them to be performed, 1. Tim. 3 4.
as they are governors over the family; and those are either common to all the
household, or else special, as they are parents over their children, or
masters and mistresses over their servants. The common duties are, First, to
rule them in the Lord, keeping them in godly obedience: and Secondly, to
provide for them. They are to be ruled both by instruction and discipline. By
instruction, as by doctrine and example. By doctrine, respecting Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7.
2. Tim. 3. 15. Genesis 18. 19.
private catechizing, reading of the Scriptures, and religious writings, and
the public ministry, by causing them not only to frequent it, but also by
teaching them to use it aright, both by preparation before they go to hear,
and examination afterward. So likewise they must be no less careful to teach
them by example, both in their holy profession of Religion, and conscionable
practice of all Christian duties; knowing that Job 1. 5. Josh. 24. 15.
examples especially of governors, are no less powerful then precepts,
either to draw them to good, and withdraw them from evil, or contrariwise:
unto which instruction, discipline must be adjoined, both by rewarding those
that deserve well, and correcting them that offend, either in words only, as
by reproves and threatenings; or in deeds also, by blows and stripes, to be
inflicted in wisdom, love and moderation. Finally, as it is their duty to
rule them; so also to provide 1. Tim. 5. 8. Pro. 31. 15, 21. Genesis 30. 30.
for them all necessaries, as food, raiment, wages, rest and recreation.

. Sect. 6 The duties of parents and children.
The special duties of parents toward their children, are, that they love
them with parent-like affection, and take singular care of them; and Psalm. 103.
13. 2. Sam 18. 33. 1. Tim. 5. 10.
both these, first, in regard of their natural life, in which respect there is
required, 1. that they nourish and bring them up: 2. that they fit them for
some honest calling according to their own ability, and the disposition and
gifts of their children: 3. that they govern and direct them in matters of
moment, and chiefly in contracting marriage: and lastly, Genesis 24. 1, 2. 1.
Cor. 7. 36, 37.
that they provide and lay up for them, as God shall give honest and lawful
means, not wronging others, nor defrauding themselves of things necessary 2.
Cor. 12. 14. 1. Tim. 5. 8. Genesis 17. 23. Exodus 4. 25, 26, Luke 1. 59, 60. Pro.

and comfortable. In respect of their spiritual life, their duty is, as they
bring them into the covenant of grace, made not only to them, but also to
their seed, so to procure for them the Sacrament of the covenant. Secondly,
that they bring them up in the fear of the Lord, both by instruction, example
and discipline. Lastly, that they pray for them, and give them their daily
blessing. The duties of children toward their parents, are first, to be
answerable to them in love. Secondly, to reverence them highly, though their
state be never so mean, in and for the Lord. Leuit. 19. 3.
Thirdly, to stand in awe of them, and to have respect to their very words and
countenance. Fourthly, Ephe. 6. 1. Col. 3. 20.
to obey them in all things lawful and in the Lord. Mat. 15. 4, 56. 1. Tim. 5.
4. Genesis 47. 12.
Fifthly, to show themselves thankful to their parents, by helping them, if
need require, with their goods or Luke 15. 29.
service. Sixthly, to hearken to their parents Pro. 1. 8. and 22. 19. and 4. 4.
instructions, counsels, admonitions and rebukes, and to bear with
meekness and love their chastizements and Heb. 12. 7, 9.
corrections. Seventhly, to be contented and willing to be ruled by their
parents in matters of importance, as Heb. 5. 8.
marriage. Eighthly, to preserve their parents goods, good name, and all that
belongs unto them. And finally, to love and respect those who are near and
dear to their parents, for their sakes.

. Sect. 7 The duties of masters and servants.
The duties of masters and mistresses toward their servants, are, first,
equity and moderation, both in their commandments, which ought to Genesis 24. 8.
1. Chro. 11. 17. 2. King. 5. 13. Phile. ver. 16. Ephe. 6. 9. Col. 4. 1. Deuteronomy.
25. 4. Deuteronomy. 15. 13, 14. Pro. 17. 2.
be lawful, possible to them, profitable, proportionable to their abilities,
and on the Sabbath necessary; and also in their government, which ought to be
mixed with love, and sustaining the place of parents, to use them as children,
as brethren in Christ, and children of the same Father, and as fellow-seruants
of the same heavenly Lord and Master. Secondly, they must use toward them
bounty, and liberally reward their well deserving, both by suffering them to
thrive with them whilst they are in their service, by preferring and rewarding
them when they depart upon good terms and after a lawful manner; and by
esteeming them after they are departed, as their friends. The duties of
servants toward their governors are, First, that they love them; and out of
this love, tender their credit and welfare, and bear all good affection to
their children and friends. Secondly, 1. Tim. 6. 1. 2. King. 5. 15. Mal. 1. 6.
that they reverence, honor and fear them. Thirdly, that they Ephe. 6. 5.
Col. 3. 22, 23.
submit themselves to their commandments, and obey them in all things in the
Lord; and also to their 1. Pet. 2. 18. Genesis 16. 9.
corrections and chastizements. Fourthly, that they be diligent and painful,
not idle and slothful. Fifthly, faithful and true, doing their work not with
eye-seruice, but as well when their governors are absent as present. Sixthly,
that they be quiet and patient, being reproved, and not stubborn, giving one d
Genesis 31. 40. Tit. 2. 10. Tit. 2. 9.
word for another. Seventhly, that they be secret, and not discover their
masters secrets. Eighthly, that they be thrifty, respecting in all things
their masters profit, and not riotous and wastfull; And lastly, that they be
ready to please them in all things lawful or indifferent.

. Sect. 8 The duties of Ministers and people.
And so much for the duties of superiors and inferiors in the family. Public
governors and their inferiors, are such as are in the Church or Common
wealth. In the Church, superiors governing, are the Ministers, and inferiors
governed, are the people committed to their Judge. 17. 10. and 18. 19. 2. King.
13. 14. 1. Cor. 4. 15. Gal 4. 19. Philem. 10.
charge. For Ministers are the spiritual fathers of the people, being the
ordinary means of begetting them, and of their regeneration and new birth, by
the immortal seed of Gods Word; and the people are their children, begotten
unto God by their Ministry. The which should move the Ministers to carry
themselves toward their flock, as it becomes fathers, in all love, care,
vigilancie, diligence, in providing for the good of them by all means,
especially the spiritual good of their souls, as they desire to have the
honor, reverence, and respect, which is due to fathers; and the people to
perform all duties of children toward their Ministers, loving, reuerencing,
and obeying them in all things appertaining to the good of their souls, as
they desire that they should receive from them the privileges of children, and
the benefit of their Ministry, for their regeneration and new birth. The
special duties of Ministers Act 20. 28. 1. Tim. 4. 16. Tit. 2 7, 8. 2. Tim. 4.
2.
respect either their Ministry, or their life and conversation, in both which,
they are to go before the people, both in doctrine and holy example. In regard
of his Ministry, he is to preach the Word of God truly, sincerely,
diligently, and powerfully, in season and out of season, respecting herein the
performance of his own duty to the glory of God, and the 1 Cor. 9. 16. Ezech
34. 2. Zach. 11. 17.
furtherance of his own salvation, and the good of the Luke 11. 42. Pro. 29.
18. Romans 1. 16, 17. 1. Cor. 1. 21.
people committed to his charge. In his life he ought to be an Tit. 2. 7. 1.
Tim. 4. 12. 1. These. 2. 10.
example unto his flock. Unto which is required generally, that his life be 1.
Tim. 3. Tit. 1. 6.
blameless, and more specially, that it be in respect of God, 1. Tim. 4 7, 12.
and 6. 11.
holy and religious, in respect of his neighbors, just, charitable, meek,
courteous, and liberal; and in respect of himself, 2 Timothy 2. 22.
sober, temperate, chaste, and modest. The special duties of the people
toward their Ministers, are first, that they 1 These. 5. 13. Gal. 4. 15.
love them dearly. Secondly, that they have them in Phil. 2. 29. 2. Cor. 7.
19. Gal 4. 14.
high reverence and esteem for their works sake. Thirdly, that they Heb. 13.
17.
submit themselves to their Ministry, and obey them. Fourthly, that they 1.
Tim. 5. 17, 18. Pro. 3. 9. Gal. 6. 6, 7. 1. Cor. 9. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13.
allow them liberal maintenance.

. Sect. 9 The duties of Magistrates and subjects.
In the Commonwealth political duties to be performed, are either common to
all the members of this body, which is, that they 2. Sam. 24. 17. Neh. 1. 4.
and 2. 3. Ier. 9 1. Ps. 122. 6, 7, 8.
love their country, and prefer in their judgments, desires and endeavors
the good of it, before the good of all others, or of themselves; or the
special duties of superiors and inferiors, as the supreme Sovereign and
Magistrates, or subjects and people. The general duty of the former is, that
as they desire the honor of parents, 1. Pet. 2. 13, 14. Genesis 4^. 8. Judge. 5. 7.
so to carry themselves in all things as fathers of their country and
subjects. The special duty of Sovereign Princes, is the good, lawful, and
commendable exercise of his sovereign power, especially in making good Laws,
and seeing them duly executed; in creating and making good Magistrates of
State, and containing them in their duty; in showing mercy unto those whom they
may lawfully pardon, being obnoxious to the rigor of the Law, and Justice
toward those, who by the Laws of God and the Commonwealth ought to die. In
hearing of causes of great importance, which respect the good of the
Commonwealth, and of particular persons, especially of high and last appeals;
in waging wars, and concluding peace, so as they may be just, profitable, and
safe for their Country. In all which, he is to aim chiefly at Gods glory,
and the good of the Church and Commonwealth. Which duties that he may
perform, he must be qualified and furnished with many excellent virtues; as
Deuteronomy. 17. 19.
piety, religion, and the true fear of God; Pro. 29. 4.
Justice, Pro. 20. 28.
clemency, Deuteronomy. 17. 17. Pro. 28. 16.
bounty and liberality, Psalm. 2. 10.
wisdom and learning, Ios. 1 6. Deuteronomy. 31. 23.
fortitude and courage, Pro. 30. 4, 5. Eccl. 10. 13, 14.
temperance and sobriety, Deuteronomy. 17. 17. Pro. 31. 3.
chastity, Deuteronomy. 17. 20. Psalm. 131. 1. Exodus 18. 21. Deuteronomy. 1. 13. and 16. 19,

Mat 17. 27. and 22 21. Psalm. 82. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13, 14.
modesty, and humility. The special duty of Magistrates is, that in executing
of their office, they conscionably labor to advance the glory of God, the
honor of their Sovereign, and the good of the whole Commonwealth, and of all
the particular members of it. Unto which these virtues are required in them,
that they be men of k courage, fearing God, lovers of justice, haters of wrong
and all evil, faithful and true, free from covetousness, and haters of
bribes and rewards, wise and prudent, just and impartial, having in judgment
no respect of any man's person. The special duties of subjects toward their
Sovereign, are first, a singular love of them, approved by their special
care of their safety, by their high esteem of them, and frequent and fervent
prayers for them. Secondly, to honor and reverence them as the supreme
governors under Christ, over all persons, and in all causes. Thirdly, to be
obedient and subject unto them in all things lawful, and that in the Lord, and
for conscience sake. Fourthly, to be serviceable and helpefull unto them, both
with their bodies and states. The special duties of the people toward their
Magistrates are, to love and reverence them as Gods deputies, to submit
themselves to their lawful Commandments and punishments, and finally to be
thankful unto them, and ready with all cheerfulness to allow unto them such
stipends and fees, as are due for their maintenance.

CAP. XII.
Of the duties required in the sixth Commandment.

. Sect. 1 Of the sum of this Commandment: And of anger and hatred.
IN the four following Commandments are all those common virtues and duties
required, which concern all our neighbors in general, and all the contrary
vices and sins forbidden; all which concern either their person and life, or
the adjuncts belonging to them, as their chastity, goods and fame. Those
virtues and vices which respect the person and life, are enjoined or forbidden
in the sixth Commandment, in these words, Thou shall not kill; which has
precedence before the other, because the person and life are of greater worth
and excellency then the adjuncts that appertain unto them. The sum whereof
is this, that we in all our thoughts, words, and deeds, embrace all virtues,
and perform all duties which tend to the good of the person, and preservation
of the life, both of our neighbors and our selves, and flee the contrary vices
and sins, whether they be inward or outward. And these are either the roots
and fountains from whence the rest do spring and flow; as anger and hatred;
or the fruits and streams which arise and issue from them. The first duty
commanded, is just anger against the sins of our neighbors and our Ephesians. 46.
26. Mar. 3. 5.
selves; unto which is required, that it arise from just causes, and be
directed to good ends, that it be in a lawful manner and measure, and continue
a fit and convenient time. And heereunto are required as the means of it,
patience, long-suffering, and mildness, goodness, slownesse to anger, and
readiness to forgive. The contrary vice whereof is here forbidden, of which I
will not here speak, having written largely of it in another Treatise of
Anger.
place. The second virtue commanded, is an holy hatred of our own and our
neighbors sins, which is always joined with the love of the persons. Leuit.

. Sect. 2 Of the inward duties and virtues here required
Other more special fruits may be distinguished, according to the difference
of persons toward whom they are referred. As first, if our neighbors are in
prosperity, we are not to envy them if they be our superiors, nor to emulate
them being our equals, nor to disdain them being our inferiors; but
contrariwise, Number. 11 29. Act. 26. 29.
wish unto them all good things which we have, or they want, and congratulate
their welfare, and communicate with them in our Romans 12 15. 1. Cor. 12. 26.
rejoicing at their happiness. If they be in adversity, we are not to
contemn, or to be hard-hearted toward them, much less to rejoice at their
evils and miseries, but to take Luke 7. 13. Romans 12. 15. Luk 6. 36.
pity and compassion on them, and according to our ability, to show mercy unto
them. Unto these virtues and duties we may add Pro. 18. 24. Deuteronomy. 13. 6.
Christian friendship in the Lord, which ought to be sincere and constant Luke
6. 35.
Christian charity, whereby we love our enemies for the Lords sake, Ephesians. 4. 27.
Mat. 23. 24.
placablenesse and desire of reconciliation, abstayning from all enmity, open
hostility, and secret grudge; Pro. 6. 1^, 19. and 17. 9.
a desire and forwardness to preserve friendship between others, and to
restore it being dissolved, by making peace and amity. Toward those which are
under our power, we must abstain from all Pro. 12. 10. and 11. 17.
cruelty, backed either with our authority or might, and use all Jude v. 22.

clemency toward them, as much as will stand with their good; and
contrariwise, from indulgence and fond cockering, not bearing with their
sins, for foolish love to the parties, but using due and necessary severity,
when vices can no otherwise be reformed and amended. Unto those who dwell in
the same society, we are to use concord and peaceablenesse, to which purpose
we must resist the beginnings of contention, take away the occasions, and
sometimes depart from our own right, to preserve or redeem peace. And toward
strangers, our duty is to use good hospitality, especially to the poor and
harbourlesse. Finally, as we are to preserve our neighbors person and life,
by performing all these inward duties unto them, so are we to show the outward
signs of them in our countenance, eyes, gesture, and voice, which must be so
mild, sweet, and gracious, that they promise to the beholders and hearers
nothing but humanity, brotherly love, and good will.

. Sect. 3 Of outward duties here required, respecting the person of our
neighbors.

person and life, respect our words or deeds. In respect of the former, there
is required, that we have a peaceable tongue, which speaks all good and no
evil, to and of our neighbors. Unto them, we must use loving and courteous
speeches, and abstain from all brawling and scolding, railing and reuiling,
scoffing and scorning, unchristian menacings toward inferiors, and murmuring
toward superiors; and cursings and imprecations toward any man. And of them,
we must not behind their backs use tale-bearing, and slandering, nor lend our
ears to those who offer these wrongs unto them. In respect of our deeds, all
our works and actions must tend to the preservation and defense of our
neighbors life and person, but especially of his immortal soul, which ought,
as it is most precious in it self, so to be most dear unto us. In which
regard, we must omit no duty which may defend and preserve the life and person
of our neighbors, when we can and may lawfully perform it. We must not by our
negligence leave any thing undone, nor by our wilfulness do any thing whereby
they may be endangered. Neither must we commit any act which tends to his
hurt and hazard. But we must have peaceable hands, and not in time of peace,
quarrel and fight; and innocent hands, free and clean from blood, neither
hurting and wounding the body of our neighbors, nor killing and taking away
his life; but contrariwise we must be beneficent, and in all our actions do
them all good; using humanity and mercy to all, and brotherly love and
kindness toward those who are of the household of faith.

. Sect. 4 Of the duties which we owe to our neighbors soul.
The duties which tend to the preservation of the life of our neighbors soul,
are either natural or spiritual. In the former respect we Genesis 45. 27. Pro.
17. 22. Genesis 27. 46. Exodus 1. 14. Pro. 10. 1. 1. Sam. 1. 6, 7. 1. Cor. 10 32.
1. Ioh. 2. 10. 1. Cor. 9. 19, 2.
ought to preserve their lives, in cheering and comforting them by our sweet
and Christian conversation; and not unjustly offer unto them any occasion
whereby they may be vexed and grieved. In respect of the latter, we are not to
hinder by any means the salvation of others, nor to be any ways an offense
unto them, neglecting their salvation, as though it were a thing not belonging
to us; but contrariwise, use all good means whereby they may be won to
Christ, edified in their most holy faith, and furthered in the way of holiness
and righteousness, which will bring them to everlasting happiness. To which
end, we must not commit any act whereby we may be scandalous unto another, and
a cause of his sin, either by 1. Kin. 21. 7, 25.
provocation, 2. Sam. 16. 21. Mat. 16. 23.
evil counsel, or Romans 14. 15.
bad example; but contrariwise perform cheerfully all duties belonging to the
communion of Saints Romans 1. 11, 12. 1. These. 5. 11, 14. Iam. 1. 19.
in spiritual things, as mutual Heb. 10.

shining before all in the light of a good life and holy example.

. Sect. 5 Of duties belonging to our own persons.
Besides which duties which we owe to our neighbors, there are diverse others
required in this Commandment, which are to be performed to our selves, for
the good, preservation, and defense of our persons and lives, and especially
for the salvation of our souls. In respect of our bodies and lives here is
required, that we use all good and lawful means Mat. 6., 1. Pro. 17. 22.
Eccl. 3. 22.
whereby our health may be preserved, as temperance and sobriety in diet,
moderate sleep and labor, honest and moderate recreations of body and mind,
cheerfulness and honest joy, rejoicing in the fruition of Gods blessings; or
if it be lost and impaired, whereby we may recover it, as good diet, physic,
etc. Secondly, that we by all good and lawful means preserve our safety, by
avoiding unnecessary dangers, or recover Mat. 4. 6. Number. 16. 38. 1. Sam. 31. 4.
our selves out of them, if we be fallen into them; by repelling gross
injuries, and avoiding causlesse quarrels, and all other means, whereby our
lives are needlessly hazarded. But above all, here is required, that we
earnestly endeavor in the use of all good means which may further the
salvation of our souls, and avoid the contrary whereby it may be hindered. The
which must not be delayed, nor posted off from time to time, as it is the
practice of those, who from day to day defer their repentance; but we must
first seek the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, both Mat. 6. 33.
in order and time, giving it the precedencie; and also in degree, more
earnestly in our judgments esteeming, in our affections embracing, and in our
practice seeking and laboring after the means of our salvation, especially
our effectual calling and conversion, our justification by a lively Eccl. 2.
11. Phil. 3. 8. 1. Ioh. 2. 15.
faith, and sanctification unto holiness of life, then in any thing in the
world besides; yea contemning and rejecting all earthly pleasures, profits, and
preferments, as vain and unprofitable in comparison of them. And with the like
care and endeavor, we must avoid all means whereby our salvation may be
hindered, especially sin, which is the bane of the soul, and not give way to
the committing of it wittingly and willingly, though for hire, the whole world
were offered unto us, the gain whereof, will in Mark. 8. 36.
no sort recompense the loss of our souls, as our Savior tells us. Or if
we be overtaken with it, and by the law of our members, warring against Romans 7.
24. Pro. 28. 13.
the law of our minds, be led captive unto sin: our next care must be, not
to lie in it, no not for an hour, but to rise out of it speedily by unfeigned
repentance, and by humble confession and earnest suite for pardon and
remission, seek reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ.

CAP. XIII.
Of the duties required in the seventh Commandment.

. Sect. 1 The sum of the seventh Commandment* The duties which it inioyneth,
and vices which it forbids.
THe three following Commandments respect the adjuncts of our neighbors
persons: for after that God had provided for the life and person of our
neighbor and our selves (which is the chief and principal) in the former
Commandment he descends down lower, to make provision for the good, and
preservation of all that belong both unto them and us. And these are either
internal or external: internal, as the chastity and purity of our own, and
our neighbors persons, in the seventh Commandment: external, as the
preservation of propriety in goods in the eighth, and our own and neighbors
good name in the ninth. Next unto the Commandment that respects life, the
seventh Commandment which provides for the chastity and purity of the person,
has place, as coming nearest unto life in worth and excellency, and to be
preferred before all outward things, either goods or good name. For if the
persons of men be unchaste, and defiled with unclean lusts, then must also
marriage, which is the fountain of life and generation, be defiled; and from
such a fountain what can spring, but an unclean and filthy life, which is not
to be preferred before death it self? And therefore next unto the
preservation of our lives, our chiefest care must be to preserve our chastity
and purity, which is the very life of our life, and without which, it would
bring no true joy or comfort unto us. The which, the Lord requires of us in
the seventh Commandment, in these words; Thou shall not commit adultery. In
which words, the Lord forbids all unclean lusts, with all the means and
signs of them, and also that we should be accessory unto the uncleanness of
others; and contrariwise commands the preservation of our chastity and
purity, with the means and signs of it, and also, that as much as in us
lies, we provide for the chastity of our neighbors. Now this chastity is
either inward in the soul and heart, or outward in the body. First then, we
must preserve the inward chastity of the soul, from all motions and passions
of unclean lusts, and 2. Tim. 2. 22. 1. Pet. 2 11. Mat. 5. 28. 1. Ioh. 2. 16.
Col. 3. 5.
unlawful concupiscence of the flesh, which is the adultery of the heart, that
our Savior condemns, and that concupiscence of the flesh, and evil
concupiscence, which the Apostles forbid. Neither is all concupiscence evil
and to be condemned; for that is lawful, whereby we desire the propagation of
mankind by natural generation, being Gods ordinance, and enjoined in the
state of innocence; if it be neither immoderate, Genesis 1. 18. Heb. 13. 4. 1.
Cor. 7. 1, 2, 3, 5 1. These. 4. 4. Psalm. 119. 37. Job 31. 1 Ephesians. 4. 29. and 5.
4, 6. 1. Cor. 15. 33. Col. 3. 8.
immodest, nor unseasonable. Secondly, we must preserve our outward chastity,
and possess our vessels in holiness and honor. Unto which is required the
chastity of our eyes, containing them from beholding wanton and unclean
objects; of our ears, stopping them against all rotten, corrupt, and filthy
communication; of our tongues, restraining them from all beastly and bawdy
speaking; and of our actions, abstaining from all acts of uncleanness, wanton
and unchaste pleasures. And thus we are to preserve our chastity, either in
single life, which is the gift of continency and pure abstinence, both from
unclean lusts, and also from marriage; or in wedlock, unto which is required
conjugal fidelity, the moderate, modest, and seasonable use of the marriage
bed; and pure abstinence, upon necessary and just occasions, as in time of
absence, and of Leuit. 18. 19. and 20. 18. 1. Cor. 7. 5.
the woman's separation, or that upon fit occasions we may wholly give our
selves to fasting and prayer.

. Sect. 2 The means of preserving chastity.
But whosoever would thus preserve their chastity, they must be no less
careful to use all good means of it, and to shun the contrary Mat. 19. 11.
1. Cor. 7. 7. 1. Cor. 5. 6, 9, 11. Ephesians. 5. 7. Pro. 23. 20.
means and occasions. As first, they must beg it of God by prayer, seeing it
is his gift alone. Secondly, they must have no society and familiarity with the
unchaste and filthy, wanton and effeminate, drunken and gluttonous persons; but
keep company with those who are sober and chaste, modest and temperate.
Thirdly, they must use the preservatives of chastity, as sobriety, which
consists, as it is here considered, in moderating the delights of the taste,
in the temperate use of Ezech. 16. 49. Pro. 23. 33. 1. Pet. 4 3. Genesis 19. 32,
33.
diet, and abstinence from gluttony and drunkenness, or the excessive drinking
of wine and strong drinks; and also of the sight, in abstaining from unchaste
and immodest objects, as beautiful and wanton persons, obscene pictures,
unchaste and wanton Enterludes, Plays, and Books. Secondly, diligence and
painfulness in our callings and honest labors, not giving way to idleness
and sloth; vigilance and abstinence Ezech. 16 49. 2. Sam. 11. 2. 1. Pet. 4. 7.
1. These. 5. 6. 1. Tim. 5. 6. and 2. 9, 10. Tit. 2. 3.
from immoderate sleep; and finally, modesty in our eyes and countenance, in
our speeches and communication, in our gesture and gate, and in our habit and
attire. Which means if we find insufficient for the preserving of our souls
and bodies in purity and chastity; then are we called of God, to use the
lawful remedy, which is the holy and honest estate of marriage, that we may
live chastely in wedlock, when we 1. Cor. 7. 2. 9. Heb. 13. 4.
cannot do it in single life.

. Sect. 3 Of the duties which are required in the right getting of our goods.
THE eighth Commandment, expressed in these words, Thou shall not steal,
inioyneth us to preserve and increase by all good means, as much as in us
lies, our own and neighbors good, respecting goods and possessions; and not
only forbids all those vices and sins whereby they are any way hindered or
impaired, but also requires all virtues and good duties, whereby they are
preserved and advanced. And these duties are either more general or special.
The general duties stand in these degrees. First, that we be not hurtful to
our neighbors, in hindering or impairing their estate, by doing them any wrong
or injury; or if Mat. 10. 19. 1. Cor. 6. 7, 8. Exodus 22. 5. Ioh 6. 12. Deuteronomy.
22. 1, 2, 3. Exodus 23. 4, 5. Ephe. 4. 28.
we have, that we make them satisfaction and amends. Secondly, that we
preserve, as much as in us lies, our own and neighbors goods from all waste
and damage. Thirdly, that we be beneficial and helpful to all, as far as
we are able, and their necessity requires, and employ our goods as we ought,
to our own and others good. The special duties respect either the just and
honest possession of our goods, unto which is required that we both get and
keep them in a good manner, and by just and lawful means; or the lawful and
laudable use of those goods, which we have thus lawfully gotten. Unto the just
getting of our goods, four virtues Col 3. 3. 1. Tim. 6. 10. Heb. 13. 5. Psalm.
62. 10. Math 6. 33. 1. Tim. 6. 6, 7, 8. Phil. 4. 11, 12.
are required. First, that we do not immoderately love money, which is the
root of all evil, nor set our hearts upon riches and the earthly Mammon.
Secondly, contentedness with that condition, which God in his wise, just and
Fatherly providence has alloted unto us; for discontent disposes men to covet
and seek more then is needful, though it be by unlawful means; to which
vice they make themselves subject, who have Mat. 6. 11. Pro. 30. 8. 1. Tim 6.
8. and 5. 8. Act. 20. 35. Pro. 5. 15, 16. Ephe. 4. 28. Pro. 30. 8. Ephe. 4 28.

11, 25. Phil. 4. 6.
not learned to live within their compass. Thirdly, a moderate desire of such
things as are necessary and convenient, both for our own maintenance according
to the necessity of nature, person and state; and also for the relief and
benefit of others, and that both for private persons, and public service of
Church and Commonwealth. The which desire ought on the one side to be free
from a Frier-like affection of poverty, and on the other side, from
covetousness and ambition, whereby men setting their hearts immoderately upon
earthly profits and preferments, do resolve that they will compass them by
what means soever, good or bad; and make all possible haste to atchieue their
ends; having, after they have much, an insatiable desire of obtaining more.
Lastly, a moderate, provident and wise care to provide those things which are
convenient and necessary for us and those that belong to us, by honest and
lawful means; so that we be neither carelessly improuident, nor vex and
turmoile our selves with an immoderate, diffident and carking care. And these
are the things which are required inwardly in our own hearts and affections
unto just getting of our goods. Now goods are thus gotten either without
contract, and that either by our selves, or received from others. By our selves
either accidentally, as by finding things lost, the owners being unknown,
though diligently enquired after, or ordinarily by our honest Ephesians. 4. 28.
and painful labor in a lawful calling. Or else they are gotten in lawful
contracts, the general rule whereof is this, that in all our dealings,
borrowing and lending, buying and selling, letting, setting, taking and hiring,
etc. we behave our selves uprightly without dissimulation or guile, Psalm. 15.
2, 4. Zach. 8. 16. Ezech. 22. 12. 1. These. 4. 6.
as in the sight of God, observing in our words, truth; in our promises,
faithfulness; in our deeds; justice; and in all things keeping a good
conscience toward God and men, not dealing deceitfully with any, nor using any
fraud for the getting of our goods, either in respect of matter or manner,
quantity or quality, or any other unjust means whatsoever. Or if we have
failed in any of these, and gotten any goods by fraud and deceit, we must
repute it no better then theft, and therefore hold our selves bound to make
restitution unto those whom we have wronged; or in case they cannot be found or
known, unto the poor or Church, or good uses; without which we can never
approve our repentance for these sins to be found and sincere, so as it will
be accepted of God, and bring comfort unto our own souls.

. Sect. 4 Of the duties which respect the right use of our goods.
And these are the duties which we ought to perform, in respect of the lawful
getting and possessing of our goods; the duties which concern the Eccles. 5.
17, 18.
right use of them, respect either our selves, which is the lawful and
comfortable fruition of them; or others, which consists in the free and wise
communication of them. Concerning the former, having justly gotten goods into
our possession, we are comfortably to enjoy them, as the good gifts and
blessings of God; unto which, two virtues are required; First, that (shunning
niggardliness, which keeps men not only from the communicating Eccl. 6. 2.
and 4. 8
of their goods to others, but also from inioying them for their own benefit,
committing therein a double theft) we do embrace parsimonie, which consists
in the honest saving and sparing of our goods, that they be not idly and
unprofitably wasted and spent. Secondly, Pro. 27. 23. to 28.
that avoiding wastfulnesse, and misspending our wealth to uses either
dishonest or above our means and ability; we do embrace frugality, which
consists in the discreet, sober and moderate spending of our goods,
according to our calling and ability, to profitable, charitable and needful
uses, in which this rule is to be observed, that our expenses in some
reasonable good proportion, be less then our commings in. To the free
communication of our goods to the benefit of others, two other Pro. 21. 21.
virtues are required. First, that shunning covetousness and hardhartednesse,
1. Joh. 3. 17. Pro. 21. 13. Luke. 16. 23, 24.
which depriueth us of all pity and compassion toward those that are in want,
we do embrace bounty and liberality, whereby we communicate our goods
willingly and cheerfully unto those that need our help. And secondly, that
avoiding prodigality and riotous wastfulnesse, we do embrace justice and
equity, giving only our own, without wronging others, and in such a discreet
proportion and moderation, Pro. 5. 15, 16.
that we dry not up the fountain of our beneficence, so as we cannot be
helpefull to our selves or others. Now this free communicating of our goods, is
either for a time by Psalm. 112. 5.
lending, or for ever by giving, either publicly to good uses, 2. Sam. 17. 27.
civil or Pro. 3. 9.
ecclesiastical; or privately, as by bestowing benefits upon them who have
well deserved, or by Heb. 13. 16. Luke 21. 4. Matthew. 25. 35.
giving alms, and relieuing the necessities of our poor brethren, of which I
have entreated more fully in In my Treatise of Alms.

Pro. 10. 9. Psalm. 140. 11.
THE ninth Commandment is expressed in these words: Thou shall not bear, or
utter a false, or vain testimony against thy neighbor. Wherein is commanded,
that we should think and speak concerning our neighbors, both that which is
truth, and also that which is charitable, tendering his and our own credit and
good name; and avoiding all speech which is false and uncharitable, especially
such as tends to the reproach and diffamation of our selves and our
neighbors. And consequently, here is commanded the preservation of truth
amongst men, and of our own and neighbors fame and good name. Now this truth
is an agreement and conformity of our speech with our mind, and of our mind,
with the truth of the things themselves; the which in all our speech is
religiously to be observed, and all falsehood in speech to be avoided, whether
we speak that which is false, or the truth falsely, and with an intent to
deceive, whether it be in jest, or in earnest, either to help our neighbor
with an officious lie, or to hurt him with a pernicious lie. The manner how the
truth is to be professed, is first, that we do it freely and charitably,
simply and with discretion; avoiding in the excess, indiscreet and
unseasonable profession of the truth, to the unnecessary hurt or danger of our
selves or others; and in the defect, the denying or betraying of the truth, out
of fear or any sinister respect; as also a double and deceitful tongue. The
means of this truth are to be carefully used of us, which are, First, to know
it; to which end we must be lovers of it, and docible and teachable in learning
and conceiving of it, and not voluntarily affect ignorance, nor embrace untruth
out of vain credulity. Secondly, we must preserve and maintain it, using to
this end constancy and steadfastness in the truth, and shunning inconstancy
and pertinacie in error. Thirdly, profitable speech tending to Gods glory and
our neighbors good, both spiritual, as tending to his edification, and
temporal, serving for his honest delight and profit. Fourthly, that we use
the means of entertaining profitable speech, as affability and pleasing
communication, and the remedy against unprofitable speech, which is taciturnity
and seasonable silence. And contrariwise, we are to avoid all speech which is
either vain or hurtful, tending to Gods dishonor and our neighbors hurt; as
all rotten and infecting communication, scurrility, taunts and disgraces,
counterfeite complements, morosity, vain babbling, and smothering of
profitable truth by silence.

. Sect. 6 Of the preservation of our neighbors good name, and the means of
it, respecting our inward disposition.
Eccles. 7. 3. Pro. 22. 1.
The means of preserving our own and our neighbors fame and name, is to have
an inward disposition unto it, and an high esteem and great regard of it. And
secondly, an outward professsion of the truth concerning our neighbor, joined
with charity and discretion. The inward disposition is a true care of our own
and our neighbors fame and credit, with the fruits of it, whereby we tender
our own and their good name, out of true love and charity. The fruits of which
care are referred Romans 1. 8. Col. 1. 3, 4. Psalm. 15. 3.
either to the fame it self, as to rejoice in it, if it be good, and sorry,
if it be bad; or else to our hearing, judging and reporting of our neighbor.
In respect of hearing, we are not willingly to hear rumors Pro. 25. 23. and
17. 4. Exodus 23. 1. 1. Sam. 24. 10. 1. Cor. 13. 6. 1. Tim. 6. 4. 2. Sam. 10. 3,
4. Genesis 39. 19. 2. Sam. 16. 3, 4. 1. Sam. 1. 13. Act. 2. 13. Luke 7. 39. 1.
Cor. 1. 11. Act. 23. 16. Ier. 40. 14. Eccles. 19. 8.
and reports, tending to the infamy of our neighbors, but to repel
talebearers; and contrariwise, with all readiness to hear their praises and
commendations. In respect of judging, we are to be charitable; and to show it
by the fruits thereof, in not being suspicious, and in repressing the unjust
suspicions of others; in not believing, or determining any thing rashly against
our neighbor; and in interpreting good things well, and doubtful things in
the better part. In respect of reporting, we must report no ill of our
neighbor, though it be true, unless it be in charity, when as it is either
profitable for the party of whom we speak, that he may be reformed; or for
the party to whom we speak, for the prevention of danger intended, or
infection like to ensue by his company, or else necessary for our selves,
when as silence will make us guilty of his fault.

. Sect. 7 Other duties respecting our outward profession.
And these are the duties which respect our inward disposition: now of those
which concern our outward profession; in which respect, our Math. 26. 60. 61
Ioh. 2. 19. 1. Sam. 22. 9.
testimony of our neighbor, must be both true and charitable; and neither
false simply, nor in show of words true, but false in sense; neither yet
uncharitable and malicious; all which ought to be observed of us in all our
testimonies, both public and private, being ready in all things, and at all
times, to profess the truth concerning our neighbor, with charity, both in
respect of his virtues, which (as just occasion is offered) we ought to
acknowledge and commend, both in his presence and absence; and also his vices,
which we are to tell him of before his face, and not suffer sin to rest upon
Leuit. 19. 17. Pro. 27. 5. Psalm. 141. 5.
him; and not to make mention of them behind his back, but upon necessity, as
to those that may help to reform him, or to those who may be hurt or
corrupted by his company or example, that they Pro. 28. 4. and 24. 24. Pro. 27.
4. Act. 12. 22. Pro. 29. 5. Ier. 9. 8. Mat. 22. 16. 1. Cor. 6. 10. 1. Sam. 31.
4. John 19. 3. Matthew. 27. 42. Gal. 4. 29. Pro. 16. 28. and 26. 20. Leuit. 19.
16. Ezech. 22. 9. Romans 1. 30. Iam. 4. 11.
may, taking warning hereby, escape these dangers. And contrariwise we ought
to avoid flattery, wherein we may offend in respect of the matter of our
speech, as when we praise men for their vices; or the manner, in commending,
either fainedly or above measure; or the end, either seeking our own profit
like parasites, or the hurt of the party whom we flatter. And on the other
side we must shun evil and cursed speaking, which any ways tends to the
impayring of our neighbors credit and good name. The which is used either in
his presence, by reuiling and contumelious speaking; by deriding and scorning
him; or in his absence, by whispering or talebearing, slandering and backbiting.

. Sect. 8 Of the preserving our own good name.
The duties which every man is bound to perform unto himself, are, first, a
care to procure and preserve his good name and credit, and secondly, that he
give a true testimony of himself. Our care to procure and preserve our good
name, consists in using the means whereby it is gotten; as glorifying God,
seeking his kingdom and righteousness, walking uprightly, being such as we
would seem to be, and Phil. 4. 8. 1. Sam. 2. 30. Mat. 6. 33. Psalm. 112. 6.
Pro. 10. 7. Mat. 7. 1, 2. Psalm. 133. 1. Luke 14. 29, 30. Romans 12. 3. Eccle. 10.
1. 1. These. 5. 22. Romans 12. 17. 2. Sam. 12. 12. 1. King. 2. 8, 9.
in keeping a good conscience. And also in avoiding the means, both of
vainglory; as seeking to please men more then God; hypocrisy, seeking
commendation by vanity and vices, loving of flatterers; usual censuring of
others, attempting matters above our ability and gifts. And also of infamy,
which either arise from our selves, as all sins both open, with all
apparances of them, and secret, which God to our shame will bring to light; or
else from others, as all disgraceful lies, slanders, and opprobrious speeches,
against which we ought (especially if we be public persons) to defend and
maintain our credit and good name. The true testimony of our selves is either
concerning good; which if it be true, we must upon just occasion confess it
with modesty to Gods glory; or if false, with modesty and 1. Cor. 15. 10.
Pro. 28. 13. 1 Ioh. 1. 9. Josh. 7. 19. John 1. 10. Iam. 5. 15. Psalm. 51.
humility to deny it; or else concerning evil, which if it be true, we must
confess it both to God with earnest desire of forgiveness, and also to man,
when by our confession we may advance Gods glory, and either our own or our
neighbors good; or if it be false, that we constantly deny it. Contrariwise
we are by this Commandment bound to shun the contrary vices to these virtues;
as to deny the good things in us to Gods dishonor that gave them, and to
speak more basely and meanly of our own gifts and good parts then there is
cause, or then that which we truly conceive, either to avoid boasting, which
is no better then a modest lie; or to draw commendations Psalm. 52. 1. Phil. 3.
19. Genesis 4. 23, 24.
from others, which is counterfaite modesty, and a cunning kind of arrogance.
And also on the other side, vain and false boasting, wherein we may offend,
either in respect of the object, in boasting of that which is not good, but
evil, or being good, is not in us at all, or at least in that measure which
we assume unto our selves. Or else in respect of the end, as when we speak
of the good things in us, or done by us, for our own glory, especially when it
is joined Mat. 26. 33, 35. 1. Cor. 4. 7. Esa. 10. 15. Luke 18. 10. Act. 8. 9.
Genesis 18. 15. 2. Sam. 1. 10. compared with 1. Sam. 31. 4, 5.
with neglect of Gods honor, or the disgrace of others, or else for our gain
and advantage. Or finally in respect of evil, when out of pride and
self-love, we deny that evil which is truly affirmed, or affirm that evil
of our selves which is false, to gratify others, or to pick a thank.

. Sect. 9 What is required in this Commandment, to wit, original
righteousness, and spiritual Concupiscence.
IN the former Commandments, as we have showed, the Lord forbids all
external sins both in word and deed, together with Romans 7. 7. and 13. 9.
and 1. 24. Col. 3. 5. 1. Pet. 4. 2, 2. and 2. 11. and 23. 3. Gal 5. 16. 17.
the internal sins of the heart committed against our neighbors, which are
joined with consent of the will, and commands the contrary virtues: and now
in the tenth and last Commandment, that he might show his Law to be
spiritual, and of such large extent, that nothing, no not the least motions or
first thoughts are exempted, and out of the reach of it, he requires the
inward purity of the mind and imaginations, thoughts and intentions, heart and
affections; and the rectitude, orderly and just government of them all for our
own and our neighbors good: and contrariwise condemns and forbids, not
only those gross kinds of concupiscence and lusts of the flesh, Romans 7. 7.
and 13. 9. and 1. 24. Col. 3. 5. 1. Pet. 4. 2, 2. and 2. 11. and 2. 3. 3. Gal.
5. 16. 17.
which are joined with consent of will, but even the first and least motions of
evil concupiscence, which go before consent, which are the roots, seeds,
and fountains of all other sins, as all evil thoughts, inclinations and
desires which are repugnant with charity; yet thought of most, to be no sins,
and free from the censure of law, the which the Papists do stiffly defend,
making this concupiscence and lust after baptism to be no sin. Now this
purity of mind and heart here required, consists of two parts, original
righteousness, and perfect love of our neighbors and our selves, and the
concupiscence of the Spirit. Original righteousness, is both a cleanenesse
from all unrighteousness, and evil concupiscence against our neighbors, and
a disposition and pronenesse to all the duties of charity; the which
righteousness, the Lord having in our first creation planted in our natures,
does justly require it of us in his Law, though by our fall in the loins of
our first parents we have lost it, and can never attain unto it in any
perfection. Yea, he does it not only in justice toward all, but also in mercy
toward his elect, to this end, that seeing hereby their unrighteousness,
corruption and misery in themselves, they might be forced to renounce
themselves and their own righteousness, and flee unto Christ, that both they
might be clothed with his righteousness, and by his Spirit be renewed
according to his Image, Ephe. 4. 22, 23, 24. Luke 1. 74, 75. Tit. 2. 12, 13.
Romans 8. 6, 7. and 7. 8, 23. Gal. 5. 17. 1. Tim. 6. 9. 1. Pet. 2. 11.
in wisdom, holiness and righteousness. Contrariwise, here is forbidden evil
concupiscence, which is either original concupiscence, or sin, as it is
referred against our neighbors; the which is that habitual corruption of our
natures, and that evil inclination and pronenesse to lust against our
neighbors, contrary to the Law of God: or actual concupiscences, which are
evil motions in our minds and hearts against our neighbors, both hurtful
and foolish; which motions are either evil fantasies and thoughts of the
mind, or evil affections and perturbations of the heart; 1. Cor. 13. 5.
all which inclining men to evil, are repugnant to charity.

. Sect. 10 Of the Spirit lusting against the flesh.
The spiritual concupiscence here required contains the good motions of the
Spirit, and the lusting of the Spirit against the flesh. The good motions of
the Spirit, are righteous and charitable cogitations in our minds concerning
our neighbors, and like affections in our hearts toward them, which are to be
embraced and nourished in us; and contrariwise, evil thoughts are to be
shunned, which either are cast into men's minds by the devil, and are called
his suggestions; or arise from original corruption and habitual
concupiscence; and both of them either sleeping or waking. The lusting of the
Spirit against the flesh, whereby we Gal. 5. 17, 24.
fight against our corruptions, and crucify the flesh with the lusts thereof,
is here also commanded, and to be entertained and embraced of us. Of which I
have written more fully in another The fourth part of Christian warfare.
Treatise.

. Sect. 11 Of the means inabling us unto the obedience of this Commandment.
The means whereby we may be enabled to yield obedience to this Commandment,
are of two sorts, first, such as tend to the attayning and preserving of the
pureness of the heart, which are, First, to walk with God, seeking to approve
our hearts unto him, who searches and tries as well our secret thoughts and
inclinations, as our outward words and actions. Secondly, to observe and watch
over our hearts and senses, that no evil concupiscence do arise in us, or
enter into us, or if they do arise, or be suggested, that we do not admit
them, or forthwith extinguish and quench them. Secondly, to watch over our
selves, that no evil concupiscence do arise in us, or enter into us, to which
end a twofold care is needful, 1. When we are awake, to keep our minds
occupied in good and holy meditations, and exercised about lawful things, not
suffering them to be idle, or to wander about things vain and unlawful. 2. When
we are to sleep, that we commend our souls into the hands of God, desiring
him to keep them safe from tentations, and pure from concupiscences. Thirdly,
to observe and guard our senses (especially our sight) by whose ministry Genesis
3. 6. Josh. 7. 21. Job 31. 1. Psalm. 119. 37. Ephesians. 6. 12. 2. Cor. 10. 5.
the objects of concupiscence are represented to the mind. Fourthly, that we
put on, and keep fast buckled unto us the whole spiritual Armor of God,
which is mighty to cast down imaginations, and to subdue evil thoughts. And
finally, that we frequently use fervent and effectual prayer unto almighty
God, that he will assist and govern us with his holy Spirit, against all
tentations and suggestions of the devil, the world, and our own flesh.

THE THIRD BOOK OF A GODLY LIFE, CONTAINING IN IT THOSE DVties which are
required in our daily exercise, both generally at all times of the day, and
upon all occasions, and specially in the several parts of it.
CAP. I.
That the duties of a godly life ought daily and constantly to be performed,
and not by fits and spurts only.

. Sect. 1 That the duties contained in the former Book, are to be performed
daily and constantly upon every fit occasion.
AND thus have we entreated of the duties which are to be performed of all
those who desire to lead a godly and Christian life. Now we are to show how
all these duties of piety, righteousness, and sobriety, are to be daily and
continually exercised of us, so far forth as our callings and occasions,
means and opportunity will suffer and enable us. Neither is it possible that
all these duties should be performed by every man, seeing diverse of them are
appropriate to diverse persons, sexes, and callings; in which respect, the
subject is not tied to perform the duties of the Prince, nor the Prince of the
subject; the husband of the wife, nor the wife of the husband, etc. nor yet
that all duties, common to all Christians, should be performed every day,
seeing many times we want fit objects to exercise them upon, as also convenient
time and leisure, ability and opportunity. But this is required of us, that at
no time we commit any thing against the holy Law of God, or think that any
time, company, or other circumstance, can make sin seasonable; nor yet omit
any of the former duties, when God requires them at our hands, giving us fit
objects, occasions, means, and ability to perform them: And that not only
some spare time be allotted to these Christian duties, taking liberty to spend
the remainder of our days after our own sinful lusts, or in the unlawful
and base service of the world, and the prince thereof, for the worthless hire
of earthly vanities; but we must be wholly taken up of them, and be still
exercised in the practice of some one or other of them, as shall be most
convenient, and will best sort with the advancing of the glory of God, and the
spiritual and temporal good of our selves and our neighbors, in respect of
means and occasions offered unto us. Neither must we think it sufficient unto
a godly life to reserve his Sabbaths for Gods service, and spend the rest of
the week in the service of the world and our own lusts; nor that we serve him
in some things, and these in others; nor on some other days besides the
Sabbath, or some part only of every day, reserving the rest to live as we
list. But we must constantly and continually, in every thing, and at every
time, perform service unto God in all our actions, and throughout our whole
course and conversation; not only in abstaining from all sin which he has
forbidden, but also in performing of some Christian duty of holiness,
righteousness, and sobriety, which he has commanded, or in using the means
whereby we may be enabled unto them. Neither is God alone served, when we
perform some religious act, as praying, hearing the Word, singing Psalms, or
some eminent works of charity and sobriety, but also in the meanest duties of
the basest calling, yea even in our eating and drinking, lawful sports and
recreations, when as we do them in faith, which not only assures us that
these actions are commanded 1. Cor. 10. 31.
of God and warranted by his Word, but that we and our works are accepted of
him; and so inableth us to do them with cheerfulness and delight, as being
not chiefly the service of men but of God. And also when in doing these our
ordinary businesses which belong to our callings, we do repose our trust and
affiance in God, that he will bless us in them, and give them such success,
as shall be most for his glory and our good; and enjoy the fruit and benefit of
them, as blessings sent from God with praise and thanksgiving. And when as in
them we have an eye and due respect to God, seeking in them chiefly his glory,
and doing them in love and obedience to his Commandments; and not for
necessity only, praise or profit, fear of punishment, or hope of reward, which
though we may respect secondarily and in some degree, in the ordinary actions
of our lives, yet not first and principally, if we would be accounted to do
God service in them. And in the next place, to our own and our neighbors
mutual good, especially the enriching of us with spiritual graces, and the
everlasting salvation of their and our own souls.

. Sect. 2 That no time is exempted from Gods service, proved first by
testimonies of Scripture.
In which general sense if we take the service of God, and thus largely with
these references, understand the Christian duties of a godly life, then is
there no day, hour, or minute, wherein we are not to be exercised in some of
them. And this appears both by testimonies of Scriptures and firm reasons.
The Scriptures require that our whole lives be spent in the service of God, and
that we daily perform unto him the duties of holiness, righteousness, and
sobriety. So the Apostle would have us to walk daily, according as God has
directed us, and make his Word the rule of our conversation, from which we must
never swerve, neither on the right Gal. 6. 16. Psalm. 119. 9. Ios. 1. 7.
hand nor on the left; and to keep a continual watch over our selves, lest
there be at any time in any of us an evil heart of unbelief, in departing
from the Deuteronomy. 5. 32. Heb. 3. 12, 13.
living God; and to exhort one another daily, whilst it is called to day, lest
any of us should be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. The Apostle
Peter persuades us to pass the whole time of our soiourning here in the 1.
Pet. 1. 17. Pro. 28. 14.
fear of God, and not some part of it only, which we can best spare, and that
we live no longer, the rest of our time in the flesh, according to the lusts of
1. Pet. 4. 2.
men, but the will of God, seeing the time past of our lives may be enough, yea
far too much, to have walked and wrought after the will of the Gentiles. The
Tit. 2. 11, 12.
grace of God appearing, has taught us to deny all ungodliness and worldly
lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly, whilst we continue in
this present world. And therefore has the Lord redeemed us, that being
delivered out Luke 1. 74, 75.
of the hands of our enemies, we might serve him without fear, in holiness
and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. Of which, we have
also examples in the Scriptures, in the Saints and servants of God, who after
their conversion, passed their whole time in his fear, and spent their
strength, in doing unto him continual service. So Enoch is said to have walked
Genesis 5. 22.
with God, that is, in the whole course of his pilgrimage to have kept him in
his sight, and to have carried himself in all his actions as in his presence,
that he might be accepted of him. And David, as he makes it a mark of a
blessed man, to meditate and exercise himself in the Law of Psalm. 1. 1, 2.
God day and night, so does he in many places show that it was his own
practice. My mouth (says he) shall show forth thy righteousness and thy
Psalm. 71. 15. Psalm. 55. 17. Psa. 119. 97, 11^. and 145. 2. Act. 26. 7. and 2.
46.
salvation all the day, for I know not the numbers thereof. Evening, and
morning, and at noone, will I pray and cry aloud. O how love I thy Law! it is
my meditation all the day. I have inclined my heart to perform thy Statutes
always, even unto the end. Every day will I bless thee, and will praise thy
name for ever and ever. So the Apostle says of the whole Church of the Jews,
that they did instantly serve God day night: and particularly of himself, that
it was Act. 24. 16.
his continual exercise to have always a good conscience, void of offense
toward God and toward men. But the best president of all for our imitation,
is our Savior Christ, who spent his whole time in doing the works of him that
sent him, in the day time preaching and doing miracles and works of mercy,
that he might bring salvation unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and
in the night sequestring himself for prayer and meditation in the mount of
Olives. Secondly, God has given his Law, not that we should sometimes observe
his Commandments, and sometimes break them, but that we might observe them
daily and continually, in all things and at all times; and that it might serve
as a rule and squire, according unto Psalm. 119. 9.
which we are to frame our whole lives, and every particular action. For there
he prescribes duties to be performed at all times; on his Sabbath, and on the
six days besides, the general duties which belong to all, and those that
respect us in our particular callings; the duties of piety, whereby we offer
unto him immediate service; and of righteousness and sobriety, whereby we
serve him mediately, in doing the duties which he has commanded toward our
neighbors and our selves, because in doing them, we obey him. Whereby it
appears, that there ought to be no time nor any action of our lives exempted
from Gods service, seeing he has given us his Law, to serve for our direction
at all times and in all things. Finally, the Word of God gives unto us
directions and rules, according to which we are to frame our whole lives, both
in respect of persons and callings, as the duties of superiors and inferiors,
fathers and Ios. 1. 8. 1. Tim. 2. 1.
children, magistrates and people, domestical and political, toward God,
themselves, and one another; and also in respect of every part of the day, for
the well beginning, continuing, and ending of it, and of all states and
conditions, whether we be merry and cheerful, or sad and sorrowful, in
sickness or in health, in poor or rich estate, prosperity or adversity; to
Iam. 5. 13. 1. These. 5. 16, 17, 18. 1. Cor. 10. 31. Iam. 1. 15. Luke 9. 23.
Deuteronomy. 4. 30. Psalm. 50. 15.
show unto us that there is no time or state, wherein any man is left to his
own liberty to live as he list, but that continually and in all conditions,
every man is bound to conform his life in every particular action, according
to Gods revealed will. To which end, we are enjoined at all times to meditate
and speak of Gods Law and Commandments, to have them in our hearts, to teach
them unto our children, at home and abroad, at our lying down, and at our
rising up, and to bind them for a sign upon our Deuteronomy. 6. 8.
hands, and as frontlets between our eyes. And so the Wiseman commands, that
we bind them continually upon our hearts, and tie them about Pro. 6. 21, 22.
our necks; because when we go, it shall lead us, when we sleep, it shall
keep us, and when we awake, it shall talk with us; the Law being such a lamp
and light, as is sufficient to guide and direct us in all our ways. Psalm. 119.
105.


. Sect. 3 Diverse reasons proouing the necessity of the daily exercise of a
godly life.
Secondly, this daily practice of all Christian duties, in the whole course of
our lives, and in every particular action of them, may be enforced with these
reasons; first, because the Lord has created and redeemed, and does
continually preserve us to this end, that we should spend our whole lives in
his service, by performing the duties of holiness and righteousness; and not
some part only, reserving the rest for the service of the world, and the
satisfying of our carnal lusts. Secondly, he gives unto us the continual
wages of his blessings and benefits for the present, and has promised to give
unto us the everlasting reward of heavenly happiness in the life to come, not
that we should do our own wills and works, much less of his professed
enemies, but that we approve our selves and our service unto him in all
things, who has given unto us this rich wages; and chiefly respect his glory
in whatsoever we do, either in his immediate service, or in performing the
duties which he has commanded us toward our neighbors and our own persons;
seeing we are bought at an high 1. Cor. 6. 20. Romans 12. 1.
price, that we might no longer be our own, but his, and glorify him both in
our souls and body, by offering unto him that service which he requires.
Thirdly, seeing it is the best wisdom to employ all and every of our actions
to the best purpose, and no time is so well employed as in Gods service,
whether we respect God our chief Goodness, to whose glory all Matthew. 5. 16.
2. Pet. 1. 10.
should tend, as unto their supreme end, or our own salvation, which by this
and no other means can be assured unto us; and contrariwise, the greatest
folly to spend our lives or any part of them in vain, to no purpose or profit,
as all that time is, which is not taken up in Gods service, by performing some
duty of piety, righteousness, or sobriety, seeing those maine ends, at which
we ought in all things to aim, namely, Gods glory in our own salvation, are
not hereby advanced and furthered, but crossed and hindered. Fourthly, to be
daily exercised in Christian duties, is the best means to keep our souls in
good plight and state, by nourishing in them all saving graces; for as it is
not enough to keep our bodies in a good case and habitude, that we preserve
the vigor and strength of them, by seasonable and convenient food, unless
we also digest it, and confirm our strength by fit exercise; so for the
preserving of our souls in good state, it is not sufficient that we nourish
Gods graces in us, by hearing the Word, and feeding on this spiritual Manna,
unless we daily exercise them in the performance of all Christian duties. And
as it is the best means to preserve our souls in health, when they are well,
so also to recover them, when through surfets in sin, it declineth and is
impaired; whereas if we have only some general purposes of living
Christianly, or perform these duties but by fits and starts; we shall easily
fall into spiritual consumptions of grace, and dangerous sicknesses of sin
before we be aware, and when they have by neglect and customable continuing in
them taken fast hold of us, we shall either not recover, or at least, with
great difficulty.

. Sect. 4 The many and great dangers which follow the neglect of this daily
exercise.
Fifthly, we may be moved to this daily and continual exercise, by
consideration of the many and great dangers which do accompany the neglect of
it; first, because we shall move the Lord to withdraw from us his graces, when
as we are secure and slothful in the exercise of them. For he gives unto us
these spiritual Talents, not that we should wastefully misspend them, or
idly tie them up (as it were) in a napkin, and cast them in a corner, where
they do no good; but that we should by employing, improoue them to the glory
of our Master, and good of our selves and our fellow-seruants; which when we
neglect to do, he will take them from us, and give them unto others, who will
use them to more purpose and profit. And thus David growing secure, and
beginning through sloth to 2. Sam. 11. 2.
remit something of his spiritual exercises, in which he had been formerly
zealous, was left unto himself to fall into tentation, God withdrawing the
assistance of his grace and holy Spirit, and so was overtaken of foul and
gross sins. Secondly, without this daily exercise we shall soon fall off
from all power of godliness, and grow by degrees from bad to worse, till there
be no prints of goodness remaining in us. For our course and proceedings in
piety is no natural motion, but against the current and stream, wind and
tide of our corruption; and therefore we must at no time intermit our labor,
for so we shall in short time be carried further back, then we can recover in
a great space and with much labor; but we must be in continual exercise, and
(as it were) with unwearied diligence ply the oar, until by death we arrive
at the haven of happiness. Our hearts, like the plummets of a clock, draw us
with the weight of their corruption downward, till they pitch themselves and
rest upon earthly vanities, unless every day, yea many times a day, we pull
them up, and give spiritual motion unto them by these Christian exercises.
Thirdly, sin is so wily and deceitful, that if we cease from the duties of a
Christian life, and intermit the keeping of a straight watch over our selves
and actions, it will soon steal upon us, and fortify it self against all
virtue and goodness. For though at the first it seems content, that we
should but for a little space displace good duties, and give but a little way
for a small while to the pleasures of it, yet it will increase in strength,
coming to live (as it were) in its old home and proper element, and hardly
leave its hold, or give way to the re-entry of those virtues and Christian
duties which it formerly expelled. In which regard we shall be blessed, if
fearing Pro. 28. 14.
always, we stand continually upon our watch, and not only keep our Matthew.
26. 41. 2. Tim. 4. 5. Heb. 3. 13.
souls strongly manned with saving graces, but take care that they may be
daily trained and exercised in all Christian duties, that so we may not be
beguiled and hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. Lastly, there is no
less danger from outward enemies, the world and the devil, if we neglect the
daily exercise of a godly life. For the world, if it once find our hearts
Dina-like, straying from God, will easily ravish and defile them with her
filthy pleasures; and when we have been at some time enticed to accompany her
favorites in the delights of sin, we shall hardly get out of their
imbracements, nor purge our selves from that pollution Job 1. 7.
wherewith they have tainted us. The devil also like a malicious enemy 1. Pet.
5 8.
walks about continually, and as a roaring Lion seeks to devour us; and if
he find us at any time clean swept of Gods graces, and garnished Matthew. 12.
44.
with the hellish ornaments of vices and sin, he will enter into us, and
taking possession, reserve us for his own use. And therefore it behooves us
with like diligence to prevent his wiles and malice, by keeping our souls
continually furnished with Gods graces, and our selves exercised in all
Christian duties, that so we may never be at leisure to admit of his
tentations. And seeing this evil one is ready, even whilst we sleep, to sow
his tares of tentations in our hearts (a ground too fruitful for such a
grain) Matthew. 13. 25.
our care must be with like diligence, to cast out this hellish seed, that it
take no rooting, or if it have, to weed them out as soon as they have
sprouted up, and do outwardly appear in our words or actions.

. Sect. 5 Another reason taken from our calling and profession.
The sixth reason to move us to this daily exercise, is taken from our calling
and profession; for we are Citizens of heaven, and pilgrims on Phil. 3. 20.
Col. 3. 2.
earth, and therefore though our bodies are here beneath, yet our conversation
should be in heaven, and our minds and affections should be on things above;
our speeches should be of those things that concern our own country, and in
all our actions we must endeavor to further our journey toward our heavenly
home; neither must we one while go forward, and another while backward, or
idly sit still; we must not one part of the day go in the right way, and in
another part err and wander in the by-ways of sin, but we must be still
going forward and holding the right road, never turning out of it, till we
come to our heavenly home. We are called to be Gods servants, and therefore we
must not divide our service between him and the world, seeing it is fit we
do only his work from whom we receive so liberal wages; neither can we
serve God and Mammon which are of so contrary a disposition: but whilst we
incline to the Mat. 6. ^4.
one, we must of necessity neglect the other, as our Savior has taught us. We
are called to be his Soldiers, and therefore we must only fight his battles,
and not spend some part of our life and strength in his service, and some part
in fighting on the devils side, by quenching the good motions of Gods Spirit,
and contrary to the light of our own knowledge and consciences, neglect holy
duties, and run on in such courses as are displeasing unto God. We are called
to be Gods laborers; and therefore we must intend our business, that it may
prosper in our hand, and not undo in one day, that which we have done in
another. We must not, like unskillful husbandmen, sometimes plant, and soon
after pluck them up, one while sow good seed, and another while tares; nor
like foolish builders, pull down one day, what we have set up in another; nor
like unfaithful Watchmen, one while sit in the watch Tower, and soon after
slothfully sleep, and give over our charge; nor like careless Pilots, guide
the ship one day toward the wished haven, and the next, through sloth and
negligence, let it roame whither the wind and tide will carry it, till it run
upon the sands, and split it self against the rocks: But we must in the whole
and daily course of our lives, give all diligence to make our calling and
election sure, by holding 2. Pet. 1. 10.
a constant and continual course, in the Christian exercises of a godly life.

. Sect. 6 The last reason taken from the uncertainty of our lives.
The last reason to move us unto the continual and daily exercise of
Christian duties, is taken from the uncertainty of our lives, and Mat. 24. 46.
when by death we shall be called to Judgment; For seeing we know not at
what time our Master will come, it shall be our wisdom to keep our accounts
always even, that we may be ready at all times without fear, to yield up our
reckonings; and to carry our selves continually, like wise and faithful
servants, in the exercise of holy, righteous, and Christian duties, that so we
may be blessed, when our Lord coming upon the sudden, shall find us so
doing: and because we are uncertain when the Bridegroom will come; let us,
like the five wise Virgins, Mat. 25. 1, 2.
have our lamps and oil of faith, and lights of a godly life always
prepared, that so we may enter with him into the marriage Chamber of heavenly
happiness, and there eternally solace our selves in the fruition of his love;
lest coming upon the sudden, in an hour that we think not, Mat. 24. 44.
and taking us unprovided, without the lamp of profession, or the oil of
grace, or the light of an holy conversation; either hunting after worldly
profits and preferments by unlawful means, or with immoderate desires, or
wallowing our selves in fleshly delights, he shut us out of doors, and utterly
exclude us from having any communion, or interest with him in those heavenly
joys.

CAP. II.
Of some special duties of a godly life, which are to be performed in our
daily exercise: And first, of the renewing of our repentance.

. Sect. 1 Of the daily renewing of our covenant with God, by the renewing of
our faith and repentance.
BY the testimonies and reasons before alleged, we have made it evident, that
it is not sufficient to serve God by fits and at sometimes, neglecting his
service, and serving the world and our own lusts at another; but that the
daily exercise of a godly life, in the continual performance of all Christian
duties, is most profitable and necessary. And now it remains that we give
some directions, for the well-performing of this daily exercise. To which end,
we are to know that these duties, wherein we are daily to be exercised, are
of two sorts. First, general, which are not only every day necessarily to be
in some degree and measure performed, but also to be observed in every part of
the day, and in all the particular acts and exercises of it, as occasion
serves. The second more special, and belonging more principally and properly
unto the diverse parts and several occasions of every day. The former are more
internal and spiritual between God and us, serving to set our hearts in due
frame, and to make them constant and resolute to consecrate our selves wholly
to Gods service, and in all things to please him. The latter more external for
the most part, and visible, which are the outward exercises proceeding from the
other, and (as it were) the pleasant fruits which spring from those inward and
hidden roots. The first main duty, which ought to be of every Christian daily
and duly performed, is to confirm, and in some sort to renew the Covenant of
grace between God and us in Jesus Christ, wherein God for his part does of his
free grace promise the remission of all our sins, his spiritual graces, his
favor and reconciliation, justification and adoption, his holy Spirit with all
spiritual and temporal gifts and graces in this world, and everlasting life
and salvation in the world to come, in and for his Son Christ. And we for our
part do promise and covenant, that we will receive and embrace Christ with all
these benefits by a lively faith, and bring forth the fruits thereof in hearty
repentance and new obedience. The which Covenant, is the maine ground and
foundation of all the good things we receive from God in this life, and of all
the joy and comfort which we take in them; and of our future hopes and
happiness in the life to come. And therefore as Citizens do chiefly look to
the preservation and establishment of the grand Charter, that contains all
their privileges: And as Soldiers in time of a siege, do every day look
unto their main fortifications and bulwarks, and if they be any way shattered
and shaken in the last assaults, do with all care and diligence repair and
strengthen them: So must we who profess our selves Citizens of the spiritual
Sion and heavenly Jerusalem, use all good means to ratify this Charter, which
is the chief assurance of all the good which we either now can have, or
hereafter expect; and seeing in the time of our spiritual warfare, Satan with
his assistants seek to shake and weaken this chief Tower of our strength,
with the engines and Canon shot of their tentations; therefore we must daily
have a special eye to this our principal Bulwark, and use continually all
good means, whereby the breaches may be repaired and strengthened against the
next assault. And howsoever we are after a more principal manner to renew and
confirm our Covenant with God at set and solemn times, as generally before
we come to the Lords Table, and specially in the time of thanksgiving, for
some singular and extraordinary benefits, or of extraordinary humiliation in
respect of some sins, into which, after our conversion we have relapsed; or
some grievous afflictions, from which we desire to be delivered; or some
dangerous sickness, the usual forerunner of death and Judgment, as we
shall more fully show hereafter: yet seeing we must daily and hourly live by
faith; and seeing faith has no other ground to rest upon, for the applying and
appropriating of any of Gods benefits, but the Covenant of grace which he has
made with us, the which, though on Gods part it be more immooueable then the
rocks Esa. 54. 10.
and mountains, yet is often shaken in respect of our weak apprehension, even
as a rock may seem to move, when it is lightly touched with a trembling
hand, and a mountain to shake, when as it is beheld with a weak and quiuering
eye; who sees not how necessary it is to use daily all good means, whereby
we may make this covenant which is so strong in it self, to be also strong
unto us, and a firm foundation whereupon we may build our joy and comfort?

. Sect. 2 Of the daily renewing of our repentance. First, by recalling our
sins to remembrance; And secondly, by humbling our selves before God in the
sight and sense of them.
Now the principal means of renewing and confirming this covenant of grace,
is, daily to renew the condition on our part, which is a lively faith, approved
by the fruits of it in unfeigned repentance. The which latter, because it is the
infallible sign and touch stone of the former, and the outward and sensible
fruit, which assures us of the hidden root, that it lives and grows, I
will in the first place speak of our daily exercise in renewing of our
repentance; unto which is required, first, that we call to our remembrance our
former sins, together with the cursed root of original corruption from
which they spring; but especially the sins, frailties and falls, which have
overtaken us since the last time that we performed this exercise, to which
purpose it behooves us to keep a strict and narrow watch over all our
thoughts, words and works, that these spiritual enemies of our souls may not
slily pass by, or secretly lurk in us unespied, and consequently unrepented
of; and also to take special mark of them, that they do not slip out of our
mind and memory. For which end we must look our selves often in the glass of
Gods Law, and examine our lives by this rule, that so we may take notice of our
spiritual spots and deformities, of our errors and auersenes to good, and
pronenesse to evil, and so bring them into the Court of conscience, that being
thereby, in the presence of God our supreme Judge, accused and condemned, our
hearts may be smitten with godly sorrow in the sight and sense of them, and
affected with a loathing and mislike of our former evil proceedings; according
to the practice of the faithful, foretold by the Prophet: Then Ezech. 36. 31.
shall ye (says he) remember your former evil ways, and your doings that
were not good, and shall loath your selves in your own sight, for your
iniquities, and for your abominations. The neglect of which duty is reproved
and condemned in the people of the Jews: I hearkened and heard, but they spoke
not aright, Ier. 8. 6.
no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one
turned to his course, as the Horse rusheth into the battle. Secondly,
Humiliation is here also required, in which, diverse things ought to concur;
first, when we have called our sins to our remembrance, and set them in order
before us, we must in the sight and sense of them have melting, relenting,
broken, and contrite hearts and spirits, which will truly mourn with bitter
grief, because by our sins we have displeased so gracious and good a God,
who has multiplied upon us so innumerable benefits and blessings, both in
temporal and spiritual things, especially in giving his only Son to the
death for us, when as we were strangers and enemies unto him. Upon which
consideration we must, looking upon him whom we Zach. 10. 12.
have pierced, mourn for him, as a man mourns for his only son, and be in
bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first borne. We must
not slight over our sorrow, but labor with Peter to weep bitterly, and Mat.
26 75. 1. Sam. 7. 6.
with the Israelites, to power forth our melting souls before God, like water
drawn out of a well; and finally, with David we must labor to bring our
mourning for sin into daily practice; Every night (says he) Psalm. 6. 6.
Lam. 2. 18, 19.
make I my bed to swim, and I water my couch with my tears. And if through
the hardness of our hearts, we cannot thus sorrow for our sins, we must be
grieved, because we can be no more grieved, and lament the hardness of our
hearts, because we can no more heartily bewail them. Which if it be unfeigned,
then will it move us to use carefully the means whereby our grief for sin
may be increased; as to meditate on the innumerable multitude, and the
grievous heinousness of our sins, the manifold imperfections and corruptions
of our best actions, the majesty, power and greatness, the infinite goodness
and graciousnesse of God toward us, against whom we have committed them, our
own baseness and vileness, who have provoked to wrath so infinite a majesty,
the small and contemptible inducements which have allured and enticed us to
offend so merciful a Father, even the base baits of worldly vanities; our
continuing in these sins without repentance, notwithstanding that the Lord
has given us so manifold and effectual means of reformation and amendment,
as the preaching of the Gospel, admonitions, instructions, reprehensions, the
good motions of his Spirit checking us for our sins, and inciting us to holy
duties; his promises alluring us to serve him; his threatenings terrifying us
that we may not offend him; his mercies and benefits encouraging us to all
good; his chastisements and fatherly corrections discouraging and stopping us
in our evil courses: notwithstanding all which helps and means, we have
impenitently continued in our sins, without any reformation; our dishonouring
of God hereby, who has been so gracious and bountiful unto us, and abusing
of his mercies, patience and long suffering, which should have led us to Romans
2. 5.
repentance; our pearcings, wounding, and as it were, crucifying afresh the
Lord of life, our blessed Savior and Redeemer; and our vexing and greeuing of
the good Spirit of God, whereby we are sanctified; by Ephe. 4. 30. 1. These. 5.
19.
quenching the good motions which he has suggested unto us, and by dulling and
deadding his gifts and graces in us. Secondly, we must be much displeased with
our selves, because we have so many ways displeased God by our sins, and be
inflamed with a godly anger against our flesh and sinful lusts, which have
caused us to break out into al these impieties, the which must show it self
in our readiness to be revenged of them, by using all good means whereby they
may be mortified and crucified. Thirdly, we must have our hearts affected with
confusion and astonishment, and our faces filled and discolored with shame and
blushing, that we have thus many ways showed our selves so unkind and
ungrateful to so good a God; and when we see that God remembers his covenant,
to establish and make it good to such unworthy wretches, we, with the Church of
the Jews, repenting of our sins, must remember our former Ezech. 16. 61.
Ier. 6. 15.
wicked ways, and be ashamed and confounded, in the fight and sense of our
unworthiness. Finally, we must in the former considerations cast away all
pride, carnal love and selfe-conceitednesse of our own worth and excellency,
and be humbled and cast down in the apprehension and feeling of our own
baseness and vileness; confessing that we are but dust and ashes; Genesis 18.
27. Psalm. 22. 6. Job 17. 41. Job 42. 6. Psalm. 51. 17.
with David, that we are worms, and no men; and saying with Job unto
corruption, Thou art my father, and to the worm, Thou art my mother and my
sister; yea with him, we must abhor our selves, and unfeignedly repent in dust
and ashes. The fruits of which humiliation we shall find inestimable. For we
shall hereby offer unto God a sacrifice which he most delights in, and make
him hereby propitious and gracious; yea to dwell with us, and to replenish and
cheer our hearts with our sweet communion and fellowship with him in the
gracious comforts of his holy Spirit, according to that of the Psalmist, The
Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saves Psalm. 34. 18.
such as be of a contrite Spirit; And the Lords own speech by his Prophet,
Thus says the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy;
Esa. 57. 15. and 6. 2.
I dwell in the high and holy place; with him also that is of a contrite and
humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and the heart of contrite
ones. We shall bring our selves within the compass of Christ's call, and
interesse our selves unto his gracious promises of easing us of the
unsupportable burden of our sins, and curing us of all our spiritual
sicknesses and sores of sins: for he came to be the Physician, not of the
whole, but of the Mat. 11. 28. and 9. 13.
sick, and to call, not those who have no sense and feeling of their sins,
but such as labor and are heavy laden, not the righteous in their own
opinion and conceit, but sinners to repentance. We shall make our selves fit
hearers of the glad tidings of the Gospel, and entitle our selves to all the
gracious comforts of Gods holy Spirit, according to that of the Prophet, cited
and applied by our Savior; The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he Esa.
61. 1, 2, 3: Luke 4. 18.
has anointed me: to preach the Gospel to the poor and meek, he has sent
me to bind up and heal the brokenhearted, to preach liberty and deliverance
to captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
are bruized, to comfort them that mourn; giving unto them beauty for ashes,
and the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise, for the spirit of
heaviness. Moreover, by this humiliation we may come to the assurance of the
remission of our sins; for if we humble our selves and pray, seek Gods 2.
Chro. 7. 14.
face and turn from our wicked ways; then will the Lord hear from heaven,
and will forgive us our sins, and heal our plagues; as we see in the
example of Manasses, one of the greatest sinners that ever lived, who humbling
himself greatly before the God of his Father, and seeking 2. Chro. 33. 12.
and suing unto him for pardon, the Lord was entreated of him, and heard his
supplication. Finally, if we thus daily humble our selves, the Lord has
promised to lift us up and exalt us, to furnish us with all Jam. 4. 6. 1. Pet.
5. 5, 6. Luke 1. 53. Matthew. 5. 3, 4.
saving graces, to fill and replenish our empty souls with all good things,
to cheer us in our mourning with the comforts of his Spirit, and to make us
blessed in the eternal fruition of his heavenly Kingdom.

. Sect. 5 Of the daily confession of our sins, and judging our selves for them
Thirdly, unto this daily renewing of our repentance, is required an humble
confession of our sins, which must be of unknown sins generally, Psalm. 19.
13. Psalm. 51. 4, 5.
of known sins particularly, with the aggrauation of them by their several
circumstances. Especially we must acknowledge and lay opne the root and
fountain of them, our original corruption, from which they have sprung and
flowed, and then the cursed fruits and filthy streams that have issued from
them; but above all, we must not forget in this our confession, those special
sins, unto which we are most inclined, and wherewith we have most offended
and dishonored God; nor those sins which we have committed lately, and since
the last time of renewing our repentance. And withal we must judge and
condemn our selves Genesis 32. 10. Ezra. 9. 6, 7. Dan. 9. 4, 5.
as unworthy, by reason of our sins, the least of Gods mercies, and most
worthy of the greatest of his judgments and punishments, coming into Gods
presence as Benhadads followers before Ahab, and acknowledging, that if we had
our desert, death and condemnation were due unto us. 1. King. 20. 31. Psalm. 51.
4. 1. Cor. 11. 32.
And this we must do, to justify the Lord when he judges, and to glorify
his name, in giving unto him the praise of mercy and forgiveness; and that
thus judging our selves, we may not be condemned of the Lord. Neither are we to
stay here under the sentence of the Law, but to flee unto the throne of grace,
begging mercy and forgiveness at the hands of God, for his own names sake,
for his truth sake in his covenant and gracious promises, and for his Christ's
sake, his merits, satisfaction and obedience performed for us. The fruit and
benefit of which humble confession, is the full assurance of the remission of
all our sins, grounded upon the truth of Gods promises; For, If we confess
our sins, he is faithful and just 1. John. 1. 9
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. And
again, He that hides his sins, shall not prosper: but he that confesses
Pro. 28. 13.
and forsakes them, shall have mercy. Both which we see verified in the
example of David, who whilst he concealed his sin, found the hand of God
Psalm. 32. 3, 4, 5. 2 Samuel 12. 13.
heavy upon him, which vexed his very bones, and made him roar in sense of
pain. But when he confessed and acknowledged his sin, the Lord forgave him
all his iniquities.

. Sect. 4 Of our detestation and hatred of sin.
Fourthly, there is required heereunto an hearty hatred and detestation of all
sin. To which end we must consider, that it is an offense against Gods
infinite Majesty, and supreme Justice, and that nothing in the world is so
contrary unto his most pure and holy nature; nothing so odious and loathsome
unto him, as appears by his most just severity, in punishing of it with most
sharp and grievous punishments. For though our first parents in the state of
innocence, were his most excellent and best beloved creatures, yet for one
transgression he rejected them, and punished not only them, but also all their
posterity with temporal punishments of all kinds, and everlasting death and
condemnation both of body and soul. Though the world and the creatures therein
were his excellent workmanship, yet when it was defiled with the sin of man,
it was with all its inhabitants (saving those which were reserved in the Arc)
destroyed with an universal deluge. For sin he consumed Sodom and Gomorrah
with fire and brimstone from heaven, and rejected the whole nation of his
beloved Israel from being his people. Yea, when our Savior Jesus Christ, the
Son of his love, bore our sins as our surety, he spared him not, but caused
him in his body to suffer most grievous punishments, and in his soul to bear
the full viols of his wrath, till his Justice, by his all-sufficient
sufferings, was fully satisfied. The which considerations must make us daily to
renew our hatred against all our sins, which God so mortally hates, and
especially those which cleave fastest to our corrupt nature, and unto which we
are most inclined, because by them we do most often displease and dishonor
our gracious God and loving Father: And to proclaim continual war against
them, that we may vanquish and subdue, mortify and crucify them; and
seriously to resolve with our selves, that we will upon no conditions live any
longer in them, but renounce and forsake them with our uttermost endeavor, how
pleasant and profitable soever they have formerly seemed to our carnal
appetite.

. Sect. 5 Of our fear and care that we be not circumuented with sin.
Fifthly, in consideration of our own frailty and infirmity, and the malice
and subtilty of our spiritual enemies, we must daily and continually fear
that we be not overtaken with the deceitfulness of sin, nor Pro. 28. 13. 1.
Cor. 10. 12. Romans 11. 20.
caught in these snares of the devil, which ought justly to be so odious and
loathsome unto us; and have our hearts taken up with fervent and zealous
desires, to preserve our souls and bodies in purity and honor, free from the
pollution of any sin. To which end, we must daily with all conscionable
care, keep a diligent and straight watch over all our works and ways, but
especially over our hearts, that they be not overtaken with Pro. 4. 23.
any love or liking of sin, but constantly repel the first motions and
allurements of it, when they present themselves unto us; especially we must
have an eye to our natural infirmities, and those sins, unto which being
Heb. 12. 1, 4.
most prone, we are most easily overtaken of them. Yea, we must in this watch
carefully avoid, not only the sins themselves, but also all the occasions
and means which may draw us to the committing of them; especially the familiar
society of wicked men, who are most apt to corrupt and infect us with their
persuasions and evil examples. Finally, we must daily resolve and endeavor,
not only to leave and forsake all sin, but also to serve the Lord, in
performing all the contrary duties of holiness, righteousness, and sobriety,
according to all good occasions and opportunities, which in the whole day, or
any part thereof shall be offered unto us, and in all our thoughts, words, and
deeds, to please the Lord, by yielding cheerful obedience unto his holy will.
Especially, our care and endeavor must be to perfect those graces, in which we
find our selves most defective, and with extraordinary diligence to practice
those duties toward God, our neighbors, and our selves, which our consciences
tell us we have formerly most neglected, and unto which we feel our corrupt
natures to be most backward and auerse; that so we may daily aspire to a
greater growth in godliness, and bring forth, the longer we live, the more and
better fruits of new obedience.

. Sect. 6 The benefits which would arise of this exercise of renewing our
repentance.
And if we would thus daily renew our repentance, the benefits arising unto us
from this holy exercise would be inestimable. For first, we should prevent
innumerable sins, into which, through the neglect of this duty, we fall
daily, unadvisedly, and at unawares; but especially we should be armed
hereby against all sins committed against knowledge and conscience.
Secondly, if at any time through frailty we be overtaken with any sin, we
should not lie in it, but rise again by unfeigned repentance; and so heal the
sores of sin, whilst the wound is green, with much greater ease, and not
suffer them to fester and rankle, to our greater pain and danger. Thirdly, we
should much abate the violence of our fleshly lusts, when as though they with
much labor put us to a foil, yet they shall not be able, no not for one day,
to keep their hold and rule over us; and who will take any great pains to so
little purpose? or swallow down that potion with any pleasure, which he must
be forced to cast up so quickly with much grief? or embrace that sin with
any great delight, which within a few hours shall be plucked from him with an
holy violence and indignation? or offend so good a God, or hazard a precious
soul, or disturb the sweet peace of a good conscience, for the fruition of a
sinful pleasure so vain, so momentany? Fourthly, though through infirmity we
sometimes fall, yet shall we hereby be preserved from sleeping in carnal
security, and from being hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, and
though through weakness of the flesh, we slumber Heb. 3. 13.
with the Spouse in the Canticles, yet shall we not fall into a dead sleep,
but say with her, I sleep, but my heart waketh. Fifthly, we shall hereby
preserve Cant. 5. 3.
our consciences tender, so as they will give us warning when sin makes the
least appearance, and our hearts pure and soft, so as they will easily relent
with the least touch. Sixthly, we shall make the practice of a godly life,
easy and familiar, and Christ's yoke light, when as we are accustomed to bear
it every day. Seventhly, we shall either altogether keep it from entering into
our hearts, or at least from holding possession by pleading custom and
prescription. Eighthly, we shall preserve peace with God, and an holy communion
with him; and the peace also of a good conscience; or if there be any cause of
inward iarres, we shall compound and take them up before we sleep. Ninthly, we
shall go to rest securely, when as we go to bed with our quietus est, and
sleep quietly, Psalm. 4. 8.
when we have our pardon under our pillow. Finally, we shall always be
prepared for the approach of death and Judgment, when as we keep always our
accounts ready made; and though with the five wise Virgins, we sometimes
slumber and sleep, as well as the foolish, yet having our oil in our lamps,
we shall be ready to rise at the first call, to enter with our Bridegroom into
the marriage chamber, and communicate with him in all joy and happiness.

CAP. III.
Of our daily exercise in renewing of our faith.

. Sect. 1 That the daily renewing of our faith is very profitable and necessary.
Unto this daily exercise of renewing of our repentance, we must add also
the renewing of our faith, which is no less necessary then the other; for as
the virtue and vigor of our bodies soon faints and decays, if they be not
often and daily nourished with those elements whereof they are made and
composed; so will the strength of faith be weakened and abated, if it be not
daily sustained and refreshed with those means and helps, by which it was
begot and begun in us, and therefore if vvhilest we have good stomachs in our
youthful days, we think it not enough to refresh and nourish our bodies one
day in a week, nor yet once in a day; but must have our dinners and suppers,
breakefasts and beuers; let us not think, that it is enough for the
nourishment of our souls, and strengthening of our faith, to use spiritual
repast on the Sabbath only, which though it may hold life and soul together,
yet shall we not be thriuing and in good liking in our spiritual man, if we
relieve and cherish it not with a more liberal hand, and allot some part of
every day to this spiritual exercise. Again, as faith in it self will faint
and languish, if it be not daily refreshed and renewed, so are there also
outward causes which shake and weake^ it, if it be not duly, and even daily
nourished. For we daily wound and weaken it with our sins, whilst our inward
guilt abateth our assurance of Gods love, and confidence in his favor, by
laying to our charge our great unworthiness of his least mercies. And therefore
we had need to renew daily our faith, as we daily renew our sins, by laying
hold on the Covenant of grace, which assures us that our sins shall not stop
the course of Gods mercies, because their current is free; and if the streams
be not dammed up (as it were) in the fountain with unbelief, it is not our
unworthiness can keep them from us. Finally, the spiritual enemies of our
salvation do daily and continually assault us, and the chief means to repel
the fiery darts of their tentations, is the shield of faith; which in it Ephesians.
6. 16.
self is not so impenetrable and of high proof, (were it not strengthened and
made effectual to preserve us by Christ's mediation) but that it is often Luke
22. 32.
much battered and bruised in the conflict of tentations. And therefore seeing
their malice never cease, which makes this shield of faith always
necessary, and their daily assaults do cause it to be of daily use; it is our
wisdom to let no day pass, without reviving and renewing it, that we may by
such means as God has appointed, repair and strengthen it, so as it may be
fit to preserve us against all assaults of tentation. Join we then with the
daily exercise of renewing our repentance, this also of renewing our faith; and
the rather, because they mutually further and strengthen one another being
conjoined; but being severed, both are weakened and dismembered, and either
cannot at all be exercised of us, or but lamely and to little purpose, in
semblance and show, not in deed and truth. For faith is the cause and very life
of repentance, none truly mourning for sin, but such as by faith being
assured of Gods love, are grieved in their hearts, that they have grieved so
loving a God; and without this filial affection proceeding from faith, our
repentance would be but like that of Cain and Judas, a worldly and desperate
sorrow that works 2. Cor. 7. 10.
death. And contrariwise, repentance is the very breath of faith, which if it
have free passage, then faith not only lives, but flourishes and thriueth;
so that hereby, as by an infallible sign, we may know and discern it from
security and presumption; but if it fail, then the life of faith also fails,
and becomes a dead carcass, without all virtue and vigor, sense or motion.

. Sect. 2 What this renewing our faith is, and the means whereby we may be
enabled to do it, which consist, first, in diverse meditations.
Now this daily renewing of our faith is nothing else, but after we have
humbled our souls in the sight and sense of our sins by unfeigned repentance,
to refresh and strengthen it, and (as it were) to heal the wounds which our
sins have made, by applying Christ with the sovereign salve of his precious
blood, and the sweet promises of the Gospel made in him, assuring us of the
remission and pardon of all our sins. Now the means and helps whereby we
may be enabled to renew our faith, and in the application of these benefits,
may confirm and strengthen it against doubting and incredulity, do either
respect meditation or action. We must meditate on the eternal and immutable,
free and undeserved love of God, even before we were created, and after that by
sin we had made our selves strangers and enemies, which moved him to give
his best Beloved to the death for us, and from hence conclude for the
strengthening of our faith; that he will never cease to be gracious unto us,
when as by Christ being reconciled, we adhere and cleave unto him with
unfeigned love and hearty affection. Secondly, on Gods inestimable and infinite
mercies, which are far above all his works, and therefore may assure us,
that they will be much more powerful and all-sufficient to save us, then our
sins, though never so innumerable and grievous, can be to condemn us.
Thirdly, on Gods truth, which will never fail in any of his promises, and
omnipotent power and wisdom, whereby he is infinitely able to accomplish
them. Fourthly, on the all sufficiency of Christ's obedience and satisfaction,
for the discharging of all our debts, and satisfying of Gods Justice for all
our sins, if we make them our own by a lively faith. Fifthly, on the
Covenant of grace, which is free, and assures us of the pardon of our sins,
and salvation of our souls, upon no condition of works or worthiness, but
only of faith, bringing forth the fruits of unfeigned repentance. Sixthly, on
the promises of the Gospel, which being general and indefinite, exclude none,
though never so sinful and unworthy, if they will thankefully receive them as
they are freely offered, and apply them to themselves by a lively faith.
Seventhly, we must meditate on the Sacraments and seals of the Covenant,
whereby God has given unto us (as it were) into our hands, Christ Jesus and
all his benefits; and of his most infallible oath, whereby he has confirmed
his promises unto us; as also of his Spirit, whereby he has inwardly sealed
unto us our redemption and salvation. Eighthly, on the manifold examples of his
mercy and goodness, extended to all repentant sinners, and that he being no
respecter of persons, is as ready to make us partakers of them, if we do not
reject them through unbelief. Ninthly, on the manifold experience which we
have had of them toward our selves, both in temporal and spiritual benefits,
and that being unchangeable in his nature and gifts, he is still ready to be
alike good and gracious, if by faith we will rest and rely upon him. Neither is
it enough that we know, and habitually believe that God has given unto us
many and singular privileges; as his Son to be our Savior and Redeemer; his
Word, Sacraments, and holy Spirit, by which he has effectually called us to
the knowledge and participation of this great work of our redemption,
justification, and remission of all our sins, reconciliation and adoption,
whereby we are made not only children of God, but also heirs of his Kingdom,
assurance of continual preservation in this life, and of salvation and
glorification in the life to come; but we must actually exercise our faith, by
allotting some part of the day to think and meditate on the excellency of
these privileges; as what a blessed thing it is to be saved by Christ, and
delivered out of the power of all our spiritual enemies, and to live and die
in the state of salvation: What a singular benefit it is to have all our sins
pardoned, and our debts cancelled, so that we need not fear at any time to be
called to Judgment, and to give up our accounts, seeing Christ has satisfied
for all, and made our reckonings even for us: What a sweet and comfortable a
thing it is to have peace with God, and peace of conscience, and the beams of
his favor continually shining upon us, and warming our hearts with joy and
gladness? What an inestimable privilege it is to be the child of God, and
heir apparent to the Kingdom of heaven? which considerations, if we
seriously think on them, will be singular means to inflame our hearts with
Gods love, to ravish them with spiritual joy, and to make them cheerful in
Gods service, throughout the whole day, yea to the very end of the longest life.

. Sect. 3 The second sort of means consist in the performance of diverse
actions.
And unto these meditations, we are for the renewing of our faith to add
diverse actions; as first, we must daily renew our promises unto God made in
baptism, and bewayling our manifold frailties and imperfections, whereby we
have often failed herein, we are to resolve and promise, that if God will
accept of us, and pass by our former infirmities, we will with more entire
affection renounce sin, Satan and all our spiritual enemies, and consecrate
our selves wholly to his worship and service, and with greater zeal and
devotion labor in the use of all good means, whereby we may attain to more
perfection. Secondly, we must labor to find and feel our hearts more and
more inflamed with unfeigned love toward God, in respect of his infinite
goodness and absolute perfection in himself, and graciousnesse toward us,
shining in his unspeakable and innumerable blessings and benefits bestowed
upon us, which love toward God will strengthen our faith in assurance of his
love toward us, seeing it is but a drop that distilleth from this fountain,
and but a spark that arises from this infinite flame. Thirdly, we must
exercise our selves in the daily practice of religious duties, as prayer,
meditation, holy conferences, and such like, which will increase our communion
and acquaintance with God, and more and more assure us of his favor. And
finally, we must resolve to take all good occasions of doing daily the works
of mercy and Christian charity toward our neighbors for Gods sake, whereby
our faith will get daily new assurance, that seeing we are willing and desirous
to glorify God in all things, by causing the light of our godly lives to shine
before men, he will be no less willing to glorify us before his Matthew. 5.
16. 1. Sam. 2. 30.
Saints and holy Angels in his heavenly Kingdom. For these duties of piety and
righteousness, are the fruits which spring from the root of faith, the flames
and heat which proceed from this fire, the very breath whereby it lives, and
the actions and motions wherein it is exercised; and therefore if it brings
not forth these fruits, it is but a barren tree and dead stock, a vselesse
fire, which being covered, gives no light or heat; a dead carcass without
breath, an idle habit without virtue or vigor, and for want of exercise
languisheth and decays daily in strength; whereas contrariwise, if the
strength thereof were used, and seasonably employed in holy and righteous
actions, it would (like the strength of the body) be confirmed and redoubled
by this daily exercise.

. Sect. 4 The manifold benefits which would arise from the daily renewing of
our faith.
But that we may be the better persuaded unto this daily exercise of renewing
our faith; let us consider more particularly the manifold and inestimable
benefits which would thereby accrue unto us. For first, we shall live in
covenant with God, have assured title and interest unto all his promises,
without any intercession or intermission of our comfort and hope, seeing God
requires of us no other condition. Secondly, we shall no longer live the life
of the flesh and corrupted nature, but the life of faith, Hab 2. 4. Mat. 4. 4.
which is principally sustained by God, and holds dependancie, not on earthly
things, but chiefly on his Word and promise, which can never fail; and the
life of Christ, subiecting our selves in all things to the regiment and
government of his holy Spirit; so as we may say with the Apostle, I live, yet
not I, but Christ lives in me, and the life which I now live in the Gal. 2. 20.
flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
himself for me; which life of grace certainly assures us of the life of
glory. Thirdly, hereof it will follow, that all our thoughts, words, and
works, shall be voluntarily subjected to the good will and pleasure of God,
and being daily in covenant with God, we shall, by virtue of his Spirit
assisting us, keep all our faculties and functions, senses, and actions, in
covenant with Job 31. 1.
us, that they shall in all things obey him, and do nothing which is
displeasing unto him. Fourthly, by renewing our faith daily, we shall with it
renew all the sanctifying and saving graces which issue from it, and depend
upon it, and by watring the root, give virtue and vigor unto all the branches
and fruits which spring from it; whereas contrariwise we shall spend all our
labor in vain, if neglecting faith, we use all diligence and endeavor to
increase in love, patience, hope, or any other grace, or to bring forth
plentiful fruits of them in a Christian conversation, and the works of mercy
and charity; like those who take much pains in watring the boughs and
branches of a tree, and never take care to water the root. More especially, if
we daily renew our faith, we shall hereby confirm our affiance and
confidence in God, in all things, and at all times; for when we firmly by
faith apply unto our use the power, wisdom, goodness, promises, and
providence of God, and with strong imbracements unite them unto us, we may
easily with all safety and security rest and rely upon them. We shall hereby
also strengthen our hope, which is nothing but an expectation of the things
believed; and according as our faith is strong or weak in apprehension of the
promises, so also is our hope which waits for their fruition. We shall
increase by it our love toward God: for the more and oftener we apprehend the
divine fire of his love toward us, the more our cold hearts are thereby
inflamed with the heat of it, so that we return unto him love for love: And
our zeal of Gods glory, there being no stronger argument to make us in all
things earnest to glorify him, then to be fully assured that he will glorify
us. It will work in us, and daily renew our patience, when as we daily renew
our assurance, that all our afflictions are the chastizements of a loving
Father, and not the punishments of a severe Judge; that they are stinted and
measured out unto us, both in respect of their quantity and continuance, by a
most wise providence, which will not let them exceed either our strength or
necessity; that they are inflicted out of mere love, and are signs, not of
our reiection, but adoption and salvation; that they shall Romans 8. 18. 2. Cor.
4. 17.
have a good issue, and work together for the best, for the enriching of us
with spiritual grace, and the furthering of our eternal glory. It will
increase our peace of conscience, when as our assurance is daily renewed of our
peace with God, the remission of all our sins, and victory over all the
enemies of our salvation; of our safety under his protection, and that nothing
shall be able to separate his love from us. It will daily replenish our hearts
with renewed joys in the holy Ghost, and after that they are exhausted with
our infirmities and miseries, renewed faith will like afresh Romans 14. 17. Heb.
12. 11.
hand draw new supplies from God the fountain of our joy, until they be
replenished and ouerflow. Yea, it will make our joy, not like that of
worldlings, in the fact, and not in the heart, momentany and mutable, like the
cracking of thorns under a pot, whilst the brushie fuel of prosperity

John 16. 22.
nothing shall be able to take it from us. It will fill our hearts daily with
the comforts of the Spirit, when as being daily renewed, it does afresh assure
us of our communion with God, and that Christ and all his benefits do belong
unto us, which either respect this life, or the life to come.

. Sect. 5 Of diverse other benefits which follow the daily renewing of our faith.
Fifthly, the daily renewing of our faith, is the most effectual means of our
unfeigned repentance; For what can be so powerful an argument to make us
mourn for our sins with bitter grief, as with the eye of faith to look
upon him whom by our sins we have pierced, and through the wound in his side,
to see his heart so replenished with divine love, and as it were, supplying the
place of that blood and water that issued out of it? and what can make us more
hate sin, or to resolve to please God in all holy and righteous duties, then
believing that the Lord being so infinitely just, and abhorring sin with such
implacable hatred, that he spared not his only begotten and most dearly
beloved Son, but when he bore our sins, caused him to bear also our
griefs and sorrows, wounded him for our transgressions, and bruized him with
the pains of death, and fearful burden of his wrath for our iniquities; to
believe also that he is toward us, so infinitely merciful, that he gave his
Son to us, and for us to suffer all these torments for a time, that we might
not suffer them for ever; that he wounded him for our transgressions, that we
might be healed by his hurts, cleansed and purified from the guilt, punishment
and corruption of all our sins with the streams of his blood, acquitted by
his condemnation, and revived by his death? For who is so audaciously
desperate, as to dare by voluntary sinning provoke such a Justice? who is so
hard-harted and ungrateful, as would be enticed with the baits of worldly
vanities, to neglect in any thing to please so infinite a goodness? So what
can more powerfully move us to flee all sin, and to practice with all
diligence all Christian duties of holiness and righteousness, then by faith
not only to enjoy Gods present blessings in their own worth and excellency,
but as earnest pennies and first fruits, pledges and pawnes of heavenly and
eternal reward, wherewith God of his free grace has promised to crown all
our labors and Illi terrena sapiunt, qui coelestia promissa non habent. Illi
breui huic vitae se totos implicent, qui aeterna nesciunt, and. c. Hieronym. ad
Celantiam.
holy endeavors? whereas if there were no belief and expectation of reward,
we should faint under the weight of afflictions, languish in the performance
of Christian duties, which are so ill esteemed and accepted in the world, and
be wholly taken up in the pursuit of earthly vanities, because we have
entertained no better hopes. For as one says, They savor earthly things,
which believe not heavenly promises; They wholly addict themselves to things
that belong unto this transitory life, which apprehend not those things which
are eternal. They fear not to sin, who think that it shall have no
punishment; and finally, they become slaves to their vices, who expect not the
future rewards of virtue, etc. Sixthly, by this daily renewing of our faith,
we shall be strengthened against all the tentations of our spiritual
enemies, so as they shall not be Ephe. 6. 17.
able to hurt and wound us, whether these darts be cast against us from the
right hand, or from the left. For faith, as an impenetrable Shield, enableth us
to overcome and beat back tentations arising from worldly prosperity; whilst
apprehending heavenly and everlasting excellencies, it makes us to contemn
these base and momentanie vanities; and the tentations which arise from crosses
and afflictions, by persuading us that they are the straight way that leads
to happiness, that they are not worthy Acts 14 22. Romans 8. 18. 2. Cor. 4. 17.
2. Tim. 2. 12.
the glory that shall be revealed; that these light and moment any afflictions
work for us afar more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; and that if we
suffer with Christ, we shall also reign with him. Finally, faith thus daily
renewed, not only effectually persuades us unto an holy resolution of leading
a Christian and godly life, but also powerfully enables us to performeall the
duties thereunto required, with alacrity and cheerfulness, joy and delight;
for it moves us to consecrate our selves wholly to the service of him, who has
graciously redeemed us out of the hands of all our spiritual enemies, and to
testify our love and thankfulness unto him, who has done all this for us,
by our new obedience. It unites us unto Christ, and applies unto us the virtue
of his death, by which sin is mortified and crucified in us, and we unto it,
and to the world, so that we will no longer serve them in fulfilling worldly and
carnal lusts; and the virtue of his resurrection, whereby we are enabled to
rise from the death of sin, to holiness and newness of life. It gives unto
us with spiritual life, spiritual motion; it cleanses and changes our
hearts, and taking away the old, it works in us a new nature, which is active
and operative in all holy and righteous duties, and diligent and cheerful in
the performance of them. And whereas before we either did them not at all, or
but in outward show formally and coldly, and that not without much pains and
difficuly; it enableth us now to perform them like natural actions, with much
ease and delight; so as we can say with David, that the Law of God is our
Psalm. 119.
chief delight, better unto us then thousands of gold and silver, and sweeter
then the honey or hony-combe; And with our Savior, that it is our meat John 4.
34.
and drink to do the will of our heavenly Father. And as unnatural motions
are not without outward violence, lasting no longer then it lasts, but
natural are easy and permanent, as the Sun shines, and the river runs of
their own accord, freely and without compulsion; so by help of this new
nature which faith works in us, our actions and motions in the ways of
godliness are easy and pleasant, which unto corrupt nature were, even in
respect of the outward act, harsh and difficult, continuing no longer then some
outward cause of fear or reward does set them on going. And as the heat of a
bath continues always, because it proceeds from an inward cause, which
changes the nature of the water; whereas the waters of a pond cannot be made
warm, but with much labor and and difficulty, and continue in their heat no
longer then the outward cause works it in them: so when as faith has warmed
our hearts with zeal of Gods glory, and made them active and operative in
performing the duties of his service, this heat and motion continue with ease
and cheerfulness, because they are spiritually natural, and proceed from an
inward cause; whereas if worldly causes work this heat of zeal (as honor
and preferment in the heat of Iehu) it being unnatural and forced, soon
returns to its wonted coldness. Finally, faith thus renewed, will make us to
serve God with cheerfulness and delight, because it incourageth us in our
labors, by apprehending and putting into our hands, not only the present pay
of all Gods temporary blessings and benefits, but also the evidences and
conueighances of our heavenly happiness, which God of his free grace has by
his writings in the Word, and his seals the Sacraments, made over unto us. And
who wouldnot cheerfully and with joy do him faithful service, who gives us
present pay above the worth of our work; and for our better encouragement
assures us, that all this shall be but a small earnest in respect of the main
bargain, and but the first fruits of that full crop and plentiful harvest of
heavenly happiness?

CAP. IIII.
Of our daily exercise in seeking God, and what are the things which are
required unto it.

. Sect. 1 That our seeking God daily, is a necessary duty.
THe second main duty, which we are daily, and even throughout the day to
perform, is, to seek the Lord our God, by consecrating our selves wholly both
in our souls and bodies unto his worship and service. The which duty is
required in many places of the Scriptures. So David exhorts the Princes of
Israel, to set their hearts and souls to seek the Lord their 1. Chro. 22. 19.
God; and the Lord by his Prophet requires it of all the people; Seek ye Esa
55. 6.
the Lord whilst he may be found, and call ye upon him while he is near. And
again; Seek ye the Lord, and ye shall live. For howsoever the Lord, in Amos
5. 4.
respect of the infiniteness and immensitie of his nature and essence, fills
all places with his presence, and therefore cannot be far (as the Apostle
speaks) from every one of us; for in him we live, and move, and have our
being, as the heathens saw even by the very light of nature; and though Acts
17. 27, 28.
in the state of innocence and integrity man had sweet communion with God,
and inioyed the comfortable and lively influences of his saving graces, and
dwelled in God, and God in him: yet through the fall of our first parents, and
the ouerspreading corruption which did accompany it; man lost God, and was
deprived of his presence; was wholly estranged from that happy and holy
communion, and had all influence of his grace stopped from: And together with
this inestimable loss, he lost also the sense of this loss, and of all the
miseries which did accompany it, and therefore never cared or desired to seek
and find him, that being again reunited unto him, he might thereby recover
his lost happiness; till God, out of his free grace and infinite goodness
pitying man's loss and misery, like the good Shepherd, sought us first, who
like wandering sheep Esa. 53. 5. Luke 15. 4, 5.
did stray from him, without any desire of returning, and carrying us home to
his sheepefold, caused us to find him before we sought him, yea when we
gainesaid and refused to make this search, according to that of the Prophet
cited by the Apostle, I was found of them who sought me not; I Esa. 65. 1, 2.
Romans 10. 20, 21.
was made manifest unto them that enquired not after me: All the day long I
have stretched out my hands unto a disobedient and gain saying people. Yea,
but seeing we have now found God, and have him always by his grace present
with us, what needs (may some say) this daily search and disquisition, seeing
that labor may seem vain and to little purpose, which is spent in seeking
that which is already found? To which I answer, that we may do that act in an
higher degree of perfection, which in the first degrees is done already, yea,
seeing we can never in this world do it so perfectly as we should, therefore
we ought to do it daily and continually, that we may aspire unto more
perfection. And this God, who by his preventing grace caused us to seek him
for our own good: requires us to do daily and more and more for our greater
good: and because all our happiness does consist in our finding and inioying
him; not contenting himself that we should be in the first and least degrees
happy, by finding and inioying him in some small measure, he makes it our
daily task to seek him more and more, that finding him more perfectly, we
may perfect our happiness in our full finding and fruition. Yea, in truth
there is none that has truly found him, who does not daily endeavor to find
him more and more. For what hungry man that has once tasted delicate meats,
that can content himself with a taste only, and does not rather desire to
feed on them, till he be satisfied and his hunger allayed? what wise Merchant
finding a treasure in a field, which he has long sought, contenteth himself
only to have found it; and does not rather purchase the field, that he may
enjoy the treasure hid in it? or finding a precious pearl, satisfies himself
with a slight sight of the luster and beauty of it; and does not rather sell
all he has, to buy it, being never at quiet till he safely possesses it in
his own Cabinet? or who finding a rich mine of gold or silver, is contented
with the first oar which it offers unto his view; and does not rather dig
deeper and deeper, till he have made himself owner of the whole treasure? And
therefore it is impossible for any man, that has tasted how good God is to
those that seek him, to leave off and so content himself; but he will labor
still to feed on him more and more, till he (as the Psalmist speaks) be
satisfied with his likeness in the Kingdom of heaven, seeing Psalm. 17. 15.
in his greatest fruition in this life, he knows that he wants much of
him. And to leave off further hungring after God, after that we have tasted of
his love, bounty and goodness, and to content our selves with a taste only,
without further feeding on them, is an evident sign that we are in the number
of those relapsed hypocrites, who cannot be renewed Heb. 6. 5, 6.
by repentance. It is impossible, that if ever we truly felt the incomparable
pleasure of Gods presence, but that we should seek to enjoy it more and more,
til we attain unto fulness of joy in our full fruitio^ in Gods Kingdom.

. Sect. 2 What it is to seek God.
Let us then make it our daily exercise to seek the Lord our God, whom to
find, and to be happy and blessed, is all one, and whom to miss and lose, is
to be miserable and accursed, though we should gain and enjoy the whole world,
and all the happiness which it can offer unto us. And to this end, let us
consider what it is to seek God, so as we may be sure to find him. Secondly,
the manner and properties of this seeking. Thirdly, the inestimable benefits
which accrue unto them who daily seek and find him. And lastly, the evils,
miseries, and mischiefs, which befall all those that neglect this holy duty.
For the first; to seek God, is to labor daily in and through Christ, to
recover and make him our own, whom we have lost through the fall of Adam, and
our own original Esa. 59. 2.
corruption and actual transgressions, that being reconciled and reunited unto
him, and so becoming one with him, and he with us, we may be Ioh. 17. 21, 22,
23
happy and blessed in his fruition. For in and through Christ alone, God is to
be sought of us; and by him and no other possible means can we ever find him;
in him only Gods Justice is satisfied, and wrath appeased; in him, as our
alone propitiatory sacrifice, he is well-pleased, and being reconciled 1. Ioh.
2. 1.
in the body of his flesh through death, of a severe Judge and terrible enemy,
he is become our gracious Father and chiefest friend. And so perfectly has he
made our peace through the blood of his Cross, that he has left Col. 1. 20,
21.
nothing for us to do, but joining with his holy Spirit, to labor that this
inestimable benefit may be applied unto us; which is chiefly done by seeking
and suing, with earnest desires and hearty endeavors to obtain and make it our
own by faith.

. Sect. 3 What is required unto the seeking of God. First, that we daily
labor more perfectly to know him, and remember him.
And to this seeking of God and his favor in Christ, there are diverse things
required; first, that we labor daily more and more perfectly to know him, not
so much what he is in his own nature, essence, and attributes, as what he is
in Christ unto us, that is, infinitely wise to govern us, and all-sufficient
by his Word and Spirit to make us wise unto salvation; that he is omnipotent to
defend us, and give us victory over all our enemies; that he is immutable, not
only in his own nature, but in his love, goodness, and gifts unto us; that
he is true to perform unto us his gracious promises, and merciful to forgive
us our sins, and save our souls; that Christ is an all-sufficient and
perfect Redeemer, to deliver us out of the hands of all our spiritual enemies,
and to bring unto us full redemption; that the Spirit is not only holy in his
own nature, but also to work in us sanctification and holiness. In all
which, and all other respects, we are not so much to labor to know these
things in speculation, as in practice and experience, nor to apprehend them in
the brain, as to feel them in our hearts, nor to conceive of their excellency
and sufficiency as causes, but experimentally to feel and find their
efficacy, in producing their effects, and bringing forth their fruits in us.
And this is that excellent knowledge which the Apostle so much and continually
labored to Phil. 2. 10, 11. 1. Cor. 2. 2.
attain unto, as a thing which being of most excellent use, was also of great
difficulty; and therefore he was content to be taken up wholly of it, and in
comparison of it, to neglect all other knowledge, not only to know that Christ
died and rose again, and the virtue and sufficiency of them for his
justification and salvation, which were but the study of a few days or hours,
and is easy to be found and learned in every Catechism; and therefore it is
not to be thought that the Apostle, who was of such excellent gifts, and
illuminated with such an extraordinary measure of knowledge, did take so much
pains, and spend his chiefest time and strength in attaining unto it; but to
find and feel the power and efficacy of Christ's death and resurrection in his
own heart, for the strengthening of his faith, the inflaming of his love, the
mortifying of his corruptions, and his spiritual quickening unto new obedience
and holiness of life. And as we are thus daily to seek God, by laboring
more perfectly and effectually to know him; so also by indeuouring to have
these things thus known in continual remembrance, that thinking and
meditating on them, we may take all good occasions to reap the fruit and
benefit of them for our own use, to speak of them as opportunity is offered,
for the good and edification of others, and to draw this knowledge into
continual practice, for the reforming and amending of our lives and
conuersations. To which purpose, we must daily endeavor to purge our memories,
and to cast out of these storehouses the rubbish and trash of sinful
vanities, which do but cumber the room, and take up the place of spiritual
riches and heavenly provision, and as it were to blot out of these tables all
lessons of impiety, which in the days of our ignorance were written in them,
with all vain, carnal, and corrupt motions and conceits, which will be so
many distractions to withdraw our minds from God and spiritual meditations;
and in place hereof we must strive to write in them all profitable
instructions, which we have formerly learned, and those especially which we
have observed in our last holy and spiritual exercises. And if we thus like
scholars daily say our part, and recall to our remembrance the lessons which we
have learned the last Sabbath, or any day of the week besides, they will be so
deeply imprinted in our memories, that they will not easily be forgotten,
neither will the learning of new lessons, be a means to put out the old, and
make us forget what we have formely learned.

. Sect. 4 The second thing is, that we adhere unto him with our hearts and
affections.
Secondly, unto this daily exercise of seeking God, it is required, that we
do continually adhere and cleave unto him with our hearts and affections; that
we labor and endeavor daily more and more to weane Col. 3. 1, 2.
them from the world and worldly vanities, that they may wholly be fixed and
fastened upon him, not affecting and doting upon earthly and momentany trifles
which profit not, but minding spiritual and heavenly excellencies, and seeking
those things which are above, where Christ sits at the right hand of God;
and that we do not carry our selves as Citizens of the earth, where we have no
abiding place, but that we have our conversation Phil. 3. 20.
in heaven, from whence we expect a Savior and Redeemer. More especially, we
must withdraw our affiance and trust from the arm of flesh, and earthly helps
and props, which will most fail us when we most rely upon them; and fasten
them wholly upon God the immovable Rock of our salvation, and our chief
Tower of strength, resting upon Psalm. 18. 1. Pro. 18. 10.
him at all times, and for all things; provision in time of want, protection in
time of danger, as well in the absence as presence of all inferior means;
knowing that he is infinitely gracious, and all-sufficient to preserve and
defend us without, as well as with them. We must also fasten our hopes daily
upon God, who is the sure anchor-hold that will stay and secure us against all
the storms of troubles and tentations; and daily comfort our selves in our
earthly pilgrimage, and take encouragement in the performance of all good
duties, even when we are crossed in them, and persecuted for them of the
world, by continual renewing our expectation of the performance of Gods
gracious promises, especially those that concern a better life, which will
make us to purge our selves, as he also 1. Ioh. 3. 2, 3.
is pure, and not to do any thing which may any way hazard our heavenly
happiness. Moreover, we must labor daily that the true fear of Mal. 1. 6.
the Lord may more and more possess our hearts, making us to reverence him as
our heavenly Father, and to stand in awe of him as our supreme Lord and King.
By which sonne-like and holy fear, we shall be more powerfully restrained from
all sin, because it is displeasing unto our loving Father, then by all humane
laws, shame of men, or the sharpest and seuerest punishments; and enticed with
more cheerfulness unto all Christian duties, because they are pleasing in his
sight, then by all earthly hopes or temporary rewards. By it all other servile
fear of men will be expelled, because when they have done their worst, they
can but kill the body; and when they have most severely whipped us, put a
Pasport into our hands, for our more speedy conducting into our heavenly
Country: and fearing only God, we shall become bold and courageous in all
good duties, and not caring greatly what men can say or do, we will yield
absolute obedience unto Gods Commandments, and submit our selves in all things
to be ruled by his Word and holy Spirit. And so shall we approve our selves
to be true Israelites, sound members of the Church, and loyal subjects of
Christ's Kingdom; of whom it is prophesied, that they shall return and seek
the Lord their God, and David their King, and shall fear the Hos. 3. 5.
Lord and his goodness in the latter days.

. Sect. 5 That we must cleave unto God by fervent love.
Fourthly, unto this daily exercise there is required, that we do adhere unto
him by most fervent love, setting our affections upon him, and Matthew. 22 37.
loving him above all things with all our minds, with all our souls and with
all our strength: And that we daily and continually renew our love, by
considering that he is in himself the chief goodness, infinite in all
excellency, beauty, mercy and all perfection, and therefore most lovely and
amiable; and also toward us most good and gracious, benign and bountiful. In
which respects we are to esteem it our chief happiness, to be by his love
toward us, and ours toward him, united unto him, and to enjoy him as our
chief goodness and blessedness. For if worldly men do place all their
happiness in the fruition of those earthly things unto which by love their
hearts are firmly united, as the ambitious man, in the inioying of his desired
honors; the covetous man, of his beloved riches; the voluptuous man, of his
wished pleasures; the carnal lover, in the obtaining of his love; how much
more ought we to esteem it the top and perfection of our felicity, when by
fervent love we enjoy God, being inseparably united unto him, and he unto us
in the bonds of love? how much more should our hearts be ravished with delight
(as the Spouse in the Canticles) with our mutual and sweet imbracements,
intercourse of kindness, and tokens and testimonies of love toward one
another? In which love if we would be truly happy, our daily care must be to
weane our hearts and affections more and more from the love of the world and
worldly vanities, that they may be wholly fastened and fixed upon God; and as
men, when they would intend the whole strength of their sight to the more
perfect beholding of an object, do wink with one eye, that all the visuall
spirits being collected in the other, they may more vigourously and exactly
discern and comprehend it: so if we would have the whole keys and influences
of our affections directed unto God, we must shut and auert them from the
world, that we may comprehend and embrace him with more perfection, when they
are wholly and soly fixed on him. Besides, the Lord is a jealous God, who can
endure no corriuals in his love, and much less that we should share and
divide our hearts between him and his enemies. He cannot abide, that
professing our selves his chaste Spouse, we should like filthy strumpets have
our hearts go a whoring after strange lovers. To which purpose one says, that
that soul cannot be filled with the gracious visitations of the Lord, Impleri
visitationibus Domini anima non potest quae bis distractionibus subiacet, etc.
Bern. In ascens. domini Sermon. 3.
which is subject to worldly distractions, and by how much the more it is
emptied of them, by so much it shall be the more filled of the other; if much,
then much; if little, then little. For if the Apostles adhering to the Lords
bodily presence, which was most holy, could not be filled with the Spirit, till
he was taken from them; how can thou hope, who art glued and fastened to the
world and thy filthy flesh, to have the sweet presence of God and comforts of
his Spirit, unless thou indeuourest to renounce these carnal comforts?

. Sect. 6 That we must labor daily to have our communion with God increased.
The fifth special duty required unto our daily seeking of God, is, that we
labor more and more to have our sweet communion with him increased, and the
comfortable fellowship of his holy Spirit dwelling in our hearts, sealed and
assured unto us. To which end it must be our daily exercise, to purge and
purify them by faith from all noisome corruptions and sinful thoughts, that
they may be fit temples and habitations for this pure and holy Spirit to dwell
in; and to deck and adorn them with sanctifying graces, which will cause him
to keep his residence in us with cheerfulness and delight: we must also
submit our selves to be ruled by him, and not quench any good motion which he
suggesteth, either by rebellious and flat denials, or by vain excuses and
sluggish delays, but presently put the duties in practice unto which he moves
us, and open the door of our hearts at his first knock and call, that he Apoc.
3. 20.
may come in, and supping with us, feast us with a most delicious banquet of
Spiritual refections; lest putting off his kind offers with slothful Cant.
5. 2, 3.
excuses (like the Spouse in the Canticles) we move him to depart, and hide
from us his gracious presence, and so move us by a sorrowful and painful
search, before we can recover and find him, to make more precious account of
his company when we do again enjoy it. We must be careful to preserve our
peace with him, if we would enjoy his company; for as the Prophet speaks, How
can two walk together, except they Amos. 3. 3.
be agreed? To which end we must often renew our faith, and after any slip or
infirmity, rely upon the mediation of our Savior Christ for our Romans 5. 1.
reconciliation and renewing of our peace. Neither must we alone apply Christ
unto us for justification, but also for sanctification, indeuouring in all
things to please God; and if we desire to have the peace of him, we must bind
our souls to our good behavior; laboring with fervent zeal to glorify him
in all our cogitations, words, and actions, not passing any of our time
unfruitfully and unprofitably: but employing it so, as some glory thereby may
redound to God, and some comfort to our own souls, by furthering the
assurance of their salvation. Contrariwise our care must be, that we do not
vex and grieve the good Spirit of God, by quenching his good motions which he
suggesteth, or by defiling our souls with sinful corruptions; especially,
that we do not suffer voluntarily and wilfully any known sins to dwell in
us, which will pollute our souls and bodies, and making them fitter to be
cages for unclean Birds, and noisome styes for filthy Swine, then Temples and
habitations for him to dwell in, will move him, as weary of his lodging, to
depart from us. Moreover, having this sweet communion with God, and
comfortable fruition of his presence, by his holy Spirit dwelling in us, we
must labor to preserve it inviolable, by carrying our selves daily, and in all
our thoughts, words, and actions, as in his sight, and not to do any thing
before him, which we would be ashamed to do in the presence of a man that is
just and religious. And seeing we have such communion with God, we must
endeavor to be holy, as he is Leuit. 19. 2. and 10. 2.
holy; for the Lord will be sanctified in all those that come so nigh him,
either in his mercy or Judgments; and being a consuming fire, we must take
heed that we be not as stubble and chafe, but as pure gold, which will not
be consumed, but be made daily more pure by our communion with him. Finally,
having this communion with God, we must rejoice in him above all things in the
world; and as this communion must not be by fits and starts, like that with
our worldly friends, whom we visit only at good times, or when we have got
some leisure from our business, but constant, daily, and continual, like the
communion of man and wife, who should dwell together in the same house, or of
the head with the members, and soul with the body, which whilst life lasts,
admit of no division or separation: so must our joy and rejoicing in God caused
by this communion, be constant and continual; according to that of the
Apostle, Rejoice evermore: And again, Rejoice 1. These. 5. 16. Phil. 4. 4.
in the Lord always: and again, I say, Rejoice; not only in worldly
prosperity, but also in affliction and tribulation; for if we enjoy this near
communion with God, he may much more fitly say unto us, as Elcanah to Annah,
Am not I much better unto thee then 1. Sam. 1. 8.
all worldly comforts, which are vain and worthless, for they last but a
while, and leave thee when thou most need them? And this joy will support
us, even when all other forsake us, and make our labor of love light and
easy, which we undertake for the Lords sake; It will weane our hearts for all
carnal delights, and make us even with great joy and comfort to finish our
tedious pilgrimage, when as we have the joy and delight of so sweet a
Companion in all our Travails.

. Sect. 7 That unto the seeking of God is required, that we daily renew our
repentance.
Sixthly, to the daily seeking of God, is required, that we daily renew our
repentance; for these in the Scriptures are usually joined together, to Deuteronomy.
4. 29, 30.
intimate unto us that we then seek God, when as we do unfeignedly repent us
of our sins. Thus the Lord promises, that if the people of Israel would in
their tribulation seek the Lord, with all their heart, and with all their
soul, and turn to the Lord their God, and be obedient unto his voice, then
they should find him. And that if they should humble themselves and pray, and
seek his face, and turn from their evil ways, then he would hear 2. Chro.
7. 14. Hos. 7. 10. and 10. 12. and 5. 15. Esa. 55. 6, 7.
from heaven, forgive their sins, and heal their land. So the Prophet Esaias
joins these together: Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye
upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will
have mercy upon him. Without which unfeigned repentance, we cannot truly be
said to seek God, or to have any communion with him; for if we say that we
1. Ioh. 1. 6.
have any fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the
truth. More especially we must seek the Lord, by humbling our selves in true
contrition and sorrow for our sins, which have estranged God from us, and
made us lose the sense and assurance of his love and favor. And therefore the
Lord exhorts the meek of the earth to seek him, that they might be hid in
the day of his anger: And says, that Israel and Judah should Zeph. 23.
come together, going and weeping, and should go and seek the Lord their God.
Ier. 50. 4.
Secondly, we must seek him, not only by bewailing and forsaking our sins,
but also by bringing forth the fruits of new obedience. Whereof it is, that
these also are conjoined in the Scriptures; Hearken unto me, ye Esa. 51. 1.
that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord. Thus Judah is
commanded to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to do after the Law and
2. Chro. 14. 4.
the Commandment. And Iehoshaphat is commended, because he sought the Lord God
of his father, and walked in his commandments: which duties, if 2. Chro. 17. 4.
we join together, we shall be blessed; according to that of the Psalmist,
Blessed are they that keep his Testimonies, and that seek him with their
whole heart. Psalm. 119. 2.


. Sect. 8 That we must seek to have and hold Gods grace and favor in Jesus
Christ.
Finally, to this duty of seeking God, is required, that we seek to have and
to hold his face and favor in Jesus Christ; desiring nothing more in Act. 17.
28.
the world, then to have the bright beams of his countenance continually
shining upon us, and to find and feel the sweet and vital influences of his
favor, warming our hearts with joy and comfort; for in him we live, and
move, and have our being: and if he graciously behold us with the benign
aspect of his mercy and love, we live and flourish; but if he do turn away
his face, we are troubled; and if he but blow upon us with the Ps. 104. 29, 30.
breath of his displeasure, our breath will fail, and dying, we shall return
to our dust. He is the life-giuing Planet, and Sun of all comfort and joy,
who by the beams and influences of his favor, both gives us life, and
preserves us in our well-being. And therefore as the inferior creatures are
much indammaged, when in the eclipses of the Sun they are for a short time
deprived of its presence and vital influences; so cannot our souls but
receive much hurt and spiritual detriment, if the beams of Gods favor be for
the shortest moment eclipsed from us. Hereof it is, that we are exhorted to
seek the Lord and his face, because in him, our Psalm. 105. 4.
life and strength, virtue and vigor chiefly consists. Seek the Lord and
Hos. 5. 15. Psalm. 106. 4.
his strength, seek his face evermore: And therefore no sooner was David
moved to perform this duty, but presently he undertakes it, as being above
all other things most pleasant and profitable. When thou saydest Psalm. 27. 8.
(says he) Seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee; Thy face, Lord, will I
Verse. 9.
seek. And hence it is, that if the Lord did never so little estrange
himself, he does so earnestly pray that he would not hide his face from him;
and cries out as a man utterly forlorn and forsaken of all hope and comfort,
My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? why art thou so far Psalm. 22. 1.
from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? And contrariwise, when he
inioyed Gods face and favor, he thought himself much more happy, then in the
fruition of all earthly blessings. There are many (says he) that say, Who will
show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance Psalm. 4. 6, 7.
upon us. Thou have put gladness in my heart, more then in the time that their
corn and wine increased. Now the means whereby we may preserve and assure
unto our selves, the face, favor, and loving countenance of God, is daily to
strive and labor after greater perfection in all spiritual graces, and in the
duties of his service; as to know him more perfectly, to believe in him more
assuredly, to love him more entirely, to fear him more reverently, to trust in
him more firmly, to hope in him more cheerfully and patiently, to call upon
him more devoutly and fervently, to hear his Word more attentively, and to
perform all the duties of piety, righteousness, and sobriety, more sincerely
and diligently then we did the day before. And if we thus labor and endeavor
to please God in all things, we shall be sure of his favor, and
notwithstanding our manifold infirmities, he will shine upon us with the light
of his countenance, and graciously accept, and be well pleased with us in the
face of his Beloved, and our Mat. 3. 17.
only Savior Jesus Christ.

CAP. V.
Of the right manner of seeking God, so as we may be sure to find him: and of
the benefits which arise from it.

. Sect. 1 That we must seek God first and principally, seasonably and
constantly,
AND these are the things which are required to this duty of seeking God daily.
The second point propounded, was the Matthew. 6. 33.
manner how he is to be thus sought of us. In which respect, we are to seek
him rightly, according to the direction of his Word. Wherein is required,
first, that we seek God first and principally, that is, above all things in
the world, more highly esteeming him in our judgments, more often thinking on
him in our meditations, more fervently cleaving unto him, in our hearts, wills,
and affections, more diligently seeking his grace and favor in all our
actions, then the greatest excellencies that heaven or earth can afford unto
us. Secondly, we must seek him first in time, and before all other things, as
men use to seek first things chiefly necessary, profitable, and of greatest
value and excellency, and when they have any spare time, things of less use,
vtility, or worth; as treasures, before lumber; means of life, food,
apparel, liberty and peace, before superfluities and such things, as serve
only for ornament and delight. Thirdly, we must seek him in the opportune,
seasonable, and acceptable time when he may be found, that is, whilst the day
of salvation lasts, and whilst yet God offreth unto us his grace and favor,
and still vouchsafes unto us his holy Ordinances, that seeking, we may find
him in them. Yea, whilst God bids us seek his face, and even as soon as the
word is come out of his mouth, our hearts must answer, Thy face, O Lord, will
I seek. So the Lord by his Prophet Psalm. 27. 8.
exhorts us: Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while
he is near: And the Church and people of God persuade one another; Esa. 55. 6.
Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts,
and Zach. 8. 21.
I will go also. We must seek the Bridegroom when he is come into his
Garden, and inuiteth us to feast with him in his spiritual delicacies. And
whilst he knocks at the door of our hearts with the finger of his Spirit, and
calls unto us by the ministry of his Word, saying, Open unto me, Cant. 5.
1, 2.
my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: We must not give him a comeagaine,
nor put him off with slight excuses; lest he punish our sloth, by withdrawing
himself and the comforts of his Spirit from us; and because we would not open
when he knocked, nor answer when he called, he make us to knock, and call
and cry, before he will hear us, and to seek him with sorrow, before he will
be found of us, that so he may make us afterward to esteem more of his
gracious offers, and to make more precious account of his comfortable presence,
when he does again vouchsafe it unto us; which we did not greatly value, when
as we might have inioyed it with ease and pleasure. Now the most seasonable
time of seeking God, are the days of our youth, and when with good Josias we
seek him 2. Chro. 34. 3.
in our tender age, for he seeks him best and most acceptably, that seeks
him soonest and with best speed. Which if we have neglected, then the best
time of seeking him is the time present, and while yet the sound of his voice
in the ministry of his Word ringeth in our ears, calling us to turn from our
sins, and return unto him. For whilst God seeks us in his holy
ordinances, it is fit time of seeking him, neither is the acceptable time and
day of salvation past, whilst yet the light of the Gospel shines 2. Cor. 6.
2.
unto us, and therefore to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
Psalm. 95. 7, 8.
heart. But if we neglect this time, and let Christ go away, through our
profaneness or slothful negligence, he will say unto us as he did unto the
Jews; Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, thither ye
Ioh. 7. 34.
cannot come. And finally, as in respect of the time, we must seek him
seasonably, so also constantly, that is, continually, and to the end of our
lives, when as having full fruition of him, we shall be secure in his presence,
and without fear of losing him. We must seek him, not only in the day of
adversity and affliction, when we most sensibly apprehend our need of Esa.
26. 16.
him: for this may be performed by the greatest hypocrites, and the most
despisers of his grace at other times; but also in the time of our prosperity,
when carnal reason would persuade us, that having all things at our hearts
desire, we have less need to sue and seek unto him. Not only when he
shows his glory and greatness upon extraordinary occasions, as by terrible
thunder, lightning, earthquakes, and such like; which caused the rebellious
Israelites to seek him, when they had formerly rejected 1. Sam. 12.
him; but we must continue this duty at all times, according to that wish of
the Lord, in the behalf of the Israelites; O that there were Deuteronomy. 5. 29.
such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep my Commandments
always, etc.

. Sect. 2 That we must seek God in Jesus Christ, sincerely, zealously, and
with all diligence.
And after this manner we ought to seek God, in respect of the time; in
respect of the person in whom we must seek him, it must be in the face of his
Anointed, and the alone mediation of Jesus Christ, the Son of his love, in
whom only he will be found of us. For if we seek him in our own merits,
works, and worthiness, we shall, in regard of their imperfections and
corruptions, be more estranged from him. In respect of our selves who are the
seekers, we must seek him, if we mean to find him, after a right manner;
first, sincerely and uprightly, with all our hearts and souls, wills and
affections. So David exhorts the Princes of Israel, to set their hearts and
souls to seek the Lord their God. And herein propounds 1. Chro. 22. 19.
Psalm. 119. 10.
himself, as an example for our imitation, professing that with his whole
heart he had sought the Lord. Thus Asa and the people of Judah entered into a
covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers, with all their heart, 1 Chro.
15. 12. and 22. 9.
and with all their soul. Which sincere seeking only has the promise of
finding him; according to that in Deuteronomie, If from thence thou shall Deuteronomy.
4. 29.
seek the Lord thy God, thou shall find him; if thou seek him with all thine
heart, and with all thy soul. And so the Lord promises the people of Judah,
that if in the land of their captivity they would seek the Lord, they Ier. 29.
13.
should find him, if they should search for him with all their heart.
Secondly, we must seek the Lord, not coldly and formally, as though we were
careless whether we found him or not, but zealously, and with all
earnestness, as being the chief thing which we desire. And as the covetous
man neglects his meat, that he may get money; and the famished man money,
that he may get meat to satisfy his hunger: so must we covet and hunger after
Gods presence, and labor to enjoy his face and favor, more then to enjoy all
our earthly desires. And this feruencie of affection in seeking God, is in most
lively manner expressed in the example of the Spouse in the Canticles, seeking
her Bridegroom, who like a woman ravished with Cant. 5.
the excellencies of her Lover, and even mad with love, has her heart so fixed
on him, that she can rest neither night nor day; but even in her bed where she
should sleep, her mind runs on him, and between sleeping and waking, up
she starteth to let him in whom her soul loves; of which hope, when she
finds her self frustrate, by his withdrawing himself, she calls unto him,
and seeks for him; and having neither answer, nor desired success, she
runs about the streets of the City, even in the night, and enquireth of the
Watchmen, and every one she met (as though the heat of love, had made her to
cast off the Veil of modesty) if they could tell her no tidings of her
Beloved; being never at rest till she had found him, and had again gotten him
within her imbracements. Finally, unto this feruency in affection, we must
join diligence in action, indeuouring and laboring in the use of all good
means, whereby we may find God, and be more and more assured of his grace
and favor. For unto this sedulity in seeking God, are the promises made; and
the Apostle tells us, that he is a bountiful rewarder of them that
diligently seek him. As therefore they who have lost some precious jewel
wherein their Heb. 11. 6.
chief wealth consists, do not content themselves with a slight search, but
set all other business aside to seek it, and are so intent and wholly taken up
with their employment, that they can scarce find any time to sit down and
rest them, yea to eat, drink or sleep, till they have found it; and have all
their thoughts so intent upon this one thing which they have in hand, that they
mind not what is spoken or done in other matters; so must we use the like or
greater diligence in seeking God, who is of infinite more value then all the
Jewels of the world. And if David was so wholly intent in preparing a visible
place of Gods presence, that he protests to neglect all other things in
comparison of it; as that he would not come into the tabernacle of his Psalm.
132. 3, 4, 5.
house, nor go up into his bed; nor give sleep unto his eyes, nor slumber
unto his eye-liddes, until he might find a place for the Lord, an habitation
for the mighty God of Jacob: then how much more should we be diligent and
earnest above all things in seeking God, that we may have him to reside and
dwell with us in the temple of our hearts?

. Sect. 3 Of the fruits and benefits which we enjoy by our daily seeking of God.
The third point to be considered, is the manifold fruits and benefits which
they receive and enjoy who thus daily seek God. For first, they Psalm. 69. 6.
shall not be confounded by any shame, nor with the malice and might of all
their enemies, according to that of the Psalmist, Let not those that seek
thee, be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. Their infirmities shall not
be laid to their charge, nor their imperfections, corruptions and failings in
performing the duties of Gods service; as appears by the prayer of Hezechias
for them, who had prepared their hearts to seek God, 2. Chro. 30. 18, 19.
whom God pardoned, though they were not cleansed according to the purification
of the Sanctuary. They shall not lose their labor, nor spend their strength in
vain; for the Lord has promised that those who thus seek him, shall surely
find him. If thou seek the Lord thy God, thou shall find him, Esa. 45. 19.
if thou seek him with all thine heart. So Azariah tells Asa and the people,
that the Lord would be with them, while they were with him: and if Deuteronomy. 4.
29. 1. Chro. 28. 9. 2. Chro. 15. 2. verse 4.
they sought him, he would be found of them; the which he confirms by the
experience which their fathers had hereof in former times, even as afterward
they found the Word of God in his mouth confirmed in their own experience; for
no sooner did they set themselves to seek the Lord with their whole desire,
but he was found of them, and the Lord gave them rest round verse. 15.
about. And as we shall by seeking God be freed from all evil, so shall we
have the fruition of all good; for we shall enjoy God himself, and he will
dwell in us as in his Temple, and communicate himself unto us as unto his love
and Spouse. Neither will he come empty-handed, but bring with him his rich
rewards: and as he is infinitely good in himself, so will he be good unto
them that wait for him, and to the soul that seeks him. He Heb. 11. 6.
will not let any good thing be wanting unto them. They shall receive the
blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of their salvation.
They Psalm. 34. 10. Psalm. 24. 4, 5, 6. 2. Chro. 31. 21.
shall prosper in all their works, be preserved from all dangers, and
delivered from all evil; for the hand of the Lord is upon them for good that
seek Ezra. 8. 22.
him, but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. He will
Psalm. 9. 10.
not forsake them; but will hide them in the day of his anger. They shall Zeph.
2. 3.
receive spiritual growth in all graces, through the beams of his
brightness, and the sweet influences of his favor, as the herbs and trees
receive growth and become fruitful, by the virtue of the Sun that shines upon
them. Yea, themselves shall be as the shining light, that shines more and Pro.
4. 18.
more to the perfect day; and in his light they shall see light, and be
admitted to the sight and contemplation of his secret counsels. They shall have
their faith and affiance in God more and more confirmed, through that
familiarity and communion which they have with him; and having peace with God,
they shall have also peace of conscience, and peace with all the creatures.
They shall have safety and Christian security in Gods presence, favor, and
protection, and he will give them rest on all sides, because they 2. Chro. 14.
7.
have sought the Lord their God. So as they may say with David; I will not be
affraide of ten thousand of people that have set themselves against me round
Psalm. 3. 5.
about. Though I walk through the vale of the shadow of death, I will fear
Psalm. 23. 4.
no evil: for thou, Lord, art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
God Psalm. 46. 1, 2.
is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble; therefore will
not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be cast
into the midst of the sea, etc. And in the greatest garboyles of worldly
troubles, they may say with him, I will both lay me down and sleep, for
thou, Psalm. 4. 8.
Lord, only make me dwell in safety. They shall have their hearts filled
with joy and gladness in the fruition of his favor, and shall, above all
others, have continual cause of rejoicing; according to that of the Psalmist,
Let all those that seek thee, rejoice and be glad in thee, and let all such as
love Psalm. 70. 4.
thy salvation, say continually, Let God be magnified. And again: Glory ye in
his holy name, let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. They shall
Psalm. 105. 3. 2. Cor. 1. 12.
lead an holy and unblameable life, when as they are always taken up in these
pious exercises, and attain daily unto more and more perfection in all saving
graces, and in the performance of all Christian duties. Yea, they shall have
not only abundance of grace and all Spiritual good in this life, but also of
glory in the life to come. For they that seek God now, shall then perfectly
find him, and with him eternal blessedness in the fruition of the chief
goodness, according to that of the Prophet David: They that seek the Lord
with their whole heart, are blessed; for John 17. 3. Psalm. 16. 11. Psalm. 119.
2. Amos 5. 4, 6.
they shall live the life of Grace here, and the life of glory in the world to
come.

. Sect. 4 Of the evils which follow our neglect of seeking God.
Finally, the evils and mischiefs are manifold which follow the neglect of
this duty of seeking God: for Gods power and wrath is against them, to Ezra 8.
22.
bring upon them the punishment of their neglect. He will withdraw from such
his comfortable presence; and by grievous afflictions enforce upon them this
duty, which they will not do cheerfully and of their own accord, according
to that in Hosea: I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge
their offense and seek my face; in their afflictions they will Hos. 5. 15.
seek me early. They shall not prosper in any thing which they do or take
Ier. 10. 21.
in hand, as the Lord threateneth the brutish pastors of Judah. And as the
flowers and plants cannot thrive and flourish, which enjoy not the light and
warmth of the Sun: so much less shall they prosper and grow in grace or
goodness, who neglect to seek God, and so deprive themselves of the
comfortable beams of his gracious presence. Finally, the Lord has threatened
to stretch out his hand, and take vengeance on them Zeph. 1. 6.
that have not sought the Lord, nor enquired for him; yea, that he will laugh
at their destruction, and delight himself in their punishments, as he
intimates, by comparing the day of vengeance to a day of solemn sacrifice,
unto which he inuiteth his ghests, that they may be spectatours of these
fearful examples, and glorify his Justice in the deserved punishments of
those who had not fought him.

CAP. VII.
Of the Christan Armor which we must put on daily, and of the benefits which
we shall reap thereby.

. Sect. 1 Of the several parts of the Christian armor.
WE have entreated the more largely of that maine duty of seeking God, as
being not only the chief and principal of all that are to be performed in
the daily exercise, but even the root and fountain, sum and substance of
all the rest from which they spring, and in which they are comprised. In which
respect the other that remain to be spoken of, may be passed over with greater
breuity, as being all but special branches of the former duty, and streams
that will readily and naturally flow from that fountain. The third maine duty
then in this daily exercise, is, that we put on the whole armor of God, which
is, that we look continually unto our selves, that we be thoroughly furnished,
and as it were, armed at all points with the maine, fundamental, sanctifying
and saving graces of Gods holy Spirit, whereby we may be enabled to stand in
the day of trial, and to resist those daily tentations wherewith we are
assaulted by our spiritual enemies. The chief and principal whereof, the
Apostle has in the Epistle to the Ephesians Ephesians. 6. 11, 12.
prescribed unto us. The first is, the girdle of verity; whereby is meant, that
we should not only embrace the truth of Religion, and frame our judgments,
affections and actions according to the sincere and pure Word of God; but also
that our knowledge, profession and practice, be in truth and sincerity of
heart, carrying our selves in all things uprightly, and in the integrity of a
good conscience. The second is, the brestplate of righteousness, whereby we
understand true sanctification and godliness, consisting in an earnest desire,
a firm resolution, and constant endeavor of conforming our whole lives
according to Gods revealed will, that we may please him in all things, and
have both our persons and actions accepted in his sight. The third is, that our
feet be shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace: that is, as
soldiers that have good shoes and leg-harnesse, are thereby enabled to hold
on their march in stony and rough ways, and through the midst of briers and
thorns; whereas if they were barefooted, or ill shod, they would be pricked
and gauled, and soon tire and faint in the way: So must we daily arm our
affections, the feet of our souls, with all the sweet comforts and gracious
promises of the Gospel, made unto those who hold out unto the end, and fight
until they overcome, without which we shall soon be wearied, and faint in the
way, seeing it is rough and unpleasant to flesh and blood, and full of the
thorns and briers of afflictions and persecutions. The fourth piece of the
Christian armor is, the shield of faith, which also we must daily put on,
applying afresh unto our selves Gods mercies in the merits of Christ, the
gracious promises of the Gospel, and the satisfaction and obedience of our
Savior and Redeemer, whereby, though we be never so weak in our own
strength, we shall be enabled to resist all Satan's tentations, and to quench
and beat back all the fiery darts of the wicked one, so as they shall not be
able to wound or do us any harm. The fifth piece which we must daily put on,
is, the helmet of salvation, that is, we must continually renew 1. These. 5. 8.
and revive our hopes, and expect and wait for with patience, the
accomplishment of all Gods gracious promises, which by faith we believe and
apprehend. And this will notably encourage us in all Christian duties of a
godly life, seem they never so irksome and tedious unto us, when as we have
daily an eye to the recompense of reward; and to endure any hard measure at the
hands of the world, and to drink the deepest draught in the cup of affliction
and persecution for Gods sake and the Gospels Act. 28. 10. Romans 8 18 2. Cor. 4.
17.
which we profess, when as we assuredly hope, that the greatest crosses and
calamities are not worthy the glory which shall be reueiled, because they are
light and momentanie; but the crown of happiness which they help to set upon
our heads, most excellent and eternal. The sixth and last piece, is, the sword
of the Spirit, the Word of God, which being rightly managed, is sufficient to
defend our selves, and offend and drive back the Enemy, as we see in the
example of our Savior Christ, who used no other weapon to vanquish Satan and
all his tenons. We must therefore daily exercise our selves in reading and
meditating in the holy Scriptures, which will serve as a light to guide us in
all our ways, as a goade in our sides, if we be sluggish; as cordial water,
if we be ready to faint with feebleness; and as a two-handed sword, to
defend us against all enemies who assault us in the way, and labor to hinder
and discourage us in our Christian course and conversation. And this armor we
must put on, not piecemeale, but complete and in all the parts. We must not
put on some parts only, and let other pieces of it lie by, but, as the Apostle
speaks, we must put on the whole armor Ephe. 6. 13.
of God; for if any part be wanting, we shall lie open to the wounds of our
spiritual enemies. Neither must we put it one day on, and leave it off
another, but we must put it on daily, seeing we are continually assaulted, and
have no one day of truce, till by death we have gotten a full and final
victory. It must not like armor in the time of peace lie by, or hang rusting
upon the walls; but we must always keep it bright and furbished, fit for
daily use, and fast buckled unto us both day and night, sleeping and waking,
seeing we are continually in the battle, encountered at all times, and even
every hour, with the tentations of our spiritual enemies. And to this end we
must continually keep the Christian watch, as the Apostle exhorts, Ephe. 6.
18.
that we be not through our sloth and sluggishnesse surprised at unawares. And
because it is not armor of our own making and providing, but of Gods own
workmanship, and of his free gift, whereof it is called, The Armor of God:
and seeing when we have it, it is not in our Verse. 10.
power to put it on, but it is God alone, that both bestows and buckleth it
unto us; therefore unto our watchfulness, we must add fervent and daily
prayer unto God, both to give it unto us, and to assist us so with his holy
Spirit, that we may be enabled, not only to put it on, but also to keep it
continually fast buckled unto us. Neither let us fear that the daily and
continual wearing of it will be tedious and troublesome; for though at the
first it may seem so, when like fresh water Soldiers we enter into the
Christian warfare; yet by daily use, it will become so easy and familiar, that
it will trouble us no more then our ordinary apparel.

. Sect. 2 That the putting on the Christian Armor is very necessary.
Now that we may be moved with cheerfulness to exercise our selves in this
daily duty, let us consider that the continual putting on and wearing of this
Armor, is both exceeding necessary and profitable. It is most necessary,
because the spiritual enemies of our salvation are always in readiness,
watching their opportunity, when by their fiery assaults they may vanquish us,
and bring us to destruction. And therefore it is as necessary that we should
use like or greater diligence, and be always in readiness to withstand their
encounters. Secondly, this daily use of the Christian Armor is so necessary,
that all other helps are in vain, if this be neglected. For though we should
be continually exercised in religious duties, as prayer, hearing the Word,
reading, conference and meditation; and in the works of justice and charity,
and the ordinary duties of our callings; yet if this Armor be not put on, they
will do us no good, seeing they will not be done in truth and sincerity, faith
and a good conscience: and therefore even in them our spiritual enemies will
set snares to catch us, and finding us naked of our Christian Armor, will lay
secret ambushments, even in these religious and charitable exercises, and
assaulting us at unawares, will give us the foil, and lead us captive unto
sin.

. Sect. 3 Of the manifold benefits which arise from being thus daily armed.
Secondly, it is most profitable to be thus daily armed, as may appear by the
manifold fruits and benefits which will accrue unto us by it. For hereby we
shall be strengthened against all the assaults of all our spiritual enemies,
so as they shall never be able to prevail against us, but at last be
vanquished and overcome. And therefore has God made for us, and given unto us
this spiritual Armor, and to this end he exhorts us to put it daily on, that
we may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, Ephesians. 6. 11,
13.
to stand against the wiles of the devil, and all encounters and attempts of
the enemies of our salvation. Therefore has he put into our hands, not carnal
weapons, which are far unfitting this spiritual warfare, but such as are
mighty through God, to the pulling down of strong holds, and casting down 2.
Cor. 10. 4, 5.
imaginations, and every high thing, that exalts it self against the
knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
Christ. And therefore we may be assured that God will not be disgraced with the
weakness of his workmanship, nor fail of his end for which he has made
it, and so spend his labor in vain: but seeing he has made it, and put it
into our hands for Armor of high proof, let us assure our selves that it will
never fail, but will at all times be sufficient to beat back the bullets of
Satan's tentations, and to defend us against the assaults of all our spiritual
enemies. Again, if we daily put on this Armor, it will make us valiant and
courageous, seeing before the fight it assures us of victory. Whereas, though
we have never so much valor and fortitude, yet if we be but naked men, and so
lie open to be wounded continually with the fiery darts of the devil, our
courage will be soon cooled, and like cowards, we shall betake our selves to a
shameful flight. It will make us cheerful in our pilgrimage, and to go on
in the ways of godliness and righteousness with much joy and comfort; when
as being armed, we shall not need to fear any spiritual thieves that lie
lurking in the way to rob us of Gods graces, nor to go out of the right way,
either to the right hand or to the left, for any worldly terror or
discouragement which shall affront us in our course of Christianity. It will
preserve us from falling into such sins as will wound our souls and
consciences, and strengthen us also against our frailties and infirmities, so
as they shall not prevail against us. It will be a notable means to continue
us in peace; for as nothing more preserves our worldly peace, then to be
continually prepared for war; so nothing brings unto us a more sound and
secure peace, even peace with God, peace, of conscience, and peace also in
respect of the malicious attempts of our spiritual enemies, then to keep
daily this Armor fast buckled unto us. Finally, it will bring with it much
Christian security, when as we are assured that we are free from all danger,
and that none of our enemies shall be able to hurt us; so as we may lie down
in peace and take our rest, because the Lord only makes us Psalm. 4. 8.
(hereby) to dwell in safety.

. Sect. 4 That every several part of this Armor brings special profit.
And as the whole Armor in general brings unto us singular profit; so every
several piece and part of it is for special use and benefit. For by the
girdle of verity, we shall be preserved against all errors and heresies, and
keep a right course in the way of truth; and our hearts being upright and
sincere in the sight of God, we shall carry our selves as in his sight and
presence, in all our thoughts, words, and actions, and be kept safe from being
sowred with the leaven of hypocrisy; from lamenesse, which causes us to halt
between God and the world, and from guile and dissimulation, the poison of the
soul, which tainteth and infecteth all virtuous actions. By the brestplate of
righteousness, whereby we desire, resolve, and endeavor to do Gods will, and
please him in all things, our vital parts will be preserved from being
wounded with the poisonous darts of the devil; and howsoever with his
tentations he may make us slip through frailty and infirmity, and with his
hellish darts, inflict some little scratches in the more remote and ignoble
parts, yet he shall not be able to pierce our hearts and vital parts, with
any mortal wounds of sin, because they are strongly armed with this
breast plate of righteousness. By having our feet shod with the preparation of
the Gospel of peace, we shall be enabled to continue our march in the Christian
warfare, and so prepared against all afflictions and troubles, which like
thorns and briers molest us in our journey, that we shall not be discouraged,
nor faint in the way; but by that inward peace which the Gospel brings unto
us, we shall be confirmed and comforted in the midst of all worldly
garboyles and troubles. By the shield of faith we shall repel the fiery darts
of Satan's 1. Pet. 5. 8.
tentations, and resist and beat him back when he assaulteth us with greatest
fury; we shall also thereby overcome the world, on the one side 1. Ioh. 5. 4.
tempting us with the wages of earthly vanities, by contemning it in comparison
of heavenly happiness, of which faith assures us; and on the other side,
threatening and terrifying us with crosses and afflictions, whilst it receives
them as tokens of Gods love, and signs of our adoption, and persuades us that
they shall work together for the best, and serve as Romans 8. 28.
means to further our salvation. By the helmet of salvation, we are also
notably strengthened in the spiritual conflict, so as though Satan the old
Serpent may bite and bruize our heel, yet he shall not be able to hurt our
Head; we are also thereby encouraged to labor diligently after
sanctification, and having hope of inioying with Christ heavenly happiness, it
is a notable means to move us to purge and purify our selves, 1. Ioh. 3. 2.
as he also is pure. Finally, we are encouraged to fight valiantly the Lords
battles, by assured hope of victory; and to pass with patience and comfort
throughout all worldly discouragements, because we expect, that after we have
travailed through a little spot of foul way, we shall come safely to a Palace
of pleasure, and to all the joys of our heavenly Country. Lastly, by the
sword of the Spirit, if we can skilfully use it, we shall be fitted for all
purposes, strengthened against all enemies, overcome all difficulties, answer
all objections, repel all tentations: Yea, such a glorious light comes from
this glittering weapon, that it is sufficient, not only to defend us, and
beat down (like that light which appeared to Saul Act 9.
and his company) with fear and astonishment all our enemies, but to guide and
direct us in all our ways, and to make us perfect and wise for attaining unto
salvation. 2. Tim. 3. 15, 17.


CAP. VIII.
Of the fourth main daily duty, which is to arm our selves against all sin,
and to deuote our selves wholly to Gods service.

. Sect. 1 That we must necessarily arm our selves against all sin, and the
reasons of it.
THe fourth main duty, daily to be performed, is to arm and strengthen our
selves daily against sin; and deuote our souls and bodies wholly to Gods
service, in the performance of all Christian duties which may be pleasing in
his sight. Concerning the former: It is most necessary that we continually
arm our selves against sin, and gather daily new strength, to withstand and
mortify our corruptions. First, because Satan like a roaring 1. Pet. 5. 8.
Lion, walks continually about, seeking to devour us, laying at all times
and in all places, his nets and snares of perdition, and many baits of worldly
vanities, and seals of evil examples, to allure us to stoop and give over
our heavenly flight, that so he may catch and ensnare us to our destruction.
Secondly, because the world, as a strong enemy, daily joins with him,
laboring one while with her smiles and favors; her allurements and proffers
of prosperity, to entice us to follow those patterns and precedents of evil,
which she sets before us; and another while with frowns and threats,
afflictions and persecutions, to thrust us by main force into sin. Thirdly,
because we nourish continually a secret traitor in our bosoms, which is daily
ready to betray us into their hands, even our own flesh and corrupt nature,
which is prone to all evil, and takes delight in nothing more then in
glutting it self with the pleasures of sin. So that no sooner do we give
over fighting, but we are presently foiled; no sooner do we desist rowing and
tugging against the stream of our natural corruptions, but they presently
carry us down with a swift course, into some one or other sinful action.
Fourthly, because many are the wiles and deceits of sin, which will easily
circumuent us, if we do not daily observe and labor to defeat them. One
while they will pretend friendship, and that they will do us good; or at
least, that they are innocent, and will not hurt us; and at another time
necessity, that we cannot live without them, or if we do, a life no better
then death, vncheerefull and uncomfortable. Sometime they will plead custom
and prescription, which enters them into possession (as it were) by course of
Law. And if we can answer this, they will offer themselves like ghests,
craving but one nights lodging, with promise then to be gone: but afterward
when they are admitted, either by force take possession, or else upon further
acquaintance and better liking, desire to make longer abode. Lastly, because
the occasions of sin daily are many, as the objects of unlawful pleasures,
which bewitch us with their alluring tunes, and of sinful gain and profit,
which like golden chains, draw us into wicked courses; and of pride and
vainglory, which easily persuade us, who are naturally ambitious, to use any
means which may further our advancement. Unto which, we may add the daily
occasions of unjust anger, thrusting us on to revenge; of envy or disdain; of
wantonness and uncleanness; of vain, unsavory, and rotten communication,
through sinful society and wicked company, and innumerable such others; all
which will powerfully draw us to sin, if we be not daily armed against it.
In all which respects, it is most necessary that we arm our selves, and make
daily war against all our sins, especially against those which clean
fastest to our corrupt natures, and unto which we are most prone and apt to
fall. Of which we may take the better and surer notice, if we consider what
they were, which before our conversion did most reign and rule in us, seeing
these in the state of regeneration, though they be deposed from their regency,
yet will, of all others be most hardly expelled; or being in some measure
driven out, yet out of their experience of their former victories, will
conceive hope of repossessing their wonted hold, and to this end will lurk and
honer about us, that they may spy opportunity of re-entring, like Crows and
other birds of prey, which are beaten off a field, where they have long used to
feed. As also if we observe what are those sins which our corruption most
likes and longs after, and is most ready to extenuate and excuse, when we
are touched and reproved for them, making them light and venial, by gilding
them over with vain, frivolous, or false pretenses. And finally, we may know
them by our own lamentable experience, when as we carefully observe what
sins most distract us in all good exercises, and hinder our growth in
godliness; and what they be, into which, through frailty we most often fall,
and whereby we have been most overtaken. And when we have by these means
taken notice of them, we must with most diligence and resolution arm our
selves against them; seeing by them we have most dishonored God, and wounded
our own consciences, and are in greatest danger to be overcome, and led
captive to hell and destruction, being like bordering enemies, which have a
strong party in our selves, and have best opportunity to take all advantages
against us.

. Sect. 2 Of the means to work in our hearts a true hatred of sin.
Now the means whereby we may be armed against all sins in general, and
these in particular, are many. The first and principal, is to work our hearts
to a deadly and unreconcilable hatred against them, by meditating of the
infinite Majesty and goodness of God, against whom they are committed, how
great and glorious he is in himself, and how good and gracious unto us, who
has given us all the good things which we enjoy or hope for, yea his chiefest
Jewel, his best beloved Son to die for us: By considering that it is above
all things most hateful and displeasing unto God, and makes all creatures in
whom it is most odious, though never so much beloved of him; As we see in the
example of the rejected Jews; Adam cast out of Paradise, the Son of God
himself, who bearing our sins, did bear all his Fathers wrath, and could
not be reconciled, till by his sufferings he had made full satisfaction to his
Justice. That it is most heinous and capital, being committed against so
infinite a Majesty, as appears by those dreadful and eternal punishments,
which Gods righteous judgment inflicteth on those that commit it, in this
world and the world to come, that it is the greatest folly in the world,
hazarding the eternal salvation of our most precious souls, which are of more
worth then many Monarchies, and plunging them into hell and everlasting
destruction, for the momentany and uncertain fruition of earthly vanities.
That it pierced the Lord of life, and nailed him to the Cross, causing him to
be condemned that came to save us, and to be put to a shameful death, who came
to give unto us everlasting life. That the deep dye of it so stained our
souls, that nothing could wash away the filthy spots that it left behind it,
but the precious blood of Christ. That it vexes and grieueth the good Spirit
of God dwelling in us, and by defiling our bodies and souls which are his
Temples, does make him weary of his lodging. That above all things it
delights the devil, as being the child and darling of this hellish parent;
and makes us to become fit rooms for him to revel in, and to pass his time
with most delight. Let us consider of the manifold evils which it causes unto
us, both privative and positive, in this life and in the life to come. For it
depriueth us of all good, and brings with it all evil. It separateth
between our God and us, and turns the greatest love into the most dangerous
enmity. It defaceth his Image in us, and stampeth upon us the image of the
devil. It frustrateth the end of our creation, which was, to glorify God, by
our worshipping and serving him, yea of our Redemption by Christ, if we live
and die in it without repentance. It casts us (like out-lawes) out of Gods
protection, and makes us (like slaves) subject to the tyranny of Satan. It is
the cause of all the evils of punishment, which are inflicted upon the
creatures in this life and the life to come. It blinds the mind, and
hardens the heart, debarreth us of all sweet communion with God, and
depriueth us of the inestimable comforts of his holy Spirit. It weakeneth our
faith, and wounds our conscience, takes away all inward peace, and fills
our hearts with shame and sorrow, and our faces with blushing, or (which is
worse) with impudency. It depriueth us of Gods eternal and most comfortable
presence, and of the joys of his heavenly Kingdom, and plungeth us headlong
into hell and destruction. Finally, let us add unto these, whatsoever other
evils we can imagine, and then conclude, that sin, as the cursed mother of
them all, has bred them in her hellish womb.

. Sect. 3 Of the means whereby we may be strengthened against sin.
And when by these meditations we have wrought our hearts unto a true hatred
of all sin; there are other means to be used of us, that we may be strongly
armed against it. As first, that we do thorowout the whole day entertain and
nourish good and holy desires, and firm and constant resolutions, that we will
resist and withstand it, in what manner or form so ever it shall set upon us.
For nothing will bring more easy and assured victory, then Christian courage
and resolution, to fight and strive against it, grounded not on our own
strength, but upon the power and promises of God, and that we will let pass no
good means unassayed whereby we may overcome. Secondly, we must keep a daily
and continual Pro. 4. 23. Heb. 3. 13.
watch over our selves, and especially over our hearts, that we be not
surprised on a sudden, nor hardened or hartened in any wicked course, through
the deceitfulness of sin; of which, we shall have occasion to speak more
fully hereafter. Thirdly, we must be no less careful in flying all
occasions, inducements, and prouocations unto sin, then the sinful acts
themselves; for if we wilfully cast our selves into these tentations, it is
just with God to deliver us unto evil. Fourthly, we must make conscience of
committing of the least sins, which being admitted, will make room for the
greatest; and withstand sins in the first degrees, as soon as they are
suggested by the devil, the world, or our own flesh; casting out this hellish
wildfire, before it has by the least abode inflamed our concupiscence, or
before this seed of impiety has gotten any warmth or growth. Fifthly, we must
be so bold and valorous in Gods assistance, as that in the mean time we be
suspicious and fearful, in respect of our own weakness and frailty, and
the might and malice of our innumerable Pro. 28. 13. 1. Cor. 10. 12. Phil. 2.
13.
enemies, taking good heed, whilst we stand, of falling, and working out our
salvation with fear and trembling. Sixthly, we must daily walk with God, and
carry our selves continually as in his sight and presence, who not only takes
notice of all our actions, but also will cause us one day to give a strict
account of them, either to reward them Genesis 5. 24. Genesis 17. 1. 2. Cor. 5. 10.
graciously, if they be good; or to punish them severely, if they be evil.
Lastly, let us daily and continually resign our selves over into the hands of
God, who is alone able to deliver us from all evil, and crave instantly his
protection from all enemies, and the direction of his holy Spirit, that by the
good guide thereof, we may thorowout the whole day be preserved and kept in the
way of righteousness and holiness, and from erring and going astray in the
bypath of sin.

. Sect. 4 That we must embrace all virtues and Christian duties.
And as we are thus daily to arm our selves against sin; so are we
constantly and continually to desire and resolve in our hearts, that we will
embrace all virtue, and perform all Christian duties, both unto God, our
neighbors and our selves, thorowout the whole day, not thinking any grace or
good duty so small, that it may be neglected, or so difficult and of such an
high nature, that it may not be attempted and sought after. Neither must we
content our selves to take the occasions of well-doing, when they are offered
and thrust upon us, but we must exercise our minds, by studying and aduising
how we may get and gain the best opportunities of doing most good, both for
the advancement of Gods glory, and our own and our neighbors good. But
especially we must set our selves with most earnest study, and serious
diligence to attain unto, and adorn our souls with those graces, wherein
they are most defective, and to perform those duties which our consciences
tell us that we have in time past most neglected, not because they were in
their own nature less excellent, profitable, or necessary (for so when time
and opportunity will not suffer us to perform all, we may omit lawfully those
duties which are of least use and importance) but because our corrupt natures
being most auerse unto them, we find them most difficult and unpleasant unto
us. For so shall we receive a double benefit, not only doing that which is
good, but also in doing it, profit daily in the denying of our selves and our
own wills, in the mortifying of our corrupt nature, in that wherein it is most
strong and rebellious, and in strengthening our regenerate part and new man, in
that wherein it is most weak and defective. And if we would thus daily
enlarge our desires, and strengthen our resolutions, to the embracing and
practicing of all virtuous actions and good duties, we should receive singular
profit by it. For we should not so easily as we do, let slip the occasions of
well doing, but take hold of the opportunity when it is offered; we should not
be so faint-hearted, and weake-handed in good duties, nor so easily daunted and
discouraged in them, but should become strong and valorous, if we would thus
daily confirm and strengthen our hearts and hands, by these good resolutions,
that we will let pass no opportunity of performing those Christian duties
which God requires of us. Finally, notwithstanding our many frailties and
infirmities in our best actions, and slips and falls into sin, we should be
accepted of God through Christ, in this Evangelical obedience, as though it
were free from all imperfection; seeing he respects more our hearts then our
hands, and our resolutions and endeavors, more then our abilities and
performances.

CAP. IX.
Of the fifth and sixth daily duties, which are to conform our selves to Gods
Law, and to submit our selves to his good pleasure.

. Sect. 1 That we must conform our thoughts, words, and actions, according to
Gods Law.
THe fifth maine duty wherein we are daily to exercise our selves, is, that we
rightly dispose of all our thoghts, words, and actions, so as they may in all
things be conformable Phil. 3. 20. Matthew. 6. 33. Col. 3. 2.
to the Law of God. In respect of our thoughts, our care must be, that we be
not earthly minded, like Citizens of the world, nor suffer them to be fixed and
fastened upon earthly and momentany vanities, which profit not; as how we may
get or keep the honors, riches, and pleasures of the world, by carnal and
unlawful means, which are too base objects for them which are of so high and
divine a nature; but that they be chiefly taken up, and exercised about
spiritual, holy, and heavenly things: as of their excellency, profit, and
necessity, by what means we may obtain, or having them in some measure, may
be more enriched with them; how we may safely keep them and be secured from
fear of losing them. How we may be more and more united unto Christ, and
assured that both he and all his benefits do belong unto us. How we are so to
carry our selves, that we may more sensibly and feelingly apprehend the power
and efficacy of his death and resurrection working in us, and replenishing our
hearts with Phil. 3. 10.
sweet consolations, and joy in the holy Ghost. How we may be daily more
assured of Gods grace and favor, and feel and discern the light and warmth
of his loving countenance shining upon us, and inflaming our hearts with his
love. How we may withstand tentations, and get mastery over our strongest
corruptions; and how we may daily be more renewed and strengthened in all
grace and goodness, that we may increase in bringing forth more fruits of
holiness and righteousness. And with these and such like holy and heavenly
meditations, our minds must chiefly be taken up; and when we exercise them
about earthly things, and the duties of our callings, it must be, as upon
means which tend to these ends, and (like birds) we must use the earth as a
help to raise up our selves, and to gather wing, that we may soar aloft in
heavenly meditations. The which we shall do, if we perform the works of our
callings, in faith and a good conscience, in love and obedience unto God, as
duties of his service which he has required at our hands, with prayer for
good success and thanksgiving, when by Gods blessing we have obtained it;
and when we use them as means to further our maine ends, namely, the
advancement of Gods glory, and the eternal salvation of our souls.

. Sect. 2 Of the right ordring of our tongues, and the means of it.
The like care and endeavor we must daily use in the right ordering of our
tongues and speeches, either by seasonable silence, when wisdom, discretion,
and gravity requires it; of which, the general rule is, that it is better to
forbear and say nothing, then to vent that which is vain, unprofitable, or
worse then silence: or else by speaking that which is useful and necessary for
the advancement of our maine ends, which are Gods glory, the profit of our
brethren, and the comfort and salvation of our own souls. God is glorified by
our speech, when as we do not presume to speak of him, his attributes and
persons, his name, Word or works, upon any light or slight occasion, vainly
or in jest; but when the cause is weighty and important, and then gravely and
seriously, with all humility and due reverence. Our neighbor is profited, when
as our speech is Col. 4. 6.
gracious, powdered with the salt of wisdom, and either tending to spiritual
edification, by instruction, admonition, exhortation, reprehension, Ephe. 4. 29.
counsel or comfort; or to his temporal good in his worldly affairs. And
our own comfort and salvation is furthered, when unto these former we add
such speeches as more properly tend to our own good, as to the increasing of
our wisdom and knowledge, the strengthening of our faith, the increasing of
any other saving grace; as when we mutually inform one another, and stir up
the graces of God in us by holy conferences; or else such as are profitable in
respect of our temporal estate, as about the ordinary businesses of our
callings and earthly affairs, in which we are daily conversant. Now that we
may thus rule our tongues, and order our speeches in this holy manner,
abstaining from all light and vain words, frivolous and unprofitable
discourses, and rotten and unsavory communication; let us consider, that God
has given us this excellent gift of speech that we might thereby glorify
him, and benefit one another, especially in the best things: and therefore they
who neglect these, and direct their speech to contrary ends, do most
fearfully abuse this excellent gift, and thereby justly deserve to be deprived
of it. Secondly let us consider, that God is always present with us, and is an
eare-witnesse of all our speeches; and therefore let us blush for shame, to
speak any thing in his hearing, which we would not utter in the presence of a
grave, wise and religious superior. Thirdly, let us continually remember that
fearful saying of our Savior, that we shall give an account of every idle
word at the day of Judgment, and that by our words we shall either Mat. 12.
36, 37.
be justified or condemned. And therefore let us not vainly and causelessly
increase our accounts, not only by idle and unprofitable, but rotten and
unsavory speeches, nor use this wind of words, as bellows to kindle against
our selves the flame of Gods wrath here, and the fire of hell in the life to
come. And to this purpose let us with the Prophet David, take heed Psalm. 39. 1.
to our ways, that we offend not with our tongue, and considering that it is
an unruly evil, and as the Apostle James compares it, like an headstrong Iam.
3. 3, 4.
Horse, that will stand on no ground, let us break it with the terrors of
Gods Judgments, and curb it in with the bridle of his fear, that it may not
rush into any unprofitable and wicked speeches. And because we cannot by all
our force and skill, care and watchfulness, tame this wild and unruly beast,
but that it will break out and utter such things as are either vain and
vselesse, or hurtful and sinful, let us often desire the Lord who gave us our
tongues, that he will by his grace and holy spirit, rule and order them, and
that he will set a watch before our mouths, and keep the door Psalm. 141. 3.
of our lips, that we may speak only those things which may tend to Gods
glory and the mutual good of one another.

. Sect. 3 Of the right ordering of our works and actions.
Finally, our daily care and endeavor must be, rightly to order and dispose of
all our works and actions, that they may be conformable to the Law of God,
both in doing the duties which he has commanded, and in leaving undone the
vices and sins which he has forbidden and condemned, and that whether they
respect God or our neighbors and our selves. For our time and strength must be
spent either in the religious duties of Gods service, or in the works of
justice, charity and mercy toward our neighbors, or of temperance, sobriety
and Holiness toward our selves; either in the general duties of
Christianity, or the special duties of our callings, or in using the means
and helps whereby we may be the better fitted and enabled unto all and every
of them: That so we may Matthew. 5. 16. 1. Cor. 10. 31. 2. Pet. 1. 10. Ephe. 4.
1.
glorify our heavenly Father, by having the light of our godly lives shining
before men, edify our brethren by our good example, make our own calling and
election sure, walk worthy of our high calling, adorn our profession, gain
others to the profession and practice of the true Religion, and by our
fruitfulness of obedience obtain a plentiful harvest of joy and happiness,
when Christ shall come to Judgment, and render unto every one according to
their works. Neither must we only take care, that our minds and hearts be
taken up and furnished with good thoughts and holy affections, and our tongues
exercised in Christian communication, and speeches sauouring of grace and
godliness; but also that we bring them to good effect, by practizing what we
think and speak, in all our works and actions. Nor that we mortify sin
in our souls and affections, but also in our earthly members, Col. 3. 5.
and outward man; and if through frailty we have entertained into our minds
and hearts sinful thoughts and desires, or broken out into rash and
inconsiderate speeches; yet at least, let us stay here, and not produce it
into act, which is to give this cursed birth full growth and strength, and to
consummate and bring it to full maturity and perfection. Jam. 1. 14, 15.


. Sect. 4 Of the sixth maine duty, which is, to submit our selves to Gods good
pleasure in all things.
The sixth maine duty which we are daily to perform, is, to submit our selves
in all things to Gods good will and pleasure, and to resign our Romans 5. 3.
souls, bodies and states to be governed and guided by his providence, without
murmuring or repining, being contented with whatsoever he sends, and to
endure what he inflicteth, not only with meekness and patience, but also
with cheerfulness and spiritual joy, of which we have the Apostle Paul an
example for our imitation, who had learned in all estates to be content, so
that he could be abased and abound, full and hungry, yea was able to do all
things, through the help of Christ that strengthened him. Phil. 4. 11. 12.
To the attaining of which contentation, we are to consider, that the Lord is
infinitely wise, and knows what is better for us then we our selves, infinite
Matthew. 6. 32.
in power, and able to do that which in his wisdom he knows to be best, and
infinite in goodness, mercy and compassion toward us, and therefore that he
will do that unto us and for us, which in his wisdom he knows most
profitable, especially for the eternal salvation of our souls. That by his
providence he rules all things in heaven and earth, and most wisely and
powerfully directs them to the good of all that depend upon him, that in an
especial manner he does thereby watch over them that fear and trust in him,
and will not suffer them to want any Psalm. 34. 9.
thing that is good. Finally, we are to remember his gracious promises, whereby
he has assured us, that he will turn all things, even our troubles Romans 8.
28. Psalm. 84. 11.
and afflictions, unto our good; that he will be a Sun and a Shield, and will
give grace and glory, and withhold no good thing from them that walk
uprightly; that if we first seek the Kingdom of God and his righteousness,
he will Matthew. 6. 33. Heb. 13. 5.
give us all other things as advantages to the bargain. Unto which, if we add
the consideration of Gods infallible Truth in making good all his gracious
promises, we may well be contented in all estates, seeing he will never fail
nor forsake us, as the Apostle speaks. And lastly, if we would have this
contentation in all estates, we must cast our eye as well upon that which we
have, as upon that which we want; and think upon those innumerable blessings
which we enjoy, the least whereof we have not deserved, as well as upon those
things wherein we are defective: we must not so much look upon those few that
are preferred before us, as upon those multitudes that come far behind us,
who want many of those good things which we possess, though it may be, they
have deserved them better then we. And if by these and the like means we
nourish this contentation, then shall we have a salve in readiness fit for
all sores, a medicine against all maladies; and cordial water which will
revive and comfort us against all those qualmes of earthly discouragements,
that hinder our proceedings in the ways of godliness, and make the service of
God displeasant and irksome unto us. We shall go on cheerfully and joyfully
in our Christian course, without murmuring and repining, when we find a foul
passage or stumbling blocks in our way; and the better please God in all
things, when as in all things we are well pleased with him.

CAP. X.
Of the last maine duty of the daily exercise, which is Prayer.

. Sect. 1 That we must pray daily and continually.
THe last daily duty to be performed of us, is, effectual and fervent prayer,
from which not any day, nor any part of the 1. These. 5. 17. Ephe. 6. 18. Luke
18. 1. and 21. 36. 2. Tim. 4. 2.
day is to be exempted; for we must, as the Apostle speaks, pray without
ceasing, always watching thereunto with all perseverance. To which end tends
the parable of the unrighteous Judge, propounded by our Savior Christ. In
which regard, that may be said of prayer, which the Apostle requires in
preaching, namely, that it must be done in season and out of season; if at
least any time may be said unseasonable for this holy duty; whereby we are not
to understand with those ancient Heretics, that we must spend our whole time
in prayer and do nothing else; for the Apostle Paul himself spent much of his
time in preaching, writing, disputing, and in other duties of his calling, and
yet as he exhorted others, so he often professes, that it was his own
practice to pray continually and without ceasing. And our Savior Christ also,
who requires this at our hands, and propounded Romans 1. 9. Col. 1. 3. Ephesians. 1.
16.
himself as a pattern of his own precept, spent much of his time in other
exercizes, as preaching, conferring, doing miracles, and such like: But that
we always be ready, and have a disposition to prayer at all times; that we
think no time exempted, when any fit and good occasion is offered, whether it
be night or day, or any part of either of them, nor any place excluded, if
there be cause and opportunity: for we must pray every where, lifting up holy
hands 1. Tim. 2. 8.
without wrath or doubting, at home and abroad, in our businesses and vacancie
from labor. And thus he expounds himself, interpreting these words,
without ceasing and always, of every opportunity and Ephesians. 6. 18.
seasonable time, when God either ordinarily or extraordinarily gives unto us
any fit occasion.

. Sect. 2 Of ordinary prayers at set times, and how often to be performed.
Concerning our ordinary prayers, they are for the most part limited to set and
ordinary times, although we are not to be so strictly tied to our hours, but
that they may be changed from one to another upon necessary occasions. And they
ought to be performed in a solemn manner, with due preparation, conioyning
together the parts of prayer, confession, petition and thanksgiving, with due
respect both of place and time. Neither are these prayers to be continued
throughout the whole day, but in the several parts thereof, as shall best fit
with our occasions, and also with our zeal and devotion. Notwithstanding we
are to pray even after this manner, not once only, but often; according to the
examples of the Saints in former times. So David professes, that he prayed
unto God in Psalm. 55. 17. Dan. 6. 10.
the morning, at noone and in the evening; and Daniel so stinteth himself to
solemn prayer upon his knees three times a day, that he would not neglect it
upon any occasion. And howsoever no man can stint these set times of prayer
unto a certain number, but it must be left to be measured out according to
several occasions, leisure, opportunity and the proportion of every ones gift
of grace, faith, zeal and devotion which they have received; which being so
various, diverse and different, it is no more possible to appoint a certain
measure unto them, then a size of apparel to fit every ones body, or a
proportion of meat which should satisfy every ones appetite. Or if we should;
what were it, but (like the Tyrant, that would have one bed to serve for men of
all statures) to rack out and torture the ouer-short devotion of those that
are children in Christ; and to mayme and cut theirs shorter, who are men grown
and come to a perfect age? Yet seeing all Scriptures are written for our
learning, me thinks these examples should not be in vain, but well-befitting,
for the most of Gods children to follow and imitate, especially in this light
of the Gospel, and when the gifts of the Spirit do so abound. And therefore I
would persuade all good Christians, that besides their prayers and 1. Tim. 4.
4, 5.
thankesgiuings before and after meals, whereby Gods blessing is obtained, and
the creatures sanctified to their use; they would at least thrice a day make
their solemn and set prayers unto almighty God; that is, first, betimes in the
morning privately by themselves, before they go about their ordinary affairs
and works of their calling. And then in the family, some time in the
forenoone, when as the household may with most conueniency meet all together,
and either before or after Supper, when as we are to go unto our rest, or if
we be under government, and in such families wherein these duties are
neglected, then must we perform them privately by our selves, wherein we are
to pray in especial manner for all those who dwell with us, and principally
for our governors; among other blessings, craving this above others, that God
will be pleased to give them hearts to erect the exercises of Religion in their
families, to the advancement of his own glory, and the salvation of
themselves, and those who are committed to their charge. But yet let neither
governors nor inferiors content themselves with these family duties, which
they perform with others; but set some time and place apart for their private
devotions, that they may have secret conference with God, confessing and
bewayling their particular sins and corruptions, which being known only to
him and their own consciences, they would not have men to take notice of them
by any open acknowledgments; laying open their special wants, and desiring
earnestly a supply of those gifts and graces wherein they find themselves most
defective; and rendering thanks unto God for those peculiar benefits and
blessings, which in a special manner he has conferred upon them.

. Sect. 3 Of the extraordinary prayers upon every good occasion.
But it is not enough that we use daily these set, solemn, and ordinary
prayers, but we must, as our Savior inioyneth us, Pray always, and as the
Luke 18. 1. 1. These. 5. 17. Verse. 18.
Apostle speaks, continually, and without ceasing. That is, we must be ready
to pray, so often as God shall give us any occasion, or as the Apostle
speaks, in every thing; that is, craving Gods blessing when we undertake any
business, and praising his name for his gracious assistance, whereby we have
been enabled to atchieue it; craving his protection at the approaching of any
danger, and his help and strength for the ouercomming of any difficulty which
affronteth us in our way. In a word, we must pray in season, that is, at our
ordinary times, and upon common occasions; and out of season, that is,
extraordinarily, when any special and new occasion offers it self unto us.
Unto which prayers, there is not required that we should use our voice, or
gestures of the body, which are used in set prayers; or that we should in any
continued or long speech of the soul unto God, express our selves in all the
parts of prayer: but only that we use sudden and short eiaculations, lifting
up our hearts unto God, and as it were darting unto the Throne of grace our
fervent desires, which we may do, without being discerned in the midst of a
crowd, and without any distraction from our ordinary affairs. And thus
Nehemiah prayed unto Nehem. 2. 4.
God in the presence of an heathenish King, for good success in his suite.
Moses in the midst of the Army for help and deliverance, when Exodus 14. 15.
as they were pursued by the Egyptians: And our Savior Christ himself, at the
grave of Lazarus. And thus are we to pray continually and John 11. 38, 41.
without ceasing, either in our set and solemn prayers, or these short
expressions of our hearts desires in all companies, upon all occasions, and at
all times; not only in the day time, but even in the night also, either rising
with David to praise God, when our hearts are ravished with the joyful
apprehension of some extraordinary benefits; according to that, At Psalm. 119.
62.
midnight will I rise to give thanks unto thee, because of thy righteous
Judgments; or with the Church in the Lamentations, to crave help and
deliverance when we lie under the weight of some grievous afflictions. Arise
(says she) cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watches, power out
thine Lam. 2. 19.
heart, like water, before the face of the Lord, etc. And this if we do, our
prayer will be more fervent and effectual, our senses and souls being
sequestered from worldly affairs, and not encumbered and interrupted in these
holy exercises, with any earthly distractions. Or at ordinary times, and upon
usual occasions, lifting and raising up our hearts and minds unto God, when we
wake out of our sleep, praising him for all his mercies and goodness, and
namely, for the rest which he has given us, and desiring the continuance of
his love and favor, with all the signs and testimonies of it. But here our
chief care must be, that by this continual custom and daily practice, we
do not grow to a less esteem of this high and holy duty, that our hearts be
not negligent and careless in the performance of it, and so our prayers become
cold and formal, and performed more for custom then for conscience, but that
we pray with our whole hearts, in zeal and feruency of Spirit, accounting it
the highest privilege in the world, that we have daily and continually such
sweet intercourse and communion with God, and such free access unto the
Throne of grace, at all times, and upon all occasions, to make our suites and
requests known unto our Sovereign King and gracious Father, with assurance to
have them heard and granted. The which must inflame our devotion and zeal, and
cause us to power forth our hearts unto God; without which, the prayer of the
lips, wanting the fire of zeal and devotion, will become (as the Wise man
speaks) the sacrifice of fools. And Eccl. 5. 1.
therefore we must with David, power out our souls unto God; and with the
Psalm. 42. 4.
afflicted Church, lift up our hearts with our hands unto the Lord of heaven;
or else we can have no assurance to be heard, seeing these only who thus do
Lam. 3. 41.
have the promise; according to that of the Psalmist; The Lord is nigh unto
Psalm. 145. 18. Esa. 29. 13.
all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. And if we
would have the sacrifice of our prayers accepted of God, we must not only offer
unto him our outward members and parts, but wash also our inwards, our Leuit.
1. 13.
hearts and affections, and so offer our selves as a whole burnt offering unto
God. And whilst we stretch out our hands, our hearts also must be enlarged
Psalm. 143. 6.
with thirsting desires, after the living waters and springs of Gods gifts and
graces, like unto the thirsty land.

. Sect. 4 Diverse motives unto the daily exercise of prayer.
Unto which daily and continual prayers, with this zeal and feruency of
Spirit, we may be moved; first, if we consider, that we stand in such Act. 17.
28.
need of Gods continual help and assistance, that we cannot subsist without
it the least minute, for in him we live, and move, and have our being.
Secondly, that we stand daily and continually in want of some gift and grace of
God, and of all of them in some measure and degree; and also of some one or
other of Gods temporal benefits, or at least, of the right and holy use of
them. And therefore seeing our wants are continual, and God has appointed
prayer as the hand of the soul, to be thrust into his rich Treasury of all
grace and goodness for a continual supply, without which we can have no
assurance, that we shall receive any thing at the hands of God; hereby it
manifestly appears that our prayers also ought to be daily and continual.
Thirdly, we are daily and continually subject to innumerable dangers, in
respect of the evils that may befall us in our souls, bodies, and estates, and
it is God only watching over us with his providence, that can both preserve us
from them, and deliver us out of them: the which, we cannot expect, unless we
serve his providence, by using this means of prayer, whereby only his
gracious help and assistance Mat. 7. 7.
is obtained; and therefore our continual dangers, needing continual
preservation from them, commends unto us the necessary use of our daily and
continual prayers. Finally, the many and mighty enemies of our salvation do
continually assault us with their tentations, that ouercomming, they may bring
us to destruction. And prayer is the chief means, both of buckling unto us
the whole Armor of God, whereby we are enabled to stand in the evil day; and
of obtaining the help and assistance of his holy Spirit, whereby alone we are
enabled to overcome. And therefore as we are continually tempted to one sin or
other, so must we continually pray for grace to withstand the tentation; and as
the Apostle speaks, Pray always, with all prayer and supplication in the
Spirit, Ephesians* 6. 18.
watching thereunto with all perseverance, etc.

CAP. XI.
Of the daily exercise of Thanksgiving; and how it ought to be performed.

. Sect. 1 What things are required in the duty of thanksgiving.
ANd as we are thus to pray daily and continually, by making our suites and
petitions unto God, so also by thanksgiving, returning thanks and praise for
all the benefits and blessings which we receive at his hands. Unto which duty,
diverse things are required; first, that it be done in the name of Christ,
according to that of the Apostle, By him therefore let us offer the Ephesians. 5.
20. Heb. 13. 15. To. 1. 8. and 7. 25.
sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving
thanks to his name. Secondly, that it be done in a right manner; unto which is
required, that it be done, first, not only in outward profession with the
lips, but also inwardly with the soul, with all the powers and faculties of
it, according to that of the Psalmist, Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all
that Psalm. 103. 1. and 104. 1.
is within me, bless his holy name. First, in our understanding we are to take
notice, and rightly to conceive of Gods benefits, not only in some generality,
but also of those particular blessings, which we daily and continually receive
from him; that we may not be ungrateful, through ignorance and heedlesnesse,
but have thankful minds, and so, as the Psalmist speaks, sing praises with
understanding. Neither must we only know Gods Psalm. 47. 7.
benefits and blessings, but also acknowledge them to be his free gifts, and
that he is the principal Author and fountain of all the good which we Jam.
1. 17. Habac. 1. 16.
either presently enjoy, or hope for in time to come; giving him the whole
glory of his gifts, and not attributing them to secondary causes and inferior
means; which are only his instruments by which he conserreth these gifts
upon us. In our judgments, we must rightly value, and highly esteem of Gods
benefits, as well when we enjoy them, as before we had them, or when they are
taken from us; not extenuating, but rather amplisying his gifts to the
advancing of his glory, and increasing of our thankfulness. Psalm. 16. 6.
In our memories we must thankefully retain the remembrance of Gods manifold
mercies and inestimable benefits, that we may continually Deuteronomy. 6. 11, 12. and
8. 14.
take occasion thereby to praise him for them; esteeming it one of the worst
kinds of ingratitude, to forget our benefactour, or the gifts and blessings
which we have received from him. And this God often imposes upon his people,
that they should not forget him nor his blessings; and Psalm. 103. 2.
David upon his own soul, Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his
Ps. 9. 1. and 138. 1. and 86. 12.
benefits. But above all, we must be thankful unto the Lord with all our
hearts; according to that of David; I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole
Psalm. 119. 7.
heart. Or if we fail herein of that perfection which the Law requires, yet
at least let us do it in uprightness and integrity, which will be accepted of
God in Jesus Christ. Unto which thankfulness of the heart is required, first,
that it be done in humility, giving God the whole praise of Psalm. 115. 1.
his own works, and acknowledging his glory and greatness, his goodness and
graciousnesse, who dayneth and vouchsafes of his free grace to respect us who
are dust and ashes, base and contemptible, sinful and miserable, Genesis 32. 10.
1. Chro. 17. 16.
and are so far off from deserving the least of his mercies and benefits,
that we have justly merited the greatest of his judgments and punishments.
Secondly, we must show our thankfulness, with all due reverence, in respect of
Gods glorious Majesty, acknowledging it to be a singular privilege, that so
mighty a King, and Sovereign Lord of heaven and earth will receive any thing
at our hands. Thirdly, we must perform it with all alacrity and
cheerfulness, rejoicing much, in that he gives us not only the occasions of
this duty, but hearts also to do it in some poor and weak measure.

. Sect. 2 That we must give thanks in all things.
And after this manner must we show our thankfulness unto God: The object of
our thanksgiving, or the cause and occasion of giving thanks, 1. These. 5. 18.
Ephesians. 5. 20.
is, all things, according to that of the Apostle, In every thing give thanks;
And again, giving thanks always, for all things, unto God the Father, in the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is, we must give thanks for all good
things, which are so in their own nature, or which through Gods wisdom,
power, and goodness are made so unto us; for positive good things, as all Gods
blessings and benefits, both temporal, spiritual, and eternal; or privative,
when God in his love and mercy freeth us from those evils of punishment which
our sins have deserved, or at least, does not inflict them in that measure
and degree which he might justly impose upon us: in which respect, the Church
in her greatest afflictions Iam. 3. 22.
took occasion of praising God, and acknowledging his mercies, in that they
were not utterly consumed: And does also turn these light and Romans 8. 28.
momentany afflictions to our good, as the mortification of our sins, the
enriching of us with spiritual graces, the furthering of our salvation, and
the increasing of our heavenly joy and happiness.

. Sect. 3 That we must give thanks at all times.
And this thankfulness in all things we must show at all times, that is,
daily and continually, privately and publicly, secretly in our hearts, and
outwardly in our words and works, so often as we have any occasion and
opportunity offered unto us, either ordinary or extraordinary: by
consideration, either of positive or privative benefits; both at set times of
prayer, and thorowout the whole day, by lifting up our hearts with thanksgiving
unto God, for the continual benefits, which in every part of the day he
conferreth upon us: As our deliverance from evils, with which we see others
overtaken, our preservation from many dangers, to which we are daily subject:
for the assistance of his grace and holy Spirit, against the tentations of our
spiritual enemies; for keeping our hearts in his fear, and from wandering with
the world, in the by-ways of sin and wickedness. For giving us hearts to
seek and serve him, and for accepting of us and our imperfect actions, in the
perfect obedience of Jesus Christ. For multiplying and continual renewing of
all his blessings and benefits upon us, and those that are near and dear unto
us, both in temporal and spiritual things, and for those assured hopes which
he has given us of heavenly and everlasting happiness in the world to come.
For those which he bestows publicly upon the Church and Common wealth, and
privately upon our families and our own persons. And this daily and continual
thankfulness and thanksgiving unto God, is required of us in the Scriptures.
The Apostle exhorts us, to speak to our selves in Ephesians. 5. 20.
Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual Songs, singing and making melody in our
hearts to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things, etc. And that we
should by Christ, offer the sacrifices of praise to God continually, that is,
the Heb. 13. 15.
fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name. And this was David's daily
practice, as he often professes; I will bless the Lord (says he) at all
times his praise shall continually be in my mouth. And again, Every day will I
bless Psalm 34 1.
thee, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. Which resolutions, because
Psalm. 145. 2.
he could not atchieue by his own abilities, he craves help and assistance
from God: Let my mouth be filled with thy praise, and with thine honor all
Psalm. 71. 8, 15.
the day; and then he promises to perform it; I will (says he) praise thee
more and more. My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
all the day, for I know not the numbers thereof.

. Sect. 4 Reasons which may move us unto daily thanksgiving.
Besides which testimonies and examples of holy Scriptures, there are many
reasons which may move us to the daily and continual practice of this holy
duty. As first the excellency of it, seeing it is the continual exercise of
the holy Angels and Saints in heaven, in which a great part of their happiness
consists, and we see in the Revelation, where great multitudes of the Saints
cry alowd, and say, Blessing, and glory, and Apoc. 5. 13. and 7. 12.
wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power and might, be unto our God
for ever and ever, Amen. And this exercize they continue day and Apoc. 4. 8.
night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty, which was, and is, and is
to come. Secondly, it is most comely and decent, in respect of God, who being
the chief goodness all glory and praise of due belongs to him, as being the
end of all things, and the Author and fountain of all our Psalm. 92. 2.
our good. And therefore David often repeateth it, and makes it the foot of
his song, that we must give thanks to the Lord and praise him, because he
Psalm. 1^6. 1. and 147. 1.
is good, and his mercy endures for ever. In respect of us also, who daily
receive benefits at his hands: for seeing he renews his mercies upon us every
Psalm. 33. 1. Lam. 3. 23.
morning, as the Church confesses, and follows us with his favors,
throughout the whole day, what better beseems us, then to be thankful to
such a gracious Benefactour, and to have our hearts filled with thankfulness,
and our mouths with his praises? Again, we are spiritual Priests unto God,
to offer unto him daily sacrifices: and what better beseems Apoc. 1. 5.
our office, then to offer unto him praises and thanksgiving, which Psalm. 50.
14.
are the sacrifices wherein his soul does chiefly delight? For it is a
principal part of his service, which most redoundeth to his glory, according
to that of the Psalmist, Whosoever offers praise, glorifieth me; and is
daily Verse. 23
therefore to be performed by us, as our Savior teaches us in his perfect
form of prayer, the first petition whereof, is, that Gods name may be
hallowed and glorified; and the conclusion, an acknowledgement that the
Kingdom, power, and glory, do belong unto him alone. Thirdly, it is the main
end for which God bestows all his blessings upon us, that Deuteronomy. 8. 18.
we should yield unto him the praise and glory of his own gifts; The which we
will perform, if we be not too too ungrateful, seeing they are so inestimable
and manifold, and yet he in love of them all requires nothing of us, but that
we daily show our selves thankful debtors. Yea, in truth we have nothing else
to return unto him, seeing all we have is his already; as we see in the
example of David, who, though he were a King, Psalm. 16. 3.
yet confesses after long deliberation, his nullity and insufficiency in this
kind, and therefore concludes, that he would render unto him thanks Psalm.
116. 12.
and praise. Yea, it is the end why God has given us our tongues, that with
them we should glorify him; whereof it is, that the Psalmist calls his
tongue his glory, because it was the instrument of glorifying God; and
therefore they are utterly unworthy this excellent gift of speech, wherein
Psalm. 30. 12. and 57. 8.
we excel all the creatures, who do not in the use of it, aim chiefly at
this end for which it was given them.

. Sect. 5 Of the means whereby we may be stirred up to thankfulness.
Now the means of yielding unto God this daily and continual thankfulness,
is partly to remove the causes and occasions of ingratitude, 1. Chro. 17. 16.
and 29. 14, 15.
and partly to use all helps whereby we may be furthered in this duty.
Concerning the former, we must take heed of pride, and all opinion of our
own merits, which will make us to think that all which we receive, is less
then we deserve; and contrariwise embrace humility, and wholly deny our selves
with our own works and worthiness, and so we shall be thankful for the
least benefits, when we consider that they are more then we deserve. Secondly,
we must not attribute the good things which we Psalm. 127. 1. Deuteronomy. 8. 17.
receive, unto secondary causes and inferior means; as to our own wisdom,
power, and industry, but ascribe them wholly unto God, whose gifts they are,
for otherwise we shall not give God the praise, but sacrifice Hab. 1. 16. Isa.
10. 13.
to our own nets. Thirdly, we must not think how much we want, but what we
have; not how many are preferred before us, but how many better then we come
behind us, and want the good things which we enjoy. The helps whereby we may
be furthered in this duty of thanksgiving, are first, to take notice of those
manifold blessings which the Lord heapeth upon us, and even of his particular
gifts, at the very time they are received; for whilst they are new, they more
affect us, and stir us up to greater thankfulness. Secondly, we must highly
value them in our judgments, if not in their own worth, yet as they are
loue-tokens sent from God, pledges and pawnes of his favor, and
earnest-pennies of everlasting life and happiness; for the better we conceive
of Gods benefits, the more thankful will we be unto him for them. Thirdly, we
must keep blessings received in former times, in faithful memories, that we
may often recount them, and adding them to the new, we may become more fervent
and cheerful in performing of this duty; especially those main benefits of
Gods love, our election, creation, redemption, vocation, justification,
sanctification, continual preservation, and assured hope of our glorification.
The which we shall the more readily do, if we consider, that it is an
especial means to move the Lord to confer upon us new benefits, when as we
are truly thankful unto him for the old, which is the main end for which he
gave them, and to cast upon us the seeds of his blessings with a liberal hand,
when as we are not barren grounds, but yield unto him the fruits of
thanksgiving.

CAP. XII.
Of the duties of the daily exercise, in every several part of the day. And
first of waking with God, by Prayer and Meditation.

. Sect. 1 Of lifting up our hearts unto God, as soon as we awake, that we may
offer unto him our first service.
Having spoken of those Christian duties which are necessarily to be performed
thorowout the whole day; we are now come to show how the day is to be spent in
the particular parts of it, and what special duties are to be performed in
them severally, as God shall give us conueniency and opportunity. The which we
will divide, as the natural day consisting of four and twenty hours is
divided, into such duties as respect either the day or night. The duties of the
day, are either those which ordinarily and constantly are to be done in
certain parts of the day, without omission or alteration, unless upon some
urgent cause; or those which respect circumstances, persons, states,
occurrents, not limited unto any certain time of the day, but waiting upon the
most opportune and fit occasions. Of the former sort are duties merely
religious, and belonging to all Christians generally and indifferently; or
civil duties, which notwithstanding ought to be performed of all the
faithful, after an holy and religious manner. The first religious duty
wherewith we are to begin the day, is, that as soon as we awake out of our
sleep, we offer unto God a morning sacrifice, and (as it were) the first
fruits of all our thoughts, affections, and endeavors, sequestring them from
the world and earthly vanities, that they may be fixed upon God, and things
heavenly and spiritual. And even whilst our bodies lie still on our beds, and
before we have vnbarred the door of our lips, to give passage unto our words,
in this still silence, we must lift up our hearts unto God to commune with him,
and (as it were) to salute him, by consecrating unto him their first and best
service. Of which duty we have David an example for our imitation, who no
sooner awaked, but he was presently with God, as he professes, and sought him
Psalm. 139. 18. Psalm. 63. 1.
early, thirsting in his soul after him, like a dry and thirsty land. Yea, so
diligent and fervent was he in doing this duty, that he prevented the dawning
Psalm. 119. 147.
of the morning; and before he was thoroughly awakened, and had all his senses
set fully at liberty from the bands of sleep, his heart is rowzed up, and
fixed upon God to give him praise; and then that being awaked, Psalm. 57. 7, 8.
does also awaken his tongue, and instruments of music, and his whole man to
join together in glorifying God. So the Church in Esayas song says, that she
longed after God in the night, and resolves, that with her Spirit Esa. 26. 9.
within her, she would seek him early. Which that we may likewise practice,
let us consider that the Lord our God is our chief treasure, and our souls
sole delight, and therefore let our hearts be first there where our treasure
is, and seeing he is the only true cause of all comfort and rejoicing; let us
solace our selves in our fruition of him by this sweet communion. For if
worldly men who have fixed their hearts on earthly vanities, do meditate on
them in the night without weariness, and no sooner awake in the morning, but
presently they consecrate unto them their first thoughts and desires, as the
covetous man, to his riches; the ambitious man, his honors; the voluptuous
man, his pleasures; let us be ashamed if we cannot be as fervent and diligent
in dedicating unto God the first service of our hearts, who is infinitely more
worthy of our love. Again, there is no business in the world of like weight
and worth unto this, as bringing singular comfort to our hearts, and salvation
to our souls, and therefore let us give it the priority, and precedencie, and
not suffer every pedling and pelting trifle take up our hearts first, and make
it to watch at the doors, and sometimes to depart away for want of admittance.
And seeing God is the most worthy person, and offers to confer with us
about the waightiest occasions, let us not after an unmannerly and foolish
fashion, suffer him to attend our leisure, till we have done conferring with
the contemptible and worthless world, about earthly occasions, which are
slight and of no value. Finally, the morning is the best and fittest time for
the undertaking and atchieuing of any employment, because of the freeness of
our minds from all encumbrances, the viuacity and cheerfulness of the
spirits, and the vigor and abilities of all our parts, by reason of our late
rest, and therefore let us consecrate the very prime of it unto our gracious
God, who best deserves our best service.

. Sect. 2 Of lifting up our hearts by some short prayer.
Now this first service which we are to offer unto God, consists in prayer
and meditation, which are the two wings of our souls, whereby they soar aloft
into heaven, and there enjoy the presence of God. The first duty is prayer,
whereby lifting up our hearts unto God with more feruency then prolixity, we
do in some short manner, render unto God praise and thanksgiving for our quiet
rest, whereby our bodies are refreshed; for preserving us from all dangers of
the night, both in our souls and bodies, especially from sinful dreams, and
the tentations and assaults of Satan, who would easily have overcome and
utterly destroyed us, had not God watched over and defended us by his power and
providence. For letting us again enjoy the light, and granting us another day
wherein we may do him further service, and so make our own calling and
election sure. Unto which, with like breuity we are to adioyne the confession
of our sins, especially of that night, if any such come to our knowledge and
remembrance, and by reason of them, our great unworthiness of these favors
and testimonies of Gods love, desiring the pardon of them, and the
sanctification of the Spirit, whereby we may be more and more freed from them.
And finally, we are to cast our selves into the arms of his providence,
commending our souls and bodies unto his protection and direction, and
desiring to be so assisted with his grace and holy Spirit, that all the
thoughts of our hearts, and words of our mouths, and the works of our hands,
may the day following, and for ever be acceptable in his sight. And especially
that he will so illighten, rule, and assist us in our following meditations,
that they may tend to his glory, and to our own comfort and salvation.

. Sect. 2 Of the subject matter of our Morning meditations.
And so we must from prayer proceed to meditation, the which may be longer or
shorter, according to our opportunity, occasions, and leisure; and the measure
and feruency of our zeal and devotion. In which, our maine scope must be to
glorify God, to increase our communion with him, by these familiar conferences
of our souls; to strengthen our faith, enlarge our hearts with love and
thankfulness, and to replenish them with joy and comfort in the sweet fruition
of God, and tokens of his love. To which purpose we must fit the subject matter
of our meditations; and because present occasions are ready at hand, and not
only more familiar and easy to be remembered, but fit to affect our hearts,
which are more apprehensiue of present then past benefits, we are to make use
of such by meditating on them. But yet principally we must begin with the
fountain, and raise our thoughts from the ground and foundation of all
blessings, which is Gods infinite love, testified chiefly, in giving unto us
that singular pledge thereof, his only Son to die for us, that we might be
freed from everlasting death, and attain unto eternal life and happiness.
For whose sake he has freely forgiven us all our sins, and bestowed upon
us, together with him, all things needful for our souls and bodies, and
whatsoever is necessary to life and godliness. From which, we may descend to
the particular testimonies of Gods love lately received, as that he has by
his power and providence watching over us the night past, preserved us from all
dangers, and out of the hands of our spiritual enemies, who otherwise wanted
neither will nor power to have brought us to destruction. That he has kept us
from all terrors of the night, with which others have been affrighted, and
has graciously preserved our lives from sudden death, with which others lying
down in health and security, have been attached before the morning; adding
unto our days, and giving us still time of repentance, with ability to serve
him, and to be instruments of his glory. After which meditation on Gods
mercies, we may take such occasions as are presently offered, to furnish our
minds with holy thoughts, and to work in our hearts good affections and
desires. As our awakning out of sleep may put us in mind, of our awakening out
of the sleep, or rather Ephesians. 2. 1.
death, of sin, to the life of righteousness, by the quickening power of Gods
holy Spirit in our regeneration, and of the daily renewing of this our Ephesians. 5.
14.
quickening and awakning by continual sanctification. The light of the Sun may
put us in mind of the Sun of righteousness; who first in his Kingdom of
grace has shined unto us by the light of the Gospel, who before Luke 1. 79.
sat in darkness and the shadow of death, guiding our feet into the way of
peace. With which light we are to desire our minds may be more and more
enlightened, and freed powerfully and effectually from their natural
ignorance, without which spiritual illightning, the outward light of the Sun
and sight of our eyes will bring unto our hearts no sound comfort. Secondly, of
the light of glory, which shall infinitely exceed the light of the Sun, and
much more then it exceeds a Gloworme or the smallest spark of fire. For if
every one of the innumerable numbers of the glorified Saints, shall be more
glorious then the Sun in his chiefest brightness, then how infinite is the
glory of the (now) inaccessable light, which we shall then see face to face, who
gives both unto the Sun and them their beauty and brightness? our rising out
of our beds may put us in mind of the rising of our bodies out of our graves,
when as at the last day, by the sound of the Trumpet we shall be summoned before
Gods Tribunal seat, to give an account of all that we have done in the flesh;
the which should make us to resolve of preparing our selves daily to meet our
Judge, because the time is uncertain when he will call us to Judgment. When
we see our nakedness, let it put us in mind of our sin, which caused us first to
see and be ashamed of it, whereas when we were covered with innocence, and had
the Image of God shining in us, we no more needed garments to cover us, then
the Sun a cloud. And let this make us to long after the garment of Christ's
righteousness, with which, when we are perfectly clothed, we shall be without
sin or shame, and appear glorious in the sight of God; yea, let us earnestly
desire to put on Christ, not Romans 13. 14.
only for justification, but also for sanctification, whereby that clothing of
innocence before the fall, will be presently in part renewed and repaired, till
at last it come to more perfection then it had in our first creation. When we
put on our apparel, let us remember that they were first given us to cover our
shame, not as ornaments to be proud of, but as couerings to hide our
nakedness, and to preserve us from the injuries of the weather. And as we are
careful, not only to provide fit clothes for those ends, but also to put them
on, and apply them to our use, so let us be no less careful to provide fit
clothing for our souls, whereby their spiritual deformities may be covered,
and they beautified in the eyes of God with his Saints and Angels, as the
perfect garment of Christ's righteousness, already thoroughly finished by his
death and resurrection, and those rich ornaments of his spiritual graces,
which are now inchoate and begun, and shall be perfected in the life to come;
and not stay here, but also as carefully apply and put them on by the hand of
faith, as we do our apparel with the hands of our bodies, which otherwise
will do us no more good, then the best garments lying in our Phil. 3. 9. Romans
13. 14. Ephesians. 4. 23, 24.
chests, and never applied to the use of our bodies. And finally, seeing we
content not our selves to clothe some parts of our bodies that need clothing,
and leave others naked, but to have them all covered with fit ornaments for
every several part; so let us not rest contented to have our souls in part
clothed, and in part left naked, in their natural deformities; but to have all
ornaments of sanctifying and saving graces put on, taking daily most care to
supply that, wherein we find our selves most defective.

. Sect. 4 That in our first meditations, we must renew our faith and repentance.
Now as we are thus to take these, and all other such like good occasions of
holy and heavenly meditations; so our chief care must be, that we do daily
renew our repentance and faith in Christ, using to this purpose all those
helps and means which I have formerly prescribed. For the better performance
of which duty, we must set a sure watch before the doors of our hearts, to
keep out all wandering thoughts and earthly desires from entering into them,
which would distract us in this holy exercise; or if any through heedelesnesse
have crept in at unawares, our second care must be to strangle and choke them
as soon as they are entered, and to check our selves, in that we have been so
negligent in keeping our watch. But above all things we must take heed, that
we do not countenance and defend our infirmities and slips in this kind, by
obiecting against this exercise, that it will take up too much time, and our
leisure will not serve in respect of the works of our callings which we must
not neglect, and our many and weighty occasions and affairs, which are
sufficient to take up our whole time, and exercise all our thoughts for the
right ordering and managing of them. For there is no man so much employed in
worldly business, who does not waste more time idly, and upon unnecessary
things which bring no profit to his soul, body nor state, then is required for
these spiritual meditations, which being short in themselves, may yet be more
contracted into such a narrow room, that less then one quarter of an hour
may be sufficient for them. The which we may reasonably think will be no
hinderance to our profitable proceedings in our worldly affairs and duties of
our callings, seeing a good beginning is a great furtherance to a good ending,
and an ill conclusion in matters that concern our earthly estate, cannot arise
from such holy and heavenly premises. Yea rather we may with faith and a good
conscience assure our selves, that seeing the Lord only builds the house, and
without his blessing Psalm. 127. 1, 2.
all our labors and endeavors are spent in vain, he will so order all our
affairs with his providence, that the harvest which we are to reap of our
labors in the whole day following, will not be the worse, because we have
offered unto him the first fruits of the morning; nor that he will abate us of
our wages, because we have been careful to do him better service. Or though
hereby we should be somewhat scanted in earthly things, yet is there no reason
why we should be discouraged from performing these religious duties, seeing
they are as much more excellent, weighty, and necessary, then all earthly
affairs, and the profits and pleasures that do accompany the^, as the soul
excels the body; spiritual graces, worldly trifles; and heavenly happiness
the momentany and mutable vanities of the earth.

. Sect. 5 The manifold benefits which will arise from these religious morning
exercises.
Neither can our time be more profitably employed then in these holy exercises,
as will appear, if we consider the manifold fruits and benefits which we shall
reap by them. For we shall hereby preserve and increase the sincerity and
uprightness of our hearts, and strengthen our resolutions in going on
cheerfully and faithfully in the duties of Gods service the day following, with
greater care and vigilance then we did the day before; we shall keep our
hearts well seasoned with the love and fear of God throughout the whole day
when as we fill them with this precious liquor betimes in the morning, before
they be taken up and tainted with carnal lusts and worldly vanities. We shall
move the Lord to sow in our hearts the seeds of his graces, when as like good
grounds they are thus well prepared to receive them; and when they spring up in
us, they will grow the better and faster, being well watered in the morning,
and endure without withering when the sun of persecution arises, and even
scorcheth with the heat of afflictions. We shall preserve our souls from the
poisonous contagion of the sinful times, when as before we go abroad into the
infectious air, we have betimes in the morning taken our spiritual cordials
and antidotes. We shall keep the fort of our hearts from any danger of sacking
and surprising by Satan's tentations, when as betimes in the morning we have
strengthened all our fortifications, and stopped the chief passages which
lead unto them. Our lives will be the better ordered throughout the whole day,
when we have thus well begun to order them in the morning, and we shall
perform all duties of holiness and righteousness with much more ease and
facility, pleasure and delight, when as by these meditations we have
acquainted our hearts with them, and have made them familiar with us by this
sweet society. We shall not need to fear the encounters of our spiritual
enemies, when as we have betimes betaken us to our weapons, and put on our
Christian armor, before we have put on our clothes. Our hearts will be filled
with joy and comfort in God, when as we do thus often reassure our selves of
his love; and we shall be safe under his gracious protection, seeing if we thus
wake with God; and seek him Job 8. 5, 6.
betimes, he will awake for us, and make the habitation of our righteousness
prosperous, as Bildad speaks. Finally, if our hearts be thus timely taken up
with these holy meditations, they will keep the room for such as are of their
own nature and quality, not suffering those which are sinful, carnal, and
merely worldly to enter; and so shall we be fitted for the next following duty
of prayer, when our hearts are prepared, and lifted up from the earth in these
religious thoughts, and are not distracted with worldly encumbrances. Whereas
contrariwise, if in the morning we keep no watch over our selves, but suffer
our hearts to take their liberty, and to give entertainment unto wicked and
worldly thoughts, and the carnal and sensual lusts of our corrupt flesh; they
will so wholly seize upon them and hold their possession, that we shall hardly
admit, or at least retain any good meditations the whole day following; and if
we set our selves to prayer or other religious duties, we shall be so
distracted with worldly cogitations and fleshly lusts, that they will become
cold and formal, and quite without any vigor and efficacy.

CAP. XIII.
Of Prayer in the Morning, how profitable it is and necessary, and of our
preparation unto it.

. Sect. 1 Of the fruit and profit of prayer.
ANd so much concerning the duty of meditation, wherein we are to be exercised
every morning. The next religious duty which is in the morning to be performed
of us, is, that we power out our souls unto God by fervent and effectual
prayer, which is a duty above all others to be daily put in practice. For it
is a principal part of Gods service, whereby he will be honored of us,
whereof it is, that in the Scriptures it is put for the whole worship of God.
It is required of us by special Hos. 14. 2. Psalm. 50. 14, 15. Matthew. 7. 7. 1.
These. 5. 17.
commandment in many places; unto which God has encouraged us to yield
obedience by many sweet Ioh. 16. 23. Psalm. 145. 18. Esa 65. 24.
and gracious promises, whereby he has assured us, that he will hear us, and
grant our requests. It is the badge of true Religion, and the neglect thereof,
of an utter Atheist. And therefore the Psalmist describing such an one, sets
him forth by these two properties, that he Psalm. 14. 1, 4. and 53. 4. Psalm. 50.
23.
has said in his heart, There is no God; and he has not called upon the
Lord. It is a duty most excellent, seeing thereby we glorify God, and he
also glorifieth us, vouchsafing unto us, who are but dust and ashes, yea
wretched sinners, this high and honorable privilege to have free access unto
him, and to have the ear of our great King and Sovereign, that we may make
all our suites known unto him, with undoubted hope to have them heard and
granted. It is most profitable also unto us, as being the chief means whereby
we attain at the hands of God, all the good things which we need, and are
freed from all the evils which we fear; and the key whereby we open the
treasury of all Gods graces and rich gifts, and 1. Job. 5. 14.
out of it furnish our selves with all blessings which are needful for us. It
is most effectual to prevail with God for the obtaining of all the good Jam.
5. 16, 17, 18. Exodus 32. 10. Josh. 10. 15.
things which we desire, as we see in innumerable places and examples of holy
Scriptures. It is a notable means for the strengthening of our faith and
affiance in God, when as we have experience that he hears us, and grants
our requests; and for the inflaming of our hearts with most fervent love, when
we taste of his bounty and goodness, in giving unto us the good things which
we desire. It increases our communion and fellowship with God, and brings
us into familiar acquaintance with him. It makes our minds to soar aloft in
heavenly meditations; and being on earth, it causes us to have our
conversation in heaven. It assures us that we are the children of God, and
heirs of the heavenly inheritance, seeing the same Spirit, which is the spirit
of supplication, seals also unto Rom 8. 15, 26.
us our Adoption. Finally, let us consider that it is a duty most necessary,
Ier. 10. 25. Genesis 32. 25, 26. Hos. 12. 4.
if either we will avoid Gods curse, or will, with Jacob, so wrestle with him,
as we mean to prevail and obtain the blessing; that if we neglect it, it is
a strong evidence unto us, that we have cast off all fear of God, as Eliphaz
reasons against Job; and that we are utterly destitute of all saving grace,
Zach. 12. 10.
seeing the same Spirit is the spirit of grace and supplication.

. Sect. 2 Their objection answered, who pretend want of leisure to pray.
Neither let any man pretend his small leisure, by reason of his weighty
business and manifold employments, as an excuse to warrant him for the neglect
of a duty so high and holy, so excellent, profitable and necessary: unless he
will say, that he has no leisure to be saved, to glorify God, or enrich
himself with his graces and blessings, or to get the evidences of everlasting
glory and happiness into his own keeping: and that he is so taken up with
worldly employments, that he has no leisure to seek any acquaintance with
God, to avoid his curse, or obtain his blessing; to go to heaven, or escape
hell. For shame therefore let us cast away these no less profane then
frivolous excuses: and to this end further consider, that the greater and more
important our business is, the more need we have to implore by hearty prayer,
the blessing of God upon our labors and endeavors, before we undertake them,
without which, all our policy, labor and endeavor, will be spent in vain,
either because we shall not atchieue the thing which we attempt; or if we do,
yet in Gods just judgment it shall become unto us a curse, rather then a
blessing. Consider further, how much time thou daily spendest in doing nothing,
or that which is ill, and worse then nothing: How much time in needless
curiosity about thy body, in dressing and feeding it, and in vain discourses
about things that profit not, yea corrupt rather then edify thee: How much in
unlawful or superfluous sports and recreations: in carding, dicing, masking,
reuelling, hunting, hawking, beholding vain sights and wanton enterludes: and
blush for shame, that thou can find time enough, in thy greatest employments,
for the satisfying of thy fleshly lusts, and only want leisure to serve thy
God, and save thine own soul. Finally, let us consider the unwearied
watchfulness of all the Saints of God in all ages, in attending upon this
duty, that they might frequently and fervently perform it day and night; and
set before us the example of our Savior Christ himself, who spent mornings
and euenings, yea whole nights in praying for us. Which if we neglect to do
for our selves, what do we but disclaim that holy communion, and show
plainly that we are not in that number? what do we else but debar our
selves of the benefit of his intercession, when as we take no care by our
prayers to have it applied unto us? Neither let any say that his purpose is not
to neglect this duty altogether, but though he has no leisure to pray every
day, yet he will find some time for it, though not every morning, yet in the
evening before he go to bed. For though this something be better then nothing,
yet consider that the morning sacrifice was no less required of God then the
evening; that the servants of God have risen betimes to call upon him; that we
cannot look to prosper in any of our labors, if we have not first craved Gods
blessing upon them; that we are daily subject to many dangers, to fall into
many snares of the devil, to be overcome of his tentations, to be attached
with Gods Judgments, and to be plunged into many perils which are daily
incident unto the life of man: yea, that before night we may be stricken with
sudden death, as many others have been whom we have known and heard of, and so
be arrested and called to the bar of Gods Judgment, to plead guilty or not
guilty, before we have presented our selves at the Throne of grace, to sue
forth our pardon: and then how fearful is our condition, if we are thus taken
away in our sins? From all which dangers we shall be secured, if we
conscionably perform this daily duty of morning prayer, and never go about
our worldly business, till we have gotten our pardon to carry with us.

. Sect. 3 That before we pray, we must use preparation, and what is required
unto it.
Now being by these reasons persuaded to the daily practice of this duty; let
us in the next place consider how we may so perform it, as that Psalm. 108. 1.
it may be acceptable unto God, and profitable for our own salvation. And unto
this many things are required, before, in, and after our prayers. Before, is
required preparation: for as David speaks of praising God, so may we of
prayer in all kinds, our hearts must be prepared, and so must our tongues,
before we can pray. And as they that mean to make any good music, do first
set their instruments in tune; so must we, before we can make any sweet melody
in Gods hearing, tune our hearts, that they may be fit for this action. And if
we will not speak unto our Prince rashly and unadvisedly, but prepare our
selves by due meditation, both in respect of the matter, and manner of our
speech; how much more should Eccles. 5. 1, 2.
we avoid rashness of mouth, and hastiness of speech, when as we speak to
the sovereign King of heaven and earth? Now in this preparation we must
examine our sins, that we may afterward humbly confess them and crave
pardon; especially we are to search out those, whereby we have most displeased
God, and wounded our own consciences, and whereunto our corrupt nature is most
inclined; and also labor to find out our special wants, and those gifts and
graces in which we are most defective, or of which, in respect of our present
occasion, we most stand in need; that accordingly we may frame out suits, and
press them unto God with more efficacy and feruency of desire. Secondly, we
must look to our feet, that is, to our affections, as the Wiseman exhorts,
and examine Eccles. 5. 1.
with what disposition we come unto prayer, whether as earnest suitors that
will have no denial, or after a cold, careless, and formal manner, for
custom, rather then conscience sake: especially we must be careful to
banish out of our minds and hearts, all worldly and wandering 1. Tim. 2. 8.
thoughts, carnal lusts, wrath, doubting, maliciousness, etc: and that we be
heauenly-minded, and have our hearts fraughted with holy desires, hungring and
thirsting after the gifts and graces which we intend to beg at Gods hands.
Finally, we must take heed, that we do not present our selves before God in
our impenitency; but if we be guilty of any sin, Prou. 28. 9. Psalm 66. 18.
Esa. 59. 1, 2.
we must bewail it, and promise amendment. For our sins unrepented of, stand
as a wall of separation between God and us, hindering his blessings from
descending, and our prayers from ascending; especially we must bewail our
want of charity, and purposes of revenge: for as we forgive Math. 5. 23. and
6. 14.
men their trespasses, so will God forgive us. And because we are so dull and
auerse to this holy duty, that by all our meditations we cannot, as we ought,
prepare our selves unto it: therefore let us entreat the Lord, before we make
any other suit unto him, that he will prepare our minds and hearts aright,
and so assist us with his grace and holy Spirit, that we may perform this
high and holy duty, in some such manner as may be acceptable in his sight. In
our prayers diverse things are required: As first, in respect of the object,
that we pray only to God our Father in heaven, as our Savior has taught us.
Secondly, in the alone mediation of Jesus Christ: For as there is but one God,
so there is but one Mediator between God and 1. Tim. 2. 5.
man, the man Christ Jesus. Thirdly, seeing through our ignorance and
corruption we cannot pray as we ought; therefore we must crave the assistance
of God the holy Ghost, which helps our infirmities, and makes intercession
for us, with sighs and groans which cannot be expressed. In respect of Romans 8.
26, 27. Zach. 12. 10.
the subject or party that prays, diverse things are required, first, in
respect of his person: secondly, in respect of his action. In respect of his
person, 1. that he be a faithful and righteous man. For they that draw near
unto God, must be holy, as he is holy; not in the perfect holiness and
righteousness Leuit. 19. 2. and 10. 2, 3.
which the Law, but which the Gospel requires: that is, in respect of
sincerity and integrity, desire, resolution and endeavor. For the prayer of the
righteous man only is effectual; and the Lord satisfies their desires alone
that fear him. Neither can our suites be acceptable unto God, Iam. 5. 16.
Psalm. 145. 19. Prou. 15. 9, 29.
before our persons are accepted: according to that of Solomon, The sacrifice
of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of the righteous is
acceptable unto him. And so David says, that the eyes of the Lord are upon Ps.
34. 15, 16, 17
the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry: But the face of the Lord
is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the
earth. And therefore our care must be, if we would pray with hope to be heard,
to lift up pure hearts and hands unto God, not in their own natural purity,
but as they are washed with the blood of Christ. Besides which washing of
Justification, we must labor after the spiritual washing of Regeneration,
that we may be cleansed by the water of the Spirit, applying unto us the virtue
of Christ's death and Resurrection, and the washing of repentance, bathing our
selves in the tears of hearty sorrow and contrition, because by our sins we
have displeased our gracious God. And if we prepare our hearts, and stretch
out our hands toward him; If iniquity be in our Job 11. 13, 14.
hand, we must put it away, and not let wickedness dwell in our tabernacles.
For if we do not wash and make us clean, and put away the evil of our
doings, but come before him defiled in our sins; then though we spread forth
our hands, Esa. 1. 15, 16.
God will hide his eyes from us, and when we make many prayers, he will not
hear.

CAP. XIIII.
Of such things as are required as essential unto prayer.

. Sect. 1 That we must pray in truth, with attention, and not with wandering
thoughts.
IN respect of the action, many things are required, both in regard of the
substance, and circumstances. Of the former 1. John 5. 14. Iam. 4. 3.
sort are the essentials of prayer: as 1. in general, that it be according to
Gods revealed will; for if we frame not our prayers according to this rule, we
shall go awry, and asking amiss, obtain nothing. More especially, there is
required, that we worship God internally with our hearts, as well as
externally with our bodies, and that we power forth our souls unto him in our
prayers as Hannah 1. Sam. 1. 15. Psalm. 25. 1. Lam. 3. 41.
did, so as we may say with David, Unto thee, (O Lord) I lift up my soul; and
with the afflicted Church, Let us lift up our heart, with our hands unto God in
the heavens. For God is a Spirit, and will be worshipped in spirit and truth;
Ioh. 4. 24. Prou. 23. 26. Ier. 29. 13.
and above all other service, he requires the service of the heart; seeing all
other without it, is but mere hypocrisy. Neither can we hope to obtain any
thing at Gods hands, unless our prayers proceed from sincere and upright
hearts, seeing he has limited his promise of hearing only to such, according
to that of the Psalmist; The Lord is near unto all that call upon Psalm. 145.
18.
him, to all that call upon him in truth. Let us therefore take heed, when we
call upon God, that our prayer be in truth, and not only the words of the
mouth, but the prayer of the soul. And to this end, that we do with like care
avoid praying with a lying tongue, and deceitful lips, when as we Psalm. 17.
1. and 119. 7.
ask those things with our mouths, which we desire not in our hearts; like
those hypocritical Israelites of whom the Lord complains, that they had
spoken lies against him, not crying unto him with their heart, when Hos. 7. 13,
14.
they howled upon their beds. Secondly, praying with wandering thoughts, having,
when we direct our speech in prayer unto God, our minds and hearts rouing
about worldly vanities, and our earthly affairs, without either respect to
Gods presence, or the suits that we have in hand. For this is a gross abuse of
Gods Majesty, which we are ashamed to offer to our superiors, yea even to our
equals, speaking unto them, and yet not minding what we say. It discovers
great irreuerence and neglect of Gods glorious presence, who beholding the
secrets of our hearts, sees how far they and our tongues are one from another.
It argues great security and hardness of heart, when as we thus approach into
his presence, and offer unto him such heartlesse sacrifices, not fearing that
dreadful speech, sealed and confirmed by such a terrible example, that the
Lord will be sanctified and glorified in them that come nigh him, either in his
mercies, or in his Leuit. 10. 2, 3.
judgments. It makes prayer to be no prayer, but lip-labor, and the wind of
words, which is, not the language of the mouth, but the speech of the heart. It
causes us to spend our labor in vain, when as we mind not what we say. For
how shall God vouchsafe to understand our suits, when as we our selves will
take no notice of them? Or how shall he give us his rich graces of greatest
value, when as we so meanly esteem them, that we can coldly and carelessly
ask them at his hands, and not think them worthy the minding and affecting in
our souls and hearts?

. Sect. 2 That we must with all diligence banish out of our minds all wandering
thoghts, and the means hereof.
And yet seeing through the malice of the devil and our own corruption we
are, even at our best, apt to fall into this foul infirmity, let us with Jer.
^2. 40. Psalm. 86. 11.
all care and diligence look to our hearts when we perform this duty, and
earnestly desire the Lord to tie them fast unto himself in the bonds of his
fear, that they may not, in this holy exercise, slip aside and depart from
him. And if we find our sinful flesh so sluggish and secure, so worldly and
earthly-minded, that it dulleth our devotion, and steals and carries, every
hand while, our hearts away after things impertinent, if not worldly and
carnal: I think it a good course, in our private prayer, to repeat that
again in which we were distracted, laboring in our repetition to call our
hearts back to join with our voice; seeing hereof comes a double benefit:
first, that we shall have our suites more powerfully offered unto God, when as
they are propounded in this hearty manner. And secondly, hereby we shall tame
the flesh, and make it not so eager to interrupt us in these holy duties, when
as the spiritual part imposes upon it this punishment by way of revenge, for
its sloth and worldliness, to make it to continue so much the longer at this
exercise, unto which naturally it is so backward and auerse; and not to feed it
self upon any worldly thoughts, wherein it wholly delights, till it have
first waited on the Spirit, and suffered it, without interruption, to refresh
it self with this heavenly breakfast. Let us meditate also on that glorious
presence before whom we stand, who looks not so much to the phrase of our
words, and the well-running style of our speech, as to the discourse of our
souls and hearts; which being so full of distractions and senseless rauings
and rouings from the matter; one while speaking to God, and (as it were) with
the same breath, and in the midst of a sentence breaking off, and speaking to
the world; iumbling, and confusedly mingling things spiritual and carnal,
heavenly and earthly, holy and profane; how can it be but ugly and misshapen
in his sight? being like Anticke-worke, consisting of monstrous compositions,
wherein the body of a bird, and the tail of a serpent; the face and forepart
of a man, and the hind-part and legs of a beast, or the tail of a fish are
joined together? Let us think upon the excellency, profit, and necessity of
those gifts and graces, which in our prayers we desire of God, and how
infinitely they excel those worldly vanities, which Satan and our own flesh
do cast into our minds to distract us in our suites. Unto whose suggestions
it is no less folly to listen, then for a malefactor who is suing unto his
Prince for a pardon that concerns his life, to turn from him in the midst
of his speech, and to hearken unto the motions of his lewd companions,
soliciting him to return to his former courses; or for a child, who being
suing unto his father for his inheritance, and by him employed about writing
and sealing his Evidences; does leave all this weighty business, and runs
away with his play-fellowes, to hunt after Butterflies. Finally, let us
meditate on that grief and coffeehouse which follows those prayers which
are made with these distractions, and how with sorrow and late repentance we
vvish, that what we have done, had been done otherwise; and contrariwise,
of the joy and comfort which accompanies and vvaiteth upon the
vvell-performance of these holy duties, out of the assurance that they give us
of Gods love, of the dwelling of his Spirit in our hearts, which has thus
helped our infirmities, and that our prayers being acceptable unto God, are
surely granted; and then think with our selves, that it will not stand with
our wisdom to gain all this grief, and lose all this comfort and joy,
because we would not repel these vvorldly thoughts and distractions; nor so
much as force them to a short absence, when as within less then the lesser
part of an hour, our hearts and they might lavvfully meet together.

. Sect. 3 That we must pray with our understandings.
And these are the things generally required, that our prayers unto God may be
the speech of the soul; now we are to speak more specially of 1. Cor. 14.
15. 1. Chro. 28. 29.
those things which are required hereunto, both in our minds and hearts. In our
minds it is required, that we pray with understanding: unto which, knowledge is
necessary, both of the true God, unto whom we pray; and of his will revealed in
his Word, according unto which we are to frame our prayers. We must know God
in his own nature and persons, and in his Son, Jesus Christ, in whom only
we can know him aright. John. 17. 3. and 1. 18. Matthew. 11. 27. Esa. 65. 24.
Dan. 9. 23. Psalm. 65. 2.
We must know him in himself, and in his saving attributes toward us, as
that he is a God all-sufficient, most merciful, bountiful, and gracious, and
our most loving Father in Jesus Christ, who listeneth unto our suites before
we make them; a God that hears prayers, and is more ready to give, then we
to ask. Secondly, we must have knowledge of Gods revealed will, which ought
to be the rule of all our suites; from which if we swerue, we shall err in
our own inventions, and Romans 8. 26, 27.
ask we know not what. We shall not pray in the Spirit, which teaches us to
pray according to the will of God; and wanting this guide, and not knowing of
our selves how to pray as we ought, we shall ask things hurtful as well as
profitable, and such as tend rather to the satisfying our carnal lusts, then
the furthering of our eternal salvation. We shall ask Iam. 4. 2, 3.
amiss, and so obtain nothing at Gods hands, seeing though we like foolish
children ask things evil and hurtful, yet our heavenly Father, only Matthew.
7. 11.
wise, knows to give good things alone unto his children that ask him;
neither has he made any promise at large, that he will grant whatsoever we
ask (which, because through our ignorance, we are apt to ask that which is
evil as well as that which is good, would be in this case a threatening 1. Job.
5. 14.
rather then a promise) but that our suites shall be heard, if we pray
according to his will.

. Sect. 4 That we must pray in faith.
Secondly, it is required that we pray in faith; for we cannot come unto God,
before we believe that God is; and as the Apostle speaks, How shall Heb. 11.
6.
we call upon God, in whom we have not believed? seeing no man is willing to
pray, unless it be for form and fashion sake, but he who is persuaded that
God will be gracious unto him and give ear unto his requests. Secondly,
without faith our persons are not accepted of God, and they can no otherwise be
accepted but in Christ, nor we be in Christ but by faith: and consequently our
actions cannot please him, when our persons do not, yea being tainted with our
corruptions, they are turned into sin. Thirdly, Romans 14. 23.
we can have no access unto God, but through Christ our Mediator, being
naturally dead in sin, and the children of wrath as well as others; Ephesians. 2.
18.
neither have we any interest in Christ, till by a lively faith we be ingrafted
into him. Fourthly, without faith we have no hope to be heard, seeing the
prayer of the faithful man only avails with God, as the Apostle speaks,
and as we believe, so it shall be unto us. For we have no assurance but from
Jam. 5. 16.
Gods promises, which are always made upon the condition of faith, bringing
forth the fruits of unfeigned repentance. In all which respects, it is most
necessary that we join faith with our prayers, and first a justifying faith,
which applies unto us in general, the promises of the Gospel, Christ Jesus
and all his benefits, and assures us of the remission of our sins, of
reconciliation with God, and that both our prayers and persons are accepted of
him; whereby we are imboldened to approach unto the Throne of grace, that we
may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of Heb. 4. 16. and 10. 22.
need. And secondly, some more special acts and branches of this faith, which
persuade in particular, 1. That our prayers in their several parts are
agreeable unto Gods will and Word; that the things we pray for be good and
lawful, tending to the advancement of Gods glory and our own salvation, and
such as the Lord has promised to bestow upon us. Secondly, that thus praying
according to Gods will, he will hear us graciously, and grant unto us even
those particular blessings and benefits which we have Mat. 7. 7. Ioh. 16. 23.
craved, and God has promised to bestow upon us; namely, in that manner which
he has promised to give them: that is, when we beg spiritual graces and
heavenly glory, which God has absolutely promised without any condition, in
some degree, as in his wisdom he sees fitting for us, we must accordingly
absolutely believe that we shall receive them; but when we crave temporal
benefits which God has promised conditionally, so far forth, as they will
stand with his glory, and our spiritual good and everlasting salvation, we
must believe that we shall obtain them so far forth as they will stand
with these conditions. And thus in both kinds we must pray in faith, and as
much as in us lies, banish wavering and doubting; for he that wauereth, is
like a wave of the sea, 1. Tim. 2. 8. Iam. 1. 5, 6, 7. 1. Ioh. 5. 14, 15.
driven with the wind, and tossed to and fro: neither let that man think that
he shall receive any thing of the Lord. Now the best means to strengthen this
our faith, when we come to pray, is utterly to deny our selves and our own
righteousness, and casting away all opinion of our own works and
worthiness, to ground our faith wholly upon Gods power and all sufficiency,
his truth in his promises, his infinite mercies, love and goodness toward us,
and the perfect merits and mediation of Jesus Christ. Neither must we look to
the measure of our repentance, and other graces necessarily required in those
that pray with hope to be heard, but to their sincerity and truth, nor upon
faith it self, in respect of the excellency and degree of it, as thinking
thereby that we shall be accepted of God, but as it is the condition, upon
which all the promises are made, and the alone instrument whereby Christ and
all his benefits are applied unto us. But of the means of faith we have spoken
before, and therefore refer the Reader to that which has bin said.

. Sect. 5 That we must pray in humility, and with reverence and feruencie.
In respect of our hearts there are diverse things required. First, humility,
whereby we abase our selves in the sight and sense of our own vileness and
unworthiness, unfeignedly acknowledging, that we are not worthy to tread upon
the earth, or to look up unto heaven, much less to appear in Gods glorious
presence, or to make any suites and supplications unto him. And therefore
rejecting all Pharisaicall conceit of our own works and worthiness, we are
to confess with Abraham, that we are but dust and ashes; with Jacob, that we
are less then the least of Gods mercies, Genesis 18. 27. and 32 10. Psalm. 22 6.
Esa. 6. 22. Luk 15. 21. Luke 18. 13. 1. Tim. 1. 15.
with David, that we are worms, and no men; with Esaias, that we are men of
polluted lips; with the prodigal Son, that we are not worthy to be called
Gods children; with the Publican, that we are miserable sinners; yea with the
Apostle Paul, that of all sinners we are the chief. And this humility will be
a notable means to confirm our faith in this assurance, that we shall be
received into grace and favor with God, and that he will hear and grant all
our Petitions. For he will look unto him that is poor and of a contrite
spirit; Esa. 66. 2. Psalm. 34. 18. Esa. 57. 15. Psalm. 51. 17. Psalm. 9. 12. and
10. 17.
he is near unto him, and will dwell with him; with this sacrifice of a broken
and contrite heart, wherein he chiefly delights, he is made propitious, and
will be ready to hear his suites; for he forgets not the cry of the humble,
but he hears their prayer, and will prepare their heart, and will cause his
ear to hear, as the Psalmist speaks. The second thing required in our
hearts, is reverence, unto which David exhorts: Serve the Lord with
reverence, Psalm. 2. 11:
and rejoice with trembling; and performed in his own practice; In Psalm. 5 7.
thy fear (says he) will I worship toward thy holy Temple. The which
reverence may be wrought in us, by the consideration of Gods glorious presence
before whom we stand, who being present with us, sees all our actions, and how
we behave our selves in his service, and is infinite both in Justice and
power, to punish us, if we take his name in vain, and abuse his holy
Ordinances, in performing unto him a formal, cold, and careless service: and
also in mercy, goodness, and bounty, if we worship him aright. And secondly,
if we consider withal, our own baseness and vileness, unto whom
notwithstanding, God, of his infinite grace and mercy vouchsafes this high
honor and inestimable prerogative, to come into his glorious presence, and to
make our suites known unto him. The third thing required, is feruency of
affection, and zealous devotion, whereby we do with all earnestnes desire to
have all our sins pardoned, and our wants supplied, and with all hearty
cheerfulness, without dullness and drowsines, coldness and weariness,
continue in this exercise: Unto which we attain, by coming unto a true sight
and sense of our sins and wants, which infer an urgent necessity to have
them pardoned and these supplied, and by considering the excellency, necessity,
and profit of this action, and the fruits that come of it, which are far to
be preferred before all things in the world.

CAP. XV.
Of the circumstances of Prayer, and of their quantity and quality.

. Sect. 1 Of our gesture and voice in prayer.
ANd these are the essential duties belonging unto prayer, besides which,
there are others which are circumstantiall and 1. Cor. 14. 40.
accidental, of which, there cannot for the most part be given any general and
certain rules, but that they be done in order, after a decent and comely
manner, and so as shall be most fit and convenient for the stirring up of our
devotion, and the furthering of those internal duties before spoken of, which
are essential and always necessary. The first, is the gesture of the body,
which ought to be such as may further our inward humility, reverence, and
feruency of devotion; wherein we are to imitate the example of Gods Saints in
former times, and the custom of the Church and Country where we live, using
those gestures which are used in them, to express external worship, humility,
and reverence. As among us, standing, kneeling, uncovering of the head, lifting
up of the eyes and hands; and in extraordinary and greater humiliation,
prostrating our selves upon the ground, casting down our eyes, as being ashamed
to look toward heaven, and knocking of the breast, as bewayling the sinful
corruption therein contained. In all which, our chiefest endeavor must be, that
the inward affection and disposition of the heart, do answer unto the outward
gestures of the body, without which they are but hypocritical shows. The
second, is the voice which is to be used in prayer, so often as conveniently
Psalm. 51. 14, 15. and 71. 23, 24. and 119. 171. Hos. 14. 2.
we may, seeing it is one special end, for which God has given it unto us,
that we might by it glorify him, both in our prayers, and our praises and
thanksgiuings. Not that he himself needs it, for he searches the secrets of
the heart and reins, but for the example and edification of others, as in
public prayer, and for the intention of our own affections, the attention of
our minds, and stirring up of our devotions in our private prayers; which
notwithstanding must be done with this caution, that seeing private prayer must
be made in secret, we must not speak alowd in our Closet or Chamber, so as
others may hear and understand us, or at least, we must not Matthew. 6. 6.
do it to this end, seeing it is but gross hypocrisy, which we must not only
avoid, but even the very show and appearance of it, so far forth as it does
not cross Christian apology and profession, nor that rule of piety and
charity given by our Savior Christ; Let your light so shine before men, Romans
10. 10. Dan. 6. 10.
that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
heaven. For we may easily fall (as diverse do) into the contrary extreme, who
so shun the show of hypocrisy, that they avoid all profession of Religion, and
are as much ashamed to be taken in the exercise of prayer, or such like pious
duties, though it be at unawares, especially by those who are not as forward in
profession as themselves, as if they were doing something which is faulty and
unlawful. But this use of voice is necessary only in such private prayers as
are set and solemn, ordinary, and in a private place; for as for those short
prayers and eiaculations which are to be used upon all occasions, and in all
companies, it is sufficient that we lift up our hearts unto God, without using
the voice, especially in the presence of others, when the thing we pray for
concerns not them, but our selves; and least of all, when as 1. Sam. 1. 13.
Nehem. 2. 4.
they do not join with us in the sincere profession of the same truth, as
before we showed when we spoke of these short prayers and eiaculations.

Sect. 2 That we must not affect prolixity and superfluity of words in our
prayers.
And these are the things to be observed in prayer, in respect of our gesture
and voice. In respect of the speech it self, or words whereby our prayers are
expressed, diverse things are to be considered. First, in respect of the
quantity and continuance of them: we must avoid affectation of prolixity,
superfluity of words, vain babbling and idle repetitions, which proceed not
from any feruency of affection, and earnestness of desire to obtain the
things we pray for, arising from the sight and sense of our wants, (for in this
case it may be lawful and requisite to repeat often the same things, as
pressing our suits with such importunity as will admit of no denial: according
to the example of Daniel, O our God, hear the prayer Dan. 9. 17, 18, 19.
of thy servant; O my God, incline thine ear and hear, O Lord hear, O Lord
forgive, O Lord hearken and do, etc. And of our Savior Christ himself, Mark.
14. 39.
praying often in the same words, that if it were possible, the bitter cup of
his Passion might pass from him;) but out of an opinion that we shall be the
rather heard for the length of our prayers, or out of an ostentation of our
holiness and devotion, or our extraordinary gift above others, inabling us to
continue long in this exercise. For this our Savior straitely forbids: When
ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the Heathen do, for Mat. 6. 7, 8, 9.
they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking; prescribes the
contrary practice, in propounding that short and most pithy form for our
imitation: and condemns as hypocritical in the Pharisees, who under pretense
of long prayers, devoured widows houses. And Solomon likewise: Math. 23. 14.
Eccles. 5. 2.
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any
thing before God, for God is in heaven, and thou upon the earth, therefore let
thy words be few: Of which our Savior gives this reason; Because our Father
knows what things we have need of, before we ask him: that is, being
infinite in wisdom, he needs not that we should express our minds in
multitude of words, for he understands the desires of our hearts, and being
our gracious Father, our wants serve as a loud cry, and eloquent Math. 6. 8.
oration to move him to supply them; and therefore he needs not that we
should use multitude of words to give him notice of those wants which he
already knows before we ask, nor to persuade him to grant our suits, being
more ready to give, then we to crave. And Solomon renders another; Because in
the multitude of words there wants not sin: which Pro. 10. 19.
as it is generally true, so especially in the exercise of prayer: seeing,
through our natural corruption, we are so auerse unto this duty, and in the
performance of it, subject to such coldness, dullness and weariness, that
long prayers are often performed with much negligence, and subject to the
interruptions and distractions of worldly cogitations and wandering thoughts.
And yet we are not so to understand Solomon, and our Savior, as though they
simply commended short prayers, and condemned those that are long: for the
Wiseman himself, at the consecrating of the 1. King. 8. 22. to 54.
Temple, made one of the longest prayers that we read of in the Scriptures:
and our Savior is said to have continued whole nights in prayer. And the
Apostle exhorts us to pray continually, and with all manner of 1. These. 5.
17. Ephesians. 6. 18. Col. 4. 2.
prayer and supplication in the Spirit, watching thereunto with all
perseverance. But they only forbid and condemn hypocritical ostentation, and
superfluity of words, vain repetitions, and opinion of meriting to be heard
for them: or when our words exceed our matter, in their multiplicity and much
babbling, or both our words and matter, our zeal, devotion, and attention.
Neither are such prayers to be condemned for their prolixity, but rather much
to be commended, when as there is no superfluity in our words, to express our
matter and minds, nor any negligence or want of zeal and attention in pouring
them forth before God: for if we have with the length of our prayers, variety
of good matter, attention, and feruency of affection, we cannot be too long in
this holy exercise. And therefore the best rule of direction in this behalf
is, that we fit and proportion our words to our matter, and both matter and
words to our minds and hearts, our faith and feruency, devotion and attention.
For if there be store of this divine fire to kindle it, the more fuel we cast
on, the greater the blaze and heat will be; whereas if there be but some
little fire and small sparks, too much of this fuel cast on at once, will not
help to kindle it, but rather extinguish and put it clean out. In which
regard we are not always to stint our selves to the same proportion and
length of prayer, but to watch the best opportunities, and to diue our selves
deepest in this Poole, when the Spirit of God has descended and moved the
waters. More specially we are ordinarily most fit for long prayers, when our
souls are prepared thereunto, either by extrordinary afflictions, when as our
hearts are full of sorrows, and need a large vent to let them out, and power
out our complaints into Gods bosom; and replenished with fervent desires for
help and deliverance; or by extraordinary benefits, when as they are full of
joy and thankfulness, and so make us to become earnest and unwearied, in
rendering unto God praise and thanksgiving: when as we observe a solemn fast,
and keep unto God a Esa. 26. 16.
day of humiliation, consecrating it wholly to the exercises of religion and
charity, especially prayer and meditation. And finally, at all other times,
when we are fitted thereunto by Gods Spirit, and sufficiently qualified with
the former graces. The which notwithstanding is to be understood of private
prayer by our selves, and not when we pray in the company of others; for then
we are by the rule of charity to have respect unto them, and not to tire their
zeal and devotion, and cause them to sin (through our tedious prolixity) by
weariness and wandering thoughts, although we our selves have a good appetite
to this exercise; for this were to force them to sit long at the table who have
quickly dined, to cloy the weak of disgestion, with variety of dishes, because
we who bear them company have good stomachs; and to constrain young
beginners and children in Christ, to hold out with us in our pace, who are come
to a ripe age, and so to tire for weariness, before they come half way to
their iourneyes end. Which if it deserves to be judged unequal, how much is
our practice worthy to be condemned, if in our meetings we contend to outvie
one another, striving who shall exceed in length of prayers, and variety of
choice words, for the apt expressing of our minds; hereby making prayer like
unto a mastery or race, wherein we contend for the prize of praise, which they
are to win who are swiftest and best at length?

. Sect. 3 Of the quality of our prayers.
The second thing to be considered, is the quality of our speech, which ought
to be such in our prayers, as is fittest both to stir up and express our
zeal and devotion. Wherein we are to avoid two extremes; the first is, curious
affectation of words, seeing the Lord respects not the eloquence of our
speech, but the sincerity of our hearts, and the feruency of our desires, which
are as loud cries, and most perswasiue orations in his ears, when we are most
barren in words. The second is, rudeness of speech, without any fit words, or
good sense, order or coherence, which is caused through negligence, want of
preparation, and of due reverence and respect of Gods glorious Majesty, before
whom we stand, and unto whom we speak, not caring what, nor how we babble in
his presence, though for our credit sake, we would be more careful in
speaking to mortal man not much superior unto us. For otherwise, if it
proceed not from carelessness, but from natural infirmity and want of
utterance (which we may judge of, if we be so in other discourses, and upon
other occasions) our prayers notwithstanding proceeding from upright hearts,
and being joined with zeal and devotion, will be acceptable unto God; yea even
our imperfect speeches, sighs and groans, will as effectually move him to
hear us, and grant our suits, as the most eloquent speeches which have all the
helps and ornaments both of nature and art.

CAP. XVI.
Of the form and method which are to be used and observed in our prayers, etc.

. Sect. 1 Of forms of prayer set down by others.
THe last thing to be considered, respects the form and manner of pouring
forth our souls in prayer unto God, which is either by using set forms, or
contriuing of prayers according to present occasions, as we are enabled
thereunto by the Spirit of God. The former sort are either such as are invented
by others, and learned by hearing, or reading their books and writings: or
else by our selves upon due study and meditation. Both which may be lawfully
and commendably used of Christians according to their several states and
gifts. Written and printed forms by those who want ability to pray in their
own words, or to frame their suits and petitions, and express their minds in
any good manner and order. The which was one end of penning David's Psalms,
that they might by skillful Musicians be sung in the Congregation, and used
also in private, both in families, and by our selves alone. And our Savior
prescribed that perfect form of the Lords Prayer, not only as a rule
according to which we are to frame our prayers, but also as a prayer to be used
it self; and therefore as it is said in one Evangelist, After this Math. 6. 9.
Luke 11. 2.
manner pray ye; so in another, When ye pray, say, Our Father. And therefore as
children, before they can go, are not suffered to sit still, but are trained
and taught by others that hold them by the hand: so though we want spiritual
strength and skill to perform this exercise by our selves, yet we must not
neglect it altogether, but yield our selves to be trained by others (as the
Disciples did desire of our Savior Christ) and (as it were holding them by the
hand) to use the help of their meditations. But we are not to rest in this as
sufficient, without any further proceedings; for though it be fit for a child
in Christ, that he may be thus trained to go alone, yet when we come to a
riper age, and in respect of our means should be able to teach others, it is a
shame for us, and argues either great impotency and lamenesse in Religion, or
else negligence, sloth, and want of exercise, if we cannot go alone, but still
like children, need leading by others. Besides, we cannot by others meditations
unburden our selves of our own particular sins, of which God and our own
consciences only are witnesses, nor express those special wants which most
pinch us, and which we most desire should be supplied, nor fit our occasions to
their prayers, nor their prayers to our occasions; but we must, as God
requires by the Prophet, when we come unto him as suitors, take words unto our
selves, and frame our petitions and thanksgiuings according Hos. 14. 2.
to our own wants and occasions. Neither let any that has been long trained
in the school of Christ, object his want of gifts and abilities, seeing if he
speak true, he proclaims his own shame and non-proficiency. For if we had
any sense of our wants and sins, we might find some words to express them,
that we might crave a supply of the one, and pardon for the other; especially
to our heavenly Father, who is so gracious and willing to bear with our
infirmities, and who better accepts of such imperfect prayers as are indicted
by our selves, and uttered with zealous devotion of honest hearts, then of such
as are in the best manner penned for us by others. Even as every wise father
better accepts of an Epistle invented and written by his own son himself,
though full of imperfections, because it is the means to train him up to more
perfection, then that which is done to his hand by one of his fellows of an
higher form, though much more exact for matter and manner, because it is the
trick of a trewant, and argues not only inability and want of skill, but
also sloth and extreme negligence.

. Sect. 2 Of forms of prayers invented by our selves.
Forms of prayer invented by our selves, are such, as upon due meditation and
sound deliberation we have composed, out of the sight and sense of our sins
and wants, and Gods mercies multiplied upon us, not only general, but also
special and particular, framing confessions, petitions and thankesgiuings, so
as they may be most fitting for our own peculiar use. The which are necessary
for such as are not thoroughly grounded in knowledge, nor perfected in this duty
by much experience and practice; and for such also as being well qualified in
these respects, are notwithstanding defective in memory and utterance, having
no liberty of speech to express their minds without much meditation, and for
such also as are defective in courage and boldness, when they are to pray in
the presence of others: And very profitable for all, if we tie not our selves
too strictly to words, but have variety of forms for ordinary use, and by
help of meditation, do upon extraordinary occasions, conceive new words for
new matter, as the necessity and profit of our selves, our brethren, or the
Church shall require; making particular confessions of sins which are lately
committed, and do most burden the conscience, and special petitions for
those special graces wherein we find our selves most defective, and whereof
we have presently most use, and special thanksgiuings, for Gods special
mercies and favors renewed upon us. The which variety of forms will take away
that satiety and weariness, which always accompanies the daily and
continual use of any thing, though never so excellent; and help much to keep
our minds and hearts close to this holy exercise, which are apt to be carried
away with wandering thoughts, if, without any variety, we tie our selves to one
only form; like a man that goes on in a way which he is accustomed to
travail, and never thinks on the passages and turnings that are in his
journey; or that sings a tune familiar unto him by much use, and never
thinks of that he sings.

. Sect. 3 Of conceived prayers, and how far forth they are commendable.
Prayers conceived, are such as upon meditation we fit to all present
occasions, not using any ordinary form of words, but expressing our selves
Genesis 32. 9. 2. Sam. 22 2. 1. King. 8. 23. Dan. 9. 4. Act. 4. 24. Ioh. 17. 1, 2,
etc.
with such as come to our minds; of which, we have many examples in the
Scriptures, both in the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and our Savior Christ
himself. The which, I acknowledge above all other kinds to be most excellent,
if God have thoroughly furnished us with gifts fit for it, both because it is
most free from distractions and wandering thoughts, and from satiety and
weariness, this variety bringing with it much delight, and also because it is
most opportune and seasonable, being fitted to the time, persons, and
occasions. But here the Proverb is verified, that things excellent are most
hardly attained, there being few that have this gift and ability, and those few
not always in like measure, although there are many that are willing to make
show of it. For there are diverse things which ought to concur in him that is
to conceive a prayer, which if any be wanting, it cannot be done without much
weakness and imperfection. First, he must be diligent in meditation, before
he thus speak unto God, calling to memory the sins which he is to confess,
the wants which he desires should be supplied, and the blessings for which he
intends to give thanks; that so he may with David call his prayer a
meditation, humble his soul in the sight of his unworthiness, inflame his
heart with fervent desires, and not speak any thing rashly with his mouth unto
his Eccl. 5. 1.
God, as the Wise man aduizeth. In which respect, I cannot commend extemporall
prayers, which are performed without any meditation going before, and am so
far from extolling them as most excellent, that I think them scarce
tolerable or lawful, unless some unexpected occasion and present necessity,
do thrust us into extraordinary straights, so as we may not defer our
prayer, nor have for the present, opportunity to meditate, nor yet have any
former meditations fit for the present occasion, and the circumstances that
attend upon it. Secondly, he that thus prays must be grounded in knowledge,
that he may frame his prayers according to Gods will. And therefore they who
being children in knowledge, do take upon them this task, they must needs
fail much in this holy duty, asking according to their ungrounded conceits,
and not Gods will, of which they are ignorant. And as children who will venture
to run alone, before they can go in another hand, must needs catch many
falls; and they also who will speak much, before they have knowledge and
wisdom to rule their tongues, must needs speak many things vain and
impertinent: so must it of necessity befall them in this case who are children
in knowledge, and not well acquainted with Gods will and ways. Thirdly, he
must be well experienced and practiced in this duty; neither can we without
much use attain to this perfection. Fourthly, besides a great measure of
sanctifying grace, he must have diverse common gifts of the Spirit, which are
necessary to the well-performing of this duty, as a good memory, utterance and
liberty of speech, and boldness also when others join with him: which will
enable him to express readily what his mind conceiueth, and rather intend and
inflame, then quench or cool the feruency of his desires. But if we want
these, though our knowledge, and faith, and zeal, and all other sanctifying
graces be never so great, yet shall we fail much in prayer in this kind,
because the powers of the soul will be so wholly occupied about memory, and
invention of fit matter, and words to express it, that there will little place
be left to zeal, devotion, and feruency of affection. Lastly, it is necessary
that he who prays on this manner do carefully avoid spiritual pride, and
ostentation of his gifts, to which the greatest excellencies, through the
malice of Satan and our own corruption are most subject; and also curious
affectation of variety of words to express the same matter, as though it were
a note of barrenness to use twice the same phrases to express the same
things. But the maine thing which we are to aim at, is to be fervent and
devout in our prayers, and to this end to use such words and phrases as may
most conveniently lay open unto God the sincere desires of an upright heart,
whether it be in new variety, or in such words as we have often used to
express the same things.

Sect. 4 What method is best to be observed in disposing the parts of our
prayers.
Unto the form of prayer, we may add something of the method and right
disposing of the parts. The parts of prayer to be used ordinarily of us are
three: confession, petition, and thanksgiving. In our private confessions of
our sins, we are (having first a true sense and feeling, hatred and detestation
of the^) to acknowledge them, and bewail them, not only generally, but also
specially and particularly, and those above the rest which we have last
committed, and with which we have most often and grievously displeased and
dishonored God, and wounded our own consciences, according to the example of
David, in the one and fiftieth Psalm; and withal aggrauate them by their
several circumstances, especially the consideration of the person against whom
they were committed, our glorious God and gracious Father in Jesus Christ;
adiudging and condemning our selves in regard of them, to be less then the
least of Gods mercies, and worthy of his greatest plagues and punishments. Unto
which we are to adioyne petition, and first, that God for his mercies sake, his
promise sake, and his Christ's sake, will forgive us all our sins, and never
lay them to our charge, seeing our Savior has fully satisfied his Justice for
them; and so, that being justified and freed from the guilt and punishment of
our sins, he will be reconciled unto us, and receive us into his love and
favor. Secondly, that God will be pleased to seal up the assurance hereof in
our hearts and consciences, by the gracious testimony of his holy Spirit, and
give unto us the spirit of Adoption, crying in our hearts, Romans 8. 15.
Abba Father, and witnessing to our spirits, that we are his children by
adoption and grace. Thirdly, that he will sanctify us by the same Spirit,
mortifying and crucifying in us more and more our sinful corruptions, so as
they may not rule and reign in us, as at former times, and that he will also
quicken us unto holiness and newness of life, and enable us to yield
obedience to his holy and heavenly will. Fourthly, that he will to these ends
graciously vouchsafe unto us the means which may enable us unto them, and make
them effectual by his good blessing upon them. Especially, that he will indue
us with the sanctifying gifts and graces of his holy Spirit; as saving
knowledge, a lively faith, unfeigned repentance, firm affiance, fervent love,
and ardent zeal, hope, patience, humility, the true fear of God, and the
rest. Fifthly, that God will daily increase his graces in us, and our strength
and ability to serve him, that we may grow from one measure to another, until
we come to a perfect age in Christ. Sixthly, that he will establish us with his
free Spirit, that we may constantly persevere in the profession and practice of
true godliness, unto the end, and in the end; and that he will thereby so assist
and strengthen us against all the assaults of our spiritual enemies, that we
may have victory over them, and not be hindered by their tentations, from
proceeding in our course of godliness, or from finishing the great work of
our salvation. Seventhly, we must heereunto add petitions for special
benefits, whereof we stand in need, concerning things either temporal, or
spiritual and eternal; and particularly such as are necessary and profitable
for the well passing of the day following, especially preservation from all
dangers, direction in all our courses, our thoughts, words, and actions, and
the blessing of God upon all our labors, with a right use of all Gods benefits
and chastisements. Finally, we must pray for the good estate of the whole
Church, of that in which we live, and for all the principal members of it;
for our friends and benefactours, for the afflicted, for those of the same
family, and such unto whom we are bound by any special bond of duty. And
lastly, we must from petition descend to thanksgiving, praising God for all his
blessings, both corporal, spiritual, and eternal; and especially for those
peculiar benefits which he has vouchsafed unto us in the whole course of our
lives; for those of late received; and namely, the night past in our
preservation and quiet rest. And this I hold to be the best method and order
to be observed in our prayers ordinarily, although I would tie no man unto it,
but that he may herein use his discretion, beginning with confession,
thanksgiving, or petition, as his heart leads him, and fit occasion shall be
offered.

. Sect. 5 What duties are to be performed after we have prayed.
And these are the duties which are to be daily performed in this holy
exercise of prayer. Now after we have thus prayed, there are certain other
things required of us. First, a lively faith, whereby we do not only give our
unfeigned assent unto our prayer made, but also rest persuaded, that the Lord
has heard us in the things for which we have prayed, and will assuredly accept
of our humiliation and thanksgiving, and grant all our suites and requests, as
it will best stand with his own glory, our spiritual good, and eternal
happiness. And this our Savior requires, What Mark. 11. 24.
things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye shall receive them,
and ye shall have them. Secondly, hope, patience, and humility, whereby we make
no haste, nor prescribe unto God any time of doing the things which we have
desired, but meekely acknowledging his infinite wisdom in himself, and
goodness toward us, do resign wholly our selves and suites unto his good
pleasure, expecting with all patience his leisure, when as he shall think it
fittest to bestow upon us those gifts and graces which we have begged at his
hands. Thirdly, there is required of us after prayer, an earnest endeavor in
the use of all good means, whereby we may obtain those things which we have
prayed for: whereby we shall serve Gods providence, and be his instruments to
further the accomplishment of his promises, and also make it manifest, that in
our hearts we sincerely desired those things which we begged with our mouths.
For example, after we have prayed for the pardon of our sins, we must use
carefully all good means whereby we may be further assured that God has
forgiven them; after we have craved sanctification, we must labor and endeavor
that we may be sanctified, and exercise our selves in the duties of holiness;
after we have desired spiritual and saving graces, we must use all the helps
and means whereby we may attain unto them. For otherwise we shall discover
our selves to be but mere hypocrites, who with our lips have prayed for those
things which we have neither esteemed in our judgments, nor affected in our
hearts; and therefore receive nothing at Gods hands, who gives his gifts not
to idle loyterers, but unto such as pursue them with thirsting desires, and
earnestly labor and endeavor in the use of all good means whereby they may
obtain them.

. Sect. 6 Of the time in the morning when we are to use private prayer.
The last direction which I will set down for our private prayer in the
morning, respects the time when it is to be performed; of which, though I
can give no necessary rule, because all men's occasions and opportunities are
not alike, yet for the greatest part it is most convenient that we do it
betimes, as soon as we are ready, before we undertake any worldly business,
and have our minds taken up with any earthly thoughts: Because we shall then
be most free from all encumbrances which may distract us in this holy
exercise, and make us less fit to perform it as we ought; as also, because
if we offer unto God the first fruits of our thoughts and affections, they will
sanctify all our following endeavors, and season them so with holiness, that
they will become more acceptable unto God. Or if some extraordinary occasion
and weighty business have caused us to defer it, our second care must be,
that we do not neglect it altogether, but sequestring our minds and
affections from all earthly thoughts and wordly employments, we must take the
next and best opportunity which shall be offered unto us; and think no excuse
or business so important, as may make us utterly to omit it.

. Sect. 7 Of prayer with the rest of the family.
The next duty of piety after our private prayer, is prayer with the rest of
the family; which is to be performed ordinarily by the master and governor,
who is to be the mouth of the rest to commend them and their suits unto God.
For, according to the example of the Patriarchs and holy men in times past, he
ought to be not only a governor to rule them, and a Prophet to teach and
instruct them, but also a Priest to offer the sacrifice of prayer and
thanksgiving, not only for himself, but also for all those that are
committed to his charge: neither ought any man to think that he may be
exempted from this duty, or that in respect of his honor and greatness, he
may be privileged from this holy service unto God, and as an inferior duty,
delegate it to his deputy, if he himself be able to perform it; but rather
with the holy Patriarchs to esteem it an honorable prerogative, which he
will no more put off from himself to another, then he will the regiment and
government of his house and family. Much less must we think it sufficient,
that we have prayed alone, or content our selves with our private devotions,
if we have others under our government, and committed to our charge: seeing we
are to take no less care of their souls then of their bodies; nor that they
serve us in the duties of their callings, then that they serve God in the
duties of piety and Christianity, without which we can expect no blessing upon
their labors. For if Joshua, though a great Captain and Commander, and so
greatly employed both in wars and government, would not hereby excuse
himself, but undertakes for all in his family, that he and his household would
serve Josh. 24. 25.
the Lord: if David, though a King, would not content himself with his Psalm.
101. 3.
integrity in the government of the State, but voweth also that he would
perform all domestical duties with a perfect heart: And if Solomon, though a
mighty Monarch in the height of his honor, thought himself more honored in
being the mouth of the whole people to commend their suits unto God; let not
any man think himself so great, that he is too good to perform this duty.
But alas, the neglect hereof is grown so ancient among honorable personages,
that it now pleads prescription; so that these family duties are wholly
neglected, or else put off from themselves to be performed by a deputy. And
little hope I have that my writings and reasons should be so powerful as to
infringe this custom, which has in it almost the strength of a law, and
revoke the practice of family duties unto ancient perfection; and yet I thought
it fit to speak the truth, and leave the success to the author of it:
neither thought I it convenient in setting down the rules of piety, that I
should fit the straight square to the general crookedness of the work, but
to leave it in its perfection, that the work in Gods good time may be reduced
unto it. Let therefore all masters of families know, that it is their duty
which God will require of them, not only to pray by themselves, but also to
call together all their family, and to join with them in this holy exercise:
unto which they may be encouraged by Gods gracious promise, that where two or
three be gathered together in Christ's name, there he will be in the Math. 18.
20.
midst of them. Secondly, because by making their house a house of prayer, they
shall make it a little temple, which God will fill with his presence, and
replenish with his blessings, both temporal and spiritual. Thirdly, because
nurturing their children and servants in the fear of the Lord, and exercising
them in this duty of Gods service, they shall make them more faithful and
conscionable in performing all duty and service unto themselves, not only
formally and in outward appearance, but cheerfully and from the heart.
Fourthly, because it is the chief means of the preservation of the whole
house and family from sin and from danger, and of deriuing Gods manifold
blessings upon the whole society. Lastly, because they can no otherwise expect
that God will prosper their labors, Psalm. 127. 1, 2.
to the good of the master, and the whole house and family, unless they use
the means which he has ordained, and obtain his blessing by their daily
prayers; without which they shall not thrive in their labors, but spend their
endeavors and strength in vain. Now for the time of the morning when this duty
is to be performed, no certain rule can be prescribed; only this in general,
that it be then done, when as all, or the most of the family may, in respect of
their common occasions, most conveniently assemble together. And although it
were to be wished, that it may be betimes in the morning, before they go about
their worldly business, that they may be free from distraction, and sanctify
all their following labors by these good beginnings: yet because the
employments are diverse in almost all the members of the family, and require
that some should go about them sooner, and some later; and because it often
falls out that the governors, by reason of age, weakness, or other
infirmities, cannot rise so soon as others, because they must have regard to
their health; therefore if in these respects this time cannot be allotted to
this service, some other which is most convenient may be chosen: which if it
can be no sooner, in regard of the common meeting together of the whole
household, it will be fit that it be done before dinner. Of which, the less
inconvenience will follow, if every one in the family, and the governors for
all the rest, have betimes performed this duty privately by themselves.

CAP. XVII.
Of singing Psalms, and reading the Scriptures in the family.

. Sect. 1 That singing of Psalms is enjoined in the Scriptures, and practiced
by the faithful.
Unto prayer we adioyne that holy exercise of singing Psalms in the family,
which though it be not in practice next in order, according to ordinary use,
yet I would not sever it from the former, seeing it is a religious duty, and
like unto it, being a notable means whereby we praise God, and render unto
him thanks for all his benefits. And though it be not tied unto any part of
the day; nor yet every day to be necessarily performed; and though in no
family it be always alike seasonable, as in the time of mourning for some
private or public calamity, but in the time of rejoicing, when we have
occasion to praise Gods holy name for his gifts and blessings conferred on us,
according to the Apostles rule, Is any man among Iam. 5. 13.
you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing Psalms. And though in
some families it can seldom be done for want of leisure and opportunity,
unless it be on the Sabbath, and in some places not then, for want of
convenient company to join together; yet where it may conveniently be
performed in respect of company, leisure, and other occasions, it is an
excellent duty, which is no ways to be neglected. For first it is enjoined in
the Scriptures. The Prophet David in many places exhorts to it, O come (says
he) let us sing unto the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the Psalm. 95, 1,
2.
Rock of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and
Psalm. 100. 1, 2.
make a joyful noise unto him with Psalms. Make a joyful noise unto the
Lord, all ye lands, serve the Lord with gladness, come before his presence
with singing. Sing aloud unto God our strength, make a joyful noise unto the
God of Jacob, etc. Psalm. 81. 3. and 47. 6. and 68. 4. Esa. 42. 10.
Sing unto him a new song, play skilfully with a loud noise. So the Prophet
Esaias, Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth.
And Jeremy, Sing ye unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord, for he has delivered
the Ier. 20. 13.
soul of the poor out of the hands of evil doers. The Apostle Paul likewise
exhorts us, to speak unto the Lord in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual
Ephesians. 5. 19. Iam. 5. 13.
Songs, singing and making melody in our hearts to the Lord. Of which, we have
the Saints of God in all ages examples for our imitation, in the time both of
the Law and the Gospel, and in the purest ages of the primitive Church, who
were complained on to the persecuting Emperors, for their diligent performance
of this duty day and night. Yea, our Savior Christ himself at the celebration
of his last Supper, is said with his Disciples to have concluded that holy
action, with singing of a Psalm. Which examples, that we may imitate, let us
further consider in the next place, that it is a notable means to rowze up our
drowzie and dead hearts, and by the sweet melody affecting our outward sense,
to ravish them with joyful delight, and make them cheerful in Gods service,
which was the cause why Elizeus being to prophecy, and finding his Spirit
dulled with the unpleasing presence of the idolatrous King, who together 2.
King. 3. 15.
with Iehosaphat was to have the benefit of his good endeavors, desires a
Musician to play before him, to stir up his heart unto the more cheerful
performance of this duty. Secondly, it is an acceptable service unto God, as
being a singular means to glorify him, when as our hearts are filled with
thankfulness, and our mouths with his praises; according to that of the
Psalmist, Whosoever offers praise, glorifieth me; the which, in the Psalm. 50. 23.
same Psalm he prefers before oblations and burnt sacrifices. Finally,
Verse. 13. 14. Apoc. 5. 9. and 14. 3.
it is an heavenly exercise of the glorified Saints, which we shall perform
with them in that place of joy and happiness, if we take delight in it whilst
we live in the earth.

. Sect. 2 How we may sing Psalms in a right manner.
Now if we would perform this in an acceptable manner, our care must be that it
be done with our souls as well as our tongue and lips. And first with our
minds, both understanding what we sing, so as we may say with the Apostle; I
will sing with the Spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also; and
applying our minds unto it with due attention, and not suffering them to be
carried with wandering thoughts. Secondly, we must sing with our hearts also,
according to that of the Apostle; Speak to your selves in Psalms, singing
Ephesians. 5. 19.
and making melody in your heart unto the Lord; which elsewhere he calls,
singing with grace in our hearts to the Lord; the which David practiced; Col.
3. 16.
I will praise thee (says he) with my whole heart. And this we shall do, if
we Psalm. 138.
do apply and fit them to the matter of the Psalm, and put on the same
affection which David had in penning them; as humility in the confession of
sin, feruencie of desire in petitions and suites; alacrity and cheerfulness
in praises and thanksgiuings; assent and belief in prophecies and predictions;
teachablenesse and willingness to learn in doctrines and instructions;
readiness to obey in commandments and exhortations, etc. and at all times and
in all things, reverence of Gods majesty, in whose presence we perform this
duty. In the mean time we must take heed, that we do not apply his
imprecations, which were uttered by a prophetical spirit against those who
were desperate enemies to God as well as David, against our private enemies,
with a reuengefull desire, that those evils may befall them, seeing our Savior
has taught us to pray for them. But we must either make use of them for
doctrine and instruction, or if we apply them, it must not be against
particular persons, but against all those whatsoever whom the Lord in his
wisdom knows to be desperate enemies unto him and his Church. Secondly, our
care must be that we do not make it a bodily exercise, singing Psalms for
recreation only, and as we do other songs, for mere pleasure and sensual
delight, but we must perform it as a religious duty of Gods service, and
strive in it to please him rather then our selves. We must not seek to delight
the ear, and affect the heart with the air, music and sweetness of the
tune, but that there being an harmony between it and the voice, we make sweet
melody in Gods ears; which if it be wanting, our best music (as one says)
is no Aug. Confess. lib. 10. cap 33.
more acceptable to God, then the barking of Dogs, the lowing of Oxen, or the
grunting of Hogs. Yea, as the same Author says, If I be delighted more with
the music then with the matter, in stead of serving God, I fearfully sin.
And therefore division and fraction of voice, broken repetitions and reports,
which take away the sense, hinder the understanding, both of the singer and
hearer, and tend only to affect the ear with the melody, and not the heart
with the matter, are not to be used in this holy exercise. For this is to sing,
not like men endued with reason, but rather Aug. enarrat. in Psalm. 18.
like birds, which are sensible only of the tune, but have no understanding of
the matter and ditty.

. Sect. 3 That we must diligently read the Scriptures, and the great profit of
this exercise.
Unto prayer and praising of God by singing of Psalms, we are to adioyne
another religious exercise, which is reading of the Scriptures and other holy
writings; of which we will only here speak, as it is a daily duty to be
performed of us, referring the more full handling of it unto another place,
when we are to entreat of the means whereby we may be enabled to lead a
godly life. Here let it suffice to show, that it is a duty no day to be
neglected, if we can borrow any time from other necessary imploiments, and
find any convenient leisure and fit opportunity to perform it. For whereas we
should labor after a daily increase in spiritual graces, there is scarce any
means more effectual for this purpose; seeing it is a notable help for the
inlightning of our minds in the knowledge of God and his will, according unto
which we are to frame our lives; for the Word of God is a lamp unto our eyes,
and a light unto our paths; it inlighteneth the Psalm. 119. 105. Psalm. 19. 7, 8.
Pro. 1. 4.
eyes, and gives understanding unto the simple. It gives wisdom to the
ignorant, and to the young man knowledge and discretion. It is a singular help
for the strengthening of our faith, when as we have daily before our eyes the
covenant of grace, and the sweet promises of the Gospel made unto us in Jesus
Christ; and observe the infinite mercies of God extended to all, without
respect of persons who have believed and trusted in him. It much inflameth our
love toward God, when in reading of them we observe his love toward us; and
makes us zealous of his glory, when we take notice of the infinite bounty of
our Lord and Master, and what a rich rewarder he is of our poor and imperfect
service. It will serve for a looking-glass, wherein we may see our spots and
spiritual deformities, and be directed also by it to reform and amend them.
It is a fit guide in the time of prosperity, which will teach us to use Gods
blessings aright, so as they may be, not only truly comfortable in
themselves, but also as they are pledges of Gods love, and earnest pennies of
our salvation. It will be our comforter in our adversity, whilst it teaches
us so to profit by them, as that they may be signs of our adoption, and
notable means to assure us of Gods love and our own salvation. It contains
in it the evidences of our heavenly inheritance, and teaches us how to get
them into our own keeping without fear of losing them; and who cannot daily
with much comfort spend some time in perusing these assurances, wherein so rich
and glorious a Kingdom is ratified unto him? It is a divine treasury of all
spiritual and heavenly riches; and who is so unwisely moderate in his
spiritual desires, as not once in a day to please his eye with the sight of
these treasures? Finally, it is our spiritual armorie, in which is munition of
all kinds, and all sorts of weapons, fit to defend our selves, and offend our
enemies; and therefore seeing we are daily in the Christian warfare, and
continually assaulted by the enemies of our salvation, why should we not also
daily go into this armory to fit our selves with spiritual armor, and to
take out of it the most prevailing weapons? Now for the time of the day when
this duty must be performed; in respect of private reading it cannot be
limited, but must be left to be prescribed by men's leisure and opportunity.
And for that which is used as a family-exercise, it is most seasonable, as I
take it, before prayer, either morning or evening, because then they are
assembled together, and multitudes of occasions will hardly admit of often
meetings.

CAP. XVIII.
Of our daily exercise in the duties of our callings, and of diverse virtues
required in them.

Sect. 1 That we must make choice of lawful callings.
Having thus begun the day by the performance of these religious duties, we
must in the next place betake our selves to the duties of our lawful callings.
Neither can we sufficiently approve our selves unto God, if we do not join
these with the other, for he will be served, not only in the general duties
of Christianity, but also in those special duties which are peculiar unto
those places and callings in which he has set us, either in the Church or
Commonwealth. Neither is it sufficient for him who is called to be a
Magistrate, Minister, Master of a family, or servant, that he perform those
duties which are common unto him with all Christians, unless he also with like
care and endeavor, perform those special duties which belong to his own
place and calling. And here first is required, that our calling be lawful,
and agreeable to Gods will and Word; that is, such an one, as our labors in it
may tend to Gods glory, the good of the Church and Common wealth, and the
furthering not only of our temporal, but also our spiritual good, and the
eternal salvation of our souls; and not such as being unlawful hinders
these ends; as those that live by unlawful Arts and Trades, Players,
Gamesters, and such like; for then the greater pains we take in such
callings, the greater is our sin, the more we dishonor God, hurt our
neighbors, and hinder our own salvation. Secondly, that we be in some
measure qualified with such gifts as are fit for our callings; for those whom
God calls unto any place, he furnishes them with such competencie of gifts,
as that they may profitably perform the duties required unto it. And if our
calling be lawful, and we thus fitted for it, then may we say with the
Apostle Paul, that we are called by the will of God, and may with
cheerfulness 2. Cor. 1. 1.
and comfort go on in it, expecting his blessing upon our labors, and in the
end of our lives, a rich reward for doing him therein faithful service.
Thirdly, our minds and hearts must be settled in our callings, so as we neither
shift and change, unless it be upon weighty and necessary causes, nor intrude
and busy our selves in the callings of others; for this were to overthrow all
order, and bring confusion into Church and Common wealth; and to cross Gods
wise providence in the government of the world, who has given variety of
gifts, which he has appointed to be exercised in variety of callings, that
being helpefull and serviceable mutually unto one another, humane societies
might be preserved, and peace and love nourished in them. And therefore as in a
well-gouerned Army, every one keeps his place and station unto which his
General has designed him, and not only serves him generally as a Soldier,
but in that place and office unto which he is appointed and chosen: So must we
demean our selves toward our great Commander, and not think it enough to
perform good duties, unless we do those which belong to our callings; not
out of fancy and fickle inconstancy, leaving our station; but as the Apostle
requires, abide in the same calling wherein God has placed us. 1. Cor. 7. 20,
24.


. Sect. 2 That we must be regenerate, before we can serve God acceptably in our
callings.
But it is not sufficient that we be settled in a lawful calling, and that we
painfully perform the duties that are required in it (for this a mere
worldling may do out of carnal and earthly respects, either for his own
pleasure, credit, or profit) but that we so carry and demean our selves in it,
as that we may by our labors and endeavors glorify God, further our own
salvation, and advance the good of the Church and Common wealth. Unto which,
diverse things are required, some whereof respect our persons, and some the
actions and duties which we perform. Unto our persons there is required, that
we be regenerate and sanctified. For our persons must be accepted, before any
of our works can please God, and be holy and righteous, before we can bring
forth the fruits of holiness and righteousness. For as unto the pure all
things are pure: so unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, Tit. 1. 15.
Pro. 21. 27. verse 4.
is nothing pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled. And if the
sacrifices of the wicked are abominable, and their very prayers are turned
into sin; how much more are the ordinary works of their callings sinful
and odious in Gods sight? Neither can such as are unsanctified expect any
blessing of God upon their labor, or that they should prosper Psalm. 1. 3. and
112. 1, 2. etc. Psalm. 128. 1.
in any thing which they do or take in hand, seeing by Gods promise, this
privilege is limited unto the righteous and such as fear him.

Sect. 3 That we must perform the duties of our callings in faith.
Unto the actions also and duties of our callings, that they may be acceptable
unto God, diverse things are required. And these are either such virtues and
graces which go before, as being the causes of all our good actions and
proceedings, or such as do accompany and attend upon them. Of the former sort,
the first and principal is a true and lively faith, whereby I understand not
only a justifying faith which assures us of the remission of our sins, and
of the love and favor of God, and which by uniting Hab. 11. 6. John 15. 5.
Romans 14. 23.
us unto the true vine Christ, does enable us in him to bring forth the fruits
of righteousness, without which we cannot please God, nor do any good thing,
seeing all we do is sin; but also a particular act of this faith, whereby
we are persuaded that our callings and the duties which we perform in them
being pleasing unto God, the Lord will give a blessing upon all our labors and
endeavors. For which purpose our faith must have a warrant and ground out of
Gods Word, both inioyning these duties, and promising a blessing unto the
performance of them. And thus shall we Hab. 2. 4.
live the life of faith, which is so often commended unto us in the Scriptures,
when as therein we do not only the religious duties of Gods service, but also
the duties of our callings, whereby we shall be encouraged to go forward in
them with all alacrity and cheerfulness, when as we are assured that God will
bless those labors which himself has required; and not be dismayed with
those crosses and troubles which befall us in them, seeing we are sure, that by
Gods blessing and gracious assistance, we shall overcome them, and have a good
end and issue of all our labors.

Sect. 4 That the duties of our callings must proceed from Love.
Secondly, the duties of our callings must proceed out of unfeigned love
toward God and our neighbors, which is the fountain of all true obedience,
and not principally from self-love or love of the world, which being poisonous
roots of all sin, will taint all our works and actions which spring from
them. They must arise from the love of God, which moves those in whom it is,
to consecrate wholly unto him their lives and labors, in all things desiring to
serve him, who so loves us, and whom we so love, both in the immediate duties
of his worship, and also in the ordinary duties of our callings. And this is
done, when as we labor in them, not first and chiefly for worldly gain and
advantage, thereby to please our selves; but in obedience to Gods Commandment,
who requires these duties of us, studying in all things to please him, and
that our actions both for the matter and manner may be approved and accepted in
his sight. Secondly, we must perform the duties of our callings out of love
toward our neighbors, seeking in them their good 1. Cor. 13. 5. Gal. 5. 13.
as well as our own, seeing true charity seeks not her own, but is also
serviceable unto others: which if we do, then will we not wrong them, to
benefit our selves, nor gain by their loss; we will not deprive them of some
great good, to get unto our selves some small advantage; neither will we be so
wholly intent and greedily gripple in following our own business, but that we
will spare them some of our time, and afford them our best help, when their
necessity shall require our assistance, and reason, charity and conscience
shall bind us to afford it.

. Sect. 5 That they must be directed to right ends.
Thirdly, as our labors must arise from these causes, so they must be
directed to right ends. As first and principally to Gods glory, which in 1.
Cor. 10. 31.
all we do, we must labor to advance. Neither is God only glorified when
we profess and practice religious duties, but also when we walk conscionably
in our callings, and with all diligence perform the duties required in them in
obedience to his Commandments. Secondly, we must propound unto our selves in
them the good of the Church and Common wealth, which we are to prefer before
our own private, and so carry our selves in all things, as that we may be
profitable members in these societies. In which regard we must not seek to
gain by the common loss, but neglect our own particular, when as it will not
stand with the public and general good. Thirdly, we must in all our labors
aim so at our own profit, as that we join therewith the welfare and benefit
of our neighbors, whom by the Law of charity we are to love as we love our
selves; and not raise our gain out of their loss and disadvantage, as it is
the common custom of the world. But as we profess our selves members of the
same body, so must we, as becomes members, aim chiefly at the preservation
of the whole, and then at the joint good one of another, not thinking those
goods well gotten, which are raised and gained out of our neighbors loss.

. Sect. 6 That the duties of our callings must be performed after a right
manner, and first, with heavenly minds.
And these things are to be observed in the labors of our callings, in
respect of their causes both efficient and final. In the next place our care
must be, that we perform them after a right manner; unto which is required
that we be exercised in our earthly business, with heavenly minds and
affections, and not suffer our worldly employments so wholly to take us up both
in soul and body, as that thereby we should be hindered from having our
conversation in heaven. But like Citizens of heaven, and pilgrims on earth,
whilst our bodies are travailing in worldly employments, we must have our
minds, hearts and affections lifted up in spiritual and heavenly meditations
and desires, contemplating and longing after the joys of our own country,
and not so much minding the things beneath, as the things above, where Christ
sits at the right Phil. 3 20. Col. 3. 1, 2.
hand of God. Especially, we must not neglect in the midst of our ordinary
business, to lift up our hearts often unto God, either craving his blessing in
the beginning of our work, or giving him thanks and praise in the end; and
not suffer our thoughts to be so wholly set upon our bodily employments, and
earthly objects, as not sometimes to fix them upon spiritual and heavenly
things. For it worldlings and citizens of the earth, are seldom or never so
intent upon their works and present employments, but that their minds and
hearts will take liberty of wandering after those carnal pleasures wherein they
most delight; let it be a shame for us, who profess our selves Citizens of
heaven, so wholly to mind earthly objects, as never to find leisure to think
of the joys of our own Country, or of the spiritual means whereby we may
be enabled to attain unto them. As therefore we are to avoid Monkish sloth
and idleness, giving over the painful labors of our callings, under
pretense of contemplation; so are we with no less care to avoid the contrary
extreme, of turning worldlings, and being earthly-minded; having our minds and
hearts so wholly fixed upon worldly things, as that we can find no leisure to
think upon those which are spiritual and heavenly. But we must be so employed
in the duties of our callings, as that we neglect not the general duties of
Christianity, and the exercises of Religion in their due time; nor be so intent
and earnest in pursuing momentany gain and worldly profit, as that in the
mean time, through spiritual sloth, we suffer any of Gods saving graces,
heavenly thoughts, or holy affections and desires, to be cooled and quenched
in us. We must so play the good husbands, as that we do not forget Christ's
counsel; First seek the Kingdom of God, Mat. 22. 2, 3, 4.
and his righteousness, and not be so taken up with our Oxen, farms, and
earthly matches and marriages, as to neglect the means whereby we may be
fitted to come as worthy ghests to the marriage of the Kings son. We must
choose with the Philosopher, rather to neglect our Aristippus apud Plut. de
tranquil. animi.
farms then our souls; and suffer some weeds to grow in our fields, rather
then to have our minds ouergrowne with vices, or to lose any good opportunity
of weeding them out, or of sowing in them the seeds of Gods graces.

. Sect. 7 That the duties of our callings must be sanctified by the Word and
prayer.
Secondly, unto the performing of the duties of our callings after a right
manner, there is required that we sanctify them by the Word and 1. Tim. 4. 5.
prayer. The former is done, when as we do nothing but that for which we have
our warrant out of the holy Scriptures, and use them as the rule and squire,
according to which we frame all our actions, doing that which the Word of God
requires, and leaving that undone which it forbids and condemns. The
which is to be observed, both in respect of the matter and works themselves,
and also the manner and circumstances, doing all things both in substance and
form, as it requires and directs. The latter is performed, when as by
prayer we desire Gods blessing upon all our labors, and render unto him
praise and thanksgiving, when we have obtained it, and have succeeded and
prospered in the works of our hands. And this the Apostle requires in all our
affairs; Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
Jesus, giving Col. 3. 17.
thanks to God, and the Father by him. The necessity whereof will plainly
appear, if we consider, that it is Gods blessing only which makes rich, and
causes us to thrive and prosper in all the works of our Pro. 10. 22.
hands. That it alone inableth us to build goodly houses, and causes our Deuteronomy.
8. 13, 18.
herds and our flocks, our silver and gold, and all that we have to multiply:
and that he only gives us power to get wealth. That it is he, who at his
pleasure gives and takes away, makes poor and rich, brings low, and
lifts Job 1. 21.
up, raising the poor out of the dust, and lifting up the beggar from the
dunghill, to set them among Princes, and to make them inherit the Throne of
glory; 1. Sam. 2. 8. Psalm. 113. 7.
As we see in the example of Abraham and Lot, who by the blessing of Genesis 13.
5, 6.
God upon their labors, waxed so rich, that the land was not able to bear
them that they might dwell together; and of Isaac, who being a soiourner and
stranger in the land, prospered in all his labors, and sowing the ground,
received in the same year an hundred fold, because the Lord blessed him. And
in Jacob, who passing over Iordane like a poor Pilgrim, Genesis 26. 3, 12.
with his staff in his hand, at his return back again was multiplied in
Genesis 32. 10.
wealth. Whereas contrariwise, if Gods blessing be wanting (as we are not
likely to have it unless we crave it) all our labors and endeavors will be
spent in vain; For except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain Psalm.
127. 1, 2.
that build it; except the Lord keep the City, the watchman waketh but in
vain; It is in vain for us to rise early, to sit up late, and to eat the
bread of sorrows, not affording our selves a good meals meat, out of our
earnest desire to become rich. For if we neglect Gods service, the Lord will
blow upon our labors, and then though we sow much, we shall bring in little;
we shall Hag. 1. 6, 9.
eat, but not have enough; we shall drink, but not be satisfied; clothe our
selves, and not be warm; and earning wages for our work, we shall not be
the richer, but put it all into a bag with holes. Or if our labors prosper for
the increasing of worldly wealth; yet Gods blessing being wanting, it shall do
us more hurt then good, bringing with it no sound comfort and contentment, but
carking care, fear, and grief; whereas the blessing of the Lord makes rich,
and he adds no sorrow with it, as the Wiseman speaks. Pro. 10. 22.
And if we thus perform the duties of our callings, in love toward God, and
in obedience to his commandment, and desire by prayer his blessing upon our
labors, and yield him praise when he has vouchsafed to give it, then shall we
therein do service unto God, though our condition and the works of our
vocation be never so mean and base, as well as in hearing the Word, or
receiving the Sacrament, or in performing the most excellent duty which he has
commanded, seeing though they differ in the matter, yet not in respect of our
mind, and manner of doing them. And so we may be assured, not only that the
Lord will prosper us in them, and give them such good success in this world,
as shall be most fitting for his glory and our spiritual good, but also will
richly reward them, among other duties of his service, with everlasting joy and
happiness in the life to come. The which argument the Apostle uses to
persuade servants to walk faithfully in their calling, obeying their masters,
according to Col. 3. 23, 24.
the flesh, and herein performing their duty, with all cheerfulness and
singleness of heart, as unto the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the
Lord they should receive the reward of the inheritance, because in serving
their masters, they served him.

. Sect. 8 Of the virtues which must accompany us in the duties of our callings.
The next thing to be considered, is the virtues which ought to accompany us in
the right and religious performance of the duties of our callings. For
howsoever all virtues and graces are necessary unto the person that must thus
walk acceptably before God, and scarce any can be wanting to the
well-performing of any good action; yet there are some which more specially and
properly belong to these duties of our callings, and do so immediately
concern them, that they can in no good sort be done of us, unless in some
measure we be qualified with them. As first, knowledge and judgment, whereby
we must be enabled to discern between good and evil, right and wrong, which
must be our light to guide us in all our ways, and our loade-starre to direct
us in all our courses, which if it be wanting, we shall walk in darkness,
and be apt to fall into many errors. Secondly, affiance in God, whereby we
cast our selves upon his promises and providence in the use of lawful means;
the which the Psalmist requires of us; Commit thy way (says he) unto the
Lord, trust also in him, and Psalm. 37. 5.
he shall bring it to pass. The which we may more easily do, if we rightly
consider our Saviors argument which he uses to the same purpose; for if the
Lord take care to feed the fowls of the air, which take no care for
themselves; and clotheth the lillies of the field, which neither toil nor
spin, how much more will he provide for us all things necessary, who rest upon
him in the use of all lawful courses, and take moderate care, and Mat. 6. 25,
28.
convenient pains to serve his providence? which affiance, if it be wanting,
we shall be subject to innumerable discouragements, macerate our selves with
carking care, and rush, upon all occasions, into the use of unlawful means,
when lawful are wanting; thereby shifting for our selves, because we have no
assurance that God will provide for us. Thirdly, we must be accompanied with a
good conscience both toward God and toward men, and willing with the Apostle,
to live honestly, we must with Act. 24. 16.
him keep it in all things. For having always in our company this Monitour
Heb. 13. 18.
and Judge, it will notably preserve us from all secret sins, and crafty
conueyances, whereby we are naturally apt to wrong our neighbors, that we may
benefit our selves; from all halting, dissembling, and double dealing, when as
it may be so cunningly and closely carried, that respect of our credit, worldly
shame, nor legal punishment are no sufficient bonds to restrain us from them;
and from sloth and unfaithfulness in performing our duties; when no eye of man
can take notice of it. Fourthly, we must have contentation for our companion,
whereby we are in all things contented with Gods good pleasure, and think that
estate and condition best for us in which he has placed us, giving indifferent
welcome to prosperity or adversity, poverty or riches, gain or loss, because
they are messengers alike of his sending; and though some more then others do
in rougher terms deliver his message, yet when we do entertain them aright,
they all assure us of his love, as being means to further our salvation. And
of this we have an example in the Apostle Paul; Who had learned Phil. 4. 12.
both, how to be abased and how to abound, to be full and to be hungry, to
exceed and suffer want. Unto which if we attain; then shall we not be
discontented with the baseness of our callings, nor envy others their greater
preferments, their less labors and more gains; we shall not be set upon the
rack of ambition, aspiring daily after higher dignity, seeing the place in
which we are, being of Gods appointing, is most fitting for us. Neither can any
calling be thought too base for us, wherein acceptable service may be offered
unto God, yea wherein he joins with us as our helper and assistant, and
rewards the pains which we take in them, with no less wages then an heavenly
inheritance. We shall be preserved from that deadly dropsy of insatiable
avarice; for our conversation may be without Heb. 13. 5. 1. Tim. 6. 6.
covetousness, if we come to think godliness the greatest gain, and can be
content with such things as we have. And consequently, we shall walk honestly
in our callings, when being contented with our estate and condition, we will
use no indirect and unlawful means, nor fraudulent, violent, or unjust
courses, to enrich our selves with other men's goods. And go on in our duty
with much comfort and inward peace, when our heads are not vexed with carking
cares; nor our hearts affrighted with the terrors, nor gnawed on with the
worm of an evil conscience. But of this I have spoken largely in another
place. Fifthly, we must possess our souls Christian warfare 2. part. l. 2.
cap. 19.
with patience, if we will, as we ought, walk in the duties of our callings;
for besides that our labors in themselves are tedious and troublesome; we are
daily subject to many crosses and mis-carriages in them, which will discourage
us from going on; or if we do, being constrained by necessity, yet with much
coffeehouse and disquietnesse of mind, murmuring and repining, if we be not
armed with patience, and resolution to suffer with meekness, whatsoever God
shall be pleased to send. Sixthly, we must have our hearts replenished with
thankfulness unto God, and be ready at all times when we observe his love in
blessing our labors, to lift Genesis 32. 10.
them up, rendering unto him praise and thanksgiving. And acknowledging that we
are less then the least of Gods mercies, we must give him the whole glory of
them, and not sacrifice unto our own nets, nor attribute our well-proceeding
and good success to our own policy and skill, industry Hab. 1. 16.
and abilities, but knowing that whatsoever we have, we have received it from
God, we must take all occasions of rendering unto him the praise 1. Cor. 4. 7.
which is due unto him. Seventhly, we must perform the duties of our callings
with alacrity and cheerfulness, and whatsoever we do, we must do it
heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men, who will richly reward our
labors Col. 3. 23, 24.
with an heavenly inheritance. For as he loves a cheerful giver, so also a
cheerful labourer, in all things more respecting our inward affections then
our outward actions. And as it is acceptable to God; so will it be most
comfortable unto us, making all our labors easy; when our hearts and hands
are conjoined in doing them. Eighthly, we must observe Justice in all the
duties of our callings, doing nothing in them, but that which may advance our
neighbors good as well as our own. And this will make us avoid all unjust and
unlawful courses, which are commonly used to gather wealth; all fraud and
deceit, extortion and oppression; 1. These. 4. 6.
all unprofitable labors, which tend to the hurt, rather then the good of the
Commonwealth; and deceitful dealing, in those that are lawful. Finally, by
this Justice we shall be moved to give every man his due, and to do no man
wrong in the carriage of our callings; but so deal in them with others, as we
would have others in their callings to deal with us.

CAP. XIX.
Diverse reasons which may persuade us to be faithful and diligent in duties of
our callings.

. Sect. 1 That God has ordained man to labor; and has in many places of the
Scriptures strictly enjoined it.
NOw when we are thus qualified with these virtues and graces, the last thing
required in the duties of our callings, is, that we walk in them with all
painfulness and diligence, which because it is tedious to flesh and blood,
and men are naturally given to ease and liberty, desiring no calling at all,
or, if any be put upon them by necessity rather then choice, to walk in them
with as much sloth and negligence, as desire of their gain and advantage will
permit; and few of many that are painful, are diligent in their callings in
obedience unto God, or out of conscience of their duty, or any other religious
consideration; laboring no otherwise in them then Infidels and Pagans, only
for worldly benefit and earthly respects. Therefore it will be profitable to
propound some reasons out of the Scriptures, both to incite us to honest labor
in the works of our callings; and to make us avoid sloth and idleness. First
then let us consider, that God has ordained man as naturally to labor, as the
sparks to flee upwards, and Job 5. 7. Genesis 2. 15.
in the state of innocence would not endure that man should be idle, but made
his labor easy and comfortable, that he might labor with delight. And
therefore much less will he now suffer man unpunished to live at his ease,
seeing he has imposed it upon him as a penalty for his transgression, that in
the sweat of his face he should eat his bread; and has purposely Genesis 3. 19.
cursed the earth with barrenness without tilling and manuring; being content
that it should want its natural fruitfulness, rather then that man should
want necessary cause and occasion of labor. And though he would have his
Saints in heaven to keep unto him a perpetual Sabbath (not that they should
be idle, but wholly intent to his praises) yet prescribing a Law unto sinners
on earth, he appoints but one day for rest, and six for labor, to show unto
us, that in this world he will be served, not only with religious duties, but
in the greatest part of our time, by walking faithfully and conscionably before
him in the duties of our callings, expressing and exercising our inward graces
and religious virtues, in our vocations, and the outward duties required in
them. And this Law he has backed with many special commandments and
testimonies of holy Scripture, requiring at our hands that we should daily
exercise our selves in the duties of our callings. Thus Solomon sends the
sluggard to Pro. 6. 6.
learn of the silly Ant diligence and industry in his labors, that at least,
shame might drive him to the performance of his duty, when he sees himself a
reasonable man, who has so many motives to induce him, and ability to propound
so many good ends unto his pains, to be exceeded herein by a silly creature,
who has no other help nor inducement but the instinct of nature. So the
Apostle Paul requires of all men, that they 1. These. 4. 11.
study to be quiet, and to do their own business, and condemns them who
work not in their own callings, but busy themselves in other men's matters,
as inordinate persons, adiudging them to this punishment, that if they would
not work, neither should they eat; because they have no right unto it before
they have labored for it, but are thieves, who live by the sweat of other
men's brows, and like idle drones, unjustly devour the fruit of their labors.
And this the Apostle implies, where he first requires them to work with
quietness, and then to eat their own bread: for if earning it by our labors
make it our own, then it is not our own before we have earned it; neither
will free gift of friends or inheritance give just title unto it, unless we
strengthen it, by performing obedience to that first Law after the fall, In the
sweat of thy face thou shall eat thy bread. And therefore the Apostle seems
to make stealing and not laboring to be all one; Let him (says he) that
stole, steal no more, but rather let him labor, Ephesians. 4. 28.
working with his hands the thing that is good. Unto which precepts of holy
Scriptures, prescribing labor in the duties of our callings, we may add the
examples of all the Saints of God in all ages, as fit patterns for our
imitation; who have always lived in lawful callings, and have faithfully
labored in the duties of them, as of Abel and Noah before the flood, the one a
Shepherd, the other an Husbandman; and after the flood, of the Patriarchs,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all their posterity that descended of them; of
Moses, David, the Kings and Prophets; of the Disciples of our Savior Christ;
and especially of the Apostle Paul, who, as he professes, labored more
abundantly then they all, not only 1. Cor. 15. 10. 1. These. 2. 9. and 2.
These. 3. 7, 8, 9.
employing himself in his painful Ministry and Apostleship, but laboring
also with his hands, that he might not be offensive, but be a good example for
others to imitate. Yea, our Savior Christ himself, who though he were free
borne, and the only begotten and dearly beloved Son of his Father,
submitted himself as a servant to the common Law of mankind, tying himself
by a voluntary necessity to labor in his calling, and to do the works of him
that sent him. The which he did with John 9. 4.
such cheerfulness and delight, that he professes it to be his meat and
John 4. 34.
drink to do the will of him that sent him, and to finish his work. And
therefore if the Son and heir could not be free from labor, how should any
of his servants be exempted? If the Lord of the Vineyard could not be Matthew.
20. 6.
privileged from taking pains, with what face can any of the hired laborers
excuse their idleness?

. Sect. 2 That it is Gods ordinance that we should labor in our callings.
Again, let us consider that the Lord himself is the Author of our callings,
and that it is his ordinance that we should labor in them. It is he that
created, and redeemed, and continually preserves us, who has called and set
us in our places, and has appointed unto every one their work and task; and
has not only promised his help and assistance in all our labors, but also
has encouraged us to take pains, by assuring us, that he will richly reward
them when we have finished our work. And therefore, if after all this, we
will detract our labor, and spend our time in sloth and idleness, what is it
but to leave our standings, and to withdraw our selves from under his
government? to neglect Gods work, and to do service unto Satan, and the
sinful lusts of our own flesh? what is it but to deprive our souls of that
comfort which we might have in his company and assistance; and by pretending
difficulty in the atchieuing our labors, to argue and accuse him of
insufficiency, who has undertaken to assist us, and by his help to give good
success unto all our just endeavors? what is it, but for the inioying of short
and carnal ease to our flesh, to forfeit all hope of obtaining those rich,
heavenly, and everlasting rewards, which he has promised unto us, as the free
and gracious wages of our momentany labors?

. Sect. 3 That God blesses the diligent with many benefits.
Finally, let us consider the manifold benefits wherewith God has promised to
bless our labors, if we be painful and diligent in the duties of our
callings. And contrariwise, how much he abhors and condemns sloth and
idleness, punishing them that live in it, with innumerable evils which he has
justly caused to attend upon it. Concerning the former, it may be a strong
inducement to make us diligent in our callings, if we consider the benefits
which accrue upon it. For whereas every one is ready to ask, Who will show us
any good? and is easily drawn to any course by the Psalm. 4. 6.
golden chain of gain and advantage, the Wiseman tells us first generally,
that in all labor there is profit, whereas idle talking with the lips tends
Pro. 14. 23.
only to penury. And in many other places he sets forth more particularly
the manifold benefits that do accompany it. For it exalts to honor and
authority, according to that, The hand of the diligent shall bear Pro. 12. 24.
rule, but the slothful shall be under tribute. And again, See thou a man
diligent Pro. 22. 29.
in his business? he shall stand before Kings, he shall not stand before mean
men. It builds the house, and makes and erecteth mansion places for
themselves and their posterity. So says Solomon, Prepare thy work without,
Pro. 24. 27.
and make it fit for thy self in the field, and afterward build thy house.
Contrary to the practice of many in these times, who prefer building, and
neglect husbandry, and take care to set up fair houses, before they have any
land to lay unto them; building themselves quite out of doors, and like fools,
making houses for wise men to dwell in. It is crowned by the Lord with riches
and plenty; For he that tilleth the land, shall be satisfied with Pro. 12. 11.
and 28. 19. Pro. 10. 4. and 20. 13.
bread; and the hand of the diligent makes rich. And whereas that which
comes lightly, is as idly spent; that which is gotten by honest labor, is
preserved and multiplied; according to the saying of the Wiseman, Wealth gotten
by vanity, shall be diminished, but he that gathers by labor, Pro. 13. 11.
shall increase. It preserves the body in health, which languisheth with
idleness, makes the meat pleasant by quickening the appetite, and the sleep
sweet; whereas the idle turn upon the bed, as a door upon the Eccl. 5. 12.
Pro. 26. 14.
hindges, and not being able to rest, because they have not labored, toil
themselves with too much ease, and are tired with tumbling, even upon their
beds of down, being justly punished by God, with restless tossing and
sweating in the night, because they would take no pains to serve him in the
day. It affords comfortable and liberal means, not only for the maintenance
of our selves and those that belong unto us, but also whereby we may be
beneficial unto others that need our help, and exercise our charity in the
works of mercy, and in relieuing the poor members of Jesus Christ; which he
will richly reward and crown with glory and Mat. 25. 34, 35. 1. Tim. 6. 18,
19. Pro. 21. 25, 26.
happiness at the day of Judgment. For whereas the sluggard, whose hands
refuse to labor, gets nothing for himself to satisfy his desire, though
he coueteth greedily all the day long, the righteous that is diligent in the
works of his calling, has not only sufficient for his own use, but gives
liberally to others and spares not. And this end the Apostle propounds to
our pains in our honest callings, willing men to labor, Ephesians. 4. 28.
working with their hands the thing that is good, that they may have to give to
him that needs. Finally, if fearing God, we walk painefully in our
callings, we shall not only enjoy the fruit of our labors, but also be
blessed in this fruition; according to that of the Psalmist, Blessed Psalm. 128.

is every one that fears the Lord, and walks in his ways, for thou shall
eat the labor of thy hands, happy shall thou be, and it shall be well with
thee. And if God sees it fit that he should miss of this earthly happiness,
he will abundantly recompense it with everlasting blessedness in the life to
come.

. Sect. 4 That the Lord abhors idleness and negligence, and severely
punishes it.
Contrariwise, the Lord abhors idleness and negligence in our callings,
esteeming them that are slothful, more brutish and without understanding, then
the dumb and brute creatures, and therefore sends them to their School to be
instructed by them. Pro. 6. 6.
Go to the Ant, thou sluggard, consider her ways and be wise. And therefore it
is condemned in the Pro. 26. 13, 14, 15.
Scriptures; Matthew. 20. 6.
reproved in the Parable; Why stand ye here idle? Forbidden in all our
affairs, Romans 12. 11.
Be not slothful in business; Matched and rancked with wasting our own
goods, and stealing from other men; for he that is slothful in his work, is
the brother of him that is a great waster; and the Apostle implies Pro. 18 9.
by that Antithesis, Let him that stole, steal no more, but let him labor
with his Ephesians. 4. 28.
hands; that an idle person is no better then a thief. For he robs the
poor of their right, who depriueth them by his sloth of that relief, which he
might yield unto them out of his honest labor. And finally, to be wicked and
slothful, are words of like signification, and fit to describe a person
desperately naught and designed to destruction. Whereof it is that our Savior
joins them together in the Parable of the talents; Thou Matthew. 25. 26.
wicked and slothful servant, etc. But how much God hates idleness and
negligence in the duties of our callings; it will better appear, if we
consider the manifold evils which he causes to accompany and attend upon it.

. Sect. 5 That idleness is the cause of innumerable sins.
The which are of two sorts, both the evils of sin, and the evils of
punishment, of both which it is the cause, producing the one, and by due desert
drawing upon us the other. For the first; idleness is a mother sin, and (as
we usually say) the root of all evil; for when the devil finds us not
employed in Gods service, he entertaineth us into his, and setting before us
the objects and baits of worldly vanities, he offers to give them unto us as
the wages of iniquity, if we will serve him in those sinful lusts and works
of darkness wherein he will use us. When he sees us like grounds untilled
and unmanured, and therefore unfit to receive the seeds of Gods graces, he
sows in us the weeds of all vice and sin, besides all those which grow up
in our hearts naturally, and of their own accord, being grounds which in
themselves are too too fertile, to breed and bring forth all fruits of
impiety. More especially, idleness and neglect of our callings is a notable
cause of heresies, sects, and schisms. For when men want employment in their
own affairs, they grow curious and inquisitiue after other matters; propound
many vain questions and needless doubts, tending more to contention, then the
use of edifying, which when they have resolved, according to their own humor
and fantasy, they go (having nothing else to do) from house to house to
possess others with their conceits, and when they have privately trained up
many in their opinions, at last they make a general muster, and become heads
and captains of that faction, which themselves have raised; disturbing the
peace of the Church, by renting themselves from it, and making war against
the truth; as the miserable experience of these times does too evidently show.
Neither does it alone make men busy and curious in matters of Religion, but
also in civil affairs; for when men grow negligent in their own business,
they have leisure to intermeddle with other men's, and having nothing to do at
home, they range abroad; carrying tales from house to house, and sowing the
seeds of discord and dissension among neighbors. Of such idle busy bodies,
the Apostle complained in his time, who walked 2. These. 3. 11, 12.
disorderly, and worked not at all, but busied themselves in other men's
matters, and disquieted all whom they came among. And such were those young idle
widows, who wandered about from house to house, and by being 1. Tim. 5. 12, 13.
idle, became tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought
not. And as it is a cause of schism in the Church, and dissension in families,
so also of sedition and rebellion in the Commonwealth, whilst it makes men
inquisitiue after news, and to pry curiously into matters of state; busy in
censuring those that are in authority, and so filling both their own and other
men's minds with discontents, they become seditious, and upon all occasions
ready to rise and rebel, for want of other employment; and the rather, that by
fishing in troubled waters, they may supply those wants and necessities which
negligence in their callings has brought upon them, therefore betaking
themselves to Arms, because poverty Pro. 6. 11.
and want (like an armed man) has first assaulted them. And this was the
reason why Pharaoh, fearing that the Israelites would rise and withdraw their
necks from under the iron yoke of his tyrannical government, probably,
though falsely, coniectured that want of work was the cause, out of that
general maxim and principle in policy, that idleness makes men seditious
and rebellious; whereas employment in their callings so takes up their minds,
that they have no leisure to think of things impertinent to their private
estate and affairs. It is the cause also of covetousness, and all the evils
that do spring from it, as wrong and oppression in the mighty, fraud and
deceitful dealing in the weak, yea even of theft, robbery, and piracie; for
when men through idleness and negligence in their callings, become poor and
have nothing of their own, they greedily desire other men's goods to supply
their wants, and Pro. 28. 19.
use all unlawful means whereby they may compass them. Which caused the wise
Agur to pray against penury and want of necessaries, lest being poor Pro. 30.
8, 9.
he should steal, and so take the name of his God in vain. And this made the
Apostle inhibiting stealing, to inioyne labor, as being the best means to
Ephesians. 4. 28.
keep men from this sin. It is the cause likewise of gluttony and
drunkenness, if want keep not from this excess, and emptiness of the purse
prevent not this too much fullness of the belly. Whereof it is, that in the
Scriptures they are joined as companions and mutual causes one of another. So
it is said, that the sins of Sodom were pride, fullness of bread, Ezech. 16.
49.
and abundance of idleness; and that the Israelites sat down to eat and
drink, Exodus 32. 6.
and rose up to play. For when men's minds are not employed about their
callings, they are set upon their bellies, not only to please their appetite,
but also to take away the tediousness of time, which is caused by idleness.
Which I am persuaded is the chief cause of the excessive and hurtful use of
Tobacco in these days; for because men's heads are idle and empty of business,
they fill them with smoke; and for want of better employment, they betake
themselves to this vain exercise; making hereby their idle time less tedious,
and taking away melancholy, the usual companion of sloth, by intoxicating
their brains, and stupifying their senses, so as they become less
apprehensiue of their misspent time, and the manifold evils which accompany
their idleness; till by much use and custom they grow to such an habit, that
they now use it not only for delight, but also for necessity, having no power
to forbear and weane themselves from it. Of which I am the rather persuaded,
because I see it most used amongst those who are most idle, as inordinate youth
and loose gallants, and by those who are otherwise industrious and laborious,
when they intermit the works of their callings, and upon any occasion are at
leisure from their employments. Finally, idleness is the cause of whoredom
and all unclean lusts, not only as it is a special means to pamper the
flesh, and so to enable and provoke it to these works of darkness, but also
because it gives leisure and liberty to the heart and eyes, to wander and roue
after wanton and lascivious objects, as the lamentable example of holy David,
2. Sam. 11. 2.
and of innumerable others since his time, and even in our own days, have too
manifestly proved.

. Sect. 6 That idleness makes us liable to many punishments.
Secondly, as idleness and negligence in our callings produces these manifold
evils of sin; so is it no less fruitful in bringing forth the evils of
punishment, both in this life and in the life to come. For first, as it is the
root of all sin, so by consequence it generally brings with it all
punishments that these sins deserve, of which it is the cause and root,
seeing they are but the after-fruits of the same tree. Besides which, it may be
truly and properly said to be the cause of diverse special punishments. As
first, of poverty and penury of all Gods blessings, through neglect of the
works of our callings, which are the ordinary means ordained by him, whereby
he deriueth unto us his gifts and benefits. And this Solomon often affirms,
and much beats upon in many places: He becomes poor, that deals with a
slack hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich. The Pro. 10. 4. Pro. 13.
4.
soul of the sluggard desires and has nothing, but the soul of the diligent
shall be made fat. The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore
shall he Pro. 20. 4, 13. and 6. 11. and 24. 30, 34.
beg in harvest and have nothing. Love not sleep, lest thou come unto poverty,
open thine eyes, and thou shall be satisfied with bread. Yea it is punished,
not only with want of riches, but also of necessaries, and with pinching
hunger the worst of all corporal evils; For slothfulness casts into a deep
Pro. 19. 15.
sleep, and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. For as they have no store of
their own, but want in others greatest plenty, and beg through extreme
penury, even in the time of harvest; so do they deserve by their
slothfulness to be neglected of others, and harden the hearts of those who are
able and willing to give, so as they think it no Almes-deed to relieve them
out of their store; for they that will not work, are not worthy to eat;
seeing they are unprofitable burdens of the Common wealth, the blemish of a
well governed 2. These. 3. 10.
Church, and idle Drones, who devour the fruit of other men's labors. Or if
men seeing their want and misery, give charitably to their necessity, though
they respect not their person, yet it is punished with servitude and base
subjection. For through penury they are constrained to live upon begging and
borrowing, and as the Wiseman observed, The rich rules Pro. 22. 7.
over the poor, and the borrower is a servant to the lender; and again, The
hand of Pro. 12. 24.
the diligent shall bear rule, but the slothful shall be under tribute.
Finally, in the life to come it is punished with everlasting death; for not
only the wasting and riotous servant, which mis-spendeth and consumes his
Lords talents, but also the idle and unprofitable servant, which does not
increase them by his honest labor, shall be cast into outer darkness, where
shall be weeping, Mat. 25. 26, 30.
and gnashing of teeth.

CAP. XX.
That all persons without exceptions, are bound by Gods Law to walk painefully
in the works of their callings.

. Sect. 1 That the former reasons bind all men to painfulnesse in their
callings.
ANd these are the reasons which may move us to be paineful in our callings,
and preserve us from idleness. But a question may be made whom it concerns
to be thus daily employed, seeing common practice of the world does plainly
proclaim, that they think, all are not tied by these reasons to spend their
time in pains and labor; and that many may live without any calling at all,
or having one, may only labor so much as they need, or will stand with their
credit and place. As though there were no other bonds to tie them unto any
pains, but necessity among the poorer sort, increase of riches among those who
desire to increase their wealth to an higher pitch, and honor and authority
among those who are in place of government. As for the rich that are contented
with their wealth, and Gentlemen who live upon their lands and great revenues,
and desire not to have the honor with the burden of government, they need
not to employ themselves in any calling, but may spend their time in all ease
and pleasure, in hunting, and hawking, in gaming, and reuelling; with which
conceit they are so possessed, that they hold it some disparagement to be
otherwise exercised, or to take any pains in any lawful calling. For
answering whereof, we are to know, that these reasons concern all men of all
estates and conditions, rich and poor, noble and base, so long as they are
able to take pains, and are not made unfit by age and impotency, sickness and
such other infirmities. For the Law imposed upon Adam, binds also all his
posterity, that in the sweat of their face they should eat their bread. By
which borrowed speech, from the practice of those who labor with their hands,
is meant that all, of all estates and conditions, should serve God with pains
and diligence, according to the nature of that calling which they have taken
upon them; as Magistrates in their government, Ministers in their studies,
preaching, and other Ministerial functions; the Artificer and Craftsman in his
Science and Trade; the Husbandman in the works of Husbandry. And it is
indefinitely said in Job, that man is borne unto labor, as the sparks Job 5.
7.
fly upward, so that he who would have pasport to lead an idle life, must
forgo the privilege of being a man. Yea, not only men, but women also are
tied to this task of daily labor in their callings; neither may they eat the
bread of idleness, as the Wiseman speaks, but must take 1. Tim. 5. 14. Pro.
31. 27.
pains, according to their place and state, either in working with their
hands, if they be poor, or by governing their families, and with the good
huswife in the Proverbs, looking well to the ways of their household, or some
other honest employment which may keep them from idleness, fit them for a
charge, and make them more helpefull unto others, and in some kind or other,
profitable members of the Common wealth. For if they consume their time in
sloth and idleness, and according to the common custom of many in the world,
spend all the rest of the morning which they can spare from sleep, in curious
adorning of their bodies, in frizling and curling the hair, painting the face,
with such like vanities; and the afternoon in vain talking and courting, idle
visitations, carding, playing, and sporting themselves in such carnal
delights; they (for ought I know to the contrary) shall as well as men bring
upon themselves all the former evils of sin and punishment.

. Sect. 2 That Gentlemen have no privilege of idleness, and how they should
spend their time.
As for Gentlemen and those that have attained unto lands and riches, whereby
they are able to maintain themselves and their charge; though they are not, in
respect that God has thus advanced them above others, to perform servile
works, which were too much baseness, nor to ouertoyle themselves in bodily
labor, which were needless and unprofitable for the Common wealth, by taking
from the poor their work, and with it their wages and means of maintenance;
yet they are not exempted from such labors and employments, as beseem their
place and state. Yea, in all reason, because God has been so gracious unto
them above others, that he has advanced them to more honorable callings,
wherein they may exercise themselves in employments of a more excellent nature,
and greater worth with greater ease; and has richly rewarded them beforehand
with such extraordinary pay and bountiful wages, above the rest of their
fellows, whose labors are more base and toylesome, less honorable and
important; therefore of all others, they should be least idle in this fair,
easy, and honorable service, and exceed all others in diligence, as far as
they exceed them in these many and rich privileges. And hereof it is that
Sodom was so much condemned and fearfully punished; because abounding in all
wealth and plenty, they exceeded also in sloth, abusing the blessing of riches
and prosperity, to pride, fullness of bread, and Ezech. 16. 49.
abundance of idleness. Besides then those religious duties, of praying,
hearing the Word, reading, meditating, and such like, in which it becomes
Gentlemen and rich men to be most diligent, as having more leisure and better
opportunity to perform these exercises, then the poorer sort: there are also
many civil duties, in which their time and pains may be profitably employed;
As first and chiefly, the duties of Magistracy, if they be furnished with fit
gifts for it by God, and called thereunto by superior authority; wherein they
are chiefly to aim at Gods glory, and the good of the Church and Common
wealth, by preserving Justice, truth, and peace, the beating down of all vice
and sin, and the advancing of virtue and godliness in them. And not the
pleasing of their own humors, the pleasuring of their friends, and the
filling of their purses with gifts and bribes. But if they be not fit for these
employments, or not called thereunto, then may they profitably be exercised in
governing their own families, appointing their servants to their work,
ouerseeing their labors, and taking account of what they have done; in
husbanding and managing their estates, that they may, as much as in them lies,
preserve it entire, and leave it to their posterity. And what time they can
spare from these employments, they may profitably spend; either, if they be of
a martial disposition, in feats of Arms, riding of great Horses, and such
like exercises, whereby they may be fitted for the service and defense of
their Country. Or if they be naturally inclined to contemplation, and a quiet
and peaceable life, they may apply themselves to the study of Law, Physic, or
Divinity, that they may not only be able to direct themselves in all things
that concern their estates, bodies, and souls, but also may be helpeful unto
their neighbors about them, by directing them in their courses, and resolving
them in all their doubts, when as they resort unto them to ask their counsel.
Unto which studies, if our Gentility were inclined, I see no reason why they
might not be (like that worthy and renowned P. Mornay du Plessis of France,
famous in all Countries for his valor and learning) the greatest Scholars in
the Common wealth, next unto them that reside in the Universities; seeing they
have most leisure and opportunity to follow their studies; and best purses to
furnish their Libraries. Or if they have not been brought up to learning, they
may employ their time profitably in according differences, and ending
controversies between their neighbors; in using all good means both by word
and example, to discountenance sin, and advance virtue; in doing the works
of mercy, as ouerseeing the poor, and taking order for their provision,
relieuing the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick; to which duties
God has enabled them above others, by making them stewards in his family, and
committing a greater portion to their ordring and disposing. And if Gentlemen
would thus spend their time, they should be truly noble in the eyes of God and
men, and reap more true and lasting honor in their Country, by this their
Christian conversation, then the antiquity of their house, their ancient and
ennobled pedigree, their coats of Arms and Ensigns of Gentilitie, their
gilded Coaches and gay apparel can yield unto them. Yea, which is above all,
they should by these courses have the inward peace of a good conscience, and
inioying Mat. 25. 20, 21.
their earthly privileges as pledges of Gods love, and earnest-pennies of
their salvation, their hearts would not be set upon these, but upon the main
bargain of heavenly happiness assured by them; and would be content with all
cheerefulnes to leave them, and to lay down their talents at Gods feet, when
as he shall call them to enter into the joy of their Lord.

. Sect. 3 That the poorer sort must labor painfully in their callings,
notwithstanding that the badnesse of their trades afford small earnings.
Now if the rich and noble are not privileged from diligent walking in their
callings, then much less can any of the poorer sort, who are able to take
pains, think themselves exempted, seeing they are tied to the performance of
their duty, not only by the same golden bond of conscience, but also by the
iron chain of necessity, that they may have wherewithal to relieve and
sustain themselves and those that belong unto them; which if they be not
strong enough to tie them to their duty, but that they will live like idle
loyterers, and not labor for their living; it is fit, that unto these two,
there be added a third, which is the bond of authority, whereby they should be
compelled to take pains, and not live as idle and unprofitable Drones in the
Common wealth. And if this treble bond will not hold them, then are they as
inordinate livers (according to the Apostles rule) to be cast out of all civil
society, and not suffered to eat, 2. These. 3. 6, 10.
because they will not work; or else to feed upon the bread of affliction and
the water of sorrow, because they will not eat the bread of their honest
labor, nor earne their living in the sweat of their face. Neither does any
law bind us to relieve such as will be subject to no law, nor to pity their
wants who will take no pity on themselves. But what if being poor, they
cannot maintain themselves and their charge, either because it is so great, or
the gain so small that comes of their labors? and what if their trade be so
hard, and pains in it prized at such low rates, that there is no competencie
in their earnings to minister unto them and theirs necessary relief? In this
case the poor are ready to say, that it is as good to sit still, as to rise
and fall; and that they had as liefe play for nothing, as work for nothing.
But it is far otherwise; for howsoever if the case truly stands thus (for
it is not always so when it is pretended; and oftentimes the trade is blamed,
when the fault is in the negligence and sloth of them that loyter in it, as
hereby it appears, in that many others of the same trade, by their laborious
diligence, do with their earnings comfortably maintain themselves and their
families) yet (as I say) if it be truth which they speak, howsoever they may
in this case (if they can) change their calling for a better, which will
afford them more sufficient means and maintenance, for the labourer is worthy
of his hire, and by Gods Law, if we be liberal in spending our sweat, we
should not be scanted in eating our bread; yet so long as they hold their
calling (as they ought to hold it till they can change for a better) they must
not surcease and give over their labor in it. To which end let them consider,
that they do not only thereby serve cruel man, who being straight in his
bowels, will not suffer them to get their living by their labor, nor allow
them food to recover that strength which they have spent in his service; but
that in all their works and laborious pains, they serve as their chief Lord,
the bountiful King of heaven and earth, which will richly reward their
diligence, if it be done in obedience to his Commandment, and supply
abundantly whatsoever is defective and wanting on the behalf of their earthly
master. The which, if he does not to their full content in this life, but, to
humble them and weane them from the world, does feed them with a sparing hand,
yet if they will perform their duty, and possess their souls with patience,
what is wanting in full payment here, he will double and redouble, yea
infinitely multiply, by crowning their pains and patience with unspeakable
joy and endless glory, in the life to come. Yea if they will, making
conscience of their duty, cast themselves into the arms of Gods providence, he
will assuredly provide for them, according to that of the Psalmist, Trust in
the Lord and do good, so shall Psalm. 37. 3. 5. Pro. 26. 3. 1. Pet. 5. 7.
thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shall be fed. And either he will allow
them more liberal maintenance, by pouring out a larger blessing upon their
labors, or by opening the hearts of those who are rich, to contribute to their
necessities; or else, seeing man lives not by bread only, but by every Mat.
4. 4.
word that proceeds out of Gods mouth, he will give such an extraordinary
blessing upon their little poor pittance, that like unto the widows handful
of meal and cruize of oil, and Daniels pulse and water, it shall be as
sufficient to preserve their health and strength, as the dainty fare and full
tables of the rich. In the mean time, they whom God has blessed with
sufficient plenty, are to be persuaded, to let the chief streams of their
bounty and Christian beneficence run into these dry and thirsty lands, and to
take special care, that above all other poor, these who are painful in
their callings, and yet not able thereby to sustain themselves and their
families, may be relieved and comforted. For of seed so seasonably sown in
such choice grounds, they may assuredly expect an heavenly harvest, and
plentiful crop of joy and happiness. Whereas if they shut up the bowels of
their compassion, and will not communicate some little part of those many rich
talents which God has entrusted to their disposing, for the glory of their
Master, and good of their fellow-seruants, but let them or theirs famish and
starve for want of relief; their riches and they will perish together, and
that little pittance of portion which they hold in their hands, and of right
belongs to the poor, shall bring them in the end no more comfort then Achans
wedge of gold, or Dives riches, when he was in hell torments. For in this life
it shall canker and corrupt Jam. 5. 1, 3.
the rest of their treasure, and the rust of it in the day of Judgment
witnessing against them, shall cause them to hear that fearful and dreadful
sentence, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
Mat. 25. 41.
devil and his angels; For I was hungered, and ye gave me no meat, I was
thirsty, and ye gave me no drink, etc. In which respect, I should ten
thousand times rather choose to perish for hunger; then abounding in their
wealth, to let others perish for want of charity; and with Lazarus, to die at
the rich man's gate; then with Dives, to sit gorgeously apparelled at a full
table.

. Sect. 4 That the impotent are not bound to labor, but may with good
conscience take their case.
Now concerning those who are impotent and cannot work, being disabled by age,
sickness, lamenesse, or other infirmities, they are not by the former reasons
bound to labor in their callings, because God himself has exempted them from
the common rule and law, and has left their consciences free from guilt of
sin, in the omitting of those duties, unto the performing whereof he himself
has disabled them. And therefore if they be rich, they may live at ease, and
enjoy thankfully their portion, as the gift and blessing of God. Or if they be
poor, they may with good conscience live upon those charitable beneuolences
which others shall be pleased to bestow upon them; praising God for raising up
such good instruments to serve his providence for their relief and
maintenance; and praying unto him daily for their benefactours. Yea, in this
case men are bound in conscience to lay open their wants, if others take no
notice of them, and to crave and receive their help and assistance; which if
out of an high stomach in a low estate, or out of a proud modesty and
bashfulnesse, they neglect to do, and so perish for want of relief, they are
injurious to their able and willing neighbors, in refusing to be subjects of
their charity; and so hindering them of that heavenly harvest which they should
reap of it; and guilty also of their own death, in not using those lawful
means whereby their lives should be preserved. And of these also the rich are
bound to take care, that according to order and Law in this case provided,
nothing which is necessary be wanting unto them; for God has lent them their
wealth to this end, that what they can spare from their own necessary
expenses, they should cheerfully bestow for the relief of others; which if
they neglect to do, they shall have a fearful reckoning to make at the day
of Judgment. But of this I have largely written in a Treatise of this
Argument, and therefore here pass Treatise of Alms, or the Plea of the poor.
it over.

CAP. XXI.
Of Recreations, which are not only lawful, but also profitable and
necessary, if we be exercised in them according to Gods Word.

. Sect. 1 That we cannot continually be exercised in the works of our callings.
THe chief end for which God has created, redeemed, and does preserve and
sustain us, is, that we should serve him, and the principal means whereby he
is worshipped and served, are the general and religious duties of
Christianity, and the special duties of our callings. In which regard, it were
much to be desired that we could spend our whole times in the performance of
them, and esteem it our meat and drink to do the will of our heavenly
Father, and our chief delight, to exercise our selves continually Ioh. 4. 34.
in these duties. But because this is impossible, in regard of humane frailty
and weakness, therefore has God graciously permitted, yea enjoined unto us
some time of intermission and cessation from these labors, wherein we may
refresh our selves, and repair our decayed strength, exhausted and spent in
these Christian exercises, that so we may be the better enabled and fitted to
return unto them again with renewed vigor, reassume our task, and perform
our duties in them with more ability and dexterity. And these are the times
which are allotted to recreation, taking of our repast by eating and drinking,
and composing our bodies to rest and sleep. For that we cannot always labor
in the duties of Christianity and of our callings, nature it self teaches us,
and the experience of our weakness, which makes us to sink under this
burden, if we never lay it aside; and the example of our Savior Christ
himself, who though in his divine nature he were omnipotent and needed not to
rest, yet as he was man, who had taken upon him, not only our nature, but our
infirmities Heb. 4. 15.
also, after his painful labors, he needed, being weary, to rest, and being
hungry, to refresh himself and repair his strength. And therefore after his
journey, being weary and hungry, he rested himself at Jacobs well, Ioh. 4. 6,
8.
whilst he sent his Disciples into the City to buy him meat. And in another
place being tired with the coming and going of the multitude whom he taught,
so as he had no leisure so much as to eat, he commands his Disciples to
accompany him, and to go apart into a desert place, Mark. 6. 31.
that there they might rest a while and take their repast. Which whosoever neglect,
and think that they can spend their whole time in labor, they foolishly tempt
God, in refusing his ordinance, and the means which he has appointed to
repair their strength, and preserve their health; they proudly presume on
their own power, as though they were better able to do the duties which God
has enjoined then Christ himself; and are no better then selfe-murtherers,
bringing themselves unto an untimely death, because they refuse to use the
means which God has ordained and sanctified for the sustaining of their lives.

. Sect. 2 What lawful recreation is; and that it may be used with a good
conscience.
Seeing then it is not only allowed as lawful, but commended as necessary and
profitable, that ordinarily we should spend some part of the day in vacancy
from labor, and remission of the works of our callings, therein taking our
recreation, diet and repast, rest and sleep, that we may more cheerfully
return to our labors, and more ably perform them, when as our bodies and
minds are refreshed by this intermission; we will in the next place speak of
them severally, and show how we may lawfully so use them, as that they may be
helps and not hindrances to the well-performing of all Christian duties. And
first we will speak of recreation; which is an intermission of our labors,
and spending of convenient time in some delightful exercise, for the
refreshing of our minds and bodies, that their vigor and strength being
repaired, we may more cheerfully return to our callings, and perform the
duties of them with more ability. Which that we may use without scruple of
conscience, (which would make it, though lawful in it self, unlawful unto
us, because whatsoever is not done of faith, is sin;) let us know, that
honest recreation Romans 14. 23.
is a thing not only lawful, but also profitable and necessary. The
lawfulness of it hence appears, in that it is according to Gods will, which
he has manifested, both by his works, in that he has made man so finite in
his powers and abilities both of body and mind, that he cannot hold out in
continual labor, nor long subsist in well-being, in health, and strength,
unless he be refreshed with seasonable recreation; and also by his Word. For
the same Law which inioyneth painful and profitable labor in our callings,
requires honest recreations as a special means which inableth us unto it,
seeing in every Commandment wherein a duty is imposed, all the helps and
furtherances which enable us to do it, are also enjoined. And though God has
appointed this world to be a place of pilgrimage and warfare, and not a
Paradise of pleasure, and Chariot of triumph, reserving that for his own
Kingdom, when having finished our journey, and obtained victory, we shall rest
from all our labors, and be complete in all joy and happiness; in which
regard it becomes us not here to spend most of our time in sports and
pastimes, but rather in painful travail and sore conflicts with our
spiritual enemies; yet because we could not hold out in our pilgrimage and
warfare without some refreshing, he has graciously allowed us some time (as it
were) to lie in our Inn and Garrison, to take our pleasure and delight, that
being refreshed, we may more lustily proceed in our journey, and more
courageously renew our warfare and fight; and to this end has fitted his
creatures, both for the use of necessity, and also comfort and delight; and not
only allows man bread and water to sustain him in life; but as the Psalmist
observed, wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make him look
with a cheerful countenance. Psalm. 104. 15.


. Sect. 3 That recreations are profitable and necessary.
Neither is recreation only allowed as lawful, but also enjoined as
profitable and necessary. It is profitable, because it inableth us to hold out
in our labors, and to perform all good duties with more vigor, and in much
greater perfection. For as the strings of a Lute let down and remitted, do
sound sweeter when they are raised again to their full pitch; and as our
fields, being every year sowed, become at length more barren in bearing, but
being sometime laid fallow, repay the Husbandmans patience and forbearance with
double increase: so our bodies and minds, if Intermissio vt aruis sic ingenijs
prodest.
they have no remission from our labors, will make but dull music; if we do
not sometimes let them lie fallow, and give them a Summer-tilth of seasonable
recreation, they will remit much of their vigor, and become quickly more
barren, to bring forth any good fruits; whereas by timely remission, they will
afterward make more harmonious melody, and double their fruitfulness, if,
languishing with labor, we refresh them, and repair their strength with some
pleasant intermission. And as recreation in these respects is very profitable,
so also is it no less necessary: for if (like bows) we should always stand
upon our bent; we would in a while prove stark slugges; and if (like Lute
strings) we should always have our strength stretched to the highest pitch;
it would not only be deadded and dull, but still in danger to crack and
fail. We are not made of God fit instruments for perpetual motion, but rest
is to hold interchangeable course with it. The which is to be understood, not
only of our bodies, but also of our minds; for both of them have but a finite
virtue, and their powers and faculties proportioned unto finite actions and
operations: and therefore as they cannot do things above their strength, so
neither can they continue in doing beyond their time; or if they do, they are
soon wearied and spent, and forced to leave their labor upon the necessity of
impotency, which we would not intermit upon the choice of discretion. But
chiefly this falls out in the studies and labors of our minds, when as they
are exercised about intellectual objects, and intentiuely bent upon discourses
of reason. For sensible things are con-naturall and familiar unto us, and
therefore being exercised about them, we do it with ease and delight, as being
(like the fish in the water, and the bird in the air) in our own proper
element; but when they are employed about things only intellectual,
especially in divine contemplations which are most contrary to corrupted
nature, and are elevated above their pitch, and wholly abstracted from all
things sensible, as in divine studies, prayer, and heavenly meditations; then
they cannot (like men in the element of water) support themselves without much
intention and labor. In which regard, as the body needs rest, both when it
is wearied by greatness of labor, or long continuance in that which is more
easy, in the proper objects of its own actions; and also after serious
studies and contemplations of the mind, seeing it works not alone, but
exercises its faculties by the body, and the chief parts of it, as organs and
instruments: so likewise the mind and soul it self, after it is wearied with
labors and studies, needs refreshing, not like the body by rest, but by
delighting it self with change of objects and operations, leaving those which
being serious, high, and difficult, need much intention and study, that we may
conceive and comprehend them; for those which being easy, familiar, and
delightful to the senses, recreate also the mind, and bring unto it much ease
and pleasure. And if it want these seasonable recreations, the powers and
faculties of it will be soon blunted and dulled, and made utterly unfit for
intellectual studies and divine contemplations. To which purpose there is a
Story of the Apostle and Evangelist John, recorded in the collations of the
Fathers, and cited by Aquinas; who when one found him recreating and sporting
Aquin. secunda secundae quaest. 168. art. 2.
himself with his disciples, and was offended at it, as a thing misbeseeming
his Apostle-like gravity; enjoined one in the company, to put his arrow into
his bow and draw it to the head; which when he had done often, he willed him to
continue drawing it still; unto which when he answered, that if he should so
do, his bow would either be broken or become sluggish; the Apostle inferred,
that so likewise the mind of man would be broken, or grow dull and blockish,
if it should always stand upon the bent, and never be remitted from the
earnest intension of serious studies.

. Sect. 4 That we must make choice of such recreations as are lawful, and
which they are.
And thus it appears that recreations are not only lawful, but also
profitable and necessary. Now because many are apt to abuse this liberty unto
licenciousnesse, and to rush upon all sports and pleasures without choice or
difference, or if they pitch upon those which are allowable in themselves, care
not how shamefully they abuse them, in respect of their il carriage in the
manner of using them: We are in the next place to know, that recreations are
not absolutely good, but of an indifferent nature; good to those that use them
well, and evil to those who abuse them unto sin; not simply good being
considered apart by themselves, but as they in their use tend to the advancing
of those ends for which they are used. Finally, not good at all unto us, if we
rush upon them rashly and hand over head without choice, and have neither care
nor conscience in our manner of using them; but when we observe diligently
those laws and cautions, wherewith we are limited and bounded in their use by
the Word. And these either respect the matter or manner; the recreation it
self, or our course and carriage in exercising our selves in it. For the
recreation it self, our first care must be that it be lawful, and either
approved and warranted, or at least, not forbidden and condemned in the
Scriptures. And here we are to observe not only those recreations which are
particularly named, but likewise all those which have some analogy and
similitude with them. And these are either of the mind alone, or of the body
and mind jointly together. The recreations of the mind, as the propounding of
Riddles, and resolving of them, for the exercise of wit, of which we have an
example in Samson, propounding unto the Philistines at his marriage feast this
Riddle, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out Judge. 14. 12, 13.
of the strong came forth sweetness, etc. Wherein we are to observe, that
both the words and meaning be modest and chaste, and not like many Riddles,
propounded in obscene words, which men think excused by their modest
resolution. So also the contemplation of Gods works, flowers, and plants,
birds, fishes and beasts, that out of their beauty and excellent properties and
qualities, we may take occasion to see and admire the infinite wisdom and
power of their Creator, without which, the bare sight of the creatures, and
delight that arises out of them is vain and fruitless, in respect that it
fails of one principal end, and will (as experience shows) rather distract
us from our callings, then fit us for them. And this seems to have been one
of Salomons recreations in his best times, who out of this exercise of
contemplation, was able to speak of all trees, from the Cedar that was in
Lebanon, even to the hyssope that 1. King. 4. 33.
sprung out of the will, and also of beasts and fowls, creeping things, and
fishes. Unto which we may add the delighting of our minds one with another,
with pleasant discourses and witty conceits, and by our selves by using the
excellent Art of Poetry, either making Poems our selves, or reading those which
are composed by others. In all which, and the like exercises of the mind, our
care must be that our recreations, neither in respect of words, matter, or
manner, be wanton or wicked, insulse or corrupt, and neither bitter and biting,
tending to the disgrace of others, nor profane and filthy, tending to the
poisoning of our hearts and affections, or to the corrupting of our manners and
conditions; neither to the impeaching and loss of Christian gravity, nor to
the hindering of that harmony and Caueamu^ ne dum relaxare animum volumu^,
soluamus omnem harmoniam quasi concentu^ quendam bonorum operu^. Ambr. de
offic. cap. 20.
seemly decency which ought to be observed in all our conversation. The
recreations of the mind and body jointly together are many, as the exercise of
the senses, especially the eyes with delightful sights, and the ears with
harmonious music, which above all other recreations is commended in the
Scriptures, and by the example of the Saints, who not only used it in Gods
worship, to cheer and fit the heart the better for holy duties, but also for
civil recreation, that they might thereby be the better enabled for the duties
of their callings. And thus the Prophet in almost innumerable places, stirs
up both himself and others, with voice and musical instruments to praise the
Lord; and having penned the Psalms for his own use and the benefit of the
Church, appoints them to be sung by the most skillful Musicians to diverse
instruments. Whose steps Solomon his Eccl. 2. 8.
son herein followed, and appointed most exquisite music, not only to be
used in the Temple in Gods service, but also in his own house for his
recreation and delight. The which continued in the Church, even in the time of
their captivity; for howsoever they refused to gratify the Ps. 137. 1, 2, 3.
proud and scornful heathens, by making them music in their misery, yet
they continued this recreation for the solacing of themselves, as hereby
appears, in that at their return out of Babylon to their own Country, they
had amongst them two hundred, forty and five singing men and Nehem. 7. 67.
singing women. And unto these we may add hunting, hawking, fishing, fowling;
feats of actiuity, running, leaping, wrestling, fencing, with all lawful
sports and games; amongst which that laudable exercise of shooting chiefly
excels, as being not only a manly exercise, most fit to preserve 2. Sam. 1.
18.
the health and strength of the body, and delightful to the mind, in respect
of that Art and skill which may be showed in it; but also a good defense, both
privately for our selves, and publicly for our Country, if it were rightly
used as in ancient times.

. Sect. 5 Whether it be lawful to play at games which stand upon hazard and
chance.
Contrariwise our care must be, that we avoid such recreations as are
unlawful, which howsoever for the time they may be pleasing unto the flesh,
yet leaving behind them the sting of sin, they will, like the play of Ioab
and Abners soldiers, be bitter in the end, and not bring unto the mind any
lasting delight, but at the best, mournful repentance and afflicting grief.
And such are all those sports as are so vain and light, that they will not
beseem Christian gravity; all those which tend to break peace, and weaken
love, as bitter or scurrilous jesting, and rude horse-play; all lascivious and
effeminate sports which corrupt the mind, or weaken the body, inflame the
lust, or poison the manners, as vain dalliance, and courting of women,
chambring and wantonness, profane stage plays and Enterludes, which make the
Theater a School of all impiety and profaneness, lust and uncleanness, and
wanton dancing of both sexes one with another; especially in those light and
lewd Lauoltoes and Corrantoes used in these times, which are so full of
lascivious and immodest gestures and actions, Goate-like iumpes and friskes of
women as well as men; proclaiming wanton immodesty, and tending only to the
inflaming of lust, that they would not well beseem an honest Pagan; and better
fit a cunning Curtizan, who cast before men these alluring baits, that they
may be catched in the snares of lust; then for a true Christian, who esteems
modesty and chastity her best ornaments. Unto these we may add carding and
dicing, as they are almost generally used. For suppose that all games at them
are not simply unlawful, and that the argument of lots takes no hold of them,
because they are in nothing like, but as they are both disposed by Gods
providence, which has a chief stroke in disposing all things, or because (as
they allege) the most games stand not so much upon chance and casualty, as on
the Art and skill of the player, the which they think cleared by experience,
in that a bungler playing with a cunning gamester, though he get some games,
yet he is no constant winner, but if he continue long at play, is almost sure
in the end to depart a loser; yea, let it be granted unto them, either that
they are not therefore unlawful, because providence rules them; which is not
abused when we depend upon it for decision of the least matters, but when it is
joined with irreuerence and profaneness, or that there is great Art and skill
to be used in those games that are most casual, without all deceit and
imposture, which is allowed amongst all gamesters; yet can they not deny, but
that they are liable to many abuses, which are so generally incident unto them
that spend their time in them, that they are at least generally of evil
report, in regard of their common abuse beseeming Christians, and dangerous
snares, in respect of common corruption to entangle us in many sins, or else
such multitudes would not be inueagled with them; as fretting and chafing,
cursing and swearing, repining and murmuring against Gods providence, when it
crosses their pleasure, and does not give them such success as they wish;
sharpening their tongues like swords against it, and wounding it with
reproaches under the names, and (as it were) through the sides of luck and
fortune; that they are common thieves which rob men of much precious time,
because they do not, like other exercises, weary them with labor either of
body or mind, and draw them on with expectation of new variety; yea, also rob
many of their purses and states, more then any other recreations. For whereas in
other games which stand most upon skill and cunning, men being beaten are
willing to give over with little loss, when they find themselves therein
inferior to those who play with them; in these which stand so much upon
hazard, their losses draw them on further and further, out of an expectation
of the changing of chance, and recovery of their loss. Now if any will say
that they are never serious in these sports, and can so moderate their passions
and affections, that they never bewray any such infirmities and corruptions,
and can long play before they burst out into any of these sins, playing for
little which they respect not, and only for recreation, and having such power
over themselves, that they can take up at pleasure, and spend at them as little
time as they list; To such I answer, that if by the arguments which by Divines
are ordinarily brought against them (as the abuse of lots, and Gods providence
directing them) they are proved simply unlawful, or if by them they are
brought to staggering and doubting whether they be lawful or no, then can they
not be lawful unto them, seeing he that plays doubting, offends in playing;
for whatsoever is not done of faith, is sin, though in it own nature it be
indifferent. Romans 14 23.
But suppose that upon thine own grounds thou art persuaded, that such games
are allowable; then my resolution is, that if withal thou have such rule of
thy passions and pleasures, that thou can preserve thy self well enough, both
from inward fretting and outward fuming, from covetous desiring gain by play,
and can also moderate thy self in expense of time; then it were thy best
course to forbear them altogether, and next unto that to use them rarely. For
it is unto thee a matter of small difficulty and labor, seeing he that has
truly such power over himself, that playing at these games he can with ease
shun the abuses of them, may with much more ease refrain from using them; even
as it is much better and more safe to avoid infected places, when we are at our
choice, then to go into them, presuming upon our Antidotes and preservatives;
to keep our selves (if we can) from danger of being hurt and wounded, then to
undertake quarrels, trusting to our valor and skill. Besides, if thou art a
man of such excellent temper and moderation, it is pity that so well a
composed mind should not be exercised in better employments; for make the
best of these games that thou can, yet are they but of evil report, in
respect of the daily abuse unto which they are subject; and though they were
lawful unto thine own single self, yet they may prove offensive to others,
Romans 14. 15, 21.
grieuing those who are well affected, and condemn these sports, to see thee
so ill exercised, drawing on weakelings to follow thine example, who are apt to
abuse them, wanting thy government and moderation, and countenancing and
encouraging those, who being loose and profane, make these games their
ordinary occupation, to continue in their course, when they can excuse
themselves by such patterns and precedents as are virtuous and religious.
Finally, these games which are unto such multitudes the common causes of so
much sin and evil, cannot be but somewhat dangerous unto us. And who, that
respects not his gain more then his safety, will walk aloft upon a rope
with much difficulty and peril, when as he may securely go upon the firm
ground? For he that loves danger, shall perish in it, it being just Ecclus.
3. 27.
with God, by vvithdrawing his helping hand, to let us catch a fall, because
we rush into tentations, and take delight to walk in such slippery places.

CAP. XXII.
Of diverse Cautions which ought to be used in all our Recreations.

. Sect. 1 That recreations must be used with moderation, in respect of our
love of them.
THe next point to be considered in our recreations, is the rules and cautions
which are to be observed in the manner of using 1. Cor. 10. 31.
them. The first whereof is this, that as much as in us lies, we so compose
our minds and hearts, as that we take our chief delight in those which most
tend to Gods glory, and the furthering of our own salvation. In which respect
it were much to be desired, that we were so heauenly-minded, and so weaned from
worldly vanities, as that we could take our chief pleasure in holy duties,
and esteem it our meat and drink to do the will of our heavenly Father;
recreating Ioh. 4. 34.
our minds, like the Saints and Angels in heaven, in glorifying God by singing
of his praises, holy conferences tending to mutual edification, and stirring
up one another to perform service unto God with all cheerfulness and
delight. Or if we cannot, being clogged with the flesh, attain unto this
perfection, our next care must be, that we delight our selves in things
indifferent, with such lawful and lawdable recreations, as that we may in all
things, and even in our sports, have, with the Apostle, a good conscience,
willing to live honestly. Secondly, because in nothing more Heb. 13. 18.
then in recreation, we are apt to forget and ouershoote our selves, by taking
unto us an excess and ouer-measure, we are to take special care that we use
them with due moderation. For seeing recreation in the use of things
indifferent, is not simply and absolutely good, but only as it is rightly used
according to the rule of reason, and that is superfluous which exceeds this
rule, and defective which comes short of it; therefore we must carefully
conform our selves unto it, and not recreate our selves more or less then
nature requires, or then is necessary for the preserving of our health and
strength, and our better fitting for more serious employments. More specially
this moderation in our recreations must extend both to our minds and hearts,
and to the time which is spent in them. We must moderate our minds that we
do not too highly value them, but esteeming them in the number of things
indifferent, we must cause them to Dandum est aliquod interuallu^ animo; ita
tamen vt non resoluatur, sed vt remittatur. Senec. Epist. 15.
give place unto duties which are simply good and of greater importance, when
they cannot conveniently stand together. Our hearts also must be bounded with
moderation, in respect of our affections and passions, so as we burst not out
into anger and rage when we are crossed in our sports (a usual fault that
accompanies the pleasure of hawking and gaming) and neither wax proud of our
own skill and actiuity, nor be envious against those which do excel us in
them. But especially we must watch over our selves, that they do not steal
away our hearts; for this were with Solomon, in seeking pleasure, to lose our
selves in a labyrinth of delights, 1. King. 11. 4.
and for the inioying of trifles, to forgo that Jewel wherein God chiefly
Pro. 23. 26.
delights, and desires above all other things to have in his keeping. And
though we use them for our delight, yet we must take heed, that we make them
like servants to wait in the out-roomes, to come at our call, and to depart
when we have no further need of their service, and not like our best beloved
admit them to keep residence in the privy Chamber of our hearts, so fixing and
fastening our love and affection upon them, that we cannot endure to have them
out of our sight. For then we shall not only be in danger of spending too
much time about them, but after we have done with them, they will so unsettle
our hearts, and weane our affections from all good duties, that we shall not
without much labor reduce them into good frame, nor make them fit without
distraction to perform any religious duty, as hearing, reading, praying,
meditating, or else the works of our ordinary callings. And therefore though
we use pleasures, yet we must take heed, that we do not with Solomon, give
our selves unto Eccles. 2. 2, 3.
them, for of such laughter, we may rightly say it is mad; and of such mirth,
we may demand what good it does us?

. Sect. 2 Moderation must be used in respect of time.
In respect also of our time, which is spent in our recreations; we must use
great moderation, making them serve like sawces to our meat, to Sint
exercitationes and faciles and breues, qui corpus and sine mora laxent and
tempori parcant, cuius praecipue ratio habenda est. Quicquid facies, cito redi
a corpore ad animum, etc. Sen. Epist. 15. 1. Cor. 10. 7.
sharpen our appetite unto the duties of our callings, and not to glut our
selves with them, and so to make us the more unfit for any necessary
employments. We must remember that they are but recreations to refresh us, and
not occupations to tire us, and that they are allowed us to cheer our spirits,
and repair our strength, that we may be made more fit for the well-performing
of the duties of Gods service and of our callings, and not that we should by
toyling our selves in them, spend and consume them, and so be disabled for any
necessary employment. We must consider that God has not created and redeemed
us, that we should wholly follow our pleasures, and with the Israelites, sit
down to eat and drink, and rise up to play, but that we should spend our
time and strength in the duties of his service, or in the means whereby we may
be fitted for them. Neither has he appointed recreation to be the end of our
lives, but only as a means to preserve them, for more high and holy
employments, tending to the glory of God and the salvation of our own souls.
We must esteem time the most precious treasure, and that the consumption of it
is the most dangerous disease, and desperately unrecoverable; that it exceeds
all other losses, and that the wasting of it is the greatest unthriftiness.
And therefore we must not turn our recreations into pastimes, as the English
name imports, making only this use of them, to cause idle hours seem less
tedious; for this were but to set spurs to a running Horse, which of it self
posteth away speedily, and when it is once past, can never be recalled. Let us
not fool and trifle out this our most precious treasure, upon every base
vanity; or if we have done it in the days of our ignorance, when we did not
know the worth of it, let us, according Ephesians. 5. 16.
to the Apostles counsel, redeem it at any price, and recover our loss, by
redoubling our diligence in all good duties. Let us learn to set a right value
on these wares; and to this end let us not go to enquire of worldly Impostors,
who will set a base price of this Jewel, to coozen us of it, not to enrich
themselves with our spoil, but to spoil themselves also with our loss; but
rather let us think how they prize it in hell, and how willing they would be
to give millions of worlds, if they had them in their possession, for the
purchase of one day, to repent of their former courses, especially the
prodigal mis-spending of their time. Finally, let us remember, that our works
and labors which must be here dispatched, are weighty and manifold, seeing in
this world everlasting life and happiness is either gotten or lost, and that
our time is so short, that we are in danger to be benighted before we have
ended our business, and so (as the Apostle speaks) to come short of the
promised rest. That this short Heb. 4. 1. Mark. 13. 35.
time is also uncertain, seeing we know not at what hour our Lord will come
and call us to our reckoning; and therefore if we be wise unto our own
salvation, we will not spend much of this short and uncertain time in sloth
and idleness, sports and pastimes, but rather in making and keeping straight
our accounts, and in preparing our selves with joy and comfort to appear
before our Judge. Especially considering that he has assured us beforehand,
that he is most righteous, and without respect of persons, will reward every
man according to their works; that he 2. Cor. 5. 10. Math. 12. 36.
will take an account of us for every idle word which we esteem as wind, and
therefore much more will call unto a reckoning our precious time spent in
idleness and vanity; and will make us exceed in everlasting punishments, as
we have in this life exceeded in momentanie pleasures. Apoc. 18. 7. Luke 6. 25.


. Sect. 3 That they must be so used as that they may refresh the body, not
pamper the flesh.
The third caution to be observed in our recreations, is, that we use them so,
as they may refresh the body, but not pamper the flesh, and Gal. 5. 17. Romans 8.
12, 13. 1. Pet. 2. 11. Gal. 5. 13.
that we so endeavor by them to cheer our friend, as that we do not
strengthen our enemy. For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit
against the flesh, and therefore we must not use such recreations, or after
such a manner, as may feed and fat it with carnal delight; neither are we
debtors unto it to live after it, seeing this life brings death; but rather,
as the Apostle exhorts, let us abstain from fleshly lusts, because they
fight against our souls; and so use this gracious liberty which God has given
us, that the spiritual part may take occasion of doing good duties, and not
the flesh of plunging us into sin.

. Sect. 4 That in our recreations we must avoid giving of offense.
The fourth caution is, that in all our recreations we do not give any
scandal and offense, neither using such before our weak brethren, 1. These. 5.
22.
though lawful in themselves, whereat they stick or stumble with some scruple
of conscience, nor yet carrying our selves offensiuely in such as they approve,
either by spending unseasonably our time in them, or too much of that which is
in moderation allowable, or with any lightness and vanity, or by giving our
selves over to some unruly passion. Yea, as much as in us lies, we must
abstain not only from these faults themselves, but also from the least show
and appearance of them; and not only take care to do those things which are
true and just, pure and lovely, Phil. 4 8. Pro. 22. 1. Eccl. 7. 1.
but also which are of good report; not only taking care to be virtuous, but
also to be so esteemed, and have the reputation and praise (all pride and
vaineglory being avoided) which (as the shadow the body) does attend and wait
upon it. And seeing recreations are things indifferent, we are rather utterly
to forbear them, then to give unto our brethren any just cause of offense,
because the greatest danger that can hereof come unto us, is but the hazard of
our health, whereas by offending them, we may endanger the loss of their
precious souls, for which Christ has shed his blood. In which regard, if the
Apostle was so charitable, that he would Romans 14. 15, 21.
refrain from his lawful food, rather then offend his weak brother; then
how small is our charity, if we will not forbear for this cause, or at least
in offensiuely use our sports and recreations?

. Sect. 5 That all due circumstances must be observed in our recreations, and
what they are.
The fifth caution is, that we observe in our recreations all due
circumstances. As first, that it be decent and beseeming our person, place, and
calling; neither is it fit that age and youth, Magistrates and common people,
should use the same recreations, lest for the gaining of a little vain sport,
they lose their gravity, and with it their authority, and that reverence which
is due unto them from their inferiors, in respect of their age and government.
Secondly, that it be apt and fit for our callings, and to refresh and make us
more able for the well-performing of the duties belonging to them. For that
recreation is best which comes nearest to the end for which we use it, and
best fitteth us to attain unto it; as rest of the body, and exercise of the
mind, for those that are wearied with corporal labors; and bodily exercise
for them whose callings do wholly stand in the study of the mind. Or at least
some easy exercise after the greater labor of the body, or some slight and
pleasant employment of the mind, after that it is wearied with more serious
and earnest studies. In which regard I have always thought the play at Chests
most unfit for Students and Scholars, because it as much occupies and
wearieth their intellectual faculties as their other studies; and on the other
side, violent exercises unmeet recreations for those who ordinarily spend
their strength in painful labors of the body, because both these fail of
their proper end, which is to refresh the body and mind: but contrariwise do
more weary and tire them, and so make them unfit for the duties of their
callings. And although (as I confess) there is some recreation and delight in
change and variety of employment both of body and mind; yet it tends not
greatly to the refreshing of either, but rather deludeth men with a false show,
and remedieth not the evil, but only depriueth them of the sense of it whilst
their pleasure lasts, and causes them to spend and consume themselves with
more delight. Thirdly, in respect of the circumstance of time, there is
required that our recreations be seasonable, according to the saying of the
wise Solomon; To every thing there is a season, Eccl. 3. 1, 4.
and a time to every purpose under heaven; a time to weep, and a time to
laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance. In which regard there is
required, that first our recreations do not go before, but succeed the
labors of our callings, unless in case we may thereby be the better enabled,
for the performance of them; as when they shake off dullness and drowsinesse,
and make us more active and cheerful for employment, which rarely happens
in the labors of the body, but sometime falls out in the studies of the
mind, as we see in the example of Elisha, who by music 2. King. 3. 15.
was better fitted for prophecy, whilst it made him more apt to receive
divine revelations. For weariness is a kind of disease, and recreation is of
the nature of a medicine; and therefore as it is preposterous, that the cure
should precede and go before the malady, or the medicine the sickness,
unless it be such as is fit to prevent it; so, that we should refresh our
selves with recreation, before labor has caused weariness; for this were to
apply the salve to a sound place, which does no good, but if it has any great
strength and attractiue virtue, will rather cause it to pimple and draw off the
skin. And therefore as Solomon says of the use of wine; Give strong drink
unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those Pro. 31. 6, 7.
that are of heavy hearts, that he may forget his poverty, and remember his
misery no more; so may I say of sports and recreations; Give them not to them
who need them not, having no use of refreshing before they have labored, nor
of repairing their strength before it is spent, but unto those who are wearied
with paines-taking, that they may more freshly return to their labors.
Secondly, in respect of time, there is required that recreations be only used
in such seasons as by God are allowed and allotted unto them. And that is not
on the days of our rest, but on the days of our labor, not on Gods Sabbaths,
which he has appropriated to his service; but upon the week days, which he
has allowed for our own use. For if the Lord has inhibited the works of our
callings, which in themselves are in their seasons lawful and necessary, and
cannot be neglected without sin; yea, if he will not allow us on his Day, to
speak our own words, or to Esa. 58. 11, 12, 13.
think our own thoughts, because he would have us wholly devoted and
consecrated to the duties of his service; then much more does he inhibite
sports and recreations, which tend not at all to the sanctification of his
Sabbaths, and are of an inferior nature and less excellency and necessity,
and which also, in respect of their carnal delight most pleasing to the flesh,
are more likely to steal away our hearts, and to distract us in the
performance of holy duties. And therefore on this Day the recreation of our
bodies, ought to be their resting from all labor, which is not necessary to
the duties of the Sabbath; and the recreation of our minds, must be in
changing their object, not employing them in worldly cogitations, but about
spiritual exercises, hearing the Word, praying, and praising of God, holy
conferences, and lifting them up in heavenly meditations. And the like also may
be said of the Sabbaths of humiliation, when we humble our selves solemnly in
the congregation, or privately by our selves, in the sight and sense of our
sins by fasting and prayer, or when some judgment and affliction is feared
or inflicted, either upon our selves or the Church, or some special members of
it, which we desire to prevent, or that being inflicted it should be
removed. For if it were not lawful at those times for Gods people to delight
themselves with the use Exodus 33. 5.
of their best clothes, no not to refresh their bodies with their ordinary
food; then much less is it lawful at such times to feast and sport our
selves with pleasures and recreations. And this is the sin which the Lord
taxes in the Jews. In that day (says the Prophet) did the Lord of hoasts
Esa. 22. 12.
call to weeping and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with
sackecloth, and behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep,
eating flesh, and drinking wine; Saying, Let us eat and drink, for to morrow
we shall dye. And also in the Israelites; who when the Church of God was
afflicted, and they thereby called to humiliation, did lie at ease, pamper their
bellies with full diet, Amos 6. 5, 6, 7.
chanted to the sound of the Viole, and invented unto themselves instruments of
music, like David; drank wine in bolles, and anointed themselves with the
chief ointments; but were not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.

. Sect. 6 That we must consort our selves with good company.
The sixth caution is, that for our recreation sake we do not willingly
consort our selves with evil company; observing herein the Apostles rule;
Ephesians. 5. 11.
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
reprove them. Wherein our care ought to be the greater, because nothing more
causes near familiarity and friendly acquaintance, then agreement and
communion in the same delights, and nothing sooner breeds likeness of
manners and conditions, then when in our pleasures we iumpe and conioyne
together with one mind and affection. So that as our recreations with them
that truly fear God, are strong bonds to tie us unto them in love, and
forcible motives to make us also join with them, whom we so love in all good
duties and virtuous actions; so contrariwise communicating with profane
persons and carnal worldlings, in our sports and pastimes, causes us in time
to proceed from liking of the pleasure, to like the party that joins with us
in it, and from affecting of the man, we come at last to affect his manners.
Neither is there more danger in the time of plague, for one that is sound, to
keep in the same house with those that are sick; then for a true Christian,
to consort in pleasure with such as make no conscience of their ways; seeing
as well from the one as from the other, there issues and spreads a secret
poison, which with its contagion, infecteth those that come into their company.

. Sect. 7 That we must take heed that our recreations do not steal away our
hearts from God.
Seventhly, we must take care that in our recreations we forget not God, and
that they do not steal our hearts from him unto worldly vanities, 2. Tim. 3.
4.
lest by degrees we dote so much upon them, that we come under that censure of
the Apostle; of being lovers of pleasures, more then lovers of God; and grow
like those Israelites, against whom the Prophet denounced a fearful woe; who
spent the day in quaffing and carousing, and had the Harp and the Viole, the
Tabret and the Pipe, and wine at their feasts, but regarded not the work of
the Lord, neither considered the operation of his hands. Esa. 5. 12.
Which if we would avoid, we must often take occasion from our pleasures to
think of the Author of them; and be ashamed that an Heathen Poet should be
more forward in the fruition of his peace and pleasure, to acknowledge Augustus
as his God that sent them; then we to remember Virgil. Eclog. 1. Deus nobis
haec otia fecit; namque erit ille mihi semper Deus, etc.
and acknowledge the bounty and goodness of our gracious Lord, who has
multiplied his blessings upon us, not only serving for necessity, but also for
pleasure and delight. Secondly, if we would not forget God in our sports and
recreations, nor have our hearts drawn away from him; we must sanctify them
to our use by the Word and prayer. Thinking before we undertake any, if it be
agreeable with Gods will revealed in the Scriptures, or at least of an
indifferent nature, and not forbidden. And being persuaded that it is lawful
in it self, we must, before we enter upon it, make it lawful unto us by
hearty prayer for Gods blessing upon it, not using (if we be in company)
audible words and visible gestures and actions, which would savor too much of
hypocritical ostentation, but lifting up our hearts and souls only unto God
by short prayers and eiaculations. And as we are thus to begin them with
prayer, so we must end them with thanksgiving, praising the holy Name of our
gracious God, who has by these recreations refreshed and fitted us for his
service; and has given unto us this joy in earth, as a sign of his favor,
and a pledge and earnest of those everlasting joys of his heavenly Kingdom.

CAP. XXIII.
The last caution is, that our Recreation be a liberal exercise, and not
sordid for gain.

. Sect. 1 That greedy gaming for gain is unlawful.
THe last caution to be observed, is, that we use our recreations as a liberal
exercise, and not as a sordid trade to get money. To which end let us know,
that if we use gaming with a greedy and covetous desire, to enrich our selves
by impouerishing others, it is but an inordinate course, which God never
appointed and blessed to get wealth, and consequently no better then theft; yea
herein worse then the most thefts, in that other thieves rob strangers, but
these commonly their friends and familiar acquaintance, and in that it is
committed by mutual agreement, whereby the loser becomes an accessory to the
theft of the winner, and so is as well as he a robber, not only of himself,
but also of his wife and children. As also because the covetous delight which
they take in this kind of gaming, not only robs them of their riches; in
which respect, the saying of the Wise man may be applied and appropriated
heereunto, that he who loves pleasure, shall be a poor man; but also spoileth
them of their hearts, so that Pro. 21. 17.
after much loss and great experience of this gamesome misery, they have
neither power nor will to leave their folly, and to be better husbands for the
time to come. Let us know, that by such kind of greedy gaming, we set our
hearts and minds upon a strange kind of rack, which pleases in tormenting,
and tormenteth in pleasing; even the rack of tumultuous passions, which draw
and distract us diverse ways; one while hoping, another while fearing; now
rejoicing, and soon after grieuing and fretting at our loss. Finally, that
such will have a fearful reckoning to make at the day of Judgment, not only
of their precious time, lauishly misspent in these vain and wicked exercises,
but also of their wealth lewdly wasted and consumed, when in their accounts
there shall be found so much wasted in gaming, and so little given to the
poor, and to religious and charitable uses, or employed in those works of
mercy, which Christ has graciously promised should be so richly rewarded at
the last day.

. Sect. 2 Whether it be simply unlawful to game for money.
But here it may be demanded, whether it be altogether unlawful to play for
money? or if it be, whether wagering for money, and the winning or losing of it
in gaming be simply to be condemned? To the first I answer, that to play for
money, that is, to make the winning of money the maine and chief end of our
recreation, which ought to be the fitting of us the better for Gods service and
the duties of our callings, is utterly unlawful; seeing it is a corrupt and
covetous desire to get money by an inordinate way which God never appointed. To
the other I answer, that howsoever it were to be desired, that our minds were
so well composed, and so weaned from all worldly things, that they might purely
aim at their chief and main ends, without their help or any respect unto
them; yet take us as we are, needing earthly helps to further us, even to the
attaining of spiritual and heavenly ends; I cannot see (saving the better
judgment of the wise and religious) that all kinds of interposing money in
gaming, by way of winning and losing, is simply sinful and unlawful, if these
cautions be observed. First, that it be but a trifle and small matter for
which we game, which is to be measured according to the state and means of
those that play; seeing an halfe-penny is more to a poor man then a shilling
to a rich. For I call that a trifle, the losing whereof hurts not him that
loses it, in respect of the smalnesse of it, and the greatness of his means.
Even as a few drops are not missed in a whole bucket, nor many buckets-full
abate the height of the river, nor many rivers running by their fountains from
the sea, make it any whit at all the less full; and so it is in this case,
because (as between the rivers and the sea) there is a revolution of these
small winnings and losings, one winning at one time that which he lost at
another, which will make a small difference between them at the years end.
But here care must be taken, that this caution extend to both parties; neither
is it enough that the money for which I play be a trifle unto me, unless it be
so also to the party that gameth with me. For if I be rich and may well bear
it, though I often lose; and he that plays with me be poor, and unable to
sustain the loss, there is inequality and want of charity; seeing in drawing
him or consenting to accompany him in such great game, or small game, yet
greater then his poor ability can afford to lose; I shall do him hurt, and
those perhaps that belong unto him. The second caution is, that the chief
motive inducing men to play, be not greediness of gain and covetousness,
which may possibly creep into little trifles, seeing it will play at small
game rather then sit out, and being an hungry disease, will snatch at a crust,
when as no better provision is set before it. But this small play must chiefly
tend to our recreation and refreshing of our bodies and minds, for which it is
more fit then greater, because it leaves no place (unless there be more
fault in the party then in the play) unto tumultuous and disordered passions.
And if these cautions be observed, playing for money (as I think) is not
sinful and unlawful, because it neither offends against charity nor against
Justice. Not against charity, seeing it tends not either to the hurt of our
neighbor or of our selves, but to the good of both, serving to make our
recreation more pleasant and delightful; seeing it causes us to be more
earnest at our sport, and sets an edge on our appetite; whereas otherwise we
should be slack and careless, not regarding whether we win or lose; in
which sloth and remissness, there can be no delight; and makes men careful to
observe the rules and orders of the game, which otherwise would be neglected,
the one not caring to use, nor the other to require true and fair play; seeing
bare conquest, unless it be crowned, is little regarded. Neither is justice
violated, if true owners take upon them to dispose of some small part of their
goods, which they can well spare from their necessary uses, for their honest
recreation and delight; and by mutual agreement consent to hazard a small
wager (which is to be the reward of him that gets the victory) to be either
won or lost between them. Now if any object, that this kind of gaming is
against charity, because loss of a little is a little hurt, though he that
loses be not sensible of it, because it cannot be missed, by reason of the
greatness of his means: To this I answer, that it deserves not the name of
hurt, which is so little that it is not sensible; or though it were so indeed,
it is sufficiently recompensed by that delight which it adds to our
recreation of which I have spoken. Neither is it unlawful to purchase our
pleasure, or any access unto it, when as we may have it at so easy a rate.
Nor is this objection of any moment to say, that though that we lose be of
small value, as an halfe-penny or penny, yet it might better be employed and
given to the poor, seeing we are not bound to give all that we can spare from
our necessary occasions unto these uses, but may lawfully spend somewhat for
our honest delight; for by the same reason we should be bound to use only
mean apparel and few suites, though we were never so rich, and but one or
two dishes at our table, if our company be small, because this is sufficient to
keep us warm, and satisfy hunger. Neither can our play hinder our alms, if
our game be so little, that we have plenty for both uses. Yea, though we would
give all we can spare from our necessary employments, to the relief of the
poor, yet playing for a little would not hinder our charity, seeing we win
at these games as well as lose, and being so charitably affected, are more
ready to give out of our winnings, then having plenty and sufficiency, to
forbear giving because of our losings. Again, whereas it may be objected that
such kind of gaming is against Justice, because we play with a desire to win
other men's goods, and so fall into the sin of covetousness: To this I
answer, that simply to desire other men's goods, were injustice, but not so,
when it being upon equal hazard of our own, we may lose as well as win. Or
if we should desire their goods against their will, it were injustice; but not
when they are willing we should have them, not absolutely, but upon a contract
and agreement between us, which has this condition, that they shall have them
that win them. Yea, but can we be excused of inward covetousness, although
there be no outward injustice, seeing we stand not equally affected, but desire
to win rather then to lose? I answer, that desire of winning does not simply
argue covetousness; but to propound gain as the maine end of our play, and
not our recreation; not when we desire to win in playing, but when we play
out of a greedy desire of winning. For play being a kind of friendly combat
and contention, wherein we strive who shall show most skill and actiuity, every
one does naturally desire to get the victory, not simply in regard of the gain
that arises of it, but because it is a sign and evidence, that in Art and
cunning he excels him with whom he contendeth; and contrariwise auoideth
loss, not for the value of that he loses, but because it argues his defect
and insufficiency in skill, and that therein he is inferior unto him with
whom he plays, seeing he has got the victory. Even as in hunting, those that
are rich or noble, take great pains in pursuing their game, not out of a
desire to kill it, that the poor Hare may furnish their table, which in
respect of gain were but a small reward for their great labor; for in this
regard when she is killed, they could willingly wish, that she were alive
again, that by renewing her life, they might have a fit subject for the renewing
of their pleasure, and yet whilst they are hunting, they desire not only
their sport and exercise, but even to kill her, because it is the consummation
of their pastime, and the Trophy of their victory. But yet lest there should be
any fear that covetousness (which is a cunning insinuater, and sticks as
fast to corrupted nature, as the shirt to the skin, yea as the skin to the
flesh) does yet lie lurking in our recreation, we may agree in our gaming, that
the winnings shall not come into the winners purse, (although in this respect
it lawfully may, that his winnings at one time may make amends for his losses
at another, which if there be no quitting, will come to more then he is willing
to spare) but that it be converted to the use of the poor, or bestowed when it
comes to a convenient sum, partly this way, and partly upon loue-feasts, for
the preserving and increasing of amity and friendship one with another.

. Sect. 3 A serious admonition that none abuse their liberty in recreations of
this nature.
And these are the reasons that induce me to think that playing for money, if
the former cautions be observed, is not unlawful. Now if any abuse this
liberty unto licenciousnesse, and under color that it is in some cases
lawful, will use, or rather abuse it unlawfully, without any care to observe
these cautions; his sin be upon his own soul; seeing it is far from mine
intention to encourage any in their sinful courses, or that my writings should
be any cause or occasion of hartening any in those shameful abuses of gaming
for money, which are too too common in these days, whereby mis-spending their
precious time, they also consume their substance, and utterly spoil one
another with much more pernicious robbery then can be committed by common
thieves by the highway side. For they seldom take any one man's purse; but
these often, and with it even their houses and lands, and all that they
possess, which are free enough from the others violence; besides innumerable
other mischiefs which accompany these losses, and many outrageous sins
committed against God, their neighbors and themselves. Yea seeing the end of
lawful liberty, is to preserve men from lawless licenciousnesse, I was willing
to extend it as far as the Word of God would permit, that it might move all
men more willingly to contain themselves within the compass of their duties,
when as they may have sufficient means of comfort and refreshing allowed them,
within those lawful bounds which God has limited. Now if any be rich, and yet
will steal, he is twice worthy to be hanged; if any be such unruly beasts,
that having pleasant pastures, watered with the delightful streams of
Christian comforts, which like living waters are constant in their flowing,
without the stops and checks of conscience, out of Gods rich bounty allotted
unto them, and yet will not be contented, nor quietly graze under the conduct
of our heavenly Shepherd, but will leap over hedge and ditch, and break
through all fences, that they may come into forbidden pastures, because they
have rancker grass, not so sweet in it self as their own feed, but more
pleasing to their carnal appetite, because they can devour it with full
mouths; and out of a desire to drink of stolen waters, because they are
sweeter to a fleshly palate; then surely such are well worthy to be turned out
into the bare commons of penury and misery in this life, and if they repent not
of their folly, to be eternally pounded in hell in the life to come. And so
much of the first kind of cessation from our labors by lawful recreations;
of which I have spoken much more largely then at the first I intended, because
howsoever it may seem but a light subject to bestow much pains upon; yet I
plainly perceived, that it is of no light consequence; seeing it is a matter
that concerns all men, and not seldom, but almost every day of their lives;
seeing also nothing is more commonly abused unto sin, it being one of Satan's
most alluring baits, to entice us to come within the compass of his
pernicious nets and snares of wickedness; and finally, because that many who
truly fear God, and desire to use them with a good conscience, indeuouring to
please him as well in their recreations as their labors, yet know not how to
do it as they ought, and so out of scruple and timorous doubting forbear them
altogether, or else transported with their pleasure, take greater liberty then
God has allowed them, which though it be sweet for the present, yet in the
end it turns to bitterness. In all which respects there are few other things
in the whole course and carriage of our lives, for which we stand in more
need of counsel and direction, and the rather because there are few
particular rules hereof in the Scriptures, of which chiefly the weaker sort of
Christians are capeable, but only some generals, out of which they cannot so
easily gather special directions in this behalf, unless they have some guide
to go before them.

CAP. XXIIII.
Of the duties which ought daily to be performed at our meals.

. Sect. 1 That we ought to take special care of our carriage at our meals.
THe second kind of cessation from our labors, is that time which is spent
daily in taking our repast and refreshing of our bodies, by receiving of our
food, whereby our decayed strength is repaired, our health preserved, and we
enabled to the better performance of the duties of our callings. The which is
to be performed of us, not as mere natural men, but as Christians, using
therein such rules and cautions as the Word of God prescribes unto us, that we
do not famish our souls, whilst we feed our bodies, nor weaken our
spiritual part and defile our selves with sin, whilst our outward man is
refreshed and strengthened with the use of Gods creatures. For as the devil
lays in every place baits and snares to entrap us, so especially upon our
tables, and mingleth the poison of sinful corruption with our meats and
drinks, that if we do not use them in the fear of God, and keep a narrow
watch over our selves that we offend not in them, they will prove no less
dangerous to our souls, then necessary and profitable for the refreshing of
our bodies. And this David implies, where making many fearful imprecations
against Psalm. 69. 22.
his own, and our Savior Christ's desperate enemies, he prays that their
table might become a snare before them, and that that which should Job 1. 5.
have been for their welfare, should become a trap. The which made holy Job so
careful to sanctify his children after the days of their feasting, and to
offer burnt sacrifices to expiate their sins, because he well knew how prone
they were through humane frailty, to offend against God, by abusing of his
blessings.

. Sect. 2 Of the duties which ought to be performed before we eat, and first,
that we must sanctify the creatures to our use by the Word.
Let us therefore in the next place consider the duties which belong to all
Christians in receiving of their food; the which are to be performed, either
before we eat, at our meals, or afterward. Before we eat, our duty is to
sanctify the creatures by the Word and prayer; for howsoever every creature of
God is good in it self, yet it is not so unto us, unless it be sanctified
unto our use. They are sanctified by the Word, when as the use of them is
warranted unto us by the Scriptures, that is, when as we do not receive them
as absolute owners of them, but acknowledging God the Author and chief Lord
both of them and us, do receive them at his hands as his free gifts, the which
he bestowed upon us, first, by his law of Genesis 1. 26. to 30. and 9. 3.
creation, not only making all the creatures for man's use, but also by his
word, giving him dominion and lordship over them, and liberty to use them for
his food and nourishment. But this first gift and donation from God is no
sufficient warrant unto us, seeing through the fall of our first parents we
lost all our dominion, right and interest which we had unto the creatures,
unless our Charter be renewed by Christ, who by satisfying Gods Justice for
our sins, has recovered our right, and reentered us into our possession
which we lost by Adam; and has purchased for us that glorious liberty of the
sons of God, whereby we may with a good conscience freely use all Gods
creatures, without any doubting, scruple or superstition, for our necessity and
profit, yea for our comfort and delight. So that now we are not to put any
difference between meats, seeing unto the pure all things are pure, and every
creature thus sanctified is Tit. 1. 15.
good; and if for conscience sake we abstain from flesh more then fish, or any
one meat more then another, we shall show hereby that we are not taught of
Christ, but that we have (as the Apostle plainly speaks) 1. Tim. 4. 1, 3.
learned this lesson in the school of the devil. Only our care must be,
that we be ingrafted into Christ by a lively faith, by whom only we have
right unto the creatures, and that we know our liberty, to the end we may use
it without doubting. For otherwise we are intruders and usurpers, who having no
right unto any of Gods blessings, shall have a fearful account to make for
incroaching upon them, and (as it were) like thieves living upon the spoil.

. Sect. 3 That we ought to sanctify the creatures to our use by prayer and
thanksgiving.
But howsoever it is necessary that we be always in this state of Christian
liberty, and have the knowledge and acknowledgement of it habitually in us; yet
not that we should, every time we eat, particularly meditate of all these
things; only it is sufficient, that having this Charter of our liberty in our
keeping, we bring it out as often as we have occasion, especially when our right
unto the creatures is called into question, either by the devil, the world or
our own flesh. And that acknowledging God to be the Author of all these
blessings which we receive, who not only gives them unto us, but also all
their virtue and power, whereby they become effectual for our nourishment, we
do take them not chiefly as our own provision, but at his hands as his
gracious gifts, which cannot nourish us by their own virtue, but as he
inableth them heereunto by his blessing. In which regard it is necessary, that
before we receive the creatures, we do in the next place sanctify them unto
our use by prayer and thanksgiving, craving Gods blessing upon our meats and
drinks, that being thereby made effectual for our nourishment, we may in the
strength of them do him more diligent and faithful service. For to this end
God 1. Tim. 4. 3, 4, 5.
has created our meats and drinks, that they should be received with
thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth, as the Apostle teaches
us, seeing every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be
received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the Word of God and
prayer. And this has been the practice of the faithful in all ages. So we
read that the people would not eat before Samuel came, because he did first
bless the sacrifice, and afterward they did eat that were bidden. And the
Apostle 1. Sam. 9. 13.
Paul, though he were among Heathens, Infidels, and common soldiers, yet
before he falls to meat with them, gave thanks unto the only true God in
the presence of them all. And this also was the ordinary and constant custom
of our Savior Christ himself, which was the reason why Act. 27. 34, 35. Mark.
6. 41. Matthew. 26. 26. Luke 24. 30, 31.
the two disciples knew him by his blessing of the bread, before he brake it
and gave it unto them. Which examples that we may imitate, let us consider that
no creature has virtue and power in it self to nourish us, unless God that
made it, do by his blessing sustain it, and give vigor and strength unto it,
that it may be effectual for this use. For as our Savior says, Man lives
not by bread only, but by every word which proceeds out of Matthew. 4. 4.
Gods mouth, that is, that special and powerful word, whereby he appoints
and commands it to nourish us. And if the Lord do take away the staff of
bread, that is, the virtue and strength of it, we shall eat, and not be
satisfied, be famished in the midst of our plenty, and even consume and
Leuit. 26. 26. Ezech. 4. 16, 17. and 5. 16.
waste away in our iniquity. Yea, if the Lord curse his blessings for our
ingratitude, we shall either have no power to feed upon them, or in stead of
nourishing us, they will be the causes of weakness, sickness, and death it
self. Of the former not long since my self, with many others, savv a
fearful example, in one whom I visited in his sickness of which he died;
whose strength being little abated, and his appetite very good to his meat,
would often and earnestly desire to have some brought unto him; but no sooner
did it come into his sight, but presently he fell into horrible shaking and
trembling, distortions and terrible conuulsions of all his parts, so as the bed
would scarce hold him vvhereon he lay; all which presently ceased, as soon
as the meat was taken away. And this was done so often, till at length he
grevv weary of so many attempts in vain, and prepared himself for death,
giving unto us all many signs of earnest repentance. Among others he
penitently confessed, that this punishment was justly inflicted upon him for
his abuse of Gods good creatures, especially because he would neither of
himself, nor by the persuasion of his friends, give thanks unto God when he
received his food, which he conceived to be the cause why now God would not
suffer him to have the use of his creatures, which he had so often abused by
his gross ingratitude; and earnestly desired that he might be an example
unto all men in this fearful judgment, that they might escape the like by
shunning his sin. The which being so notorious, I thought fit in this place
to insert, though no man is more sparing in such particular relations. Neither
let any man here say, that all this might proceed from some natural causes,
and that there might be some such like reason given of it, as of that disease
which Physicians call (...), when one bitten by a mad dog, fears the water,
like the dog that did bite him. For howsoever it Dios^or. l* 7. c. 2.
was an example strange and wonderful, yet do I not say nor think, that any
thing in it was supernatural and miraculous. But let us not for this cause
neglect to make an holy use of it, in avoiding this sin, which God by this
fearful judgment brought home to this poor man's conscience, unless we
would proclaim, that nothing but miracles can affect us. For howsoever God
brings these things to pass by natural causes, yet because they are so
far out of the ordinary course of nature, and do so rarely happen; and
seeing by a special providence, God causes a concurrence of seldom meeting
causes; that they may produce such strange effects after a wonderful and
unwonted manner; such examples should not be much less effectual to work
upon our hearts and consciences, then miracles themselves, seeing they are
purposely sent of God for this end. And as God may justly for our
unthankfulness utterly deprive us of the use of his creatures; so does he
often in their use turn his blessings into curses, making them through our
abuse the causes of all diseases, yea of death it self, as common experience
shows; yea, he may justly cause the least bit of meat or crum of bread to
choke in stead of nourishing us, the which also has sometime happened.
Again, let us consider that it is brutish and swinish ingratitude, if when God
opens his hand, and fills us Psalm. 114 27, 28. and 145* 16.
with plenty of his good pleasure, we do not by the eye of faith look up to
the Author of all our good, to render unto him thanks for all his blessings;
yea, herein we shall be much worse then beasts, in that diverse of them
acknowledge their masters, and recompense their care and cost, by their
profitable labor, according to that of the Prophet, The Ox knows his owner,
and the Ass his masters crib; but Israel does not know, my people does Esa. 1.
3.
not consider.

. Sect. 4 Of some short meditations before we eat.
Unto this prayer and thanksgiving, let us add in the next place, as
opportunity will serve and our company and occasions permit, some short
meditations, before we eat, or in the beginning of our meal; as first of Gods
infinite goodness and bounty, who preserves and nourishes all his creatures,
especially us by a more special providence, providing for us sufficient plenty
of all good blessings, and causing us to enjoy them with peace and safety.
Whereas there are many afflicted and poor servants of God, who would be glad
to feed upon our reuersions and leauings; and are in danger before they rise
from their table, to have their throats cut, and their meats mingled with
their blood. Yea, consider that thou inioyest from God, not only this plenty
with peace and safety of body and state, but also with it the light of the
Gospel, and the food of thy soul, whereby thou may be strengthened in all
grace, and nourished unto life everlasting, which many poor souls have not at
all, or secretly and by stealth, with extreme hazard of their states and
lives. Unto which meditation of Gods mercy and bounty, let us join the
consideration of our own vileness and unworthiness, in which, if God should
look upon us, he might justly deprive us of all his benefits, and not suffer
us to have a bit of bread to satisfy our hunger, nor a drop of drink to
quench our thirst. Let us remember that at our meals we are to nourish two
ghests, the soul as well as the body, and let our chief care be to give best
welcome to our best ghest; the which will bring unto us chiefest comfort. For
what food our body receives, it keeps not, but within a few hours is again
vexed with hunger; but the food of the soul shall still remain, and we
shall have the fruit and benefit of it in this life and the life to come. Let
us consider, that as we feed in great part upon mortal and corruptible
creatures, so our bodies like our meats are mortal and corruptible; and
therefore following our Saviors counsel, let our chief care be for our
immortal souls, and to labor, not for the meat that perishes, but for that
which endures Ioh. 6. 27.
to everlasting life. Finally let us remember, that this our food is part of
that allowance which our heavenly Father gives unto us as his household
servants, that being strengthened hereby, we may more cheerfully do him
service, in performing those duties which he requires of us; and therefore as
God makes his creatures to serve us, so let us dedicate and deuote our selves
wholly to the service of our great Lord and Creator, using so his blessings,
as that they may be helps and furtherances, and no impediments and lets, unto
the well-performing of all Christian duties.

. Sect. 5 Of the duties which ought to be performed at our meals; and first,
that we use Gods creatures with temperance and sobriety.
And these are the duties which we are (as much as conveniently we can) to
perform before or at the beginning of our meals. The duties which we are to
practice whilst we are eating and drinking, are diverse. First our care must be,
that we use the creatures of God with temperance and sobriety, so as they may
serve for the satisfying of our hunger, and the sustentation and strengthening
of our frail nature (which if it be not misguided by our corruption, is in it
self content with a little) and not tend to their weakening and disabling unto
all good employments; for the feeding and refreshing of our bodies, that they
may be fit servants for our souls in all Christian duties, and not the
filling and glutting of them, whereby they become till they be emptied,
unprofitable burdens to the soul, and good for nothing but sloth and sleep.
Now this temperance must show it self in two kinds; first, in our provision;
and secondly, in the applying of it to our own use. Our provision of meats
and drinks ought not to be ouer-costly and curious, excessive and superfluous,
which becomes not Christians which profess sobriety, but rather heathens,
epicures, and belly-gods, who place a great part of their happiness in
pampring their flesh with all kinds of voluptuousness. But ordinarily our
provisions ought to be competent, not excessive and curious; and rather savor
of frugality, then of lavish, waste, and prodigal superfluity. Yet that our
Christian moderation and frugality may not be pretended and abused of any as a
mask, to hide under it, their base and sordid avarice and niggardliness, we
are in this temperance of our provisions to observe these cautions. First, that
therein we have respect to our place and calling, our means and ability,
making our provision for our tables so, as it may be fitting and suitable in
these respects; on the one side not exceeding our means, seeing frugality is
the nurse and fountain of true bounty, and on the other, that it do not come
much short of them, our charge and other necessary expenses being considered.
And thus David a King numbreth it among Gods special favors, that he had not
only given him sufficient maintenance and convenient food, but had thoroughly
furnished his table as beseemed a King, and had not only filled his cup, but
caused it also to Psalm. 23. 5.
ouerflow. Secondly, that we have respect to the times: for howsoever
ordinarily our moderation must be bounded with parcimony, yet at times
extraordinary, as at our solemn feasts, and when we give entertainment, either
to strangers, or our superior friends much respected of us; it must enlarge it
self even unto liberality and large bounty. And thus Abraham feasted his
friends at the weaning of Isaac; and Leui is said to have made Luke 5. 29.
a great feast to give our Savior Christ entertainment; and our Savior
himself at the marriage feast turned the water into wine by miracle, that
there might be sufficient plenty. Thirdly, we must take heed, that our Ioh. 2.
7.
moderation in our provisions tend to the maintenance, and not the decay of
good hospitality, which is so much commended unto us in the Scriptures. Heb.
13. 2.
Neither does one virtue or Christian duty, if it be right and true, exclude
another, but contrariwise are inseparably linked, giving to each other mutual
support and aid; and they which seem to be in this number and do not thus,
are but shadows, false and counterfeit. Fourthly, we must be careful that it
be no hindrance to the poor, and to the works of mercy and Christian charity,
but contrariwise what we save by this moderation in provision, from that which
our state and ability might well afford to spend, we must not hoord it up for
our private use, but liberally bestow it in almsdeeds and other religious and
Christian uses, knowing that our riches are not absolutely our own, but lent
unto us of God, to be employed for the glory of our Master, and good of our
fellow-seruants.

. Sect. 6 That we must be temperate and moderate, in respect of the quantity of
our meats and drinks.
But especially our temperance and Christian moderation must show it self in
our eating and drinking, and that both in respect of the quantity and also the
quality of our food. First, for the quantity, our care must be, that we at
least ordinarily eat and drink no more then is fit for the sufficing of
nature, and the preserving of our health and strength. For howsoever some may
lawfully have their tables thoroughly furnished, yet none may rise from them with
full and glutted bellies; though our cups with David's, may be filled till they
run over, yet the ouerflow must not be into our own bellies, and much less
mount so high as to our heads, but like Salomons cisternes, they must have
their waste into the streets, and Pro. 5. 15, 16.
serve as fountains to water and refresh the thirsty lands. Though it be a
blessing of God promised unto the faithful, that they shall eat in plenty,
and Joel 2. 26.
be satisfied, that they may take occasion thereby to praise the name of the
Lord for all his bounty and goodness; yet it is a fearful curse and heavy
judgment, to be given over unto our own carnal appetite, and a grievous
sin to mind so our bellies, as that we take more care and pains to please
them, then to please God; which is to be a right belly-god indeed, to be
transformed from men to beasts, who are led more by their sense and appetite,
then by reason and Religion, and have their gluttonous panch the chief state
of their souls, and not in their head and heart; herein like as Clemens
compares them to the sea-Asse, which only among all other Clem. Alex.
paedagog. l. 2. c. 1.
living and sensible creatures has his heart in his belly, as the Philosopher
has observed. It is true that we may lawfully use the creatures, not only for
the necessity of nature, but also for our comfort and seasonable delight; and
that we may at some times more then other, take our liberty to feed Genesis 43.
34. Ioh. 2. 10. Psalm. 104. 15. Esa. 5. 18, 19. Hag. 1. 6.
upon them more liberally, as at the time of our feasting and rejoicing one
with another; for it is one chief end of the blessing of plenty, that we
should have the fruition and benefit of it; and a punishment which God
threatens for sin, that the people should be scanted in their food, and have
only sufficient for necessity of nature, to hold life and soul together, but
not enough to satisfy the appetite and strengthen the body. But to exceed in
gluttony, and to pamper the belly with superfluous excess; to surcharge the
stomach, and to oppress the mind and heart; to make the body with too much
eating and drinking heavy and lumpish, and the mind dull and blockish, is
never seasonable at any time, nor suiteable for Pro. 23. 29, 30. and 25. 16.
and 31. 4, 5, 6, 7. Luke 21. 34.
any person. For this is expressly forbidden in many places of Scripture, and of
our Savior Christ himself by a special Mandate and Memento; Take heed to
your selves, lest at any time your hearts be over charged with surfeiting and
drunkenness, and so that day come upon you at unawares, etc. So that we are
with equal care to avoid excess in meats as well as drinks; for Plures
quippe sunt (scili^et virgins) quae cum vino sint sobriae, ciborum largitate
sunt ebriae, etc. Hier. ad Eustoch. de custod. virg.
howsoever drunkenness above gluttony exposes to worldly shame, because it
has not so many colors and excuses to hide and cover it, and has not, like
the other, the wits at home to make apologies in its own defense; yet is it no
less to be avoided, as being a sin alike odious unto God; and pernicious
and hurtful unto us, and our poor neighbors. For it is a shameful abuse of
Gods rich bounty, when we take occasion thereby to disable our selves unto the
duties of his service; and a miserable servitude which we bring upon his good
creatures, when as we make them serve our filthy lusts. It is a notable means
to weaken Cum Graeci gulosos (...) appellarunt, been mihi videntur eorum finem
significasse, vt qui eos (...) h. e. a salute alienos intellexerint. Clemens.
paedag. lib. 2. cap. 1.
our bodies, and fill them with diseases, to impair our strength, and shorten
our lives. It fills them with crudities, noisome humors, and dangerous
obstructions, quenches the natural heat, dulleth the senses, and deaddeth
both the vital and animal spirits. And consequently, it disableth all the
faculties of the soul unto their functions and operations, seeing it works
by the body as by its instrument, and so makes it unfit and unable, slothful
and sluggish unto all good duties. It makes us slaves unto our meats and
drinks, over which God has made us Lords and rulers, and hurtful and
injurious unto the poor, whilst we devour that portion of our superfluity,
which God as their right has allotted unto them. It makes us foolishly, for a
short delight, which lasts no longer then the meat is in eating and
swallowing down, to endure many hours grieuances through the discension of
the belly, the oppression of the stomach, the pain of the head, yea
oftentimes dangerous surfets and sicknesses accompanying them which hazard
life it self. Yea in truth, for a forced and false delight* (for what true
pleasure is there in eating and drinking, when hunger and thirst are fully
satisfied?) it forfeiteth that pleasure of the meal following, making us to
forgo our meat, or to eat it with loathing, which would be equally
delightful with that which went before, if we came unto it with like
appetites. Finally, this worse then brutish delight, which is so short and
momentany, depriueth us of those heavenly joys which are everlasting, and
plungeth us into woes and miseries which never have end, whilst it armeth the
flesh against the Spirit, and inableth it to foil and cast us headlong into
many sins, as our Savior has implied in the parable of the rich glutton,
who took his Luke 16. 19.
chief pleasure in going richly apparelled, and faring deliciously every day.

. Sect. 7 Other directions concerning the quantity of our meats and drinks.
Now for the quantity of our food which every one ought to eat and drink, no
certain rule can be given, no more then we can appoint any one size of
apparel to fit men of all statures, seeing one man's stomach, health, and
strength, requires more, and another man's less, and that which is but
sufficient to satisfy one, is excessive and superfluous to another, and would
cause him to surfeit with too much fullness. And therefore the proportion of our
meats and drinks is to be measured unto every one by Christian prudence,
which we may help by observing these general rules. As first, every man must
carefully observe out of his own experience, how much is ordinarily sufficient
for the nourishing of his body, and the preserving and increasing of his health
and strength, and keep himself unto this proportion as near as he can, not
pleasing his greedy appetite, by adding to this sufficiency that which by
experience he finds to be superfluous and more then enough. Secondly, that
being in health and strength, or troubled with such infirmities, which cause
greater appetite then good disgestion, they do not fully satisfy hunger, nor
eat so much as the stomach craves, seeing this fullness within a few hours
will turn to a superfluous burden, and this enough will prove too much; but
they must (as we say) rise with an appetite, and not make such a churles feast
as we can eat no more. For herein Christian temperance is exercised, when we
stint the stomach of its desire, and teach it good manners, following herein
the direction of reason, and not (like brute beasts) of sense and appetite. In
which respect, one gives this rule, that our ordinary Sunt tibi quotidiana
ieiunia, and refectio satietatem f^giens, etc. Hyer. ad Eustoch.
diet should be a daily abstinence, and our refection without all glutting
satiety; for it profits not to go two or three days with empty bellies, if
afterward we surcharge them with too much fullness, and recompense our fast
with saturity and excess. Lastly, seeing the end of our eating and drinking
is, that we may be fitted and better enabled for the service of God, in the
common duties of Christianity, and the particular duties of our callings, we
must therein respect grace as well as nature, the glory of God, as well as the
preserving of our health and strength, and the thriuing of our souls, as well
as the nourishment of our bodies. In which regard, the best rule of Christian
moderation in our diet is, that we eat and drink so much only, as may make
us fit to serve God in religious duties, as hearing, reading, conferring,
praying, and in the duties of our callings, that we may, having our spirits
refreshed, and our strength repaired, more cheerfully and vigorously undertake
and perform them; and not so much as dulleth our spirits, and makes our
bodies heavy and sluggish, whereby we fail of our ends, and become less fit
for any good duties. And this the wise Solomon requires even of Princes
themselves, that Eccl. 10. 17.
they eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness. And our
Savior Christ would have us so to eat and drink, as that thereby we should
Luk 21. 34, 36.
not be disabled unto continual watchfulness and prayer. To which purpose one
says well, that when we rise in the night to prayer, our stomakes Ad orationem
tibi nocte ^ergenti non indigestio ructum faciat, sed inita^, Hier ad Eustoch.
Non est ergo omnino a varijs cibis abstinendum: Sed in ijs non est studium
ponendum. Clemens paedag. l. 2. c. 1.
should rather vpbraide us with their emptiness, then with their crudities and
indigestion. And as we must avoid excess in quantity, so also in variety; not
that it is unlawful to eat of diverse dishes, so far forth as it will stand
with our health and strength; but that we do not too much affect it, and pitch
our study upon it. For if we do, it will be a notable means to draw us on
to excess and gluttony, when as having eaten enough, we will still feed on
new and more dainty dishes then the former, because we would please our taste
with this variety. It is a notable means, unless we have Ostridge stomachs,
to disturb concoction, and impair the health, when we make them like a Noble
man's kitchen, furnished and fraughted with all varieties which land and sea can
yield unto them, iumbling together (like wares in a Brokers shop) things of a
far different nature, some whereof are of easy disgestion, and some of hard,
and some also of a middle nature; as if herein also they would make this
Microcosme and little world of man, like unto the greater world, containing in
it, at least, some small fragments of innumerable creatures. Finally, as it is
hurtful for the body, so not good for the soul, the which is wained from
spiritual comforts, whilst it is too much affected with these carnal
delights. For as one says, When the body is resolved, and as it were, melts
Cum corpus refectionis delectatione resoluitur, cor ad inane gaudium relexatur.
Gregor.
in this pleasure of refection, the heart is loosened unto vain joy and
sensual delight.

. Sect. 8 Of moderation in respect of the quality of our meats.
In respect of the quality of our meats and drinks, Christian temperance and
moderation must be used, in bridling our appetite and taste, that they do not
licourously long after, at least in our ordinary diet, such as Luke 16. 19.
are curious and costly, daynty and delicious, which was the sin of the rich
Glutton, who in the parable was condemned unto hell, and tormented in that part
wherein he had chiefly offended. For howsoever it is lawful for all men at
some times to feed upon the choysest of the creatures, if the cost exceed not
their state and means, and if they be not much affected, but come into their
way without any great care or trouble; and though it be lawful at all times
for those that are weak and sickly, 1. Tim. 5. 23.
and cannot safely eat courser and and ordinary meats, to provide, if they
be able, such dainties and meats of good nourishment and easy concoction, as
will agree with their stomachs; yet for those that are healthy and strong, it
is not lawful that they should, with the rich Glutton, every day fare
deliciously, nor convenient, though it were lawful, to do it often and
ordinarily, seeing he who will do all that is lawful, Cito enim adducuntur vt
ea faciant quae non licent, qui faciunt omnia quae licent. Clemens paed. l. 2.
c. 1. Solus in illicitis non cadit, qui se aliquando and a licitis caute
restringet. Greg. in Moral. Exodus 19. 12.
will within awhile do also that which is unlawful; he that will walk upon
the brinke, is still in danger of falling into the water, though yet he be upon
firm ground; and he that will stretch his desires to the extreme borders of
virtue, is within one step of vice, the which was typically implied at the
giving of the Law, where the Lord forbids the people, not only to come into
the Mount, but also to touch the borders of it. And therefore if we would shun
intemperance in diet which is utterly unlawful, we must moderate our appetite
even about those things which are lawful; and avoid carefully all means that
tend unto it. Among which, one of the chiefest is delicacie of meats, which
draws on the appetite unto excess, with the strong Cable of bewitching
delight. And not much less dangerous are pleasant sawces curiously cooked;
both which are to be ordinarily shunned of all who would be temperate in their
diet. For as we cannot attain unto Justice by coveting much wealth, nor unto
temperance by the means of intemperancie; so neither (as one says) can we be
Clem. Alex. paed. l. 2. c. 1.
brought unto a Christian-like course in our diet by curious-cooked cates, and
alluring delicacies. In which regard the same author says, and Socrates
Plutarch. de garrulitate.
long before him, that we are to take heed of those meats, which allure us to
eat when we are not hungry, and of those drinks, which entice us to drink
when we are not thirsty, because like witchcrafts they delude our appetites,
the devil the great deuourer of mankind, having a great hand in them. For
howsoever all things were made for man, yet it is not good for him to use all
things, nor at all times, but the circumstances of time, occasion, manner, and
other relations and respects to the things used, are of great moment to make
them profitable or hurtful. Add heereunto that these dainty cates require
much expense of time, and trouble both of body and mind in those that provide
them, which made Epicurus the Philosopher himself, who placed man's chief
felicity in voluptuous pleasure, in teaching rules of diet, which might bring
with it most delight, to appoint notwithstanding unto his disciples for their
ordinary diet, herbs, roots, fruits, and common fare, because these were at
hand and easily cooked, whereas the tedious trouble in providing dainty fare is
so great, that the short delight of fruition will in no sort recompense it. And
how much more then should we, who profess Christianity, restrain our appetite
from affecting these delicacies, even for conscience sake; seeing, if not we
our selves, yet some other for us (which charity makes much alike) do spend
the strength of their minds and bodies, in making and cooking these curious
provisions, and waste and mis-spend their precious time, for the base purchase
of these voluptuous pleasures? And as they require great labor and expense of
time in him that provides them; so also excessive cost in him who pays for
them; in which respect I appeal unto their consciences, with what comfort they
can hope to appear before their Judge, calling them before his Tribunal to
give up their accounts; when as it shall appear that they have consumed so
many of his Talents entrusted unto them, in riotous and dainty cheer; and have
bestowed so little upon the poor members of Jesus Christ, to supply their
necessities and keep them from famishing. Now how little profit do they
purchase unto themselves at these dear rates? If indeed by bestowing treble
cost Qui ese is vtuntur vilissimis, sunt robustiores, saniores and
generosiore^; vt famuli dominis, agricolae possessoribus; and non solum
fortiores, sed etiam prudentiores, vt Philosophi diuitibus. Clem. pa dog. l. 2.
c. 1.
upon their diet, they could but double their strength, health, and all their
abilities both of body and mind, and so become twice themselves, and as much
outstrip other men in these things, as they exceed them in these costly
curiosities, they should have laid out their moneys upon a reasonable good
purchase; but we see the clean contrary in daily experience; namely, that
those who ordinarily feed on couerser fare, have good complections and sound
temperature, and are healthy and lusty, strong and vigorous for all manly
employments; whereas the other look pale and thin, as though they had but
single nourishment by their double cost, and are so effeminated in their minds
with luxury and excess, and disabled in their strength, that they are more fit
for venereall courtings, and to combat before a Carpet, then for any manlike
exercises or martial atchieuements. Yea oftentimes by glutting them with these
dainties, they fill their bodies with diseases, as gowts, palsies, stone,
collicke, and sicknesses of all sorts, from which a more spare diet, which
commonly accompanies courser fare, would have privileged and exempted them.

CAP. XXV.
Of diverse other duties which we ought to perform at our meals.

. Sect. 1 That we ought to be content with our allowance.
OTher duties there are which at our meals ought to be performed, in which I
will be more brief and sparing, because I have been larger in the other then
I purposed, the excess of diet in these times drawing me on, and making me
also exceed in prescribing rules of moderation. The next duty then which we are
to observe at our meals, is, that we be contented with our cheer, as being
that portion which God in his wise providence has thought fitting for us; and
not suffer our minds to surfeit by feeding on idle wishes of better cheer,
when our sensual appetites are stinted with ordinary fare and short commons.
Neither let us murmr and repine because we have such mean allowance, nor
envy others their full tables; much less let us (as it is the manner of many
nice wantons) excuse our too little or too mean fare, when even their own
consciences tell them that they have too much, yea, when they are so proud of
their cheer, that their dispraises serve but (as their salt meats to their
drinks) to draw on their ghests to give more commendations. Nor yet let us
(like the same persons upon other occasions) fret and fume when as our meat is
not so curiously cooked as stands with our nice appetite, chafing as much at
the small errors of the Cook, as if the good of the Common wealth, and our
own safety and salvation wholly rested on it. But let us that profess
Christianity leave these vanities, and learn of the Apostle to be contented 1.
Tim 6 6, 8. Phil. 4. 12.
with such food as suffices nature, and is fit to preserve our health and
strength; for if we would but consider how unworthy we are of the least part
of our provisions, and how far the smallest of Gods favors do exceed our
greatest deserts: and how many of Gods dear children come far short of us in
these his blessings and testimonies of his love, we should find just cause of
turning our murmuring and repining into praises and thanksgiuings.

. Sect. 2 That we may be merry at our meals.
Thirdly, so far as will stand with Christian gravity and the occasions that
shall be offered, we must be merry at our meals; for seeing then the Lord
conferreth his blessings upon us, and gives unto us these testimonies of his
love, showing that he watches over us with his providence to preserve and
nourish us, it is a time of rejoicing in the fruition of his favors. And this
is one special end for which the Lord gives us his benefits of meat and
drink, that in eating and drinking we should delight Eccl. 2. 24.
our souls in inioying the fruit of our labors; and therefore he has
bestowed upon man, not only bread and meat to nourish and strengthen him, but
also wine to make his heart glad, and oil to make him look with a cheerful
countenance. Which liberty and comfort of rejoicing Psalm. 104. 15.
at their meals, the holy Saints of the Primitive Church took unto
themselves, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with
Act. 2. 46.
gladness and singleness of heart, praising God in the fruition of his
benefits. Again, the chief end of our eating and drinking is, that being
thereby refreshed, we may be made more fit for the duties of Gods service; now
the body is no more cheared with wholesome meats, then the heart and mind with
honest mirth, and consequently the one is no less profitable then the other.
Neither is it only necessary for the soul, whose refreshing and recreation
consists in delight, but also for the body and preserving of health; and
therefore mirth is worthily esteemed one of the chief doctors amongst
Physicians, because if it be seasonable and moderate, it cheareth the spirits,
and so causes better concoction; whereas contrariwise, melancholy and lumpish
heaviness, damping and dulling them, does turn much of our nourishment into
the same humor. But yet our care must be, that as we season our meat with
mirth, so our mirth with the salt of grace, that we may glorify God in it,
who is the chief cause of our rejoicing; and mutually profit one another. In
which regard, we must take heed that our liberty burst not out into
licenciousnes, and that we do not make our selves merry with profane jests,
by abusing the Scriptures, and taking Gods holy name in vain; nor with
ribauldrie and scurrilous conceits, which tend to the corrupting of manners, and
the poisoning of our own hearts and theirs that hear us; nor with biting and
bitter gibes and frumps, which wound the good name of our neighbor, and as
much vex his heart with anger, grief and discontent, as we are delighted
with the salty wittiness of the conceit. Finally we must be careful (because
here going with the wind and tide, we may easily ouer-shoote our selves) that
we be not immoderate in our mirth, but keep our selves within the bounds of
sobriety, lest our mirth degenerate into frenzy, and so justly incur the
Wise man's censure, I said of laughter, It is mad; in which respect it is fit,
that we be Eccles. 2. 2.
careful to keep the reins still in our hand, that we may check and curb
in our mirth when it begins to gallop, lest it give us a fall, and cause us
to discover much weakness and infirmity. But as the Lord is the cause of our
mirth, so he must be the chief end of it; and as our rejoicing is of and
from him, so it must be for him and in him; according to that of the Apostle,
Rejoice in the Lord always, and again, I say, Phil. 4. 4.
Rejoice; so that we may rejoice, even with a double joy, not only in
spiritual, but also in civil and temporal things, if our joy and mirth be
honest and harmless, witty, without the froth of vanity; and so ingenuous and
charitable, that it tend not only to make our selves merry, but to delight
them also that bear us company.

. Sect. 3 Of our conferences and discourses at our tables.
The fourth Christian duty to be done at our meals, respects our speeches
and conferences, unto which is required that they be profitable, tending to
make us more holy and religious, or more wise and morally virtuous; or more
lively and cheerful unto the performance of all good duties. The first kind
of Colloquies and discourses are chiefly to be preferred, seeing we must
first seek the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, Matthew. 6. 33.
and worldly things in an inferior place, which are incomparably of less
worth. Of which conferences we may reap more fruit and benefit then of our
bodily nourishment, seeing that preserves the outward man only, but these are
the spiritual food and repast of the soul, which is by much the more
excellent part; that is but perishing food which corrupts, and we with it,
but this food of our souls will endure to life eternal. Now because, our
hearts being barren in good meditations, we cannot easily find out upon a
sudden, fit matter for these discourses, and when we do, are easily put out,
and drawn upon every occasion to fall again to worldly and idle talk;
therefore it were good for us to think beforehand on some profitable subject
whereon we may discourse and confer; or at least, that we do lay hold on
the best opportunities that for the present are offered unto us, and slightly
passing over things which are impertinent and unprofitable, as we do those
meats which do not please us, pitch upon that which best makes for our
purpose, and make our spiritual meal of it, as being that wholesome and
well-rellishing dish, for which, putting all the other back, we have all the
while reserved our stomachs. But though these religious conferences at meals
be most profitable, yet may we also lawfully talk of civil and moral
points; yea, even of our own affairs and ordinary business, or things some
way pertinent to the bettering of our selves, or some in our company, either
for the increasing of our wisdom and prudence, or the fitting of us for
action and employment, especially when we observe that our company cannot be
easily drawn to entertain such speech as wholly tends to piety and
Religion. Yet may we, as occasion serves, powder even these discourses with
piety, and lying (as it were) at the spiritual lurch, take all good advantages
to insert and interlace into these discourses something profitable for the
soul, and to bring, as much as we can, civil premises to pious conclusions.
Finally, it is neither unprofitable nor unseasonable, if our speeches at our
meals do sometimes tend to the refreshing of our wearied minds after serious
studies, with pleasant conceits and honest mirth, because though these be of
no great worth in themselves, yet they look to things of more value, and serve
as helps and means to fit and prepare us for employments of an higher nature.
The which, being a thing which we chiefly aim at in taking our repast, and in
refreshing thereby both our minds and bodies, I dare not exclude all pleasant
discourse from such meetings; for though we may not make our spiritual meal
of such light meats, yet may they well serve as sauce to quicken our appetite;
and though we may not dwell in such merry conceits; yet when our wits are
dulled and blunted with more serious discourses, we may use them (as the
Israelites did the Philistines forges) for our necessity, and descend unto them
for a while to sharpen our tools. The which course in our conferences I do
not commend as most excellent in it own nature: for it were to be wished that
we were so spiritually and heauenly-minded, that our hearts might be at all
times even ravished with delight, when we are exercised in high and holy
meditations and speeches, or bringing them to their full effect in our works
and actions; but I only allow it as lawful and well agreeing and suitable to
our present estate full of frailty and infirmity. Unto which, having respect,
I will conclude this point with this one caveat; that neither in matters
appertaining to Religion nor civil wisdom, we do in these
table-conferences, either propound or admit knotty and hard questions, or
polemicall disputes, and difficult and subtle controversies, both because
these oftentimes through pride and ouer-eager handling, do heat the heart,
and cause wrangling and contention; and also because they are not suitable and
seasonable to the time and the ends at which we aim. For it is a time of
refection and refreshing, and not of toil and labor either to body or mind,
and we must let our bows stand unbent, that they may afterward be more fit
for shooting, and not be still drawing our arrow to the head. It is a time to
recover our spent spirits, and not to consume and waste them; which will not
only make our minds unfit for employment (for if we toil them when they
should rest, they will be dull and slothful when they should labor) but also
much hurt our bodies and impeach our health, whilst these ouer-earnest
discourses about points of great difficulty, do disperse the natural heat,
and dissipate the spirits, calling them away from the work in hand, to assist
the soul in the exercise of the brain, and so cause ill concoction and
indisgested crudities.

. Sect. 4 Of the choice of our company at our meals.
The last duty in our eating and drinking respects the choice of our company:
for if we be of ability, it were to be wished, that we would follow Job 31. 16,
17.
Jobs practice, who would not eat his morsels alone, making to this end choice
of fit company to consort with us. Neither is it commendable in a Christian to
keep open house for all comers, and so to make it worse then a common Inn, a
cage of unclean birds, and a place of all mis-rule and disorder, which was the
hospitality of able men in the days of ignorance, who are more to be praised
for their bounty and zeal to housekeeping, then for their piety and prudence.
But seeing our ghests must be our companions for the time, of which there ought
to be made great choice; therefore besides those whom bonds of society,
kindred, trading and commerce, and such like respects; and those that resort
unto us as strangers, or by some casual and extraordinary accidents; we are
in our common course, as near as we can, to make choice of such only, as are
known unto us (at least in the judgment of charity) to be virtuous and
religious; and among these, such especially as are most fit for our spiritual
trading, either to make us more rich in knowledge, faith, obedience, and all
spiritual graces, or at least to be enriched of us. By which kind of meetings
we might receive singular comfort and benefit, seeing this good society and
kind familiarity between Christians, is a notable bond of love, and an
excellent and effectual means for the mutual stirring up of Gods graces in one
another, and for their strengthening and encouraging unto every good duty. In
which respect it were much to be desired, that that ancient custom in the
Primitive Church, of loue-feasts among Christians, were more in use in these
Act. 2. 46.
days, that we might not so deservedly lie open to that aspersion of
worldlings, namely, that where Religion is planted, there all good neighborhood
and friendly meetings are almost quite laid aside. To which end let us take
notice of the causes of this decay, that so they being removed, this communion
and fellowship among the faithful may be restored. And first, when men are
wholly carnal, and set altogether on fleshly delights, it is no marvel if
they take pleasure in one another company, seeing they are mutual helpers in
this worldly joy; and so if we were in any perfection spiritually minded, we
would take much more delight in consorting together, because it would tend much
to the increasing of our Christian comfort; but when by the preaching of the
Gospel those carnal joys and unlawful pleasures are so cried down, that
some forbear them out of conscience, and some, to avoid the shame of
profaneness; there follows a breach of society and familiarity, because the
bond is broken that held it together. The which is not repaired and reunited,
till in stead thereof there be a spiritual bond to link us together; and this
being so weak among most Christians, which still remain more flesh then
Spirit, it is no marvel, if there be seldom any good meetings, seeing the
bond is no stronger of such society and familiarity; whereas if they were more
spiritual, they would find in them more spiritual joy, and so entertain
them with more ardencie of affection. Another cause, which is but a branch of
the former, is, that in the time of the Gospel, carnal love, which was of old
a strong bond of fellowship, is not so hot and strong as it was, neither to
men's persons, nor yet to the pleasures of sin and delights of the flesh; nor
spiritual love so fervent as it should be, either unto our neighbors
themselves, or yet to Christian conferences, religious duties and exercises,
and those sweet comforts which we should take in mutual society, and should be
the chief motive to bring us together; for were we inflamed with this ardent
love, it would make us greatly delight in one another, and to seek all good
occasions of such sweet society.

. Sect. 5 Of the manifold abuses of our feasting one another.
Unto these we may add the many abuses of these meetings, which are notable
means of their dissolution; as because we fail in the maine ends of them, not
chiefly aiming at our spiritual good, and that we may mutually stir up Gods
graces in us by Christian conferences, edify and strengthen one another unto
all good duties, and rejoice together in the Lord by setting forth his
praises, the which were the ends that the Saints in the Primitive Church
propounded to their feasts of love; but for the most part inuiting one another
to pamper the belly with good cheer, and to please the flesh with carnal
pleasures, which leaving behind them a sting of conscience, it is no marvel
if we take small comfort to meet after this manner often together, seeing the
sweet is exceeded by the sour; and keep our hand from tasting of the honey,
which indangereth us to be wounded with the sting of sin; and though it be
sweet in the mouth, yet is turned in the disgestion into bitter choler. And
as we fail in our ends of meeting, so also in our carriage, when we are met
together, in which regard we justly deserve the Apostles censure, that we come
together 1. Cor. 11. 17.
not for the better, but for the worse. For either the time is spent in idle
and vain talking, unprofitable discourses, hurtful inuitations, to excess in
eating and drinking. Or if some religious conference be admitted, yet through
pride and want of charity it is often crossed of the main ends. For not being,
as we ought, fast linked together in the bond of love, every difference in
opinion disioynteth our affections; and wanting charity to bear with one
another, and humility to think that we may err as well as our brethren, or
patience to wait upon Gods leisure till he be pleased to reveal the truth
unto them as well as unto us; and unanimity to walk Phil. 3. 15, 16.
by the same rule, and minae the same thing, whereto we have already attained;
we commonly take delight to spend our speech in questions and controversies,
and in showing wherein we dissent, rather then wherein we agree, which
oftentimes draw men to heat and contention, yea to wrangling and hard
speeches, which alienate their hearts, and make them part more cold in love,
and remiss in friendship, then when they met together. Whereas if self-love
did not wed them to their own opinions, and pride made them not impatient that
any should dissent from them, but that in charity and Christian humility, they
desired to edify one another, not so much desiring to make them their
scholars in embracing their private opinions, as the Disciples of Christ, by
knowing better the main points of Christian Religion, or more conscionable in
embracing holiness and righteousness in their lives and conuersations; there
would be much more fruit and benefit of such conferences, and much more
encouragement unto our often meetings. Finally, the great cheer, and excessive
cost, and trouble to provide it, which is commonly used at these meetings, is
one special cause why we meet so seldom. Which though all mislike and speak
against, because they cannot meet often that meet so chargeably, their state
and means being not able to bear it, yet it fares herein as in the case of
brave apparel; all complain of it because of the cost, but none will reform
it because of their pride; whereby in their mutual entertainment, one seeks
to outvie another, till at length it come to that height of excess, and
grows so ouer-chargeable to their purse, that they leave off such meetings
altogether. Let no man therefore complain of the hardness of the times, which
will scarce afford means of necessary maintenance, and much less of
entertaining our friends to eat and drink together. For howsoever it may be
true that these times will not bear us out, if we be resolved to be still
excessive in our cheer and cost; yet if we would chiefly aim in our
meetings, at the maintaining of love, comfort and joy in one another company,
stirring up Gods graces in us, and our building up unto all good duties; I see
no cause why we should not, to enjoy these Christian comforts and spiritual
benefits, be contented with lesser cheer in our neighbors house, then when
we eat our meat solitarily at home; and consequently, no reason why the
hardness of the times should be pretended, unless our hearts be more hard
then they, and will by no means be reclaimed from this fault of excess. Now
as we are for these ends to inuit one another, so are we especially according
to our ability to make the poor our ordinary ghests, because therein we shall
do a work of mercy acceptable unto God, who has given unto us our greater
provision, that we may impart it unto those who have less, and out of our
plenty minister unto them that want necessaries. And thus our Savior
requires, that when we make a dinner or supper, we should Luke 14. 12, 13.
not inuit our friends, brethren, kinsmen and rich neighbors, namely, not to
these ends, either to receive recompense by the like inuitation, or to approve
our charity, seeing men out of natural self-love or carnal affection, may
do the like; but the poor, maimed, lame and blind, because they being unable
to make any recompense, it will be a good sign, that we do it out of simple
charity, and pure respect unto Gods Commandment, and not out of self-love,
and such respects as are natural and worldly. And this was Jobs practice, who
as he did not eat Job 31. 16, 17.
his morsels alone, so the ghests whereof he made choice, were the poor,
widow and fatherless, as he professes. Which example if we imitate, we
shall in them feed Jesus Christ himself, and be richly rewarded Mat. 25. 35,
36.
at his appearing. Or if we cannot inuit all to our table whom we desire to
relieve; our care must be to send, according to our ability, such relief as
we can spare from our selves and families, unto those whom we know do stand
in need; for though God allows us to eat Nehem. 8. 18.
the fat, and drink the sweet, yet withal he requires, that we send
portions unto the poor for whom nothing is prepared; according to the example
of the Jews at their feasts of Purim, who sent portions one to another, and
gifts Hest. 9. 22.
to the poor. To which end we ought to use all good providence and frugality,
not suffering any thing to be lost, though we have never so much; for if our
Savior, after that he had fed the poor by miracle, though he was able as
easily to have done it again, yet would not let any thing be lost of his
provision through negligence, but would have all the remainder reserved for
another time; then how much more should John 6. 12.
we be provident, whose bounty is limited by our means, that we may relieve
those poor, who are still hungry, and need our help for their comfort and
relief?

. Sect. 6 That after our meals we must show our thankfulness by praising God.
And these are the duties which ought to be performed at our meals. The duty
to be performed afterward, is true thankfulness in the heart, and outwardly
expressed both by our words and actions. Unto inward thankfulness of the
heart is required, that we know and acknowledge that we have received our
food at Gods hand, and that by his bounty and gracious providence we are fed
and nourished, and not by our own policy and power, industry and labor. The
which Moses presses Exodus 16. 15. Joh. 6. 31.
upon the Israelites to make them thankful; for if we know, that God of his
rich mercy has bestowed these blessings upon us, and has fed and nourished us
with his good creatures, it is a notable means to make us also acknowledge it,
with all due thankfulness. Even as contrariwise when we take no notice of this
bounty and providence of God in feeding us, we are ready to sacrifice unto our
own nets, and to ascribe the praise of our provision to our own wisdom, and
endeavors, Hab. 1. 16.
and so to make Idols of them. And of this we have an example in the
Israelites, who received Gods blessings for their use, but not as from his
hand, Hos. 2. 8.
and therefore were not thankeful unto him, but gave the praise to their
lovers. The which ingratitude God will punish by depriving us of his blessings,
that by our wants we may be driven to go unto him by prayer for a supply, who
in the time of plenty would not go unto him by thanksgiving, as not
acknowledging the Author of these benefits; the which also the Lord threatens
against his people of Israel in the same place. Secondly, unto this inward
thankfulness there is required, not Verse. 9. 10. 11.
only that we know and acknowledge the Lord to be the Author of our food and
nourishment habitually, but that we also actually remember this his bounty and
goodness, and having them in fresh memory, that upon all new occasions we
bless his name for them: According to that commandment: When thou have eaten
and art full, then thou shall bless the Deuteronomy. 8. 10, 11.
Lord thy God, for the good land which he has given thee; beware that thou
forget not the Lord thy God, etc. Outwardly unto this thankfulness is
required, that we express it, first, by our words, in returning thanks and
praise unto God for our food and nourishment, and for all other good blessings
spiritual and temporal which we have received at his hands; the which in
company is to be performed by one as the mouth of all the rest, and most
conveniently by the master of the family and feast; and jointly together, as
occasion, company and other circumstances will permit, by adding hereunto
singing of a Psalm, according to the example of our Savior Christ himself at
his last Supper with his Apostles. Secondly, we Matthew. 26. 30.
must express our thankfulness outwardly in our works, in employing that
strength which we have renewed by our nourishment, in the service of God, by
performing the general duties of Christianity, and the special duties of our
callings, that by both we may glorify his most holy name, who has so
graciously fed and nourished us. For if we expect this at the hands of our
servants; that being nourished at our cost and finding, they should not wait
upon themselves and spend their time about their own pleasures, but in our
service from whom they have their maintenance; which if they neglect, we are
ready to turn them out of the doors, as unprofitable drones good for nothing,
but to live upon the spoil of our goods: the^ how much more will the Lord, who
is a much more absolute owner then we, justly require at our hands, that after
he has refreshed us with his creatures, we do not spend our strength in
fulfilling the lusts of our own flesh and the pleasures of sin, but employ
it in all such good duties, as most tend to the advancement of his glory from
whom we have all our maintenance? And so much concerning the second kind of
cessation from our labors; of the third and last kind, which is taking of our
rest by sleep, I will not here speak, having a more convenient place for it,
when we have finished all our day labors, and are come to speak of the
duties in the night.

CAP. XXVI.
Of the duties which we ought to perform, when we are solitary and alone.

. Sect. 1 That when we are alone, we must not be idle and unfruitful.
BEsides those Christian duties which are ordinarily and constantly to be done
in some part of every day; there are others which are more accidental, unto
which we are not tied every day or any certain time of the week, but to be
done when as we shall have fittest occasions and best opportunity offered unto
us. And which belong not to all persons, or to the same persons at all times,
but wait upon uncertain occurrents, variety of estates, and such like
circumstances. As for example, we are sometimes by our selves alone, and
sometimes in company with others, sometimes in prosperity and joy, and sometime
in adversity and trouble, and uncertain it is in what day or what part of the
day any of these shall happen; notwithstanding there are diverse duties which
belong to these several conditions, which with no less conscience and
constancy are to be performed then the other, of which we are now come to
entreat. And first, we will show what are those Christian duties which belong
unto us when we are alone, and then what those are which we ought to perform
in the company of others. Concerning the former, we must, when we are solitary
and alone, keep a narrow watch over our selves, that we be neither idle and
unfruitful, nor ill employed and taken up with bad exercises. We must not
suffer our minds to be slothful and sluggish, and so to languish for want of
spiritual exercise; nor our hearts to remain in us dull and dead, barraine
and empty of all good desires and holy resolutions; neither yet must we in
respect of action and bodily employment, give our selves over unto ease and
sloth; for if we thus (as it were) lie fallow without any seed of grace sown
in us, the devil knowing us to be fit grounds for his husbandry, will sow in
us the cockle and tares of all sin and wickedness; if he find us thus
swept and empty of all good, we shall be fitly garnished for his dwelling, as
our Savior has taught us. If we be not employed in some good duty of Matthew.
12. 45.
Gods service, the devil will take us up like masterlesse men, and allure us
with the pay of worldly vanities, to serve him in the works of darkness. As
we see in the example of David, who spending his time 2. Sam. 11. 1, 2.
in sloth when Kings went out to war, and the Army of God was in the field,
the devil taking him at this advantage, put his presse-money of carnal
pleasure into his hand, and so employed him for the time to fight his
battles, even to the shedding of the blood of innocent Vriah and other of his
faithful servants.

. Sect. 2 That we must spend our solitary hours in good exercises, shunning
vain thoughts and intertaining Christian meditations.
And as our care must be, that we be not idle, so much more that we do not
spend our solitary hours in doing that which is ill, the which notwithstanding
inseparably accompanies the other. For no sooner do we cease to do good, but
we begin to do evil; no sooner do we leave the Oar, as we are rowing
toward the haven of rest, but the wind and tide of our corruption carries us
down the stream toward the dead sea of death and destruction. And therefore
if we would not be drawn unto ill, we must still be employed in good
exercises; keeping always a narrow watch over our minds, hearts, and actions,
that on the one side they be not overtaken with any evil, nor prostituted unto
any sin; and on the other side, that they be wholly taken up and exercised in
all Christian and holy duties. First, above all observations we must look to
our deceitful minds and hearts, that they be not stolen from us by the
subtilty of the devil when we are alone; and that they do not (as naturally
they are apt) wander in this solitariness, and go astray from the way of Gods
commandments, and so losing themselves (like Lambs in the Desert) in the
by-ways of sin, become an easy prey to the ravening Wolf. In which regard
we must keep a careful watch over our minds and cogitations, that they do
not take their liberty when we are alone, to roue and range after worldly
vanities, the pleasures of sin, and things that being utterly unprofitable
do us no good, though we spend many hours in thinking on them. For what sin
and pity is it, that such excellent faculties of the soul, the mind,
imagination, and discourse of reason, should be so vainly employed, either
about things evil and hurtful, or fruitless and impertinent, that if, after
much time thus spent, we should call our selves to account, and say; Soul,
what good have thou reaped by so many hours study and Meditation, either for
the subduing of thy corruption, or thine enriching with grace, and inabling
unto any holy duty; either for thy better securing from sin and death, or
further assurance of life and happiness; it would be stricken dumb, and not
able to answer any word? Contrariwise our care must be, that in our
solitariness our minds and imaginations be exercised in good Meditations, as
in the consideration of Gods nature and saving attributes, his Wisdom and
power, his Justice and mercy, his infinite Goodness in himself and
graciousnesse toward us, the excellency and perfection of his Law, and his
admirable works of creation and providence; the great mystery of our
Redemption by Jesus Christ, and of the means whereby we may be assured of the
fruit and benefit of it; of the inestimable privileges, which belong to all
true Christians, and of the innumerable miseries which are incident unto them
who live still in the state of infidelity and corruption; of the excellency of
spiritual graces, and of those heavenly joys, wherewith they shall be
eternally crowned in the life to come; or of the means whereby we may attain
unto them, and be more and more assured of them; of the foulness and
odiousness of vice and sin, and of the fearful condemnation, and horrible
torments of the wicked, who live and die in them without repentance. So also
we are to meditate of man's misery through the fall, and of the means whereby
we may be freed from it; and more particularly, of those special sins, unto
which by nature we are most inclined, and wherewith we are most often
overtaken; and of the means whereby we may be strengthened against them, and
enabled to mortify and subdue them; and contrariwise, in what virtues and
graces we are most defective, and of the means whereby they may be increased
in us; with what tentations we are most often and dangerously assaulted; what
part of Christian Armor is most wanting, and what place in body or soul being
weakest, is likely to give advantage unto our spiritual enemies in their
assaults of tentation, and to endanger us to be surprised and overcome. Or if
our minds be not thus taken up in things appertaining to the good of our
souls, yet at least, they must be exercised about matters that concern our
temporal estate and the works of our callings; and how we may so well
contriue our worldly businesses, as that they may by our care and providence
succeed the better when we undertake them. But here our care must be, that
our minds be so exercised about these worldly things, as that they be not
wholly swallowed up of them, and that like Eagles they stoop down to them as
unto their prey, for the relieuing of our present necessities, but that they
do not wholly dwell upon them, but, according to their divine and excellent
nature, they do again raise themselves upon the wings of faith, and soar
aloft in divine contemplations; spending some part of our solitary hours, in
our holy soli-loquies and conferences with God, divine Meditations, Prayer at
least by short eiaculations, and thanksgiving unto God for all his benefits,
reading of the Scriptures, and other holy and religious books, for the
increasing of our knowledge, and strengthening of our faith, and the directing
and reforming of our lives, with such other religious exercises.

. Sect. 3 That in our solitariness we must avoid carnal concupiscence and
the pleasures of sin.
With like care we must in our solitariness watch over our hearts, that they
be not poisoned with carnal concupiscence, nor inueagled and inamoured with
the pleasures of sin, and that they do not affect and fasten themselves upon
worldly vanities, nor dote upon uncertain riches, voluptuous delights, and
vain honors, unto which naturally they are so much inclined, and so commit
with them a kind of contemplative idolatry, when as they are debarred of
actual fruition, and cannot, in this solitary absence, perform unto them any
real worship. But seeing God requires to have them as his own peculiar and
chief possession, we must keep Pro. 23. 26.
them fast linked unto him, and so fasten them upon spiritual and heavenly
excellencies, that no worldly thing may cause a separation. And because we have
no bond strong enough to tie them together in this inseparable union, we must
often pray with David, that the Lord will knit our hearts Psalm. 86. 11. Ier.
31. 33. and 32. 40.
unto him with his holy Spirit, and so ingraue his Law, and put his fear in
them, that they may never depart from him. And that they may not be fixed and
fast glewed unto earthly things, we must with an holy violence pull them often
asunder, and lift them up with holy desires, affecting, yea Psalm. 42. 1, 2. and
84. 1, 2. Ps. 119. 97, 103. and 17. 15. Psalm. 131. 2.
hungring and thirsting after such things as are spiritual and heavenly, as
after the food of our souls, and Gods presence in the Sanctuary, after Christ
and his righteousness, and the means of our salvation, after the perfect and
full fruition of God, when as beholding his face in righteousness, 1. Pet. 2.
1.
we shall be satisfied with his Image. The which our desires and affections
must be fervent and earnest, like those of little children after their mothers
breast, when as they are newly weaned, or of women with child, which are Mat. 5.
6.
so sick with longing, that they are ready to miscarry, if their desires be
not satisfied, or of men near famished with hunger and thirst after their
meats and drinks.

. Sect. 4 That we must in our solitariness beware of sinful actions and
secret sins.
Finally, though our minds and hearts do sometimes break through the watch at
unawares, yet at least let us not so negligently keep it, as to be overtaken
in our actions with any gross sin, as either by spending our time in
idleness without any employment, because there is none to take notice of our
sloth, or by committing any sin which we would be loath to do if we were
in company, and had the eyes of men to look upon us. And to this end let us
consider, that in the greatest solitude we have God present to bear us
company, who beholds our most secret actions, not as an idle spectatour, but
as a righteous Judge, who will call all our works to account, to reward them
if they be good, 1. Cor. 5. 10.
or to punish them if they be evil; and what extreme folly and madness is it,
to make no scruple of committing those sins in the presence of our Judge,
which with all care we hide from our fellows, who, it may be, are guilty of
the same or like crimes? Let us also consider, that we carry our own
consciences ever about us, which are such witnesses as will not be bribed and
corrupted, but will one day give in true evidence before Gods Tribunal, either
to acquit or condemn us; besides all those present accusations wherewith they
are always ready to vpbraide us after our illdoing, and those horrors and
terrors wherewith they affright us, after we have wounded them with known,
wilful, and heinous sins; if at least by impudency in sinning and
customable wickedness, they be not for the time seared and senseless. Let us
remember, that there is nothing hid which shall not be made manifest, and that
all our works and actions which are done in the most secret corners, shall, as
our Savior speaks, Mat. 10. 26, 27.
be proclaimed upon the house tops; yea shall one day come to be viewed and
scanned before all the holy Saints and Angels, and be either applauded and
commended, or else derided and condemned. Finally, that it is gross hypocrisy
to seem more careful and conscionable of our works and ways, when we are in
company and in the sight of men, then when we are alone and in the presence of
God; the which abuse of his Majesty he will not endure, but will, unless we
repent of it, pull off the veil and vizard of hypocrisy, and lay open our
nakedness and filthiness to the view of the world. Or if he forbear us so
long, yet will he not fail to uncase and unmask us at the day of Judgment,
and give us our portion Mat. 24. 51.
with the rest of our fellow hypocrites, where shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.

. Sect. 5 That it is pleasant, profitable, and necessary to spend our solitary
hours in Christian duties.
And thus are we in our solitariness to watch over our minds and imaginations,
our hearts and affections, our works and actions, that they may be preserved
from all sin, and wholly taken up and exercised in religious and honest
duties; which that we may observe with more vigilance and diligence, let us
consider that it is a course, pleasant, profitable, and necessary. For what can
be more pleasant, then so to carry our selves in our solitariness, as that we
may converse with God, and feel within us the beams of his favor warming our
hearts, and the sweet communion and gracious influences of his holy Spirit
directing, comforting, and encouraging us in these good courses? what greater
joy in this life, then thus to enjoy God in some first fruits and small
beginnings, which shall be the perfection of our happiness, when we come to
full fruition? We shall find it also most profitable both for our selves and
others. For if we make this use of our solitariness, our minds will be the
better fitted for divine contemplation, when as they are sequestered for the
time from the world, as our bodies are from company, and so freed from all
those distractions and interruptions, which when we are in company, do hinder
us in this exercise. And this benefit of solitude for holy Meditations the
Psalmist notes; Stand in awe Psalm. 4. 4.
(says he) and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be
still. And our Savior Christ inioyneth it as a notable help to fit us the
better for prayer; When thou prayest (says he) enter into thy Chamber, and
when thou have shut to the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret. And as
we are hereby made more fit to converse with God, so also with men; seeing if
we keep our minds and hearts thus well seasoned in our solitariness, all our
words and actions will hold the same taste when we come into company; and if
when we are alone, our hearts be the inditers of good matter, Psalm. 45. 1.
when we come among others, our tongues will be as the pen of a ready writer,
to discover and lay open for the good of others, the things which we privately
have conceived. If when we are alone, we thus furnish and enrich our selves
with these provisions of spiritual and heavenly treasures, we shall be able
out of our store to spend liberally when we come into company, and to enrich
others also with our plenty. Finally, it is necessary that we keep this watch
over our thoughts, hearts, and actions, when we are solitary, because then we
are more in danger to fall into sin, and to become slothful and negligent in
all good duties; for then the bond of fear and worldly shame, that restrains
the flesh from many disorders, which otherwise it would willingly rush into,
being taken away, it will eagerly desire more liberty to sin, and then also
we want the encouragement of fame and commendation, which is due unto
well-doing, and is a notable spur to prick us forward in virtuous actions;
the which moved our Savior to encourage us in our private prayers, by telling
us, that howsoever by performing this holy duty in secret, we should want the
applause and praises of men, yet there is sufficient cause to make us persevere
in it, seeing our heavenly Father would abundantly supply this defect, who
seeing us in secret, would reward us openly. Again, when we are solitary Mat.
6. 6.
and alone, we are destitute of the help of our religious friends, who by
their counsel, exhortations, and encouragements, make us more ready to
undertake, and more able to perform Christian duties, and by their admonitions
and reprehensions, do raise us up by repentance when as we are fallen into any
sin. In which regard the Wise man says, that two are better then one,
because if they fall, the one will help up his fellow; and denounces Eccl. 4.
9, 10.
a woe against him that is alone when he falls, because he has not another
to help him up. And therefore in this respect also we need to double our
care, in watching over our selves when we are alone, because we have no other
to watch over us, who might supply those defects in which we are wanting. Add
hereunto, that when we are alone, we are more exposed to the danger of
tentations, seeing Satan our spiritual enemy is ready to take the advantage of
our solitude, and to assault us in single combat, when we have no seconds nor
succors to assist us in our foyles. And this made him to tempt Eve when she
was alone, that she might not Genesis 3. 1.
have the counsel and help of her husband to make resistance. And Joseph,
when there was none with him but his unchaste mistress, whom he used Genesis 39.
11.
as his wicked instrument to assault his chastity. And thus he assaulted
righteous Lot unto incestuous lust, not in Abraham's company, nor yet in Genesis
19. 30, 31.
Sodom it self, though in respect of their professed filthiness, it was a fit
Theater for such a fearful Tragedy; but when he lived solitarily in the
mountain, and had none but his daughters to bear him company, who were to
provoke him unto this uncleanness. And thus when he would tempt David unto
lust, he chooses his time when he walked alone upon the roof of his house,
and then allured him, by presenting unto his sight a fit object of
uncleanness. The which he found by often experience to be so great an
advantage, that when he was to combat with our Savior Christ, he made choice
to set up his lists in the wilderness, that having in this Matthew. 4.
solitary place, none of the former helps, he might have full liberty to bend
against him all his engines of battery, and use without any interruption the
uttermost of his power and skill to give him a foil. Finally, as solitary
places are fittest for Satan's filthy imbracements, and to pollute Iam. 1. 12,
13.
the soul with sin, so also for the unlawful conceptions of our wicked
lusts, which afterward are brought to the birth, and grow to their full
maturity in outward actions, when we come into company, as the Apostle James
implies in the like Allegory. Thus also the Prophet Micah denounced a woe
against them who devised iniquity, and in their meditations Micah 2. 1.
plotted the work of wickedness upon their beds, and when the morning is
light, practiced it, because it was in the power of their hands. And when they
had by themselves coueted their neighbors fields, they did afterward seize
upon them with open violence, etc. In which regard, we are in our
solitariness to watch most carefully over the purity of our souls, because
they are then most endangered to these spiritual rapes; and in vain shall we
labor to hinder the birth and growth of sin when we come into company, if
when we are alone, we be not as careful to shun Satan's imbracements, and
so to prevent its first conception.

CAP. XXVII.
What duties we ought to perform when we are in company.

. Sect. 1 That civil conversation excels solitariness.
But howsoever there is a fit time for solitariness, where in the former
duties belonging to it, are to be practiced of us; yet we are not chiefly to
affect it, much less to put such perfection in it, as to deuote our lives
wholly unto it, contemning and shunning all civil conversation, and all
intercourse and dealings with one another; but leaving unto it due place; and
deserved commendation if it be seasonable, we are, if they come in comparison,
generally, both in respect of persons and times, to prefer civil
conversation before solitariness, and a life taken up in virtuous action,
before that which is spent in bare theorie and contemplations. For God is more
glorified, the Kingdom of Christ advanced and enlarged, the good both of
Church and Common wealth with all the members of them, both more furthered and
increased, and our own present comfort and future joys in our heavenly
happiness, much more multiplied and augmented, when by our Christian
conversation and virtuous actions, our holy profession and good example, our
admonitions, exhortations, counsel, consolation; our works of justice,
charity and mercy, and all other good offices mutually performed, we edify and
build up those which are about us, in their most holy faith, and draw many
others to accompany us unto the Kingdom of heaven; then in the strictest
course of a solitary life, to go by our selves alone unto this place of
happiness. And this the Lord has ratified by his Word, when as he said, that
it was not good for man to Genesis 2. 18.
be alone: and two are better then one, because they have a good reward for
their labor, (namely, in that mutual society, and in those good offices of
piety and Christian charity which they perform to one another) for if they
Eccl. 4. 9, 10.
fall, one will lift up his fellow, but woe to him that is alone when he
falls: for he has not another to help him up. And the Apostle lays it as
a charge upon all men, that they should consider and watch over one Heb. 10.
24, 25.
another, to provoke unto love and to good works, not forsaking the assembling
of our selves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another,
etc. The which also is commended unto us by his works both of creation and
renouation; For he has made us in our natures, not like unto wild beasts, who
take their pleasure to lurk alone in their dens, but political and sociable
creatures, who take all their chief joy and and comfort in conuersing with one
another; and so in his wise providence he has disposed of us, that we should
not be absolute, and able to live of our selves, but need the mutual help
one of another, so that the King needs the subject, as much as the subject
the King; the rich the help of the poor, as well as the poor the hire of the
rich; the city the country, as well as the country the city; and so has he
combined and linked all men together into societies, as it were particular
members of the same bodies, and has so furnished them with diversity of gifts
and several abilities unto sundry offices, that no sort of men can be wanting
without a maime, nor any part utterly pulled from the whole, but that he must
necessarily become a dead and unprofitable member, and work his own ruin by
this divulsion and separation. So in our renouation we are as it were anew
created into one body, whereof Christ Jesus is the Head; and as diverse members,
have our several functions and offices allotted unto us, which are not only
for our peculiar use, but for the good of the whole body, and of every other of
our fellow members, as the Apostle excellently shows in his first Epistle to
the Corinthians. So as none are so perfect in themselves, that they need not
their fellows, that there might not be any schism in the body, 1. Cor. 12. 1.
but that the members should have the same care one for another, and that they
Verse. 15. 25, 26.
might both suffer together and rejoice together. Of which sweet society
singular benefits redound to the whole body, and to all the particular members
of it; for they are linked together by the same Spirit, and in the bond of
love, performing all mutual offices of Christian charity which may advance
their good. They communicate in the same blessings, and rejoicing in one
another good, have according to their number their joys redoubled; in their
troubles and afflictions they also communicate in one another grief, every
one comforting his fellovv, and making the burden much more light, by
compassion and fellovv-feeling, and by bearing of it upon many shoulders.
Finally, they stir up Gods graces in one another, both by word and good
example, helping to remove impediments that lie in the way; and exhorting one
another to cheerfulness in their journey, they hasten their speed toward the
Kingdom of heaven.

. Sect. 2 That we must not rashly rush into all companies, but with good choice
and advice; and also with due preparation.
Now if any of these benefits be wanting in societies, or the contrary evils
fall out through this conversation and mutual conuersing one with another, the
fault is not in the things themselves, but in their sinful corruptions, who
pervert them from their first institution, and grossly abuse them to ill ends.
For as it is generally observed, that the more any thing excels in
excellency, the greater is the difficulty in attaining unto it; and the
greatest benefits in temporal things, are most liable unto abuse; so cannot it
be denied, but that it is much more hard to attain unto the right use of
society then of solitariness; and lamentable experience teaches us, that
those who make conscience of their vvayes, and desire to carry themselves in
all places as in Gods presence, do more often forget him and their duty when
they are in company, then when they are alone, and fall into many more errors
and sins, because they have more occasions, and do lie open unto many
tentations of the world, if they do not make the better choice of their
companions, or at least, keep not a strict watch over their words and ways,
that they be not overtaken. In which regard, it is necessary unto this
Treatise of a godly life, that we set down some directions, which may serve
to guide us in our course when we converse with others. And these either
generally respect the duties that concern society with all men, or more
specially those which belong to our own families. The duties that concern
society vvithall, either respect our preparation before we go into company,
or be such as we ought to perfome when we are come into it. The first
general duty in our preparation, is, that we do not rashly rush into all
companies; but seeing there are amongst men many more bad, by whose society
we may be made much worse, then good, by whom we may in our conuersing
with them, receive much fruit and benefit, that therefore before we resort
unto them, we make careful choice of such, as may either in all likelihood
do us good, or at least receive some good from us. And because we are often
mistaken in our choice, not knowing the course and conversation, and much less
the hearts and affections of men, before we have had some trial of them,
therefore it is fit that we pray unto God, that he will direct us in our choice,
and make our meeting and society profitable for the advancing of his glory and
our good. The which is to be understood, when as we are free, and left to the
choice of our companions, and not when they are put upon us, or we upon them,
by some urgent necessity, the duties of our calling, some weighty business or
other unlooked for accident. Secondly, let us pray also unto God, that he will
by his grace and holy Spirit so assist us, as that our meeting and society may
tend to the advancement of his glory, and good one of another. Thirdly, seeing
the enemy of our salvation does in all places lay so many nets and snares to
entrap us, and especially in our company, if it be not well chosen, whereby it
comes to pass, that we are often caught at unawares, and depart away worse
then when we came into it; therefore we must resolve beforehand, that we will
arm our selves against all these dangers, and keep a narrow watch, that we
be not ensnared or overcome of any evil. Fourthly, we must not propound this
as the end of our society, to pass away the time with less tediousness, or
to delight our flesh with carnal pleasure, but go into it with this
resolution, that we will do our best endeavor, either to receive some good
thereby, especially to our souls, by gayning more wisdom and knowledge, or
better our desires and affections, or more power and cheerfulness in the
service of God, and in the performance of all Christian duties; or to do some
good unto those who consort with us, by our words, examples and actions, either
by keeping them from sin when they are ready to fall into it, and pulling
them (as the Apostle Jude speaks) like firebrands out of the fire; Jude verse.
23.
or instructing them that err from the truth, in the right way, or performing
unto them some other Christian duty which may further their salvation, either
as a means of their conversion, whereby they may be Verse. 20.
gained unto Christ, or for their further building in their most holy faith;
the which we are chiefly to intend as an excellent work: for he that
conuerteth Jam. 5. 20.
a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and hide a
multitude of sins, as the Apostle James speaks. And if we be not thus
resolved before we come into company, but rather go with a purpose to fit
our selves to every bodies humor, and rather to please then to profit either
them or our selves (like reeds that will bend with every breath; or writing
tables, which being newly made clean, are fit to receive any impression of
good or evil) it were much better to refrain company and to be alone, seeing
there is more danger of hurt, then hope of being made ere a whit the better.
Finally, we must be no more careful in putting off our rags and old clothes,
and in making our selves handsome, in our outward habit and attire, before we
go into respected company, then in putting off and casting from us turbulent
passions and disorderly affections; and in decking and adorning our selves with
the contrary graces of Gods Spirit. As for example, we must subdue our pride,
which makes all meetings unprofitable, by stirring up heart-burnings and
contention amongst men, either about preeminence and precedence, or when they
are crossed in their proud humors and conceits; so also our wrath and
frowardness of nature, which is provoked with every small occasion, envy
toward superiors, and disdain toward our inferiors. And contrariwise, we
must put on brotherly love, which is the best ornament to fit us for Christian
society, as freeing us from many corruptions which make company unprofitable,
and inabling us unto many duties which are necessary unto it; For charity
suffers long, and is kind, enuieth not, vaunteth not it self, is not puffed
up, does not behave it self unseemly, 1. Cor. 13. 4, 5, 6, 7.
seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil, rejoices not
in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, hops all things,
endures all things. And with it we must put on the Spirit of meekness and
patience, which will enable us to put up injuries, and to pass by offenses,
and to bear with the infirmities of our brethren, till by some good means
they may be amended; the Spirit of humility, which will make us to deny our
selves, our own wills and obstinate conceits, and to think better of the good
parts of our brethren then our own; candidous and ingenuous simplicity,
whereby we are apt to interpret the words and actions of our brethren in the
best sense, and even to season them, if they be somewhat sour or bitter, with
the sweetness of our nature and disposition.

. Sect. 3 That our whole carriage and conversation must be religious, civil
and honest.
And thus we are to prepare our selves before we go into company, if we desire
to profit by it. Now after we are come into it, diverse duties are to be
performed of us; some whereof generally concern our whole conversation, and
some more specially respect our works and words. Generally there is required,
that our carriage and conversation be holy and religious in respect of
spiritual things; and civil and honest in respect of the things of this life.
And first, that chiefly aiming at Gods glory and our own salvation, we
labor by all means to advance them, and shun all occasions in our whole
conversation, whereby they may be any ways impeached and hindered. Secondly,
that we be innocent and unblameable in all our words and actions, and give no
ill example, scandal or offense unto any that keep company with us, but
shine before them in our faith and holy profession, and in the light of a godly
life, that so they seeing our good works, may glorify our heavenly Father,
and by our holy example may be gained unto Christ. So the Apostle exhorts
Matthew. 5. 16.
us to abstain, not only from all evil, but also from all appearance of 1
Pet* 2. 12.
it, propounding himself an example of it unto the Thessalonians for their
imitation. Ye are witnesses, says he, and God also, how holily, and justly,
and 1. These. 2. 10.
unblameably we have behaved our selves among them that believe; for whom he
also prays, that their whole spirit and body might be preserved blameless 1.
These. 5. 22, 23.
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thirdly, we must be just and
righteous in all our conversation, observing truth in our words, and equity in
our actions, giving unto every one their due, and dealing with others as we
would have them to deal with us; which is a main bond of all good society,
and makes it to hold together with peace and comfort. And thus the Apostle
exhorts the Philippians to embrace, whatsoever Phil. 4. 8, 9.
things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report, virtuous and
praiseworthy; and then the God of peace would dwell with them: And tells us,
that they, unto whom the grace of God bringing salvation, has appeared, are
thereby taught not only to live holily toward God, and soberly Tit. 2. 12.
and 1. 8.
toward themselves, but also righteously toward all that converse with them.
Fourthly, we must be fervent in love toward those with whom we consort, which
will make us ready to perform all other duties unto them, according to that of
the Apostle, Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves
another, has fulfilled the Law. Love works no ill to his Romans 13. 8, 10.
Col. 3. 14.
neighbor, etc. And this love will unite us together, for it is the bond of
perfection, or a most perfect bond, which knitteth us together one with
another. Fifthly, As we are of the same company, so we must labor to 1. Pet.
3. 8.
be of the same mind, and to mind the same things, and to be of the Romans 12.
15. Phil. 3. 16.
same affections, rejoicing with them that rejoice, and weeping with them that
weep, and to walk by the same rule, as the Apostle speaks, so far forth
as will stand with truth and justice. For if our bodies be united by society,
our minds and hearts being disioyned and disioynted, we shall be but tied
together like Samsons Foxes by the tails, with firebrands between them; and
looking with our faces a contrary way, shall hinder one another in all good
proceedings. Sixthly, we must not carry our selves proudly toward one another,
nor being wise in our own conceits, mind high things; Romans 12. 16.
for this will make us so stiff in our opinions, that we will not bow unto any
man's judgment, but rather break off all friendship and society about every
trifle, then we will seem to take the least foil. But contrariwise, we must
be of humble minds and meek spirits toward one another, condescending to men
even of low estate, in matters of truth, and things indifferent and of small
weight, or dissenting from them in love, and after a meek and peaceable
manner. Finally, we must be patient and peaceable in all our conversation,
and be much more ready to bear, then offer injuries, according to the Apostles
rule; Recompense unto no man evil for Romans 12. 17, 21.
evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. Be not overcome of
evil, but overcome evil with good. To which end we must (as elsewhere he
exhorts us) Put on (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercies,
kindness, Col. 3. 12, 13.
humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and
forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ
forgave us.

. Sect. 4 How we must carry our selves in the company of those which are
worldly and wicked.
And this ought to be our conversation when we come in company with our
brethren. But what if by accident, or by our necessary occasions, we Mat. 10.
33.
fall into the company of mere worldlings, and such as are irreligious and
profane? Surely we are not to cast off the cloak of our profession, and the
badge and cognizance of virtuous and religious behavior, as though we were
ashamed of our Master; for if we thus deny him before men, he also will deny us
before his Father which is in heaven. And much less ought we to approve and
applaude them in their wicked courses, or because we would not displease them,
and endure their reproaches and disgraceful taunts for our profession and
practice of Religion, countenance their ribauldry, swearing, and profane jests,
with our smiles, or join in the same graceless courses, running together with
them into the same excess of riot, that they may 1. Pet. 4. 4.
not speak evil of us. But so long as we are in their company, we must labor
by all means to reclaim them, and to gain them to Christ; out-countenancing
their leuity and profaneness, by our gravity and piety shining in our words,
countenance, and conversation. And first our care must be, that in all our
carriage we be unblameable, although their malice will not allow us as
commendable. So the Apostle exhorts us to do all good duties without
murmuring and disputings, that we may be blameless and harmless, Phil. 2. 15.
the sons of God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse
nation, among whom we should shine as lights in the world. Herein indeed like
the Sun, which though wicked men may at some times hate, because it
discovers their works of darkness, yet are they so convinced with its
beauty and excellency, that they cannot for shame speak against it. Thus also
he exhorts Titus, to show himself in all things a pattern of good Tit. 2.
7, 8.
works; in doctrine showing vncorruptnesse, gravity, sincerity, sound speech
that cannot be condemned, that he who is of the contrary part, may be ashamed,
having no evil to say of him. And thus the Apostle Peter persuades us, not
only to sanctify the Lord in our hearts, but also to make profession of the
hope that is in us, upon all good occasions; having a good conscience, that 1.
Pet. 3. 15, 16.
whereas they who speak evil of us, as of evil doers, they may be ashamed
that falsely accuse our good conversation in Christ. Secondly, it is not enough
that we be unblameable in our conversation, and without the spots and blemishes
of known sins, but we must also walk worthy our high calling, and adorn Ephesians.
4. 1.
our profession by our practice of holiness and righteousness, that so we
may not only stop their mouths, but also (if it be possible) may be means of
their conversion, when they shall see the light of our holy conversation. So
our Savior requires of us, that our lights should shine so before men, that
they, seeing our good works, may glorify our Father which is in heaven.
Matthew. 5. 16.
And the Apostle Peter exhorts Christians to abstain from fleshly lusts, 1.
Pet. 2. 11, 12.
and to have their conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they
spoke against them as evil doers, they might, by their good works which they
should behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. And though we cannot
bring forth alike fruits of piety, when we are in company with them that will
not join with us in holy exercises, yet at least let us not neglect ciuility
and morality, and as the Apostle speaks, provide things honest in the sight
of Romans 12. 17.
all men. Thirdly, though they will not be reclaimed, neither by our words nor
example, yet we must not for this mingle spleen and choler with our zeal,
but carry our selves in all meekness and mildness, patience and forbearance;
and though we cannot by all our endeavors unite them unto us in the bonds of
love; yet let us by all good means move them to keep the peace, and bind
them to their good behavior whilst they are in our company; assuring our
selves, that if meekness and love joined with strong reasons and good
persuasions, will not prevail with them, then much less will rough words and
chollericke speeches: for here the Apostle James saying is fitly verified; The
wrath of man does not accomplish Iam. 1. 20.
the righteousness of God. And this the Apostle presses with great vehemence;
If it be possible (says he) as much as in you lies, live peaceably with Romans
12. 18.
all men. But yet we must not be so zealous of peace, that we do cowardly
betray the truth, nor for peace sake forgo our own piety; For we must so
follow peace with all men, as that we follow holiness also, without which no
Hab. 12. 14.
man shall see the Lord; or hereby lose any opportunity of furthering our
neighbors salvation. For we must, by the Apostles direction, so follow Romans
14. 19.
after the things which make for peace, as that we by no means neglect the
things whereby one may edify another. And therefore if those with whom we
converse, be not desperate sinners, and more likely to hurt us for our good
will, then to receive any good to themselves by our reproves, we may admonish
and rebuke them in the spirit of meekness and love for their sins, that we
may reclaim them, or at least, if they be such as in Christian prudence we may
not make so bold with them, yet at least, let us show our dislike, when we see
God dishonored by our countenance or some other signs, that we do not
become accessaries to their wickedness. Neither let any man account it
Christian meekness and patience to sit by and say nothing, when Gods holy
Name is profaned, Religion scorned, and the banners of wickedness displayed,
seeing the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, which was so much commended for
patience, had also this praise annexed, that he could not bear with them which
were evil. And Apoc. 2. 2.
therefore it is no patience, when we let men go on in their wickedness, and
give them neither by word nor countenance, any sign of our dislike, but want
of zeal and Christian courage, yea dastardly cowardice and too much love of
the world, which makes us more careful to please men then God himself.
Finally, we must not by such wicked company be out-countenanced in any good,
nor be moved to neglect any Christian duty, which present occasion makes
necessary. For if they be not ashamed to serve the devil by their professed
wickedness; let us not be ashamed to serve our gracious God, by performing such
duties as he requires of us; If they with all boldness glory in their
profaneness; let not us be bashful in the profession and practice of
religious and pious actions: But as the Apostle Paul gave thanks, and blessed
the creatures in the midst Act. 27. 35.
of Infidels, before he would feed on them; so let us with like boldness use
good communication, read the Scriptures, sing Psalms, and perform all other
Christian duties, notwithstanding that profane men be in the company. Seeing
thereby we shall keep a good conscience before God and men, and may, if God
give a blessing to these holy exercises, not only edify those who are alike
minded with us, but also gain them likewise unto us, by our good example, who
are as yet otherwise disposed. By all which good duties if we prevail nothing
at all, our best course will be, as soon as we can, to quit our selves of
such company, and more carefully afterward make choice of better. For
consorting with such companions longer then we need, indangereth us to be
tainted and corrupted with their evil manners: and if we continue with such as
we can by no good means make better, we are in great hazard to be made worse,
as hereafter we shall more fully show.

CAP. XXVIII.
Of Christian conferences, which we must use when we are in company, for our
mutual good.

. Sect. 1 That our speeches must be gracious and prudent.
AND these are the duties which generally concern our whole conversation in
company. The special duties respect either our words and conferences, or our
works and actions; In all our conferences with our brethren we are to observe
two things. First, that our speech be gracious. Secondly, that it be wise and
prudent. Both which are required by the Apostle; Let your speech (says he) be
always with grace, seasoned with salt, that Col. 4. 6.
is, wisely fitted to the time, persons, occasions, and other circumstances,
and uttered prudently in due season. Our speech is gracious, when it sauoureth
of grace and goodness, and appears to proceed from the Spirit of God
dwelling in us, as though he used our tongues to deliver by them that which he
suggesteth and inspireth into us; whereby it becomes gracious and acceptable
in the ears of God and all good men. And unto this there is required, that it
be not only gracious in it self, but also to all that hear us. In it self
it is gracious, when as it is either holy and about spiritual and heavenly
things, points of divinity, and religious matters, our salvation it self, or
the means whereby we may attain unto it; Gods mercies and blessings
multiplied upon us, or his judgments and chastizements inflicted for sin,
and such like; or else when as it is honest and civil, and about the things of
this life, appertaining to our temporal profit, or our comfort and delight.
Our speech is gracious to the hearers, when as it tends to their profit,
either in respect of their souls, or bodies and states. It is profitable for
their souls, when as it is referred to edification, and to the enriching of
them with spiritual grace, and the strengthening and inabling them unto all
Christian and holy duties. Unto which kind of speech the Apostle exhorts;
Let (says he) no corrupt communication Ephesians. 4. 29.
proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for the use of edifying,
that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And again, Comfort your selves
together, and edify one another. The which duty is diversely performed; first,
by instructing those which are ignorant in the knowledge of God and his truth,
that so seeing the way of life and salvation, they may walk in it. In which,
those especially fail, who like rich misers barrel and hoord up the treasures
of knowledge in their own brains, but envying their brethren Dan. 12. 3.
the use of it, will never communicate it in their conferences, nor let any be
the wiser by their speeches that come into their company. Secondly, by
informing erroneous judgments, and reducing them out of their errors into the
way of truth. The which, the Apostle James commends unto us as an excellent
work; Brethren (says he) if any of you do err from the truth, and one
convert him; let him know, that he who conuerteth a sinner from Iam. 5. 19, 20.
the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a
multitude of sins. Thirdly, by giving good counsel unto those that want it,
and prudent advice how they shall carry themselves in all their courses, so as
they may in all particular actions please God, and preserve the peace of a good
conscience. Fourthly, by exhorting and pricking those forward whom we see
sluggish and negligent, and to slacken their pace in the ways of godliness;
according to that of the Apostle; Exhort one another daily, whilst it is
called to day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
Heb. 3. 13.
Fifthly, by comforting those that want consolation, in respect of their
afflictions, temporal or spiritual, inflicted upon their body, mind, or
state. So the Apostle exhorts us to comfort the feeble-minded, and to support
the weak; And again, Comfort your selves together, and edify one another.
And 1. These. 5. 14, 11.
the Prophet Esaias likewise, Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the
Esa. 35. 3. Heb. 12. 12.
feeble knees. The which duty was performed by holy Job, as Eliphaz testifies
of him, Thou have instructed many, and thou have strengthened the weak hands:
Thy words have vpholden him that was falling, and thou have strengthened Job 4.
4, 5.
the feeble knees. And is highly commended by the Prophet as a special Esa.
50. 4.
gift of God; The Lord (says he) has given me the tongue of the learned,
that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.

. Sect. 2 Of Christian admonition, and what is required to the right performing
of this duty.
Sixthly, by admonishing those who are ready to fall, that we may uphold them,
and such as are already fallen through ignorance, frailty, and infirmity, that
we may raise them up again. And this the Apostle requires; Brethren (says
he) if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such
an one in the spirit of meekness, considering thy self, lest thou also be
tempted. Unto which duty that it may be well performed, diverse things are
required. First, wisdom and knowledge in him that admonishes. So the Apostle
says of the Romans; that they were filled with Romans 15. 14.
all knowledge, and able to admonish one another. And first we must know, that
the thing whereof we admonish our brother, be a sin, and not either lawful,
or indifferent and rightly used of him. In which the Israelites failed, when
they sent to admonish the Reubenites about building the Altar, Ios 22. 16.
and Eli in admonishing Anna to put away her drunkenness. Secondly, 1. Sam. 1.
14.
we must know, that being a sin, it is indeed committed by our brother,
either upon that sure notice which our selves have taken, or by the credible
testimony of others who are men of credit; and not when we have a 1. Sam. 2.
22.
blind jealousy or ungrounded suspicion, nor when we have heard it from
busybodies and talebearers, who will not stand unto any thing they say;
unless out of love and tenderness of his credit, we speak of it to this end
chiefly, that he may the better clear himself of these false imputations, or
that we may take occasion to admonish him if we find them true. Thirdly, we
must have knowledge and wisdom to do it after a right manner, with
observation of all due cautions and circumstances. As first, we must make
choice of a seasonable time, not when our brethren are at their feasts, and
desirous to be cheerful and merry; not when they are cast down with
afflictions, the which themselves sufficiently admonish, unless we see that
they make no use of them, nor are brought by them to a sight of their sins;
but rather in their prosperity, when as they thrive in their evil courses. Not
in the company of others, if the fault be secret, and not open and scandalous;
in which case also Christian wisdom will find private admonition best for
many persons, who out of their greatness and natural pride, will burst out
into rage and impatiencie, when as in company we take notice of their faults.
Especially, we must take heed that we do not admonish them of their faults,
before those unto whom they desire chiefly to be approved, and to maintain
their credit; for this will make them either to deny the fault, or to defend
it, or to excuse and extenuate it; or if they can do none of these, to burst
out into choler, as holding themselves to be much disgraced. Neither is
admonition seasonable toward others, when they have begun first to admonish
us, because it will seem to proceed, not from love, but from spleen; not from
any dislike of their faults, but too much liking of our own; not out of a
friendly liberty to do them good by reclaiming them from their sin, but out
of impatiencie to bear reproof, which makes us to return like for like,
because we would have both lie under the same guilt; whereas if we take
admonition well, and perform the like duty at another time to our neighbor,
it will be imputed to the friendly liberty of love, which seeks to reform
the faulty, and not to anger and revenge, which vpbraideth the like faultiness
to countenance our own. Secondly, there is required, that we take fit
occasions to admonish; as when our neighbors, either by their words and
speeches, or their actions and behavior do offer unto us some fit
opportunity; for if it come thus by accident, if finds more easy entrance,
whereas if we seem to come of purpose prepared and armed, it will seem more
harsh to them whom we admonish, and but cause them to prepare also to make
resistance. Or when being sharply taunted for their faults by their enemies,
they are vexed and grieved with their reproaches, then may we take fit occasion
to give them admonition for them, that they may not be liable to such
disgraces; for this will seem to spring out of love, which seeks their
credit, and will move them to take it well, when as we of the poison of other
men's raylings and reuilings, do make an antidote by our friendly admonitions,
to preserve them from taking any hurt from them for the time to come. Thirdly,
we must be careful in admonishing others, that we our selves be not guilty of
the same faults which we task in them, lest they pay us in our own coin,
mete unto us by the same measure, and bring us under the same condemnation. Yea
perhaps we may incur thereby the suspicion Matthew. 7. 1, 2.
of hypocrites, who tell others of their sins to hide our own, or like
subtle thieves, raise a clamor against our neighbors, that we may the
better escape in the Hiew and Cry; or of disliking their person more then their
sin, seeing we nourish the like in our own bosom. Or if Christian love
move us to admonish them in this kind, because such sins bear more sway in
them then in us, being committed by them wilfully and with settled resolution,
by us through frailty, infirmity, and at unawares, seeing they defend them, and
we bewail them, they cherish and nourish them, we condemn and labor to
mortify them; we may, being our selves faulty in this case, admonish others:
but then it is best to prevent their vpbraiding by confessing our own frailty,
and by applying our admonition to our selves together with them, as thereby
seeking our mutual reformation. Fourthly, our admonitions must proceed from
brotherly love, the which being a grace hidden in our hearts, we must make
known by the fruits of it. To which end we must use all lenity, meekness of
spirit, compassion in the sense of the like infirmities in our selves, with
mild and gentle speeches, showing in our hatred of their sin, the love of
their person. And though the party may discern them, yet if we would do any
good, we may not use any insulting speeches, contumelious words, scoffs,
scorns, or biting jests; and howsoever in some cases for lesser faults, or
when we have to deal with a froward nature, we may sweeten our admonition, by
speaking merrily, and in a pleasant manner, yet we must take heed that we
retain our gravity, lest it be turned into a jest, and so lose all its force
and efficacy. But especially we are to take heed that our admonitions do not
appear to have risen out of self-love, and respect to our own particular,
but out of our love of them whom we admonish; for if this be but suspected, it
will never take any place, because we seek not their good, but our own. And
secondly, that they proceed not from anger and choler, which will make it
seem a chiding and brawling, rather then an admonition; and an action of
rauing, rather then of love. In which respect, our admonitions will be the more
powerful, when as they have no reference to our selves, either of profit or
hurt, but rather such as by the faults which we reprove, accrue unto others.
Again, to show our love, we are with the notice which we take of their faults,
to acknowledge their good parts, and to give them due praise for their
well-deseruing. Or if their defects will afford no such occasion, we may
intermixe the virtues of their parents or dear friends; both which will
sweeten our admonition, and serve like sugar to take away the distaste of their
bitterness. Neither must we be always beating upon one string, nor use this
sovereign Salve for every slight scratch; but upon some urgent necessity and
weighty occasion, passing by petty matters of small value, as not seeing them,
or at least reserving them, like little pieces of coin, till they be come to
a sum. For to be still admonishing for every trifle, will make us seem
curious busybodies and harsh censures, to be void of love, which makes us
pass by infirmities, and will cause our company to be tedious and irksome,
and our admonitions by their frequencie unrespected and of no force. Fifthly,
if the parties we admonish be of stout spirits, and are bold enough to bear
it, we may deal plainly and particularly with them for their sins; but if
they have tender foreheads, and are so ingenuously bashful, that they are apt
to be daunted, and put out of countenance, by our taking notice of their
faults; it is Christian wisdom to nourish this modesty and shamefastenesse,
seeing there is no great danger, that such will be hardened in their sins.
And to this end, it is good to admonish them of their faults in other men's
persons, which are alike known unto them, and to let them see the foulness
of their vices, when, like impartial beholders, they take a view of them in
other subjects. The which course also is sometimes good, when it is propounded
by way of Parable in another person, as when we have to deal with our
superiors (as Nathan with David) or such as will not by plain and direct
dealing be so easily convinced of their sins. Again, to cherish ingenuity,
and to preserve men from boldness and impudency, it is not good in our
admonitions to press our reproves too far, but to give them some little
evasion, that they may not turn again as desperate, and fly in our faces.
And therefore we are sometimes to admit of their excuses and extenuations;
yea, sometimes our selves after a charitable manner, to do it for them, giving
the best interpretation we can, either of the matter or manner of their
actions, or their mind in doing them; but in the mean time these extenuations
and excuses must be referred to the person, but not to the sin it self,
which must be mainely beaten down, even whilst we keep the party from
sincking under it. Finally, as with our admonitions we must intermixe loving
and kind speeches; so especially our care must be, that we always make a
friendly conclusion; and not let the admonished depart discontented and
exasperated, but so win him by our kind usage, that (if it be possible) he
may depart, as far in love with our persons, as in hatred of his own sin;
like a Patient cured of some grievous wounds, who loves his skillful and
faithful Chyrurgion, when the cure is perfected, though he complained of his
rough handling him, when he was searching them to the quick. But if when we
have done our best by admonition, we cannot reclaim our neighbors from their
sins, but that they still wilfully commit them, and continue in them without
repentance; then is it our duty, with due respect had to our place and
calling, and also their persons and condition, freely to rebuke and reprove
them. And this the Lord commands as a testimony of our brotherly love; Thou
shall not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou shall in any Leuit. 19. 17.
wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him. And our Savior
Christ requires it as an action that concerns our selves as well as them,
seeing if we neglect it when we have a calling to perform it, we also are
accessory unto their sins. Take heed (says he) to your selves: If thy Luke
17. 3.
brother trespass against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him. But
howsoever here more severity and sharpness is to be used then in our
admonitions, and these old festered sores are to be handled with a rougher
hand, then if they were green wounds, yet we must take heed, that love shine
through these clouds of just anger, that it may appear to the party
reproved, that we intend the cure, and not to hurt the person. To which end
all scolding and brawling, railing and reuiling speeches are utterly to be
avoided, which never do good, but work in them spleen and malice toward
them that use them, rather then any reformation of their faults, or hatred of
their sins.

. Sect. 3 That we may lawfully confer of moral and civil things.
And thus we are in company to frame our speeches upon all occasions, that they
may tend to the spiritual edification of our brethren. But though such
conference in company is to be performed as most excellent, yet may such
speeches have their due place, which concern moral and civil things, about
any subject which may better and improve our knowledge for the service of the
Church or common wealth, or mutual good duties to be performed toward one
another; about the health and welfare of our bodies, or our common affairs
and businesses which we have in the world one with another, and such matters as
concern the good of our estates, of which we may lawfully aduize and take
counsel one of another, for the better directing and managing of all our
actions and endeavors. Yea sometime our speeches and conferences may tend to
honest delight, and to the mutual comfort and refreshing of one another, that
our spirits being cheered and revived, we may be the better fitted for duties
of an higher nature. For howsoever it be lawful sometimes to use speeches
tending to our worldly profit and delight, yet let us carefully take heed,
that we be not (like most men at their meetings) wholly taken up with them,
talking of nothing else but of carnal and earthly things; but seeing God is
the Author and giver of this excellent faculty of speech, let our tongues be
chiefly employed (when we are at our free choice, and not straightened in our
desired liberty by our earthly necessities that press upon us) in such
conferences as tend to Gods glory, and the mutual edification one of another;
that so it may appear that we are pilgrims on earth, and Citizens of heaven,
when as our conversation is about heavenly matters; and that we are free
Burgesses of the new Jerusalem, when as we speak the language of Canaan.

. Sect. 4 That we must carefully avoid all corrupt communication.
Much more let us carefully avoid in our conferences, the speech of Nehem. 13.
23.
Ashdod, which who so uses, professing himself an Israelite, deserves to be
cursed, and that there were some good Nehemiah to smite him with the hand of
Justice, and to pluck off his hair. As all hurtful speech, which tends to
Gods dishonor, swearing, blaspheming, cursing, and such as sauoureth of
irreligion, profaneness and Atheism; or to the destruction of our own and
neighbors souls, for which Christ died; as 1. Cor. 15. 33. Ephesians. 4. 29. Ephesians.
5. 4.
all evil words which corrupt good manners; all filthy communication and
rotten speech, which infecteth and poysoneth the hearers; all scurrility,
unsavory and obscene jests; all scoffs and bitter frumps, scornful taunts
and spiteful jests, impeaching the credit and reputation of our neighbors,
which proceed, for the most part, from an affectation of the praise of wit,
and so far bewitch men, that they are ready (as we say) to lose their friend
rather then their jest, and so foolishly to exchange a precious jewel, for a
trifling babble. And hereunto we may add all speeches directly contrary unto
those that tend to edification; as such as tend to the corrupting of the
judgment of our neighbors, and to the leading of them into error, evil
counsel, and all such as discourage them in the ways of Godliness. Such as
grieve the afflicted spirit, and make him to sink under his burden; such as
encourage men unto sin, and countenance those, who are fearful and
bashful, in wicked courses, or which hinder those that are fallen, from rising
again, and turning unto God by true repentance. And as we are to avoid in
all our conferences these hurtful and pernicious speeches, so also such as are
vain and unprofitable, as not attaining unto our chief ends, the glory of
God, and our own and our neighbors good; in which notwithstanding the most men
spend their time, and as the Psalmist complains, speak vanity every one
Psalm. 12 2.
with his neighbor; thinking themselves sufficiently excused, because they say
no hurt. But such forget in the mean time, that the Wise man prays against
this vanity, that the Apostle does forbid and condemn it; and Pro. 30 8. Tit
3. 9.
that our Savior Christ at the day of Judgment will call into account Matthew.
12. 36.
not only such speeches as are hurtful, but such also as are idle and
unprofitable.

CAP. XXIX.
Of Christian prudence, which we ought to use in all our conferences.

. Sect. 1 How we must carry ourselves when we confer with those who excel
us in gifts.
ANd thus we have spoken of graciousnesse of speech to be used in our
conferences, and of the contrary corruptions which ought to be shunned. The
next duty required, is, that our speeches be powdered with the salt of
Christian wisdom and prudence, which not only enableth us to speak good
things, but also to fit these speeches to the persons with whom we confer, to
occasions and opportunities, to the present purpose, use and necessity, so as
they may be most seasonable, powerful and effectual for the furthering of our
own good, and theirs also that bear us company. And this the Apostle
understands, when as he requires, that our speech should be always
gracious, and seasoned with salt, that we may know how Col. 4. 6.
to answer every man, for their special use and benefit. This is that fit and
seasonable speech which the Wise man compares to apples of gold, in Pro. 25 11.
pictures of silver; and this is, to have the tongue of the learned, when as
we know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary. And when as we
Esa. 50. 4. Eccl. 12. 10.
can fit our speeches to present occasions, and so apply them to every sort and
condition of men, as that they may be behoouefull and beneficial to them all
in their several kinds. As for example, when we confer with such as excel
us in grace and piety, wisdom and knowledge, we must, reuerencing Gods graces
and greater gifts in them, yield unto them priority of speech, and attentively
harken unto those gracious words which proceed out of their mouths; not
spending of our small stock which cannot enrich them, but laying up their
speeches as good treasures in our hearts, that we may increase our spiritual
store, which we may afterward lay out when we come among those that have
more need. And unto this the wise Solomon advises us, Bow down thine ear
(says he) Pro. 22. 17, 18.
and hear the words of the Wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. For
it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee, they shall withal be
fitted in thy lips. And again; Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children,
and attend Pro. 7. 24. and. 8. 6.
unto the words of my mouth. Hear: for I will speak excellent things, and the
opening of my lips shall be right things. And here the Apostle James his rule
is especially to be observed; Let every man be swift to hear, and slow Iam.
1. 19.
to speak. For the words of the Wise are of great use and profit, power
Eccles. 12 11.
and efficacy, like goads pricking men forward in the ways of Godliness, and
like nails fastening and confirming their hearts in all virtuous courses. In
which regard if we interrupt them in their holy and wise speeches, by
interposing our unseasonable and less profitable talk, we shall, by
disturbing their discourse, wrong our selves and the rest of the company; and
be more foolish then the foolish virgins, who did not Matthew. 25.
desire to put out and extinguish the lights of the wise, but that they might
share and communicate with them. And therefore when we come into such
company, let us think that we are in a rich and plentiful market, wherein
we may store our selves with what we want. In which respect let us wholly
intend to enrich our hearts with all needful graces, by trading with these
rich Merchants who abound in them; and labor by communicating with them in
these holy conferences, to increase our knowledge, strengthen our faith,
confirm our affiance, nourish our hopes, mortify our corruptions, and to be
more and more enabled to new obedience and holiness of life. On the other
side, when we are in the company of those which are weak and inferior unto us
in knowledge and other of Gods graces, we must be as ready to speak unto
their instruction and edification, as to hear those which are superior unto
us. And as those who are of mean estate, may lawfully desire and receive gifts
from the rich, that they may impart them unto those who are poorer then
themselves, so must we also do in our spiritual trading one with another.
Which we need not grudge to do, seeing we shall not lose by their gain,
but mutually thrive together, not much less increasing our own knowledge and
other graces, by teaching and communicating them, then they by learning and
receiving; these spiritual gifts herein resembling the Widows Cruze of Oil
which filled in emptying, and when much was taken out of it for the relief of
the whole family, afforded no less store the next meal, or like the milk in
the mothers breast, which if it be sucked by the child, continues and
increases, but if it be not drawn, soon fails and dries up. Neither must
we in this case be so proud and lofty in our own conceits, as to scorn or
refuse conference with those who are not equal with us in gifts, but as the
Apostle exhorts, we must condescend unto men of lowestate, and stoop unto
the understanding of the meanest, Romans 12. 16.
thinking it as necessary an office in Gods family, to put milk into the
mouths of little babes, as to set stronger meat before those that are able
John 21. 15.
to sit at the table with us and feed themselves. Unto the performance of
which duty, Christian wisdom and discretion is very necessary, to give unto
every one a fit portion as they are able to bear; and not to glut and ouercloy
weak stomachs with these spiritual dainties, till, like the Israelites
Quails, they come out of their nostrils. For if they surfeit through saciety,
and be crammed till it be ready to come up again, they shall for the present
offend God thereby, and loath this Spiritual food for the time to come. And
therefore when we meet with weakelings, let us have respect unto them, and
not so much consider what we could willingly give, as what their weak
stomachs are able to digest; intermixing (as it were sawces to their meat)
civil, moral and pleasant speeches tending to their profit or delight, that
thereby, their appetite being quickened, they may feed upon more solid and
wholesome nourishment with less saciety.

. Sect. 2 How we must behave our selves when we conferte with civil worldlings.
Again, if those with whom we confer are but mere worldlings, we must
wisely consider whether they be morally civil, or openly profane and
desperately wicked. If they be of the former sort, we must cherish those common
gifts and graces of the Spirit, which we observe in them, yet so, as we do our
best to work them out of a Pharisaicall conceit of them, as though they needed
no more to assure them of their salvation. To which purpose we are to take all
good occasions to show their insufficiency, that being beaten off from this
pernicious opinion, they may deny themselves utterly, and all their own
righteousness in the work of their justification and salvation, and may fly
unto Christ by faith, who is only able and all-sufficient to effect them. With
which we must join all other good means, which opportunity shall offer unto
us for the gayning of them to Christ, and making of them truly religious. And
to this end we must heedfully watch for all good occasions, which either their
words or actions shall offer unto us, of speaking something which may be for
the use of edifying; liking and approving any thing which is well said or done
by them (as our Savior dealt with the young man that answered him discreetly)
showing that they are not far from the Kingdom of God; and as Paul with King
Agrippa, who watched and Act. 26. 28, 29.
took hold upon every word which he spoke, to draw him to Christianity. Yea
when none are offered by them of speaking any good, we must seek out
occasions our selves, making choice of such as we think will be most
plausible, and likely to find entertainment, as some works, mercies, or
Judgments of God, which are fresh in memory. And if the company be such, as
that we cannot directly propound unto them such sauourie discourse, let us use
our best art and policy to screw and wind it in by degrees and by little and
little; endeavoring to drive in our wedges into these knottie pieces with many
blows and diverse breathings and intermissions, when as we are not able to do
it once. Or if we cannot prevail thus far, nor draw them to join with us in
any Christian conference, yet at least let us join with them in their speeches
and discourses, which are most civil and morally honest, that if we can do
them no further good, yet at least we may hereby prevent rotten, filthy, and
unsavory speech, and so preserve our own ears from being polluted, and our
hearts from being grieved with such ribauldry and corrupt communication, as is
often vented in such societies.

. Sect. 3 How we must deal with those who are openly profane.
But if our company into which we are come, either by accident or some urgent
occasion, be notoriously profane and wicked, who would but Matthew. 7. 6.
make a scoff at any speech which sauoureth of Religion; our Savior has
given us this rule for our direction, that we must not cast holy things before
dogs, nor pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and
turning again, all to rent us. Unto which the Wise man has adjoined another,
that we must get our selves out of such company as soon as we can: Go (says
he) from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceiuest Pro. 14. 7.
not in him the lips of knowledge. In the mean time, though we have some
society with them, in respect of our persons, yet let us be careful that we
have no fellowship with their unfruitful works of darkness, by too much
familiarity, applauding their speeches, and blaunching over their vices and
faults; but if we cannot without danger take liberty of reproving them by
direct words, yet let us do it by showing dislike, either by our silence or by
our countenance. At least let us give them a real reproof by our contrary
example, being (as the Apostle speaks) blameless and Phil. 2. 15.
harmless, the sons of God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
perverse nation, and shining among them as lights in the world. But if they be
so peaceable, that we may conceive any hope of their patience, and that they
will hearken unto any good speech, loving admonition, or gentle reproof, we
must not neglect it, handling these festred sores with a soft hand, that so
they may more quietly endure to have afterward salues applied which shall be fit
for their curing. Neither will it stand with Christian charity to neglect any
means, when there is the least hope of doing the^ good, nor with Christian
wisdom to do it after a rough and boystrous manner, proudly and imperiously,
with sharp rebukes and bitter reproves, which like strong medicines in a
weak stomach and clogged with corrupt humors, will not stay with them, but
will presently be cast up again, before they have had any time to work, and so
do them no good for their spiritual cure. But we must use first prepartiues
and gentle purges, as they are able to bear: as loving insinuations, and mild
admonitions, which must always savor more of the strength of argument and
reason, then of choler or any other turbulent passion. And though when we
have done all the good we can, we do not presently see any fruit of our
labors, yet must we not be discouraged, but patiently leave the success
unto God, and crave his blessing upon our endeavors, knowing that the best
seed comes not up as soon as it is sown; and the physic which cures the
disease, does not as soon as it is taken, give any evidence of the patients
recovery, yea oftentimes makes him much more sick, whilst it is in working;
both to the judgment of others, and in his own feeling and apprehension. Yea,
though they cast up this spiritual Physic presently after it is taken, yet
may it do them some good, seeing some hurtful humors may be raised with it,
as some cold phlegm of sluggish sloth and careless security, and some hot
choler, which so imbittered their stomachs, that they had no appetite to any
wholesome nourishment; and something also may remain behind, which will work
upon them when we least think of it.

. Sect. 4 Of the manifold and dangerous abuses of Conferences in these days;
and the causes of them.
And these are the duties which are to be observed in our society and
conversation one with another, in respect of our speeches and conferences. The
which in these days, are all for the most part lamentably neglected, to the
great dishonor of God, and our own exceeding hindrance in our Christian
progress. And contrariwise, as we find by daily and woeful experience, all
our time at our meetings, is wholly spent about earthly trifles, and things of
no value. Of which neglect of the one, and too much use of the other, there are
diverse causes. As first, the malice and subtilty of the devil, who knowing how
much religious conferences do weaken his kingdom, and build us up in all
spiritual graces, and how much they strengthen us unto all Christian duties,
does use all his Art and skill to hinder and interrupt them, by putting into
men's minds matters of no use and profit, earthly vanities, and things utterly
impertinent to our persons, states, and callings. Or if we will needs talk of
Religion, he is ready to propound unto us by some of his instruments, captious
questions, or wrangling controversies about trifles of no value, which tend not
to the use of edifying, but to cause heart-burning, and alienation of
affections, strife, and contention, that so for the present he may keep out
all profitable conferences, about sanctification and the maine points of
Christian Religion, and at length may break off all such meetings, when as men
find by experience, that little or no good comes of them. And with him
joins the world and worldly men to hinder these conferences, not only by
offering earthly things unto us, for the subject of our speech, but also by
interrupting us, when we have entered into any good conference, by speaking of
worldly matters, that so they may divert our speech from going on in any
Christian discourse. Unto both which our enemies, our corrupt flesh is ready to
betray us, which is soon weary of spiritual and heavenly things, because it
finds no taste or savor in them, and is never satisfied in thinking and
speaking of things worldly, carnal, and sensual, as best rellishing to our
corrupt and fleshly appetite. A second cause is, because we are not mortified
in our love to the world, nor have our hearts and affections weaned from it.
For if they, like good instruments, were well in tune, they would utter by our
tongues heavenly harmony; but doting as they do upon worldly vanities, it is
no marvel, if out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, and if
the chief fountain being defiled, there issue from it the polluted streams
of unprofitable discourses. A third cause, is our too little love of spiritual
and heavenly things; for if our hearts were set upon them, as our chief
treasure, we would take delight to be still talking of them. If they were our
chief comforts and cordials to cheer our hearts, so as they could with
delight exercise themselves (with David) in meditating on them day and night;
then would they also be sweeter to our mouths, then the honey or the
honey-combe. Neither Psalm. 119.
would our tongues be so unready and barren of words, when we come to speak of
holy things, if our hearts and affections were set upon them; for as the Divine
Philosopher among the Heathens observed, Love makes even those which are rude
of speech eloquent, when they speak of the things beloved. Lastly, our great
ignorance of holy and heavenly matters, joined with a pernicious fear and
shame, lest by our speech we should discover it to our disgrace, is one
special cause which hinders these conferences. For such is the pride of men's
hearts, and their small esteem of these spiritual treasures, that they had
rather remain penurious, then discover their poverty; and empty of all grace,
by neglecting the means whereby they might be replenished, then that men
should take any notice of their emptiness; to hide their wounds, rather then
to lay them open that they might be cured; and like foolish and beggarly
Shopkeepers, they content themselves with a vain show, and with painted
papers stuffed with straw or rags, rather then they will use any spiritual
trading with others, or lose the name and opinion of wealthy men, by taking up
such wares as they want.

. Sect. 5 That Christian and religious conferences are exceeding profitable.
But that we may break through all these difficulties, and remoouing these
causes of hindrance, bring these neglected holy conferences into more use, let
us consider that they are exceeding profitable, first, for the increasing of
our knowledge in spiritual and heavenly things, when we bring all we know
(as it were) to a common stock, out of which, every one may take that which
best fitteth him for his particular use, and supply his defects out of others
abundance, they in the mean time having never the less. And as it is a
singular benefit unto every one of any Trade or Mystery, when they have their
common Halls where they may meet together, and confer of the best courses
for the managing of their affairs, seeing it does not only much improoue
their skill, but also further them greatly in all good proceedings; so does it
exceedingly advantage us in our spiritual trading, both for the increasing of
our knowledge, and furthering of our practice, when as we often meet
together, and confer of those things that belong to our Christian profession.
For it does not only improoue and better our judgments, by communicating with
others in all that they know, but also inflame our hearts and affections with
the love of spiritual things, when as we stir up Gods graces mutually in one
another, and like coals which are heaped up together, not only preserve the
heat of the love, and zeal which is kindled in us, and would cool and die if
we were scattered from one another, but also inflame those which are next unto
us with our heat, which being set on fire, will also kindle those who are
near unto them. In which regard, that of the Wise man is truly verified; The
lips of the righteous feed many; but Pro. 10. 21.
fools (who refuse all communion and fellowship with them) die and perish for
want of wisdom. And as it is a singular means to inlighten our minds with
the knowledge of the truth, and to inflame our hearts with the love of it; so
also to make use of all we know and affect by our holy practice, when as by
our mutual exhortations, we encourage and stir up one another unto new
obedience, and to perform all good duties of a Christian life, and help both
our selves and others, with such good counsels and directions, which being
observed, will make the ways of holiness and righteousness easy, familiar,
and pleasant unto us. Add heereunto the great necessity of these religious
conferences, and of what great moment the use or neglect of them is for our
salvation or damnation. Neither are we with the common sort to esteem words
as wind, or if we do, such a wind as will bring great profit, or hurt;
either much furthering us toward the Haven of happiness, or like a
tempestuous storm, blowing us upon the rocks of perdition. For the Wise man
says, A man's belly shall Pro. 18. 20, 21.
be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth, and with the increase of his lips
shall he be filled. Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they
that love it, shall eat the fruit thereof. And as he expounds himself in
another place; A Pro. 13. 2.
man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth, namely, if his tongue utters
good things, but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence. And our
Savior has taught us, that we shall be called to account for every idle word
Mat. 12 36, 37.
at the day of Judgment, and that by our words we shall be justified, and by
our words we shall be condemned. Finally, let us remember how faithful in this
kind the wicked are in the devils service, being never weary in uttering such
speeches as are vain and unprofitable, or hurtful and pernicious; and let
this make us ashamed of our negligence, if we seldom admit such holy
conferences as tend to Gods glory, whom we have found so gracious and
bountiful a Master, or being entered into them, do wax weary, and soon give
them over, upon every slight occasion, for want of love and zeal to his
service. Yea, let us consider with what pleasure and delight our selves have
been taken up in the days of our ignorance, with idle and hurtful
communication, and let this make us to redeem our lost time, by being diligent
and frequent in good conferences; and seeing wicked men are, and we were, not
ashamed to spend much time, in speaking to Gods dishonor, and our own and our
neighbors hurt; let it now be a shame unto us to be backward and bashful,
slack and meale-mouthed, to speak freely unto his praise, or to omit any good
occasion of discourse, which may further the salvation of our selves or our
brethren.

CAP. XXX.
Of those duties which concern our works and actions one with another, both
out of contracts, and in our buying and selling.

. Sect. 1 That we must labor both to do and receive all the good we can, in
our dealings with others.
AND thus much concerning those duties which are to be performed in our society
and conversation, respecting our speeches and conferences. Now we are to speak
of those which concern our works and actions. And these either respect our
simple and ordinary dealings out of contract, or those which are to be
observed in contracts and bargains one with another. Concerning the former, I
shall not need to say much more then I have written before of those duties,
which are generally to be performed in our whole conversation and society with
our neighbors. Only let us observe this principal rule, that when we come in
any company with our brethren, we endeavor by all good means, both to
receive, and do all the good we can unto our selves and them, improouing our
society for the best advantage to all parties. And first for our selves, we
must not idly and vainly spend our time, when we are in company, but labor as
much as in us lies, to reap what fruit and benefit we can by it, setting our
selves to listen unto, and lay up for our use the good speeches, instructions,
counsels, exhortations, admonitions or reproves, which we shall hear from
any, and those especially which are superior unto us in Gods gifts and graces;
as also to take notice of those good examples of piety or Justice, faith,
affiance in God, humility, meekness, patience, and such other virtues, that
they may serve as patterns for our imitation; according to that of the
Apostle; Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so
as ye have us for an example; and elsewhere he exhorts the Hebrews Phil. 3.
17.
to follow the faith of those who were set over them, and had spoken unto them
the Word of God. But because such rules through humane frailty Heb. 13 7.
do sometime fail, we are not hand over head to conform our selves to such
ensamples, but in any doubtful case to bring them to the maine Standard, the
Word of God, and to consider, if they agree or swerve from it; and to our
chief Pattern and Precedent Jesus Christ, to see how their example agrees
with his; seeing the Apostle, though excellently graced, would not propound
himself as an absolute pattern to be followed in all things; but only so
far forth as he was a follower of Christ. 1. Cor. 11. 1.


. Sect. 2 That we must take all occasions of gayning others to Christ.
And as we must labor when we are in company to receive, so also to do what
good we can unto those who associate us. Especially, we must endeavor to take
and seek all good occasions and opportunities, of speaking or doing any thing
which may further their salvation, and to use all good means, both to gain
them unto Christ, if we see no signs of their conversion; or to build them up
in him, to enrich them with all spiritual graces, and to confirm and
strengthen them unto all Christian duties, if being converted, they belong to
the same household of faith. Of the former, we have the Apostle Paul a worthy
example for our imitation, who though 1. Cor. 9. 19. to 22.
(as he professes) he were free from all men, yet he made himself servant
unto all, that he might gain the more. To the Jews he became a Jew, that he
might gain the Jews (that is, as he expounds himself in the next words) to
them that were under the Law, as under the Law, that he might gain them that
were under the Law; to them which were without Law, as without Law (though he
were not without Law to God, but under the Law to Christ) that he might gain
them that were without Law. To the weak he became as weak, that he might
gain the weak; and in a word, made himself all things to all men, that he
might by all means save some. And in the next Chapter he says, that he
endeavored to please all men in all things, not seeking his own profit, but
the profit 1. Cor. 11. 33.
of many, that they might be saved. In respect of our brethren, which are
already converted, we must, when we keep them company, perform all Christian
duties which may enrich, or confirm and strengthen in them all the gifts and
graces of Gods holy Spirit. To which end, we must observe and watch over one
another, not as curious busybodies, to intermeddle with their affairs, which
belong not unto us, or to spy out their infirmities, that we may blaze them
abroad to others; but seeing their weaknesses, that we may help and support
them and their wants, that we may use all good means to supply them, and in
the mean time, to cover them under the veil of charity. And finally, that we
may provoke and stir up one another, to the embracing of all holy virtues,
and the practicing of all Christian duties, according to that of the Apostle,
Let us consider one another, Heb. 10. 24.
to provoke unto love and good works.

. Sect. 3 That in all our dealings and bargainings we must carry our selves
uprightly and honestly.
In our contracts and bargains, whereby we alienate or exchange the things
which of right appertain unto us upon some equal and honest conditions,
diverse duties are to be observed of all Christians, who have trading and
dealings one with another, some whereof are general to all contracts, and some
more specially respect selling and buying. In all our contracts and dealings,
there is generally required, that we carry and behave our selves simply and
uprightly, honestly, and with a good conscience, as in the sight and presence
of God, who sees not only our outward actions and dealings, but also the
inward thoughts of our hearts, and our most secret and hidden intentions,
according to that of the Apostle, We trust we have a good conscience in all
things, willing to live honestly. And Heb. 13. 18.
contrariwise in all our contracts, we must carefully shun and avoid all
guile and deceit, all hollow and double dealing, tending to the undermining
Micah 7. 2.
and circumuenting of our neighbors. So the Apostle exhorts, that no man go
beyond or defraud his brother in any matter, because the Lord 1. These. 4. 6.
is the auenger of all such; for as the Psalmist says, he abhors the
deceitful Psalm. 5. 6.
and blood thirsty man. More especially we must in all our dealings observe
truth in all our words, and not only speak it from our lips, but also from
Zach. 8. 16. Psalm. 15. 2.
our hearts, hating and avoiding all subtle equivocations, and mental
reseruations, as tending to circumuent and deceive those with whom we deal.
Secondly, fidelity in all our promises, performing them, although it be to
Verse. 4.
our own hindrance, unless he to whom they are made does release us of them.
Thirdly, justice in all our actions, giving every man his due, and dealing with
others, as we would have them to deal with us. Fourthly, charity and
compassion in remitting our right in whole or in part, when as the bargain
proves hard, and to the great loss and hinderance of our poor neighbors,
who are not able to bear it. And lastly, patience and contentedness, when we
sustain any damage and detriment, or be otherwise crossed or ouer-reached in
any of our contracts, either purposely by those with whom we deal, or by some
casualty or accident which could not be foreseen. Contrariwise in all our
contracts we must avoid lying, and that which is equal unto it, equivocation;
For the getting of treasures by Pro. 21. 6.
a lying tongue, is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. And
again, Wealth gotten by vanity, shall be diminished: but he that gathers by
labor, Pro. 13. 11.
shall increase; yea though a man could by lying, get the whole world, what
would this profit him, seeing thereby he shall lose his own soul? For liars
shall not only be excluded out of the Kingdom of heaven, but also have their
portion in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the Apoc.
22. 15. and 21. 8.
second death. With like care we must avoid in our dealings all
perfidiousnesse and breach of promise, although it tend to our great advantage,
seeing God will not bless goods gotten by breach of covenants, and though we
should thrive by such courses, our worldly gain will in no sort recompense our
spiritual loss. We must shun also all kind of injustice in our contracts,
seeing though it bring in present gain, yet no profit in the end; For the
treasures of wickedness profit nothing; but righteousness delivers Pro. 10.
2.
from death. Likewise we must avoid all uncharitableness, raising our gain
out of our neighbors loss, but as fellow members of the same body, we must
advance, as much as in us lies, our mutual profit, and in some equality
thrive together. Finally, we must not, through impatiency, murmr and repine,
fret and fume, when we meet with any crosses or losses in our contracts, but
be content sometime to lose as well as gain; and to this end we must not have
our eyes too much fastened upon secondary causes and inferior means, which
perhaps are exceeding cross and faulty, but lift them above the earth, and
fix them upon the most wise providence of our good and gracious God, who
governs all things which seem most contingent and casual, and so disposes
of them, as is most for his own glory, and the spiritual good and everlasting
salvation of all those that love and depend upon him.

. Sect. 4 That we must sell only things saleable.
More especially, there are diverse duties required of us in our buying and
selling. As first, that the seller be the true and lawful owner of that he
sells, or his deputy appointed by him; and that the buyer do not for private
gain buy any thing from any man, whom he thinks not to have any right to
sell it. In which respect, they grievously offend, who buy or sell stolen goods
if they know of it, and they who sacrilegiously sell and buy the livings of the
Church, and such things as are freely consecrated to the service of God.
Secondly, the seller ought to sell, and the buyer to buy such things only as
are vendible, and may justly be bought and sold. In which regard, they offend,
who sell or buy the gifts of the Spirit, as Simon Magus, or holy things which
belong to God; and those who sell and buy Justice or injustice by bribery given
or taken, either to fill their own purses, Amos 2. 6. Esa. 5. 23. Esa. 1. 23.
or to pervert right. They also who sell and buy truth and lies, as false
witnesses, and they that hire them to give false testimony. But they most of
all, who for corruptible things sell their souls unto sin, as Achab did,
which Christ redeemed with his most precious blood. Thirdly, we ought to sell
only such things as are fit for sale, or knowing them to be otherwise, to
acquaint the buyer with it, and so to pitch a lower price, according to their
lesser value. Otherwise we are not to sell things falsified in respect of
their substance, and such as are mixed and corrupt, for such as are pure and
good, which is a common fault among Merchants and Tradesmen in these days, who
for their greater gain adulterate their wares, and iumble and intermingle
things of a different degree in goodness, selling them all at the best rates.
Fourthly, we are bound to sell those things only which are some way profitable
for the Church and Commonwealth, either for necessary use, or for ornament and
delight. Neither ought we to benefit our selves by such things as are
unprofitable unto others, and much less by such as are in their own nature
hurtful and pernicious, uncharitably raising our own gain out of our
neighbors loss. As those that sell popish pardons, and books, to ignorant
people, who are likely to be seduced by them, such also as further them in
their superstition and idolatry, obscene pictures and books full of ribaldry
and all profaneness, fit for nothing but to poison and corrupt such as see
and read them.

. Sect. 5 That we must set and sell our wares at an equal price.
Fifthly, we ought in selling and buying, to set our wares at an equal price;
the best rule whereof for the most part is the ordinary price of the market,
which valueth things not simply in their own worth, but with consideration of
all circumstances, as scarcity, plenty, time and place; and not according to
the price we gave less or more, nor only respecting whether we gain much or
little, whether we get nothing or lose thereby. For as of necessity, through
the change of prices, we must sometimes lose, so it is alike necessary, that we
should gain at another time, to repair these losses, and maintain our state.
And as we must not, when we have an ill bargain, exceed the market, and so
transfer our loss from our selves upon our neighbor, but patiently bear
our own cross as imposed of God, till he afford us lawful means to free us
of it; so when we have made a good bargain in respect of the difference of
places or times, we may not, unless we would be uncharitable unto our
selves, put off our gain to others, but receive it thankefully as the blessing
of God upon our labors. But here we must take heed, first, that we be not
over strict in this kind, seeking only our own gain and advantage, without
respect to the Common wealth, nor uncharitable toward the poor, in joining
with others to keep up things in times of scarcity at the highest prices. But
when we can afford it, we ought to abate something, and by our example to
bring down others to reasonable rates, all circumstances being considered,
that neither the Common wealth generally, nor the poor in particular receive
by our being just overmuch, any hurt or damage. Secondly, Eccle. 7. 16.
we must take heed that we use no unjust or uncharitable courses to raise the
markets, and the prices of commodities above their value; as to forestall the
market, and to buy up the things which are brought, at low rates, with a
purpose to set them up, and sell them dearer soon after in the same place. Or
to ingrosse commodities which are offered to common sale, that having them all
in our hands, we may sell them at our own rates. In which respect they
chiefly offend, who, upon no lawful and necessary cause, do abuse authority
to countenance their Monopolies (I need not to expound it, seeing custom has
made this Greek word familiar English) and get the sale of several
commodities appropriated unto themselves, so as none may sell them but by
benefit of their privilege, that so they may value them above their worth, and
enrich themselves with the loss and damage of the Common wealth. Neither must
we (as it is the usual fault of Companies and Corporations) combine our selves
together to sell our wares at a certain rate; nor keep in our commodities in
time of plenty, to this end that we may cause a dearth; seeing by defrauding
Pro. 11. 26.
the people of Gods blessings, we shall be exposed to their curse, as the Wise
man teaches us. And as the seller ought not to vent his wares above their
worth; so neither should the buyer desire to have them under, if at least he
know that the seller cannot so afford them; especially when he has to deal
with the poor, whose necessities oftentimes constrain them to take, not what
their wares are worth, but what they can get for them. In which respect, many
shopkeepers in Cities and towns grievously offend, which take advantage of
their poverty who work for them, shamefully to oppress them, forcing them to
sell their tears, sighs and groans with their wares, because wanting bread
to put into their own and their childrens mouths, they will not buy them off
their hands, not because they are unwilling to have them, but because by these
refusals they would beat them down to vile prices, and such rates, that their
curious skill and painful labor in their art and trade, will scarce yield
them so much as will, after the homelyest manner, feed and cloth them:
whilst the other, who come further behind them in art, skill and
profitablenesse to the Common wealth then they, go before them in stock and
riches, selling with their wares their wind and words, and doubling their
price with their lies and oaths, abound in all superfluous excess, and yet
exceedingly grow in wealth.

. Sect. 6 That in buying and selling all fraud and deceit must be avoided.
Lastly, in respect of the manner of selling and buying, we ought to use
honest simplicity, and carefully to avoid all fraud and deceit. In which
respect, men grievously offend in these days, who have and use a thousand
devices to circumuent and defraud their neighbors. As first, by blinding their
minds with their partial and false praises of their wares, and their eyes
with false and deceitful lights. By concealing the known faults of their
wares, and yet coveting to get the highest prices, as if they were faultlesse.
By asking for them a double price to their value, and taking it also, if the
party be so simple to give it. By abusing their acquaintance and customers
under color of love and friendship, and selling their wares dearer unto them,
then a mere stranger could buy them. By telling untruths, either about the
worth of their commodities, or the price which they cost them, or the money
that they have been offered, or that which they will take, and not under, and
(that which is worse, though this be too too bad among Christians) by
countenancing and confirming their lies with intermingled oaths. Unto these,
innumerable other faults might be added, common in these days amongst
Tradesmen, which I will only name, because it is not my purpose to rake up
these filthy puddles to the bottom, but only to point at the grossest of them
with my finger as I passed by, that the conscionable Christian, who desires to
please God in all his courses, may shun and avoid them. As first, they offend
in their manner of selling, who sell one thing for another, and when they meet
with those, who being simple and ignorant, are apt to be abused, do thus
deceive them both in the colors and stuffes. So they also, who sell that which
is mixed, for that which is pure; that which is sophisticate and naught, for
that which is perfect and good; that which is bad, for the middle sort; and
that which is mean and indifferent, for the best. They in like manner who set
false glosses on their wares, by gumming, starching, pressing, and burning, and
so to cause them to seem much better then they are, make them much worse for
use. Finally, they who use false waights and measures, buying by a greater, and
selling by a lesser; and such also as by their Art and skill increase the
weight and measure of their wares in show, above that which they are in truth;
as by false fingring, stretching, ouer-measuring, deceitful ballancing; making
by their nimble tricks, the equal Scales to forget and lose their
indifferency, and inclining on their side, to become accessory to their fraud.
The buyer also ought no less carefully and conscionably to observe truth and
justice in cheapning and buying his commodities then the seller, both offering
an equal price to the worth of the wares according to his judgment, and
truly paying it when they are agreed. In which respect they offend, who, to
bring down the price under the true value, dispraise and disgrace the wares,
before they have bought them, which after they are gone, they are ready to
commend as a good pennyworth; The which Solomon observed as a fault in his
times: It is naught, it is naught, says the buyer, and when he is gone away,
Pro. 20. 14.
then he boasts of his bargain. So those who offer much under that just
value of the wares, which their own judgment does set upon them, whereby the
seller is driven to ask much above, that so he falling as the other rises,
(like the Scales, which interchangeably tossing up and down, stand at last in
their due equipoyse) he may bring the price to some indifferency; all which
vaine-spent time and labor might well have been saved, many idle words
spared, and diverse abuses shunned and avoided, if on both sides they had used
Christian simplicity. Finally, the buyer much offends, when having agreed
upon the price, and coming to pay it, he gives not unto the seller his full
due, but either wittingly misreckoneth him in the sum, or tendreth unto him,
in stead of current and lawful money, slippes, and base coin, vvashed,
clipped, and light gold, or pieces of less value, oftentimes for those of
greater, which through ouer-sight, by reason of their likeness, may very
easily be mistaken the one for the other.

. Sect. 7 How to avoid the faults commonly committed between buyers and
sellers.
All which faults among buyers and sellers, which so intolerably reign in
these times, would easily be avoided; if, as we profess, we would prefer
Justice and charity before deceit and self-love, and accordingly would labor
to mortify the one as hurtful and pernicious, and magnify the other as most
excellent and profitable, both for the setting forth of Gods glory, and the
furthering and assuring of our own salvation. If we would but consider that
God is present, and beholds all our dealings, and will one day, as a
righteous Judge, call them to account, to reward them if they be upright and
just, or to punish 1. These. 4. 6.
them, if they be wicked and deceitful. If finally, when we come to sum up
our gettings in our Trades at the years end, we would put all our gains in
the one Scale, and our souls which we have hazzarded to everlasting loss, by
our unjust, untrue, and deceitful dealing, into the other, and consider how
light they be in comparison of it, which, as our Savior has taught us,
cannot be counterpoysed by the Mark. 8. 36.
weight and worth of the whole world. And so much concerning our dealings with
one another in contracts and bargaynes; the which I thought necessary to be in
some brief manner handled in this Treatise, because all Christians almost are
often employed in them, and many, whose callings consist in trading, do spend
the most part of their lives in it: As also, because the corruptions of the
times are so many and grievous, so backed with the multitude, and countenanced
with custom, that they are scarce thought to be any sins, insomuch as many,
which otherwise fear God, are often overtaken with them, either through
ignorance, walking according to the common course, for want of better
direction; or being compelled (as they suppose) with urgent necessity to do
as others do; because there being so few which do as they should, and such
multitudes which use fraud and deceit; if they should in their trading and
dealings use truth and justice, simplicity and honest plainness, they should
(as the Prophet complains of his times) become Esa* 59. 15.
a prey unto others, and be exposed to the common spoil. The which danger
would in great part be avoided, if men could live by faith, and cast
themselves upon Gods providence in the use of lawful means, seeing he never
fails them that trust in him. And also, if there were a general reformation
of these abuses and corruptions, among them that sincerely profess Religion,
and truly fear God, which might easily be done without any danger to their
estates; seeing what is wanting in ill-gotten gains, would be abundantly
supplied by the greatness of their custom; for who that is wise, would go
ordinarily to others, where he is likely to be deceived, when as he may trade
with them from whom he may assuredly expect honest and plain dealing? And so
much concerning those duties of Christian conversation, which are to be
observed in all companies and societies.

CAP. XXXI.
That Governors of families ought to train up those which are under their
charge in the duties of godliness.

. Sect. 1 That it is not enough for governors to be themselves religious, but
they must also train up those which are under their government, in the
knowledge and practice of Religion.
THe next duties belonging unto a godly life, are such as a Christian ought to
perform in his family, all which may generally be referred to this main
duty, that he not only duly and diligently serve God himself, but also teach
those who are under his charge to join with him, and not only by instruction
show them the right way, but also by wise and religious government, guiding
and training them up in the fear of the Lord, he must cause them to accompany
him, and to put in practice the holy duties of Gods service, in which he has
informed them. Neither is it sufficient that governors of families be good
Christians in their own particular and personal carriage, but according to
that place wherein God has set them, and that vocation whereunto they are
called, they ought to be Christian governors, and not only fight the Lords
battles as common Soldiers, but as wise and valiant Captains, they must lead
on those which are under their charge, and see that they in their places
perform good service to our grand Emperor and chief Commander the Lord of
Hosts, as well as they. And as Stewards and Bayliffes under our great Lord and
Master, they must appoint their children and servants unto their task, and see
also that they perform it. And thus Ioshuah, as a governor of the
Commonwealth, instructed the whole congregation in the Law of Ios. 8. ^5. and
24. 15.
God, with the women, little ones, and the strangers that were conversant
amongst them: And as a master of a family, undertakes not only for himself,
but also for his whole household, that he with them would serve the Lord. And
as David's care extended to the wise and religious government of the whole
Commonwealth, as their King and Sovereign, so he thought these high and
weighty employments no privilege to exempt him, from performing his special
duty, as a Master in the well ordering of his family. And therefore he
professes that he would walk within his house with Psalm. 101.
a perfect heart; neither nourishing wickedness in himself; nor enduring it
in any of his servants. And that he would drive out and expulse ungodly men
out of his family, and setting his eyes upon the faithful of the land, and
such as walked in a perfect way, as his special favorites, he would make
choice of them for his household servants. Yea virtuous Hester, Hest. 4. 16.
though a Queen, matched with an idolatrous King, and under an heathenish
government, not only her self diligently served God by fasting and prayer,
but also had so trained up her maids in the true fear of God, that they were
fit to bear her company. By which examples we learn, that there are no
distractions so great, no employments so weighty, which should hinder any
governors of families from performance of the like duties.

. Sect. 2 Diverse reasons which may move governors to the performance of this
duty.
To which end let us consider, first, that every family is a member and part of
the whole body, which ought to resemble it in nature and government, Col. 4. 15.
and as it were a particular Church, in which, the public duties are privately
to be performed, as the Apostle teaches us, whereas he saluteth Nymphas and
the Church which was in his house; and the Master of the family represents
the Minister, and the rest of the house the people in the Congregation, who are
to be governed and instructed by him; whereof it is that the Apostle would not
have wives and women to speak in the Church, and publicly to propound their
doubts in the assembly, but to crave resolution of their husbands at home.
Secondly, let us consider, that inferiors are set under our government, 1.
Cor. 14. 35.
not as brute creatures, but as reasonable men, and therefore, that not their
bodies and bodily employments alone are committed unto our charge for
government and direction, but their souls likewise, that they may be trained
up by us in all religious duties, and spiritual exercises, for which we shall
give an account unto God, how we have endeavored to make them to thrive
under us in the growth of Christianity, and fitted them for the service of
God, as well as how we have taught them their Trades, and in what sort
they should demean themselves toward us in our service. So that if we take
no further care of them then we do of our beasts, that is, only so to
govern, feed, and order them, as that they may be fitted for earthly
employments, and for the advancing of our worldly profit; when that their
souls perish through our negligence, their blood will be upon our heads, and
we shall have a fearful account to make at the day of Judgment. Thirdly,
let us consider that the family is the Seminary of the Church and
Commonwealth; and as a private school, wherein children and servants are
fitted for the public assemblies, as it were the Universities, to perform,
when they meet together, all religious duties of Gods worship and service. And
as it is a notable means to make Universities to flourish, and the Students in
them to succeed and prosper in their studies, when as the Masters of private
schools do well fit and prepare them, teach and nurture them in learning and
manners, before they send them thither: So if Masters of private families would
carefully train up all their household in the fear of God, and in the
exercises of Christian Religion all the week, they would with more
cheerfulness on Gods Sabbaths come unto the public assemblies, and with much
more reverence and attention, care and conscience set themselves as in Gods
presence to hear his Word, and call upon his holy Name, much better understand
what they hear, and lay it up in memory, profit far more by the use of Gods
holy Ordinances, for the conscionable practice of what they know, and thrive
more in their spiritual growth in one Sabbath, then others can do in many,
who, for want of instruction in the maine principles and acquaintance with the
Scriptures by private reading, understand not what they hear in the public
Ministry; and not being seasoned all the week in any religious duties, can
find no taste or relish in them, when on the Sabbath they come to perform
them with the rest of the congregation. Fourthly, let us know that by this
exercise, we shall not only do much good unto those whom we instruct, but
also unto our selves, seeing thereby we do stir up and increase Gods graces
in our own hearts as well as in theirs. For hereby we shall move the Lord to
impart unto us a larger measure of his gifts, when as we do so freely
communicate them to the use of our brethren; and to impart his will and
counsels unto us, when as with Abraham we Genesis 18. 19.
will teach them unto our children and household; we shall learn much in
teaching others, because it will give us occasion to set our wits more
seriously for the finding out of the truth, then in our private studies and
Meditations, and much clear our judgments, when we labor to deliver the
things that we teach plainly and distinctly, which were before confusedly
heaped up together in our understandings, as it were, in the whole lump. We
shall thereby much strengthen our memories, whilst by teaching others the
things we know, we shall work them into them, and cause them to make a
deeper impression. Finally, we shall inflame our hearts with the love of good
things, by those means which we use to work the like affection in the hearts
of others; and provoke our selves unto a conscionable practice of what we
know, by the same arguments and reasons which we use to persuade them unto it.
And consequently, in seeking to save them, we shall also thereby much further
our own salvation; according to that of the Apostle to Timothy, Meditate upon
these things, give thy self wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to
all; Take heed unto thy self, and unto the doctrine, continue therein; for in
so doing, thou shall both save thy self and them that hear thee. Which
privileges, howsoever they belong more principally to the public Ministry,
yet do they in some good proportion appertain also to those, who exercise
themselves in this private duty of teaching their family. Fifthly, let us
consider that it is the best means to make our children and servants faithful
and conscionable in performing their duties unto us, when they are first made
careful and conscionable in Gods service. For when their hearts are seasoned
with the true fear of God, then do they Ephesians. 6. 5, 6, 7, 8. Col. 3. 22, 23,
24.
perform their duty as unto God in us; not out of servile fear, but for
conscience sake; not for temporal rewards, but in hope and assurance of those
that are heavenly and eternal; not with eye-seruice as men-pleasers, but with
singleness of heart, as in the sight and presence of God, whom they labor to
please in all things; seeing from him they expect the chiefest and best part of
their wages and reward. Which means if masters and parents neglect, let them
never complain of bad servants and untoward children: for it is just with God,
that these should neglect their duties toward them, when as they, by neglecting
their duties in trayning them up in his fear, do cause them to neglect their
duties toward him. Sixthly, let us remember, that if we will thus set up Gods
Kingdom in our families, he will govern together with us, and so by his wise
and powerful providence guide and prosper all our endeavors, as that they
shall wholly tend to his glory and our good. For thus performing our duty, he
will double and redouble his favors upon us, blessing our servants and
children for our sakes, and us for their sakes, by causing all their labors to
prosper in their hands, as we see in the example of Abraham's servant, Jacob,
Joseph, Genesis 24. 52, 56. Genesis 30. 27. and 39. 3, 22. Act. 10. 2, 7, 23.
and the Soldiers and servants of Cornelius, who being trained up in the fear
of God, either by their masters or their own parents, prospered in their
proceedings, and so brought a blessing upon them and the whole families.
Whereas contrariwise, the neglect of these religious duties brings Gods wrath
upon the governors* and those likewise that belong unto him; according to that
of the Prophet; Power out thy fury upon the heathen that Ier. 10. 25.
know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy Name. Lastly, it
would be a notable encouragement to make us diligent in performing these
religious duties in our families, if we would but consider that we should
hereby be special means of gayning many unto Christ, which shall hereafter
be the Crown of our rejoicing; that we shall much more comfortably travel
in the way of holiness and righteousness, and in our tedious pilgrimage
toward our heavenly home, when we go not above, but have those that belong
unto us to bear us company, who will be ready at hand to assist us in our
journey, to admonish us when we are going out of the way, to keep us from
falling, and when we are fallen, to put to their helping hand for the raising of
us up again, and to fight on our side against those spiritual thieves, that
come to rob us of the rich treasures of Gods graces, and the malicious enemies
of our salvation, when they encounter us in the way, that they may foil us in
the fight, or force us with their fury to desist from our course, and to
return back again into the ways of sin and death. Finally, that we shall,
with unspeakable joy and rauishing comfort, appear before the Lord at the
latter day, when being accompanied with those (who having been by God
committed unto our charge, we have carefully governed and guided in the ways
of salvation) we shall resign and re-deliuer them unto God, to be crowned with
the same happiness which our selves shall enjoy; saying with our Savior, of
our families, as he of his Church; Behold me and Heb. 2. 13.
the children which thou have given me: which will infinitely more rejoice our
hearts at that day, then if having been Monarchs of the whole world, we should
have left it to our posterity, as an inheritance after us.

. Sect. 3 That it is the duty of householders to catechize their family; and of
the causes why it is neglected.
Now that we may thus nurture our family in Gods fear, and train them up to
the performance of all religious and Christian duties, as prayer, singing of
Psalms, reading the Scriptures, holy conferences, and such like, of which we
have already spoken, there is required first, that we instruct them in the
knowledge of God and his will; and secondly, wise government, whereby they may
be moved and drawn to put in practice, and make an holy use of all that is
taught and learned for the right informing of their lives. Concerning the
former, it is the duty of parents and governors of familyes, that they
instruct and catechize their children and servants in the true knowledge of
God, and in the maine principles of Christian Religion; which though it be a
most necessary and profitable duty to be performed of all, yet is it in these
days exceedingly neglected of the most, as a thing needless and not belonging
unto them. Of which neglect, these seem to be the chief causes; first, the
profaneness of men's minds, and contempt of religion, which makes them think
this one thing so necessary in Christ's judgment, to be in theirs Luke 10. 42.
of all things most unnecessary: and that whereas knowledge in all other
professions is required in some perfection, some little smattering or a bare
show, is sufficient in the profession of Christianity; which notwithstanding as
far excels them, as the soul the body, or heaven earth. Secondly, An
erroneous judgment, whereby they persuade themselves, that though this
knowledge be necessary for all, yet that the duty of instructing their
family in it, belongs not at all unto them, but unto the Ministers only.
Thirdly, their ignorance which disableth them unto it, being such as the
Apostle complains of, who when for the time Heb. 5. 12.
they ought to be teachers, yet had need to be catechized themselves in the
first principles of Religion, and to be fed with milk rather then strong
meat. Which is accompanied with a carnal shame of bewraying it to their
inferiors. Fourthly, A much more impious shame to be noted of those, who are
as bad or worse then themselves, for men too precise and forward in things not
pertaining unto them. The last and chiefest cause is worldly-mindednesse,
whereby men are wholly taken up with earthly affairs, so as they have neither
leisure nor pleasure to follow spiritual exercises, which so far prevails
with many, that they not only neglect this duty themselves, but also will not
suffer those, who are under their charge, to be taught by others. First,
because they would not have them more wise or religious then themselves.
Secondly, because they imagine, that they would be less pliable to unjust
courses, for the getting of unlawful gain; and that being more intent to Gods
service, they would become less diligent in the service of the carthly Mammon.
Lastly, because they cannot endure, that any time should be spent in religious
duties, as thinking all lost, which is not spent in worldly employments, and
consecrated to their earthly Idol of gain and profit. Yea this duty of
catechizing is not only neglected of household governors, but also of
Ministers, not only such as are either idle or insufficient to teach the
people, but likewise of many who are otherwise able and diligent. And that
first, because they consider not the profit and necessity of this excellent
exercise. Secondly, because they suppose that it is not pleasing and plausible
to the people. And lastly, because they think it too mean a subject for their
great learning and eminent gifts. But let such in the fear of God consider,
not what they are able to teach, but what the poor people, committed to their
charge, are able to learn, and that they must like nurses, give unto their
children, not the best and strongest meat, but that which they find by
experience the fittest to nourish them. Let them remember Christ's charge to
feed the tender Lambs, as well as the stronger sheep; and the Apostle John
21. 15.
Paul's practice and example, who chose rather to speak five words 1. Cor. 14.
19.
with understanding, that he might teach others, then ten thousand words in an
unknown tongue; and fitted his speech unto those which were babes in Christ,
and fed them with milk, and not with stronger meat, because 1. Cor. 2. 2, 3.
they were not able to bear it; becoming unto the weak as weak, that Chap.
9. 22.
he might gain the weak, and all things to all men, that he might by all
means save some. Finally, that Solomon himself, who excelled in all learning
and wisdom, stooped to the capacity of the meanest, and fitted his Pro. 1. 4,
5.
speech, that not only the wise in heart might increase in learning, but also
that the simple might attain unto wisdom.

. Sect. 4 Reasons which may move all Governors to this duty of catechizing.
First, because it is Gods Commandment.
And thus have we showed the causes of the great neglect of this holy
exercise. Let us in the next place consider of some reasons which may reform
it, and persuade all sorts of men to put it in practice with more diligence.
The which may be reduced unto two heads, as respecting either governors of
families, and Ministers who are to give instruction, or inferiors in the
family, as children and servants, and people in the congregation, that they may
give themselves over to be instructed by them. The former sort may be
persuaded by these reasons. First, because it is Gods Commandment, that
parents and governors of families should teach and catechize their children
and servants, not only instructing them in the knowledge of Christian
Religion, but also requiring an account of them by way of questions and
answers, how they have profited by their teaching, for the increasing of their
knowledge. Thus the Lord requires of the people of Israel, that they should
not only themselves remember and lay up in their hearts his words and works
which they had heard and seen, but also that they should teach them their
sons, and Deuteronomy. 4. 9. and 6. 7. Exodus 12. 26.
their sons sons. And in another place: These words which I command thee
this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shall teach them diligently unto
thy children, and thou shall talk of them when thou sit in thine house,
and when thou walk by the way, and when thou lie down, and when thou
risest up. So the Psalmist says, that God established a Testimony in Jacob,
and appointed a Law in Israel, which he commanded their fathers, that they
should make them known Psalm. 78. 5, 6.
unto their children, etc. But if parents neglect this duty, Ministers are
tied to perform it, both by Christ's precept, who enjoined them to feed his
Lambs as well as his Sheep, and also by his example, seeing his care extended
to little children, whom he would have to come unto Mark 10. 14.
him; and also in his childhood submitted himself to this ordinance of God,
though he were replenished with all divine wisdom, and more fit to teach,
then to be taught of others, and sitting, as it is probable, among the
cathecumenoi, which came to be catechized, heard the Doctors, and Luk 2. 46.
asked them questions. Now Christ's examples in holy duties are our
instructions; according to that, I have given you an ensample, that you should
Joh. 15. 13. The second reason drawn from the love of parents.
do as I have done to you. The second reason is drawn from the love of
parents toward their children, and of pastors toward their flock, which
ought to extend unto the soul more then to the body, as being much the more
excellent part. And therefore if they provide for their bodies all things
necessary, as food, clothing, houses, lands; how much more should they be
careful for the nourishment of their souls? which if they neglect, they show
plainly that their love is carnal, and but to the halues, loving only the
worse part, or rather none at all: For, Godliness is the chiefest 1. Tim. 6.
6. and 4. 8.
gain, and is profitable both unto body and soul, for all things, having the
promises of this life, and of that which is to come.

. Sect. 5 Other reasons enforcing the former duty.
The third reason is taken from the consideration of their natural pronenesse
unto evil, even from the breast, as experience teaches, which by Prou. 22. 6.
-- nunc adhibe puro pectore verba ^^cr. nunc te melioribus offer. Quo semel est
imbutarecens seruabit odorem Testadiu. Horat. ad Lollium. epist. lib. 1. ep. 2.
wholesome and timely instruction is to be prevented; that being first
seasoned with this precious liquor of true Religion, and saving knowledge, they
may retain the taste and savor of it to the end of their days. According to
Salomons counsel; Train up (or as the word signifies) Catechize a child in
the way that he should go; and when he is old he will not depart from it. Unto
which, if we add their readiness to relapse into their natural corruptions;
if by wholesome instructions they be not daily confirmed and strengthened in
good courses; and how soon sin will grow to a custom, and bring them to an
habit of wickedness, from which they can hardly afterward be reclaimed; we
shall easily understand the profit and necessity of this exercise. Fourthly,
the desire that children and servants should perform their duties to their
parents and governors, should make them careful in the first place to teach
them Religion and the true fear of God. For if this be not the foundation, all
other obedience is false and counterfeit, seeing they who yield it, are only
tied unto it in the carnal bonds of fear and rewards, and therefore it quite
cease when they cease. Neither will any with an honest heart and good
conscience perform it, if it rise not out of love and obedience toward God,
but with respect of persons, self-love, and such other sinister and
by-respects. Fifthly, the care which every Christian should have to propagate
the Church of God, should move them to this duty, seeing God is thereby
glorified, when as his Kingdom is enlarged and advanced: for as the Wise man
says, In the multitude of a people is the honor of a King. Now Prou. 14. 18.
this is most reasonable, that God, who created our children, should be
honored by our consecrating of them unto his service, and that we should
re-deliuer them unto him, who first gave them unto us, seeing they are his by a
double right, both of creation and redemption, and also challenged 1. Cor. 6.
20. Psalm. 127. 3.
by him as his own right and heritage. Sixthly, this may move us unto this
duty, if we consider that the time of youth is most seasonable for instruction;
seeing then, like wax, they are most apt to receive all impressions of good or
evil, and also to retain them when they are received. And therefore let it be
the care of all governors, to stamp first Gods seal upon their children,
that thereby also they may be marked for the children of God, before Satan
has prevented them, by sealing them for his slaves, and stamping upon them the
marks of perdition. Let them instruct them in the principles of true Religion,
when as by their docible age they are most fit to learn, and most strong and
able to retain what they have learned, in faithful memories; lest neglecting
this duty, Satan and the world teach them in their school of impiety, all
profaneness and wickedness; or if they incline at all to some Religion, do
by their instruments seduce them from the truth, sow in their minds the seeds
of errors, schism and heresies, and draw them away from God, by teaching them
to offer unto him for his pure service, their own, or other men's inventions
and traditions, will worship, superstition and idolatry.

. Sect. 6 Examples of the faithful who have catechized their family.
Lastly, the examples of the faithful in all ages, who have been diligent in
the performing of this duty, may persuade us unto it. Thus we read Genesis 4. 1,
2.
that Cain and Abel served God by sacrifices, which they could not have done,
there being then no written Word for their direction, unless they had been
instructed in Gods true Religion by their parents. So Abraham is commended for
this duty, from whom God would not hide his secret counsels, because he knew
that he would command his children and his household Genesis 18. 19.
after him, that they might keep the way of the Lord. Thus Solomon was
instructed 1. Chro. 28. 9. Pro. 30.
by David his father, and by Bathsheba his mother, from his tender youth, to
his riper age, as himself professes; I was my fathers son, tender Pro. 4.
3, 4.
and only beloved in the sight of my mother. He taught me also, and said unto
me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments and live, etc. And
we read that Iehoash the King was instructed from his tender youth 2. King.
12. 2.
in the knowledge of God, by his good uncle Iehoiada the Priest. So also in the
New Testament, this duty was practiced; for there were two sorts of
Catechumenoi, or such as were catechized; first, such as were adulti, and of
ripe age, who were catechized in the principles of Christian Religion before
they were baptized; as Theophilus, the Eunuch, Cornelius, and his household,
Apollos, and many others, whereof these principles were called Heb. 6. 2.
the doctrine of Baptismes. And the second sort borne in the Church, who being
in the Covenant, were baptized in their infancy, and after that catechized,
and then confirmed by the imposition of hands, whereof the principles were
called the doctrine of the imposition of hands, in the same place; because at
their confirmation they first rendered an account of their faith. And thus Paul
remembering Timothies unfeigned faith, says, that it dwelt 2. Tim. 1. 5.
first in his grandmother Lois, and his mother Eunice, of whom he makes
honorable mention, because they had instructed him from his youth in the
doctrine of it. And therefore, if we would be numbered in the Calender of the
faithful, or be made happy in their rewards; let us follow their example, and
as we have opportunity and convenient time, let us catechize and instruct in
the principles of Christian Religion, all those that being capeable of
knowledge, are committed to our charge.

. Sect. 7 Reasons moving children to submit themselves to be catechized.
And these are the reasons which may persuade governors to perform this duty
of Catechizing; unto which, we will add some others, which may move those who
are under their government, to submit themselves willingly unto this Ordinance
of God, to receive instruction from them, and attentively to hear them,
carefully to treasure up in their hearts and memories what they have learned,
and chearefully to render an account of it, when they are called thereunto. The
which I thought necessary, in respect of the backwardness which is to be
observed in most families and congregations amongst all sorts, not only nor
chiefly among children in years, but especially such as being riper in age,
are notwithstanding children in knowledge. The which is caused by their
natural auersenesse to these religious duties, by the corruption of their
judgments, persuading them that they are unnecessary, by the worldliness and
profaneness of their hearts, which hinders them from attending unto
instruction, and consequently makes them unwilling to be called to account,
because they find themselves unable to answer and give any satisfaction to
their teachers; by carnal pride, and proud bashfulnesse, which causes them
scornefully to cast off Christ's yoke, and contemptuously to refuse subjection
unto his Ordinance, because they fear to be disgraced before others, for their
ignorance and small profiting in the knowledge of Christian Religion; and
finally, by the subtle malice of the devil, which casts before them all
discouragements which he can devise or raise against this profitable exercise,
because he well knows, that it is a most powerful means to dispell the
mists of ignorance, through which he misleadeth men to profaneness, heresy,
hell, and destruction, and to inlighten men's minds with saving knowledge, to
beat him from his throne, and to cast down the strong holds of sin, and to
set up and establish in their hearts the gracious Kingdom of Jesus Christ, by
which they shall be brought to all glory and heavenly happiness.

. Sect. 8 Reasons moving those which are of years to submit themselves to be
catechized, if they be ignorant.
Now these reasons concern not only children in years, but also children in
knowledge, though they be ancient in respect of age. The first Ephesians 2. 10. Luke
1. 74. Deuteronomy 28. 14. Deuteronomy. 12. 32.
whereof may be taken from the end of their creation and redemption, for they
are created unto good works, which God has ordained that they should walk in
them; they are redeemed out of the hands of their spiritual enemies, that they
should serve God in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of
their lives; they are not their own, but bought with a price, that they might
glorify their Redeemer in their souls and bodies. But none can truly serve
the Lord, unless they know him, his will, and Word, from which they must not
decline to the right hand nor to the left, and neither add any thing to it,
nor detract ought from it; for else through natural ignorance, they will (as
our Savior charge the Samaritans) worship they know not what, Ioh. 4. 22.
and in stead of his true service, offer unto him their own will worship and
inventions. Neither can we come to this knowledge, but by the means which God
has ordained, one of the chief whereof is this religious exercise. Secondly,
we have vowed in our baptism, that we will fight under Christ's Banner against
our spiritual enemies, which we cannot do without receiving a shameful
overthrow, unless our Christian Armor be put on and fastened unto us with the
girdle of verity, and unless we be trained up in this Christian warfare, and
taught rightly to use the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God. Now if vows
must be paid without delay, then Psalm. 76. 11.
how much more this which imports us as much as our salvation? A third reason
may be taken from Gods love and fatherly care and providence watching over us,
and preserving us from all perils and dangers in the time of our infancy and
childehood, unto which as we were naturally most prone, so were we utterly
unable to avoid them by our own providence, or to use any means to help our
selves. Which consideration should move us, as soon as we are come to
knowledge and discretion, to testify our thankfulness by learning his ways,
that we may walk in them, and thereby glorify him who has so graciously
preserved us. Fourthly, let us consider, that the Law was given, not only to
the ancient and them of ripe age, but also to children and young men, that they
might cleanse their ways by taking heed thereunto according to Gods Psalm.
119. 9.
Word; which made Iosuah to read it unto them all alike. And both old Josh. 8.
35.
and young shall be called to give an account of their works and ways at the
last day, according to that in the Revelation, I saw the dead, great and Apoc.
20. 12.
small, stand before God, and the books were opened, etc. and the dead were
judged out of those things which were written in those books, according to
their works. And therefore the young as well as the old, must prepare
themselves for their reckoning, and learn both what strength the Book of the
Law has to indite and condemn him, and how by the Gospel they may trauerse
this indictment, and be acquitted from that dreadful sentence of condemnation,
by pleading full satisfaction by Jesus Christ. And therefore when his soul
wallowing it self in carnal delights, says unto him; Rejoice, Eccles. 11. 9.
O young man, in thy youth, and let thine heart cheer thee in the days of thy
youth; and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes;
then let him remember, that for all these things God will bring him to
judgment. Fifthly, consider that this age above all others, is most fit to
receive and retain instruction and information in the ways of the Lord, as
also reformation and amendment of our sinful courses. Which if it be deferred
to riper age, they will be less able to learn the will and ways of God, to
hold them in memory, or to obey and walk in them. For the faculties of the
soul will be more enfeebled, and they distracted with earthly cares, and love
of the world, ambition, covetousness, voluptuousness; they will then be more
apt to content themselves with their ignorance, wherein they have bin so long
nuzzled; their passions will grow strong and violent, and custom of sinning
laying fast hold on them, will pull them back from the school of piety, yea
will make them openly to profess, that they are now too old to learn; by all
which, who sees not how desperately they hazard their salvation, who put off
instruction, and neglect the means of it, in the time of their youth? And
therefore let us hearken to the Wise man's counsel; and remember now our
Creator in the days of our Eccles. 12. 1.
youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh when thou
shall say, I have no pleasure in them. Sixthly, let us remember, that God would
have first fruits offered unto him, as a type to teach us, that the prime of
our age is an oblation wherein he chiefly delights; that our Savior was much
pleased, when little children entertained him with their applause, Crying Math.
21. 15. Psalm. 8. 2.
Hosanna to the Son of David; that God out of the mouth of babes and
sucklings has ordained strength, because of his enemies, that he might still
the enemy and the auenger. Finally, that in the time of the law, they were
enjoined to offer unto God the young and lusty, and not the old and lame, to
show that the Lord would have the prime of our age and strength consecrated to
his service; although in the Gospel all are invited to the marriage Supper,
the poor, Luke 14. 21.
maimed, halt and blind, because (so we bring with us the wedding garment) it
is better in our age to come halting to the feast, and through the dimnesse of
our sight, groping for the right way, then to frame worldly excuses, and absent
our selves altogether.

. Sect. 9 Of the great profit of this exercise of catechizing.
Lastly, let the profit and manifold benefits which accompany this duty, be an
effectual means to persuade us unto it. For they only are saved who Ioh. 3.
16, 17, 36 Mar. 16. 16. Romans 10. 15, 17.
have faith, and they faith alone, who have knowledge, both which come by
hearing, as the Apostle teaches us, How shall they call upon him, in whom they
have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom, they have not
heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher? So then faith comes by
hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. And this the Apostate Julian well
knew, and therefore to root out the Church, he thought it the most effectual
way, to put down Christian Schools, and Religious exercises, that being
deprived of all means of knowledge, he might lead them in their ignorance
which way he listed. Secondly, it is a notable means to free them from
errors and heresies, when they are grounded in the knowledge of the truth, and
the analogy of faith, that will serve them as a touchstone and rule, according
to which doctrines must be examined; which whosoever want, may easily be led even
into fundamental errors. For as the Apostle says, there must be heresies in
the world, unto 1. Cor. 11. 19.
which men naturally are more inclined then unto the truth; and therefore we
must not hand over head hearken unto every spirit, nor when we hear, judge of
them according to our natural reason, but we must, as the Apostle John
exhorts us, try them whether they be of God or no, by 1. Ioh. 4. 1.
bringing them to be examined by the touchstone of his Truth. The which we
shall be utterly unable to do, if we be not acquainted with the Scriptures,
and have no knowledge of the maine principles, and the analogy of faith
contained in them. Where, by the way we may note the cause why Popery so much
increases amongst us, namely, because for want of catechizing in many places,
the people remain ignorant of the principles of Christian Religion, and so
upon the alleging of any carnal reason, plausible to corrupted nature, they
become an easy prey to the Priests and Jesuits. Thirdly, It helps notably
to the hearing of Sermons with profit, both because being grounded in the
principles and maine parts of divinity, we shall be able to refer all
things we hear to their heads, and also to examine Doctrines according to the
analogy of Faith. For seeing there will be many false christ's and antichrists,
false prophets, false teachers, and ravenous wolves that will come in sheep
clothing; we must not receive all that is preached in a pulpit, but try all
things, and take 1. These. 5. 21.
that only which is good. The which we cannot do, if we be unacquainted
with the Scriptures, and destitute of the knowledge of the principles of
Christian Religion. Where, by the way we may note the reason why most men,
even in the chief Cities, and places where the Gospel has been long
preached, yea even such as make most sincere profession of Religion, are so
void of all sound judgment in hearing Sermons, that they are more affected with
the strength of the voice, the^ the powerfulnes of arguments, look more after
the manner, then after the matter, and to a ready and fluent speech, then
soundnes of Doctrine and faithful handling of the text. Why also they so
little profit by their much hearing for their increase in knowledge, and
strengthening of their faith, the sanctifying of their hearts, and walking in a
settled course of a Christian life. Finally, why they with such earnestnes,
flock after new comers, and so easly harken unto every new opinion, though the
broacher of it have only a show of sanctity, and be quite destitute of al good
learning or sound knowledge of Divinity; namely, because the people being
ungrounded, and ignorant of the principles of Religion, are wholly vnstayd and
unsettled in their judgments, and wanting the spirit of discerning, are not
possibly able to make any good choice. Fourthly, This exercise is most
profitable for such as are weak in ye spiritual growth, and but babes in
Christ, because it is the fittest food for their Spiritual nourishment, seeing
in respect of their weakness which makes them unable to digest stronger meat,
they would quickly be famished and fall into a deep consumption of all grace,
if there were not prepared for them meats of such easy and light disgestion.
For stones (as we know) will do little children as much good as the whole
loaf, they wanting strength to cut it, or teeth to chew it, and so also it is
in the spiritual nourishment, the weaklings being as incapable of high
mysteries, deep points of Divinity, and difficult and perplexed controversies,
as of a speech uttered in a strange language. And therefore as it must be the
teachers care and wisdom to prepare fit nourishment for those under their
charge, and to feed babes 1. Cor. 3. 2. Heb. 5. 12, 13.
in Christ with milk; or when they provide stronger meat for their sake who
are of riper age, yet as much as they can, they must like loving nurses have
also therein respect to their little ones, dividing and (as it were) chewing
this more solid meat, and making it soft and easy with familiar similitudes,
and plain examples, as our Savior taught his Disciples, not according to the
greatness of his divine wisdom, but so as they were Mark. 4. 33.
able to hear it: So on the other side, those which are children in knowledge,
must chiefly affect that food which is fittest for their nourishment, and not
out of foolish wantonness and vain curiosity, affect the hearing of learned
discourses, high points of divinity and hidden mysteries, when as they are
ignorant of the easy principles, as it is the custom of many simple people,
who most applaud and magnify their teachers, when their speeches most exceed
the pitch and reach of their shallow understanding. Fifthly, they shall by this
exercise be enabled to give an account of their faith, not in some few points
only, like smatterers, but in all which are 1. Pet. 3. 15.
substantial and fundamental. The which will be a notable encouragement to
the profession of Christ and the true Religion, especially in the time of
persecution, when we distinctly know what we hold and believe, and wherein
we differ from our adversaries; the want whereof is a great hinderance to
Christian apology, and a special means to make us to deny Christ before men;
seeing the most are ashamed to make profession of that truth, whereof when they
are examined, they can give no Matthew. 10. 34.
account; to suffer for that Religion which they cannot defend, or at least
disttinctly conceine, or to take upon them like Christ's Champions to fight for
the truth against the enemies of it, even to the shedding of their blood, when
as they have no skill in handling the sword of the Spirit. Lastly, hereby they
shall not only be informed in the ways of godliness, but also incited and
enabled to walk in them; as we see in the example Genesis 22. and 24. 63.
of Isaac, who by his fathers instruction, became obedient to the death;
prays and meditateth in fields, and in all things followed his fathers steps.
And of his servant likewise, who being trained up by Abraham, and catechized in
the knowledge of God and his truth, carries himself religiously toward God,
and faithfully toward his Master. And also of Solomon, who being taught by his
father, to esteem and labor after, above all things, wisdom and
understanding, afterward when God puts him to his choice, to ask and
obtain whatsoever he would, he Pro. 4. 4, 5.
desires an understanding heart, that he might judge the people, and discern
between good and bad. Unto which we might add innumerable more examples,
both of former and latter times; all which may serve as strong inducements, to
persuade all weak Christians both young 1. King. 3. 9.
and old, to be diligent in this exercise, if, at least, they have any care
to know Gods will, or make any conscience of yielding obedience unto it.

CAP. XXXII.
Of family duties, which respect wise and religious government.

. Sect. 1 What things are required unto wise government.
ANd these are the duties of governors in families, which respect instruction.
The second main duty, is wise and religious government, whereby they are to
move and draw their inferiors to put in practice, and to make an holy use of
all which they teach them, in their lives and conuersations; unto which, some
things are required in the persons of their governors, and some things in the
administration of their government. In their persons diverse things are
required. As first, wisdom and Christian prudence in all their courses, that
they may not only guide themselves in their own ways, but be able also to
give direction unto all that belong unto them. For that which the Apostle Peter
requires specially of husbands, does generally belong unto all governors,
that they dwell with their 1. Pet. 3. 7.
inferiors, according to knowledge, as being a principal means to gain from
them due honor and authority. Secondly, that they be not light and vain in
their carriage and government, but behave themselves in all things gravely,
and with a kind of Christian Majesty and authority; according to the example
of Job, who observed such gravity in his carriage, that when the young men saw
him, they hid themselves, and the aged arose and Job 29. 8, 9.
stood up; the Princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
The which, as it gains authority to governors, so the contrary leuitie and
lightness of behavior, does expose their persons to scorn, and their
government to neglect and contempt. Thirdly, there is required, that piety,
justice, and sobriety, do shine in the whole course of their conversation,
that so they may become examples unto their inferiors, of an holy, righteous
and unblameable life, then the which, nothing is more powerful and effectual,
to draw inferiors to imitation of those virtues which they observe in them.
And therefore David intending a strict reformation of his house, begins
first with himself, that he might be an example unto all the rest, and
resolves that he will behave himself wisely in a perfect way, and walk
within his house with an upright heart, and then that he will banish out the
wicked from his family, and entertain and countenance the religious and
faithful of the land. Whereas contrariwise, if they take never so much pains
in teaching them their duties, yet if they do not make their own lives
examples of their rules, but run a contrary course in their practice, they
shall not so much further them in the ways of godliness by their
instructions, as discourage and hinder them by their bad example. Fourthly,
they must not insult over their inferiors with tyrannical pride and cruelty,
nor do all they may, by reason of their power and authority, to keep them
under, as base underlings, out of a fond and false opinion, raising the pitch
of their absoluteness and greatness, out of their slavish deiection, who are
under their government; but they must mix with their power and authority,
parent-like love, brotherly humanity, and Christian mildness and modesty, that
their inferiors may honor them as fathers, as well as fear them like Lords,
and may yield unto them, free, cheerful, and voluntary obedience, subiecting
to their government, Romans 13. 5.
not only their bodies and outward actions, but also their hearts, wills, and
inward affections. For if the hearts of Kings themselves must not be lifted up
above their brethren, then much less should the hearts Deuteronomy. 17. 20.
of inferior governors in families be thus exalted. Fifthly, they must
govern in the Lord, as his Vicegerents and Deputies, and chiefly aim therein
at Gods glory, remembering that from him they have all their authority, and that
they exercise not their own, but the judgments of the Lord, according to the
saying of good Iehoshaphat to his Judges; Take 2. Chro. 19. 6.
heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with
you in judgment. And this must make them chiefly to aim by their government,
to contain their inferiors in the duties of piety and righteousness, that
God may be glorified, both by themselves, and also by all those which are in
the family. And finally, they must make it appear in all their government,
that they do not wholly aim at their own particular and private profit, but
also at their joint good; which is the chief cause why the Lord has made them
superiors unto others, not that they may serve their turn of them, and look
no further; but that they may (like the head, the members of the body) govern
them for their benefit. And this argument the Lord uses to persuade inferiors
to honor their superiors, that it might go well with themselves, in the land
which the Lord gave Deuteronomy. 5. 16.
them. And the Apostle moves them to do that which is good, upon the like
reason, because their governors were the Ministers of God to them for good if
they did well. Romans 13. 4.


. Sect. 2 Of the justice and love which are required in government.
The things required unto the administration of their government, are justice,
and love, the which must be tempered the one with the other, that love may
moderate and sweeten justice, and justice may keep love impartial and
upright, lest our actions sauouring of nothing but justice, seem rigorous, and
expose us to hatred; and love not guided nor backed by justice, degenerate into
doting fondness, and so expose us to contempt; whereas both rightly mixed the
one with the other, will cause reverence and obedience. The which mixture must
be used in all our actions toward all under our government, although these
virtues are to be exercised diversely, and the one to be more manifested then
the other, according to occasion, time, persons, and deserts. For though we
ought to love all, yet those especially who excel in Gods graces, and profit
most in all religious, Christian, and civil duties; and to such, our love must
be most manifested, to encourage them to go on in their good courses, and to
draw others to follow their example. The which was David's practice, as he
professes; who, though he were indifferently just toward all his subjects,
yet his love exceeded toward the faithful of the land, and those which walked
Psalm. 102. 6.
in a perfect way. But especially our love and justice must appear in our
rewards and chastisements, which are the main bonds and very sinews of
government. We must reward those who deserve well, partly by our words,
commending their good actions, which is a great encouragement to well-doing, as
the Apostle implies, when he uses it as a reason to persuade inferiors to
their duty; Do that which is good (says he) and thou shall have praise of the
same; the which, our Savior will use to Romans 13. 3.
his servants at the last day; Well done, good and faithful servant, thou have
Mat. 25. 23.
been faithful over a few things, etc. And partly by deeds, the which must
savor both of justice, in giving them their due wages, and of love and bounty,
by giving according to our ability, gifts, to encourage them in their
well-deseruing. Chastisements also must be used toward them, who will not
otherwise be reclaimed from their faults, nor kept in due order, either in
words only, by gentle or more sharp reproves, according to the quality of the
offense, or by stripes, when nothing else will serve. For otherwise we shall
offend against God in neglecting (being his Deputies) to glorify 1. Sam. 2. 29.
him in his Justice; against our selves, by becoming accessory to their sins;
against the parties offending, whom we reclaim not, but suffer them to go on
in their wickedness to their destructions; against those of the same family,
whom by this impunity we encourage to follow their ill example; and the whole
society, which is hereby made obnoxious to Gods Justice. But this correction is
only good when it is necessary, being like a sharp salve and bitter potion,
which none that are wise will use for wantonness. And therefore his counsel
is good, which (as God himself implies in Familia^ tua^ ita rege and confoue,
vt te matrem magis tuorum quam dominam videri velis. Hier. ad Celan.
the fifth Commandment) persuades a godly Matrone, that she should so govern
her family and cherish it, as that she should rather seem their mother then
their mistrisse; and draw from them reverence rather by loving benignity, then
rigorous severity. For that obedience is always more faithful and acceptable,
which flows from love, then that which is extorted by fear. Yet if there be
no other help, but that correction must be used as necessary; let us in it
observe first, justice, both in making sure, that the fault is committed, and
deserves punishment, and that the punishment do not exceed the quality of
the fault, which is to rage and revenge, rather then chastize for amendment.
Secondly, It must be inflicted in love, which must appear by moderating the
punishment, that it do not exceed necessity, respecting the parties
reformation; and by the end which we propound in our corrections, which is the
good of the party, in the amendment of his faults for the time to come, which
we must always advance by joining admonition and good counsel with our
chastizement, with promises of love and kind usage when as we find any
reformation. Lastly, this love must appear in our patience and forbearance,
not coming rashly and violently upon the party, but after we have tried in
vain all other means. Nor in rage and anger, as though we came to take
revenge; but temperately and quietly, slowly and with god advice, as
propounding no other end but the parties amendment.

CAP. XXXIII.
How we ought to behave our selves in the estate of prosperity, that we may
thrive in all spiritual graces.

. Sect. 1 What prosperity is, and how apt we are to abuse it through our
corruption.
WE are now come in the last place to consider how we ought to carry our
selves every day, in respect of those several estates and conditions of
prosperity and adversity unto which God calls us. The which having no
certain and set time allotted unto them by God, (for we may diverse days
together flourish in prosperity, or be as long cast down and humbled by
troubles and afflictions, yea sometime, and that most commonly, have them
intermingled the one with other, beginning the day with joy in our prosperous
affairs, and ending it with sorrow and grief by reason of our crosses and
calamities, or contrariwise have cause of mourning in the morning, and of
rejoicing before the evening) therefore the duties which concern these
several estates, cannot be limited to any set time, but must follow and
accompany them, as it shall please God to give us occasion by the interchanging
our diverse states and conditions the one with the other. Of which my purpose is
to speak very briefly, though they be matters which greatly import the
Christian life, because I have largely handled them already in my Christian
Warfare. And first, for prosperity, In the second and third part of the
Christian Warfare.
which consists in the possession and fruition of all Gods temporal
blessings or many of them, as health, wealth, peace, plenty, liberty, fame,
friendship, honors, pleasures, with wife, children, houses, lands of the best
sort; they are in themselves Gods good gifts, which he delights Psalm. 35. 37.
Eccle. 3. 22. Psalm. 118. 25. and 116. 12, 13. Genesis 39. 2, 23.
to bestow upon those that serve him, as the present pay and reward of their
love and duty; and wherein he would have us to delight, praying for them when
we want them, and praising him when we have them, as being in their own
nature, and if they be rightly used, testimonies of Gods love, and signs of
his gracious presence. But in respect of our corruption, this state is liable
to much abuse, as not being absolutely good, but of an indifferent nature, in
respect of that use whch we make of it, remaining good to those that use it
rightly, and degenerating into evil when it is abused. Unto which abuse we
are naturally most prone, as every man may find, not only by general
observation, but in his own lamentable experience; we being herein like unto
small ships, which carrying too great a sail, are ouerturned in every tempest;
or like those, who having ill stomachs and weak brains, are ready to surfeit
of the best meats, upon the least fullness, and to be distempered and
overtaken with drunkenness in the use of the best drinks, if they please
their appetite, and take any more of them then will satisfy nature.

. Sect. 2 That we must be diligent, lest our prosperity become unto us an
occasion of sin; and how this is to be done.
In which regard, prosperity, which is good in it self, becomes exceeding
dangerous unto us, as being an ordinary and common means, both to occasion our
falls into many sins, and to hinder our rising again by unfeigned repentance.
In which regard, it greatly behooves us, when we live in this estate, to
think that we walk in slippery places, and as it were upon the narrow ridge
of a steep hill, the descent on both sides being headlong and dangerous, in
which, if we slide, we are ready to tumble by degrees into a gulf of
wickedness. And consequently, as we desire to walk acceptably unto God, and
tender our own salvation, we must with all care and circumspection look unto
our footing, that we may be preserved from these fearful falls, and receive
no hurt in this dangerous passage. To which purpose, I will propound some rules
concerning the right carriage of our selves in this estate, which if we
observe, they will serve as some stays to keep us from slipping, and like
rayles on either side of a narrow bridge over a deep and dangerous river,
preserve us from falling and sinking into the depths of sin and worldly
wickedness. And to this purpose we are to look on the left hand with all
care and providence, that we stay our selves, by shunning the abuse of our
prosperity, and on the right hand with no less heedfulnesse, that we use it
rightly and in an holy manner. For the first, our care must be, that we so
use our worldly prosperity and temporal things, that they be not helps and
inducements unto any sin. And to this end, let us often consider, that they
are the blessings of God, which he has bestowed upon us, to encourage us in
his service; and therefore what a sin and shame is it, to take occasion by
his bounty the more to displease him? to use them as the weapons of iniquity to
fight on the devils side, against our Lord and Sovereign? and to abuse these
benefits which are given us of God for comforts in our pilgrimage, as
impediments which hinder us in our journey, and as pricks in our sides, to
hasten our speed toward hell and destruction.

. Sect. 3 That in our prosperity we must take heed lest we forget God, that his
blessings do not draw our hearts from him, and that we be not unthankful.
More especially let us take heed, that by these temporal blessings we be not
made more forgetful of God, unto which vice we are naturally prone Luke 15.
in the time of our prosperity, because, when we enjoy all we desire, and
have need of nothing, we are not sensible that we want his help; nor so apt
to remember him, that we may give him thanks for that we have, as to beg
at his hands the things we want; as we see in the example of the Prodigal,
who thought not on his father, when he was in prosperity, but when he is
pinched with poverty, then he thinks of returning unto him. Whereof it is,
that the Lord so often warned the Israelites, that when they inioyed ease and
plenty in the Land of Promise, they should beware that they did not forget him:
the which notwithstanding they neglected; for as the Prophet complains, As in
their pastures, so were they filled, they were filled, and their hearts Deuteronomy.
6. 10, 11. and 8. 10, 11. Hos. 13. 6.
were exalted; therefore they have forgotten me. Which that we may not also
do, let us often consider, that it is a foul shame for us to take occasion by
these tokens of Gods love the sooner to forget him, which he has purposely
sent to put us in mind of his love and bounty toward us. Let us as often as
we look upon them, remember, that they are not chiefly Psalm. 127. 1, 2.
purchased by our own endeavors (for how many seek, and cannot enjoy them,
who far exceed us in wit and industry?) but that we have them from God, and
by his blessing upon our labors. Finally, let us often remember, that though
we abound in these earthly things, yet they will not do us any good, unless
God give his blessing in their use, and make them effectual to those ends for
which he has given them. Secondly, let us be careful when we abound with
temporal blessings, that they do not draw our hearts from God, as they surely
will, if we esteem them as our chief treasures, and in our affections dote
too much upon them; according to that of the Apostle John; If any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in him. To 1. Ioh. 2. 15.
which end let us consider, that it is extreme folly to love the creature
better then the Creator, seeing whatsoever beauty, goodness or excellency is
in them, it is infinitely more in him, from whom they have it as a small drop
out of the maine Ocean. That it is horrible ingratitude and unkindness to love
Gods gifts better then the giver, and when as a gracious Bridegroom he
sends them as loue-tokens, or deputies to woo our hearts, we neglect him and
dote upon his messengers. Thirdly, let us take heed, that by how much the Lord
is more liberal in bestowing his benefits, that we be not by so much the
more unthankful; which might seem a needelesse admonition, if we did not
see by daily experience, that we are in our poverty more thankful for every
small trifle, which relieueth our present necessities, then in our riches and
abundance, when we have our wants supplied before they pinch us; that we are
more ready to praise God for a little ease in a great sickness, then when we
enjoy perfect health; and for a little sleep after much restless waking, then
when we have long taken our natural and quiet repose, without any let, or the
least disturbance. For we see the worth of Gods blessings more in their want,
then in their fruition, and the better we know them, the more thankful we
are for them. Besides, we are apt to be made wanton by our prosperity, and
to vex our selves more in longing after superfluities, then others in the want
of necessaries. And if we be crossed in these desires, and have not our
appetite satisfied to the full, we are ready ungratefully to forget all the
good things which we enjoy, and to murmr and repine as if we had nothing.
Which odious vice that we may avoid, let us consider when we find our selves
inclining unto it, how many good things we enjoy that others want, who better
deserve them; that God is as sufficient and ready to give us what we want, as
what we have, if in his wisdom and goodness he did see them fitting for us.
That we endanger our selves to be deprived of our present blessings, by doting
so upon the things we have not, that we be unthankful for that we have; for
God seeing that our discontents arise from wantonness rather then want, will
wisely take away the greatest part of his benefits, that we may be more
thankful for those that remain.

. Sect. 4 That in our prosperity we must beware of pride, security, and
hardness of heart, licentiousnes, and contempt of spiritual and heavenly
things.
Fourthly, let us in our prosperity watch over our selves, that we be not
puffed up with pride, unto which this estate through our corruption makes
Exodus 5. 2. Esa. 10. 8. and 47. 7, 8. Psalm. 10. 10. and 73. 6, 9. 2. Sam. 24.
1. 2. Chro. 32. 25. 1. Cor. 4. 7.
us prone, as we may see, not only in the examples of former times, as
Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon, and of those wicked men, of whom the Psalmist
speaks, who being enclosed in their own fat, spoke proudly with their mouth,
and flourishing in all earthly abundance, put on pride as a chain about their
necks; yea holy David and good Ezechias were thus overtaken, and though in the
time of their trouble they were meek and humble, yet were their hearts lifted
up in their prosperity. The which, the experience of these times does make too
manifest, wherein not only mere worldlings, but even many of the faithful
are taynted with this odious vice, by reason of their earthly abundance, and
long prospering in their worldly desires. Which that we may prevent, let us
consider, that we have nothing but what we have received, not as absolute
gifts, but as our Masters goods, lent only unto us for our use, for which we
stand indebted, and must give an account at the day of Judgment; and what
reason have we to be proud of our debts? that God so hates this vice of
pride, that he will rather withdraw from us his spiritual graces, and his
gracious assistance in the time of tentation, that by falling into other sins
we may be cured of this, and have our souls adorned with true humility; and
therefore how much rather will he deprive us of temporal benefits, and things
of far less value, then we should continue infected with this vice, which
above all others he most abhors? And when the greatness of our gifts and
possessions begin to puff us up, let us think, how we have employed them,
and whether we have so increased and improoued them for the glory of our
Master, and good of our fellow servants, as that we may with cheerfulness
present our selves before God, when he calls us to a reckoning. Finally, in
our greatest plenty of earthly things, let us call to mind our spiritual
wants, and how defective we are in sanctifying and saving graces, especially
in our thankfulness unto God for these temporal benefits; and so our plenty
in the one will not so much exalt us, as our defects in the other, which are
much more excellent and necessary, will humble and abase us. Fifthly, when we
enjoy prosperity, let us beware of security and hardness of heart, which is an
ordinary effect that does accompany it. For men are apt to flatter themselves
in the assurance of Gods love, when he causes them to prosper in their
courses, and gives unto them these outward signs of his favor; and so to
live in their sins with impenitencie and hardness of heart, promising unto
themselves impunity, and that all shall go well with them for the time to
come. Thus David says; because the wicked man's ways prospered, Therefore Gods
judgments were high above out of his sight, presuming that he Psalm. 10 6.
Eccl. 8. 11.
should never be moved nor come into any danger. Yea he himself, as he
confesses, was thus overtaken with security, presuming in his prosperity, that
he should never be moved. Which that we may avoid, let us consider, that
Psalm. 30. 6.
temporal blessings are no infallible signs of Gods love, seeing as the Wise
man speaks, they happen to all alike, and are more often and liberally Eccl.
9. 1.
bestowed upon Gods enemies, who have their portion in this life, then upon his
own children, for whom he reserueth the everlasting and heavenly inheritance;
that there is a vicissitude and change of all these estates, and nothing
remains certain under the Sun; that the longer God deferreth, the more
severely he will punish when he comes, and the greater our blessings are,
the greater shall be our plagues, if we abuse them to security and
impenitencie. Sixthly, let us take heed when we are in prosperity, that we do
not abuse it to licentiousness and carnal liberty, unto which, men in this
state are most prone, as the Histories of all times and daily experience
teaches. For who sees not, that they who abound in wealth and worldly
honors, do for the most part give themselves over to all voluptuous and
sensual delights; as though God had sent them into the world, and had put into
their hands such large wages of earthly blessings, that they should spend them
and their precious time, in Hunting and Hawking, carding and dycing, courting,
dancing and reuelling, drinking, feasting, and such like carnal pleasures?
yea, who does not perceive, that they often abuse them to injury and
oppression, revenge, and all kinds of injustice, when they have to deal with
their inferiors; abusing their power and authority unto tyranny, which they
think never sufficiently manifested and magnified, till they have borne down
and trodden under foot, all that stands in their way, right and reason, law,
conscience, and common honesty? which abuses that we may shun, let us
remember often the maine ends why God has given us these worldly benefits
above others, namely, that we might be better enabled, and become more forward
to glorify him, to do more good unto our brethren, and abound in the works
of mercy and Christian charity, and that we might have better means to serve
him with cheerfulness, and thereby to further our own salvation. Of which
ends, if we fail, God will either take these gifts from us, because we
mis-spend them in vain, or else let us still keep them for a further and
greater judgment. Let us think in our greatness, that there is a greater
then we, who will one day call us to a reckoning, and fearfully revenge upon
us the injuries of the oppressed, and the shameful abuse of our power and
authority to injustice and cruelty. Seventhly, let us beware, that our
prosperity be not an occasion unto us of the contempt and neglect of spiritual
and heavenly things, which ordinarily happens unto those, who in their
judgments too much esteem, and in their hearts immoderately affect these
temporal blessings, as we see in the example of those who were invited to
the Kings Supper, Demas, Luke 14 18.
Judas, and many others. To which purpose, let us often meditate on the
excellency, profit, and necessity of Gods saving graces, and the ineffable
felicity of our heavenly inheritance, and how much these exceed the other. Let
us also often consider of the dignity of our souls, and how 3. Epist. of
John. verse. 2.
much they exceed in excellency our corruptible bodies, that we may take
more care to have them thrive in spiritual grace, and to rejoice in their
assurance of future glory, then to glut our bodies with sensual delights, or
to wax rich, and grow great in our earthly possessions. Let us remember that
the time will come, that our spiritual grace, which worldlings so much
contemn, will stand us in more stead, and bring unto our souls more sound
comfort then all the wealth of the world, or Monarchy of the whole earth; and
therefore that it is most extreme and sottish folly, so far to affect those
flitting and fading vanities, as to neglect in the mean time these spiritual
excellencies.

. Sect. 5 That in our prosperity we must beware of being slothful in Gods
service, and that worldly things do not become thorns and snares unto us.
Eighthly, let it be our care in the time of our prosperity, that we do not
grow more sluggish and slothful in Gods service, in Prayer, hearing the Word,
Reading, Meditation; for the more we are taken up with our earthly employments,
the less we mind these holy duties and religious exercises, as we see in the
experience of many, who have been forward in them in their sickness,
poverty, and mean estates, and wholly neglect them, or coldly, carelessly, and
formally perform them, when they enjoy health, wealth, and worldly
preferments. Yea, Gods good Children oftentimes are heerewith overtaken, having
a great dampe cast over their zeal and devotion by these worldly mists; as we
see in good Martha her Luke 10. 41, 42.
self, who by her worldly business was made more cold and careless in
attending unto Christ. Which, that we may avoid, let us consider, that when we
abound with all worldly blessings, we stand more in need of spiritual helps,
to keep us upright in our ways, and from falling into those sins, to which
this prosperous state exposes us. And that these earthly benefits being Gods
present wages, whereby he incourageth us to do him more diligent and faithful
service, it is a shameful abuse of his bounty, to be made thereby more
slothful and negligent. Ninthly, let us take heed in our prosperity, that
these worldly things, through our overmuch affecting them, do not become
thorns to choke in us the seed of Gods Word, and hinder in us the growth of
his spiritual graces, the which through our corruption they are apt to do, as
our Savior teaches us in the Parable of the Sower; partly by catching hold of
us, and hindering us Mat. 13. 22.
from going into the holy assemblies, as we see in the example of those, who
being invited to the Kings Supper, pretended excuses and would not come; and of
the Jews, who when God spoke unto them in their prosperity, Ier. 22. 21.
professed that they would not hearken unto him, nor obey his voice. And partly
by distracting our minds and hearts when we are there, so as we cannot attend
unto the things delivered; as we see in the example of the Jews, who, when the
Prophet preached unto them, with their mouths Ezech. 33. 31.
made jests, and suffered their hearts to run after covetousness. Which that
we may avoid, let us hold them in our hands, as ready to employ them in Gods
service, and for the good of our brethren, but not suffer them through carnal
love to take rooting in our hearts, which is Gods portion and fairest field,
allotted to receive the seed of his Word, for the growth of spiritual graces.
Or if the envious man has sowed any of these tares and weeds in them, let us
root them out with all care and diligence, before we go into the holy
assemblies, that they may not choke in us that spiritual seed, nor hinder
the growth of saving graces; and let us, as the Apostle exhorts us, mortify
our earthly lusts, and fly carnal concupiscence, when we desire to be
furnished with Gods graces, by the Ministry of the Word, and to follow after
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, 1. Tim. 6. 10, 11.
patience, and meekness.

. Sect. 6 That we must carefully arm our selves against the tentations unto
which this estate is endangered; and take heed that it hinder not our heavenly
happiness.
Tenthly, let it be our care when we are in prosperity, to set a double watch
over our selves, that we be not overcome with those manifold tentations, 1.
Tim. 6. 9. Deuteronomy. 7. 25.
unto which this estate does chiefly expose us, as love of the world,
earthly-mindednesse, ambition, covetousness, voluptuousness, and the rest. To
which end let us consider, that in these worldly thickets Satan cunningly
lays his most dangerous ambushments, to surprise us with his tentations at
unawares; that they are his traps and snares, in which he intangleth many, and
keeps them in his slavery; and his usual baits, whereby he allureth us to
come within the compass of his nets of perdition, unto which, who so stoop
with a greedy appetite, fall into many foolish and noisome lusts, which drown
them in destruction. Finally, that they are his common wages, which he offers
as his hire, to draw men to serve him in the works of darkness, wherewith
he has prevailed with so many, that he thought it his strongest inducement to
persuade our Savior Math. 4. 9.
Christ himself to yield unto him and do him service. And therefore as we
desire to stand in the day of tentation, to prevent our foyles, and would not
hazard the eternal salvation of our souls, let us in our prosperity watch
over our selves, and also earnestly desire the Watchman of Israel to watch over
us, that we may be preserved from all these dangers. Finally, let us, when we
enjoy prosperity and temporal blessings, above all things carefully take heed,
that they do not hinder our heavenly happiness, by being burdens on our
shoulders, which will tire us in our journey thitherwards, and as the Camels
bunch upon our backs, which will hinder us from entering into the straight
gate. The which our care must be redoubled by the greatness of the danger,
seeing it is a most hard thing for the same man to enjoy earth and heaven, to
have temporal felicity in the full fruition of worldly things, and eternal
happiness in Gods Kingdom, to have the honors, riches, and pleasures of this
life, and eternal glory, lasting riches, and heavenly joys in the life to
come. For the Apostle tells us, that not many wise men after the flesh, nor
many mighty, 1. Cor. 1. 26.
nor many noble are called unto them; and our Savior has taught us, that it
is easier for a Camel to pass through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man
Matthew. 19. 24.
to enter into the Kingdom of God. For preventing of which danger, and the
avoiding of this incomparable loss; let us use these earthly things, as though
1. Cor. 7. 31.
we used them not, or as not abusing them, making them to serve as helps in
our pilgrimage to further us in our way, by employing them to all good uses;
and when they begin through our carnal love to cling unto us, and to become
heavy burdens to hinder us in our race, let us, as the Apostle exhorts us,
cast them off, that we may run more cheerfully, and parting Heb. 12. 1.
with our superfluities for the relief of others necessities, let us retain
only so much as may further us in our journey.

. Sect. 7 That we must not too highly esteem, nor too earnestly affect and
seek after earthly things.
But especially, let us take heed, that we do not value them in our
judgments, affect them in our hearts, nor seek after them in our actions and
endeavors, more then spiritual graces and heavenly happiness; that we do not
make Idols of them, by loving them more then God, taking more pains to get
them, and more care to keep them, and more grief to lose them, then the
assurance of his favor, or to carry our selves acceptably in his sight;
finally, though we do not utterly reject them from having some place in our
hearts, yet let us beware, that we do not give them the chief seat, but let
them have entertainment, according to their own rank and condition, as
things indifferently good, and far short in excellency unto spiritual
graces and heavenly glory; that though we possess them, yet we be not
possessed of them, nor become their slaves, whereas God has made us their
Lords and governors. And that we may not thus excessiuely esteem and
immoderately love them, let us consider, that in themselves they deserve it
not, being in comparison of grace and glory, of no worth; and though they were
to others of some value, yet not unto us who profess Christianity. In
themselves they are in the former comparison to be lightly esteemed, and
slightly affected, seeing they bring not unto us any absolute, true, and
certain good, because in their own nature they have not in them any such
degree of goodness, being vain and of no solidity, whereof it is that they
do not satisfy those that have them, and not only unprofitable to their
owners, for the chief and best uses and ends, but also mixed and distasted with
many evils and miseries which do attend upon them. Or though they were good,
yet we have no certainetie, either in getting or keeping them, because both
they and we are both momentany and mutable, and are every day in danger to be
parted from one another. Yea so far are they from any absolute goodness,
that through our corruption, by which we become apt to abuse them, they are
causes, or at least occasions of much hurt; being prouocations unto all sin,
both against God, our neighbors, and our selves, deriuing unto us innumerable
evils, both temporal, and those civil and spiritual, and also eternal, as
hindering the fruition of heavenly happiness, and furthering and increasing
everlasting punishments; or though they were good in themselves, and were not
through our abuse occasions of these evils; yet they are not to be esteemed
and affected in respect of us, who are but Pilgrims on earth, having only the
use and benefit of them in our passage, and (as it were) in our Inn where we
are to make but short abode; and Citizens of heaven, and heirs of those
eternal joys and lasting happiness, which infinitely exceed all worldly
things, in which, being our Country, we do expect durable riches and
everlasting Ioh. 14. 2. Heb. 11. 9, 10.
habitations. All which reasons I do here but briefly touch, and content my
self with, namely, these general heads, because I have largely handled, and
effectually pressed them as I was able, in my second part of the Christian
Warfare.

CAP. XXXIIII.
How we may rightly use the state of prosperity, so as it may be an help unto
godliness.

. Sect. 1 That we must use Gods temporal blessings as helps unto saving graces
and spiritual duties.
But it is not sufficient, that we shun the abuses of prosperity and
temporal blessings, unless we also know how we may rightly use them; the
which use is far better then the things themselves, as furthering us unto the
fruition of much more excellent benefits, both in this life and the life to
come. The which, Solomon implies, in making this use a second and more perfect
gift of Eccles. 5. 19.
God, which he does not, like the other, cast out in common to men of all
sorts, but reserueth it as a special benefit for those that fear him; I know
Cap. 3. 12, 13.
(says he) that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do
good in his life, and also that a man should eat and drink, and enjoy the
good of his labor; it is the gift of God. And therefore in the next place I
will set down also some rules and cautions, whereby we may be directed in the
right use of prosperity, and the temporal blessings which do accompany it.
And first, we must use them as helps and effectual motives to stir us up to
unfeigned thankefulnes unto God that gave them. To which end, let us not
sacrifice to our own nets, nor ascribe the praise of them to our wisdom and
industry; but let us receive them at Gods hands, as his gifts and blessings,
that he may have the whole glory of them. Yea, let us consider that they are
his free gifts, which he bestows of his mere grace and bounty, without any
respect of our merits or worthiness, yea notwithstanding that we are less then
the least of his mercies, and worthy rather of his judgments and punishments.
That he has given them abundantly unto us, and unto many other his dear
children, with a sparing hand, and in a scant measure, who are far more
worthy of them; that he requires nothing in lieu of all his benefits, but that
we return unto him the praise Psalm. 116. 12.
that is due unto him. And finally, that if we be truly thankful unto him
for his gifts already received, he is ready to bestow far greater and better
upon us, both in this world and the world to come. Secondly, we must use them
as reasons to inflame our hearts with true and fervent love toward God, and as
fuel to nourish and increase this divine and holy flame; desiring to approve
it to be sincere and unfeigned, by affecting the giver, better then the gifts,
and by loving that also which he loves, as his Word and will, spiritual
grace, and new obedience unto his Commandments, our neighbors for his sake,
who has been so gracious and bountiful unto us above many others, and
himself for his own sake, longing more after the full fruition of his
glorious presence, then to enjoy all the contentment that the world can yield
us. And to this end let us esteem all his temporal blessings which we have
received at his hands, not simply in their own worth, but as pledges of his
favor, and loue-tokens which he has sent us to testify his affection, as
earnest pennies of a far greater bargain, and first fruits of our heavenly
harvest. Thirdly, we must so use them, as that they may not be impediments,
but helps and furtherances in the service of God, and in advancing the means
of his worship, becoming more zealous in all Religious duties out of our love
toward him that so loves us, more frequent and diligent in holy exercises, as
having by reason of our plenty and prosperity, more leisure from worldly
employments and better opportunites of performing them. More bountiful and
liberal for the erecting of Gods public worship, with all the means
thereof, where they are wanting, and in furthering and advancing them, by
giving all encouragement to Gods Ministers, and all others who join with us in
them, where they are already established. All which we shall the better do, if
we do not set our hearts and affections more on them, then upon spiritual
grace and eternal glory, or the means of deriuing both unto us. If we would
learn to esteem them, not in their own absolute worth, but as they are
means and instruments, which most benefit us, when as they advance our chief
and main ends, the glory of God, and our own salvation. If we would consider
that they are Gods present wages, which he graciously gives unto us as
temporary rewards of our imperfect service, not that they should pull us back
in holy duties, but for our better encouragement, that we might serve so
bountiful a Master with more cheerfulness. Finally, if we would remember that
we shall at the day of Judgment give account how we have employed our Lords
talents, for the advancement of his glory, and inabling of us for his service.

. Sect. 2 That we must use the blessings of prosperity for the common good of
Church and Commonwealth.
Fourthly, if we would rightly use our prosperity and Gods temporal blessings,
we must therein, not only respect our own particular, but also the common
good of the Church and Common wealth, and the private good of all our
neighbors. The former, by paying cheerfully all seasements and tributes,
which are lawfully imposed, all rights and duties which belong to all
superiors in either of them, and by offering also our free will oblation, and
voluntary contributions toward any public service, out of our great plenty,
either for the better effecting of it, or for the easing of those, who by
reason of their weak estates are not so able as we to bear the burden. The
latter, by exercising our bounty and Christian charity in almsdeeds, and in
doing the works of mercy, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting and
relieuing the poor that are sick and imprisoned. To which end, let us
consider that God has given unto us our plenty and greater store, not as unto
absolute Lords, to spend it how we list, but as unto Stewards, for the good
also of our fellow servants, who shall be called unto account, if we have been
faithful in thus employing them, and have given to every one in the household
their due portion; that where God has given much, there he will also require
much, and that they who by his bounty have much goods and exceed in riches,
do also much good (and as the Apostle speaks) Be rich in good works, ready
to 1. Tim. 6. 17, 18, 19.
distribute, and willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves a
good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal
life. Finally, let us consider that they are not so much to be valued in their
own excellency, or the present profit which they bring unto us, seeing these
commodities have so many discommodities, that it is hard to say whether
exceed; but as they are the great instruments of well-doing, and (as it were)
spacious fields, in which our bounty and charity are not confined in narrow
limits, but may take large liberty to walk abroad, and to exercise themselves
unto full contentment. Whereby as we are enabled to do good unto many, so
most of all to our selves; seeing for the present we purchase of them their
best jewels at low rates, even their love, hearts, and fervent prayers, for
some poor pittance of earthly trifles; and for the time to come, the Lord will
infinitely reward of his mere grace and large bounty, these gifts of ours
which he has first given us, as though we were not Stewards but Owners, and
in our own right had bestowed them, not so much upon the poor, as upon Jesus
Christ himself, as he will before the Saints and Angels profess at the day of
Judgment. Mat. 25. 34.
The which excellent duty is so necessary unto the exercise of a godly life,
and is so much neglected in this cold and uncharitable age, not only amongst
gripple and greedy worldlings, who are ready rather to strip the poor, then to
clothe them, and to pull the meat out of their mouths, by depriving them
through oppression of their means, then to feed and nourish them; but even
among professors of Religion, who seeming to make conscience of religious
duties, are notwithstanding exceeding cold in their devotion and charity; that
I would much more fully and effectually have insisted upon and pressed it, had
I not already published a full Treatise of this argument.

. Sect. 3 Three other Cautions to be observed for the right use of prosperity.
Fifthly, unto the right use of prosperity and temporal benefits there is
required, that we use them as pilgrims and strangers, and not as Citizens of
the world; for so Gods Saints have always acknowledged themselves, Genesis 47. 9.
Psalm. 39. 12 Heb. 11. 9, 13. and 13. 14. 1. Pet. 2. 11. Heb. 12. 1. Phil. 3.
20. Col. 3. 1, 2.
and that they had here no continuing city, but sought one to come. The
consideration whereof must weane our hearts and affections from the immoderate
love of the world and earthly vanities, and cause us to fix them on heaven and
heavenly things, which is our country and place of residence, to fight against
our carnal lusts which fight against our souls; and to contemn and cast away
whatsoever becomes an hindrance in our journey toward our heavenly home. And
seeing we are Citizens of heaven, we must have our conversation there,
seeking those things which are above, and not those which are beneath, and
think that nothing more does misbeseeme us, then that being the children of
God, and heirs apparent to his heavenly Kingdom, we should like base slaves
spend our time and strength in the devils drudgerie, and in toyling in the
works of darkness and servitude of sin, for the contemptible wages of earthly
vanities. Sixthly, we must use them not as durable and permanent riches and
inheritances, but as things momentany and mutable, which are ready daily and
hourly to leave us, and we them. And therefore our best course will be to
use so these flitting vanities, as that they may further our assurance of our
heavenly patrimony, which is permanent and everlasting; and as our Savior
counsaileth us, to make us friends of the Mammon of iniquity, by using them as
helps and instruments to further us in the works of Luke 16. 9.
mercy, that when they are taken from us, and we from them, we may be
received into heavenly habitations. Finally, if we would rightly use our
prosperity and temporal blessings, we must not suffer our minds and hearts
to rest upon them, but use them only as steps whereby we may mount up aloft
in heavenly meditations and desires. As when we see any beauty or excellency
in the creatures, to think how infinitely they exceed in the Creator from
whom they have them; when we are ready with the Queen of Sheba to think our
selves happy in hearing the wisdom of an earthly Solomon, to raise our
minds higher, and to think on their happiness, who attain unto the vision
and fruition of God, and hear with rauishing admiration his all-knowing and
infinite wisdom. When we are delighted with the society of Gods Saints in
earth, who like our selves are full of imperfections, to take occasion hereby
of meditating of that felicity we shall have in our heavenly fellowship, when
both they and we shall be perfected in love and louelynesse. When we take
pleasure in our earthly prosperity, honors, and riches, mixed with many
miseries, and are but Gods common gifts, which he gives in as great plenty to
his slaves as to his sons, to his enemies as well as unto his friends, nor to
rest in these worldly delights, and to say with Peter in another case, It is
good being here, but raise our minds and hearts by these occasions, to an
higher pitch; thinking how incomparably greater our joy shall be, when we shall
attain unto the full fruition of our heavenly happiness, which shall not be
embittered with any misery, and to the inheritance which God has prepared in
peculiar for his Sons and Saints in whom he is chiefly delighted. And so
shall we not dote in our worldly and carnal love, nor have our minds and
hearts caught and entangled in this birdlime of worldly vanities; but use them
only for present necessity and refreshing, that so we may again like Eagles
leave the earth, and mount aloft in heavenly meditations and desires.

. Sect. 4 Of the right use of apparel.
And these things are generally required to the right use of our prosperity,
and the temporal blessings which do accompany it. We might add some special
directions concerning the right use of the chief of them. Amongst which the
most ordinary and necessary, are food and apparel; of the former whereof I
have spoken before, and therefore will only in Christ. Warf. second part.
some brief manner say something of the latter, of which I have entreated more
largely in another place. And first let us know, that we must use our apparel
to those right ends for which they were ordained, that is, for necessity of
nature to cover our nakedness, and to keep us from the injuries of the
weather, and for comeliness, ornament, and sober delight. In which respect
those who profess Christianity, must carefully avoid in the use of their
apparel, pride and vain glory, of which there is little cause, if we
consider their original; which was to hide our shame, the fruit of our sin;
that the richest roabes are no special privileges belonging to the faithful,
seeing Pagans and Heathens, worldly and wicked men and women do most exceed
in them; and finally, that when we have made our selves as brave as Solomon in
all his royalty, yet the Lillies and flowers of the field will far excel us
in their native beauty and bravery. And seeing they were given to cover our
shame, hide our nakedness, and to preserve us from the injuries of the
weather, therefore do those fail of their end, who out of pride, vanity and
wantonness, do use such as do discover them, namely, such women who lay open
their naked breasts to public view, as ensigns of their own vanity, and
alluring baits to draw others unto folly. Finally, seeing it was given for
ornament, comeliness and honest delight, they offend on the contrary side, who
being advanced to high places, fit not their apparel in some moderate sort to
their rank and calling, but go in sordid and base clothes, out of a penurious
mind, in a rich estate, to spare their purses and save charges. But of this I
shall need to say little, being a rare fault in these days, wherein almost
all offend, not only carnal worldlings, but also professors of Religion as
much as they, in excessive bravery above their callings. But seeing there are
extremes on both sides, what rules can be given for the observing of the
mean? Surely no particular rules of direction are expressed in the Scriptures,
only we are to frame our directions from some generals, as that we must in
all these things use Christian frugality and sobriety, modesty and prudence.
As first, in respect of the materials of our apparel, we must not be excessive
in cost, nor go more richly then becomes our place and calling, but be
herein frugall in our expenses, that we may have to bestow upon better uses.
Neither do I know how they will answer it before God, who being as Stewards
entrusted with Gods talents, do spend them for the most part in superfluous
cost about their own apparel, and let many of their fellow servants perish
for want of clothing to cover their nakedness. In respect of the form, we
ought to use Christian sobriety and modesty, abstaining from such habits and
fashions as are vain and fantastical, light and garish, the which is
forbidden by the Apostle Peter to Christian Matrons. 1. Pet. 3. 3.
Secondly, from such as belong not to our sex, as for the man to be womanish,
or the woman mannish in their apparel; which tends to make the one
effeminate, the other impudent, and both of them wanton, lascivious and
luxurious; and is therefore expressly forbidden in the Word Deuteronomy. 22. 5.
of God, as an horrible abomination in his sight. Thirdly, we must abstain
from strange attire, whether it be such as is strange, in respect of diverse
Countries; in which regard we ought not (as it is the common custom of our
people) to imitate the fashions of other nations, which sin being also
brought into fashion, is scarce observed, but yet so great in Gods sight, that
he threatens to punish it, even in Princes themselves and Kings Zeph. 1. 8.
children, and all others that clothe themselves in strange apparel; or
whether it be strange in respect of our profession; as when those that
profess Religion, and that they are Citizens of the new Jerusalem, conform
themselves to the vain, fantastical, and garish fashions of the most
profane worldlings, who are mere strangers from the Commonwealth of Israel,
which is so ordinary in these days, that men cannot, and (I fear) God will
not, when he comes to visit, put any difference between the one and the
other. Finally, we must observe Christian prudence in the fashions of our
apparel, the property whereof is to be choice in choosing them, and then
constant in keeping them. In which respect, we are, as much as we can, to
avoid the common abuse of changing fashions, almost as often as the Moon, which
is a notable sign, not only of pride and vaineglory; but also of vanity and
extreme folly, which is the mother of lightness and inconstancy; seeing men
often change, because they have not wit to choose the best, or having chosen
it, do want wit to keep their choice. The which is the more to be abhorred,
and (as much as may be) to be reformed amongst Christians, in respect of the
needless cost and great damage which this often change of fashions brings,
not only on particular persons, but even upon our whole Country and
Commonwealth: I say as much as may be; seeing they can be but amongst the
last that come into these fashions, the stream of this corruption being so
violent, that it carries all with it, making them to be pointed at with the
finger, and derided as odd and fantastical, who keep a fashion that all
have left. In which regard it were much to be wished, that this great abuse of
apparel, both for matter and form, which cannot be amended by any private
persons, might be reformed by public authority and general consent of the
whole Estates.

CAP. XXXV.
How we ought to behave our selves in the estate of affliction, so as we may
profit thereby in all saving graces.

. Sect. 1 What afflictions are, and the diverse kinds of them.
But adversity and afflictions take up no less a part of the Christian man's
life, seeing there is no day passes, which brings Job 5. 7.
not with it some crosses and miseries; Man being borne unto trouble, as the
sparks fly upward. In which respect, it is necessary that we add some
directions for the well-carrying of our selves in this estate. By afflictions,
I understand all miseries incident unto this life, which are the fruits of
sin, and sent of God, either as punishments upon the wicked, to satisfy the
justice of a severe Judge, or as chastisements inflicted upon the faithful, by
the hand of a gracious Father, for their correction and amendment. All things
also which cross our desires, and do molest and grieve us, either in their
own nature, or in our opinion and conceit, which are as innumerable in their
multitude, and intolerable in their supposed weight, as those which are so in
deed and truth. Afflictions that have some true existence, are of diverse kinds;
first, public, as wars, plague, famine, ill government in Magistrates,
rebellion and disobedience in subjects, open persecution for the profession of
the Truth, suppressing of the Ministry, and the light of the Gospel and such
like. Secondly, such as fall out in societies between us and others; as
unfaithful dealing and fraudulent courses, used by those who commerce with us,
wrongs and oppressions, hard censures and ill reports, discourtesie and
unkindness from neighbors and friends, with many others of like nature.
Thirdly, such as are domestical and in our own families; as disobedience and
unruliness, unthriftiness and untowardness; want of love and duty in our
children; crosnesse and frowardness, riot and wastefulnesse, negligence and
unfaithfulness in servants, ill success in our worldly business, damage and
hurt in household commodities and the rest. Finally, such as are personal, as
sores and sickenesses, poverty and want of necessaries, exile, imprisonment,
shame, contempt, loss of goods or friends, with innumerable others which are
daily incident to the life of man.

. Sect. 2 How we ought to prepare our selves before afflictions come, that we
may be able to bear them with patience when they come.
In which estate of adversity and afflictions, accompanied with such
innumerable evils and miseries of all kinds, if we would rightly and as we
ought, carry and demean our selves so as we should receive no damage to our
spiritual estate, nor hindrance to our salvation; yea for the present, make
our troubles and griefs more easy and tolerable; there are some things to be
done before they happen, and some things when they have already light upon us.
Before we are to labor in mortifying and subduing of our inordinate affections
and unruly passions, that they may become in all things subject to the will of
God, and in the denying of our selves and our own wills, that we may in all
estates submit our persons, goods, and lives to his good pleasure, and so take
up our cross and follow Christ. More especially, we must seek to moderate our
fear, which aggrauates our griefs, and is oftentimes more troublesome then
the evil feared; confine our unlimited hopes, which when they are crossed, as
much afflict us, as the loss of those comforts which we truly enjoy; stint our
desires according to the necessity of nature, and not leave them to the
liberty of inordinate concupiscence; bridle and subdue our rash anger, which
oppresses us with waights of our own making, and makes a mountain of every
Molehill; mortify our melancholic discontent by a true faith, which will
persuade us that that estate is best for us, in which God has placed us; pull
down our pride and haughtiness of spirit, which is one chief cause of
impatiency, murmuring and repining under the cross; as though we were worse
dealt with then we deserve; cast away all emulation in prosperity, which in our
afflictions will vex us as much in the sight of others rising, as in the sense
of our own fall. Finally, we must not in our prosperity be excessive in our
joy, for then in our adversity we will be as immoderate in our grief,
lighting by so much the more heavily in our downe-fall of sorrow, by how much
we fell higher from the top of joy. Secondly, we must not feign afflictions
unto our selves, nor make those Hest. 5. 13.
things become crosses by a false conceit, which others would esteem comforts
and benefits. We must not become miserable by thinking our selves so, nor make
unto our selves burdens by a false apprehension, when as God does not impose
any upon us. Thirdly, we must not by fear anticipate our grief, nor make our
selves miserable before our time, by pulling crosses presently upon us, through
a fearful and cowardly expectation, which either would never happen, or not
of a long season. Fourthly, though we must not anticipate them by fear, nor
make our selves presently miserable, because we suppose we shall be so in the
time to come, yet we must by wise and Christian providence foresee them before
they happen, not only that we may use all good means to prevent them, but if
they must needs befall us, that we may be prepared and so armed with
patience, that they may not hurt us. For that which is (it may be) fabulously
reported of the Cockatrice, is here rightly moralized; If we see them first
by a wise and working providence, they will lose all their vigor and venom,
dye and do us no harm; but if they first reflect upon us their malignant
eyes, before we discern their approaching, they will hurt and kill our souls
with their poisonous influences. Fifthly, we must not in our prosperity set
our hearts and affections upon any worldly things or temporal benefits; for
they who immoderately love them when they have them, will grieve as
immoderately when they lose them; and if we look upon them as fee-simples and
perpetuities, we shall be more impatient in our sorrow when we are turned out of
them as tenants at will. Sixthly, we must not either contemn afflictions before
they assault us, nor yet conceive that they are so strong and irresistable,
that it is in vain to oppose their fury. For a contemned enemy, though weak,
gets an easy conquest, because we being unprepared, he finds no
resistance. And he that is possessed with too much fear, out of an opinion of
his enemies strength and his own weakness, is ready to fly or yield before
the skirmish; And therefore as we must not securely presume of victory, in
confidence of our own strength and our enemies weakness; so must we be bold
and courageous in the assurance of Gods assistance, and as the Apostle
speaks, neither despise the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when we are
rebuked of him. Heb. 12. 6.
Lastly, we must take heed, that we do not wilfully run into afflictions,
but use all lawful means to prevent them before they come, or to be freed
from them when they are inflicted. For he that loves danger, shall perish in
it, and he that voluntarily when he needs not, lays a cross upon his own
shoulders; has no promise that God will take it off. We must drink of this
bitter cup, but it is only when our heavenly Father does put it into our
hands, otherwise we cannot say that we are chastized by him, but that we
scourge our selves with whips of our own making, like the Lion which is said
to provoke himself to anger, when there is none to hurt him, by beating
himself with his own tail. And as we must not voluntarily take crosses upon
us when we may lawfully avoid them; so may we not lie under them still, when
God gives us lawful means to be freed from them; but as we are to pray that
we may not be led into tentation, so also that we may be delivered from evil.

. Sect. 3 That we must bear our afflictions with patience, and what things are
required heereunto.
And these are the rules which are to be observed before afflictions befall
us. In our afflictions, the main duty to be performed, is, that we bear them
with patience, which is that passive obedience whereby we submit our selves
unto Gods will, with all meekness, humility, and contentation in all estates,
bearing his fatherly chastisements quietly, constantly, and willingly, till he
deliver us, and give unto us lawful means to be freed from our afflictions.
So that if we would rightly demean our selves in the time of our troubles,
we must bear them with patience, unto which is required, first, obedience,
humility, and contentation, whereby we meekely submit our selves unto Gods
good pleasure to be chastized of him, and to bear that cross which he
imposes, saying with Eli, It is the 1. Sam. 3. 18.
Lord, let him do what seems good unto him; and with David, Here I am, 2.
Sam. 15. 26.
let him do unto me, as it seems good in his eyes; and with our Savior
Christ; Not as I will, but as thou will. Secondly, that we bear our cross
Mat. 26. 39, 42.
quietly, with David, not opening our mouths to murmr and mutter, Psalm. 39.
9.
because it is the Lord that has imposed it, and professing with Job, that we
will lay our hands upon our mouths, keep silence, and speak no more. And Job
39. 37.
howsoever we may and ought to grieve moderately in our afflictions, as being
the chastizements of our heavenly Father, for our sins, which the Apostle
tells us we must not despise, yet we must labor as much as may Heb. 12. 6.
Ier. 5. 3.
be, to be free from tumultuous passion, from repining against Gods providence,
or raging against the inferior means of our afflictions, which are but as
rods in his hands; imitating as near as we can the example of our Savior
Christ, who was brought out as a sheep to the slaughter, and as Esa. 53. 7.
a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so opened he not his mouth. Thirdly,
there is required constancy, whereby we resolve to bear our burden so long,
till God who laid it upon us, do put to his helping hand and take it off; that
is, we must not use unlawful means to shift it from us, nor murmr against
Gods providence whilst it lies heavy upon us, but hold out to bear it with
all patience, till God give us lawful means to be eased of it. Which that we
may do, we must, after one assault is past, prepare our selves for another,
and like good Pilots in a storm, after we have broken many billows, we are
not to be secure, but still be in readiness expecting others, never ceasing
our care and diligence till, we be safely arrived in the Haven of rest. And
this our Savior has warned us of, when he says, that he who will be his
Disciple, must take up his cross daily and follow him; Luke 9. 23.
And the Apostle James would not have our patience, only to begin well, but to
have her perfect work and lack nothing. Lastly, there is required to Iam. 1.
4.
this patience, that we bear our afflictions willingly and cheerfully; not
because we can do no otherwise, but with all alacrity and readiness, as Romans
8. 18, 28. 2. Cor. 4. 17.
being sent of God, who by his wisdom and power can; and in respect of his
goodness and truth, will dispose of them for our good. And this our
cheerfulness must show it self in our readiness to praise and magnify Gods
Name: not so much in regard of the afflictions themselves (though in respect of
that greater measure, which our sins have deserved, we have in our greatest
afflictions just cause to bless God with Job, Job 1. 21.
and with the Church to acknowledge the mercies of the Lord, in that we Ier. 3.
22.
are not utterly consumed) as in regard of his wisdom, goodness, and truth,
whereby he causes them to work together for the best, and to serve as means
to further our salvation. And this the Apostle Peter requires, that if any man
suffer as a Christian, he should not be ashamed, but glorify God 1. Pet. 4. 16.
on this behalf. The which was practiced by Paul and Silas, who when they Act.
16. 25.
were cast into the dungeon, and after they were cruelly whipped, put into the
stocks, bore all with patience, and expressed their thankfulness by singing
of Psalms. Secondly, our cheerfulness must show it self, by our spiritual
rejoicing and joy in the holy Ghost; not in respect of our afflictions
themselves, which in their own nature, or as they are fruits of sin, do
justly bring with them grief and mourning, but in respect of the fruits and
benefits, which through Gods infinite wisdom and goodness, they bring unto
us in this life and the life to come. And in this regard our Savior wills
his Disciples to rejoice in their persecutions, because their reward Mat. 5.
11, 12.
was great in heaven. The which they accordingly performed, rejoicing when they
were beat at the commandment of the Council, because they were thought worthy
to suffer rebuke for Christ's Name. Unto Act. 5. 41. Romans 5. 3. 1. These. 1. 6.
which high degrees of patience, though we cannot attain in any perfection,
yet must we labor and strive after them, and though we cannot hit the mark
of perfection, yet we must shoot as near it as we can, being Iam. 1. 5.
in the mean time sorry for our wants and infirmities; and using all good
means whereby they may be supplied.

. Sect. 4 Of the means of patience, first, because God is the Author of all
our afflictions.
Now the chief means whereby we may attain unto patience in our
tribulations, are principally two; the first, is fervent and effectual prayer;
Iam. 1. 5. 2. Cor. 13. 4. Romans 15. 5. Phil. 4. 13.
according to that of the Apostle James; If any of you lack wisdom, (that
is, to bear the cross of which he there speaks) let him ask it of God,
which gives to men liberally, reproaching none, and it shall be given him. For
it is God alone who does comfort us in all our tribulations. He is the God of
patience and consolation, the Father of mercies, and God of all comforts, by
whose wisdom directing us, and power assisting us, we are able to do all
things, and preserved from sinking under the heauiest afflictions. The second
help and means of working patience in afflictions, is meditation upon such
reasons as may cause and begin it where it is not, and increase it where it is
already begun. And these concern either the enduring of the cross, or the end
and issue. The former are simple, or comparatiue. The simple reasons arise
either from the causes, which are efficient or final, or from the subject and
adjuncts of our afflictions. And first, in our meditations we are to consider,
that God himself is chief cause and principal Author of all our afflictions,
whatsoever be the means and instruments. The which may confirm our patience,
and comfort us in our afflictions, seeing they must needs be good and just, as
coming from him who is the chief Goodness in himself, and the Author and
fountain of all goodness which is in the creatures. Secondly, that he has
not only in some general manner in his eternal counsel preordained our
afflictions, and left all the rest to be disposed by chance and fortune, but
that he specially orders and rules them with his most wise, just, and
gracious providence, both in respect of their manner, measure, and continuance,
making the ends of all inferior causes to serve for his supreme ends, which
are his glory and our salvation. Thirdly, that the meritorious causes of all
our afflictions are our sins, which are so many and grievous, that our
greatest afflictions are far less and lighter, then by our sins we have
justly deserved. Fourthly, that our afflictions are not signs of Gods hatred,
nor the punishments of a just Judge, but the chastisements and corrections of a
gracious Father; and that they proceed from his mere love; the which
appears, first, in the measure of our afflictions, both in respect of their
quantity and time of continuance. For he has appointed a measure which cannot
be exceeded, and this quantity is small and light; and how long also they shall
last and continue, the which time is short and momentany, in comparison of that
super-excellent and eternal weight of glory which they shall cause unto us.
Yea he so measures our afflictions unto us, as that they do not exceed our
ability to endure 1. Cor. 10. 13.
them; seeing he is always ready to lessen our burden, or to increase our
strength that we may be able to bear it. Neither does the Lord take delight in
our smart, to inflict upon us more then is needful, but measures our
afflictions, not according to desert, but so much only as is necessary for his
own glory and our salvation.

. Sect. 4 That our afflictions tend to the setting forth of Gods glory.
Fifthly, let us also consider the ends of our afflictions, which God
propounds unto them, wherein his great love shines and appears. The first
and chief whereof, is his own glory, seeing he manifests his power and
goodness, by assisting us in our afflictions, and by taking occasion thereby
to show and try his spiritual graces which he has bestowed upon us; the which
should comfort us in all our troubles, seeing God hereby vouchsafes us this
high privilege to be instruments of his glory. The second end, is the good
both of our neighbors and our selves. They receive much good by our
afflictions; seeing they learn by our example to fear God in his judgments,
and are restrained from the same sins which they see corrected in us.
Secondly, as we are ensamples of Gods graces shining in this fiery trial, and
also through our infirmities of humane frailty, that seeing Gods perfection in
our imperfections, and his power and wisdom in our folly and weakness, they
may take occasion to glorify him. Thirdly, because by our afflictions we are
made more compassionate and more able and ready to comfort others, with those
consolations wherewith our selves have been comforted. The which also should
make us patient in our troubles, yea even to be thankful, and greatly to
rejoice, in that God uses us as means and instruments of our neighbors good,
whom we ought to love as our selves, and as much as in us lies, to help them
in all things which may further their salvation.

. Sect. 5 That God uses our afflictions as means of our own good.
Secondly let us consider, that the Lord uses our afflictions as notable
means of our own good, and of deriuing unto us many singular benefits, both
in respect of this life and the life to come. For first he uses them for
trials, for the discovery of those spiritual graces which he has given us;
not unto himself, who knowing all things, needs no such helps, but unto us
and others, that he may be glorified in them, and take occasion thereby to
glorify us, by crowning his gifts, when by this Iam. 1. 12.
trial they are approved, and may also edify those who observe them in us,
and move them to follow our good example. And likewise for the making known
of our infirmities and corruptions, that we may be truly humbled in the sight
and sense of them. In which regard, our greatest trials not exceeding our
strength, as God has promised, should bring unto us an answerable measure of
sound comfort, seeing they are assured signs unto us of the greatest measure
of saving graces in us. Secondly, he uses them as effectual means to
further our conversion, fitting and preparing us thereby for the more diligent
hearing of the Word, and so working in us by both joined together, true
contrition and humiliation. Thirdly, he uses them as special means to
prevent sin, and to preserve us from falling into it; and also to mortify
and subdue those corruptions, by all good means, which adhere and cleave unto
us; as pride, carnal concupiscence, self-love, and love of the world. The
which should greatly increase our patience, and comfort us in afflictions: for
if we are willing to endure so much, to be eased of bodily and temporal evil,
how much more should we chearefully endure any afflictions, to be Heb. 12. 9.
freed from those which are spiritual and everlasting, as the Apostle
reasons? Fourthly, he uses them as notable helps to increase in us all his
spiritual graces; as saving knowledge and remembrance of God, a lively faith,
unfeigned repentance, firm affiance, hope, love, fear, patience, and humility,
both by making us more careful in the use of the means whereby they are begun
and increased in us, and by exercising them with these trials: And also to
bring forth the fruits of these graces by new obedience, prayer, and more
zealous performance of all other duties of his service. Finally, by our
afflictions, the Lord also makes us more forward to embrace all virtues, and
to perform all Christian duties, which concern both our neighbors and our
selves. For whereas prosperity usually incourageth men to wrong and oppression,
affliction being sanctified unto us, is a notable motive to persuade us to
carry our selves justly in all our actions; to be merciful and compassionate
toward others in their miseries; and to be meek, humble and courteous
toward all men. So also they increase the knowledge of our selves, our
courage, Christian fortitude and strength to bear our crosses and miseries, as
being the spiritual exercise of these graces, and finally our temperance,
sobriety, modesty, chastity, as it were easy to show, if we could here insist
in these particulars. In respect also of the life to come, the Lord by our
affliction deriueth much good unto us, using them as effectual means, to
preserve us from condemnation, and to further our eternal glory and
happiness, both by assuring us of these joys (they serving as signs of our
adoption and salvation) and by fitting and preparing us by them for his
heavenly Kingdom, by making them to serve as a way to bring us thither, and to
keep us from wandering in the broad way that leads to destruction. Yea, he
makes them to serve as means to increase our glory and heavenly joys,
seeing, according to the measure of our afflictions, he gives unto us an
answerable measure of his graces, that we may be able to bear them, and
according to the measure of our graces, he proportioneth our glory and future
happiness.

. Sect. 6 That this world is a place destinated to afflictions and trials.
From the subject place of our afflictions also, we may confirm our patience,
and increase our comfort. For God has appointed us in this world to suffer
afflictions, and to inherit happiness in the life to come; he has made it
for a place of trial and tentation, preparation and spiritual exercise; not
for a Paradise of delight, but for a pilgrimage, and therefore we must look for
pilgrims entertainment; for a place, not of triumph, but of warfare, and
therefore we must expect conflicts, and the hard usage of poor Soldiers.
Again, we may comfort our selves by considering the adjuncts of our
afflictions, as their necessity, for we are preordained unto them, as being
necessary for the effecting the great work of our salvation, and therefore it
is in vain to struggle with them, seeing thereby we may gaul our necks, but
not shake off our yoke, their manifold profit, of which I have spoken, their
shortness of continuance, and lightness in respect of that weight of glory,
which they shall cause unto us. Finally, we may be comforted by considering the
fellowship and assistance which we have in all our afflictions, for we have
more with us then are against us; as innumerable numbers of holy Angels which
pitch their tents about us, and watch over us to keep us safe in all our ways;
Jesus Christ also, who as our yokefellow bears greatest weight, and as our
Head co^municateth with us in all our griefs, and assisteth us in our crosses
and calamities; and God himself who is all-sufficient, and no less ready and
able to uphold us with the one hand, then to wrestle with us, and load us with
the other.

. Sect. 7 That all the faithful have been partakers of the like, or greater
afflictions with us.
And these are the comforts which arise out of a simple consideration of our
afflictions; besides which, there are others which may be raised by comparing
our lesser afflictions, with those greater which others have and shall suffer.
For as the Scriptures foretell these afflictions of the faithful, so they show
that it has always been their portion to bear them; yea, look for the most
part how much they have excelled in Gods graces, and so much they have exceeded
in the measure of their afflictions, as we may observe in the examples of Adam,
Abel, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Job, David, Paul, and many others. But
especially we may comfort our selves in our greatest afflictions, by
considering how light and small they are, in comparison of those grievous
punishments, which Christ the Son of Gods love did suffer for us both in his
life and death. All which he suffered being just and innocent, for our sins,
leaving us an example who are his members, to follow his steps in the same way
that leads to happiness; seeing God has preordained those to be like Christ
in his sufferings, who shall be like unto him in glory. Finally, we may comfort
our selves, by comparing our afflictions with the punishments of the wicked,
from which Christ has freed us; seeing theirs are intolerable, but ours light
and easy; theirs everlasting, but ours short and momentany; notwithstanding
that our own consciences will tell us, that our sins, both in their quantity and
quality, number and weight, have much exceeded many of theirs. And lastly, by
co^paring them with our future joys and heavenly happiness, in which respect
the Apostle tells, that the afflictions Romans 8 18.
of this present world, are not worthy the glory that shall be revealed: for
they are (as he says in another place) light and momentany, but they shall 2.
Cor. 4. 17.
cause unto us a far most excellent, and an eternal weight of glory.

. Sect. 8 Comforts arising from the good issue of all our afflictions.
And thus we may comfort our selves with present consolations whilst we endure
the cross. Besides which, there are others which arise from their issue and
end, and from our assurance which we have of our deliverance out of our
afflictions, in that time which is most fit and seasonable for Gods glory and
our salvation; seeing we have his promise for it, who is faithful and true,
good and gracious unto all that trust in him. And in the mean time he is
present with us to hear, help, and relieve us, who is most wise and
all-sufficient, taking notice of all our troubles, and knowing how to deliver
us in due time. Now if the Lord for causes best known to himself, deferreth
to hear, help, and deliver us, we must wait his leisure, and use all good
means to strengthen our faith, hope, and patience, by meditating on his
gracious promises, and on their truth and infallibility, on his infinite
wisdom, which knows better then we when our deliverance is most seasonable,
and his omnipotent power and all sufficiency, whereby he is able to effect it
when he pleases. By considering also that God usually deferreth to help
those, whom he has most strengthened in grace, and who are most dear unto
him, but never wholly failed to perform his promises at last to those who have
waited upon him. Finally, that he deferreth to deliver us for the furthering of
our eternal good and salvation; and that he waits upon us to save and
deliver us in the fittest time; and therefore there is great reason that we
should wait upon him. And these are the Esa. 30. 18.
means for the strengthening of our faith, hope, and patience, when God
deferreth to deliver us, which respect himself and his dealing with us;
besides which there are others that respect our selves, which is, first that
we often renew our repentance, without which, we can have no hope of help and
deliverance. Secondly, that we renew our faith in Gods promises, the which is
the condition of the Covenant of grace between God and us, whereby he has
assured us of them. Thirdly, that we humbly submit our selves to Gods good
pleasure, which is one maine end why God corrects us, unto which when he has
attained, he will cease his chastisements, and deliver us from our afflictions.
Fourthly, that we trust in God at all times, both in the presence, and absence
of inferior means. Fifthly, we must be frequent and fervent in Prayer; and
lastly, when we are freed from any afflictions, we must be thankful, and
render unto God praise and thanksgiving. And thus with as much breuity as I
could, I have set down how we are to carry our selves in the time of our
afflictions; if any need or desire to have these heads and maine points more
fully and largely handled, I refer them to the third part of my Christian
Warfare, where I purposely have entreated of this subject.

CAP. XXXVI.
Of those Christian duties which are to be performed in the Evening and Night.

. Sect. 1 That the Evening must not be spent in sloth and idleness.
Having entreated of those Christian duties belonging to the day; it now
follows that we set down some directions how we are to behave our selves
when the day is ended. And these are such as concern our carriage in the
Evening, before we go to rest; or afterward, when we are laid in our beds.
In the Evening, if we be not taken up with the duties of our callings, wherein
in the day we were employed (as it is the case of many, whose states, trades,
and necessary occasions require the continuance of their labors) we must not
upon the cessation of our pains, think our selves at full liberty to think,
speak, and do what we list (as it is the practice of many, who when they
cannot work any longer in their callings, spend their long Euenings in the
winter season, either in sloth and idleness, or in unlawful gaming, or in
vain, fruitless, and oftentimes hurtful and unsavory communication, by
traducing their absent neighbors, and blemishing their credits with slanders
or uncharitable truths, or corrupting those that are present, by light and
wanton discourses) but we must be careful of spending our precious time in
some meditations, speeches, and actions which are profitable for our selves,
and for the edification of those that are in our company and society. For
though it may be very lawful, and sometime necessary, after our wearisome
businesses are dispatched, to take some liberty, and to spend some convenient
time in resting of our bodies, or refreshing our minds with some honest
recreations; yet me thinks it is too much, that so great a part of our time
should be so employed; seeing our lives are so short and uncertain, and our
affairs of much greater weight and importance, which tend mainely to the
advancement of Gods glory and our own salvation, being so many, might with
much more profit and true comfort challenge unto them a great part of this
time. In which regard, though I would not prescribe laws to bind the
consciences of my brethren, but leave unto them their liberty to be guided
with Christian prudence, yet I would, as in other things, so herein also give
my advice; namely, that they would improoue this time to the best, as becomes
wise redeemers of it, so as they may give some good account of it unto God when
he calls them unto it; and not think that he has given unto them the
comfortable warmth of the fire, to make them freeze harder in the dregs of
sin, nor the light of their candles, that they should act by them the works
of darkness, but that he bestows upon these corporal comforts, that they
might be furtherances unto their souls in the spiritual growth, using such
good exercises as may tend to the inlightening of their minds in the knowledge
of God and his will, and may warm their hearts with true and fervent zeal in
the loving and embracing of them.

. Sect. 2 Of the Evening exercises, as Meditation, reading, and Christian
conferences.
And first, it were fit that some little part of this time, after the
surceasing of our labors were spent in some short meditation, wherein we are
to recount and recall to our remembrance the special favors and mercies of
God, which in the day past he has vouchsafed unto us, either in delivering us
from dangers corporal or spiritual, of sin or of punishment, or in
bestowing upon us real and positive benefits, as his blessing upon our
labors, whereby they have prospered under our hands, the comfort of his
creatures, the love and assistance of our friends, and such like: lifting up
our hearts unto God in the acknowledgement of these benefits, and rendering unto
him such thanks and praise as is due unto him. Secondly, as we have best
opportunity, both in respect of our leisure and our company, it were good to
spend some part of this time in reading of the Scriptures, or other holy and
religious writings, the Histories of the Church, or some such Civil and Moral
Books and Stories, as may make us grow in grace and spiritual wisdom, or at
least, in honest prudence, whereby we may be directed for the better carriage
of our selves in the affairs of this life, by adding unto our own knowledge
the wisdom of others, and the experience of former times. Thirdly, as
occasion serves, it is good to spend some part of this time in Christian
conferences, either with our friends and familiars that accompany us, or with
those of our own family, husbands, wives, children, servants, laboring in our
speeches to build up one another in all saving grace, and to be mutually
bettered in the more clear understanding of the truth, more hearty embracing
it in our hearts and affections, and the more zealous and fruitful practice of
it in our lives. But though I chiefly commend these Christian and religious
conferences, yet would I not be so taken, as though I meant hereby to exclude
all others, for it is lawful also to spend some of our time in civil
discourses, and about the affairs of this life, the duties of our callings,
our worldly estates, the disposing and ordering of our business, or any other
subject not idle, unprofitable, or sinful, which present occasion shall offer
unto us as most seasonable. Only I would advise, that we do not (as it is
the common custom amongst the most) spend our time so wholly about these, as
that we do thereby exclude the other, which in their nature are much more
excellent, and for our use far more profitable and necessary. Lastly, we
must spend some part of this time in praising God by singing of Psalms, as our
company and occasions will give us opportunity; but above all other exercises,
we must constantly, either before or after Supper (as in our discretion we
see best and fittest for the assembling of our company) pray with our families,
as before we gave direction for the like exercise in the Morning; Of both
which, my purpose is (God assisting) to set down some forms in the end of
this Work, for the direction and benefit of weaker Christians.

. Sect. 3 Duties to be done at our going to bed.
And these are the duties which are to be performed in the evening. In the
night we are also to watch over our thoughts and actions, that they may in some
sort be suitable to those in the day, and that in all of them we may carry our
selves so as becomes Christians. And in this regard there are some duties to
be performed at our going to bed, and some in the rest of the night. At our
going to bed we are generally to consider, that we are still in the sight and
presence of God, who sees our downe-lying and our vprising, and searches our
most secret actions, yea even our hearts and reins. And that there is also a
guard of holy Angels, who are appointed by our great Lord, to pitch their tents
about us, and to watch over us, that they may preserve us from all perils and
dangers, unto which we are, waking and sleeping, continually subject. In
regard of which glorious and holy presence, we are as carefully and
conscionably to behave our selves in all Christian duties, as if all the world
should look upon us. The first whereof is, that at our lying down, when all
things being quiet about us, and we freed from all worldly distractions, we
spend some little time in holy meditations, calling to our remembrance, and
examining our conversation, how we have behaved our selves in the performance
of all Christian duties required of us in the day past, of which we have before
spoken. As first, how we have performed those general duties which belong to
every day and all parts of it. Whether and in what manner we have renewed our
covenant with God, by renewing of our faith and repentance. How we have sought
the Lord our God, by consecrating our selves wholly both in our souls and
bodies unto his worship and service; and have labored to make him our own in
and through Christ, and to recover our right in him, which we had lost in Adam.
How we have profited in the saving knowledge of him, and in our adhering unto
him with our hearts and affections, how our sweet communion with him has bin
increased, and the comfortable fellowship of his holy Spirit dwelling in our
hearts sealed and assured in us; and how we have endeavored to have and hold
his face and favor in Jesus Christ. Whether we have kept the whole Armor of
God fast buckled unto us; and if we have failed herein, then in what graces
we have found greatest defect. How we have endeavored to arm our selves
against all sin, and what new strength we have gathered to withstand and
mortify our corruptions, especially those unto which we are naturally most
inclined; and with what desire and resolution we have embraced all virtue, and
labored to perform all Christian duties unto God, our neighbors and our
selves. Whether we have rightly disposed our hearts, tongues and actions, so
as they might in all things be conformable to the Law of God. How we have
submitted our selves in all things to Gods will and pleasure, and resigned our
souls, bodies, and states to be governed and guided by his wise providence,
without murmuring and repining. Finally, whether we have been frequent and
fervent in pouring forth our souls in prayer upon all good occasions, desiring
the things we need, and praising him for those benefits which we have
received.

. Sect. 4 That we must examine our selves, how we have spent the day past.
So likewise we may examine our selves, how we have performed those duties
which belong to the particular parts of the day; As whether we did awake with
God, and offered unto him our morning sacrifice of prayer and meditation; with
what faithfulness we have walked in the duties of our callings, and how
therein we have jointly aimed at Gods glory, and the good of our neighbors,
together with our own profit; whether we have done the duties of them in the
obedience and love of God, and have performed our earthly duties, with heavenly
minds and affections. Whether we have rightly used our recreations, refreshing
our bodies and minds with lawful sports, in a good manner, to right ends,
with observation of the rules and cautions required in them, especially in
respect of their time, that we have not been ouer-lauish to the thrusting out,
but rather fitting our selves for better exercises. How we have carried our
selves in receiving of our food, blessing it by prayer and thanksgiving, and
using it with temperance and sobriety, so as we have thereby been better
fitted for Gods service. Whether we have rightly used our solitariness,
spending our time neither idly nor unprofitably: and how we have behaved our
selves in our society, both in our choice of good company, and in performing
with them all Christian duties of piety, Justice, and civil honesty, for the
mutual good of one another. How we have performed duties belonging to the
family, and what care we have had, that not only our selves, but also those
who are under our charge should serve the Lord. How we have carried our selves
in our prosperity, by praising God for it, and by so using it, as that we
might be the better enabled to glorify him, and to perform all good duties to
our neighbors; and how also we have profited by our afflictions and
chastizements, for the drawing of us nearer unto God in all holy and righteous
duties, and the weaning of our hearts and affections from the love of the
world. The which examination we should not think too tedious and laborious,
if at least we be in our health and strength, and not disabled thereunto by
our weakness, infirmities, and unaptness to take our rest, if at the first
it be but a little disturbed; in which case if our employments will afford
unto us any fit leisure and opportunity, it were good to allot some short time
unto this exercise before our going to bed, seeing if we be once accustomed
unto it, we shall perform it, at least in those points which are most
necessary for our own particular, with great facility and in a little time.
Yea in truth if we would but consider how far some of the Heathens
themselves have proceeded in this duty, and what singular fruits and benefits
arise from it, we might well be ashamed who profess Christianity, of our great
neglect, and be moved to spare some little time from our sleep, when as we
may improve it to so much spiritual profit and advantage. I use (says Seneca)
this authority, Vtor hac potestate, and quotidie apud me causam dico, etc.
Senec* de ira, lib* 3. cap. 36
and daily plead my cause with my self. When the light is taken away, and my
wife being acquainted with my custom, holds her peace, I examine with my
self the whole day past, and reuievv all that I have said or done. I hide
nothing from mine own scrutiny, I pass by nothing; for why should I fear
any thing, by reason of my errors, when as I can say; See that thou do it
no more, and for this time I vvil pardon thee. And the same counsel he
gives to his friend Lucilius: Convince Quantum potes, teipsum coargue, etc.
thy self (says he) as much as thou can, search into thy self. First,
execute the office of an accuser, then, of a Judge, and lastly, of a mediator
to crave pardon; and sometime find out thy self. For he willingly erreth, who
knows not his error, and too much loves himself, who will have others
err, that his error may lie hid. By which exercise we should receive
singular profit: For hereby we should preserve our souls and hearts in a
thriuing estate, when we do like wise Merchants and shopkeepers, examine them
and search over our consciences (as it were) our books of accounts, to see
whether we have gained or lost in our spiritual trading, by examining what
we have received, and what we have laid out: which if we would do, we should
not easily be cast behind hand, when as we prevent our errors, and use means
to repair our losses in their first beginnings, nor (as many are) be
bankrupted in our estates at unawares for want of care to examine them. We
should sleep much more sweetly and securely, when as we have so composed and
set straight our reckonings, as that we need not to fear though the great
Judge should before morning call us to an account. In which regard, the same
Author commends this exercize. The mind (says he) is daily to be called to
an account. Sextius used at the end of the day, and when he retired himself to
rest; to examine his mind. What evil of thine have thou cured? What vice have
thou withstood? in what art thou better, that anger will cease or be more
moderate; which knows that it shall not escape the censure of an impartial
Judge? What therefore is more excellent Quid pulchrius hac consuc^udine
excutiendi totam diem, etc? S^ne^. de ira. lib. 3. cap. 36.
then this custom of examining every day? How sweet is that sleep which
follows the reuiew of our selves? How quiet, sound and free; when the mind
is commended or admonished, and as a watchman and secret censurer of it self,
does judge of it own manners? We should also preserve our hearts in their
purity and soundness, if not from all infirmities and corruptions, yet at
least from deep putrefaction and the festering sores of sin, when as we cure
the wounds being yet green, and cast out sin by repeetance, as soon as it
is first entered, not suffering it to lodge and sleep with us, no not one night.
We should hereby keep our spiritual state well settled, so as it would not
easily be shaken, or at least overthrown with the assaults of the enemies of
our salvation, when as we constantly look to our Christian Armor, and
watching over our hearts, as our chief forts, repair the breaches as soon as
they are made. Finally, we shall prevent carnal security and hardness of
heart, when we examine our selves daily; and be better fitted and prepared
for the day of death and Judgment, when as we keep our accounts even, and
have our books of reckonings between God and our consciences made up and in
continual readiness. For he may soon clear his accounts with his Master at
the years end, who like a faithful and diligent Factor, does make all
reckonings straight at the end of every day.

. Sect. 5 Meditations at our first lying down.
Besides this examination, there are also other Meditations very profitable; as
to call to our remembrance Gods manifold blessings and benefits bestowed upon
us the day past, respecting our souls, bodies, and states; in that he has
preserved us from innumerable evils, with which many others have been
overtaken; for continuing unto us still the acceptable time and day of
salvation, and suffering us with so much patience to continue in this life,
that we may make our calling and election sure, notwithstanding our manifold
and grievous sins; for giving unto us some poor desires and endeavors to do
him service, and to accept of it in Christ, though in it self full of wants
and imperfections. Especially, if we have in any measure performed the former
duties of the daily exercise, we must not forget to render unto God the praise
and glory due unto him for it, by the gracious assistance of whose holy Spirit,
we, who of our selves, are not able so much as to think a good thought, have
been enabled unto them. So likewise it is requisite, that at our lying down
we call our sins to our remembrance, the duties which we have omitted, or
corruptly performed, and the vices which we have committed, and though through
Gods mercy we have been preserved from grosser sins, yet we must not
think our selves so excused, but call to mind our frailties and infirmities,
for which, God in his righteous judgment might condemn us. Our sloth and
backwardness to good duties, our coldness, weariness, and many distractions
in Gods service, our excess in mirth or sorrow, the neglect of our Christian
watch over our thoughts, senses, words and works; our idleness or
unprofitableness, pride, self-love, unjust anger, sinister conceits, and
unjust censures of our neighbors, and such like. In the sight and sense
whereof, we must truly humble our souls before God by unfeigned repentance,
and earnestly beg in Christ's Name mercy and forgiveness. Finally, it is
profitable then to remember our mortality and mutability, death and Judgment;
that we who now go well to bed, may shortly be cast upon the bed of
sickness, and we that now live, may within a while be imprisoned under the
arrest of death; yea, let us not look upon it as a thing far off, but
approaching at the threshold, and ready to knock at Luke 12. 19, 20.
the door, and think that this very night, as well as another, may be the
time when God by sickness and death will summon us to appear before his
Tribunal. And if in respect of thy health and strength this seems unlikely,
Cuiuis potest accidere quod cuiquam potest. Sen.
consider that it has been the case of many before thee; and that which
befalls any, may happen to all. In which regard, let us not dare to sleep,
till through Christ we are at peace with God, have made our accounts even by
pleading Christ's satisfaction and full payment, and have our pardon in our
hands to show, sealed to all the faithful with his blood, and to us in
particular, by his holy Spirit and a lively faith, applying the fruit and
benefit of his death unto us. And then resigning our souls and bodies into the
hands of him who is a faithful Savior, and able to keep safe whatsoever is
entrusted unto him, we may with David, lying down in 2. Tim. 1. 12. Psalm. 4. 8.
peace, take our rest; because it is he only that makes us dwell in safety.

. Sect. 6 Duties to be done in the night. And first, Prayer and Thanksgiving.
In the night also there are other duties to be performed; for even then we
must seek the Lord, according to the example of the Church, which Esa. 26. 9.
Cant. 3. 1. Psalm. 119. 55.
professes, that with her soul she desired the Lord in the night, and that
with her Spirit within her she would seek him early. So the Spouse in the
Canticles; By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves. And the
Prophet David was careful even in the night to approve himself unto God, by
performing these religious exercises; I have (says he) remembered thy Name, O
Lord, in the night, and have kept thy Law. And this the Lord requires of us,
as being Lord both of night and day, according to that of the Psalmist; The day
is thine, and the night also is thine. And will be served as Psalm. 74. 16.
Infoelix tota quicunque quiescere nocte sustinet: and somnos praemia magna
vocat. Ovid. Amor. El. 9.
with our whole hearts, so with our whole time, seeing he is the God of our
salvation, who day and night preserves us, and multiplyeth his blessings upon
us, whereby he incourageth us to do him service. Yea, even in the night the
Lord goes in his visitation to see how we carry our selves, and will call us
to account, either to reward us if we do well, or to punish us if we neglect
our duty; as David shows by his own experience; Thou have proved my heart
(says he) thou have visited me in the night; thou have Psalm. 17. 3.
tried me, and shall find nothing. And therefore we must in the night
approve our hearts and actions unto him; and not think that the darkness
gives us any privilege to do the works of darkness; seeing, as the
Psalmist speaks; The darkness hides not from him, but the night shines as
the day, the darkness and the light are both alike to him. Now the Psalm. 139.
12.
duties of the night do consist chiefly in Prayer and Meditation. For when we
awake out of sleep, we must not suffer our minds to roue after worldly
vanities, nor our hearts to be fixed upon them, but as we are to esteem the
Lord, and spiritual and heavenly things our chief treasure, so our hearts and
minds at our first awaking must be exercised about them, as their chief joy
and comfort. And first, we must lift them up unto God in prayer, according to
the example of holy David, who professes, that in the night his song should be
with him, and his prayer unto the God of his life. Psalm. 42. 8.
And again; O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
Psalm. 88. 1.
thee. The which is chiefly to be done, when the hand of God is heavy upon us
by some grievous affliction, because then being freed from all worldly
distractions, we may with greatest zeal and feruency of Spirit, power forth
our souls before God for help and deliverance. And thus David in his great
extremity calls upon God day and night; O my God (says he) I cry in the day
time, but thou hear not, and in the night season I am not silent. Psalm. 22.
2.
So the afflicted Church and people of God, in their heart cried unto the Lord;
O wall of the daughter of Sion, let tears run down like a river day Lam. 2.
18, 19.
and night; give thy self no rest, let not the apple of thine eyes cease.
Arise, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watches, power out thine
heart like water before the face of the Lord; lift up thine hands toward him,
for the life of the young children that faint for hunger in the top of every
street. And our Savior Christ himself in his bitter agony, made choice of
the night, as Luke 22. 44.
the fittest time for those powerful and effectual prayers which he made for
himself and his Church unto God his Father. Whereby we learn, that when we
have suits of great importance, which we would solicit with all earnestness
and importunity, the night is a fit time to commend them unto God in our
fervent prayers. Yea even at ordinary times, if there be any special suite
which we would make unto God, either for the assistance of his holy Spirit, for
the mortifying of some strong corruption which cleaves unto us, or the pardon
of any sin, which has lately wounded our consciences, or for the obtaining
of some special grace, wherein we find our selves most defective, or for
deliverance from some imminent danger; it is most profitable that at our first
waking we presently pitch upon them, and in some short Prayer and earnest
desire of the heart, offer up our suites unto God in the mediation of Jesus
Christ. And as we are thus in the night to pray for the things we want, so also
ought we to praise and give thanks unto God for his gifts and blessings
already received; according to the example of David, who did not content
himself to show forth Gods loving kindness in the morning, but also his
faithfulness Psalm. 92. 2.
in the night. The which duty, upon extraordinary occasions, must be
extraordinarily performed, and in some set and solemn manner; as when our
hearts are ravished with the apprehension of Gods mercy and bounty, after the
receiving of some special and singular benefit; as we see also in David's
practice, who at midnight did rise to give thanks unto the Lord, as Psalm. 119.
62.
he professes. The which his night-songs as they were his solace in the time
of his flourishing prosperity, so the remembrance of them were his chief
comfort in his deepest distress, as being infallible signs of Gods love, and
his own integrity. For when his afflictions both of body and mind were so
great, that he had no manner of consolation in his present sense and feeling,
he calls to remembrance his songs in the night, and the sweet visitations of
Gods holy Spirit in these spiritual exercises. Psalm. 77. 6.
Which example let us learn to imitate; and if no other occasion come
presently to our minds, yet at least let us when we awake, lift up our souls
unto God, praising him for his gracious preservation hitherto, and our quiet
rest, and commending our souls and bodies into his gracious protection for the
rest of the night, desiring the continuance of his favor for our preservation,
and of our quiet sleep, for the refreshing and strengthening of our frail and
weak bodies.

. Sect. 7 Meditations fit for the night.
The other duty is meditation, in which we are to exercise our minds after an
holy and religious manner, when we cannot, or list not to sleep, and not
suffer them to range and roue after idle or hurtful vanities, which will not
bring unto us any profit. The subject matter of which our meditation may be
diverse, according to our several occasions and estates. As first and
principally we must call God to our remembrance, and meditate on his saving
attributes, his infinite love, mercy, goodness and bounty toward us, wherein
holy David took singular comfort and delight: My soul (says he) shall be
satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my Psalm. 63. 6.
mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: when I remember thee upon my bed,
and meditate on thee in the night-watches. Secondly, we may make some part of
the Word of God, the subject of our meditation, as David also did, whose Psalm.
119. 148.
eyes prevented the night-watches, that he might meditate in Gods Word. The
which he makes a special note of a blessed man, that he takes such delight
in the Law of God, that he meditateth therein day and night. And thus Psalm. 1.
2.
we may take occasion to think of the purity and perfection of the Law, what
exact righteousness it requires, and how far we come short of this
perfection, that so we may be humbled in the sight of our own corruptions and
imperfections; or of the excellency of the Gospel, and of the gracious
promises therein contained, applying them by a lively faith unto our selves,
that our hearts thereby may be replenished, and even ravished with the sweet
comforts of Gods holy Spirit, or of Gods manifold blessings bestowed upon us,
especially the day past, and the singular privileges which we have through
Jesus Christ; of which we shall have occasion to speak more hereafter. Or
finally, we may think of some texts of Scripture, which have some similitude
with our present estate. As that Romans 13. 11, 12, 13.
it is now high time to awake out of sleep, for now is our salvation nearer
then when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us
therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of
light: let us walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness,
not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, etc. And again,
Awake thou that sleep, and Ephesians. 5. 14.
stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. But ye brethren are
not 1. These. 5. 4, 5.
in darkness, that the day of the Lord should overtake you as a thief. Ye
are all children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the
night, nor of darkness; therefore let us not sleep as do others, but let us
watch and be sober, etc. Finally, we may from present occasions have good
matter ministered unto us for our meditations; as from the terror of darkness,
we may think how much more fearful is the spiritual darkness of sin,
from which the Lord has graciously delivered us, leaving innumerable others to
live and dye in it; and that horrible estate of the wicked, who are cast into
utter darkness, unto whom the light shall never appear, nor the Sun of
righteousness ever shine, to bring unto them any joy and comfort; and so take
occasion of praising the Lord for freeing us from these fears; and
notwithstanding our unworthiness, for causing the light of truth and salvation
to shine unto us rather then to them. So from our awaking out of sleep, we may
take occasion to think of our awaking out of the sleep of death at the day of
Judgment; and from the crowing of the Cock, of the loud and shrill sound of
the last Trumpet, whereby being raised from the dead, we shall be summoned to
appear before Gods Tribunal, to give an account of all that we have done in
the flesh, either good or evil; that so night and day we may prepare our
selves for Christ's coming, and be still in readiness to give up our
reckonings. Finally, as we are not much to regard our dreams, in respect of
any guess to be made thereby of any future things; so are we not utterly to
neglect them in regard of other uses. For we may not only by them guess at
the temperature of our bodies, and our natural disposition in respect thereof,
and unto what sins we are most inclined; but also we may take occasion from
them of good meditations; as to think of our own frailty and corruption, when
we find and feel that carnal concupiscence, even in our sleep, has
wrought in us, and caused either such dreams as are wanton and lascivious, or
choleric, provoking us to revenge: and on the other side, to meditate on Gods
mercy and goodness, if we have had any dreams that savor of virtue and
Religion, who by his Spirit has sanctified our minds and hearts, which of
themselves are not able naturally to think a good thought, or to conceive a
good desire.

. Sect. 8 That the profit of these duties will far exceed the pains.
Now if any object, that though these duties are good and commendable, yet they
are hard and difficult, and that it brings great weariness Mal. 1. 13.
thus to serve God both day and night in these spiritual and religious
exercises: unto such I dare promise, that their profit will far exceed their
pains; and their spiritual joy and comfort, will abundantly recompense that
carnal distaste which our corrupt flesh causes in them. For if our minds and
hearts be thus continually night and day taken up for Gods use in these
religious exercises, it will be a notable means to keep out Satan and his
suggestions from entering and taking possession; as they easily will, if they be
swept clean and empty of good meditations and desires. For they who are idle
and do nothing, are at the next step to doing ill; and if we be not employed
in the service of God, the devil will take us up like masterlesse men, and
hire us with the wages of sinful pleasures, to spend our time and strength in
the works of darkness. Secondly, if they be thus replenished with good
meditations at our lying down, it will be a notable means to preserve us
from vain, idle and sinful dreams, and contrariwise dispose us even in our
sleep to good thoughts and cogitations. Thirdly, if we thus keep them
well-ordered at our going to bed, and throughout the whole night, we shall
with much more ease and pleasure keep them in this state the day following,
and have them apt and ready unto the well-performance of all good duties. For
as those Ouens are easily heat in the morning, in which we baked in the night;
and the fire soon kindled when we rise, which we well raked up and covered
when we went to bed; so if we be thus exercised over night, we shall find
the spiritual warmth thereof, making us able and active for all good duties in
the morning, and by adding some new fuel unto this holy fire, we shall with
much facility and comfort cause it to burn and blaze out in all Christian and
religious duties. Finally, if with the five wise virgins we thus keep our
lamps trimmed night and day, being always in readiness, we shall not need to
fear the sudden approaching of the Bridegroom; but at the least noise of his
coming we shall rise to meet him, and so entering with him into the marriage
Chamber of heavenly happiness, we shall there eternally solace our selves in
the fruition of his love, and those rauishing joys which he has prepared for
us.

CAP. XXXVII.
That we must moderate our sleep, and not spend too much time in sloth and
sluggishnesse.

. Sect. 1 That this moderation is commanded in the Scriptures, and the contrary
sloth condemned.
ANd these are the duties of the night, which are to be performed whilst we
are waking. In respect of sleep, our duty is that we use it with moderation,
not satisfying thereby our carnal and sluggish concupiscence, but taking only
so much as is fit and necessary to satisfy nature, that we may be more strong
and vigorous, active and able to perform all Christian and civil duties. Of
which there can be given no certain rule, on more then of the measure of
meats and drinks; for as one man's stomach requires more, and another less:
so one man's body, for the preserving of health and strength, needs sleep in
a greater, and another in a lesser and shorter proportion; as youth more then
age, those of a melancholic complexion Inprimis autem cubilis mollitiem
commoderate et conucnienter virilem esse oportet and masculam, etc. Clem.
paedag. lib. 2. cap. 9. Dormiens aute^ homo nullus vllius est pretij, non magis
quam qui non viuit. Ibidem.
less then those of a sanguine or flegmatike, and the weak and sickly more
then the strong and healthy. Yet generally we may say thus much, that as in
other things, so in this, nature is content with a little, in comparison of
that which satisfies the carnal appetite. That our sleep ought to be
moderate and convenient, and (as Clemens speaks) masculine and manly, and not
effeminate and luxurious, not a solution and weakening, but only a remission of
the body, and therefore not to be taken for sloth and idleness, but for the
better inabling us for action and employment. For as the same Author says, A
sleeping man is of no worth, no more then he that lives not. Neither must we
measure our sleep according to our business, taking too much because we have
nothing to do; for a true Christian will never want employment, either for the
good of his neighbor or himself, of his soul or body; and therefore
howsoever upon some weighty occasion a man may abridge himself of his ordinary
measure, yet ought he not to exceed and spend his time, which is so precious,
in sloth and laziness, upon pretense that he wants employment; nor sleep
any longer then is sufficient for the refreshing of his body, that it may serve
his soul as a fit instrument for virtuous and civil actions. For sleep was
ordained not to serve our lust, but for the repairing and chearing of the
spirits, and refreshing of the body: and therefore we must not out of a
slothful humor, take so much as may dull the spirits, and make the body more
lumpish and heavy. For as there is a sinful excess in eating and drinking,
so also in sleeping, when as we exceed that which nature requires; and
therefore as it were an ill excuse for gluttony and drunkenness, to say that
we sit eating and drinking more then enough, because we have no other
business; so is it alike absurd, to spend our precious time in slothful and
excessive sleeping, because we want other imploiment; seeing as one says,
There is no part of our lives Nihil temporis tam perit de vita nostra, quam
quod somno deputatur. Bern. ad fratres, de monte.
more desperately perishes, then that which is deputed to excessive sleep.
Which that we may avoid, let us consider, how the holy Ghost disgraceth the
sluggard in the Scriptures. For first he makes him more foolish and brutish
then the silly Ant, and therefore (as it were) puts him to school to learn
of her, that he might become wiser; Go to the Ant, thou sluggard, consider her
ways and be wise. Secondly, rowzing him up from his sleep; How long will thou
sleep, O sluggard? when will thou arise out of thy sleep? he Pro. 6. 6.
Verse. 9. 10, 11.
brings him, like one half drunk, answering in imperfect and broken
sentences, and begging for a little more sleep, as the drunkard for more
drink, when as already he has had too much. Yet a little sleep, a little
slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep. Thirdly, he shows that he
is unprofitable and good for nothing, and ready to pretend frivolous and
foolish excuses, when as he is persuaded to any good action, saying, There Pro.
26. 13, 14, 15, 16.
is a Lion in the way, and that which is more ridiculous, a lion in the
streets, as though the City were a Wilderness, and the houses dens for
wild beasts. That like the door upon the hindges, he turns and tumbleth
upon his bed, and cannot be drawn from it by any persuasion, no more then the
door from the hooks by much pulling and tugging; yea that he is so besotted
on his sloth, that he had rather forgo his meat, then take any pains to eat
it: for he hides his hand in his bosom, and it grieueth him to bring it
again to his mouth. The which his folly is so much the more desperate,
because in all this he applaudeth his own wisdom; for the sluggard is wiser
in his own conceit, then seven men that can render a reason. Secondly, let us
consider, that the holy Ghost forbids this sluggish sloth; Therefore let us
not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober; 1. These. 5. 6, 7.
for they that sleep, sleep in the night, etc. Which howsoever it is to be
understood principally of the spiritual sleep of security, that by this
Allegory and similitude the Apostle implies, that Christians ought not now so
much to addict themselves to sloth and sleep, as before their conversion;
because they have far better employments for the spending of their time;
besides that, corporal sluggishnesse is a means, and also an effect of
carnal security, even as the bodily watchfulness and sobriety is a means of
the spiritual. And thus our Savior Christ by like implication Matthew. 25. 1.
2, Matthew. 26. 40.
condemns it in the Parable of the foolish Virgins, who spent that time in
sleeping, which should have bin bestowed in furnishing and preparing themselves
to meet the Bridegroom; and directly reprooueth it in his Apostles, when even
in the night, the ordinary time of rest, they were overtaken of sleep, when as
the weighty occasions which presently pressed them, and the special
commandment of our Savior required, that they should give themselves to
watching and prayer.

. Sect. 2 The manifold evils which excessive sleep brings.
Thirdly, consider the manifold evils which it brings upon us; for first,
like a sly and cunning thief it robs us of our time, which is our most
precious jewel, and when it is lost, cannot be recovered; yea even of that
part of time which is chief and principal, the prime of the morning, which is
fittest for spiritual exercises, as prayer, reading and meditation, and also
for the civil duties of our callings. It makes likewise that which remains,
less serviceable and profitable for any good use; for when our strength is
repaired by moderate rest, excessive sleep weakneth us again, making our
bodies heavy and lumpish, and less able and active for any good employment;
and as we consumed the forepart of the morning in drowzy sleeping, so the
latter part in lazy stretching and slothful yawning, making us sluggish with
too much sleeping, as the drunkard becomes more dry with too much drinking.
And when the spirits are refreshed and quickened with moderate sleep, by that
which is excessive they become dull again, and being drowned and stupefied
with slothful vapors, they are made unfit instruments to the soul for any
good actions and employments. Whereby we are notably hindered both in the duties
of Gods service, and in the duties of our callings, not only because it
consumes much of our time, which should be spent in them, but also greatly
disableth us in that which remains, when we set our selves to pray, hear the
Word, read, meditate, or any civil duties which belong unto us. Finally, this
excessive sleeping is exceeding hurtful both for our souls, bodies and
states; for it hurts the brain, dulleth the wit, and much impaireth the
memory, making all these faculties unfit for their functions and operations. It
breeds obstructions and superfluous humors, and so fills the body with
innumerable diseases. It impouerisheth the estate, and brings them who
immoderately use it (if they be of mean condition) to beggerie and penury;
and much disableth those who are wealthy, to the works of mercy and Christian
charity. And on this mischief accompanying sloth and sluggishnesse, the Wise
Solomon much insisteth: For he tells the sluggard, that by his sleeping, and
slumbering, and his folding of his hands together, poverty should come upon him
as one that trauaileth, who still approaches though he comes but slowly, and
his want like Pro. 6. 11.
an armed man, which cannot possibly be resisted by one that lies naked in his
bed. So elsewhere he says; that the soul of the sluggard desires, Pro. 13.
4.
and has nothing, but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat; that
because he will not plow by reason of the cold, therefore he shall beg in
harvest, Pro. 20. 4.
and have nothing, and so in the chief time of others plenty, he through his
sloth shall pine in penury. Finally, that as he shall have an empty famished
belly, so also a cold and tottred back, for drowzinesse shall cloth a man
with rags, whereas they which have a vigilant eye and Pro. 23. 21.
diligent hand, cloth both themselves and those that belong unto them Pro. 31.
15, 21.
with purple and scarlet, as he shows in the example of the virtuous
huswife. Neither is this sluggish sleepiness less pernicious to our
spiritual estate, seeing it brings the soul also to beggary and to
penurious want of all saving graces, by taking up the time wherein we should
trade and traffike for them in spiritual exercises, of which it causes an
utter neglect, or a short and slubbering performance, because it scarce leaves
sufficient time for the necessary dispatch of such important business as does
belong to our place and calling. For no sooner is the sluggard out of his bed,
but even half unready he choppeth upon his worldly employments, and utterly
neglecting prayer, meditation and all spiritual exercises, he thinks
himself sufficiently excused, because he is scanted of time, and called away
by some that attend his rising, or by the importunity of his own affairs;
though he have voluntarily by his sloth brought himself into these straights,
and might easily have escaped them, and had time enough both for religious
exercises and his worldly business, yea even for the benefiting of his
neighbors that need his help, if he would not have consumed so much in
superfluous sleep.

. Sect. 3 That the expense of our time in sloth, is displeasing unto God; and
how this is to be avoided.
But let us know that this wastfull expense of our precious time in sloth and
sluggishnesse, is very displeasing to God, who has lent it unto us that we
should spend it in his service; and that this account will not well pass at
the day of Judgment, when God shall find it written in the book of our
consciences, so much time consumed in superfluous sleep, and so little
employed in the necessary duties of Gods service, prayer, reading, hearing,
meditation; in the religious duties which we owe to our charge and family, or
in the works of charity and mercy, help and comfort which we are bound to
perform unto one another, as being children of the same Father, and fellow
members of the same body. At which day fearful will the estate be of those
nice wantons and idle sluggards, who divide the morning between sloth and
pride, having scarce time, after they are risen out of their beds, to paint and
dress themselves before they come to dinner, utterly neglecting all duties of
Gods service, and the honest labors of a lawful calling. But it was not my
purpose to have touched their abuses, who have learned to outface all that
admonish them, and to put off all that can be said, with some merry jest or
scornful smile, like the fool, laughing with great iollitie when they are
going to the stocks, and are ready to be called to the bar, and carried out
to execution; but only to admonish those who desire to lead a Christian life,
that they avoid such wastfull expenses of precious time, consuming those good
hours in superfluous sleep, which being well employed, would make them rich
in grace, and thrice happy in this life and the World to come. Which whosoever
would do, they must carefully observe these two rules; first, they must be
temperate in their meats and drinks, as being a notable means to preserve us
from excessive sleep and sloth, and to make us watchful unto all Christian
duties, which is the reason why in the Scriptures they are conjoined; Be sober
and watch, 1. Pet. 5. 8.
because as sobriety is a cause of vigilancie, so excess in meats and drinks
is the common cause of excess in sleep. And this help Clemens propounds:
Let not (says he) our meats oppress, but rather lighten Ne ergo cibi nos
grauent, sed al^euent, etc. Clem. paed. l. 1. c. 9.
us, that as much as may be, our sleep may not hurt us, as those that swim are
oppressed, when heavy burdens are fastened upon them. The second rule is, that
we do not suffer an ill custom of lying long in bed, to bring an habit of
sloth upon us, which is almost as hard to break, as to alter nature. Or if we
have already yielded unto it, our best course is, to dis-vse our selves from it
by little and little, and so attain by degrees to a contrary habit. For as the
stomach which is inured to hot waters, is still craving them, and becomes
such a slugge, that it will digest nothing without these helps, whereas those
that use them not, never need them; so if we accustom our selves to
immoderate sleep, we shall turn superfluity into a kind of necessity, and
with Salomons Pro. 6. 9, 10.
sluggard, be still craving for more, when as already we have taken too much;
whereas if as soon as we feel our spirits refreshed, and our strength
repaired with moderate rest, we would shake off sloth, and rising betimes, set
our selves about some good employment, nature would be easily satisfied, and
would never pull us back when we are willing to rise.

CAP. XXXVIII.
Of those Christian and religious duties which we ought to perform on the
Lords Day, for the sanctifying of it.

. Sect. 1 That if we would sanctify the Lords Day, we must prepare for it
before it comes.
BEsides the duties of a godly life which are every day to be performed, of
which we have already spoken, there are others which more specially belong to
the Lords Day, of which we are now to entreat. For howsoever we ought to
deuote our selves in the whole course of our lives to Gods service, yet this
Day is to be set apart, and consecrated wholly after a peculiar manner to Gods
immediate worship, so as we may not in any part thereof do the duties of our
callings, or any of our own works, which tend to the advancing of our worldly
ends. Whereof I will speak the more briefly, because I have in part touched
already the main points and sum of the fourth Commandment, and because also
diverse of my learned and godly Brethren have excellently labored in this
Argument; leaving nothing for me after their plentiful harvest, but some few
gleanings, unless I would pick out of their sheaues, and say the same things
again which they have better said already. And yet because my desire is, that
this Treatise should be perfect in all its parts, I will briefly speak of
these duties, and give some directions for the spending of this Day in such a
manner, as may be acceptable unto God, and profitable for the enriching of our
souls with all spiritual graces, and the assuring and furthering of our
salvation. And first, if we would rightly sanctify the Lords Day when it
comes, there is required beforehand a due preparation; neither can any
action of weight and worth be well performed, which is suddenly and rashly
undertaken; and scarce ever thought on before it be attempted, especially if
there be much and mighty opposition, which will be never wanting in these
religious duties, that so nearly concern our salvation, till we come to keep
a perpetual Sabbath in Gods Kingdom, seeing our spiritual and malicious
enemies, the devil, world, and our own flesh, leave no means unassayed,
which may make all Gods holy ordinances unprofitable unto us.

. Sect. 2 Of our general preparation in the whole week.
Now this preparation is either general or more special. The general, is in
the whole week before, by performing those Christian and religious duties, of
which I have formerly entreated. For if the heart be kept continually in good
plight and order, seasoned with the love of piety, and settled in a good
course, then the duties of the Lords day will be easy and familiar, sweet and
delightful. And as he that keeps himself in breath by running every day,
holds out well when he is put to his best speed, and runs that race for
the getting of the Garland; whereas he who takes his ease, is pursie and
shortwinded, and running with much pain and difficulty, tyreth before he come
to the goal; so if we would every day inure our selves to run our spiritual
race, in the performance of all holy duties, we should find our selves
long-winded, active, and able to hold out, when as on the Lords Day we are put
(as it were) to our best speed, for the obtaining of the Garland of grace, and
Crown of glory: whereas if we spend the week in slothful ease, and pamper
our selves to the full with sensual delights; If we give our hearts liberty to
range after worldly vanities, and fix them wholly upon earthly pleasures and
profits; if we let our tongues loose to discourse only of sensual and terrene
affairs, and never acquaint them with the language of Canaan; and if all our
actions being suitable to them both, are wholly employed about temporary
objects; then shall we find it impossible on the Lords day to withdraw them
from their common haunt; seeing for want of use, religious exercises will be
tedious and unpleasant unto us, and though we with some force bring them to
holy duties, yet finding no taste nor delight in them, they will ever and anon
steal away, or violently break from us, and roue and range after worldly
vanities.

. Sect. 3 Of special preparation to be used in the Evening before the Lords
Day.
The more special preparation is to be used on the evening before the Lords
day, wherein two things are to be performed. First, we must remove all
impediments which might hinder us in our rest and the sanctifying of it: and
secondly, we must use the helps which may further us in these holy duties. The
maine hindrances which must be removed, are two, worldliness, and wickedness.
By the former I understand our earthly and ordinary business, worldly cares
and cogitations, which if they keep possession in our hearts, they will choke
the seed of Gods Word, distract us in our prayers and meditations, and make all
holy exercises cold, formal, and unprofitable unto us. For the preventing
whereof it is much to be desired, that we would (as much as in us lies, and so
far forth as will stand with the necessary duties of our callings) so order
and dispose of all our worldly businesses, as that they might be wholly
dispatched and settled betimes on the Saturday, whereby we should not only be
preserved from incroching upon the Lords Day (as it is the practice of many)
for the effecting of our worldly affairs, which through our negligence and
forgetfulness being left undone, do then press upon us as works of
necessity, but also we should have hereby convenient leisure, and fit time for
our better preparation unto all those holy and religious duties, which the next
day are to be performed. And this is to keep our foot from the Sabbath, Esa.
58. 13. Eccl. 5. 1. Exodus 3. 5.
namely, from treading upon Gods holy ground, and entering rashly upon his
right, when as we appoint and set apart an interim of time between our
worldly affairs, and those holy duties of the Lords Day, as it were certain
bounds between us and the Mount, to keep us from violating Gods Commandment,
wherein we are to weane and sequester our hearts from all worldly things, that
they may be wholly intent unto holy exercises. In which regard the ancient
practice of the Church was very commendable, (and consequently the neglect
thereof to be lamented) which ordained that all laboring men, both in
husbandry and trades, should give over their work betimes upon Saturday in the
afternoon, and resort to the Church, that their bodies being refreshed by
rest, and their minds prepared by prayer and meditation, they might be the
better enabled to perform the public and solemn duties of Gods service the
Day following. The which being now neglected, and both Masters and servants
taken up with their laborious business, later for the most part, that night
then any other in the week, with watching and weariness they are made
altogether unfit to perform Gods worship, their hearts being full fraught with
their worldly affairs, not having had so much leisure as to take a farewell of
them; and their heads so drowzy and heavy, that they cannot hold them up from
nodding and sleeping, even in that time which is allotted to divine exercises.

. Sect. 4 That in our preparation we must purge our selves from all sinful
corruption.
And as we must thus in our preparation purge our hearts from worldliness, so
must we with no less care cleanse them from all sinful wickedness. 1. Pet.
2. 1, 2.
To which purpose we must search and examine them, if no sins lie lurking in
them unrepented of, especially such as most hinder our profiting by the public
Ministry, as wrath and maliciousness, (and chiefly against our teachers)
filthiness, dissimulation, hypocrisy, prejudice and forestalled opinions,
voluptuousness, covetousness, worldliness, and such like. And yet more
particularly we must call to our remembrance what sins we have committed
the week past, and seriously repent of them; lest continuing in our wicked
courses, and cherishing our sins, (as it were) in our bosoms, when we
present our selves before God, they move him to abhor us, and our sacrifices
of prayer and thanksgiving, Esa. 6. 9.
and to give us over to be further hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:
whereof it will follow, that our hearts becoming fat, our ears heavy, and
our eyes shut, we shall hear, and not understand, and see, but not perceive,
that we might be healed and converted. And this the Lord required of the
Israelites, that they should first wash them, and make them clean, Esa. 1. 16.
(namely, in turning from their sins by unfeigned repentance) and then approach
and come unto him. The which was typically signified by that commandment of
washing their clothes, before the giving of the Law; Exodus 19. 10.
answerable unto which, is the sanctifying and purging of our hearts by faith
and repentance from all pollution of sin, before we approach into Gods
presence to receive his Word. For he will not turn unto us, nor by his
gracious promises assure us of his favor, till we turn from our sins; nor
suffer the precious liquor of his Word to be corrupted and spoiled, by pouring
it into our hearts, whilst they continue in their pollution and uncleanness.
Neither are we fit to receive the embassage of our reconciliation, till we have
made our peace with him. For if having offended Math. 5. 23, 24.
our brother, we may not approach unto the Altar to offer our gift, till we
have first sought to be reconciled unto him; then much less may we presume to
offer unto God any religious service, until first by our unfeigned repentance,
we have made our peace with him. And if our fallow grounds must be prepared and
plowed up before they be sowed, then must we in like manner plow up the fallow
grounds of our hearts* as the Prophet exhorts, Jer. 4. 4.
before they can be fit to receive the seed of Gods Word.

. Sect. 5 That in our preparation we must use al helps which may further us in
the sanctifying of the Lords Day.
Secondly, we must in this preparation use all helps, which may further us in
the sanctification of the Lords Day; as namely, those common Psalm. 119. 20.
Psalm. 42. 1, 2.
means of prayer, reading the Word, and other holy writings, meditation, etc:
and more especially we must work as much as may be, longing desires in our
hearts after the Lords Day, that therein we may come into Gods holy
assemblies, and be made partakers of his holy ordinances; and that we may truly
say with David; My soul breaks for the longing that it has unto thy
judgments at all times. And again, As the Heart pants after the
water-brookes, so pants my soul after thee, O God: my soul thirsts for
God, for the living God. O when shall I come and appear before God? For if we
expect it not with desire, we shall not greatly rejoice in the fruition; if it
be not our longing before it approach, it will not when we enjoy it, be our
delight. Now to stir up these longing desires after it, we must meditate on
the excellency of this Day above all others, seeing God has consecrated it
unto his worship and service as his own peculiar, drawing nearer unto us in
all visible signs of his presence, and admitting us to come nearer unto him
then at other times. Let us think on the spiritual beauty and bravery of Gods
House, and of his holy Assemblies graced and adorned with his special favors,
and with the light of his countenance, which infinitely excels the Sun in
brightness and comfort, whereby the Church becomes fair as the Moon,
clear as the Cant. 6. 10.
Sun, and terrible as an army with banners: with which spiritual beauty
being rapt up and ravished, let us cry out with David; O how amiable are Psalm.
110. 3.
thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts! My soul longs, yea even faints for the
Psalm. 84. 1, 2, 10.
Courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cries out for the living God, etc.
A day in thy Courts is better then a thousand; I had rather be a dore-keeper
in the House of my God, then to dwell in the tents of wickedness. Let us
meditate on the singular privileges which the Lord on this Day imparteth unto
us with a liberal hand, admitting us into his Chamber of presence, and
communicating himself unto us, by giving us free liberty to speak unto him
about all our wants and grieuances, and to offer unto him our suits and
petitions, with a gracious promise that he will hear and grant them; yea into
his Council chamber, where he imparteth unto us all his secrets, and the
chief counsels of his Kingdom; and not only causes the great Charter of our
peace, and manifold privileges, to be read and expounded unto us, but also
seals it by his Sacraments for our own peculiar use. Finally, let us
consider of the manifold benefits which the Lord on that Day communicates unto
us. For it is Gods Festival, wherein he nourishes our souls unto life
eternal, if we bring a good appetite to this spiritual banquet. It is his
great Seal Day, wherein he signeth and seals unto us a general pardon for
all our sins, and all our spiritual evidences of our heavenly inheritance,
both by the privy Signet of his Spirit, and the great Seal of his Sacraments.
It is the Day of Gods largess, wherein he bountifully bestows upon us the
inestimable riches of his spiritual graces; and the day of mustring and
training his soldiers in the spiritual warfare, wherein he armeth them at all
points with the spiritual armor, and infuseth into them such strength and
courage, that they become invincible, and obtain victory over their spiritual
enemies. Finally, it is Gods market Day, wherein he freely offers all such
wares Esa. 55. 1.
as are needful for us, without money; and to store us with all provision
which shall be necessary for the preserving of our spiritual life, the whole
week following. And who would not long after such a market, wherein is assured
gain without loss? Who would not beforehand think of all his wants, which
he may have supplied so easily and good cheap? And rather then by forgetting
them, to live in penury and misery, who would not, before he comes to this
market, seriously consider of his wants? take sure notice of them, and rather
then fail by forgetfulness, put them into his Writing-Tables, for the better
strengthening of his memory, that so when he comes to this spiritual market,
he may make provision of what he chiefly needs, and not be to seek when he
is to make his bargain?

CHAP. XXXIX.
That the whole Lords Day must be consecrated unto him, first, by resting on it
from all labor and from sin.

. Sect. 1 That we must spend the whole Day in religious exercises.
ANd these are the duties which are to be performed in our preparation. In the
Day it self the maine duty is, that we consecrate it as an holy Rest unto
Gods worship and service; and not in a part only, as it is the practice of
many, who think that they have done all required of them, if they have spent
some few hours in the public service of God, consuming all the rest of the
Day about their own affairs which respect their pleasure or profit; but we
must spend the whole Day in holy and religious exercises. For the Lord
requires at our hands, that we remember to keep holy, not some few hours
only, but the whole seventh Day; and as he allows unto us for our own
affairs; not some hours only of every day in the week, but the whole six
days: so he reserueth unto himself for his service such a Day as he grants
unto us. In which regard we shall deal deceitfully and ungratefully with God,
if we use a double measure in sharing out the time, a shorter in allotting a
Day to his service, and a longer for our own worldly employments. But as he
allows unto us six days, consisting of 24. hours, so we are not to curtall
his Day, and to shorten him of his due, but to allow unto his service a Day of
like length and continuance, seeing God has made a plain bargain with us,
that he will have a whole Day for his service, as well as we six for our own
employments. And therefore as we would think that our hired labourer should
deal deceitfully with us, if being hired for a week to do our work, he
should labor in our business some few hours every day, and spend all the
rest of his time in his own affairs: so will God think of us, if we deal
with him after the same manner; neither is it a less odious crime in his eyes
to clip his precious time, when we come to pay unto him his due tribute, which
he has given unto us in full weight and measure; then it is unto our Prince,
if we offer unto him for payment clipped coin, when we have received it good
and current out of his Mint. And if such a subject deserves to be hanged and
quartered though he pays his tribute, because he has paid it in clipped
coin; how shall they escape unpunished, who deal no less deceitfully with
God himself? Besides, as God requires, so we profess, that we sanctify a
day unto him; and therefore if having consecrated the whole, we do with
Ananias Act. 5.
keep back a part for our own use, and justify our action, that we have
done all we promised, we shall both rob God of his right, and by lying unto the
holy Ghost, make our selves liable to the like punishment. Again, such a Day
as God observed for his Rest, we must according to his example keep for ours;
but he rested from all his labors a whole seventh Day, after he had finished
his works, and created nothing anew; and therefore we must rest from our
works a whole day, and not a part only. Moreover, as God rested the seventh
Day, so he is said to have sanctified it, that is, to have dedicated and
consecrated it as holy unto his service. Now as things consecrated to holy uses
may not be recalled and Leuit. 27. 28. Act. 5. 4.
reuersed in whole or in part, without sacrilegious profanation, because they
are no longer in our power, but Gods right; so cannot we without theft and
sacrilege, take from God, voluntarily and wilfully, any part of that time
which is consecrated to his service. Finally, the duties of the Sabbath are so
manifold and important, as the hearing and reading of the Word, prayer both
public and private, meditation on that which we have heard, and upon the
works of creation, holy conference, and such like; that the whole day were too
short, though it were altogether spent in these religious exercises; and if
they be rightly performed as they should be, they will leave us little time
for any other employments. Yea, so far ought we to be from imagining that any
part of the Day may lawfully be spent about our own business, that we must
not think the night it self exempted from divine service and religious
duties; for as the six days which God has allowed us for our own works are
natural, consisting of a night as well as of a day, and contain in them full
24. hours, according to that in Genesis, The evening and the morning were Genesis
1.
the first day; so the Lords Day contains in it the like proportion of time,
and therefore ought to be wholly spent in the duties of Gods service, as farrre
forth as will stand with charity and necessity of nature. As we see in the
example of David, who in the Psalm appointed for the Sabbath, professes, that
it is a good thing to show forth Gods loving kindness Psalm. 92. 1, 2.
in the morning, and his faithfulness in the night; and in Paul, who continued
Act. 20. 7, 12.
the exercises of Religion, as the preaching and hearing of the Word, and
administration of the Sacrament when he was at Troas, even until the break of
day which though it were extraordinary in respect of those times of
persecution, yet it teaches us, that the night following the Lords Day is a
part of it, and as it may in like cases be allotted to the public duties of
Gods service, so ordinarily we should perform in some part of it pious duties
of like nature, and in the rest, compose our selves to sleep in such a
Christian and holy manner by prayer and meditation, that even as much as may
be, our imaginations and dreams may retain some relish and savor of our
former religious exercises. Where, by the way we may note, that as the
Christian Sabbath is to begin at the dawning of the day, because it was
instituted in remembrance of Christ's Resurrection, who was that Sun of
righteousness, who brought light and life unto us, by performing and finishing
that great work of our Redemption, and not ouer-night like the Jews Sabbath,
which was ordained to put them in mind of the work of Creation; and the
rather, because it was fit that there should, upon these diverse reasons, be a
difference between their Sabbath and ours; so also it is to continue to the
dawning of the next day, as we have formerly showed by Paul's example.

. Sect. 2 That we must rest from our own works on the Lords Day.
And thus we see the time of the Lords Day how long it is to continue: now we
are to speak of the duties which ought to be performed in it. And these are
all comprised in these two things; first, in observing a Rest, and secondly, in
keeping it holy, or in sanctifying this Rest unto Gods service. The Rest
consists in the forbearing, or not doing of our own works, but only in
cases of necessity, and when the sanctification of the Lords Day requires
them, as duties tending to the advancing of Gods service, or such works of
mercy and Christian charity, as belong to this Day; as the study and pains of
the Minister, the travel of the people to places of divine worship, visiting
and helping of the sick and distressed, confounding of contentions, and making
peace between neighbors, feeding and tending of cattle, and such like.
Where, by our own works I understand all our thoughts, words and actions,
which simply or chiefly tend to our own profit or pleasure. As first, the
works of our callings, Exodus 31. 15.
of all kinds whatsoever, as all works of husbandry, even in the time of
harvest, buying and selling, carrying of burdens, traveling, and such like.
Secondly, all kinds of recreations which are not necessary for the preserving
of health and life, and tend not to the better fitting and inabling of us for
religious duties, but to sensual and carnal delight. Of which sort are
walking abroad that we may take the air, or that we may confer one with
another, or meditate on the creatures, some bodily exercise in course of
physic to refresh the body, and in some cases music, not only vocal by
singing of Psalms, which is a duty of the Sabbath, but also on instruments,
when as it is used, not for carnal and sensual delight, but to refresh our
spirits, and quicken our dull and drowzie hearts and minds, that they may with
more cheerfulness return unto the performance of religious and holy duties;
in which cases there may at some times be the same use of these recreations,
(so they be in moderation, in an holy manner, and to these ends) which is of
physic, meats and drinks. But from all other recreations which tend only
to carnal and sensual delight, we must wholly abstain; first, because the
Lord expressly forbids us to do our own pleasure on his holy Day, and
contrariwise commands us to call his Sabbath our delight, Esa* 58. 13.
the holy of the Lord, honorable, and that we should honor him, nor doing our
own ways, nor finding our own pleasures, nor speaking our own words.
Secondly, because they are our own works, from all kinds whereof Gods
Commandment restrains us, that we may be wholly devoted to the service of
God, and the means which enable us thereunto: yea, they may in some sort be
called more our own works, then the works of our callings, because these are
more expressly commanded, and are ordinarily more necessary, and more directly
tend to Gods service then the other; for it is possible to live and serve God
without these recreations, but not unless we walk in the duties of our
callings. And therefore if these be forbidden on the Lords Day, then much more
the other which are of less use and necessity. Finally, because these worldly
recreations do more dangerously and cunningly wind into our hearts, steal
them away from holy duties, and distract us in Gods service, then the duties of
our callings, the works and labors whereof we do not love for themselves,
but only as they are means of deriuing pleasure or profit unto us, whereas we
love these sensual pleasures for themselves, and oftentimes so dote upon them,
that we neglect our worldly profit; yea the service of God it self, and the
eternal salvation of our souls, that we may enjoy them.

. Sect. 3 That on the Lords Day we must abstain from carnal recreations.
Now if any object, that to deprive us of these recreations, is to take away
all the joy and comfort of our lives; to this I answer, that it is an
objection which altogether misbeseemeth a Christian. For howsoever Infidels and
carnal worldlings may rejoice chiefly in them, as having no greater cause of
joy and comfort; yet it ought not to be so with the faithful, who should
chiefly rejoice in the Lord, and in the pledges and testimonies of his love and
favor, in their Communion with him, who is their Phil. 4. 4.
summum bonum, and chief happiness, and the visible signs of his gracious
presence; unto which spiritual joy David exhorts; Delight thy Psalm. 37. 4.
self in the Lord, and he shall give the desires of thine heart. Of which, he
in many places propounds himself as an example for our imitation. Secondly,
if we be spiritually, and not carnally and worldly-minded, we may make the
Lords Day it self our delight, as he requires, which if we Esa. 58. 13, 14.
do, then we shall indeed find sweet delight in the Lord. For what greater
delight can there be to a Christian, then to praise God by singing of Psalms,
who has been so good and gracious unto us? then to hear the Word, whereby
God assures us of his favor, and of the pardon of our sins, and receive the
Sacrament, whereby it is sealed and assured unto us? then to feast our souls
at this spiritual banquet, and afterward meditate on, and peruse our
spiritual evidences, whereby the assurance of heavenly happiness is conuayed
unto us? then to be assured that we are redeemed out of the hands of all our
spiritual enemies, and restored to the glorious liberty of the Sons of God?
then to solace our selves in the sweet society of Christ our Bridegroom in
his Banketing-house, and to be stayed and comforted with his flagons of wine,
apples, and kind imbracements? Cant. 2. 4, 5, 6.
which spiritual joys if we relish not, what does it but argue a carnal
taste and appetite, which we ought to bewail and mortify, and not feed and
cherish it with vain sports and worldly recreations, which is to strengthen
the flesh against the Spirit, and to put weapons into it hands, Romans 8. 13. 1.
Pet. 2. 11.
whereby it will mortally stab and wound us? But what then, shall our servants
have no time of recreation, who have wrought hard all the week? I answer, To
them that are wearied with labor, the rest of the Lords Day is the best and
fittest recreation for the refreshing of their bodies; and if they be
spiritually-minded, the exercises of the Sabbath before spoken of, are the best
recreations for the cheering of the heart and mind. For who can reasonably
think when a man is tired with the weeks labor, that violent exercises which
are required to many recreations, and bodily labor to the most, should
recreate a man more, then an holy and religious rest, hearing the Word, singing
of Psalms, holy conferences, and such like, if carnal love did not take away
all appetite from these, and supply spirits and strength for the atchieuing of
the other? yea, but we must take our servants as they are, and have some
respect to humane frailty and infirmity; and though we may persuade them to
delight in spiritual exercises, yet in the mean time, till they be alike
spiritually-minded with us, we must give them liberty to use those recreations
wherein they take pleasure. Well, let it be so, yet is it necessary that the
Lords Day must be the time allotted to these sports? will we lay sacrilegious
hands upon this Day which he has appropriated unto his service, and convert it
to our own use and pleasure? and whereas being chief Lord of persons and
times, he might have reserved six days for himself, and allowed but one unto
us, now that he has dealt thus graciously and bountifully with us, as to
appropriate but one for his own worship, and leave six for our business,
shall we think that one too much, and ungratefully incroach upon it? and
holding all in Kings service saving a seventh part which is reserved as an
acknowledgement of our Sovereigns bounty, who gave us freely all the rest,
shall we grudge and repine to pay this due tribute, and greedily seize all into
our hands by a false tenure? Finally, shall we think six days too little for
those businesses which tend to the good of our bodies, and our momentany
estates, and shall we think one too much to be employed for the good of our
own, and our servants souls, and for the furthering and assuring of our own
and their everlasting salvation? Rather therefore if recreations be necessary
for our servants, let us allot some of our own time in the six days for this
use, then rob the Lord of any part of his Day, unto which we have no right; and
not conclude with this childish, yet deuilish sophistry, That seeing of
necessity they must have some time for their sports, therefore it must be on
the Lords Day, rather then any of our own. As if we would say, They must needs
have some money to spend on their pleasures, and therefore to get it, they must
rob by the highway, or pick other men's purses, but not have a penny of our
allowance. Now if those recreations, which at other times are lawful, or of
indifferent nature, be on the Lords Day forbidden as unlawful; then what shall
we say of such as are at no time lawful, but simply evil and wicked? In which
notwithstanding many that profess Christianity, spend a great part of the
Lords Day, as if they would consecrate a feast to Bacchus or Venus, yea the
Devil himself, whose works they are, rather then unto God, who being pure
and holy, condemns and abhors these fruits of the flesh, and works of
darkness as odious and abominable.

. Sect. 4 That we must rest from sin of all kinds on the Lords Day.
Thirdly, our care must principally be on the Lords Day to abstain from all
sin, which above all others is to be esteemed the most servile work, seeing
the committing thereof is the base service of the devil, and our own carnal
lusts. In which regard, as we must at all times avoid it, so especially on the
Lords Day, which is an holy rest, consecrated to his worship and service,
seeing we cannot offer unto him a greater indignity, then to serve the devil
in the works of darkness, when we should serve him in the exercises of piety
and Religion. And as we are carefully and conscionably to avoid all kinds of
sin, so those principally wherewith the Lords Day is most ordinarily
profaned, which being the sins of the times and Country, will by the
contagion of evil example, most easily poison and infect us, if we do not
warily avoid them. Among these, we may number proud and laborious curiosity in
decking and adorning of the body, which does so wholly take up the time of
some, especially of the weaker sex, that they have scarce any leisure for any
spiritual exercises, whereby they should privately serve God, and prepare
themselves for his public worship in the Congregation. Secondly, excessive and
unnecessary feasting, especially of our equals, by which, servants ordinarily
are more toyled, then on any other day in the week, and so wholly taken up
with these businesses, that they can seldom come to the House of God to do
him service. So that as David sometime seemed to envy the happiness Psalm. 84.
3.
of the Sparrowes and Swallows, which had that liberty of coming into the
Tabernacle which he wanted: so have these poor Cooks and servants cause, not
only to envy them, but even their Masters Hawks and Dogs, which accompany them
to the House of God, when as they, whose souls are no less precious then
their Governors, and purchased at as high a rate, even the inestimable price
of Christ's Blood, are constrained to stay at home with hungry and starued
souls, for want of spiritual food, that they may provide superfluity and
abundance of corporal meat for the pampring of the flesh. And with this
excessive cheer we may also reckon immoderate eating and drinking of ordinary
meats and drinks; for as surfeiting and drunkenness are never seasonable,
but are always unlawful, and to be shunned as works of the flesh; so above
all other times upon the Lords Day, as being not only in themselves sinful,
and works of darkness, but also notable impediments, which disable us unto
all holy duties, whilst oppressing the heart, surcharging the stomach, and
filling the head with drowzie fumes, they make us more fit to sleep, then
either to pray, or hear, or meditate, or to perform any other duty of Gods
service. And unto these we may add dispatching of slight businesses, which are
thought scarce worth the while upon the week days, as unnecessary iourneys,
and idle visitations, casting up our accounts, and setting our reckonings
straight, carrying home of work done the week before, giving directions and
instructions to our servants for the dispatching of their business the week
following, and such like.

. Sect. 5 That we must not think our own thoughts on the Lords Day.
Fourthly, we must refrain (as much as in us lies) from thinking our own
thoughts on the Lords Day, that is, not only such as are sinful and Pro. 23.
26. Mat. 22. 39.
wicked, vain and good for nothing at any time, but those also which are
worldly and about our earthly affairs, which may be lawful on other days.
For the Lord requires not the outward man, and external actions alone to be
consecrated to his service, but chiefly and principally the mind and the heart,
in which, above all other parts he delights. And he forbids us to walk in
our own ways and pleasures on his Holy Day, Esa. 58. 13.
which is to be referred to our thoughts as well as to our outward actions,
seeing we delight in the one as well as the other. In which regard we must use
our best endeavor, to sequester our minds and hearts from all worldly and
earthly things, that they may be wholly exercised in spiritual and heavenly
Meditations. And as it is unlawful to think and meditate on earthly things on
the Lords Day; so also to spend any part of this time allotted unto holy and
religious duties, in the reading and studying of profane Books, and such
writings as are merely civil and humane, as the Story of the times, and
Histories of the Commonwealth, liberal Arts and Sciences, and such like,
which may make us more wise to the world, but not to God; fit us for earthly
employments, but neither furnish us with spiritual grace, nor yet further our
heavenly happiness. Finally, as we must abstain from thinking our own
thoughts, and doing our own works on the Lords Day, so also from speaking of
our own words, as the Lord requires. Esa. 58. 13.
By which we are to understand all discourses which are merely worldly and
about earthly things, more then charity and necessity requires; all idle Mat.
12. 33.
and frivolous talk, of which, if we must give account, though it have been
uttered at ordinary times, how much more upon the Lords Day, when as our
tongues, (which as David calls them, should be our glory, to glorify God by
uttering his praises) are employed in sounding out our own froth and
fooleries? All speeches about our worldly pleasures and profits, or about
things impertinent, as other men's affairs, news and novelties which do not
concern us, especially in respect of our spiritual estate and condition,
which we ought chiefly and soly to respect on this Day.

. Sect. 6 That we must not do the Lords works after our own manner.
And these are the works which we must leave undone on the Lords Day; from
which as we must abstain, as the matter of our employments, so also from doing
the Lords works after our own manner. Neither is it enough that we refrain
from all sinful and worldly actions, and do the duties which God requires of
us, seeing if we do them not in that sort and manner as he requires; that
is, spiritually, holily, zealously, and religiously, with upright hearts and
good consciences, we make them no better then profane and servile works,
which God will reject as odious and abominable. For if we worship the Lord only
with the outward man, and not with our hearts and souls, with the lips alone,
and not in Spirit and Truth, in show and hypocrisy after a formal, cold, and
careless manner, and not with upright hearts, substantially and zealously, he
will demand of us as of the Jews, Who has required these things at your
hands? He will Esa. 1. 12.
complain of us as of them; This people draw near unto me with their lips,
but their hearts are far from me. He will censure our service, as he did
their sacrifices; Chap. 29. 13.
He that kills an Ox, is as if he slew a man: he that sacrifices a Lamb,
as if he cut off a Dogs neck: he that offers an oblation, as if he offered
Esa. 66. 3.
Swines blood: and he that burns incense, as if he blessed an Idol. And
though we pray, and preach, and hear, yea even work miracles in Christ's Name,
yet if we do them not in a right manner, he will reject us at the day of
Judgment, and exclude us from his heavenly joys, as being no better then
workers of iniquity. Mat. 7. 22, 23.


CAP. XL.
That we must sanctify our rest, by consecrating it to the duties of Gods
service.

. Sect. 1 That we must rise betimes on the Lords Day.
ANd thus much concerning the rest, and things from which we must abstain on
the Lords Day; The second thing to be considered, is the sanctifying of this
rest, by consecrating it unto those duties of Gods service, which upon this day
he requires of us. For it is not sufficient, that we refrain from working,
and do nothing, seeing our beasts do this as well as we, but we must make it
an holy rest, abstaining from our own works, that we may do the works of
God. In which regard it is called, not only a Sabbath, and day of rest, but
Gods Sabbath and Holy Day, wherein he inioyneth us to do him service. And if
he abhors idleness at all times, and condemns the neglect of our own
works in all the rest of the week, then much more if we be idle upon his Day,
and spend that time which he has allotted to his own service, in sloth and
idleness. Neither does the Lord simply require a rest for it own sake (seeing
in it self it is less profitable and acceptable then action and labor) but
as being a sanctified rest, it is a means to fit us for his service, which is
the end of it, unto which if we attain not, it is vain and unprofitable, yea
wicked and sinful. Now the duties of Gods service, whereby this rest is
sanctified, are either private or public; the which, because they are
interchangeably mixed with one another, therefore I will observe a mixed method
in handling of them. The first private duty, is, that we awake and rise as
timely this day to do God service (and if we be Governors of families, that
we cause those who are under our charge to do the like) as we do (or ought
to do) on any of the week days to do our own works. Yea, seeing Gods
works are of much greater weight and worth, then our own, and our spiritual
gain of grace, and means of furthering the salvation of our souls, and our
everlasting happiness in the life to come, are incomparably more excellent
then earthly riches and delights, therefore as we are watchful on the week
days to pursue these, and are willing to abridge our selves of our ordinary
sleep, when we have any good opportunity offered for the compassing of them;
so should we herein exceed on the Lords Day, wherein we have such good means
offered of enriching our souls with the spiritual treasures of Gods saving
graces, and of attaining unto the assurance of our heavenly joys, and those
pleasures which are at Gods right hand for evermore; so far forth as the
frailty and infirmity of nature will suffer, and not disable us through
drowzinesse, caused by want of sufficient sleep, unto the public duties of
Gods service. And therefore far be it from us that profess Christianity, to
imitate the practice of carnal worldlings, who rise betimes upon the week
days to go about their own business; but when the Lords Day comes, lie
long in bed, and (as they say) take up their penny-worths of sleep, in which
they were scanted by their earthly employments, because they think it an idle
time, wherein they have nothing to do, saving to make themselves ready and go
to Church; but rather, according to our profession, let us imitate the example
of our Savior Mar. 1. 35, 38.
Christ, who did awake betimes to do the works of God, rising before day to
pray, and afterward preaching in the Synagogue.

. Sect. 2 Of meditations fit to be used on the Lords Day.
Secondly, being awakened out of sleep, we must in the first place settle our
selves to perform those religious and holy duties belonging to every morning,
of which we have formerly spoken, but with these differences; first, that we
respect in them the Lords Day, and make special application of them unto that
present occasion. And secondly, that we do in an extraordinary manner stir
up our selves to perform them with more ardent zeal, and greater devotion
then at any other time. For example, we must awake with God, and in our first
thoughts set him before us, and our selves in his presence, that we may in a
special manner perform the peculiar duties of his service, which that Day
above others he requires of us. And first, we must devoutly lift up our hearts
and souls to praise his holy Name, for preserving us the whole week and night
past from all perils and dangers, continuing still unto us, life, liberty, and
all good means and opportunities, whereby we are enabled yet once again to
sanctify his Sabbath, by performing unto him the duties of his service;
earnestly desiring the continuance of his favor, and the gracious assistance
of his holy Spirit, to guide and lead us thorowout the day following, that we
may therein carry our selves in such an holy and religious manner, as that all
the service which we perform unto him, may be pleasing and acceptable in his
sight, and may wholly tend to the advancement of his glory, the edification of
our brethren, the enriching of our souls with all spiritual graces, and the
furthering and assuring of our salvation. After which short Prayer, we are to
spend some time in holy meditation, the subject and matter whereof may be the
infinite and inestimable love and mercies of God, innumerable ways showed unto
us, but especially in giving unto us his only begotten and dearly beloved
Son, to dye for our sins, and as this Day to arise again for our
justification. In which, we may enlarge our selves as time and leisure will
serve, by calling to our remembrance the particular parts of Christ's Passion,
as his miseries and afflictions in the whole course of his life, his betraying
and apprehension, his haling to the Judgment seat of mortal men, who was the
Sovereign Judge of heaven and earth, his accusing and condemning, who was
innocent, that he might acquit us who are malefactors. Also how he was railed
and spit upon, scourged and tormented, clothed with purple and crowned with
thorns, scorned and derided, numbered among the wicked, and crucified between
two thieues, died the death, the bitter, ignominious, and cursed death of the
Cross; and in his soul bore and endured for our sakes the anger of God, much
more heavy and intolerable then all his other sufferings, which made him in
that his bitter agony to sweat water and blood, and to cry out upon the
Cross; My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? Unto which, we may add in
our meditations Job. 3. 16.
the manifold and exceeding fruits and benefits of his death and resurrection
redounding unto us, that so we may not only be stirred up to unfeigned
thankfulness unto God the Father, who has of his mere love Romans 5. 8, 10.
Phil. 2. 6.
given his Son, even when we were strangers and enemies, to do all this for
us; and to God the Son, who has, being equal with his Father, thus humbled
himself to work the great work of our Redemption; and to God the holy
Spirit, for applying the fruits and benefits of Christ's passion and
resurrection unto us, making them effectual for our justification and
salvation: but also having our hearts inflamed with the apprehension of this
their love, we may be moved hereby to love them again, and be made zealous
in their service, thinking nothing enough which we can do, to glorify them
who have been so good and gracious unto us. We are to meditate also on our
sins which we have fallen into, especially since the last Lords Day, either in
the omission or imperfect performance of good duties, or in the commission of
evil that we may seriously bewail and repent of them, before we present our
selves in the holy assemblies, to perform the public duties of Gods service.
Seeing he will be Leuit. 10. 2.
honored in all that draw near unto him, either in his mercy, by forgiving
the sins of the repentant, or in his justice, by punishing those that
continue in their impenitency. So also we are to examine and search out those
sins and corruptions, unto which our frail nature is most inclined, and
wherewith we have been most often overtaken, that so going into Gods
spiritual armorie, we may fit our selves with such weapons as may defend and
strengthen us against them; and get such wholesome preservatives, as may keep
us from being tainted and infected, after our recovery, with the like
contagious poison. We are likewise to examine our wants, and in what graces of
Gods holy Spirit we are most defective, and in what holy duties we are most
backward and sluggish, that so we may supply our defects when we come into
this spiritual market, by applying such doctrines and instructions,
admonitions and exhortations, as shall be most fitting for this purpose.

. Sect. 3 Of Prayer, Thanksgiving, and reading the Scriptures privately on the
Lords Day.
After some time spent in these and such like meditations, we are in the next
place to perform the duty of private prayer, which is to be fitted to the
Lords Day. For prostrating our selves before the Throne of grace, in the
mediation of Jesus Christ, we are to confess and acknowledge, as our other
sins, so those especially whereby we have offended God in respect of his
Sabbaths, and the duties of his service; as our original corruption, whereby
we have utterly disabled our selves, in all the powers and parts of our souls
and bodies, to all holy duties and religious worship, and become apt and prone
to the contrary sins; and our actual transgressions, whereby we have broken
all Gods Commandments, especially those which respect his Sabbaths and
service; as the profaning of his holy Day by utter neglect of all holy duties,
or by imperfect performance of them, want of preparation, of reverence and
attention, faith and feruency of spirit in hearing the Word, and calling upon
Gods name, want of care in laying it up in our hearts and memories, and
practicing it in our lives, etc. And thus as in our Complaints we are to
bewail other wants, so those especially which make us unfit to perform any
acceptable service unto God; and in our petitions, as we are to beg other
gifts and graces whereof we stand in need, so those above others, which enable
us to the better sanctification of the Lords Day, in performing unto him his
spiritual worship; as hungring and thirsting after the means of Gods glory,
and our salvation, prepared hearts, and good consciences, faith, and feruency
of spirit, reverence and attention in hearing the Word; and Gods blessing and
assistance of his holy Spirit unto his Minister and Ambassador, that he may
speak the Word powerfully and profitably, as to all the Congregation whereof
we are members, so unto us especially for our edification and building up in
all spiritual grace; the mortification of our special vices and corruptions,
the increasing of our virtues, and confirming of our strength, unto the
performance of all Christian and holy duties, wherein as yet we are most
defective. And finally, in our praises and thanksgiving we are to magnify
Gods holy Name, as for all his blessings and benefits, so for those especially
which respect this Day; As the giving of Jesus Christ to be our Savior and
Redeemer, and causing Luke 1. 78, 79.
this Sun of righteousness to arise and shine unto us; the continuance of
his Sabbaths, and the light of his Gospel, wherein he reuealeth unto us his
holy will concerning our salvation, and the means whereby we may attain unto
it: the peace, liberty and safety which we enjoy, together with his spiritual
favors, for granting unto us his Word and Sacraments, and making them in some
measure effectual by the inward operation of his holy Spirit, for the
begetting and increasing of our faith, and the work of Sanctification in us,
and the like. With prayer we must also, as leisure and opportunity serves,
join the reading of some fit portion of holy Scriptures, for the better
seasoning of our hearts, and settling of our affections upon holy things, for
the inflaming of them with the love of Gods Law, and with longing desires after
the public means of our salvation. With which private exercises when we have
prepared our selves, we must, if we be governors of families, use all good
means for the fitting and preparing of our children and servants for the
public service of God; not thinking it enough for those that have the charge
of others, to perform private duties by themselves, unless they cause their
inferiors also to join with them. But especially, before we go to the
Church, we must call them all together unto prayer, wherein, after the
confession of our sins, and earnest petition for all necessary graces, we
are to desire the assistance of Gods holy Spirit, for the sanctifying and
preparing of the whole family, that they may in some acceptable manner perform
all good duties which belong to the Sanctification of the Lords Day. Neither
must we (as many do) think it sufficient, that we bring our families to Gods
service, nor neglect the duty of private prayer, because it is to be performed
publicly in the Congregation, and so cause one duty to shoulder and thrust out
another, but we must join them together, seeing the private service of God is
not only on his holy Day acceptable in it self, but a notable and necessary
means to fit and prepare us for the right performance of his public worship.
In which respect, as we must be careful that the public service do not
exclude the private, either morning or evening; so much more, that the private
do not hinder the public: but we must so order and dispose of these
family-exercises, as that they may be finished in seasonable time, and not
hinder us from coming to the beginning of public prayer with the residue of
Gods people.

. Sect. 4 Duties to be performed when we are going to the Church.
After all which duties performed in the family, we are, when we are ready to
go unto the Church, or when we are in the way, to spend that time in holy
Meditations, thinking with our selves that we are going, not upon some slight
or ordinary business, but to present our selves in the glorious presence of
the great King of heaven and earth, who being infinite in all holiness and
perfection, and a God of such pure and piercing eyes, that he sees not only
our outward actions, but searches the heart and reins, hates and abhors
all impurity and corruption, dissimulation and hypocrisy, all cold, formal
and negligent service, and will be worshipped of us in spirit and truth. Let
us call to mind that we are going, not to confer with our companions, or
with mortal men, not much superior unto us, but to speak and make our suits
to Gods supreme and most glorious Majesty, and to hear him speaking unto us by
his Ambassadors, in whose presence the heavens are unclean, and the blessed
Angels hide their faces. And that not about ordinary and slight matters, but
such weighty and important business, as no less concerns us, then the
eternal salvation or damnation of our bodies and souls. Finally, that we are
going about such affairs as will (according as we dispatch them) make us much
better or worse. For, the Word shall prosper, to the atchieuing of that Esa.
55. 11.
end, for which God sends it, and shall never return in vain; either it will
soften us like wax, or harden us like clay; either it will be Gods strong power
2. Cor. 2. 15, 16.
to our salvation, and the savor of life unto life, or the savor of death
unto Romans 1. 16. 2. Cor. 2. 15, 16.
death, for our deeper condemnation, and by performing this duty in hearing of
it, we shall be nearer heaven or hell. And having with these and such like
meditations brought our selves to the place of divine worship, let us enter
into it with all fear and reverence, as into Gods own House and place of his
glorious presence; saying with Jacob, Surely the Lord is in Genesis 28. 16, 17.
this place; how dreadful is this place? this is none other but the House of
God, and this is the gate of heaven.

CAP. XLI.
Of the public duties of Gods service on the Lords Day.

. Sect. 1 That we must join with the Congregation in all the duties of Gods
service.
ANd thus having placed our selves in Gods holy Assembly, we are to join with
them in all duties of Gods service, with unanimity of heart, and uniformity in
action and gesture, as becomes those that profess themselves to be of the
same communion of Saints; carefully avoiding the proud, superstitious and
ignorant practice of those, who in Gods public service make a rent in the
Congregation, reading of a book when others are praying, and praying privately
to themselves, when they should join with the rest of the people in the
hearing of Gods Word. First then, when the Minister prays, we are to join
with him as being our spokes-man, who in our name, as well as his own, makes
known our suits unto God, and returns unto him praise and thanksgiving for
all his benefits. In which regard, we are to accompany him in this holy
exercise, with such reverence and attention, zeal and devotion, faith and
feruency of spirit, as if his tongue were the interpreter of our hearts. But of
the duties of prayer I have spoken before, and therefore here pass them over.
Secondly, we must apply our selves to hear the Word diligently and
attentively, when it is read unto us by Gods Minister, not slighting it over as
a duty of small moment, which we may as well perform at home; seeing this
ministerial reading in the Congregation, is more effectual for our spiritual
good, then our private reading; even as a Sermon preached, is more powerful
and effectual then a Sermon read, because these public means are Gods holy
ordinances, the which he accompanies with his grace and holy Spirit, infusing
by them more virtue and vigor into those who rightly use them, then by private
exercises.

. Sect. 2 Of our hearing of the Word, and what is required unto it.
The third duty is, that we carefully and diligently hear the Word of God
preached unto us, with all reverence and attention, alacrity and cheerfulness,
faith, humility, and a good conscience. First, we must hear the Word with all
reverence and fear; and to this purpose we must remember that we are in Gods
sight and presence, who takes notice of all our carriage and behavior.
Secondly, considering that the Minister Act. 10. 33. Esa. 66. 2. 2. Cor. 5. 20.
speaks not in his own name, but as Gods Ambassador, we must hear that
which he speaks, not as the word of a mortal man, but as it is indeed 1.
These. 2. 13. Luke 10. 16.
the Word of the everliving God, whereby one day we shall be justified or
condemned. Moreover, we must hear it with all attention; and not suffer our
eyes to roue, and our minds and hearts to be carried away with Luke 4. 20.
wandering thoughts, but our eyes must be fastened upon the Preacher, as the
eyes of our Savior Christ's hearers were upon him; and like them, Chap. 19. 48.
we must hang upon his lips, as the child upon his mothers breasts, to suck
from them the sincere milk of the Word, that we may grow up thereby. 1. Pet.
2. 1.
Neither must we want only affect the froth of humane wit and eloquence, but
the pure and powerful Word of God which is able to save our souls; not such
flashes and idle conceits as tickle the ear, but never pierce the heart; and
work a present delight, but neither inform the judgment, nor reform the
affections, but sound doctrine, and wholesome nourishment. For no more is the
Minister bound to preach the Word in the demonstration of the Spirit and power,
plainly and profitably, then the people to hunger after the sincere milk of
the Word, and the wholesome food of their souls, which is fit to nourish them
unto everlasting life. Thirdly, we must hear the Word with alacrity and
cheerfulness, seeing Psalm. 110. 3. Esa. 2. 2. Psalm. 122. 1.
as the Lord loves a cheerful giver, so a cheerful receiver and hearer, and
in all duties especially requires the service of the heart. The which we shall
the better do, if we consider that the Word is the spiritual seed whereby we
are regenerate and begotten unto God, the food of our souls which preserves
spiritual strength, and nourishes them to life eternal, the light that
guides us in the way of salvation, the physic that cures us of our
corruptions, the means of working in us all spiritual graces, and of assuring
unto us everlasting happiness. Fourthly, we must bring faith to the hearing
of Gods Word, without which it will profit us nothing, Heb. 4. 2.
as the Apostle speaks. By which faith we do not only steadfastly believe
those things which are soundly delivered out of Gods Word, but also effectually
apply them unto our selves for our own particular use, as if they were spoken
to none but us. And thus we must apply the threatenings of the Law for our
humiliation, that we may escape Gods Judgments, instructions for our
information, admonitions and reprehensions for our repentance and amendment;
counsels for our direction, and consolations for our comfort. By which
application we make the food of our souls our peculiar nourishment, for the
begetting and increasing of all Gods graces in us. Fifthly, we must hear the
Word with humility, submitting our selves unto it as Gods ordinance and Scepter
of his Kingdom, to be ruled and governed, directed and instructed, admonished
and reproved by it, that so it may be mighty in us to cast down the strong
holds of sin, and to make way for Gods graces against all oppositions of
carnal reason, and proud will. Finally, we must hear with a good conscience,
propounding unto our selves in this religious duty, the glory of God as our
maine end, that knowing his will, we may serve him, in yielding unto it entire
and sincere obedience; and next unto it, our own salvation, by being edified
thereby in our most holy faith, and more and more enriched with all sanctifying
and saving graces. And to the end that we may daily profit in attaining unto
these ends, we must labor not only to conceive and understand what we hear,
but also to apply it unto our own use for the sanctifying of our hearts and
affections, and not to hear it as an unprofitable discourse, suffering it to
go out at the one ear, as it comes in at the other, but to lay it up in
faithful memories, that we may bring forth the fruits of it in our lives and
conuersations. To which end we must carefully observe the Preachers method and
order; as the coherence of his Text with that which went before, and follows
after, the maine drift and scope of the holy Ghost in that Scripture, the
explication and meaning of the words; the division of the Text into its
several parts and branches; the maine points of doctrine which are gathered
out of them severally and in order, how they are proved by Scriptures, or
reasons grounded on them, illustrated by similitudes, and enforced by
exhortations. And finally, the uses which are raised out of them, for
confutation of errors, admonition, reprehension or consolation: or if this
method be not observed (which ordinarily is most profitable in a mixed and
vulgar auditory) but the maine point in the Text is handled by way of common
place; then are we to observe his definitions of the virtue, vice, or other
thing handled, the causes, effects and common affections, the subject place,
the time, and other adjuncts, the dissentanies and contraries, the distribution
of the whole into the parts, or of the general into the specials, and how
every branch is followed, proved, illustrated and applied. Or if the Sermon
want method, or we skill to conceive it, or memory to retain it, (for it
sometime happens, that method which is the chief help of memory, through too
much curiosity and multiplicity of divisions is a means to confound it) yet
let us at least observe those things that are delivered, which we knew not
before, for the increasing of our knowledge, and bettering of our judgment,
what vices are reproved, or virtues commended, with the reasons and
illustrations of them both, what has most convinced our consciences, what has
been well pressed and wrought effectually upon our hearts and affections, for
the withdrawing of them from any sin, their inflaming with the love of any
thing that is good, and the stirring of them up to the embracing and practicing
of any Christian and holy duty.

. Sect. 3 That we must stay in the Church from the beginning to the end of the
Sermon.
The last duty in hearing is, that we continue from the beginning of the Sermon
to the end, and as we are to come with the first, so we must not (as the
manner of many is) depart, till all the exercises of Religion being fully
concluded, the whole Assembly be dismissed. For as it is great unmannerliness
at a solemn feast, to rise before the table is taken away, unless it be in
case of sickness, weakness, or some important business; so they which depart
from this spiritual Feast before it be ended, are either very unmannerly and
void of due reverence and respect of Gods presence, and his holy ghests, and if
they be not troubled with bodily infirmities, do show the sickness of their
souls, when their spiritual appetite is so queazie, that they loath their
nourishment, or that they think the employment which they go about, of
greater weight, or at least much more necessary, then the feeding of their
souls with this spiritual Manna, and using the means of their salvation.
Neither must we haste away after the Sermon is ended, as though we would rush
out of prison as soon as the door is opened; but we must stay still, that we
may join with the Minister and the Congregation in prayer and thanksgiving,
if any be (as there ought to be) after the concluding of the Sermon; seeing as
in receiving our corporal food, so also in the spiritual, we have as just
cause and occasion of praising God for benefits received, as of praying for his
blessing upon them before we received them. But if it be omitted, we must
supply this defect in respect of our own particular, by lifting up our hearts
unto God, praising him for causing the light of his Gospel to shine still unto
us, and for all the wholesome instructions, admonitions, reproves, and
consolations which he has graciously at that time imparted unto us. And if
there be a Psalm sung, we must join with the Congregation, praising the Lord
with mind and voice, and making melody unto him with our hearts: which being
ended, we must expect the blessing of God pronounced by the mouth of his
Minister, with all reverence and devotion, esteeming it of great efficacy, as
if God himself did bless us by them. For so we read, that God appoynting
Aaron to pronounce Number. 6. 23, 24, etc.
such a blessing upon the people, says, that he should hereby put his name
upon them, and he himself also would bless them. And therefore being of such
importance, we must not, through overmuch haste, leave it behind us as a
needless complement.

. Sect. 4 Of our duty in receiving the Lords Supper.
And if the Sacrament of the Lords Supper be administered, having duly prepared
our selves, we are to communicate with the rest of the Congregation; Luk 22. 19.
and not unmannerly depart from this holy Feast, being invited, when we see it
set upon the Lords Table. For it is a part of Gods public service, which is
not left as arbitrary at our choice, to do, or leave undone, but expressly
enjoined by our Savior, Do this in remembrance 1. Cor. 11. 24, 25, 26.
of me. It is a notable means of confirming and increasing our faith, being
the Lords Seal, wherewith he has ratified his Covenant of grace and salvation
with us; the which being often shaken with tentations, and wounded and weakened
with our sins, needs often to be strengthened and renewed. It is the badge
and livery whereby we are known to be Gods servants; and therefore coming to
do him service, we ought not to cast it off, when the rest of the family put
it on. It is a testification of our thankfulness to God and his Christ, for
all their benefits, especially that great work of our Redemption; and a
profession of our faith, that we rest upon the mercies of God, and the death
and merits of Christ for our justification and salvation, which we are not to
neglect when others perform it, but to take all good occasions of testifying
our faith, love, and thankfulness unto them. It is a notable means to put us
in mind of Christ's death, and to apply all the fruits and benefits thereof unto
our selves, when as we see him crucified, his body broken, and his blood
powered out before our eyes. It is the Sacrament of our union with Christ, and
communion one with another, wherein we are knit together in the bond of love,
and make profession that we are fellow members of the same body whereof Christ
Jesus is the Head; whereof if we refuse to communicate, having no good and
necessary ground for it, we shall make a rent in the body, and deny the
communion and profession of our love one with another.

. Sect. 5 Of our duties to be performed when Baptism is administered.
So likewise if the Sacrament of Baptism be administered, we are not to
depart, before this holy action be finished, but to continue in the
Congregation, not as idle spectators, but as being tied hereby to perform
diverse Christian duties both unto God, our selves, and the party baptized. In
respect of God, we are to stay the administration of this Sacrament, that we
may show our reverence to his holy ordinances, and glorify his blessed Name,
for granting unto his Church and us, the use of them. Secondly, in respect of
our selves, that we may renew our Covenant with God, by calling it afresh to
our remembrance, together with his sweet mercies, and gracious promises in
Jesus Christ; and also our own vow and covenant which we have made with him in
our Baptism, that we may renew our resolutions and endeavors to perform it
daily in more perfection, and in the mean time take occasion upon our slips
and failings to bewail our wants and imperfections. That we may also call to
mind what fruits we have found of our Baptism, and whether we have felt the
virtue of Christ Jesus his death effectual for the mortification of our
sinful corruptions, and of his Resurrection for our spiritual quickening unto
newness of life. Lastly, in respect of the party baptized we ought to stay,
that we may perform unto him such Christian duties as God requires. First, to
commend him unto God by our prayers, that he may be truly regenerate,
ingraffed into the body of Christ as a lively member, and so made partaker of
his death, merits, and all his benefits. Secondly, that we may, as freemen of
this Christian Corporation by our presence, give our assent to his outward
admission into the Congregation. And finally, that we may, with the rest of the
people, join in praising and giving thanks unto God in his behalf, for
admitting him as a new member into the communion of Saints, and entertaining
him for a servant of his own family. All which duties we neglect, if we
depart before the celebration of the Sacrament, and as much as in us lies,
make them utterly void by our ill example; for if all should do as we do (as
every one may think such liberty belongs unto him, which he sees taken by
another) there should not any at all be left to perform them. The last action
which is to be performed at our departing out of the Congregation (or before,
if the custom be so) is, that if there be any collections for the poor, we
contribute toward them, according to our ability, and their necessity, and
that with a willing and cheerful mind, knowing that 2. Cor. 9. 6, 7. Heb. 13.
16. Prou. 19. 17.
with these sacrifices God is well pleased; that what is thus given, is lent
unto the Lord, who will bountifully repay it in this world, and the world to
come; and given to Christ himself in his poor members, who of his free and
mere grace, will reward these works of mercy, with an heavenly and
everlasting Math. 25. 34.
inheritance in his Kingdom. And these are the public duties of Gods worship
and service, which we ought to perform in the Congregation on his Day: And
that not only in the morning (with which some content themselves) but we must
renew them, or the most of them in the afternoon; as Prayer, hearing the Word,
and singing of Psalms, etc. seeing God even in the time of the Law would have
an evening, as well as morning sacrifice offered unto him, and therefore will
not have his service more negligently performed in this greater light of the
Gospel, wherein he affoordeth us more plentiful means of our salvation. For
the performance of which duties I shall not need to give any other directions,
then those which I have before set down for the morning exercise.

CAP. XLII.
Of such duties as are to be performed on the Lords Day, after our coming from
the Church.

. Sect. 1 That we must meditate upon that which we have heard.
ANd these are the public duties of Gods service, which we are to perform on
his Holy Day. The private duties are diverse. The first is, that at our coming
home we meditate upon those things which we have heard, and not only carefully
recall them to our remembrance, that they may be imprinted in our memories, but
also apply them unto our own use, for the sanctifying of our hearts and
affections, and the reforming of our lives and conuersations, purposing with a
full resolution, that we will put in practice whatsoever we have learned, both
in the forsaking of those vices and sins which we have heard condemned, and
the embracing and performing of those virtues and Christian duties which have
been commended unto us. For if we do not thus make it our own, and (as it
were) cover this holy seed of Gods Word in the furrows of our hearts, the
devil will steal it away, as the birds do the seed that falls by the high
way, and make it altogether unfruitful, so that after much hearing we shall
still remain children in knowledge, and in the spiritual growth of grace and
godliness, and like riuen and leaking vessels, retain little or nothing of
this precious liquor, because it runs out as fast as it comes in.
Secondly, with this Meditation we are to loyne fervent and effectual prayer,
desiring Gods blessing upon that which we have heard, whereby it may be made
effectual for his glory and our own salvation; and the gracious assistance of
his holy Spirit, to bring home not only to our memories, but also to our
hearts and consciences, those things which we have heard and learned, that we
may, as occasion serves, fruitfully practice them in the whole course of our
lives; concluding these our prayers with praise and thanksgiving unto God for
this gracious liberty, in inioying his Sabbaths, and in them the exercises of
Religion and means of our salvation.

. Sect. 2 Of family exercises after we are come from the Church.
At our meals we are to spend the time in such holy and religious conferences,
as may be no less profitable for the cheering and refreshing of our souls,
then our corporal food for the nourishment of our bodies; and in the
performance of such other Christian duties tending to piety and Gods service,
as before we prescribed for other days, which upon the Lords Day, above all
the rest, ought to be done with greatest zeal and devotion; which being
finished, it is good to sing a Psalm to Gods praise, and to read one or more
Chapters of the holy Scriptures. After which Christian exercises, we may, if
time will permit, confer together of those things which we have heard and
learned at the forenoones Sermon, and by causing every one (as it were) to
offer his shot, to make up the whole reckoning, one remembering what another
has forgotten, and he again supplying that wherein the other is defective,
whereby it will come to pass, that whatsoever any one has gathered of these
spiritual treasures, shall not only be more firmly locked up and deeply
imprinted in his own memory, but shall also serve as a common stock for the
enriching of the whole company. And this being done, we are then again by
Prayer and Meditation, to prepare our selves for the well performing of Gods
public service in the evening exercise, as we did in the forenoone; which
being finished in that holy and religious manner before prescribed, and
afterward by some meditation recalled to our remembrance for our own private
use, it will be profitable for governors of families to call together their
children and servants, and either by strength of their memories, or help of
their Notes taken of the Sermon, to repeat as near as they can what has
been delivered, that so the things not marked may be better observed, and that
which was forgotten may be recalled, and by this repetition may more surely be
engraven in the memory. Sometimes also it will be fit and necessary to prevent
negligence in the younger sort, that the governors of the family do examine
them, and require of them an account of that which they have heard, that they
may see how they have profited by the public Ministry. For if they think it
necessary that they should give them an account of their worldly business, or
how they have laid out their moneys when they have sent them to the Market;
then much more should they examine them what spiritual Markets they have made
for the good of their souls, and how much they have gained by the use of Gods
holy Ordinances, for the enriching of them with the treasures of knowledge. In
all which, the Master of the family must show much love and patience,
commending those who answer well, and bearing with the infirmities of such as
are of meaner capacities and weaker memories, when they see that they do their
best, and do not fail through gross negligence, that they may not, by being
shamed and disgraced, be altogether discouraged in these religious exercises.
To which purpose, they must make the best they can of their imperfect answers,
by enlarging and perfecting them, and supplying that in which they are
defective. And on the other side, the inferiors must show themselves tractable
and teachable, and with willingness and cheerfulness submit themselves unto
Gods holy Ordinances, that they may profit by these exercises, and increase
more and more in the knowledge of God and his will.

. Sect. 3 Of other private duties to be done on the Lords Day.
After the finishing of which family exercises, we are to spend the rest of
the time before Supper in other Christian duties, as in visiting and Mat. 25.
35.
comforting those that be sick or in any other great affliction, and
ministering unto their necessities if they stand in need of our help. In making
peace and friendship between those who are at variance, by compounding the
differences which are between them. In meditating upon the great Book of the
creatures, and observing in them the infinite and admirable wisdom and
goodness, power and providence of our gracious God, that we may take occasion
to render unto him the glory and praise of his own works, when we see their
wonderful variety and comely order, their qualities and forms, their beauty
and excellency, their use and profit for the service of man. Observing
likewise in them, such good properties as are worthy our imitation, and be
ashamed that they should exceed us in them, who have the use of reason, and so
many religious helps and means; and their ill properties, that we may avoid
them; taking occasion thereby to be humbled in the remembrance of our fall from
our created purity and integrity, as being the principal cause of all their
defects and imperfections. So also we may in this respect make good use of
the Creatures, when by them we take occasion of some spiritual Meditation: As
when we see their beauty, to think how infinitely beautiful he is that
created them; when we consider how delightful and profitable they are unto
man, to conceive thereby what surpassing excellencies God has prepared for his
own Children in his Kingdom of Glory; when we observe how serviceable they
are to man, to think how much more diligent we should be in serving our great
Lord and Master, who has given both to them and us our birth and being. More
particularly, when we behold the earth whereof we were made, let us take
occasion to think of our own baseness, and that we shall be resolved into
earth again; when we see the flowers of the field, let us think of the
momentany mutability of worldly prosperity, and of Eccl. 12. 7. Esa. 40. 6.
our own mortality, who are like unto them; when we look upon the Suns
glorious brightness, let us take occasion thereby to think of Gods glorious
Majesty, and of the glory and brightness of the Saints in heaven, who shall
far exceed it. Of which, we have our Savior Christ an example for Job. 4.
and the 6.
our imitation, who took occasion from corporal bread and water, to discourse
of the spiritual Manna and Waters of life; from a worldly feast, to Luke 14.
15, 16 17. Job. 7. 38, 39.
speak of a spiritual banquet, and of the living waters of his grace and holy
Spirit, given to all that believe in him. And this is a fit and profitable
exercise on the Lords Day commended unto us by the Scriptures, and practice of
the Church, as hereby it appears, in that the Psalm, which was Psalm. 92.
specially appointed for the Sabbath, contains in it for the most part a
Meditation upon the works of God.

. Sect. 4 That the evening must be spent n religious exercises.
In the evening of the Lords Day we are not to surcease our Christian and
religious exercises, but after we have at supper refreshed our bodies with the
use of Gods creatures, and our souls with holy conferences, we are to spend
some time in singing of Psalms, and in reading the Scriptures, or other
religious and profitable writings. After which duties performed, all in the
family ought to join together in hearty and effectual prayer (not thinking
themselves excused from private duties, because they have been at the public
exercises of Religion) wherein as we are to acknowledge other sins and
imperfections, so those especially we have showed the day past in our cold,
formal, weak, and negligent performance of the duties of Gods service. And as
we are to crave other blessings, so especially that the Lord by his grace and
holy Spirit will bless unto us the means of our salvation, and Ministry of
his Word, whereof we have been partakers on that Day, writing the things we
have learned in our memories and hearts, and inabling us to put them in
practice, and to make use of them in the whole course of our lives. And
finally, as we are to praise God for all his other mercies, so particularly for
giving us time to sanctify his Sabbaths, and suffering us to enjoy the blessed
light of his Word and Gospel, for granting us liberty with such peace and
safety, to tread in his Courts, and to make our suits and supplications known
unto him, with assurance to have them heard and granted. And thus having
finished this holy exercise, and the time of sleep approaching, we must prepare
our selves thereunto with such religious Meditations, as on other days were
prescribed, the which at this time are to be done with extraordinary zeal and
devotion; and so commending our souls and bodies into the hands of God, we are
to desire him that he will watch over and sanctify us so with his grace and
holy Spirit, that we may spend the night also in an holy Rest, being freed from
worldly, carnal, and sinful dreams, and having our fantasies and thoughts,
our hearts and affections, both sleeping and waking, taken up and exercised in
good and godly Meditations: And that he will so season our hearts with the
savor of the Days religious exercises, that even in sleep our dreams may
relish of their sweetness, and when we awake, our thoughts and Meditations
may be wholly taken up and exercised about such holy things, as tend chiefly
to the glory of God, and the everlasting salvation of our souls.

. Sect. 5 That we must perform all our service to God in integrity and
sincerity of heart.
And these are the duties which ought to be done on the Lords Day; which if we
would perform after a right manner, so as they may be acceptable unto God;
then our care must be, that howsoever we have many wants and imperfections in
our best and most religious service, yet that we do perform it with integrity
and sincerity of heart, laboring and striving to the uttermost of our power,
to do all that which God has commanded, and as near as we can in that
manner, and according to all other circumstances as he requires, being
heartily grieved in our souls when we fail, that we can do them no better.
For example, though we find in us natural auersenesse to the strict keeping of
Gods Day holy, and much dullness and spiritual deadness in the duties of Gods
service; yet if our hearts be upright with God, we will labor to make his Day
our delight, and to consecrate it wholly as an holy Rest unto his worship, with
all alacrity and cheerfulness as he requires; and we will strive to find
such Esa. 58. 13.
spiritual sweetness in holy and religious duties, as may make us to delight
much more in them, then in our ordinary food, when we come unto it with hungry
appetites. And finding our corruptions so hanging upon us, that we fail much
in satisfying our holy desires, we will heartily bewail our auersenesse and
untowardness, our drowzinesse and weariness in holy duties, and seeing our
frailties and infirmities, will resolve to labor after more perfection.
Again, howsoever through forgetfulness, negligence, or other distractions, we
may omit some of those duties before prescribed, for the spending of the Lords
Day, yet if our hearts be upright before God, we will not bless and please
our selves in this negligence; but endeavor in some sort to perform them all
as we are able, without omitting any of them; As both the private and public
means of Gods worship, Prayer, Meditation, hearing, reading, singing Psalms,
holy conferences and the rest, so far forth as God grants unto us time and
opportunity. And if we have through forgetfulness or negligence omitted any,
we will be unfeignedly sorry for it, and purpose amendment for the time to come.
Furthermore if we sanctify this Day with integrity of heart, then will we
consecrate the whole Day to this holy Rest as God has appointed, and not
abridge him of any part of his due, or voluntarily spend any hour of the Day
in profane and worldly exercises. And howsoever we may through our frailty
and corruption be often overtaken, thinking our own thoughts, speaking our
own words, and doing sometime our own works on the Lords Day, yet if our
hearts be upright before God, we will not please our selves in this
profanation, but our hearts smiting us for it, we will repent, make humble
confession of it among our other sins, and earnestly desire to be freed, not
only from guilt and punishment of it by Gods gracious pardon, but also from
the corruption it self for the time to come by his grace and holy Spirit.
Finally, having labored to perform these duties of the Lords Day in the
greatest perfection we are able, and having in some poor measure satisfied
our selves in them; yet if our hearts be upright with God, we will not be proud
of any thing which we have done, nor exalt our selves above others which we
think come short of us, but we will humbly praise God for that which we have
received, and ascribe all that is good in us to his free grace and holy Spirit;
yea, we will easily discern and acknowledge our best actions stained with so
many corruptions, and mingled with so many imperfections, that when we have
done all we can, we are but unprofitable servants, who are sufficiently
rewarded if we be not punished.

THE FOVRTH BOOK, CONTAINING IN IT THE PROPERTIES OF A GODLY LIFE, and of all
the duties which are required unto it.
CAP. I.
That all duties universally of a godly life, must be performed in sincerity
and integrity of heart.

. Sect. 1 Of that universal and total obedience which is required.
Having showed what the godly life is, and the duties which are required unto
it generally in the whole course of our conversation, and more specially those
which belong unto every day, it now follows, according to that order which we
have propounded, that we entreat of the properties of this Christian life, and
the duties belonging to it, which may serve as marks and signs, whereby we
may know them, and also distinguish them from all other which are false and
counterfeit. All which may be referred to two heads, the first sort, respecting
the duties themselves, the other our manner of doing them, and that both in
respect of the action, and also the time of their continuance. The first
property respecting the duties themselves, or the matter and form of them, is
Universality; for God being the universal Creator, preserver, and Sovereign
Lord of all things, will have us wholly taken up in performing of all duties of
his service, and requires of us universal and total obedience, both in
respect of the subject and object of it. In respect of the subject or person
that performs it, the Lord requires the obedience, not of some few or many
parts alone, but of the whole man, internally in the soul, and all the
faculties of it, especially the heart and will; and externally, in all the
powers and parts of the body, and chiefly our tongues and speeches, and our
works and actions. Internally, God inioyneth us to serve him in the duties of
a godly life, with all our hearts and souls, which is that wherein he chiefly
delights, and without which, all outward actions, be they never so formal
and glorious, are vain and worthless, yea loathsome and odious in his sight.
And heereunto there are two things required, which are so like and near in
nature, that they are commonly taken the one for the other, but yet (as I take
it) they may be distinguished, though never severed.

. Sect. 2 Of integrity and sincerity.
The first is integrity, whereby we serve the Lord in all Christian duties with
our whole hearts, according to Gods Commandment; Thou Deuteronomy. 10 12. and 6. 5.
and 26. 16. Math. 22. 37. Psalm. 119. 10.
shall fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and
to serve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. The
which David performed, as he professes: With my whole heart have I sought
thee; O let me not wander from thy Commandments. Unto which is opposed,
serving God by the halues, lamely and haltingly, dividing our hearts between
him and his enemies, the devil, Idols, and the earthly Mammon; 1 King. 18. 21.
like the Israelites which halted between God and Baal, the true Jehovah, 2.
King. 17. 33.
and Idols of the Heathens, and the Samaritans, who feared the Lord, and served
their own gods. And of such the Prophet Hosea complains; Their heart (says
he) is divided; namely, between the true Jehovah, and Hos. 10. 2.
their Idols. And the Apostle James calls them double-minded, who Iam. 1. 8.
are unstable in all their ways, one while offering unto God some formal
service, and another while serving the world, and their own lusts. And as they
have double hearts, so also double tongues, speaking vanity Psalm. 12. 2.
to their neighbors with flattering lips, and with an heart and an heart, or a
double heart. The second is sincerity and uprightness of heart, without any
mixture of guile and falsehood, when as we worship God in simplicity, truth,
and singleness of heart, and in performing the duties of his service, do lay
aside all carnal, worldly and by-respects, and do them only in conscience of
his Commandment, and out of a desire to glorify him by our obedience to his
holy will, seeking him therein with our whole hearts, and not our selves and
our own worldly ends, like servile mercenaries, who serve their masters, not
out of any love they bear him, but only for their own gain and advantage.
Unto which is opposed dissimulation and hypocrisy; which makes men to content
themselves with outward shows, which have no substance; with outward
profession, without all sound practice; with a dead carcass of Religion,
without the soul of sincerity, or any virtue and vigor appearing in their
actions; and with a formal, false and counterfeit service in the outward man,
without any substance or truth in the inward parts.

. Sect. 3 Reasons moving us to embrace integrity and sincerity. 1. Because the
Lord chiefly loves and delights in it.
Now because these two are never severed, neither in the subject, nor in our
practice, I will not disioyne them in my discourse; but will show, first, the
reasons which may move us to perform all our service unto God, and the duties
of a godly life with integrity and sincerity; and then the means whereby we
may attain unto it. For the former, we are to embrace this integrity and
sincerity, truth and uprightness of heart in all duties of a godly life,
because the Lord chiefly loves and delights in them, preferring them much
before all outward duties, seem they never so glorious. For he loves truth in
the inward parts, and esteems it far Psa. 51. 6, 16, 17
above all legal sacrifices, and therefore after all they are abrogated and
abolished, retains it still in all duties of his service. And as David also
1. Chron. 29. 17.
speaks in another place; He tries the heart, and has pleasure in
uprightness. Neither does he see as man sees; for man looks to the outward
appearance; 1. Sam. 16. 7.
but the Lord looks upon the heart. Whereof it is, that he chiefly requires
this integrity and sincerity in all his service; Thou shall keep his Statutes
and Judgments with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. So Ioshuah: Deuteronomy.
26. 16.
Fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and truth. And Samuel; Fear the
Josh. 24. 14. 1. Sam. 12. 24.
Lord, and serve him in truth, and with all your heart. And this God requires
of Abraham, Walk before me, and be upright: And David of his son Genesis 17. 1.
1. Chron. 28. 9.
Solomon; Know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart,
and with a willing mind. And finally, our Savior faith, that he requires it
of all who offer to do him any service, that as he is a Spirit, so also they
John 4. 24.
should worship in spirit and in truth. And as we must generally observe it in
all Gods worship, so in all the parts and duties of it: For we must call upon
Psalm. 145. 18.
God in sincerity and truth, if we desire that he should hear us; we must
with David, Praise God with uprightness of heart; and, in singing Psalm. 119. 9.
Psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, we must not chiefly respect the
vocal tune, but make melody unto the Lord with our hearts, as the Apostle
speaks. Col. 3. 16. 1. Cor. 5. 8.
We must keep unto God the spiritual Passover, not with the old leaven of
malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. We
must do the works of mercy, and give our alms with our hearts, as well as
with our hands, for the Lord loves a cheerful giver: And 2. Cor. 9. 7. Col.
3. 23.
in a word, whatsoever duty we perform unto others, we must do it heartily,
as unto the Lord, and not unto men. On the other side, he condemns
dissimulation and hypocrisy, as vices which are most loathsome and odious unto
him: yea so much does the Lord abhor it, that in the Law he Exodus 12. 15. 1.
Cor. 5. 8. Leuit. 22. 19. Deuteronomy. 22. 9, 10.
forbids the very signs and shows of it. He would have no leaven in his
Passover, nor their garments made of linsey-woolsey, nor their fields plowed
with an Ox and an Ass, nor sown with seeds of diverse kinds; not that God
cared for these things, but to show, under these types and shadows, how much
he detesteth all hypocrisy and double-dealing.

. Sect. 4 That our imperfect obedience is accepted of God, if if it be done in
sincerity and integrity.
Secondly, this may move us to embrace integrity and sincerity, because the
Lord so highly esteems it, that he accepts of our obedience as perfect
which springs from it, though it be stained with much corruption, and joined
with many imperfections. Whereof it is, that in the Scriptures integrity and
perfection are promiscuously put the one for the other; and those are said to
have been perfect before God, who in simplicity and uprightness of heart
labored after perfection, and served God in sincerity and truth; as Noah,
Abraham, Job, David, Asa, Zachary and Elizabeth, though they had many
corruptions and imperfections, which in the Scriptures are recorded of them.
And contrariwise the best graces, or rather the most glorious shows of them,
and the most resplendent and formal actions which are not joined with it, are
no better at the best then glorious sins in Gods sight: whereof it is that
the Lord specially Iam. 3. 17. 1. Tim. 1. 5. Joel 2. 12, 13.
requires in all our graces and virtuous actions, that they be in sincerity
and truth, without dissimulation and hypocrisy. So that wisdom which is from
above, is without hypocrisy and dissimulation, though carnal men think them
most wise who most excel in it. Our faith must be unfeigned, and so must our
repentance also, and with our whole heart; and not like Ahabs, in outward show
only, dissembled and disguized. Our love must not be in speech and tongue
only, but in deed and truth: we must call 1. John 3. 18.
upon God in truth and sincerity, or else our prayers will be but mere
liplabour, which God will not hear or regard. And therefore David uses his
sincerity in praying, as an argument to persuade the Lord to give him audience;
Give ear (says he) unto my prayers, which go not out of fained lips. And
Ezechias his integrity of life, as a reason to move him for therepealing Psalm.
145. Esa. 29. 13.
of the sentence of death, and prolonging of his days. Remember now, O Lord,
(says he) I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a
perfect heart, etc. Finally, our preaching must not be deceitful, like those
which make Merchandise of the Word; but as of sincerity, of God, and 2. Cor. 2.
17. Act. 10. 33. 1. These. 2. 13.
in the sight of God. And our hearing likewise of the Word, must be in
sincerity, as in Gods presence, and as those that hear the Word, not of man,
but of God. For otherwise our seeming graces and virtuous actions, like
beautiful pictures which want life, spirit and motion, are not substantial in
Gods sight, but shows and shadows only, if integrity and sincerity be
wanting, not looking unto Gods glory, or showing any love and obedience unto
him, but only unto our worldly and carnal ends and by-respects of our own
pleasure, profit or preferment.

. Sect. 5 That the soundness of all graces and holy duties consists in the
sincerity of them.
Thirdly, we must perform all holy duties of a godly life in sincerity and
integrity, because otherwise we cannot approve our selves for sound Romans 2.
28, 29.
Christians accepted of God, what outward show soever we make; nor our badges
and signs of Christianity such, as will give unto us any assurance that we are
in the Covenant of grace: for as the Apostle says, He is not a Jew which is
one outwardly, neither is that Circumcision which is outward in the flesh; But
he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Circumcision is that of the heart, in
the Spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of God. And
though such duties as are done in hypocrisy, may get the applause of men, and
gain their praises, causing them who do them to be magnified and extolled;
yet God no further regards them, then to vilify, condemn and punish them;
For he sees not as man sees, for man 1. Sam. 16. 7.
looks but to the outward appearance; but God looks unto the heart: In
which regard, that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the
sight Luke 16. 15.
of God, as our Savior speaks.

. Sect. 6 Of the rewards of sincerity and integrity.
Fourthly, because the Lord does richly reward this integrity and sincerity,
with the blessings of this life, and that which is to come: For the Psalm. 84.
11.
Lord is a Sun and a Shield, he will give grace and glory; and no good thing
will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. In this life he multiplyeth
all his favors upon them who serve him in sincerity and truth. For, he is good
unto them which are clean in heart. And to such he limiteth all his gracious
Psalm. 73. 1.
promises, which he performs unto them upon this condition only. So he
promises unto the Kings of Israel and Judah, that he will confirm 1. King.
2. 4. and 3. 6. and 9. 4, 5.
their Kingdom unto them, and their posterity after them, if they would walk
before him in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul. Whereof it
is that Solomon affirms, that the Lord kept Covenant, 2. Chron. 6. 14.
and showed mercy unto his servants that walked before him with all their
hearts. And therefore Ezechias entreats God to perform this promise unto
Esa. 38. 3.
him and his posterity, grounding his faith on his observing this condition,
seeing he had walked before God in truth, and with a perfect heart. So God is
near unto them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth; Psalm.
145. 18.
and will save and deliver them from all perils and dangers, and out of the
hands of all their enemies: For he saves the upright in heart, as David
affirms. Psalm. 7. 10.
And so Solomon says, that the righteousness of the upright shall deliver
Prou. 11. 6. and 28. 1.
them; which makes them bold and confident as Lions in perilous times, as
elsewhere he speaks. In the life to come, God also crowns the Psalm. 84. 11.
sincere and upright service of the faithful with joy and happiness: for he
gives not only grace in this life, but glory also in the life to come, to
those that walk uprightly. And such shall here dwell in his Tabernacle, and
Psalm. 15. 2. Prou. 28. 18. Psalm. 32. 2. and 119. 1. Math. 5. 8.
hereafter in the Mountain of his holiness. So Solomon says, that he who
walks uprightly, shall be saved: and David affirms, that the upright shall
dwell in Gods presence: and our Savior Christ says, that they shall be
blessed in the vision and fruition of God, which is the height and perfection
of our heavenly happiness. And therefore seeing this integrity and sincerity
is such a precious treasure, as makes us both happy and blessed here, and in
the world to come; it is no marvel if the faithful have always esteemed it
as their chiefest and choycest Jewel, preferring it before all earthly things,
yea even life it self; as we see in the example of Job, who patiently suffered
himself to be stripped of all his worldly substance, but clasped so fast to
his integrity, when his wife and friends would have pulled it from him, that he
would not leave his hold to the very death; God forbid (says he) that I should
justify you, (to wit, whilst you go about Job 27. 5, 6.
to censure and condemn me of dissimulation and hypocrisy) till I dye, I will
not remove mine integrity from me. My righteousness I hold fast, and will not
let it go, my heart shall not reproach me, so long as I live. If then we
delight in that wherein God chiefly delights, and will do that which he
requires, and flee from that which he abhors; if we would have our selves
and our service accepted of him as perfect, which notwithstanding are full of
imperfections and corruptions: If we would have any true saving grace, or
perform any Christian duty pleasing unto God; if we would be numbered amongst
sound Christians, or would enjoy any of Gods blessings in this world, or in the
world to come, then let us labor daily in the use of all good means whereby
we may attain unto this sincerity and integrity of heart, and perform all the
duties of Gods service and of a godly life in uprightness and truth.

CAP. II.
Of the means whereby we may attain unto integrity and sincerity.

. Sect. 1 The first means is, to set God before our eyes, and our selves in
his presence.
NOw the means hereof are diverse. First, we must set God before our eyes, and
our selves in his presence, performing all Ier. 17. 10, 11.
the duties of his service, not as those who have men only to look upon and
censure us, who alone behold the outward actions, but as in the sight of God,
who searches and tries the very secrets of the heart and reins, and knows
whether our hearts be upright, and our actions performed in sincerity and
truth, or deceitful and done in hypocrisy, not aiming at his glory in obeying
his Commandment, but at by-respects and worldly ends: Herein following the
example of David, who desiring to walk in the way of Gods Commandments Psalm.
16. 8.
with an upright heart, used to set God always before his eyes. For carrying
our selves in all our conversation as in Gods presence, is the means to make
us upright in all our ways, whereof it is that this phrase of walking with
God, is used, to signify the integrity of Gods servants in all Genesis 5. 22, 24.
their conversation; and God himself persuading Abraham to uprightness, Genesis
17. 1.
exhorts him to walk before him, as a means thereof; Walk before me (says
he) and be upright. So David uses it as an argument to persuade 1. Chron. 28.
9.
Solomon to serve the Lord with a perfect heart, and a willing mind, because
the Lord searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the
thoughts. And Paul in his preaching shunneth all deceit in handling 2. Cor. 2.
17.
Gods Word, and uses all sincerity, because he spoke as in Gods sight and
presence.

. Sect. 2 The second means is to meditate on the excellency, profit, and
necessity of integrity and sincerity.
The second means is, to meditate on the excellency, profit, and necessity of
this sincerity and uprightness of heart. The excellency herein appears,
Psalm. 8, 4. 11.
in that the Lord so highly esteems it, that he approves them as perfect,
who serve him with this integrity, though they be never so full of wants and
weaknesses, and neglects, yea severely punishes the most glorious works of
Hypocrites which are done without it. It is most profitable, seeing God
withholdeth nothing from them that walk uprightly; for he is unto them a Sun
and a Shield; a Sun for consolation, a Shield for protection; a Sun to give
them life, a Shield to defend life given; a Sun to make them fruitful in all
good, and a Shield to preserve them from all evil; and he will give unto them
grace in this life, and glory and happiness in the life to come. Finally, the
necessity of this integrity and sincerity hereby is manifest, seeing the best
graces which are without it, are false and counterfeit, our wisdom devilish,
our faith dead, our repentance fained, our love worldly and carnal, our zeal
dissembled, our Religion hypocrisy, and all the seeming good duties which we
perform, of no esteem in Gods sight. For if sincerity be wanting, our prayers
are but lip-labor, our preaching a kind of merchandising for the hire of
worldly gain, as the Apostle implies; our receiving 2. Cor. 2. 17.
the Sacraments no more accepted in us, then in Judas, and Simon Math. 6. 2.
Magus; our giving of alms, not being done with upright hearts to please God,
but to be praised of men, shall have the hypocrites reward; that is, glory
before men, and eternal shame before God, his Saints and holy Angels.

. Sect. 3 The third means of integrity and sincerity.
The third means is, to consider that nothing shall be wanting unto us, for
protection from dangers, or supply of necessaries, if we will serve God in
sincerity. For he is all-sufficient without the help of inferior means, and
a most powerful and bountiful Master, who is both able and willing to reward
and protect all such as do him faithful service; so as there is no cause why
we should halt between him and the world, or give any place to dissimulation
and hypocrisy, for fear or favor, as though we could no otherwise escape
danger, or obtain things necessary for the supplying of our wants, unless we
be more careful to please men then God; seeing he is all-sufficient in
himself to protect and provide for us, and has both the hands and hearts of
all men at his disposing, so as they can neither help nor hurt us, but so
far forth as he is pleased to use them as instruments to serve his
providence. And this argument the Lord uses to persuade Abraham unto this
sincerity; I am God all-sufficient; walk before Genesis 17. 1.
me and be upright. As though he should say, Though thy idolatrous friends
forsake thee, and thy heathenish enemies oppose thee, because thou have
renounced their Idols, and wholly devoted thy self to worship me in truth; yet
let not this discourage thee in thy sincerity, seeing I am all-sufficient to
reward and defend thee. So the Prophet tells Asa, that 2. Chron. 16. 9.
there was no cause why he had relied upon the King of Syria, and not upon the
Lord his God, seeing he is mighty and all-sufficient to preserve all those
whose heart is perfect toward him.

. Sect. 4 The fourth means is, to watch over our hearts.
The fourth means is, that we keep a narrow watch over our hearts, laboring
daily to approve their sincerity unto God. For naturally they Ier. 17. 10.
are deceitful, and much hypocrisy and dissimulation lies lurking in them.
In which respect it is necessary, that we often examine them, with what purpose
we perform good actions, what causes move us, and at what ends we aim. And
if we find them worldly and carnal, let us labor to purge them from these
corruptions, according to that of the Apostle James; Cleanse your hands, ye
sinners, and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded. Jam. 4. 8.
And when we find them ready to halt between God and the world, either for
fear, or for the getting of some earthly benefit, and to start aside from
their sincerity, we are to call them back, and finding other bonds too weak
to bind these fugitives unto sincerity in Gods service, we are to tie them
hereunto by solemn covenant, according to the example of Asa and Josiah, who
thus bound themselves and their subjects, 2 Chronicles. 15. 12. and 34. 31.
that with all their hearts and souls they would seek and serve the Lord.

. Sect. 5 The fifth means, to meditate on the Day of Judgment.
Finally, let us often meditate on the Day of Judgment, when as the secrets of
all hearts shall be disclosed, and all hidden things brought to Eccles. 12. 14.
2. Cor. 5. 10.
light, and laid open to the view of men and Angels; according to that of
Ecclesiastes; God will bring every work into Judgment, with every secret
thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. And of the Apostle Paul: We
must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, that every man may
receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it
be good or bad. And then naked sincerity will shine most gloriously, when the
gilded veil of hypocrisy being pulled off, the filthy corruption which was
hid under it, will appear ugly and abominable in the sight of the holy Saints
and blessed Angels. Then shall the upright in heart hold up their heads in the
confidence of a good conscience, when the hypocrites and dissemblers shall be
confounded with shaine, their deceit and secret wickedness being discovered in
the sight of all men. Then shall they who have served God in sincerity and
truth, receive their heavenly Inheritance with triumphant joy, when guilefull
and double-hearted men shall be banished out of Gods presence, and cast into
outer darkness, Math. 24. 51.
where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

CAP. III.
That we must join with inward integrity, the service of the body and the
outward man.

. Sect. 1 That God requires outward service to be joined with the inward.
But howsoever the Lord does chiefly require and delight in the inward service
of the soul, and the integrity and sincerity of the heart; yet does he not
rest in it alone, but requires also the service of the body and outward man,
and that we should at all times, and upon all occasions, express and approve
our inward piety in our external practice, and the uprightness of our hearts,
which is only known to him, by our holiness and righteousness shining in
the whole course of our lives and conversation, which is subject to man's view,
that thereby we may be justified, that is, declared righteous before them, as
by the other we are known unto our selves to be justified by faith before God,
of which, that inward holiness and obedience is a principal fruit. And
because every one would be ready to boast of the sincerity of the heart which
cannot be discerned, God would have us to approve and make it known, by
bringing forth the fruits of it in our outward and bodily service. So the
Apostle exhorts us, not to let sin reign in our bodies, that we should obey
it in the lusts thereof; neither yield our Romans 6. 12, 13.
members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield our selves
unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and our members as instruments
of righteousness unto God. And as we have yielded our members servants to
uncleanness and to iniquity, so we should now yield our members servants to
righteousness Verse. 19.
unto holiness. That we should present, not only our souls, but our bodies
likewise, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is our
reasonable Romans 12. 1. 1. These. 4. 3.
service, that we should possess our vessels in purity and honor, and
preserve our bodies from all defilement, as it becomes the Temples of the 1.
Cor. 3. 16.
holy Ghost. For God, who has created, redeemed, and does continually preserve
both soul and body, will be served and glorified by them both, and as he is
in these respects, Lord and owner of the whole man; so he will have the whole
to serve him, according to that of the Apostle: Ye are bought with a price,
therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirits 1. Cor. 6. 20.
which are Gods. The inward service of the heart therefore is not sufficient,
unless it be expressed in the outward service of the body, but we must be
sanctified thorowout, and our whole Spirit, and soul and body, must be
preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1. These. 5. 23.
And we must cleanse our selves from all filthiness, as well of the flesh as of
the Spirit, and perfect our holiness in the fear of God. We must with the
Apostle, 2 Cor. 7. 1. Act. 24. 16. Heb. 13. 18. Romans 12. 17. Inter Christianum
and gentilem non fides tantum debet, sed etiam vita distinguere, and diuersam
religionem per diuersa opera monstrare. Hier. ad Celant.
exercise our selves to have our consciences void of offense, both toward God
and toward men; and labor not only to have in all things a good conscience
before him, but also to live honestly in the view of the world; and provide
things honest in the sight of all men, as well as those which are holy and
religious in the sight of God. For as one says, Not only faith ought to
distinguish between a Christian and an heathen, but the life also; and our
diverse religions ought to be demonstrated and showed by our diverse works. Yea
in truth, these will always necessarily and inseparably go together; neither
is it possibly for a man to have a sincere and upright heart, but it will show
it self in the outward conversation, words, and actions, seeing it is the
fountain and root from which they flow and spring; and such as it is, either
good or evil, clean or polluted, such will they be also. For if the heart be
the Inditer of a good matter, the tongue will Psalm. 45. 1. and 108. 1.
be the pen of a ready Writer; If the heart be prepared, so will the tongue
also, and both joining together, will sing and give praise; whereof it is that
the Apostle James concludes, that if any man seem religious, and bridleth not
Iam. 1. 26, 27.
his tongue, this man's religion is vain. And also, that pure Religion and
undefiled before God, will show it self in the works of mercy and Christian
charity before men: for as in the bodily, so in the spiritual estate, the
health and welfare of the heart is best discerned by the pulse in the hand,
neither can there be an upright heart, where the actions are unjust. And
therefore the Psalmist describing a true Citizen of Heaven, does join heart,
hand, and tongue all together; He that has clean hands and a pure heart,
speaks Psalm. 24. 4. and 15. 2.
the truth from it, and has not lift up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn
deceitfully.

. Sect. 2 Reasons moving us to perform outward service.
Now the reasons which may move us to join outward practice with inward
integrity, respect God, our neighbors, or our selves. In respect Mat. 5. 16.
of God, first, because he commands that we have not only in our selves the
oil of Grace, but that we also cause the light of it to shine outwardly before
men. He would have us inwardly to repent with unfeigned contrition in our
hearts, but withal, that we bring forth fruits meet for repentance in Mat. 3.
8.
our lives. He desires above all that we should love him with all our hearts
Ioh. 14. 15. and 15. 12.
and souls, but he would have us also to approve the sincerity of our
affection, by keeping his Commandments; especially, by loving one another as
Christ has loved us. Secondly, we must bring forth the fruits of our inward
sincerity in our outward practice, that men seeing the light of our Mat. 5. 16.
1. Pet. 2. 12.
godly lives, may take occasion thereby to glorify our heavenly Father, for
herein he is glorified, if we bring forth much fruit; the which, being Ioh.
15. 8.
the maine and supreme end of all things, we are, in whatsoever we do,
chiefly to aim at it, as the Apostle exhorts. Thirdly, we must join 1.
Cor. 10. 31.
outward conformity unto our inward sincerity, to testify our thankfulness
unto God for his innumerable benefits both spiritual and corporal, without
which we shall fall into the vice of ingratitude, which is so odious both to
God and men. In respect of our neighbors also, we must approve our inward
piety by our outward practice, that we may edify them by our good example;
for if our lights shine before them, they will glorify our Father which is in
heaven; if we have our conversation honest among Mat. 5. 16. 1. Pet. 2. 12.
unbelievers, they will give glory to God in the day of their visitation.
Secondly, to avoid offense which they are ready to take, when they see our
conversation 2. Cor. 6. 3.
contrary to our profession. Now we must give no offense in any thing, because
there is a fearful woe denounced against those by whom offenses Mat. 18. 7.
come, and that justly, because, as much as in them lies, they destroy those
for whom Christ has died. Thirdly, that we may hereby gain them 1. Cor. 8. 11.
to Christ, when they see our holy conversation coupled with fear. Wherein we
are to follow the Apostles example, who pleased all men in all things, not 1.
Pet. 3. 1, 2.
seeking his own profit, but of many that they might be saved. In respect of
our selves, we are to approve our sincerity by our outward practice in an holy
conversation, that hereby we may be assured that our hearts are upright before
God, seeing the goodness of the tree can no otherwise be known, Mat. 7. 17.
Iam. 2. 27.
then by the good fruits which it bears, nor the life of Grace discerned, but
by the breath of holy and righteous words and actions. Secondly, because we can
no otherwise have the peace of a good conscience, in the assurance of our
election and salvation, unless we bring forth in our lives the 2. Pet. 1. 10.
fruits of sanctification. Thirdly, because by our outward obedience our inward
graces are exercised, and by exercise increased, which otherwise will faint and
languish. Neither will God give us the Talents of his graces, unless we will
put them out to use, that he may be glorified, and our brethren aduantaged by
their increase. Whereas if like good Vines we be fruitful in the duties of
piety and righteousness, he will purge and prune us, that Joh. 15. 2.
we may bring forth more fruit. Fourthly, that we may adorn our profession,
when as we walk worthy that high calling whereunto we are called, and approve
Ephesians. 4. 1. Mat. 5. 48.
our selves to be the children of God, and heirs of heaven, by resembling our
heavenly Father in holiness and righteousness; according to that of the
Apostle; As he that has called you, is holy, so be ye holy in all 1. Pet. 1.
15, 16, 17.
manner of conversation; Because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy. And
if ye call him Father, who without respect of persons judges according to
every man's work, pass the time of your soiourning here in fear.

. Sect. 3 That Christian apology and outward profession of the Truth is
required.
Now as we are to exercise the wholly body in the outward practice of
obedience, and the duties of a godly life, as our eyes in seeing, our ears in
hearing, etc. so especially must we approve our practice of piety, both by our
words and works. By our words, both by Christian profession and holy
communication. For if our hearts be upright before God, and serve him in
sincerity and truth, then will we make an outward profession of what we
inwardly believe, namely, that God is our God, and we his Children and
servants, and that we embrace his truth of Religion, and will in all things
conform our selves unto his revealed will So the Apostle says, that, as with
the heart man believes unto righteousness, Romans 10. 10.
so with the mouth he confesses to salvation. And the Psalmist; I believed,
Psalm. 116. 10.
and therefore I spoke; the which, as it was his own practice, as appears in
those words, I will declare thy Name unto my brethren, in the Psalm. 22. 22, 23.
midst of the Congregation will I praise thee: so in the next words he
tells us, that it is generally the practice of all that fear God; Ye that
fear the Lord, praise him, all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him. The which
profession of our faith ought not to be forced and constrained, but free and
liberal, as often as we have any hope thereby to glorify God, or edify those
that hear us; according to that of the Apostle Peter; Sanctify the Lord God
in your hearts, and be ready always to give an 1. Pet. 3. 15.
answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you, with
meekness and fear. For otherwise, if our profession is likely to tend to
Gods dishonor, by exposing his Truth to skorne and blasphemy, and our persons
to the rage and violence of profane miscreants, our Saviors rule must take
place, Cast not that which is holy unto Dogs, nor pearls Mat. 7.
before Swine, etc. And as we are to be free and cheerful in our
profession; so also to be bold and courageous, not fearing the face of man,
nor denying or suppressing the truth, for fear or favor, either to please
men, or to avoid our own trouble, according to the example of David; who
professes that he would speak of Gods Testimonies Psalm. 119. 46.
before Kings, and would not be ashamed; and the Apostle Paul, who professed
before the Governor, that after that way which was called Act. 24. 14.
heresy, by the enemies of Gods Truth, he worshipped the God of his Fathers,
believing all that was written in the Law and the Prophets. To which purpose,
we are always to remember that saying of our Savior Christ; Whosoever shall
confess me before men, him will I confess also before Mat. 10. 32, 33.
my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him
will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. Secondly, we must
testify our integrity of heart by our holy communication, the principal scope
whereof must be, the glory of God, according to the example of David, who
professes that he had not hid Gods righteousness Psalm. 40. 10.
within his heart, but had declared his faithfulness and salvation, and had
not concealed his loving kindness from the great Congregation. And next unto
it, our speech must tend to the furthering of our own salvation, and
edification of our brethren. For if our hearts be sincere and holy, such also
will our conferences be, as before we have showed more at large.

. Sect. 4 That we must practice what we know, in our works and actions.
Secondly, with our words and outward profession, we must join also our
works and actions, in doing service unto God, without which we cannot
approve our hearts to be upright before him. Neither is it sufficient to make
us accepted of God, that we speak religiously, and make a glorious profession
of the Truth, unless our practice be suitable in the works of holiness and
righteousness. It is not enough (as our Savior has taught us) to cry, Lord,
Lord, for entering into Gods Kingdom, unless we Mat. 7. 21, 23.
do the will of his Father which is in heaven; no nor yet that we have
prophesied and preached in his Name; seeing we shall be excluded and depart from
him, if we be workers of iniquity. For not the hearers and talkers of the Law,
but the Romans 2. 13.
doers thereof shall be justified. Neither will God render unto us according to
our outward profession, but according to our deeds, and we shall receive at
Christ's Romans 2. 6. 2. Cor. 5. 10. Tit. 1. 16.
appearing to Judgment, not according to our words and shows, but according
to that we have done, whether it be good or bad. Yea in truth, bare profession
without practice, does make us the more odious in Gods sight. And if we deny
God in our works, who^ we profess to know with our words, we become abominable
hypocrites, who dishonor him more by their sins then any other. In which
regard, the Lord would have none to make profession of Religion, who do not
endeavor to practice what they know in their lives. What have thou to do to
declare my Statutes, or that thou should take my Covenant Psalm. 50. 16.
into thy mouth; seeing thou hate instruction, and castest my words behind
thee? And such our Savior reprooueth; Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do Luke
6. 46.
not the things which I say? Before therefore we compass Gods Altar, to offer
unto him with our tongues the sacrifice of praise, we must first with David,
wash our hands in innocence. If we would approve the sincerity of Psalm. 26. 6.
our faith, and outward confession of the Truth, we must with those believers
in the Acts of the Apostles, show it by our deeds. If we would make it manifest
Act. 19. 18.
that our hearts are inwardly inflamed with the love of God, we must show it by
our actions rather then by our words; according to that of our Savior; If ye
love me, keep my Commandments: And again, He that has my John. 14. 15, 21.
Commandments and keeps them, is he that loves me. Ye are my friends, if
ye do whatsoever I command you. John 15. 14.


. Sect. 5 Diverse reasons persuading us to good works.
By all which it appears, that unto the duties of a godly life, there is
required real practice in our works, as well as verbal profession with our
mouths, neither does an holy profession alone make any man holy, but only
binds him to the duties of holiness. The which, though it be acknowledged
of all men, yet because it fares with the most, as with men grievously sick,
who having lost their appetite, approve good meat in their judgment and
discourse, but when they are moved to eat of it, put it by, because it is
loathsome to their corrupted stomachs; therefore it will not be amiss that we
enforce this point a little further, that I may set an edge on their appetite,
and as the Apostle requires, may provoke them unto Heb. 10. 24.
love and good works. First therefore let us consider, that as the Lord
requires an upright heart and holy profession, so also the fruits of them both
in good works. For he would have us, not only hearers of his Word, but also
doers of it; and charge us to do good unto all, to be rich in good works,
Iam. 1. 22. Gal. 6. 10. 1. Tim. 6. 17, 18. 2. These. 3. 13. Tit. 2. 14. Luke 1.
74, 75. 1. Tim. 2. 10.
and never weary of well-doing. Secondly, that he has created us unto good
works, that we should walk in them, and redeemed us, that we should not
only do good works, but also be zealous in doing of them. Thirdly, that
they are the chief ornaments of Christians, which much more deck and
beautify them in the sight of God and all good men, then all Jewels, gold, and
gorgeous apparel. Fourthly, let us consider the exceeding profit of them,
seeing God does richly reward them, both in this life and the life to come.
Fifthly, that they are notable and singular means to assure us of all Gods
graces in this life, and eternal happiness in the life to come; whereby we
attain unto spiritual comfort, peace of conscience, and joy in the holy
Ghost. For they are the assured signs of our election and effectual calling,
seeing if we do these things, we shall never fall. They are the 2. Pet. 1. 10.
fruits of our regeneration and new birth, whereby we are assured of our
spiritual life, even as the natural life is known by action and motion; and
that we are trees of righteousness, which Gods own hand has planted; for the
tree is known by the fruits, seeing a good tree cannot bring forth Math. 7.
17. and 12. 33.
those which are evil; nor an evil those which are good. They assure us of
our justification: for he that does righteousness, is righteous, as the
Apostle John 1. Job. 3. 7. Romans 2. 13.
tells us. They are signs of our adoption and spiritual kindred with
Christ: for they that hear the Word and do it, are his brethren and sisters.
By them we may be assured that our wisdom is spiritual and heavenly;
according Mat. 12. 50.
to that of the Apostle James; Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge
amongst you? Let him show out of a good conversation his works with Iam. 3. 13.
meekness of wisdom. That our faith also is lively and justifying. For
they, and they only do truly believe in God, who are careful to maintain
good works; seeing as it inwardly purifieth the heart, so also it works
outwardly Tit. 3. 8. Act. 15. 9. Gal. 5. 6. Iam. 2. 14. 17. 26.
by love. And therefore the Apostle James concludes, that such a faith as
brings not forth these fruits, does nothing profit us for our justification
and salvation; because it is dead, and not a living body, but a dead carcass
which breaths not. So that though works do not justify us, but faith only
(for we are first made righteous, before we can bring forth the fruits of
righteousness) yet that faith which is alone, does not justify us, because it
is a dead faith, and therefore cannot apply unto us Christ our Righteousness.
Though they do not justify us before God, yet they justify us before men,
that is, declare that we are justified. Though they be not causes, yet they are
necessary and inseparable effects of our justification. Though they are not
required unto the act of justification, but faith only uniting us unto Christ
our Righteousness, yet unto the party justified: for as he that does
righteousness, is righteous, so he that is righteous, 1. Ioh. 3. 7.
does righteousness, the cause and effect always concurring and going
together. Finally, though they be not meritorious causes of salvation, which
is Gods free gift; an inheritance, and not a purchase made by our selves, yet
they are the means which assure us of it; and though they be not the cause of
our reigning, yet they are the way to the Kingdom. Finally, they are the
undoubted signs, and (as the Apostle calls them) the proof of our love,
whereby we may try whether it be unfeigned or hypocritical; Ioh. 14. 15.
for if we love God, we will keep his Commandments: and also of the truth and
sincerity of our Religion, which is not so well known from that Iam. 1. 27.
which is false by an outward profession, as by the holy practice of it in the
works of piety, justice, mercy and Christian charity.

. Sect. 6 Of the rewards of good works.
Lastly, let us consider, that the Lord will richly of his free grace reward
these works with glory and happiness in his Kingdom. For though the strength
of our title stand upon Gods free gift, yet we are entered into the possession
of it by the works of mercy, as being infallible signs that we are the true
and lawful heirs unto whom this heavenly patrimony does belong, by right of
Covenant: according to that of our Savior, Come ye Mat. 25. 34, 35.
blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world: for I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty,
and ye gave me drink, etc. So the Apostle says, that at the day of Judgment,
Christ will render to every man according to his deeds: To them who by patient
continuance Romans 2. 7, 8.
in well-doing seek for glory honor, and immortality, eternal life, but to
them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey
unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, etc. Whereby it appears, that if
ever we mean to attain unto everlasting happiness, we must not content our
selves with an opinion of our inward piety and sincerity, nor with an outward
profession of Religion, but we must bring forth the fruits of them, both in
the works of holiness and righteousness; For not every one that says, Lord,
Mat. 7. 21, 22. Luke 11. 28. Ioh. 13. 17. Apoc. 1. 3.
Lord, shall enter into Gods Kingdom, but they that do his will. And they
only are pronounced happy, who hear the Word of God and keep it. As for those
who please themselves with the profession of piety, and neglect the practice in
the fruits of obedience, and duties of a godly life, they are presently in
danger to be cut off like hypocrites and dead branches with Gods judgments,
according to that of John the Baptist; Now is the axe laid to the root of the
trees; Mat. 3. 10. Ioh. 15. 2.
Therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit, is hewne down and
cast into the fire: And in the World to come shall be excluded from Gods
presence, and have their portion in everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
and his Mat. 7. 23. and 25. 41.
angels, not only as workers of iniquity, but also as neglecters of the works
of mercy and Christian charity, to the poor members of Jesus Christ.

CAP. IIII.
That we must perform universal obedience to the whole will of God.

. Sect. 1 That only universal obedience to Gods will and Word is accepted of
him.
AND thus have we showed, that our obedience ought to be universal, in
respect of the subject or the person that performs it. In the next place we
are to show, that there is also an universality required in respect of the
object, whereby we understand the whole will of God revealed in the Scriptures.
Neither is it sufficient that we perform some, or many duties, and neglect the
rest; but we must in all things be conformable to all Gods Commandments:
which is not so to be understood, as though we could actually do all that God
requires, for in many things we sin all, but of Iam. 3. 2.
an habitual obedience and disposition of our hearts, whereby we desire,
resolve, and endeavor in all things to do Gods will, in as great perfection as
we can, bewailing our wants and imperfections, when we fail and come short of
our desires. Of which we have an example in David, who Psalm. 119. 6.
had respect unto all Gods Commandments, and in the remnant of the Captivity,
who bound themselves by covenant and oath to walk in Gods Law, Nehem. 10. 29.
and to observe and do all the Commandments of the Lord their God: and in
Zachary and Elizabeth, who were righteous before God, walking in all the Luke
1. 6.
Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameless. The contrary whereof we
see in the example of Iehu, who obeyed God in destroying the house 2. King. 10.
of Ahab, and Baal with his Priests, for the establishing of his own Kingdom,
but not in taking away the golden Calves. In Herod, who Mark. 6. 20.
heard John the Baptist willingly, and obeyed his doctrine in many things, but
would not leave his Incest. In Judas, and Demas, who performed many good
duties, but would not forsake their covetousness and love of the world. And
finally, in Ananias and Saphyra, who were content to share Act. 5.
with God, but kept part of the possession which they had wholly consecrated
unto him, for their own use. But our obedience must be universal, keeping no
sin as sweet under our tongue; but we must in the disposition, Job 20. 12.
desire and purpose of our hearts, renounce all sins whatsoever without
exception, be they never so pleasing or profitable; yea, we must with greatest
hatred pursue those, unto which our corrupt natures are most inclined, making
war, as against all these wicked enemies of God, so most earnestly against
this Canaanitish brood which dwell in our Land. And contrariwise, we must love
and embrace all virtues, and practice all Christian duties which God has
commanded, though they be never so hard and difficult to our corrupt
disposition; yea the more auerse our sinful natures are unto them, so much the
more earnestly we must labor to embrace and practice them. For if we make any
composition with Satan and our own flesh, to give willing entertainment unto
any sin, or to neglect any virtue or Christian duty, our obedience is but
hypocritical and fained; and the sin reserved, like a little leaven, will
sour the whole lump, or a little Coloquintida, will imbitter and poison all
our seeming virtues and obedience. They will on all occasions open the door of
our hearts, and let in all manner of wickedness, as pledges and hostages given
to Satan, to warrant his re-entry when he pleases.

. Sect. 2 That we must perform obedience to both Tables jointly, and to the
Gospel, as well as the Law.
Which dangers if we would avoid, we must resolve to yield obedience to all
and every part of Gods will revealed, either in the Law, or Luke 1. 74.
the Gospel. In respect of the Law, we must observe both Tables, and perform
all duties of piety, righteousness and sobriety which God has commanded in
them. And if we would approve our selves to be in the number of those who are
the Lords redeemed, we must resolve to worship him both in holiness and
righteousness. If we would be reckoned among those good scholars unto whom
the grace of God has appeared, that brings salvation, we must approve our
selves to be so, by learning that whole lesson which he teaches, which is, to
deny ungodliness and worldly Tit. 2. 12.
lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world: And
if we would be accepted of God, we must not only religiously fear him, but
Act. 10. 35.
also work righteousness, as the Apostle Peter speaks. For if we seem to
make conscience of the first Table, and neglect the second, our obedience will
make us no better then glorious Hypocrites: or if we will observe the duties
of the second, and not regard the first, we shall be no better then civil
worldlings, and honest Infidels. Again, we must observe this universal
obedience, as in respect of the parts of the Law, and duties of both Tables, so
also of the degrees, desiring to keep, with all care and good conscience, the
small Commandments as well as the greater, not thinking any duty so small,
that we may wittingly and willingly neglect it, nor any sin so slight and
venial, that we may commit it. For small neglects will make way for greater;
and lesser sins being wilfully entertained, will open the door of our hearts
to let in greater. It is true that there ought to be a proportion observed, and
as duties are of greatest excellency and necessity, so they must have priority
and precedence; and as sins are more heinous and grievous, so they must be
resisted and forsaken with greatest zeal and endeavor. But yet true and
sincere obedience dispenceth with no degree of sin, or the neglect of the
least duties in their due place and time: and though it respects chiefly the
weighty things of the Law, yet it does not voluntarily omit the least duties.
Though it chiefly abhors whoredom, sacrilege and perjury, yet it yields
not to wanton dalliance, petty thefts, and idle oaths. And thus also if our
obedience be sound and sincere, then have we also respect to the Commandments
of the Gospel, as well as the Law; and in them make like conscience of the
one, as well as of the other; desiring and indeuoring with no less care to
repent unfeignedly of our sins, then to believe in Christ, and apply the
promises of grace and salvation; and no less striving to be freed from sin
in respect of the corruption, by virtue of Christ's death, and to rise again
unto newness of life, by the power of his Resurrection, then to be delivered
from the gilt and punishment of it, and to rise at the latter Day unto glory
and happiness. For if we divide these, we shall do neither aright. If we
believe only, and do not repent, we are but carnal Gospellers, and
presumptuous worldlings: and if our sorrow for sin be never so great, yet if
we have not faith in Christ, this grief is to be grieved for, seeing it is the
forerunner of despair, and 2. Cor. 7. 10.
a worldly sorrow which brings death. So that though we should bewail our
sins never so much, and even melt, and be wholly resolved into tears, yet
should we perish in our infidelity; seeing it is not our tears, but the
precious blood of Christ applied by faith, which purges and purifieth our
souls and bodies from the guilt and punishment of our sins.

. Sect. 3 Reasons persuading to universal obedience. 1. Because God requires
it.
The reasons which may move us to yield this universal obedience to the whole
revealed will of God, are diverse; first, because God commands Deuteronomy. 11. 32.
it. Neither does he require that we should keep his Law in some things, and
break it in others, or in most things, and neglect it in some few, seeing no
Prince will accept from his subject such obedience; but all and every of his
Commandments without exception. He binds us strictly to observe all his
Statutes and Judgments which he sets before us; that whatsoever he
commands us, we observe to do it; neither adding thereto, and 12 32. and 32.
46. and 28. 14.
nor diminishing from it; that we set our hearts to obey all the Words of his
Law, turning not therefrom to the right hand, nor to the left. So our Savior
Christ inioyneth his Disciples to preach unto all nations, teaching them to
observe all Math. 28. 20.
things whatsoever he commanded. The which the Apostle observed in his own
practice; keeping in all things a good conscience before God, and living Heb.
13. 18.
honestly before men. And unto this total obedience to all Gods Law, does he
restrain all his promises; If (says he) thou will hearken diligently unto
Deuteronomy. 28. 1.
the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his Commandments;
then I will advance thee, and all my blessings shall come upon thee, etc.
Whereas that which is but in part, can expect no reward, but rather deserved
punishment. For as it is in this case between the Prince and his subject, so
also between God and us. Though a man observe the whole Law of his Sovereign,
and commits only one heinous and capital crime, his obedience is not
rewarded, seeing therein he does but his duty, but for his offense he is
justly punished.

. Sect. 4 That our obedience cannot be sincere, unless it be universal.
Secondly, if our obedience be not universal to the whole will of God, it
cannot be sincere and upright; for if in the integrity of our hearts we
yielded obedience to any of Gods Commandments, out of our love toward him,
and because he requires our obedience unto them, then would we upon the same
ground and reason obey all the rest, seeing he is the Author of all alike,
and by the same divine authority binds us to one as well as to another. And
upon this reason the Apostle James doubts not to affirm, that he who
breaks any one Commandment, is guilty of Iam. 2. 10, 11.
all, though he keeps all the rest; for he that said, Do not commit
adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou
kill, thou art become a transgressour of the Law. For there is a chain of
virtues and vices, whereby they are so fast and inseparably linked together,
that he who imbraceth and practices any one virtue and Christian duty out of
his love and obedience to God, imbraceth and performs all the rest; he that
willingly lives in the neglect of any one duty, or makes no conscience of
committing any known sin, neglects all, and is prepared to commit any
wickedness. In which regard it may truly be said, that the unregenerate man
breaks all Gods Commandments, even those which he seems to keep, and
that the sound Christian observes all, even those which he seems to break.
For howsoever the one does not actually transgress every Commandment, yet
there is in him an habit of sin, and a natural disposition and readiness to
break all when opportunity serves, and when he is tempted thereunto with the
alluring baits of worldly vanities. And though the other do not actually keep
the whole Law, but fails in many particulars, yet there is in him an habit of
holiness and righteousness, and a disposition and desire, resolution and
endeavor to observe all; for with the Apostle they consent unto the whole Romans
7.
Law, that it is holy and good, and being in their hearts delighted in it; they
strive to keep one Commandment as well as another, and when they fail of
their purpose, do heartily bewail their imperfections. It is true, that a
wicked man may not only forsake many sins, but may also in some sort loath
and detest them; but this is not out of his love toward God, or because he
hates or forbids them, but caused by some common restraining grace, or done
out of some corrupt passion and disposition, not because he hates sin, but
because some contrary vice being predominant in him, does draw him unto another
extreme. And thus the covetous man hates prodigality, and the prodigal,
covetousness: the presumptuous man melancholic despair, and the despairing
sinner, bold presumption; the coward, bloody quarrel, and the desperate
backster, Plerique metu peccare cessant, non innocentia, profecto tales timidi,
non innocents dicendi sunt. Seneca
cowardice. Yea, thus may a man outwardly shun all sins which make him liable
to legal penalties out of self-love, that he may gain rewards, or escape
punishments; not out of love to virtue and innocence, but fear of running into
danger.

. Sect. 5 That without total obedience we cannot attain to heavenly
happiness.
Finally, unless we perform total obedience in the desire, purpose and
endeavor of our heart unto the whole Law of God, we can neither attain unto
heavenly happiness, nor escape hellish death and condemnation, though we
embrace and practice many virtues and duties, and flee from many vices and
sins. For as a Millstone will keep us from mounting aloft, as well as a
Mountain, and the one as well as the other would cause us to sink into the
bottom of the Sea, if it were fastened unto us; so if any one sin have taken
such fast hold of our hearts, that we will by no means be moved to leave it,
the weight thereof will be sufficient to keep us from ascending unto heavenly
happiness, and to drench and drown us in the sea of perdition. So the Apostle
says, that he that lives (not in all or many sins, but) in any one, shall
never enter into the Kingdom of heaven; Neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
nor adulterers, nor effeminate, etc. shall inherit the Kingdom of God. And the
Apostle John says, that 1. Cor. 6. 9, 10. Apoc. 22. 15.
every sort of sinners, as sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and
idolaters, and liars, shall be excluded from this place of blessedness. So
that as for the loss of corporal life, it is not necessary that the body
should be wounded in every place, but a mortal wound in any of the vital
parts, is sufficient to let in death, and give it seizure of the whole man: so
is it in this case. And as particular sins deprive us of happiness, so they
plunge us into death and destruction, as appears by that distinct enumeration
which the Prophet makes of particulars; If (says he) he Ezekiel. 18. 10, 13.
beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and does the like to any
of these things, and that neglects any of the duties there mentioned, he
shall not live, but surely dye. And the Apostle John says, that sinners of
every kind, shall Apoc. 21. 8.
have their portion in the Lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is
the second death. Now if any will say, that if for any one duty wilfully
neglected, or sin committed, they shall lose the joys of heaven, and be cast
into hell torments, then it were as good to be outragiously wicked, and to
live in all manner of sin; let one of the Ancients make answer to such an
objection. This (says he) is the speech of an ungrateful and reprobate
Ingrati serui est his sermo, etc. Chrysostom in Ephesians. cap. 2. sermon. 4.
servant: yet let not such an one let the reins loose to all impiety for his
own profit. For though all impenitent sinners are excluded out of heaven, and
thrown into hell, yet all in hell do not suffer equal torments, but some
greater, and some less, according to the quality and number of their sins.

CAP. V.
Of the properties of Christian and holy duties, which respect their causes
efficient and final.

. Sect. 1 That all duties should spring from the love of God.
AND these are the properties which respect the duties themselves. The
properties which concern the manner of doing them, are diverse, and respect
either the causes that move us to perform them, or our disposition in doing
them. The causes are either efficient, or final. The efficient cause moving us
to perform all the duties of a godly life, ought to be the love of God, which
is the fountain of true obedience, and should be so powerful in us, that we
should thereby be moved to serve, like children, our heavenly Father, though
there were no reward promised to our service, which is the motive that induces
mercenaries and servants, rather then children, to do their duty. For
howsoever we may in our obedience have an eye with Moses, to the recompense of
reward; yet the chief argument Heb. 11. 25.
that prevails with us, ought to be, not the love of our selves, and out of
it, the desire of our own salvation; but the love of God, who is the chief
Goodness, whose glory is much to be preferred before our own good. Neither
is it enough that the love of God accompany our actions, and that they be done
in and with it, as running together (as it were) in the same stream, but also
that it be the fountain from which all our obedience does spring and flow.
Consider we therefore when we undertake the performance of any Christian duty,
what is the cause that moves us unto it; and if we find, that it is love of
the world, or love of our selves, either to obtain a reward, or to avoid
punishment, temporal or eternal, let us put it back as coming out of due
place, and labor that the love of God, which is much more worthy, may have the
precedence, as the first and chief motive that persuades us to well-doing.

. Sect. 2 That we must propound Gods will, and our obedience thereunto in all
duties.
Secondly, we must propound unto our selves, in all the duties of a godly life,
the will of God, and his glory, in yielding obedience unto it, as the maine
scope and end of all our actions; desiring chiefly and in the first place (as
our Savior has taught us to pray) that we may hallow and glorify Gods Name,
by doing his will. And if we will perform unto God acceptable service, we
must therein deny our selves and our own wills, and yield our selves in
absolute obedience to the will of God; praying, because he will have us pray,
hearing and reading his Word, because it is his will that we should do so,
giving alms, and doing works of mercy, that we may please him by doing his
will; yea seeking the salvation of our own souls, not chiefly because we
desire it for our own good; but because his will is to glorify himself in
our salvation and happiness. Ioh. 6. 39, 40.
For Gods will is the cause of causes; and as all things came from it, so must
all things tend unto it as their maine scope and end. It is that which gave
first being to our wills, and preserves them in it; and therefore they must
not be absolute in themselves, but in all things yield to the will of their
Creator, willing whatsoever they will, because God first wills it. It is the
rule of righteousness and all perfection, and all things are just and unjust,
perfect or imperfect, straight or crooked, as they agree or differ from it; and
therefore there is no goodness in our wills, no not in the choosing and
embracing of the best actions and duties that can be named, but only so far
forth as we conform them to the will of God, and do all we do in obedience
unto it. And if first and chiefly we perform unto God any service, because our
will and desire leads us unto it, and not principally in this respect,
because God wills it, and would have us also to will and do it, it does
hereby lose all grace and beauty, and so also all reward at Gods hand, seeing
we serve not him, but our selves, when we aim not chiefly at the doing of his
will, that we may please and glorify him, but of our own. Neither are our
actions chiefly to be esteemed good or evil according to the matter, but
according to the maine scope and end of them which gives them their
denomination; nor is any act, seem it never so glorious, to be esteemed Gods
service, which is not done in obedience unto him, nor any obedience which has
not conformity with his will. In which regard it may be truly said, that the
basest works of the most servile calling, done by a faithful Christian, in
simple obedience to the will of God to glorify him, are more pleasing unto
him, and esteemed for better service then the prayer and fasting, hearing the
Word, and giving alms of Pharisaical hypocrites, which are done either for the
praise of men, or as works satisfactory to Gods justice, and to merit by them
their own salvation. Finally, if we perform all good duties not as our own
will, but as the will of God, and labor in all things that his will may
chiefly sway and rule in ours, we shall hereby add much excellency unto all
our good actions. For seeing the action receives worth and dignity from the
agent, in which regard the same thing done by a mighty Prince, is esteemed
highly, which in an ordinary and mean person is little regarded; therefore
must needs all good duties be much more excellent, when the will of God is the
chief motive that sets us on work, and not our own will, seeing they
proceed from a much more excellent cause.

. Sect. 3 That all true service is done in obedience to Gods will.
We must therefore, in all Christian duties, propound this unto our selves, as
our principal and maine scope, that the will of God, and Ioh. 5. 30. and 6. 38.
not our own, may be done in them; according to the example of our Savior
Christ, who did not his own will, but the will of him that sent him. We must
labor after Regeneration, not as the act of our own will, but of Gods. For we
are borne again, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor Ioh. 1. 13.
of the will of man, but of God. We must labor to be sanctified, because this
is the will of God, even our sanctification; that we may live no longer the
rest of 1. These. 4. 3. 1. Pet. 4. 2.
our time in the flesh, to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. We must
pray, and in all things give thanks, because this is the will of God in Jesus
Christ. Yea, 1. These. 5. 18.
whatsoever we do, we must do it, not as our own will, but as the will of
God. The which is not only to be observed in the high and excellent duties of
Gods immediate service, but even in the basest and most servile actions, even
in the duties of the poorest and meanest servants, who must, in performing
service to their Masters, propound unto themselves as their main scope, not
their own profit, nor the doing of their own or their Masters will, but the
will of God which requires it at their hands. For so the Apostle exhorts
servants to be obedient unto their Masters, and to Ephesians. 6. 6.
serve them with fear and singleness of heart, as unto Christ; not with
eye-seruice, as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of
God from the heart. And as in our doings, so likewise in our sufferings, we
must with the Apostle, and our Savior Christ himself, chiefly aim at this,
that the Act. 21. 14. Mat. 26. 39, 42.
will of the Lord may be done in them. For those only that suffer according to
Gods will, receive the promise; and such alone can with confidence commit Heb.
10. 36.
the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful
Creator, 1. Pet. 4. 19.
as the Apostle Peter speaks. Now that we may be moved thus to seek, that
Gods will may be done in all our actions, let us consider, that there is no
true obedience which has not this as the maine scope of it; that if we thus
do, we shall be accepted of God, and with David be approved, as men
according to Gods own heart. That we shall hereby be advanced to Act. 13. 22.
Ioh. 7. 17. Mat. 12. 50.
great honor, and be made of Gods own Privy Council, by the illumination of
his Spirit; yea, next a kin to our Savior Christ. That God will hear all
our prayers; for the blind man could see this, that if any Ioh. 9. 31.
man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he hears. And if in our
Petitions we desire that Gods will may be done in ours, we are sure to have 1.
Ioh. 5. 14.
them granted, as the Apostle John tells us. Finally, that those only shall
attain unto everlasting life, who endeavor in all things to do Gods will, for
he that does the will of God, abides for ever, as the Apostle speaks; 1.
Ioh. 2. 17.
and not he that says, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,
Mat. 7. 21.
but he that does the will of our Father which is in heaven, as our Savior
teaches us.

CAP. VI.
Of those properties which respect our hearts and affections.

. Sect. 1 That we must perform all duties of a godly life with cheerfulness.
ANd these are the properties which respect the causes of all Christian duties.
Those which concern our disposition in doing them, do either more principally
respect the heart and affection, or the carriage generally of the whole man. In
respect of the heart, this is the property of all the duties of a godly life,
that they be done heartily; according to that of the Apostle, Whatsoever ye
do, do it heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men. But of this in the
general I have before spoken; and therefore will here insist upon two
special branches of it; the first is alacrity and cheerfulness, the second
is fervent zeal in all good duties. Concerning the former, we ought to
perform all the duties of a godly life with alacrity and cheerfulness, as
being an inseparable property of them, if they be sincere and upright. And this
the Lord requires generally in all Christian duties, that we be ready unto
every good work; and more specially in the duties Tit. 3. 1.
of his service and all the parts thereof. For we must not only seek and
serve the Lord, but also make him our chief delight. We must serve Psalm. 37.
4. Psalm. 100. 1. and 95. 1, 2.
the Lord with gladness, and come before him with thanksgiving. We must come
before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with
Psalms, as the Psalmist exhorts. And we must serve God with a 1. Chro. 28.
9.
perfect and a willing mind, as he persuades Solomon his son. Neither must
we go to the place of Gods service lumpishly and heavily, but be glad and
rejoice, when we mutually exhort one another to go up to the Psalm. 122.
House of the Lord. For as in the time of the Law, God could not endure a dead
oblation, but would have a living sacrifice, or the life of it, and especially
the inwards and heart offered unto him; so can he not abide, that we should
tender unto him a dull, dead, and heartlesse service, without any spirit, life,
and cheerfulness, which is no more pleasing then a dead carrion in his sight.
More especially, we must not only serve God on his Sabbaths, but we must
account them our delight. In our prayers, we must Esa. 58. 13, 14.
with the Apostle make our requests with joy. We must in our thanksgiving
Phil. 1. 4.
rejoice before God, according to that of the Psalmist; O come, let us sing
Psalm. 95. 1. and 33. 1, 2.
unto the Lord, let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation. And
again; Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous, praise him with harp, etc. Our
preaching must be, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but
of 1. Pet. 5. 2.
a ready mind. Our oblations toward the building of the Tabernacle, and Exodus
35. 5, 29.
furthering the means of Gods service, must, like the Israelites, be offered
with a willing heart. And this alacrity and cheerfulness must be used in all
other Christian duties, if we would have them acceptable unto God. Our Alms
must be given with cheerfulness, and not as wrested from us 2. Cor. 9. 7.
by importunity, because the Lord loves a cheerful giver. Our benefits must
be bestowed not grudgingly and slowly, but readily and with alacrity; Philem.
v. 14.
for it is a double benefit when the heart goes with the gift; and (as the
Heathen man said) He gives twice, that gives speedily and readily. Seneca.
Finally, seeing, if we be servants, and do our duty aright, we Ephesians. 6. 6.
serve God and do his will, therefore also we must do it cheerfully and from
our hearts.

. Sect. 2 Reasons which may move us to this cheerfulness.
Now that we may thus serve God with alacrity and cheerfulness, let these
reasons persuade us. First, because it is most acceptable unto God, and in much
more high price with him, then the work and duty it self, be it never so
excellent in outward appearance. For if even mortal men, who need the duties
and service of others, are much more delighted with the kindness and love of
the giver, then with the gift it self: And if Parents and Masters are better
pleased with the willing cheerfulness of their children and servants, then
with their duties which they perform, being done with grudging and repining:
then much more is the Lord delighted with our alacrity and readiness in the
duties of his service, rather then with the outward works and actions, seeing
we can in nothing be profitable unto him; yea, as we have showed before, he
esteems no bodily service which is not en-liued with this soul of
cheerfulness; whereas contrariwise though our duties of his service be full
of manifold imperfections and corruptions, yet if they be performed with ready
and cheerful hearts, he does accept of them for perfect obedience. For he
accepts in the service of his children the will for the deed, and if there be
2. Cor. 8. 12.
a willing mind, a man is accepted, according to that he has, and that power
of performance which God has given, and not according to that he has not, as
the Apostle speaks. Secondly, this cheerfulness and alacrity makes our
otherwise imperfect service, like unto that which is performed by the blessed
Angels, who are always ready, as soon as they hear Gods Psalm. 103. 20, 21.
voice, to do his pleasure, as the Psalmist speaks; they stand about his
Throne continually, and no sooner receive his Commandments, but hasten to
execute them with winged speed. Thirdly, because cheerfulness and delight in
Gods service, as it is most highly esteemed, so is it above all other most
richly rewarded, for if we delight in the Lord, he will give us the desires
of our hearts; if we delight in him, and call his Sabbaths, which Psalm. 37. 4.
are consecrated unto his service, our delight also, he will greatly honor
Esa. 58. 13, 14.
and advance us, and enrich us greatly with all his blessings, as he has
promised. So the Apostle says, that in respect of the bare act of his
preaching the Gospel, he had nothing to glory of, because a necessity of
performing this duty was laid upon him, and a woe denounced if he performed it
not; but if he did not by constraint, but willingly; then he should 1. Cor. 9.
16, 17.
have at Gods hands a reward. Finally, let us serve God with this
cheerfulness, because thereby we shall get unto our selves an infallible
mark and sign that we are in the estate of blessedness. For the Psalmist
describing a blessed man, brings in this as one of his special properties,
that his Psalm. 1. 2.
delight is in the Law of the Lord; so that he meditateth in it day and night.
And therefore let us not content our selves with cold, careless, and formal
service, but perform it unto God with cheerfulness and delight, without
which, it is neither pleasing unto him, nor profitable unto us And seeing this
is not a flower which grows in natures soil, but a gift of God, who works
in us, both to will and to do of his good pleasure; whereof it is that David
acknowledges the free will offerings of himself and his Phil. 2. 13.
people, toward the building of the Temple, to have wholly proceeded 1. Chro.
29. 14.
from God, who had given them both these gifts, and also willing hearts to
return them; therefore let us beg it daily at Gods hands, that taking away
our dullness and drowzinesse, our auersenesse and backwardness unto holy
duties, he will give us grace to serve him in all things with alacrity and
cheerfulness, joy and delight.

. Sect. 3 That we must serve God in all holy duties zealously and devoutly.
The second property respecting the heart, is true zeal, which as we here
consider it, is a devout consecrating of our selves wholly both in soul and
body to the service of God, and an ardent desire, study, and endeavor to
glorify him, by walking before him in the duties of a godly life. So that it
is nothing but the intension of our love and cheerfulness unto these holy
exercise, and of our anger, and mislike against all the impediments whereby we
are opposed and hindered in them. And this is commended unto us in the
Scriptures as an excellent grace, the beauty and brightness whereof, no where
shines more clearly, then in this subject. For if it be good (as the Apostle
says) to be zealous in a good matter, Gal. 4. 15.
where can this zeal more exceed in goodness, then when it is employed and
spent in the duties of Gods service and of a Christian life, then the which,
nothing can be better? It is the vital heat, and, as it were, the very
spirits, which intends all other graces, and with the warmth of it,
increases their virtue and vigor, giving unto them motion, and making them
active and operative in their several functions. And it is given us of God, as
a singular Antidote against that cold and killing poison of carnal formality,
and that stupid blockishnesse, and senseless dullness and deadness, which
naturally has ouerspred all the powers of our body and mind in performing the
duties of Gods service. And if it be wanting, we will soon grow cold and
careless, either neglecting them altogether, or performing them with a
lukewarm indifference for form and fashion sake, not greatly regarding
whether we do or leave them undone; which will make them loathsome in Gods
sight. But if our hearts be inflamed with this zeal, then will we fervently
affect all holy duties of Gods service, as being notable means of advancing
his glory; and not suffer our selves to be withdrawn from them by worldly
vanities, which we neglect and contemn, in comparison of the other. And then
will we also with an holy anger oppose and overcome all impediments and
hindrances which stop us in our Christian course, and especially make war
against our own corruptions, which dull our devotion, and make us slack and
backward to holy duties; which that we may do, let us consider that this zeal
is the end of our Redemption, and an undoubted sign, that Christ has
purchased us unto himself with the price of his own blood. For therefore gave
Tit. 2. 14.
he himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify
unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. So that if we do not
show our zeal in all virtuous actions and Christian duties, we do not attain
to this end, and consequently, plainly declare that we are not redeemed by
Christ, who being God equal with his Father, and infinite in wisdom and
power, cannot fail of those ends which he propounds unto himself. Let us
consider also, that this zeal is an inseparable fruit of true repentance, 2.
Cor. 7. 11.
as the Apostle plainly shows. Whereof it is that Christ in his Epistle to
the lukewarm Laodiceans joins them together, Be zealous Apoc. 3. 19.
and repent, because they could no otherwise approve themselves true conuerts,
till leaving that state of tepedity and luke-warmenesse, they were inflamed
with fervent zeal of Gods glory. For when we soundly and seriously repent us
of our sins, and especially our sloth and sluggishnesse, coldness and
carelesnes in holy duties, then bewailing and hating our former courses, we set
our selves with all earnestness to reform these corruptions, and become
zealously devout in all holy duties, that we may redeem our former lost time,
which we have fruitlesly misspent in their neglect; whereby it appears that our
repentance cannot be unfeigned, unless this zeal be joined with it, nor any
duty of a godly life sincere, which is not approved by this property.

CAP. VII.
Of the properties which respect the whole man: And first, diligence in all
duties of Gods service.

. Sect. 1 That this diligence must be used in all good duties, and about the
means of them.
THe properties which respect the whole man, are two; diligence and constancy.
By diligence, I understand that sedulity and assiduitie, industry and labor,
which we are content to use and take for the compassing and obtaining,
effecting and atchieuing of those things whereupon we have set our hearts and
affections. The which property does always accompany the duties of a godly
life, if we rightly perform them as God requires of us; and is an inseparable
fruit of those which went before. For when we perform them with alacrity and
cheerfulness, and do esteem them our chief delight, then are we not only
in our hearts zealously affected toward them, but so industrious and diligent
in pursuing of them, that we think no pains or labor too much, that we may
bring them to good effect. And then shaking off all natural sloth and
sluggishnesse, all idleness and unprofitableness, we will set our selves
close to our Christian task, and perform those religious duties, and that
holy and spiritual service which our heavenly Lord and Master requires of us.
The which diligence we will show, not in doing some or many duties, neglecting
the rest, using our industry and labor about one, as a veil to cover our
sloth in omitting another, but in the general performance of all and every of
those Christian duties which God in his Word imposes upon us; and like the
good Widow described by the Apostle, we will diligently follow every good
work; yea, we must approve our diligence, not only 1. Tim. 5. 10.
in performing those good duties which offer themselves unto us, but in seeking
all good occasions and opportunities of this Christian employment, that we may
not stand idle, and be unprofitable for want of work, which indeed is never
wanting, if we want not eyes to see it, and hearts to undertake it in due time.
Neither must our diligence and laborious endeavors be only spent in the
duties themselves, but also about the means whereby we may be enabled to
perform them. For in vain he pretends diligence in attaining to the end,
who neglects the means which conduce unto it, seeing the means and end do
inseparably go together. And therefore as no man can be truly said to be
diligent in his journey to a City, who goes not in the way that leads unto
it, or in attaining to riches, who neglects the means whereby they are
gotten, or in preserving of his life, who does not use the helps of Physic
or diet, whereby it may be preserved: so neither can any be diligent in the
maine duties of a godly life, who shows not the like industry and labor in
the use of all good helps and means, which by Gods Ordinance and appointment
enable us unto them. Neither must we content our selves with the use of some
means, and neglect others, but we must show and approve our diligence, in
using of all good helps, which God has given us, to further us in our
Christian course. And as for the preserving of our natural life and strength,
we do not eat alone, or sleep alone, or only keep our selves warm, or use
good exercise, and take profitable Physic, but use all these means jointly
in their fit season; so seeing the Lord has appointed unto us variety of good
means, for the preserving of our spiritual life and growth in grace, as
praying, hearing, receiving the Sacrament, reading, conferring; we must not
think it enough, to pray, or hear, or read, or to single out unto our selves
any other means unto which we have best appetite, but we must approve our
diligence in the joint using of them all in their due time. For as in nature
God has not ordained one thing as sufficient for all purposes, but meat to
feed us, and not to keep us warm; clothes to cover us and hide our
nakedness, and not to nourish us; sleep and exercise to refresh us, and the
like: so also for the preserving of our spiritual life, it is not enough, that
we use one of those means whereof God has given us great variety, seeing he
has not made any one of them sufficient for all uses, but will have them
severally used for their several ends, and all jointly together, that we may
be made perfect to every good work. Yea, this diligence must show it self,
not only in the use of all the best and chief means, but also in wise
observing of all circumstances, as time, place, person, and such like, which
may further us in the well performing all Christian duties. Neither must we
employ our diligence and labor in such means as are of our own choosing, and
best fit our appetite, but in those which God has appointed and sanctified for
the better inabling us unto his service. For as it is not enough to be
painful in traveling, unless we choose the right way which will bring us to
our iourneys end, nor for the nourishing of our bodies, and preserving of our
natural strength, that we may be fit for all civil employments, to eat any
thing that comes to hand, but only such meats as God has created for this
use, and has made them effectual unto it, by his holy Ordinance and blessing
upon it: so we must not choose ways of our own, if we will travel to our
heavenly home, but the right and straight way, which God in his Word has
prescribed unto us; we must not, for the nourishment of our souls, that they
may be vigorous and strong unto the duties of a godly life, choose food that
fitteth our carnal appetite, as Images, Crucifixes, Pilgrimages, superstitious
Penance, which torment the body, but do not at all humble the proud flesh: for
these being not ordained of God, nor sanctified to this use, but invented and
appointed by the skill and will of man, have no more power or virtue to nourish
the soul, or to strengthen it to virtuous actions, then earth or chips have to
nourish the body. Neither must we spend our diligence in good means
unseasonably, out of their due time and place, as those which are inferior and
less powerful, when we may employ our selves in those which are superior, and
through Gods Ordinance more effectual. As in private exercises at home, when we
should join with the Congregation in Gods public service; reading a Sermon in
our own houses, when we should hear the Word preached in the House of God;
for though it be a good exercise at another time, and though the Sermon which
we read, may be as good or better then that which we should hear, yet
cannot it be so effectual unto us, for the begetting and increasing of our
faith, and other saving graces (no more then Abana and 2. King. 5. 12.
Pharpar for the clensing of Naamans Leprosy, though as good waters as Jordan)
because God has not ordained and sanctified reading to be so ordinary and
effectual a means for the begetting of his graces in us, as Romans 10. 17.
the Word preached, and the means themselves have no other virtue and vigor
in them, but as they are his ordinances which are made effectual by his
blessing. Finally, as we must use all diligence in all good means which may
strengthen us to Gods service, so also in shunning or removing all lets and
impediments, whereby we may be hindered in holy duties, and the means become
ineffectual or less powerful to those good ends for which we use them. For
as he who would be rich, is not only diligent in all good means which may
improve his state, but also in shunning the contrary; as prodigality, excess
in diet and apparel, and the company of wastfull and riotous persons; and as
he who desires to preserve his health, is not careful alone to eat wholesome
meat, but shunneth also the means with like care, which would hinder good
concoction: so must we take the like course, if we would thrive in our
spiritual estate, and have our souls healthy and strong in saving grace, that
they may be fit and able for the well performance of all Christian duties.

. Sect. 2 Diverse reasons which may move us to diligence. First, because God
requires it.
And thus we see what diligence and labor we are to use in leading a godly
life. Let us now consider of the reasons and motives which may Deuteronomy. 6. 17.
Psalm. 119. 4. Ezra 7. 23.
persuade us hereunto. And first, this diligence must be used in the duties of
Gods service, because God requires it at our hands. You shall diligently keep
the Commandments of the Lord your God, and his testimonies and Statutes which
he has commanded thee. Of which Commandment David takes notice; Thou have
(says he) commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. And Ezra, like a good
Governor, backeth it with all his authority: Whatsoever is commanded by the
God of heaven, let it be diligently done, etc. Unto this diligence the Apostle
exhorts, in whatsoever office or duty we undertake, Romans 12. 6, 7, 8.
and contrariwise disswadeth from being slothful in any business, verse. 11.
especially in the service of God, unto which he requires feruency of spirit.
More especially, this diligence is required in all good means, whereby we may
be enriched with all virtue and saving grace. So the Apostle Peter; Giving all
diligence, add to your faith, virtue, and to virtue, knowledge, 2. Pet. 1. 5.
verse. 10.
etc. and in getting thereby assurance of our salvation: Give diligence to make
your calling and Election sure. And above all, in the religious duties of Gods
service, according to that of our Savior; Take you heed, watch Mark. 13. 33.
and pray. And of his holy Apostle: Pray continually; in every thing give 1.
These. 5. 17. 18. 1. Cor. 15. 10.
thanks: and again, Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with
thanksgiving. Of which laborious diligence and unwearied industry, we have
them for examples of their own precepts: For not only in the painful labors
of his Apostolic ministry, this holy Apostle exceeded all the rest, but also
in attaining unto spiritual graces, and in the exercise of a godly life: For
forgetting those which were behind, he reached forth unto Phil. 3. 13. 14.
those things which were before, and pressed toward the mark, for the price
of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ. But above all examples of this
diligence is that of our Savior Christ, whose time was wholly employed in the
duties of Gods service, spending the day in preaching and working miracles, and
the night in praying: yea with such unwearied diligence he performed these
functions of his office, that the weariness of his travel could make him
weary of these works. Yea, he preferred the doing of these duties before the
satisfying of his hunger, and esteemed it as his meat and drink, to do the
works of him that sent him. Now as God requires Ioh. 4. 34.
this diligence and pains in all duties of his service, so does he much
approve it wheresoever he finds it. As in the Angel of the Church of Ephesus,
I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience: And in the Apoc. 2. 2.
servant who had well employed his Masters Talents; Well done, good and Math.
25. 21, 26
faithful servant, etc. So does he much abhor sloth and negligence in his
service, as appears in his sharp reproof of the unprofitable servant, who
had hid his Lords Talent in a napkin; Thou wicked and slothful servant, etc.
branding him with the name of wickedness, because of his slothfulness, and
not because he had riotously misspent his Talent, or spoiled his fellows of
those Talents which were committed unto them, but because through his idleness
and negligence he had been unprofitable to his Master.

Sect. 3 Of the rewards promised to the diligent.
Secondly, the manifold and great benefits, wherewith the Lord, rich in mercy
toward all who diligently serve him, will liberally reward their labors, may
serve as an effectual reason to incite us to this duty. For we cannot serve a
more bountiful Master, nor employ our labors to better advantage, then in
performing unto him our duty with all diligence, seeing he will suffer none of
our pains to be spent in vain, but will proportion our wages according to the
greatness of our work. In this life he bestows upon those who are diligent
in the duties of his service, not only a large measure of his temporal
benefits, and his blessing upon them, whereby they become truly profitable for
their use, according to those many and gracious promises which in his Law he
has made unto Deuteronomy. 28. 1, 2. etc.
them, but also inricheth their souls with the treasures of his spiritual
graces. For we can be no more ready to use the means, then the Lord is to give
his blessing upon them, whereby they become effectual unto those ends for
which we use them. Neither is he ever in this kind wanting to any, who are not
through their negligence wanting unto themselves. In which regard that may be
truly said of our spiritual estate, which is spoken of our temporal: He
becomes poor that deals with a slack hand; Prou. 10. 4.
but the hand of the diligent makes rich. Hereby also we attain unto the
assurance of our Election and effectual calling, which is no otherwise to be
had, then by this diligence in laboring after it, as the Apostle implies in
those words; Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election 2. Pet.
1. 10.
sure; and that we shall persevere in the state of grace unto salvation; for if
we give all diligence in adding one grace and virtue unto another, the same
Apostle assures us, that we shall never fall. And the Apostle in the Epistle
to the Hebrews, remembering the works of piety and mercy which had been
performed by some of the faithful, desires others to show Heb. 6. 11, 11.
the same diligence, to their full assurance of hope unto the end, and that
they would not be slothful, but followers of them who through faith and
patience inherited the promises.

. Sect. 4 That this diligence in all Christian duties is in many respects most
necessary.
Thirdly, the necessity of this diligence in holy duties may move us to
embrace and use it. For if in civil and worldly things no great matter is
achieved without pains and diligence, how much less in spiritual and
heavenly, which are so high above our reach, so excellent above all other
things, and so contrary to our corrupt nature and disposition. And if no man
can reasonably hope to attain unto riches of his own purchase, who gathers
with one hand, and scatters with the other, or plays the good husband at
some times, and at another neglects his business, and wastfully mispendeth
his time and substance; nor unto any great learning, if he be slothful and
negligent in his studies; or to get the glory of famous victories and glorious
triumphs, if he lie idly in the Garrison, and never exercise himself in feats
of arms, nor make any attempt against his enemies; but all these things must
be purchased and achieved by labor and diligence: then how shall we think
ever to enrich our souls with the invaluable treasures of Gods graces, to
attain unto that high and supernatural learning, which teaches unto us the
knowledge of God, and of our selves, our Savior Christ and his will and truth,
or to get the victory over the spiritual enemies of our salvation, which shall
be rewarded with a Crown of glory and triumph, seeing they are so many,
mighty, and malicious; if we do not shake off all sloth, and with all study
and diligence use all good means whereby we may overcome all difficulties,
and compass these things so much to be desired, and so hardly obtained?
Neither must we think it an easy matter to serve the Lord in the duties of a
godly life, and so slight it over as requiring no pains; seeing they are
things of such high excellency, that they are far above our natural reach;
and seeing also we cannot proceed in them, but against the violent streams of
mighty opposition. For the spiritual enemies of our salvation are always
ready to stop and hinder us in our course of Christianity, and we wrestle not
against flesh and blood, but against Ephesians. 6. 9.
principalities and powers, and spiritual wickednesses in high places; who
using all diligence to work our destruction, by spoiling us of all Gods
graces, and hindering us from doing any Christian duty, it behooves us with no
less diligence to prevent their malice. Our arch-enemy, Satan, never rests,
but like a roaring Lion, rangeth still about, seeking to devour us: and how 1.
Pet. 5. 8.
then does it beseem us to stand continually upon our guard, and as the Apostle
Peter exhorts us, to watch, and to be sober? The world is ever forward to
allure us unto wickedness, by evil persuasions, and bad examples, or to thrust
us into it by threats and violent courses; and what diligence then becomes us
to use in escaping these snares, and preserving our selves from falling in
these tentations? But especially our selves are greatest and most dangerous
enemies unto our selves, nourishing in our own bosom such natural corruption,
as makes us most auerse unto all good duties, and headlongly prone unto all
sins; what diligence therefore should we use in subduing the strength, and
defeating the wiles of this secret traitor, that lies still lurking in us,
seeking all advantages to hinder us in all Christian exercises, and to betray
our souls as captives unto Satan, by drawing them into sin? Through this
corruption of nature we are backward unto all good duties, and in our course
of Christianity, do (as it were) row against the stream. No longer can we
go forward, then we ply the oar with all diligence and endeavor, and no sooner
give our selves to ease, and remit our labor, but we are carried back again
with the wind and tide of our carnal corruptions. We wrestle with a cruel
monster, our own sinful flesh, against which we prevail no longer then we
squeeze and crush it with our spiritual gripes; for no sooner do we surcease
this holy violence against this corruption of our nature, but it recouereth (as
it were) a new life, and with increased strength, again sets upon us,
putting us to a second labor and danger for the obtaining of the victory; as
we see in the example of David, who even after that he had well profited in
the practice of mortification, and gotten the victory over his sinful
corruptions, by his earnest endeavors in this spiritual exercise; intermitting
for a while his wonted diligence, and giving himself to sloth and ease, was
shamefully foiled by his traitorous flesh, and lamentably plunged into diverse
fearful sins. Finally, by reason of our fall, that heavy curse which was
denounced against the earth, seazeth also upon our souls, which are barren in
bearing any good fruits of holiness and righteousness, and naturally bring
forth nothing but the thorns and thistles of sin and wickedness, unless we
spiritually manure them with all painful diligence, and make them more fertile
and fruitful with the sweat of our labors. Neither can we expect any harvest
of holy duties to spring out of such barren soyles, unless we do well husband
them, and use all diligence in tilling and breaking up these fallow grounds, in
sowing them with the good seed of heavenly doctrine, and in weeding out of them
daily some vices and corruptions. Again, this diligence is necessary; for as
if it be remitted, the strength of sin continually increases; so the graces
of Gods Spirit, in respect of the vigor of their operations, do daily decrease
and languish in us. For as to the welfare of our bodies it is necessarily
required, that they be nourished and sustained by the same elements whereof
they were first composed, which being but a while neglected, the spirits
languish, the strength is abated, and the whole body is infeebled and faints;
so also is it no less necessary that we use all diligence in nourishing Gods
spiritual graces in us by the same means, whereby they were begun in us; as
the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, and the rest; for if we do not give them
continually this spiritual refection and refreshing, they will soon abate of
their strength, wax faint and languish. Neither are these graces connaturall
with us, or like plants thriuing and well-liking (even when they are neglected)
in their own soil, but like trees transplanted out of hot countries into
ours, (as suppose the Orange, Lemon tree, or such like) which need much
tending; watring in the Summer, covering, and keeping warm in the Winter, that
what is wanting in nature, may be supplied with art and diligence. They are
like fire burning, not in its own element, or in combustible matter, where it
needs not labor to continue it; but in green wood, which is ready every
hand-while to go out till it be thoroughly kindled, unless we diligently blow
it, and take great pains to make it burn. Whereof it is, that the Apostle
using this metaphor, exhorts Timothy, to stir up and relieve Gods gifts and
(...). 2. Tim. 1. 6.
graces in him, (as it were) by blowing the fire, which otherwise would decay
and languish in him. Finally, the necessity of this diligence hereby
appears, in that without it we can neither escape Gods curse, nor attain
unto blessedness. For he is accursed of God, not only who is diligent in the
service of the devil, but also who is negligent in the duties of his service,
seeming like Meroz, in a cold neutrality, to take neither part; and not Judge.
5. 23.
he alone who contemns or omitteth the works of God, but he also who does
them negligently. In which number are our civil worldlings, Jer. 48. 10.
who contenting themselves with their moral honesty, just dealing and keeping
their word, do either wholly neglect the religious duties of Gods service,
further then the Law compels them, or else perform them after a formal,
cold, and careless manner: nor can we, without this earnest endeavor and
studious diligence, attain unto eternal and heavenly blessedness. For this
rich reward is not given to idle loyterers, but Math. 20. 1.
to painful laborers in Gods Vineyard, nor to those slothful servants who
hide their Masters Talent in a napkin, doing with it neither good nor evil;
Mat. 25. 21, 26.
but unto those who by their spiritual trading have increased it to his
advantage. The Kingdom of God falls not (as it were) by lot to the Math. 11.
12.
lazy, but suffers violence, and is taken by an holy force: and so strait is
and 7. 12, 13.
the gate that leads into it, and the way so narrow, afflicted and
troublesome, that we cannot possess it by sitting at our ease, but must strive
to enter with all diligence and endeavor, as our Savior exhorts.

. Sect. 5 The last reason taken from the unwearied diligence of worldlings, in
pursuing of earthly things.
Lastly, the unwearied diligence of carnal worldlings, in serving of the world
and their own lusts, for the contemptible hire of earthly vanities, may
effectually move us to use the like, or greater, in the service of our Master.
For howsoever they, after their work is done, are not sure of their wages, or
though it be put into their hands, are not sure to hold it; or though they
do, find it vain and of no worth, always unprofitable, and oftentimes
hurtful and pernicious; yet with what diligence do they yield their service?
with what affection do they dote on this golden strumpet? and with what zeal
and devotion do they commit idolatry with this painted Idol? For they are
content to rise early, and go late to bed, to consume their spirits with
carking care, and their bodies with restless labors, both by land and sea, to
spend their strength, and to hazard unto innumerable dangers their health and
life, yea the everlasting salvation of their souls, that they may obtain
riches, pleasures and preferments, and fill their hearts with these windy
vanities, which may puff them up, but never satisfy them: and therefore how
much more does this diligence become us in the service of God, by performing
unto him all Christian duties, seeing our wages as much exceeds theirs, as
heaven earth, everlasting excellencies, momentany vanities; the which also are
certain both in payment and possession? So also the double diligence of
Idolaters in serving their Idols, and the care and cost which is spent in their
service, may make us ashamed to be less industrious and painful in the
service of the true God. For they are ready to break their sleep, and rise
early, with the Israelites, to do them service, and to offer their oblations;
Deuteronomy. 32. 6.
to part with their chiefest ornaments, as their jewels and earerings, their
silver and their gold, for the making and decking of their Images; to lance
and cut themselves, with Baals priests before their Idols; to do voluntary
penance, and to go on pilgrimage to stocks and stones; to consume their
strength with watching, that they may perform their superstitious orizons, and
to torment and whip their bodies before their Cross and Crucifix, to strip
themselves of all their means, to vow voluntary poverty, and with Iezabel, to
spare for no cost in maintaining their idolatrous priests, who draw them on,
and help them forward in their idolatry: And shall we be less diligent in the
service of our good God, from whose blessing and free gift we have all things
which we presently enjoy, or yet do hope for in the life to come? Or shall
we think any pains, or care, or cost too great, in performing those duties
which assure us of salvation, when as they think nothing too much which they
do, or can do, to nourish their doubtful and wavering, their false and
deceiving hopes of their future happiness? Yea, the diligence of desperate
sinners in the service of the devil, by committing of all manner of
wickedness, may make us blush for shame, to neglect Gods service in the duties
of holiness: For they break their brains in plotting of mischiefs, and
spend their strength, and hazard their health and life in effecting them. For
(as the Wise man speaks) They sleep not except they have done mischief;
Prou. 4. 16.
and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall; and
wickedness and violence more cheereth their hearts, then their bread and wine.
They serve the devil oftentimes for nothing, and not seldom, even to worldly
loss, wasting their strength in wanton pleasures, impairing their health with
costly gluttony, and loathed carowses, only in a bravery, and hazarding their
life by needless quarrels, and bloody murders; besides, the inward torments
of mind, heart and conscience, which their unruly passions, vain hopes, and
false fears, frivolous anger, and lustful love, fretting envy, and
reuengefull malice do bring upon them. By all which courses, though they have
no wages for their work; yet (as the Prophet speaks) they are willing even
to weary themselves to commit iniquity. Ier. 9. 5.
And shall they be thus diligent in serving the devil that mortally hates
them, and shall we be negligent in Gods service, who has so dearly loved
us? Shall they think the greatest pains too little in taking these wicked
courses, which do but seal up unto them their certain destruction; and shall
we think any pains too great in performing such holy duties as will assure
us of eternal salvation? Finally, let the devils diligence in dishonouring
God, and seeking to deprive us of grace and glory, that he may plunge us into
everlasting perdition, make us studious and industrious in seeking to glorify
God in our salvation. For as himself witnesses, He compasses the earth
continually to and fro, to spy out all advantages Job 1. 7.
against us, first, drawing us to sin, and then accusing us for it: and as
the Apostle Peter testifies, He walks about as a roaring Lion, seeking 1.
Pet. 5. 8.
whom he may devour. And shall not we use like, or greater diligence in
preserving our selves out of his danger; in keeping our souls and bodies holy
and undefiled, that being unblameable, they may not be damnified by his
accusations; and in employing our time in such holy and Christian duties, as
will enrich our hearts with all saving graces, strengthen us to withstand all
Satan's tentations, confirm our assurance, and further us in the fruition of
heavenly happiness?

CAP. VIII.
Of constancy in the duties of godliness, without remission or intermission.

. Sect. 1 That all those which are sincere, are also constant in the duties of
a godly life.
THe last property of those Christian duties which appertain to a godly life,
is constancy in performing them, of Psalm. 119. 112.
which there are two branches, continuance without remission or intermission,
and perseverance without Apostasy or defection; both which David conioyneth in
his practice of obedience; I have (says he) inclined mine heart to perform
thy Statutes always, even unto the end. Concerning the former, it is not
sufficient to entitle us unto true godliness, that we be religious by fits,
having our good and bad days, or that we spend some time in religious
exercises, and then think that we are set at liberty to live as we list, and
to follow the lusts of our own flesh; that we sometime perform Christian
duties, when our worldly profits or pleasures will give us any leisure, and
neglect, or slightly perform them when we have other employments; or (as it
were) in some religious humor, and pang of devotion, caused by fear of some
approaching judgment, or by smart of some present affliction. For inconstancy,
which is a fruit of folly, will not stand with true godliness, which is the
head and prime part of spiritual wisdom, the which, as it inableth us to
choose that which is best, so also Psalm. 111. 10.
to be constant in our choice: Whereas folly and impiety are full of vanity and
lightness; causing men, according to that sway which they bear in them, to be
unsettled and inconstant in all their ways (if at least, they have any
inclination unto religious duties, and be not wholly settled upon their dregs)
and like Meteors hanging in the air, sometimes moving toward heaven, and
soon after falling back again toward the earth. But no further progress
has any made in piety, then he has profited in the constant practice of
religious duties; and they who are sometimes hot, and sometimes cold, and
sometimes between both, lukewarm; who one while perform service unto God,
and another while neglect it, now devout and seemingly zealous in good things,
and soon after cold and negligent, carnal and profane, have just cause to
suspect themselves, that as yet they have made no sound entrance into the
practice of godliness.

. Sect. 2 The former point illustrated by some comparisons.
For the course of Christianity in the Scriptures, is compared to the Kings
highway, and they who go on in it, to travelers going on in their journey
toward their own Country; and therefore to be sometime seen in this way, is
no sign that in good earnest we travel in it, if we sometimes go forward,
and sometime backward, but rather that we are walking for recreation, and will
give over when we feel any weariness. Even thieves and robbers do sometimes
cross the highway, though their ordinary haunt be in the woods and
mountains, yea will travel in it for a while, that they may be thought true
men, and so get the better advantage, by being unsuspected of executing their
designs; but it is only the honest traveler that goes constantly in his
journey, and trauelleth in it from morning to night. It is compared likewise to
the running of a Race, wherein none get the Garland, but they who run as they
1. Cor. 9. 24.
ought, and as runners do not sometime run, and sometimes stand still, one
while hold the right course, and another while leaving it, spend their time and
travel in by-ways, or in going by fits forward and backward, for so they
should be Non-proficients, ridding no ground, and after much labor lost, be as
far from the Goal and Garland, as they were at the beginning, when they
first set forth: so none get the Garland of glory, who do not run
constantly in the Race of godliness; and they who run by fits and starts,
sometimes going forward, and sometime standing still, or going backward, or
out of the way, become hereby Non-proficients in Christianity, and after that
by much unsettled rambling up and down, they have tired themselves in this
course, they are (like the blind Horse in the Mill) in the same place and case
they were in the beginning; no more mortified to sin, nor richer in saving
graces, no more expert and active in Christian duties, no nearer the Goal, nor
surer of the Garland at the end of their lives, then when they first entered
into the profession of Religion. Yea oftentimes having wearied themselves in
this fruitless labor, and seeing the small benefit that they have reaped of
it, for want of hope, and assurance of ever getting either the Garland of grace
or the Crown of glory, they quite give out, and ceasing any longer to run in
the Christian Race, do return back again (like the Dog to his vomit) and
run as fast as ever they did in their old wicked courses, that so they may not
lose all, but may gain, at least, the prizes of worldly vanities, which Satan
offers unto those who run swiftest in the ways of wickedness. Finally, the
Christian life is our spiritual Husbandry, in which, there cannot be, without
loss, any intermission of our labor, but one business being finished,
another presently is to be undertaken. After breaking up of our fallow
grounds, and plowing, there must be sowing, and harrowing, after seed time
weeding, and then reaping and carrying into the barn. Neither must the spare
time between these maine employments, be spent in idleness, but in tending of
our cattle, which are the helps of husbandry, in making and mending of our
fences, in lopping and topping, plashing and pruning, threshing out of the
Corn, that it may be fit for our own use, or carried out to the Market, with
many other employments of like nature: So is there no intermission of our
pains in the spiritual Husbandry, but after one duty performed, we must set
our selves about another, and spend our whole time either in preparing our
hearts that they may be fit grounds to receive the seed of Gods Word, or about
the art of sowing, or covering the seed, that it may not be stolen away, or in
weeding it from vices and corruptions, when it begins to grow; or in
preserving and strengthening all the good helps and means, which will enable
and further us in all our Christian labors; or in making or repairing our
spiritual fences, which may keep out the beasts of the field, and enemies of
our Christian thrift; or in reaping the present crop of Gods saving graces,
which will comfortably sustain us in the full assurance and expectation of the
everlasting Harvest of heavenly happiness.

. Sect. 3 A complaint of men's un constancy in performing the duties of a godly
life.
And yet alas how many of us, who seem most forward in the profession of
Christianity, that have not in the greatest part of their life, come to any
settled constancy in performing the duties of godliness? How many profess
themselves travelers toward our heavenly Country, and yet are unconstant in
all their ways, and unsettled in all their courses, sometime performing the
duties of a godly life, and sometime neglecting them altogether; serving God
one day, or in some small part of it, and spending the rest of their time in
serving Satan, the world, and their own lusts? How many that make a fair show,
as though they would run the Christian Race, who one while go forward, and
another while, as out of breath, and weary of holy exercises, do stand still,
or turn back again into their old sinful courses, and in stead of seeking
the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, do spend the chief of their
strength in pursuing of worldly vanities? How many of those who would be
thought good husbands for their souls, that are wholly negligent in the
spiritual husbandry, every hand while intermitting their pains and diligence,
sometimes using the means of growing and thriuing in grace, and sometimes
neglecting them, praying only when they are pinched with afflictions, hearing
the Word at their best leisure and most ease; in the Country, when the weather
is warm and the ways fair; in the City, when they cannot walk abroad about
their pleasures or profits, as in time of winter, when the foulness of the
way, and weather and darkness of the night leaves unto them no other
employment; and at no time taking any care after the seed is sown, to cover
it in their hearts by Meditation or conference, that it may not be stolen away,
but take root, and bring forth fruit in due season? So also receiving the
Sacrament only at Easter, or some of the chief festiuals, and neglecting to
come to the Lords Table, though often invited all the rest of the year
besides; and finally, reading the holy Scriptures, and other profitable
writings inconstantly, and by uncertain fits, when they have nothing else to
do, or cannot well tell how to put away otherwise the tediousness of
idleness. Through which inconstancy, after long using the means, they little
profit by them, but like those of whom the Apostle speaks, they are ever
learning, and never able to come unto the knowledge 2* Tim. 3. 7.
of the truth; they are old truants, and though in profession ancient, yet
children in growth. They are like those of whom Seneca speaks, who are
always but beginners even to their ending, and but about to settle themselves
in the course of a godly life, when death approaching will force them to finish
it. Finally, they either like Non-proficients stand at a stay, without any
increasing in knowledge, faith, and other saving graces; or the fruits of them
in a godly life; or else de-ficients, falling back from their profession, and
betaking themselves to the service of Satan, the world, and their own sinful
lusts. Now what do all these but spend their precious time and unsettled
endeavors not only in vain, but even oftentimes unto loss? What do they but
make the practice of their Religion a Penelopes web, one day undoing that which
they have done in another? or like unto Sysiphus his fained labor, rolling up
the stone till it be almost at the hill top, and then suffer it to tumble back
again, and so give them occasion to renew their labor? All which inconstancy,
and evil fruits which spring from it, do proceed from the corruption of our
natures, and the imperfection of our sanctification, the relics of sin
still remaining in us; which make us apt and prone to return to our old
courses, like a Horse to his trot, that is not thoroughly paced, or an Hawke to
turn Haggard that is not well manned.

. Sect. 4 That constancy in all Christian duties is strictly required in Gods
Word.
But let us not please our selves with this state of imperfection, but labor
and strive daily after more perfection; and seeing how unsettled we are even
in the state of regeneration, in all Christian courses, let us, bewayling our
vnstayednesse, endeavor to attain unto more constancy in the embracing and
practicing of all good duties. For God requires at our hands, that we should
serve him, not by fits and flashes, but constantly in all our courses, and not
only that we do well, but that we continue in well-doing. Thus Samuel
charge the people, that they should take heed 1. Sa. 12. 20, 21.
(not of forsaking the Lord, and renouncing his service, but) that they should
not turn aside after vain things which would not profit, nor deliver them
from danger. So the Wiseman requires, that we should continue in the fear of
Pro. 23. 17.
the Lord all the day long; and the Apostle, that we should never be weary of
Gal. 6. 9.
well doing; seeing in due season we shall reap, if we faint not: and
exhorts us to be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of
the Lord, 2. These. 3. 13.
because we are sure that we shall not labor in vain. And this constancy we
1. Cor. 15. 58.
must show both in choosing and holding us to the right way, and also in walking
in it; In professing constantly the truth of Religion, and living accordingly
in our holy practice. For the first, we must be constant in embracing and
professing of Gods Truth, and not by fits only, when it will best stand with
our worldly advantage. So the Apostle exhorts; Watch ye, 1. Cor. 16. 13.
stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. And again, Stand fast,
2. These. 2. 13. Apoc. 2. 25. Col. 1. 22, 23.
and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word or our
Epistle. Unto which constancy in the truth, he limiteth and appropriateth the
benefit of our Redemption by Christ. For he says, that we are reconciled by
his sufferings, if we continue in the faith, grounded and settled, Ephesians. 4. 14.
and be not moved awry from the hope of the Gospel. So elsewhere he charge
us, that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried
Gal. 3. 3.
about with every wind of doctrine. The which he condemns in the Galatians
as extreme folly: And rejoices in the contrary constancy of the Colossians;
ioying and beholding their order, and the steadfastness of their faith in
Christ. And the like constancy we must also show in the practice of all
Christian and religious duties, according to our profession, for as we must not
be weary of bearing upon us the livery of our Christian profession, and be
ready to cast it off when the sun of persecution shines, so neither in doing
the duties of our Lord and Masters service, but we must labor to be
stablished in every good word and work, as the Apostle prays 2. These. 2. 17.
for the Thessalonians: And desire with David, to keep the Law of God
continually for ever and ever. Our practice of godliness, must not with
Ephraims goodness be like a morning cloud which vanishes ere noone, nor like
Hos. 6. 4.
the dew, which falls ouer-night, and goes away the next morning. But
neglecting all things in comparison of this one thing necessary, we must make
them give place to the constant performance of religious duties, when as they
cannot stand together, whereof we have an example in Daniel, who setting all
things apart, would not neglect his constant course Dan. 6.
of calling upon God three times a day, though thereby he hazzarded the favor
of the King, yea even his own life. Whose example if we would imitate, we must
carefully avoid two vices, as notable hindrances of this constancy; the first
is careless sloth in spiritual duties, arising from our overmuch minding and
affecting of worldly things, which makes us either to neglect them altogether,
or to perform them inconstantly, and only by fits, which kind of
intermission is a temporary defection, and if it be not reformed, will bring us
at last to a full and final neglect of them. The other is fickle inconstancy
in our courses, proceeding from carnal lothing of spiritual exercises; which
causes us to be soon weary of performing any good duty, and therefore to
shift and change (as the sick man turns from one side to another) unto a new
exercise, before we have finished that in hand, and brought it to any good
effect; like the unruly Patient, who hinders the cure by often changing of
medicines, before any of them have had time to work; or the foolish Gardener,
who every hand while transplanteth his trees from one soil to another, and
lets them not have any convenient time to be settled and rooted.

CAP. IX.
Reasons which may move us to be constant in all Christian duties of a godly
life, and the means of it.

. Sect. 1 That constancy is an inseparable companion of integrity.
ANd thus we see what that constancy which is required in the duties of a
godly life, and the vices which we are to shun as opposite unto it. The
arguments which may move us to this constancy, are many, some whereof I will
briefly touch. The first reason is, because it is an inseparable companion of
integrity and uprightness of heart; For if in sincerity and truth we perform
service unto God, out of our love and obedience to his will, then these motives
always remaining, will make us constant in doing of it. Whereas if in
hypocrisy we formally perform any duties, being moved thereunto by worldly
respects, then does our obedience last no longer then they last, and as they
are variable and subject to many changes, so shall we likewise change with
them; according to that of the Apostle James; A double minded man is unstable
in all his ways. Secondly, if we be Iam. 1. 8.
not constant in the duties of a godly life, all the pains which we take by
fits will be spent in vain; seeing we shall undo that one day which we did
the day before, and like foolish builders, one while setting up, and another
while pulling down, we shall not be edified in our faith and sanctification,
and after much time spent, be never the nearer the finishing of our work. For
though at some times we row never so strongly against the tide and stream of
our corruption, yet when we intermit our labor, and give our selves to sloth
and negligence, they will carry us down again as far from the Haven of our
hopes, as we were at the beginning. Of which, we have lamentable experience in
many ancient professors, who through this inconstancy in religious duties,
stand at a stay (like dwarses, whose age brings no growth) neither increasing
in knowledge, faith, and other saving graces, nor in bringing forth of the
fruits of them in their lives and conversation. If therefore we would spend
our pains to any purpose, let us not only begin well, but continue the work
of our sanctification, till we have perfected our holiness in the fear of
God, as the Apostle 2. Cor. 7. 1.
exhorts. If we would be true Nazarites consecrated to Gods service, we must
not be holy by fits, but fulfill the days of our sanctification, and
separating Number. 6. 5, 8.
our selves from all sinful pollution, we must be holy to the Lord. For as in
legal purifications, though a man observed never so strictly some Number. 19. 11,
12.
days allotted to his clensing, yet if he failed in any one, though it were
the very last, and defiled himself with any legal pollution, all his former
labor was spent in vain, and the work was new to begin again: so is it also
in our spiritual purifying, and in our sanctifying and consecrating our selves
to Gods worship and service. Thirdly, the benefits which arise from this
constancy, may persuade us to embrace it; for by continuance in Ioh. 8. 31.
the Word of Christ, we approve our selves to be his Disciples indeed. We
shall with much ease perform all Christian duties, when by our constancy we
have brought our selves to an habit. And as all things which are put into a
state of motion, do continue moving with great facility and little help; and
if it be intermitted, requires much more strength and pains to begin it
again, then it would have required to have continued it in that state; so if
we be continually inured to the duties of a godly life, they will be easy and
familiar unto us whilst this spiritual motion continues, but if it be broken
off and intermitted, it is a new work to begin again, and will not be renewed
to the former state, without much endeavor and great difficulty. It is easy to
keep that armor bright which is daily used, but use it only by some fits,
and hang it by the walls till it be rusty, and it cannot, without much labor
in skowring it, be restored again to its former brightness. If the Instrument
be daily played upon, it is easily kept in tune by the skillful Musician, but
let it but a while be neglected and cast in a corner, the strings and frets
break, and the bridge flies off, and no small labor is required to bring it
into order. And thus also it is in spiritual things, which are kept in an
easy and orderly course, with one half of the pains, if we continue them
with a settled constancy. Finally, this constancy in holy duties gives us
assurance of all Gods promises, according to that of the Apostle; We are made
partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning Heb. 3. 14.
of our confidence steadfast unto the end; and that covenant made with David in
the behalf of his son Solomon: I will establish his Kingdom for ever, 1.
Chro. 28. 7.
if he be constant to do my Commandments and my judgments as at this day:
and by Gods gracious and free promise gives us just title to spiritual and
heavenly rewards: For he will render to every man according to his deeds. To
Romans 2. 6, 7.
them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, and honor, and
immortality; eternal life, as the Apostle speaks.

. Sect. 2 The manifold evils which accompany inconstancy in good duties.
Lastly, the manifold evils which are caused by inconstancy, may effectually
move us to be constant in all good duties. For this various and often changing
of our spiritual estate upon every slight occasion, makes our service odious
unto God, and all our actions unclean in his sight. The which is employed in
the ceremonial Law, wherein the Chamelion was forbidden, among the beasts
which were unclean, whose property is to hold constantly no color, but
changes as the things are changed which lie next unto it. Secondly, it
hinders our growth in grace, and makes all the good means which we use to
this purpose, unprofitable unto us. It disableth us in our spiritual race,
from coming to the goal, and getting the garland, and causes us to be
prevented with their speed, who set out long after us. It makes us unfit for
all good duties, and not only more backward unto them by our intermission, but
also more unable to perform when we do undertake them. For when we have for a
time neglected prayer, meditation, hearing the Word, and such like spiritual
exercises; our deceitful hearts, after they are broken loose out of the bonds
of Gods fear, and have tasted the carnal sweetness of this slothful
liberty, are hardly recalled and recovered; and not without much pains reduced
into order, nor well settled and composed to religious duties. It hinders us
in our spiritual journey toward our heavenly home; and whereas those who are
constant in their travel, and rid continually some part of the way, come
seasonably and surely to their iourneys end, though they seem to go a slow
pace; these who go on by fits and spurts, tire themselves in the mid way, and
though sometimes they seem to go a gallop, yet their many intermissions, and
often stays make them to be benighted, and to give over their travel before
they come to their iournies end. Finally, it greatly indangereth us unto final
apostasy, for leaving those good duties undone, which our consciences
approving, call upon us to perform, and by this negligence running into
tentation, it is just with God to leave us in it, and to withdraw his grace,
which only gives unto us both will and ability for the well performing of any
good duty. Whereof it comes to pass, that many who intend at the first but to
play the truants, and to intermit their studies for a time, that they may take
their liberty and pleasure, and then to come unto Christ's school again, are
afterward partly so possessed with fear and shame of their Masters presence,
and partly so bewitched with their carnal delights, that they run quite
away, and never return. And when they have thus far given place to the
devils tentations, and the sluggish sloth of their sinful flesh, that they
intermit all spiritual exercises, as prayer, hearing the Word, reading,
meditation, that they may the more thoroughly intend their worldly profits or
delights, yet with a purpose to return unto them again when these things are
dispatched; they are more and more ensnared in Satan's nets of perdition, into
which they have cast themselves, and the longer they forbear, the less
appetite they have to religious duties. Lastly, this inconstancy makes us
far worse in the service of God, then the sons of Belial are in the service
of the devil, and of the world. For they, for the uncertain and base wages of
earthly trifles, are constant in those works of darkness wherein they employ
them, toyling themselves, and spending their strength in their servile drudgery
night and day, though it be to the everlasting damnation both of their bodies
and souls: whereas these who profess themselves the servants of God, serve
him negligently by fits and starts, one while taking a little pains in
spiritual exercises, and another while intermitting their labors, and
spending their time in sloth and idleness, although he incourageth them to do
him faithful and constant service, with the present pay of all temporal
blessings, and with the assured hope of future happiness.

. Sect. 3 Of the means whereby we may be enabled to serve God constantly in
the duties of a godly life.
And these are the reasons which may move us to constancy in the duties of Gods
service. In the next place let us consider of some means which may enable us
unto it. The first means is, often and seriously to consider of Gods manifold
mercies and rich rewards, both in this life and the life to come, which he has
faithfully promised unto all those who do him diligent and constant service.
For in this world nothing shall be wanting to those that serve and fear him;
for if he provides so liberally even for strangers and enemies; then will he
much more for those of his own family, and not suffer them to want any thing
which is good. He will shine upon them with the bright beams of his face and
favor, and glad their hearts with the joy of his countenance. He will
preserve them from all dangers, and mightily defend them from the malice and
power of all their enemies. He will watch over them with his providence to do
them good, and will have them always at his finding, who has all things in
heaven and earth to bestow upon the^. He will enrich them with the chief
treasures of his spiritual graces; and hereafter give them the possession and
fruition of heavenly happiness. So that though we should not intermit our
pains in the duties of his service for the space of an hour in the whole
course of our lives; yet may we say of our doings, as the Apostle of our
sufferings, The service of this present life is not worthy the glory Romans 8. 18.
which shall be revealed; for that is short and momentany, weak and imperfect,
but shall be rewarded with a far more excellent and eternal weight of glory.
The second means of constancy is, to take notice, and to have a Second means.
true sense of our frailty and infirmity, our natural mutability and
inconstancy, our dullness and weariness in all good duties, that so we may
keep a narrow watch over our selves, and not give way to our spiritual sloth
when it creeps upon us, and moves us to intermit the duties of a godly life.
We must not be proud and presumptuous of our strength, as though it were in our
power to leave and resume our work when we please; but be humbled in the
sight and sense of our backwardness and weariness in holy duties; and as the
Apostle exhorts, we must not be Romans 11. 20. 1. Cor. 10. 12. Phil. 2. 12.
Prou. 28. 14.
high minded, but fear: whilst we seem to stand, we must take heed of
falling, and work out our salvation with fear and trembling. For, blessed is
he which thus seareth always; seeing it will make him careful to keep his
spiritual watch, that he do not neglect or intermit any good duty which may
strengthen his faith in the assurance of his salvation. The third means is,
Third means.
that we endeavor to work our hearts to the love, not only of God, which will
make all our labors light which we take in serving him whom our souls love,
but also of the spiritual duties themselves, by meditating often upon their
excellency, profit and necessity above all worldly employments. For what the
soul loves, in that it rests with unwearied delight, and so pleases it
self in the fruition of it, that it admits no thought of change. The fourth
means is, to keep our selves in acquaintance with all Fourth means.
good duties, that they grow not strange unto us, and that we give no place to
sloth, but keep our selves in continual exercise, which will enable us to hold
out with constancy. For the more we do them, the more easy shall we find
them, and our selves more strong and able to continue in them. And as runners
in a race do daily use exercise to keep themselves in breath, and that they
may be more able and active to perform it, and hold out when they run for
the Garland: whereas if they should intermit their diligence, and give
themselves to ease and sloth, it would make them short-winded, and unable to
continue when they strive for the mastery: so in this spiritual race, the more
we exercise our selves in Christian duties, the better able we are to continue
in them without fainting or weariness; and the less pains we take, the
sooner we are out of breath, and less able to continue in our course. The
fifth means is, that seeing Fifth means.
we are naturally glutted with saciety in the continual use of the same thing,
and delighted with some variety and change, we do not wholly tire our selves
in any one good exercise; but seeing God has given unto us variety and choice
of many Christian and religious duties, and will not be served by one of them
alone, but has allotted unto every one of them their due time and season:
Therefore avoiding that unconstant leuity before spoken of, shifting and
changing, before we have brought the duty in hand to some good effect, that we
may receive some fruit and benefit by it, it is profitable for the inabling us
to this constancy in Gods service, when we feel our selves weary of one good
duty, to betake our selves to another; as from praying, to reading; from
hearing, to meditating or conferring; from religious exercises, to the civil
duties of our callings; and when we feel our spirits spent, our minds dulled,
and bodies wearied with them both, or either of them, to refresh our selves
with honest and moderate recreations: whereby we shall not only preserve our
strength, that after one duty done, we may be more fit to perform another,
but also return unto the same duty again in seasonable time with a better
stomach, when as we left it with some appetite, and were not glutted with any
lothing saciety. The last means of constancy is, that we Sixth means.
do all good duties in due time and order: For these are inseparable
companions, and mutual helps one to another: so the Apostle says, that he
rejoiced in the Colossians, beholding their order, and the steadfastness of
their Col. 2. 5. 1. Cor. 14. 33, 40
faith; and exhorts the Corinthians to the same practice, that all things
should be done decently and in order in the service of God, because he was not
a God of confusion, but of order and peace. And this will much further us in
constancy, seeing those things continue longest, which have an orderly
proceeding: as we see in the celestial bodies, which as they much excel all
earthly things in their admirable order, so also in the constancy of their
motion. That therefore we may be alike constant in all our courses of
Christianity, let us be like them also in their orderly proceeding, and
beginning the day with spiritual exercises, as before has bin showed, and so
proceeding to civil duties, let us hold on in the same tenor, neither
confusedly intermixing them one with another, nor upon every slight occasion
changing our course. And if we constantly observe this order, this order will
be a notable means to preserve our constancy.

CAP. X.
Of our perseverance in all Christian duties of a godly life.

. Sect. 1 That we must persevere both in profession and practice of godliness.
But as we must be every day constant in the duties of a godly life without
intermission, so must we persevere in them unto Psalm. 1 3. and 92. 12, 14.
Psalm. 112. 9. Prou. 4. 18.
the end without apostasy or defection. For as it is the property of a
faithful and blessed man to bring forth his fruit in due time and season, so
also not to fade or wither, but to flourish always like the Palm tree, and to
bring forth most fruit in old age. His righteousness indureth for ever, and
his ways are like a shining light, which shines more and more unto the
perfect day. An example whereof we have in the Church of Thyatira, whose last
works were more then their first. Now Apoc. 2. 19.
this perseverance must be showed both in embracing and professing the truth of
Christian doctrine, and also in practicing the holy duties which it teaches in
the whole course of our lives and conuersations. Unto the former the Apostle
exhorts, Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has Gal. 5. 1.
made us free. The Apostle John likewise: Let that therefore abide in you,
which 1. Ioh. 2. 24.
you have heard from the beginning. And our Savior Christ in his Epistle to
the Churches: That which you have already, hold fast till I come. The other,
Apoc. 2. 25.
the Lord himself commands: Thou shall love the Lord thy God, and keep
Deuteronomy. 11. 1. and 12. 1. Micah 4. 5. 2. King. 17. 37
his charge and his Statutes, and his Judgments, and his Commandments always:
or as he expounds it in another place; In all the days that thou live upon
the earth, or for evermore. And contrariwise apostasy and defection is
forbidden; Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
unbelief, Heb 3. 12.
in departing from the living God.

. Sect. 2 Of the means of perseverance. 1. Means.
Now the means whereby we may attain unto this perseverance in the duties of
a godly life, are diverse. The first is, to consider often with Math. 24. 13.
Apoc. 2. 10. Apoc. 2. 11. 26. and 3. 11. 12.
our selves, that all Gods gracious promises are limited and restrained unto
those (not that begin well, or hold out to the mid way, but) who persevere unto
the end. So our Savior Christ, He that indureth to the end, shall be saved.
Be faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a Crown of life. And not he
that fights, but in fighting overcomes, has the promises of freedom from
all misery, and fruition of heavenly happiness made unto him. And elsewhere he
indefinitely promises, that if we abide Joh. 15. 7.
in him, and let his Word abide in us, then ask what we will, and it shall be
done unto us. To the same purpose the Apostle James tells us, that who so
Iam. 1. 25.
looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not
a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, that man shall be blessed in his
deed. And the Apostle to the Hebrews says, that we are made partakers of
Christ, Heb. 3. 14.
if we hold out the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end. And
therefore if we mean to have any part in Gods promises, we must constantly
persevere in the profession and practice of true godliness, and the Christian
duties of an holy life. The second means of perseverance, is carefully to The
second means of perseverance, is to avoid the causes and means of apostasy
and defection.
avoid the causes and means of apostasy and defection. And these are diverse:
first, voluntary living in any known sin, which will harden the heart, and
dead the conscience, and so make way for many others, till we be wholly
carried away from God in a stream of wickedness. Secondly, we must carefully
take heed of the least declinations in Christian graces and holy duties; for if
we be once going down the hill, we shall hardly keep our selves from running
headlong to the bottom, unless we stop speedily in the very beginning. And
as for the preserving of our bodies in a sound estate, we labor with
seasonable physic to prevent diseases, and when we find our health to
decline a little, do use all good means at the first, because if the
sickness seize thoroughly upon the vital parts, it will hardly be removed, and
endanger our lives: so must we take the same course for the good of our souls,
carefully observing the first declinations of our spiritual health, that we
may stop them at the beginning, before they break out into any extremities.
And considering that those diseases both of body and soul, are most dangerous
and desperate (not which come suddenly with some sensible violence, but) which
steal upon us by degrees upon no apparent causes, and impair the health by
little and little, because they are hardly discerned, and when they are known,
not easily cured, as in the outward man, the consumption, hectique fever, and
the like; and in the inward and spiritual part, carnal security, hardness of
heart, and others of like nature; let us not therefore neglect the least
declinations in saving grace, and holy duties, but keep a careful watch over
our selves, that none of these diseases of our souls steal upon us, and
become desperate before we discern them. Let us be as good husbands for our
souls, as we are for our clothes, houses and grounds, mending little holes,
before they tear out into great rents, repairing the first decays, ere they
become rotten and ruinous, and making up the breach as soon as we discern
it, before it come to an inundation, and carry us away in a flood of
wickedness. And this counsel the Apostle gives us. Lift up (says he) the
hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; and make straight paths to your
feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be
healed, etc. Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest
any root of bitterness springing up, trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.
A third cause of apostasy, is a great opinion of our own strength, which
causes God to leave us that we may see our weakness, as we see in the
fearful defection of the Apostle Peter: And also a fond conceit that we are so
rich in grace, that we may spend upon the stock, and labor for no more; and
that we have already so well profited in religious duties, that we need not
take any care or pains to make any further progress: For there is no standing
still in the ways of Christianity; but when we cease to go forward, we begin
to go backward; when in our own opinion we are at the full, we will begin to
wane and decline toward a change; and when our godliness is come to a
standing water, it presently declineth and never cease, until it be come to
a low ebb. For the preventing whereof, let us not measure our virtues and good
proceedings by the false mete-yard of pride and self-love, which will make us
ouerweene our own gifts and good parts; nor compare our selves with our
selves, or others that come behind us, and have not attained unto Gal. 6. 4.
our measure, but with the perfect Law of God, which like a lookingglasse will
discover our blemishes and imperfections, and with our Savior Christ, the
perfect pattern of holiness and righteousness, according Ephesians. 4. 13, 14, 15.
to whose Image we ought to be conformed. A fourth cause of defection from God
and godliness which we must shun, is the immoderate love of the world and
worldly vanities, which cools and quenches in us the love of God, and of
spiritual and heavenly things; and so choketh in us all good desires and
endeavors of seeking after them that we may obtain them. For as our Savior
tells us, we cannot serve God, and Mammon: Math 6. 24. Jam. 4. 4.
And the Apostle says, that the amity of the world is enmity with God; and
therefore whosoever will be a friend of the world, he is Gods enemy. Which
argument the Apostle John uses to dissuade us from this carnal love: Love not
the world (says he) nor the things that are in the world. If any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in him. A fifth cause, is slacknesse 1.
Ioh. 2. 15.
and negligence in the use of those means which both beget and begin Gods
graces in us, and also nourish and preserve them when they are begun; as the
hearing of the Word, reading, prayer, meditation, the Sacraments, and such
like. For as the strength of the body languisheth and consumes, if we refuse
our bodily food, whereby it is preserved, so must also our souls needs fall
into a consumption of all grace and goodness, if we neglect that spiritual
nourishment by which only they are sustained in us. A sixth cause is, the
grieuing of Gods Spirit dwelling in us, by quenching the good motions of it,
and defiling our souls with sins Ephesians. 4. 30. 1. These. 5. 19.
that waste the conscience, being committed wilfully against the knowledge;
which loathsome filthiness polluteth our souls and bodies, and makes this
holy Ghest weary of his lodging, and going away, to withdraw also with him his
gifts and graces, by which alone we are enabled unto all good duties. And
therefore if we would not fall away from all grace and goodness, let us
lovingly entertain the Author of them, and not grieve Gods holy Spirit, by
resisting those good motions which he puts into us, and by making our hearts
and bodies, which should be his holy temples and place of residence, a
loathsome stie of sinful uncleanness. A last cause of apostasy, is near and
inward familiarity with profane and wicked persons, who will corrupt us with
their evil examples, and poison us with the contagion of their sins,
alluring and drawing us by degrees Deuteronomy* 7. 2, 3, 4.
to accompany them in their evil courses, until at last we run on Pro. 22.
24, 25.
with them into the same excess of outrageous wickedness, and so give a
final farewell to all grace and goodness. 1. Cor. 6. 14.


. Sect. 3 The 3. means is to consider that we can no otherwise be accepted and
approved of God.
The third means of perseverance is to consider, that there is no other way to
be approved of God, either in our persons or actions. For Heb. 10. 38.
though our works make never so glorious a show in the sight of men, and our
first beginnings and proceedings seem most excellent, and give great
contentment both unto our selves and all others, yet if we continue not unto
the end, the Lord will take no delight either in us or them; according to that
of the Apostle: If any man draw back, my soul shall take no pleasure in him.
Fourthly, let us remember, that our begun and continued righteousness will not
at all profit us, if we desist in our course, and return again to our former
wicked ways. For so the Lord has plainly said, That the righteousness of the
righteous shall not deliver him in the day of Ezekiel. 33. 12.
his transgression, and for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall
thereby, in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither shall the
righteous be able to live for his righteousness, in the day that he sins,
etc. And therefore as the sinner has no cause to go on in his sin,
despairing of pardon, so Nec sanctus ergo securus esse debet, quandiu in huius
vitae agone versatur; nec desperare peccator, etc. Hier. ad Celantiam.
the righteous has no reason to desist in his righteousness, presuming of
reward, for that which he has done already. The fifth means is, to consider,
that if we persevere not in the profession and practice of true godliness,
all our former labor will not only be spent in vain, but also to our great
loss, seeing we shall be in far worse case after our apostasy, then we were
before we made any profession of Religion. For Satan having bin once beaten out
of possession, upon his return takes surer hold; and as our Savior speaks,
One evil spirit takes with him seven other worse then himself, Mat. 12. 44,
45.
and reenter and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse then the
first. So the Apostle Peter tells us, that it had bin better for apostates
not to have 2. Pet 2. 20, 21. Heb. 6. 4. and 10. 26.
known the way of righteousness, then after they have known it, to turn
from it, like the Dog to his vomit, and the Sow being washed, to her wallowing
in the mire. The sixth means is, to have always in our remembrance the
fearful punishments which are inflicted upon Apostates, both in this life and
the life to come. For the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own
ways; and a Pro. 14. 14. and 1. 31.
good man, who perseuereth in his integrity, shall be satisfied from himself.
More especially, he that forsakes God and the ways of his Commandments, the
Lord will forsake him, and give him over unto himself, to go on in his own
sinful courses to his everlasting perdition and destruction, according to that
of David to his son Solomon; If thou forsake him, he will 1. Chro. 28. 9.
cast thee off for ever. And that of Azariah to Asa; The Lord is with you, 2.
Chro. 15. 2.
while you be with him, and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if
you forsake him, he will forsake you. So the Lord threatens to stretch out
his Zeph. 1. 4, 6. Luke 17. 32.
hand, and to cut off them that were turned back from him, and those who had
not sought him, nor inquired after him. In the life to come Apostates shall be
deprived of heavenly happiness, for he only that indureth to the end, shall be
Mat. 24. 13.
saved. And he that puts his hand to the plough, and looks back, shall
not be Luke 9. 62.
thought fit for the Kingdom of God. Yea, they shall not only lose these
heavenly joys, but also have their portion in hellish torments; For they that
Heb. 10. 26, 27.
sin willingly, after they have received the knowledge of the truth, and
persevere in their sins without repentance, there remains unto them no more
sacrifice for sins; but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery
indignation which shall devour the adversaries, as the Apostle speaks.

. Sect. 4 The last means of perseverance, is Prayer.
Lastly, if we would persevere in the duties of a godly life unto salvation, we
must remember, that it is not a thing in our own power, but the free gift of
God, and therefore if we would have it, we must continually beg it at his hands
by fervent and effectual prayer. For as it is he alone that gives unto us the
spiritual life of Grace, who were naturally dead in trespasses and sins; so
it is he only that can preserve us in it. And if he opens Psalm. 104. 18, 19.
his gracious hand, we shall be nourished and filled with all good; but if he
hides his face from us, we shall presently be troubled, and perish in our
former state of sin and infidelity. It is he that works in us both to will
and Phil. 2. 13. and 4. 13.
to do, of his good pleasure; and we who are able to do nothing of our
selves, are enabled to do all things through Christ which strengthens us. It
is he that begins the good work of grace in us, and he only can perform
and finish it until the day of Jesus Christ. It is he alone, Phil. 1. 6.
that is able to keep us from falling, as the Apostle Jude speaks, and to
preserve Jude v. 24.
us faultlesse, before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. We can no
more walk in our own strength in the ways of godliness, then Peter could
upon the waters: but it is the power of Christ's Word, that supporteth us, and
keeps us from sinking, and his gracious promises of his help and assistance,
by which we are stayed. It is not our apprehending him, but his apprehending us
and holding us in his hand that preserves Phil. 3. 12. Esa. 41. 13.
us from falling; for our weak and childish hold would soon fail, though we
cling unto him by a lively faith, if he took not surer hold of us, and (as it
were) carried us like a loving Father in the arms of his providence. Neither
do we chiefly persevere, because we are faithful unto God, but because he is
faithful unto us, and will stablish and keep us from all evil. Our 2. These.
3. 3. 1. Cor. 1. 9. 1. These. 5. 24. Mat. 28. 18. Job. 10. 28, 29.
own strength would not stay us from being forcibly carried away with the
violent tentations of our spiritual enemies; but it is our Savior Christ that
keeps us, who having received from his Father all power in heaven and earth,
is stronger then all, and none shall be able to pluck us out of his and his
Fathers hands. It is he that confirms us unto the end, that we may 1. Cor. 1.
8. Esa. 54. 10.
be blameless unto the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ. The promises of God
which in Christ are yea and Amen, unto the glory of God by us, are they which
stablish us in him; and it is he that has sealed us, and given us the 2. Cor.
1. 21, 22.
earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. And therefore if we would persevere in
grace and in the ways of godliness, we must beg it at Gods hands, and pray
for our selves, as the Apostle for the Colossians, that he will replenish Col.
1. 10, 11.
us with knowledge of his will in all wisdom, that we may walk worthy the
Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in
the knowledge of God, strengthened with all might, according to his glorious
power, unto all patience and long-suffering with ioyfulnesse. And as he prays
for the Thessalonians; that the Lord will make us to increase and abound in
love, 1. These. 3. 13.
to the end that he may stablish our hearts unblameable in holiness before
God, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his Saints.

THE FIFTH BOOK OF A GODLY LIFE, CONTAINING IN IT THE HELPS AND MEANS WHICH
ENABLE US UNTO IT.
CAP. I.
Of the rules of a godly life, whereby we may be directed in the right
performing of all Christian duties. And first, of such rules as respect the
causes of it, both principal and subordinate.

. Sect. 1 Of the helps inabling us to lead a godly life.
Having showed what the godly life is, and the duties wherein it consists,
with the properties belonging to them, which serve as way-markes and signs,
whereby we may know that we are in a right course; it now remains, that we
entreat both of the helps whereby we may be furthered in the ways of
godliness, and also of the impediments, which hindering us in our Christian
course, are to be carefully removed out of the way, if we would travel in it
with any ease and comfort, and come happily to the end of our iourneys. For as
they who are to run a race for a corruptible crown, think it not sufficient
to know perfectly the way, with the nature and properties of it, as whether it
be long or short; up, or down the hill; rough or plain: but also carefully
use all helps which may further them in the race, and remove all impediments
which may hinder their speed, and frustrate their hopes of coming seasonably
to the goal, and winning the Garland: so must we all take the same course in
running of the spiritual Race of a godly life, that we may obtain that Crown
which is heavenly and immortal. The helps whereby we may be furthered and
enabled to lead a godly life, are either the means which tend to the
advancing of it; or the arguments and reasons which may induce and persuade us
to use them, and to practice all Christian and holy duties in the whole course
of our lives and conversation. The means respect either direction or practice:
The former consisting in certain rules which are to be observed, that we may
profitably proceed in the ways of godliness: The other in well using of certain
special means which God has ordained and sanctified to this end, that they
may enrich us with his spiritual and saving graces, and strengthen us to the
performing of those Christian duties which belong to a godly life. The rules to
be observed, have either reference to such things as belong to all Christian
duties, or to the duties themselves.

. Sect. 2 The first rule is, that we make God the supreme end of all Christian
duties, and wholly deny our selves in them.
Of the former sort, are such as concern either their causes or their
circumstances. The causes are chief and principal, or else subordinate and
Mat. 5. 16. 1. Cor. 10. 31. 1. Pet. 2. 12.
isntrumental. The chief and principal cause of working all holy duties, in,
and by us, is God himself, the Father, Son, and holy Spirit. Concerning
whom, this first rule is to be observed, that seeing God is the chief Author
of all good duties which can be performed by us, that therefore we also make
him the supreme end of them, propounding unto our selves his glory in the
undertaking of any action, as the main motive that induces us unto it. And
seeing he is first and last in all holy duties which are performed of us, and
both begins, continues, and finisheth his works of grace in and by us;
yea, seeing we our selves are wholly his, 1. Cor. 6. 20.
both by right of creation, preservation, and redemption; therefore being his
and not our own, we must deuote and consecrate our selves wholly, and all our
actions and intentions to his service, performing all Christian duties, not as
acts of our own wills, to please or profit our selves, but as works which he
wills and commands, and are therefore pleasing and acceptable in sight. So
that this must be our first step and entrance to the Christian duties of a
godly life, utterly to deny our selves and our own wills, and acknowledging
God to be all in all, we are to resign both our persons and actions to be
directed and guided as he pleases, and to make his will in all things the rule
of ours; not performing the duties of a godly life, because they are pleasing
unto us, or plausible unto others, but because God requires them, and it is
his will, that being sanctified, we should glorify 1. These. 4. 3.
him, in bringing forth much fruit. We must, if we will be Christ's Disciples, in
the very first place deny our selves, and take up our cross and follow him. We
Ioh. 15. 8.
must not, like untamed Heifers, run and range which way we list, but we must
take upon us his easy yoke and light burden, and casting off our pride and
Mat. 11. 29.
self-will, we must learn of him to be humble and meek in spirit. We must be
content to be, not what we would, but what God will have us, both doing and
suffering whatsoever he commands or imposes. We must go the way that nature
shunneth, if God choose it for us; and walk with Peter, not whither Joh. 21. 18.
we would, but whither we would not. An example of which obedience we have in
the Saints of Macedonia, who resigned themselves unto the Lord in doing 2. Cor.
8. 5.
his will, and in him to the direction of his holy Apostle. And in Paul also,
who before his conversion applied himself to do his own will, and to please the
Act. 9. 6.
chief Priests, but no sooner was he cast down and humbled, but presently he
offreth himself to Gods service, and desires to be guided by the will of
Christ. Yea our Savior himself, who is the most perfect pattern for our
imitation, though his humane will were most just and holy, yet professes that
he sought not his own will, but the will of his Father who sent him. Neither
Ioh. 5. 30.
must we only deny our own wills in all our doings, that we may submit them unto
Gods, but also in our sufferings, that so we may say with David; Here am 2. Sam.
15. 26.
I, let him do to me, as seems good unto him; and with our Savior Christ
himself; If this Cup may not pass by me, not my will, but thine be done. The
Mat. 26. 39, 42.
fruits and benefits of which resigning up our selves wholly to the direction
and disposing of Gods will, are great and manifold. For thus all our actions
must needs be pleasing unto God, seeing they are conformable to his own will.
We shall live the life of Christ, when being wholly moved Gal. 2. 20.
and ruled by his Spirit, we shall do, not our own wills, but his, and the
will of his and our heavenly Father. We shall be partakers of the divine nature,
as the Apostle Peter speaks, when as keeping his residence in us by his 2.
Pet. 1. 4.
Spirit, his holy will does reign and rule in us. We shall greatly profit in
humility, which is that Christian ornament that chiefly makes us glorious in
the sight of God. We shall be contented in all estates, and rejoice even in
tribulation and affliction, because the will of God is fulfilled in us, upon
which our will depends. Finally, the will of God shall be unto us as a most
skilful and faithful Pilot, which standing at the stern, will direct us in
all our courses, in this our dangerous passage through the sea of this world,
and preserve us safe in all tempestuous troubles, from falling upon the rocks
and shelfes, upon which we would often run and make shipwreck of our souls,
if we followed not this guide, but were led by the direction of our own
corrupt and unskillful wills, or by the traditions of others who are as
ignorant as our selves.

. Sect. 3 The second rule respecting our Savior Christ; namely, that we aim
at him as the main scope of all our actions.
The second rule of direction for the leading of a godly life, respects our
Savior Christ, namely, that we propound him as the maine scope and mark at
which we aim in all our actions, not resting in the best duties which we
perform, as having in them any sufficiency to make us happy and blessed, but
using them as helps to gain Christ, and to confirm and assure our union and
communion with him, by whom alone we attain unto happiness. The end of our
legal knowledge, is not chiefly that we may obey it, and so live in our own
righteousness, but to discover our misery both in respect of sin and
punishment, that thereby we may be driven out of our selves unto Christ, and
seek in him righteousness and Joh. 17. 3.
salvation. The end of the knowledge of the Gospel and of all other knowledge,
learning and wisdom, is to bring us to the knowledge of Christ and him
crucified; for the saving knowledge of this only, would make us happy, though
we were mere Idiots in all other things; whereas if we had all other knowledge
of the secrets of nature, the profundity of all Arts and sciences, yea even of
the highest and darkest mysteries of Religion, yet wanting this alone, we
should be miserable. And therefore the Apostle neglecting the excellency of
all other wisdom, determined 1. Cor. 2. 1, 2.
not to know any thing, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. In respect of
this, he esteemed all other gain but loss and dung, and propounded this unto
himself, as his chief mark unto which he pressed with all his power, that he
might know Christ, and the power of his Resurrection, and the fellowship Phil.
3. 10, 14.
of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death. In which, when he
had attained unto it in some measure, he chiefly gloried. The end Gal. 6. 14.
of our faith must not be to rest in it, as an infused grace, for which in its
own virtue we are accepted, but that it may serve as an instrument to apply
and appropriate unto us Christ and his righteousness, in and by whom alone we
are justified in the sight of God. The end of our hearing and reading the Word,
is not chiefly to commend us unto God by the performance of a religious act of
his service, but that we may thereby come to the knowledge of Christ, and
apply him unto us by a lively faith. The end of our receiving the Sacraments,
is to confirm and assure our union and communion with Christ. The end of our
prayers, is not that for themselves and their own feruency and holiness, they
should be heard and granted of God, but only in the mediation and
intercession of Jesus Christ. Finally, the end of all the duties of a godly
life and fruits of new obedience, is not to satisfy Gods Justice and merit
heaven, but to assure us that we are ingrafted as lively branches in the true
Vine Jesus Christ, and that we have from him this sap of grace which makes us
fruitful, seeing without him we could do nothing; and that we are partakers
of the virtue Ioh. 15. 4, 5.
and power of his death and Resurrection unto Justification, and the remission
of the guilt and punishment of all our sins, seeing we feel them powerful
in us for our sanctification, and for the abating of the corruption, and
subduing in us the power of sin, so that it no longer reigns in Romans 6. 12.
our mortal bodies. Now the reason why we must not rest in our Christian
graces and holy duties themselves, but only use them to another end,
propounding unto them as their main scope the gayning of Christ, and that we
may hereby be more nearly and firmly united unto him, is, because nothing in
us, nor any thing done by us is pleasing unto God in it own worth and
excellency, but only as it is accepted in Christ the Son of his love, in whom
only he is well pleased; for even our prayers themselves Mat 3. 17. and 17. 5.
are but a loathsome sacrifice, unless our high Priest taking them at our
hands, do put them into his golden Censor, and sweeten them with Apoc. 8. 3.
the odoriferous Incense, and fragrant breath of his mediation and
intercession. Our best righteousness, being imperfect and stained with our
corruptions like a polluted cloth, will not endure the pure and parching eye
Esa. 64. 6.
of Gods strict Justice; unless our imperfections be covered with the perfect
righteousness of Jesus Christ, and the pollution washed away in his most
precious blood. And therefore let not this be the end of all our Christian
duties in a godly life, that they may bring us directly unto God, in their own
credit, or procure his favor in their own worth and excellency, for then he
will justly reject both us and them; but let us propound the getting of Christ
as the maine scope of them all, that so being united unto him, we and our
duties may in him be accepted before God, and receive a rich reward by virtue
of his merits and perfect obedience.

. Sect. 4 The third rule, respecting the Spirit of God dwelling in us.
The third rule respects the holy Spirit of God dwelling in us, namely, that
seeing we cannot of our selves pray, or hear, or read, or meditate, Romans 8.
15, 26.
or else perform any other Christian and holy duties, but as this Spirit
helps our infirmities, and gives us power to bring them to some good effect;
therefore stopping our ears to carnal disputes, and shaking off the yoke of
natural and corrupted reason, we must, in the performing of all the duties of
a godly life, give our selves over to be governed and guided by it, both in
respect of the matter, manner, and time of doing them. And when we hear the
voice of the Spirit secretly whispering in our hearts (like the voice of one
standing behind us) saying, This is the way, walk thou Esa. 30. 21.
in it, when thou turnest to the right hand or to the left, we are to be
directed by it. And when it puts into our minds any good motions, or
inciteth us unto any holy duties, as praying, hearing, reading, meditating,
renewing of our repentance, or doing the works of mercy, and such like, we
must not quench the Spirit, by checking these motions, nor by delaying and 1.
These. 5. 19.
putting them off to another time, but undertake them presently, and labor to
bring them to good effect, whilst it offers unto us its help and
assistance, without which, of our selves we are able to do nothing that is
good. Let us not grieve the good Spirit of God dwelling in us, whereby we are
Ephesians. 4. 30.
sealed to salvation, by refusing his government, (as the Israelites dealt with
Samuel) notwithstanding it is so profitable unto us, pulling (as it were) his
1. Sam. 12.
Scepter out of his hand, and saying unto him, as those Rebels to Christ, This
man shall not reign over us: but like obedient subjects, let us submit Luke
19. 14.
our selves in all things to be ruled by it; and when we discern that the
motions which are put into our minds, are his, (as we may easily know them
from all others, both by their holiness resembling their Author, and their
agreement with the voice of the Spirit in the holy Scriptures) let us 2. Tim.
1. 6.
not only yield unto them, but also give them the best entertainment;
nourishing and cherishing them when they seem weak, and inciting and
re-inliuing them when as they begin to languish and dye in us, by meditation,
prayer, reading, and other such like religious exercises. Let us open the door
of our hearts when he knocks, and give kind entertainment Apoc. 3. 20.
to this holy Ghest, who brings his cheer with him, and will feast us with a
delicate banquet of spiritual graces. But especially when he visits us after
an especial and extraordinary manner, and gives more evident signs of his
presence then at other times, by working more powerfully good motions in us,
kindling our zeal, and enlarging our hearts with the love of God, and the
duties of his service, then are we not by sloth to let slip so good an
opportunity of enriching our souls with saving graces, but we must (as we use
to say) strike whilst the iron is hot, and reap our harvest, whilst this
Sunshine continues: we must set up all our sails, whilst this fair gale of
wind lasts; and so we shall in a shorter time make a far greater progress
in our course of godliness, then in many months, when being left by the
Spirit, in respect of this extraordinary efficacy and operation, we shall be
becalmed, and have neither will nor power to go forward. When he offers
himself in an unusual manner unto us, in our traveling of the spiritual
journey, (as the Angel to Jacob) we must take fast hold of him, not suffering
him to depart, before he has given us an extraordinary blessing. And when he
moves our hearts, as the Angel the Poole of Bethesda, and by his special
presence infuseth into them more then wonted virtue; let us not suffer so good
an opportunity to pass, without making of it some spiritual advantage, for
the curing of our sores and sicknesses of sins, and the confirming and
increasing of our health and strength in our inner man.

. Sect. 5 That we often renew the Covenant of grace between God and us.
The rules which respect the subordinate causes and helps, whereby we are
enabled to perform the duties of a godly life, are diverse. The first, that we
often renew the covenant of grace between God and us, by renewing the
condition of it on our part, faith and repentance. In which exercise, as we are
to renew our sorrow for all our sins, and those above the rest, which we have
most often committed, and thereby most offended and dishonored God; so
especially for those sins and corruptions which have most disabled us unto
the duties of a godly life, and have plunged us into the contrary wickedness,
whereby we have served sin and Satan. As our negligence and want of zeal,
and holy care to glorify God by the light of our Christian conversation, and
bringing forth the fruits of new obedience, and adorning our profession by our
holy conversation, whereby contrariwise we have caused Gods holy Name to be
blasphemed, and our Christian profession to be slandered and evil spoken of,
as though it were the cause of all our inormities. Our security and hardness
of heart, whereby we have made no good use either of Gods Word or works, his
mercies or judgments, to be drawn by them to repentance, and made more
diligent in the duties of his service; but putting the evil day far Math.
24. 48.
from us, have taken occasion thereby, with the evil servant, to be slothful
and negligent in all good duties, and to take liberty in running licentious
courses, loathing the means whereby we should have bin wakened and rowzed up
out of this spiritual lethargy. Our cowardice and slothfulnes in making war
against our flesh and fleshly lusts, whereby they have often gotten to such an
head, strength, and height of rebellion, that they have prevailed, and have
shamefully foiled the spiritual part, and led us captive unto sin. Our
negligence in preventing the occasions, and withstanding the first motions and
beginnings of sin, and our want of care, in banishing out of our minds and
hearts the desires and concupiscence of the flesh, when they were first
suggested unto us; whereof it has come to pass, that suffering them to rest
in us, we have been allured and tick led with carnal delight in thinking of
them, which has drawn us from our former sincerity, and moved us to like and
approve them, to consent unto, and produce them into act, when we have had fit
occasion. Our worldliness and earthly mindedness, which have made us, by
affecting transitory trifles, to neglect spiritual and heavenly excellencies,
and neglecting Gods service, to serve Satan, in hope of receiving this base
wages and rewards of iniquity. Our little profiting by the long inioying and
using of the light of the Gospel, and plentiful means of our salvation, for
the enriching of our selves with Gods spiritual and saving graces, knowledge,
faith, affiance, love, zeal, patience, or the fruitful exercizing of them in
the duties of a godly life: which has come to pass by our irreuerent,
slothful and sluggish using of the means, nor bringing unto them any faith,
zeal, feruency of spirit, or a good conscience. Our want of Christian valor
and resolution in the Christian warfare, and our often yielding unto the
tentations of Satan, the world, and our own flesh. Finally, our abuse of
prosperity and temporary blessings, which being given us of God as present
wages in our hands, to make us more cheerful in his service, we have abused as
means and occasions to make us more sinful, more forgetful of God, and
negligent and cold in his service: more proud, worldly, and unconscionable in
all our courses. And when we have called to our remembrance these, and such
other sins, whereby we have been hindered in the ways of godliness, and have
unfeignedly lamented and bewailed them with bitter grief, and resolved
amendment for the time to come; then are we also to renew and strengthen our
faith, by applying afresh unto us the gracious promises of the Gospel which
are made in Christ unto all repentant sinners. The which often renewing of our
covenant with God, will be a notable means of strengthening us unto all the
duties of a godly life; seeing this covenant of grace is the ground and
foundation of them, God having promised therein, that he will take away from
us our stony hearts, and give us hearts of flesh; and that he Ezekiel. 11. 19,
20. and 36. 26.
will put a new spirit within us, that we may walk in his statutes, and keep
his ordinances and do them. That he will give us one heart, and one way, that
we Ier. 31. 33. and 32. 40.
may fear him for ever; and put his Law in our inward parts, and write it in
our hearts, that we shall not depart from him. And as thus on Gods part we are
strengthened unto all good duties by his Spirit, which he promises and gives
unto us; so also on our part, this renewing of our faith inabling us hereunto;
for the more we are assured of the remission of our sins, and of all Gods
benefits, both spiritual in this life, and heavenly in the life to come, the
more we love him who has so loved us, and of his infinite bounty has
multiplied upon us such inestimable blessings; and Nehem. 10. 29.
the more we love him, the more loath we are to do any thing which may
displease him, and the more forward and willing to glorify him, and to
perform all good duties acceptable in his sight.

. Sect. 6 That we must take more care to approve our ways to God and our own
consciences, then unto men.
The second rule is, that we chiefly labor to approve all our works and
ways to God and our own consciences, rather then unto men, the testimony
whereof is much more to be esteemed then public fame, and humane censures. For
fame being but a breath of the often deceived multitude, may also deceive us,
by giving a false testimony, either on the worser or better part; but our
consciences, which are privy even to our secret actions, and inward intentions
in doing them, will not easily be corrupted to give in false evidence,
especially in those who are sanctified and regenerate. Humane and vulgar
censures are often false and frivolous, ridiculous and impious, applauding that
which God condemns, and condemning that which he commends; and commonly
that best pleases the multitude, which displeases him. They call him
honorable, not who honors God, and is honored of him, who is a son of
God, brother of Christ, and heir of heaven; but who is innobled by the virtues
of his parents, or who has bought glorious titles (as it were a slave in the
market, or as the Centurion his freedom) with a great sum. They call him
rich and happy, who is poor, beggarly, naked, and utterly destitute of the
riches of Gods graces, because he has some worldly pelf, which every day may
be taken from him, or he from it. And he of the world is esteemed valorous and
magnanimous, who is so impotent in ruling his passions, that he cannot bear
the least injury without taking revenge; and contrariwise he base and cowardly,
who dissembleth wrongs, and according to Christ's Commandment does readily
forgive them, leaving vengeance to God, unto who^ alone it belongs: Though
nothing is more contrary to true fortitude, or the magnanimous constancy of a
sound and well-settled mind, then with every wind of words to be moved out of
a right state; and with other men's folly to become furious and frantique. But a
good conscience gives in true evidence, as witnessing with God, or that which
he witnesses, not out of a blind opinion misled by passion, but according to
the book of holy Scriptures, with which this book of conscience commonly
agrees. And therefore if we would lead a godly life, and constantly perform
those Christian duties which are pleasing unto God, let us lightly regard the
censure of the multitude, who ordinarily outface and discountenance virtue and
piety, and commend and magnify vice and wickedness, justify those whom God
condemns, and condemn those that he justifies; accounting their false
praises a great dishonor, and their scorns and disgraces for innocence and
piety, our praise and glory, seeing he cannot be but honorable whom God
honors, nor want glory, whom Christ, his Saints and holy Angels approve and
applaud. And contrariwise, let us highly esteem, in all our actions, the
testimony of our own conscience, which will restrain us from secret sins,
as well as from open and notorious, and move and incite us to all Christian
duties, even in our secret closets, when there is none by to censure our
actions. And as no wise man in running of a race is much moved with the
speeches of the standers by, which he assuredly knows to be false and
frivolous, thinking ever the better of himself when he is cast behind all the
rest of the company, because they commend his speed, or the worse when he has
outstripped them and is near the goal, because they discommend him for his
slownesse: so neither must we be lifted up with a good conceit of our selves,
when others commend us for our swiftness in the spiritual race, if our own
consciences tell us, that we are slow and behind all the rest with whom we
contend for the Garland; nor yet dejected and discouraged when they dispraise
us: if we are privy unto our selves, that with all our endeavor we strive to
make our best speed.

. Sect. 7 That we must perform all good duties with a quiet and peaceable
mind.
The third rule is, that we labor to perform all the duties of a godly life
with a peaceable and quiet mind, which is not disturbed with disheartening
Romans 5. 3.
fears, or tumultuous passions. The which calm quietness arises from two
causes. The chief and principal is our peace with God, and peace of
conscience, which are effects and fruits of our justification by faith. The
which assuring us of the remission of our sins, our reconciliation with God,
victory over all the enemies of our salvation, and that the Lord so watches
over us with his providence, and rules us in all our ways with his Wisdom
and Power, that we shall never fall from him, and so ouer-ruleth all things
which oppose us, that nothing shall be able to hurt or hinder us, and all
things shall turn to our good, and further our salvation; we are made hereby
constant, cheerful and courageous in all Christian duties, serving the Lord in
holiness and righteousness, Luke 1. 74, 75.
without fear, all the days of our lives. For then our sins, and the
judgments of God due unto them will not terrify us, the malicious assaults
and tentations of our spiritual enemies will not affright and discourage us,
afflictions and persecutions for righteousness sake, and for the profession
and practice of Gods true Religion, will not daunt and dismay us, but we will,
in despite of all these oppositions, hold on our way, and finish our course
with joy. Whereas if we want this inward peace and tranquillity, our sins
will press us down as an heavy burden, and Psalm. 38. 4.
hinder our proceeding in the ways of godliness, our consciences will accuse
and terrify us; Satan with his tentations will affright and beat us down,
and outward troubles, joined with those inward discouragements which we find
in our selves, will so vex and disquiet us, that either we shall desist in
the ways of godliness, as despairing to overcome all these difficulties, or
else proceed slowly, and vnsettledly with much inconstancy and discomfort. The
second cause of this inward peace and tranquillity of mind, is the subduing and
mortifying of our carnal lusts and tumultuous passions, as worldly love,
fleshly fear, rash anger, and the rest; and the right ordering of all our
affections when they are sanctified. For where those unruly passions do still
live and bear sway, they blind the mind, that it cannot discern the right
way; corrupt and overrule the will, that it cannot choose, even that which the
judgment approves, and so unsettle us in all good courses, that we can keep
no constant tenor in them, but upon every slight occasion, all our good
resolutions are overthrown, and we quite turned out of the right way. Whereas
if these be subdued and kept (as it were) under hatches, the mind being quiet,
is able to judge uprightly, and the will to embrace that which holy reason
commends to its choice, and the work of piety prospers and proceeds
without any disturbance. And as we are thus to mortify our carnal lusts; so
we must rightly order our affections and passions, even after they are
sanctified; that they may perform their duties in due time and place, and like
servants, attend upon holy reason, that they may assist it, and not as
commanders and chief agents, go before it. For as when a right and due order
is observed in the performing Christian duties, reason being enlightened by
Gods Word and Spirit first approving them, the will, upon the commendation of
reason choosing them, and the affections and passions subiecting themselves to
the service of them both, affect and desire them, and oppose, with all their
strength, all impediments which hinder their producing into act; out of this
orderly proceeding (as in a well governed state) we become constant in all
good courses: contrariwise, when affections bear chiefest sway, and are the
first mouers unto Christian duties, reason being thrust from his throne, and
will from the council table, though we may by fits and flashes perform them,
yet doing them in a disorderly manner, not out of sound judgment rightly
informed, but out of sudden and ungrounded passions, we can never be constant
in any good course, but hot and zealous whilst the heat of passion lasts,
remiss and indifferent when this fervor abateth, and stonecold when it
cease. And this is the true cause why so many, who have been zealous
professors in their youth, become lukewarm when they come to riper years,
and wholly cold and negligent, worldly and profane in their old age; because
their Religion and devotion was but a flash of youthful passion, and not
well-grounded upon sanctified reason, and a sound and settled judgment,
convinced by the evidence of truth, and rightly informed by the Word of God.
And therefore seeing the first beginnings were disorderly and confused, it is
no marvel if the proceedings be unsettled and unconstant; and having laid so
unstable and unsure a foundation, it is no great wonder, if the whole building,
in short time, become ruinous.

. Sect. 8 That all our duties must arise from the fundamental graces of a
godly life.
The fourth rule is, that all the duties of a godly life, do not only arise
and spring from those inward and fundamental graces, saving knowledge, a
lively faith, purity of heart, a good conscience, and fervent love, as I have
already showed at large in the beginning of this Treatise, but also that they
be joined and accompanied with other Christian and internal virtues, and
principally Christian prudence, zeal and humility, without which they cannot
be acceptable unto God. Christian prudence is most necessary to the well
performing of all good duties, because it guides and directs us in all
particular actions, that they may be done aright, both in respect of the
matter, and the manner, the substance and circumstances, of which if we fail,
or of any one of them, our works, otherwise commendable, do lose all their
grace and excellency. For though they be never so good in the matter, yet if
they be done in an ill manner, and though for their substance they seem never
so glorious, yet if we fail in the circumstances, not observing due time,
place, or persons, that which is generally good in the Thesi and Theory,
cease to be so in the Hypothesi, and in respect of the particular act, as it
is done by us; neither can we safely pass through all these narrow straits and
difficult passages, unless Christian prudence sit at the Helm, and direct us
in all our courses. Besides, this prudence is necessary for the guiding and
tempering of our zeal, which is a good Soldier in the Christian warfare, but
an ill Commander, as being fit for execution, but not to give directions; and
if it be not under the conduct of prudence, it becomes blind and
preposterous, rash and wilful, like a headstrong horse, full of courage, which
being well backed, may do good service, but if he be ill managed, carries his
rider into headlong danger. But zeal, joined with prudence, is most necessary
for our well proceeding in all virtuous actions, seeing (like the spirits in
the body) it gives to our souls lively heat, whereby they are moved in the
course of godliness, and are made active in all Christian duties, laboriously
using all good means whereby they may be furthered, and courageously opposing
and removing all lets and impediments which cross us in our way. And therefore
if we would deserve the name of true Christians, we must take heed that we
incline not to that damnable error of carnal worldlings, who make zeal and
prudence flat opposites, thinking those that are most fervent, most foolish,
and with Iehu his companions, censuring them as mad fellows, that with 2.
King. 9.
any zeal perform their duty; seeing holy David, who in wisdom exceeded
Psalm. 119. 100. and 69. 9.
his teachers and ancients, was so zealous in Gods service, that scoffing
Michol condemned him of folly: yea, our Savior Christ himself, 2. Sam. 6. 20.
Col. 2. 3.
who is the Wisdom of his Father, and in whom all the treasures of wisdom
are hid, as the Apostle speaks, as he excelled all men in prudence, so also
in holy zeal, seeing he was not only thoroughly heated, but Joh. 2. 17.
even consumed in this divine flame, as he professes. Neither can true
prudence be more severed from holy zeal, then zeal from prudence, being Calor
innatus and humor primogenius sieve radicalis.
herein like the natural heat and radical moisture of the body, which
preserve mutually one another, and both faint and fail, when either
languisheth and decays. For prudence without the warmth of zeal (like frozen
waters) loses its motion in Christian duties, and (like the parts of the body,
from which the animal spirits are stopped) becomes senseless and benumbed,
falling (as it were) into a dead Palsy. Yea, if zeal do not put into it
Christian courage, it grows so wary and full of caution, that it attempteth
nothing, because in all things it foreseeth danger; and so at last degenerateth
into worldly wiliness, and irreligious policy. Finally, we must deck our
selves, and all Christian duties, with true humility, ascribing all the glory
of them unto God alone, from whom only we had power and will to do them, and
reserving nothing unto our selves but the shame of their imperfections and
corruptions, let us acknowledge that we are sufficiently rewarded, if our
frailties and infirmities be graciously pardoned. But of this also I have
spoken in the beginning of this Treatise.

. Sect. 9 That we must chiefly esteem, choose, and affect the duties of
godliness, according to their worth and excellency.
The fifth rule is, that in our judgments we esteem, in our wills choose, with
our affections desire and embrace, and in our actions practice and exercise
Christian virtues and duties, according to their worth and excellency, profit
and necessity; keeping (as much as in us lies) a due proportion between them,
in our judgments esteeming and preferring, in our wills choosing, in our
affections loving and desiring, and in our actions seeking after, and
practicing every good grace and duty in their due time and place, preferring in
our estimate, choice, desires and practice, the chief and principal virtues
and duties, before the mean, and the mean before others that are inferior
unto them. Not that we may neglect the least grace of God or Christian duty, or
so regard the greatest and most excellent, as that we dis-esteeme the least and
meanest; for as our Savior says, Whosoever breaks one of these least
Commandments, and shall teach men Mat. 5. 19.
so, he shall be called the least (that is, none at all) in the Kingdom of
heaven; but that we must, when they may all stand together, give the priority
and precedencie, in judgment, desire, and practice to the chiefest, both in
time and earnestness of endeavor, spending our first and best time, the
fervor of our zeal, and chief vigor and strength both of body and mind
about them; or if we are brought into such straights of necessity, that all
cannot be done, but some must necessarily be omitted, that then the lesser
give place to the greater, till we can get fit opportunity of performing both.
Thus we must prefer Theological virtues, as faith, affiance, hope, charity,
humility, and the fear of God before those which are humane and ciuilly
Moral, as temperance, chastity, civil justice, almsdeeds, and such like;
and generally our duties toward God, before our duties toward our neighbors
and our selves, the Commandments of the first Table, before those of the
second, a due proportion being observed, Moral duties being compared with
Moral, degree with degree, as the greatest with the greatest, middle with
middle, and least with least; more desiring, and zealously indeuouring to get
the chief graces, and perform the religious duties of Gods service, then
those which merely concern our selves or our neighbors. Thus we are more
fervently to effect, and diligently to practice Moral and substantial duties,
then those which are ceremonial and circumstanciall; yea, to reject these
latter, when both will not stand together, according to that; I will mercy and
not sacrifice; and the practice of our Savior, Hos. 6. 6.
who neglected the outward rest of the Sabbath, that he might do the works
of the Sabbath, in curing and healing the lame and diseased. The contrary
whereof, God condemns in the Jews, and rejects Esa. 1. 11, 12, 17. and 66.
1, 2, 3.
their ceremonial service, as odious and abominable, because they took
occasion thereby to neglect the Moral. And thus they offend, who spend their
chief zeal about ceremonies and circumstances of Gods service, and employ
their best strength and endeavor, either in defending or opposing them; being
in the mean time more cold and slack in the main parts of Gods service, and
the principal duties of a godly life. Thus we must prefer the service of God
it self before the means of it, and the duties of piety and charity, before
the helps which further us in them; as the doing of the Word, before hearing,
the practice of godliness, before the teaching or learning of it, when both
cannot well stand together; prayer, and the works of piety and righteousness,
before fasting and outward abstinence. In which regard, the Lord rejects Esa.
58. 3, 4, 5, 6.
the fasts of the Jews, because they preferred them before the works of
Justice and charity, neglecting these, under color of doing the other. And
thus likewise they fail, who place their Religion chiefly in hearing the Word,
in the mean time neglecting the practice of what they hear and learn, in the
duties of their callings, and in the works of Justice and mercy toward their
neighbors; herein like unto rich misers, which spend all their time and
strength in gathering riches, and when they have got them into their
possession, never care to make further use of them. But we are to know that the
end is to be preferred as more excellent, before the means that conduce unto
it. As the life is better then food and raiment; health, then the medicine;
treasure, then the pains that gets it, or the chest, lock and key that
keeps and preserves it. In which respect, the practice of religious duties
in our lives and conuersations, which is the end of our teaching and learning,
is to be preferred before either of them, and accordingly, our chief zeal and
most earnest endeavor is to be employed and spent in doing the Word, rather
then in hearing of it; though both are most necessary in their due time and
place, to all that intend to lead a Christian life. Finally, we must prefer
both in our choice and practice, internal duties of the mind and heart, before
the external and bodily service, for that is the life and soul of Religion,
this the body, and without the other but a dead carcass, which God accepts
not, nor will bring unto us any 1. Tim. 4. 8.
profit, as the Apostle teaches us. And lastly, the great and weighty matters
of the Law, as judgment, mercy, and faith, before those of small importance,
Mat. 23. 23.
as tything Mint, Annise, and Cummin; seeing our righteousness shall be
Pharisaicall and Hypocritical, if we spend our chief zeal and strength about
trifles and things of small importance, and be in the mean time cold and
slack in the maine parts of Gods service.

. Sect. 10 That we must use all helps and means which may enable us unto
godliness.
The sixth rule is, that as we desire spiritual graces, and to express them
outwardly in the duties of a godly life, so also that we use all good means
and helps whereby we may obtain the one, and practice the other. For the
means and the end do inseparably go together in all ordinary courses of
proceeding, and they who neglect the one, in vain profess either their love
and desire, or their hope, that by their idle wishes the other may be obtained.
Neither is it more possible, that we should obtain any saving graces, or
perform the duties of a godly life, if we neglect the means which enable us
unto them; then it is for a man to live without meat and drink, or come to
his iourneys end, and never travel in the way that leads unto it.
Contrariwise, with no less care and diligence we are to avoid or overcome all
lets and impediments, which stop and hinder us in our Christian course, of
which, I shall have occasion to speak at large in the following discourse.
Here let it suffice to name one or two, as examples of all the rest. First,
evil company, which will taint and infect us with the poison of their breath,
and by their evil examples and corrupt communication, will first bring us to a
neglecting, and then to a lothing and utter forsaking of all virtue and
Christian duties. Among these, we must shun with greatest care those dangerous
tame beasts, clawing flatterers, which are (as one calls them) the pestilence
of the soul, and the poysoners of good men's minds and manners. Hier. ad Celant.
For so powerful are their cunning insinuations, being assisted with our pride
and self-love, that we are ready to give more credit to their false praises,
then to the impartial testimony of our own consciences, and to think our
selves (because they say so) such proficients in all virtue Quandiu versamur in
rebus seculi, and anima nostra poss^ssionum and red^^uum procuratione deuincta
est, de D^o l^here cogitare non possumus Hier. ad Liciaium.
and godliness, that we need not further to use any means whereby we might
be bettered and improoued in our spiritual state; when as we are so far
from the mark of perfection, that we have scarcely as yet aimed at it. But
above all other impediments, let us carefully shun the immoderate love of the
world and earthly things, which will so wholly take us up, that we shall have
neither leisure, power nor will to think on spiritual and heavenly things, or
to spend any time in the duties of a godly life, or using any good means to
further our assurance of heavenly happiness. And therefore we are not to set
our hearts upon them, but to use them only as comforts of our pilgrimage; and
as steps to lift us up in divine contemplation, and to inflame our hearts with
greater love of heavenly excellencies; concluding with our selves, that if the
Lord in greatest plenty imparteth the best things the world can boast of to
his enemies; then how unspeakable are the riches, pleasures, and glory of his
own Kingdom, which he has reserved as his peculiar blessings for his own
children and faithful servants?

CAP. II.
Of the rules of a godly life, which respect the circumstances of it.

. Sect. 1 That we must make precious account of our time which God has
allotted us for his service.
ANd these are the rules which concern the causes both principal and
fundamental of a godly life, and those also which are inferior and
subordinate. Those which respect the circumstances of it, are these; First,
that we make precious account of our time which God has allotted unto us for
his service, suffering (as much as in us lies) no part thereof to be spent
vainly and unfruitfully, about those things which profit not, either for the
enriching of our souls with spiritual grace, or the furthering and assuring
of our salvation. But either we must continually be taken up with spiritual
exercises, as Prayer, Meditation, hearing the Word, Reading, holy conferences,
and such like; or in the works of our honest callings, and of justice and
mercy for the good of our brethren, or in honest and moderate recreations, that
we may be refreshed, and better enabled to perform these duties with more
fruit. To which purpose, let us often consider, that these are the main ends
for which we came into the world, and are suffered by God to live and continue
in it, and therefore that time which is not employed to advance these ends, is
spent in vain. That time is the most precious Jewel in the world, which
cannot be bought at any price, nor the least minute of it redeemed when once
it is past, with the treasures of the richest Monarchy. That we have only
assurance of the time present for our use, and cannot promise unto our selves
one month or moment of that which is to come. That our whole time were far
too little, though it were all spent in the duties of Gods service, from whom
we have received so great and manifold blessings, as pledges and pawnes of
far greater, which we assuredly expect in the life to come. That our
employments in our course of Christianity are so many and important, so full of
difficulties, and yet so necessary, as attaining to the knowledge of God and
his will, and the practice of that we know, the furnishing of our souls with
sanctifying and saving graces, and bringing forth the fruits of them in the
whole course of our lives, the making of our calling and election sure, and
getting into our own custody the assured evidences of our salvation, that if
we be wise, we will think all too little for these uses, and find none to
spare for idle and vain exercises. Let us consider, that the time which is
spent in the pleasures of sin, and pursuing of worldly vanities, brings for
the present no true profit, or sound and solid comfort, and ending at the best
in late repentance, leaves nothing behind it but grief and vexation of
spirit. That now is the acceptable time and day of salvation, which we were
best presently to take hold of, if we love our own souls, because we know
not how soon it will be past, and withal that when it is gone, it can by no
possible means be recovered. That our momentany and uncertain time being
well spent, shall be rewarded with infinite and eternal happiness; but being
idly and unprofitably wasted, shall bring upon us everlasting woe and misery.
Finally, that in this short time, heavenly happiness is either won or lost,
which shall continue beyond all times, and that damnation and hellish torments
most intolerable, and endless, are either escaped, or else procured and sealed
up unto us.

. Sect. 2 That we must not stay for occasions of Christian duties, but seek
for them before they offer themselves.
The second rule is, that we do not stay for occasions and opportunities of
performing the Christian duties of a godly life, but that we seek for them
earnestly before they offer themselves, and carefully take hold of them when we
have found them. Concerning the former, we are with our longing desires, to
prevent the occasions of well-doing before they are offered, and use all our
best endeavors to find them out when they seem to lie hid, and to pursue them
with all our speed, when they seem to flee from us. Herein imitate we the
practice of worldlings, who having set their hearts upon earthly things, do
not sluggishly stand still till they be put into their mouths, but with all
vigilancie and diligence spy out all opportunities, whereby they may atchieue
their ends, and become rich Psalm. 111. 10. Pro. 1. 7. Pro. 16. 16. Pro. 8. 12.
Job 28. 15. Pro. 2. 4.
and honorable in the world. And seeing spiritual and heavenly wisdom,
which chiefly consists in true godliness, is much better then riches and
worldly honors, according to that of the Wiseman; How much better is it to get
wisdom then gold? and of greater price, and more to be desired then precious
stones, or any worldly thing besides; therefore we must seek it as silver, and
search for it as for hid treasures; and being (as Pro. 4. 7. Eccle. 12. 13.
he teaches us) the principal thing and chief end of all, we must labor to
get it with all our gettings; that is, make it our chief business to attain
unto it; according to the example of the wise Merchant, who having by Matthew.
13. 44.
diligent search found the hid treasure, never rests till he has made
himself owner of it, and gotten it sure in his own possession. Neither is it
sufficient with all diligence to seek for all opportunities of godliness, but
when we have found them, we must with all speed lay hold of them, and not
suffer them to slip from us through our careless delays. And first, when God
offers unto us opportunity and means of serving him in the duties of a godly
life, calling and exhorting us unto them in the Ministry of his Word, and
encouraging to embrace them, by offering unto us the gracious assistance of his
holy Spirit, we must in this very day hearken unto his voice, and not harden
our hearts; when he inuiteth us to his Supper, we Psalm. 95. 7, 7. Luke. 14. 16.
must not pretend excuses, and put him off with delays, and whilst he
knocks at the door of our hearts, by the sound of his Word and finger of his
Spirit, we must open unto him, that he may come in and feast us Apoc. 3. 20.
with a banquet of his spiritual graces. Whilst he calls us to repentance,
Act. 17. 30. 2. Cor. 6. 2.
and offreth unto us the means which formerly have been denied, let us
hearken and turn unto him, whilst the acceptable time and day of salvation
lasts. For it is but a day, and nor an age, and when the Sunneshine of the
Gospel sets, and the night of ignorance and superstition comes, there will
be no time of working. Now our Bridegroom calls and knocks, and if we open
unto him, we shall solace our selves in Cant. 5. 2, 3, 4.
our sweet communion with him, and the fruition of his love. But if with the
sluggish Spouse we pretend excuses, and will not let him in, he will withdraw
himself, and then we may long seek him, before we shall find him. Now
wisdom cries out unto us in our streets, and happy are we Pro. 1. 24. 25, 26
27, 28.
if we hearken to her voice; for if we now stop our ears to her call, we
shall in the day of our affliction, cry and call, and not be heard, as the Lord
Zach. 7. 11, 12.
threatens.

. Sect. 3 That we must set our selves most seriously about Christian duties,
when we find our selves best prepared and fitted for them.
Secondly, when we find our selves best fitted and prepared for the performing
of holy and religious duties, the Spirit of God disposing us unto them, by
enlarging our hearts, and inflaming us with the love of spiritual exercises,
by the sweet taste and comfortable feelings which we find in them, we are not
to let slip this opportunity, but entertaining these good motions, and
nourishing in us these spiritual inclinations, we must set our selves
seriously about them. As when the Lord calls us in the Ministry of the Word,
and thereby awakeneth us out of the sleep of sin, we must be ready to say
with Samuel, Speak, Lord, for thy servant hears. When 1. Sam. 3. 10.
the Lord boreth the ear and opens our hearts, we must with Lydia, attend
Act. 16. 14, 15.
unto the things that are spoken, embrace them by faith, and bring forth the
fruits of it in the works of love. When he powers upon us the spirit Zach.
12. 10, 12, 13.
of grace and supplication, we must retire our selves apart into our Closets,
and power forth our souls and suites before him by fervent prayer. When our
hearts (like David's) are with meditating upon Gods manifold mercies, and the
sweet taste of his inestimable benefits duly prepared, we must not lose this
opportunity by delays, but presently with him sing and Psalm. 108. 1.
give praise. When God has given unto us ability to perform spiritual
duties, whereby we may mutually further the salvation of one another, and put
also some zeal into our hearts, whereby we are disposed unto them, let us make
no delays, but exhort one another daily, whilst it is called to day, Heb. 3.
13.
lest any be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. Finally, if God has
put power into our hands, and some pity and charity into our hearts, whereby
we are enabled and moved to do the works of mercy, we are to lay hold upon
these opportunities, and not hazard the losing of them by our slothful
delays; according to the counsel of wise Solomon; Withhold Pro. 3. 27, 28.
not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to
do it; Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will
give, when thou have it by thee. For if we neglect our opportunity when God
offers it, he may justly deny it us when we would have it; or if it still
continue, he may withdraw his grace more and more, which we have neglectfully
abused, and so give us up to our own hardness of heart, to go forward and
increase in our former neglect. Finally, seeing our hearts are deceitful,
fickle, and flitting, and we have them not so at command that we can keep them
close unto good duties, or preserve in them at our pleasure the fire of
devotion, it would be our wisdom to take them in their good mood, and to lay
hold of the opportunity, for the performing of holy duties, as Prayer,
Meditation, renewing of our Repentance, and such like, when we find and feel
them best affected toward them; and when we discern that they are well
warmed with the fire of Gods Spirit, we are to stir it up, and (as it were)
to blow it more and more, giving unto it vent in our holy actions, that it may
not be choked and smothered. For if we do not take them at this advantage,
they will slip away, and the heat of our zeal and devotion growing cool in
us, we shall become unfit for any religious duties, and as unable to work our
hearts to any frame of godliness, as to fashion the iron to a new figure and
form, when the fire is extinguished, and the heat gone out of it.

. Sect. 4 That we must observe an order in doing these duties, and avoid
confusion.
The last rule, respecting the circumstances of a godly life, is, (which I have
already in part touched) that for the avoiding of confusion and vnsettlednesse
in our course of Christianity, we do not confound and intermingle duties one
with another, but that we, upon good advice and mature deliberation, propound
unto our selves some good order in the doing of them, allotting unto every
hour and part of the day, some special duties to be ordinarily performed in
them: As such, and so much time for Prayer, Meditation, Reading, and other
religious exercises; such, and so much for the duties of our callings,
recreations, and civil employments; for sleeping, waking, rising, going to
bed, eating and drinking, conferring, and the like. The which, howsoever we may
not superstitiously tie our selves unto for conscience sake, because God has
left the fitting of all times and occasions to our Christian liberty and to
spiritual wisdom, as shall be most agreeable and profitable for us in our
several places and callings; yet for order sake, and to avoid confusion,
inconstancy and utter neglect of good duties; after that upon sound advice we
have set down a good order and method for our proceeding in Christian duties,
and what time is ordinarily to be spent in them, we are not easily and upon
every slight cause to alter our course, but to keep our selves, as near as we
can, unto it, unless either necessity, charity, or some unlooked for
opportunity of better and more profitable employment, offering it self unto
us, do move us in Christian wisdom and discretion, at some times to vary
from our common course of proceeding. And this we shall find profitable, not
only to avoid disorder and confusion, but also to settle our hearts in a
constant practice of all good duties, which otherwise naturally affecting
variety, novelties, and often changes in religious exercises, by reason of that
saciety and carnal lothing which they bring to our corrupt nature, would every
hand while be flitting and starting, sometimes performing them in a confused
manner, and sometimes neglecting them altogether.

CAP. III.
Of the rules of a godly life, respecting the matter, form and substance of it.

. Sect. 1 That we can no otherwise aspire to perfection in Christian duties,
then by proceeding by degrees.
THe rules of a godly life which respect the matter, form and substance of it,
come now to be entreated of. The first whereof is this, that we aspire unto
perfection by degrees, and not dream or imagine, that we can the first day,
and in the beginning of our conversion attain unto it. For howsoever the Lord
is not tied to times and means, but can as soon, and as well perfect the
work of our Regeneration, as he did the work of our Creation, wherein he did
but say the word, and it was done; and howsoever sometimes, to show the
absoluteness and greatness of his wisdom, power and goodness, he makes
quick dispatch of his great work of grace, and causes some to attain unto a
great measure of perfection, by the extraordinary assistance of his holy
Spirit, especially such as are converted in their latter times, and having long
loytered, are cast behind hand, and have much way to travel, and work to
finish, in the very evening of their lives; and some others also whom he
sanctifies from their Esa. 49. 1, 5.
birth and tender youth, to be his greatest lights shining in his Church: yet
this is not usual in Gods ordinary course of proceeding, nor much more to be
expected of us, then that we should have the stature and strength of men as
soon as we are borne, unto which we ordinarily attain by degrees, because we
were at once made perfect and complete in the extraordinary work of our
Creation. Besides, we have all true saving graces according to the measure and
proportion of faith, unto which we cannot at once ordinarily attain in any
great perfection, both because it self also must hold some proportion with our
knowledge, which is not Heb. 11. 6.
suddenly attained, as soon as we are converted, unless we had it before; and
also because faith (as we have showed) increases by degrees, and we cannot
attain unto any great measure and fullness of persuasion, but by much exercise
in holy duties, and great experience of Gods love and goodness toward us. We
must not then, in the childhood of our Christianity, think that we can attain
unto the perfection of old men in Christ, and so accordingly in our words and
profession, after a glorious manner take upon us; but we must be content, with
the Apostle, whilst 1. Cor. 13. 10, 11.
we are children, to do and speak as children, and when we become men, to
put away childish things. We must not think, when we are first bound to this
spiritual trade, that we can learn and practice it in any perfection the
first year; when as seven years are thought little enough for manual trades,
which are not so difficult to flesh and blood. No liberal Art is gotten
without much pains and study, and many years are required, before we can be
any great proficients in any of the chief professions, Divinity, Law, or
Physic: and shall we think that Christianity, which is the highest and
hardest of all, can be attained unto in any perfection, without much study,
practice, and experience? It is not possible. Well may we deceive our selves
with shows and shadows, and deceive others with outward flourishes of a
glorious profession; but we cannot otherwise attain unto any perfection in
substantial practice, but by degrees; and as possible it is at one leap to
mount to the top of an high ladder, which others climb step by step; as to
come to the top and perfection of Christianity, unless we proceed from one
degree to another. If we would be wise builders, we must not think that we can
in the very beginning set up the roof, and adorn the house within, that it
may be fit for habitation; but we must finish our work by degrees, and after
we have provided store of materials, holy desires and good resolutions, we
must spend much time and pains in laying a sound and sure foundation, large
and deep, which (being as it were under ground) makes no great show to our
selves or others; even that foundation of which the Apostle speaks,
repentance from dead works, faith toward God, and the knowledge of Heb. 6. 1,
2.
the principles of Christian Religion.

. Sect. 2 Of the degrees by which we must aspire to perfection.
First, we must see and feel our misery, both in respect of sin and
punishment, in the looking glass of the Law, wherewith being thoroughly humbled,
and utterly denying our selves in the work of salvation, we must flee unto
Christ, hungring and thirsting after him and his righteousness, and then apply
him unto our selves by a true faith, the which at the first (like the hand of
an Infant) is weak in apprehension, but by degrees comes to more strength.
And if we proceed not by these steps, we build upon a false or sandy
foundation, and our building in short time, seem it never so stately, will
become ruinous; and our faith which at the beginning is in our conceit a full
persuasion, will by our fearful relapse, when we come to be tried by the
winds and floods of tentation, show that it was, at the best, but carnal
presumption. If we would approve our selves to be good grounds, after we have
received the seed of the Word into good and honest hearts, we must keep it,
till it have taken fast rooting in us, and bring forth fruit with patience; and
not like those that are compared to the stony grounds, who incontinently as
soon as the Math. 13. 5.
seed is sown, without any prick of conscience, or sound humiliation for sin
going before, do receive the Word with joy, and forthwith bringforth Luke 8.
13, 15.
a green blade of a flourishing profession, which for want of root never
comes to bring forth fruit, but withers as soon as the sun of
persecution arises. We must not be like meteors, which soon after their first
beginnings make the greatest show; nor like a fire of thorns, which as soon
as it is kindled, gives the fairest blaze, and makes the most noise and
crackling; both which decrease by little and little, till they disappeare and
be wholly extinguished; but like the morning light, which shines Pro. 4. 18.
more and more unto perfect day. We must not be like mushromes, which come to
their perfection in one nights growth; but trees of righteousness of Gods
planting, which are still in growth, and bring forth most Psalm. 92. 14.
fruit in old age. We must not resemble Summer-fruits, which are soon ripe,
and soon rotten, and best of taste when they are first gathered; but winter
fruits and long lasters, which are a great while in coming to their
perfection, and relish best, and give wholesomest nourishment in their latter
end. We must be like Infants in the womb, which stay their time and come to
their growth by degrees, and not, by making more have then good speed, prove
abortiue births; for as in nature there is a growth by degrees, from the least
to the greatest perfection, both in respect of the body and mind, from which
common course of nature our Savior Christ himself was not exempted, who is
said to have increased in wisdom and Luke 2. 52.
stature, and in favor with God and man: so in our spiritual growth, we
cannot attain to the pitch of perfection in our first beginnings, but being
then little children and weaklings in grace and goodness, we grow from
knowledge to knowledge, from faith to faith, and from one degree of grace to
another, unto a perfect man, and unto the measure of the stature of the
fullness of Christ. Whereof it is that one of the Ancients says; I would Ephesians.
4. 13. Nolo repent fieri summus; paulatim proficere volo, etc. Bernard in
Cantic.
not upon the sudden attain to my highest pitch, but grow toward it by little
and little. For look how much the rash impudency of sinners displeases God,
and so much he is pleased with the modesty of the penitent. And therefore let
us not nourish in us this fond conceit, that we either have already, or may in
our first entrance into the course of Christianity, attain any great
perfection, unto which others scarcely aspire, after great pains, and long
time spent in spiritual exercises; for this will but puff us up with pride,
and make us ready to despise and censure others which were in Christ long
before us, whom we seem to our selves to have outrun, whereby we shall move
the Lord to deny his grace, which being withdrawn, we shall by some fearful
fall discover our weakness. It will make us rest in that which we have, as
though it were sufficient, and not to labor and strive after more perfection,
and so keep us from being something, by pleasing our selves in our own
nothing; seeing all the seeming perfection unto which we have attained, is not
grounded upon fauing knowledge, a lively faith, and a sound judgment, but a
sudden flash of unconstant passion, and has in it no substance and solidity,
but is like an empty bladder, which is suddenly blown up with the wind of
pride. Or finally, if we be awakened out of our dream, and upon serious
examination find how far short we come of our account, we are ready to sit
down discouraged, despairing of coming to any perfection, seeing we have
scarce attained to the first degrees of it.

. Sect. 3 That we must fit our burden according to our strength.
The second rule is, in the exercise of Christian duties, that we fit our
burden to our strength, so as we may be able to perform them in sincerity and
truth, yea with cheerfulness and delight, and not oppress our selves with an
unsupportable weight, by taking upon us more then we are able to bear. In
which respect many offend, especially young professors, who being children in
Christ, and endued but with a small measure of the gifts and graces of Gods
Spirit, do seek to match and exceed those who are come to a ripe age, and to
a great measure of perfection, in all outward duties of Religion and a godly
life. As for example; because these being endued with a great measure of
knowledge and grace, besides excellent gifts of nature, and both much helped
and perfected with long practice and experience, are able, according to all
occasions, to conceive prayers, and to continue in them with perseverance,
pouring forth their souls with great freedom and liberty of speech and
spirit, words coming at will, and not being any stop, in inuenting of them
unto their devotion and feruency of affection, but like streams from the
fountain, flow freely and kindly from them: therefore they also, wanting
knowledge and the spirit of supplication in any good measure, do
notwithstanding tie themselves to the same task, and not only contemning all
forms, impose a necessity upon themselves of conceiving all their prayers upon
the sudden; but also of continuing and holding out as long a time in this
exercise, as those that have been longest practiced in it. Upon which it must
necessarily follow, that their devotion and affection must be much cooled and
distracted, when as the powers of their soul are taken up wholly with
invention of words and matter; and that through ignorance and want of gifts,
many things will be impertinent, the same things often repeated, because new
matter comes not to mind, many imperfect, and scarce sensible speeches,
without any order or coherence uttered, to make up the breach, where knowledge,
invention and memory have failed them. Others seeing some great proficients in
godliness, and long exercised in mortification, strict in their courses,
denying the world with all unlawful pleasures, subduing their flesh with
moderate fasting and abstinence, and such like spiritual exercises, they also,
though but newly entered into the profession of Religion, will not only labor
to imitate, but exceed and go beyond them, though not in inward truth and
spiritual duty, yet at least in bodily exercise and outvvard show. If they
abstain from unlawful pleasures, these will restrain themselves of those
which are lavvfull. If they be moderate in their honest recreations, these
will not use any at all. If they subdue the flesh with fasting, that they may
be more fit for prayer, and other parts of Gods service, these will pine their
bodies, and so impair their health and strength, that they are made unfit to
perform any Christian duties with any cheerfulness. If they avoid immoderate
mirth, carnal joy, and scurrilous jests, these will scarce admit a smile, and
place much of their Religion in continual mourning, in a sorrowful and
dejected countenance, and in an austere carriage of themselves in all
companies, not knowing, that as there is a time for mourning, so also for
rejoicing; that Christian joy beseems none but Christians, seeing they Psalm.
33. 1. Phil. 4. 4.
only have interest and right in the causes of it, and that we may, yea ought
to rejoice in the Lord with a double joy. Finally, they content not themselves
to match in these outward shows and bodily exercises, those who far excel
them in inward graces, nor to overtake those who have set out long before them
in the race of Christianity, unless they quite outstrip them, and leave them
far behind. The which must needs proceed either from spiritual pride, which
makes them ouerweene their gifts, and to think their strength fit for the
hardest task; or from hypocrisy, which makes them to supply, in outward
shows, what is wanting in inward substance, or at best, from blind zeal,
which transporteth them beyond themselves and their abilities in a flash of
passion. But if we mean to hold on a constant course in Christianity, we must
avoid this practice, and being truly humbled in the sight and sense of our own
frailty and weakness, let us so begin, as we may continue, and hold out to
the end, with daily increase in all grace and goodness. Let us so be careful
to tame the flesh with due and seasonable severity, as that we do not impair
our health, disable our bodies to the service of God, nor deprive our souls of
all comfort, whereby they are made cheerful in all Christian duties. Let our
zeal carry us as far and fast as it will, but let it not ouer-carry us beyond
all bounds of spiritual wisdom and discretion. Let us not rashly undertake a
task, before we have examined our strength, whether it be sufficient for it;
and ere we cast the burden upon our shoulders, let us poyze and weigh it, that
we may know whether we shall be able to continue under it without fainting,
till we come to the end of our journey. Finally, let us so labor to bring our
outward man to conformity in bodily exercises and external duties, with those
which are greatest proficients in Christianity, as that we do not forget to
spend our greatest pains and strength in mortifying our sinful lusts; as
pride, covetousness, rash anger, malice, envy, uncharitableness, and the rest;
and not only to adorn our souls inwardly with all sanctifying graces, love,
humility, patience, zeal, and such like, but also to approve the truth and
sincerity of them by our works of piety, righteousness and mercy toward the
afflicted members of Jesus Christ. For to neglect these, and to be strict in
outward shows and bodily exercises, is (as it were) to bestow much cost upon
the outside of the house, and to let the inside lie full of rubbish; to deck
the body, and neglect the soul and life of Religion, which consists chiefly
in inward graces, and the practice of them in the maine duties of holiness and
righteousness; to esteem the shell more then the kernel, Math. 23. Quid
prodest quod affligis corpus tuum, quando nihil proficit cor tuum? Ieiunare and
rigitare, and mores non corrigere. Eusebius. Emissen. ad Monach. Hom. 4
and to make our selves (as our Savior compares such) like unto painted
sepulchers, which are outwardly trimmed, and gorgeously gilded and painted, but
within, full of rottenness and putrefaction. What does it profit (says one)
that thou afflictst thy body, when as thine heart is never the better? To fast,
and watch, and not to mend thy manners, is as if a man should bestow great
pains without the Vineyard, in weeding and manuring, but leave the Vineyard it
self neglected and unhusbanded, and fit for nothing but to bring forth thorns
and thistles.

. Sect. 4 That we must exercise our selves in the duties of a godly life,
according to the measure of grace received.
To which purpose let us consider, that the Scriptures require, that we should
exercise our selves in the duties of a godly life, according to the measure of
grace given us, and not in such things as are above our reach and strength.
They do not command that we should torture our devotion, by setting it upon
the rack, and undertaking things above our ability, but that our service of
God should be a free will offering, and performed with cheerfulnes and delight:
not that Christians should be all of one size and spiritual growth, and
perform their duty in equal perfection; but that we perform that which we
are able, in sincerity and truth, according to the measure of the gift of grace
received, and that we should grow up by degrees unto a perfect age in Christ.
So the Wise man wills Eccles. 7. 16, 57.
us, not to be righteous and wise overmuch; whereby he means, not only a
righteousness and wisdom of our own framing and fancying, which is contrary
to the Word of God; for so it is not lawful, not only overmuch, but not at
all to be wise and righteous; but that we do not take upon us more outward
show and semblance of wisdom and righteousness, then our inward substance of
grace will bear out in sincerity and truth; or such a degree of it as is quite
above our reach and strength. To which purpose the Apostle speaks and
exhorts, that no Romans 12. 3.
man should think of himself more highly then he ought to think; but to
think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.
And this is that which our Savior means, (when excusing his Disciples for
not fasting like the Pharisees, he says, that no man puts a new piece of
cloth into Mat. 9. 16, 17.
an old garment, nor new wine into old bottles:) namely, that there is no
wisdom to impose strict and hard exercises upon young beginners and tender
weaklings in faith, seeing it is the next way to discourage them quite in their
good proceedings, and to bring all to naught. For when the duties which they
undertake exceed their strength, and the measure of their faith and inward
grace, having no internal virtue to support themselves, they grow presently
faint and weary both of their practice and profession. When they have put
themselves into an unpleasing prison, they are never well till they have broke
out, taking their liberty even unto licentiousness. Displicent mihi in ^eneris
maxim immoderata ieiunia, etc. Hieron. ad Laetam. P^r^^s cibus and venture
s^mper esu ^ens, tridua nis ie^u^ijs praefertur. ad Puriam.
When in the course of Christianity they have ouer-loaded themselves, they are
soon tired, and cast off their burden in the midway. When in running the
spiritual race they strive and strain themselves at their first setting out,
even above their strength, they are presently out of breath, and giving over
the race, leave the goal and garland unto those who wisely fit their pace to
their power and actiuity, so as they may hold out unto the end. In which regard
one of the Ancients (otherwise strict enough) professes, that immoderate
fastings, especially in weaklings, did much displease him, because he had
learned by experience, that an Ass wearied in his way, is ready to seek many
turnings. And prefers sparing and sober diet, and a stomach always
retaining an appetite, before fasts of three days continuance.

. Sect. 5 That they who undertake matters above their strength, cannot do them
in sincerity, but in show only.
Again, for small proficients in Christianity, to tie themselves unto the same
exercises, which are performed by those that have attained to greatest
perfection, both in respect of matter and manner, measure and degree, what is
it, but as if a child should travel in a man's shoes? what is it, but to bring
the exercises of Religion unto a fashion, of which, every one must be, who will
be in any esteem? what is it, but to fit all bodies with the same garment, and
to make all Christians of one size and stature, leaving no distinction of
childhood and riper age? And what do they who thus do, but open a gap to
gross hypocrisy, and shut sincerity out of doors? For how can we be sincere,
when we have no measure of inward 2. Cor. 9. 7.
grace in any proportion answerable to the show of our outward duties? or how
can we perform service unto God in them, heartily and cheerfully as he
requires, when as wanting a support of inward gifts, we toil our selves above
our strength? Finally, how can we think that to exercise our selves in things
above our power and reach, is to take upon us Christ's yoke and burden, and not
rather such as are of our own making and imposing, seeing he has taught us,
that his yoke is easy, and burden light, bringing quiet rest unto our souls,
and not an intolerable weight, Mat. 11. 29.
which pressing us down and vexing us, makes our lives unpleasant unto us,
and our hearts never at ease until we have again cast them off? Rather let
us imitate the example of David, who having an humble conceit of himself and
his own gifts, even like a child new weaned, kept Psalm. 131. 1, 2.
himself quietly within his compass, and did not exercise himself in great
matters, or in things too high for him. To which purpose, let us observe these
two rules; first, that we do not set forth all that we do gloriously to
the show, but always so order the matter, that our practice of Christian
duties do not come short, but always exceed our outward profession, and that
we be more holy and religious in truth, then we desire to be in outward
appearance. For nothing makes men so forward to undertake great matters which
are above their strength, as a desire to gain a greater esteem of their
inward gifts and outward duties in the sight of men, then they any ways
deserve in their true worth. Secondly, in the undertaking of any exercise of
godliness, let it be our care, that we have a sufficient measure of inward
grace and spiritual strength to support us, that we may continue constant in
it unto the end. For if the fountain be not sufficient to nourish the
streams, they will soon grow dry; whereas if it be full, they will
plentifully flow of their own accord. If we have not an inward stock of
grace to maintain our expenses in outward and bodily exercises, all quickly
will be spent and consumed, and we shall become beggars and bankrupts in all
grace and goodness. And unto this our Savior advises us in the parable of
the wise builder, who intending to erect a Tower, sat down first and Luke 14.
28, 29.
counted the cost whether he had sufficient to finish it, lest happly after
he had laid the foundation, and not being able to finish it, all that beheld
it, should begin to mock him, etc.

. Sect. 6 That we must not undertake too many things at once.
The third rule is, that we do not cumber our selves with too many businesses
at once, but that we orderly proceed from one duty to another, not undertaking
a new employment, till we have brought that which we had first in hand, to some
good effect. For as nature intends not many things at once, because being of
finite virtue and operation, it cannot compass and atchieue them all together,
but unites all its forces and vigor, that it may perfect that at which it
chiefly aymeth: so upon the same reason, grace follows the same course, and
because our understanding is but of small capacity and extent, and cannot
without confusion comprehend many things at the same time; and our wills weak
and unable to make sound and good choice, when as they are troubled with
confused variety of many objects, and the zeal and ardency of our affections
much weakened and cooled, when as they are distracted and divided between many
things desirable; and finally, the wit dulled, the spirits spent, and the body
tired, when as they are exercised about more employments, then by their virtue
and vigor they can atchieue; therefore it chooses this as the best course, to
do one thing after another, and undertaking the best and most necessary duties
in the first place, not to think of or affect another, until that be brought
unto some perfection. For as the fire lying together gives great heat, but
being scattered abroad, soon goes out; and the River running in the same
current, is of such force that nothing can stop it, but being divided into many
little streams and riuelets, becomes weak, and of little strength: so, if
the fire of our zeal be united about one object or Christian duty, it will
be able to atchieue it with great feruencie, and the stream of our devotion,
running wholly in one course and current, will be of such force, that nothing
shall be able to divert or hinder it; but let them be scattered and divided
about multitudes of employments at the same time, and their heat will be
abated, and their strength so weakened, that they will not be able to bring any
one good duty to any reasonable perfection.

. Sect. 7 That we must not busy our selves in other men's matters.
The fourth rule is, that we be not busy and curious in prying into the
lives of other men, and spying out their infirmities; nor strict and severe in
censuring and condemning their faults and imperfections, when we have taken
notice of them. For he that undertakes much business abroad, must of
necessity neglect his own at home; he that is curious in searching and
examining other men's manners, will find no time to look into his own. The
which we see daily verified by woeful and lamentable experience in many
Professors of these times, who spend all their zeal in censuring of others,
and in exclaiming against the corruptions of the times, the disorders in the
Commonwealth, the faults of Governors Civil and Ecclesiastical, the defects
and blemishes of the Church, and in the mean time are cold and negligent in
searching out their own sins, in reforming their own manners, and in the
duties of sanctification, and of a godly life. The which, is oftentimes done,
not so much out of a true mislike and hatred of others vices and corruptions
(for then they would make speed to pursue Nulli nunquam omnino detrahas, nec
aliorum vituperatione te laudabilem videri velis. Magisque vitam tuam ordinare
disce, quam alienam carpere. Hyer. ad ^elant.
and subdue them with greater detestation in themselves, out of a feeling
experience of the manifold evils which they bring upon them) but to magnify
their own zeal, which will not suffer them with any patience to tolerate
such faults and corruptions, to disguise and hide their own vices, under this
show of misliking others sins, and to commend themselves, and get the name of
forward Christians, by dispraising those who come far behind them in outward
show. But if we would make any good progress in the ways of godliness, we
must be more diligent in reforming our own lives, then in censuring other
men's; and in using all good means, which may furnish us with saving graces,
and further us in all good duties, then in spying out how far others come
short in them, and in censuring them for these defects. For as it is not the
way of thriuing in our worldly estate, to sit still and exclaim against others
ill husbandry, but diligently to follow our own business; so it is no course
to grow richer in grace, and in the fruits of godliness, to censure and
inueigh against others, as vnthriuing Christians; but carefully to look unto
our own estate, and to use all good means whereby we may better it. Yea in
truth, this supercilious pride, in ouer-weaning our own gifts, and censuring
and condemning other men's defects, moves the Lord oftentimes, to withdraw
from us those graces and good parts which we seem to have, whereby we are
disabled, either in substance or show to proceed in any Christian course, and
oftentimes overtaken with some foul sins, to the end, that being humbled in
the sight of our own frailty, we may become the more charitable toward
others, and ceasing to pry into their infirmities, we may with all our
endeavor, seek to amend our own lives.

. Sect. 8 That we must take heed, lest daily use of Christian duties make us
cold and formal in them.
The fifth rule is, that we carefully take heed, that through the daily use of
Christian and religious duties, they do not become cold and formal, and
performed, rather for custom then conscience sake, doing them still, because
we have long done them, rather then out of a lively sense of their profit and
necessity; like those who go to feed, not because they have any appetite to
their meat, but because it is dinner time; and betake themselves to rest, not
in regard that they find themselves sleepy, but because their ordinary time is
come of going to bed. But let the same causes which moved us first to
undertake them, move us still to continue in them, namely, the love of God,
and obedience to his Commandments; an earnest desire to glorify him, by doing
the duties of his service, and so to carry our selves, as that we may please
him in all things, and have both our persons and actions accepted of him, that
we may hereby adorn our profession, edify our brethren by our good example,
be more and more enriched with all sanctifying and saving graces, strengthened
to all good duties, and so more and more assured of our own salvation. For if
we be not still moved by these causes and considerations, to perform the
duties of Gods service; but do them in an ordinary course, and never think
why, nor to what end, we shall soon grow cold and formal, serving God after
such careless and negligent manner, as that neither we nor our service shall
be accepted of him.

The sixth rule is, that with all care and watchfulness, we preserve our
zeal and devotion in holy duties in their full strength, and not suffer them
to decline in any part of their heat and feruency, seeing as in all things
that are good, declinations are dangerous, so most of all in spiritual graces
and holy duties, which being no natural habits, but continually opposed by our
inbred corruption, and the malicious fury of all our spiritual enemies,
declinations in them do speedily bring us to headlong ruin, the least
remissions causing intermissions, and these total neglect and utter defection.
An example whereof we have in the Church of Ephesus, who falling from her
first love, that is, remitting Apoc. 2. 4, 5.
some degrees of the fervor and zeal of her affection, and not repenting of
it, when by Christ she was admonished, stayed not in this first degree of
declination (for who can stay himself that is going down the hill, who
besides his own natural pronenesse to go on, has so many malicious enemies
at his back to thrust him forward?) but from one degree to another, fell
within a while to utter Apostacy. Neither must it in our declinations give us
any comfort, that we still retain some parts and remainders of our former
goodness; for as no man can rise to any height of perfection, but by degrees;
so neither any that has had any shows of goodness, though merely civil,
can at the very first become extremely evil, but by degrees declineth, till at
last he comes to the height of wickedness. And as a small chinke in a ship
does not at first let in water enough to sink it, if it be carefully looked
to, and the water pumped out as fast as it comes in; but if it be neglected,
from a little rift, grows at last to a desperate leake: so our small slips
will not sink our souls into the gulf of perdition, if they be quickly
espied, and carefully repented of and amended; but if we continue in them with
careless neglect, they will enlarge themselves, and increase from one degree
to another, till they come to a full height of desperate wickedness. The same
care and providence therefore which we take for our bodies, let us also take
for our souls, using wholesome spiritual food and diet, to preserve them in
their perfect health and strength; or if we so much as fear any declinations,
let us withstand the first beginnings with timely Physic, seeing small and
scarce sensible remissions, will by degrees bring us into deep consumptions of
all grace and goodness. And as we find it necessary for the preserving of
water in its full heat, to keep a good fire still under it, because it is not
a natural property of it, and therefore if it be not preserved by the same
means by which it was first caused, it will within a while grow lukewarm, and
soon after stone-cold; and as the fire it self will continue no longer
burning then we put fuel unto it, because it is not in its proper element,
but will slake and abate by degrees, until at last it vanish into air, and
leave nothing behind it but cold ashes: so our zeal and devotion in holy
duties, being supernatural gifts and qualities, contrary to corrupted nature,
and being spiritual, and of an heavenly nature, when they be in us, who are
earthly and sensual (as it were) out of their own proper place and element,
they will not continue, if we nourish them not by the same means by which
they were bred, adding daily unto them new fuel to preserve their heat, but
will soon grow remiss, and quickly after soon cold. And as they, so also
their motions in the duties of godliness, not being natural, if they be not
followed with a continued strength, by which at first they were made to move,
they will, like the unnatural motion, be violent in the beginning, slack and
slow in the middle, and in the latter end faint, and utterly desist. The which
we have seen often verified, by the too lamentable experience of many
professors in our days, who having been forward and fervent in their youth,
by remitting some degrees of their zeal, and through the tentations of the
world fawning or frowning upon them, become more slack and slothful in
religious duties (resting in a formal fashion, and in the outward act; without
any quickening power, or internal life of zeal and devotion) have declined in
their riper years to a loathsome lukewarmenesse, and to dead and desperate
coldness, worldliness, and profaneness in their old age.

CAP. IIII.
That we must not content our selves with a small measure of grace, but labor
to grow unto perfection.

. Sect. 1 That the Scriptures require this growth in grace, from the least
degrees to the greatest.
THe last rule of direction for the leading of a godly life is, that we
content not our selves with that small measure of grace which we have
received, nor rest in those duties which we have already performed, but that
we labor to grow daily, and increase in grace, and in the Christian practice
of a godly life. For as in nature, things stand not at a stay, but as weary of
the state of imperfection, tend to perfection, gro(...)p therein from one
degree to another, till they come to the high (...) as the grain of come
taking root in the earth, shoots up into (...)ade, and then grows to have
an ear, and so ripening, multiplyeth it self in its kind; and the little
kernel springs first into a small shute, and then grows by degrees to a
flourishing and fruitful tree; and man himself conceived of a little
excrementall matter, grows first in the womb, by degrees to a perfect shape
in all the parts and lineaments of a true humane body; and then after the
birth, from childhood to youth, and from thence to ripe age and full stature)
so the growth of grace proceeds from imperfection, to one degree of
perfection after another, until we come unto a perfect age in Christ. And as
sick men newly recovered, cannot rest contented that they live, but long after
their wonted strength, desiring first to sit up, and when they can do this,
are not satisfied, but desire ability to walk, and to recover their stomach
and appetite, and then to go abroad, and not so content, wish to be freed
from faintness, to be restored to their former good habitude, plight, and
liking, and in a word, are never quiet in their desires, till they have
recovered their perfect health: so we, having been sick in sin unto the
death, after we are revived and quickened by Gods Spirit, do not content our
selves with some first degrees of spiritual life, and beginnings of health
and strength, but long and labor by all good means, that we may daily
increase in them, until we attain unto them in full perfection. And this
growth in grace, and in the practice of all holy duties is commended unto us,
both by testimonies and examples. The Apostle would have us to be no more Ephesians.
4. 13.
children, but to grow up unto him which is the Head, even Christ. And
beseeches and exhorts the Thessalonians, not only to continue constant in
the ways of holiness, and to please God, but that they would abound 1. These.
4. 1, 10.
more and more. And the Apostle Peter requires, not only that we should
continue steadfast, but that we should grow in grace, and in the 2. Pet. 3. 17,
18.
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. To which purpose, Austine thus advises;
Let that which thou art, always displease thee, that so thou may Semper
tibi displiceat quod es, sivis peruenire ad id quod nondum es, etc. De verb.
Apostoli. Hyer. in Eccles.
come to that which thou art not. For where thou have pleased thy self, there
thou stayest. And if thou once come to say, I have enough, thou art undone.
And another persuades us so to live, that always the present days may be
better then those which are past, lest beginning to decline by little and
little, it be at length said unto us, Ye did run well, who hindered you,
that you should not obey the truth? A notable example hereof we have in the
Apostle, who when he had long run in the Christian Race, and outrunne all
others that set out long before him, yet forgot those Phil. 3. 13, 14.
things which were behind, and reached forth to those things which were
before, and still pressed toward the mark, for the price of the high calling
of God in Jesus Christ. And in the Church of Thyatira, who has this
commendation, not only that they excelled in good works, charity, service,
faith, patience, but also Apoc. 2. 19.
that their last works were more then their first. The contrary whereof, the
Apostle reproves in the Hebrews, namely, that when for the time, they ought
Heb. 5. 12.
to have been teachers, they had need to be taught themselves the first
principles of the Oracles of God, and were become such, as had need of milk,
and not of strong meat. And our Savior condemns it in the Church of
Ephesus, that she Apoc. 2. 14. and 3. 2.
had fallen from her first love. And in the Church of Sardis, of whom he says,
that he had not found her works perfect before God, that is, tending and
growing toward perfection. Neither must we be content with some degrees of
spiritual growth, but we must propound unto our selves the mark of
perfection, unto which, because we cannot attain in this life, therefore we
must put no end here to our labor and endeavor, but strive daily to come
nearer and nearer unto it. So the Apostle exhorts us never to leave, till we
have cleansed ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and till
we 2. Cor. 7. 1. and 13. 11.
have perfected our holiness in the fear of God; propounding unto us no other
mark to aim at, but the mark of perfection. And tells us that God has
therefore instituted the Ministry of the Word, that he might thereby bring us
unto a perfect man, and unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Ephesians.
4. 13.
Christ. Thus he exhorts the Hebrews, that leaving the principles of the
Heb. 6. 1.
doctrine of Christ, they should go on unto perfection. And the Apostle James
exhorts us to aim at such a perfection, as wherein there is no want: Let
Iam. 1. 4.
patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting
nothing. And lest we should grow sluggish, because we suppose that we have
already matched our patterns in perfection, we have not only examples of Gods
Saints set before us for our imitation, as Noah, Abraham, Job, David and the
rest, but even of God himself, who is infinite in all perfection. Be perfect
(says our Savior) as your heavenly Father is perfect; not in degree, Mat. 5.
48.
seeing his perfection is above all degrees; but that we should strive to be
herein like unto him, seeing we profess that he is our Father, and we his
children.

. Sect. 2 Reasons moving us to aspire unto perfection.
Besides which testimonies and examples of holy Scriptures, tending to persuade
us unto this continual growth, till we attain unto full perfection, there are
also many reasons grounded upon them, which may quicken our endeavor in this
kind. As first, because though we have made good beginnings and proceedings,
yet if we be not still growing and going In bonis non tantum coepisse sed
persecisse laudandum est. Hieron. ad Celantiam.
forward toward perfection, all we have done already, is not praiseworthy in
the sight of God, who being in his own nature most perfect, likes of nothing
which is not like himself, and tends not unto perfection. Secondly because
we cannot stand at a stay in the course of Christianity, but are still
proceeding, or else declining and going back; either we are rowing against the
stream, or else are carried downward, though we perceive it not. To which
purpose one observes, that Jacob in his vision Bernard.
saw Angels upon the Ladder, ascending and descending, but none sitting or
standing still: because we have not here an abiding City, but we seek for one
to come. Either we must be still ascending, or we shall descend: if we will
stand still, we shall surely fall; like those who are upon an high and narrow
bridge, whose greatest safety in passing over is in their best speed. For
howsoever Christians, which have attained unto some good degree of perfection,
and to a settled course in godliness, may carry themselves with such uniform
constancy in all outward duties, that themselves cannot discern any remarkable
difference, yet even in them there is daily some proceeding in respect of their
inward graces, hearts and affections, and although their actions and operations
may, by reason of tentations and spiritual dissertions, decay in their sense
and feeling; yet in respect of their habits and disposition, they are still
proceeding to more perfection. Thirdly, because we can no otherwise be assured
of our spiritual life in grace, of which, motion and proceeding is an
inseparable consequence. For it is not with our souls as it is with our
bodies, which are of short life, and shorter growth, having their increase,
full stature and declination, seeing they, as long as we live, do proceed
from one degree of perfection unto another, till after this life they come to a
perfect age in Christ. They are herein like unto the morning light, which
still increases and shines more and more unto the perfect day; but Prou. 4.
18.
herein unlike the Sun, in that there is in this life and light of grace, no
time of setting or declination; and therefore the beauty of Christ's Spouse, is
compared to the brightness of the morning, which still Cant. 6. 10.
increases, and not to the afternoones light, which abateth more and more.
They are trees of righteousness of Gods planting, which always Esa. 61. 3, 11.
flourish; and when they come once to bring forth their fruits, they never
grow dry and barren, but are still purged and pruned by him that Joh. 15. 2.
set them, that they still bring forth fruit in more abundance; herein unlike
other trees, and resembling only the Palm and Cedar, in Psalm. 92. 14.
that they continually flourish, and most exceed in fruitfulness in their old
age, as the Psalmist notes. Gods children are not like false conceptions and
dead moles in the womb, which quickly come to full growth, and then standing
at a stay, prove abortiue births; but staying their appointed time, are
perfected by degrees in their shape, parts, and all their lineaments, and after
their birth stand not at a stay, (for there are no dwarfes in Gods family) but
grow from strength to strength, and from stature to stature, till they come to
a perfect age in Jesus Christ.

. Sect. 3 That except we grow in grace, we can have no sound comfort in our
estate.
And therefore when there is no growth in grace, nor in the practice of holy
duties, we can take little comfort in such a state: but as it is a grief to
parents, when as their children grow in age, and not in wisdom; and an ill
sign that nature is out of frame, and hindered in her course, when as in their
bodies they stand at a stay, and though they eat, and drink, and sleep, yet
do not grow at all in their stature: so have we more just cause to grieve,
when after many years we remain children in knowledge, and weaklings in all
saving grace; and may take it as an ill sign, that there is little grace in
us, or some notable impediment which does stop and hinder it in its operations,
when as having inioyed for a long time, the spiritual food of the Word and
Sacraments, we grow not up thereby, nor any whit increase in our strength and
stature. We are pilgrims and travelers (as we profess) toward our heavenly
home, who are still going on, and every day dispatch some part of the way; but
if we stand at a stay, and after many years spent, are no more forward in our
journey, then we were at our first setting forth, it shows plainly that we
are no true travelers, but loyterers, that lazily lie lusking in our Inn, or
that we have not gone in the right way that leads to our Country. We would
be counted soldiers in the Christian warfare, and profess that we fight
against the spiritual enemies of our salvation: but if Satan in every
tentation prevails with us; if the world has so allured us by her bewitching
baits, that we are in league and love with it, if after many years we have
got no conquest over our corruptions, pride, covetousness, voluptuousnes,
malice, envy, and such like; but that they still reign and rule in us as in
former times, it is a sign that we either are none of Gods* Soldiers, seeing
we have made a peace with his enemies, or that we are notable cowards, who
justly deserve to be casheered, and that there is little grace or goodness in
us, seeing so long time, and large means have so little improoued and
increased it. Doubtless (says one) he is not good, who will Minime pro cer^o
est bonus, qui melior esse non vult: and vbi incipis nolle fieri melior, ibi
desinis etiam esse bonus. Bernard. Epist. 91. Nemo perfectus est, qui
perfectior esse non appetit, etc. Bernard. Epist. 243.
not be better: and when thou ceasest in thy desires to become better, thou
ceasest also to be good. And again, no man has attained to any perfection,
who does not desire, and labor to be more perfect: and so much the perfecter
does every man approve himself, by how much the more earnestly he strives
after perfection. Moreover, true virtue knows no end, nor is circumscribed
with time; and the fear of the Lord indureth for ever. The just man thinks
with Paul, that he has never apprehended that which he pursues; nor ever
says, I have enough, but always hungreth and thirsts after righteousness;
so that if he should live for ever, he would also for ever desire still to be
more just, and would strive with all his strength to proceed from good to
better. For he is not a mercenary that has hired himself to do God service
for a year, but a son of the family which continues for ever. Finally, let
us labor daily to grow in grace, by exercising it continually in the duties of
godliness, both because otherwise we can have no assuracne that it is true and
substantial, but hypocritical, and a bare shadow, seeing all true grace is
growing grace, like the grain of mustard seed, small at the first, and great
afterward; and also because if we do not increase our Lords Talents, he will
take them from us, and give them to faithfuller servants; and seeing through
our negligence we have deprived our selves of the substance, he will also take
away from us the show and shadow; according to that of our Savior; Unto him
that has, shall be given, and he shall have abundance; Math 13. 12. Luke 8. 18.
but from him that has not, shall be taken away, even that which he seems
to have.

. Sect. 4 That if we desire to grow in grace, we must carefully use the means
which may further us in it, and what these means are.
Now if we would attain to this Christian growth, we must use all good means
which may further us in it: for in vain he professes his great desire to be
rich, who neglects all good husbandry and means of thriuing; or to grow in
strength and stature, who will not use food and clothing, which are the
ordinary means to attain unto them. Yea, if we desire spiritual growth in
grace and goodness, we must take more then usual pains, seeing as to the
augmenting of the body, there is required more meat, and better concoction,
then for the preserving of it in that stature and strength unto which it has
already attained; so unto our growth in grace, and increasing of our spiritual
stature, it is necessary that we more diligently use the means, and receive
the food of our souls in greater quantity, and with better stomachs, then
only to hold (as we say) life and soul together, and to preserve our graces
in their bare being and present plight. Now the means of increasing in grace,
and proceeding in the practice of all Christian duties, are the same by which
they had their first beginnings; as the careful and conscionable hearing of
the Word preached; for we must, like newborn babes, desire the sincere 1.
Pet. 2. 1.
milk of the Word, (which is also the seed of our Regeneration and newbirth)
if ever we mean to grow up thereby. So also the reading of the Word, and use
of the Sacraments, meditation, holy conferences, of which we have spoken in
part, and shall say more in the following discourse. But above all, invocation
and prayer, desiring God, who is the Author of our spiritual birth and being,
and also of our preservation and growth in godliness, that he will perfect
his good Phil. 1. 6. 2. Cor. 13. 9. Phil. 1. 9, 10, 11. Col. 1. 9. and 4. 12.
Heb. 13. 21. 1. Pet. 5. 10.
work which he has begun in us, sanctify us throughout in our souls and
bodies, and bring us from one degree to another, till at last we come to a
perfect man in Christ; whereof we have the holy Apostles in many places as fit
precedents and examples, who by their fervent prayers crave at Gods hands this
growth in grace for themselves and others. Finally, if we would be good
proficients in Gods service, we must often think of the worthiness and
excellency of our heavenly Master, who is the chief Goodness, and infinite in
all perfection, and therefore, above all, deserves our best pains and
diligence; of his inestimable love toward us shining in our Creation,
Preservation, and that great work of our Redemption, by the death of his dear
and only Son; for who would not love him, that has so loved us, and labor
to approve it by striving to serve him daily in more perfection? Of the
Passion and sufferings of Christ, which will make us think that we can never
do too much for him, who has done and suffered so much for us. Of the
perfection which the Law requires, under the penalty of a fearful curse, and
of the gracious promises, and sweet encouragements of the Gospel, belonging to
all those who strive and labor daily to attain unto this perfection. Of the
manifold and inestimable blessings, both temporal, spiritual and eternal,
which God has partly put presently into our hands, and partly confirmed unto
us by infallible assurances: all which liberal and bountiful wages, if we be
not too too ungrateful, will make us daily to double our diligence in doing
him service. Finally, we must oftentimes meditate of the breuity of our lives,
and uncertainty of this short time, compared with the excellency and eternity
of our heavenly happiness, promised to all them who spend this momentany and
uncertain time in the duties of Gods service; the which, if any thing will
move us to improoue the time present to the best advantage, seeing we are not
sure of another day; like wise Merchants who lay hold of a good pennyworth
when it is offered; and the prudent Pilot, who sets up all his sails
whilst the wind and tide favor him, because he is uncertain how long it will
last, and his opportunity being once past, cannot be recovered at his own
pleasure.

CAP. V.
Of the means whereby we may be enabled to lead a godly life: and first, of
the ministry of the Word.

. Sect. 1 That if we will lead a godly life, we must use the means inabling
us unto it.
Unto the rules of direction, which help and further us in the duties of a
godly life, we are to add the consideration of certain special means
respecting practice, whereby we may be the better enabled to perform them.
For as God in his Decree has ordained the ends at which we must chiefly aim,
that we may attain unto them; so also the means which conduce unto these
ends. As for example; he has propounded his glory as the supreme end of all
things; and withal, diverse means whereby it is advanced and magnified, as our
faithful service and obedience to his Commandments, faith in Christ, and such
like. He has ordained us to salvation, and that we may attain unto it, he
has linked his Decree to this end by certain subordinate causes and means,
as Creation, Redemption, Effectual calling, Justification, Sanctification, and
Preservation. He has decreed that we should live our natural life unto our
appointed time, but withal, that we should use the means of food, clothing,
sleep, physic, by which it is preserved and maintained. And thus also as he
has ordained that we should live the life of grace, so likewise that we
should use the helps and means which he has appointed for the beginning,
continuing, and finishing of it: which if we neglect, we can have no more
hope of attaining unto it, whatsoever fair pretenses we make of our fervent
desires to atchieue this end, then of coming to happiness, being destitute of
holiness, without which, the Apostle tells us, Heb. 12. 14.
we shall never see God; or of living to old age, without the use of the
means, meat, drink, and apparel; or of living to Gods glory, when as we
delight in the works of darkness, and shine not in the light of an holy life.
The which as it must make us careful to use all good helps appointed by God
for the inabling us unto the duties of a godly life; so our second care must
be, that we use them as means, and not supreme and principal causes, but
relying our selves chiefly upon God, his wisdom, and goodness, power, and
promises, the death and Resurrection of Christ effectually applied unto us by
the holy Spirit, let us use these means, as being his ordinances which he
has appointed to serve his providence, yet without putting our trust and
confidence in them, as sufficient in themselves to confer grace, or to enable
us unto the duties of a godly life; seeing without the chief Worker assisting
us in the use of them by his holy Spirit, they are able to do nothing; and
contrariwise, if they be wanting, he is all-sufficient without them, to make us
live holily in this world, and happily in the life to come. Now these means
are either ordinary, and in continual use upon all occasions; or
extraordinary, and to be used but at some times, when some special causes
move us unto them; and both of them either public or private, or else mixed,
and to be performed sometimes publicly in the Congregation, and sometimes
privately by our selves, or with others. The public means are the ministry
of the Word, the Sacraments and prayer. The which admit of a double
consideration in respect of their diverse relations to several ends. For as
they are duties performed unto God, that we may glorify him by doing unto him
service in them, they are parts and branches of piety and a godly life, in
which sense we have already entreated of them; but as they help and further us
for the begetting and increasing in us of all spiritual graces, and the
inabling of us unto all other Christian duties, they are the means of a godly
life, in which sense we are now to speak of them. Wherein they may be
resembled unto coin and treasure, the which is not only a part of our wealth,
but also the means of purchasing and procuring house, lands, goods, and all
other riches: or unto the hand, which in one relation is a part or member of
the body, but in another respect, an instrument and special means for the
preserving and nourishing of all our other parts.

. Sect. 2 That the ministry of the Word is a chief means of our spiritual
life.
The first means of a godly life, is the ministry of the Word; the which is
the ordinary means of begetting us to the life of godliness, and of beginning
in us all spiritual and saving graces, by which, as inward causes, we
outwardly move in all Christian and holy duties. Of raising us from the death
of sin, and cleansing and purging us from the guilt and corruption of it; and
also of so quickening and reviving us, that we are enabled to perform the
actions of holiness, and to bring forth the fruits of a godly conversation.
Thus the Apostle calls it, Gods Romans 1. 16.
strong power, whereby he pulls us out of the state of death, into the the
state of life and salvation; and the Apostle Peter, The immortal and
incorruptible seed, which begets us unto God, living and abiding in us for
1. Pet. 1. 23.
ever. And hence it is that the Ministers of the Word are called our spiritual
1. Cor. 4. 15.
fathers, who beget us unto God, because being dispensers of the Word of grace,
they are instruments and means of our Regeneration. Thus our Savior says,
that the hour was coming, yea even then was, that Joh. 5. 25.
the dead should hear his voice, and live; that is, those which were dead in
trespasses and sins, should be quickened, and have their part in the first
Resurrection, by virtue of his Word preached; for at this death and
Resurrection that whole discourse aims. And as we have first our spiritual
life from the ministry of the Word, so also our cleansing and sanctification
from the corruption and filth of sin, whereby we are wholly disabled unto all
holy duties of a godly life. For so our Savior tells his Disciples, that
they were clean, through his Word which he had spoken unto Ioh. 15. 3.
them. By which means he desires his Father, in his holy Prayer, to sanctify
them more and more. Sanctify them with thy truth; thy Word is truth. Ioh. 17.
17.
So the Apostle says, that our Savior gave himself for his Church, that he
Ephesians. 5. 26.
might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word; and
implies elsewhere, that we cannot ordinarily have faith, by which the just man
lives, but by the preaching and hearing of the Word. How can they Romans 1. 17.
believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a
Preacher? And after expressly affirms; That faith comes by hearing, and
10. 14, 17.
and hearing by the Word of God. And in another place he intimates, that we
cannot put off the old man, and being renewed in the spirit of our minds,
Ephesians. 4. 21, 22.
put on the new, which after God is created in righteousness and true
holiness, unless we have first heard Christ, and been taught by him, in the
ministry of his Word. But here we must take heed, that we do not attribute
our new birth and spiritual cleansing unto the Word preached, as having in it
any inherent power to give life and grace in it own nature, or as it is by man
preached unto us, (for then all that hear it, would be quickened unto
holiness and new obedience, whereas common and woeful experience teaches us,
that after the Gospel has been long preached in diverse places, the greatest
number remain unregenerate and dead in their sins,) nor yet as unto a
principal and chief cause of reviving us; for this were to make an Idol of
it, by attributing unto it Gods prerogatives and peculiar Math. 23. 9.
actions; who alone is able to regenerate us, as he only could first create
us. But we are to attribute this virtue of giving spiritual life to the Word
preached, not as coming from man, but as it is the Word of God, and his holy
ordinance which he has instituted and sanctified to this use of giving
spiritual life, and the begetting and increasing of his graces in us. By
virtue of which ordination, and the blessing of God upon it, the Word receives
all its power and vigor to quicken and preserve our spiritual life; even as
by the ordinance of God, and his blessing, we receive our natural life by
generation, and the preservation of it by food and clothing, which in
themselves exceed not other creatures in their virtue for these uses, but only
so far forth as God by his blessing inableth them unto them. The which if he
withdraw, our meat will not nourish Math. 11. 21. Luke 12. 47.
us, but rather become our bane and poison; and the Word preached will be so
far from being a Word of life and salvation, that it will become the savor
of death unto death, to our deep condemnation. In which regard 2. Cor. 2. 16.
we must not rest in the preaching and hearing of the Word, as in the deed
done, for the begetting of Gods graces, and beginning in us the life of
godliness: (for thus it is only the Spirit that quickens, making the Ioh.
6. 63.
same Word, and at the same time, effectual unto some for these ends, by an
inward, secret and powerful operation, which for want hereof is heard of
others without any profit) but use it as Gods ordinance, unto which his
blessing is promised, and does so ordinarily accompany it, in the hearts of all
those that use it in obedience to God, and desire to profit by it for the
former ends, that we may as well hope for spiritual life by feeding on this
food, as for the preserving of natural life by meat and drink, seeing both
alike are Gods ordinance, and by his power he is effectual in the one as well
as the other. And so contrariwise the neglect of this means, when God gives
it, does take away all hope of the spiritual life of grace; seeing we tempt
the Lord in refusing the means, and despising his ordinance; like those, who
pretending that they rest upon Gods sole power and promise for the preserving
of their lives, should utterly refuse to eat or drink. Again, whereas I say,
that the preaching of the Word is the ordinary means of life and grace, when
the Lord grants it unto us, we are to beware that we do not limit Gods power
unto it, as though he could not any other way quicken, sanctify and save us.
For he is able, without all means, to do all these by the sole and secret
work of his holy Spirit, being such an All-sufficient workman in himself,
that he needs not the help of any instruments; as we see in his sanctifying
and saving of elect Infants, dying whilst they are incapable of outward
means; for even in them these two go together, seeing the rule is general,
that without holiness no man shall see the Lord. And he is able to sanctify
other Heb. 12. 14.
means for these uses, (as he ordinarily does where the public ministry and
preaching of the Word is wanting) as the reading of the Word, private
catechizing, holy conferences, instruction, exhortation, admonition, good
examples, extraordinary blessings strangely conferred, sharp afflictions, and
by them great and unusual humiliations, the Lord using his corrections as an
hand to lead us to our sins, which have brought them upon us. And therefore
as when we have the Word, we may hear diligently, in hope of Gods blessing
upon his own ordinance; so when we are deprived of this ordinary means of
life and salvation, we are not to despair and cast away all our confidence,
seeing the Lord is able, either without means, by the sole operation of his
holy Spirit, to work his own work of grace and sanctification in us, or to
make other means, more weak in themselves, as powerful and effectual unto
us as the other, yea will assuredly do it, rather then he will fail of any
part of his promise, which he has made unto all those who trust and depend
upon him for life and salvation.

. Sect. 3 That it is the ordinary means of our new birth, and of working Gods
graces in us.
Secondly, as the ministry of the Word is the ordinary means of our new
birth, and of beginning in us Gods spiritual graces, whereby we are 1. Pet. 2.
2.
enabled to move in the duties of a godly life; so also of our spiritual
growth from strength to strength, and of increasing Gods graces where they are
begun; according to that of the Apostle Peter; As newborn babes desire the
sincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby. Neither are we to think
that the Word read, either by our selves or others, is ordinarily sufficient to
work in us grace and godliness; for if faith (as I have showed) comes by
hearing the Word preached, then also the life of faith, and fruits of
sanctification which spring from it, all which are nourished and increased by
the same means whereby they were first begun in us. Neither are we to dispute
of the excellency and power of other means in themselves, or compared with
this, seeing neither this, nor any other work by any inherent virtue in
themselves, but as they are Gods ordinances, which by his blessing attain to
their ends, and are made powerful and effectual by the inward operation of
his holy Spirit, to work and increase grace and sanctification in us. And
therefore seeing the Lord has ordained in all ages, not only that his Word
should be read for the edification of his people, but also that it should be
expounded to their understanding, and applied to their particular use, (as we
see in the example of the Priests in the days of Nehemiah, who caused the
people to understand Nehem. 8. 8, 9.
the Law, and not only read the Book of Gods Law distinctly, but also gave
the sense, and caused them to understand the reading: And in the practice of
our Savior Christ and his Apostles, who when the Law and Luke 4. 18, 19.
Prophets were read to the people, contented not themselves therewith, but
expounded and applied them to their use, according to the custom Act. 13. 15.
of those times) let not us therefore take upon us to be wiser then God,
supposing that we can do his work better by tools of our own choosing, then
by the means and instruments which he has ordained and sanctified, seeing
nothing can be done in this supernatural work of grace, without Gods
blessing, which we may expect with most assurance in the use of his own
ordinances. So that if either we desire the new birth of grace, or being
borne, to grow therein from one degree to another, let us conscionably use the
ministry of the Word to both these ends. Neither let us think that being once
regenerate, we may grow up of our selves by sole virtue of those principles
then infused unto us, and need no further the ministry of the Word to preserve
us in that state and being. For as the child newborn, cannot long continue in
life by virtue of his natural heat and moisture, and much less can grow in
strength and stature to a perfect man, unless he receive daily nourishment;
so neither can we subsist in our spiritual state and being, and much less
grow in grace unto a perfect age in Christ, unless our souls be duly
nourished with spiritual food, the Word of God, which is not only the
immortal seed of which we are begotten, but our Manna and meat; milk for
babes, and strong meat for men grown to riper age. Especially seeing to our
natural defects and sinful corruptions, which as inward impediments hinder
the growth of grace in us, there are added the outward assaults of our
malicious enemies, the world and the devil, who by their tentations will keep
us from thriuing and increasing, unless what is diminished by their malice,
be supplied plentifully by our spiritual nourishment. Neither do I thus
magnify the ministry of the Word, to derogate any thing from other excellent
means, as prayer, Sacraments, the reading of the Scriptures, and the rest, but
am ready to give unto them their deserved praise in their own place. For
howsoever, in the first acts of Regeneration, the preaching of the Word is the
chief, if not sole means of our new birth; For how shall they call upon him
in whom they Romans 10. 14.
have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not
heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher? yet in our spiritual
growth, the other are no less necessary for the increasing of Gods graces in
us, especially prayer, which is an ordinary and most powerful means to
prevail with God, for the obtaining of whatsoever is wanting unto us, although
we cannot pray with hope to be heard, unless we pray in faith, as the Apostle
James teaches us, and we cannot ordinarily have faith, till first it be
wrought in us by the preaching of the Word. And therefore let us not set these
means of grace, to contend together for eminence and excellency, and much
less magnify one of them to exclude another, but acknowledging all to be
excellent and necessary in their place and time, let us carefully join them
all together, that being nourished in our souls with this plenty and variety
of food, we may grow up the faster in all grace and godliness.

. Sect. 4 What is required in the Minister, that by his preaching he may
further the people in the duties of godliness.
Now that the Ministry of the Word may be an effectual means of grace, and
of strengthening us unto all holy duties of a Christian life; there are some
things required, both to the right preaching and hearing of it. Unto the
former, there are some things necessary in the person of the Preacher, and some
things in the act and execution of his Ministry. In the person, there must be
skill to divide the Word aright, not only giving a true sense of it to all,
but to apply a fit portion unto all sorts of hearers; and a great measure of
wisdom and understanding, through the outward helps of study and learning,
and the inward illumination of Gods Spirit, that he may be able to instruct
those which are ignorant; according to that in the Prophet Malachy; The Priests
lips should keep Mal. 2. 7.
knowledge, (namely, as Joseph's corn in the storehouses for the common use,
and not a close Prisoner, with whom none may be admitted to confer, saving
his Iaylour) and the people should seek the Law at his mouth. Unto which
knowledge and skill, there must be added industrious diligence, whereby he is
ready to preach the Word in season, and out of season, reproving 2. Tim. 4. 1,
2.
and rebuking, with all long suffering and doctrine, although he sees small
fruit of his labors. For though the Minister be never so rich in the
spiritual treasures of learning and knowledge, yet if miser-like, he do not
communicate them, but locketh them up in his own brain; the poor people are
never the better, but may perish in their ignorance, even as he Ezekiel. 33. 8.
shall do in his sloth and unfaithfulness. Thirdly, he must have his heart
affected with sincere love of the people, whereby he is moved in all 1. Pet.
5. 1, 2.
things to seek their good, and to prefer their salvation before his own
private profit. The which love in the teacher, will make way in the hearts of
his hearers, not only for his instructions and comforts, but also his
admonitions and reproves, seeing they come not out of any spleen, but out of
mere love, and fervent desire of saving their souls. In the act and execution
of his Ministerial function, he is to speak nothing but Gods Truth, as from
him, and as before him, in his pure sight, which discerns all error, and in
his glorious presence, who hates and abhors all vanity and hypocrisy: And
that not after his own manner, chiefly aiming to magnify himself in the
ostentation of his own learning and gifts, but in the demonstration of the
Spirit, above all desiring and indeuouring to glorify God in the salvation of
his hearers.

. Sect. 5 That the word must be preached powerfully and plainly.
Whereunto these two things are required; namely, that he preach the Word
powerfully and plainly; powerfully to the consciences of all, and plainly to
the capacity (as much as in him lies) of those which are most simple. Of both
we have the Apostle Paul for our pattern, who though he were most learned
above all other the Apostles, both in arts and tongues, and all other learning
of the Jews, yet came not in excellency of speech, nor the 1. Cor. 2. 1, 2, 4.
enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of
power; desiring to know nothing (that is, to make show of no other knowledge)
saving Jesus Christ and him crucified; and preferring five words spoken to the
understanding 1. Cor. 14. 19.
of his hearers, above ten thousand in an unknown tongue. Yea, we have herein
our Savior Christ himself, as our Precedent, who preached the Word, not like
the Scribes and Pharisees (after a ieiune and Scholasticall manner) but with all
power and authority. And though he were the wisdom of his Father, in whom
all treasures of knowledge and learning were Col. 2. 3.
hid; and the word of his Father, exceeding in sound eloquence both men and
Angels, yet preached the Word in a plain phrase and humble manner of speech,
not respecting what he was able to speak, but what his Disciples were able to
hear, conceive, and carry away; like a loving and Mar. 4. 33. Ioh. 16. 12.
careful nurse, chawing the harder and stronger meat in his mouth, that they
might the better receive it, whilst he explained more difficult points, by
easy and familiar similitudes. Neither had he only care of more thoroughly
informing those who were men grown in knowledge, by teaching them the high and
hidden mysteries of his Kingdom, but also of Ioh. 3. 3, 4, 5.
instructing his little children and young nouices in the first principles of
true Religion, as it was prophesied of him by Esayas, All thy children shall
Esa. 54. 13.
be taught of the Lord, and great shall be their peace. And like a faithful
and Ioh. 6. 45.
careful Shepherd, he did not only apply himself to feed his whole flock,
but extended his care and love chiefly to his yonglings, gathering his Esa. 40.
11.
Lambs with his arm, and carrying them in his bosom, and gently leading
those which were great with young. The which care and charge, when he was to
ascend on high, he deputed to the Apostle Peter, and in him to all the whole
Ministry, that they should feed his tender Lambs, as well as his older and
stronger Sheep. And therefore though the ouer-wise Grecians account the simple
preaching of Christ crucified, foolishness; and the learned 1. Cor. 1. 23.
Doctors of the world make themselves sport with this easy plainness: Let
all that truly fear God, choose rather to imitate Christ and his Apostles in
their course of preaching, laboring to speak unto the capacity of the meanest
and simplest, seeing the charge of their souls is commended unto them by our
great Shepherd, as well as theirs who are of greatest understanding, and the
souls of all being alike dear unto God, they shall give account of one as
well as of another, of the little Lambs, as well as of the Rams of the
flock. And seeing we must not only take care for our selves, that we may go
to heaven alone, but are appointed Captains and Leaders of Gods Armies, we
must not skorne plain ways, wherein all our company may go with us, the
weak and sick, as well as the strong and healthy; and mount aloft in learned
discourses and Scholasticall speculations (as it were upon the Alps) which are
no less high above their capacity, then cold and heartlesse, giving no warmth
to their zeal and devotion; or travel in the craggy and rough ways of
knottie controversies, needless genealogies, and abstruse difficulties, where
we shall leave all our hearers afar off behind us: but choose rather such
fair ways and beaten paths, as will bring us and our company with us, with
most speed and safety to the end of our journey. For though hereby we cannot
commend our strength and swiftness, though we outrun others that have set out
before us, because they go in mountainous ways, and far about, yet we shall
commend our wisdom and prudence, in that we have chosen the fairest and
nearest way. And surely if an impartial view were taken of several
congregations, and just trial made, whether those have best thriuen in the
Christian growth, who have bin diligently fed with ordinary food and daily
bread, or those who are sometimes feasted with a banquet of delicate dishes; I
doubt not but it would be found, that as sometime Daniel Dan. 1. 15.
and his fellows, that fed upon plain pulse, which God had sanctified to their
use, were fatter and in better liking then they that did eat the portion of
the kings meat: so those people and Parishes would be found more thriuing
Christians, both in knowledge and practice, who are fed with the pulse of
plain Preaching, and with wholesome, though homely food, because they can feed
upon it, and better digest it, then others that have a kingly portion of
abstruse learning, wit, and eloquence, sometimes (though rarely) allowed unto
them, seeing they are meats of too hard disgestion for their weak stomakes,
causing crudities, humorous and ill-concocted conceits, and seldom affording
any wholesome nourishment.

. Sect. 6 Of the duties of the people, respecting the Ministry of the Word.
The consideration whereof, as it should effectually move Gods Ministers to
take such a course in their preaching, as is most fit and profitable for 1.
Cor. 9. 22.
their hearers, and denying themselves, and the praise of their great learning
and gifts in the work of their Ministry, to become as weak to those that are
weak, that they may gain them to Christ; so also should it move the people,
who desire to be built up in saving knowledge, and in the practice of all holy
duties belonging to a godly life, to affect such teachers, as being learned and
sufficient, do conscionably apply themselves to their capacity, for their
instruction and edification. To which purpose, they must strive with God in
their fervent prayers, that he will send such laborers into Mat. 9. 38.
his harvest; and in humility and submissiue obedience, as their place and
calling will permit, labor by earnest suite with superior Magistrates over
Church and Common wealth, and especially with Patrones and disposers of
Church-preferments, that they will provide and set over them such faithful and
painful Pastors, as will feed them with food convenient for the preserving
of their souls in spiritual life, and the nourishing and increasing of Gods
graces in them; not foolishly affecting and admiring (as it is common with
those that are most ignorant) such teachers, as desiring the praise of their
great learning, more then the salvation of their peoples souls, do most
exceed the short reach of their shallow capacities; like unto cold stomachs,
which have a greedy appetite after meats of hard disgestion, but when they
have received them, for want of natural heat turn them into wind, which
affects their brain with noisome vapors, and are not able to convert them
into any wholesome nourishment. Secondly, their care must be, as much as in
them lies, and the necessary preservation of their state will suffer them, to
place themselves under such a Ministry, as will help them forward in their
spiritual thrift and growth of grace, and counting (according to Mary's
choice, and our Saviors approbation) this one thing necessary, let them
prefer it before all worldly Luke 10. 42.
things; as fertile soyles, good air, well-seated houses and shops fit for
trading, delightful walks and prospects, and plentiful provision for
housekeeping; which without the other, may make full purses and Barnes, but
hearts empty of all grace and goodness; healthy and well-liking bodies, but
hunger-starued, lean and sickly souls. Thirdly, they must join their cost
with their care, and like the wise Merchant, esteem this Mat. 13. 44, 45.
precious pearl and hid treasure, above all other their possessions; they
must, if it be in their power, purchase it at any rate, seeing it only can make
them truly rich, according to the counsel of the Wiseman; Buy the truth, Pro.
23. 23.
and sell it not; thinking that part of their wealth well spared, which serves
as a means to bring them unto the right use of all the rest, and to enrich
their souls with the incomparable treasures of Gods saving graces, whereby
they are strengthened to the wise performance of all Christian duties.
Fourthly, having Ministers, though not eminent and excellent in their gifts,
yet of some good towardliness and willingness to grow unto more perfection,
they must give them no discouragements, by their bitter censures, awke and
froward carriage, backwardness to pay unto them their right, or running from
them upon every slight occasion to hear others; but rather they must nourish
and cherish the good things which they see in them, that they may increase more
and more, by showing all love and kindness, due reverence and respect;
especially by regarding them in the work of their Ministry, and hearing them
with all diligence, constancy, and attention. For by thus drawing the breasts
of their spiritual nurses, they shall bring down their milk, and cause it to
increase and abound, at least, to a sufficiency of nourishment, whereas if it
be not sucked, it will curdle in the breast, and make them heart-sicke to be
thus neglected, or else in short time turn back, and quite drying up, leave
unto them no nourishment at all. Finally, when God has provided for them such
as are eminent in their gifts, and painful in their Ministry, laboring in
word and doctrine, and going out and in before them as good guides in their
government, and holy example, they must not grudge to give them the double
honor of reverence and maintenance, and together with the heavy weight of
their Ministry, suffer them to lie gasping and groaning under the burden of
poverty and contempt, but give them all good encouragement, not thinking much,
that those who impart unto them heavenly treasures, should be 1. Cor. 9. 11.
partakers with them of their earthly blessings: but especially, they must
labor to profit by their pains, in knowledge and fruitful obedience, which
is the joy of their hearts, the life of their life, and the Crown of 2. Cor.
3. 1. Phil. 4. 1.
their Ministry; lest when they see that they sow all their good seed in
barren soyles, and with the Prophet, and our Savior Christ himself, have just
cause to complain, that they have labored and spent their strength in Esa.
49. 4.
vain, they be forced to make choice of better and more fruitful grounds, and
to employ their labors in some other place, where they may more glorify God,
and receive more joy and comfort to their own hearts.

CAP. VI.
Of the duties of the people in hearing of the Word; and first, of such as are
to be performed in their preparation.

. Sect. 1 That we must use preparation before the hearing of the Word, and
wherein it consists.
ANd these are the things which are required unto the right preaching of the
Word. Unto the right hearing of it, that it may be a powerful means to enrich
us with Gods graces, and to strengthen us unto all Christian duties of a godly
life, some things are required before we hear, some things in hearing, and
some things after we have heard it. Before we hear, we must use due
preparation; unto which is required first, that we enter into a serious
consideration of Gods glorious presence, before whom we are to present our
selves, that we may hear him speaking unto us, not of ordinary matters of
small importance, but such as merely concern his glory, and the everlasting
salvation of our own souls. Whereby we shall be preserved from rushing rashly
into the holy assemblies, and be made careful to look unto our feet, before
we enter into the House of God. For if worldly men, Eccles. 5. 1.
duly considering that they are going into the presence of an earthly King, to
hear him speak of the weighty affairs of the Common wealth, or such things
as nearly concern them in their own particular, prepare themselves
accordingly, that they may be fit to come into such a royal presence; how
much more should we use the like and greater care, when we are to come into
the presence of the King of Kings, and to hear him speaking unto us of such
things, as much more concern us and the everlasting good of our souls and
bodies? Secondly, being to come unto this spiritual feast, we are to prepare
our selves by getting a good appetite, that we may not idly fit by and look
on, when others feed on these spiritual delicacies, for the refreshing and
strengthening of their souls. To which end, we must, by renewing our
repentance, purge and cleanse our souls from sinful corruptions (as our
stomachs from clogging and hurtful humors) which otherwise will take away our
appetite, and make us loathe and refuse, or eating against stomach, not able to
digest our spiritual nourishment. Of which kind are wrath, maliciousness,
guile, dissimulation, Jam. 1. 21. 1. Pet. 2. 1.
hypocrisy, prejudice, and forestalled opinions, and such like; seeing if
these bear sway in us, it is not possible that the Word of God should take any
effect, or become profitable nourishment for the preserving and increasing of
our spiritual health and strength. So also we must banish out of our minds
worldly cogitations about our pleasures or profits, which will distract us from
hearing the Word with any attention, and out of our hearts earthly cares, which
like thorns, will choke the seed of the Word, and make it utterly unfruitful
in us. Moreover, we must stir up our appetite, by considering our spiritual
wants, which can no otherwise be supplied, then by coming unto this feast; for
as hunger, and sense of our emptiness, makes us to long after our bodily
food, so if we duly consider how empty we are of all Gods graces, and feeble
unto all good duties, it will much increase our appetite to the food of our
souls; and we shall go to this Market with all cheerfulness, if we
consider, that here, and no where else, we may fit and furnish our souls
with all necessaries. Again, we must examine our sins which bear sway in
us, that repenting of them, we may receive the assurance of pardon in the
public ministry, to our inestimable comfort, and may also be strengthened
against the power of them, that we may subdue them, and not suffer them to
reign in us, as in former times; being armed against them, and the tentations
of our spiritual enemies, alluring, or forcibly drawing us into them, with the
whole armor of God, and especially the sword of the Spirit. And this will also
provoke our appetite, and make us go with cheerfulness to the hearing of
Gods Word, like the malefactor to receive his pardon, or the Soldier that
has been often wounded and foiled, by reason of his nakedness, to put on
sufficient armor, and to receive from his Commander defensive and offensive
weapons. Finally, we must prepare our selves, and stir up our appetite, by
considering the properties of the Word, which we go to hear. As first, the
excellency of it, as being the Word, not of man, but of God, the Word of
truth, life, and salvation. Secondly, the power and efficacy of it, as being
the power of God himself to our salvation, Romans 1. 16. Heb. 4. 12.
sharper then any two-edged sword, pearcing even to the very dividing of the
soul and the Spirit, the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart. A Word that has always its operation, and returns
Esa. 55. 11.
never in vain, but brings that to pass for which it is sent, and is either
the sweet savor of life unto life, or of death unto death. Thirdly, the great
2. Cor. 2. 15, 16.
vtility and profit of it, being a perfect and pure Law, that conuerteth the
soul, Psalm. 19. 7, 8.
a light that shines unto us who sat in the shadow of death, and guiding our
feet into the way of peace; heavenly wisdom, that gives understanding unto
Luke 1. 79.
the simple, and makes the wise more wise; our Counselor to advise us, our
food to nourish us, our weapon to defend us and repel our enemies, an
effectual means to work in us all saving graces, and the way that brings
us to eternal blessedness. Finally, let us prepare our selves, and whet our
appetite, by considering the necessity of it, seeing without it we can attain
unto no good, nor escape any evil; in which regard, our Savior says to
Martha, that this one thing is necessary, as though there were no Luke 10. 42.
necessity of any other thing in comparison of it. The which necessity lies
not only upon weakelings, and those who are simple and ignorant, that they may
learn the truth, but also upon those who have made greatest progress in
Christianity, and are richest in knowledge, that they may be moved to
practice what they know, and bring it to holy use, and that the graces of God
may be confirmed and preserved in them. Unless any man would foolishly imagine
that he is so strong in grace, that he needs not to eat any more food, for
the restoring of that spiritual strength which is daily abated and impaired
through our corruption, and the assaults and tentations of our neuer-resting
enemies, Satan and the world. The last duty to be performed in our preparation,
is, that we fervently pray unto God for his grace, and the assistance of his
holy Spirit, both to his Ministers in speaking, and our selves with the rest of
his people, in hearing, that he may be so enabled thereby to speak the Word
truly, sincerely, powerfully and profitably, and we to hear in a Christian and
holy manner, that God may be glorified, and we edified in our holy faith, and
strengthened more and more unto all the duties of a godly life.

. Sect. 2 Of duties to be performed in the hearing of the Word.
In the hearing of the Word, diverse duties are to be performed. As first, we
must set our selves in Gods presence, that we may hear all things that are
Act. 10. 33. Esa. 66. 2. 1. These. 2 13.
commanded us of him, according to the example of good Cornelius; in which
regard we must not hear the Word after a careless and cold manner, but with
fear and trembling, if we would have God that speaks, take any delight in
us. Secondly, we must hear it, not as the word of man, but as it is the Word
of God, by which we shall one day be justified or condemned. Thirdly, we
must hunger after the sincere milk of Gods 2 Cor. 5. 20. Luke 10. 16. 1. Pet.
2. 1, 2.
Word, without the mixture of humane traditions, carnal eloquence, and worldly
wisdom, that we may grow up thereby. Fourthly, we are to hear with all
attention, having our eyes fastened upon the Teacher, and hanging upon his
lips, as the child upon the mothers breast, like the hearers Luke 4 20. and 19.
48. Nehem. 8. 3. Act. 20. 7.
of our Savior Christ; to which end we must carefully banish all worldly
cogitations and wandering thoughts, and also all drowzinesse and sleepiness,
seeing we would not so hear our equals, and much less our superiors.
Fifthly, we must hear with alacrity and cheerfulness, and shake off all
dullness and carnal weariness, which makes no part of the Sermon pleasing but
the conclusion only. Sixthly, we must hear with all due reverence, the Word,
as being the Word of God, and not of man, as from him, and before him, in whose
presence the hills and mountains shake and tremble. Seventhly, with all
humility, submitting our selves unto it, as unto the Scepter of Gods Kingdom,
to be ruled and directed, instructed and reproved by it, and not rebel
against Gods holy ordinance, and repine and rage against our Teachers, when
they touch our consciences to the quick, and sharply repro^e us for our
sins. Lastly, we must hear the Word with faith and a good conscience, giving
credit Heb. 4. 2.
unto all the parts of it, as well threatenings as promises, and applying all to
our own use; with an earnest desire to profit by it, and to lay it up in the
closet of our hearts, that we may not be forgetful hearers, and like leaking
Heb. 2. 1.
and riuen vessels that will hold nothing.

. Sect. 3 Of duties to be performed after the hearing of the Word.
After the hearing of the Word, two duties are to be performed. The first is,
that publicly in the Church we join with the Minister in giving praise and
thanks unto God for his mercy toward us, in feeding our souls with the bread
of life, and for the liberty he has given us to come in peace and safety into
his holy Assemblies, to hear us speak unto him in our prayers, and to speak
unto us by his Minister and Ambassador; and that privately at home, at least
in some short manner, we renew our thanksgiving, and desire the Lord to write
that which we have heard, in our hearts, by the finger of his Spirit, and to
make it effectual for the enriching of our hearts with saving grace, and the
strengthening of us to all holy duties. And if our memory, ability and gifts
will serve, it is profitable for us, and acceptable to God, if we can frame our
prayer according to that which we have heard, confessing those sins which
have been reproved, bewailing those wants which have been discovered, desiring
those graces which have been commended unto us, or praising God if we already
have them, and desiring grace and spiritual strength, that we may perform
those duties, unto which we have been persuaded and exhorted. The second duty
is, that we lay up that which we have heard, in our hearts and memories, that
we may practice them in our lives. For as it is not enough to have good seed
sown in our grounds, if we do not cover it that it may take root, but let
the fowls of heaven take it away, nor to feed upon wholesome meat, unless we
retain it in our stomachs that it may be digested, and like good nourishment
applied to all the parts of the body; so it will little avail us to hear many
Sermons, and never think more of them after we are gone out of the Church, and
to receive this spiritual food with greedy appetites, if we keep it not, but
presently cast it up again, out of hearts surfetted with worldly cares, and
clogged and cloyed with the gross humors of our sinful lusts. The which (as
I am persuaded) is one chief cause why the most, even amongst diligent
hearers, have, after so long inioying the light of the Gospel, so little
profited either in knowledge or holy practice; namely, because they have been
so careless in keeping what they have heard, and have put this spiritual
treasure into broken bags, and this precious liquor into riuen vessels. Now the
means to retain and imprint the things which we have heard in our hearts and
memories, is first to love, regard, and set our hearts upon them; for even old
men (as we say) who are weakest in memory, do yet retain those things which
they most affect. The second is, that we hear the Word with diligent
attention, observing the method of the Teacher, and how he proceeds from
point to point, fastening the former point in our minds, by casting our eye
back unto it, when as he is leaving of it, and proceeding to another. For as
it is not possible that the fault of the first concoction, should be amended in
the second, seeing every part and faculty is wholly taken up about its own
proper work; so is it no more possible that we should remember that which we
never minded, or that the memory should bring forth that, which the
understanding neglected to lay up by due attention and observation. And
therefore the Apostle tells us, that we ought to give the more earnest heed
to the things we hear, Heb. 2. 1.
lest at any time we should let them slip. Thirdly, this may make us rub our
memories, and make us careful to imprint in them the things which we hear,
if we consider that our diligent hearing of the Word will not make us happy,
unless we also retain it in our memories, and practice it in our lives: for
so the Apostle James says, that if we look into the perfect Law of Iam. 1. 25.
liberty, and continue therein, being not forgetful hearers, but doers of the
work, we shall be blessed in our deed. And the Apostle Paul limiteth the
promise of salvation made unto the preaching and hearing of the Word, to the
condition of retaining it in our memories. I declare (says he) unto you the
1. Cor. 15. 1, 2.
Gospel which I preached, and ye received, by which also ye are saved, if you
keep in memory that which I preached unto you. Fourthly, we must unto our
hearing, add meditation, which is a notable means of imprinting it in our
hearts and memories. Fifthly, we must confer with others, that they may
help us where we are wanting, and we them, where they have failed. Sixthly,
Governors of families may help themselves, and those which are committed to
their charge, for the better understanding and remembering of what they have
heard, by repeating the chief points of the Sermon after they are come home,
by strength of their memory, or help of their notes, and examining their
children and servants, and putting them to give an account of what they have
heard and learned. Lastly, we must make what we have heard, our own, by
applying it to our own use, and bringing it to practice in our lives and
conuersations; whereby we shall Luke 11. 28. Ioh. 13 17. Iam. 1. 25.
entitle our selves to that blessedness which is promised to all those who
both hear the Word and keep it. And so much of the first means of inabling
us to the duties of a godly life, the ministry of the Word, and the things
that are required unto it. The which I have the more briefly Christian warfare,
1. part. lib. 2. cap. 26.
passed over, because I have touched diverse of the points before, and more
fully handled some of them in another Treatise.

CAP. VII.
Of the second public means of a godly life, which is the administration of
the Sacraments.

. Sect. 1 That the Sacraments further us much in a godly life, as they are
seals of the Covenant.
THe second means of enriching us with all saving graces, and strengthening us
unto all the duties of a godly life, is the right use of the Sacraments,
Baptism, and the Lords Supper, both which do much conduce hereunto, and each
of them severally. For the Sacraments are seals annexed to the Covenant of
grace, purposely instituted of God to strengthen and confirm our faith in this
assurance, that Christ and all his benefits do belong unto us; that in him,
and for his righteousness, death, and full satisfaction unto Gods Justice, he
has pardoned and forgiven unto us all our sins; that in him he is well
pleased with us, and has given unto us just title and interest to all his
promises both of grace in this life, and glory and happiness in the life to
come; that he will give unto us his holy Spirit, and thereby write his Law in
our hearts, that we shall not depart from him, mortify our corruptions, and
quicken us unto new obedience. Of all which benefits, the Sacraments are not
only significant signs, but also infallible seals, annexed purposely by God
unto his Covenant, to assure us that he will perform all his promises, and to
give unto us (like a bond and conueyance legally signed and sealed) just title
and interest unto all those blessings, even before we sensibly have them in
possession and fruition. Yea not only so, but they also serve like instruments
and conduit pipes to convey to the worthy receiver, Christ, and all his
benefits. Now what can more forcibly persuade, or more powerfully enable us to
the duties of a godly life, then the representing, assuring, and exhibiting of
all these inestimable benefits, in the right use of the Sacraments? What can
more inflame our hearts with most fervent love toward God, then the
consideration, yea sense and feeling of this admirable love of God toward us,
in giving unto us when we were sinners, strangers and enemies unto him and his
grace, Christ Jesus, and with him all these unspeakable benefits? and what more
then love can effectually move us to an holy desire in all things to glorify
and please him, and to walk worthy his love in all holiness of life and
conversation? What can more lighten the burden of our labor, and make us to
think all too little which we can do and suffer for him? Again, the Covenant
of grace sealed unto in the right use of the Sacraments, does singularly
encourage us to lay aside all doubts and difficulties, seeing God thereby
assures us that he will, yea has given unto us his holy Spirit, to direct and
assist us in all our good endeavors, in the mortifying of all our sinful
corruptions, seem they never so strong and irresistable, and strengthening us
to the performance of all good duties, seem they never so difficult and
unpleasing unto flesh and blood. And what can more effectually move us to go on
in the work of sanctification, then to have such an assistant to join with
us, unto whom nothing is difficult, being infinitely able to perform and
perfect whatsoever he undertakes? What can more powerfully persuade us to do
God faithful service, then to have the pardon of our sins put into our own
hands, signed and sealed, so dearly purchased, and so freely given? then to
have the present pledges and pawnes of Gods love and favor, the earnest of his
Spirit, the first fruits of his graces, and the conueyances of our heavenly
Inheritance, sealed and delivered into our own keeping. For who would be so
sluggish, as not to do faithful and diligent service to such a glorious and
gracious Master, for such liberal and bountiful wages? Finally, seeing in the
right use of the Sacraments we do really and truly, though spiritually and by
faith, receive Christ, that he may dwell in us, and we in him, and not only
communicate with him in his divine graces imputed by God, and applied by faith,
but also by virtue of his Spirit assisting this ordinance, have all sanctifying
and saving graces confirmed and increased in us, whereby we are strengthened
unto all the duties of a godly life: hence also it appears how much they
conduce and further us in them; seeing we have Christ himself a co-worker with
us, who by his holy Spirit sustaineth the greatest part of the weight of that
his easy yoke, and light burden, which he lays upon us; in which respect we
may take courage unto us, and say with the Apostle, that we are able to do all
things, through the power of Christ which strengthens Phil. 4. 13.
us; and seeing also they cherish and increase his gifts and graces in us,
whereby we are moved and enabled to work together with him, in all holy duties
of Gods service, and of a godly and Christian life.

. Sect. 2 That the Sacraments further us in godliness, as they are
testifications of our service to God.
Secondly, the Sacraments are helps unto us for this purpose, as they are
solemn testifications of our service and obedience unto God, seeing they are
his liueries and cognizances whereby his servants are known from others; and
the sacramental oath which he causes all his soldiers to take, when he
entertaineth them into his spiritual warfare; and the pres-money which he
puts into their hands, whereby he obliges and firmly binds them to
continue constant in this warfare, and to fight courageously under his colors.
Now this may move us to do faithful service unto our great Lord and Master,
partly because he has so innobled us by giving us entertainment into his
Family, and graced us, by letting us wear his livery and cognizance, seeing it
is a far greater advancement and dignity, to be one of his meanest servants,
even a doorekeeper in his House, then to be the greatest Monarch in the earth;
partly Psalm. 84. 10.
because he incourageth us to faithful and diligent service by such bountiful
wages and inestimable rewards; and partly because we shall otherwise dishonor
our Lord and Master, and wear his livery to do him shame; yea also disgrace
our selves, whilst we do discover our gross hypocrisy, in not answering to
our profession, nor performing such holy duties as are suitable unto it; whereby
we shall move the Lord, in his just displeasure, to pull our liueries over our
ears, and so uncasing us, to lay open our hypocrisy to our shame, and to
turn us out of doors. This may move us also to fight courageously under his
Standard, against the spiritual enemies of our salvation, seeing if we slip
out of his Camp, after we have received this pres-money, and run away, we
deserve death by our apostasy; or if we cowardly yield unto the assaults and
tentations of our spiritual enemies, and do not fight valiantly, and perform
faithful service to our grand-Captaine, even unto the death, we are well
worthy to be cashiered, to have no part in the glory of his victory, nor any
portion of joy in his heavenly triumph.

. Sect. 3 That the Sacrament of Baptism furthereth us in godliness, as we are
thereby ingrafted into Christ.
More specially, the Sacrament of Baptism is to the worthy receiver, a notable
means to enable us unto the duties of a godly life. First, because Gal. 3. 26,
27.
thereby we are sacramentally ingrafted into the body of Christ, and made
members of his body spiritually by faith, as we are outwardly initiated,
entered and admitted by the Congregation, as members of the visible Church,
according to that of the Apostle, Ye are all the children of God, by faith in
Jesus Christ; for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on
Christ. By virtue of which incision, we are enabled to bring forth the fruits
of holiness and righteousness; according to that of our Savior; I am the
Vine, ye are the branches; he that abides in me, and I in him, the same Job.
15. 5.
brings forth much fruit, (namely, by that life and sap of grace which he
receives of me) for without me ye can do nothing. For as the Impe or Cion
lives not by his own life, but being cast out of the stock, dies and
withers; so being ingrafted into Christ, we live not our own life, but by
virtue of that lively sap of grace which we receive from him, according to
that of the Apostle; I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me; and the Gal.
2. 20.
life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,
who has loved me, and given himself for me; whereas he that abides not in
the true Vine Jesus Christ, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered, and
men gather Ioh. 15. 6.
them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. More specially, being
baptized into Jesus Christ, we are baptized into his death and Resurrection,
from which such virtue and vigor is derived unto us, that we are not only
thereby washed and purged from the guilt and punishment of all our sins, but
also enabled to mortify and crucify the old man, the flesh, with the sinful
lusts thereof, and raised from the death of sin, to holiness and newness of
life. The which is not only sacramentally signified by the outward washing and
sprinkling with water, which serves to cleanse us from our bodily defilements,
by our stay, and (as it were burying) under it, representing our mortification,
death and burial to sin, and our rising out of it, signifying our spiritual
Resurrection to a new life, but also certainly sealed and assured, and
powerfully conveyed to the worthy receiver, that is, to little children elected
to salvation, potentially, the inward virtue lying hid in them, till being come
to age, it be produced into act by a lively faith; and to those of years
actually, who with the outward washing, apply by faith the blood of Christ for
the purging of them from the guilt, punishment and corruption of their sins,
and the virtue of his death and Resurrection, for the killing and crucifying of
the flesh with the lusts thereof, and their spiritual quickening unto
holiness and new obedience. And hereof it is, that the Apostle draws from
our Baptism effectual arguments to persuade us unto, and work in us
sanctification and holiness of life. How shall we (says he) that are dead to
sin, live any longer therein? Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized
into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with
him by Baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead, by
the glory of the Father; even so we also should walk in newness of life; for
if we have bin planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also
in the likeness of his Resurrection; Knowing this, that our old man is
crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth
we should not serve sin, etc.

. Sect. 4 Secondly, as it is the Sacrament of our new birth.
Secondly, Baptism does enable us unto the duties of a godly life, as it is
the Sacrament of our Regeneration and new birth, not only signifying, but
sealing and assuring, yea powerfully conueying to the worthy receiver (by the
inward operation of Gods Spirit, which powerfully works together with his
holy ordinances) the spiritual life of grace, potentially to the elect
Infants, as they potentially have faith, and by Gods Decree are ordained to
believe, and actually to those who by faith apply unto themselves Christ and
all his benefits. By which spiritual life and quickening power, they are
enabled, according unto their age and growth in Christ, to move and work in
the duties of holiness; even as the child which is newborn moves as soon
as it lives, first more weakly, and afterward more strongly, as it increases
in age and growth, in strength and stature. Neither is the virtue of Baptism
thus quickening us to newness of life, to be limited and restrained to the
time past, or to the present act of administration, as though it did no more
but purge and cleanse us from the guilt and punishment of our sins past, and
mortify our original sin in which we were borne, or raise us who were dead
in trespasses and sins, unto the first beginnings of spiritual life and
motion, bringing us (as it were) to the birth, and then utterly leaving us to
be nursed and nourished by other means; but the power and vigor of it
continues and extends it self to the whole course of our lives; and is an
effectual means, being recalled to our minds, and afresh applied by faith,
both to assure us of the pardon of all our sins, as it is the seal of the
Covenant, whose virtue continues not only at the first act of sealing, but as
long as the term specified in the writing, and therefore must continue in
full virtue for ever, to our use, seeing it is a seal affixed to an
everlasting Covenant; and also with no less efficacy to mortify daily more
and more, all our sinful corruptions, and to quicken us unto holiness and new
obedience, when upon any occasion we apply unto us the death and Resurrection
of Christ, signed and sealed unto us, and for our perpetual use in our
Baptism; and do reuiew our spiritual evidences, and the great Charter of
Gods Covenant, wherein he has not only given Christ unto us, and all his
benefits, but also has promised and assured us that he will give his holy
Spirit to continue with us unto the end of the world, who will apply unto us
the efficacy of Christ's death and resurrection, not only for the pardon of
our sins, in respect of their guilt and punishment, but also for the washing
away daily of the pollution of it, and subduing of the flesh and the lusts
thereof, and for our continual quickening and further growth in all duties of
holiness and righteousness.

. Sect. 5 Thirdly, as it is our restipulation in the Covenant of grace.
Thirdly, it is a means to help us forward in all duties of godliness, as it
is our restipulation in the Covenant of grace, whereby having received from God
the promise of the remission of our sins, grace and glory, we for our part
promise unto God again, that we will receive Christ and all his benefits by a
true and lively faith, bringing forth the fruits thereof in unfeigned
repentance and amendment of life, and that utterly renouncing Satan, the world,
and our own sinful flesh with the lusts thereof, we will wholly dedicate and
consecrate our selves, or souls and bodies to the service of him who is our
Creator and Redeemer. The which our vow and Covenant made unto God, is a
powerful bond to restrain us from all sin, and to tie us unto the
performance of all duties of Gods service, seeing if we do not perform the
condition of the Covenant between him and us, we can have no true joy and
comfort in our lives, because we can have no assurance that we have any right
and interest unto any of Gods gracious promises made unto us in Jesus Christ.
So often therefore as we have occasion to call to our remembrance, our vow and
promise made unto God in baptism, and especially when we are present at the
celebration of this holy Sacrament, and hear it again repeated and made in
the name of infants admitted unto it; if we conscionably labor to make a
right use of our Baptism, it will put us in mind of our Covenant then made
with God, and renew our desires, resolution, and endeavor of performing that
service in the duties of a Christian life, which we have vowed and promised
unto him, lest we should be found Couenant-breakers, and dalliers with God,
who will not be mocked, thereby deluding our selves of all blessings and
benefits, respecting this life and the life to come, which in the Covenant of
grace are promised unto us. Where, by the way we may observe, that those who
withdraw themselves, and depart out of the assembly when the Sacrament of
Baptism is administered, do not only thereby sin against God, the Church,
and the party baptized (as I have before showed) but also are very injurious
unto themselves, in that they lose a good opportunity of calling to mind and
renewing their Covenant with God, and deprive themselves of one special help,
whereby they might be enabled to perform the duties of a godly life.

. Sect. 6 That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a powerful means to
further us in Christian duties, first, because thereby our Communion with
Christ is confirmed, and secondly, our faith strengthened.
Ioh. 6. 54, 56.
So likewise the Supper of the Lord, rightly celebrated and used, is a
powerful means to enable and help us forward in the performance of all
Christian duties. First, because thereby our union and Communion with Christ,
is more and more strengthened and confirmed; seeing God does offer and give,
and we take and apply unto our selves by the hand of faith, under the visible
signs of Bread and Wine, Christ and all his benefits; his Body crucified, and
his Blood shed, that they may nourish our souls unto everlasting life;
according to that of our Savior; He that eats my flesh, and drinks my
blood, dwells in me, and I in him; and again, He that eats my flesh, and
drinks my blood, has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
Now the more that this our union with Christ is strengthened and confirmed, the
more powerfully do we perform all Christian duties, seeing from him all grace
is communicated unto us, and all virtue and quickening life, whereby we are
enabled to bring forth the fruits of holiness and righteousness. Secondly,
it strengthens us unto all good duties, as it is a special means for the
strengthening and increasing of our faith, which was the chief end for which
it was ordained. For seeing the Lord has not only committed his Covenant to
writing, but for the further ratification of it, has annexed unto it his
seals, the Sacraments, there is now no place left to doubting; seeing it is
impossible that the Lord, who is Truth it self, and his promises, Yea, and
Amen, should fail 2. Cor. 1. 20.
in any of them, being thus established and confirmed. In which regard, the
Apostle calls the Sacraments, the seals of the righteousness of faith, Romans
4. 11.
because as seals, amongst men, are annexed to writings, to give them
security, and better assurance of the performing of Covenants agreed on
between them: so the Lord has instituted his Sacraments, and annexed them to
his Covenant, not to confirm it, which is so infallible, that it needs no
confirmation, but to strengthen our feeble and weak faith, which needs all
helps and means to keep it from wavering. Now the more our faith is
confirmed, the more rich we grow in all saving graces, seeing it is the
fountain from which they flow, and the more we abound in all holy duties, and
fruits of new obedience, seeing it is the root from which they spring.

. Sect. 7 Thirdly, because it is the spiritual food and nourishment of our
souls.
Thirdly, because the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is the spiritual food of
our souls, whereby they are nourished and strengthened in life Ioh. 6. 55.
and grace unto eternal salvation, even as our bodies are nourished with
corporal food, and thereby strengthened and enabled for all actions and
employments: So our Savior says; My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is
drink indeed; not to feed the body, but to comfort the soul, to preserve our
spiritual life, and to strengthen us unto all duties of holiness and
righteousness. And as the bodily life languisheth, and strength decays, if
we refuse our corporal nourishment; so the vigor and life of our souls
cannot continue, if we feed not upon Christ by faith; according to that
vehement asseueration of our Savior; Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ioh. 6.
53.
except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no
life in you. Yea, this Supper of the Lord is not such a spare meal, and bare
Commons, as only holds life and soul together, and does not revive the
spirits, increase the strength, and fit us for action and employment; but it is
a plentiful feast for our souls, which makes us grow in grace and spiritual
strength and stature, unto a perfect age in Christ, making them strong and
vigorous unto all Christian duties of Gods service. Whereof it is, that as
Baptism is called the Sacrament of our imitation and new birth, so this of our
augmentation and growth in grace; affording unto us plentiful nourishment for
this end. For as God is so bountiful in affording man means for the
preserving his bodily life, that he allows him such things, not only which
are absolutely necessary, but also for delight, and not bread alone to
strengthen man's heart, but also wine to make it glad, and oil, to express
this joy in the face and countenance. So he has dealt Psa. 104. 14. and 115.
much more bountifully for our souls, providing for their nourishment a
plentiful feast, the strengthening Bread of Christ's Body, and the cheering and
gladding Wine of his precious Blood, the delicious viands and dishes of his
spiritual benefits, and saving graces, and sweet comforts of his holy Spirit;
and not only sets these things before us to look upon, but gives unto us
gracious entertainment, inuiting us to feed upon them, not only unto
necessity, but also to delight. So that our welcome is no less worth then our
cheer, and (as the Spouse speaks) his love better Cant. 1. 2.
then wine. Yea, unto his feast he adds a banquet of spiritual comforts,
embracing us with the arms of his love, cheering us with the consolations of
his Spirit, and rauishing our souls with the sweet feelings of his favor, and
such inward joy; that being with the Spouse thus brought into Cant. 2. 4, 5, 6.
his Banketting-house, and having for a Canopie over our heads, his Banners of
love, we are ready, as it were in an ecstasy to cry out, Stay me with flagons,
comfort me with Apples, for I am sick of love. Now how can our poor souls,
being thus royally feasted and cherished at the Supper of the great King, but
be inwardly replenished with all thankfulness toward God for his so rich
mercies? What can they do less, then enter into a serious consideration with
themselves, what they may return unto God, that they may express their love
and gracefulness, for so many and inestimable favors, without any desert
vouchsafed unto them; saying with the Prophet David, What shall I render unto
the Lord for all his benefits toward Ps. 116. 12, 13.
me? And finding themselves to be utterly unable to make any other requital,
then by remaining thankful debtors, what can they do less then conclude with
him, that they will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the Name of the
Lord, praising and magnifying his mercies in the sight of all the people? And
finding our selves preserved in spiritual life, grown 1. Pet. 1. 18.
in Gods graces, and strengthened and fitted for all good employment, by the
royal bounty of our heavenly King, feasting us with such cordial
restoratiues, and delicious food, above the price of silver or gold, or any
other corruptible thing; how ungrateful should we be, if we did not employ
this strength which he has given us in the duties of his service, that we may
glorify his holy Name, and be accepted of him, by doing that which is
pleasing in his sight?

. Sect. 8 Fourthly, because it is an action which we do in remembrance of
Christ.
Fourthly, the right use of the Lords Supper much conduces unto a godly life,
as it is an action which we do in remembrance of Christ, and are thereby put
in mind how much he has done and suffered for us. For who can lightly esteem
of any sin, which cost Christ no less then the price of his precious blood?
Who will not bewail his sins past with bitter grief, abhor his present
corruptions with mortal hatred, and utterly renounce and forsake them for the
time to come, who duly considers that they were the nails which fastened our
Savior Christ to the Cross, and that unsupportable weight, which made his
soul heavy to the death, pressed out of his innocent body that bloody sweat,
and extorted from him that lamentable complaint, My God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me? Who will be hired with the base wages of worldly vanities, to
defile his soul again with the filth of sin, which could no otherwise be
cleansed and purged then by the precious blood of Jesus Christ, of infinite more
value then ten thousand worlds? And so on the other side, who can be slack in
the service of so gracious a Savior? or be sparing in his pains to glorify
him, who for his redemption has not spared his dearest blood? Who would not
worship him in all the duties of holiness, who has purchased his happiness
at such a rate as men and Angels were not able to discourse? who is so
unthankfully slothful, that will not spend his sweat in his service, and his
tears, because he cannot spend so much as he should, and even his blood to
make up what is wanting in them both, for him and his sake, that has cleansed
our bodies and souls from the ingrained spots, and incurable leprosy of
sin, with his bloody sweat, yea full streams of his precious blood? Who
will now grudge to do works of mercy, or to feed the poor members of Jesus
Christ with his spare food, and to clothe them with his cast apparel; which
remembers that this bread of life came down from heaven to be our food, and
has not spared to feast us at his own royal Table, with his own body and
blood for our spiritual nourishment unto eternal life? that he who is the
lively and express Image of his Father, and equal unto him in glory and
Majesty, dis-roabed himself of this glorious garment, and took upon him the
shape of a servant, yea was content to be stripped of those poor clothes he
had suiting with his mean condition, and whilst he bore our sins, to bear
our shame, hanging naked upon the Cross, that he might clothe us that were
spiritually naked, with the rich and glorious robe of his righteousness and
obedience?

. Sect. 9 Because thereby we are occasioned to renew our Covenant with God.
Finally, the Lords Supper rightly used, is a notable means, to confirm and
strengthen us unto all duties of a godly life; because it gives us occasion in
our preparation, (that we may come as worthy ghests to the Lords Table) to
renew our Covenant with God, by renewing our faith in Christ, our repentance
for our sins, our love toward God and our neighbors, and all other saving
graces in us. We renew our faith, by meditating upon Gods infinite mercies, and
Christ's all-sufficient merits, the gracious and indefinite promises of the
Gospel, and the truth and omnipotency of God, whereby he is willing and able
to perform them; upon Gods Commandment, inioyning us to believe, and his
bounty and goodness, in giving his Word and Sacraments made effectual by his
Spirit, whereby he inableth us to do that which he commands. We renew upon
this occasion our repentance also, by bewailing our sins past, and
strengthening our resolution, to leave and forsake them for the time to come,
and to serve God in the contrary duties of holiness and righteousness. And
seeing our great wants and imperfections in all Gods graces and Christian
duties, we promise and vow in our selves, and unto God, that we will carefully
use all good means whereby we may attain unto them in more perfection. So
likewise after the receiving of this Sacrament, we take occasion to examine
our selves, how we have profited and increased in spiritual strength and
growth of grace, by being feasted at the Lords Table with this food of our
souls; and being mindful of our promises made before we come to the Lords
Table, we become more diligent in using the means whereby Gods graces may be
perfited in us, and we strengthened unto all good duties. And that we may not
appear to be Couenant-breakers with God, and to have received his grace in
vain, we are made more careful and conscionable in looking to all our ways,
for the avoiding of all those sins wherewith formerly we have been
overtaken, and practizing those duties which we have heretofore neglected, and
so to carry our selves in the whole course of our lives, that we may at all
times and in all things please the Lord, whom we have found and felt so
gracious unto us. In all which respects, who does not plainly see, that the
often resorting to the Lords Table, if we come unto it duly prepared, is a
most effectual means to enrich us with all Gods graces, and to strengthen us
unto all good duties of a godly life? And therefore they are most injurious
unto their own souls, who seldom come to this spiritual feast, and take
every slight occasion of defrauding them of their due food, seeing hereby they
make them droope in their spiritual life, to languish and wax faint in all
saving grace, and to become utterly, both unable and unwilling, to perform
unto God any sincere and cheerful service.

CAP. VIII.
Of the third public means of a godly life, which is Prayer.

. Sect. 1 That prayer is Gods ordinance to obtain his gifts and graces.
THe third means whereby we may be enriched with all saving grace, and
strengthened unto all the duties of a godly life, is Prayer; Of which I shall
not need to say much in this place, having before entreated of it at large.
Only it shall suffice to show, that it is a singular means ordained of God,
for the obtaining of grace and strength to serve God in all Christian duties.
For of our selves we have no ability unto any thing that is good, no not so
much as to think a good thought, or to entertain into our hearts 2. Cor. 3.
5. Phil. 2. 13.
a good desire, but whatsoever we have in this kind, it is the gift of God,
according to that, What have thou that thou have not received? and that of the
1. Cor. 4. 7.
Apostle James; Every good and perfect gift is from above, and comes down
from the Father of lights. Now the means which God has sanctified for Iam. 1.
17.
the obtaining of all those gifts and graces which he has promised, is fervent
and effectual Prayer; for though he be most bountiful and ready to bestow all
good things, yet not to the idle and slothful, but to such as acknowledging
them to be his gifts, do sue and seek unto him for them; and though he
infinitely abound with all blessings, yet he communicates them only to those
that crave them at his hands; according to that of the Apostle; The same Lord
over all, is rich unto all that call upon him: and that Romans 10. 12.
of the Psalmist; The Lord is near unto all those that call upon him, to those
that call upon him in truth. And the reason is, because such only do glorify
Psalm. 145. 18.
him in his gifts, seeing those alone, who have obtained his blessing by
Prayer, will acknowledge him the Author of them, and return unto him to give
him thanks. Hence it is, that being willing to bestow all good things upon his
children, and unwilling that they should neglect their duty, or have them
without suite; and taking delight to converse with them, he withholdeth his
gifts till they ask them, that they may have this occasion to resort unto him.
And because through their negligence, he would not keep from them any thing,
which he knows good and necessary, ouer-long; like a most loving, yet wise
Father, he leaves not the matter to our own foolish and wayward will, but by
express commandment inioyneth us to call upon him, and incourageth us in
these our suites by promising beforehand, that he will hear and grant them.
Ask (says he) and ye Mat. 7. 7.
shall have, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you. And
again; Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.
Ask, and ye Ioh. 16. 23.
shall receive, that your joy may be full. So the Apostle tells us, that this
is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to
his 1. Ioh. 5. 14, 15.
will, he hears us; and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask, we
know also that we have the petitions that we desired of him. In which regard,
the Apostle exhorts, that we should be careful for nothing (namely, with a
Phil. 4. 6.
carking and distrustful care) but that in every thing, by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving, we should make our requests known unto God.
In which regard, the Lord may be truly said to be the Author of all good
gifts, and Prayer, the hand whereby we knock at the door of his grace, and
when it is opened, receive his blessings from him. He the lively and
inexhaustible fountain of all good; and Prayer, the bucket whereby we draw it
from him. He, a rich treasury of all grace and desirable riches; and Prayer,
the key that opens it unto us, in the Name and mediation of Jesus Christ. To
this purpose, one of the Ancients speaks fitly; Prayer (says Chrysostom. de
orando Deum. l. Tom. 5. Col. 692.
he) in an admirable manner conduces to a holy life, and worthy Gods service,
and being begun, does much improoue it, and like a treasure, storeth it up in
our minds. For if any man indeuoureth to do any thing belonging to a right
course of life, Prayer being his guide, and preparing the way before him, he
shall be sure to find a commodious and easy passage, etc. And it is a sign
of madness, not to be persuaded that it is the death of the soul, if we do
not often cast down our selves at Gods feet. As the body without the soul is
a dead carrion: so the soul, if it flee not to God by Prayer, is dead,
miserable, and loathsome.

. Sect. 2 That by prayer we obtain Gods Spirit and the graces thereof.
More specially, Prayer is the chief means on our part, whereby we obtain
his spiritual gifts and graces, by which we are enabled to perform Luke 11.
13.
the duties of a godly life: For by it we obtain the Spirit of God, who is the
Author of all grace and godliness, seeing, as our Savior has taught us, the
Lord will give his Spirit to those that ask it. And if we want the graces of
the Spirit, the Scriptures admonish us to use Prayer, as a special and chief
means whereby we may obtain them. So the Apostle James; If any man want
wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, Iam. 1. 5.
and vpbraideth not, and it shall be given him. And the Apostle to the the
Hebrews, sets us in this course for the obtaining of all grace; Let Heb. 4.
16.
us (says he) come boldly to the throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy,
and find grace to help in time of need. Yea, these spiritual graces, whereby
we are enabled to serve God in all holy duties, are things absolutely good for
us in some degree and measure; and therefore we may absolutely pray for them,
without interposing any condition; first, because our heavenly Father is so
infinitely gracious and true of his promise, that he will deny nothing unto us
that is good; and therefore much less these things which are most necessary,
and in an high degree of goodness. For if we being Math. 7. 11.
evil, know how to give good gifts unto our children, how much more shall our
Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? Secondly,
because he has commanded us to pray for these spiritual graces; and therefore
it is not to be imagined, that the God of all bounty and goodness, would ever
have enjoined us to ask those things, which he is unwilling to give: neither
will any wise father draw his children to come with suits unto him, by giving
them repulses; only it may be, that the Lord, to enlarge our hearts, and to
make our desires more fervent and earnest, does for a time withold these
graces, at least in respect of our sense and feeling; but if we persevere in
prayer, and continue importunate Luke 18. 1, 7.
suitors, we are sure to obtain them in the end, and that in greater measure,
seeing he that by holding his hand back has enlarged our desires, and made us
more empty and hungry, has promised also to fill and satisfy us. To which
purpose Augustine speaks excellently; So long Quamdiu Deus non tollit a to
crationem tuam, non amouebit a te misericordiam suam, etc.
(says he) as the Lord does not take away from thee thy prayer, he will not
remove from thee his mercy; for he that gives thee his Spirit, that thou may
pray, will also give unto thee that, which by help of the same Spirit thou
do desire. By all which it appears, that prayer is a principal means to
obtain all grace and strength at Gods hands, for the well performing of all
holy duties. Whereof it is, that the Saints in all ages have so ordinarily used
it for this end, in the behalf both of themselves and others. So David, in
many places of the Psalms: Show me thy ways, O Psalm. 25. 4, 5. and 119. 32,
33.
Lord, and teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me. Teach me,
O Lord, the way of thy Commandments, and I shall keep them unto the end. And
the Apostle Paul; The Lord make you to increase, etc. to the end he may
stablish 1. These. 3. 13. and 5. 23.
your hearts unblameable in holiness before God; And the very God of peace
sanctify you wholly, and I pray God your whole spirit, and soul and body, may
be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Whereas
without prayer there is no hope of any growth in grace; for as in nature all
things that grow have in them an appetite and attractiue force, wherewith they
draw that nourishment unto themselves, whereby they come to growth and
augmentation: so in the spiritual growth, none receive any increase of grace,
but they who have an appetite and spiritual desires, which they express by
the attractiue force of prayer, whereby they draw from God, the fountain of
all goodness, spiritual nourishment, and all things needful to the
furthering of their growth in Christ.

. Sect. 3 That public prayer is most effectual for the obtaining of all Gods
graces.
Now as prayer generally is a notable means to further us in all duties of a
godly life; so especially that which is public, when as many of Gods Saints
and servants being met together in his holy Assemblies, do jointly with one
heart and voice, implore the gracious assistance of his good Spirit, whereby
they may be enabled to serve him in all Christian duties. For if the prayers of
one alone do offer unto God an holy kind of violence, (as we see in the
example of Moses) so as he seems unable to deny Exodus 32. 10.
and reject them, because he has graciously bound himself, by his free and
infallible promises, to hear and grant them; how powerful must the prayers of
the whole Congregation needs be to prevail with God, in any suit made
according to his will, seeing he has tied himself to hear and help them by
more special promise; according to that of our Savior, If two of you shall
agree on earth, as touching any thing that they shall Mat. 18. 19, 20.
ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two
or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. So
the Lord has promised that he will cause his servants to rejoice in the
granting of their suits by special favor, which they shall make unto him in
his own House: I will bring them (says he) to mine holy Mountain, and Esa.
56. 7.
make them joyful in my House of prayer; their burnt offerings and sacrifices
shall be accepted upon mine Altar; for mine House shall be called an House of
prayer for all people.

Upon which promises made by God, Solomon, at the consecration of the 1. King.
8. 30, 33
Temple, groundeth his prayer, that the Lord would in special manner hear the
suits and supplications of his servants publicly assembled in his Temple to
call upon him. And hereof it is that the Apostle contenteth not himself with
his own prayers, or the private suits of others, that he might still be
preserved for the service of God, and of his Church, but desires that the
Church of Corinth should join together in prayer for him, that the gift
bestowed upon him by the means of many persons, might give 2. Cor. 1. 10, 11.
occasion unto many, of giving thanks also in his behalf. For as much fuel
and fire laid together, does make the flame and heat so much the more
vehement; and many small streams meeting in the same channel, grow great and
irresistable: So the fire and fuel of our zealous and fervent prayers joined
together in the public Congregation, makes a flame that scorning all stop,
mounteth up to heaven; and when we jointly power out our souls before God,
like many waters met in one current, they have the force of a great torrent and
irresistable flood, which bear down all before them, and never stay, till
falling into that infinite Ocean of all mercy and goodness, they are
graciously received and accepted of him. And therefore let no man proudly
attribute so much unto his private devotion, that he should be moved thereby to
neglect the public prayers of the Congregation, as needless and of less
efficacy; seeing they are a much more principal and potent means to prevail
with God, then our private and proud devotions, scorning such excellent helps,
which may well kindle in us that elementary and flashing flame of blind and
ungrounded zeal, which lasting but a while, serves for no use, but to set the
Church on fire with hurtful Schisms and furious contentions, but will never
kindly warm our hearts with that heavenly heat of fervent zeal, which makes
us fit and forward unto all Christian duties, and the substantial parts of
Gods service. In which regard I may well say to such, as proudly presuming of
the strength of their own devotions, thus single themselves from the
Congregation by their private duties; as the Wise man in another case; Woe unto
him that is alone; for if he falls, and fails in this duty, Eccles. 4. 10.
through want of attention, and wandering thoughts, faintness of faith, and
lack of feruency, there is none by to help him; whereas praying in the
Congregation, we mutually supply one another defects, one being devoutly
diligent, when another grows cold and remissely negligent, and he rising
again, as ashamed of his foyles and falls, and recovering the feruor of his
zeal and devotion, requiteth the other with his assistance, when he begins
to faint and grow weary. Herein like unto soldiers, who being singled from one
another, are easily overcome, but joined in a battle, do mutually second and
succor one another, one fighting, when the other faints, and he with renewed
strength giving a fresh charge, bringgeth of the other far engaged, when
through weakness and weariness he is able no longer to bear the brunt. And
thus much of the third public means of a godly life, to wit, prayer.
Concerning the fourth and last, which is the reading of the Scriptures, I will
speak when I come to entreat of private reading, because many things to be
spoken are coincident to both, and I would not distract them in my Discourse.
Only let it be remembered, that whatsoever can be said of the benefit and
efficacy of private reading, is in a higher degree of excellency verified in
that which is public, because being a ministerial function, ordained of God,
for the common good of the whole Church, and every particular Congregation, it
is more powerful to all good uses then private reading, Gods more special
blessing by the inward operation of his holy Spirit, always more effectually
accompanying his more excellent and public ordinances, then such as are
private, and of an inferior nature. And therefore as the Word publicly
preached is more powerful and profitable, then a Sermon privately read in our
own houses (as I have showed) not in regard of the substance or matter
contained in both, nor only in respect of elocution and action (wherein
preaching excels reading) but chiefly because Gods blessing accompanyeth
more effectually that ordinance unto which he has given the preeminence; so by
the same reason, public reading is to be preferred before private, not only
because the Minister ordinarily reads with more judgment and understanding,
more plainly and distinctly, giving every word and sentence their due weight,
emphasis and accent, and thereby giving such light to the understanding, and
life to the affections of the hearers, that such reading is not much inferior
to a mean comment; but chiefly and principally (as I said) because it is a
ministerial function, upon which we may expect a larger blessing then upon our
own private actions. The which I touch by the way, to show unto those their
error in judgment, and fault in practice, who highly esteem, and diligently
exercise themselves in their own private reading of the Scriptures, and yet so
despise public reading in the Congregation, that they will hardly, or not at
all vouchsafe their presence, or if that, yet not their reverent and diligent
attention.

CAP. IX.
Of the private means of a godly life: and first of Christian watchfulness.

. Sect. 1 That we must not rest upon the public means only, but use the
private also.
But howsoever, we are to ascribe to the public means, the chief
preeminence, as being of greater virtue and efficacy, for the enriching of our
souls with all saving grace, and strengthening of them unto all Christian
duties of a godly life: yet we must in any case take heed, that we do not
(as it is the custom of many cold and careless Christians) content our selves
with them alone, and rest upon them as being alone sufficient for all purposes.
But we must also with no less diligence, care and good conscience, adioyne
unto them the use of private means to help us forward in our spiritual
growth. First, because God has enjoined us the use of them as well as of the
public, and the Saints from time to time, yielding obedience herein unto God,
have made them their daily exercise, as we shall see when we come to speak of
them in particular. Secondly, because they add strength to our faith, and
fuel to our devotion, whereby we are enabled to perform unto God public
service with more life and zeal, delight and profit: whereas if we neglect
private duties all the week, and suffer our hearts to be taken up with worldly
things, they will be quite out of frame for spiritual exercises, and hardly
brought unto any religious duties of Gods service. But when we present our
bodies in the Congregation, we shall leave our hearts at home, about our
earthly affairs, and drawing near unto God with our lips, shall in the mean
time have our hearts far removed from him; offering unto him a dead and
formal, cold and Esa. 29. 13.
heartlesse service, wherein he takes no delight. Thirdly, because Gods
public service cannot sometime be inioyed at all, as in the days of
persecution, and is always stinted and limited to one or few days in the
week, when as our souls, no less then our bodies, need their daily bread,
and to be refreshed continually in their spiritual strength, which is abated
through our natural corruption, and many slips and falls into sin, as also
with the daily and hourly tentations of the devil and the world. In which
respect these private means have this preeminence above the public, that
though they are not so powerful, and yield less nourishment; yet we may have
them at our pleasure, and feed upon them as often as we will, supplying what is
wanting in their virtue and efficacy, by their daily and continual use.
Finally, by the private means we are fitted and prepared for the
well-performing of the public; as by reading, prayer, meditation, etc. we are
enabled to hear the Word preached, with profit, seeing they not only enlarge
our hearts, that we may hear it with delight, reverence and attention, but
also fasten it in our minds and memories, and make it fruitful in our lives;
and not only help our understandings, that we may better conceive of what is
spoken, being well acquainted with the holy Scriptures, but also inflame our
affections with the love of Gods public service, when as we have thought
beforehand of the excellency, profit and necessity of it. So likewise by these
private means we are made more fit for public prayer; whereas thereby we are
made better acquainted with our wants which need supply, our sins to be
confessed, and the benefits received, for which we are bound to return unto
God praise and thanksgiving; and by often conuersing with God in our private
prayers, we are more encouraged to go with boldness and confidence unto the
Throne of grace; unto which we cannot attain, if we estrange our selves from
him, by our seldom approaching into his presence. Finally, we cannot come as
worthy ghests to the Lords Table, unless by our private exercises of
meditation, examination, and prayer we be prepared, whereby we renew our
faith, repentance and charity toward our neighbors, and come furnished with
such saving graces as are needful and necessary for the receiving of the
Sacrament with fruit and comfort. And therefore it is no marvel if those who
content themselves only with the public means of salvation, and altogether
neglect these private helps, leaving all their Religion and devotion at the
Church door, and never looking after it till their next return, do prove
such vnthriuing Christians, weak in knowledge, feeble in grace, and slack and
faint in all the duties of a Christian life. For as we would not wonder to see
one lean and feeble in body, that should content himself with liberal
sustenance one day in the week, and fast all the rest: so there is as little
cause to marvel at the small growth, spiritual leanness, and weakness of
these careless Christians, after they have long inioyed the public means of
salvation; seeing they rest wholly upon them, and neglect all private duties
(as it were) their daily sustenance, and so by long fasting are infeebled in
their strength, and abated in their appetite, that they can neither receive the
food publicly offered, nor yet digest and turn it into nourishment when they
have fed upon it. Whereas our souls need more continual and daily nourishment
then our bodies, seeing there are no fewer causes of the impairing and abating
of their strength.

. Sect. 2 That Christian watchfulness is not a bodily, but a spiritual
exercise.
Now these private means are manifold: All which may be reduced unto two
kinds, both which contain under them diverse particulars: the first are such
private helps and means as are to be used by our selves alone; the second
sort are such as may be used both by our selves, and also with others joining
with us. Of the former sort; the first is Christian vigilance or watchfulness,
which well deserves the first place, because being rightly known and
practiced, it will serve as a guide to direct and lead us in all the rest.
Whereof my discourse need not to be so large, as the argument is excellent and
necessary, seeing it is so religiously and learnedly The spiritual watch.
handled in a Treatise lately published, that were not this Work imperfect
without it, I should have needed to have said nothing of it, seeing little can
be added, which has not been better said already. But that we may proceed in
handling of this point, I will consider the nature of this watchfulness, and
the means which enable us unto it. In the former, we will examine what it is,
and wherein it consists, and the ends whereto it tends, or the objects
about which it is exercised. For the better explaning of the first point, we
are to know, that waking, watching and watchfulness, and contrariwise,
sleeping, and neglect of watching, are not here used in their native and proper
signification, but are metaphorical words, borrowed from the state and
disposition of our bodies, and from thence transferred to our souls and
spiritual estate. For we are said to sleep, whilst we continue in the state
of unregeneration, dead in trespasses and sins, or when being recovered by
the quickening power of Gods Spirit, regenerating and reviving us, we do, in
respect of some acts and operations, relapse again into our former condition.
And we are then said to awake, when we rise out of this estate, either in our
first conversion, or when we renew our repentance, after our falling into
sin, and do again recover the operations of spiritual life. And finally,
we are said to watch, when being, through our natural corruption, inclined
and disposed to fall into our former sleep of sin, we do with all care and
circumspection observe our selves, that we be not overtaken with spiritual
sloth, but that we may continue waking, and able and active for the
well-performing of all Christian duties, and of our spiritual life in grace.
In which regard, their ignorance and error is much to be pitied, who imagine
that they have well observed and kept the Christian watch, unto which we are
exhorted in the Scriptures, when as having abridged themselves of their sleep
and natural rest, they have thereby wasted and wearied their bodies, and
weakened their corporal strength; this error arising out of another, that the
flesh (by which the Scriptures understand our original and natural
corruption, the body of sin and death) is nothing else but the body it self,
and that mortification of the flesh, consists chiefly in the macerating and
tormenting, pining and pinching of our bodies, by depriving them of all
necessaries, and among others, of their natural rest and sleep; the which
error I have at large refuted in Christian warfare, the fourth part.
another place. But we are to know, that as we may nourish the flesh, and
consume the body; and contrariwise, nourish the body, and mortify the flesh:
so we may take our bodily sleep (as all the faithful have done in the state
of Regeneration) and yet maintain the spiritual watch; and watch even whole
nights, as Judas that betrayed Christ, the soldiers at Joh. 24. 14, 15.
his Sepulcher, and thieves and adulterers, that lie in wait to make spoil of
their neighbors goods and chastity, and yet sleep and snort in the deep
lethargy of sin and wickedness. So that it is not the bodily watchfulness
or sleep that is commanded or forbidden; for of this, as of all of like kind,
the Apostles saying is verified, namely, that bodily exercise profits little;
yea it hurts much, if we rest in it as the deed done, or do it as a work
satisfactory and meritorious; not subduing the flesh, but puffing it up with
pride and presumption, nor inabling us to Gods service, but making the body
unfit to be a ready instrument for the soul, whilst by immoderate watching
it is weakened and infeebled, and becomes more dull and drowzie, more lumpish
and vncheerfull to all good duties of a godly life.

. Sect. 3 The former point proved by the Scriptures.
And yet I deny not but that there may be good use of bodily watching, when as
it is moderate and seasonable, not only in respect of civil and moral
affairs, as the dispatching of our necessary business, ministering to our
friends upon their bed of sickness, and such like, but also as it conduces
unto spiritual ends; as when it furthereth us in keeping our spiritual watch,
and is not rested in as a bodily exercise, but referred and destinated to an
holy and religious end. As when with David, Paul, and Silas Act. 12 12. and 20.
7.
we abridge our selves of sleep, that we may praise God by singing of
Psalms, or lifting up in silence our thankful hearts unto God for
extraordinary benefits; or when with our Savior Christ, and his Church in
persecution, we spend the night in prayer and other religious exercises. And
thus our Savior requires of his Apostles bodily watchfulness to a spiritual
end; Watch and pray (says he) that ye fall not into tentation. But yet the
Christian waking and watching, which in the Scriptures is so much commended
unto us, is not corporal, but spiritual, or only corporal, so far forth
as the Spiritual thereby may be advanced and furthered. For which the Word of
God is so clear, that it needs not the light of any other Comment; Awake thou
that sleep, and arise up from the dead, and Christ Ephesians. 5. 14, 15, 16
shall give thee light. Out of which sleep of sin when they are awakened, he
exhorts them to keep the Christian watch: See then that ye walk
circumspectly, Col. 4. 2.
not as fools, but as wise; redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
And again, Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving. So
having Ephesians. 6. 18.
commended unto us the spiritual armor, he wills us to pray always, and
watch thereunto with all perseverance. And yet more plainly, Awake to
righteousness, 1. Cor. 15. 34. and 16. 13.
and sin not. Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quite your selves like men,
be strong. Neither does the Apostle inhibit bodily sleep and natural rest,
but carnal security and sleep in sin. Ye are (says he) children of light
1. These. 5. 5, 6, 7, 8.
and of the day; not of night, nor of darkness; therefore let us not sleep,
as do others, but let us watch and be sober, etc. putting on the breast plate
of faith and love, and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.

. Sect. 4 What the Christian watchfulness is.
By all which it appears, that the Christian watchfulness which is commended
unto us in the Scriptures, is not bodily and natural, but supernatural and
spiritual. Now let us consider in the next place what it is, and wherein it
consists. Concerning the former: The Christian and spiritual watch, is an
heedfull observation of our selves in all things, and a serious, careful, and
diligent circumspection over all our ways, that we may please God by doing
his will, and neither commit any sin which he has forbidden, nor omit any
duty which he has commanded. The which description sets forth unto us the
nature of the Christian watch, as it is commended unto us in the holy
Scriptures. Thus the Lord inioyning this watch by Moses the Captain of his
people, says; Take heed to thy self, and keep thy soul diligently, lest
thou forget Deuteronomy. 4. 9, 23.
the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thine heart,
all the days of thy life. And our Savior prescribing it, does express it in
these words, Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when Mar. 13. 33,
34.
the time is; watch ye therefore, lest coming suddenly he find you
sleeping. So the Apostle expounds that phrase, of awaking out of sleep, and
arising Ephesians. 5. 14, 15, 16
from the dead, in the next words; See that ye walk circumspectly, not as
fools, but as wise; redeeming the time, because the days are evil. And
exhorting the Watchmen of the Church, to keep diligently this watch, he
wills them to take heed unto themselves, and to all the flock, over which,
Act. 20. 28, 31.
the holy Ghost had made them overseers to feed the Church of God, which he had
purchased with his blood.

. Sect. 5 That this watch is to be kept in all things.
Now if we would know wherein this observation and circumspection consists,
and in what it is to be used and exercised; the Apostle tells us, that it
must not be in some few things only, the rest being neglected, but in all
things whatsoever; Watch thou in all things; so that we must keep 2. Tim. 4.
5.
this watch at all times, in all places, upon all occasions, when we are alone,
and when we are in company, abroad and at home, in the works of our callings,
and in our recreations, when we have to deal with others, and when we are
exercised in our own business; in civil affairs and moral actions, and in
our religious duties which we perform unto God, as hearing, reading, praying,
meditating; according to that of our Savior; Take heed how ye hear, watch and
pray. And seeing the devil lays baits Luke 8. 18.
and snares to catch us in all places and in all things, we must be very
heedfull and circumspect, that we do not fall into his nets of perdition. When
we are alone, we must take heed that we be not idle and unprofitable, wholly
taken up with worldly thoughts and sinful imaginations, nor overtaken by
Satan's tentations, enticing us to the committing of secret sins, seeing
solitude exempteth us from the fear, either of shame or punishment. When we
are to go into company, we must look to our selves, that we be not corrupted
with evil examples, and vain and rotten communication, and that we do not
thus corrupt others, but edify them by our sauoury speeches, and holy
conversation. When we look to be taken up in Christian conferences, we must
watch over our selves, that we fall not, through self-love ouer-weening our
own gifts, into pride and vainglory, nor through pride break out into anger
and contention. When we go to compound differences between neighbors, we must
take heed, that we be not partial to either side for worldly respects, nor
through stiffenesse and obstinacy, cause more discord in stead of making
peace. When we are going to a feast, let us set a watch over our appetite, that
it do not draw us to gluttony and excess; but that we so use Gods greater
blessings, as that we be fitted by them to do him better service. When we are
about to do the works of mercy, we must take heed of pride and affectation of
humane praises, or that we have in them any opinion of meriting thereby any
thing at Gods hands. When we are to pray, or hear the Word, or to perform any
other religious duty of Gods service, knowing that in them also Satan lays
his snares, and spares for no pains to make these exercises unprofitable, and
even turn them into sin; let us observe our watch when we go about them,
that we may be well prepared, and perform them with all reverence and
attention, faith and feruencie of spirit, carefully looking to our minds and
hearts, that they be not hindered in these duties with worldly distractions,
and wandering thoughts, dullness, drowzinesse, and carnal weariness. In a
word, there is nothing wherein this watch is not to be kept, seeing in all
things, through Satan's wiles, and the deceitfulness of our own hearts, we
are endangered unto sin; either sailing in the matter of our actions, or in
our manner of doing them.

. Sect. 6 That we must watch over all the powers and parts of our souls and
bodies.
Neither must this watch be kept over some of our parts only, neglecting the
rest, as over the body alone, but not the soul, or the soul, and not the
body, but over the whole man, that in all our powers and parts, inward
faculties and outward actions, we may please God by doing his will. But yet the
more accurate and diligent watch must be over the soul, as being the more
subtle and excellent part, according to that express charge of Almighty God;
Take heed to thy self, and keep thy soul diligently: implying, that though
this watch must be kept over the whole man, yet Deuteronomy. 4. 9.
the soul, which is the better part, must be looked unto with greatest care
and circumspection. Thus we must watch over all the special faculties of our
souls, as over our reason and judgment, that they be not darkened with
ignorance (for if the light be darkness, how great is that darkness?) nor
corrupted and misled into errors and heresies. Over our memories, Mat. 6. 23.
that they neither retain those vanities and sinful impression which should
be rased and blotted out, nor forget those things which God has entrusted to
their keeping. Over our consciences, that they be pure and clean, purged from
dead works, and that they be not slack in doing their duty, in excusing and
accusing, nor we negligent in giving heed to their evidence. Over our wills,
that they go not before, but wait upon holy reason, choosing and embracing
that which it commends, and refusing and rejecting that which it condemns
and dis-alloweth. But especially, we must keep this careful watch over our
minds and imaginations, which naturally are evil, and that continually, being
most disordered and licentious, and not to be kept within any compass, if we
leave them unto their own liberty. And therefore if we would keep our souls
in good plight and free from danger, we must not foolishly imagine that thought
is free, or that we may suffer our fantasies and imaginations to take their
full scope and pleasure, in rouing and ranging which way they list; for if they
thus get the bridle (as it were) between their teeth, they will run with us in
a headlong course into vanity and sin; whereby displeasing God, we shall
move him to give us over to our own imaginations, and to the tentations of
Satan, suggesting into them horrible blasphemies. For when he finds them
(Dina-like) wandering abroad, and from under the guard of Gods protection, he
defloureth and defiles them with hellish pollution, and turns the pleasure
of their liberty into horror and grief. Moreover, by giving liberty to our
thoughts and imaginations to range whither they list, and not accustoming to
keep them in any compass, and within the bounds of Gods fear, we shall not
be able, when we most desire it, to bring them into any order, but they will be
ready to disturb and distract us in our best duties. For like runagate
servants, they will be to seek when we most need them, and be ranging about
worldly vanities, when we would have them wholly exercised in religious
duties. Or if with much pains we do bring them home, and bind them to their
task, being inured to liberty, and delighting themselves in rouing abroad,
they will, to recover their lost pleasure, break all their bonds, run away
from us, and be taken up with worldly cogitations, so as we shall not be able
to hear the Word, or pray, or meditate, or perform any other religious
duties, without being distracted and interrupted in them with these earthly
thoughts and wandering imaginations. From which if we would be free, our best
course is to watch over our cogitations and fantasies at other times, and to
keep them under command, that they may be exercised about things profitable.
For if we usually give them liberty to range whither they list, custom will
cause an habit, and this liberty will grow to licentiousness, so as we shall
reduce them into no order, nor make them fit for any good employment. Neither
is it enough, that we restrain our thoughts from rouing after worldly
vanities, but we must also have them taken up and exercised in spiritual,
heavenly, or at least civil and moral Meditations about the affairs of our
honest callings; for if they be not busied about these, Satan will thrust in
the other, and finding them empty of any good thing, he will easily replenish
them with those that are evil.

. Sect. 7 That we must chiefly watch over our hearts.
But above all other our internal parts, we must keep our watch with greatest
care over our hearts, according to the Wisemans counsel; Above Pro. 4. 23.
Heb. 3. 12.
all keeping, or with all diligence keep thy heart, for out of it are the
issues of life: and the admonition of the Apostle; Take heed, brethren, lest
there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the
living God. For the heart is the treasury either of all good or evil, and out
of it the tongue speaks, and the hand works. It is the fountain of all our
words and actions, and if it be corrupt, it will defile them too; but if it be
cleansed and purified by faith, it will also purify the streams which flow
from it. Act. 15. 9.
It is a vessel apt to receive all liquors good or evil, and therefore our
care must be to replenish it with the best, and then to cover and keep it
close, that nothing be spilt and lost, and lest it receive soil, or have any
evil thing infused into it; for as the Wiseman observed, dead Flies taint the
whole pot of precious ointment. It must be kept carefully as an enclosed Garden
and Vineyard, that all annoyances being kept out with the fence, it may bring
forth good fruits and ripe Grapes pleasing to Gods taste; and not suffered to
lie open as an highway, where all things are trampled underfoot or stolen
away, and nothing suffered to thrive which is profitable for use. Now by heart,
here I chiefly understand all the affections and desires, both concupiscible
and irascible, all the passions of love, hatred, hope, despair, joy, sorrow,
anger, and fear. And by keeping of them, their holding in subjection unto
reason, it self being first made subject to the Word and will of God, and the
right employing of them about their fit and proper objects, only loving that
which is good, and hating that which is evil, rejoicing in the testimonies of
Gods love, and sorrowing for sin, because he is displeased with it, hoping in
Gods mercies, and despairing Psalm. 130. 4.
in our own strength, fearing God, in respect of his mercies and judgments,
and being angry with that only wherewith he is offended and dishonored. And
if we thus keep our hearts in tune and order, they will make sweet music in
Gods hearing; but if the affections and passions rebel against reason, and
fall at variance one with another, we can expect nothing but iarring discords
and tumultuous confusion. If we keep them locked up (as sometime Aeolus the
winds) under the command of reason, our hearts and minds will be calm and
quiet; but set open the gates, and leave them to their liberry, and nothing
will follow, but storms, tempests, and shipwreck of our souls upon the
rocks of sin. Blow away these clouds and foggy mists, and we shall in our
little world have a clear sky, but let them ouer-cast and ouercloud reason,
which is the Sun in our firmament, and what can follow but darkness and
disorder, stumbling and falling at every stone of offense? But especially we
must watch over our hearts, that we may keep out carnal concupiscence from
entering, and that we may withstand and shut the door of our hearts against the
first motions and inclinations unto sin; even as we would keep out of our
houses in the plague time, infectious air; or in the time of war, our mighty
and malicious enemies from entering into our City or Country. Or if they be
entered at unawares, we must repel them presently, at their first appearing
upon our Coast, and give them no time to fortify and make themselves strong;
we must crush this Cockatrice in the shell, and when they are young, dash this
Babylonish brood against the stones.

. Sect. 8 That we must chiefly cleanse and keep our hearts from those
corruptions which are most dangerous.
Now as we must observe a careful watch in keeping out, or clensing our
hearts from all sin and corruption, so above all, that they do not nourish
in them such as are most dangerous to our souls health. As first and
principally we must beware of those sins and vices, unto which, through our
natural corruption we are most inclined, the which we shall discern by our
often falling into them, by our lothnesse to leave them, and after we have
resolved to part with them, and have already broken from them by unfeigned
repentance, by our hanging after them in our carnal love, which makes us,
after we are forced to leave them for the safety of our souls, to look back
unto them (like Lots wife toward Sodom) with a desire to return, were we not
beaten from them with the fear of Gods Judgments. By which signs, when we
have discovered them, we must with greatest care watch over our hearts, that
we be not again overtaken of them; first, because we have greatest cause to
hate and abhor them, seeing by them we have most dishonored and displeased
God. Secondly, because they have most often wounded our consciences, and given
us the greatest foyles. Thirdly, because they have most disturbed our inward
peace, and deprived our hearts of spiritual joy in the assurance of Gods love.
Fourthly, because we are still most prone to fall into them, by reason that our
corrupt natures are so much inclined toward them; and our carnal love doting
upon them, are ready upon all occasions to renew their league and give them
entertainment. And therefore as with greatest care and vigilance, we arm our
selves against such enemies, as have a strong party in our own City, and many
secret Traitors, which are always ready to open the gates and let them in; so
must we keep the narrowest watch, and bend our chiefest force against such
sins as our flesh and carnal lusts do most affect, and are in greatest
league and liking with them, seeing these secret Traitors are still in
readiness to give them entertainment, and betray our souls unto them, if we
do but a little intermit our spiritual watch. Secondly, we must with singular
circumspection take heed of those vices and sins, which do most ordinarily
wait upon our special callings, seeing by reason that we are daily
conversant in them, they do make against our souls most often and fierce
assaults; and the rather, because by our many foyles and falls they become
customable, and harden our hearts in them, our often sinning searing the
conscience, and taking away the sense of sin. And thus Magistrates must watch
over themselves, that they do not pervert judgment, by taking bribes and
rewards, and that they have no respect of persons, nor for fear or favor do
any injustice. Thus Lawyers must take special heed, that they do not for
their fees blind the eyes of the Judge by their false and corrupt pleading,
paynting over a foul cause with fair glosses, and that they do not protract
suites, that they may grow rich out of their Clyents poverty. And Physicians,
that they do not deal unfaithfully with their patients, and delay the cure
for their own advantage. And Divines, that they do not for worldly lucre
become non-residents, staruing their peoples souls, to fill their own purses,
and purchase fields with the price of blood: And that they be not slothful
and negligent in feeding their souls that are committed to their charge,
following Peter's counsel to Christ; Master, spare thy self. And Tradesmen,
that they do not use deceit in buying and selling, nor tell untruths, to put
off their wares at an higher rate. And finally, thus must Artificers watch over
themselves, that they do not their work deceitfully, only for sale, and
unserviceable for use. Unto which special circumspection, in respect of our
callings and the sins incident unto them, the Scriptures exhort. Thus John
the Baptist persuaded the Publicanes, whose calling was to live by toles and
customs, to take heed of exacting more then their due; and the Soldiers, that
they should beware of offering violence unto any man, but be content Luke 3.
12, 13, 14
with their own wages. And our Savior having to deal with rich landed men,
wills them to take heed of covetousness. And the Apostles Paul and Luke 12.
15.
Peter, speaking unto Ministers and Pastors, exhort them to take heed to Act.
20. 28.
their flocks committed unto their charge, that they did feed them with the
bread of life, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a
1. Pet. 5. 2.
ready mind. Finally, we must watch over our hearts, that they be not corrupted
and drawn away from God with the sins of the times and Country in which we
live, both because we are apt to follow a multitude in doing evil, and are
easily misled by bad examples, our corruption, like tinder, receiving and
nourishing these hellish sparks; and being fallen into these sins, we are
apt to continue in them without feeling or remorse, the multitude of offenders
taking away the sense of sin. And therefore, as in infectious times and
places we are not willing (unless we be fools) to have the plague for
company; but the more the contagion is spread, the more we increase our care
that we do not come into places infected, or if we be constrained through the
necessity of our calling to live in them, yet we take heed that we do not
consort with those that are visited, further then necessity and charity
requires, and carefully and continually use our best preservatives to keep
out the infection, or if we be tainted, the best Antidotes and Cordials to
expel the poison with all speed, before it have seized upon the heart: so must
we use the like or greater care, when we live in places and times infected with
special and heinous sins, that we shun those that are tainted with them,
or use our best preservatives to preserve us from their infection; or if we be
touched in the common contagion, that we do not nourish the poison in our
hearts by carnal love, but expel it with what speed we can, by rising again
in unfeigned repentance; seeing the danger here as far exceeds the other,
as the soul the body; the evils of sin, the evils of sickness; or death
which is endless and everlasting, that which is corporal and momentany. And
thus we are to watch over our souls, hearts and internal faculties. The like
watch we must keep over our all outward parts, and first over all our senses,
the which are the gates of our souls, by which all things enter, nothing
almost being in the understanding, heart, and memory, which has not found
admittance by the senses. And therefore as those who desire to preserve the
city in safety when it is besieged, do keep most diligent watch about the
gates, suffering none to pass in or out, but only known friends, without due
examination whether their coming be for good or ill: so being besieged on all
sides by our spiritual enemies, we must keep a strait watch over our senses,
which are the usual passage by which they send their forces to surprise us,
admitting nothing to enter, without due trial taken, whether it be a friend or
foe to our salvation: for as long as we thus watch the gates, and keep them
fast locked and barred against all evils, the City of our souls, and Castle of
our hearts, can never be sacked and spoiled by all the might and malice of our
spiritual enemies. Now this watch over our senses does chiefly consist in two
things. First, in restraining them of their liberty, and not suffering them to
range and roue at pleasure, and whither they list, nor to satisfy themselves,
even unto saciety, with sensual delights, and full fruition of their several
objects; but oftentimes stopping them in their course and full careire, let us
call them to account, whether the things which they are exercised about, are as
profitable to our souls, as pleasant to our senses; or contrariwise, if they
do not, like sweet drinks, conueigh into our souls some deadly poison, and
bring more hurt and hinderance to the life of grace, then joy and comfort to
the life of nature. Secondly, when we allow our senses to take their
pleasures, we must carefully observe, that they delight themselves only in
things lawful, both in respect of matter, measure, and manner, not suffering
our eyes to gaze upon hurtful vanities, and lascivious and wanton objects, nor
our ears to hear scurrilous jests, and such rotten speeches as will corrupt
good manners, nor our taste to draw us on, by delighting in pleasant meats and
drinks, to excess, gluttony and drunkenness; but as we may, to satisfy
nature, and to refresh and comfort our hearts, give some liberty unto our
senses to enjoy their delights; so our care must be, that we not only make
choice of lawful objects, but also that they be exercised about them in a
right manner; and so moderated in respect of the measure, that our hearts do
not surfeit of them, nor be glewed by carnal delight unto the earth, and so
made unfit for spiritual exercises and heavenly meditations. But we must so
use these sensual pleasures, as not abusing them, to cheer the spirit, and
not pamper the flesh, as comforts in our pilgrimage, to make us to go on with
more cheerfulness in our way, and not as impediments to hinder us in our
journey, by fastening our hearts unto the vanities of the world.

CAP. X.
Of Christian watchfulness over the senses, our tongues and actions.

. Sect. 1 Of watching over our senses.
MOre especially, we must keep this careful watch over our eyes, which are
the windows of our souls, through which they behold all earthly objects, not
suffering them to roue about at pleasure, and to glut themselves with
delightful sights, but restraining them as much as we can, that they do not
behold that in this kind, which it is not lawful to covet: For of seeing Math.
5. 28.
comes loving; and of loving, lusting and desiring. We must keep them from
beholding any thing that may be unto us a ground of tentation, whereby we may
be drawn into any sin, or which may be a distraction unto us in Gods
service, and hinder our well-performing of any Christian exercise, but let us,
as near as we can, make choice of such sights as will more profit the soul,
then please the sense. Thus Job watched over his eyes, and because he would be
sure to keep them within compass, he leaves them not to their own liberty,
but keeps them under covenant, that they should not in any wanton manner, so
much as look upon Job 31. 1.
a woman. And this is that which Solomon means, where he says, that the wise
man's eyes are in his head, but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the
Eccles. 2. 14.
earth. Not that they do not all alike stand in their heads, but that a wise
man leaves not his eyes loose to their own liberty, but rules and governs
them with wisdom and discretion, not suffering them to behold unlawful
objects, or those which are lawful, unlawfully, either in respect of manner,
or measure; whereas a fool uses no restraint, but suffers them to roue into
all the corners of the world. Into which folly David fell, when he suffered his
eyes to gaze their fill upon the beauty of another man's wife, this folly
drawing him on to commit a greater folly in Israel; and therefore having
lamentable experience of his own frailty, he keeps afterward over them a
surer watch; which yet not being sure enough, he desires the Lord to watch
over him, and to turn away his Psalm. 119. 37.
eyes, lest he should behold vanity. With like care we must watch over our
ears, to keep them from hearing any thing which is vain and sinful; tending
to the corrupting of our souls, or the hindering of them in the growth of
grace: As all filthy communication and speeches tending to Gods dishonor, and
our own, or our neighbors hurt, all infulse and unsavory talk, bitter
taunts, and unchristian and spiteful jests, all whisperings, backbiting and
slandering, and all such discourses as feed the flesh, and starve the spirit,
wed us to the world, and weane us from God. For though like the Sirens songs
they tickle and delight the ear, yet they wound the heart and conscience with
sin, and bring us into such a spiritual phrenzie, that we are ready to leap
ouer-boord into a sea of perdition. And therefore we must stop our ears
against these bewitching sorcerers; and not for the pleasing of our carnal
sense, hazard the destruction of our precious souls. The hearing is called the
learned sense; and happy are they, who by their care and watchfulness provide
for themselves profitable and good Masters, of whom they may learn saving
wisdom; and not such as teach nothing else but vanity and sin. And the ears
like conduit-pipes convey unto the soul, either the clear streams of the
water of Life, or the filthy puddles of sin and death; and therefore let us
be careful to bring them daily to be filled at Gods Fountain, lest the devil
abuse them, to draine the filth out of the polluted sinkes and channels of
wicked mouths. Thus we must watch over our taste, that we do not, to please
the palate, use such excess in our diet, as will disable us to Christian
duties; and that the end of our eating be chiefly the refreshing and comforting
of our bodies, that they may be fit for Gods service who has fed them, and not
the pampering of the flesh with sensual delight. For if we give way to our
appetite, this short and brutish pleasure will bring upon us innumerable evils:
As upon our bodies, sicknesses and short life; and upon our souls and bodies
both, sloth and idleness, lumpish heaviness and unaptness to any good
action, drowzie dullness, or vain mirth and futilous babbling, shortness of
memory, and blockishnesse of understanding, wanton dalliance and inflammation
of our hearts with unlawful lusts. And thus finally we must watch over our
sense of touching, that we do not, to please it, inslaue our selves to
effeminate daintiness, thinking that we are quite undone, if we may not
tumble at our ease upon our beds of down, and go (like those in Kings Math.
11. 8.
houses) in soft raiment; or (like Dives) be clothed in Purple and fine linen
Luke 16. 1, 2.
every day. But let us inure this sense to man-like hardness, that we may not
think it strange and intolerable to lie hardly, and go barely, if Christ who
suffered so much for us, do call us to suffer a little for the testimony of
his truth. And much more must we restrain this sense from all unlawful
objects; as unchaste kisses, lascivious imbracements, and wanton dalliances,
which tend to the inflaming of our hearts with unclean lusts, and make our
bodies, which are the Temples of the holy Ghost, polluted brothel-houses, and
filthy styes for wicked spirits.

. Sect. 2 That we must watch over our tongues.
Secondly, we must keep a careful watch over our tongues, according to the
example of the Prophet David; I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I
sin not with my tongue. For the well-ruling and ordering of our tongues is a
matter of great moment, for the furthering or hindering of us in the course of
a Christian conversation; according to that of Solomon, A wholesome tongue is a
tree of life, but perverseness therein is a breach in Prou. 15. 4.
the spirit. If we use it well, it will be our glory, as being a notable
instrument of glorifying God, whilst we speak to his praise, and those that
honor him, he will honor; but if we abuse it unto sin, it will become 1.
Sam. 2. 30.
our shame, seeing thereby we dishonor God who has given it us, and all good
things. If we order it wisely, and speak things profitable and worth the
hearing, we shall edify our brethren: For the lips of the wise disperse Prou.
15. 7. and 25. 11.
knowledge; and a word fitly spoken, is like apples of gold, in pictures of
silver; that is, pleasant and profitable, like works of gold curiously and
artificially graven by a cunning workman; but if we vent nothing but filth and
folly, bringing up (as it were) our excrements by a wrong way, we shall annoy
our hearers, with our rotten and unsavory speeches, and by our evil words, 1.
Cor. 15. 31.
corrupt their good means, as the Apostle speaks. If we speak wisely and to
edification, we shall, in profiting others, have the comfort of it in our own
hearts: For as Solomon speaks, A man has joy by the answer of his Prou 15.
23. and 18. 20.
mouth, and a word spoken in due season, how good is it, both to the speaker,
and to the hearers? But when a man has pleased himself, for the time, with
scurrilous jests (the foam and froth of wit) it is his sin and shame, and
leaves nothing behind it but sorrow, and the tormenting sting of an evil
conscience. If our discourse be religious and honest, and such as becomes
Christian gravity, it is a good sign and comfortable evidence unto us, that we
are just and upright in Gods sight: For the mouth of the righteous speaks
Psalm. 37. 30.
wisdom, and his tongue talks of judgment. And, If any man offend not in
word, Iam. 3. 2.
the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body: but if our
talk be corrupt and unsavory, it is a sign of a rotten and wicked heart: for
as our Savior tells us, out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks:
A Mat. 12. 34, 35.
good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, brings forth good things;
and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, brings forth evil things. In a
word; Life and death are in the power of the tongue, and they that love it,
shall eat the Prou. 18 21. Math. 12. 37.
fruit thereof: and as our Savior tells us; By our words we shall be
justified, and by our words we shall be condemned. In which regard it stands
us upon, to keep a narrow watch over our mouths, that we offend not in our
speeches; and to resolve with David, that our tongues shall speak of
righteousness all Psalm. 71. 24.
the day long; so speaking and doing, as those that shall be judged by the law
of liberty.

. Sect. 3 That this watch consists in the right ordering of them.
Now this watch over our tongues must tend to the right ordering of the^, both
in respect of silence, and of speech. For we must not only restrain our
tongues from evil and corrupt communication; but also order them aright in
speaking that which is good, taking care not alone to speak good things, but
also in a good manner, when as they are seasonable and profitable in respect of
circumstances, time and place, the causes moving us, and the persons hearing
us: not pouring out good speeches without discretion, but observing measure,
gravity and modesty, not thinking it enough to speak that which is good, when
some others are present that could speak better. And therefore, as we do not
suffer pots and glasses of sweet waters, to have their full vent, but keep
their mouths close stopped, to preserve their sweetness for such times
wherein it may most seasonably be used; so though our hearts be full of
sweetness, and (as the Psalmist speaks) inditers of good matter; yet we must
not vent it with open mouth, which Psalm. 45. 1.
will make it lose much of its sweetness, but let us keep it in, till we have
got some seasonable time, when as we may hope to spend it to some good purpose.
For which moderating of our tongues by seasonable silence, and avoiding of too
much talking, the wise Solomon gives us good caueats and counsel: In the
multitude of words (says he) there wants not sin, (seeing Prou. 10. 19.
a man that speaks much, venteth some evil, or commonly is tainted with
pride and self-love in speaking that which is good) but he that refraineth
Prou. 17. 27, 28.
his lips, is wise. And again, He that has knowledge, spares his words, (so
that he has but a show of knowledge that lauishly spends them) and a man of
understanding is of an excellent spirit, knowing when to speak, and when to
keep silence. And even a fool, when he holds his peace, is Eccles. 10. 14.
counted wise; and he that shuts his lips, is esteemed a man of
understanding. In which regard Job wishes earnestly that his friends would
hold their Job 13. 5.
peace, that it might be imputed unto them for wisdom, because they spoke
many good things, yet not to the purpose, nor did prudently fit them to Jobs
person or state, which being so grievously afflicted and dejected, needed (if
they would have spoken seasonably) cordials of comfort, and not bitter purges,
or the distasteful infusion of gall and wormwood. And the Apostle James
exhorts us, to be swift to hear, and slow to Jam. 1. 19. Nazianz. in
Caesarij dialog. 3.
speak. To which purpose (as one observes) God has wisely appointed a double
guard to keep in the tongue, the lips, and two row of teeth, that it might be
restrained from breaking out by this double fence, and might be preserved from
slipping, being seated by nature in such a moist and slippery place. And as we
must keep this watch over our tongues in respect of keeping silence; so also
in respect of speech; for our tongues are not given us to this end chiefly,
that we should restrain them and say nothing, but that they might be our
glory, in glorifying God by setting forth his praise. And the Wise man tells
us, that as there is a time to keep Eccles. 3. 7.
silence, so also there is a time to speak. And here our first care must be,
that according to the Psalmists counsel, we keep our tongues from evil, and
our Psalm. 34. 13.
lips from speaking guile. And as the Apostle admonishes, that we suffer no
corrupt communication to proceed out of our mouths, but that which is good 1.
Pet. 3. 10.
to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers; and that
we use neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not
convenient, but rather Ephesians. 4. 29.
giving of thanks. But especially, let us watch over our souls, and our
tongues, that we do not (as it is the common custom of the most) abuse them
to slanders and reproaches, backbiting, and sharp censuring of our neighbors;
but taking all things, doubtfully spoken and done, in the best part, excusing
that which is tolerable, commending that which is good, and extenuating faults
of frailty and infirmity, let us approve our selves to be truly charitable, by
making our love to serve as a cover to hide a multitude of sins. Yea, so
far should we be from wronging our neighbors, 1. Pet. 1. 4.
by being the authors of evil reports, that we should not lend our ears to
others that spread them, but approve our selves by this sign, to be Citizens
of heaven, that we will not receive a reproach against our neighbors, Psalm. 15.
3.
nor so much as vouchsafe to take it up, though we found it by the highway
side. For (as one says) he is blessed that has armed himself so against this
Hieronym. ad Celantiam.
vice, that no man dare detract from any before him. And in the next place we
must watch over our tongues, that our speech may be always with grace,
seasoned with the salt of wisdom and Christian prudence, which Col. 4. 6.
teaches us to know how we may answer every man, and speak to their profit
and edification. The which wise and religious ruling of our tongues, is a
matter of great moment, and no less difficulty; For as the Apostle James
tells us, though the tongue be but a little member, yet it is a world of Iam.
3. 5, 6, 7, 8.
iniquity, and boasts of great things. And as a little fire is sufficient to
inflame great store of matter: so the tongue defiles the whole body, and
sets on fire the course of nature, and is it self set on fire of hell; and
such an unruly evil, full of deadly poison, as no man can tame by sole
strength of nature. And yet such is the necessity of the well-gouerning of it,
that all our Religion is to no purpose without it. For if any man amongst us
seem to be religious, Iam. 1. 26.
and bridleth not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, that man's Religion
is vain. In which regard we must keep over it the straighter watch; as we use
to curb and keep in a headstrong horse, with so much the sharper and
stronger bit; and seeing no man can with his own circumspection rule it
sufficiently, but that it will break from him at unawares, and the Lord only
is sufficient to manage and direct it, according to that of Solomon, The
preparation of the heart, and the answer of the tongue is from the Prou. 16. 1.
Lord; therefore we must pray with David, that he will set a watch before our
Psalm. 141. 3. and 51. 15.
mouth, and keep the door of our lips; and that he will so open our lips, that
our mouth may show forth his praise.

. Sect. 4 Of our watchfulness over our works and actions.
Lastly, we must set this diligent watch over our works and actions, that they
may in all things be conformable to the Word and will of God, Prou. 4. 26.
whilst we do that which he has commanded, and leave undone that which he
has forbidden. Thus the Wise man exhorts us, not to be rash and unadvised in
our courses; but to ponder the path of our feet, and let all our ways be
established, turning neither to the right hand, nor to the left, and removing
our foot from evil. And this he makes to be a note of a man truly wise: for
whereas a silly man, being ouer-credulous, is rash and headlong in all his
enterprises, A prudent man looks well to his going: and Pro. 14. 15, 16.
whereas the fool rages and is confident, a wise man fears and departs
from evil. And because our ways are, through the malice of our spiritual
enemies, on all sides beset with snares, wherewith, if we be not very
circumspect, we shall easily be caught; therefore in this regard he says, that
he Prou. 28. 14.
is blessed that fears always, and seeing we daily tread upon slippery
places, whilst we are managing our worldly affairs. Hereof it is, that the
Apostle commending unto us this watchful care, wills him who thinks that
he stands, take heed lest he fall. Now this care and watchfulness respecting
our actions, provides, first, that we spend none of our precious time in sloth
and idleness, (for by doing nothing, we shall quickly learn to do that which
is ill) but that we be always exercised in some good employment, respecting
Gods glory, or our own, or our neighbors good, as I have showed at large
before, and therefore here thus briefly pass it over. Secondly, that with all
care and circumspection we keep our selves from all sinful actions, and
though through Satan's tentations, and our own corruption, we have conceived
sin in the heart, yet let us there smother it, as in the womb, and not
consummate and perfect it, and (as it were) by acting of it, bring it unto
birth. Finally, we must watch over our works and actions, that we may not
only shun evil, but also do that which is good, that thereby we may
glorify God by the light of our godly lives, adorn our profession, edify our
neighbors by our good example, and make our own calling and election sure.
But of this also I have spoken before.

CAP. XI.
Of the ends at which we must aim in the Christian watch.

. Sect. 1 Of three special ends of our Christian watch.
ANd these are the things wherein our Christian watch chiefly consists, and
about which it is exercised. The next point to be considered, is, the ends at
which we must principally aim in it, the which are diverse. The first and
chief is, that we may please God in all things, for which use, this watch is
most profitable and necessary. For seeing naturally our ways are wholly
corrupt, so as we can please him in nothing, it is not possible, without
singular care and circumspection, that we should so carry our selves in our
whole conversation, as that all our actions may be acceptable in his sight.
Secondly, we must thus watch over our selves, that we may daily more and more
mortify our corruptions, especially those which bear greatest sway in us; and
that we may avoid all manner of actual transgressions, and those, above all
the rest, wherewith we have been most often overtaken, because Satan and our
own corruption are most ready to use those weapons of iniquity to foil and
overcome us, which they have found by experience most potent to prevail
against us. Nor must we think any sin so small that we may neglect it,
seeing the least is strong enough to make way for greater. Neither must we
only watchfully avoid the sins themselves, but also all the occasions and
means which may allure and draw us unto them. For where God has forbidden any
vice, there he also forbids the occasions and means of it, which if we
neglect and run wilfully into tentations, it is just with God, when we thus
tempt him, to withdraw his grace, and to leave us to the Tempter; and then what
can follow but our shameful foyles and falls? For who can carry fire in his
bosom, and not be burnt? who can hope to live unto old age, that makes it
his daily sport, to be dallying Pro. 6. 27.
with the means and occasions of death? And therefore if we would preserve our
souls from being defiled with the filthy strumpet of sin and vice, let us
carefully shun her unchaste imbracements; yea (as Solomon speaks) let us
remove our way far from her, and come not near the door Pro. 5. 8.
of her house. And if we would not walk in the ways of sin which lead to
destruction; Let us not so much as once enter into the path of the wicked, Pro.
4. 14, 15.
nor go in the way of evil men, but avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it,
and pass away. If we would not do the devils works of injustice, we must
not so much as receive his wages, but shake our hands from holding of bribes.
If we would not become evil and vain in our thoughts and actions, Esa. 33.
15.
we must shut our eyes from seeing evil, and turn them away from beholding
vanity. Thirdly, we must keep this watch, not only that we Psalm. 119. 37.
Inutile est crebro videre per quae aliquando captus sis. Hyer. ad Jouinian.
lib. 2.
may avoid all sin; but also that we may perform all Christian and holy
duties with all diligence and constancy, not contenting our selves to do
some, and neglect others, or to be earnest in them sometimes, and soon after
careless and slothful; but observing all, and in all seasons. Yea, this watch
must extend it self, not only to the matter of Christian duties, but also to
the manner; as that they be done in love and obedience to God, that we may
thereby glorify him in faith and with a good conscience, with alacrity and
cheerfulness, in sincerity and truth, without all hypocrisy, dullness, and
weariness; And finally, that we do them prudently and seasonably, with due
respect to all circumstances of persons, time, and place. In all which
respects, if we do not carefully keep the Christian watch, it is not
possible but that we shall continually fail, both in the matter and manner of
our duties: seeing we are naturally auerse and backward unto them, sluggish
and slothful, rash and indiscreet in doing of them; and therefore if we do
not carefully watch over our hearts, we shall upon every slight occasion
neglect them altogether, or grow cold and careless, slack and remiss, drowzy
and soon weary in performing them. Whereas, if keeping this watch, we stir
up and re-enliue Gods graces in us, when they are ready to languish and die,
and (with the Ostridge) hasten our speed, by adding unto our wings of faith and
love, the spurs of Gods fear, we shall, without thinking of weariness, run
much more swiftly and surely in the ways of Gods Commandments.

. Sect. 2 That we must watch over our selves, that we be not circumuented by
our spiritual enemies.
Finally, in this our watch we must carefully take heed, that whilst we set
our selves to perform the duties of a godly life, we be not hindered by Mat.
26. 41. Mar. 13. 33. Ephesians. ^. 18.
the tentations of our spiritual enemies, or at least so disturbed and
disabled, that not doing them in that manner as we ought, we lose all the fruit
of our labors. In which respect, our Savior exhorts his Apostles to join
watching with their prayer, that they might not fall into tentation, not only
understanding thereby a bodily watchfulness opposed to natural sleep, but
also the spiritual watching opposed to carnal security, the sleep of the
soul, with both which they were at that time overtaken. For howsoever the
consideration of the multitude, might, and malice of our spiritual enemies, is
a motive sufficient to make us stand watchfully upon our guard, seeing they
assault us on all sides with their engines of battery, lay secret ambushments
in every corner, and fill all places so full of their nets and snares, that
without singular circumspection we cannot avoid them: yet seeing they never
bend their malice and might so furiously against us, as when they see us
exercised about Christian duties, that they may either discourage us, or make
them unprofitable; who sees not that we had here need to keep a double
watch? Like wicked thieves, often fleshed with blood and cruelty, they are
always ready to do us a mischief, and to beat us even to the death when
they find nothing about us; but then they double their watch and diligence, in
surprising us by the way, when as we are going about the service of our
heavenly Master, and carry with us the rich treasures of his graces; in which
regard, we must be no less vigilant for our own safety, then they for our
destruction; for our perseverance in the ways of godliness, and preserving of
our spiritual riches, then they to stop us in our course, and to spoil us of
all our wealth. The devil, like a roaring Lion, goes always about, seeking to
devour 1. Pet. 5. 8.
us, and therefore it behooves us continually to watch and to be sober; but
Mat. 13. 25. Ioh. 15. 9. Exodus 5. 1, 6.
then he is most watchful in sowing his tares, when he sees that our heavenly
Husbandman has sown his good seed and wheat of saving graces in our hearts.
The world always maligneth those whom Christ has chosen out of it; but in
nothing does it show greater malice against them, then when they most seriously
set themselves to do God faithful service, as we see in the examples of all
ages. The flesh is always ready to betray us into the hands of them both; but
never does it more spitefully play its prizes, then when it sees us exercised
in religious duties; carrying away our hearts with a thousand distractions, and
like a massy and heavy weight pressing us down, makes us lumpish and heavy,
unweildy and soon weary in our Christian race. In which regard, we must at all
times watch to defeat their malice, but we must double and triple it, against
this triple opposition of the devil, the world, and our own flesh, when we
intend to perform any Christian duties.

. Sect. 3 That we must keep this watch in all places, and at all times.
In all which respects, we are to keep a careful watch over our selves in all
places, when we are at home, and when we are abroad; when we are alone, and
when we are in company; in the Church and open streets, and in our own houses
and private Closets; seeing there is no place free from danger, by reason of
those inward corruptions and secret traitors, which we carry every where about
us, and those outward enemies, the devil and the world, which are ready in all
places to set upon us. So likewise there is no time exempted from this watch,
neither youth nor old age, day nor night, but it must be kept continually,
according to that; Take Deuteronomy. 4. 9.
heed to thy self, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things
which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thine heart all the
days of thy life. For the causes of it are continual, and therefore the watch
must not be intermitted. At all times we must labor to please God, and not by
fits, and obedience at all times must be yielded to him. At all times sin
must be shunned, unto which we are prone by nature, and all virtues and
Christian duties to be embraced and practiced, when any good occasion is
offered, unto which naturally we are backward and auerse. No time is exempted
from the Christian warfare, nor secure and safe from the assaults of our
spiritual enemies. And therefore we must continually stand upon our guard and
keep our watch, that we be at no time unfit for any of these purposes, lest
being surprised upon a sudden, we be easily vanquished by our spiritual
enemies. Besides, through the intermission of our watch, we do not only lose
the present time, which should be spent in the service of God, but also
endanger our selves to lose much more, before we can again set our watch in
good order. For our hearts having broke the bounds of Gods fear, will not
without much labor be restrained of their licentious liberty; our devotions
being once cooled, will not without much fire and fuel recover their lost
heat. And sooner might we with well ordered hearts, have performed the duties
of Gods service which we intend, then bring them in frame and rightly prepare
them, when through neglect of this watch they are out of tune. Finally, we
must keep this watch in all estates and conditions, in the time of health as
well as in sickness, as well when we are rich, that our wealth do not wedge
and fasten our hearts upon the world and earthly things; as in our poverty,
that we use no unlawful means to become rich. In our prosperity, that we
forget not God, nor love his gifts better then the giver; and in our
affliction, that we murmr not through impatiencie, but draw nearer unto God
when he corrects us.

. Sect. 4 That we must watch over our brethren.
Neither is it enough that we thus watch over our selves, but we must also
with like care and circumspection watch over our brethren; seeing the Lord has
not committed us to our own single watch, but has enjoined us to be mutual
obseruers and keepers one of another; not curiously to pry out one another
faults, to censure and aggrauate them, but charitably to take notice of them,
that we may help to amend them. Thus the Apostle inioyneth us, to consider
one another, to provoke unto love Heb. 10. 24. and 3. 13.
and to good works, and that we should exhort one another daily, while it is
called to day, lest any of us should be hardened through the deceitfulness of
sin. For this care and watchfulness being an inseparable effect and fruit of
Christian charity, extends it self, not only to our own persons (for this
were nothing but self-love) but as far as it stretches, that is, to all our
neighbors. Thus David took notice, not only of his own sins, to mourn
for them, but says that rivers of waters did run down his eyes, because
Psalm. 119. 136.
other men did not keep Gods Law. Yea, this his care extended to his enemies;
My zeal (says he) has consumed me, because mine enemies have Verse. 139.
not kept thy Word. But though our care must extend to all, yet we must keep
this watch in a special manner over those who are committed to our special
charge; as the Householder over his family, and the Pastor over his flock,
according to that of the Apostle, Take heed to your selves Act. 20. 28.
and to all the flock, over the which the holy Ghost has made you overseers,
etc. Which whosoever neglects, and takes care only for himself, he is worse
then an Infidel, and plainly discouers that he is of Cains speech and
spirit, Genesis 4. 9.
thinking it enough to look to himself, and scorning to be his brothers
keeper.

CAP. XII.
Of the reasons whereby we may be persuaded to keep this Christian watch.

. Sect. 1 That this watch is necessary, because God requires it.
THe next point to be considered, is the means whereby we may both be stirred
up, and also enabled to keep this Christian watch, which are partly reasons
that may move us to undertake it, and partly helps inabling us to perform
it. The reasons which may persuade us unto this watchfulness, are diverse; all
which may be reduced unto two heads. 1. Because it is most necessary. 2.
Because it is exceeding profitable. The necessity of it appears diverse ways.
First, because God has expressly required it; Take heed to Deuteronomy. 4. 9. Luke 12.
36.
thy self, and keep thy soul diligently, etc. Let your loins be girded
about, and your lights burning; and ye your selves, like unto them that wait
for their Lord, when he will return from the wedding, that when he comes and
knocks, ye may open unto him immediately. So Joshua exhorts the people, to
take diligent heed to do the Commandment and the Law, to love the Lord their
God, and to Ios. 22. 5. and 23. 11.
walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him, and serve him with all their
heart, and with all their soul. And our Savior Christ exhorts all to watch
and Mar. 13. 33, 37.
pray, because we do not know when the time of his coming should be. And
stirs up the Church of Sardis to be watchful, and to strengthen the things
Apoc. 3. 2.
which did remain and were ready to die. The which his Commandment, he
powerfully and effectually presses by diverse parables; as of the goodman Luke
12. 37.
of the house, who carefully watches the coming of the thief, that he may
not rob and spoil him. Of the wise and faithful servant, who watches for the
coming of his Lord, that he may find him employed in his business, who
being found faithful, is richly rewarded for his care and diligence. And of
the evil servant, who neglecting this watch, is fearfully punished. And of
the ten Virgins, whereof five were wise, and five Mat. 25. 1. to 14
foolish; the wise watching diligently for the coming of the Bridegroom, and
being found prepared, were received with him into the bridal Chamber of joy
and happiness; the foolish, through their careless negligence, being taken at
unawares and unprovided, were excluded from his glorious presence for evermore.
So that no duty is more straightly enjoined and earnestly enforced then the
spiritual watch, to the end we might observe it with the greater care and
diligence, or if we neglect it, having had so many and effectual warnings,
we might be left without excuse.

. Sect. 2 Other reasons showing the necessity of keeping this watch.
The second reason to enforce the necessity of this watch, is taken from our
estate and condition here on earth. First, because through our corruption we
are exceeding weak, and full of frailty and infirmity, by reason whereof we
are prone unto sin, and easily overcome with the tentations of our spiritual
enemies, if we neglect the keeping of this vvatch, and be taken unprovided.
The which reason our Savior uses to enforce the necessity of watching and
praying. Watch and pray (says he) lest ye fall into tentation: The Spirit
indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. So the Apostle Mat. 26. 41.
in this regard, wills him that thinks he stands, to take heed lest he
1. Cor. 10. 12.
fall; and exhorts us to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.
And the Wiseman pronounces him blessed, who in the sight and sense of Phil.
2. 13.
his own frailty and infirmity, fears always. For as it is necessary for
Pro 28. 14.
those who have vveake and sickly bodies, to observe a strict diet; and for
those Citizens, who being besieged by mighty and malicious enemies, and have
many breaches in their vvalls, to be very diligent to make them up again, and
in the mean time, to keep a careful and strong vvatch over those vveake
places, because their enemies are ready to take all advantages, and to give the
fiercest assaults where they are likeliest to have the speediest entrance and
least resistance: So we upon the same grounds, must think it necessary to
double our vvatch, because our souls are sickly, and full of wants and
weaknesses, and many breaches are made in the chiefest Bulvvarkes of our own
strength, by the cruel and continual assaults of our spiritual enemies.
Secondly, our care is necessary in keeping this vvatch, because naturally we
are drovvzy and sleepy, like those in a Lethargy, who need to have some
continually standing by, and to keep them awake, by pricking and pinching
them, that they may not fall into the sleep of death. Yea, and after that we
are regenerate, and are espoused unto Christ, we are apt with the five wise
Virgins, to nod often, and take a nap, when as we should wait for the
coming of our Bridegroom. And if he did not awake us daily, by his Spirit
knocking at the door of our hearts, and his gracious call sounding in his
Word, saying unto us, Awake, thou that sleep: and Open unto me, my sister,
my love, my Ephesians. 5. 14. Cant. 5. 2.
dove, my undefiled, we would quickly fall into our old Lethargy of carnal
security. In respect of which drowzinesse of nature, by reason of the relics
of sin remaining in us, we are unfit to keep the spiritual watch, unless
we continually rowze up ourselves, and shake off this sloth of carnal
security. And therefore as it is said of the Nightingale, that being to delight
her self with her night songs, and fearing lest falling asleep, she should
endanger her self to birds of prey, does set her breast against a thorn, to
keep her waking; so we, being to sing the songs of Sion, and to spend our time
continually in holy duties, must use all good means to keep us waking,
because we are every hand-while apt through our sluggishnesse, to take a nap,
and thereby to endanger our souls to those ravenous and hellish fowls, who
take their chief delight in the works of darkness, and are ready to seize
upon us, if they find us sleeping. Thirdly, this watch is necessary, in regard
of the wickedness and deceitfulness Ier. 17. 10.
of our own hearts, which are ready continually to withdraw themselves from
God, to start aside like a deceitful bow, when we aim at any good Psalm. 78.
57.
duty, and so make us to miss the mark; and to break from us when we set
our selves to perform any religious exercises, distracting and pulling our
minds from them, that they may wander about in worldly cogitations. And
therefore seeing it is such a slippery Eele, we must take the surer hold of it,
seeing it is such a false and flitting servant, which has often deceived us,
accompanying us into the Church, and even unto our Pewes, and then secretly
slipping from us, that they may spend the time allotted to Gods service, in
ranging abroad about worldly vanities; there is no way but to set it before us
in Gods presence, and to keep it continually under the straight watch of a
vigilant eye, that it may not slip away at unawares, as it has done often in
former times. And this the Lord requires as necessary in this case; Take heed
to your selves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn Deuteronomy. 11. 16.
aside; that is, lest you heart deceive your heart, your corrupt and deceitful
heart, prevailing against your heart which is sanctified and regenerate; for
neither can the world, nor the devil draw us away from God, till our sinful
flesh and corrupt nature betray us into their hands. And of this also the
Apostle gives us warning; Take heed (says he) brethren, lest there be Heb.
3. 12.
in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
Fourthly, this watch is necessary, because without it we are apt to relapse
into our former condition of the sleep of sin. For we are in this life like
men not thoroughly awaked, but between sleeping and waking, so as we may say
with the Spouse, I sleep, but my heart waketh: and if we be not Cant. 5. 2.
continually using all good means to keep us waking, we will but open our
eyes and shut them again, and (as it were) but turn us to the other side,
and so return to our former sleep. We are like men but newly recovered out
of dangerous diseases, which have great need to look unto themselves, seeing
upon every slight cause, the least taking of cold, or distemper through ill
diet, they are ready to relapse into their former sickness. We are like
vveakelings, that can but hardly go, and yet must needs travel in slippery
places, or (as it were) aloft upon a narrovv beam, where we often slip, and
are sure to catch grievous falls, unless we carefully watch over our selves,
and look diligently to our footing; and being fallen, are sure to perish,
unless we rise up again, and recover our selves by unfeigned repentance;
according to that of our Savior; Remember from whence thou art fallen, and
repent, and do thy first works, or else Apoc. 2. 5.
I will come against thee quickly, etc. The which relapses and falls be most
dangerous unto our spiritual life, because they make our estate worse then it
was before our conversion, when as we were sick in sin and death, seeing we
are but like men who in their departure are dawed (as they say) and wakened by
the outcries of the standers by, who revive not to live, but to dye again,
and so to endure the pains of a continued sickness and double death; in which
respect our Savior Christ says, that the end of Math. 12. 45.
such is worse then their beginning. And the Apostle Peter affirms, that it
2. Pet. 2. 21, 22.
had been better for them, not to have known the way of righteousness, then
after they have known it, to turn out of it, like the dog to his vomit, or
the washed sow to her wallowing in the mire. Lastly, in regard of our selves
this watch is necessary, because without it we can have no assurance that we
are spiritually enlightened and awakened out of the sleep of death. For this
is the difference which the Apostle makes between the faithful and the
unbeliever, that these still lie sleeping and snorting in the dark night of
ignorance and error, doing in the dark, the works of darkness, and wholly
neglecting the Christian Watch; but the other being children of 1. These. 5. 5,
6, 7.
the light, and of the day, do not sleep as do others, but watch and are
sober; and being of the day, do the works of the day, putting on the
breast plate of faith and love, and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. And as
there are great and manifold causes respecting our selves, which make this
watch necessary; so also in respect of the enemies of our salvation, who being
powerful and politic, far mightier then we, and yet many to one, do
labor by all means to work our destruction. The which argument alone should
keep us waking, (for when should we vvatch, if not in the time of our
Christian warfare, when as we are beset on all sides with such dangerous and
malicious enemies?) especially if we consider that the chief commander of all
these forces, Satan, that roaring and ravening Lion, never 1. Pet. 5. 8.
slumbreth nor sleeps, but goes continually about, and watches all
opportunities of working our destruction. And therefore if they be so watchful
that they may work our ruin, by casting us into the deep sleep and
spiritual lethargy of sin and death, how vigilant and careful should we be,
by preventing their malice, to escape this imminent and desperate danger?

. Sect. 3 That this watch is most profitable, because it helps us much to the
leading of a godly life.
The reasons which may induce us to keep this watch respecting our profit, are
also diverse. First, because it helps us much to the leading of a godly life,
in which we thrive and profit, or decline and go backward, as we either keep
and observe, or intermit and neglect this Christian watch. For when we watch
over our selves, God likewise watches over us, and by the assistance of his
holy Spirit, inableth us to stand against all tentations, and to go forward in
our Christian course: but when through our slacknesse and negligence, we run
wilfully into tentations, he leaves us to be foiled of them, that we may
learn the next time to take better heed. More especially, the Lord will
inlighten the eyes of our minds, that we may discern the right way in which we
should walk; according to that of the Apostle, Awake, thou that sleep, and
stand up from the dead, Ephesians. 4. 14.
and Christ shall give thee light. And seeing the way, we shall have our faith
so strengthened, and our courage and resolution so confirmed and increased,
that we shall manfully proceed in it, notwithstanding all opposition; whereof
it is that the Apostle conioyneth and linketh all these together as inseparable
companions; Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quite your selves 1. Cor. 16. 13.
like men, be strong. For as those who for want of heed and circumspection fall
into secret ambushments at unawares, are soon discomfited, and by running
away, leave to their enemies an easy victory; whereas those who by their
watchfulness discover them, are no whit daunted in their courage, because they
can easily avoid them; or defeating the stratagem of their enemies, can
circumuent and catch them in their own snare: so is it also in the Christian
warfare; wherein the discovery of our enemies policies, by our careful watch,
is a principal means of preventing them, the finding out of their secret
ambushments, more then half the way unto assured victory, and the very sight
of their nets lying near their stales, and of their deadly hooks of sin
lying hid under the baits of worldly profits and pleasures, are sufficient
warnings to make us shun and escape them, if we have any care of the
salvation of our souls. So that there is no readier and surer way to avoid all
manner of sin, the bane and poison of our souls, then by our watch to epsy
the danger when it is offered unto us in these golden cups; no means more
forcible to make us fly the hellish imbracements of this painted strumpet,
then by our diligent watch and circumspection, to pull off the deceiving vizard
of momentany gain and delight, and to behold her in her natural deformity and
ugly filthiness. Whereas contrariwise, the neglect of keeping this careful
watch, is the ready way to all wickedness; the mind being let loose to vain
and sinful thoughts, the heart to sinful concupiscence and unlawful lusts,
the tongue to light, wanton and wicked words, the hands to act the works of
darkness, and the whole man exposed to the dangerous assaults and tentations
of our spiritual enemies, wherewith being vanquished, we are easily led
captive into all sin. Of which we have lamentable experience in Noah, Lot,
David, Peter, and many others, who whilst they carefully kept the spiritual
watch, triumphed over the enemies of their salvation, and went on courageously
in the ways of godliness; but when they did but for a little while intermit
and neglect it, received dangerous and shameful foyles. But most evidently
does this appear in the example of our first parents, who so long as they
observed this watch, continued constant in their integrity; but remitting their
care and circumspection, and letting loose their ears to hear the voice of
the Tempter, their hearts to admit, through fond credulity, his false
suggestions, their eyes to gaze on the forbidden fruit, their hands to touch,
and their mouths to taste it, they were soon overcome, and caught both
themselves and for all their posterity, a fearful fall. And therefore if they
fell in the state of innocence by intermitting this watch, who can neglect it
in the state of corruption and imperfection, and yet hope to stand? Finally, it
conduces and furthereth us much unto a godly life, as it makes us fit and
ready for the well-performing of all Christian duties. For when all our parts
are hereby kept in a good and constant order, they are always prepared for all
good employments; and if we take care that our Instruments be well stringed
and kept in tune, no more remains but to touch them with a skillful hand, and
there will be a melodious harmony between the heart, tongue, and outward
actions. And therefore David demanding how a young man might order his steps,
and cleanse his ways, that they might be pure and upright in the sight of God?
does thus resolve the question, that it is to be done by taking heed thereto
according to Gods Psalm. 119. 9.
Word.

. Sect. 4 That by this watch we are made constant in the course of Christianity.
Secondly, this watch is exceeding profitable, not only as it preserves us
from all sinful ways, and fitteth us to walk in the ways of godliness, but
also as it inableth us to be constant in this course, and to persevere in it
even to the end. Seeing hereby we are strengthened against all discouragements,
avoid or leap over all impediments, that like stumbling blocks are cast into
our way, and are prepared and armed against all the assaults of our spiritual
enemies, and all other oppositions which might encounter us in our Christian
course. Thirdly, it is a notable means of Christian security, so as keeping
this watch, we may with David, grow so confident, that though we should walk
through the vale of the shadow of Tsal. 23. 4.
death, yet we will fear no evil, because God also watches over them, who
thus watch over themselves, so as having once set their watch, they may lay
them down securely and take their rest, because the Lord makes them to Psalm.
4 8.
dwell in safety. So also upon the same grounds it causes unto us inward
peace, even peace with God, and the peace of a good conscience, when as by
help of this watch we carry our selves so in all things, as that we and our
works are accepted of him, and pleasing in his sight. The which peace cannot be
impeached with the malice and might of all our enemies; for if God be with us,
who can be against us? If he speak peace unto our consciences, Romans 8. 31.
though all the world should proclaim war, it needs not to dismay us, for
though thousands fall on one side, and ten thousand on the other, it shall not
hurt us or disturb our peace; for either the Lord will be a wall of defense,
and tower of strength to preserve us from all danger, and to make us shot-free
even at the Canons mouth; or else we shall be, with Josiah, taken away in
peace, although we fall by the hands of our enemies. 2. Chron. 34. 28. and 35.
23, 24. 1. Pet. 1. 8.
From which security and peace, arises spiritual joy, unspeakable and
glorious, when as we are sure that nothing can hurt us, or hinder our
salvation, but all things, even afflictions themselves, shall work together
for the best. Now what is this, but to have a heaven upon earth, when as in
this momentany life those eternal joys are begun in us? For as the Apostle
tells us, The Kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy
Romans 14. 17.
Ghost. Fourthly, by this Christian watch we are fitted to bear all estates,
so as the great sail of prosperity shall not ouer-set us, whilst we take
heed unto our hearts, that they be not vvithdravvne from God, and fastened upon
vvorldly things; nor be forced by the storms of afflictions, to strike sail,
and desist in our course toward our heavenly Country, much less to dash
against the rocks of despair, being assured that they Heb. 12. 6.
are the signs of our adoption, evidences of Gods love, and that by these
manifold tribulations we shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven. Fifthly, by
Act. 14. 22.
this vvatch we are made ready for the coming of Christ unto Judgment, and
prepared to enter into the joy of our Master, as we see in the parable of the
faithful servant, and the wise Virgins; so as when the time approaches, the
terrors of it need not to daunt us, but rather expecting him with his reward
in his hand, we may with confidence and joy hold up Luke 21. 28.
our heads, because our full Redemption draws near. Finally, by this
watchfulness we are assured of blessedness; seeing our Savior has
pronounced such as thus watch for his coming, blessed in so doing. Blessed
(says he) Luke 12. 37, 38, 43. Math. 24. 46, 47.
are those servants whom the Lord when he comes shall find watching. Verily
I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to
meat, and will come forth and serve them, and make them owners of all his
goods. In which regard he calls them Blessed, blessed, and the third time
blessed, to Apoc. 16. 15.
show that they are thrice blessed, and even perfected and consummate in
blessedness which keep constantly the spiritual watch, and are thereby
always in readiness and prepared for his coming.

CAP. XIII.
Of the means whereby we may be enabled to keep the Christian watch.

. Sect. 1 The 1. means is temperance and sobriety, and the second, the fear
of God.
THe last thing to be considered in this spiritual watch, is the means
whereby we may be enabled to keep it; the which I will but briefly touch,
because they are so fully handled in the forenamed Treatise. The first means
are sobriety and temperance, the which as they much further us in the natural
watch, so are they singular helps to enable us unto the spiritual. Whereof it
is that in the Scriptures they are joined and enjoined together, as mutual
causes one of another. Be sober 1. Pet. 5. 7, 8.
and watch. We are not of the night, nor of darkness; therefore let us not
sleep 1. These. 5. 5, 6.
as do others, but let us watch and be sober. And our Savior Christ
persuading us to this spiritual watch, and arming us against the deep
security of the latter days, gives us in charge, as a notable means to cause
the one, and prevent the other, that we take heed unto our selves, lest at any
time Luke 21. 34.
our hearts be ouercharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of
this life, and so that Day come upon us at unawares. Which means of
watchfulness when Noah and Lot neglected, they soon fell into a dangerous
sleep of sin. Neither must this temperance and sobriety extend only to
meats and drinks, seeing we may be drunk with the intoxicating cups of
pleasures and carnal delights, and surfeit upon worldly prosperity and earthly
things, when we do too hungerly affect them in our desires, and set our hearts
immoderately upon them; but they must reach also (as I showed before, when I
spoke of sobriety) to the right ordering of our minds in the use of all
temporary blessings, in a due manner and measure, so as they may be helps and
not hindrances unto us in all the duties of a godly life; which if we neglect,
we may surfeit and be spiritually drunk, Esa. 29. 9. and 51. 21.
though we be never so temperate in the use of meats and drinks. The second
means to make us watchful is, to nourish in our hearts the true fear of God,
not a servile fear, which will make every slave watchful over his ways, for
fear of the whip; but a filial and child-like fear, which will cause us to
keep over our selves, in all things, a diligent watch, that we may do nothing
displeasing in his sight, who so loves us, and whom we so love; and
contrariwise, that we may so carry our selves in the performing of all good
duties, as that God may be well pleased in us, and we in him; he delighting to
do us good, and we delighting to praise his goodness. Of which filial fear
the Psalmist speaks; There is Psalm. 130. 4.
mercy with thee that thou may be feared. And this is the fear which the
Lord Ier. 32. 42.
promises in the covenant of grace, that he will put it into the hearts of his
children and servants, that they may not depart from him. This is it which (as
the Wise man tells us) causes men to depart from evil; as we see in Prou.
14 16. and 16. 6.
the example of Job, who is said to be a man, fearing God, and eschewing evil.
And therefore David desiring to restrain men from sin, puts (as it were)
into their mouths the bridle of Gods fear; Stand in awe (says he) Psalm. 4. 4.
and sin not. And contrariwise, if this fear be not in us, and our hearts be
taken up with carnal security, we presently neglect to keep any watch, (like
a City which fears not the approach of any enemies) and rush, without care,
into all wickedness. And this the old Serpent knew well, who having no hope to
prevail against our first Parents, so long as being afraid Genesis 3. 4.
of Gods threatening, they kept their watch; he persuaded them first to cast
out this fear by unbelief, whereby becoming secure, they were easily drawn
into transgression. This made Abraham think that the Egyptians were ready for
all wickedness, because the fear of God was not Genesis 20. 11. Psalm. 36. 1.
in the Land. And the Psalmist tells us, that the transgression of the wicked
persuaded him to conclude, that there was no fear of God before their eyes.
And finally, the Apostle having repeated a whole bead roll of many sins,
which had defiled every several part of wicked men, makes the same conclusion
with the Psalmist, that because they were destitute of Gods fear, this was the
cause which made way for all the rest. Romans 3. 18, 19, 20.


. Sect. 2 The third means is the remembrance of Gods Judgments.
The third means is, often to call unto our remembrance Gods fearful
Judgments executed upon all sinners, but especially upon such as have Mat. 24
38.
continued in their wickedness with careless security, and wholly neglected
to keep this watch; as of the old world, who lived in all rechlesse security,
eating and drinking, buying and selling, marrying, and giving in marriage, so
doing these things, as that they neglected all things else which were necessary
for their safety and salvation, until Noah entering into the Arc, they were
all swept away with an universal deluge. Thus also Sodom and Gomorrah living
in their sins with all security, were attached with Gods fearful Judgments
when they least thought of them, and were wholly destroyed with fire and
brimstone. Thus Babylon exceeding Esa. 47. 8, 9.
in security, as much as in all other sins, had those punishments which she
least feared, inflicted upon her. Thus the Lord threatened the Church of
Sardis, that if they would not watch, he would come as a thief against Apoc.
3. 3.
them; that is, bring upon them suddenly unexpected judgments, with which,
when they neglected this warning, they were afterward fearfully surprised. But
of this point I have spoken at large in another Treatise of carnal security
and hardness of heart.
Treatise; only let it suffice here to show, that as neglect of Gods
Judgments makes us secure and careless; so the often calling of them to
mind, is a notable means to make us watchful, that we may not have the like,
or greater inflicted upon us. The which is the principal use that our Savior
intended in propounding the former examples of the old world, and of Sodom and
Gomorrah, fearfully punished, because they securely Mat. 24 3^, 42. Luke (...)
35, 3^.
went on in their sins, that we might not be overtaken with the like, but
that continually watching and praying, we might be thought worthy to escape
them, when God comes in his visitation to take notice of our ways. And thus
also the Apostle having called to remembrance Gods heavy Judgments inflicted
upon the Israelites, says, that all these things were written for our
learning, upon whom the ends of the world 1. Cor. 10. 5. to 12.
are come, that by flying their sins, we might escape their punishments, and
thereupon infers this use, that we should not presume on our own strength,
but that he who thinks he stands, should take heed of falling.

. Sect. 3 Of the fourth means, which is, to remember the day of death.
The fourth means is, that we continually remember the day of our death, not
as though it were far off, but near approaching, and even knocking at our
doors. For our lives are short and momentany, and this short time so
uncertain, that we have no assurance that we shall live another day, no not so
much as the next minute. When we go abroad, we know not whether we shall
return home; nor when we are at home, whether we shall live to go abroad;
when we go to bed, we cannot tell whether we shall ever rise; and when we
rise, whether we shall again go to bed. For many have been thus suddenly
taken away, going well out of doors, and never returning; lying down securely
to take their rest, have been found dead the next morning. Now seeing that
which befalls one, may happen to any, and that which has been the case of
many, may probably betide any one; let it be our wisdom to stand continually
upon our watch, that we may be found in readiness, seeing it is a matter that
concerns us no less, then the everlasting salvation or damnation of our
souls. And seeing we are not sure of living another day, let us think that
every day may be the last, and so take occasion to watch carefully over our
ways, that we may, when God pleases to call, be prepared to go unto him with
cheerfulness and joy: and when we are enticed to commit any sin; as to love
the world immoderately, to increase our riches by fraud and deceit, or violence
and oppression, to swear, lie, and profane the Lords Day, to drink drunken,
commit filthiness, or any other sin; let us say unto our own souls, Would
I commit this or that sin, if I were sure that this day were my last? Far
would it be from me, if I were thus persuaded. And therefore let me be now as
far from giving way willingly unto any of these, or the like sins, seeing,
for ought I know, it may be the last minute. And thus when we find our selves
slack and backward unto any duties of Gods service, let us examine our own
hearts, whether we would not shake off all sluggishnesse, and go about them
with all care and diligence, if we were persuaded that we should not live
another day; and then if we be wise, we will be as circumspect and careful
that we neglect no good duty which may bring comfort to our hearts, peace to
our consciences, and assurance of salvation to our souls; seeing many as lusty
as we, being well in the morning, have been dead before night.

. Sect. 4 The last means is, to meditate often on the day of Judgment.
The last means, which I will here touch, is, that we often meditate upon
that great and terrible Day of the Lord, when he shall come with 2. Cor. 5. 10.
thousands of his holy Saints and Angels to judge both the quick and the dead;
when as we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, that every
man may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done,
whether it be good or bad. Of which Day, because we are uncertain when it will
be, we should always keep our spiritual watch, that we may, whenever
Christ comes, be found ready. And this use our Savior himself makes of his
assured and yet uncertain coming: Of that day and Mar. 13. 32, 33.
hour (says he) knows no man, no not the Angels which are in heaven,
neither the son, but the Father only: Take ye heed therefore, watch and
pray; for ye know not when the time is; lest coming suddenly, he find you
sleeping. So likewise the Apostle Peter; The end of all things is at hand, be
ye therefore 1. Pet 4. 7.
sober, and watch unto prayer. And surely, if we would but seriously consider
with what rauishing joy at that Day the hearts of all those shall be possessed,
who, like wise and faithful servants, shall be found watching and waiting for
the coming of their Lord, when as he who has pronounced Mat. 24. 45, 46.
them blessed already, shall then enter them into the full fruition of
blessedness, and make them joint -owners of all that he has, the
unspeakable joys, inestimable riches, and triumphant glory of his Kingdom;
and on the other side, with what shame and confusion of face, vexation of
spirit, and horror of conscience, they shall be plagued and tormented, who
with the evil servant have securely gone on in their sins, and have utterly
neglected the spiritual watch, hoping that the Masters coming was far off;
we would be moved hereby to shake off all carnal security, and think no
care and diligence too great in keeping this watch, that we may not be taken
unprovided and unprepared at the coming of our Lord. And these are the means,
which if we carefully use, will much help us in keeping this watch. But let us

assuredly, that if he give over his watch, and leave us to our own, we shall

CAP. XIIII.
Of Meditation, which is the second private means of a godly life, what it is,
and the causes thereof, with the reasons which may move us to this holy
exercise.

. Sect. 1 The reason why it is here handled.
THe second private means whereby we are enabled unto the duties of a godly
life, is Meditation. For howsoever reading of the Word, and of other holy
writings, does go before it in order of nature, because it inlighteneth the
mind, and teaches us how to meditate, and also prepares and ministers unto
us matter of Meditation, the which must be first known, before we can think
and meditate upon it, or make use of it, by working it upon our hearts, wills,
and affections: yet seeing it is an action done by our selves alone, and the
other is a duty, which may and ought to be performed both by our selves, and
others with us; I will reserve the handling hereof, till I come to entreat of
the res^* which are in this respect of like nature. Concerning Meditation, it
is so much beaten upon, and thoroughly handled already, both by more ancient
Writers, and also modern, who of later times have spent much study and pains
about it, and whose Mr. Rogers Practice of Christianity herein excellently
enlarged in the abridgeing. Art of Meditation by D. Hall.
works are extant, both in our own and ^^her languages, that it might well
have saved me a labor, this Treatise now beginning to swell above the bounds
and banks, which in my (...) intentions I had prefixed unto it. Yea so

written of this Argu(...)e, who in his kind leaves all others far behind
him, be (...) Physician for the soul, that he is able by his Art to joy(...),

even purging Medicines as (...)s taste as banketting dishes; that I should have
been (...) quite discouraged to have written (as it were an Iliads after (...)
any thing of this Argument, did not the necessity of perfecting ^hi^ ^reatise
impose it upon me, in which, being ^n essential member, It could not have
been wanting without a maime. In which regard, rather then I would leave the
Reader in his studious course to a new disquisition, I have made bold with this
learned Author, to borrow some materials for my building, of him who is so
rich to lend, and to enrich my Cabinet with some of his Jewels, (though set out
after an homely manner in mine own foyles) seeing these spiritual treasures
are of such a nature that community hinders not propriety, and he that
lends, has never the less.

. Sect. 2 What Meditation is, and how it differs from other exercises of the
mind.
But that we may proceed to our purpose; Meditation in a general
signification, is nothing else, but to think a^^ consider of any thing often
and Meditari nil aliud est, quam multoties rem aliquam considerare. Th. Aquin.
seriously. And as we here more strictly ^^ke it, restraining it to a special
subject, Meditation is a religious exercise of a Christian, wherein he
purposely applies his mind to discourse diversely upon some divine subject,
spiritual or heavenly, that hereby he may glorify God, and further his own
salvation, by improouing the light of his understanding, increasing the
sanctity of his heart and affections, and the better inabling him unto all
duties of a godly life. The which description, in some sort both shows the
nature of Meditation, and also distinguishes it from other acts and exercises
of the mind which may seem somevvhat like unto it. For it differs from
cogitation, which is but a simple act of the mind, thinking of its object
slightly and ouerly, and so leaving it; whereas Meditation is more advised and
serious, and reflecteth its light upon the heart, will and affection, to direct
them in their choice, both in choosing and embracing that which is good, and the
refusing and abhorring of that which is evil. It differs also from
consideration, which is exercised in deliberating about some thing doubtful,
true or false, good or evil, that discerning it aright, we may know whether to
take or leave it: but Meditation is conversant about things in some measure
known in the understanding, that by this further discourse of reason, they may
not only be better known, but also that this knowledge may reflect upon the
will and affections, and be made more effectual for our use in the well
ordring of our lives. It differs also from Prayer, in that howsoever both are
the speech of the mind; yet in that, we speak to our own souls, but in
this, we speak directly to God himself. Notwithstanding, there is such
affinity between them, that in the Scriptures they are both signified by the
same word, and often taken the one for the other. For they have both for the
most part one subiect-matter, and both alike effectual for the obtaining of
all things needful; seeing whether we confess our sins unto God, or
acknowledge our wants, or crave supply in a Meditation directed to our own
souls, or in a prayer to him he alike hears both, and is alike ready to
satisfy our desires in (...) soever they are presented unto him. Neither do
we conf(...) lay open our wants for his better information, to (...)e already,
but that we our selves may take notice (...)g to a more through sense and
feeling of them, m(...)amed with fervent desires to have our sins
pardone(...) wants supplied, which are no other then prayers in his estima(...)
what form soever they are expressed. Finally, howsoever in nature ^^ere is
small difference between Meditation and Contemplation, yet as the Schools
define it, there is some in degree; Meditation being an exercise of a lower and
meaner nature, within the reach of all Christians which will put out their hand
unto it; Contemplation more high and heavenly, fit only for such as by long
exercise have attained to much perfection: That, exercised about any spiritual
object, not only originally in the understanding, but also imaginary, and
brought unto it by the Ministry of the senses, as the creation of the world,
the death and passion of Christ, and such like; but this about things chiefly
intellectual, sublime, and heavenly; as the nature and attributes of God, the
Trinity of persons in Vni^^ of essence, the joys of heaven, and others of like
nature. Finally, it is an exercise, which of the most is performed with much
difficulty, because of their weaknesses and want of use, being hindered in
their spiritual flight, by having the weight of earthly cares and distractions
(as it were) hanging at their heels, and the wings of their souls somewhat
besmeared with the lime of worldly vanities; but this, of great Proficients,
who by much practice have brought their Art into an habit, and are able with
ease, yea with much pleasure and delight, to soar (with the Eagle) an high
pitch in their heavenly thoughts, and to spend herein great part of their
time, not stooping toward the earth, but when they are forced by natural
necessity; which being satisfied, and their bodies and minds somewhat
refreshed, they do, as weary of the earth, raise up their souls, and renew
their wonted flight.

. Sect. 3 Of the efficicient cause or person who is to meditate.
The efficient cause, or person who is to perform this exercise, is the
Christian only, and the man regenerate; for holy things must not be Hag. 2.
13.
touched with profane hands, seeing they do not sanctify them, but are
polluted with their uncleanness. Neither can they that are dead in sin, do
the actions of the living, and are so far from performing this holy duty in
any acceptable manner, that they are not able so much as to think a good
thought. Neither is it enough that we be once purged from their guilt and
punishment in our justification, by the death and bloodshed of Christ applied
by faith, or that we be freed from the corruption of sin, in the first acts
of our sanctification; but seeing we do daily renew our sins, and thereby
defile our souls and bodies, we must daily cleanse them by renewing our
repentance, and not presume to undertake this holy work, living and lying in
our spiritual defilements, but we must wash our souls (as sometimes the
Israelites their clothes) before we presume to approach unto this mount of
Meditation, wherein God has promised to be seen; and to cleanse the Tables of
our hearts with the tears of true contrition, before we go about to have any
holy impressions written in them. And seeing sin, like a thick cloud, does
dim and dazzle the eyes of our minds, so as we cannot see holy and heavenly
things, we must first dispell them by unfeigned repentance, before we can
receive any comfort of divine and heavenly light. And being to entertain our
Bridegroom Christ, in his spiritual presence, into our hearts, (as it were)
into our houses, and to solace our souls in a more here communion and
familiarity with him, we are first to purge them from all noisome defilements,
which will make our company loathsome unto him; and though we cannot so
sufficiently purify them, that they may be worthy to entertain so pure and
holy a ghest, yet at least, in a sincere affection let us labor to do the
best we can, that it may not appear to be a fault of negligence, but of our
spiritual poverty and impotency, which disableth us to give him any better
welcome. The formal cause of this exercise, is a serious cogitation, or
intentive deliberation; Neither is this work of the Lord to be done
negligently and slightly, letting the reins loose to our cogitations, that
they may wander whither they list, but we are to intend the whole powers of
our mind unto it, and to set them strictly to this holy task, not suffering
them to wander abroad whither they please, but to apply themselves to that
which they have undertaken, until they have brought their work unto some good
perfection. The subiect-matter of our Meditation is something divine,
spiritual, and heavenly: unto which our thoughts, for the time it lasts, are
to be restrained, and not suffered to wander after, or to intermingle with them
any worldly things. The final causes or ends of it, are the glory of God, and
our own salvation, both which are advanced, when as we handle after an holy
manner in our Meditations, some such holy and spiritual matter, as may tend to
the bettering of our judgments, and increase of our inward sanctity, by
working in our hearts the love and fear of God, zeal and devotion in his
service, an utter hatred of sin, and a sincere purpose to please him in all
things, and to glorify his Name, by performing more carefully and conscionably
all the duties of a godly life.

. Sect. 4 That Meditation is an exercise which belongs to all Christians.
And thus we see generally what Christian Meditation is, and the causes of it;
the which being a singular and effectual means of working in our hearts a
great increase of all saving graces, and of strengthening us to the duties of a
godly life, is not to be appropriated unto any one profession or sort of men
(which were a dangerous Monopoly, tending to the inestimable prejudice of the
Christian Commonwealth, when such a singular commodity as is profitable for
all, is engrossed into the hands of some few) but is to be laid out in common
to all the faithful, who are any way interessed in grace or godliness.
Neither ought any sort or sex to think that they are exempted from this
exercise, unless they think themselves so strong in grace, that all means of
spiritual growth are needless, or so weak and impotent, that they hold them
boot less; seeing such exemption is no prerogative, but a disfranchisement, at
least, in part of their spiritual freedom, and a loss of a singular
privilege, which the Lord, in that great Charter of his Covenant made in
Christ, has granted unto them. For he has not only allowed all the faithful
to have the Book of his Law in their hands to read it, or in their mouths to
talk of it, but with the finger of his Spirit has written and engraven it in
their Jer. 31. 34.
hearts, that they may continually think and meditate upon it: Yea, he has
not only left it unto us as a gracious liberty, which we may take and leave at
our pleasure, but has strictly imposed it upon all his people as a necessary
duty. These words which I command thee this day, shall be in thine Deuteronomy 6. 6,
8. and 11. 18.
heart, and in thy soul, and thou sha^^ bind them for a sign upon thine hand,
and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. Bind them continually
upon Pro. 6. 21.
thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. So the Lord inioyneth Joshua,
though a Captain and chief Magistrate, that he should not suffer the Josh.
1. 8.
Law of God to depart out of his mouth, but that he should meditate therein
day and night, that he might observe to do according to all that was written
therein. And thus we are, as the Apostle exhorts, to have our conversation in
heaven, Phil. 1. 20.
which is chiefly done, when as we chiefly mind heavenly and spiritual things,
and set our affections (as he speaks elsewhere) on things above, and Col. 3.
2, 3.
not on things upon the earth. For where our chief life is, there our heart
and soul should be: but we are dead to the world and flesh, and our life is
hid with Christ in God; being then to appear, when as Christ shall appear in
glory. Of which duty and Christian exercise, we have an example in holy David,
who in many places professes, that he meditated in Gods Law day Psalm. 119.
15, 48, 72.
and night, that is, had his thoughts fixed upon holy things at all times, and
upon all good occasions: and that they were sweeter to his soul and spiritual

taste, then honey to his mouth, and that he esteemed them in his judgment,
and answerably affected them in his heart, above gold, yea much fine gold;
which made him not to put it off, as a work to be done Verse. 103.
at his best leisure, but rather then he would want time to do it; his eyes

prevented the night watches, that he might meditate in Gods Word. And thus the
blessed Virgin having heard the words of our Savior Christ, is said to have
pondred them in her heart; that is, by meditating upon them in her Luk 2. 19.
mind, she had wrought them into her heart and affections.

. Sect. 5 The first reason taken from the excellency of this exercise.
Which examples, that we may imitate, let us consider the reasons which may
persuade us unto it. The first whereof, is the excellency of this holy
exercise, which aduanceth us unto high and heavenly privileges. For it
increases our sweet communion with God, the chief Goodness, in whose
fruition consists all our happiness, and gives us admittance into his
presence, and liberty to talk and confer with him, as with our friend, about
all things which concern his glory and our own salvation. It exalts our
minds and souls above the highest pitch of worldly things, and causes us,
even whilst we are upon earth, to have our conversation in heaven. It causes
us, whilst we carry about with us this body of flesh, to be heavenly minded,
and partakers of the Divine nature, whilst by this near society and
familiarity, it makes us like unto God, with whom we converse in holiness
and happiness. It enters us into the first de grees of the heavenly joys,
and as our state of mortality will bear, it imparteth unto us some first
beginnings of the vision and fruition of God, and inableth us (with Moses) to
discern, as we are capeable, some small glimpses of his glory. And as his face
did shine, when he had conuersed with God in his bodily presence; so our
souls do shine in purity, brightness, and glory, by coming near unto him,
and entertaining with him this spiritual communion. And as the wax, which is
yellow in its own nature, by lying long in the beams of the Sun, changes
the color, and attaineth unto a Virgin-like whiteness and purity; so we, who
with the Spouse in the Canticles, are brown and black through natural
infirmities, do become more bright and beautiful, whilst conuersing with our
Bridegroom Christ in this near familiarity, the beams of his love and favor
do shine upon us.

. Sect. 6 The second reason, taken from the profit of it.
The second reason, is the profit of Meditation, which is inestimable; seeing
it is fit and useful to all purposes. For if we bind Gods will and Word Pro.
6. 22, 23.
continually upon our heart, and tie it about our necks; when we go, it shall
lead us; when we sleep, it shall keep us; and when we are awake, it shall
talk with us. By the help of it, we make use of all other helps, it serving
to the soul, as the stomach to the body, for the well disgesting of all
spiritual nourishment. In which respect, one holds it for no better then
presumption, Nulla ars doceri praesumitur, nisi intenta prius meditatione
discatur. Greg. in pastor. lib. 1. c. 1.
for any to take upon them to teach any other Arts, unless himself have first
learned, and made it his own by intentive Meditation. By it we come to the
sight and sense of our corruptions, which lie lurking and hidden in us,
impossible to be purged and reformed, because they are not so much as
discovered. By it we find out our wants, that we may use means whereby they
may be supplied; and discover our weaknesses, that we may labor to get more
strength. By it we discover the subtle stratagems of our spiritual enemies,
that we may avoid them; and are fore-armed against their tentations, and
strengthened to overcome them. By it we spy out the wiles of our own
deceitful hearts, their shifts and cunning devices, their windings and
turnings, rouings and wanderings; and bringing them in subjection to the
spiritual part, do reduce them into some order. By it we banish vain
cogitations and lusts of the flesh, and cause our minds and hearts to be taken
up with such thoughts and desires as are holy and religious. It is the best
preservative against all sin, and a most sovereign antidote against carnal
security, whilst it discovers our spiritual danger, and moves us to
prevent it by timely repentance. It singularly improoueth our spiritual
estate, by increasing saving and fruitful knowledge, inward sanctity in our
affections, and the outward practice of it in our lives. It inricheth our
souls with all spiritual and saving Est animorum, ingeniorumque nostrorum
natural quoddam pabulum, consideratio, contemplatioque naturae: doctoque
homini and erudito, cogitare est viuere, Cicer. lib. 4. Acad. quaest. Omnis
profectus ex lectione and meditatione procedit: quae enim nescimus, ex lectione
discimus, meditatione conseruamus, Isidor. de summo bono. Psalm. 1. 1, 2.
graces, faith, hope, charity, affiance, and the true fear of God. It is the
spur of our devotion, the fuel of our zeal, and the common incentitiue to all
virtue. It is the food of our souls, by which they are spiritually nourished,
and even the life of our life, as an Heathen could see by the light of nature.
It weaneth our hearts and minds from the world, and lifts them up to heaven.
It makes us to walk with God as Enoch, and (like Elias his body in the fiery
Chariot) it carries our souls into heaven. By it, in our solitariness, we
enjoy God and our selves, and by conuersing with him, we are fitted and made
profitable for all good company. In a word, as one says, all spiritual profit
and progress in godliness, proceeds from reading and meditation; for what
we know not, we learn by reading, and by meditation hold it when we have it.
And as it is the means of all grace and goodness in this life, so also it
assures us of all glory and happiness in the life to come. For, Blessed is
the man who so delights in the Law of the Lord, that he does meditate in it
day and night.

. Sect. 7 The third reason taken from the necessity of this exercise.
The third and last reason is taken from the necessity of this holy exercise,
the neglect whereof depriueth us of all the former benefits and privileges.
For thereby we lose the comfort and joy which we have in this sweet communion
with God; we become insensible of our sins and spiritual wants, and so grow
careless in using those good means for the mortifying of the one, and
supplying of the other. We take the ready way to continue in carnal security,
and to live in our sins without repentance. We lie open to the tentations of
our spiritual enemies, and easily fall into their secret ambushments at
unawares, by reason we never think of them, nor of the means whereby we may
escape them. We are soon deceived with our own false hearts, when as we
never sound their deceits unto the bottom, and give Satan leave to fill them
with worldly and wicked thoughts, and with sensual and carnal desires and
lusts, when as he finds them like empty houses, swept clean, and cleared
Mat. 12. 45.
of all good meditations, and garnished with sloth, vanity and security, the
chief ornaments wherein he delights. We lose piece-meale all our spiritual
armor, and not repairing the breaches which have been made by the enemies of
our salvation, we lie open to their assaults, and are easily vanquished in the
next encounter, whilst we never think of any approaching danger. We defraud
our souls of a chief part of their food, whereby they should be nourished in
all saving grace, and strengthened unto all Christian duties: we lose the heat
and fervor of our zeal and devotion, which being no natural qualities
residing in their proper elements, cool and decline when we withdraw from
the^ the fuel by which they are nourished. We lose the comfort of our
heavenly freedom, when as we never have our conversation there, and suffer our
hearts to lie groueling upon the earth without any spiritual motions, which
like the peyzes and plummets of a clock, do naturally descend and sink down,
unless they be often pulled up with spiritual and heavenly meditations.
Finally, we put out, or cloze up the eyes of our souls, so as they cannot
look into our selves, nor into our spiritual estate, to see our miseries,
that we may be humbled, nor the means of our freedom and deliverance, that
we may be comforted; our poverty and defects, nor Christ's riches and full
payment, our natural defects, and spiritual abilities in him that
strengthens us, our gifts and graces, our wants and weaknesses; our sins
committed, our duties neglected or performed, our dangers, and means to escape
them; our way to happiness, and what progress we have made in it. And as we
cannot, through this neglect of meditation, take notice of our selves, so are
we thereby estranged from God, neither seeing nor observing his nature or
attributes, his mercy to love him, his justice to fear him, his power and
truth in his promises, that we may believe and trust in him; the administration
both of his benefits conferred upon those that love and obey him, nor of his
Judgments and punishments, threatened and inflicted upon those who continue in
their sins, that by this experience of others good and harms, we may become
wise in choosing such a course as may gain the one, and avoid the other.

CAP. XV.
Of extraordinary Meditation.

. Sect. 1 What extraordinary meditation is, and the subject of it.
ANd thus much of meditation in general: The which, howsoever it does not
easily admit of any formal distribution 1. These. 5. 17.
according to the strict rules of art, yet it may, like prayer, be
distinguished into two kinds. For as prayers are either extraordinary and at
large, the which are continually to be made, and at any time whatsoever, when
any fit occasion or opportunity is offered either of petition, or
thanksgiving, the which we call Eiaculations; or else ordinary and at set
times, when as with due preparation we purposely compose our selves to
perform this duty in a solemn manner: So our meditations may be distinguished
into such as are extraordinary and at large; or else ordinary and at set times,
when as with due deliberation and preparation, setting all other things apart,
we settle our selves to spend some time in this religious exercise. The former
sort of meditations are sudden, and continually in use, when any occasion or
opportunity is offered and observed, by outward objects presented to our
senses, especially the sight and hearing, or by some inward conceit in our
imagination or discourse of our minds, whereof we may make some spiritual use,
and raise up our minds from the earth toward heaven, in some holy meditation.
The which may be done at all times, and in all employments, as in the works of
our callings, or in our honest recreations, when we are in company, or
solitary and by our selves. But especially the large book of the creatures
affords unto us most plentiful matter of this kind of meditation, when
either they put us in mind of their and our Creator, or of some of his
attributes shining clearly in them. In the former respect, David says, that
the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shows Psalm. 19. 1.
and 69. 34. and 89. 5.
his handy work, that is, offer unto us fit occasion of glorifying God, when
as we see their excellency and order, and of admiring and magnifying his
wisdom and power, who was able of nothing to make so goodly a frame and
excellent workmanship. And in regard of the latter, he tells us in another
place, that they did occasionally, as good Schoolmasters, teach him another
lesson, namely, to see and admire the infinite love and undeserved goodness of
God toward mankind. When I consider (says he) the Psalm. 8. 3, 4.
heavens, the work of thy fingers, the Moon and the stars which thou have
ordained; What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that
thou visitest him? And thus Solomon sends the sluggard to the Ant, to Prou.
6. 6. Esa. 1. 1.
learn of her diligence; and Esaias a refractory people, to the Ox and Ass to
learn duty and obedience; and Jeremy the negligent and secure Ier. 8. 7.
Jews, to the Storke, Turtle, Crane and Swallow, to learn of them to observe
Gods appointed times, that they might not let his judgments pass unregarded,
but seasonably turn unto him by true repentance. And our Savior Christ
sends such as vex themselves with distrustful and carking cares, to the
Fowls of the air, and to the Lillies of the field, which without their care
only by Gods blessing and good providence live, Math. 6. 26, 28.
grow and flourish. And thus he himself, from the water of Jacobs well, takes
Ioh. 4. 14.
occasion to think and discourse of the Water of Life; and from the Ioh. 6.
27, 32.
meat that perishes, and the Manna in the Wilderness, to meditate and speak
of the Bread of Life which came down from heaven. And after the same manner
may we take occasion of some holy meditation by the view and consideration of
any action or occurrent, especially where we may in a lively manner behold the
administration of Gods mercies or judgments, in rewards or punishments, or
when we seriously behold any of Gods creatures. As when we see the beauty of
the heavens, and the brightness of the Sun, we may take occasion thereby
to think of his infinite glory, beauty and brightness that made them; when
we behold their goodly and constant order, to think of his immutability. So
their durablenesse may put us in mind of his eternity, their vast greatness,
of his immensity. The earths barrenness, of our fall and sin; her
fruitfulness, of Gods blessing renewed in Christ, and how we ought to
answer this mercy, in bringing forth the fruits of obedience, lest being
often Heb. 6. 4, 5.
watered and remaining fruitless, we be the second time accursed. Neither
has the Lord created his mighty host of innumerable creatures, adorned them
with such beauty, distinguished them in such varieties, furnished them with
such excellent properties, that we should only have a sensual use of them,
wherein the brutish creatures may exceed us, but that we should take occasion
by them, to glorify him in his excellent workmanship, and learn something
from them for our better instruction, that we may imitate them in that which
is good, or shun and avoid that which is evil in them. Which who so
neglect, deprive themselves, in their use, of the best part, whereby they
might receive as much profit for their souls, as they do for their bodies in
that use which is common and ordinary. And thus we are to furnish our selves
with fit matter for these extraordinary and sudden meditations. But here (as
our learned Artist has well observed) some cautions are to be used: as first,
that there be some similitude between the matter, and the meditation which is
raised from it; that it may not be strained and far-fetched, but kindly and
familiar. For want of which resemblance, our meditations will prove loose and
wandering, and leave behind them no impression: whereas similitude and likeness
in the matter to the meditation, will recall the one to our remembrance, as often
as we see or observe the other. Secondly, we must avoid such matter of
meditation as God has expressly forbidden, as namely, Images, to put us in
mind of him, or any essential part of his worship; Ier. 10. 8, 15. Zach. 10.
2. Habak. 2. 18.
seeing they lead us unto idolatry, will worship and superstition, and teach
us nothing but vanity and lies, namely, to conceive of him as visible and
corporal, who is incorporeall and invisible; and as circumscriptible and
finite, who is immense and infinite. Thirdly, seeing God has given us such
plentiful variety of matter in this kind, we must not dwell too long upon, or
follow too much one thing in our meditations, which will cause satiety and
wearines, but take our liberty of choice in this great plenty, provided that
this liberty turn not to licentiousness, and give occasion to our minds of
idle rouing and wandering from one thing to another, without serious thinking of
any thing, that we may fit it for some good use. And finally, these
meditations must not be long and tedious, which is not agreeable to their
nature, nor will conveniently suit with our company and occasions, but rather
distract us from our business, and duties of our callings, which ordinarily we
must tend; but they must, like eiaculations in prayer, be short, as they are
sudden, unless time, leisure and solitude afford us more liberty.

. Sect. 2 What ordinary meditation is, and the subject of it.
The other kind of meditation which is ordinary, set, solemn and deliberate,
is, when as purposely setting apart all other business, and sequestring our
selves from all company, we do bend our mind, with all studious intention, to
discourse deliberately upon some spiritual subject or part of Gods Word, which
we know in some measure, that by diligent insisting, serious debating, and
deep musing upon it, till we have brought it to some spiritual use and good
issue, we may apply it to our particular use for the further inlightening of
our understandings, and the confirming of our judgments, and also for the
purging and sanctifying of our hearts and affections, the stirring up of our
zeal and devotion, and the bettering and amending of our lives and
conversation; making choice of such place, time, gesture, and other
circumstances, as may best fit and further us in this holy exercise. And this
is that kind of meditation which is chiefly intended and commended unto us in
the holy Scriptures, both by the precepts before quoted, and also by the
examples of Gods Saints and servants, as of Isaac, who is said, toward
evening, to have gone out into Genesis 24. 63.
the fields to meditate, of which that Scripture speaks in such a manner, as
though it had been his daily exercise. So David professes, that Gods Law and
Word was his daily meditation, as we may see in the hundred and nineteenth
Psalm, wherein he not only testifies his doing of it, but also, as by an
example, proves it, seeing that Psalm is nothing else but an heavenly
meditation, the subject matter whereof is the holy Law of God. Even as in many
other Psalms he meditateth upon diverse other subjects. As who are to be
esteemed truly happy, and heirs of eternal Psalm. 1. and 15. Psalm. 37. and 73.
Psalm. 22. Psalm. 10. 5. and 106.
blessedness; the temporary prosperity of the wicked; the passion and
sufferings of Christ; the benefits of God conferred upon his unworthy people,
and many others: all which do plainly prove, that which he professes, namely,
that this meditation in Gods Law was his daily exercise.

. Sect. 3 The difficulty of this religious exercise.
Which examples that we may imitate, I will first consider the reasons which
may move us, and remove the impediments which might hinder and discourage us
from the undertaking of this exercise, and then set down the doctrine and
practice of it in a form of meditation, that so we may be instructed in the
right use of it; and have a plain example to lead us as it were by the hand,
and to enable us to frame the like upon other occasions. The reasons may be
reduced to the same heads which I propounded in the general consideration of
this duty; all which do specially and chiefly belong to this kind of
meditation, as being above the other much more excellent, profitable and
necessary. For if it be a privilege of excellency to come into Gods sight,
then much more for some good time to continue and converse with him; if we may
think our selves highly advanced, if we may for the least moment be admitted
into his presence, and suffered to salute him: then how much rather, when we
may be permitted to have free conference with him, and our souls in his
presence? But as it is truly said of all things excellent, that they are also
hard and difficult; so may both these be truly verified of this exercise, then
the which, as no other is more excellent, (prayer and contemplation excepted,
which exceed in some degrees in the same kind) so there is none besides them of
greater difficulty. First, in that our corrupt nature is not more auerse unto
any other duty; both because we take our whole delight in things that are
connaturall and subject to the senses, and our minds are soon tired with
meditating seriously upon those things which are merely intellectual and
abstracted from the senses; and also because our carnal hearts, which take
their chief pleasure and contentment, in thinking upon, and affecting worldly
things, are ready to murmr and repine when they are restrained of their
liberty, and kept hard to this spiritual task; and to break loose and fly
out every hand-while, that they may roue and wander after their wonted
delights. Secondly, because in other spiritual exercises, as hearing the Word,
reading and conferring with others, we have but to deal with men (as we
conceive it) at least in respect of immediate actions, objects and intercourse,
which we perform with greater alacrity, because the senses are exercised in
them about outward things: But in this exercise of meditation we are soon
wearied (as the senses exercized about excelling objects) both because the
subject matter about which we discourse in our minds, is spiritual and
heavenly, and also because we cast up our accounts, lay open our sins,
search out our wants and weaknesses, seriously examine our hearts how we
have behaved our selves in the doing or neglecting of our duty, and laying them
naked before God without all hypocrisy, confessing our sins of which we find
our selves guilty, accusing our selves where we are faulty, discovering our
wants and weaknesses wherein we are defective; all which are not done before
our equals, but before the glorious King of heaven and earth (as malefactors
before their Judge) whose might and Majesty, sovereignty and power of life and
death may justly ouer-awe us. The which difficulties notwithstanding must not
so much discourage us from this exercise, as the excellency must encourage us
to undertake it with so much the more strong resolution and earnest endeavor.

. Sect. 4 The singular profit of ordinary meditation.
To which purpose let us further consider, that as this kind of meditation is
above all other most excellent, so also it exceeds in use and profit. For it
is the spiritual food of the souls, by which they live and thrive in all
saving graces, and are strengthened unto the performance of all Christian
duties. It weaneth our souls from the world and worldly vanities, and
sequestreth and appropriateth them to religious uses. More especially, it
inlighteneth our understanding, and makes us in discoursing of spiritual
things, to see them much more clearly and perfectly; for as we are wont to say
of our bodily parts and members, Use them and have them, because their exercise
is the means to continue their health, and increase their strength; so may it
also be truly said of the inward faculties of the soul, the understanding and
discourse of reason, which if they be used, grow more strong and vigorous; but
if we accustom them to sloth and idleness, they will soon languish, and wax
faint and weak in their functions and operations. Now by this inlightening of
the mind, we come to a more clear knowledge of God and Jesus Christ, whom to
Joh. 17. 3.
know is life eternal. By it we understand more perfectly his Word and will,
(in which respect meditation may be fitly called the hearts commentary) and are
thereby guided in the way of his Commandments. For if by meditation we bind
them continually upon our hearts, when we go, they Pro. 6. 22, 23.
shall lead us, as the Wise man speaks. By it also we attain unto the true
knowledge of our selves, and of our own hearts, which are so deceitful, that
they cannot otherwise be well discerned. For as our Savior has Mat. 12. 34,
35.
taught us, such as the thoughts are, such also is the heart; such as the
streams are, such likewise is the fountain from which they spring. And
therefore evil thoughts do argue an evil heart; even as contrariwise, good
thoughts, and holy meditations, do show that the heart is good also. For
howsoever our words and works are liable to much hypocrisy, because in them
we may often aim at worldly respects, and to approve our selves unto men,
rather then unto God; yet it is not so with our thoughts, which are only
known to God and our own consciences, and not subject to the view and censure
of any other. By it we come to the knowledge of our manifold corruptions, and
the malignity of our natures, and to discern the blindness and worldliness
of our minds, the perverseness of our wills, the security and hardness of
our hearts, and innumerable other vices and corruptions which otherwise would
be unknown unto our selves, even as they are now unknown to others. Yea, by
this disquisition we do not only find out this noisome filth and heaps of
uncleanness (as it were) in secret corners; but also are set aworke, to urge
out of our hearts and minds, these wicked thoughts, and filthy lusts, which
would otherwise, like pernicious humors in the body, lie lurking in them, and
be the causes of our souls sickness, and innumerable evils; and being
emptied of these wicked thoughts and noisome lusts, we are hereby moved, and
stirred up to replenish our minds and hearts with heavenly cogitations and
holy desires, and when we have admitted them, to hold them fast, that the
other may not return and recover their possession. Moreover, by this
Meditation our memories are exceedingly strengthened, and made faithful
Registers of good things. Our consciences are preserved pure, when as hereby
we are kept from falling into any known sin, or if we have fallen through
infirmity, do not lie in it, but purge away these spiritual defilements by
faith, applying unto them the blood of Christ, and by rising out of sin
through unfeigned repentance. Our judgments likewise hereby are much
improoued, quickened, and confirmed, whilst as one says; It distinguishes
things confused, and collecteth them being Bernard. de consid. lib. 1.
scattered, searches out secrets, and seeks after truth; examineth things
probable, and finds out such as are fained and colored; disposes of things
to be done, and thinks and considers of that which we have done. Our
wills likewise hereby are purged from their stubbornenesse and rebellion, and
by conuersing with God, learn to frame and fashion themselves in obedience to
his most just and holy will, and to choose and refuse good and evil, according
to the direction of holy reason.

. Sect. 5 That this Meditation effectually works upon the heart and
affections for the sanctifying of them.
And as it thus powerfully works upon the superior faculties of our souls,
so with much more efficacy upon our hearts and affections. For it not only
purges our hearts from unclean and noisome lusts, and replenisheth them with
holy and heavenly desires; but also mollifieth their hardness, and makes them
soft and tender; and as the wax, when it lies in cold places, grows so hard
and stiff, that it will break, rather then bow; but being laid in the Sun,
becomes soft, ready to melt, and fit to take any impression; so when we
neglect this duty, our hearts being estranged from God, become hard and
obdurate; but when by Meditation we draw near unto him, the beams of his
favor shining upon our hearts, do make them soft and flexible, and so fit for
any holy impression which he is pleased to make in them. And thus when our
hearts are dead and dull, this holy exercise will quicken and revive them, and
when they begin to be drowzie, through carnal security, it awakeneth and
rowzeth them up, that they do not lie snorting in the sleep of sin. It does
as much as any other Christian exercise, work upon our affections, purging
them from worldliness and sensuality, and sanctifying and fitting them for
Gods service. It inflameth our love toward God and all spiritual and heavenly
things: for as in worldly matters of looking, comes loving; so here by
meditating upon these greater excellencies, and taking (as it were) a full view
with the eyes of our mind, of their beauty and perfection, we come to have
our hearts inflamed with their love, and long after nothing more then their
fruition. It kindles also our zeal and devotion in Gods service, when as
thereby we come to see, that it is the maine end of our coming into the world,
that all other labor is utterly lost, and all our strength is spent in vain,
which is employed in the pursuit of worldly vanities that profit not; and
finally, that whatsoever pains we take in Gods service, is to good purpose,
being richly rewarded in this world and the World to come. It works in our
hearts affiance in God, when as we consider of his truth in his promises, and
allsufficiencie in performance; and a true and sonne-like fear of him, when as
we think seriously of his infinite love, his sovereignty, power, and glorious
Majesty. It draws us on to perform sincere obedience, not only passive, in
suffering what God inflicteth, when we consider that it proceeds from love,
and tends to our good, and the furthering of our salvation; but also active:
for who will not willingly serve such a Master, that duly meditateth on his
goodness in himself, and bounty toward us? Besides, by meditating upon Gods
Law, we are drawn on to keep it, when as we consider the excellency of it,
and the benefits and fruits of our obedience; and as evil thoughts are a
strong inducement to bring us to evil works; so also it is in those that are
good. For as the Apostle James seems to make it, the thoughts are the first
seeds which are suggested Iam. 1. 12, 13, 14
into our minds and hearts, the which being entertained with delight, do cause
(as it were) the first conception of our actions; and this is done, when the
affections are tickled and allured with the things, that by the thoughts are
propounded unto them; which are as ready to embrace what the judgment
approoueth, as the hungry stomach such meat as is commended unto it by the
taste. And the affections moving and inclining the will, do nourish the
conception, as the child in the womb, till it come to perfect shape, whereupon
consent follovving, it is brought to the birth, and produced into act,
opportunity serving as the Midvvife, the will, as Viceroy to reason, having
command over all the inferior powers and parts, and inioyning them to execute
that which the mind first suggested, the affections embraced, and it self
likes and approoueth. Finally, as it draws us on to obedience, so it makes
us constant in it; because it is not grounded upon Booke-knovvledge, or that
which entering by the ear, goes not much further, but floteth in the brain,
and never descends into the heart, the which fails and vanishes upon many
occasions; as the scorching heat of persecution, the tentations of the devil,
the sophistical wiles of cunning heretics, which ouerturning such a
speculatiue knowledge (as it were) the foundation, do bring all to ruin that
is built upon it; but it is settled upon such a knowledge, as is wrought into
the heart and affections by Meditation, which will not lose their hold of
those good things and sweet comforts, of which they have tasted and thoroughly
fed upon, to the nourishing of the soul in all Primum ipsum fontem suum, id
est, mentem de qua oritur purificat consideratio, deinde regit affectus,
dirigit actus, corrigit excessus, etc. Bern. de considerat. lib. 1.
grace and goodness, and strengthening of it unto all holy duties; although
the knowledge of the brain, being too weak to withstand such opposites, does
utterly fail, both in offensive arguments, and defensive answers. In a Word,
this Meditation is most profitable for all parts and purposes. For as one
says, It purifieth the mind, that is, the first fountain from which it
springs; it governs the affections, it directs the actions, corrects
excess, composeth our manners, orderly amendeth and graceth our lives, and
finally, conferreth experimental and feeling knowledge, both of things divine
and humane.

. Sect. 6 That the exercise of Meditation is very necessary.
Finally, this exercise of Meditation is no less necessary then profitable;
for it is the food of our souls, or if you will, the stomach and natural
heat whereby it is disgested, which preserves our spiritual life; without
which we can no more continue in good liking and well-being, then our bodies
without meat. For as they may live for a good time in a weak estate and poor
plight, if they cast up their food soon after they have eaten it, by virtue of
some small relics that remain behind, but can never be fat, healthy, and
strong, if the meat be not retained, concocted, and applied to the several
parts: so our souls may live the spiritual life of grace, by hearing and
reading the Word, though for want of Meditation, and thinking upon it
afterward, they retain little of their spiritual food, but cast up all
again, saving some relics, which upon occasions will come into their minds;
but they cannot be in good plight, and increase much in spiritual growth and
strength, unless they digest what they hear and read by Meditation, and
make it truly their own, by applying it to themselves. And as those beasts
that have that property of chewing the cud, are never in good health, but when
they are either feeding or chewing; so is it to be thought of us, though we
seem to feed never so eagerly (seeing it may as well be a disease, as the
goodness of our stomakes) if we take no care afterward to ruminate and
meditate upon it. Neither has it only the necessity of food, but also of
Physic, for the preserving and well ordering of our spiritual lives. And if
we would but duly consider, how full our hearts and inward parts are of noisome
lusts, and the corrupt and glutinous humors, of vice and sin; how false and
fickle, how slippery and wandering, how soon weary of good things, and how
ready and prone to all evil; we would easily conclude that it were more then
necessary, that besides our ordinary diet, we should sometimes use this
wholesome Physic, which is most effectual to purge out all these
corruptions, and to prevent and cure these spiritual diseases; and to set
purposely some time apart for this holy exercise, that we may keep our hearts
in good order, and avoid the mischiefs which these corrupt humors of sin
will bring upon our souls, if we suffer them to lie still lurking in us, and
take no care to be purged of them. Finally, this exercise of Meditation has in
it the necessity, not only of sustentation, but also of defense; as it is a
notable means to spy out the wiles and subtilties of our spiritual enemies,
to discover their might, and our wants and weaknesses, and to fit unto us the
spiritual armor, without which we cannot stand in the day of battle; and
consequently, the neglect thereof, a ready way to lay us open to all danger, by
denying one of our best helps, and giving opportunity to our enemies of all
advantages.

CAP. XVI.
Containing answers unto diverse objections made against this exercise of
Meditation.

. Sect. 1 The objection of difficulty acknowledged and answered.
ANd thus I have spoken more largely of the profit and necessity of this holy
exercise, then some, perhaps, will think either necessary or profitable;
because I well knew how auerse and backward our corrupt nature is unto it. In
which regard, we no more need to be instructed in the knowledge of it, how we
may do it aright, then strong motives and inducements to enforce the practice
of that we know. For when our judgments are enlightened in the right use of
this exercise, we are still ready to frame excuses, to blind and delude our
reason, and to stop the cry of our consciences, when they accuse us for the
neglect of so necessary a duty; and even when we are ready to go about it,
our sloth and security pretends such necessary impediments, and casts such
stumbling blocks in our way, that we are discouraged from proceeding in it.
As first, we are ready to allege, that it is a matter of great difficulty for
us that are in the world, to sequester our minds wholly from worldly things,
that they may be wholly taken up with those which are spiritual and heavenly,
and are so far out of the reach of our natural abilities. And surely it
cannot be denied, but that this duty, as all other things excellent, is hardly
achieved; for being but children in knowledge, and weakelings in grace, it is
no more easy to attend any serious exercises, profitable for our souls
health, then it is for boys to banish out of their minds childish vanities,
and to apply themselves wholly to their studies, that they may get learning,
and become good scholars. But this must not make us to neglect this exercise,
but considering how excellent, profitable, and necessary it is, we must be so
much the more earnest in our resolutions, and diligent in our endeavors, to set
our selves seriously about it, by how much it appears to be of greater
difficulty. To which purpose, let us know, that as children find most
discouragements, and greatest difficulty in attaining to learning in their
first entrance, but afterward, when they are come to some proficiency, find
it more easy, and tasting the sweetness of it, go on in their studies, with
cheerfulness and delight: so the greatest difficulty is in the first
beginnings of this holy exercise; seeing use and practice will make it easy
and familiar; and the sweetness which we shall find in it to our spiritual
taste, and the fruit and benefit which we shall reap by it, richly
recompencing all our labor, will take away all tediousness, and make us to
perform it with all cheerfulness. And as those which have been trained up
in the delightful studies of Poetry, Philosophy, and History, in the
Universities, can hardly apply themselves to the study of the Law, yet do at
the first bend, and even enforce their minds to it, being encouraged with
golden hopes, and afterward coming to practice, proceed with delight, when
they become sensible of the gain; so our minds, having been inured to wander
about earthly things, which are most pleasing to our carnal appetite, can
hardly apply themselves to spiritual and heavenly Meditations, which are harsh
and unpleasant to our corrupt nature; but even then we must with an holy
violence bend our minds unto them, being encouraged with our more then golden
hopes; and then without doubt, when we have made some good proceedings in our
spiritual practice, the sensible sweetness which we shall relish in it, and
the manifold benefits, and plentiful fruits which we shall reap by this
exercise, will encourage us to proceed in it with much comfort and delight.

. Sect. 2 The objection of natural want and weaknesses in performing this
exercise answered.
Secondly, we are apt to pretend our natural weakness and imbecility to
perform so high and hard a duty, as the ignorance of our minds, the
auersenesse of our hearts, the coldness of our zeal, devotion, and such like.
But these wants and inabilities should not discourage us from this exercise,
but move us to use it so much the rather, because it is a chief means
ordained of God to increase our strength, and to bring us to more perfection.
We do not, because we are weak and sickly in our bodies, abstain altogether
from food and Physic, but the rather use them, that we may recover our health
and strength. Yea, when our appetite is small, we force our selves, that by
eating a little at once, we may get a stomach. We do not shut the windows,
because the house is dark, and we dimsighted; but are ready the sooner to
open them, to let in the light, of which we stand in need more then others, in
respect of our natural defects, that we may the better dispatch our business;
and the colder we feel our selves, the more necessary we think it to come
unto the fire, or to use some exercise, that we may recover our natural heat.
And so in like manner, the sight of these defects should not hinder us from
this exercise; seeing it is the means to inlighten our minds with more
knowledge, to get spiritual health and strength, whereby we may be enabled to
perform this and all other good duties daily in more perfection; and to warm
our cold and frozen hearts, that we may perform service unto God, with more
heat of godly zeal and fervor of devotion. Besides, though we be not able of
our selves, so much as to think a good thought, yet if in obedience to God we
use this his holy Ordinance, he will enable us unto it, being allsufficient to
make us both to think and do whatsoever he requires at our hands.

. Sect. 3 Their objection answered, who pretend want of matter to meditate upon.
Thirdly, we are ready to object want of matter to meditate upon, and that we
are so barren in our invention, that the fire of our devotion is ready to go
out as soon as it is kindled, for want of this fuel to nourish and preserve
it. But this is to excuse one negligence with another, seeing the Lord has set
before us, and even put into our hands the large Volume of his Creatures, and
the Book of holy Scriptures, in both which, there is abundant matter of
Meditation, if we had but the hearts to view and read them; besides, the
consideration of our own misery, our manifold sins and corruptions, wants
and imperfections, Gods manifold mercies, and innumerable blessings vouchsafed
unto us, the administration of his judgments, and such like, of which I shall
have occasion to speak more hereafter. And therefore there being no want of
good seed, we have no cause to complain of any thing but the barrenness of
our hearts, and their auersenesse to good things, if they bring not forth, in
this kind, plentiful fruits. The which, as it is to be bewailed with true
sorrow, that we who have matter enough to think and meditate upon in vvorldly
things, for a whole year together, though none be prepared to our hands, being
herein such quick Workmen, that we can both gather our straw, and burn our
brick in full tale, should be so barren of matter, when we come to think of
things spiritual and heavenly; so it must move us with so much the more
diligence and earnestness to read and study the Scriptures, and to observe
the works of God, and finding our emptiness, to resort to Gods storehouses
(like the Egyptians to Joseph's) that we may be filled with such provision as
he has made for us, and have no more cause to complain of want.

. Sect. 4 Other hindrances removed.
Fourthly, we are hindered from performing this duty by manifold distractions
both inward and outward. Of the former kind is the indisposition of our hearts
to spiritual and heavenly things, and their readiness to be carried away from
them (when they take them into their consideration) after worldly vanities. The
which so much discourageth many, that they neglect this duty altogether,
because they find themselves so unfit to perform it. But our wants and
vveakenesses should not drive us further from God, but make us rather dravv
nearer unto him, and by earnest prayer to crave the gracious assistance of his
holy Spirit, that we may be enabled thereby to serve him better. Neither must
our imperfections and distractions in performing Christian duties, move us to
neglect them altogether, for this is that which the devil would have: and if
we thus far yield unto him, we shall be sure to perform nothing that is
good, seeing he will never let distractions and discouragements to be wanting
unto us; but being thoroughly humbled in the sight of our infirmities, and
bewailing our wants, let us labor daily after more perfection. And to this end
let us use due preparation before we undertake this exercise, of which I shall
speak afterward. Secondly, let us keep the Christian watch, before spoken
of, over our hearts, and repel these distractions at their first entrance.
Thirdly, let us pray against them, and desire the Lord to strengthen us, that
they may not prevail to pull away our hearts from him. Fourthly, we must at
other times restrain our hearts and minds, that they may not wander whither
they list, and keep them under some command, that they may not be to seek
when we would employ them about holy duties. Fifthly, we must fit the length
of our Meditations to the strength of our devotion, and let them be enlarged as
it increases. Which means, when we have used, let us set upon this exercise;
and if our distractions are so great and many, that they would give us leave to
think upon nothing else, let us make them the matter of our Meditation,
accusing our hearts for their looseness and worldliness, their deadness and
backwardness to all good duties, that so we may bring them to unfeigned
repentance.

. Sect. 5 That company and worldly business should not hinder us from this
exercise of Meditation.
The outward distractions, which are alleged as necessary impediments of this
holy exercise, are the company of friends, who coming to visit us, take up
that time which should be spent about it, the multitude of business, which
affords us no leisure, and want of convenient place, wherein we might be
privately by our selves, to perform this duty which cannot be done in the
company of others. But for the first; no company should be so dear unto us, as
that it should cause us to break off our communion and society with God. Or if
to avoid inciuility and giving offense, we do intermit this exercise, and put
it off to another time: this must not make us to neglect it altogether, but we
must set our selves about it when our company is gone, and redeem this loss
by doubling our diligence in this holy exercise. And for our business and
employments, we are, according to our Saviors counsel, to think this one
thing Luke 10. 42.
necessary, and to be preferred before all other, and first to seek the
Kingdom of God, and his righteousness, esteeming no business so necessary,
as Math. 6. 33.
the enriching of our souls with spiritual grace, and using the means which
may further and assure us of our salvation; accounting those employments
worldly, carnal, and not worthy our pains, which shoulder and thrust out
spiritual exercises. And yet if our important business should wholly take us
up, and that the necessity of our estate and calling should so strictly at all
times bind us unto them, that we had no leisure for religious duties, there
were some color (and but a color) of excuse: but the fault is not in the
multitude of our employments, but either in our want of wisdom and
providence, that we do not rightly dispose of them, and allot to all sorts of
duties their seasonable times; or in our worldliness and immoderate love of
earthly things, which makes us think all time lost that is not spent about
them, and that we are quite undone, if but a little while we intermit our
diligence in seeking of them. For God by one Commandment does not cross
another, nor brings us into such straits, but that we may (if it be not our
own fault) have seasonable time of yielding our obedience to them all. He
would have us look to our state, and provide for our families, but he would
not have us so immoderate in our care and labor, that we should mind nothing
else, and have no leisure for religious duties, seeing he is both able and
willing to provide all necessaries for us and them, if casting our care upon
him, and relying upon his providence, we set apart seasonable time for both.
And therefore he would not exempt Joshua (though as a man would Josh. 1. 8.
think, wholly taken up in the wars, and in the government of a mighty
people) from spending some good part of his time in this duty of meditation.
And we see that David himself, though wonderfully employed in war and peace;
the government of a whole Kingdom, and the care of his own family, did yet
much exercise himself in this religious duty. Yet say (which we ought not to
do) that our worldly business must have the precedence; if we would not have
it appear to be a false, frivolous and carnal pretense, devised of purpose to
hide our utter neglect and contempt of religious duties; let us at least allot
unto them some of that time which we can spare from our worldly and necessary
employments, and set our selves about this exercise when our business is over.
Or suppose they will take up the whole day, let us allot to this use some small
part of the night, and make bold to borrow some little time from our sleep,
that we may not by the utter neglect of this duty sleep in sin, and so much
intend the refreshing of our bodies, as that we suffer our souls to droope and
languish, by withholding from them their spiritual food, and the comfort of
their communion and secret conferences with God. For if wicked men are so
vigilant and diligent in plotting and performing evil toward others and
themselves, that they are content to allot the time of their rest, to labor in
these works of darkness, and as David says of them, devise mischief upon
their bed. Yea, if their minds be so intentive, Psalm. 36. 4.
and their hearts so wholly set upon it, that unless they have devised or
executed some mischievous design, their sleep departs from Prou. 4. 16.
them, as Solomon speaks: how much rather should we be willing to spare
some time from our sleep, that we may spend it in some such holy and heavenly
meditations, as may enrich us with spiritual grace, enable us to Gods service,
and help us forward in the way of salvation? Finally, suppose that we are so
wholly divided between business and sleep, that neither night nor day we can
find any time for this holy exercise; yet we have no color of excuse, if we
do not set apart some time upon the Lords Day, which may be spared from
public duties in the Congregation, and private with our families, to be spent
in meditations, seeing then in what state soever we be, whether bound or free,
Masters or servants, rich or poor, we cannot reasonably pretend any such
excuses of distraction by our worldly business, all which we are bound to set
apart, and to consecrate our selves wholly, our actions, words, and secret
thoughts to the service of God, and to use all good means which may enrich us
with grace and further our salvation; and this especially among the rest, for
though our case and state may be such, that we are necessarily restrained from
Gods public service in his holy assemblies, as we see in the example of David,
and of captives and prisoners, the sick, and seafaring men, and Psalm. 42. 1,
2. and 84. 1, 2, 3.
some servants; yet all men, and in all conditions, may on this day spend some
time in holy meditations, upon some things which they have observed out of Gods
Word, or works. As for that last pretense of wanting a fit and private place
for meditation, by reason that we are straitened in our dwellings, and have
always some with us in the same room, who would hinder us in this exercise;
it is of so small weight, that it is scarce worth the answering. For there is
no man that earnestly desires to perform this duty, who may not at one time
or other, find some convenient place for the doing of it. For if he have no
room in the house, he may with Isaac, walk abroad into the fields: or if
dwelling in the City he be debarred of this privilege, he may as David
exhorts, commune Psalm. 4. 4.
with his own heart upon his bed, and be still; of which his precept he
propounds himself for an example in diverse places of the Psalms, wherein,
as thinking the day too short, or too much taken up with other employments, he
professes that he spent also some part of the night in divine meditations. And
so much concerning the reasons which may move us to this exercise, and the
impediments which hinder us from undertaking and performing it.

CAP. XVII.
Of the circumstances of Meditation, as the place, time, and gesture of the
body.

. Sect. 1 Of the place of meditation.
IN the doctrine of meditation (which is the next point to be handled according
to that order which I before propounded) I will entreat, first of the
circumstances of this duty, and then of the substantial parts of it. The
circumstances are either the subject place, or the adjuncts, which either
respect the time of it, or the disposition and gesture of him that meditateth.
The place ought to be private, that being solitary and alone, we may be free
from outward distractions, which would hinder us in this exercise, and that
being wholly sequestered both in mind and body from all worldly impediments, we
may entirely and seriously deuote our selves to the service of God in the
performing of this duty. And thus Isaac when he would meditate, walked
solitarily in the field; our Savior retired himself sometime to the Desert,
sometime to the Mount of Olives. David meditated Psalm. 4. 4. Dan. 8. 2. Act. 10.
upon his bed, Daniel in his chamber, and by the river of Vlai, Peter upon the
house top. So that there is no place limited to this exercise, seeing God is
present every where, and will be found in all places alike, if we seek him
with devout and holy hearts. And therefore it is not much material whether we
meditate either upon our bed in the morning, evening, or in the night watches,
or in our secret closets, or in the fields, and in our retired walks. Only
these two things are to be observed in our choice of the place; first, that it
be free from company and noise; for our meditation must be a soliloquie with
God and our own souls; and secondly, this private place must be such, as in
our experience we find freest from distraction, and fittest to further us in
our devotion. In which regard (as I take it) those places are most convenient,
wherein there are fewest objects to draw away the senses with unusual delights,
seeing they are ready to carry to the imagination, what they observe with
pleasure, and that being distracted, withdraws also the mind and heart from
this exercise. And consequently our closet and chamber, or our ordinary and
usual walk abroad, where nothing is to be observed but that which is common
and often seen, are to be preferred before such places, wherein there is
variety of new and pleasing objects, and one ordinary place better then diverse
and many, because we can there soonest, and with most ease recollect our
thoughts, and being gathered, keep them together without distraction.

. Sect. 2 Of the time, that it must not be continual, but as we get fittest
opportunity.
Concerning the time of this set and solemn meditation, diverse things are to
be observed. First, it must not be perpetual and continual; for howsoever the
other kind of meditation, which is sudden, short and occasional, may be at
times performed when we have any opportunity; yet this serious and solemn kind
cannot be so, in regard of our weakness which cannot bear it and endure the
labor, and in respect of other duties which we are bound to perform as well
as this, both religious and civil, and must be all done in their due and
seasonable time. In which regard it is to be esteemed so far off from a state
of Angelical perfection, which is wholly taken up with contemplation, that it
cannot be excused nor wiped from the blemish of deserved blame, because many
other duties as necessary in their due time and place, are utterly omitted and
neglected. Besides, the object of this exercise being spiritual, divine and
supernatural, is far too excellent for the weak sight of our minds to be
always gazing on, or if it should, it would soon be dazeled and dulled, yea
distracted and quite lost; like the bodily eyes with beholding the Sun in his
full brightness. Yea, as this exercise must not be continual, so neither
should it be ouer-common: the which as it causes weariness and satiety, they
lothing, and this remissness and slack performance, which fails as much in
the manner, zeal and devotion, as it exceeds in time and number; so does it
by assiduity lose in our judgment that esteem, and in our hearts that awful
reverence, and feruor of affection which is due unto it; and so becomes cold
and formal, heartlesse, and vselesse; like physic, which being ordinarily
taken, becomes familiar to nature, and so works not any extraordinary
effect. Neither can the most men be often exercised in this duty in a set and
solemn manner, unless they cause other necessary duties of Christianity, and
of their callings, to give way unto it with great loss and inconvenience. In
which respect, great difference is to be made between the rich and wealthy who
have much spare time, and poor men who live by their daily labor, and have
little time to spare for the performance of many religious duties no less
necessary. And amongst those who have worldly necessaries without bodily toil;
me thinks there should be some difference in the frequency of this exercise,
between ordinary Christians, and us of the Ministry, and that we should more
often apply our selves unto it, then any other sort of men, both because
spiritual and heavenly things are the chief objects about which our minds
should be exercised; and because these holy meditations do more directly and
immediately fit us for the duties of our callings, then they do other men in
theirs. In which regard it were to be wished, that we would let few or no
days pass, without some time spent in this holy duty, which will make us much
more profitable both to our selves and others. The which I speak, not to
spur on any to outrunne his devotion, which being left behind, will make this
exercise cold, formal, and not worth the while, and much less to bridle and
restrain the zeal of other men, who have will, and time to perform daily
this holy duty, but only because I would not ensnare weak consciences with
doubts and difficulties, by laying upon them this task as a necessary burden,
which the Lord has left free and at their devotion.

. Sect. 3 Of the fittest time for meditation.
The second thing required in respect of the time, is, that it be not left at
random and at large, without any certain limits bounding it to one part of
the day more then another, but then doing it, when we are best at leisure, or
when some good mood or pang of devotion drives us to it; for then we shall
never be constant in this exercise, but shift it off from one time to another,
at the first, rarely performing it, and at the last, neglecting it altogether.
But when with good advice we have made choice of that time of the day which is
fittest, both in respect of our abilities and occasions; it is our best way
(not for conscience but conueniency) to keep us strictly to it, if some
important cause and unexpected and weighty business do not press upon us and
change our course; observing constantly (as near as we can) the same days of
the week, and the same hour of the day, for the ordinary performing of this
exercise. For as order in all good duties is a cause of constancy, so an
orderly constancy, or constant order is a notable means of continuance and
perseverance: whereas if we intermit them and do them only by fits, our
false and deceitful hearts, under pretense of putting them off to a more
convenient time, will make us at last wholly to omit them. For if we be unfit
to day, we shall be more unfit to morrow; and indisposition, if we yield
unto it without resistance, not laboring with our hearts to bring them into
better frame, and to recover the heat of our cooled devotion, will quickly
bring us to a loathing auersenesse and utter neglect. But though it be
concluded that some certain days and hours must be wisely chosen, and
constantly devoted to this exercise, yet what special time this should be, as
what days of the week, or what hour in the day, should be set apart for it,
is not so easily determined; only the Lords Day so challenges this duty as
most proper unto it, that it cannot then be neglected in some kind or other,
without sin. For the choice of other days, and set hours in them, it must
be left to Christian prudence, aided by every man's own experience, which will
teach us what time we can best spare from our other weighty and ordinary
employments, and when we are best disposed and fitted for the devout
performance of this religious duty, yet (saving other men's better judgment)
ordinarily, and for the most part, the first hour of the morning (as I
suppose) is fittest for it: first, because generally the morning is fittest for
all studies and exercises of the mind, when the decayed strength is repaired,
and the spent spirits refreshed and renewed by our rest, and all the faculties
of our souls more strong and vigorous. Secondly, because if by our weighty
employments, we are scanted of time in the rest of the day, we may, to
perform so good a duty, borrow an hour from our ordinary time of sleep,
without any hinderance to our other business. Thirdly, because having not as
yet intermeddled with worldly affairs, we may perform it with less
distraction. And lastly, because meditation is a good preparatiue to our
morning sacrifice of prayer. Yet if any man, upon other reasons, or his own
experience teaching him that he is best fitted, both in respect of his
devotion, and other occasions, do choose rather to meditate in the evening, I
leave it as a thing indifferent to his free choice: only I would aduize, that
we make choice of such a time, wherein we are fresh and vigorous in our
spirits and minds, and not when they, or our bodies are spent and wearied,
either with bodily labor, or studies of the mind.

. Sect. 4 Constancy in this exercise.
The third thing respecting the time is, that as we must be constant in setting
apart, and observing of some certain time of the day for the undertaking and
beginning of this exercise; so much more in continuing our meditations the time
appointed. Neither must it be performed by fits and snatches, intermingling
with them our worldly thoughts, or other business, sometime intermitting, and
then again afresh setting upon them: For when the mind is thus distracted
between things so opposite in nature, the one is an hindrance to the other,
and like the dog that runs or hunteth after two Hares at once, it catches
neither. Besides, when our mind is let loose to wander after earthly things,
it is not easily again composed and reduced into order; but we shall stand in
need of a new preparation; and so be still beginning, and never bring any thing
to perfection. And therefore when we have begun this exercise, we must
constantly proceed (as near as we can) without distraction or intermission,
for that whole space of time which we have allotted unto it; not breaking off
our meditation, until we have brought it to some issue, and received by it
some spiritual refection. Now what proportion of time is to be allotted to
this exercise, we cannot prescribe any certain stint or limits, but must leave
it to be measured out unto every one by his own devotion, which is not a like
in all, nor in the same man at all times. Besides, there is great difference
between one and another man's leisure in respect of variety of important
occasions, pressing some, more then others, and every man more or less, at
sundry times. Neither are we always a like fitted, but sometimes are more
dull and dead to spiritual exercises, and sooner weary of them; sometimes more
cheerful and heauenly-minded, and able to hold out in this spiritual race
without breathing or intermission; at one time sooner prepared, and better able
to perform, and at another, longer in working our backward hearts to this
duty. Only this in general may be said, that our outward exercise must not in
time exceed our inward abilities, nor the burden which we impose, our
spiritual strength: Both because the Lord is only delighted with cheerful
service, and cannot brook that which is dead and forced; and also because if
we ouer-weary our selves, it will cool and quench, and not inflame and
increase our devotion, and make us the more loath to come the next time to take
our spiritual repast, when as we did not leave with an appetite, but departed
away glutted with lothing satiety.

. Sect. 5 Of the disposition and gesture of the body.
The last circumstance to be observed is, the disposition and gesture of the
body, which do not a little further the devotion of the soul. In which there
is required, first, that the body be composed to rest and quiet, that it do
not by much agitation and violent motion disturb and distract the mind, nor by
spending the spirits, and wearying of the outward parts, make the exercise
tedious and toylesome. Secondly, here is required silence, that the mind may
more freely discourse with it self, without any interruption of outward noise;
unless it be in case that the heart be surcharged with the heat and vehemence
of our passions, and fervor of devotion, and do need some vent to give it
ease. As for the gesture of the body, no certain rules can be given; but it
must be left to be ordered and disposed by Christian prudence and experience.
Only in general we may observe these things: First, that our gesture and
carriage of our bodies be reverent, in respect of that glorious presence before
which we present our souls and bodies, and the waightinesse of the duty about
which we are employed, seeing this may somewhat further the inward reverence of
the heart. Secondly, that we use that gesture which in our experience we find
most available to stir up our devotion; for these outward gestures of the
body, are but the handmaids of the mind and heart; which must give their
attendance, that they may be ready to yield unto them that seasonable service,
which they shall appoint as most fit and profitable. To which purpose, diverse
gestures are diversely commended. Some in their Meditations prefer quiet
resting of their bodies upon their bed or pallet, whereby they find their minds
and souls best fitted for spiritual motion and discourse, and most free from
the distraction of all outward objects. Some sitting and inclining their bodies
to one side, their table or cheer supporting their elbow, and their hand their
head. Some standing still, with their eyes lifted up toward heaven, the Haven
of their hopes, and visible place of Gods invisible presence, but yet closed to
avoid distractions. Some walking, which being a healthful exercise, refreshes
the body, and makes it a more fit instrument of the soul, to perform this
duty without weariness. But which of these we use, it is not much material,
seeing in themselves one is not better then another, though in respect of us,
they may be more or less convenient, in regard of the variety of several men's
dispositions. Thirdly and lastly, it is not unprofitable to frame the gesture
of the several parts, according to the matter in hand, upon which we meditate,
and our inward affection in thinking of it. As when we are humbled in the
sight and sense of our sins, and are ashamed and grieved, because we have by
them dishonored and displeased our gracious God and loving Father, we may with
the Publicane cast down our eyes upon the earth, as not worthy to look up
unto heaven; and smite our breast, as lamenting the corruptions that are therein
contained. When we offer unto God the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving,
humble hearts, and holy desires, and beg in the name of Christ with confidence,
the benefits which he has commanded us to ask, and has promised to give, we
may lift up together with our hearts, our eyes and hands toward heaven, from
whence we expect to receive the things we ask, with the hand of faith. When
our hearts are ravished with the apprehension of Gods gracious promises, and
the sweet and delightful feelings of his love, and assured hopes of those
inestimable joys which he reserueth for us in heaven, we may hold up our Luke
21. 28.
heads with comfort and rejoicing, as our Savior speaks, eleuate our hearts
toward that place, whither our bodies and souls shall one day triumphantly
ascend, and with Abraham, testify unto our own souls, and Genesis 17. 17.
God, the Author of them, these rauishing comforts, with secret smiles, and
outward cheerfulness of our face and countenance; seeing these inward
feelings of Gods love, are better then wine, to glad the heart, and this
unction of the Spirit with these divine consolations, do make the countenance
Cant. 1. 1.
more cheerful then the choysest oil. Psalm. 104. 15.


CAP. XVIII.
Of our entrance into Meditation by due preparation.

. Sect. 1 That this preparation is necessary* and wherein it consists.
ANd so I come from the circumstances, to entreat of the exercise it self: In
which I will consider, first, the ingresse and entrance into it; then the
progress, and manner of proceeding in it; and finally, the egresse and
conclusion of it. The ingresse or entrance, consists in a due preparation,
which the gloriousness and Majesty of Gods presence, before whom this action
is to be performed, the important weight of the duty to be done, the profit
and necessity of doing it well, and our own frailty and imbecility, wants and
weakness, auersenesse and great indisposition to this high and holy exercise,
do necessarily require. For if we dare not, without due preparation, approach
into the presence of an earthly king, to deal with him about such weighty
business, as imports us no less then our whole estates, yea our lives
themselves; how much less should we presume to come into the presence of the
Sovereign Monarch of heaven and earth, about such important affairs as
concern our spiritual estates, and the everlasting salvation of our souls,
unless beforehand we be duly prepared? And if we cannot hope to make any
good music, unless we first string our Instruments, and put them in good
tune: so neither shall we ever be able to make any harmonious melody in Gods
hearing, unless we duly prepare all our powers and parts, and put our minds
and hearts, our wills and affections in good tune, and provide spiritual Songs
and divine Ditties, as the subject matter of our Music, about which we are to
exercise our Art and skill. In which two points our preparation chiefly
consists; For either it is taken up, in preparing and fitting our persons for
this exercise; or in provision of profitable matter, as the subject of our
Meditation. In the former respect, besides that general preparation before
spoken of, by renewing of our repentance, that we may not come polluted with
our sins into so holy a presence, nor touch such pure things with unwashed
hands, we are with all care and diligence to prepare all and every of our
special faculties and parts both of soul and body. And first, we must come
with prepared minds and understandings, both in respect of their illumination
and intention. For before we can meditate aright, our minds must be
enlightened by Gods Word and holy Spirit, that we may understand in some
measure the matter on which we are to meditate, with the causes, effects,
properties, and circumstances of it, without which we cannot at all perform
it. Neither must this knowledge be only in speculation and theorie, but also
a fruitful saving knowledge, which sanctifies the heart, and works it and
all other parts to an holy practice, without which, this exercise cannot be
done profitably, and as it ought. In the intention of our minds we must not
chiefly and principally propound unto our selves our own profit and benefit,
but perform it in obedience to God, as a duty which he requires, and whereby
we are made more fit to do him service; aiming therein chiefly at the setting
forth of his glory. And then as subordinate heereunto, we may, and ought to
aim at the enriching of our souls with all spiritual graces, the cheering
and comforting of our hearts with divine consolations, the increase of our
holiness, and the strengthening of us unto all Christian duties of a godly
life.

. Sect. 2 That we must chiefly prepare our hearts and affections.
Secondly, before we undertake this holy exercise, we must prepare our hearts
and affections, by laying aside all worldly cares and earthly desires, which if
they be retained, will interrupt and distract us in our spiritual
Meditations. And as Moses was to put off his shoes before he could be admitted
to hear God speaking unto him, or so much as to stand upon that ground, which
was sanctified by Gods presence; so must we cast off the worldliness of our
wills and desires, before there can be any profitable conference between him
and us. For there is such dissimilitude, yea contrariety between God and the
world, spiritual and earthly things, that when we turn us to speak unto the
one, we turn away from the other; and when our minds and hearts are fixed
upon the cares of this life and transitory trifles, by reason of the great
distance between them, they are quite divided and distracted from those which
are heavenly and spiritual: so that it is more possible to mix together gold
and clay, oil and water, then the gold of divine Meditations, and the oil of
spiritual thoughts, with the clay of our earthly affairs, and water of
worldly vanities. The fountain of our hearts must be clear and well settled,
the mud of earthly cares being sunk to the bottom, if we would behold in
them any divine Contemplations; for if they be stirred and troubled, nothing
will appear through this muddy thickenesse. And as before we can see the
brightness of the Sun, the clouds must be dispelled; so before our minds and
hearts can be illuminated and cheered with any heavenly light, or the beams of
Gods love in our spiritual Meditations, the foggie vapors and mists which
rise from the earth and sea of the world, must first be blown away and
scattered. Never (says one) can heavenly contemplation join with earthly
commotion: never is the troubled mind possibly Nunquam commotioni contemplatio
iungitur, nec praeualet men's perturbata conspicere, ad quod vix tranquilla
valet inhiare. Gregor. Moral. lib. 5.
able to behold those divine things, which without much difficulty it cannot
see when it is most quiet. And therefore if we will meditate with any fruit
and profit, we must not be more careful to sequester our selves outwardly
from company, then our hearts inwardly from worldly cares; nor (according to
our Saviors counsel) to shut our Closet doors, then to shut the door of our
hearts against earthly distractions, and to keep a narrow watch over them,
that none may enter at unawares and distract us in this holy exercise. Neither
must we only take care to exclude at this time such wicked thoughts, and such
carking and carnal cares, as are always unlawful, but even those which are
at other times honest and necessary, about our ordinary employments and duties
of our callings; yea, those likewise which are religious and spiritual, if
they be unseasonable, and nothing pertinent to the present purpose, nor any way
suitable to the matter we have in hand; seeing, though in respect of their
matter, they be good and holy, yet they are cunningly thrust into our hearts
and minds by the tempter, who can transform himself into an Angel of light,
in an ill manner, unseasonably and unprofitably, and to a worse end, namely, to
distract our present Meditations, and that by thinking on two things at once of
a diverse nature, we should receive benefit by neither, nor brings our thoughts
unto any good issue. In which regard, we are not utterly to banish such things
out of our hearts, but only to shut them out for the time, and to let them
stand at the door, like suitors, till we have dispatched with those, unto whom
for the present we have given hearing, lest rushing in uncalled, and speaking
altogether after a tumultuous manner, nothing be dispatched through this
disorder, whereas by seasonable admittance in due course, and conferring with
one after another, all may be brought to good effect. Secondly, as we must
cleanse our hearts from these encumbrances, so we must deck and adorn them
with the ornaments of virtue, that they may be fit to entertain so high and
holy a Ghest; but especially we must deck them with humility, in which he so
chiefly delights, that he will not only be content to confer with us for a
little while, but will Esa. 57. 15.
even dwell and keep residence with us if we be of an humble spirit. And
therefore when we approach into Gods presence to perform this duty, let us
think and consider of his glorious greatness, and awful Majesty, and of our
own baseness and vileness, weakness and unworthiness, saying in our
souls with Abraham, Behold, I have taken upon me to speak Genesis 18. 27.
unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes. O let not the Lord be angry, and I
will speak. And without this humility we cannot profitably perform this duty;
for as one says; None can contemplate the wisdom of God, who Contemplari Dei
sapientiam non possunt, qui sibi videntur esse sapientes, etc. Greg. in Moral.
lib. 18.
are wise in their own conceits; because they are by so much distant from his
light, by how much they come short of humility in themselves. For whilst the
swelling of pride increases in their minds, it closes the sight of
contemplation, and thinking themselves enlightened above all others, they are
deprived of the light of virtue. Finally, we must prepare our hearts for
Meditation, by sharpening our appetites, and whetting our stomachs after this
spiritual repast and food of our souls, by considering seriously of those
arguments, by which formerly it has been commended unto us. For as it is a
singular help to our bodily nourishment, when we come to our meat with an
hungry appetite, and that food does us but little good which we feed upon with
lothing satiety: so also is it in the nourishment of our souls; for if we
receive our food with a good stomach, we shall the better feed upon it,
retain and digest it; whereas, if we come unto it with a cloyed appetite, we
shall soon cast it up again, and never digest nor convert it to any
spiritual nourishment. Lastly, there is some preparation also required in
respect of our bodies; for as we must take heed that they be not too much
pampered with excessive diet, seeing this fullness and fatness of body,
causes emptiness and leanenesse in the soul, dulleth the mind, drowneth the
spirits, and oppresses the heart; so must we on the other side beware, that
the body and mind be not wearied, and the spirits spent with former studies
and labors, so as they are wholly disabled, that they cannot, as fit
instruments, perform any good service to the soul in this spiritual
exercise, as being rather disposed to rest and sleep, then to take any
profitable pains in this laborious employment.

. Sect. 3 Of the subject matter of our Meditations.
And thus having prepared our persons; the next thing to be done, is to
provide fit matter whereupon we may meditate, without which, our Meditations
are always unprofitable, and oftentimes hurtful and pernicious. In which
respect, the greatest part of men do pitifully fail; for though all are
willing to meditate, the mind delighting in its own motion, and in discoursing
upon those subjects which it most esteems, and upon which the heart is wholly
fixed; yet few make choice of such matter, as may be fit for their souls
nourishment; but some meditate mischief in their hearts, thinking upon the
readiest means, how they may atchieue it with least danger; some how they may
satisfy their carnal desires with worldly riches, pleasures and preferments,
and raise themselves by other men's ruins; some meditate upon natural things
with natural minds, never drawing them to spiritual use; some on domestical
matters, how they may best contriue their business; or on civil affairs, and
high points of state; yea, many men spend a great part of their Meditations,
about matters merely concerning other men, and nothing at all appertaining
unto them. Upon which, and a thousand such like subjects, we may spend our
spirits, wear out our bodies, and weary our minds, and yet be never the
holier in this life, nor happier in the life to come. But the matter of these
Christian Meditations whereof we entreat, ought to be wholly spiritual and
divine, either in respect of the things themselves, or at least, the use which
we are to make of them. And thus the whole Scriptures, and every part and
parcel of them may be the subject matter of our Meditations, when we
seriously consider of the right and natural sense and meaning of them, and
draw them unto use, either for instruction, admonition, reproof, consolation,
or the reformation and amendment of our sinful lives. In which kind of
Meditations, whosoever exercise themselves, they are by the Psalmist pronounced
blessed. But besides the text of holy Scriptures, Psalm. 1. 1, 2.
any point of the doctrine of divinity contained in them, may be fit matter for
us to meditate on; of which, I will here set down some of the chief and
principal, that those who are weak in knowledge, and young beginners in this
exercise, may be so sufficiently furnished, that they need not to neglect it
for want of matter.

. Sect. 4 That the Scriptures them selves, and the things revealed in them, are
fit matter for Meditation: As the nature of God, his actions and decree.
And that we may proceed in some order, we may make the matter of our
Meditations, either the Scriptures themselves, or else the things revealed in
them. The Scriptures themselves are a fit subject for our Meditation, by
considering that they are the Word, not of man, but of God, and so to be heard
and read, loved and obeyed of us; that in this regard they are most excellent,
and to be preferred above all other writings, most certain and infallible,
most perfect and all-sufficient, most ancient and durable, and finally, that
they are plain and easy, giving light to the simple, most profitable and
necessary to salvation, and therefore to be read and studied of all men. The
things revealed in the Scriptures, are either those which respect faith, and
are to be believed, or else manners, and are to be practiced. The things to be
believed, are either those which concern God or the Church. The former respect
God himself, or his actions and works. From God himself we may have
plentiful matter of divine Meditation, as first, that there is a God, and the
uses that we are to make of it; what this God is, and how he has revealed
himself unto us in his essence and persons, his attributes and names. Of which
I have spoken in the beginning of this Treatise, and have briefly described
Gods nature and attributes, as his simplicity, infiniteness, eternity,
immutability, omni-presence, all sufficiency, which being rightly understood
and remembered, will afford excellent matter of holy Meditations. The actions
of God, are either his decree, or the execution of it. In the decree it self,
we are principally to meditate upon our election to salvation, the causes, and
effects and properties of it, especially the infallibility and certainty; and
how, and by what reasons and signs, being sure in it self, we may come to be
assured, that our names particularly are written in the Book of life. In the
execution of the decree, which is either general or special, we have
plentiful matter of Meditation. In respect of the general execution, we may
meditate first of the works of creation, which were not made all at one
instant, as they might as easily, if God had so pleased; but in six days;
that by this orderly proceeding, we might the better be enabled to meditate
upon them. And here we may meditate on the heavens, their glory and beauty,
their greatness and durablenesse, their motions and constant order: How they
are adorned with the glorious brightness of the Stars, Moon, and Sun,
be-spangling this vaulty roof of Gods great building, every one exceeding
another in beauty and bravery. Thus we may meditate upon the diverse regions of
the air, and the creatures contained in them, the presaging Commets and fiery
exhalations, the Meteors of the middle region, clouds and winds, thunder and
lightning, rain, snow, hail, and frosts, whose hidden treasures and true
causes none can pry into, but he that made them; the disagreeing elements
joining in an excellent harmony, for the perfecting of all compound bodies.
Neither does the earth, and creatures therein contained, afford unto us less
matter of Meditation, as trees, plants, and flowers of excellent beauty, and
almost infinite variety, growing from silly seeds in outward show, not
differing (many of them) one from another. The excellent workmanship of the
brute creatures, the endless variety of their inward forms and outward
shapes, their qualities and properties, their life, sense, and motions, with
the exquisite organs and instruments, every small particle having for these
purposes their special and necessary use. Their generation, whereby being
corruptible in themselves, they become, after a sort, incorruptible in their
kinds, after their death living in their posterity. Secondly, we may meditate
upon the providence of God, whereby he preserves all things which he has
created, governing and directing them to those ends for which he has made
them, especially that main end of setting forth his glory. And that he does
thus rule and dispose, not only in a general manner, of all things, but of
every particular, even such as seem to be of least moment, and most casual
and contingent.

. Sect. 5 Of the execution of the Decree in the creation and government.
Again, the particular execution of Gods decree, in the creation and
government of Angels and men, affords unto us plentiful matter of
Meditation. As the felicity and glory of the blessed Spirits, the Image of God
in them; their alacrity and cheerfulness; their speed and diligence in doing
Gods will, and in ministering unto the elect for their preservation, and the
furthering of their salvation. The fall and misery of the evil angels, their
malice toward God and his elect, and their policy and power in seeking their
destruction, by drawing them to sin, which should double our diligence in
arming our selves against all their tentations. So also we may have abundant
matter of meditation ministered unto us from that which is revealed in the
Scriptures concerning man. As his Creation, whereby God made man's body of the
dust of the earth; the Image of God in man consisting in wisdom,
righteousness, and true holiness; his felicity in the state of innocence, the
immortality and excellency of his soul, the beauty, health and vigor of his
body, his dominion over the creatures, the joys of Paradise. Likewise in our
meditations we may consider, that man continued not in this blessed estate, but
fell from it; and that the cause hereof was sin. Where we take occasion
generally to meditate of sin, what it is, how horrible, grievous, and
contrary to Gods pure nature, and how much in this regard he hates and
detesteth it: the fearful properties of it, both in respect of the guilt and
punishment; temporal, as all the calamities and miseries of this life, and our
spiritual servitude to Satan; and eternal, as the loss of heavenly
happiness, and everlasting condemnation both of body and soul. More
especially, we may meditate on the fall of our first Parents, what it was, and
wherein it consisted, the causes of it outward and inward, and the lamentable
effects which followed upon it. As Gods fearful curse upon themselves, and
upon the creatures for their sake, the defacing of his glorious Image in them,
the sense of their nakedness, and terror of conscience accompanying it, the
loss of their dominion over the creatures, their thrusting out of Paradise,
the visible place of Gods presence, their separation from him, and all other
evils both of sin and punishment. The wretchedness of all mankind in the
state of disobedience and unbelief, by reason of that corruption which
followed the fall; as the participation of Adams sin, guilt and punishment.
The propagation of their sin and misery to all their posterity. Their
original sin and corruption of nature, both in respect of their souls and
bodies. The ignorance and vanity of our minds, the error of our judgments,
the wickedness and worldliness of all our imaginations; the impurity,
stupidity and horror of our consciences; the loss of our freedom of will in
choosing that which is good; their auersenesse and rebellion against the will of
God, and pronenesse to all evil; the blockishnesse of our memories to receive
into their keeping any good motions, and their slippery feebleness to retain
them; the infidelity, security and hardness of our hearts; the corruption and
disorder of our affections and passions; the pollution of our bodies, their
feebleness and lumpish heaviness unto any good action. From which root of
original corruption have sprung all kinds of actual transgressions, we being
made thereby utterly unable so much as to think a good thought, or to will
that which is good. Whereof it comes to pass, that our best actions in this
state of corruption and unbelief, are no better then sin, how glorious
soever they seem to the world. And here we may meditate of the several
kinds of actual sins; those that are internal, as wicked thoughts, errors
in judgment, forgetfulness in our memories, unclean and carnal lusts: and
those which are external, secret or manifest, reigning or not reigning, of
omission or commission, in our words or deeds, which we have committed as
principals or accessaries. Sins of ignorance, or of knowledge, of infirmity
and frailty, or of contumacy and rebellion, which we have wilfully and
presumptuously committed against God. The like matter of meditation the
punishment of our sins does minister unto us: As namely, that by our sins
we have made our selves subject to the fearful wrath of God, the curse of the
Law, all the plagues and punishments of this life: As all external miseries
which are innumerable; respecting our estate, as poverty, penury, losses and
crosses; or our bodies, as heat, cold, hunger, thirst, sicknesses and diseases,
shortness and uncertainty of life and death it self. So also the internal
miseries of the soul, as terrors of conscience, and griefs of mind; or
contrariwise, to be given up of God to our security and hardness of heart,
infidelity, final impenitency and to a reprobate mind. And finally, the
eternal and everlasting punishments of body and soul in their separation from
God, and the unspeakable torments of hell fire. And finally, we may meditate of
the remedilesnesse of this our miserable condition, in respect of any created
help of men. Angels, or any creature, as the top and consummation of all our
misery, seeing the infinite Justice of God being offended by our sins, would
not admit of any finite satisfaction. The which kind of meditations upon sin
and punishment, serve not only to humble us before God, by bringing us unto a
true sense of our sin and misery, to make us to deny our selves in the work
of our Redemption, and to fly unto Christ, but also cause us to admire and
praise Gods mercy and goodness, patience and long-suffering, who has so long
borne with us in the state of infidelity, and has not inflicted upon us all
these fearful punishments which our sins have deserved; yea, to inflame our
hearts with most fervent love toward God, and his Christ, and holy Spirit, who
seeing us in this wretched plight, loaded and defiled with the filth of sin,
and guilty and liable to all punishments and miseries, did pity us in this
miserable estate, and when there was no other means of salvation and
deliverance from all these evils, wrought our freedom and redemption by the
death and obedience of the Lord of life.

. Sect. 6 Of the great work of Redemption by our Savior Christ.
The which great work of our Redemption by Christ, does above all other parts
of Divinity, minister unto us most plentiful and fit matter for our
meditations, as serving notably to work in our hearts a true hatred of sin,
to inflame them with Gods love, to work them to his fear, to kindle in them
the zeal of his glory, to confirm our faith, strengthen our affiance and
hope, renew our repentance, and to stir us up to perform with all
cheerfulness the duties of a godly life, that by walking before him in
holiness and righteousness, we may glorify him who has redeemed and made us
his own at so high a price. Now the points which here afford unto us matter
of meditation, are manifold. As first, that it was necessary we should have a
Savior and Mediator between God and us; seeing in his Decree of Election he
has ordained the means, as well as the end, and that none but Christ could
save us, who is the foundation of our Election. In Christ we may meditate both
upon his person and offices. And in his person, consider both his natures and
states, both of humiliation and exaltation. Here we have plentiful and
profitable matter of meditation concerning the Incarnation of Christ, his
Conception by the holy Ghost in the womb of the blessed Virgin, the framing
and sanctifying of his humane nature, the assuming and uniting of it to the
Divine nature, by a substantial union, without confusion, separation, or
alteration of either nature in their properties. His Birth and Circumcision;
and that this Christ, borne of the Virgin Mary, is the true Messiah. So
likewise we may meditate on his Office of Mediatorship; as that he is the alone
Mediator between God and man. How he was called to his office, and the
testimonies of it; of his Baptism, fasting in the Wilderness, and Divine
unction with the Spirit above measure. Of the eternity of his Office, and parts
of it, being anointed of God to be our Prophet, Priest, and King. Of his
Prophetical Office, whereby he has both outwardly revealed unto us the
knowledge of God and his will, and inwardly inlighteneth our minds to conceive
it, by his grace and holy Spirit; and of the confirmation of this doctrine by
miracles. Of his Priestly Office, and of his All-sufficient satisfaction for
our sins. Of his perfect obedience, both active, whereby he has fulfilled
the Law for us; and passive, whereby he has suffered all those punishments
which were due unto us for our sins. And this yields unto us most excellent
and profitable matter of meditation in all the parts thereof; as his tentations
in the Wilderness by the devil, the manifold miseries which he endured, as
poverty, hunger, weariness, contempt, disgraces, scoffs and bitter taunts,
reproaches, slanders, reuilings, and such like, which he suffered in the whole
course of his life; and those his passions and sufferings a little before his
death; as his internal and bitter agony in the Garden, where his wrestling
with Gods wrath, and the burden of his Fathers heavy displeasure for our
sins, which he had taken upon him, forced out of his most blessed Body a
bloody sweat. And his external sufferings, as his betraying by his own
Apostle, his apprehension by his cruel enemies, who haled him before the
Judgment seat as a malefactor, who was the Lord our righteousness; falsely
accused him, who had committed no sin, and in whose mouth there was no guile,
unjustly condemned him, who was just and innocent, mocked and scorned him,
blindfolded and buffeted him, reviled and spit upon him, clothed him with
purple, and crowned him with thorns, whipped and tormented him, crucified and
killed him. And here we may meditate of this kind of death, which was most
bitter and painful, ignominious and shameful, accursed and uncomfortable,
seeing he suffered not only a bodily death, but the wrath of God, which is the
death of the soul, and was utterly emptyed (as the Apostle speaks) Phil. 2.
8.
of all divine comfort, and was as a man forlorn and forsaken of God in his
own sense and apprehension, which made him to cry out upon the Cross, My God,
my God, why have thou forsaken me? Thus also we have matter of meditation from
those things which followed his death; as from his triumph upon the Cross over
the wrath of God, the curse of the Law, Satan, death, hell, and all the enemies
of our salvation, in respect of the virtue of his merits. From his descension
and burial, whereby he was held for a time under the arrest of death. From
those things likewise which were done by him in his state of exaltation; as his
Resurrection, mansion upon the earth for the space of forty days, teaching and
instructing his Disciples in those things which appertained to his Kingdom.
His Ascension, sitting at the right hand of God, and there making intercession
for us. And that which follows of all these, as the general effect and fruit
of them all, the great work of our Redemption. So have we matter of meditation
from Christ's Kingly Office, by which, sitting at the right hand of his Father,
in all glory, majesty and power, he reigns over all the world, and more
peculiarly, over his Church. And here we may meditate upon the parts of his
Kingly Office, which are his special administration, and general and last
Judgment. In the former, we may consider the government of his Church, and
the abolition of the kingdom of darkness. In that we may meditate on his
calling and gathering of it out of the world, and the consecration of it being
gathered by his presence and protection, providing for it all necessaries, and
preserving it from all dangers: where we may take occasion to meditate upon all
Gods blessings and benefits, both temporal, spiritual and eternal, which he
has, and will bestow generally upon his whole Church, and also upon those
which he has particularly and in special manner vouchsafed unto us, both in
our preservation from evil, and fruition of good. The abolition of the
kingdom of darkness is the overthrow and destruction of all his enemies, and
especially that grand adversary, Antichrist, the whore of Babylon.

. Sect. 7 Of the external means of executing Gods Decree of Election.
Moreover, we may have plentiful matter of meditation, from the external
means of executing the Decree of our Election: As from the Covenant of grace
made with us in Christ, wherein the Lord has promised that he will be our God,
and we shall be his people, the remission of our sins and salvation of our
souls, grace and all good things in this life, and everlasting happiness in
the life to come, upon the alone condition of faith, which being lively and
effectual, brings forth the fruits of unfeigned repentance. So also from the
means whereby this Covenant is administered, namely, the ministry of the Word,
and administration of the Sacraments, Baptism, and the Lords Supper; both
which afford unto us plentiful matter of meditation. From the degrees
likewise of the executing Gods Decree of Election and Reprobation. As the love
and free grace of God in Christ: and the degrees of the declaration of this
love both in this life, and afterward. The first degree in this life is our
effectual calling, the parts whereof are, our election and separation from the
world, Gods donation, giving Christ unto us to be our Savior, and us to Christ
to be saved by him; and finally, our insition into Christ, and union with him.
From the means of executing this our calling, which is the saving hearing of
the Word, the softening of our hard hearts, making them humble, contrite,
penitent and sorrowful for sin, which are all preparatiues to our sound
conversion and regeneration, whereby we who were dead in sin, are quickened
and revived by the Spirit of God, effectually applying unto us the virtue of
Christ's death and Resurrection. From the work of grace thus begun in us, we
may have much profitable matter of meditation. As of the illumination of our
minds with saving knowledge, of justifying faith, with the causes, effects,
degrees, properties and signs of it, our justification by faith in Christ, our
reconciliation, and adoption; and manifold other privileges of the faithful,
of which I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. The special fruits of faith
respecting our Justification, as our entrance into grace by which we stand,
the love of God shed abroad in our hearts, confidence, free access to the
Throne of grace, peace of conscience, joy in the holy Ghost, and an holy
glorying in Gods benefits. The fruits of faith respecting our adoption, as the
Spirit of adoption, hope, Christian liberty. So also we have excellent matter
of meditation from our sanctification, the causes, effects, degrees,
properties, means and signs of it, and from the special parts of it, our
mortification unto sin, and vinification to newness of life. From the
imperfection of our sanctification, which is but begun in this life, and to be
perfected in the life to come, and that by reason hereof the relics of all
sorts of sin do still remain in us, blindness in our minds, error in our
judgments, impurity in our consciences, forgetfulness in our memories,
rebellion in our wills, security, impenitency, infidelity and hardness in our
hearts, corruption and disorder in our affections, and by reason of all these
many sins breaking out into our actions. And here we may meditate of those
special sins and corruptions whereunto our natures are most prone, and
wherewith we are most often overtaken; and of the means whereby we may
mortify and subdue them, that they may no longer bear this sway in us as in
former times. So also we have here occasion to meditate of our begun sanctity
in all our parts and actions: of the internal holiness of our natures, and
the change that is wrought in us by repentance from evil to good, from
corruption to grace, the which is to be observed in all our inward faculties;
as the holiness of our minds and understandings in their spiritual
illumination, whereby they become wise and prudent in the things appertaining
to God and our salvation; the purging of our consciences from dead works, and
their natural impurity; the sanctity of our memories, whereby they become
faithful Registers of good things; the freedom of our wills in choosing good,
and refusing of evil; the suppling, softening, and sanctifying of our hearts;
the rectifying, right ordering, purging and and renewing of our affections; as
love, hatred, confidence, hope, fear, despair, joy, sorrow, anger, zeal, and
the rest. The sanctity of our bodies and outward actions, appearing in our new
obedience and good works. The integrity, sincerity, alacrity and constancy of
them; the parts of this obedience, which are, the denying of our selves, and
the profession of Christ. How we are to deny our selves, namely, by resigning
up our selves wholly unto God, to be not only his servants, but also his
soldiers in the Christian warfare; where we may take occasion to meditate of
that due preparation which is required to this warfare, and of the Christian
armor, and of the conflict it self, consisting in the manifold tentations of
our spiritual enemies, and our resistance, and of our standing and falling in
it. How we are also to deny our selves in taking up our cross and following of
Christ, bearing with patience whatsoever afflictions he imposes; and of the
means whereby we may attain unto it. In respect of our profession of Christ,
we are to meditate how we are to carry our selves toward Christ himself, and
how toward his members. How we are to profess Christ at all times, by
invocation and calling upon God in his name and mediation. And here we have
much profitable matter of meditation concerning prayer, both in respect of the
doctrine and use of it, of which I have before spoken, and the particular
practice of it in the Lords Prayer, of which we may profitably meditate,
proceeding from one petition to another. The profession of Christ in time of
danger, which is either the profession of the mouth by Christian apology, or
of the fact, by suffering persecution and martyrdom, of which we may meditate,
and the means whereby we may be prepared and strengthened unto them. The
profession of Christ respecting his members, is our edifying them, by
instruction, admonition, exhortation, consolation and good example, or our
helping and relieuing them by the works of mercy and almes-deedes, whereon we
may profitably meditate, and of the motives and means whereby we may be
stirred up and enabled to perform them. And finally, our perseverance in
grace, and in all these Christian duties, even to the very end of our lives,
which is the consummation of all the rest, is necessary to be thought upon, our
certainty of it, and by what means we may come to this assurance. And thus
we must meditate on the degrees of Gods executing the Decree of our election
in this life. In respect of the life to come, he executes it by our
glorification, of which we may meditate, as it is begun or perfected. It is
begun at the death of the Elect, whereby their souls being separated from
their bodies, are received into the joys of heaven. The which our death is an
excellent subject of meditation; as of the nature of it to the elect, the
certainty of it, and uncertainty of the time, of our preparation to it, and
means whereby we may be armed against the fear of it.

. Sect. 8 Of the means of executing the Decree of reprobation.
Contrariwise, there is much matter of meditation afforded from the proper
means of Gods executing the Decree of reprobation in the wicked; as both from
the foundation of it, the fall of Adam, and the hatred and wrath of God
following upon it, and also from the degrees of executing this Decree in the
wicked and unfaithful, which are proper to those which are either called or
not called, or common to them both. The former are either hypocrites, or openly
profane. The degrees proper to these are an ineffectual calling, and their
relapse from it into their former wickedness. Here we may meditate of the
degrees of this calling, which are inward illumination of the mind in the
knowledge of the truth, worldly and carnal penitence, and sorrow arising from
terror and fear, or sense and feeling of punishment; temporary faith, taste
of heavenly gifts, and external reformation of life. Where we may consider
how far a reprobate may go in Christianity, and what real and substantial
differences we can observe between those shows of graces which are in them,
and the truth of them in our selves, that we may be the better assured of our
sincerity and uprightness before God. The degrees of relapse in those which
are thus vneffectually called, are, first, that they are deceived with sin, and
the fraud of their own deceitful hearts, from whence their hearts become
hardened, and from thence stubbornly perverse, and so through incredulity not
assenting to the truth of Gods Word, they break out to open profaneness,
which is in the end accompanied with despair and final Apostacy. Upon all
which we may meditate, that we may make our own calling and election sure,
by withstanding the first degrees of Apostacy, watching over our selves (as
the Apostle warns us) that we be not hardened and drawn away by the
deceitfulness of sin, that there be not found in us an evil heart of
unbelief, Heb. 3. 12, 13.
in departing from the living God. The degrees of executing this Decree in
those which are not called, who for the most part are ignorantly superstitious,
Idolaters, Pagans, and Atheists, are the holding and detayning of the truth in
injustice, natural ignorance and vanity of mind, hardness Romans 1. 20, 21, etc.
of heart, a reprobate mind, and committing of sin with greediness: And the
degrees common to both, are their pollution with all sin and wickedness in
their lives, and their entrance into condemnation at their death, when as their
souls being separated from their bodies, are cast in the torments of hell, and
pursued with the wrath of God. On all which we may meditate, that we may take
occasion to magnify Gods Justice toward them in their deserved punishments;
and his free grace and undeserved love toward us, who being in the same mass
and lump of corruption, are separated from them, and made vessels of honor,
that Gods grace and mercy might be magnified in our salvation.

. Sect. 9 Of the eternal execution of Gods Decree at the end of the world, etc.
Of the eternal execution of Gods Decree, we may likewise meditate, which
shall be at the end of the world, and is either general, respecting 2. Pet. 3.
11, 12, 13, 14.
the whole world, as the destruction of it with flaming fire, which
consideration the Apostle Peter makes a strong motive unto godliness; that we
may be found of God in peace, without spot, and blameless; and the renouation
and perpetual conservation of it; or else the special execution of it in the
inhabitants of the world, which shall be at the general Judgment, and the
eternal retribution which follows it. And here we may profitably meditate
on this Day of Judgment, when Christ shall come in glory, to judge both the
quick and the dead, and of the signs of his coming; of the resurrection of
the dead, and change of the living; of the citation of all before Christ's
Judgment seat; and of the diverse sentence which he shall pronounce for the
elect, and against the reprobate; and of the blessed estate of the one, and the
cursed and miserable condition of the other; of the eternal retribution which
shall then be of rewards to the faithful, in the full fruition of eternal
life and blessedness, heavenly joy and perfect glory; of all the parts whereof
I have spoken in another place; and of the retribution of punishment to the
wicked in hell torments, Christ. Warfare 2. part.
both in their souls and bodies. And these are the things whereupon we may
meditate, respecting the actions of God. Now concerning the things which we are
to believe concerning the Church, there is all profitable matter of Meditation.
As that there is a Church, called and gathered out of the rest of the world, as
Gods own peculiar people, to worship and serve him according to his will. That
there is in this company an holy Communion of Saints, united unto our Head
Christ, by his Spirit and a lively faith, and with one another, as members of
the same body, with the bond of faith and love. That this Church is Catholic,
part whereof is Militant on earth, and part of it Triumphant in heaven. That
the properties of the Militant Church are to be either invisible, which
consists only of the elect, or visible, consisting partly of them, and
partly of hypocrites; that there are certain infallible notes of the true
visible Church, by which we may discern it from all others, as the sound
preaching of the Word, and the right administration of the Sacraments, in all
the essential parts of them, according to Christ's holy institution; and
finally, that there are also infallible notes of the true members, both of this
and the invisible Church of Christ, on which we may profitably meditate, and
by examination apply particularly unto our selves, that we may know whether we
be or no in this number. And these are the things to be believed, which we may
choose for the matter of our Meditation. The things which are to be done, are
all contained in the Law of God or ten Commandments, upon which we may
meditate severally, and on all and every of the virtues and vices contained in
any of them, but especially on those virtues in which we are most defective,
and on those vices, unto which our corrupt natures are most inclined; as also
on the means and helps whereby we may be enabled to embrace and practice the
one, and shun and avoid the other; and on the signs, whereby we may upon
due examination know whether or no we be endued with those virtues, and purged
from those vices. Of all which, I have spoken in the former part of this
Treatise, unto which I refer the Reader; or if he desires a more full and
perfect discourse, unto that exact and learned abstract of the duties
commanded, and sins forbidden in the Law of God, written by my right reverend
and dear Brother, to whose labors I acknowledge my self most beholding for
all the former heads of divinity, which I have set down, as the matter about
which our Meditations may be profitably exercised.

. Sect. 10 Rules directing us in the choice of the fittest matter for our
Meditations.
And thus have I showed what great and abundant matter there is fit for our
Meditations; seeing any one of the former general heads or points being
thoroughly discoursed on in our minds, and wrought upon and applied to our
affections, according to that form which I shall afterward prescribe, is
sufficient for one days exercise; and many of them will afford plentiful
matter for much longer time. And therefore, lest any should now be as much
troubled with plenty, as they were before with want, not knowing what theme or
subject to choose out of such great variety, and therefore being thus distracted
in their thoughts, should let all alone; I will for the direction of such in
their choice, propound these rules following. First, that we ordinarily and
most often make choice of such matter, as we find to be most fit to stir up
our devotion, to strengthen our faith, to work upon our hearts and affections,
to inflame our love toward God, and kindle our zeal, to confirm our
affiance, increase our hope, fear of God, humility and patience, and finally,
to enable us with all cheerfulness to perform all the duties of a godly
life. To which purpose, we must rarely choose such matter as is merely
intellectual, and fit rather for speculation then for use and practice (though
in truth, there be few points of sound Divinity, and scarce any of those
before expressed, which being rightly handled in our Meditations, will not
afford some fit matter, as well for the sanctifying of our hearts and
affections, as for the inlightning of our minds, and increasing of our
knowledge) but such as has been matter of fact, and brought to the
understanding by the imagination, and to it by the ministry of the senses;
which will more easily and kindly afford matter of Meditation to the most
simple, fit to work upon their hearts, to inflame their love, stir up their
devotion, and enable them unto all Christian duties, the which are the main
ends of this exercise, and not the inlightning of the mind with curious
speculations and fruitless knowledge. In which regard, when we find the
matter on which we meditate, unfit for those uses, and relish in it little
sweetness of spiritual refreshing, or feel small warmth for the heating of
our hearts with love, zeal, and true devotion, we need not to insist upon it,
but may pass to some other point, which is more effectual to the atchieuing
of these ends. Secondly, we must make choice of such matter as in our
discretion we think, not only in it own nature most excellent, and generally
most profitable and necessary, but also such as is fittest for our persons and
present state, place, time, and other circumstances. For as those who are
invited to a great and bountiful feast, do not feed on every dish, nor
always on such as are most costly, and generally esteemed best, but (at least,
if they keep a good diet) make choice of one or two amongst the rest, which
they think fittest for their stomakes, and in respect of the present state of
their bodies, most likely to bring with delight to their taste, wholesome
nourishment for the preserving of their health and strength: so in that great
plenty of provision which I have made to entertain my ghests at this
spiritual feast, they must not run over many things at once, nor always
prefer in their choice, such points as in their own nature exceed others;
but pick out one, or some few which are most fit for their present state and
condition, and most likely to yield unto them the best nourishment for the
strengthening and preserving of their souls in their spiritual good liking,
and better inabling them to all good duties. Lastly, seeing our souls as well
as our bodies have their satiety, by feeding often or much at the same time
upon the same dish, therefore having such great plenty set before us, it shall
be our wisdom to take the benefit of this variety, not feeding over often
upon the same dish, which made the Israelites loath Manna it self, though a
heavenly food, nor too much of any thing at one time, which made their dainty
Quails, through satiety, to come out of their nostrils; but whetting on our
appetite by change of diet every meal; and even at the same time helping the
weakness of our stomakes with some little variety, when as we find them
glutted; let us, when we are weary of meditating ouer-long on one point, insist
no longer upon it, but pass unto another. Provided always, that we do not
herein give place to fickle inconstancy, nor liberty to our rouing hearts,
passing loosely from on^ thing to another, and not bringing any point to a good
issue.

. Sect. 11 That we must conclude our preparation unto Meditation with Prayer.
And thus having prepared both our persons and matter, the last thing required
in our preparation, is, that we conclude it, and make entrance Iam. 1. 17.
into our Meditation by effectual prayer, for Gods direction and blessing upon
our intended exercise. For seeing of our selves we are not able so much as to
think a good thought, but all our grace and goodness comes from God the
Father of lights, from whom every good and perfect gift descends; therefore
let us not fondly presume upon our own strength, as though we were able to
atchieue so weighty and difficult a business without his aid; but
acknowledging our own weakness and auersenesse to this holy duty, let us
crave the assistance of his holy Spirit, which only can enable us unto it.
Besides, Prayer and Meditation being of like nature, and fruits of the same
regenerating Spirit, are mutual helps one to another, Meditation preparing
matter for our Prayers, and bringing unto them feruencie of zeal and heat of
devotion, and Prayer returning again to our Meditations this borrowed seruour
and vigor, when ascending into heaven, it has fetched it from God. And as the
natural heat and moisture preserve one another, and both fail when one is
defective, the one perishing for want of heat, and the other for want of
nourishment: Or as there is between the stomach and heart, such intercourse,
as preserves them both in their well-being, the stomach preparing matter and
nourishment, for preserving in the heart the vital spirits; and the heart
returning these spirits again to the stomach, which give it natural heat
and warmth, whereby it is fitted and enabled to make good concoction; so is it
between Meditation and Prayer, which are mutual helpers one to another, and
neither of both retain long their virtue and vigor, if either of them do
fail the other. But this Prayer which is to prepare us for Meditation, is
rather to be pithy and fervent, then long and in many words, seeing it is not
the main duty which is here intended, but only a preparatiue making way unto
it, wherein acknowledging our own debility and insufficiency, we are to crave
the assistance of Gods holy Spirit, in some such form as this which follows.
O Lord, my God, who art infinitely good and gracious in thy self, and the
chief Author of whatsoever goodness there is in me, both as thou mouest me
thereunto by thy commandment, and enablest me unto it by thy holy Spirit, I
most humbly beseech thee to pardon my manifold and grievous sins, whereby I
have made my self unworthy to approach into thy glorious and holy presence,
and unable to perform any duty of thy service, and purge me thoroughly from
the guilt, punishment and corruption of them all, in the precious blood of
Christ, that they may not be as a wall of separation between thee and me, to
hide thy face, and to stop the sweet influences of thy favor from me. And
seeing thou requirest this duty which I am now about to perform, and have
inclined my heart to yield obedience, O thou, who art only able to bring it to
good effect, vouchsafe unto me the gracious assistance of thine holy Spirit,
and thereby enable me to atchieue it in some such manner, as may be acceptable
unto thee, and profitable for mine own salvation. Inlighten my darkened
understanding, that I may rightly conceive of thy Truth; sharpen mine
invention, strengthen my memory, incline my auerse will to this holy duty,
sanctify, supple, and soften my hard and rebellious heart, and enlarge it with
holy and heavenly desires, inflame it with the love of thee and spiritual
things, with fervent devotion, and with an ardent zeal of thy glory. Rectify
the disorder of my corrupt affections and tumultuous passions; curb and keep
in my wandering thoughts and rouing heart, and knit them fast unto thee in the
bonds of thy love and fear, that they may not range after worldly vanities,
and distract me in this duty; but grant that they may be so wholly intent to
this present exercise, that I may bring it to some profitable and good issue:
And so bless me therein, that I may find the fruit and benefit of it in mine
own soul, by having the point on which I am now to meditate, better cleared
to my understanding, for the increasing of saving knowledge, more thoroughly
imprinted in my weak memory, that it may be always ready for use, and more
effectually wrought into my heart and affections, that I may hereby find my
corruptions more subdued and abated, the saving graces of thy Spirit increased,
and my whole man more and more enabled to perform unto thee with
cheerfulness and diligence all the duties of a godly life, to the glory of
thine holy Name, and the comfort and salvation of mine own soul, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.
CAP. XIX.
Of our progress and proceeding in the exercise of Meditation, and what is
required therein.

. Sect. 1 That we must proceed orderly in this exercise, laying down the
grounds in our understandings and building upon them in our hearts and
affections.
ANd thus much of our ingresse and preparation to Meditation; the second point
propounded, is our progress and proceeding in the exercise it self; wherein
we must avoid disorder and preposterous handling of the point propounded to our
Meditation, which is the author of tumultuous confusion, by which being tired,
we either break off the exercise, or continue it without fruit; and
contrariwise, proceed in an orderly course, first laying the grounds of this
exercise, and then building upon them. To which purpose we are to know, that
there are diverse ends of this exercise, as the inlightning of our minds with
saving knowledge, and the imprinting of it in our memories, which are not the
main things intended in it, but as helps and means conduce unto them. For
the principal ends at which we are to aim, is, that we may hereby more and
more incline our wills, and work our hearts and affections to the choosing,
embracing, and loving of that good, and the refusing, shunning, and abhorring
of that evil, which they come to know more clearly by this discourse of the
understanding, and that we may make good use of all we know in the whole course
of our lives. Notwithstanding, because our wills and affections are but blind
faculties, which of themselves cannot tell rightly what to choose or refuse,
affect or dislike; therefore the understanding faculty, which is the eye of the
soul, and the chief Captain and Leader of all her forces, must always
accompany them for their direction in this exercise of Meditation. So one
says, that there is a twofold access or progress of contemplation; Bern. in
Cantic. Sermon. 46.
the one in the understanding, the other in the affection; the one yielding
light, the other heat; the one in acquisition of matter, the other in
devotion. Of which two, the understanding is to have the precedencie in this
exercise, that the will, heart, and affections, may work by it light, being
led and guided, moved and excited by it, to choose or refuse, love or loath,
that which it propounds unto them, either good or evil. But yet the chief
part of our time and strength is not to be spent in the discourse of the
understanding, theory, and speculation, but having attained hereby to some
knowledge of the point in hand, we are chiefly to labor, that we may work it
upon our hearts and affections, for the increasing of their holiness, the
inflaming of our love, stirring up of our devotion, and the strengthening and
inabling of us to make use of that we know, in the practice of it in our lives.
In which regard, we are to stint and shorten the discourse of our
understanding, that our wills, hearts, and affections may have more liberty and
conueniencie to attain unto their maine ends. To which purpose, we must
consider, that in this exercise we principally seek after goodness, which is
the object of the will, rather then truth, which is the object of the
understanding; and to be made more holy, rather then more learned; unto which
we cannot attain by the bare discourse of the understanding, seeing simple
knowledge of good and evil, does not make a man better or worse, but the
willing and affecting good things, and the nilling and hating of the contrary.
Secondly, if we do not limit and abridge the discourse of our reason, it will
carry us too far in our curious disquisition after knowledge, wherein we
naturally delight, as the lamentable experience of our first parents has too
plainly taught us, and the more of that time destinated to this exercise, is
spent and taken up by intellectual discourse, the less remains for our
chiefest business, which is to be effected by our will and affections.
Thirdly, seeing both our Spirits, and also all the powers of our souls are but
finite and feeble, therefore the more we spend them in theory and speculation,
the less ability they will have in the exercise of our love and devotion; even
as the water which issues from a fountain, must needs run with less force,
when as it is divided into diverse streams. Finally, ieiune and barren
contemplation, does little or nothing nourish the soul, seeing it is not the
food it self whereby it is cheered, but only a means whereby it is prepared;
and as the preparation it self of our food does not nourish the body, but the
feeding upon, disgestion, and application of it unto every several part; so
neither does the discourse of the understanding and invention of matter,
nourish the soul in any saving graces, seeing it is not the proper nourishment
it self, but only the means to prepare it, which being received by the will,
and disgested and applied by the heart and affections, does turn to our
spiritual nourishment, inflaming us inwardly with the love of God, zeal and
devotion, and working in us the true fear of God, affiance, hope, patience,
humility, hatred of sin, contempt of the world, and all other virtues and
saving graces. And therefore contenting our selves with the simple and plain
understanding of the matter whereon we meditate, and not spending our time in
any nice and curious disquisition, let us employ the most part of our time and
pains, in working thereby our wills, hearts, and affections, to more purity
and holiness, which is the main end of this exercise, unto which, if we
attain not, all our labor is spent in vain, and will bring unto us no
spiritual profit. For as those Artificers and Inginers, who spend the most of
their time in new inventions and curious devices, and when they have found them
out, there leave them, and betake themselves to a new search, no further using
the old, for the raising thereby some profit of their invention; are ranked in
the number of noted beggars; and being richest in skill, are above all others
poorest in estate: whereas others, who draw all they know into use, and
exercise their skill, though but plain and small, in their painful and
diligent labors, that thereby they may daily add something to their state,
do prove rich men, and of far more worth and credit, then those exquisite
and curious Artisans: so is it in this case; those who are most intent unto
curious speculations, and exceed all others in scholasticall knowledge and
ieiune contemplations, proving for the most part mere beggars in the sanctity
of the heart and affections, and in the power and practice of devotion and
godliness.

. Sect. 2 That we must find out a fit theme, and then discourse upon it
according to the rules of reason.
Now the right course of proceeding in our meditations in respect of our
understandings, is, first, that being assisted with judgment, they do by some
disquisition and discourse, find and pick out of the general stock, some
fit and profitable theme, whereupon we may spend our pains and time allotted
to this present exercise. And when they have pitched upon it, they are in the
next place to distinguish and clear it from all other things that are of like
name, but of a different nature, or hold some similitude and agreement in the
general matter, but are diverse and distinct in their special forms. The
which distinction in our knowledge, or between things known, is the mother of
clear understanding and sound judgment, and inableth us with much perspicuity
to proceed in our discourse. And when we have gone thus far, we must then
employ our understanding to find out some fit definition or description of the
theme or matter whereon we meditate; about which we need not to be curious,
striving to reach unto the strict rules of art, but only to make our conceit
in some sort capable of it, and to bring the point in hand within the compass
and reach of our understandings. Which when we have done, we must further
amplify and enlarge our matter, that yet our minds may more clearly and
distinctly conceive and comprehend it, and our wills, hearts and affections
may afterward work upon, and apply it for better and more plentiful use, in
the inflaming of our love, and stirring up our devotion; by bringing it through
the common places of invention, according to the rules of art, which being but
the polishing and perfecting of natural reason, it will not seem hard or
strange unto us, if we have but the help of some good directions and fit
examples for our imitation. Now these places of which I speak, are the causes
of all kinds, as the efficient cause, procreant or conseruant, principal or
isntrumental, the matter of which, and the form by which it existeth, the
final cause for which it is, and whereunto it tends; the effects and fruits
of it, the subject place wherein it is, or the object about which it is
exercised; the adjuncts, properties, and (as we call them) the appurtenances
belonging to it; what things are diverse from it, or opposite or contrary unto
it, either in relation or nature. The things whereunto it may be compared,
either in quantity or quality, and by what similitudes it may be illustrated
and made thereby both more easy and familiar, and more fit to make in the
memory a deeper impression, and to work with greater efficacy upon the heart
and affections. The names and titles of it, which being rightly given, do show
the nature of the thing which is called by them. The which are best considered
when we define the thing whereof we meditate, where beginning with the name
of the thing defined, we may proceed to the parts of the definition. But above
all other places, we are to prefer the divine testimonies of holy Scriptures,
which are most effectual for the inlightening of the understanding, the
conuincing of the judgment, the persuading and inclining of the will, and the
working of the point in hand upon the heart and affections. In which respect,
it is most profitable that we call to our remembrance those places which are
fittest for our purpose, to prove or illustrate the matter in hand, and to
apply them for the strengthening and confirming of all the other places of
invention, as proofs of them, orderly proceeding from one to another, in that
method and manner before expressed. To all which purposes the testimonies of
holy Scriptures are most pregnant, powerful, and profitable; for howsoever
humane testimonies are above all other arguments of least authority and
efficacy in any art, because their whole strength rests upon the credit of
men, who are all liers and subject to errors; yet in matters of Divinity,
testimonies of holy Scripture are of greatest validity and authority, and far
above all other arguments and proofs produced by humane reason, seeing they
are the Oracles of God, who being truth it self, can neither deceive, nor be
deceived; and being sufficient to all spiritual uses, will yield unto us
plentiful matter to furnish our meditations, though we were unable to make use
of the other. Notwithstanding those other helps, by bringing the point in hand
through all the common places of invention, especially these testimonies of
Scripture being joined with all and every of them, to confirm and strengthen
them, are not to be neglected, because they will much further us in our orderly
proceeding, and for the amplifying and enlarging, clearing and proving the
point whereon we meditate, and furnishing us with variety of matter: Yet here
too much curiosity is to be avoided, in bringing every point through every head
or common place of invention, because every theme whereon we meditate will not
admit such considerations. As God, infinite in all perfection, and far above
the reach of humane reason, cannot in our meditations of him be brought through
the most of those common places, seeing he has no causes, being Jehovah, the
cause of causes, and having his being in himself, gives being to all things.
Neither has he (if we speak properly) any place, seeing he contains all
things, and is contained of nothing, nor any accidents or qualities, seeing all
his attributes and properties are his Essence; nor any contraries, seeing there
cannot be the like reason of things finite, and him that is infinite, and
nothing can truly oppose his omnipotent nature, although they do it in show
and in our weak apprehension; neither can he be compared in quantity, or
quality, seeing he is above all comparison, and nothing is equal or like unto
him: And finally, he is not subject to any distribution, being a most simple
nature and indivisible, who has neither Genus, nor species, parts nor members;
nor unto any definition, seeing his infinite nature is unsearchable; howsoever,
he may be described by that which he is not, rather then by that he is, though
he be the chief being, that we may in some dark manner conceive of him in
our shallow capacity. Besides, there are other theames which we cannot bring
through diverse of these heads without much difficulty, especially the
specificall matter and forms, which in most things are unknown unto us. And
therefore our course must be, among many places of invention, to take those
which being most pregnant and profitable, do with some ease offer themselves
to our meditations, as the causes efficient and effects, properties and
qualities, and not tie our selves too strictly to find out all, which would
rather distract then help us in this exercise. But chiefly aiming in all this
discourse of our understanding, at the right use and maine end of it: which is
not curiously to play the Artists, but to spend our time in a religious
exercise, for the increase of our devotion, our enriching with spiritual
grace, and for the strengthening of us unto all duties of a godly life; when we
find any difficulty in our invention, or stop in our way, we must pass by it,
and think on that which is next, and more easy to be found.

. Sect. 3 That we are in our meditations chiefly to respect our will, hearts and
affections, our lives and actions.
And thus we are to proceed in the first part of meditation, which respects
the discourse of our mind and understanding: The second part respects the
practique faculties, the will, heart, and affections, the life and actions,
unto which in this exercise we are to have chief regard, that they may thereby
be sanctified and nourished in all spiritual graces, and strengthened to the
performance of all holy duties, with cheerfulness and delight. Neither is it
sufficient, that we do by the former means provide plenty of spiritual food,
fit for the nourishment of our souls, unless we also feed upon it, and apply
it unto them for their special use. It is not enough that we prepare abundant
means and matter for our spiritual good, unless we fit and apply them to
those ends and uses for which we did prepare them, whereof if we fail, all
our former labor will be vain and fruitless. For as it does not avail a
man, for the preservation and comfort of his life, that his granaries and
storehouses are full of all good provision, no not to have his table thoroughly
furnished with all variety of meats, if he do not feed upon them; nor to have
his chests and wardrobe full of apparel, if he do not put them on, nor
(miser-like) to hoord up treasures in abundance, and never convert them to use,
nor employ them for the relief of his necessity, and comfort of his life: so
it will not profit us at all for the nourishing, strengthening and refreshing
of our souls, to make provision in all kinds, and to lay it up in the
storehouse of our minds and memories, if it be not applied to our hearts and
affections, which are the most essential and vital parts of a true Christian,
that they may nourish and comfort them, and make them active and able to
perform with cheerfulness, all holy duties of a Christian life. To which
purpose there is further required, after we have by the discourse of our
understandings, cleared and enlarged the matter whereon we meditate, with much
variety, that we now labor to bring all which we have thought upon, by
special application to our own particular use, and to work and enforce it
upon our hearts and consciences, that they may have a lively taste, and through
sense and feeling of it, stirring up our affections, according to the nature
and quality of the matter, either to holy love or hatred, to admiration or
contempt, joy or sorrow, hope or fear, desire or abhorring, confidence or
shame, and so in the rest. Thus if the subject matter of our meditation be
good, both in it own nature, and unto us, we are by considering the Author
and end of it, the beauty and excellency, the profit and benefit, the necessity
of having it, and the misery of wanting it, to work it into our hearts, by
inflaming them with the love and desire of it, by stirring them up with
admiration in their pursuit, and joy in their fruition, by affecting them with
hope of obtaining them, either in respect of matter or degree, and with care
and fear of losing or lessening them. But if it be evil and wicked, we are,
by considering the causes and fountain from which it springs, the pernicious
ends whereto it tends, the mischievous effects which it produces, the
deformity and baseness, the loss and misery, unprofitableness and
maliciousness of it, to work our hearts to a further detestation and lothing,
to a contempt, auersation and abhorring of it, if by the tentations of our
spiritual enemies it be pressed upon us, or to shame and sorrow, if they be
tainted with it, and have given it admission. Neither must we content our
selves with weak motions in this kind, but we must labor to work in our
hearts fervent affections, and such as discover much zeal and devotion; not
thinking it enough to taste of these spiritual meats which the discourse of
our understandings has set before us, and so to leave them (as it were)
standing upon the table, without receiving by them any further benefit; but we
must hunger and thirst after them with longing and earnest desires, we must
labor to have a through sense and feeling of their comfortable sweetness, yea
we must swallow them down and digest them, not so much in our stomachs, as
in the ventricles of our hearts, to increase the vital spirits of our souls,
which may enable us to live the life of grace, and make us fit and vigorous for
spiritual motion. And the more we find our selves affected with these
spiritual delicacies; and the more sweetness and benefit we relish in them,
the more earnestly must we still stir up our affections to go on in this
spiritual pursuit, setting up (as it were) all our sails, when we have got a
prosperous gale; and when we are come to a good vein in this golden mine, we
must not be satisfied when we have made an entrance, but dig into it further
with more diligence, encouraging and comforting our selves in this delightful
labor with these first good beginnings.

. Sect. 4 That we must not be discouraged, though we cannot at the first feel
the fruit of our meditations.
But what if we cannot, after some good endeavor, feel the sweetness of this
exercise? yet we must not be discouraged and give it over, but use all good
means to recover our taste and spiritual appetite; seeing the cause of the
defect is in their indisposition, and not because this spiritual food wants
sweetness. And seeing it is not a matter intellectual and subject to the
discourse of the mind, but rather of sense and practice, caused by a secret
fitting and application of it to the object, which is principally done by the
Spirit of God, working in our hearts, and instrumentally by a lively faith;
therefore we are not to labor so much to stir up our affections, that we may
relish this sweetness by discourse of reason, which works little upon the
sense and appetite, and much less by vehement agitation of the body and
outward parts to draw on passion, like Actours upon a Stage, as some have
foolishly prescribed, but applying the points whereon we have discoursed by
faith, let us labor to gain the relish and taste of sweetness in them,
rather by prayer then by arguments. Neither let this discourage us and
interrupt our exercise, but let us, submitting our selves to the good will and
pleasure of God, wait his leisure with meekness and patience, expecting when
he will be pleased to descend into our hearts by his holy Spirit, to move and
excite our affections, as sometime the Angel into the Poole, that he might
trouble the waters. According to that in the Lamentations; It is good that a
man Lam. 3. 26.
should both hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord. Which if
we do, we shall assuredly find the fruit of our labor. For as the Prophet
speaks of vision, so may I of this spiritual visitation; It stays but for
Habak. 2. 3.
the appointed time, but at the end it shall speak comfort to our hearts and
not lie. Though it seem to tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it
will not tarry. Yea, if we be not discouraged with this delay, but continue our
exercise in obedience to God, laboring to perform it as we are able, when we
cannot do it in such perfection as we would, the Lord when he comes to
visit our hearts, will bring in his hand double wages, rewarding both our
obedience and duty, and also our faith and patience, by filling our hearts with
spiritual comforts, quickening their appetite, and replenishing them with holy
affections. So that though (like green wood) they are not presently inflamed,
but need much blowing before they can be thoroughly kindled, yet if we continue,
they will, through Gods blessing, recompense our labor, seeing at the last
their heat will exceed and bring unto us more lasting comfort, then if they
had (like wood that is sear) been quickly kindled with much less labor.

. Sect. 5 Of the means whereby we may feel our hearts affected with a lively
taste and sense of the things whereon we meditate.
And thus we see how we are to have our hearts affected with a lively taste,
sense and feeling of the things whereon we meditate: now the means whereby we
may have it wrought in us are diverse. First, we must examine our selves in the
court of conscience, according to the rule of Gods Word, how we have profited
and thriuen in those graces, and in the practice of those duties, or how we
have been tainted with those corruptions, and how far forth we have been
guilty of those sins whereon we have meditated; what defects in those graces
and duties do still remain in us, or in the full and perfect mortification of
our vices, and reformation of our lives, by leaving and forsaking of those
sins which in our meditations we have thought upon. By which examination (as
we shall afterward show more at large) we shall come both to a true sight of
our graces and holy duties in which we have profited, and of the progress
which we have made in the mortification of our corruptions, which will affect
our hearts with unfeigned thankfulness unto God, by whose grace and assistance
we have been enabled hereunto, and with the fervent love of him who has been
so gracious unto us, and with a lively sense and feeling of our spiritual
wants, and of those corruptions and sins which yet adhere unto us, that we may
be truly humbled in the sight and feeling of our wants and imperfections, and
labor to come out of them by hearty repentance. Secondly, when by this
examination we have come to a true sight of our wants and weaknesses, and have
affected our hearts with a true sense of them, we must make an humble
acknowledgement of them unto God and our own souls, laying open our wants
like distressed suitors, before him who is only able to supply the^ and our
spiritual wounds of sin, and putrified sores of corruption, before the
Physician of our souls, who is All-sufficient, and willing to heal and cure
them. With which humble confession our hearts will be affected with a more
through hatred of all our sinful corruptions, and with longing desires to have
all our wants supplied, and also with true comfort, and inward joy in the
assurance of their remission, and the satisfying of our desires, seeing if we
acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive them, if we 1.
Ioh. 1. 7. 1. Pet. 5. 6. Luke 1. 53.
humble our selves, he will exalt us; and if seeing our own emptiness, we
hunger and thirst after grace and righteousness, he will fill and replenish
us. Thirdly, there must follow upon this a lamentable complaint in respect of
the grace wherein we are defective, and the corruption and sin which does yet
adhere and cleave unto us, not so much in regard of any evil of punishment
accompanying them, from which we are delivered through Gods mercy, and Christ's
merits, as because we have by them offended and dishonored our great and
glorious God, who has been so gracious to forgive them. The consideration
whereof must affect our hearts not only with mournful sorrow, which must
break out into these bitter complaints, but also with an holy anger against
our selves, which must show it self by expostulating the matter with our
souls, by aggravating our sins and wants, and by rebuking their sloth and
sluggishnes in neglecting the means which the Lord has plentifully afforded
us for the mortifying of the one, and supplying of the other. Fourthly, upon
this sight and sense of our wants and sins, and complaint of our distress
and misery in regard of them, there must follow a vehement and passionate wish,
whereby we are to express the feruency and earnest longing of our desires, to
have that grace supplied or increased wherein we find our defect, and that
vice and sin pardoned and mortified which we feel still cleaving unto us;
crying out with David in a patheticall manner, O that my ways were so
directed, that I might keep thy statutes! And again, Psalm. 119. 5, 20.
My soul breaks, for the longing that it has to thy judgments at all
times. And with the Apostle Paul, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver
Romans 7. 24.
me from the body of this death? The which wishes and longing desires will
affect our hearts with much comfort in assurance of fruition, seeing the Lord
has promised to satisfy the desires of those that fear and serve Psalm. 145.
19.
him. Fifthly, upon this must follow an utter denial of our selves and our
own strength, and an humble acknowledgement of our impotency and
insufficiency, either to supply the defect of that good thing which we desire,
or to remove that evil, and subdue that corruption, which though we hate, does
notwithstanding still adhere and cleave unto us, confessing with the Apostle,
that we are not sufficient as of our selves so much as to think a good 2. Cor.
3. 5.
thought, and that whatsoever sufficiency there is in us, we have received
from the Lord, who alone works in us both to will and to do. The which 1.
Cor. 4. 7. Phil.
acknowledgement, being made with humble hearts and broken spirits, is most
necessary and profitable; for to whom should we acknowledge our impotency and
weakness, rather then unto him who is able to manifest his power in our
infirmities, and to give us such spiritual abilities, that we 2. Cor. 12. 9.
shall be enabled to do all things which he requires, through the power of
him that strengthens us. Sixthly, after this humble confession Phil. 4. 13.
must follow earnest Petition, whereby we must crave with all feruency at the
hands of God, that he will so assist us with his grace and holy Spirit, and
bless unto us all good means which we use for the increasing of that virtue
in which we are defective, and for the strengthening of us to that good duty,
unto which in our selves we find an utter disability, or for the mortifying of
that vice and corruption, which in our own strength we are not able to subdue
and overcome; attributing unto him the glory and praise of his own power and
all sufficiency, whereby he is able; and of his goodness, love, and truth,
whereby he is ready and willing to supply by himself whatsoever is wanting and
defective in our abilities. The which feruency of our suits, we must in
sincerity of heart enforce with all importunity, urging and aggravating our
own impotency and need of Gods help, and his sufficiency to do what we
desire, and truth, whereby he has bound himself to perform it. Lastly, out of
the consideration of this all sufficiency and truth of God, we must raise up
our souls which were humbled in the sight and sense of our wants, and
impotency to supply them, with firm confidence, and breaking through all doubts
and difficulties, assure our selves that God, who is so able and true of his
Word, will graciously grant these things which he has commanded us to ask;
and that as he has enlarged our hearts with hearty love and fervent desires,
after the more full fruition of that good, or freedom from that evil whereon
we have meditated, so he will perfect his own good work, replenish that room
which himself has prepared, and satisfy those holy desires, which by his
good Spirit he has wrought in us. Which confidence may move us to rejoice in
the Lord, and to glory after an holy manner in the assurance of our victory
over our corruptions, and of our fruition of those graces, wherein as yet we
are defective and imperfect.

. Sect. 6 Of the egresse and conclusion of our Meditation.
The last point to be considered in this exercise of Meditation, is our egresse
and conclusion, which must not be sudden and abrupt, seeing this were neither
comely nor profitable, but deliberate and by degrees. And as Orators prescribe
in the Art of Rhetoric and elocution, that we should begin with a low voice,
quiet affections, and action, and so rising by degrees till we come to our
highest pitch of extension and earnestness, both of inward and outward motion,
not to break off abruptly in this height, but remitting both voice, affection,
and action, by degrees: so must we do in this case; for having begun our
Meditation in intellectual discourse, with quiet minds and calm affections,
and raised them to that height of feruencie and devotion, whilst we have
labored to attain unto a lively sense and feeling of spiritual taste, in the
matter whereon we have meditated, we must not make an abrupt conclusion, but
with some remission of our former fervor, compose our minds and hearts to
their former quietness and calmnesse. And first, we must cast back the eye of
our minds to reuiew our former exercise, and to examine how we have performed
it, and what fruit and benefit our hearts and souls have felt and tasted in
it. And if we find that it has well succeeded, we are to congratulate with our
own souls, in the joyful fruition of so great a blessing, and to give the
whole glory to God, by whose help only we have so well prospered in this
exercise; rendering unto him with cheerful hearts, all praise and
thanksgiving, for the gracious assistance of his holy Spirit, whereby he has
directed us in our course, enlightened our minds, confirmed our memories,
inflamed our hearts and affections with his love and true devotion, giving unto
them a lively taste and feeling of spiritual comfort, in the things whereon
we have meditated. The which our thanksgiving we may enlarge from the subject
matter of our Meditation, as if it be some point of doctrine, for inlightning
our minds in the knowledge of that truth, and inflaming our hearts with the
love of it; if it be some grace and virtue, for revealing the beauty,
excellency, profit, and necessity of it to our understandings, for causing us
to embrace and love it with our hearts and affections, and for working it in
some measure in us by his Spirit; if it be a duty, for teaching us his ways,
and inabling us to walk in them; or if it be a vice and sin, for discovering
to our minds, the deformity, haynousnesse, and danger, and working our hearts
to a true loathing and detestation of it. But if we have found many wants and
weaknesses in the performing of it, as dullness, and blindness of mind,
wandering thoughts, and worldly distractions, coldness of devotion, deadness
of affection, and by reason hereof, little taste of sweetness, and of the
fruit of all our labor, we are to crave pardon at Gods hands, and to be
humbled in the sight and sense of our own weakness and corruption. And then
laboring to find out the causes of this untowardness, let us resolve to use
our best means to remove them against the next time, that we may perform
this exercise with more fruit and benefit. Finally, we may conclude this whole
exercise, by recommending our selves, our souls and bodies into the hands of
God, which some Writers on this Argument do call Oblation or offering, whereby
we consecrate and deuote our selves wholly unto God, desiring no longer to
live unto the world or our own flesh, but unto him, that we may do him
service, and in all things please him; denying our own wills, that they may
be submitted unto his, and craving his protection against all enemies who
would hinder us in this our resolution, and direction and assistance in the
whole course of our lives, that all our thoughts, words, and actions, may be
suitable and answerable, both to our general profession of Christianity, and
to those conceits, desires, and resolutions which we have expressed in our
last Meditations. And so reposing our selves with holy and quiet security, upon
the care and providence of our gracious Father, we may profitably conclude
this exercise, by singing to Gods praise some part or verse of David's Psalms,
suitable to our present disposition, or the subject matter of our former
Meditation.

CAP. XX.
An example and pattern of Meditation, the subject matter whereof is true and
unfeigned repentance.

. Sect. 1 The reason of this choice: what repentance is, and the causes thereof.
Having thus set down the doctrine of Meditation, it now follows, that I
propound an example of it, according to the former rules and directions. Where
first we are to make choice of the subject matter whereon we purpose to
meditate, and then to discourse of it with our understanding, and to feel the
virtue and efficacy of it in our hearts, the which must be done in a
Soliloquie between us and our souls, or rather of the soul to it self, after
this manner: Now that thou have (O my soul) sequestered thy self from all
society, that thou may have some secret conference between thee and thy
self, in the alone presence of God and thine own conscience; make choice of
some fit subject whereon thou may spend thy pains and time with most profit
for thy spiritual good, that laying a good foundation, thou may erect thy
building with more ease and fruit. And what fitter matter, upon this present
occasion can thou choose to think upon, then upon that excellent grace and
duty of repentance, which is the first beginning of a godly life, and after it
is begun, accompanies it unto the end, as a chief agent in all this work?
Upon what better argument can thou meditate then upon this, which the
Prophets and Apostles have so much beat upon? yea, which our Savior Christ
himself thought so necessary and profitable, that he did not only make it the
subject of his own Sermons, but being to ascend, commended it at his last
farewell to his Apostles, as the chiefest theme, next unto faith, upon Luke
24. 37.
which he would have them to preach in his Name. A duty that belongs unto all,
and is never unseasonable; always necessary: An Evangelical grace and chief
fruit of faith, in which it lives, without which it is dead. So that as faith
is the life of our souls, by applying Christ unto us, in whom we live, so
repentance, in respect of our sense and feeling, which can no otherwise judge
of the hidden root, but by the outward fruit, is the life of this life. As
faith is the only condition of the Covenant of grace, which assures us of all
good things temporal and eternal; so repentance as a counter-bond, assures
unto us this assurance, and by a sensible infallibility and outward evidence,
persuades us that we perform this condition of believing in Christ, and
apprehending all the promises by faith unfeigned. Now that thou may (O my
soul) proceed in some order, what is this repentance, but an Evangelical and
saving grace of God, wrought in thine heart by his holy Spirit, applying by
faith (as by his instrument) Christ and all his benefits, which inflaming thine
heart with fervent love, does make thee look upon him whom thou have pierced,
to bewail thy sins, as the chief causes of his death, to hate and forsake
them, and to turn unto God, offering unto thee grace and pardon, by amendment
of life, and bringing forth the fruits of new obedience. So that it is a grace
and free gift, and no natural endowment which comes by inheritance, or else
procured by thine own purchase. It is the gift of God, who gives unto thee
all good things. It is a gift of his free grace, preventing thee when thou
did never so much as think of it, by putting into thy mind the profit and
necessity of it, and into thy heart some desire of receiving it, preparing and
fitting thee for it, by the preaching of the Law, working humiliation,
contrition, and legal sorrow, and fitting thy mind and will, that they might
consent and obey the motions of the Spirit, outward in the Word, and inward in
the heart and conscience; working it first in thee, by changing the mind and
heart, and turning them from sin, unto holiness and righteousness,
co-working with thee, that thou may continue, renew, and increase in the
practice of it, and perfecting thy repentance, in the parts and degrees of it
which himself begun. It is he that calls us to repentance, and inableth us
to repent. He strikes our stony hearts, and makes them to relent by sound
contrition, before these rocks will yield any waters of true repentance. It is
he that powers the Spirit Ezekiel. 11. 29. and 36. 26. Zach. 12. 10. Act. 5. 31,
and 11. 18. 2. Tim. 2. 25.
of grace upon the house of Judah, before they can lament for their
wickedness, and that gives repentance to the house of Israel, and with it
remission of sins. Thou can not turn unto him (O my soul) before he
first turn unto thee, nor weep bitterly with Peter, till he thaw thy frozen
heart, by reflecting upon thee the beams of his gracious countenance. Yea,
when he turns, thou can not turn, till he turning his face, turn also
thine heart, as it is running away with fear, and never looking back, that
thou may behold his gracious countenance, promising nothing but good, and
his stretched out Arm, to receive thee unto grace and favor. Surely (says
the Church) after I was turned, I repented, and after that Ier. 31. 19. Lam. 5.
21.
I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh. No man can sorrow for his sins, nor
resolve to forsake them, but he that hates them, nor any hate them, but they
who love God, nor any love him, whose hearts he first inflameth not, by
sheading abroad his love in them by the holy Ghost, which he gives unto Romans
5. 5. 1. Joh. 4. 19.
us. Neither does he work alone, but together with his Son and holy Spirit.
For it is the blood of this Lamb of God, which works our adamantine hearts
to this relenting softness, and the water which issued out of his pierced
side, which being beheld with the eye of faith, does draw out of our eyes, the
brinish waters of repentant tears. And therefore because he is the Author of
our repentance, both as he procured it by the meritorious virtue of his death,
and works it by his bloodshed applied by faith, he inioyneth his Apostles to
preach repentance in his Name. Finally, Luke 24. 47.
it is the oil of the holy Spirit, which suppleth and softneth our hard and
stony hearts; It is this divine fire, which warming our cold hearts with the
flame of Gods love, and the hot blood that issued from our Savior, causes
them to send up into our heads these salt, yet sweet waters of unfeigned
repentance, which distill by our eyes, and in trickling tears drop from our
cheeks. This wind of the Spirit must blow upon us, yea must blow into us,
before we can return unto God one sigh to express our sorrow for our sins.
And therefore (O my soul) seeing God is the principal cause of thy
repentance, rob him of no part of his due, but ascribe unto him the whole glory
of his own work. Which though he could effect by his sole immediate power,
yet he is pleased to use in it many subordinate causes, means, and
instruments, by which he works this grace in thee: As ministerial and
helping causes, namely, the Ministers of the Word, who in this work are
co-labourers with Christ, sent by him to open men's eyes, and to turn them from
darkness to light, and from Act. 26. 18.
the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
inheritance, among them that are sanctified by faith in Christ, in which
respect, they are called spiritual fathers, begetting them to God by the seed
of the 1. Cor. 4. 15.
Word. So likewise isntrumental causes, which are inward, precedent, and
immediate, as saving knowledge, showing the way to repentance, a lively faith,
unfeigned love, and true fear of God, both in respect of his mercies and
judgments, especially the last and general Judgment at Act. 17. 30.
the end of the world; or else outward, which either lead and draw, or else
move and persuade us to repentance. Of the former sort are many instruments
and means to bring us to it. As the Ministry of the Word; and first, the
preaching of the Law, which prepares us for it, and of the Esa. 55. 7.
Gospel which works it in us, by assuring us, that if we will turn to the
Lord, he will have mercy upon us, and forgive us our sins. So also crosses
Psalm. 119. 71. Luke 13. 1, 2, 3. Romans 2. 4.
and afflictions, either upon our selves or others; Gods blessings and
benefits, either promised or bestowed. The moving and persuading causes are
innumerable; as the love of God toward us, his patience and long suffering,
his truth in his promises, and all sufficiency in performance, the profit of it
in this life, seeing it brings with it peace of conscience, and joy in the
holy Ghost, and makes way for our eternal salvation in the life to come; the
necessity of it, seeing without it nothing can save us, with it no sin can
condemn us, being an inseparable fruit of faith, which is the alone condition
of all promised happiness, etc. And these with many other, are the causes (O
my soul) which all concur together to work thy heart unto unfeigned
repentance, which being in themselves so powerful and preualent to produce
this effect, will leave thee quite without excuse, if they be not effectual to
this end.

. Sect. 7 Of the matter, form, and parts of repentance, and first, of
humiliation.
And now (my soul) that thou see the efficient causes of repentance,
consider also the matter and form of it, as they meet together in the parts
thereof, which are humiliation, and godly sorrow for thy sins, and turning
unto God by reformation and amendment, the former part more directly expressing
the matter, the latter, the form of thy repentance. And both these the
Scriptures conioyne in this one work. For thus Solomon speaks of it, when
they shall humble themselves, and turn from their evil 2. Chro. 7. 14.
ways; and Joel exhorts the people to turn unto the Lord with weeping, to
Joel 2. 11, 12. Act. 26. 20.
rend their hearts and not their garments, and to turn unto the Lord.
Howsoever in many places they name but one of them, and thereby understand the
other. And therefore (O my soul) see that thou disioyne not those things which
thy God has joined together: content not thy self with Esa. 58.
such a sorrow, as brings forth no amendment, which was rejected in Ahab,
Judas, Cain, and the people of the Jews; for these tears, like filthy waters,
do but the more pollute thee, and this worldly sorrow, proceeding 2. Cor. 7.
10, 11.
not from hatred of sin or love of God, but from self-love and fear of
punishment, causes death, and is a sorrow which must be sorrovved for: nor yet
with such an amendment, which arises not from sense of sin and godly
remorse and sorrovv for it, which was the repentance of Herod, who is said to
have done many things according to the Baptists doctrine and direction, but not
to have sorrowed for sin past, as he obeyed for the present; of Judas, who
was outwardly reformed as the other Apostles, but never truly and thoroughly
humbled; and so of Demas, and many civil worldlings and temporaries, who in
many things change their course from evil to good, but have no change of their
hearts grounded upon unfeigned contrition and humiliation. But what is this, but
to build without a foundation, and to dismember and destroy this perfect body,
by pulling one part from another? And therefore (my soul) join these parts in
thy repentance; lay first the foundation, and then build upon it; bewail thy
sins with bitter grief, and then forsake them in heart and action, and turn
to thy God in amendment of life. Now unto this humiliation, thou must first be
prepared by the Law, which like a Schoolmasters whippeth thee, and makes thee
to cry out in the sense of thy sins, and the curse due unto them, and utterly
to deny thy self and thine own righteousness, as altogether insufficient to
satisfy Gods Justice; and then it must be wrought in thee by the Gospel,
which reuealeth unto thee the perfect righteousness and obedience of thy
Savior Christ, by which his Justice being fully satisfied, his wrath also is
appeased, the pardon of thy sins, if thou bathe thy self in the blood of
Christ, by the hand of faith, and assures thee that thou art reconciled unto
God, and become his child by grace and adoption. The which will make thee to
melt and resolve into tears of unfeigned sorrow for thy sins, whereby thou
have displeased so gracious a Father, which godly grief will cause repentance
not to be repented of. And this is that sound humiliation which the Scriptures
do so often call for; which thou may discern, if it be truly in thee, by
diverse signs that always accompany it; For the object of it is not punishment
chiefly, but thy sin, and not sin as it stingeth and tormenteth thy
conscience, but as it is an offense which has displeased thy God, causing thee
to say unto him with David, Take away my sin, and purge me from my guilt: and
not with Pharaoh, Let my sin alone, but take away this plague. It always
causes thee to draw nearer unto God, that thou may beg and obtain
pardon, and not to flee from him to escape his punishing Hos. 6. 1.
hand. It works repentance and reformation of those sins which we bewail,
and not (like children) to lie still and cry; It is a willing and free will
Psalm. 51. 17.
offering of thine heart, in which, as God is delighted, so is it pleasing and
sweet unto thee, causing thee to lift up thine head with hope and comfort, when
thou art thus humbled, and to rejoice in such sorrow; and is not pressed out of
thee by the weight of Gods wrath, the curse of the Law, or smart of punishment.
The effects of this thy humiliation, is, that it drives thee to God by prayer,
wherein thou humbly acknowledgest thy sins, accusing thy self for them, as
liable to the curse, by reason of their guilt, aggravating them by many
circumstances, condemning thy self as worthy of all punishments temporal and
eternal, justifying Gods righteous judgment, if he should impose them,
magnifying his mercy with the repentant Church, if he spare thee in any, and
do not utterly consume Lamen. 3 22.
thee. After which confession, there follows an humble and earnest suite for
pardon and remission; wherein thou must with David cry out unto thy God; Have
mercy upon me, O Lord, according to thy loving kindness; according to the
multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions; wash me Psalm. 51.
1, 2.
thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

. Sect. 3 Of the second part of repentance, which consists in conversion and
amendment.
The second part of thy repentance (O my soul) is thy conversion and
amendment, whereby thou turnest from thy sins unto God, desiring and
indeuouring to serve and please him in newness of life; the things from which
thou must turn (O my soul) are thy sins, yea from all thy sins, great and
small, none being so great that they need to discourage thee, seeing they are
incomparably exceeded by Gods infinite mercies, and the All-sufficient merits
of thy Savior; nor any so small, that thou should neglect amendment, seeing
the least bring everlasting death, if they be not washed away with the blood of
Christ, who also dyed for them as well as for the greatest. Or if there be any
difference in thy conversion from thy sins (O my soul) it must be in leaving
those sins with greatest hatred and detestation, which thou have formerly
embraced with greatest love, seeing by them thou have most dishonored and
displeased thy God, and wounded thine own conscience. The other part of thy
conversion is, that thou turn unto the Lord, that thou may serve and please
him in newness of life; according to that of the Prophet, O Israel, if ye
return, return unto me, says the Lord: for it is not enough that thou cease
to be the servant of sin, unless thou become a servant of righteousness;
nor to be unblameable before men, unless thou be holy before God; nor to
abstain from evil, unless thou do good; nor to keep thy self from
mis-spending thy Lords Talent, unless thou do by use increase it to thy
Masters advantage. And as in thy returning there is a change in the object,
from (not some, but) all evil; not to some only, but all good; so if it be
sound and sincere, it is also to be plainly discerned in the subject or person
that returns, and in the change of all his faculties and actions. And
therefore if thou truly repentest (O my soul) there is a change in thy mind,
from the darkness of ignorance, to the light of knowledge; from error, to
truth; in thy conscience, from dead works, to purity; in thy will, refusing
that evil which formerly it embraced, and embracing that good which in time
past it rejected; in thy heart, from hardness to tenderness; from security
and impenitency, to true repentance; from the love of sin, to the love of God
and all goodness for Gods sake; from lothing of spiritual things, to hating
of carnal; and so in the rest of thy affections and passions. If thy
repentance be sincere, Ephesians. 4. 23, 24.
it begins inwardly in thee (my soul) and proceeds to the outward parts;
it begins in fervent desires, proceeds in good resolutions and earnest
endeavors, and shows both in our holy and righteous actions, throughout the
whole course of our lives and conuersations. And howsoever it is imperfect in
respect of degrees, seeing we can never sufficiently, whilst we live here,
bewail and forsake our sins, nor serve the Lord in holiness and
righteousness, in any such perfection as the Law requires; yet if thou do
truly repent (O my soul) there is a perfection of integrity, whereby thou
labourest to serve and please thy God in renouncing all sin, and embracing
all righteousness, and in the purifying of all thy powers and faculties,
outward and inward, from corruption to holiness. And these are the parts of
thy repentance (O my soul) containing in them the matter and form.

. Sect. 4 The final causes, subject, and properties of repentance, the
contraries unto it, and comparisons which illustrate it.
The final causes and ends of it, are first, that God may be glorified in the
acknowledgement of thy sins, and may be justified in his righteousness when
he judges, and magnified in his mercies, when being guilty of sin, and
condemned in thy self, yea by thy self, he pardons all thy sins, and
justifies thee in the righteousness and obedience of Jesus Christ. Secondly,
when out of the same grace and goodness he freeth thee from, not only the
guilt, but also from the punishment of all thy sins, his justice being
satisfied by Christ's sufferings and obedience. Thirdly, that being freed from
sin, and become the servant of righteousness, thou should glorify and
please God in the whole course of thy life, by mortifying thy sins, and
studying to serve him in thy new obedience. Finally, that thou may hereby be
assured of Gods favor in this life, and of everlasting happiness in the life
to come, and have the peace and comfort of both in thine own conscience. The
effects and fruits of thy repentance are the inward purity and sanctity of
thee (my soul) from the pollution of sin in all thy powers and faculties,
and thy exercise of these inward graces, in the duties of piety toward God, of
righteousness and charity toward thy neighbors, and of temperance and
sobriety toward thy self; and an hearty desire and earnest endeavor to please
thy God in all things, both in thought, word and deed, by conforming them in
obedience unto all his Commandments. The subject or person to whom it only
belongs, is the elect and faithful, the repentance of all others, being like
that of Cain, Esau, Ahab, Judas, and all hypocrites, false and counterfeit. The
subject in which this grace is exercised, is the whole man, and all the powers
and parts both of his soul and body; but principally it keeps its court of
residence, and shows it chief virtue and power in thee (my soul) and above
all other thy faculties in the change of thy mind and will, thine heart and
affections. The object of thy repentance is sin, and that complete
righteousness required in Gods Law, that being the thing from which thou
fleest; this, that unto which thou aspirest; that it which thou labourest to
mortify and kill; this, that unto which thou indeuourest to be more and more
quickened and revived. The properties and qualities of it, thou have before
seen in the several parts. The contraries unto it generally considered, are
impenitency, carnal security, hardness of heart, worldliness and
profaneness. In the parts of it, the contraries to humiliation and sorrow for
sin, are pride, out of an opinion of our own righteousness; for Christ came
not to call such Pharisaicall Iusticiaries, but sinners to repentance, and an
hard heart and seared conscience which cannot repent; and on the other hand,
worldly sorrow for carnal respects, which causes death, and hopeless sorrow,
which being void of faith, ends in despair, and so plungeth those which so
repent, with Cain, and Judas, into hellish condemnation. Now to what will thou
compare this grace of God, O my soul? It exceeds all legal virtues in
profit and necessity, especially to us who are imperfect in them, and is
exceeded of none, but of faith and love, the fountain of this stream, and
roots from which it springs, which if thou ioynest together, and entertainest
them like loving friends to live and lodge in thee, no misery (my soul) can
make thee miserable, no curse of the Law can hinder thy blessedness, no
imperfection of other virtues or duties, can keep thee from the fruition of
eternal happiness; whereas without these, all other blessings are accursed
unto thee, all shows of other graces false, counterfeit, and utterly
unprofitable. To what then may thou compare this excellent grace and gift of
the Spirit? It is like the waters of Jordan, which will purge thee from the
filthy leprosy of all thy sins, not by it own inherent virtue, but by the
power of Gods Word and promise, who has assured all that truly repent, of the
remission of their sins; and as it is a fruit and infallible sign of faith,
which assures thee that thou truly beleeuest, and art therefore purged from
all thy sins, in the precious blood of Christ. It is like the precious balm
of Gilead which is fit to cure all the sores of sin, though the head be
sick, and the whole heart faint; and though from the sole of the foot, Esa. 1.
5, 6, 16, 17.
to the crown of the head, there is no soundness in thee, but wounds, and
bruises, and putrefying sores, yet if thou will apply unto them this sovereign
salve, they shall be all healed, so that even thy crimson and scarlet sins
shall become white as snow and wool.

. Sect. 5 Of the kinds of repentance, ordinary and extraordinary.
And thus thou see (O my soul) the nature of true repentance, which
admits of no distribution into kinds, but yet thou may distinguish it into
some degrees. For either thou may consider it in the first acts of thy
conversion, when as thou did break from thy sins, by bewayling and
forsaking them, and turning unto thy God in new obedience; or else it is the
continuing of it, throughout the whole course of this life. For as thou art
never in this world perfectly cured of the sores of sin, but that they will
break out again, the inward corruption not thoroughly drawn out, still seeking
vent in some outward issue; so this plaster of repentance must continually be
applied and renewed, and be never quite neglected and thrown away, until by
death the cure be perfected. Now this repentance which thou must continue (O my
soul) even till by thy separation from thy beloved body, thou be freed from
that hated body of sinful corruption, is either ordinary, or extraordinary.
Thy ordinary repentance is that which thou must daily perform; for as thou
daily sinnest against thy good God, so thou must daily sorrow for thy sins,
be humbled in the sight and sense of them, hate and abhor them as conquered
rebels, who having gotten new strength, have given thee these foyles, subdue
and mortify them, and endeavor to please thy God in the contrary duties of his
service. Thy extraordinary repentance is either when by reason of thy sloth and
security thou have discontinued this exercise, and afterward do undertake
it afresh, being excited and moved hereunto by outward helps, the preaching of
the Word, afflictions, danger of being overtaken with some approaching evil,
extraordinary blessings, and such like; or by the inward motions of Gods holy
Spirit: or else when thou art overtaken for want of keeping the spiritual
watch of some grievous and unusual sin, whereby thou have made deep wounds
and fearful gashes into thy conscience. In both which respects thou must
double thy zeal and diligence, that thou may rise from whence thou art
fallen, redeem the lost time wherein thou have negligently intermitted this
holy exercise: bewail thine extraordinary sins, with extraordinary sorrow
and bitter grief, both in greater measure suitable to these greater sins, and
in a more vehement and powerful manner; hating these sins with more then
mortal hatred; driving out these cursed enemies which have given thee such
shameful foyles with all despite, and redoubling thy watch, that they may for
ever be kept out of thy coast, and never be able to surprise and overcome thee.
Finally, thy repentance (my soul) must be extraordinary, when thy God moves
thee unto it by any extraordinary occasion; as when thou art to perform some
duty of his service of great moment and importance; as the receiving of the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which requires extraordinary preparation and
examination; when thou humblest thy self in some solemn fast, public or
private, for the auerting of some imminent judgment, or deliverance from some
present evil; or when thou art to undertake some business for thy self, the
Church, or Commonwealth, no less weighty and necessary, then full of
difficulty and danger; then (my soul) is it high time for thee to renew and
redouble thy repentance, that thy sins which separate between thy God and
thee, may be removed, and not stop and hinder thee from receiving the
assistance of his grace and holy Spirit in these weighty employments. So also
when thou addressest thy self to thy God, to make suit for some blessings
which thou much desire, from which thy sins might hinder thee, and stop the
stream of his grace, that though it ouerflow to all others, yet thou shall
remain dry and barren: or for the remouall of some great afflictions, which if
thou continuest in thy sins, thou may justly fear will be continued upon
thee, till thy God, by redoubling thy stripes and smart, have made thee to
renew thy repentance and redouble thy sorrow. Finally, it is fit time thus to
repent, when thy God summoneth thee by sickness to appear before him, and
threateneth thee to bring thee before his Tribunal under the arrest of death;
then is there no more need (O my soul) to set thy house and state in order,
then thy self, and then is it fit time that thou should renew thy
repentance, with Ezechias, in an extraordinary manner, that thou may make
thine accounts ready, before thou art to render them unto thy Judge; and seeing
thou art much indebted, and have nothing to pay, thou must, whilst thou art
here, by renewing thy faith and repentance, sue out thy pardon, and get a
general acquittance for all thy debt, sealed with thy Saviors blood, that so
thou may go with joy and comfort, when thy Judge calls thee to make thine
appearance.

CAP. XXI.
Showing how we must work the former points upon our hearts and affections.

. Sect. 1 How our hearts are to be affected with fervent desires to practice
this duty of repentance.
ANd now (my soul) that thou have in thy understanding discoursed of the
chief points obseruable in this excellent grace of repentance, labor to work
what thou know, into thine heart and affections, and to bring it all to some
holy use, that thou may prepare these spiritual meats, not only to look
upon, for so thou may in this great plenty depart an hungered, and be never
the better in thy health, strength and good liking; but endeavor to apply them,
to taste their sweetness, to feed upon and digest them for thy nourishment.
Thou have discovered (my soul) excellent waters, which though they be bitter
in their own nature, yet the wood of thy Saviors Cross being cast into them
by the hand of faith, will make them to become sweet: Drink deeply of them (O
my soul) that thou may never again thirst after the pleasures of sin,
which may well glut thee, but will never satisfy thee, but the more thou
drinkest, the more thou thirstest; whereas these waters (my soul) will cure
this dropsy, and make thee thirst only after spiritual things, in which
there is great delight, seeing thou may here drink thy fill without
impeachment, yea with much improuement of thy health; or rather, because thou
can never be filled in this life, thou may ever thirst, and ever drink;
thirst without distemper, without grief; and drink with all spiritual
delight, seeing these waters satisfy without satiety. And as they are good for
thine inward thirst, so also for thy both outward and inward defilements of
sin. Wash thy self therefore, yea bathe and diue thy self in them, whereby
as thou shall be certainly assured that thou art washed and purged from the
guilt and punishment of all thy sins, in the precious Lauer and Fountain of
thy Saviors blood; so shall thou find these waters of repentance, notable
helps and means to cleanse thee from the corruption and filth of sin.
Drench but thy self in them (O my soul) and thou shall drown them; for
though to thee they are living waters, and help to preserve thee, yet they
will stifle and choke thy sinful corruptions, though (like the waters
appointed for the trial of Number. 3. 27, 28.
jealousy) they will make thee fruitful, yet they will cause thy sins to
rot and perish, working diversely upon diverse subjects. Worldly sorrow indeed
causes death, because it does not conioyne, but sever thee from Christ thy
life. It is a fruit of the flesh, the joy whereof is mortal, and therefore
much more must its grief needs be mortal. It looks not to heaven, but to
the earth, not drawing to God, but driving thee from him. It respects
punishment, and not sins, and lamenteth more the loss of earthly trifles,
then of Gods love and heavenly excellencies. And therefore when this
bitterness is thrust upon thee by thy corrupt flesh; thou have just cause to
cry out with the children of the Prophets, that there is death in the pot, and
sin in such sorrow, for which grief thou have just cause of further
grieuing. Mistake not this worldly sorrow (O my soul) for true repentance..
Let not these muddy tears come into thine eyes, which will but dim and dazzle
the sight of faith, so as it shall not be able to discern thy Savior. But
labor after that godly sorrow which will cause repentance not to be repented
of; which though it may seem unpleasant to thy carnal taste, yet thou shall
find it wholesome, though not so toothsome. If not delightful meat, yet at
least profitable physic, which by purging away the corrupt humors of sin,
will help to preserve thy spiritual health and life. Yea in truth (my soul)
thou shall, upon good experience, find this repentance not only good and
profitable, but also sweet and comfortable, causing thee to possess and enjoy
thy self with much peace and patience.

. Sect. 2 Motives to repent, taken from the Author and efficient causes of
this grace.
For who is the Author of it, but God himself, who with his sweetness
sweetens all things which he gives to his children? and though they be bitter
in themselves, yet tempering them with his love, he makes them to become
pleasant, turning our mourning into rejoicing, and raising out of the subject
of sorrow, matter of joy. It is a cup of Gods tempering, and therefore refuse
not to drinkt it; it must needs be good, coming from him, who being the chief
Goodness, is Author of all good. It is Gods gift (O my soul) and no natural
act in thine own power; and therefore when thou want it, sue unto him that
gives liberally to all that ask of him; and when thou have it, ascribe
nothing to thy self, but let him have the glory of his own gift. It is his
gift, and not in thine own power; take it then thankfully at his hand, whilst
in his acceptable time he offreth it, lest pulling it back for thine ungrateful
neglect, thou seek it too late and never find it. It is a gift of the
Spirit, which (like the wind) blows when and where it lists, and not at
thine appointment; spread thy sails (my soul) whilst this gale lasts, and
open the door of thine heart whilst the Spirit knocks. It is the gift of
grace, and not of merit, toward which thou have brought nothing as the cause,
but thy sins only as the occasion; and therefore as it is given freely, so
freely take it. It is the grace of God, which like the Sun with kindly heat,
does with the beams of his favor dissolve the clouds of grief, and causes
them to distill in repentant tears; and not the strong and cold winds of his
rigorous justice and terrible threats, which either blow them quite away, or
congeale them unto an Icy hardness (making thy tears whilst they are
dropping, like haile-stones, which will destroy thy fruits of obedience, rather
then cause them to grow and multiply. It is not a common, but a saving grace,
seeing to whomsoever God gives it, he gives them also salvation with it; and
therefore (my soul) if thou would have the one, refuse not the other, for
these gifts of grace must go together. It is an Evangelical gift, and not a
legal, which have such hard conditions, that they can seldom be obtained:
whereas the Gospel not only offers to give, but also inableth thee to
receive what it offers, and to perform what it requires. The strong wind,
thunder and earthquake of legal threatenings, do only prepare a way, but it
is the still voice of the Gospel which assuring thee by faith of Gods love
works it in thee. And therefore (my soul) despise not this Word of grace,
but whilst thy God speaks and allureth thee by his sweet promises to
repentance, hearken unto him, and harden Psalm. 75. 7, 8.
not thine heart. It is a gift of God, which thou returnest unto him again,
and thy self with it. Fear not, lest it shall be rejected, and thou with it,
because it is small and worthless, for thy God requires not perfection, but
truth, and that his gifts be not imbased by the mixture of thy hypocrisy. He
looks not to receive much where he gives but little, nor will reject any of
his own graces, as small and worthless, seeing though they be but of small
value as they are thine, yet from the Author and giver they have sufficient
worth and excellency, for which he will accept them. It is a gift which thy
God has freely given thee, but by and for his Son thy Savior. It came to
thee of free grace from God by Christ, but to him by purchase. Thou have it for
nothing save grateful acceptance, but thy Savior bought it at a dear rate,
even with the inestimable price of his precious Blood; nothing else could
procure thy pardon, without which there was no place to repentance; for never
would thou have returned to God, whom thou had incensed to wrath by thy
sins, had not Christ by that propitiatory Sacrifice reconciled thee and
wrought thy peace. Besides, so was thy rebellious heart hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin, unto more then an adamantine hardness, that nothing
but the Blood of the slain Goat, or innocent Lamb, could mollify and soften
it, that it might be fit to receive the impression of this saving grace, and
to melt and resolve in repentant tears. And therefore seeing thy Savior has
bought it at so dear a purchase, do not now ungratefully refuse it, when he
so graciously offers it unto thee of free gift. Especially, seeing he uses
such manifold and plentiful means to press it upon thee for thine own
inestimable benefit. For he sends daily his Ambassadors unto thee, to call
and inuit thee to repentance, by preaching unto thee the glad tidings of
reconciliation. He by them instructs thee in the right way wherein thou must
return, admonishes thee of thy errors, reprooueth thy transgressions and
wilful wanderings, comfort and incourageth thee against all difficulties and
oppositions, persuades thee by his gracious promises, terrifieth thee in thy
course of sinning with his severe threatenings, allureth thee by his manifold
blessings, discourageth thee in the way of sin, by his chastizements and
gentle corrections; all which outward means he presses upon thee, that they
may become effectual by the inward motions of his Spirit, drawing thee from
thy sins, and driving thee to God. O thrice ungrateful soul, if thou
suffer so great grace to be spent in vain! O more then miserable, if thou,
like the barren earth, drinkest so many gracious showers of heavenly blessings,
and bring forth no other fruits unto him Heb. 6. 6, 7, 8.
by whom thou art dressed, but thorns and briers, seeing then thou should
be rejected of God, and near unto his fearful curse! But I am persuaded
Verse. 9.
better things of thee (my soul) and things that accompany salvation, though I
have thus spoken. For though this and all other thy graces are but weak and
imperfect, yet are they in sincerity and truth. Acknowledge with thankfulness
Gods graces in thee, and thine own wants. Behold with sorrow thy
imperfections, and labor without discouragement after more perfection. He that
could begin this work of grace when it was wanting, can increase Phil. 1. 6.
it now it is begun. He that could raise thee who wast dead in thy sins, can
quicken thee more and more; seeing it is a far greater work Ephesians. 2. 1.
to give life to the dead, then health to the living.

. Sect. 3 Motives to persuade us to the renewing and perfecting of our
repentance, and first, our humiliation and unfeigned sorrow for sin.
Rest not then thy self (O my soul) in some first beginnings of this work,
but go unto him that is both able and willing to finish it. Content not thy
self in some small degrees, seeing that is no true grace which stands at a
stay, and tends not toward perfection. Thou have already repented, but let
not that suffice thee. He seems to repent of his repentance, that does not
renew it again and again. Do not cease to sorrow, till thou ceasest to
sin. Never leave striking at this many-headed monster, whilst any one
remains. If thou willingly suffer any one to live, they will multiply, and
such mortal enemies they are unto thee, that their life will be thy death. God
begun this work, and enjoined thee to continue it; give it not over, till he
call thee from it to pay thee thy wages. Mourn for thy sins, till he come
and wipe away the tears from thine eyes, and with thy sins take away thy
sorrows: and think not that it is time to cease amending, till thou come
to perfection, and art made complete both in holiness and in happiness.
Practice repentance (O my soul) not by patches and pieces, but in both the
parts jointly together. Repent and amend. Sorrow for thy sins, and withal
forsake them. For he that lamenteth his sins, and indeuoureth not to leave
them, does it not out of hatred, but of love, which makes him to grieve,
because fear of Gods Judgments make him think of their parting. But first,
humble thy self (my soul) in the sight and sense of thy sins, that God may
exalt thee in his due time. Humble thy self thoroughly with unfeigned sorrow and
bitter grief; for the deeper thou layest the foundation of thy repentance, the
more substantial shall thou find thy building. Thy sins are many and
grievous; and great sins would have great sorrow. Thy God, whom thou have
offended and dishonored, is not only glorious and full of Majesty; but
infinitely gracious, and of abundant mercy. Yea, thou (my soul) have not only
seen and tasted how good thy God is, but have drunk deep draughts out of the
fountain of his bounty. He has given thee thy being, and preserved thee in
it; he has multiplied his blessings upon thee temporal and spiritual, and is
the Author and giver of all the good which thou inioyest or expectest. And
which is first of all and above all, he has loved thee, unworthy, sinful,
rebellious soul, before thou could love him, yea, so loved thee, that he
has given his only begotten and best beloved Son, that by his death thou
might live. Admire this infinite love (O my soul) and love thy God again
as much as thou can, and be sorry thou can love him no better. Love him who
is most worthy in himself, and best deserves it of thee, which if thou truly
do, thou can not but lament thy sins with bitter grief, whereby thou
have displeased him who so loves thee, and whom thou so love. Look also
upon thy Savior, whom by thy sins thou have pierced, and lament thy sins
which have been the causes of his sufferings, as a man mourns for his son,
and be sorry for them, as one is sorry for his first borne. It is not so much
Judas that betrayed him, nor the Scribes and Pharisees that accused him, nor
Pilate that condemned him, nor the Soldiers that crucified him, nor the devil
himself that set them all on work, as thy sins delivering him into their
hands, that have been the chief causes of his death. These, these (my soul)
were the whips that scourged his innocent body, the nails that fastened him to
the Cross, the spear which pierced his blessed side and heart. Mourn then
and lament thy sins (O my soul) whereby thou have caused him to be condemned
that came to justify thee; to be killed, that came to save thee; to be put to
a cursed death, who being the Lord of life, was content to die, that he might
Ephesians. 2. 3.
give unto thee life and happiness, that wast dead in thy sins, and liable to
Gods wrath as well as others. Think not much (my soul) to shead tears for
thy sins, seeing thy Savior was content to shead his blood for them; nor that
it is too much trouble to be a little grieved in the sight and sense of their
burden, and thy heavenly Fathers displeasure, seeing Christ's innocent soul
was troubled for them, and heavy unto the death, yea, was so Mat. 26. 38.
oppressed with their weight, and his Fathers wrath, that it forced out from
his body a bloody sweat, and from his distressed and afflicted soul, that
lamentable complaint, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? Consider also
(O my soul) how often thou have vexed and grieved the good Spirit of God
dwelling in thee, and made him weary of his lodging, by polluting it with thy
sins. How often thou have tired this peaceable Ghest by contending with him,
and by not only resisting and quenching his good motions which he has put
into thee, but also by giving way and entertainment unto the contrary
suggestions of Satan and thine own sinful flesh. And let this grieve thee (my
soul) that thou should give such a kind Ghest so unkind a welcome, that
thou should weary him that was sent by thy Savior to refresh thee, grieve
him that came to be thy Comforter, and contend and wrangle with him who is the
Author of all thy peace.

. Sect. 4 Motives persuading to repentance and amondment of life.
But content not thy self (O my soul) to have sorrowed for thy sins,
unless thou also leave and forsake them, without which thy sorrow is false and
hypocritical. For these bitter medicines have (if they be right) a purging
property, and little good will they do thee, if they distaste thy palate with
the bitter vpbraidings of thy sins, but do not purge thee from these corrupt
humors. Yea in truth, if thy sins be unpleasant to thy taste, and like gall
in thy mouth, thou can not choose but spit them out. If they be grievous unto
thee, as Hagar to her mistress, thou will never be at quiet till thou have
enforced them to depart. Or if through the strength of thy corrupt nature, thou
can not quite remove them from dwelling with thee, they will be as scourges
to thy sides, and thorns in thine Ios. 23. 13.
eyes, which will make thee desire and endeavor to be rid of such cumbrous
neighbors, to make continual war against them, and to watch all good
opportunities of rooting them out; if not altogether, yet at least, by degrees.
For how can two dwell peaceably together, unless they be agreed? who feels
sin (with Paul) like a thorn in the flesh, and will not pull it out? Amos 3.
3.
or if he cannot himself, who will not with him cry out for help; Wretched
man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death? Yea, in truth (my
soul) the same reasons which make thee truly to lament for thy sins, will
make thee as willing to forsake them. For if thou love God, who so loves
thee, thou must needs hate and forsake that which he abhors. If thine heart
be truly and thoroughly warmed with the beams of his love, brightly shining in
that inestimable gift of his only begotten and dearly Beloved, thou can not
think much for his sake to offer thy sins to be killed and mortified, which
thou have just cause above all things to hate, (for if thou willingly let
them escape, after God has designed them to death, thy life must go for
theirs) seeing for thy sake he was content to give the Son of his love to be
killed and crucified, that by his death thou might live. If thou did (as
thou ought) (my soul) esteem thy God thy dearest and greatest friend, thou
would esteem it but a small matter, to leave for his sake thy greatest
enemy. Consider also (my soul) that thy Savior has shed his precious Blood
to wash away thy sins, not only in respect of their guilt and punishment,
but also of their filth and corruption; and will thou suffer this uncleanness
of sin still to stick unto thee, and so cause his blood to be spilt in
vain? He was content for a time to be forsaken in his own sense of his
heavenly Father, whom to enjoy, was the life; and to be severed from him, the
death of his soul, that he might make an utter separation between thee and thy
sins; and will thou not for his sake part with them (my soul) especially
considering, that if thou cleauest unto them, they will be a partition wall to
separate thee from thy God? Finally, the holy Spirit, whom thou have
entertained for thy Ghest to lodge in thee, may move thee for his sake to
forsake thy sins. For he being holy, and delighting in purity, cannot endure
to have sin for an inmate, where he is a Ghest; but will depart in
discontent, if he be annoyed with such a loathsome neighbor. Now as there is
no society so sweet and comfortable as this Communion of the holy Ghost, seeing
he comes not alone, but accompanied with all sanctifying and saving graces,
with peace that passes all understanding, peace with God, and peace of a good
conscience, with comforts which uphold us in all discontents, with joy
unspeakable and glorious, which cannot be imbittered with any grief: so
there is no solitude so uncomfortable, as when thou art left and forsaken of
the Comforter himself, because to enjoy his company, thou can not be
contented to leave thy sins. Turn therefore from thy sins (O my soul) but
withal turn to thy God. Cease from evil, and learn to do well; and being
freed from the base service of sin, become now the servant of righteousness.
The beginning of thy misery, was thy turning from God; for how could thou be
but miserable and accursed, when thou did leave him, in whose fruition
consists thy chief happiness? how could thou but be in palpable
darkness, when the beams of his favor did not shine upon thee, who is thine
only Light? How could thou be but evil and wicked, when thou did
forsake him who is the chief Goodness? And the beginning of thy happiness
is, when thou returnest unto him. When thou wentest from him with the
Prodigal, thou having misspent the rich portion of his graces, becamest so
poor and beggarly, that to satisfy thine hunger, thou wast feign to feed with
swinish worldlings, upon the base husks of earthly vanities; but upon thy
returning to him, he will meet thee when thou art far off, receive thee
into wonted favor, put on thee the best garment, kill for thee the fat Calfe,
and feast thee at his own Table with great joy. When thou wentst from him like
a wandering sheep, in losing thy Shepherd, thou did lose thy self, stray in
the deserts of sin, and being entangled in the briers of Satan's tentations,
wast a ready and easy prey to this ravenous Wolf. But when thy great and good
Shepherd had sought and found thee, and thou hearing his voice, did desire
to come out of this woeful plight, he took thee upon his blessed shoulders,
when thou wast not able to go, brought thee back to his sheepefold, and has
caused thee to feed in pleasant pastures by the still Psalm. 23. 2.
waters. Return then unto thy God (O my soul) love him who has been so good
unto thee, with all thine heart, and serve him with all thy might. And because
thou have misspent many of thy good hours in the service of sin and Satan,
without gain, yea to thy loss; redeem this Ephesians. 4. 16.
lost time, by redoubling thy diligence for the time to come. His service is
perfect liberty, and not to be in it, is to be in the worst bondage. All his
servants are his sons, yea heirs of his Kingdom, and co-heires with Christ.
It is commonly said, that there is no service to the service of a King. Yes (my
soul) behold a service much more excellent, much more profitable; the service
of the King of kings; For he makes truly (as it is said hyperbolically of
Tire Merchants) all his servants Kings, not of an Esa. 23. 8.
earthly, but of an heavenly; not of a transitory, but of an everlasting
Kingdom. Serve then with cheerfulness (O my soul) such a bountiful Master,
who rewards such simple and short service, with such large and lasting wages.
Yea, be sorry that thou have returned no sooner into his service, for which
alone thou wast created and redeemed, and repent that thou have no sooner
repented. Glorify God in acknowledging thy errors and wanderings. Glorify his
Justice which has punished thy sins in Christ, corrected them in thee.
Glorify him in his infinite mercies, who to spare thee has punished his best
Beloved. Finally, as thou have dishonored him by thy sins, so glorify him
by thy new obedience, and bring forth fruits worthy amendment of life. And do
it with comfort and cheerfulness (O my soul) seeing so gracious is thy good
God, that he has coupled his glory and thy salvation inseparably together, so
as thou can not seek the one, but thou must find the other; thou can use
no means to glorify him, but by the same thou shall attain unto glory, and
make thine own calling and election sure. Bring forth fruits of repentance 2.
Pet. 5. 5, 10.
in the duties of piety toward God, of righteousness and mercy toward thy
neighbors, of temperance and sobriety toward thy self.

. Sect. 5 Motives to bring forth the fruits of repentance in all the parts
thereof.
Cleanse thy self inwardly from all relics of sinful corruption; furnish thy
self thoroughly with those chief riches of sanctifying graces, and bring 2.
Cor. 7. 11, 12.
forth plentiful fruits of them in thy good works, that thou may please
thy God in all things, and cause him to be glorified, when as thy light of a
godly life shall shine before men. But especially (my soul) bring forth in the
practice of thy repentance, those fruits which the holy Apostle commends unto
thee. First, take care to have this assurance, that thy 1. Care.
sins are pardoned, and thou freed from the guilt, punishment, and corruption
of them, and that being thus once cleansed in thy justification, thou may
continue it in thy sanctification, not suffering sin again to reign Romans 6.
12.
in thy mortal body, that thou should obey it in the lusts thereof, nor to
pollute and defile thee again with the filth of it, after thou art thus
pardoned and purged; but contrariwise, that thou serve God in performing of all
contrary duties which he requires, in that manner as he has prescribed. And
this thy care (my soul) must extend, not only to the things themselves, but to
the means and occasions of them, for the avoiding of the one, and embracing of
the other. Clear often thy self (my soul) seeing 2. Clearing.
thou often failest of thy duty, by pleading thy pardon purchased by Christ,
and set even all accounts between thy God and thee, by showing that the
handwriting of Ordinances is cancelled and nailed to his Cross, and that thou
have a general acquittance from thy Lord and Master sealed with Christ's Blood.
Yet slight it not over as a light matter (O my soul) that thou have so much
offended, though thy pardon has freed thee from all peril, but have an holy
indignation against thy self and thy sins, 3. Indignation.
that thou should by them, like an ungrateful wretch, displease and
dishonor so gracious a God, who of his mere mercy has freely forgiven thee;
yea, and let this for the time to come set thee so far at odds with them,
that thou will by no means, nor upon any terms, entertain with them any
familiarity and acquaintance. And yet because thou art frail 4. Fear.
and full of infirmity, and thy enemies many and mighty, thou apt and easy to
be overtaken and overcome, and they as ready to surprise thee, therefore (my
soul) whilst thou stand, take heed of falling, be never secure, 1. Cor.
10. 12.
which will cause negligence, but nourish ever in thee a godly fear of being
surprised and foiled, which will make thee watchful, and to stand always upon
thy guard. And seeing thou can not stand in thine own strength, thou must
also entertain an holy desire after Gods grace and assistance 5. Desire.
of his holy Spirit, whereby thou may be enabled to withstand tentations, and
to perform all duties of Gods service daily in more and more perfection. The
which thy desires must not be cold and remiss, but must be backed and
strengthened with fervent zeal, which must show it self in 6. Zeal.
opposing courageously all the means that hinder thee in thy Christian course;
for so many blocks lie in this way, so many enemies that encounter thee, and
labor might and maine to hinder thy proceedings, that thou can not overcome
them without much courage and resolution, nor amend thy life, unless thou be
zealous. Finally (my soul) seeing notwithstanding Apoc. 3. 19.
all thy zeal and resolution, thou art often foiled with that secret Traitor
and dangerous Rebel, which thou nourishest in thine own bosom; do not
carelessly and cowardly put up all these wrongs and indignities, but after thou
have armed thy self strongly against this traiterous enemy, set upon him,
foil him as he has foiled thee, and take sharp revenge upon him, and wound
him to the death with all his sinful lusts. 7. Revenge.
Yea, if thou find him strong in resistance, abridge thy self in the use of
things in their own nature indifferent, which thine enemy has made by their
abuse, snares unto thee, and occasions of sin; rather then give him any
advantage by using thy liberty, and choose rather to use moderate abstinence,
then that such an enemy should get any strength by feeding with thee.

CAP. XXII.
Of diverse special means whereby the point meditated is wrought upon the
heart and affections.

. Sect. 1 Of Examination.
ANd now (my soul) that thou see what is required in this duty of
repentance, examine thy self how thou have performed it. Have thou had a true
and through sight and sense of thy natural impotency and auersenesse to this
duty; of thy security, impenitency and hardness of heart, and have thou had
fervent desires to be freed from them? Have thou sought and sued to thy God,
the Author and fountain of this grace, desiring the assistance of his holy
Spirit, for the suppling and softening of thy hard and stony heart, that it
might relent and resolve into the tears of unfeigned repentance? And have thou
by faith applied unto thee the blood of Christ, for the working of thine heart
to sound humiliation and contrition? Have thou been careful, as thou ought,
in using all those good means which thy God has given thee, for the
effectual working of this grace in thy heart? Have thou diligently heard the
Word of God, and applied it unto thy self for this end, the threatenings of the
Law for thy humiliation, and the sweet and gracious promises of the Gospel,
assuring thee of the pardon of thy sins, and of Gods love and favor, that
thou might love God again, who has so loved thee, and forgiven thee so
great a debt, and testify this love by bewailing thy sins, whereby thou have
displeased so gracious a Father? Has Gods mercy, patience and long-suffering
drawn thee to repentance, and have thou been offended with thy self, because
thou have offended thy God, who has multiplied upon thee so many testimonies
of his love? Have thou made right use of Gods blessings and benefits, to be
made thereby more careful to please him; and of his chastisements and fatherly
corrections, to be made thereby more fearful to offend him? Has thy sorrow
in any good measure been suitable to thy sins, and have thou more bewailed thy
sins then the punishment, the guilt then the smart; and in this respect
chiefly, because thou have by them dishonored thy God, rather then for the
miseries which they have brought upon thy self? Have thou bewailed all thy
sins, and those most of all whereunto thy corrupt nature is most inclined;
and not only thy sins of gross commission, but also thy sins of omission,
and the wants and imperfections of thy best actions? Have thou been affected
with Gods Judgments, and with those most of all which are spiritual, and
touch thee rather then thy sinful flesh? Has the smart of thy sores been
such, that nothing would ease them but the balm of Gilead, the blood of
Christ, applied by faith, and have carnal sports rather increased then abated
thy grief? Have thou so washed thy self in the waters of repentance, as that
thou have thereby been cleansed from thy Esa. 1. 16.
sins? and have thou, being freed from sin, become the servant of
righteousness? Have thou been earnest in thy repentance, and taken occasion
from thy former negligence and unprofitableness, to redeem thy lost time, by
redoubling thy diligence in Gods service? Have thou found plentiful fruits in
thee, worthy repentance and amendment of life? And as thou have increased in
years, have thou increased in fruitfulness, bringing forth most in thine
older age? Have thou found in thee those special fruits of care, clearing,
indignation, fear, desire, zeal and holy revenge, before spoken of?

. Sect. 2 Of Confession.
Alas (my soul) how defective have thou been in all these things? Alas (my
God) how should I, without much shame and confusion of face look upon thee,
seeing when I come to pay that debt and duty which I owe thee, my silver is
turned into dross, my medicine is become a poison, Esa. 1. 22.
my repentance, which should be the salve for my other sins, is so full of
wants and imperfections, that it self needs to be repented of? and if this
bath wherein I should wash my polluted self, were not it self bathed and
cleansed in a pured fountain, the precious blood of Jesus Christ, so foul it
is through the filth of my corruptions, that it would but the more defile me,
and make me loathsome in thy sight. It is true (my God) and I acknowledge it to
thy glory, that through thy grace I have repented, and do desire to repent
still more and more. And that small measure which I have received, and which I
return unto thee, is not false and counterfeit, but in sincerity and truth But
(alas my Lord) it is so maimed with imperfections, and defiled with
corruptions, that it is utterly unworthy thine acceptance. And seeing thou have
forbidden in thy Law that any sacrifices should be offered unto thee, which
were maimed or unclean, how should I presume to offer this sacrifice of my
sighs and tears which are so imperfect and defiled, were it not that thou
have told me, that the sacrifice wherein thou chiefly delightest, is a broken
heart, and humble and contrite spirit? And because thy perfection can endure no
imperfection, thou have appointed another sacrifice pure and perfect, even that
which thy dear Son has offered unto thee upon the Cross, to cleanse and
cover the impurity and imperfection of mine, that it may be acceptable in thy
sight. These waters of thy grace (O my God) were pure and perfect, as they came
from thee the Fountain of all purity and perfection; but alas, they are now
defiled by running through the polluted channel of my filthy heart. But being
again cleansed by running through the pure Fountain of my Saviors blood, they
are restored to their purity, and fit for thine acceptance. From my self
immediately I dare not offer unto thee my repentance; for it is wholly stained
and defiled with my corruption, and mingled with much impenitency, carnal
security and hardness of heart. And though it be most imperfect, yet have I
been too too slothful in using any of those good means whereby I might attain
unto more perfection; or when I have used them, it has been so formally and
negligently, that they have had little efficacy to work this grace in me. Thy
legal threatenings have not humbled me, thy Evangelical promises have little
affected me, the good motions of thy Spirit have been quenched in me, thy
blessings and benefits have not allured me, thy chastisements and corrections
have not drawn me; but notwithstanding all these helps, I have continued in
my sins with much impenitency, or labored to come out of them with much
weakness. My sorrow for sin has been very small, and joined with much
hardness of heart; my desires of amendment exceeding feeble and faint; my
resolutions weak and unconstant, and my actions and endeavors impotent and
imperfect, and when to will is present with me, I find no power to Romans 7.
perform that which is good, so that I cannot do the good I would, nor leave
undone the evil I would not.

. Sect. 3 Of Complaint.
Alas (my soul) how far has thy carnal security prevailed with thee? How
has it rocked thee in such a deep slumber, that thou have little or no sense
of thy sloth, but when thou art asleep, dreamest that thou art waking? How is
thine heart hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, that it is scarce
sensible of its own hardness? yea when thou do discern it, how art thou
hampred and fettered with the g^ues of thy corruption, that thou have neither
power nor will to better thine estate? Repentance is the means of curing thine
infirmities and sicknesses of sins. But thou fear the medicine, more then
the disease, and neglectest, or formally use all good means whereby it might
be obtained and applied. Thou think no care or cost too much for the
compassing of worldly vanities, and thou can in pursuing them, keep thy
desires within no bounds, but the more thou drinkest, the more thou thirstest.
But how soon art thou tired in working thy heart to sorrow for thy sins; and
how little of this do thou think enough? In bodily smart and worldly grief
for the loss of things little to be esteemed, how many arguments of comforts
(as it were) bridles, need thou to curb in, and moderate thy sensual
sorrows? and yet how often do they get head, and (as it were) catching the
bridle between the teeth, carry thee away in a full carreer? But how many
strong motives and forcible reasons (as it were) sharp spurs in thy sides,
do thou need, to make thee sorrow for thy sins? and how soon, like a dull
hackney, art thou tired in this unusual way, so that no spurs nor stripes
will make thee mend thy pace? How cold and quiet is thy hatred against thy
sins? and upon what easy terms and small submission art thou content to
let them live, when the Lord has given them into thy power, and put the sword
of the Spirit into thy hands wherewith thou might slay them? How little have
thou profited in the amendment of thy life? how small and insensible are thy
proceedings in the ways of godliness? and after long time spent, and many means
used, how small is thy progress, and how near art thou still to the place
from whence thou did sit out? How faint are thy desires (O slothful soul)
after good things? How far from earnest longings which break the heart, and
from hungring and thirsting, which are impatient of delay, and never at quiet
till they be satisfied? How often do thou fail in thy good resolutions, and
how seldom do thou bring them to any good effect? How easily art thou
discouraged in thy best endeavors, desisting, or at least often intermitting
them, before thou bring them to any perfection? And yet this is all thou
can do toward that perfect obedience which the Law requires; and all that
thy God in the Gospel does require of thee. Ungrateful soul, if thou do
not answer his demands; when having done so much for thee, he desires, in
lieu of all, to have so little returned unto him.

. Sect. 4 A hearty wish to have all wants supplied. Jer. 9. 1.
O that thou could perform this duty in that manner and measure which thy
God requires! O that thy head were a fountain of tears, that thou might
with David cause thy bed to swim, and water thy Psalm. 6. 6.
couch with them; and with Jeremy, weep day and night for thine own sins,
and the sins of thy people. O that God would smite thy hard heart, as he
caused Moses sometime to smite the Rock, that there might gush out of it
tears of unfeigned repentance! O that I could thoroughly waken my self out of my
slumber of security, that continually expecting my Judge, I might prepare my
self for his coming, and lament my sins, as though it were the last day of my
life! O that I could be more displeased with my self, because my sins no
more displease me, and lament the hardness of my heart, because I can no more
heartily bewail them! How should I inwardly rejoice in this sorrow! How should
I have more just cause of delight in bathing my self in these floods, then
Naaman had, when washing in lordan, he perceived himself cleansed from his
Leprosy! How should these tears be my meat and drink, and more refresh me
then my corporal food! O that turning from my sins with implacable hatred, I
could return to my God with all feruency of affection, and that I could
express and approve my love unto him who has so loved me, by bringing forth
plentiful fruits of new obedience! O that my Psalm. 119. 5.
ways were so directed, that I might keep his Statutes! O that thou could
(my soul) set thy self perfectly to seek and serve him, and that thou
might never err from the ways of his Commandments! O that it were thy
meat and drink to do the will of thy heavenly Father; and that thou could
love it better then thy daintiest food! O that thou could do Gods will in
earth, as the blessed Angels do it in heaven, with all joy and cheerfulness,
speed and diligence! But alas, so impotent thou art in thine own strength,
that thou art altogether unable in thy self to perform this duty in any such
manner or measure as thou desire.

. Sect. 5 Acknowledgement of impotency.
Thou see thy sores, and feel their smart, but have no skill to cure or
ease them. Thou are sensible of thy defects, but art so poor and beggarly that
thou can not supply them. Yea, thou art within the sight of the waters which
have virtue in them to cure thy lamenesse, and lie desolate bemoning thy
misery, but art so impotent that thou can not step into them. Thou see and
acknowledgest that thy sorrow for sin is too too small, and it grieueth thee
that thou can be no more grieved, but have no more ability to draw from thy
head plenty of tears, or from thy heart unfeigned sighs and groans for thy
sins, then to command the clouds to rain, or the winds to blow. Thou see
the miseries and dangers which attend upon thy carnal security, but can not
rowze thy self up out of this dead slumber. Thou feel the mischiefs of an
hard heart, but art not able by any means of thine own to supple and soften
it. Many defects and imperfections there are in thy new obedience, but thou
have no ability to supply the one, or amend the other. Rest not therefore (my
soul) upon thine own strength, which will fail thee in this, as well as in
all things else, of any weight or worth, but flee unto him that is both able
and willing to pardon thy imperfections and wants, and also to supply them. Cry
unto him (O my soul) who is ready and All-sufficient to hear and help thee.
Lift up thy heart unto him, and say:

. Sect. 6 Petition.
O thou, who art alone able to perfect that good work of repentance which thy
self have begun, amend in it what is amiss, and supply all that wherein it is
defective. I have desired to turn unto thee by unfeigned repentance, but my
corrupt flesh opposes me in this work, so as I can bring it to little effect;
put to thy helping hand, and supply by thy Spirit what is wanting in me. The
relics of my corruption do still remain in me, and pull me back as I am
returning unto thee; but thou who have deposed them from their regency, and
weakened them in their full strength, can deliver me fully from their power
and tyranny, and preserve me from the danger of those secret ambushments, out
of which these scattered forces, upon all advantages do assault me. My carnal
security opposes my repentance, and makes me apt to slumber in my sins; but
thou can awake me out of this sleep, who was able to rowze me out of the
sleep of death. My heart is hard, and I bewail great sins with small
sorrow; but if thou finite this stony rock, there will issue from it, as from
a fountain, streams of repentant tears. I am now slow and dull in returning
unto thee, by bringing forth the fruits of new obedience; but I shall be able
to better my speed, and to run the way of thy Commandments, when thou shall
Psalm. 119. 37.
enlarge my heart. O thou therefore who chiefly delightest in the sacrifice of
an humble heart, and contrite spirit, create in me a soft and tender heart, and
renew in me a right spirit. Frame me according to thine own will, that thou
may delight in me, and dwell with me; yea, according to thine own covenant,
for thou have promised to give me a new heart, and a new Ezekiel. 11. 19. and 36.
26.
spirit, and that thou will take away from me my stony heart, and give unto me
an heart of flesh. Thou art glorified in me, when I bring forth much fruits of
Job. 15. 8.
new obedience. O be not wanting unto thine own glory, by suffering me to be
defective in fruitfulness; but after I have brought forth some, purge me
again and again, that I still bringing forth more fruits, thou may be more
glorified.

. Sect. 7 Inforcement.
Yea Lord, my wants are not small, and therefore my suit must not be slight. I
must still wrestle with thee by my prayers and strong cries, and not let thee
depart, without a blessing. I am weak to prevail, but I have thy truth to
support me, who have promised that I shall obtain, if I follow Luke 18. 1. 8.
my suit without fainting. O then make good thy word unto thy servant, Psalm.
119.
wherein thou have made me to put my trust: Give me a melting heart, which will
relent and resolve easily into tears of repentance. I am much defiled with the
filthiness of my sins, and a little washing will not make me clean; Purge
me thoroughly therefore (O my God) and multiply my washings, first and chiefly in
the blood of Christ, which will cleanse me from the ingrained guilt of my
crimson and scarlet sins; and wash me in the lauer of Regeneration, and in
the waters of unfeigned repentance, which will, by virtue of the former washing,
help to purge me from the filth of my corruptions. Turn me, O turn me unto
thee (my God) and Lam. 5. 21. Cant. 1. 3.
so shall I be turned; draw me, and I will run after thee. Rectify and
fructify my more then ordinary barrenness, with the extraordinary showers of
thy grace, and warm my heart with the beams of thy love, that whatsoever good
seed of thy Word shall fall into it, may take deep root, and bring forth
plentiful fruits of holiness and righteousness; that as I have heretofore,
more then many others, dishonored thee by my sins, so also I may now
glorify thee in some good degree, by bringing forth, in more then an ordinary
manner and measure, plentiful fruits of new obedience.

. Sect. 8 Confidence.
And now comfort thy self (O my soul) for thy God has granted what thou have
so fervently craved. Yea, it is the end why he would have thee to ask,
because he has a desire to give, and that by discovering thy beggary and
poverty, he might take occasion to discover the riches of his bounty. He that
has enlarged thine heart with these fervent desires, has done it purposely to
this end, that he may fill it, and satisfy them. Thou could not so much as
ask this grace of repentance, if the Spirit Romans 8. 26.
of God did not help thine infirmities, and enable thee to pray with sighs
and groans which cannot be uttered; and how can thy God reject that prayer
which his Spirit inditeth, and is made according to his own will? Yea, be
confident, my soul, for thou can receive no repulse in this suit; seeing he
himself has commanded thee to ask it, and promised to give it. He, who is
true of his promise, and omnipotent in performance, has bound himself by his
gracious Covenant, that he will take away thy stony heart, and give thee an
heart of flesh; that thou shall look upon Zacb. 12. 10.
him whom thou have pierced, and shall mourn for him, as a man mourns for
his only son, and be in bitterness for him, as one is in bitterness for
his firstborne. That he will write also his Law in thine heart, that loving and
obeying Jer. 31. 33. and 32. 42.
it, thou may never depart from him. And his Word is yea and Amen; his
promises as good as present payment. Yet (my soul) to help thy weakness, he
has given unto thee already some first beginnings of repentance, Phil. 1. 6.
Romans 11. 29.
as an earnest of the rest that yet is wanting. He has begun this work of
grace in thee, and therefore (his gifts being without repentance) he will
surely perfect it. Wait upon him then (O my soul) by faith, yea, wait upon
him, not only with patience, but also with joy and comfort; for he that has
promised, will come, and will not tarry, and will Habak. 2. 3.
work in thine heart such sorrow for thy sins, as he himself shall accept
as sufficient; and cause thee to bring forth such plentiful fruits of new
obedience, as shall glorify him, and seal up in thine heart the assurance of
thine own election and salvation.

. Sect. 9 Congratulation and thanksgiving.
Thrice happy then (my soul) art thou now in thy God, who wast in in thy self
wretched and miserable: for he has not only made with thee the Covenant of
grace, wherein he has assured thee of the pardon of thy sins, and of his
favor, in which consists thy life and blessedness, but also has enabled
thee to perform the condition, of faith and repentance, whereby thou art
assured, that thou have thy part and interest in all his promises. Rejoice
therefore in the Lord, and again, rejoice. Praise and Phil. 4. 4.
magnify his great and glorious Name, who has been so good and gracious unto
thee. Thou wast in woeful misery by reason of thy sins, and the punishments
due unto them, but he has delivered and made thee happy, and has both
offered unto thee joy and blessedness, and also the means whereby thou may
attain unto it. He has showed unto thee the way of life, and has given unto
thee both will and ability to walk in it. What will thou now return unto him
(O my soul) for all the Psalm. 116. 11.
good that he has done unto thee? Yea, what can thou return that is worth
acceptance, but that which thou have received from this fountain of all
goodness? yet though he has given all unto thee, something there is which he
will be pleased to receive from thee, as though it were thy gift, even the
sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Nothing else can thou give but this
free will offering; nothing else does he require, who is so absolute in all
perfection, that he needs nothing. A fit oblation (my soul) from such a
child to such a Father; from so mean and poor a subject, to so rich and high
a Sovereign. Take then into thine hand the Cup of salvation, Psalm. 116. 12.
and 150. 2.
and praise him who is so worthy to be praised. Praise him in his noble acts,
praise him according to his excellent greatness. Praise him in his power and
truth; praise him for all his grace and goodness. Bless and magnify him for
all his former benefits, and his Christ, through whom they are all conferred
upon thee. And especially, as by present occasion thou art bound, for that he
has given unto thee the grace of repentance, and renewed and increased it by
this present exercise, graciously assisting and inabling thee by his holy
Spirit to bring it to good issue. Praise therefore the Lord (O my soul) Psalm.
103. 1.
and all that is within me, praise his holy Name. And now with these praises,
offer and recommend thy self into the hands of thy gracious God and faithful
Savior, who is all-sufficient to keep thee unto the end, and in the end. Thou
art not worthy (worthless soul) his receiving and owning, but so much the
rather offer thy self unto him who is able to make thee worthy. Deuote and
consecrate thy self wholly unto his service, and resolve to glorify and
please him in all things for the time to come. And because thy resolutions are
weak, thy power small, and thy best endeavors full of imperfections, make thy
service as acceptable as thou can, by offering thine heart with it, and doing
all that thou can do, willingly and cheerfully. Desire the assistance of his
good Spirit, to direct and guide, rule and overrule thee in all thy thoughts
and desires, words, and works, that they may in some measure answer unto thy
resolutions, and be pleasing and acceptable in his sight. Especially desire
his help, that the practice of thy repentance may be suitable to thy
Meditations, in the whole course of thy life; that more and more sorrowing for
thy sins, thou may have daily more cause to rejoice in the assurance of
his love, and thine own salvation, and that turning from them, and returning
to thy God, thou may more and more glorify him, by bringing forth better
and more fruits of new obedience. And now return unto thy rest (O my soul)
for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee. Repose thy self securely under
the shadow of Psalm. 116. 7.
his wings who is able to defend thee, and to cause thee in the midst of
garboyles and desperate dangers, to dvvell in safety. God is thy refuge and
Psalm. 4. 8.
strength, a very present help in trouble. He has made thee to hear joy and
gladness, that the bones which he had broken might rejoice. Thou did sow in
tears, Psalm. 46. 1.
but he has caused thee to reap in joy. Thou did go forth weeping, bearing
Psalm. 126. 5, 6.
precious seed, but thou art come again rejoicing, bringing thy sheaues with
thee. Bless therefore the Lord, all his works, in all places of his dominion.
Bless the Psalm. 103. 22.
Lord, O my soul.

CAP. XXIII.
Of the third private means of a godly life, which is consideration and
examination of our estate.

. Sect. 1 How consideration and examination differ.
THe third private means of a godly life, is consideration and examination,
both which are in truth but branches of Meditation. Yea the former, if we take
it in the largest extent, differs little or nothing from it, seeing we may be
said either to meditate or consider of any thing, when we thoroughly and
deliberately ponder and weigh it in our minds, with all the circumstances
belonging to it. But here we will take it in a more strict sense, as it
pondreth those things which nearly concern our estate; and so it is much like
unto examination, although if we speak properly and distinctly, there is some
difference between them. For consideration is yet, as we here handle it, more
general, extending to all things that concern us, past, present, and to come;
but examination properly meddleth not with things to come, but searches out
those things which are past or present; bringing them to be tried by the rule,
according to which we do examine them, whether they be true or false; good
or evil. Consideration waigheth and deliberateth beforehand what we are
about to do, and whether it be lawful or unlawful, expedient or unnecessary,
profitable or to our loss, and accordingly moves us either to do it, or to
leave it undone: But in examination we consider of that which is done already,
whether it be well or evil done, wisely and to our good, or unadvisedly and to
our hurt. If the former were thoroughly performed, the latter would not be much
necessary, unless it were to reuiew our good actions (as God did the works of
creation) that we might approve them, and rejoice in the conscience of our
well-doing. But because we often fail in it, and do things rashly and without
due advice, therefore we are necessarily to use the latter, and to examine
what before we considered not (our after-wit being better then our fore-wit)
that so we may reform what is amiss, and return into the right way out of
which we have erred. Yet because I would not make this already long Treatise
ouer-tedious to the Reader, but chiefly because many points and proofs are
coincident, belonging to them both, I will not divide them in my Discourse, but
handle them together; and the rather, because I have already spoken of the
generalities of consideration, in which it chiefly differs from this other of
examination, in the former tract of Meditation.

. Sect. 2 Of examination, what it is, and wherein it consists.
This examination or consideration, is nothing else but a serious waighing, and
pondring of those things which nearly concern us in our spiritual estate; or
the diligent searching and trial of our estates, how they stand between God
and us, in matters concerning his glory and our own salvation. The which
examination is held after a solemn manner in the Court of Conscience, and in
Gods presence; we sitting as Judges upon our selves, to give sentence
according to the Law of God, and the evidence of our own consciences, either
with or against our selves, concerning those things which we have done or left
undone, good or evil. In which trial, by help of memory and conscience, our
Register and Witness, we reuiew and take a survey of all that we have done in
the flesh, of all our parts and faculties of soul and body, examining how we
have employed them to the glory of him that gave them; our understandings in
knowing and acknowledging him; our memories in remembering him; our hearts and
affections in adhering and cleaving unto him, by loving, fearing, trusting in
him, and so in the rest. Of all our thoughts also, words and actions, how we
have by them glorified or dishonored God. Of all our course and carriage in
our whole life and conversation, and how we have therein answered the end of
our Creation and Redemption, which was to glorify him, who has made and saved
us. More especially, we may examine our selves, how we have performed or
broken our vows and promises made unto God, and principally our promise in
Baptism; how we have shaken off the service of sin, Satan, and the world,
and devoted our selves wholly to the service of God. How we have profited in
mortification, and what corruptions we have subdued and weakened, which
formerly were potent and strong in us; how we have mastered and abated our
pride, anger, ambition, covetousness, voluptuousness, impatiencie, evil
concupiscence, and the rest of our corrupt affections and unruly passions. How
we have profited in newness of life, both inwardly in our minds and hearts,
and outwardly in our words and actions; how we have ruled that unruly member
our tongues, and have made them instruments of Gods glory, and of the
edification of our neighbors and our selves. How we have grown in Gods
graces, waxing daily stronger in our faith, and assurance of his love and our
salvation, more fervent in our love and zeal, more firm in our affiance, and
how we have renewed and increased our sorrow for sin, our hatred of our
corruptions, especially of our beloved sins, and how we have in our endeavors
and actions answered our resolutions of serving God in newness of life. How we
have furnished our selves with all the parts of our Christian Armor, and kept
it fast buckled unto us in the whole time of our warfare. How we have kept our
spiritual watch, and how we have resisted or been overcome with the
tentations of our spiritual enemies. How we have performed the general duties
of Christianity, and the special duties of our callings; and how we have
observed or neglected the duties of our daily exercise, as they have before
been described unto us. How we have profited by Gods Judgments upon our
selves or others, for the mortification of our sins, and weaning our hearts
from the love of the world; and how his mercies and blessings, his patience and
long-suffering, have been available with us, to lead us unto repentance, and
to make us diligent and cheerful in his service. Whether we have been made
more careful by our former falls, to look better to our footing, and whether
the remembrance of our lost time, has not made us double our diligence, that
we may redeem it, by performing unto God more faithful service for the time
to come. Whether we are daily careful to renew our Covenant with God, and to
preserve our selves from sliding back in the breach of our promises. Whether
we decay not in our first love, but nourish it and all other saving graces in
their first feruency, yea increase in them daily more and more. Finally,
whether we are prepared to bear afflictions, and to meet death with a
cheerful and willing heart; and whether our accounts be in that readiness,
that we do with comfort and joy expect and wish for the coming of our Savior
Christ unto Judgment.

. Sect. 3 That we are chiefly to examine our selves in respect of our sins;
and first, our original corruption.
But the chief things wherein we must most often and seriously examine our
selves, are our sins, and the miseries and punishments which attend upon
them. And first, our original corruption, whereby we have defaced Gods Image
in us, and defiled all the powers and faculties of our souls and bodies,
whereby being utterly disabled unto all good duties of Gods service, they are
prone unto all evil, and to perform service unto sin and Satan. So that
there is naturally no sound place in us, but from the crown of the head, to
the sole of the foot, nothing but wounds and bruizes, and Esa. 1. 6.
putrefying sores. Nor any sin and wickedness, how abominable so ever, the
seeds whereof do not remain in us, wanting nothing but the tentations of the
devil, the world, and our own flesh, to make them sprowt up and come to their
full growth, as often as we get fit opportunity. Neither is this the case of some
alone, but of all without exception, one as well as another, being ready to
commit any outrageous wickedness, David as well as Cain, Lot as the Sodomites,
Peter as well as Judas. Or if they do not, it is not from the benefit of
nature, which is equally corrupt in all (all being alike the children of wrath
and dead in their sins) but from the Spirit Ephesians. 2. 1, 3.
of God, which either sanctifies and changes the nature of the Elect, or
restrains the wicked, by giving them some common and Moral gifts, for the
good of humane society, which otherwise could not stand, if they were let loose
to their natural impiety. Of which restraint, if they be once freed and left
to themselves, they burst out with Nero, Hazael, Judas, 2. King. 8. 13.
and many others, into such outrageous wickedness, as in the time of the
Spirits restraint, their own judgments, who are best acquainted with their
own hearts, would have thought, that their natures could not possibly be
inclined to such abominations. Here then is matter enough for our trial and
examination to be exercised about, if we will rake in this noisome sink of
all uncleanness, and rip these old sores to the bottom. Which though it be
unpleasant to corrupted nature, because being full of self-love, it flees the
sight of its own deformities, and being willing to flatter it self with a
false opinion of some native beauty, does abhor the discovery of its ugly
filthiness, and with the Elephant wilfully muddeth the clear waters, which
would give it a view how monstrously it is misshapen; yet is it a consideration
most necessary; seeing this is the root and fountain of all our other sins,
whereof we should most seriously repent, bewayling, and reforming this inbred
corruption; which if we neglect, and spend all our time about our actual
sins, it is all one, as if we should be still chopping at the branches, and
let the root live and grow, or be wholly taken up in clensing of the streams,
and never take care for the purging of the fountain, which being polluted,
defiles them with its filthiness.

. Sect. 4 Secondly, we must examine our selves, concerning our actual
transgressions, according to the Law.
Secondly, in this examination, we must call ourselves to an account for our
actual sins, which we our selves have committed against Gods Majesty, by
breaking his Law, and all and every of his Commandments, in thought, word, and
deed. The rule of which examination, by which we are to come to our trial, is
the Law of God it self, which by our sins we have transgressed; for as the
Apostle says, By the Law comes the knowledge of sin, being that straight
rule which best discovers the crookedness of our actions, and wherein, and
how many ways we have swarued from it. In which course, the best manner of
proceeding is, that we begin where God begins, and so proceed with him, from
one Commandment to another, examining our selves, how often and many ways we
have offended against every one of them, both by neglecting the duties which
they command, and committing the sins which they forbid. Whereof I shall not
need here to set down the particulars, according to which, trial is to be
made, seeing I have done it already in the former part of this Treatise, unto
which I refer the Reader, who desires to make use of it for this purpose.
Only let us know, that the Law of God, being a most perfect abstract of his
will, does contain in it all virtues which he commands, and vices which he
forbids, and though it be brief in words, yet as David says, it is in the
sense and meaning, exceeding Psalm. 119. 96.
large. And therefore when we go to examine our selves according unto it, we
must not look so much to the bare words of every Commandment, as to their
sense, being enlarged according to the rules of extention, which are grounded
upon the Scriptures, and even upon reason and common equity. As first, where
any vice or sin is forbidden, there the contrary virtue or duty is commanded,
and contrariwise. Secondly, where one particular vice is forbidden, or duty
commanded, there all vices or duties of the same nature and kind, are
forbidden or commanded, as our Savior has taught us in his exposition of the
Law. Thirdly, Mat. 5. 21, 22
the Law being perfect, does require perfect obedience of the whole man, and
every part inward and outward, soul and body; so also whole obedience unto all
and every Commandment: for he that breaks one of Iam. 2. 10.
them, is guilty of all; and not only that our obedience be whole and total
in respect of the parts, but also in respect of degrees, that it be in that
perfection which this perfect Law requires. Fourthly, the Law being
spiritual, and having a spiritual sense and power, does bind not Romans 7. 14.
only the outward man to external obedience, but also the soul and secret
thoughts, the heart and conscience. Yea, the first and last Commandments have
a large extent above all the rest, reaching even to our thoughts and first
motions, which have not the consent of will joined with them. Fifthly, where
any virtue or vice is commanded or forbidden, there also all the means and
occasions are commanded or forbidden. Sixthly, where any duty is commanded, or
vice forbidden, there also the signs of them both are also enjoined or
prohibited: for we must have a good conscience, both before God, and also
before men, and avoid not Act. 24. 16.
only the evil it self, but also all appearance of it. And lastly, the
common rule of charity, binding us to love our neighbors as our selves, and
that God may be glorified in their obedience, as well as our own, the Law of
God requires, that we should not only observe all that is contrived Psalm.
119. 139.
in it, our selves, but also provide, as much as in us lies, that it be
likewise observed by our neighbors, yea even by our enemies.

. Sect. 5 How we must aggrauate our sins, in respect of circumstances.
And if by help of these rules we enlarge the Law of God, according to the
true sense and meaning of it, and examine our selves answerably in all the
duties which it commands, and all the vices and sins which it forbids,
we shall hereby come to a clear and lively sense and feeling of our sins in
all the sorts and kinds of them; unto which, when we have in some measure
attained, we must then further examine our selves, how often and innumerable
times we have reiterated and multiplied the same sins, against every of Gods
Commandments, in thought, word, and deed. And then we shall plainly see,
that our sins in number exceed the hairs of our head, and the stars of
heaven. Which when we have done, we must in the next place consider, how
heinous they have many of them been, in respect of their quality and degree.
Where we are carefully to take heed that we do not (as corrupt nature, pride,
and self-love persuade the most) excuse, minse, and extenuate our sins; but
that we look upon them in their natural ugliness and outragiousnesse, and
aggrauate them by all their circumstances of persons, manner, time, place, and
the means which God has given us, to preserve us from committing them, or of
raising us out of them by repentance. As that we have thus and thus sinned,
not only when we were the vassals of Satan, uncalled, and unregenerate, with
full consent of will, and with all delight and cheerfulness, but since we
were called, regenerate and enlightened by Gods Spirit; and since we have given
our names to Christ, and professed our selves to be his servants, we have
oftentimes done service unto Satan his arch-enemy, by committing many sins,
not only through frailty and infirmity, either through ignorance, or because
we were taken upon the sudden and at unawares; but oftentimes wittingly and
willingly against knowledge and conscience, yea sometime wilfully, being
transported with the violence of our carnal lusts and passions, and (as it
were) with an high hand against God. That we have thus sinned, not only in
secret, committing that wickedness in Gods presence, which we would have
forborne in the presence of a mortal man, but also openly and scandalously, to
the dishonor of God, and slander of our profession. That we have not seldom
fallen into these sins, but often and many times; yea even after that we have
repented of them, and have resolved, vowed, and promised, that we would leave
and forsake them. That we have committed these sins, not against an enemy, a
stranger, or one of mean condition, like unto our selves, but against God,
omnipotent in power, and glorious in Majesty; and unto us so infinite in grace
and mercy, that with all other blessings which we enjoy or hope for, he has
given the Son of his love unto us, and for us, that he might by his death
work that great work of our Redemption, and give unto us life and happiness,
who were the slaves of Satan, dead in our sins, enemies to God and our own
good, and the children of wrath as well as others. That we have not by strong
inducements been drawn to offend so great and gracious a God, but for mere
trifles, and the contemptible wages of worldly vanities. That we have
committed these sins, being the members of Jesus Christ our Head, and so (as
much as in us did lie) have defiled him with the taint of our sins, and
drawn him (as much as we could) into communion with us in our wickedness,
that shed his precious blood to purge and purify us, that we might be holy,
and without all blemish of sinful pollution. That we have by our sins
grieved the good Spirit in us, vexing him who is our Comforter, by quenching
his good motions, and obeying the suggestions of Satan, and the lusts of our
sinful flesh. That we have thus sinned, and having fallen, have lien in our
sins without repentance, notwithstanding the plentiful means which God has
granted of grace and sanctification. As the light of the Gospel and preaching
of the Word, whereby we have been instructed, counseled, admonished, reproved,
comforted in all good courses by his gracious promises, and withdrawn from
sin by the denunciation of his curse and terrible threatenings. Yea
notwithstanding the Lord has encouraged us to serve him cheerfully, with the
liberal wages of present blessings, and dis-heartened us from going on in
sin, by causing us to feel the smart of his chastisements and corrections.

. Sect. 6 That it is a profitable course to keep a Catalogue or Register of our
special sins; and the manifold fruits which will arise of it.
And thus we are to examine our selves, both in respect of the number and
quantity, and the heinousness and quality of our sins. But because our
observation is slight, our memories short, and notable to recount and recall
them, when we most need to have them in our sight, and because we oftentimes
are interrupted in this exercise by many distractions: It should be a
profitable course, if we would, when we are best at leisure, and most fit for
this exercise, and especially in the day of our affliction and humiliation,
examine our selves thoroughly and seriously, according to every one of the
Commandments, in the order before prescribed; and as we go, take a Catalogue
of all the sins that we can with deliberate study call to our remembrance,
which we have committed in the whole course of our lives, not in the particular
acts, which being often reiterated, are innumerable, but in their several
kinds. And for our more distinct and orderly proceeding herein, we may consider
how we have carried our selves in our several ages, states and callings, in
our childhood, youth, mature, and old age, how toward God, our neighbors, and
our selves; how before we were called, in the days of our ignorance; and how
since we were called and enlightened with the knowledge of God and his truth;
how in this, and how in that passage of our lives; how when we were children
under government of our parents; and how since we were parents and governors
of others. Which when we have at once or sundry times drawn, and enlarged, as
afterward upon occasion our sins come to our remembrance, it will be a
notable help, not only for the beginning of sound repentance, but also for
the renewing of it, as often as we go about it: and minister unto us matter
plentifully, for the confession of our sins before God, and deprecation, when
we have thus humbled our souls in his sight; and much strengthen our faith in
the assurance of their remission, when as we have thus specially repented of
them, confessed them, and craved at Gods hands mercy and forgiveness. But
especially we must remember in this our Catalogue, to set down our most
grievous and heinous sins, whereby we have most dishonored God, and
provoked his displeasure against us, whether they have been committed before,
or after our calling. For though God has forgiven them, we must not forget
them, but must retain them in memory, and daily repent of them, using them as
a chief motive to work our hearts to hearty sorrow, both for them, and all
our other sins, and as goades and pricks in our sides, to make us with more
zeal to go on in the contrary course, and in bringing forth to Gods glory the
fruits of new obedience. And thus the Lord required of the Israelites, that
they should always remember Deuteronomy. 9. 7.
their stiff-necked rebellion in the Wilderness, whereby they provoked him to
wrath against them. And thus among their other sins, they specially remembered
and acknowledged their ingratitude in rejecting 1. Sam. 12. 19. Psalm. 51. 14.
Gods government, and desiring of a King. Thus David repenting of all his other
wickedness, does specially call to mind his adultery and murder, even after
God by his Prophet had assured him of forgiveness. And the Apostle Paul, upon
all occasions remembers his grievous sin 1. Tim. 1. 13. 1. Cor. 15. 9. Act.
26. 10.
of persecuting the Church, both for his humiliation, and to stir up his
zeal in Gods service. And thus having set down our accounts with God for the
time past, it will be a good course for the time to come, that our reckonings
may be kept continually even, to keep a iournall or day-booke, wherein we are
to set down what sins of note we can observe in our selves every particular
day, either in the committing of any evil which God has condemned, or in
omitting, or negligent performing any special and necessary duties which he
has commanded, respecting himself, our neighbors, or our own persons, which
if it have been heinous and grievous, we may well register and write it in our
Catalogue (as it were) in capital or red letters, as a sin to be repented
of in the whole course of our lives. For if Merchants and Tradesmen find it
profitable and necessary, to have not only books of accounts, which contain
the maine matters of their estates, what they have, and what they have parted
with; what they owe, and what is owing to them; but also their day-bookes,
wherein they write what they buy, and what they sell; what they have laid out,
and what has come in; and yet all this pains is taken for the preserving and
increasing their worldly and temporal riches, which are momentany, uncertain,
mutable and sure to perish: Why should we think such care too much, and
pains too great, for the good of our souls, and the preserving or increasing
of our spiritual and eternal riches, the discharge and clearing of our debts
unto God, which if they be found upon our account at the great Audit of Gods
last Judgment, shall never be forgiven, but make us liable to everlasting
punishments? Besides, we shall receive for the present, diverse benefits, by
keeping and registring this strict account. For hereby we shall be more
watchful over our selves, that we let no enemy enter in the day, which will
trouble us at night, and will not let us rest till we have thrust it out by
unfeigned repentance; we shall be freed from carnal security, and be made more
careful in observing our sins, either to prevent or reform them, and more
able to remember them when they are committed, that we may bewail them, and
take better heed for the time to come. And finally, we shall not so easily be
overcome of every tentation, and enticed unto sin, when as we know
beforehand, that it shall come into account, and under the censure of
conscience, awarding us to shame or sorrow, and to lose the sweetness, which
we have tasted with some carnal delight in sinning, by the smart and pain of
speedy repentance. And as no wise man will run upon the score, or have his
name in the shop-book, for every needless trifle which may well be spared,
because one thing draws on another until it come to a round sum; nor for a
greater matter, when he purposes present payment, as soon as the wares are
brought home, because the crossed book, as it shows his honesty in paying
his debts, so at least it seems to argue defect of present means, in that
for the time he was indebted: so much less would any come upon the score, or
into the book of conscience for every small bait of worldly pleasure or
profit, seeing here especially one thing pulls on another, and many littles
make a great reckoning; nor yet for matters of greater moment, if they
considered that payment must be made, the score cleared, and the book
crossed, before they can betake themselves to quiet rest. Which when it is
done, though it shows their faith and piety in repenting, yet withal their
frailty and imperfection in their spiritual estate, in that by falling into
sin they needed repentance.

. Sect. 6 Of the consideration of our misery and punishment.
And thus we must examine our selves in respect of our sins; which when we have
done, we must not rest there, but enter also into the consideration Heb. 10. 31.
of the misery and punishments, which not being repented of, they bring upon
us. As that they make us subject to the wrath and displeasure of Almighty God,
who being a consuming fire, and we as stubble or combustible matter, it must
needs be a fearful thing to fall into his hands. To the curse also of the Law,
denounced against all that continue not in all that is written therein to do
it, and to all the plagues and punishments threatened therein, which respect
either this life, or the life to come: that they are a wall of separation
between our God and us, stopping from us the sweet influences of his grace and
love, and hindering us of many testimonies of his favor in temporal things,
which otherwise he would graciously bestow upon us. And contrariwise, that
till we repent, they endanger us to everlasting condemnation, which though we
do hereafter avoid, by turning from our sins unto God, yet in the mean time
they expose us to temporary afflictions, which God uses as a means to bring
us to repentance, crossing us in our evil courses, and setting thorny Hos. 2.
6.
hedges in our way, to stay us from running too far from him. They move him
to meet with us at every turn, and to bring us to a true sight and sense of
our sins, by fitting his punishments in some proportion or likeness unto
them; because so brutish we are in observing our sins, and the judgments of
God inflicted for them, that (like the dog before the sheep that he has
worried) we need to be taken with the manner, and to have our fault laid
before us, when he takes us in hand to beat us for it. For because sin is
too sweet to our carnal appetite, therefore the Lord imbittereth it with the
wormwood and gall of afflictions, which Lam. 3. 19.
oftentimes much more vexing us, then we took delight in the pleasure of
sin, does make us afterward, when we remember this loathsome after-taste, to
restrain our appetite, and not to give way to our carnal concupiscence
alluring us to wickedness.

. Sect. 7 Of the end of this examination, and time when it is to be performed.
And thus we see the subject matter and manner of our examination, with the
helps and means whereby we may be furthered in it. Now the maine end of it
is, that it may serve as an effectual means to bring us to repentance; for
therefore we labor to come unto a true sight of our sins, that we may
unfeignedly bewail them with bitter grief. Therefore do we take a through view
of our sins, and the Judgments of God, miseries and punishments, which do
accompany them, that seeing the ugly deformities of the one, and feeling or
foreseeing the smart of the other, we may be moved, either not to sin, or
being overtaken, to leave and forsake them, and to prevent our own woe by
speedy repentance. The time of this examination is always in season, because
repentance is never unseasonable. For seeing the score is seldom clear, and
our frailty such, that conscience is occasioned to hold the pen still in hand,
and every hand while writes up our debts; therefore we must be still
examining, clearing and crossing of our books, that nothing may stand upon
account, when we shall be called to Judgment; which being most certain, and
the time most uncertain, it would be our wisdom to be always in readiness.
In which regard it were to be wished, that we would spend some little time,
every night before we go to sleep, in examining our selves, and clearing our
accounts for the day past, the which I here pass over, having spoken of it
before in the daily exercise. But most solemnly and seriously are we to set
ourselves about this duty of examination, when as we have some special cause
of renewing our repentance. As when we desire any extraordinary benefit which
we greatly want, when we undertake any weighty business; when we humble
our selves in any solemn manner before God, either publicly or privately, in
the sight and sense of our sins, which we desire should be pardoned, or of
some imminent and approaching judgment, which we would prevent, or some
present affliction which we would have removed; or when we prepare our
selves that we may come as worthy ghests to the Lords Table. Then is this
examination 1. Cor. 11. 28.
most seasonable, as being the best preparatiue for humiliation, fervent
prayer, and serious repentance.

. Sect. 8 A complaint of the neglect of this duty, and the causes thereof.
But alas, how is this excellent duty generally neglected? and how seldom
do the most that profess Christianity, call themselves unto this account,
multiplying their sins from day to day, and never making any reckoning of
them? And although almost all men hold it to be most necessary, to be still
reuievving their vvorldly estates, and to keep a strict account of their
debts, and means to discharge them of their disbursements and expenses, and of
their profits and commings in; yet how fevv are they who seriously examine
their debts to God, or of the means whereby they may discharge them? how
they thrive and increase, or how they decay and go backwards in their
spiritual estate, till at last they prove Banquerupts in all grace and
goodness, and so desperate in their estates, that they only think how they
may run further in debt, and never take care how it may be discharged? Of
which neglect there are many causes. First, because they are so far in love
with their sins, that they loath all means which might work any dislike,
or convince them of the necessity to leave and forsake them. So our Savior
says, that when light is come into the world, men love darkness rather then
light, because Ioh. 3. 19, 20.
their deeds are evil. For every man that does evil, hates the light,
neither comes to it, lest his deeds should be reproved. Secondly, because
through long neglect of this duty, their debts are grown to such an hidious
sum, that they are afraid to reuiew their reckonings, herein like
Banquerupts, who having consumed their means, and made their estates
desperate, cannot endure to keep any accounts, or if they do, to cast up
their reckonings, because their debts are grown so great, that they have no
hope that they shall ever discharge them; and therefore they will not grieve
themselves in looking upon those evils which they cannot avoid. Or like unto
foolish and desperate Patients, who have let their sores run so long, without
using the means whereby they might have been cured, that now they fear the
remedy more then the disease, and choose rather to rot in their corruption, then
to have their festred sores searched to the bottom. Thirdly, because they so
overmuch love and mind worldly things, that they securely neglect their
spiritual estate, and are so wholly taken up in keeping their accounts with
men, that they can find no leisure to account with God. Yea so wholly are they
possessed with earthly vanities, that they never so much as think of it, as a
thing necessary, that they should spend any time in examining themselves, and
searching out their sins. Fourthly, because they presume so much of Gods
mercy, that they imagine that he will forgive all their debts in the gross
sum, and never Eccles. 11. 9. Math. 12 33. and 16. 2. and 25. 19. 2. Cor. 5.
10.
trouble either himself or them, in examining particulars, though in many
express places of Scripture he has professed the contrary; and though it will
not stand with Gods infinite wisdom to forgive such great debts, before his
debtors take notice of them, that they may love him, who has forgiven them so
much, be thankful, and render unto him due praise for his infinite bounty.
Wherein what do they else but make an Idol of Gods mercy, in separating it
not only from his Justice, but also from his Wisdom and Truth?

CAP. XXIIII.
Containing diverse effectual reasons to move us unto this exercise of
Meditation.

. Sect. 1 That this duty is required in the Scriptures.
But that those who truly fear God, may not be carried away in this common
stream of negligence and corruption, sporting themselves in the pleasures of
sin, until they fall into the dead sea of endless destruction; let them
first consider, that this duty of consideration and examination of our estates,
is strictly required of God, and has been always practiced by the faithful.
The former is manifest by plain testimonies of holy Scriptures. David
exhorts us to stand in awe, and sin not; and to commune Psalm. 4. 4.
with our own hearts upon our bed, and be still. The Church in the
Lamentations demands why a living man should complain, seeing a man is Lam.
3. 39, 40.
punished for his sins? and therefore his best way is, not to lie lamenting
his pain, but to find out and remove the cause, that the effect may cease.
Let us search and try our ways (says she) and turn again to the Lord. So
the Lord says, that the people of Israel, upon their freedom out of
captivity, should remember their ways, and all their doings, wherein they
Ezekiel. 20. 43.
had been defiled, that they might be loathsome in their own sight, for all the
evils Hag. 1. 5, 7.
which they had committed. Thus the Apostle exhorts us to examine our 1. Cor.
11. 28, 31. Gal. 6. 4, 5.
selves before we come to the Lords Table, and tells us, that if we would
judge our selves, we should not be judged of the Lord. So elsewhere; Examine 2.
Cor. 13. 5.
your selves whether you be in the faith; prove your selves, etc. And thus in
many Romans 6. 17. 1. Cor. 6. 9, 10. Ephesians. 2. 11.
places he puts those in mind to whom he writes, of their former sinful
estate, out of which, through Gods mercy they were delivered, that they might
repent of their sins past, and praise the Lord for their present condition.
The neglect of which duty the Lord complains of, and condemns in the Jews,
as the cause of their gross ingratitude and impenitency. The Ox knows his
owner, and the Ass his Masters crib; but Esa. 1. 3.
Israel does not know, my people does not consider. So Jeremy; I hearkened and
Jer. 8. 6.
heard, but they spoke not aright, no man repented of his wickedness, saying,
What have I done? As on the other side, the practice of this duty is commended
unto us in the examples of the godly. Thus David performing himself, what he
persuaded unto others, says, that he considered his own Psalm. 119. 59. Luke
15. 17.
ways, and turned his feet unto Gods testimonies. So the Prodigal did begin
his repentance by coming to himself (as it were) out of the dead swoone of
sin, calling to remembrance his departing from such a gracious Father, and
his own wanderings in the ways of wickedness, in which he had lost himself,
as in an inextricable and endless Labyrinth. And the Apostle often recalleth
his sins to his remembrance, to humble himself that had committed them,
glorify God who had forgiven them, and comfort others who had alike fallen, and
to encourage them with him to forsake their sins, and turn unto God by
unfeigned repentance.

. Sect. 2 The great profit of this exercise of examination.
Unto these precepts drawing us, and these examples leading us to this duty of
examination, we may add the great profit which may allure us, Plus teipsum
explora quam proximos: nam illud lucrum tuum est, hoc proximorum, etc.
Nazianzen. in sentent.
and the urgent necessity which presses it upon us. For first, the benefits
are manifold which accompany this exercise. Examine thy self more (says one)
then thy neighbors, for that is thy gain, this theirs. Thou should rather
take an account of thy actions, then of thy moneys; seeing these perish, but
they are permanent, and shall continue with thee. More especially, this
examination brings us unto a distinct knowledge of sin, which otherwise we
should only see in general view, and (as it were) in the whole lump or
mass. It discovers unto us their innumerable numbers both great and small,
and as the Sunshine, helps us to discern every sluttish corner, which
before was not seen, and reuealeth not only the gross uncleanness of the
house, but much dust and innumerable moates, which we not discerning, thought
the house clean and free from them: So does this searching of our hearts lay
open unto us many annoyances, which before were hid, and innumerable numbers of
our lesser sins, which we thinking to be nothing, supposed our selves to be
so pure, that there was no need to be purged of them. It shows unto us not
only our gross offenses, but also the corruptions and imperfections of our
best actions; and with our errors and wanderings out of the way of truth, our
lamenesse and slownesse whilst we are walking in it. It discovers, with the
number of our sins, their greatness and heinousness, and makes us know,
whilst we search our sores to the bottom, that they are so deep and
dangerous, that they need present cure, and the sovereign salve of Christ's
Blood; which seemed so slight, whilst they were skinned over with colorable
excuses, that we thought there was no haste of the cure, and that every Lord,
have mercy upon us, or shallow broken sigh was sufficient to heal them. It
works our hearts to a true hatred of them, when upon just trial we see
their ugliness and deformity, their horrible pollution and noisome sent. For
howsoever, whilst these filthy channels were unstirred, they did little trouble
us with any ill savor; yet when we rake in these stinking puddles, they make
us abhor them, and show by their noysomnesse, how much they need clensing.
Yea, it will make us to loath our selves for our sins sake, and thus
abhorring our selves, to repent, with Job, in dust and ashes, according to that
of the Prophet, Then shall ye Job 42 6. Ezekiel. 36. 31.
remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall
loath your selves in your own sight, for your iniquities and abominations. And
as it thus humbles and prepares our hearts for repentance, so is it a most
effectual means to work it in us. And this Solomon intimates, where he
says, that if the Israelites having sinned, should bethink themselves, and
repent; nothing that they must consider their evil ways, before 1. King. 8.
47.
they could repent of them. And our Savior first requires, that the Church of
Ephesus should remember from whence she was fallen, and then Apoc. 2. 5.
that she should repent and do her first works of love. Thus the lamenting
Church, remembering her sins and afflictions which they had brought Lam. 3.
19, 20.
upon her, was humbled and repented. By reason whereof, it furthereth much the
work of sanctification, and helps to purge out of us the relikes of our
sinful corruptions. For this frequent examination will not suffer sin to
sleep with us, nor to have any time to fortify it self against us; but
as soon as it is entered, it discovers this enemy, and will not suffer it to
lay against our souls any secret ambushments. It nourishes in us the true
fear of God, and makes us careful to avoid his displeasure. It pulls us
back, being ready to fall into sin, when we consider the miscries which
attend upon it, and from relapsing into our old diseases, when we remember with
what danger and difficulty we did escape them. It keeps our hearts and
consciences pure and peaceable, whilst by the frequent use of it, they are
preserved from the pollution of sin, or quickly purged when they are defiled.
It nourishes Gods graces in us, and makes us constant in the ways of
godliness. It helps us much in aspiring toward perfection, whilst by often
reuiewing of our works, we see their defects, and endeavor to amend them.
Finally, it preserves us from receiving any hurt by Gods temporary Judgments,
for if we would judge our selves, he would not 1. Cor. 11. 32.
judge us; and makes us comfortably, and with joy expect the coming of the
Lord to the last Judgment, when as we hereby keep even our accounts, and are
prepared to render a reckoning when he calls for it.

. Sect. 3 That this exercise of Meditation is very necessary.
The necessity of this exercise does likewise appear, because the neglect of
it depriueth us of all the former benefits. But more especially, as repentance
is necessary unto salvation, so this examination must necessarily go before
repentance. For first, we must by examination come to the knowledge of our
sins, before we can either bewail or turn from them. Whereof it is, that
our Savior calls sinners only to repentance, that is, Mat. 9. 13.
such as know and acknowledge themselves to be in this number. And Jeremy
wills the backsliding Israelites, first to acknowledge their iniquities, Ier.
3. 13, 14.
and then to repent of them, and to turn unto the Lord. And David says, that
he thought on his ways, and then turned his feet unto Gods Testimonies. Psalm.
119. 59.
So the Lord says of the Jews, that they should remember their ways and be
Ezekiel. 16. 61.
ashamed. And puts consideration before repentance, as a cause and means of
it; Because (says he) he considers and turns away from all his and 18. 28.
transgressions; implying that he could not have turned, unless he had first
considered of his sins from which he turned. And this (as one excellently M.
Dyke of repentance.
observes) is employed even in nature, where there is the same instrument of
seeing and weeping, to show unto us, that weeping depends upon seeing. He that
sees well, weeps well. He that sees his sins thoroughly, will bewail them
heartily. And this want of consideration, the Prophet notes to have been the
cause, why Ephraim would not turn unto the Lord, that he might heal them;
They consider not (says he) in their hearts, Hos. 7. 1, 2.
that I remember all their wickedness. And the Prophet Jeremy notes this to
have been the cause of the Jews impenitency; because no man so much as
demanded, What have I done? Neither in truth is there any one greater Ier. 8. 6.
cause why men in our own days go on in their sins without repentance,
then want of due consideration what they are doing, namely, treasuring Romans 2.
5.
up against themselves wrath, against the day of wrath, and (as it were)
heaping up a pile of wood for their own burning. Neither were it possible,
that they should rush into all sin, like the horse into the battle, if they
would but examine whither they are a going, and into what desperate dangers of
death and destruction they plunge themselves, by continuing in their wicked
courses. Again, without often and strict examination, it is not possible for
us to find out, or avoid the deceitful wiles of our own sinful hearts;
seeing they are so deep, that without much searching, Ier. 17. 10.
we cannot sound them to the bottom. Whereof it is that the Wiseman
counsels us, that we should above all other observations, look Pro. 4. 23.
to our hearts. And the Apostle exhorts us to take special heed, lest there
should be in us an heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
Moreover, Heb. 3. 12. Deuteronomy. 11. 16.
without this diligent search, whereby we come to a sight of our wants, we
would flatter our selves in our weak and frail estate, as though nothing
needed reformation; and pleasing our selves in our own imperfections, we would
never labor and strive after more perfection. For we are naturally so full of
pride and self-love, that as Solomon speaks, Every Pro. 21. 2.
way of a man seems right in his own eyes. And therefore our Savior
exhorts us to take heed that the light which is in us be not darkness, that
is, Luke 11. 35.
that our seeming wisdom be not foolishness, and that we mistake not the
stained cloth of our imperfect obedience, for the pure white linen of perfect
sanctity; and so grossly abuse our selves: for if a man thinks Gal. 6. 3.
himself to be something, when he is nothing, he is deceived, and coozeneth
himself of his own salvation. With which deceit it is easy to be overtaken
(with proud Iusticiaries) by reason of our self-love; if we do not often and
seriously examine our selves, according to the perfect rule of Gods Law, and in
this clear Looking-glass behold our blemishes, and the manifold wants and
imperfections of our best actions. Furthermore, the necessity of this
examination hereby appears, in that the neglect thereof is the cause of all
sin. For what is the reason why men rush headlong into all manner of gross
and notorious wickedness? Why they blaspheme Gods holy Name for no worldly
advantage, but upon mere vanity? Why they displease God, and disable
themselves unto all duties of his service, by surfeiting and drunkenness,
without any gain, yea, to the discredit of their persons, and ruining of their
estates? Why they commit filthiness and uncleanness, thereby weakening their
bodies, and shortning their lives? and why they continue in these and many such
sins, with impenitency and hardness of heart? Surely not so much through the
ignorance of their minds, or because their judgments are not convinced, that
these are grievous sins, which for the present draw Gods fearful plagues
upon them; and will hereafter be punished with everlasting death (For they
hear these things daily sounding in their ears in the Ministry of the Word,
and see fearful examples and presidents continually of them in others, who
have lived in the like wickedness) But because though they have sight and
knowledge, yet they have no use of it, the devil having so hud-winkt and blind
folded the eyes of their mind, that they never examine their state, nor
consider with themselves what they do, whither they are a going, nor what will
be the issue and end of these things: And so like hooded Hawks, are carried
quietly by the devil into all wicked courses which lead them to destruction.

. Sect. 4 The former point, proved by the Scriptures. Esa. 1. 3.
And this is manifest by the Scriptures, which in many places show, that men
commit many of their sins, and live in them without repentance, because they
examine not their estate, nor enter into due consideration what they do. Thus
it is said, that the cause of the Israelites ingratitude and rebellion against
God, was, because they did not consider, either Gods goodness and bounty, nor
their own wickedness, and the manifold evils which thereby they brought upon
themselves. That the cause why many of them followed drunkenness, and sported
themselves in this sin with all sensual delight, was, because they regarded
not the work of Esa. 5. 11, 12.
the Lord, neither considered the operation of his hands. That they forsook
the Lord, and worshipped stocks and stones, the works of their own hands,
Esa. 44. 19.
because none considered in their hearts the vanity of Idols, and that
themselves had made them of the same tree, whereof they had burned a part, and
converted other parts of it to other uses. That the cause of Babylons insolency
and pride, whereby they tyra^nized over Gods people, was, because they did not
consider, that God had made them only scourges and rods to correct his people,
which having done, he would cast the^ into the fire: which things Esa 47. 7.
and 57. 11.
they did not lay to heart, nor remember the latter end, namely, their
destruction, and the deliverance of Gods people. And as neglect of this
consideration is the cause of sin, so also it exposes us to fearful
punishments; for if we will not judge our selves, we shall be judged of the
Lord; if we forget his Judgments and never think of them, he will rub our
memories, and help us to recover our lost wits, by whipping us like Bedlems,
and making us sensible by smart, who were insensible of reason. Thus the Lord
says, that the whole Land was made desolate, because no man laid it to Ier.
12. 11.
heart. And thus he threatens the Israelites, that because they did not
remember and consider his former mercies, and their own sins and
unworthiness, therefore he would recompense their ways upon their head, and
Ezekiel. 16. 43.
make them to know him by his Judgments, when as his mercies would not make
them acknowledge him. Lastly, this may show us how necessary this examination
is, seeing it must of necessity be done either in this world, or the world to
come. For all shall render a reckoning of all that they have done in the flesh;
and therefore if we do not examine and judge our selves here, God will
examine and condemn us hereafter. If we do not call our selves to account in
this life, when as finding our selves short in our reckonings, we have time to
sue, through the Mediation of Christ, for the pardon of our debts, and to
procure a general acquittance and discharge: we shall be accountant to Gods
Justice at the day of Judgment, when the Day of grace and salvation being
past, there will be no place for procuring of pardon; but being much indebted,
and having nothing to pay, we shall be cast into the prison of outer
darkness, without hope of mercy, or deliverance from that endless misery.
Which fearful Judgment and condemnation if we would avoid, let us here,
whilst the Day of salvation lasts, examine, judge, and condemn our selves,
that we may turn from our sins by unfeigned repentance; and so having Christ
to be both our Advocate and Judge, we shall then escape Gods severe and strict
Judgment, seeing he will answer for us; and our examination and judgment
being already dispatched in this life, nothing shall then remain, but that he
our Judge should pronounce the sentence of absolution, and enter us into the
full fruition of that heavenly happiness, and everlasting joys of his
Kingdom, which by his death and merits he has purchased for us.

CAP. XXV.
Of the fourth private means of a godly life, which is, walking daily with God.

. Sect. 1 That we are always in Gods presence.
THe fourth private means of a godly life, is, with Enoch to walk with God,
that is, to set our selves in his presence, always Genesis 5. 22.
remembering that he is with us, hearing all our words, and beholding all our
actions, yea even the very secret thoughts of our hearts: And that not as an
idle spectatour, but as a righteous Judge, who is both able and willing to
reward us bountifully, if we do well; and to punish us severely, if we do
evil. Wherein we have holy David for our example, who professes, that he
Psalm. 16. 8.
did set the Lord always before him. Which that we may imitate, let our
judgments first be thoroughly informed in this truth, that howsoever God keeps
his chief residence in heaven, in respect of revealing himself most clearly
to his Angels and Saints, and manifestation of his presence, by admitting them
to a more full and perfect vision of his Majesty and glory, yet being infinite
and incomprehensible, he fills all places in heaven and earth with his
presence, containing all things, and being himself contained of nothing. Thus
Solomon says, that the Heaven of heavens cannot contain him. And the Lord
himself demands; Am I a God at 1. King. 8. 27.
hand, and not a God far off? Can any man hide himself in secret places that
Jer. 23. 23, 24.
I shall not see him? Do not I fill heaven and earth, says the Lord? And
David professes, that he could in no place, either by sea or land, in heaven
or in Psalm. 139. 7, 8, 9.
hell, go from his presence. And being thus omni-present, he sees and
beholds all things, himself in the mean time being invisible. For hell Job
26. 6.
is naked before him, and destruction has no covering. The eyes of the Lord
are Pro. 15. 3.
in every place, beholding the evil and the good. Darkness hides not from
him, but the night shines as the day: the darkness and the light are both
alike to Psalm. 139. 12.
him. He beholds the most hidden secrets, and all things are naked and Heb.
4. 13.
transparant to his sight. Yea, he sees all our actions, and his eyes are upon
Ier. 16. 17.
all our ways: they are not hid from his face, neither is our iniquity hid
from his eyes. Yea, he clearly discemeth, not only outward works in the most
Pro. 15. 11.
secret corners, but he searches and tries our very hearts and reins. For
hell and destruction are before the Lord, and how much more then the hearts
Ier. 17. 10. Job 42. 2.
of the children of men? And though they be so wicked and deceitful, that they
are never known unto others, and oftentimes not to our selves, yet the Lord,
who by his infinite wisdom sees and knows all things, searches and tries
them.

. Sect. 2 That it would be a powerful means to restrain us from all sin,
if we would always set God before us.
The which if it were thoroughly considered, would be a most powerful and
effectual means, to move us continually to walk with God, to perform all
duties of a godly life, and to carry our selves in all our thoughts, words, and
works, at all times, and in all places, as in his sight and presence. If we
did ever set God before our eyes, and always remembered that his eyes were upon
us, it would be a notable bridle to pull us back, and to hold us up when we
are ready to fall into any sin. It would make us to watch over our selves,
that we did not do any wickedness which is odious and displeasing in his
sight, because though it be a great fault to transgress the Law of our
Sovereign, yet it is much aggrauated by our boldness and impudency, when we
dare commit it before his face, and in his sight. It would make us careful of
all our words and ways, not only in the duties of our callings, that we did
not carry our selves, either negligently or deceitfully, as in our tradings and
dealings, buying and selling, but also in our sports and recreations, where
naturally we are most apt to forget our selves, and to discover most vanity and
folly. For if the presence of some grave and godly man would so ouer-awe us,
that we should thereby be withheld from the most of our sins; and if coming
at unawares and taking us with the manner, as we are talking vainly or
profanely, and doing that which is evil or mis-beseeming us, we are ready to
discover the shame of our hearts, in our blushing cheeks and dejected
countenances; if the presence and eye of Parents and Schoolmasters, restrain
their children and scholars from acting their childish follies, and doing such
things which they have prohibited; if no malefactor is so desperately
impudent, as to play his prankes in the presence of his Judge; and to make him
an eyewitness of his wickedness: then how much less would we mis-behaue
our selves by transgressing Gods Law, if we did always remember and seriously
consider, that our heavenly Father, Master, and Sovereign Judge did look upon
us? Seneca Magna pars peccatorum tollitur, si peccaturis testis assistat. Sen.
Epist. 11.
persuaded his friend Lucilius, for the keeping of himself within compass of
his duty, to imagine that some grave man, as Cato or Lelius, did still look
upon him; because spectators would keep him from offending. And being come to
more perfection, would have a man to fear no man's presence more then his own,
nor any man's testimony, above that of his own conscience; because he might
flee from another, but not from himself, and escape others censure, but not
the censure of his own conscience. How much more then would it keep us from
committing of any wickedness, if we always remembered that God looked upon
us, whose pure eyes cannot endure any sinful pollution? seeing he also is
grearer then our consciences, and so upright in his Judgments, that though
conscience may be silenced for a time, and give in no evidence, or be a false
witness, yet it is as impossible to corrupt him, as to escape his sentence,
either by flight, or by making our appeal. And this argument David uses to
put an end to the wickedness of the wicked, because the righteous Psalm. 7. 9.
God tries the hearts and the reins. And Solomon disswadeth the young man from
folly and filthiness by the same reason; Why will thou, my son, be ravished
with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? For the ways of
men are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondreth all his goings. Yea, this
should no less forcibly restrain us from secret then from open sins, seeing
no man can hide himself in secret places, that the Lord cannot Ier. 23. 24.
see him, for he beholds not only our most hidden actions, but also Apoc 2.
23.
searches the reins and the heart, and will give unto every man according to
their works, and he will bring every work into judgment, with every secret
Eccles. 12. 14.
thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. His eyes are upon the Job
34. 21, 22.
ways of man, and he sees all his goings. There is no darkness nor shadow
of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. And this argument
the Church uses to preserve them from forgetfulness of God, and from
idolatry, seeing God would search this out, though men could not see Psalm. 44.
20, 21.
them, because he knows the secrets of the heart. Neither could any thing
more forcibly restrain us from secret sins, then a serious consideration of
Gods all-seeing presence, as we see in the example of Joseph, who though he
were solicited to commit uncleanness by his mistress, who in all lawful
things might command him, and had power to reward him, if he condescended to
her desire, and to bring him into much trouble and danger, if he gave her a
repulse, and had also the opportunity of secrecy, which freed him from shame
and punishment, yet resisted the tentation by this alone consideration, that he
should hereby grievously sin against Genesis 39. 9.
God, who was a beholder of all his actions. Whereas on the other side, nothing
does make men sin more boldly and securely, then when having put God out of
their sight, they imagine they are out of his, and that he either sees or
regards not their works of wickedness. Thus the eye of the adulterer
waits for the twy-light, saying, No eye shall see me. Job 24. 15.
And wicked men thus encourage themselves in their wickedness, saying; How
does God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? Thick clouds are Job 22.
13, 14.
a covering to him, that he sees not, and he walks in the circuit of heaven.
So the Psalmist says, that the mighty men of the world hearten themselves on
in their oppressions, breaking in pieces Gods people, and afflicting his
heritage; Psalm. 94. 5, 6, 7.
slaying the widow and stranger, and murdering the fatherless; saying, The
Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. And having
complained that the proud and violent had risen against him, and sought to
destroy his innocent soul, he renders this as the reason of it; Because they
Psalm. 86. 14. and 10. 4, 5.
had not set God before them.

. Sect. 3 That the consideration of Gods presence would effectually move us
unto all good duties.
And as this consideration, that God is present and beholds all our actions,
powerfully restrains us from all sin; so does it effectually move us unto
all good duties of his service. For if it be a strong motive to make a subject
diligent and cheerful in doing the will of his Sovereign, who is able to
prefer him, and bountiful to reward him, when he takes notice of his
pains, and is an eyewitness of all his service; and if a soldier will fight
valiantly, and hazard himself to all dangers, when the eye of his General is
upon him: then much more would we spare for no pains in performing the duties
of Gods service, and in fighting his battles, against the spiritual enemies of
our salvation, if we always remembered that the eye of our supreme Sovereign,
and chief Commander were still upon us, who is infinitely able, and no less
willing to prefer and reward us for our well-doing. And this argument David
uses to stir up himself unto all good duties: I have kept (says he) thy
Psalm. 119. 168.
precepts and thy testimonies; for all my ways are before thee. Yea, this
consideration will preserve us from all hypocrisy and cold formality in Gods
service, and make us to perform all good duties in a good manner, with
integrity and uprightness of heart. Because the Lord beholds not only our
outward actions, but also our secret intentions; and as he chiefly requires
that we should give him our hearts, and worship him in spirit and truth, so
does he take special notice whether we do so or no. And this argument the
Lord himself uses to persuade Abraham to uprightness, because he was ever
before him. Walk before me (says he) and be Genesis 17. 1.
upright. And David walked in his integrity, because he knew that he was to
Psalm. 26. 1, 2.
be judged and examined, not by men, but by God, who would try not only his
outward actions, but also his reins and his heart. And the same motive he
uses to persuade his son Solomon to serve the Lord with an upright 1. Chron.
28. 9.
heart, and a willing mind, because he searches all hearts, and understands
all the imaginations of the thoughts. And finally, this moved Cornelius to
hear Act. 10. 33.
the Word of God with all fear and reverence, because they were all in Gods
presence; and the Apostle to preach it purely, and not deceitfully, as 2. Cor.
2. 17.
though he would make Merchandise of it, but in all sincerity; because as it
was the Word of God, and not of man, which he preached; so he did speak it in
Christ, as in Gods sight and presence. And surely if when we set our selves to
serve God, we did duly consider that his piercing eye did behold our hearts
and thoughts, as well as our outward behavior; we could not content our
selves with the service of our lips, hands and knees, and suffer our hearts to
go a wandering about worldly vanities, because we would know, that God whom we
serve is not contented with it. We would be ashamed that he should behold our
hypocrisy and formal service; our hearts going one way, and our tongues
another; seeing we would blush for shame, if men like unto our selves could
look into our hearts, and see how we dally and trifle with God, who will not
be mocked, Leuit. 10.
but (if they will not honor him) will honor himself in all that draw near
unto him.

CAP. XXVI.
Of the last private means of a godly life, which is, experimental knowledge.

. Sect. 1 What this experimental knowledge is, and the practice of it in many
examples.
THe last private means (whereof I will speak) which may help and enable us
to lead a godly life, is experimental knowledge, whereby we apply whatsoever
we know, either concerning God, or our selves, unto our own particular use,
and endeavor to profit by it in the practice of holiness and righteousness.
Thus we are not only to know that God is a gracious Father in Christ, as to
others, so unto us; but to labor to have the experience of it in our selves,
by feeling the beams of his fatherly love warming our hearts, and inflaming
them with unfeigned love toward God again, by observing his fatherly
providence watching over us, and how often we have been thereby powerfully
defended from our many and mighty enemies, delivered out of imminent dangers,
freed from many afflictions, when as we saw no means of escaping, and
graciously relieved and provided for in our wants and necessities, when we have
had no possible means to supply them. Thus knowing God to be Omnipotent in
power, we must labor to have a feeling experience of it in his continual
supporting us, both in respect of our souls and bodies, notwithstanding our
own frailty and weakness, in which we should have often perished, in respect
of the one through worldly dangers, and in respect of the other through
spiritual tentations, did not he sustain us with his might, and glorify his
power in our infirmities and 2. Cor. 12. 9.
weakness. And thus knowing God to be true of his word, yea truth it self, we
must labor to have the experience and feeling of it in our selves, by observing
how he has at all times made good his promises unto us, even then, when by
reason of some delay we have most doubted of them. Finally, knowing that he is
good and gracious, merciful and bountiful, both unto all his elect, and
particularly unto us, we must seek to confirm it unto our selves, by our
own experience, and by calling to mind how often he has pardoned our former
sins, and sealed this pardon in our hearts and consciences by the testimony
of his Spirit; how often we have tasted how good he is in the fruits of his
bounty, and in the sweet feeling thereof have had our hearts comforted and
refreshed. The which experience of times past, will much strengthen our faith
and hope Romans 5. 4.
for the time to come, make us wholly to depend upon him, and to consecrate and
deuote our selves to his worship and service, with all cheerfulness and
courageous resolution, notwithstanding all oppositions, seeing by manifold
experience we have found, that the God whom we serve, is Dan. 3.
most mighty to defend us, most gracious, true of his promises, and bountiful
in performance, richly rewarding all those who fear and depend upon him. Thus
knowing the virtue and efficacy of Christ's death, in taking away, by the
inestimable merit thereof, the guilt and punishment of our sins, we must
strive to find and feel it in our own experience, by observing how it has
been powerful and effectual in us, for the mortifying and crucifying of our
carnal lusts and sinful corruptions, which heretofore have ruled and reigned
in us. And this Paul means, when he says, that he desired to know nothing
but Jesus Christ, and him crucified; 1. Cor. 2. 2.
namely, this virtue and efficacy of it in himself, in the crucifying of his
flesh, with the lusts thereof, and not only to know the truth of it, which
might easily be attained unto by the relation and instructions of others. In
which sense he says in another place, that he accounted all things but loss,
Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10.
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, and that he labored
above all things to know him, and the power of his Resurrection, and the
fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; that is,
not barely to know these things, or to believe them by faith, but to have the
experience of the virtue of his Resurrection, in raising him from the death of
sin, to holiness and newness of life, giving him a full conquest over his
corruptions, and spiritual life and strength to serve God in some perfection.
Thus knowing the holy Ghost to be our sanctifier, we must never rest till we
have some good experience of it in our selves, in his purging us thorowout,
body and soul from all sinful pollutions, and in our spiritual renewing and
reforming according to Gods Image, in wisdom, holiness and righteousness.
Thus we must know the works of God both toward our selves and others, not
only by hearing, reading and discourse, but also by our own observation and
experience. How liberally from time to time he has rewarded our poor
endeavors, and imperfect service, with manifold blessings; and how he has
corrected our sloth, when as we have been cold and careless, formal and
negligent in his service with his fatherly chastisements. How he has visited
our sins with crosses and afflictions; yea special sins with special
punishments, which have sprung as fruits from those cursed roots, and by
following them as at the heels, have plainly showed from what causes they
came, or else have bin so fitted and proportioned unto them, in likeness and
similitude, that the correction has (as it were) by the hand led us to the
sight of our sin. And how upon our repentance and humiliation he has
graciously spared and freed us from our afflictions, when we least thought of
any deliverance. The which as it will notably preserve us from falling into
those sins, for which we have been formerly corrected; so when we have
fallen, it will effectually move us to rise out of them by unfeigned repentance;
and confirm thereupon our affiance in God, that seeing he is immutable 2. Cor.
1. 10.
in his goodness, he will now again be alike gracious upon our humiliation,
to deliver us from present and future evils. Thus also in Gods dealing with
others, we may have experience of his truth in his promises toward those that
fear and serve him, and in his threatenings against those that are wicked, who
make no conscience of their ways, but rebelliously sin against him; of his
Justice, by observing his Judgments, executed upon the wilful transgressors
of his laws, and his goodness and mercy toward those who endeavor to serve
and please him; whereby we Eccles. 8. 12.
shall be made fearful to offend him, and careful to carry our selves so in
an holy conversation, as that we may be accepted in his sight. And as this
experimental knowledge of God and his works, will be a notable means to
restrain us from all sin, and to further us in all the duties of a godly
life: so also the like knowledge of our selves, and our own courses and
actions, will be a singular help to the same ends; as when we not only know
that we are wholly corrupted in our souls and bodies with original sin, but
also experimentally feel the venom and vigor of it working in us, disabling
us unto all good duties, and making us prone unto all wickedness; whereby we
are made more careful in the use of all good means, by which we may be
enabled more and more to mortify and subdue it: when as we not only after a
general manner know our natural weakness and frailty, whereby we are often
overtaken with manifold actual sins, but also observe by particular
experience, our special slips and falls, what corruptions are most potent in
us, and unto what sins our nature is most prone, and wherewith we are most
often foiled, to the end that we may not rest upon our own strength, which so
often fails, but upon the power and promises of God; and with more feruency
crave the assistance of his holy Spirit, to strengthen us against our
corruptions, and to subdue their power, that they may not prevail against us
as in former times. When as we see that we are defective in all good duties,
we must also by experience observe unto what special duties we are most
auerse, and which we perform with most difficulty, bewraying in them our
greatest wants and imperfections; that so we may go about them with greatest
resolution, and use our best endeavors to perform them daily in more
perfection. When as we not only know that we are continually tempted by our
spiritual enemies, but also find by experience their particular tentations,
wherewith they most assault us, and most often foil and overcome us, that so
we may in these regards keep a more special watch, take more pains in
repairing these particular breaches, and arm our selves with more courage and
resolution to withstand them in the next incounters.

. Sect. 2 The experimental knowledge of our own estates, in respect of our
contrary courses.
Again, we are thus by our experience to mark and observe our selves, in
respect of our diverse and contrary courses in our lives and conuersations.
Psalm. 84. 11. and 27. 1, 3.
As when we are watchful over our ways to please God in all things, and
careful to serve him in all Christian duties, what singular blessings and
benefits we reap thereby. How we are comforted with Gods gracious presence,
and feel the beams of his love cheering our hearts, and the light of his
countenance so refreshing them, that no afflictions can dismay us; how our
faith is strengthened against all tentations, in the assurance of the remission
of our sins, and the salvation of our souls; how our heads are lifted up
with hope, joyfully expecting the performance of all Gods promises, even when
they are delayed; and how Psalm. 23. 4. and 3. 5. Joh. 14. 27. Romans 8. 31, 32,
etc.
confident we are in the midst of desperate dangers, in the assurance of Gods
presence and protection. What peace we have with God, and in our own
consciences, which passes all understanding, and how therein we triumph over
all worldly oppositions, and the worst that the might and malice of the devil,
and all his adherents can do against us. Finally, Ioh. 16. 27.
what rauishing and unspeakable joys replenish our hearts, which Romans 5. 3.
none can take from us, no not afflictions and persecutions, nor the dreadful
face of approaching death! On the other side, when we neglect our watch, and
are overtaken with any gross sins; when we carelessly omit the duties of Gods
service, or perform them slothfully and negligently, after a cold and formal
manner, we may out of experience observe, either how we are hardened through
the deceitfulness of sin, and lie snorting in carnal security, without any
sense or motion of spiritual life; or if our consciences be awakened, and we
come to some feeling of our wretched estate, how we are dismayed with the
absence of God, when he has withdrawn Cant. 3. 1. and 5. 6. Psalm. 23. 1.
Psalm. 32. 3. Psalm. 6. 1, 3, 6. Psa. 38. 1, 2, 3, 4. Psalm. 77. 2, 7, 8, 9.
Psalm. 88. 15.
from us the sense and feeling of his grace and favor; how we are terrified
with the apprehension of his wrath, and with the sight of our manifold and
grievous sins; how our faith is assaulted with doubting and incredulity, our
hopes vanished, our affiance weakened, yea oftentimes turned into diffidence
and distrust. Our peace disturbed with the accusations of a guilty conscience,
and our joy turned into sorrow and heaviness. Of both which estates when we
have had feeling experience, it will be an effectual means, as any other, to
make us flee all manner of sin, to strive continually against our corruptions
and imperfections, and to endeavor with all care and good conscience, to please
God in all things, and to perform unto him zealous service in all the duties
of a godly life.

. Sect. 3 That no knowledge is to be compared with this of experience.
In a word, there is no knowledge alike useful and profitable unto this, which
is seasoned by observation and experience. For as in civil affairs, that
knowledge which is gotten by reading and mental discourse, is of little use or
worth, until it be perfected by practice and experience; so is it much more
true in the knowledge of Christianity. We see that men by much reading and
speculation, attain unto great knowledge, but seldom to sound wisdom, which
has given way to that common Proverb, that The greatest Clerks are not the
wisest men. It is no less certain (though it may be less observed) that
speculatiue knowledge, not being seasoned with experience, does not make men
spiritually wise unto salvation; whereof it is that the great Doctors of the
world, who are richest in it, are commonly poorest in grace and godliness,
having no sense and feeling of those things, whereof in their learned
discourses they make a great show, and are well able to teach others that way
which themselves never traveled. It is not much reading, nor speculatiue skill
in the writings of State Policy, that will make a wise Counselor, and much
less a prudent Prince and Governor; but when this knowledge is seasoned with
experience, which teaches where the rules hold, and where they fail, and how
they are varied by circumstances, which being innumerable, cannot be
comprehended in any precepts, but are only to be determined by wise prudence,
which is gotten by experience. It is not only booke-knowledge that will make a
good General, or skillful Pilot; no not so much as a cunning Artificer; but
when this knowledge is perfected by practice and experience: and so surely,
though we abound never so much in litterall knowledge, it will be far from
making us good Christians, unless we bring precepts into practice, and by
feeling experience apply what we know, to our own particular use and benefit.
Yea, in truth amongst all those points of Religion which we comprehend even by
the saving knowledge of faith, those above all others are most sweet and
comfortable, useful and beneficial, which have been confirmed and sealed unto
us by most experience. A man truly wise, may clearly discern of good and
evil, and of that which is either safe or dangerous, and may not only believe
without any doubting what he knows, but may be able, by effectual reasons to
persuade others, either to embrace or shun them; and yet never come to a
sound use of his knowledge, till it be seconded and better cleared by
experience. As for example, he may know the danger of suretiship, and how many
men have been undone by it, losing not only their wealth, but also their
friends for whom they have been engaged, and yet be so blinded with deceiving
hopes, that with some little importunity he is content to be engaged: but if
his general notions be seasoned by experience, and if being left in the lurch,
he has found and felt the smart of his forwardness, afterward a threefold
Cable is not strong enough to draw him into bonds, and hazard himself unto so
many miseries. So a man may know that this or that meat may be dangerous and
of hard digestion, and yet be drawn by his appetite to feed upon it; but if
he have once surfetted, and have felt the smart of a tedious sickness which
has endangered his life, he is afterward alienated from it, both in judgment
and appetite, so that he will be sure to take heed of that dish, though he
will venture to feed on another no less dangerous in his opinion, but not
tried to be so by experience; and thus it is in all other dangers, which we
more carefully shun, as we have with more difficulty escaped out of them. So
contrariwise, that which our judgments approve as good, is not so much loved
and embraced, till we have by experience found it to be so unto us; neither
have we ever so much desire of the wholesomest food, though we know it to be
so, as when we have by experience found, that it is pleasing to our own
taste, and affoording unto us good nourishment, has been a notable means to
preserve our health, and increase our strength. And thus also it is in
spiritual things. Though we see the danger of our corruption, with the
manifold evils which do accompany them, and thereby are made careful in some
degree to avoid them, yet we may be overtaken, and with the violence of our
lusts and passions be drawn to fall into them: but if by experience we have
felt the smart of them, how their poison has wrought in our hearts, infeebled
our graces (as it were the vital spirits) and weakened and disabled us unto
all good duties, we will ever afterward mortally hate them, and more
carefully shun them then in former times. And contrariwise, though we know
and believe, that such graces and duties are excellent, and therefore to be
loved and embraced of us; yet shall we never do it with that ardency of
affection, as when we have tasted the sweetness of them in themselves, and
the manifold comforts and singular benefits which do accompany them; as peace
with God, and peace of conscience, assurance of Gods love and our own
salvation, inward refreshment and joy in the holy Ghost; and such other
blessings of like nature. All which considerations should povverfully
persuade us, not to content our selves with the knowledge of Christianity, but
to labor after the feeling and experience, the use and practice of what we
know, which will be a singular help to further us in all the duties of a godly
life.

CAP. XXVII.
Wherein is showed, that prayer is a singular means of a godly life.

. Sect. 1 That nothing more then prayer, makes us godly and religious.
HItherto we have spoken of those private means of a godly life, which are to
be used by our selves alone: and now it remains that we entreat of those
which we are to use both by our selves, and also together with others. The
first whereof is prayer, the which we have before handled in the chief parts
and points thereof: only here we are to show, that it is a powerful and
effectual means, whereby we are furthered in all the duties of a godly life.
To which purpose let us know that nothing can be more available to this end,
seeing there is not any thing which makes us more godly and religious, more
like unto God, and partakers of the divine nature, then this daily communion
and intercourse which we have with him. For as friendship, familiarity and
near society, arises amongst men, out of similitude of natures and manners;
and contrariwise, likeness of manners and conditions grows by degrees out of
friendly acquaintance, and common conuersing one with another; so that if we
usually keep company, and entertain conference with wicked men, we are made
wicked like them, by their society and corrupt communication, which poysoneth
our manners; but if we delight to converse and talk with those which are godly
and religious, we increase thereby in godliness and piety: so much more, if
we often have this communion and conference with God by prayer, who is
infinitely good in himself, and the Author and Fountain of all goodness
which is in the creatures, we shall daily increase in all piety and holiness,
and by conuersing with him (like Moses) shine in his light: whereas the further
we withdraw our selves from this Fountain of light and heat, goodness and
perfection, the more frozen shall we be in the dregs of our sins, the more
stony-hearted, and muddy-minded, and utterly unlike the divine nature. Prayer
(says one) causes marvelous effectually an holy life, and worthily fit for
Gods Piam vitam, ac Dei cultu dignam, miris modis oration conciliat, conciliatam
auget, ac ceu thesaurum recondit in animis, etc. Chrysostom. lib. de orando Deum,
Tom. 5.
service, and what it causes, it increases, and like a treasure, lays it up
in our minds. For if a man indeuoureth to do any thing appertaining to a
godly life, prayer being his guide, and preparing the way, he is sure to find
a commdious and easy passage, etc. It is a sign of madness, not to be
persuaded that it is the very death of the soul, if we do not often
prostrate our selves at Gods feet, who is the Author of life. For as our body
severed from the soul, is but a dead carcass; so the soul is dead and
miserable, if it approach not often unto God by prayer. And this the common
experience of all times has plainly proved; seeing those who (with David) have
been most exercised in this religious duty, have been also most holy, and men
according to Gods heart; those who have neglected it, most profane; and such
as have utterly contemned it, no better then wicked Atheists, God esteeming it
all alike, not to have him at all, and not to call upon him. And therefore the
Psalmist describes the Atheistical fool, that says in his heart, There is
no God, by this outward Psalm. 14. 1, 2, 4.
mark, that he never calls upon his Name; for if he acknowledged a God that
were able to help him, he would sue unto him when he needed his help.

. Sect. 2 That prayer is the means of obtaining all Gods gifts and graces.
Secondly, hereby it appears, that prayer is a most excellent and necessary
help unto a godly life, in that we are able to do nothing without Genesis 6. 5.
2. Cor. 3. 5. Phil. 2. 13.
it, but are enabled by it, to do in some measure whatsoever good thing we can
desire. For of our selves we are weak and impotent unto all duties, and all
the imaginations of our hearts being continually evil, we are not able to
think a good thought, or to entertain a holy desire; but it is the Lord only
who begins, continues, and perfecteth his work of grace and sanctification
in us, and inableth us to return unto him those works of holiness and
righteousness, which in respect of ability to perform Phil. 1. 6.
them, we have first received from him. So that if we tender unto him any good
duty, we may say with David, Of thine own have we offered 1. Chro. 29. 14.
unto thee. Now the means which God has ordained and sanctified for the
obtaining of any grace or help at his hand, whereby we may be strengthened
unto all duties of his service, is fervent and earnest prayer, Mat. 7. 7. Joh.
16. 23.
which he has appointed to be the hand of the soul, to receive from him all
gifts of grace and goodness. And though like a bountiful Prince, he offers
liberally unto us whatsoever we can lawfully desire, yet he will not deliver
his rich gifts to those who hold their hand in their bosom, and will not
vouchsafe to put it forth, that it may receive them. We are dry and empty
cisternes, who have naturally in us no drop of grace and goodness, but what we
receive from God, who is the inexhaustible fountain of every good and perfect
gift, as the Apostle tells us. Now as he Iam. 1. 17.
has appointed Christ to be the Conduit head, so prayer to be (as it were) the
Pipe, whereby he will convey unto us these waters of Life, which, if we
intermit not, he will richly replenish us with all his graces; but if we
neglect this holy duty, and yet imagine to receive any grace or spiritual
strength from him, it is all one, as if we should cut off the pipe, and yet
imagine to fill the empty cisterne.

. Sect. 3 That all the parts of prayer are singular helps to a godly life.
Finally, all the parts of Prayer severally serve as special means to further
us in the duties of a godly life. For first, the confession of our sins will
withhold us from the committing of them, whilst aggravating, bewayling, and
adiudging our selves for them to those fearful punishments which they have
justly deserved, our hearts are wrought unto a true hatred of them, when as we
see and acknowledge the miserable fruits which spring from this cursed root.
Secondly, because we cannot for shame commit those sins willingly, which we
have humbly confessed, and God has graciously pardoned. For what malefactor
is so impudent, as to commit those crimes again, which his Prince of mere
love has lately remitted, and whilst he has (as it were) his pardon in his
hand, especially when he knovveth that he must the next day again be arrained
for them, and stand at the bar at his Sovereigns mercy? Thirdly, because by
often confession we search out our hidden sins, and ransacke our hearts and
consciences, so as they cannot lie lurking in them, but are apprehended,
condemned, and drawn out to execution. Lastly, because upon our confession,
receiving at Gods hands assurance of pardon, Pro. 28. 13. 1. Ioh. 1. 7. Luke 7.
47.
according to his gracious promises; we cannot but entirely love him, who has
forgiven us so great a debt, whereby we shall be made loath to do any thing
which may displease him, and ready to perform all good duties which may be
acceptable in his sight. By petition also we have no less help, seeing
thereby we come to a more through sight of our wants, which works in us an
hungring and thirsting desire, that they may be supplied, and of our
imperfections in our best duties, that we may strive and labor after more
perfection, carefully and conscionably using all good means whereby our
desires may be satisfied, seeing if we should neglect them, after we have
made these earnest suites, we should both tempt the Lord, and discover our own
gross hypocrisy, in asking those things which we care not to obtain.
Again, by these suites and requests made unto God, according to his Luke 11.
13.
will, we receive the gift of his holy Spirit, which inableth us to all good
duties, by regenerating and sanctifying us, seeing God has promised to give
him unto those that ask him; and together with him we obtain all Gods
sanctifying gifts and graces, which by the same means are daily confirmed and
increased in us, and have such a quickening power, virtue, and vigor added unto
them, that they enable us to the constant performance of all Christian duties;
which otherwise lying dull and dead in us, we should become like a body
without spirits, lumpish and lazy in Gods service. Finally, by these suites
and requests our love is inflamed, upon our assurance that they are heard and
granted; which stirs us up to yield unto God cheerful obedience, our faith
is confirmed, and our affiance and hope strengthened, in assured confidence and
expectation of Gods help and assistance, which will uphold us when we are
ready to faint, enable us to overcome all difficulties, and to perform all the
duties of a godly life with much comfort and delight. Lastly, thanksgiving is a
singular help to the same end, whilst we recount and call to mind Gods
manifold blessings and rich mercies, which of mere grace, without any desert
of ours, he has from time to time multiplied upon us. All which (if we be not
too too ungrateful) will be so many strong bands of love, to tie us unto
obedience, and to make us cheerful in all Christian duties, seeing by them we
serve so bountiful a Master, which if we neglect to do, we shall play the
notable hypocrites, in professing that thankfulness with our lips, which we
neither have in our hearts, nor take any care to express in our lives.

CAP. XXVIII.
Of reading the Scriptures and other religious writings.

. Sect. 1 Who are to exercise themselves in this duty of reading.
THe second private means of a godly life, which may be used by our selves
alone, or with others, is reading, which is the perusing and studying of
religious writings, for the information of our judgments in the knowledge of
God and his truth, the sanctifying of our hearts and affections, and the
reforming of our lives and conuersations. The which exercise may be performed
when we are alone, by the sight of the eye, and the discourse of the mind,
either with or without the use of speech; but with all necessarily joined
together, when we perform this duty with others. In speaking whereof, let us
first generally observe, who are to read, and then the subject matter which is
to be read of them. For the first, all sorts and conditions of men without
exception, are tied to this duty, who are any way able to perform it, both
the learned and unlearned, the Ministers and common people, the poor and rich,
men and women, young, old, and of middle age: seeing the Lord in the Scriptures
has imposed it as necessary and profitable for all men. Thus he requires that
not only the Levites, but his whole people of Israel should continually study
in the Book of his Law, and take all good occasions to speak and talk of it
in all places; that they should bind the words of it Deuteronomy. 6. 7, 8, 9. Matthew.
22. 29.
for a sign upon their hands, and that they should be as frontlets between
their eyes, and that they should write them upon the posts of their house and
on their gates, to no other end, but that they might often take occasion
thereby to read and study them. Our Savior Christ also does exhort all to
search the Scriptures, and affirms this to be the cause of all errors Ioh.
5. 39.
both in judgment and manners, because men were not well acquainted with them.
And the Apostle Peter, writing generally to all, says, that having a more sure
word of prophecy (that is more infallible then any revelations) therefore they
did well that they did take heed unto it, as unto a 2. Pet. 1. 19.
light that shines in a dark place. And the Apostle writing unto the Romans,
says, that whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for Romans 15.
4. 2. Tim. 3. 15. 2 John ver. 1, 4.
our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might
have hope. The Apostle John likewise writing to children, young and old men,
plainly implies that no age is exempted; but even little children must read,
that they may be seasoned with the knowledge of Gods truth from their tender
age, like young Timothy, and the children of the elect Lady; and so being
trained up in the way which they should choose, when they are old, they will not
depart from it: and having this sound foundation of knowledge laid, they may
have the building of faith and piety more easily erected and set up in them.
And young men also must read the Scriptures, that being armed with this sword
of the Spirit, they may be the better enabled to resist the tentations of the
devil, the world and their own flesh, which in that age are most strong and
violent. Finally, old men, after they have gotten much knowledge, must still
diligently study the Scriptures, that they may be the better confirmed and
settled in the things which they know, recall those things to memory, which
that age otherwise is apt to forget, and that having known God and his Christ
from the beginning, not only by reading and hearing, but by much experience;
they may be refreshing and renewing this knowledge, be the better able to walk
themselves in this clear light, and guide and direct others also by their
fatherly instructions in the right way that they should choose. But yet in a
more special manner, this duty of reading the Law and Word of Deuteronomy. 17. 18,
19 Josh. 1. 8.
God is pressed upon Princes and Governors, that being enlightened with the
knowledge of Gods will and truth, they may themselves yield obedience unto it,
seeing hereby they shall not only save their own souls, but also be a
means of the salvation of many others, their lives and actions being
exemplarie, and powerful to draw those which are under them, to follow and
imitate them in that which is either good or evil: And also that having this
light to guide them, they may administer righteous judgment, and govern the
people committed to their charge, in the fear of the Lord, establishing
amongst them Gods true Religion, and maintaining in all their dominions justice
and truth. But above all others, the Ministers of Gods Word are religiously
bound to exercise themselves diligently in reading the Scriptures; seeing they
must not only have skill to direct themselves and their own families, but to
instruct all others committed to their charge, in the Word and will of God; for
the Priests lips Mal. 2. 7.
must preserve knowledge, and the people must seek the Law at their mouth; for
he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. And he principally more then ordinary
Christians, must give attendance to reading, exhortation and doctrine, 1. Tim.
4. 13, 16.
and continue in them; because in so doing, he shall both save himself and
those that hear him.

. Sect. 2 That we are chiefly to be exercised in reading and studying of the
Scriptures.
The second general point to be considered, is the subject matter of our
reading, of which we must make good choice, seeing it were much better not to
read at all, then to spend our time in perusing such books as are profane,
teaching nothing but vanity and lies, wantonness, ribaldry and contempt both
of Religion and common honesty; in which number are books of scurrilous jests,
plays and Machiauellian policy. For as we say in the proverb, Where God has
his Church, there the devil has his chapel; and apishly imitating the
divine Majesty, that he may blind his followers, get from them the like glory,
and especially that he may disgrace Gods holy ordinances; as God has his
Sacraments and Ceremonies, so he will have his to seal up to his vassals their
more assured condemnation. And as God has his books of holy Scriptures,
containing his will and Laws, for the sanctifying and governing of his people;
so the devil will have scribes inspired with his will, to set forth books of
hellish impieties and damnable policies, for the corrupting of men's judgments,
the poisoning of their hearts and manners, and the trayning up and governing of
his subjects in all sin and wickedness. And therefore all those who desire
to please God in the duties of a godly life, must with as much care flee such
books, as Mariners do the rocks and sands; and as they profess themselves
Gods servants, so they must make choice of such books as will better their
knowledge and practice in his Laws: as they profess themselves of the
Christian Religion, so they must read and study such books, as being
religious, will further them in Christianity, and enable them to perform unto
God more diligent and faithful service. In which respect, the Book of holy
Scriptures contained in the Old and New Testament, is to be preferred above all
others, seeing it is the foundation and ground of them all, which having God
for it Author, is of infallible truth, and is to be believed in its own sole
authority, and needs not the confirmation of reason, or any humane testimony,
but shines like the Sun in it own light. Whereas all writings of men who
are subject to errors, are only so far forth to be believed and embraced, as
they are consonant, and agreeable with it. For all men are liars, and through
their ignorance, subject to errors; apt to deceive, and to be deceived; and
therefore are no further to be credited, then as their sayings and works are
approved by the Canon and rule of Gods infallible truth. Besides that, the
Word of God is of more majesty, power and efficacy, then any mortal man's, and
his more immediate ordinance, which being more effectually assisted, and
wrought into our minds and hearts by his holy Spirit, is of greater efficacy
for the inlightening of our understandings, the mollifying of our hearts, the
strengthening of our Faith, and sanctifying of our affections, then all other
writings without it. And this David found by experience, professing, that by
studying and meditating in the Book and Law of God, he became wiser then the
Ancients, and of more understanding then his teachers. Psalm. 119. 9^, 100.


. Sect. 3 Their objection answered, who pretend the obscurity of the Scriptures.
Neither let any man pretend that the Scriptures are of such difficulty, and so
hard to be understood, that private men must not presume to Psalm. 19. 7, 8.
Pro. 1. 4.
read them; seeing they have plainly taught us, that the Law of the Lord
inlighteneth the eyes, and makes wise the simple. And wise Solomon tells us,
that this was one chief end of his penning that portion of holy Scripture,
that he might give subtilty (that is, more then common knowledge) to the
simple, and to the young man knowledge and discretion. So that though the
Scriptures find men simple and ignorant, yet they do not leave them so,
seeing they were purposely appointed by God to illuminate the eyes of the
blind, and to make the foolish wise. And therefore to forbear the reading of
the Scriptures, because we are rude and of small understanding, is all one, as
if we should refuse the medicine, because we are sick; the eye-salue, because
we are blind; and the light of the Sun, because we are in the dark or
dimsighted. It is true, that all places of holy Scriptures are not alike
clear, but though some be easy and plain, yet other are so high and
mystical, hard to be understood, and of such abstruse difficulty, that the
best wits and most learned may, even their whole lives, be exercised about
them, and yet never reach to their height, nor sound them to the bottom. But
this must not discourage the simplest from reading of them, because it is not
necessary, nor required of all, that they should understand every place, but so
much as is necessary for their salvation, and according to the measure of
their gifts, which they have Romans 12. 3.
received, which if they exceed, they come under the censure of curiosity and
presumption. And for the attayning of that maine end at which every one must
aim, the Books of holy Scriptures are fit to be read of all sorts of men,
being not only (as that learned Father observed) Augustine.
in many places a deep sea, wherein the Elephant may swim, but also in as many
others, shallow Foords, wherein the Lamb may wade. Yea so gracious is the
Creator and Redeemer of all men, that in penning the holy Scriptures, he has
taken care of the simple, as well as of the wise and learned. And as in course
of nature he has made those things most common, which are most excellent,
profitable and necessary, as the Sun, air, fire, water, bread and clothing,
and has only reserved to the rich and noble, peculiar privileges in things
of less use and necessity, as gold, silver, precious Jewels (so made and
called, not by nature, but by fantasy and opinion) silken garments, delicious
cates and such like trifles: So he has laid out in common the maine points of
Religion necessary to salvation, by making them so easy and familiar, that the
meanest capacities may comprehend them, if they will use the means and helps
which he has sanctified for this use; as fervent prayer for the assistance of
Gods Spirit to inlighten our blind eyes, reading, meditation, comparing one
place with another, the public ministry and private conference; And has
reserved other things less necessary in abstruse obscurity, as Chronologies,
Genealogies, quiddities and intricate questions, to exercise the curiosity of
such as scorn to be vulgarly wise, and would gain unto themselves an opinion
of their learning and knowledge. Yea even the same maine points of Religion,
which are in some places plainly expressed, to the capacity of the most
simple, are in other places more obscurely delivered, that all sorts of men
might be employed in this holy exercise of reading the Scriptures, the simple
having no cause of discouragement, by their difficulty; nor the learned, and
men of greater gifts, any cause of contempt or idle sloth, through their
easiness; but might have matter deep enough, to sound and search out, by
their greatest wit and most industrious endeavor. So one says, that the
Quamuis omnem scientiam and doctrinam sacra Scriptura sine aliqua comparatione
transcendat, etc. Gregor.
holy Scriptures, without comparison, excel all other science and learning;
for they publish and preach the Truth, call us to our heavenly Country, inuit
the heart of the Reader from earthly desires, to embrace heavenly excellencies;
the which are not so shut up in obscurity, that we need to fear them; nor so
open, that we should contemn them; but the more they are used, the less they
are loathed, and the more they are loved, the more they are studied, etc.
Notwithstanding even in this Paradise, which abounds with all manner of
flowers and medicinable herbs, fit for use, necessity and delight, there may
generally at all times be choice made of such as are most profitable and
comfortable, and specially upon several occasions. For howsoever all contained
in them be excellent and fit for diverse uses, so that no part in our reading is
always to be passed over and neglected, yet there are some places above
others, wherein we may have the food of our souls in greatest plenty and
variety, and better prepared for our weak stomakes. And though they admit of
no comparison with other writings, yet in themselves one part may excel
another, if not in respect of their Author or nature, yet in respect of our use
and edification; as containing and setting forth the maine points of our
salvation more fully and plainly then others. In which respect the Prophets
are to be preferred before the Books of Moses, as being a Commentary and
exposition of them. The Proverbs of Solomon, before diverse of them, as being
full fraught with heavenly Wisdom, and containing divine precepts and
counsels, fit to guide us in all our courses. And above them all, the Book of
the Psalms, as being the lively Anatomy of a true Christian in all estates
and conditions, a treasury of heavenly meditations, divine wisdom, holy
doctrines and precepts, and a clear glass, wherein we may see, how in all
estates and conditions God deals with his children, and they with him. And
finally, the New Testament is to be preferred before the Old, because God
therein has more clearly manifested himself and his will, the sending of our
Savior Christ, and the great work of Redemption wrought by him, with all the
means whereby we may be made partakers of him and all his benefits, Gods
spiritual graces in this life, and eternal salvation in the life to come. For
howsoever they are both all one in substance, and contain the same things, yet
with this difference in respect of us, that the Old Testament is the New hid
and shadowed, the New Testament is the Old unfolded and revealed.

. Sect. 4 That we must not read the Scriptures only, but also other religious
writings.
But though a Christian man is to study and read the holy Scriptures chiefly,
that he may out of them, as out of the fountain, know God and all the duties
of a godly life, in which respect their practice is absolutely to be condemned,
who are so wholly taken up in reading the Fathers, Schoolmen, and late Writers,
that they can find little time to read and meditate in the Book of God, and
so are greatest strangers where they should be best acquainted, and like ill
merchants who buy all their wares at the second or third hand: yet we are not
so wholly to be conversant in them, as to neglect or to want time to peruse the
writings of godly and learned men, who by the help of their fervent prayers,
the gifts of learning and tongues, and their serious studies and diligent
labors, have given the true sense and meaning of them, and have distinctly
handled and cleared the maine points of Religion contained in them. Not that
the Scriptures do not themselves sufficiently teach all things necessary unto
salvation, without any humane addition; but because the Lord, intending to use
the ministry of his servants the Prophets and Pastors of his Church, for the
edification of his people, has caused them to be so penned, as that there
should be continual use both of their expositions and application. Which whosoever
contemn or neglect, and content themselves with the sole reading of the
Scriptures, if they be not of eminent parts, and endued with a great measure of
spiritual understanding, they will but slowly proceed in the growth of their
knowledge, nor without much labor, and long study, attain unto any great
perfection, though they may get some such competency as is necessary to
salvation. For many eyes see more then one, and great works are effected more
speedily and easily, that are set forward with the help of many hands. And
therefore I cannot commend their course, though otherwise they be godly and
religious, and much less those who set them in it, that neglect the reading of
all others books besides the holy Scriptures, because they have
all sufficiency in them; though in respect of the public means they much
prefer (as they have good cause) the Word sincerely and soundly preached,
before the Word barely read; notwithstanding that this public reading is to be
preferred before private, as before I have showed. As though children should
content themselves with the whole loaf of bread, or joint of meat, because
they have in them sufficient nourishment, and refuse to have it cut out and
carved unto them, unless it be at a public feast, because, with much ado,
they can twitch and pull some little pieces and fragments from them, which may
be enough to hold life and soul together. But let such know, that howsoever
the Scriptures contain all things necessary to salvation; yea, are sufficient
to save the most ignorant, through the inward illumination of the Spirit, where
all other helps and means are wanting, yet where these are to be had, they
will be less sufficient and effectual to us, if we neglect them, seeing the
Lord grants them unto us to this end, that we should use them for the
clearing of those places that are obscure, and for the enforcing and applying
of those points that are more plain, for the discussing of doubtful cases,
and for the laying open of many points of doctrine, necessary for our direction
in the course of a godly life; which being many of them not manifestly
expressed, but implied and to be gathered by necessary consequence, it is not
within the reach of every ones capacity, to gather them sufficiently by their
own reading and meditation, especially if they neglect wilfully those helps
which the Lord graciously does offer unto them.

. Sect. 5 Some special directions for the choice of fit Authors which may
help us in the practice of godliness.
Now amongst those innumerable books which are set forth by learned and godly
men, we must use singular care to choose such as are most profitable for our
edification. As those first and before others, which are sufficient to inform
our judgments in the maine points of Christian Religion, the knowledge whereof
is necessary to salvation. Of which we may have plentiful choice, both those
which handle all these points more briefly and compendiously; as Doctor Nowels
Catechism, Master Bezaes Confession, questions and answers, Doctor Hall,
Doctor Burges, and Master Balls Catechismes, A brief method of Catechizing,
The way to true blessedness, and many others; and such as handle the same
points more fully and largely: as Virels Catechism, Bastingius, The sum of
sacred Divinity, A treatise of Christian Religion, Vrsinus Catechism, Caluins
Institutions, and the Works of our reverend Countreyman Master Perkins, who
has excellently handled the most points of Christian Religion, in his learned
and religious writings. And having thoroughly informed our judgments, by reading
and studying some of these, or others of like nature, which by the light of our
own judgments, or help of others directions, we think fittest for us, we
may then also profitably peruse other writings, which may further and direct us
in the duties of piety and of a godly life. As Master Rogers his seven
Treatises; or if they seem too long for our little leisure, the abridgement of
them, the which is so exactly done, that in my judgment it fully comprizeth in
it the whole sum and substance of them all, with the addition of many other
particular points and proofs: Or another entitled, Directions to a godly
life, gathered out of the same 7. Treatises. Besides, other books in our own
language, which as excellently as in any other, handle both learnedly and
religiously, many special parts of Christianity, and particular discourses,
tending to piety, which are most perswasiue, pithy and profitable, to further
us in all the duties of a godly life. Amongst which, I cannot but commend unto
thee (Christian Reader) that plain and familiar exposition of the ten
Commandments, with all other works of the same Authors. The works of those
reverend servants of God, Master Greenham, Master Arthur Dent, and of my late
worthy assistant, Master Daniel Dike, who shall be ever unto me of happy
memory; in whose Treatises nothing seems wanting, which piety, learning and
wit could add unto them. And finally, the works of our famous and divine
English Seneca, in Doctor Hall.
which, wit and piety are so matched, as that they seem to strive which should
exceed the other. Many other labors of worthy men might be added, some of
which still remain as excellent ornaments and lights in Gods Church, and some
are at rest with the Lord, and have received the Crown of their labors, but
that I would not too much increase mine own book with naming other men's, and
also because I thought it fit to leave some to the Readers choice, and to the
advice of others, which upon notice of their estates can direct them better.
Only aiming at mine own maine end of persuading all to the duties of a godly
life, let me give this general rule to be observed, that we rather make
choice of such books, as do soundly inform the judgment, and work
powerfully upon the heart and affections, then of such as containing little but
idle eloquence and frothy conceits of wit, do nourish in the Reader, vain
curiosity, and please his fantasy with fruitless flashes. Yea, I would
persuade the devout Christian (to whom I chiefly write) who labors more
after piety, then learning and speculatiue knowledge, that they would
principally read such books, as will make them more holy and religious,
rather then more learned; and such experimental Divinity, as will fit and
further them for Christian practice, rather then for discourse. Neither can I
commend to such the studies of Genealogies, Chronologies and controversies,
except having begun with those before-named, they have not only leisure
sufficient for the other also, and excellent wits and parts to comprehend and
profit by them; but also live in such places which are infected with errors,
schisms, and heresies, where, in respect of their company, they shall need to
be extraordinarily confirmed and strengthened, that they may be able to defend
the truth, and to confute and convince gainsayers; yea if it be possible, to
persuade and gain them, that they may embrace the same truth which they
profess. In which case I would commend unto them the learned writings of B.
Jewel, against Harding; of Doctor Fulke, and especially his answer to the
Rhemish Testament, Doctor Reynolds conference with Heart, Master Perkins his
Reformed Catholic; Doctor Abbots learned defense of it against Bishop, Doctor
Whites Way to the true Church, and Doctor Willets Synopsis, which comprizeth in
it the sum of many others, and learnedly disputes and discusseth the most
points in controversy between us and our adversaries. Otherwise I should
persuade those whose maine aim is to inform themselves in the duties of
godliness, that they may practice them in their lives, to be more sparing in
the study of Controversies, seeing if they clearly see the perfect rule of
truth, it will enable them to discern the crooked errors which are contrary
unto it, it being such a light, as not only shows it self, but also all
falsehood which is opposite and oppugneth it.

CAP. XXIX.
Of our preparation unto this exercise of reading, and what is required in it.

. Sect. 1 That we must come in reverence to this holy exercise, and bring faith
unto it.
ANd thus having generally showed both who are to exercise themselves in
reading, and the subject matter which they are to read; we are now to entreat
of the duty it self; and then to show that it is an excellent help and means
of a godly life. In the duty we will consider the preparation unto it, and then
the action or exercise of reading, with some directions by which we may be
enabled to perform it with fruit and benefit. In our preparation our care must
be, to fit our selves that we may perform this religious duty in a right
manner, and not to go about it rashly and unadvisedly, never so much as once
thinking to what end we undertake it, but only reading to spend the time,
because we want some other employment. And first, we must come unto this duty
with all reverence, and perform it as in Gods presence, and as being one of
his gracious ordinances, whereby hereuealeth himself and his will more clearly
unto us, for the edifying and building of us up in all grace and godliness.
Secondly, we must bring faith with us; for as it is said of the Word heard, so
may it also of this, namely, that the Word which we read will not profit us,
unless it Heb. 4. 2.
be mixed with faith in those that read it. The which is to be understood
first generally of justifying faith in Christ, which is required in all our
actions, that they may be pleasing to God, and more specially in this, seeing
if Christ be not in us by his Spirit and a lively faith, both to open the blind
eyes of our minds, that we may see and understand, as he did the eyes of
Saul, Act. 16. Luke 24. Apoc. 5. 5.
and our hard hearts shut up in sin, as he did the heart of Lydia, and of the
two Disciples going to Emaus, yea, if this Lion of the Tribe of Judah do not
open the sealed Book, we shall see, and not perceive; read, and not
understand. Besdies which, we must bring a more special faith, whereby we are
made ready to believe and embrace every truth of God, and to apply it for our
own use, as doctrines of truth for our instruction, threatenings for our
humiliation, promises for our confirmation in faith, consolations for our
comfort, and so in the rest. But in respect of this faith, there must be some
difference in the act of it, as it believes the Scriptures, and as it
believes the writings of men, although most godly and learned. For as these
are not to be read with equal reverence and esteem unto the other, so neither
in all respects with the like faith. For we must believe the Scriptures with an
absolute faith, without any doubting or dispute of reason, and without other
confirmation or appeal to further trial, because they are the Word of God, who
being Truth it self, can neither deceive, nor be deceived. But all other
writings of men must be read with a reserved faith, believing them only so
far forth, as upon due trial and examination we find their sayings
consonant and agreeable to Gods Word, and grounded upon his infallible truth,
as upon a sure foundation. For we all being but imperfectly enlightened, do
know only in part; and therefore being subject to errors, others also that
should build their faith upon our Luke 8. 15.
authority, should err with us.

. Sect. 2 That we must bring honest hearts, and earnest desires to profit by
this exercise.
Thirdly, we must bring with us good and honest hearts, that so the seed of the
Word being sown in them as in good grounds, it may take deep Psalm. 50. 16, 17.
root, and bring forth in us plentiful fruits. Whereby I understand, not only
an heart purified by faith, and purged from sinful corruptions by true
repentance, without which we should not presume to take Gods word and Covenant
into our mouths; but such an one as is replenished with sincere affections and
holy desires, as after all Gods graces, so especially that we may profit by
this present exercise, without which we may long read, and yet be never the
better or holier; like those who eating their meat without an appetite, are,
after much feeding, never the fatter. Unto such the saying of Solomon may be
fitly applied: Wherefore is there a Prou. 17. 16.
price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he has no heart to it?
For though they abound in leisure, and have the sight and perusing of many
excellent books, yet they purchase by them no spiritual grace, because they
have no such desire or end, when they set themselves to reading, but because
they are weary of idleness, or for curiosity, that they may see what every one
is able to say, or to get speculatiue knowledge, that they may be fitted to
entertain discourse. But if we would have any good by our reading, we must
come to it with a mind and desire to profit by it; to have the graces of Gods
Spirit increased in us, to have our minds more enlightened with the saving
knowledge of God and his will, to have our faith, affiance, hope, love, zeal,
and all other Gods gifts and graces confirmed, nourished and enlarged in our
hearts, that we may express them in our lives, by increasing daily in
bringing forth the fruits of holiness and righteousness. For if these desires
be wanting, though we should do nothing else but read the Scriptures, and
other religious books; yea, though we were (like many of the Jews) so
conversant in the Book of God, that we could say the most of it by heart, and
were able to tell precisely how many words and letters were contained in it;
all this would yield unto us no spiritual nourishment, nor make us to thrive
any whit in grace and godliness.

. Sect. 3 That we must come with a purpose to make good use of all we read.
Finally, in our preparation, we must come to reading, with a purpose and
resolution to draw all we read unto our own particular use, either for the
informing of our judgments, or sanctifying of our affections, or reforming of
our lives, by putting those good duties in practice which we know and learn.
The which purpose David expresses in these words, Teach me, O Lord, the way of
thy Commandments, and I will keep them unto Psalm. 119. 33.
the end. Otherwise we can have no assurance that God will by our reading
inlighten our minds, and increase our knowledge: for why should be give us
more, if we make no good use of that we have? Yea, why should he not rather
take away his Talent, if we hide it unprofitably in a napkin? or at least,
leave it with us to increase our account, and with it our punishment? for the
servant that knows his Masters will, and does it not, shall be Luke 12. 47.
beaten with many stripes. Let therefore (as one exhorts) the holy Scriptures
Sint ergo divine Scripture semper in manibus tuis, and iugiter mente vol^^ntur,
etc. Hyer. a(...). I^^ Scripturas sacras lege, vt semper memineris Dei illa
verba esse, qui legem su^m non solum sciri, sed etiam impleri iubet, etc. Ad
Demetriad.
be always in thy hands, and meditate on them in thy mind; yet do not think
it sufficient for thee to have Gods Laws in thy memory, if thou forgettest
them in thy works, but therefore know them, that thou may do what thou
know; for not the hearers of the Law are just before God, but the doers of
it are justified. And as the same Author persuades in another place; So read
the holy Scriptures, as that thou always remember them to be the Word of God,
who requires not only that we should know his Law, but also fulfill and obey
it. For it profits not to know such things as ought to be done, and not to
do them. Thou use well thy reading of Divinity, if thou set it as a
glass before thee, that thy soul may behold it self by looking in it, and
may either amend deformities and blemishes, or more adorn it self, where it
is already beautiful.

. Sect. 4 That we must pray before we read.
Lastly, that we may perform both the preparation and action the better, we
must lift up our hearts (and when in respect of place and company we
conveniently can) our voice also, desiring in some short and pithy prayer, that
the Lord will assist us in this exercise by his grace and holy Spirit, that
thereby it may become effectual for the inlightning of our minds with saving
knowledge, the informing of our judgments, the sanctifying of our affections,
the nourishing and increasing of our faith, repentance, and all sanctifying
graces, and the strengthening of us in the inner man, unto all the duties of a
godly and Christian life, to the glory of his holy Name, and comfort and
salvation of our souls, through our Lord Jesus Christ. The which invocation of
Gods holy Name is necessary before the reading of the Word; for we are
naturally blind, and therefore had need to pray with David; Open mine eyes, O
Lord, that I may see the wonderful things of the Law. Naturally we understand
not the things Psalm. 119. 18.
of the Spirit of God, neither can we know them, because they are spiritually
discerned, 1. Cor. 2. 11, 14.
and it is only the Spirit of God that knows the things of God, and Luke 11.
13.
reuealeth them unto us, which we can no otherwise hope to obtain, then by
fervent and effectual prayer.

CAP. XXX.
Of the duties required in the action of reading, that we may profit by it.

. Sect. 1 Of the ends at which we must aim in our reading.
ANd thus much concerning those things which are required in our preparation.
In the action of reading, diverse points are to be considered. The first is, the
ends which we must propound unto our selves in it. Which are either principal
or subordinate. The principal end which we must aim at in this exercise, is
the glory of God, namely, that hereby knowing his will, we may glorify his
holy Name, by yielding obedience unto it, and by putting in practice the things
which he requires in the whole course of our lives and conuersations. The
subordinate end, is generally the edification of our selves and our brethren,
and the salvation of their and our own souls; according to that of the
Apostle; Attend unto reading, 1. Tim. 4. 13, 16.
and continue therein; for in so doing, thou shall both save thy self, and
those that hear thee. More especially, we must read the Scriptures to those
ends for which the holy Ghost has commended them unto us, as useful and
profitable. And first, for doctrine and instruction; in which regard, 2. Tim.
3. 16.
we are to read them for the further inlightning of our minds, and informing
of our judgments, in the knowledge and acknowledgement of Gods will, that we
may be directed thereby in all our ways, for the leading of our lives in such
a course as may in all things be acceptable unto God. For we are naturally
blind and ignorant, and walking in darkness, and in the shadow of death, we
know not what to choose and what to refuse, but the Word of God is a lamp unto
our feet, and a light unto our Psalm. 119. 105.
paths, which shining unto us in this darkness, guides our feet into the way
of peace. Of which light if we deprive our selves, we shall pass our Luke 1.
79.
lives in a more then Egyptian darkness, and groping at noone day, shall
easily be misled into all sin and error, according to that of Solomon; for
the soul to be without knowledge, it is not good, and he who (wanting Pro. 19.
2.
this light to guide him) hastes with his feet, sins, being ready to
deceive, and be deceived. The second end at which we must aim in our reading,
is, that we may be established in the truth, being enabled to defend it, and
also to refute and convince the errors and false doctrine which are contrary
unto it, especially those wherewith it is most oppugned in the times and places
wherein we live. For if we be conversant in the Scriptures, we shall be able
to try the Spirits, whether they be of God or no, 1. Job. 4. 1.
and not receive all we hear hand over head, and so be carried away with every
wind of doctrine, but to bring them to be tried with the Touchstone of Gods
truth, and with the Bereans to search the Scriptures, and by Act. 17. 11.
them, to examine whether the things we hear be so or no. The third end at
which we must aim, is admonition, that we may be able to check our selves
when we are going out of the way, and both take and give warning to our selves
and others, when either they or we are entering into errors in doctrine and
practice, that we may be reclaimed, and not proceed Heb. 10. 24.
in them to our further detriment. The fourth end, is reproof and rebuke, that
we may be able out of the Scriptures to apply Gods threatenings and checkes unto
our selves and others, when as either we or they do live in any known sins
without repentance, that so we may by strong hand be pulled (like firebrarnds)
out of the fire, and not suffered to perish by Gods approaching Judgments. The
fifth and last special end, which the Apostle expresses in another place, is
comfort and consolation, that we may be able to cheer up our fainting and
drooping hearts, and to strengthen Romans 15. 4.
our weak hands and knees, against the manifold discouragements which affront
us in our Christian course, whether they be inward or outward, as our own
sins, and the anger of God due unto them; our corruptions, wants, and
imperfections in our best actions; the tentations of our spiritual enemies,
afflictions, and persecutions; against which, and all others, the Scriptures as
a rich Treasury, afford unto us plentiful consolation, which being rightly
applied, will sufficiently harten us to go on with comfort and joy in the
ways of godliness. And as in our reading we Joh. 17. 17.
must aim at these particulars, so generally, that we may be sanctified with
this Word of Truth thorowout, both in souls and bodies, and that 1. These. 5.
23.
we may be made perfect, being thoroughly furnished unto all good works. 2. Tim.
3. 17.


. Sect. 2 That we must observe the Theme and Argument.
The second point to be considered, is the manner how we may so carry our selves
in this exercise, as that we may perform it with most fruit and benefit; to
which purpose the directions following may not unprofitably be observed. As
first, we are diligently to mark the Theme, question, or main point which is
handled in that Book or Chapter which we read, and how the discourse of the
Aurthor tends to prove or illustrate it, with the several arguments which
are produced to this end. Or if we want skill to do this, yet we may observe,
if not by our own collection, yet by help of the Authors pains, the sum
and substance of all which, he delivers in the contents of the Chapters or
Sections, which will give great light to the understanding of all the rest,
when as we know the main scope at which he aymeth, and how he frames his
discourse, and what arguments and testimonies he uses to prove or enforce
that point which he propounds. To which purpose, it is also profitable to The
second Rule.
observe (as near as we can) what was the occasion of the Authors writing, and
to consider the circumstances of the persons to whose use the writings were
intended, and of the times wherein he wrote, with the state of the people that
lived in them, unto what sins they were most addicted, and in what virtues
and duties they were most defective; and how the Author cries down the one,
and persuades them to the other. The order also and method which he uses, the
coherence of the parts of his discourse, and how he passes from one point to
another, will give much light to the understanding of what we read; which if
we neglect, and consusedly go on, iumbling all together, we shall make even
those things which are plain and easy, hard and intricate; observe little in
much reading, and remember less, and reap little profit by much pains.

. Sect. 3 That we must observe a due order in our reading, and make choice of
fittest Authors.
With like care we must observe a due order in our own reading, making choice
of such Authors as are fittest for our own capacity and use, and so proceeding
by degrees from those which are most easy, to such as are more difficult, as
we increase in knowledge and understanding. First, our care must be to lay a
sure foundation, by reading diligently some profitable Catechism, containing
the maine points of Christian Religion, not thinking it to be read
sufficiently, although we have gone over it diverse times, till we so thoroughly
understand and remember it, that we are able to give an account, though not in
the same words, yet in respect of the matter and substance, of all the points
contained in it, and as the Apostle speaks, to give a reason of our faith and
hope, 1. Pet. 3. 15.
whereby we shall not only be armed against all errors and lies, when as we
are able to examine all we read, according to the rule and analogy of faith,
but also shall with much more ease understand all other discourses, which
without this help will be dark and obscure. For want of which order observed
in reading, it is pitiful to see how many that think themselves great
proficients, and even able to teach others, not being thus grounded, are easily
carried away with every wind of doctrine, and being themselves deceived, for
want of skill to examine what they read and hear, are ready also to deceive
others. So impossible a thing it is to amend such errors as are committed in
the foundation, though we be never so curious in the rest of the building.
But though our first care must be in laying the foundation, yet we must not
rest there, but proceed and go forward, till we be built up in knowledge unto
some perfection; we must not, whilst we are babes in Christ, out of pride and
curiosity, affect strong meats, which are of too hard disgestion for our weak
stomachs, but hunger after 1. Pet. 2. 1, 2.
the sincere milk of the Word, and maine principles of Christian Religion.
With which, when we are well nourished and grown to some strength, we must,
as the Apostle says, leave the principles of the Doctrine Heb. 6. 1.
of Christ, namely, the foundation of repentance from dead works, and faith
toward God, etc. and go on unto perfection; and study both the holy
Scriptures, and such Authors as those beforenamed, which will thoroughly instruct
us in the whole body of divinity. In which, when we have made some good
proceedings, we shall be fit to read Treatises of any argument, which more
thoroughly handle special parts of Religion, wherein we desire to be specially
informed, or to have them effectually pressed upon our hearts and consciences.

. Sect. 4 That the devout Reader is not to read many books of the same
argument, but to make choice of some few which are best.
The fourth rule of direction, which I would commend to the devout Christian in
his reading, for the better inabling of him in the duties of a godly life (for
I do not take upon me to prescribe directions unto the learned in their
studies, but rather desire to be directed by them) is, that they make choice,
not of many books of the same argument, but of such as either in their own
judgments and experience, or by the direction of others, they know to be best
and fittest, for the informing of their judgments, in all things necessary for
their salvation, and sanctifying of their hearts and affections, and that they
do not so much affect the reading of many Authors, as to study thoroughly those
which they do read, and by distinguishing them through serious meditation, to
turn them in wholesome nourishment for the preserving of their spiritual
health, and the strengthening of them in all the graces of Gods Spirit. For
there is no end of making, so neither of reading many books; and much reading
in this kind, is a weariness to the flesh. Eccles. 12. 12.
And therefore as those which are invited to a great feast, do not, if they
have care of their health, eat a little of every dish, or more then their
stomachs can well digest, seeing the superfluities would turn to crudities,
and breed ill humors and obstructions in the body: so in that great variety
of spiritual food, which in these days is set before us, cooked and dressed
after diverse manners, it is not the best course for a Christian, who has a
care of his souls health, to feed of many or more then he is able by
meditation to digest, seeing this would but the more weaken and confound the
memory, and unsettle his judgment, so as he cannot tell what to take and what
to leave, and fill his mind with raw conceits and indigested opinions; but to
make choice of some of the most approved Authors in every kind, and to study
thoroughly, till he has turned them to good nourishment, and does feel his
soul refreshed and strengthened by them. And as it is not the best way for any
that intends to make himself a good Statesman, to ramble and run over in
his travails, many countries, seeing much, and making use of little for the
improuing of his knowledge and experience in State-policie; but rather to stay
so long in every place, till he have noted those things which are best worthy
his observation; so also is it in the travails and studies of the mind, by
which if we would be bettered in our judgments and affections, it is not our
best course to run slightly over many things, taking only such a general view
of them, as somewhat increases our speculatiue knowledge; but to rest upon the
points we read, that we may imprint them in our memories, and work them
into our hearts and affections, for the increasing of saving knowledge, which
chiefly consists in feeling and experience. Which course if we take, we
shall profit more by one good book often read, and thoroughly pondered, then by
running over a multitude after a superficial manner. For if men of ordinary
capacities and memories can hardly in once or twice reading of a book, attain
unto the true sense and meaning of the Author, nor comprehend many of his
notions and main intentions, in all the particulars of his discourse, in their
understandings only; especially considering that the mind of the most
diligent reader is often carried away with distractions of many kinds; how
much less is it possible to convert these spiritual treasures, at the first
view, to all their special and several uses, to lay them up orderly in our
memories, that when we have most need, we may know where to find them, to
work them into our hearts and affections, that we may have sense and feeling
of their fruit and benefit, for inward sanctification and outward practice in
the duties of godliness?

. Sect. 5 That we must labor to understand thoroughly what we read.
The fifth point to be observed in this exercise is, that we read with
understanding, and that having made choice of such books as are within the
compass of our capacity, we do not content our selves with a slight perusal,
but that we thoroughly understand what we read, and not pass to a new point,
till we see in some sort the meaning of that we last had in hand. The which
rule has place chiefly in reading of the Scriptures privately by our selves,
wherein it is better to read five words with the understanding, then ten
thousand when we understand the meaning of them no more, then if they were 1.
Cor. 14. 19.
written in a strange language. In which regard their practice brings little
profit, who set themselves (as it were) to their task, in reading over the
Bible every year, and so many Chapters every day, if they rest in the deed
done, and have little care how they do it, and take more pains in reading
over the words, then in attaining to their meaning; unto whom, if Philips
question to the Eunuch were propounded; Understand thou what thou read?
they were not able to shape unto it so good an answer; seeing they want not so
much an Acts. 8. 30.
interpreter to expound dark prophecies, as an intentive and industrious
mind, setting it self to understand what it is able by study to comprehend.
The which I speak not to discourage any in this exercise (far be it from me
to quench the smoking flax) but rather to persuade them to continue it still
with more fruit and benefit, the taste and feeling whereof can only make them
constant in it; for who delights long to feed on that meat, wherein he
finds no relish or sweetness? neither is it my meaning, that in reading
the Scriptures, men of ordinary callings and gifts should tie themselves to
understand all they have read, before they proceed further; for many points
are so deep and mystical, that for the understanding of them, they will
thoroughly exercise the greatest learning and best wits, yea oftentimes, even
such with much study shall not be able to comprehend them: but only I would
not have any negligently to slight over what they read, but seriously to apply
their minds to understand as much as they can; and as for places of
difficulty, they are not by them to be stopped in their course of reading, (as
it were with blocks lying in their way) but to pass by them unto more easy
and plain passages, unless their leisure, learning and liberty will afford
them the help of some good Commentary to clear their doubt. Only they may
take notice of such difficult places, as they think would, if they were well
understood, be most profitable for their use, and seek to be resolved of
them, by some of more knowledge and learning, and chiefly of their own
Minister, whose lips should preserve knowledge, that the people committed to
his charge, may seek the Law at his mouth. Mal. 2. 7.
Wherein notwithstanding two cautions are to be observed: first, that the
points wherein they desire resolution, be not slight and triuiall, but of
special moment and use, seeing it is not fit that their Pastor, who is to
apply himself in his studies for the public service of the Congregation,
should spend too much of his time in giving satisfaction to every particular
man, that comes unto him in every vselesse doubt, wherein he should be wholly
taken up, and made unserviceable unto the rest of his charge. In which respect
it is also fit, that men should make choice of such times, when as he is
usually most free from his own serious imploiments, and not (as it is the
custom of many) when as themselves are at best leisure. And secondly, that
they do not presently run unto him at the first appearing of any difficulty,
but after they have used their best endeavors, to satisfy their doubts by
their own serious studies. For if it were unreasonable amongst the Ancients
(as Plutarch records) to borrow water of their neighbors, until they had
first dug to the clay, using their labor and endeavor to find a spring in
their own grounds for their own use; by the same reason it may be thought as
unfit to trouble others (at least unseasonably) about resolving our doubts,
till our selves have endeavored (though in vain) to resolve them by our own
studies.

. Sect. 6 That we must join with our reading, serious Meditation.
The sixth rule of direction in our reading, is, that we join with it serious
meditation, pondring and weighing well the point in hand, before we pass to
another, when we find it of special use; either that we may more fully
conceive it in our understanding; if it be a material thing which we knew not
before; or better imprint it in our memories, if knowing we had forgotten it;
or work it into our hearts and affections, if we had not a lively sense and
feeling of it; or fruitfully practice it in our lives, if we have formerly
neglected it, especially when as we find it powerfully pressed by the Author
upon the heart and conscience. And thus it is profitable, after that we have
privately read a Chapter of the Bible, to meditate a while upon it, and to
recall unto our remembrance what remarkable things we have observed for the
better informing of our judgments and sanctifying of our hearts. As what
doctrine we have learned for our better instruction; what error in our
judgment has been refuted; how we have been admonished or reproved for any
sin, which we are prone unto or have committed; what promises made to any
virtue and grace or holy duty, for our better encouragement to embrace and
practice it; what threatenings against vice and sin to withdraw us from them,
or to move us to rise out of them by repentance, if we have fallen into them;
what examples we have observed of Gods Judgments upon the wicked for their
sins, or of his blessings and benefits upon the faithful, whereby he has
richly rewarded their service, and thereby encouraged us to follow them in
their holy practice; what gracious deliverances we have noted of those who have
trusted in God, for the confirmation of our Faith and affiance in him; finally,
what comforts and consolations, we have observed to encourage us in Gods
service in the midst of all afflictions and persecutions. Which course if we
should take in our reading, it would not be much less profitable then
meditation, of which we have before entreated, seeing it would not only
increase our knowledge, and inlighten our minds, but also work the things
known into our hearts and affections, and move and enable us to put them in
practice in our lives. Whereas though we read much, and do not use this help,
it is but like the eating of much meat, that is never disgested in the
stomach; which may puff men up with the wind of speculatiue knowledge, but
seldom 1. Cor. 8. 1.
turns unto any wholesome nourishment. But yet this duty of meditation after
reading, cannot be performed to any purpose, unless another go before it,
which is to use, whilst we are readding, all attention of mind unto the
things read, that we may not only conceive and understand them, but orderly
dispose and lay them up as we go, in our memories, that afterward we may
recall them into remembrance, and so more thoroughly weigh and ponder them. To
which end we must in this exercise (as much as in us lies) banish out of our
minds all worldly distractions and wandering thoughts, that we may wholly intend
the action in hand. And this the Apostle seems to imply, where he exhorts
Timothy not simply to read, but to attend unto reading, setting himself so
seriously about it, as that no other 1. Tim. 3. 13.
thing in the mean while should withdraw him from it, either in respect of the
maine duty, or right manner of performing it.

. Sect. 7 That we must read with affection and devotion, applying all to use.
The seventh rule is, that we read with affection and devotion, applying all
unto our selves, according to the nature of the subject matter for spiritual
use; framing and fashioning our hearts unto it, and changing and varying our
affections, as the matter is varied and changed. For that counsel which one
gives for the reading of the Psalms, may in the perusing of other parts of
Scripture and holy writings, be profitably observed. If (says he) the Psalm
prays, do ye also pray; if it mourns, Et si orat Psalmus, orate; and
sigemit, gemite; et si gratulatur, gaudete, etc. August. in Psalm. 30. Conc. 3.
mourn ye; if it congratulateth and rejoices, rejoice ye likewise; if it
hops, hope ye; if it fears, do ye also fear; for all things that are here
written, are our looking glass, that we may compose our selves as it
directs. Thus the Apostle tells us, that whatsoever things were written
aforetime, were written for our learning; whereby he understands, not only
the information of our judgments, but also the working of them into our hearts
and affections for spiritual use, as the words following do plainly show,
that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. And
Romans 15. 4.
so Eliphaz having showed the miserable end of wicked men, and the happy end of
Gods chastizements unto his children, he thus concludes his discourse: Lo
this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy self,
that is, for thine own special use and benefit, by applying Job. 5. 27.
it to thy present condition and estate. More especially, when the Scriptures
teach, we are to receive instruction for the inlightning of our own minds;
when they admonish, we are to take warning; when they reprove, we are to be
checked; when they comfort, we are to be cheared and encouraged; when they
commend any grace, we are to desire and embrace it; when they command any
duty, we are to hold our selves enjoined to do it; when they promise, we are
to hope; when they threaten, we are to be terrified, as if the judgment were
denounced against us; and when they forbid any sin, we are to think that
they forbid it unto us. By which application, we shall make all the rich
treasures contained in the Scriptures, wholly our own, and in such a powerful
and peculiar manner enjoy the fruit and benefit of them, as if they had been
wholly written for us, and for none other else besides us.

. Sect. 8 That we must read orderly with diligence and constancy.
The last rule to be observed in our reading, is, that we proceed in it after
an orderly manner, with diligence and constancy, and not by fits and snatches,
here a Chapter and there another, or only the beginnings of books, and then
laying them aside, and taking others in hand, of which we are as soon weary
as of the former, only out of nouelty and to feed our vain curiosity, without
any true desire of edification and spiritual profit. But when upon sound
advice, we have made choice of a book, we are not to give it over till we
come to the end. Yea if we find it sound and sauoury, useful and profitable,
we are to read it again and again, as before I have showed, never thinking
that we have perused it sufficiently, till we have thoroughly understood it, laid
it up in our memories, applied it to our hearts, and drawn it into use and
practice. The which constant course, as we must observe in our study of other
godly books, so especially in reading the holy Scriptures, the which must not
be read by pieces without order, as the Book happens to open, when we take it
into our hand, but the best way is, in our ordinary course to begin at the
beginning, and so to proceed till we come to the end. The which will be a
notable help both for the understanding of the matter, and the History of the
Bible, when as we observe the coherence, and how one thing depends upon
another: which if it be interrupted, causes much obscurity, and makes us
unacquainted with the whole Counsel of God, seeing by reason of this
confusion, we shall read many things often, and as many others never at all.
The which rule has place in our ordinary course of reading only: for upon
extraordinary occasions, it is fit and necessary to read in any place as the
occasion requires; As also some special parts of holy Scriptures, more often
then others, which are most full and fertile of spiritual instructions, and
most profitable for edification, which out of our ordinary course we may
read, when we get any fit leisure and opportunity. Again, though in our
ordinary reading no portion of Scriptures is always to be passed over, seeing
all is profitable for some uses and purposes; yet (saving other men's better
judgment) I think that some parts may be read much more seldom then others,
especially by common Christians of mean knowledge and capacity, who are able
to make little use of them; as the Chapters which contain nothing but
Genealogies, those in the New Matthew. 1. Luke 3.
Testament excepted, the Leuiticall law abrogated by Christ, containing the
ceremonies of Gods service, whereof we can make use only as they were types and
shadows of Christ, which cannot easily be done by ordinary wits; the building
of the Tabernacle and Temple, with many Chapters in diverse of the Prophets,
which are either so obscure, or so fitted to diverse Nations, against whom they
denounced Gods judgments, that few can understand them, who are not acquainted
with the state of those Countries, and Histories of those times, which are out
of the reach of ordinary Christians, to whom chiefly I write, and not so
useful as other parts of holy Scriptures to those who are most learned, for
the helping them forward in the duties of a godly life, but only profitably
serve for special purposes and uses, for which the Holy Ghost did principally
intend them. In which regard I have found it profitable, to read over the
whole Scriptures seriously twice or thrice, and to observe as we go, both
these Chapters of less ordinary use, and others of greatest excellency, and
most profitable for our edification, and as we go, to prefix before them, with
our pen, a several mark: as for example; before the former sort, this *;
before the other, this, or some such like: that we may readily choose the one
upon extraordinary occasions, and more seldom read the other in our ordinary
course. The which I prescribe to none, but only propound, and so leave it unto
every ones choice, either to use or not to use it, as they shall think most
fit for their own profit. Only this I would persuade every good Christian, as
a matter most profitable and necessary, that they would read the holy
Scriptures with all diligence, not only at their idle hours, when they have
nothing else to do, but making it one of their most important businesses, to
borrow some time for it from their ordinary employments; yea even from their
sleep, rather then to want time any day studiously to read some part of holy
Scriptures: and finally, that they be not only thus diligent by fits and
flashes, reading much one day, and nothing in another, but that they keep
themselves constantly (as near as they can) to a settled course, seeing he
comes sooner, and more surely to his iourneys end, who observes a discreet
constancy in his travels, though he goes but a slow pace, then another who by
spurts and fits rides upon his gallop, and not minding his journey, spends
the most part of his time in needless stays upon the way.

. Sect. 9 Of the fittest time for this exercise of reading.
And so much concerning the things which are to be observed in the manner of
our reading. The next point to be considered, is the time, which we may most
fitly allot to this exercise, when we are to perform it, and how long it must
be continued. For either of which no certain rule can be given, but they must
be left to be determined by every Christians discretion and devotion, according
to their several occasions and opportunities. We are generally fittest for
this, and other spiritual exercises of like nature, in the morning, when our
spirits and wits are freshest; or if we be not drowzie when we go to bed:
because things which are last thought upon, are better imprinted in the memory,
when as they have had, without disturbance of other business, some time of
settling, especially if we recall them to mind the next morning. But some men's
businesses will allow rather some other time, in some other part of the day;
having then little enough for more necessary duties, as prayer and meditation.
In which regard, the Christian is to be left unto his own discreet choice,
when his occasions will give him fittest opportunity, so that they do not
neglect it altogether. Some who abound in leisure and means, may choose that
time which they find most fit; others which earne their livings by their
labors, or are otherwise taken up with many and important businesses, either
private or public, must take such times as will best stand with their weighty
affairs. Yet let every one allow a little to this profitable exercise, and
even those who are most pinched with poverty, and so pressed with the weight of
important employments, that they can find no leisure in the week days; yet
in any case let them not omit it upon the Lords Day, which is wholly to be set
apart from all worldly businesses, and to be all spent in such spiritual
exercises. So likewise the time of continuing in reading, cannot be stinted
and limited to any certain and constant space, but must be measured by our
devotion, and other affairs. Only this may be generally said, that seeing much
reading is a wearines to the flesh, and wearines dulleth the appetite, and
causes distaste; therefore it is best not to read overmuch at one time, but
to leave with an appetite, that we may return unto it again with more
delight, and not to let wearines and satiety, but wisdom and discretion put an
end unto it.

. Sect. 10 Of the woeful neglect of this holy exercise.
But though this counsel be good, yet few in these days do greatly need it,
seeing it is so woefully neglected amongst the most who profess Christianity,
that there is much more need of a spur to hasten our speed, then of a bridle to
restrain us from running our selves out of breath. For many there are, who
otherwise in their judgments hold this exercise of reading as commendable and
profitable, that are yet so wholly addicted to the world, that they can scarce
find any leisure in any one day of the week, to spend some time in this
religious exercise, but are wholly taken up with such employments, as will
bring unto them some earthly profit, or with the cares of this life, and
forecasting of their business for their best advantage. Others abounding in
leisure, rather then they will spend any time in this profitable exercise (the
which notwithstanding is irksome and tedious, when they are idle and have
nothing to do,) do wholly give themselves over to sports and pastimes, hunting
and hawking, carding and dicing, dancing and reuelling, or else idle and vain
communication, and complementall visitations, hereby preparing against
themselves a fearful reckoning, when being called to give up their accounts,
before the supreme Judge of heaven and earth, how they have spent that precious
time which he has allowed unto them to glorify him, and make their Calling
and Election sure, they shall be constrained to give evidence against
themselves, out of the books of their own consciences, that they have spent
almost all their time in things vain and wicked, serving thereby the devil,
the world, and their own carnal lusts, and little or none at all in
spiritual exercises, and in the duties of Gods service. Neither will it (at
this day) any thing avail us to say, that we had so much worldly business, that
we could not intend this, and such religious exercises, seeing God in his Law
has absolutely required them, not dispencing with us upon any Deuteronomy. 17. 19.
pretense of business. For even Kings and great Commanders, who have greatest,
and most important employments, both in war and peace, are Josh. 1. 8.
not withstanding expressly enjoined to read and meditate in Gods Law. The
which was accordingly performed by holy David, though he had as many
distractions, and weighty employments as any other. Yea, then it Psalm. 119.
will be told us, if we will not know it before, that we were chiefly sent into
the world, that we might do service unto our Lord and Master, who has created
and redeemed us, which therefore ought to have bin preferred before all other
employments; and that the duties of Gods service, and means fitting us unto
it, was that one thing necessary, and our main and chief business, Luke 10. ^2.
unto which all other businesses and worldly affairs, which tend only to
maintain our momentany and uncertain lives, and to uphold our brittle and
mutable estates, for a moment of time, in respect of eternity, ought to have
Mat. 6. 33.
given place, if both of them could not stand together; as they ordinarily
might, if we were not too greedy in pursuing these worldly trifles with an
insatiable appetite, or wanted not wisdom and discretion to perform duties
of both kinds in due order and time.

CAP. XXXI.
That reading is a notable means to further us in the duties of a godly life.

. Sect. 1 That reading is a most profitable exercise.
THe second maine point which I propounded, is, that reading of the Scriptures,
and other holy and religious books, is a notable help and furtherance unto a
godly life. The which may easily be understood by that which is already spoken,
and needs not any large discourse to prove it. And yet it will not be amiss
to say something of it, not so much to inform or convince the judgment of the
truth, as to persuade the heart to put it in practice. And first, generally it
may be said, that to what uses soever the Scriptures are profitable and
necessary, to the same purposes reading of them, which is the means whereby we
derive from them these benefits, is necessary and profitable; seeing though
they be a most rich treasury of all goodness, yet they will do us little
good, if they be locked up, and not by reading and preaching opened unto us. So
that we may truly say, that reading of the Scriptures does nourish our souls,
seeing it conueyeth unto them the food whereby they are nourished; that it
cures us of all our spiritual sores and sicknesses, seeing it conueyeth and
applies unto us the sovereign salues and medicines whereby we are recovered;
that it guides us in the way of truth, because it opens unto us the light,
which serves to direct us. Yea, it serves to all uses and purposes, whereby
we may be furthered in all duties of godliness, seeing it discovers unto us
that divine brightness of the supreme and uncreated wisdom, the reading
whereof (as one Hieronym. ad Celant. de Instit. matrisfam.
says) sharpeneth the sense, inlargeth the understanding, heateth our
lukewarmenesse, rowzeth up our sloth, extinguisheth the darts of lust, moves
mourning, draws from us tears, makes us to approach near unto God, who when
we read, conferreth with us by his holy Spirit. In which respects he
persuades in another place, that it should be our chief care to study and
know the divine Law, wherein we may see the examples of Gods Saints as present
before our eyes, and by the counsel thereof, learn what is to be done, and
what avoided. For it is a great help unto holiness and righteousness of
life, to replenish the mind with the divine Oracles, and to be always
meditating in our hearts upon those things, which we desire to practice in our
lives.

. Sect. 2 That by reading, the mind is much enlightened in the knowledge of
Gods will.
More especially this exercise of reading does singularly further us in a godly
life, as it does inlighten our understandings in the knowledge of Gods will,
unto which we are to yield obedience, and shows unto us the way in which we
must walk. To which purpose, no exercise whatsoever is so useful and
effectual. For howsoever the preaching and hearing of the Word, have a
superior privilege in the work of our Regeneration and conversion, and for
the working of saving graces in us; as faith, repentance, and the rest; yet for
the inlightening of the mind with the full knowledge of the truth, after we
are converted and illuminated in some measure, this exercise of reading has
many special privileges. For first, we may use it as often as we will, and
have any desire to gain knowledge; but the other can be had but at certain
times, nor then neither in every place. Secondly, by reading, we may in short
time, if we be studious and diligent, be thoroughly instructed in the whole body
of Divinity, and in all the several parts thereof, which by preaching we
cannot come to know, but in long time, though our Pastor take the best, and
most direct course of joining Catechizing with Preaching, nor in our whole
lives in any great perfection, if this be neglected; seeing in a Sermon some
few of innumerable points are usually delivered, and they rather pressed upon
the affection for use and practice, then sufficiently cleared to the
understanding. Thirdly, because by reading we may help our understanding, by
reuiewing over and over again, that which at first we conceived not, and by
the same means also may recall to our remembrance the things which after once
or twice reading we have forgotten: the which helps hearing affoordeth not,
especially when we most stand in need of them. Finally, because we may at our
own pleasure fit our reading for our own occasions, and furnishing us in the
knowledge of those points, wherein we are most defective, for the resolving of
our particular questions and doubts, and for the informing our judgments in
all points whereof for the present, and upon every occasion, we have special
use: whereas the Preacher speaking generally for the good of the whole
Congregation, and not being acquainted with our defects in knowledge, seldom
or never speaks of all those points wherein we need instruction, and often of
such as we know already. In all which respects it is hard to find a Christian
thoroughly grounded in all points contained in the body of Divinity, though he
be never so diligent in hearing the Word preached, and may have some competency
of knowledge necessary to salvation, and some good measure of faith, and other
saving graces, if he utterly neglect this duty of reading.

. Sect. 3 That reading brings with it many other benefits.
Again, as reading singularly inlighteneth the mind, so also it affoordeth
many other helps of a godly life; for it is a special means to relieve the
memory, and to move the will, inclining it powerfully unto good, and
withdrawing it from evil, though not in that degree of efficacy as the Word
preached. It works upon the heart, for the mollifying and softening it, and
upon all the affections, for the purging and sanctifying of them, inflaming our
love toward God and all good things, and our hatred against all that is evil;
it kindles our zeal when it grows lukewarm, and stirs up our devotion
when it is cold and sluggish. It much increases all Gods graces in us; as
faith, affiance, repentance, patience, peace of conscience, and the rest, by
imparting unto them that spiritual food whereby they are nourished. It
amendeth our lives, and makes us (as the Apostle speaks) perfect unto every
good work. It specially inableth 2. Tim. 3. 13, 17.
us to the fruitful hearing of the Word of God, when as we can, with the
Bereans, search the Scriptures, whether the things we hear be so or no; and
try Act. 17. 11.
the spirits of those we hear, whether they be of God or no, by examining
their doctrines according to the touchstone of this Truth: besides that, it
makes us well acquainted with the Scriptures, both for matter and history, so
that when they are cited, they are familiar unto us. Whereas without this
benefit of reading, we cannot tell whether the testimonies quoted be in the
Canonical Scriptures or no, or if we take this upon our Teachers word, yet we
cannot tell where they are, nor easily turn to them upon the sudden. It
teaches us to manage the Sword of the Spirit, whereby we are enabled to defend
our selves, and repel the tentations of our spiritual enemies, as we see in
the Ephesians. 6. 17. Math. 4. 3. 4, etc.
example of our Savior Christ. Finally, if we use this exercise carefully and
conscionably to profit by it, we shall be assured of everlasting blessedness;
For blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the Words Apoc. 1. 3.
of Gods Book, and keep the things which are written therein. Blessed is
Psalm. 1. 1, 2.
the man who delights in the Law of the Lord, and meditateth therein day and
night. All which being duly considered, should be effectual motives to make
those diligent in reading, who are able to perform it, and greatly to humble
those who are not, in the sight and sense of this great defect, and either to
labor that yet they may attain unto this skill, if they be capable and have
means, or else to supply their wants, by resorting often unto others, that
they may read unto them the evidences of their salvation and heavenly
inheritance, which themselves for want of skill are not able to peruse.

CAP. XXXII.
The last ordinary means of a godly life, is the choice of our company,
shunning the society of the wicked, and consorting our selves with the godly
and Religious.

. Sect. 1 That we must carefully avoid the society of wicked and profane
persons.
THe last ordinary means of a godly life is, that we make good choice of our
company, unto which two things are required: first, that we shun and avoid the
society of the profane and wicked; the other is, that we consort our selves
with the godly and religious. By the former we are not to understand that we
must forbear the society of all, who are not as forward and zealous in their
profession and practice as our selves, or who bewray in their course and
conversation many infirmities and imperfections, as though those were to be
esteemed wicked and profane, who have made but small progress in their
sanctification, if any sparks of grace and goodness appear in them, though
(as it were) raked up under the ashes of many and great corruptions; for then
we should break the bruised reed, and quench the Matthew. 12. 20.
smoking flax; and by our censorious neglect utterly discourage them in their
first entrance into Christianity, and from making any further proceedings in
the ways of godliness. Yea rather, if we can in the judgment of charity
think, that the little good in them is in sincerity and truth, we must, as the
Apostle exhorts, take such unto us, and use all good means, in love and
meekness, whereby we may Romans 14. 1.
draw them on by degrees to more perfection. For babes in Christ being unable
to help themselves, had most need of tender cherishing, and those that are
sick, having some life of grace in them, had most need of good Nurses and
skillful Physicions, as our Savior has Matthew. 9. 12, 13.
taught us by his own example. And the Apostle exhorts us not to neglect the
weak, but to lift up the hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble
knees; and to hold such an even course, that those which Heb. 12. 12.
are lame in the profession and practice of Religion, be not through our
harshnes quite turned out of the way; but rather that they may be healed, and
so Acts 3.
may (like the Cripple in the Temple) together with us glorify God, and love
us above others, who have been the means of their spiritual cure. But such
only are here understood, who have let the reins loose to all impiety, and
are of professed profaneness, not caring to make show of it upon every
occasion, and either scorn and scoff at the exercises of godliness, or
neglect and contemn them in the whole course of their lives. Neither may we
reject such as show some willingness to conform themselves to our good
courses, and to join with us in the exercises of Religion, though for the
present we see in them little power of godliness; but only such Ismaels and
Esau's, as hold them in contempt, are worthy to be expulsed out of all
societies. Neither are we so to understand it, as though it were utterly
unlawful to come at all into the company of such wicked men; for then (as the
Apostle says) we must go out of the world; and 1. Cor. 5. 10.
every place almost abounding with such, we cannot choose but oftentimes at
unawares come amongst them, but that we do not purposely make choice of such
company, and if unwittingly we happen to come into it, that we quit our selves
of it as soon as we can. Nor are we debarred from having any intercourse and
commerce with such in worldly affairs, as trading and merchandise, buying and
selling, and all other such contracts, as are ordained for the benefit of
humane society, whereby we may do or receive good in our outward estate; nor
from performing any civil or Christian duty to our friends and allies,
kindred and neighbors, or any work of mercy toward those that are in misery,
and need our help: so that we entertain their company no longer, then is
necessary for these uses, and then be careful that we go not without our
preservatives about us, that we may not, in seeking to do them good, hurt our
selves with the contagion of their wickedness, nor receive more detriment in
our spiritual estate, then they or we profit in respect of outward things.
Though in truth it is most safe conuersing with wicked men, when we minister
unto them in their extremities, seeing when they are benumbed with the cold of
their afflictions, they cannot spit out their venom and poison, but like
frozen serpents may be taken into our hands without receiving any great hurt.
Besides that, their necessity importuning our help, will be a curb to
restrain their malice, at least till their turn be served, that they may
make us more cheerful in relieuing their miseries. But this only we
understand to be unlawful, to stretch our action further then our excuse will
reach, that is, under any, or all these pretenses, to converse with wicked men
more then we need. And much more to make them our bosom friends, and to
entertain familiar acquaintance and society with them, being either bewitched
with their natural and moral parts, or allured with some baytes of worldly
benefit, or carnal delight. For though we may not out of hatred toward the
persons of evil men be envious against them, yet in detestation Pro. 24. 1.
of their sins, we must not desire to be with them, as Solomon teaches us.

. Sect. 2 That the Scriptures often warn us to shun wicked company.
And for this we have many caueats, and express inhibitions in the Book of
God, both in the Old and New Testament, for in them both Pro. 4. 14, 15.
these beasts are unclean. So Solomon charge us, not to enter into the path
of the wicked, nor to go in the way of evil men; Avoid it (says he) pass
not by it, turn from it, and pass away. For though he be about other matters
so short and sententious, yet wisely foreseeing the greatness of this danger,
he thought he could scarce use words inow in warning us to shun it. And the
same reason makes him to beat so often upon it in other places: Forsake the
foolish and live, and go in the way of understanding. Pro. 9. 6.
My son, walk not thou in the way with the wicked, refrain thy foot Pro.
1. 15, 16.
from their path; for their feet run to evil, etc. And amongst other
sinners, he specially inhibiteth us to keep company with drunkards and
gluttons, which in the world are esteemed the only good fellows and boon
companions, because they above other sinners are most dangerous; seeing they
both allure us with their ill example, and draw us by their inuitations that
way, to which our carnal appetite is naturally too prone. Be not (says he)
amongst wine-bibbers, amongst riotous eaters of Pro. 23. 20.
flesh. Thus the Apostle also in the New Testament inhibiteth us to keep
company with wicked men. Have no fellowship (says he) with the works of
darkness, Ephesians. 5. 11.
but rather reprove them. And again, We command ye, brethren, in the 2. These.
3. 6.
Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw your selves from every brother
that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which ye have received of
us. And, If any man that is called a brother, be a fornicatour, or covetous, or
1. Cor. 5. 11.
an Idolater, or a rayler, or a dunkard, or an extortioner, with such an one I
have written, you should not keep company, no not to eat. But above all other
societies with the wicked, we must take special care, that we do not match
with them in that near bond of marriage, according to that of the Apostle, Be
not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship 2. Cor. 6.
14.
has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with
darkness? and what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that
believes, with an Infidel? For if holy David match with scoffing Michol, 1.
Sam. 18. 21. 2. Sam. 6. 16, 20.
she will be a snare unto him, and a proud scorner of his humble zeal in Gods
service. If Iehoram the son of good Iehosaphat, marry with Ahabs daughter, it
will be a strong inducement to make him an Idolater, and to do evil in the
sight of the Lord. 2. King. 8. 18.


. Sect. 3 Examples of the faithful who have shunned wicked company.
Unto these testimonies of holy Scriptures, dehorting us from entertaining
near society and alliance with the wicked, we may add the examples 2. King.
3. 14.
of Gods servants, who have carefully shunned all fellowship with them. Thus
Elisha so much detested the wicked life and reign of idolatrous Iehoram, that
had he not respected the presence of Iehosaphat, who was in his company, he
would not, as he professes, so much as have looked toward him, nor seen him.
So the Apostle John, as it is recorded of him, finding Cerinthus, a blasphemous
heretic, in a bath with some of his consorts, Ierenaeus aduers. Haeres. l. 3.
c. 3.
belching out blasphemies against our Savior Christ, in haste departed with
his company, for fear of being attached by Gods Judgments together with them;
Who was no sooner gone out of the company, but presently the house fell down
and overwhelmed all that cursed crew. But most plainly may we see this
practiced in the example of holy David; who in many places shows how much he
hated and shunned the society of wicked men; I have not (says he) sat with
vain persons, neither will I go in with Psalm. 26. 4, 5.
dissemblers; I have hated the congregation of evil doers, and I will not sit
with the wicked. A froward heart shall depart from me, I will not know a wicked
person. Psalm. 101. 4, 7.
He that works deceit, shall not dwell within my house; he that tells lies,
shall not tarry in my sight. So elsewhere, he banisheth them out of his
company, Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity, and, Away from me, ye wicked,
Psalm. 6. 8. Psalm. 119. 115.
etc. I will keep the Commandments of my God.

. Sect. 4 Reasons persuading us to shun the society of wicked men, first,
because it is a strong tentation unto evil.
Besides which testimonies and examples, we may add diverse effectual reasons,
which may dissuade us from keeping company with wicked men. As first, because
we shall be in great danger to grow in short time like unto them. For it is a
strong tentation to draw us unto all evil, and it is just with God, to leave
us when we wilfully rush into it. The love which we bear to their persons,
will lessen daily our mislike of their sins, making us to think them at
first less heinous then they are, afterward small and venial, then tolerable
and excusable, till at last we come to justify and defend them, to approve
and practice them. Besides, sin is of a contagious nature, and we most apt
to receive infection; in which regard, it spreads as fast as the plague in a
City, or the rot in a flock of Sheep. For not only are the examples of the
wicked of such great force, that if we keep them company, they think it a
strange thing, if we do not run with them into the same excess of riot; but
they are also ready to set upon us 1. Pet. 4. 4.
with persuasions, and to use arguments of worldly advantage, to allure us to
accompany them in their wickedness, as Solomon teaches us. Being Pro. 1. 10,
11, 12
herein like to them who are sick of the plague, that care not how many are
infected by them, that so the fewer may shun their company. And this David
knew to be so strong a tentation, that resolving to keep Gods Commandments,
he first caused the workers of wickedness to depart from him, Psalm. 119. 115.
because so long as they consorted with him, he had little hope of making good
his resolution. And finding not power in himself to resist it, because of the
many allurements and baits of wickedness, he desires by prayer Gods
assistance: Incline not mine heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked
works with men that work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties.
Psalm. 141. 4.
Thus Elymas the Sorcerer being, it seems, in times past gracious with
Sergius Paulus the Deputy, so maliciously withstood the Apostles, Paul and
Barnabas, and so powerfully wrought with the Governor to turn him away from
the faith; that the Apostle was feign vehemently to Act. 13. 8.
oppose him, and to disgrace him with the Deputy, by bringing upon that caytife
by miracle, a fearful Judgment of God. And this danger of being tainted and
corrupted with the sins of wicked men, by keeping them company, Solomon
plainly implies, where he persuades us to make no friendship with an angry
man, and not to go with one that is furious, lest we Pro. 22. 24.
learn his ways, and get a snare to our souls; for as he says before;
Thorns Verse. 5.
and snares are in the way of the froward: he that does keep his soul, shall
be far from them. And so likewise the Apostle, where persuading the
Corinthians to excommunicate the incestuous person, lest they should be
infected with his example, uses this as a reason, because sin is like unto
leaven, a little whereof leaueneth the whole lump. The which we see 1. Cor. 5.
6.
verified in the example of Joseph, who notwithstanding that he was Genesis 42.
15, 16.
so virtuous and Religious, yet living in the Kings Court, learned to swear
ordinarily by the life of Pharaoh. Yea, if their example be not strong enough
to allure us to sin, yet other motives draw us into it, and especially fear
of their scorns and reproaches, violence and persecution, if we go not with
them hand in hand in their evil courses: As we see in the example of David,
who being in the Court of Achish, one time basely counterfeiteth madness, and
at another time dissembleth, and faineth himself to be a friend to the
Philistims, and an enemy to Gods people; and in the Apostle Peter, who Nazian.
ad Caesarium.
being amongst the Highpriests servants, for fear of them denies his Master.
So that as one says wittily, If we keep company with wicked men, though we
be not burnt with their fire, yet we shall be smutcht with the smoke. Yea, not
only do wicked men hurt us in these respects by this society and
familiarity, if seeing their sins, we do not show our dislike, by our
rebuke, and (if they will do no good) by leaving their company; but we also
shall hurt them, and harden them in their sins, because it is no small
heartning and encouraging of wicked men to go on in their evil courses, when
as they are countenanced with the society of the godly, and are moved to
think that they are, if not commendable, yet at least tolerable, or else men
of such Piety would not be so inward and familiar with them. Whereas
contrariwise by shunning their society, we shall give them occasion to enter
into a consideration of their estate, and of their sinful courses, which
make them loathsome both to God and all good men; and move them at least to an
outward reformation, out of natural shame, to be thus shunned, according to
that of the Apostle; If any man obey not our Word, have no company with him,
that he may be ashamed. 2. These. 3. 14.


. Sect. 5 Other reasons to dissuade us from evil company.
And these reasons, though there were no more, are sufficient to withdraw all
that intend to lead a godly life, from inward friendship with wicked persons.
Unto which, if it were needful, many others might be added. As that such
society may be unto us a strong presumption, that we are not truly righteous,
and upright in heart, but that we still halt between God and the world. For if
as Solomon says, An unjust man Pro. 29. 27.
is an abomination to the just, and he that is upright in the way, is an
abomination to the wicked, how can we delight in one another company? And if,
as our Savior has taught us, we were not of the world, but in their Ioh. 15.
9. 1. Ioh. 2. 15.
number whom he has chosen out of it, then would the world hate us, and we it;
and little comfort should we take in conuersing familiarly one with another.
Again, as society with the wicked is dangerous, for fear of being tainted
with their sins, so also because it makes us Iam. 4. 4.
liable to their punishments: For as the Lord often spares the wicked for the
righteous sake, so also he punishes with temporal judgments the godly for
the wickeds sake, and pulls them from them with violence (as Lot from the
Sodomites) when as for earthly respects they are loath to leave their company.
And therefore if we would not perish with Corah and his companions, we must
leave the Tents of those wicked men, and come out of Babylon, if we be Gods
people, that Number. 16. 26. Apoc. 18. 4.
we may not be partakers of her sins, and that we receive not of her plagues.
Finally, the utter leaving of familiar society with the wicked, will be unto us
a comfortable evidence of our eternal happiness; seeing the Spirit of God
has pronounced them blessed, that walk not in the Counsel of the ungodly,
nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the Psalm. 1. 1.
scornful; that is, who do not converse, nor communicate with them in any of
their sinful courses.

. Sect. 6 That we must consort our selves with the godly and virtuous.
The second point is, that as we are carefully to shun the company of the
profane and wicked, as being notable pulbacks in the ways Pro. 13. 20.
of godliness, so must we with no less care consort our selves with the godly
and virtuous, as being a singular furtherance unto all Christian duties. For
being naturally backward and auerse unto all that is good, and after that we
are regenerate, frail and feeble in all duties of a godly life, here, if any
where, is Gods Word verified, that it is not good for man to be alone, but that
an helper is needful unto him, and that Genesis 2. 18.
two are better then one, because they have a good reward of their labor; for
if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow, etc. And therefore we must not,
to shun the company of the wicked, run into the contrary extreme, and keep
company with none, seeing God has made us political creatures, who are
preserved by mutual society; and fellow members of the same body whereof
Christ is the head: and therefore we must not by withdrawing our selves, makea
Schism and rent, but continue together in loving society, that we may be ready
to perform mutually all good offices whereby we may edify and benefit one
another: According to that of the Apostle; Let us Heb. 10. 24.
consider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works: not forsaking
the assembling of our selves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting
one another, etc. For the more we converse with the godly and religious, the
greater increase shall we find in our Piety, Faith, Love, Zeal and all others
graces, as coals laid together, do, if any of them be kindled, kindle one
another, and so all together make a great fire, which if they be severed one
from another, give but little heat, and in a short time will go quite out. And
this we see in the example of David, who greatly rejoicing in the communion of
Saints, and in the fellowship of the Faithful, excelled also in Piety and
Holiness. So he professes that all his delight was in Gods Saints; that his
eyes were to the Faithful of the Psalm. 16. 3. Psalm. 101. 6.
Land, that they might dwell with him. That though he were a King, yet he made
himself a companion of all them that feared God, and kept his precepts, Psalm.
119. 63, 79.
and that he invited such to come unto him; and rejoiced greatly when they
said, Let us go together into the House of the Lord. And it may be observed
that then Christians flourished in greatest purity, and Psalm. 122. 1.
best thriued in all grace and godliness, when this community and fellowship
was most frequent amongst them. For so it is said, that they continued Acts 2.
46. and 9. 31.
daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from house to house,
did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and
having favor with all the people.

. Sect. 7 That good company takes away all tediousness in good exercises.
More especially, this society with the godly and religious, does much further
us in all duties of a godly life, because it takes away the tediousness of
our journey, when we have good company to travail with us: Seeing they draw us
on by their good discourses, and put out of our minds the tediousness of the
way; they comfort and encourage us, when we begin to be weary; they are ready
to help us, if any evil betide us; to secure us by their assistance from fear
of our spiritual enemies, who are ready to rob us of the treasures of Gods
graces; and when we are slothful, they much better our speed, because we
would not be cast behind. Again, the fellowship of the godly does much further
us by their good example, seeing their zeal and diligence conuinceth our
luke-warmenesse and negligence, and their good works of piety and
righteousness are good patterns and presidents for us to imitate. For though
the Law of God be the most perfect rule, and the example of our Savior Christ
the most exact squire, according to which all our actions and whole
conversation are to be framed; yet these being of such incomparable excellency,
and so far above our low growth in grace and short reach, would altogether
discourage us in the sense of our imperfections, if we did not also observe
men subject to the like infirmities, walking before us in the ways of
godliness, and inuiting us to follow them, who though they go not so swiftly
as they should, yet have much outstripped us in the Christian race.
Furthermore, this society and communion with the faithful, is a notable means
to make us familiar with God, and to enjoy the fellowship of his holy Spirit,
which is the chief bond that unites us together in this holy communion. For
where two or three are gathered together in Matthew. 18. 20.
Christ's name and Gods fear, to perform Christian exercises, and to further
one another in the ways of salvation, there he also is in the midst of them,
taking notice of their actions, and making himself better known unto them,
his face and favor, his bounty and goodness, whereby they are encouraged with
more cheerfulness to do him service.

. Sect. 8 That good company preserves us from falling into many sins, and
inciteth us to many duties.
Finally, it is a notable help unto a godly life, because it is a powerful
Magna pars peccatorum tollitur, si peccaturis testis assistat. Seneca Epist.
11. Malum quippe quod nemo videt nemo arguit, etc. Bernard. Epist. 115.
means to restrain and pull us back, when as we are ready to fall into any
sin. In which regard that wise heathen man persuades his friend, to suppose
some grave man to be present when he was alone, because men would not easily
offend, if there were always some by to be witnesses of their faults. And one
of the Ancients uses it as a reason to dissuade from a solitary life; because
thereby we become more prone to sin; seeing that evil, which none sees,
none rebukes; and where there is none to reprehend, both the tempter
assaulteth more securely, and the offense is committed more licentiously. If
thou do any good things in good company, no man prohibiteth. But if thou will do evil, thou art not suffered; for presently thou art by many observed,
reproved, and amended; whereas contrariwise, if they behold any good, they all
admire it, honor and imitate it. In which respect also, good company does no
more forcibly restrain us from evil, then incite and provoke us unto that
which is good. For as iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance
of his Pro. 27. 17.
friend; that is, one friend by the presence of another, is whetted on and
provoked to do such good duties as deserve his approbation. In which respect
the Apostle exhorts Christians to observe one another, that they may whet and
sharpen each other to love and good works. For if even Heb. 10. 24.
hypocrites, and men of ingenuous natures, though they care not for good
exercises, are ready to join with their friends in them, to get their
allowance and love: Then how much more will it quicken those that are truly
religious, unto every good work and Christian duty, which they like and love,
when with the approbation of their friends, they have the allowance of God and
their own consciences? And if Saul himself prophesied by keeping company with
the Prophets, being as it were raped and ravished for the time with a divine
fury: how 1. Sam. 19. 20, 21.
much more shall those that are truly religious, be much inflamed with zeal
and devotion in all holy exercises, when being in good company, they are raped
up and ravished with the divine breath of the holy Spirit, which blows
amongst them?

. Sect. 9 That by good company we are fitted to perform Christian duties one
toward another.
Lastly, good company is a singular help unto a godly life, as it fitteth and
enableth us to use all Christian duties one toward another, whereby we do
mutually further one another in all holy and religious actions, tending to
edification, to the enriching of us with all saving graces, and the
strengthening of us unto all good works. The first whereof is mutual
observation, and watching over one another, that we may take all occasions of
doing good, both by restrayning those from sin that are ready to fall into
it, and by inciting and provoking one another unto all virtuous actions. Unto
which the Apostle exhorts; Let us (says he) consider one another, to provoke
unto love and to good works. For Heb. 10. 24.
the Law of charity requiring, that we should love our neighbors as our
selves, binds us to seek their good as well as our own, and to this end to
watch over them, that we may take all good opportunities, whereby we may
further them in the ways of godliness. And therefore let us not think that
we have discharged our duty, when as we have used the means of our
conversion and salvation, and that we have nothing to do with other men; seeing
our Savior requires, that when we Luke 22. 32.
are converted, we strengthen our brethren. And the Apostle gives us in
charge, that we should not only look on our own things, but that every man
should also look on the things of others. And not to take care of our brethren
Phil. 2. 4.
as well as our selves, is plainly to discover that we are of Cains spirit,
Genesis 4.
who refused to be his brothers keeper, and no true members of Christ's body,
whose property is, not to respect their own good alone, but as it is conjoined
with the good of the whole body, and of all the rest of their fellow members.
The second Christian duty, is instruction, whereby with all readiness, we
inform the ignorant in all the ways of godliness, inlighten them in the
knowledge of God and his truth, and open their eyes, that they may turn from
darkness to light, and from the Acts 2^. 18.
power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
inheritance amongst them which are sanctified by faith in Christ. Whereby also
we reclaim the erroneous which wander out of the way of truth, which is a
special duty required by the Apostle: Brethren, if any of you James 5. 20.
do err from the truth, and one convert him: let him know, that he which
conuerteth the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from
death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. Which duties if we perform, we
shall be richly rewarded in Gods Kingdom, where they that turn many to Dan.
12. 3.
righteousness, shall shine in the light of glory, like the Stars in the
firmament, as they shined here in the light of truth. The third duty is
admonition, whereby we put our brethren in mind of their duty, when they
seem to forget and neglect it by falling into sin, and lying Romans 15. 14. 1.
These. 5. 14.
in it without repentance, or omitting the duties of Gods service, either those
which are general and belong to all Christians, or those which specially
belong to them in their several places and callings, of which I have spoken
before at large. The fourth duty is reprehension, whereby we rebuke those that
wittingly fall into sin, and wilfully continue in it without amendment. The
which the Apostle requires, where he charge us to have no fellowship with
the unfruitful Epe. 15. 11.
works of darkness, but to reprove them rather, implying, that if we see
sin in our brother, and do not rebuke him for it, having a calling
thereunto, we have communion and fellowship with him, and are accessory to his
sins. The right course of performing which duty, our Savior plainly
sets down: If thy brother shall trespass against Matthew. 18. 15.
thee, go and tell his fault between thee and him alone: and if he shall
hear thee, thou have gained thy brother, etc. Which duty if we neglect, we
hate our brother in truth, whatsoever show we make to the contrary, and do
nothing hereby but discover our self-love, which makes us loath to trouble our
selves in so unpleasant a business, and suffer others rather to perish in
their sins, then we will venture the alienation of their hearts from us by
giving them any distaste. And this reason the Lord uses to press this duty;
Thou shall not hate thy brother in thine heart, Leu. 19. 17.
but thou shall in any wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon
him. The fifth duty is exhortation, whereby we incite and provoke others unto
all duties of godliness, pricking forward those which are dull and sluggish,
dehorting and dissuading from vice and sin, those that are in danger to fall
into it; and encouraging those who run well in the Christian race, that they
may continue faithful, and hold out unto the end. And unto this the Apostle
persuades us; Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, lest any of
you be hardened through the deceitfulness Heb. 3. 13.
of sin. The sixth duty is consolation, whereby we strengthen the weak
hands and feeble knees, and refresh with seasonable Heb. 12. 12.
comforts, those which are ready to faint under the weight of their
afflictions. And this the Apostle requires of all Christians: Comfort 1. These.
5. 11, 14.
(says he) your selves together, and edify one another, even as you do; and
again, Comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all
men. Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep; be of the
same Romans 12. 15.
mind one toward another; for it is an ease to those that are in misery, to
have companions of their grief, and the heauiest weight is made more
tolerable, when as it is borne by many shoulders. The seventh duty is counsel,
whereby we aduize those, who do not know of themselves what to do in the best
course, which is an excellent office to be performed by those whom God has
endued with wisdom and sound judgment, toward them who are weak and
defective in these gifts. Yea in truth, it is very profitable, when it is given
by those which are of equal parts; yea oftentimes by those who are much
inferior unto us, as we see in Abigails counsel to David; because lookers on
being free from all prejudice and passion, can see more clearly then those who
are interessed in the business, though at other times more quick-sighted; pride,
self-love, and unruly affections, corrupting and blinding their judgment, and
mis-leading them out of the right way. The last duty tending to further one
another in godliness, is good example, by which, shining before them in the
light of an holy conversation, we do not only show them the ways of
righteousness, but also (as it were) by the hand lead them in it. And unto
this our Savior exhorts; Let your light so shine before men, that seeing
Mat. 5. 16.
your good works, they may glorify your Father which is in heaven. And the
Apostle Peter, Have your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that 1. Pet.
2. 12. and 3. 1.
whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may, by your good works
which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. And so much
concerning the ordinary helps and means whereby we may be enabled and
furthered in all the duties of a godly life.

CAP. XXXIII.
Of extraordinary means of a godly life, and first, of feasting, and solemn
thanksgiving.

. Sect. 1 Of solemn thanksgiving what it is, and when to be performed.
Having entreated of the ordinary means of a godly life; it now follows that
we say something of the extraordinary, which are such as are to be used upon
extraordinary occasions, when God offers them unto us. And these are
specially two; the first is, holy feasting, wherein we return unto God thanks
and praise, for his special blessings and benefits; the other, an holy fast,
wherein we do, after an extraordinary manner, humble our selves before him, in
the sight and sense of our sins, or some afflictions which they have
deservedly brought upon us. Concerning the former, I shall not need to say
much, seeing I have already spoken of it, and am here only to show, what
extraordinary thanks and praise we are to return unto God, when as we are
stirred up thereunto by some extraordinary and special benefit. The which is
the same thanksgiving spoken of before, performed in a solemn and special
manner, for some great and extraordinary favor of God, shining clearly in some
more then usual benefit received (as it were) from his own hand, when in
respect of secondary causes, we could not so much as hope for it, and in regard
of our sins and unworthiness, we had good cause to expect the contrary. As
when God has magnified his wisdom, power and goodness unto us in some
wonderful deliverance from some dreadful and desperate danger, threatening
imminent destruction; or out of some grievous calamity, into which we are
already plunged, when as we could not reasonably expect help and safety from
our own means, or the assistance of any creature, but from God alone, to whom
nothing is impossible; or in bestowing upon us some positive benefit of great
use and worth, when upon the former considerations we could conceive small
hope, that ever we should have inioyed it. Of the former we have diverse
examples in the Scriptures. As in that solemn thanksgiving rendered unto God by
the people of Israel, for their freedom out of the Egyptian bondage, and for
drowning their enemies in the red Sea, for which Moses, Miriam, with the rest
of the people, Exodus 15.
men and women, rejoice before God, and sing unto him songs of deliverance. The
which they yearly renewed in a most solemn manner, in the celebration of the
Feast of the Passover, wherein they literally magnified Gods mercy for that
temporary deliverance, and typically for their spiritual Redemption from
sin, Satan, and all other enemies of their salvation, by the true Paschall
Lamb, the Messiah, who was to be slain and offered to God his Father, as a
propitiatory sacrifice, and all-sufficient price of Redemption for their
sins, and all others who should believe in him. And such a solemn
thanksgiving was made by Deborah Judge. 5.
and the people, for their victory over Sisera, and their freedom from the
tyranny of Iabin King of Canaan, who had long oppressed them. By David, when as
God had delivered him out of the hands of all his enemies, and especially out
of the hand of Saul; and by Hester, Mordecay, and the Jews Hest. 9.
of the Captivity, from that fearful conspiracy of Haman, who had plotted the
destruction of the whole Nation. And such a feast of thanksgiving we worthily
celebrate upon the fifth of November, for that marvelous and almost miraculous
deliverance of our King and State, from that horrible and unmatchable
Powder Treason, by giving wisdom to our gracious Sovereign, to interpret their
dark riddle, as he did sometime to Daniel, for the expounding of
Nebuchadnezzars dream, when the wisdom of the wisest in the Land could not
unfold it. Of the other we have an example in Abraham, who made a solemn
feast, that he might render unto God, Genesis 21.
praise and thanksgiving, for giving unto him, contrary to all hope, a son in
his old age, of whom should come that promised seed, in which, both himself,
and all the Nations of the earth should be blessed.

. Sect. 2 When this solemn thanksgiving is most seasonable; how it differs
from that which is ordinary, and the kinds of it.
Which examples we ought to imitate, consecrating unto God some day for solemn
thanksgiving, whenever we receive from him any great and extraordinary
benefits, either privative, consisting in deliverance from some imminent or
present evil; or positive, when as he vouchsafes unto us some great and
unexpected blessing. But above all other times we must perform this duty, when
we celebrate the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in remembrance of that
inestimable benefit, the great work of our Redemption, wrought by the death
and Passion of Jesus Christ, whereby we are delivered out of the hands of all
our spiritual enemies. The which is called the Eucharist, or a Sacrament of
thanksgiving, because therein we do, in a solemn manner, render unto God
thanks and praise, for Christ and all his benefits, the pardon of our sins,
and that great Charter of our peace, sealed first by his blood, and now by this
Sacrament instituted to put us in remembrance of it, and as it were afresh to
renew his Covenant, and to put our Pardon into our own hands. Now this
extraordinary thanksgiving to be used upon such special occasions, differs
from that which is ordinary, not in the matter, which is one and the same, but
in the manner and measure, which according to the occasion, ought to be
extraordinary in quantity and degree. For our hearts must be more then usually
inflamed with the apprehension of Gods love and goodness, and inward joy in
the special fruition of his singular blessings, which must affect them with
extraordinary zeal to glorify and praise him, and to express our
thankfulness by renewing our covenant with God, binding our selves by firm
resolution, that in sense of his present favors, we will be more devout and
zealous in all duties of his service for the time to come, then ever we have
been in time past. And by continuing our thanksgiving in a solemn manner, for
a longer time then ordinary, setting it apart as a Sabbath of rest from all our
worldly labors, that it may be wholly spent in Gods praises, and in testifying
our love and inward joy and rejoicing in him, by outward feasting, and more
liberal use of meats and drinks, and all other comforts of this life; and in
showing our love and bounty in obedience to God, by entertaining at our table,
and by sending gifts and rewards unto our poor neighbors, that they also may
rejoice with us. And this solemn feasting and thanksgiving is, according to
the occasion of it, public or private. Public, for some public benefit which
concerns the welfare of the Church or Commonwealth, which is to be
appointed only by the public authority of Christian Magistrates; and is to be
celebrated in a most solemn and public manner, all sorts and conditions of
men assembling together in the Church, to magnify and praise Gods holy name,
and to crave the continuance of his love and favor. The which prayers and
praises are profitably conjoined with the preaching of the Word, for the
stirring up of the whole Assembly to extraordinary thankfulness, when as
thereby the greatness of the blessings received, and the inestimable mercy of
God is set forth unto them. Private, for some special benefits bestowed,
either on a particular person, or a whole family, which is to be solemnized by
singing of Psalms, prayer and thanksgiving, reading of some portions of holy
Scriptures, fit for the present occasion; holy conferences, whereby we are to
magnify Gods mercies, and to recount and tell what great things he has done
for us; and also expressing our inward joy, by a more free and liberal use of
Gods creatures, whereof we must also cause our poor neighbors to have some
taste. The which kind of feasting and solemn thanksgiving is a notable help
unto true godliness, as it works our hearts to a more lively sense and
feeling of Gods love, stirs us up to more zealous performance of all
religious duties unto him, who has been so gracious and good unto us; and as
it gives us occasion to renew our covenant with God, and to confirm our
resolution, that we will be more diligent and zealous in doing all things
which may please and glorify him.

CAP. XXXIIII.
Of the second extraordinary means, which is, solemn fasting.

. Sect. 1 What a true fast is, and how it differs from all other fasts.
THe other extraordinary means of a godly life, is, an holy fast, of which it
is my purpose to speak briefly, though the use and benefit of this duty is so
great, that it well deserves a more full discourse; because it is already so
excellently and exactly handled in diverse Treatises purposely written of this
argument, and especially in one, which is called, The holy exercise of a true
fast: and in another, entitled, The Christian exercise of fasting, written
many years since, by the right Reverend Father and my most dear brother, that
nothing material can be added unto it. And therefore I will content my self
to set down, after mine own manner, some of those points briefly, which are
most essential and necessary unto this exercise, (for how should I in a
Chapter, express all fully, which would require a whole Treatise?) referring
the Christian Reader unto those learned Treatises, if he desire more through
satisfaction, and particular direction in any of them. And first, that we may
begin with the description of this duty: A fast, as we here understand it, is a
voluntary, religious and solemn action, undertaken upon some extraordinary
occasion, wherein we seriously humble our selves before God, in the sight and
sense of our sins, and the Judgments of God due unto them; testifying our
repentance for them, and our unworthiness of his least mercies, by resting
from all bodily labor in the day of our fast, and wholly abstaining from our
food, and all other comforts and delights of this life, so far forth as it
will stand with necessity of nature, charity, and comeliness; and much more by
forsaking all our sins, and doing the works of piety and charity; that by
this renewing of our humiliation and repentance, we may increase the feruency
of our prayers, and strengthen our faith in this assurance, that they shall be
graciously heard and granted unto us. In which description this religious fast,
being principally intended as an exercise of repentance, by which it is
increased, and as a help to our prayers that they may be more fervent, is
sufficiently distinguished from all other kinds of fasts. As first, from the
fast of necessity, for want of sustenance, or appetite to it; seeing this is
voluntary and at our free choice. Secondly, from that ordinary abstinence
whereby we temperately, soberly and sparingly feed upon Gods creatures, for
the satisfying of nature, and not the pleasing of our carnal lusts and
appetite (which is most commendable, as being of common and daily use, and the
other only to be used upon extraordinary occasions) seeing in this fast we
restrain our selves but in respect of some part of our food: whereas that
whereof we entreat, is a total abstinence for the time, both from all food,
and the most of our worldly comforts. Thirdly, from a physical fast, which is
prescribed and used for the cleansing of the stomach and body from ill humors,
and the preserving or recovering of our health; and from a politic fast
appointed by the Magistrate for civil ends, and the good of the Commonwealth;
seeing this is a religious fast, which aims only at such ends as are
spiritual, and tend to the health and welfare of our souls. Lastly, from a
moral fast, which is undertaken by those which are single and unmarried, for
the preserving of their chastity, and keeping their bodies from being defiled
with filthy lusts; seeing this is no solemn or extraordinary action, but to be
commonly put in practice, so often as we find it necessary; and seeing also it
aymeth at a far other end then this, of which I here speak, namely, the
preserving of chastity: Whereas the end of the religious fast is, by
humiliation and prayer to obtain some special suites at Gods hands.

. Sect. 2 That the duty of fing is not ceremonial, but eied Gospel, as well as
the Law.
Again, whereas I call it a religious act, I imply hereby that God is the
Author of it, and requires it at our hands, seeing he has restrained us in
all duties appertaining unto his service, that we worship him according to his
revealed will, and not according to our own inventions. Neither are we to
esteem it as a part of the ceremonial Law, which is abrogated by Christ; for
howsoever there were many rites about it of this nature, which now are some of
them abolished, and some out of use; as renting of their garments, wearing of
sackcloth, sitting in ashes, and covering their heads therewith, and such like;
yet in respect of the maine substance, which is the humbling of the soul
before God by all good means, that we may testify our repentance, and be made
more fervent in our prayers, Joel. 2. 12, 13, 14 Esa* 58. 5, 6, 7, etc. 2. Chro
20. 3.
as it was required of them more especially then the outward rites and
ceremonies in the time of the Law, so is it no less commended unto us under
the Gospel, to be religiously observed upon all extraordinary occasions. For
our Savior Christ purposely teaches us the right manner Mat. 6. 16. and 17.
21.
how i^ ought to be done; commends the efficacy of it being joined with
prayer; Luk 5 31, 35.
and shows that howsoever his Disciples used it not whilst he was with them,
because it was unseasonable for the children of the Bride chamber to fast, the
Bridegroom being with them, yet they should perform it when he was taken from
them. And thus it was accordingly practiced by the servants of God, not on
certain days and set times, but upon great and extraordinary occasions, not
only in the time of the Law, as by 2 Chro. 20. 3.
Iehosaphat and his people, by Dan. ^. 3 and ^0 2. 3.
Daniel, (...) 21.
Ezra, and the children of the captivity; by (...) 18, 19.
Queen Hester, her maids, Mordecay, and all the whole people of the Jews; but
in the New Testament also, by the (...). 14.
Disciples of John the Baptist, (...). 2, 3.
and by the Church, when they set apart Paul and Barnabas. By Luke 2. ^9.
Hannah the Prophetess, and Act. 10. 30.
Cornelius, who it seems frequently used this exercise (and not only upon
extraordinary occasions) that by the help thereof their prayers might be more
seruent and effectual to prevail with God, though it may be not in that
solemn manner, and with that deep humiliation, as is joined with this whereof
we speak. For this is to be performed, not ordinarily and so often as we pray,
but upon extraordinary occasions, as the Apostle implies, where he inioyneth
married persons not to defraud one another, unless by consent 1. Cor. 7. 4.
for a time, that they might give themselves to fasting and prayer, seeing he
must needs be understood of extraordinary fasting and prayer upon unusual and
weighty occasions, because ordinary prayer is to be used by them every day
together, without any necessity of such separation. So our Savior telling us
that the time of fasting is a time of mourning, implies that it is
unseasonable, but when we are occasioned to mourn upon some special and
weighty cause: for otherwise ordinarily Christians are to rejoice in the Lord,
as the Psalmist and the Apostle exhort; and Psalm. 33. 1. Phil. 4. 4. Esa. 22.
12.
not to mourn after this extraordinary manner, till God calls them unto it.
Finally, it is evident that this fasting ought not to be ordinary, seeing it is
a Sabbath of humiliation, wherein we are bound to rest from all our ordinary
labors and duties of our callings, in which we are ordinarily to spend our
time.

. Sect. 3 The causes of a true fast, and when it is most seasonable.
The cause which should move us to perform this duty of fasting, is, that we
may by more fervent and effectual prayer obtain at Gods hands some great and
extraordinary benefit; either privative or positive. Privative, as freedom,
and deliverance from some dangerous evil, either of sin or punishment. In
respect of the former; when we, or our Country in which we live, are guilty of
some grievous sin, and other means ordinarily used have not been effectual
to pull us out of it; or when some strong corruption does yet lie unmortified
in us, and prevails against us, notwithstanding our many purposes and
promises to subdue and root it out, then is this exercise seasonable, that
humbling our selves in an extraordinary manner, we may with all feruency
desire the assistance of Gods holy Spirit, for the healing of our selves and
the Land, by turning us unto God, and for pulling us out of these prevailing
and reigning sins, through serious and sound repentance; for the subduing of
our corruptions, that they may no more lead us captive unto sin, and
bringing of them in subjection to the spiritual part. And thus Paul, in the
sight and sense of his sins, especially that heinous wickedness, in
persecuting the Saints of God, in his first conversion, is said to have fasted
three days. Act. 9. 9, 11.
And Ezra with the people, humbled themselves by fasting before the Ezr. 9. 3,
6. and 10. 6. Neh. 9. 1, 2.
Lord, because they had grievously sinned by taking strange wines; the which
reigned and swayed so powerfully amongst them, that the authority of the
Magistrates and preaching of the Prophets, was not for a good while sufficient
to pull them out of it. The evil of punishment is also a sufficient motive to
make us humble our selves before God by fasting and prayer, and that either
when some heavy judgment is threatened and imminent, that we may auert it, or
already imposed, that we may be delivered out of it; whether it be private,
and concern our own person and family; or public, respecting either the
Church or Commonwealth. Concerning the first, when the heavy Judgments of God
are but threatened, and ready to light upon us, then the Lord especially calls
us to fasting and mourning, that unfeignedly repenting of our sins Esa. 22. 12.
which are the causes, the judgment which is the effect, may cease and be
auerted. And then this exercise is most seasonable and profitable, because the
sentence is more easily stayed then revoked, and the malefactor with less
suite acquitted or pardoned, then the execution put off after he once has his
doom; besides, that it is a greater benefit, and much more safe and sweet, to
be kept from the fire, then to be pulled out, like firebrarnds that are half
burned; and much more pleasing unto God, seeing he attaineth unto the end of
his threatenings, which is not to punish: for he delights Ezekiel. 33. 12. Micah
7. 18.
not in the smart of his children whom he corrects, but that by mature and
seasonable repentance we may escape, and so his mercy may be magnified in the
forgiveness of our sins. An example whereof we have in Iehosaphat, who by
humbling himself by fasting and prayer, escaped the invasion of his many and
mighty enemies; and in the Nineuites, who at Jonas preaching, repenting of
their sins, were spared and preserved from that imminent destruction which
was threatened against them. Neither are Gods threatenings absolute, but to be
understood with Ier. 18. 7, 8.
the condition of repentance, namely, that the punishment denounced shall be
inflicted, if we go on in our sins; but auerted, if we humble our selves
before God, and so leave and forsake our sins. But if we have neglected this
duty, till the Judgment have already seized upon us, then our best course is
to do it rather late then never, and to labor by our sound humiliation to
have our sins first pardoned, and then to have the punishment removed which
we have had no care to prevent. Whether it be a private judgment inflicted on
our selves, as sickness, poverty, losses, disgraces, and such like; or
public, lying upon the Church and Commonwealth, wherein we have our part and
share, either in our own persons, or by sympathy and compassion, as being
fellow members Judge. 2. 4, 5. and 3. 9. Dan. 9. 3. Ios. 7. 6. Joel 1 14. and 2.
12, 15.
of the same body, as the sword, captivity, pestilence, famine, and the rest.
So likewise this exercise is profitable, when we address our selves unto God
as humble suitors, for the obtaining of some special and important benefit,
which is no less necessary for the good estate of our selves or others, then
hard and unlikely to be obtained or achieved by any means of our own
deuizing. And thus it is fit that we should humble our selves before God by
fasting and prayer, when we undertake any weighty business, either for our
selves, or the good of the Church and Commonwealth; upon which occasion, Ezra,
Nehemiah, and Hester Ezr. 8. 21. Nehem. 1. 4, 13. Hest. 4. 16. Act. 13. 3.
fasted, and the Church, when they sent forth Barnabas and Paul about that
great work, the conversion of the Gentiles. But especially we have just cause
of thus humbling our selves, when we find some great defect in any of Gods
saving graces, and would labor earnestly with God by Prayer, that it may be
supplied, when we find our selves exceeding weak in faith, and desire to
have it increased and strengthened; when we feel our hearts hardened through
the deceitfulness of sin, so as we cannot repent, and would have them
suppled and softened, that they may resolve and melt in unfeigned sorrow for our
sins; when we find our affiance in God so feeble, that it is ready to faint
and fail in every small trial: or when we perceive want of gifts and
abilities in our selves, for the well performing of the duties of Christianity,
or of our callings, and would be suitors to him who is the Fountain and Author
of every good Iam. 1. 5, 17.
and perfect gift, that he will enable us, at least, with competency and
sufficiency of such gifts, as are necessary for the discharge of our duty, with
comfort to our selves, and profit to others; but especially so as Gods glory
may receive no damage or detriment.

. Sect. 4 The ends of a true fast.
And these are the causes which may move us to fasting. The ends at which we
must chiefly aim in this action, are of two sorts. The first and principal
is the glory of God, which we then most magnify, when we vilify and abase
our selves, acknowledging our great unworthiness of his least mercies, and
extolling his grace and goodness, in that he does not inflict upon us those
fearful Judgments which our sins have deserved. In which respect it is
quite contrary to the nature of a true Fast, if we propound this as the maine
end of it, that we may satisfy Gods Justice, and merit by it at Gods hand the
pardon of any of our sins, or the joys in heaven in any part or degree. For
such a Fast is fit for none but Pharisees and proud Iusticiaries, who would rob
God of the glory of his free grace and mercy, and our Savior Christ of the
all-sufficiencie of his merits and satisfaction, that they may in some part
arrogate it unto themselves, by having some share in the praise of their
justification and salvation. And they who thus fast, the Lord may justly charge
them, as he did the hypocritical Jews, that they fast to themselves, and not
unto him, for their own glory, Zach. 7. 5, 6.
and not for his. But so far should we be from thinking that by our fasting,
we merit justification and salvation, that we should not by the deed done,
suppose that any thing is added to our Justice or Sanctity, seeing Fasting it
self is no essential part of Gods service or religious duty, but only a
help and means to enable and fit us for them; neither is abstinence in it
own nature more acceptable unto God then eating and drinking. To which purpose
an ancient Writer Cave, ne si ieiunare aut abstinere caeperis, te putes esse
iam sanctum: haec enim virtus adiumentum est, non perfectio sanctitatis, etc.
Hieron. ad Celant.
speaks excellently: Take heed (says he) when thou beginnest to fast and
abstain, thou do not now think thy self holy: For this virtue is but an
help, and not the perfection of Holiness. And thou art the rather to take
heed, lest this (when thou contemnest things lawful) do make thee secure in
doing things unlawful. Whatsoever is offered unto God over and above justice,
ought not to hinder justice, but to help it. And what does it profit to make
the body thin and lean with fasting, if thy mind swells with pride? The
subordinate ends which respect our selves, are diverse. First, that hereby we
may subdue and mortify our flesh and carnal corruption, that they may not be
any hindrance unto us in spiritual duties, as they are most prone to be when
as they are pampred with worldly delights, growing thereby more sensual,
forgetful of God, auerse unto all good duties, Luke 21. 34.
and secure in all sinful courses. Secondly, that hereby we may testify our
humiliation and repentance, our sorrow for our sins, and how much we are
displeased with our selves, because by them we have displeased God; and our
unworthiness of Gods least mercies, and of the use of his creatures, which we
have so often abused to his dishonor and our own hurt. Thirdly, that we may
hereby stir up our devotion, and increase our feruencie in our prayers, that
they may be more effectual and powerful to prevail with God, for the
obtaining of Joel 2. 17.
those blessings, for which we are humble suitors unto him. Lastly, that thus
humbling our selves under Gods mighty hand, and adiudging our selves to
deserved punishments, we may escape his fearful Judgments; for if we judge
our selves, we shall not be judged of the Lord. 1. Cor. 11. 32.


CAP. XXXV.
Of the parts of a true Fast, or the things wherein it consists.

. Sect. 1 That the outward fast consists in total abstinence.
THe next point to be considered, is the parts of this Fast, or the things
wherein it chiefly consists. For either this Fast is outward and bodily, or
inward and Spiritual. The former being a help to the latter, and the latter,
the end of the former. The bodily Fast, is our abstinence for the time that it
continues from the most of the commodities and comforts of this life, so far
forth as will stand with charity and comeliness, and a cessation from all our
ordinary affairs and labors, because it is to be kept as a Sabbath Leuit. 23.
28.
of humiliation unto the Lord. The commodities of this life are many, the
chief whereof are meats and drinks, from which we must totally abstain in
all kinds whilst the Fast continues, so far forth as will Ezra. 10. 6.
stand with the health of our bodies, and the advancing of those ends which we
principally intend in this exercise. If our health will bear it, we must not
content our selves with the sober use of the creatures as at other times, but
wholly abstain from them, according to the example Hest. 4. 16. Jonah 3. 7.
Act. 9. 9.
of the faithful in all ages; seeing in this exercise one maine thing, at
which we aim, is to humble our selves before God, acknowledging, that we are
utterly unworthy of the least of his benefits for the preserving of our lives.
But if in respect of our weakness, such total abstinence will hazard our
health, we may eat or drink so much as the necessity of our state requires,
seeing the Lord desires Hos. 6. 7.
mercy rather then sacrifice, and enioyneth this bodily abstinence, that it
may help and further us, and not disable us for the spiritual duties of his
service, as it must needs, if our spirits be exhausted, and our bodies
weakened, so that there remains no virtue nor vigor in them, to perform
them in any cheerful and devout manner. And this liberty the Ancients have
given, who otherwise were the strictest exactors of this exercise. Overmuch
weakness of the body (says one) does Isidor. de summo bono.
weaken the powers of the soul, and makes the Fast of the mind barren, so
that it is able to do no good thing by reason of this imbecility. The body
(says another) is to be handled somewhat austerely, Durius tractandum est
corpus ne rebellet, ne insolescat; sic tamen vt seruire sufficiat, etc. Bernard.
that it may not rebel and wax insolent, but so, as it may be fit for
employment, because it is given that it may serve the soul. It must be
restrained, not wasted; burdened, not tired; humbled, that it may not insult;
and serve, that it may not rule. But more plainly and directly another
speaks to this purpose. If thou can not (beloved) through Etenim (dilecte)
si ob corporis imbecillitatem non potes ieiunus diem perducere, etc. Chrysostom.
in Genesis 2. Homil. 10. T. 1.
bodily infirmity hold out the whole days Fast, no man that is wise will blame
thee for this. For we have a gentle and merciful Lord, who exacteth nothing of
us above our strength. Neither does he simply require Fasting and abstinence,
nor that we should remain so long fasting, but that withdrawing our selves
from worldly and carnal works, we should spend our time in spiritual
exercises. And yet we must take heed that we do not abuse this liberty unto
licentiousness, seeing it is never good, but when it is necessary; and much
better it is, if our strength will bear it, that we wholly abstain from all
food for the day of our Fast, for diverse reasons. For first, God requires in
our Fast, that we afflict our selves, the body by abstinence, the Leuit. 23. 29.
mind by sorrow and humiliation. Secondly, hereby we come to a more through
sense and feeling of our unworthiness of Gods benefits. Thirdly, we become
more devout and fervent in prayer, and the body being less dull and heavy, is
made a more fit instrument unto the soul for spiritual exercises. Fourthly,
our bodily hunger, through emptiness of food, may make us more sensibly to
conceive of the souls emptiness of saving graces, that we may hunger and
thirst after them, and use all good means whereby we may be filled and
satisfied.

. Sect. 2 That we must in our Fast abstain for the most part from all worldly
comforts.
And as we must thus totally abstain from meats and drinks, so must we in
the greatest part, from all other bodily and worldly comforts Col. 4. 2. Ephesians.
6. 18.
and delights, and much more moderate our selves in the use of them, so far
forth as will stand with necessity and comeliness, then at other times. Thus
we must abridge our selves from some part of our ordinary sleep, that by this
bodily waking, we may be more ready to keep the spiritual watch, and have
more time to spend in religious and spiritual duties; as also that we may
hereby testify our humiliation, acknowledging our selves unworthy, as of other
blessings, so of our ordinary rest and sleep. To which purpose the Faithful
2. Sam. 12. 16. Joel 1. 16.
under the Law did lie upon the ground, and in sackcloth and hard beds, that
lying thus uneasily, they might take the less rest. Wherein our care must be,
that we so perform this bodily exercise, as that it do not the next day
disable us for Gods spiritual service, as hearing the Word and prayer, which
are the ends of it, by making us drowzy and sleepie through overmuch watching.
Secondly, we must moderate our selves in the use of our apparel, putting on
our worst attire, which may be most fit to signify and also further our
humiliation. And in any case for that time to forbear such show of bravery in
our Exodus 33. 5, 6.
garments, either in respect of the costlinesse of the stuff or fashion, as
may in the eyes of others be an ensign of our pride, and in our own hearts
the fuel of it. And much less are we at such times to use light and vain
fashions, frizling of the hair, and painting of the 1. Pet. 5. 5.
face, which if they be at all times unlawful and utterly mis-beseeming
Christians, whose best ornaments are humility and modesty, then surely are
they in the day of our humiliation odious and abominable. Thirdly, we must
abstain this day from all carnal and worldly Quod si gula sola peccauit, sola
quoque ieiunet, and sufficit. Si vero peccauerunt and caetera membra, cur non
ieiunent and ipsa, etc? Bernard de ieiunio, Quadrages. Sermon 3. Joel 2. 16. 1.
Cor. 7. 5.
delights, and pleasing the senses, which would lessen our sorrow for our
sins, hinder our humiliation, and abstract our minds from spiritual duties.
And as we must not delight the taste with meats and drinks, so neither the
eyes with delightful sights, nor the cares with pleasant music, and witty
and merry discourses, nor the smell with sweet odours; especially the use of
the marriage bed is to be forborne, even of the bride and bridegroom, and much
more of others; and recreations in all kinds, which are at other times lawful
and necessary for the refreshing and chearing of the heart and mind. Lastly,
we must in the day of our fast abstain from all worldly businesses and works
of our callings, seeing it is to be observed as a Sabbath and day of rest in
the strictest kind; for the Lord inioyneth us, Leuit. 23. 36. Esa. 58. 13.
that in this Sabbath of humiliation, we do not our own pleasures, walk in
our own ways, nor speak our own words. The which rest is necessary on this
Day, that we may consecrate it wholly unto the Lord, by spending it in the
duties of his service without distraction; and also that we may hereby be put
in mind of our rest from sin; for if the works of our callings which are
lawful in themselves, may not on this Day be lawfully done; then how odious
must we needs think will it be unto God, if doing the works of darkness,
we serve the world, the devil and our own flesh? Now the time of this bodily
exercise which it is to continue, may be diverse, in respect of the diverse
occasions which require greater or lesser humiliation, and the diverse states of
men's bodies, as they are able to hold out in this exercise without impayring of
their health. The ordinary time of a fast is the space of four and twenty
hours, or of a natural day, from supper time on one day, to supper time on
another, or from dinner to dinner; though this be less fit and more rarely
used, because it should be a whole day, that is consecrated unto God as a
Sabbath of humiliation, and not part of two days. So the Lord inioyning it,
says; It shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict Leuit. 23.
36. Iud. 20. 26. Jos. 7. 6. 2. Sam. 1 12. and 3. 35.
your souls in the ninth day of the month at even, from even to even shall
you celebrate your Sabbath. The which was accordingly observed by the faithful
from time to time. But when the occasion has been extraordinarily great, and
the causes of humiliation of greatest weight and importance, the faithful have
prolonged the time of their fast, to testify their sorrow for their sin so
much the more, and that with greater feruency they might implore Gods mercy for
the deliverance of them from some imminent danger of fearful destruction. In
which case, Hester and the Jews continued their fast three days together,
Daniel Hest 4. 16, 17. Dan. 10. 2, 3. Act. 9* 9.
one and twenty days, Paul three days, to the end that having a longer time
for this exercise, their humiliation might be the greater, and their hearts
more thoroughly touched with a through sense of their sins, and with a lively
feeling of their distressed estates, then they could have been in a shorter
time.

. Sect. 3 Of the inward and spiritual exercises in our fast.
The second part of the Christian fast, is the inward and spiritual exercise,
which is the end of the outward, and without which it is of no 1. Tim. 4. 8.
Romans 14. 17.
value: for as the Apostle tells us, Bodily exercise profits little, but
godliness is profitable unto all things; and The Kingdom of God consists
not in meats and drinks, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy
Ghost. In which regard the Lord has always rejected the outward fast as
hypocritical and superstitious, if the inward fast were not joined with it.
Thus he charge the Jews, that they fasted to themselves and not to him,
when they rested in the external abstinence and bodily humiliation; and
tells them, that if they would keep a fast which should be acceptable unto
him, they must execute judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to
his brother, and not oppress the fatherless, Zach. 7. 5, 6, 9 10.
stranger and poor, nor so much as imagine evil against their brother in
their heart. So elsewhere he rejects the fast of the Jews, because therein
they only afflicted their souls with bodily abstinence, and did hang down
their heads like a bulrush for a day, and did spread sackcloth Esa. 58. 3. to
the 8.
and ashes under them, but did not join with it the Spiritual fast, in
abstaining from carnal pleasures and covetous exactions, losing the bonds of
wickedness, and undoing the heavy burdens, ceasing from oppression, and doing
the works of mercy. To which purpose one demands; What does Quid prodest
quod of fligis corpus tuum, quando nihil proficit cor tuu^? Eusebius. emiss. ad
Monach. Homil. 4.
it profit thee that thou afflictest thy body, when as thine heart is never the
better? To fast and watch, and not to amend thy manners, is all one, as if a
man should take pains to weed and husband the ground about the vineyard, but
let the vineyard it self grow like a desert, full of thorns and thistles.

. Sect. 4 Of humiliation and penitencie in the time of our fast.
Now this spiritual and inward exercise is nothing else, but a serious
humiliation of our souls before God, joined with fervent prayer and unfeigned
repentance, that we may find grace with God, and have our special suites
heard and granted. The first thing is humiliation or penitency, unto which is
required; First, a through sense and feeling of our sins, whereby we have
provoked Gods anger against us. Secondly, unfeigned sorrow and bitter grief,
chiefly in this respect, because by our sins we have displeased and
dishonored our glorious God and gracious Father, unto which we must attain,
by considering and aggravating our sins, in respect of the quantity and
quality, their number and haynousnesse, by meditating on Gods Judgments and
Mercies, the curse and threatenings of the Law, and the gracious promises of the
Gospel; on Gods gloriousness in himself, and graciousnesse toward us; that
by our sins we have pierced ad crucified our Savior Christ, and caused the
Lord of life to be put to a shameful death, vexed and grieved Gods good Spirit
dwelling in us, slandered our profession, given offense to our neighbors, and
drawn upon our selves Gods heavy punishments in this life and the life to
come, and especially the present Judgment which we fear as imminent, or feel
as being already inflicted upon us. Thirdly, A vile and base conceit of our
selves in respect of our sins, whereby we adiudge our selves as utterly
unworthy of Gods least mercies, and contrariwise, that we have deserved the
greatest of his plagues, and not only that which we presently fear or feel,
but all other punishments temporal and eternal. Lastly, in this humiliation
we are to express our sorrow and grief of heart, by our lamentations and
woeful complaints, bewailing our wretched condition both in respect of sin
and punishment, and bemoning our misery before the Lord, as a fit subject,
whereon he may exercise his abundant and rich mercies, in pardoning our
sins, and removing our punishments.

. Sect. 5 That prayer must be joined with our fasting. Ieiunium orationem
roborat, oration ieiunium sanctificat, Bernard. in Quadrages. Sermon. 4.
The second thing required in the spiritual exercise, is effectual prayer;
for this is that which gives virtue and vigor to our fasting, even as fasting
helps and strengthens prayer. And here first we must begin with humble
confession of our sins, principally insisting upon those whereby we have most
displeased and dishonored God, and drawn upon our selves his present
Judgments. The which we may profitably aggrauate by all their particular
circumstances (as before I have showed) but chiefly because we have committed
them Psalm. 5^. 4. Nehe. 5. Ezr. 9. 6. Dan. 9. 51.
against such a gracious God, who has multiplied upon us so many favors and
testimonies of his love, respecting our souls, bodies and estates, this life
and the life to come. Unto which confession we must adioyne the adiudging and
condemning of our selves to deserved punishments both temporal and
everlasting, this which we fear or feel, and all others with it, if God
should deal with us according to our deserts. By which confession and
condemning of our selves, we shall glorify God, both by justifying his
righteous Judgments, and magnifying his Mercies, either because he delivers
us out of our afflictions, or Lam. 3. 22.
does not inflict them in a measure proportionable to our sins. Secondly,
hereby we shall increase our humiliation and sorrow for our sins, when as we
thus rip them up and recount them, and (as it were) set them in order before
us. And finally, we shall hereby much strengthen our faith in the assurance of
the pardon of them, seeing if we confess Pro. 28. 13. 1. John 1. 7.
our sins, the Lord will vouchsafe mercy; if we acknowledge them, he is
faithful and righteous to forgive them. And consequently we may be assured,
that our present judgments shall be auerted or removed, when as sin, which
is the cause of them, is done away; or if they be continued, that their nature
shall be changed, seeing they shall cease to Heb. 12. 6. Apoc. 3. 19. Romans 8.
28. 2. Cor. 4. 17.
be punishments, which are inflicted to satisfy Gods Justice, and shall be
unto us the chastizements of a gracious Father, signs of our adoption,
testimonies of his love, and much further our spiritual enriching with all
saving graces, and the eternal salvation of our souls. In which assurance of
faith, grounded upon Gods infinite mercies and free promises, we are to
proceed in making our suits known unto God, either for our freedom and
deliverance from evil, by deprecation, or the obtaining of some good by
petition. For after that we have made our peace with God, and obtained by
unfeigned humiliation and confession, the assurance of the remission of our
sins, we must in the next place become suitors at the Throne of grace, in the
mediation of Jesus Christ, that the Lord will be pleased for his own mercies,
and his merits, to remove the Judgments which our sins have drawn upon us.
And thus the Lord having proclaimed a Fast to his people, does prescribe unto
them a form of deprecation, after that they were humbled, and had bewailed
their sins: Let the Ministers Joel. 2. 17.
(says he) weep and say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine
heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them. The which was
also practiced by Daniel and Nehemiah in their fasts, where after the Dan. 9.
5, 16, 17. Neh. 9. 32.
confession of their own and the peoples sins, they crave pardon and
deliverance out of their afflictions. In which suites for freedom out of our
miseries, we are to strengthen our faith in this assurance, that we shall be
heard, by Gods special promises which he has made, Matthew. 7. 7. Ioh. 16. 23.
Psalm. 50. 15. Joel. 2. 12, 13.
that he will hear our prayers, and above all other times, when we call upon
him in the day of trouble. Or if the sentence being pronounced, cannot be
revoked, let us humbly sue unto God, that he will at least accomplish his
promises, in sanctifying our afflictions unto us, that they may not be
punishments for our sins, but chastisements for our amendment, means to
mortify our corruptions, to weane us from the world, to strengthen and
increase his graces in us, faith, hope, affiance, love, patience, humility, the
fear of God, and the rest; and that they may be as strong cords to draw us
nearer unto God, and as sharp spurs and goads in our sides, to prick us
forward in the ways of godliness. Unto which deprecation, we are to join
petition, whereby we must crave at Gods hands whatsoever good thing we stand
in need of; as peace of conscience, following justification, sanctification,
and the gracious assistance of Gods Spirit, for the mortifying of our
corruptions, and our spiritual quickening unto newnes of life, for the
replenishing of our hearts with all saving graces, and the strengthening of us
to all good duties, with perseverance unto the end, and that we may be enabled
to withstand all the assaults of our spiritual enemies, who labor to hinder
our course in godliness, and to turn us into the broad way that leads to
destruction. More specially, we must pray according to the present occasion of
our fast; as if it be some grievous sins which we have committed, that the
Lord will not only graciously forgive them, but strengthen us with his grace
and holy Spirit, that we may not again fall into them; and enrich us with the
contrary graces, that we may honor him thereby for the time to come, as we
have dishonored him by our sins in times past. If it be for deliverance from
some great danger, or out of some great affliction, that then the Lord will be
pleased to give us the contrary safety and security, by taking us into his
protection, and under the shadow of his wings; or that he will vouchsafe to
bestow upon us the contrary blessings and and benefits, if in his wisdom he
sees that they are fit for us: As health in stead of sickness, honor for
disgrace, plenty for penury, peace for war, and such like. The which our
petitions, as at all other times, so especially in the Joel. 1. 14. Jonas 3. 8.
Dan. 9. 19.
time of our fast, must be joined with extraordinary feruency, and such
importunity as will receive no repulse, according to the waightinesse of the
occasion, which makes us in this extraordinary manner to humble our Psalm. 50.
15. Joel 2. 18, 19. Hest. 9. 22. 2. Chron. 20. Dan. 9. Ezra 8. 13.
selves before God. And also with a special faith, that the Lord will hear,
not only all our prayers agreeable to his will, which we make in his Sons
name, but also our special suits which we have now made in the time of our
fast, so far forth as it will stand with his glory, and our own salvation. The
which our faith must be grounded upon Gods gracious promises; and strengthened,
by calling to mind the examples of Gods Saints from time to time, who having
thus humbled themselves, and prayed in the time of their troubles, have found
help and deliverance at Gods hands.

. Sect. 6 That with our fasting we must join unfeigned repentance.
The last thing thing required in our fast is, that we join with it unfeigned
repentance; for this is the principal end of the outward exercise, that we may
thereby both testify and also increase our repentance. And unto this, two
things are required; the first is, that we forsake our sins which we have
bewailed; and secondly, that we embrace the contrary virtues, and express
them in the duties of a godly life. Concerning the former, it little avails
us to abstain outwardly from our food, and other comforts of this life, which
are the gifts of God, and in their own nature lawful, if we live still in our
sins, and will not turn from them unto God by unfeigned repentance; to rest
from the honest labors of our callings, and not to rest from the works of
darkness, wherein we perform service unto sin and Satan; to pine the body
with outward abstinence, and to pamper the flesh by satisfying of our carnal
lusts, to have empty Esa. 58. 3, 4. Zach. 7. 10.
bellies and clean teeth, and to have our souls replenished with wickedness,
and defiled with sinful corruptions. In which regard the Lord condemns and
rejects the fast of the Jews, because they rested in the bodily exercise,
and did not forsake their carnal lusts, exactions and oppressions. What does
it profit (says one) to make thy body thin and Quid autem pro^est ^enua^i
abstinentia c^rpus si animus (...), etc? Hieron. ad Celantiam. (...) carnis
refraene^^^^. and verum s^ru^mu^ iciunium, etc. Chrysostom. in Genesis 1. Hom. 8.
Honor(...). ^^iun^^, (...)um abst^^^^tia, sed peccatorum f^ga. Chrysostom. ad
pop. Ant^o^hen. Homil. 3.
lean with fasting, if thy mind do swell with pride? What praise will thou
deserve, by the palenesse of fasting, if thou be pale also with envy? What
virtue is in this, not to drink wine, and in the mean while to be drunk
with anger and hatred? But our abstinence is praiseworthy, and the chastening
of the body, of some excellency, when as the mind fasteth from vices, etc. Let
us (says another) bridle our fleshly lusts, and we shall keep a true fast.
For that I call a fast, when we abstain from vices. And therefore abstinence
from meats is required, that we may subdue the unruly power of the flesh, and
by curbing in this pampered horse, teach it to obey. And again; The honor of
a fast is not abstinence from meats, but the forsaking of our sins, etc. For
it is most absurd to refrain by fasting from lawful meats, and to taste the
unlawful lusts of the eyes? Do thou not eat flesh? neither let thine eyes
draw in wanton lusts. Let thine ear also fast, by not receiving slanders and
detractions. And let thy mouth fast from filthy and reproachful words. For what
will it avail us to fast only like birds and fishes (or like the beasts of
Nineue) if we bite and devour our brethren? But with most diligent care must
we forsake our beloved sins, and those wherewith we have most offended our
gracious God, as being the chief causes which have drawn upon us Gods present
Judgments. Against which we must bend our chief forces, that we may not only
lay them aside, like our garments ouer-night, which we purpose to put on again
the next day, but utterly forsake them, mortify and subdue them, that they may
never again prevail against us. To which purpose we must renew our covenant
with God, and strengthen our resolutions, if we have formerly found them weak
and unconstant, by making a solemn vow, that we will, upon no occasion,
wittingly and willingly fall into those sins again, for which we have now
humbled our selves before the Lord in this present exercise.

. Sect. 7 That we must in our fast, exercise our selves in all Christian duties.
The second part of repentance, which we must both profess and practice, is,
that ceasing from evil, we do that which is good, exercising our selves in
all Christian duties, both toward God, and our neighbors, both in the day of
our fast, and afterward. In respect of that present time, we must, with
extraordinary care and diligence, exercise our selves in all good works, and
principally in the duties of piety, and of Gods service; as prayer, hearing and
reading of Gods Word, holy conferences, and meditation, the subject matter
whereof may fitly be repentance, of which I have before spoken; all which,
according to the occasion, are to be performed with more then ordinary zeal
and devotion. And these duties of piety toward God, we must approve to be
sincere and without hypocrisy, by our works of justice and righteousness,
mercy and compassion toward our neighbors. For in the day of our fast, the
Lord specially requires, that we should execute judgment, and show mercy and
Zach. 7. 9. Esa. 58. 6.
compassion every man to his brother, that we should loose the bands of
wickedness, undo the heavy burden, let the oppressed go free, and break
every yoke. For therefore (as one says) we restrain our minds from desiring
meat, that Idcirco a varijs ciborum desiderijs mentem retrahunt, vt totam eius
vim occupent in cupidita^e virtutum, etc. Hieron. ad Celantiam.
we may exercise their whole force in coveting after virtues. And so our flesh
will less feel the pain of abstinence, when it hungreth after
righteousness. But especially we must, in this day, exercise our charity in
the works of mercy, and in relieuing the poor. To which uses we must at
least spend so much as we spare from our selves and our families by our fast,
or else we give just cause of suspicion, that we fast more out of
miserableness then devotion, being content to fast, that all our servants may
bear us company, and so by emptying their and our own bellies, to add
something toward the filling of our bags. And this the Lord specially
requires in the day of our fast; namely, that we should deal our bread to
Esa. 58. 7, 10.
the hungry, and bring the poor that are cast out, into our house, that when
we see the naked, we should clothe him, and that we hide not our selves from
our own flesh; that we should draw out our souls to the hungry, and satisfy
the afflicted soul. Which duties if we neglect, we may be justly charged that
we fast rather with the Jews, to our selves, then unto the Lord; having more
regard Math. 6.
to our profit, then to piety or charity. As therefore our Savior has joined
these three together in his doctrine, so must we (after the example of good
Cornelius) conioyne them in our practice; for our fasting will be Act. 10.
Misericordia and pietas ieiunij. sunt alae, etc. Chrysostom. in sermon. de ieiun.
and eleemos.
maimed and of no worth, if it be severed from either of them. Mercy (says
one) and piety are the wings of fasting, by which it mounteth aloft into
heaven, and without which, it lies and walloweth upon the earth. Fasting
without mercy, is but a picture of hunger, and image of holiness. Without
piety, fasting is but an occasion of covetousness; for what is spared from the
body, is put into the bag. He that fasteth not to the poores advantage, lies
unto God; and he who when he fasteth does not bestow his dinner upon the poor,
but lays it up in store, does plainly show, that he fasteth for
covetousness, and not for Christ's sake, etc. And these are the works wherein
we must exercise our selves in the day of our fast: which must not end when it
ends, but be continued in some good measure for ever after. For as we must
then resolve, that we will, in the whole course of our lives afterward, be
more careful and conscionable in all our ways, and more earnest and diligent
in performing all good duties unto God, our neighbors, and our selves, so if
we would approve our purpose to be sincere, we must endeavor accordingly to
put it in practice, and use all good means which may enable us heereunto.
Where, for a conclusion of this discourse of fasting, we may observe, that if
it be used aright, and as God requires, it must needs be a singular good help
to the leading of a godly life, seeing nothing more humbles us in the sight
and sense of our sins and spiritual wants, nor does make us more hunger
after grace with a vehement appetite, nor does make us more fervent and earnest
in our prayers, for the obtaining spiritual strength to serve God, and to
withstand the tentations of all our spiritual enemies; nor finally, that more
exercises and increases our repentance, our sorrow for our sins past, and
purpose of amendment for the time to come, by serving God with more zeal and
diligence in all Christian duties of piety and holiness in his own worship,
in the works of righteousness, and mercy toward our brethren, of temperance
and sobriety in respect of our own persons.

CAP. XXXVI.
Of the arguments and reasons which may move us to lead a godly life; and
first, such as respect Gods nature, works, and love toward us.

. Sect. 1 The first sort of reasons taken from Gods nature and attributes.
HItherto we have entreated of the real and practical means, whereby we may
be enabled to lead a godly life. And now it follows that we propound some
reasons and arguments which may effectually persuade us, both to use these
means, and also to perform all the duties of holiness and righteousness,
unto which by these means we are enabled; seeing it would little avail us to
have all the helps of godliness, unless we have also hearts to use them. And
because the reasons which might be produced to this purpose, are innumerable,
seeing there is scarce any part of Gods Word or works, either of Creation or
Government, which does not yield some motive unto godliness; therefore passing
by the most which might be alleged, it shall suffice, as briefly as I can, to
touch some of the chief and principal; all which I will reduce unto three
heads, either as they respect God, our neighbors, or our selves. The arguments
of the first sort, either respect God himself, his nature and attributes, both
generally considered, and as he exercises them toward us; or that duty which
we are bound to perform unto him. Concerning the former, there cannot be any
more forcible reasons alleged, for the persuading of us to serve God in duties
of a godly life, then a through consideration of Gods nature and attributes. For
first, he is the only true God, Jehovah, the most absolute Being, who having
his Essence in and from himself, gives being to all things; and therefore to
be served by all creatures, and especially by us, seeing in him we live, move,
and have our being. He is God, infinite Act. 17. 28.
in all perfection, and therefore ought in all things, according to his nature,
to be served with absolute and perfect obedience. He is infinite, and
therefore the actions of all things finite must tend unto him, and be
determined in him, as their supreme end. And being infinite, he is but one
only God, and therefore requires our whole service, there being none other to
be worshipped and served but he alone. He is an holy Spirit, and therefore must
be served, not only outwardly with our bodies, but also with our souls, in
spirit and truth. He is in his nature most pure Joh. 4. 24.
and simple, without mixture or composition, and therefore we must yield unto
him simple and pure obedience, without any by-respect, or the mixture of humane
inventions with his most pure and perfect will. He is eternal, and is
therefore to be served and glorified in all ages, and from the beginning to the
end of times, seeing he is to day, yesterday and Heb. 13. 8.
the same for ever, and always lives to reward those that serve him, and to
take vengeance of them who rebel against him. He is immutable and unchangeable
in himself, and in his love, goodness, bounty, mercy, and justice toward us,
and therefore ought to be served of us daily and constantly, without any leuity
or wavering, seeing there is no change in him toward us. He is immense and
omniscient, so that wheresoever we are, we are in his presence; whatsoever we
do, we are in his sight; and therefore we are always and in all places to
carry our selves in all dutiful obedience, as being ever in the view of our
Lord and Master, who stands by and takes notice of all our actions. He is
all-sufficient to reward our service, and to preserve all those who depend upon
him against all enemies; and therefore we must not be discouraged in his
service by any worldly or spiritual wants, seeing he is abundantly able to
supply them, nor by the adverse attempts of any that oppose us, seeing he
alone, though, we had no other helps, is sufficient to protect us, and to
bring to naught, whatsoever might or malice seeks to hinder us in the ways
of godliness. He is God blessed for ever, yea, blessedness it self, in whose
fruition consists all happiness, and therefore ought to be served with all
the powers of our bodies and minds, seeing he only is able to make us blessed.
He is Almighty, and able to do whatsoever pleases him; the which also should
effectually withdraw us from all 1. Cor. 10. 22. Ier. 7. 19.
sin, seeing thereby we provoke him to wrath, who is powerful to punish us;
and move us to serve him in all Christian duties, seeing having all power in
heaven, and earth, he is able to reward us in our weldoing. He is true, yea,
truth it self, and in this regard ought to be served, seeing he will most
assuredly make good all his gracious promises, which he has made to all that
serve and please him; and contrariwise will bring to pass all his fearful
threatenings against those, who neglect and disobey his commandments. His will
is absolutely good, and the most perfect rule of righteousness; and therefore
our wills and actions must be conformable unto it, seeing so far as they
digress and differ, they are wicked, crooked and erroneous. So also the Lord
is good, yea, the chief and supreme Goodness, unto which all things are to be
destinated as their principal and supreme end; the which should make us deuote
our selves wholly unto his service, seeing thereby both we and our actions do
attain unto their supreme end and chief perfection; and contrariwise become
vain and to no purpose, if we and they be not thus employed. He is holy, yea,
holiness it self, and therefore ought to be served in holiness and
righteousness of all that approach near unto him, and would be esteemed of his
family; for being himself holy, he delights in those who are like him in
holiness, neither can his pure eyes endure sinful pollution, as being most
contrary to his divine nature. He is gracious, bountiful and munificent; and
therefore is to be served with all diligence and cheerfulness, seeing he who
is so beneficent and liberal to all his creatures, will be unspeakably
bountiful toward those who glorify him by their willing obedience. He is
loving and gracious, yea, Grace and Love it self, and therefore being also
infinitely lovely, deserves worthily all love, and that we should bring forth
the fruits of it, by doing all things that are pleasing in his sight. He is
most merciful, gentle, patient and long-suffring, and therefore is to be
served with all cheerfulness and comfort, seeing he is so merciful, that he
pardons all our sins; so mild and gentle, that he passes by all our
infirmities; so patient and long-suffring, that when we are slack and
slothful in our duty, he does not presently inflict deserved punishment, but
bears with us, and expects our amendment. He is just, yea, Justice it
self, the which also should make us spend all our time in his service; seeing
without any respect of persons Act. 10. 34.
he is the same to all that obey him, and will not fail to recompense to the
full our labor of love, nor to give unto us that rich and inestimable wages,
wherewith he has graciously bound himself by covenant, to reward our service;
nor contrariwise to inflict deserved punishments upon those, who being bound to
serve him, neglect their duty. And thus also those attributes which are
improperly ascribed unto God, as showing rather his actions then affections,
and his works toward us, rather then his nature in himself, may also yield
unto us powerful reasons which may move us to serve him. As his anger and
hatred against sin and sinners (which is nothing but his rewarding Justice,
recompencing them as they have deserved) may move us effectually to flee all
sin and wickedness; seeing his wrath is a consuming fire, and we like stubble
before it, in which regard it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the everliving God. His joy, whereby he Heb. 10. 31.
delights himself in those that fear and love him, and so also replenisheth
them with all joy and happiness in the fruition of him and his love. His
sorrow and displeasure, when we unkindly grieve him by our sins, who has
been so kind unto us; and if we make him sorry who is our joy, who shall glad
our hearts in the day of our sorrow, and comfort us in our mourning? His
repenting in doing unto us the good he has promised, when we do evil, and
in bringing upon us his Judgments threatened, when we turn from our sins, and
reconcile our selves unto him by our well-doing. Finally, his jealousy which is
mixed of love and anger, should make us wholly deuote our selves to his service,
seeing he can abide no corriuals in our love and duty, but will be loved and
served with all our hearts, and with all our souls, and therefore we must not
divide our selves between God, Matthew. 22. 37.
and the devil, the world and our own sinful lusts, but we must consecrate
Romans 12. 1. 1. Cor. 5. 20.
our bodies and souls unto the service of God alone in the duties of a godly
life, seeing he is a jealous God, who is impatient of any copartners, and will
have all or none.

. Sect. 2 The second reason, taken from Gods love toward us.
The works also of God do yield unto us most effectual reasons, to persuade
us unto all duties of a godly life, but especially his manifold and inestimable
benefits, which he has vouchsafed to bestow upon us, whether we consider the
Fountain from which they all spring, or the blessings and benefits themselves,
which as streams do issue and flow from them. The fountain of them all, is
his divine and incomprehensible love, whereby, of his free grace and mere
goodness, Ier. 31. 3.
he has loved us from all eternity, without any respect of our deserts and
worthiness. The which he has manifested, when as we were dead in our sins,
and the children of wrath as well as others, when we Ephesians. 2. 1, 3.
were weak and of no strength, having not so much as any power to desire Romans
5. 8, 10.
his favor and mercy, to free and deliver us out of our woeful misery. When
as we were like poor impotent infants, newborn, whose Navel was not cut,
and who wallowed in the filthy and bloody Ezech. 16. 4, 5, 6
gore of our natural corruptions, no eye pitying us, nor having any friend,
that was able to help us, or to wash us clean from our corruption. For even
then when we were helpelesse and hopeless, this love moved him to take
compassion on us, and to say unto us whilst we were in our blood, You shall
live. And when we were so deep stained, yea, even in-grained in the filthy
dye of our sins, that all the waters in the world could not make us clean,
he in this incomprehensible love, gave his Son to the death, that we might be
washed in the Lauer of his precious blood, and so purged from our crimson and
scarlet sins, Esa. 1. 26.
both in respect of the guilt, punishment and corruption of them, that thereby
we are restored unto a snowie whiteness, and being washed with the blood of
his innocent Son, are recovered and cleansed from our incurable Leprosy. O
how ought this unspeakable love to affect and warm our frozen hearts with
unfeigned love toward him again! How should our souls cleave unto him, and be
inflamed with most fervent affection toward him, who being infinite in all
goodness and perfection, and needed neither us, nor any thing from us, yet
vouchsafed to set his Love upon us, who were so unlovely and unworthy, yea, so
sinful and wicked, that we justly deserved his wrath and fearful
vengeance? How can we choose, if we thoroughly consider this, but have our hearts
thoroughly inflamed with most fervent affection toward him, who is the chief
Goodness, most amiable in himself, and most gracious unto us? How can we
sufficiently express our love, by doing or suffering any thing for his sake?
How fearful should this make us to offend him, and how careful in all things
to please him? How zealous should we be of his glory, and how diligent and
cheerful in doing him faithful service, by performing all duties of a godly
life? How should this weane our hearts and affections from the love of the
world and earthly vanities, and 1. Joh. 2. 15.
make them to become as bitter as gall and wormwood to our spiritual Iam. 4. 4.
taste, seem they never so sweet and pleasant to our carnal appetite, when as
they are offered as the devils bayts to withdraw our hearts from God, and to
make us more slothful in his service?

. Sect. 3 The third reason, taken from Gods decree of our election.
The fruits also and effects of Gods Love toward us, do serve as strong
arguments to move us unto a godly life. As first, his decree of election,
whereby from all eternity he has chosen us in Christ, out of the corrupt mass
of mankind, unto eternal life and happiness, and unto all the means which
may bring us unto it. What greater mercy can be imagined, then that God of his
free grace should choose us in Christ, who were utterly lost in Adam, dead in
our sins, and the children of wrath as well as others, not unto some mean
estate or low degree of happiness, but to the highest and greatest
privileges, as to be his own peculiar people, and servants of his own
family, yea, to be his adopted children and coheires with Christ, not of some
earthly patrimony, or worldly kingdom, which though it were never so great and
glorious, yet is it mutable and momentary, but of an heavenly 1. Pet. 1. 4, 5.
inheritance, which is incorruptible, undefiled, and fades not away, as the
Apostle speaks? The which benefit will be much amplified, if we consider his
infinite Majesty and Glory, who has thus chosen us; and our own vileness and
unworthiness, whom he has advanced to these rich and wonderful privileges,
seeing we were dust and ashes, corrupt and sinful, strangers, yea enemies
unto God: which if it be well weighed, may justly make us cry out with the
Psalmist; O Lord, what is Psalm. 8. 4.
man, that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of man, that thou visitest
him? Especially, if we consider unto what dignity we who were so low are
exalted; For if it had been a matchless mercy, for us that were so base, to
have been made the meanest of Gods family, even doorekeepers in the House of
our God, what incomparable kindness and love is this, to be made his own
Sons, and Heirs of his Kingdom? The which mercy is not indefinitely
communicated unto all, though all have deserved it as well as we, but to the
least part of mankind; and yet such is his goodness toward us, that passing
by many great Kings and Monarchs, many rich, noble and wise in the world, he
has vouchsafed to make us of this small number. Not because we deserved such
extraordinary favor more then others that want it, but of his mere grace and
free good will. O how should our hearts be inflamed with the Love of God, in
the sight and sense of such an inestimable benefit? How should it fill our
hearts with thankfulness, and our mouths with his praises? How zealous and
diligent should it make us in his service? And to think all time lost, which
is not spent in doing something which may tend to his glory, who of his mere
Love has done so much for us? Out of the same lump, of Romans 9.
which have been made so many vessels to dishonor, he has chosen us, that he
might make us vessels of grace and honor; O how should we delight to be
serviceable to so gracious a Lord, and to shine in the light of godliness to
his glory, who has thus advanced us? He has chosen us, which were children of
wrath, as well as others, out of that huge multitude and cursed crew, to be his
own children by adoption and grace; how then should this inflame our desires,
to glorify so gracious a Father, and to carry our selves in all things as
beseems his children? But if the mere Love of God will not work this in us,
let us consider further, that the Lord has propounded this end to the decree
of our election, that we should glorify him by our Holiness and
vnblameablenesse, according to that of the Apostle; He has chosen us in him
before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy, and Ephesians. 1. 4. 1.
Pet. 2. 9.
without blame before him in love; and therefore unless we think that God,
infinite in wisdom and power, can fail of his end, we can have no hope that
we are elected to happiness, unless we attain unto some measure of
Holiness. He has predestined us, that we should be conformed to the image
of his Son, as in glory and blessedness in the world Act. 14. 22.
to come, so in this life, both in his sanctity and sufferings: and therefore as
we must not think that we can by the broad way of carnal pleasures, attain
to Christ's heavenly happiness, and to be crowned with him before we have
suffered with him; so much less let us imagine 2. Tim. 2. 12.
that we shall ever come into his joys, if we do not follow him in that path
of righteousness, which he has beaten before us, seeing the Apostle has
plainly told us, that without Holiness we shall never see God. Heb. 12. 14.
So that the consideration of our election ought to be a strong motive to
persuade us unto a godly life, both that we may glorify God by our holy
conversation, who has been so gracious and good unto us, and that we may be
assured, that he will glorify us, by attayning unto that end of Holiness, for
which we were elected. Whereof it is that the Apostle having largely entreated
of the doctrine of Gods predestination, does out of this doctrine enforce this
use, that we should offer Romans 12. 1.
up our selves a lively and holy Sacrifice, acceptable unto him, by our
reasonable serving of him. And the Apostle Peter persuading us to make our
election 2. Pet. 1. 10.
sure, could prescribe no other course for the obtaining of this assurance,
then by joining one virtue and grace with another, and bringing forth the
fruits of them all, by doing these things, that is, serving and glorifying God
who has chosen us, in the duties of a godly life.

. Sect. 4 The fourth reason taken from the benefit of our creation.
The second fruit and effect of Gods Love, and cause or means of our salvation
and happiness, is our creation by his Almighty Word; and preservation, being
thus made by his powerful providence. Concerning the former, whereas God might
have left us without a being, which is to be esteemed amongst the greatest
evils, he created us of nothing, or which is all one, of the dust of the earth,
which came of nothing, by sole virtue of his powerful Word; and whereas he
might have made us the vilest and basest of the creatures which creep upon the
earth, yea worse then they, even wicked devils, ordained to condemnation, he
created us according to his own image, in wisdom, holiness and
righteousness, endued us with an immortal and reasonable soul, and made us
Lords over all the rest of the creatures upon the earth, and only inferior to
himself, that we might be ruled and governed by him; and by our service
glorify him who has created us, and given us our being. The which, if it be
rightly considered, is an unspeakable benefit, as being the ground of all that
follow it. Neither could we ever attain unto well-being, unless we had first
a being; nor unto our final end, eternal salvation, unless we had found an
entrance and passage unto it by our creation. In lieu of which great benefit,
God requires nothing at our hands, but that by our service we glorify him,
for which end he gave us our being. Not that his glory needs our service,
seeing it is in it self absolute and infinite, but out of the same love which
moved him first to make us, that he might honor us in this life, by using us
as instruments to manifest his glory, and might hereby take occasion to
glorify us in the world to come, by crowning our service, of his mere grace,
with heavenly joy and happiness. The which also is a most effectual reason to
persuade us, that we deuote and consecrate our selves unto Gods service in all
duties of a godly life, seeing he is our Lord and Maker, who has created us
unto good works, that we should walk in them, to the glory Ephe. 2. 10.
of him that has given us our being, and that to this end, that we should for
ever be partakers with him in glory. For what can be more just, then to give
every one his own? that he who sows his own seed in his own ground,
should reap the fruit of his labors? that he who builds a house, should
have the benefit of dwelling in it? that he who planteth a Vineyard, should
eat of the grapes, and drink of the wine? and that he who lends any thing
unto another, should have his own repaide unto him? And how much more just
then, and equal is it, that the Lord, who has not fashioned and framed us of
pre-existent matter, but of nothing has created our souls and bodies, should
have them wholly devoted and Ephe. 4. 24.
consecrated to his service, which was the end for which he made us and gave us
our being? unto which end if we attain not, it is a sign that we never
think of the end for which we came into the world; or imagine that we were
sent by God hither, that we should serve our own lusts, and in fulfilling
them, the devil himself, and not that we should serve him, who has right
unto us by this great benefit of our creation. Yea if we do not spend our time
in Gods service, we fail of the main end for which we came into the world,
and so spend all our life and strength in vain. But though we fail of our
end, which is, by serving and glorifying God, to attain unto happiness,
(which also is Gods end revealed in his Word yet we shall never frustrate the
end of his secret counsels, which is, either to glorify his mercy in us, if
we fear and serve him, or his Justice, if we neglect his service, and yield
obedience to sin and Satan. For the Lord being the summum bonum, and supreme
end of all things, has (as the Wise man speaks) made Pro. 16. 4.
all things for himself, even the wicked forth day of evil.

. Sect. 5 The fifth reason taken from the benefit of our preservation.
The benefit of our preservation and government, does also justly challenge
this service at our hands; because being created, we have Act. 17. 28. Psalm.
104. 28.
no power to subsist of our selves, but wholly depend upon God for the
continuance of us in our life and good estate; for (as the Apostle says) In
him we live, and move, and have our being; so that if he withdraw his assisting
power, we perish and return unto our dust. By his all-ruling providence we are
every day in the year, every hour in the day, and every minute and moment in
the hour, preserved from innumerable dangers, which otherwise would seize upon
us, from the assaults of our many and mighty enemies, and especially of that
roaring and devouring 1. Pet. 5. 8.
Lion, who is always ready to destroy us, if we were not preserved under the
wings of the Almighty from his rage and malice. By it we are governed and
directed in all our ways, so as we cannot stir a foot, nor move a hand, nor
open our eyes or ears, nor speak a word, if we had not strength from him. By
it all the creatures become serviceable unto us, and work together for our
good, which otherwise would be our bane. From God we have all the benefits
which we enjoy, the Sun which gives us light and vital heat, the air
which we breathe, the earth which sustaineth us, the meat which feeds us,
the apparel which covers our nakedness, and keeps us warm; our health
and wealth, our peace, plenty and prosperity, and all other blessings, fit both
for necessity, and for our comfort and delight. And not only the things
themselves, but all their virtue and vigor, whereby they become profitable to
those ends for which we use them, do come from him, and do as means and
instruments serve his Providence for the deriuing of all good unto us; himself
still remaining the chief and principal cause which works by them, or can
derive unto us all things needful without them, if they be wanting. For it
is he who feeds us by our meat, by our clothes keeps us warm, by our
friends does comfort and relieve us, for which uses they would be ineffectual,
yea produce the clean contrary effects, if they had not from his blessing
their power and efficacy. Now to what end, O man, do thou receive daily at
the hands of God such innumerable blessings, but that thou should
acknowledge him the Author of them, and praise him for all the good which he
does unto thee? Why does he preserve thy life, but that thou should live to
his glory? Why does he make all his creatures in heaven and earth serviceable
unto thee; but that thou should hereby be moved with more cheerfulness to
serve him, who has created both them and thee? Why does he preserve thee from
dangers, and protect thee from enemies, and deliver thee out of troubles and
afflictions, but that thou should glorify and serve him without fear, in
Psalm. 50. 15 Luke 1. 74, 75.
holiness and righteousness all the days of thy life? Why does he give the
light of the Sun, but that thou should shun the works of darkness, and
serve him in the duties of thy calling? Why does he let thee breathe the air,
but that thou should spend this breath in speaking and singing to his praise?
Finally, why does he feed and clothe thee, and give unto thee those manifold
blessings which thou inioyest, but that by this rich wages, he may encourage
thee to do him faithful and cheerful service? which if thou neglectest, and
mis-spendest all the rich gifts which thou have received, to the dishonor of
him that gives them, in the service of sin and Satan, and in satisfying of
thine own carnal and sensual lusts, what do thou hereby, but bewray thine
horrible ingratitude toward such a gracious and bountiful Lord and Master?
What do thou but alienate his love from thee, and provoking his wrath against
thee, move him in his just displeasure to withdraw his gifts from thee which
thou abusest, or let thee enjoy them in his anger to thy greater hurt, leaving
them with thee as testimonies to convince thee of thy shameful ingratitude,
and as talents lent unto thee, which when thou have misspent to the dishonor
of thy Lord, or not employed them in his service, will but prepare for thee a
fearful account at the terrible Day of Gods last Judgment.

CAP. XXXVII.
Two other reasons moving us unto a godly life. The first, taken from Christ,
given unto us by his Father; the other, from the Covenant of grace made in him.

. Sect. 1 Of the inestimable gift of Jesus Christ, which should move us to love
and serve God.
THe fourth main benefit which God has given unto us, is his only begotten
and dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ, to be our Head and Savior, in whom we
were elected, and by whom we were to be saved and redeemed. For being fallen in
Adam, who was the head and root of all mankind, and not only partakers of
the guilt and punishment of his sin, but also of the corruption of nature
derived from him, whereby we were disabled to all good, and made prone unto all
evil, it would not stand with Gods Justice to elect or save us, till it were
fully satisfied, and we freed from this sinful condition. Which being a work
impossible to men and Angels, in respect of that infinite price which was to
be paid, God, of his free grace and love ordained and appointed in his
eternal Counsel, his Son to be our Savior and Redeemer; and to this end,
to take our nature upon him, that he might be unto his elect the second Adam,
and the Head of his Church, in whom he chose them to life and salvation, which
the first Adam lost both for himself and all his posterity. For howsoever the
free love, and mere grace and good will of God, be the supreme and highest
cause of our election and salvation, and Christ, in respect of it, but a means
or subordinate cause of working that for us, which Gods love had first decreed
(neither was Christ the cause that moved God to love us John 3. 16.
with this first love and free grace, but this love, the cause which moved God
to give his Son unto us to be our Savior and Redeemer) yet may it be truly
said, that we could no otherwise be elected then in Christ, as our Head and
the root of all our righteousness, that justice and mercy meeting together,
God might be glorified in them both; although we be not elected for him, but of
Gods absolute will and free grace, which moved him to give us his Son and all
other good which we receive by him. And this the Apostle plainly affirms,
that God has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, and that he
has predestined us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, Ephe. 1. 4,
5.
unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will; to the praise of
the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in his Beloved, who
were worthily rejected in Adam, both for the guilt of his sin, and the
corruption of our nature which we have derived from him. Now this benefit of
Christ given us of God, to be the foundation of our election and salvation,
may be unto us a most forcible argument to make us love God above all things,
who has so loved us, that he has not spared to give his only begotten and
dearly beloved Son unto us, and for us, even unto the death, that we by him
might attain unto eternal life and happiness, and also to express this
love, by laboring and indeuouring to serve and please him in all the duties of
a godly life. For what should withdraw our hearts from God, which he has tied
unto him by such a bond of love, that was much stronger then death it self?
why should any hire entice us to neglect his service, and to serve Satan, the
world, and our own lusts, by committing any known sin, unless it be of
equal value to that gift that God has given to us and for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and appropriate us unto himself for his own
service? But ten thousand worlds cannot match this gift, and why then should we
lose the benefit of it, by neglecting the service of God, and hiring our selves
to work wickedness, for the base hire of worldly vanities?

. Sect. 2 That the work of redemption should move us to serve our Redeemer in
all duties of a godly life.
Again, as Christ our Savior given unto us by God his Father; so also the
great work of Redemption wrought by him, may serve as a most powerful
argument to move us unto the diligent performance of all the duties which
belong to a godly life: For though the work of our Creation and preservation
are inestimable benefits, yet, this much exceeds them, being far above all
humane conceit, and so unspeakable, that it can never be sufficiently
expressed and magnified by the tongue of men and Angels. Yet let us take, as we
are able, some slender view of it; and with rauishing wonder, admire and adore
the rest which we are not able to comprehend. And consider first, what we were
who were thus redeemed, Romans 5. 8, 10.
to wit, mortal men, dust and ashes, weak, and of no strength, strangers,
sinners, yea, enemies unto God and our own salvation. Secondly, from what we
were redeemed, namely, out of the greatest and most desperate misery which
could possibly be incident unto any creature. For Christ has delivered us
from the wrath of God, the curse of the Law, and all the fearful plagues
therein threatened, temporal and eternal, from the miserable bondage and
captivity of sin and Satan, from death, hell, and everlasting condemnation
both of body and soul; and that when we were so desperately and unrecoverably
plunged into these fearful miseries, that we were utterly unable to help
our selves, yea, when all the power of men and Angels was altogether
insufficient to do us any good. Thirdly, consider who redeemed such poor
sinful wretches out of this woeful plight, even the glorious Son of God,
equal to his Father in power and Majesty; he vouchsafed to pity us in our
misery, and to take upon him our deliverance. Fourthly, consider the means
which he used to effect this great work of our Redemption, namely, by humbling
himself, in taking upon him our nature, and uniting it in a substantial and
inseparable union unto his Divine nature, that so he might in our stead, do
and suffer whatsoever was necessary for our salvation. Fifthly, consider the
manner of effecting this great work, or the means which he used, that he
might redeem us; namely, by offering himself unto God his Father, as a
sacrifice for our sins, and an all-sufficient price for our Redemption, and
to suffer in his body and soul, all those punishments which were due unto us
for our sins. As all the miseries of his life, poverty and mean birth,
flight from his enemies, the tentations of the devil, hunger, weariness, the
persecutions, scorns, reproaches, and slanders of the world and wicked men. And
those especially, which he endured a little before his death; for he was
betrayed by his own Apostle, and forsaken by the rest, apprehended by his
enemies, and by them most injuriously and barbarously abused, and haled from
one Judgment seat to another, falsely accused, wrongfully condemned,
blindfolded, buffeted, rayled at, spit upon, scorned and mocked, whipped,
crowned with thorns, and crucified; and so suffered for us that cruel,
ignominious, and accursed death of the Cross, and his Fathers wrath due to our
sins, which made him to sweat drops of Blood, and under the weight of this
intolerable burden, to complain, as a man forlorn and forsaken of God. All
which, he willingly, meekely, and patiently suffered for us, that he might
redeem us out of the hands of all our enemies, and purchase us unto himself
Psalm. 100. 2.
as his own peculiar people. So that we are now his by a treble right: for he
has made us, and therefore we are his, even his home-borne servants, who owe
unto him our birth and being; he preserves us, and gives unto us all the
good things which we enjoy, and so we are his hired servants, who owe unto him
all love and duty, for the rich wages of his bounteous benefits; and finally,
he has redeemed us out of the hands of our mortal enemies, by giving for us,
not silver or gold, or any corruptible 1. Pet. 1. 17, 18.
thing, but himself and his own precious Blood, as a price to satisfy his
Fathers justice for our sins; and therefore we are no more our own, but 1.
Cor. 6. 20.
his by the Law of Redemption. What then remains, but that we yield unto our
Savior his own right which he has so dearly bought? and seeing he has
given a price for us, which is of ten thousand, yea, infinite times more value
then his purchase; O let us not defraud him of his bargain, but deuote our
bodies and souls wholly to him, that we may glorify him by our service, and
be sorry that we have no more to give unto him. We owed our selves unto him
before, by right of creation, but by our sins robbed him of his due, by
selling our selves over to Satan, as his slaves, for the base hire of worldly
vanities; and now he has again made us his own, by giving himself as the
price of our Redemption: and therefore let us not again deprive him of his
right, and defraud him of his service, which if we ungratefully do, there
remains no further sacrifice Heb. 10. 26.
for sin. He has given himself for us; and shall we think it too much to
give our selves to him? He came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give
Mat. 20. 28.
his life a ransom for many; and shall the servant detract his service, when
his Lord and Master, his King and Sovereign has abased himself to do
service for him? He has made no spare of his Blood for our sakes, and shall
we think our selves prodigal in our duty, if we take a little pains, and
spend some sweat in his service? Yea, rather let us think no time well spent,
which is not thus employed; and all our labor lost, which by holy duty
expresses not some love toward him, to whom we owe so much, and are able to
pay so little. Excellent is the meditation of a devout Father to this purpose;
If (says he) I owe my self wholly unto him, for Quod si totum me debeo pro me
facto, quid addam iam and pro refecto, and refecto hoc modo, etc? Bern. lib de
diligen. Deo. c. 1.
my Creation; what shall I now add for my restoration and Redemption?
especially being restored after this manner? Neither was I so easily restored
as created. For to create me and all things else, God did but say the word, and
it was done; but he that by once speaking made me, said many things, wrought
wonders, suffered things not only grievous, but disgraceful and unworthy of
him, that he might redeem me. What therefore shall I return unto the Lord,
for all the good things which he has done unto me? In his first work he gave
me unto my self; in the second, he gave himself to me; and by giving
himself, restored me unto my self. Being then both given and restored, I owe
my self unto him for my self, and so am twice due. But what then shall I give
unto God for giving himself? for though I could give my self a thousand times
for recompense, what am I in comparison of him? Besides which argument of
thankfulness, which might move us to perform all duties of Gods service, there
is another of necessity, which like a strong chain tieth us unto them: Seeing
our Savior Christ has propounded this as the maine end of our Redemption,
yea, has also ratified it by his solemn Oath, that all those who are by him
Luke 1. 74, 75. Romans 14. 9. Mat. 7. 22. Mal. 1. 6.
redeemed out of the hands of their spiritual enemies, shall serve him in
holiness and righteousness, before him, all the days of their lives. He
therefore died, that he might be Lord of all, not in bare title and profession
only (for that will nothing profit us at the day of Judgment, as himself
tells us) but in deed and truth, by performing unto him faithful and
diligent service. He has bought us, 1. Cor. 6. 20. Col. 1. 22. 1. Pet. 2. 24.
Esa. 44. 22. 1. Pet. 1. 17, 18.
that we should no more be our own, (and much less the devils or the worlds)
but his, and glorify him both in our souls and bodies, seeing they are his,
as the Apostle tells us. And therefore unless we think that Christ may
fail of his end which he has propounded, and so die in vain, yea, if he may
not fail of his truth, and falsify his Oath, let us not imagine that we are
his redeemed, or have any part in that great work of salvation wrought by him,
unless we labor and endeavor to serve him in the duties of holiness and
righteousness, and that not by fits and flashes only, but, from the time of
our conversion, all the remainder of our lives.

. Sect. 3 That by the Covenant of Grace we are strongly bound unto all
Christian duties of a godly life.
The fifth benefit, is the Covenant of Grace, which God has made with us in
Jesus Christ; for being redeemed by his full satisfaction, death, and
obedience, the Lord has made a new Covenant with us, not like that under the
Law, the condition whereof, was perfect obedience, the which being impossible
unto us, by reason of our imperfections and corruptions, the promise was made
void and unprofitable; seeing this new Covenant is not grounded upon our works
and worthiness, but upon the free mercies of God, and the all-sufficient
merits of Jesus Christ. In which, the Lord promises for his part, that he will
be our gracious God and loving Father, that he will pardon and forgive us all
our sins, and give unto us all good things spiritual and temporal in this
life, and glory and happiness in the life to come. And we for our part promise
unto God again, that he shall be our God, and we his people, and that we will
receive and embrace all his blessings promised, by a true and lively faith, and
especially, Jesus Christ and all his benefits, and wholly rest upon him, for
our justification and salvation, that he may be all in all, and have the whole
glory of his own gracious and free gifts. And because a dead and fruitless
faith cannot do this, therefore by a necessary consequence we promise, that
we will approve our faith to be lively and effectual for these uses, by
bringing forth the fruits thereof in unfeigned and hearty repentance and
amendment of life. Now whereas we covenant that he shall be our God, and we
will be his people, we do not promise that we will make a bare profession of
these things in word only, but that in deed and truth we will have him to be
our God, in our hearts by desiring and indeuouring to cleave unto him alone,
loving, fearing, hoping, and trusting in him and no other, and that in our
lives and actions we will labor to glorify him, by living as it becomes his
people, and bringing forth the fruits of holiness and righteousness, in the
whole course of our conversation. The which Covenant strongly binds us to
these duties; seeing as it is on Gods part most unchangeable, being effectually
ratified and confirmed by the blood of Christ, by Gods own handwriting in his
Word and Gospel, whereunto he has annexed his seals and Sacraments; yea, by
his solemn Oath, wherein it is impossible that God should lie; for having Heb.
6. 18.
no greater to swear by, he has sworn by himself, that he will not fail
of any of his promises made in Christ: so is it confirmed on our part by our
solemn Vow in Baptism, where (as it were) by a sacramental oath we have
bound our selves to renounce the service of sin and Satan, the world and the
flesh, and that we will serve God and no other, in the duties of holiness and
righteousness all the days of our lives. To which end we make a solemn
profession of our faith, and take upon us Gods Livery and Cognizance,
promising, that we will fight under his Colors and Standard, against all the
enemies of our salvation. And therefore seeing we have made this vow and
promise unto God, and have, upon many occasions, renewed our covenant, that we
will in all things serve and please him; we must, in the whole course of our
lives, carefully endeavor to perform what we have promised, unless we would
be esteemed couenantbreakers, falsifiers of our word and promise, not to men,
but to God himself, yea perfidious traitors to him and our own souls. The
which will be much more intolerable and inexcusable, seeing in this Covenant of
Grace, God does not stand upon strict terms with us, exacting legal and
perfect performance, but only Evangelical sincerity and truth, and that we
desire and endeavor to keep our promise as much as we are able. And seeing
also, because our strength is but small, the Lord has graciously promised the
assistance of his holy Spirit, to strengthen us in our good endeavors, and
enable us to perform what he requires, and we have undertaken, in some such
manner as may be acceptable in his sight. Now what stronger motive can there be
unto the duties of a godly life, consisting in a lively faith and unfeigned
repentance, then to consider that we are tied hereunto by this covenant, which
is the maine ground of all our good, the remission of our sins, grace and
glory, which if we make void, by our impenitency and infidelity, we can have
no part in Gods mercies and gracious promises, nor in Jesus Christ and all his
benefits? Especially considering, that if we but resolve and endeavor to please
God in these holy duties, both we and our service shall be accepted in Jesus
Christ, our imperfections being covered with his perfect obedience, and our
corruptions washed away with his blood: which if we neglect to perform, and
live still in our infidelity and impenitency, without any serious desire or
constant endeavor to know God, or to fear and serve him, whatsoever profession
and show we make to the contrary, yet most certain it is, that we are not yet
in this Covenant, nor shall, as long as we continue in this state, have any
part in the benefits promised; seeing the Lord, who cannot fail of his word,
has in this covenant assured us, that he will not Ier. 31 33, 34, 35. and 32.
40.
only bestow his blessings, but will also fit and enable all his Elect, with
whom only he makes it, to perform what he require that their hands, that he
will inlighten them with the knowledge of himself and his will, and write his
Law in their hearts, thereby working in them these resolutions and endeavors to
observe and keep it; that he will be their God, and they his people; and that
he will knit them so unto him, as that they shall never depart from him; and
therefore so long as we find no such things wrought in us, we can have no
assurance, that as yet we have any part in this Covenant, or in any of the
benefits therein promised.

CAP. XXXVIII.
Of two other reasons moving us to a godly life: the one, taken from our
effectual Calling; the other, from our free Justification by faith.

. Sect. 1 That the benefit of our effectual Calling should move us to serve
God in the duties of a godly life.
THe sixth benefit, is our effectual Calling, whereby the Lord vouchsafes, by
the preaching of the Gospel, to make known unto us his good will and
pleasure, concerning the eternal salvation of our souls, in and for Jesus
Christ, and by the inward operation of his holy Spirit, working with the
outward ministry, to beget in us a true and lively faith, whereby we apply
unto our selves Christ Jesus and all his benefits. For in the ministry of the
Word, God not only offers unto us Christ to be our Savior and Redeemer, but
also prepares and fitteth us to receive him, giving unto us a true sight of
our sin and misery, by which our hearts are humbled and broken, and working
in them an earnest hungring and thirsting after Christ and his righteousness,
that by him we may be recovered out of our wretched estate, and attain unto
life and salvation by his merits and obedience. The which fervent desires he
graciously satisfies, by working faith in us, grounded upon his infinite
mercies, the all-sufficient merits of Christ, and his free and indefinite
promises, whereby we apply him unto us with all his benefits. So that in this
benefit of our effectual Calling, three things chiefly concur: first, the
saving hearing of the Word, whereby our ears and hearts are opened, and our
minds enlightened with the knowledge of the great work of Redemption wrought
by Christ. Secondly, the donation of God the Father, whereby he offers and
gives Christ unto us, to be our Savior, and us unto Christ, to be saved and
redeemed by him. Thirdly, incision into Christ, and union with him, he
becoming our Head, and we his members, the bond whereof, on his part, is his
holy Spirit, and on our part, a true and lively faith. All which afford unto
us strong motives to persuade us unto all duties of a godly life. For first,
what an incomparable benefit is this, that the Lord passing by innumerable
others, who either never heard the sound of the Gospel, or hearing, have made
no benefit by it, wanting the inward assistance of his holy Spirit, he should
both grant unto us this light, and also open our eyes that we should behold it?
and that he should hereby choose and call us out of the corrupt mass of
mankind, which still lies dead in sin, and make us true members of his
Church, giving Christ unto us, and us unto Christ, and uniting us unto him, as
lively members of his body, that we might be partakers of him and all his
benefits? And how should this affect our hearts, and provoke us to make a right
use of such inestimable blessings, which is the end why God has bestowed them?
For why has he enlightened our eyes more then others, but that by the benefit
of this light, we should walk in the ways of holiness Job. 12. 35.
and righteousness, and so glorify him in our salvation? Wherefore has he
called and culled us out of the world, but that we should walk worthy of this
high calling, and renouncing the world and worldly lusts, deuote our selves
wholly to his service? Why has he given Christ unto us, and us unto Christ,
but that he might save us from our sins, not only in respect of their guilt
and punishment, but also from their corruption, and that he reigning in us by
his grace and holy Spirit, might depose sin and Satan from their regency, and
suffer them no longer to rule and reign in our mortal bodies? Why has he
united us unto Christ by his Spirit, but that we should be led and ruled by
it, and not by our own lusts, and that we should submit our selves as
becomes members, to his government, seeing it were a thing monstrous in the
body, for any inferior part, to rebel against the Head, and to withdraw it it
self from its regiment and jurisdiction; and utterly unsuitable, that so holy
an Head should have any members delighting in wickedness, and drawing it, as
much as they are able, into the fellowship and communion 1. Cor. 6. 15.
of the same sins? And that this is the maine end of our calling, that we
should glorify God by serving him in holiness and righteousness, it is
clear and evident by the Scriptures. For the Apostle tells us, that God has
not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness, that the grace of 1. These.
4. 7. Tit. 2. 11, 12.
God which brings salvation, appearing or shining unto us, in the ministry
of the Gospel, teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world: which lesson if we
learn not, we had been better to have sat still in darkness, seeing our
knowledge will but aggrauate our sin, and increase our condemnation,
according to that of the Apostle, To him that knows to do good, and does it
not, to him it is sin; and that of our Savior, The servant that knows his
Ioh. 9. 31. Jam. 4. 17. Luke 12. 47.
Masters will, and does it not, shall be beaten with many stripes. Finally, our
Savior tells us, that if we be grafted in him, we must bring forth fruit;
seeing every branch that bears not fruit, he takes away, and casts forth
as a branch that is dead and withered, and men gather them and cast them into
the Ioh. 15. 2, 6.
fire, and they are burned. And therefore if we would have any assurance that
we are effectually called, that Christ is ours, and we his, and that being
united unto him, as lively members of his body, we have right unto him, and all
his benefits, let us, as the Apostle exhorts, walk worthy the vocation
Ephesians. 4. 1. 2. Pet. 1. 10.
wherewith we are called; and as the Apostle Peter persuades, Let us make our
Calling and Election sure, by adding one virtue unto another, and bringing
forth the fruits of them all in a godly and Christian life.

. Sect. 2 The second reason taken from our Justification, and the fruits which
follow it.
Finally, the benefit of our Justification, with all the fruits that do follow
it, are so many strong motives to incite us unto the duties of a godly life:
for God, in our Justification, of his free grace, imputing unto us the death
and obedience of Jesus Christ, has forgiven us all our sins, and pronounced
us just and righteous, in his righteousness. By which inestimable benefit, he
has bound us to serve and glorify him in all holy duties, who has done so
great things for us. For seeing there is no evil, like the evil of sin, no
tyranny and bondage alike miserable, therefore when God of his free grace has
freed us from it, we must with all care flee sin, and take heed, that we
do not again come into this thraldom. And seeing he has forgiven us so
great a debt, let this make us Luke 7. 47.
love him much, and express our love, by serving and pleasing him in the
duties of holiness and righteousness. The which use the Apostle makes of
this benefit, namely, that being dead unto sin, that is, freed from Romans 6.
10, 12, 18.
the power and tyranny of it, and alive unto God, we should not let sin any
longer reign in our mortal bodies, that we should obey it in the lusts
thereof, but that we should yield our selves unto God, as those that are alive
from the dead, and our members as instruments of righteousness unto God; and
that being made free from sin, we should become the servants of
righteousness. Which if we do not, we can have no assurance that we are
redeemed by Christ and justified; seeing the same virtue and power of Christ's
death and Resurrection, which takes away the guilt and punishment of our
sins in Ephesians. 5. 25, 26. 1. Pet. 2. 24.
our Justification, is as effectual to sanctify us in the killing and
crucifying of our corruptions, and our spiritual quickening to holiness and
newness of life in our sanctification, and as well did there issue out of his
pierced side the water of ablution, to cleanse us from the pollution of sin,
as the blood of Redemption to free us from the guilt and punishment. The fruits
also which follow our Justification, do effectually persuade us to serve God
in all the duties of a godly life. For seeing we are reconciled unto God by
the death of Christ, our care must be to walk in such a course as may
preserve us in his love: for Christ has, as the Apostle speaks, reconciled
us in the body of his flesh through death, to present Col. 1. 21, 22.
us, holy, unblameable, and unreprovable in his sight. We have received the
Spirit of Adoption crying in our hearts, Abba Father, that it may be also Romans
8. 15.
in us the Spirit of Sanctification, and enable us to please God in all things,
as it beseems his children. And in whomsoever this Spirit is, them it
regenerateth, raising them from the death of sin, to the life of
righteousness. Ephesians. 3. 12.
So our free access to the Throne of grace, should make us take heed of sin,
which will be as a wall of separation between God and us, and to live in such
holiness of life, as may still preserve our confidence in making our suits
known unto God. The love of God shed abroad in Romans 5. 5.
our hearts by the holy Ghost, will inflame them with love toward him, and
make us careful to approve it, by living according to his will. The peace of
God following our Justification by faith, and passing all understanding, Romans
5. 1.
must make us diligent in shunning those things which might disturb it, and
embracing and practicing such virtues and holy duties as will preserve it. Our
spiritual joy and rejoicing in God, will make us avoid all known sins which
would interrupt our joy, and turn it into Romans 5. 3.
sorrow, and to please the Lord in all things, that his face and favor may
make us still glad. Our hope of heavenly happiness will also much encourage us
in the work of our sanctification: for as many as have this 1. Ioh. 3. 2, 3.
hope, that they shall be like Christ in glory, purge themselves, as he also is
pure, as the Apostle teaches us. In a word, there is no benefit accompanying
grace and salvation, which may not serve as an effectual reason to move us to
the practice of all holy duties, both out of thankfulness toward God for
such inestimable gifts, and for the better assuring our selves, that we have
received them, seeing God having given them all unto us for this end, we have
no reason to persuade our selves, that we have any interest in them, unless
they further us to it, and stir us up in some measure to glorify God in all
the duties of an holy life. And therefore if we have any love toward God,
wrought in us by so many rich mercies, or any true love toward our selves,
which is chiefly showed in seeking the assurance of such inestimable benefits;
let us above all things labor and endeavor to serve and pleased God, by
bringing forth the fruits of holiness and righteousness, in the whole course
of our lives and conuersations.

CAP. XXXIX.
Other motives arising from those duties which we owe unto God and our
neighbors.

. Sect. 1 The first reason, taken from that thankfulness which we owe unto
God.
ANd these are the reasons and arguments, respecting Gods works and benefits
toward us, which may persuade us to perform all the duties of a godly life
with diligence and cheerfulness. Besides which, there are diverse other
motives, arising from those duties which we owe unto God, in lieu of so many
great and inestimable benefits, that are also effectual to the same purpose.
As first, our unfeigned thankfulness toward God, which we are bound to
testify and approve, by performing service unto him in the duties of holiness
and righteousness. For we Romans 8. 12.
are not debtors unto the flesh, that we should live according to the lusts
thereof; but so infinitely indebted unto God for his innumerable mercies, that
we are never able in the least part to discharge it, and are therefore bound
ever to remain thankful debtors, and to testify our thankfulness by
magnifying his grace and holy Name, and by striving and indeuouring, as much as
we are able, to do his will, and perform all such duties as are acceptable in
his sight, acknowledging when we have done the best we can, that we are still
unprofitable servants, who Luke 17. 10.
come far short of that duty which we owe unto him. His grace shining unto
us when we were in darkness and shadow of death, requires at our hands that
we should no more do the works of darkness, but that we should now walk
as it becomes children of the Ephesians. 5. 8, 10, 15, 16.
light, proouing what is acceptable unto the Lord, and by more then ordinary
diligence and circumspection, redeeming our lost time, which we have misspent
in the service of sin and Satan. The great work of Redemption also wrought
by Christ, whereby he has saved and delivered us out of that miserable bondage
of sin and Satan, and purchased us unto himself, as his own peculiar
people, should make us zealous Tit. 2. 14.
of good works, and in thankfulness for so great a benefit, most careful to
serve our Lord and Redeemer, in holiness and righteousness all the days of
our lives; and seeing he has reconciled us unto God his Father, by paying for
our ransom, not silver or gold, or any corruptible, Luke 1. 74, 75.
thing, but that precious price of himself, and his blood shed for our 1. Pet.
1. 18. Col. 1. 21, 22.
sins, that so he might present us holy, unblameable and unreprovable in his
sight; let not us ungratefully frustrate his end, by defyling our selves with
sin, but let us offer our bodies and souls a living sacrifice, holy and
acceptable Romans 12. 1.
unto God, which is our reasonable service, as the Apostle exhorts. He has
incorporated us into his own body, and so made us partakers of himself and
all his benefits, the sons of God by adoption and grace, and coheires with
him in glory and happiness, and therefore let us bring forth fruits worthy so
holy and happy a communion, and in all things submit our selves to be ruled
and governed by so gracious and good an Head. The Holy Ghost also has applied
unto us by his virtue and efficacy Christ's merits and obedience; and though
heaven, and the heavens of heavens are not sufficient to contain him, 1. King.
8. 27.
nor the infiniteness of his Glory and Majesty; yet he is content to dwell
with us, yea in us, yea in us, as in his Temples: and therefore let us not
profane 1. Cor. 6. 19.
that which he has sanctified with his presence, and so vex and grieve this
Holy Spirit, but labor to preseure our bodies and souls in purity and honor,
that being fit for his habitation, he may dwell in us with pleasure and delight.

. Sect. 2 The 2. reason taken from that desire which should be in us to
glorify God.
Secondly, Gods manifold and rich mercies should move us in thankfulness to
glorify him, who has been so good and gracious Luke 1. 74. 1. Cor. 6. 20.
unto us, which is the maine end why the Lord has bestowed all his blessings
and benefits upon us. For therefore he has created us, that we should glorify
him by our service; and for this end he has redeemed us, that we should
worship and serve him in holiness and righteousness, and that being no longer
our own, but his, we should (as the Apostle exhorts us) glorify him in our
souls and bodies. Therefore has he called us to be a chosen generation, a
Royal Priesthood, an holy 1. Pet. 1. 9.
nation, a peculiar people, that we should show forth the praises of him, who
has called us out of darkness into his maruailous light. And this is the end
why the Apostle prays so earnestly for the Thessalonians, that he would count
them worthy of their calling, and fulfill in them all the 2. These. 1. 11, 12
good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of Faith and power; to wit, that
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ might be glorified in them, and they in him.
Now we thus glorify God, not by adding any thing to his glory, but as we are
instruments of manifesting it; or give occasion unto others of glorifying him.
And thus we glorify him in our regeneration and New birth, when as his
infinite wisdom, power and goodness do more wonderfully shine to his glory,
in that maruailous change of our nature from death to life, from sinful
uncleanness, to purity and holiness; and of our state from the deepest
misery, to the highest happiness, then in our first creation. Thus also we
glorify him by our fruits of new obedience, according to that of our Savior,
Hereby is Joh. 15. 8.
your heavenly Father glorified, if you bring much fruit. Seeing we make it
manifest unto the world, that the God whom we serve, is himself holy, pure,
and just, seeing he is so much delighted in the purity, holiness and
righteousness of his servants, and cannot endure sin and Leuit. 10. 2.
wickedness in those that draw near unto him. And this argument our Savior
uses to persuade us unto an holy conversation; Let your Matthew. 5. 16.
light (says he) so shine before men, that seeing your good works, they may
glorify your Father which is in heaven. And the Apostle Peter uses the same
reason: Have your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas 1. Pet.
2. 12.
they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works which
they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. Finally, we glorify
him by our godly lives, when as by our outward service, we approve and
testify, that inwardly we love, fear, reverence, and depend upon him, as
being omniscient, who takes notice of our works, omnipotent and all-sufficient
to reward our well-doing, and of infallible truth in all his promises, made unto
all those that fear and serve him. Now what stronger motive can there be to
persuade us unto all the duties of a godly life, then to consider, that God,
infinite in Glory and Majesty, does vouchsafe unto us this honor to make us,
who are so base and contemptible, instruments of his glory, and that not
because he needs our help, but that he may take occasion hereby to glorify
1. Sam. 2. 30.
us, and to crown our works with glory and happiness?

. Sect. 3 The third reason taken from the will of God, that we should thus
serve him.
Finally, it may be an effectual reason to move us, to embrace holiness, and
to bring forth the fruits of it in a godly life, because it is 1. These. 4. 3.
2 Pet. 3. 9. Matthew. 26. 39.
the will of God, that we should so do, according to that of the Apostle, This
is the will of God, even your sanctification. For the will of God is the
perfect rule of all Justice and goodness, according to which we must frame all
our actions, which that we may fulfill, we must utterly renounce our selves and
our own pleasure, saying with our Savior, Not my will, but thine be done: and
with him esteeming it our meat and drink, to do the will of our heavenly
Father. And this is that we daily ask in the Lords Prayer, that the will of God
may be done in earth as it is heaven; that is, Ioh. 4. 34.
that we may obey it with that speed and diligence, cheerfulness and delight,
as the holy Angels. And therefore unless we pray in hypocrisy, we must
labor and endeavor, that we may in our practice attain unto that, which we
crave at Gods hands in our daily prayers. Now that it is the will of God, that
we should serve him in keeping his Law, and performing all the holy duties of a
godly life required in it, it is clear and evident by his Word, wherein he
has revealed his will, and by innumerable precepts and exhortations, by which
we are pressed and persuaded to sanctification and new obedience. So the
Apostle exhorts us as Gods Ambassador, to Ephesians. 4. 23, 24. and 5. 14, 15.
be renewed in the spirit of our minds, and to put on the new man which after
God is created in righteousness and true holiness. And again; 2. Cor. 5. 17.
If any man be in Christ, let him be a new creature. Romans 12. 2. and 13. 14.
And be not conformed to the world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of
your minds, that ye may prove what is that good, acceptable and perfect will
of God. 1. Cor. 15. 34. Col. ^1, 3.
Awake to righteousness and sin not; 2. Tim. 2. 22. Heb. 12. 1.
Fly also youthful lusts; but follow Righteousness, Faith, Charity, Peace,
etc. Thus the Lord exhorts by the Prophet Esaias: Esa. 1. 16, 17. Eccle. 12.
13. Matthew. 22. 37.
Cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed,
etc. And finally, the Wiseman after a long discourse concludes with this, as
the sum of all which either he could teach, or any other, Fear God and keep
his Commandment, for this is the whole duty of man. And therefore seeing the
Lord, who has absolute authority over us, and full right unto us, does in
these and innumerable other places command and exhort us to perform the duties
of holiness and righteousness, and thereby to serve him in the whole course
of our lives, who is our Creator, Preserver, and Redeemer, we must carefully
endeavor to yield our obedience, unless we would rather show our selves
stubbornely rebellious, and enemies both to his glory and our own salvation.
And that we may be encouraged to serve God in all Christian duties with more
diligence and cheerfulness, let us remember that if we do our best endeavor,
we and our service shall be accepted, though it be full of imperfections and
stained with many corruptions. For he does not deal with Mal. 3. 17. 2. Cor.
8. 12.
us as a severe Judge according to the rigor of the Law, but like a gracious
Father, he passes by our infirmities, and accepts the will for the work.
And though nothing as it is stained and imperfect, can be pleasing unto God,
whose exact Justice and pure eye can endure no blemish; yet the duties which we
perform unto him, respectively do please him, and move him also to delight in
us. For they please him not as they are tainted with the corruption of our
will, but as by them we do his will, who has commanded us to do them. Not as
they are done by us who are defiled with sin, for how can any thing Joh. 14.
4. Math. 3. 17. and 17. 5.
clean, come out of us that are unclean? But as they are done in Christ, in
whom he is well pleased, and fruits of this Vine which we bear, being
ingrafted in him by a true and lively faith. Not as they are imperfect and
stained, but as their imperfections are covered with Christ's perfect
righteousness, and their corruption washed away by his blood. Not as they are
done by us, but as they are the fruits and effects of his own holy Spirit,
working in, and by us. They do not please him in their own worth, but because
our persons are accepted and please him, being justified by faith in Jesus
Christ, reconciled unto him, and children by adoption and grace, whose poor
endeavors are accepted of our gracious Father for perfect obedience; and the
rather, because howsoever we fail through weakness and infirmity, yet the
main end which we propound in them unto our selves is, that we may, by
performing our duty, glorify our heavenly Father; and because, though our
works be imperfect, yet they are done with perfect hearts, that is, in
uprightness and sincerity, which makes us do the best we can, and to bewail
our imperfections, because we can do no better. Finally, they please God, not
that he has any pleasure in unrighteousness or imperfect righteousness, but
because we doing them out of love and filial obedience, he also loves us, and
so is well pleased with our works of piety and righteousness, because they tend
to our good, to whom in his love he wishes so well, as being the way which will
bring us unto eternal life and happiness.

. Sect. 4 The fourth reason is, that we may adorn the Gospel of God which we
profess.
The last motive respecting our duty toward God, which may persuade us to
serve him by a godly life, is, that hereby we may adorn Deuteronomy. 4. 6, 7, 8.
the Gospel of God, and of Jesus Christ which we profess; and cause it to be
well spoken of by all that see the fruits of it in our unblameable and holy
conversation. And this argument the Lord uses to persuade his people to
observe his Commandments, because hereby they should not only get honor unto
themselves amongst the Nations, but move them likewise to speak well of his
Laws and statutes, when as they should see the fruits of them in their
obedience. And thus the Apostle persuades Christians in diverse callings to
perform their duties in them, that they might not cause the Word of God to be
blasphemed; 1. Tim. 6. 1. Tit. 2. 5.
seeing it is the common custom of worldly and wicked men, to to lay the
faults of Professors upon their profession, and to impute their scandalous
sins, to their much going to Church and hearing of the Word, as though their
profession and hearing were the cause of their wicked and unlawful courses,
whereas in truth, they would (if they abused them not) be as strong cables to
draw them from all impiety and unrighteous dealing. And contrariwise, he would
have them to live in an holy conversation, that they might adorn the doctrine
Tit. 2. 10.
of God our Savior in all things. For men are apt to speak of the Religion
and truth which we profess, either in the better or worser part, according to
the fruits which we bring forth of it in our lives; thinking our Religion to
be pure and good, if we approve our selves to be so, by our holy and
Christian practice and conversation; but contrariwise, if (like those of whom
the Apostle speaks) we have only a form of Godliness, and in our lives
deny the power there of, or profess 2. Tim. 3. 5.
that we know God, but in our works disclaim him, being abominable and Tit.
1. 16.
disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate; we shall open their
mouths, not only against us, but also against all Professors of Gods true
Religion, yea even against the Religion and Doctrine of truth it self which we
profess. For if ever David himself fall into foul sins, it will not only
tend to his own dishonor, but also give occasion to the enemies of the Lord
to blaspheme, as though he were 2. Sam. 12. 14.
a patron or approuer of such crimes.

. Sect. 5 The 1. reason, that we may avoid giving of offense.
And so much of those reasons which respect God. The second sort respect our
neighbors, from whom also we may draw diverse arguments 1. Cor. 10. 32.
to persuade us to an holy conversation. And first, because we shall, being
unblameable, avoid giving unto them any just offense, eitherby laying stumbling
blocks in their way, whereby they should be hindered from the professing of the
true Religion, when as they are able to take exceptions to the lives of
Professors; or if they be religious, be grieved in their righteous souls,
when they see our lives full of blots and blemishes; or make the weak fall by
our ill 2. Pet. 2. 7, 8.
example. The which we must carefully avoid, because our Savior Matthew. 18. 7.
pronounces a fearful woe against those by whom such offenses come; and
contrariwise, labor with the Apostle, to exercise our selves Acts 24. 16.
daily in this, that we may have always a conscience void of offense toward
God and toward men. Secondly, we may be moved to the practice The second
reason.
of al holy duties of a godly life, that we may gain those that are without,
to Christ, and to embrace that true Religion which we profess. For if we have
our conversation honest among the Gentiles, they seeing our good 1. Pet. 2. 12.
works, will glorify God in the day of their visitation. And this argument
the Apostle Peter uses to persuade wives unto their duty, that they which 1.
Pet. 3. 1.
obeyed not the Word, might without the Word be won with their Christian
conversation. The which so much prevailed with the Apostle Paul, that he
utterly denied himself and his own will, and became all things to all men,
that he might gain some to Christ, and was content to please all 1. Cor. 9.
19, 22. and Chap. 10. 33.
men in all things, not seeking his own profit, but the profit of many, that
they might be saved. And how much more then should we with all willingness
walk in such a course of holiness and righteousness, which in gayning
others, will profit our selves, and not only save them by gayning them to
Christ, through our good example, but assure our selves also of our salvation?
Finally, we may be persuaded unto all The third reason.
holy and Christian duties, because they so much tend to the good and profit of
our brethren, who are in the same holy communion with us. First, because by the
light of our godly lives, we shall move them, together with us, to glorify our
heavenly Father, who is the Author Matthew 5. 16.
and Fountain of all good things which they see in us. Secondly, because we
shall edify them by our good example, and move them to imitate those good
things they shall see in us, and by our communion and fellowship with them
(like kindled coals on the same heap) we shall inflame their zeal, and by
an holy emulation make them strive to match us in their Christian duties; as
the Apostle shows in the example of the Corinthians, whose zeal in Christian
beneficence, 2. Cor. 9. 2.
had (as he says) provoked many. And thus he persuades Timothy to be an
example unto believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, 1. Tim. 4. 12.
in spirit, in says, in purity: And exhorts us all to consider one Heb. 10.
24.
another, to provoke unto love and to good works. To which purpose nothing can
be more effectual then good examples, when as we see those duties constantly
performed by our brethren with much comfort and delight, which we feared as
tedious, troublesome and almost impossible, and in this regard durst not
undertake them. Finally, we shall do good to our brethren even in the duties
themselves, both of piety, by teaching, admonishing, exhorting, comforting, and
counselling them that need our help; and also of mercy, by feeding the
hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick, and such like works of
Christian charity, whereby we minister unto their necessities.

CAP. XL.
Of such reasons moving us to the duties of a godly life as respect our selves.

. Sect. 1 The first reason taken from that dignity unto which God has called
us.
IN respect of our selves, there are also many effectual arguments and
reasons, which may move and persuade us unto all duties of a godly life. As
first, that high and heavenly dignity, unto which, God of his free grace and
goodness has called us, out of a most miserable and wretched condition, which
should effectually move us to walk worthy this high and excellent Ephesians. 4. 1.
calling, as the Apostle exhorts us. For we were in darkness and in the
shadow of death, but the Lord has called us into a marvelous light,
revealing clearly unto us the knowledge of himself and his will, the great
mystery of salvation by Jesus Christ, and the means whereby we may be made
partakers of the fruits and benefits of it; in which respect it becomes us to
walk as children of light, circumspectly, not as fools, Ephesians. 5. 8, 15, 16. 1.
Th. 5. 5, 6, 7, 8 Col. 1. 10.
but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. He has called
and separated us from the world, which lies still dead in sin, and has made
us his own peculiar people, who are made partakers of all the privileges of
his Kingdom, to the end that we should no longer fashion our selves to the
world, but that we should walk worthy of God, who has called us unto Romans 12.
2. Tit. 2. 14.
his Kingdom and glory, and serve him as it becomes his subjects, being
zealous of good works; and be no more earthly-minded, but have our Phil. 3.
20. Col. 3. 1, 3.
conversation in heaven, whereof we are Citizens, and mind those things which
are above. He has justified us, and forgiven us all our sins, that being
freed from sin, we should become servants of righteousness. He has made us
a chosen generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people;
Romans 6. 18.
to the end we should behave our selves as becomes those who are thus
dignified, and that we should show forth the praises of him, who has called
us out of darkness into this marvelous light, as the Apostle Peter teaches
1. Pet. 2. 9.
us. He has made us living stones, that we might adorn the spiritual
building of his House and Church; and an holy Priesthood, to offer up 1. Pet 2.
5.
spiritual sacrifices, acceptable unto God by Jesus Christ. Yea, he has made
us Temples of the holy Ghost, which it becomes to be purged from all
pollution of sin, which is odious unto him, and to be decked and adorned with
holiness and righteousness, wherein he is chiefly delighted, whereas
naturally we were like cages of unclean birds, and the loathsome habitations of
sin and Satan. And therefore we must beautify our selves with these
ornaments which so much please him, and keep our selves undefiled from the
filth of sin, which he hates and abhors, lest leaving us unto Satan, as
more fit for his dwelling, we become worse then Baals temple, which was turned
into a common draught house, and receptacle of all pollution. Finally, he has
called us who were the children of wrath, and bond-slaues of sin and Satan,
unto the glorious Romans 5. 15, 16.
liberty of the Sons of God, and has made us his own children by adoption
and grace, and co-heires with Christ in heavenly happiness; 1. Pet. 1. 17.
and therefore we must carry our selves in holiness of conversation, as it
becomes children of such an holy Father. For let us assure our selves, that
the Lord, who has called us to these great and heavenly privileges, will
attain unto his end, and make those fit to receive them, upon whom he
bestows them. Neither will he, who has commanded us not to cast holy things
to dogs, nor pearls before swine, commit Mat. 7. 6.
this error himself, by giving his choice and best gifts unto Dogs and
Swine, who neglect the ways of holiness and righteousness, returning to
their vomit, and to wallow themselves in the mire of 2. Pet. 2. 20, 22.
sin.

. Sect. 2 The second reason is, because hereby we are assured that we shall
prosper in all our ways.
Secondly, if we set our selves to serve God in the duties of holiness and
righteousness, we shall be hereby assured, that we shall prosper in Psalm. 1.
2, 3. Esa. 3. 10.
our ways, and that whatsoever troubles we endure for the time, yet it shall
go well with us in the latter end. For he that delights in the Law of the
Lord, shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters, which brings
forth his fruit in his season, his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever
he does, shall prosper. So the Lord bids the Prophet to say to the
righteous, that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of
their doings; and to denounce a woe to the wicked, for it shall be ill with
him, for the reward of his hands shall be given him. Innumerable places might
be alleged to this purpose out of the Scriptures, and especially the Book of
the Psalms, which set forth the happiness of those in all estates and
conditions, who fear and serve the Lord, seeing he watches over them,
vpholdeth them Psalm. 37. 6, 17, 19, 40. and 34. 9, 10.
when they are ready to fall, preserves them from danger, protecteth them from
all enemies, delivers them out of all their troubles, provides and gives
them all that is good, feeds them in the days of famine, and supplyeth
plentifully whatsoever is wanting either to their souls or bodies. So that if
we put on this breast plate of righteousness, that is, bring forth the fruits
of holiness and righteousness, with an upright heart and good conscience, it
will be armor of proof, to preserve us against the incounters of all evil;
And we shall be secured by it against all dangers, according to that of
Solomon; He that walks uprightly, walks surely: so that though they fall
into many troubles, yet they shall not Psalm. 34. 19.
perish in them, because the Lord delivers them out of all; though their
Psalm. 37. 37. Verse. 35. 36.
beginnings may be turmoyled with many crosses, yet their end is peace, as the
Psalmist speaks. And though the wicked may exceed them in worldly and
momentany prosperity, yet when they are so rooted out, that their place can no
more be found, the righteous, after many storms, shall safely arrive in the
Haven of their hopes. According to that of Solomon, Though a sinner do evil
an hundred times, and his days be prolonged; yet Eccles. 8. 12, 13.
surely I know it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before
him. But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his
days, which are as a shadow, because he fears not before God.

. Sect. 3 The third reason, because without this endeavor all outward exercises
are vain.
The third reason may be this, that without this study and endeavor to serve
the Lord in the duties of a godly life, all outward exercises of Religion are
vain and unprofitable, as the hearing and reading of the Word, the receiving
of the Sacraments, Prayer, Fasting, profession of Religion, and the rest,
seeing they cannot please God, yea, are odious unto him; nor profit us, nor we
take profit by them. Thus the Lord professes, that he abhorred their new
Moons and solemn feasts, their Sacrifices and Oblations, Esa. 1. 11, 12, 13,
14.
because they neglected the works of righteousness, and lived in their
sins. That he who killed an Ox, was as he that slew a man, he that
sacrificed Esa. 66. 3.
a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dogs head, etc. because their lives were not
reformed, but their souls delighted in their abominations. So when the people
rejected Gods Law, and thought to have pleased him with Oblations, and (as it
were) to have stopped his mouth with bribes, the Lord rejects their service
as vain and unprofitable. To what purpose (says he) Ier. 6. 20. and 7. 22, 23.
comes there to me incense from Sheba? and the sweet cane from a far
Country? your offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.
Thus the Lord rejects their solemn feasts, because they were not joined with
Esa. 8. 4, 5.
the works of Justice and mercy. So Solomon tells us, that the sacrifice of
Pro. 15. 8.
the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his
delight. And David says, that if he did regard wickedness in his heart, the
Lord Psalm. 66. 18.
would not hear him. Whereas in other places he tells us, that the
righteous cry, and the Lord hears them, and delivers them out of all their
Psalm. 34. 17, 18.
troubles.

. Sect. 4 The fourth reason, taken from the consideration of our lost time
before our conversion.
The fourth argument may be taken from the consideration of our lost time,
which we have misspent before our conversion, whilst we lived in ignorance,
and in the state of Infidelity, when as we wholly neglected all duties of Gods
service, and the means which might have enriched us with all saving graces,
and furthered the assurance of our salvation; and have spent all our strength
in pursuing of worldly vanities, and in the unfruitful works of darkness,
to the great dishonor of our good God, the wounding of our consciences, and
the burthening and defiling of our souls with the guilt and corruption of
sin. The which should be a powerful reason, after that we are effectually
called, to make us more zealous of Gods service, that we may in the remainder
of our lives, as much glorify him by our holy conversation, as we have before
dishonored him by our sinful lives, and that we may by our extraordinary
endeavor and diligence, attain unto the treasures of his spiritual graces,
whereby we may be enabled to travail in the ways of godliness with so much
the greater speed, by how much we have been more late in setting forth in our
spiritual Journey, and more sluggish and slothful in travailing in this way
which leads us to our heavenly Country. And as those who have misspent
their youth in riotous living, neglected all means of thriuing, and wasted
their states by prodigal courses, when they come to riper age, and see their
folly, being beaten by their own experience, do not only desist from their
former vain and prodigal courses, but are sorry and ashamed of them, and set
themselves with so much the more care and diligence to recover and repair
their decayed estates, and with the greater earnestness use all good means of
thriuing; And as those who being to travail about important business, nearly
concerning them in their life and state, if they have over slept themselves in
the morning, or trifled out their time, about things of no worth; when they see
their error and folly, do make more haste in their way all the day following,
that they may not be benighted, and so coming short of their journey, be
frustrated of their hopes: so must we do in this case, laboring with so much
more earnestness, after the spiritual riches of Gods grace, and the assurance
of our heavenly hopes, by how much the longer we have neglected this
spiritual thrift, and traveling so much more speedily in the ways of
godliness, by how much the longer we have deferred our journey, and have
loytered by the way, fearing (as the Apostle speaks) lest a promise Heb. 4. 1.
being left us of entering into Gods Rest, we should come short of it, for want
of care and diligence. And this argument the Apostle uses, that seeing we
have formerly lived in darkness, and have spent our time in sleep and
sluggishnesse, we should now, when we are awaked, walk circumspectly, not
Ephesians. 5. 8, 14, 15, 16.
as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. And
seeing we have been scandalous in our sinful courses, hindering others from the
profession and practice of godliness by our ill example; therefore as he
exhorts, we must now walk in wisdom toward them that are without, Col. 4.
5.
redeeming the time, by a more earnest endeavor in seeking their conversion, by
our holy communication and graceful speeches, and by shining before them in
the light of Godliness, that we may move them to glorify our heavenly
Father. So, persuading the Romans to sanctification and holiness of life, he
puts them in mind of their former condition, and the little fruit which they
received by it, that it might be as a spur in their sides, to hasten their
speed in the Christian race. For as ye have Romans 6. 19, 21, 22.
(says he) yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity, unto
iniquity (having no other fruit of sinning, but sin) even so now yield your
members servants to righteousness, unto holiness, etc. What fruit had ye then
in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is
death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have
your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. And thus the Apostle
Peter 1. Pet. 4. 2, 3.
exhorts us, that we should no longer live the rest of our time in the flesh,
to the lusts of men, but to the will of God; because the time past of our life
may suffice, to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in
lasciviousness, and in all wicked and sinful lusts.

CAP. XLI.
Other reasons taken from our own profit, and the manifold benefits of a godly
life.

. Sect. 1 That godliness is the chiefest gain.
But among all other arguments which respect our selves, none are more
effectual to prevail with us, then those Psalm. 4. 6. 1. Tim. 6. 6.
which are drawn from our own profit, seeing, as the Psalmist speaks, every
man is ready to inquire, who will show them any good. And therefore if I shall
plainly show that godliness is the greatest gain, and nothing in the world so
profitable and beneficial to all uses and purposes, as the practice of holy
and righteous duties, belonging to a Christian life; I hope it will be
effectual to persuade all, who well weigh and consider the inestimable gain
and profit which they shall assuredly reap unto themselves, that constantly
go on in the ways of godliness, to spend their time and chief strength and
endeavors in that, whereby they may receive so great advantage; and to neglect
the pleasures of sin, and the eager pursuit of worldly vanities, which profit
not, as bringing in comparison, no true good, sound comfort, or solid
contentment for the present; and when they be taken from us, or we from them
(one of which must needs happen, and we know not how soon) leave nothing
behind them, but woe and misery. Do not therefore (I beseech thee Christian
Reader) as thou tendrest the everlasting salvation of thy precious soul, O do
not suffer thine eyes to be blinded and dazeled with the sudden flashes of
worldly vanities, which like lightening pass swiftly away, and leave nothing
behind but black darkness, so as thou can not discern the beauty and
brightness of spiritual graces and heavenly excellencies. Do not content thy
self with a slight and superficial view of these following reasons, which
persuade thee for thine own good, unto the duties of a godly life, nor to have
read them over with a curious eye, rather to see what may be said, then with a
purpose to make use of them for thy practice of holiness, if thou be thoroughly
convinced by evidence of truth shining in them: but ponder them seriously with
thy self, and if thou find them to bear any weight, be persuaded by them to
neglect no longer thine own good, nor to defer and put off the serving of
God in the duties of a godly life, but seek first his Kingdom and
righteousness, when as thou shall plainly discern, Deuteronomy. 6. 24.
that his glory, and thy good, are through his mercy so matched together, that
thou can not seek the one, but thou shall assuredly find the other.

. Sect. 2 That by leading of a godly life, we are assured of freedom from all
our sins, both in respect of their guilt, punishment, and corruption.
Now the good things which accompany the duties of a godly life, are either the
benefits, which as fruits and effects, attend upon it; or those special and
rich privileges, wherewith God of his free mercy is pleased to crown his own
graces, and to reward, as with rich wages, that poor service which we perform
unto him. The benefits which follow a godly life, are either privative,
consisting in our freedom from evil; or positive, in the fruition of good,
and both of them either temporal or eternal. The privative benefits of this
life are many, according to the multitude of evils unto which it is liable,
both in respect of sin and punishment, from which, in the greatest and worst
part, we are by the benefit of a godly life freed and delivered. For first, if
we lead a godly life, it will be a means to assure us of our freedom from
the guilt of all our sins, by sole virtue of Christ's death and bloodshed,
applied unto us by faith, both in regard that these holy duties of a godly life
are the undoubted fruits of a lively faith, approving it to be sincere and
unfeigned; and as fruits of our Sanctification, assuring us, that the same
virtue of Christ's death and Resurrection, which we find effectual for the
mortifying of our sins, and our spiritual quickening unto holiness and
newness of life, has been already alike effectual unto us, for the freeing
of us from the guilt of sin in our Justification, of which the other are but
fruits and effects. And secondly, we shall hereby be freed, in the greatest
part, from our fleshly corruption, and innumerable actual sins; seeing those
Psalm. 119. 9, 10, 11.
that are careful to please God in the duties of a godly life, do bend their
whole force in the use of all good means, for the subduing of their carnal
lusts, that though they dwell, yet they may not rule and reign in them;
resist, as much as in them lies, all the tentations of their spiritual
enemies, alluring and drawing them into sin, and keep a conscionable and
diligent watch over themselves, that they may not wittingly and willingly
commit any thing which Gods Law has forbidden and condemned. Whereof it
comes to pass, that howsoever they are sometime (and it may be not seldom)
overtaken through humane frailty and infirmity, and so, contrary to their
purpose and resolution, are led captive into sin, yet are they, by this care
and circumspection, preserved from falling into any known transgression, for
the most part, and from heinous and grievous sins, which wound and waste the
conscience, and like the hectique fever, consume the graces of God (as it were)
the vital spirits, which preserve the spiritual life; into which, worldly and
carnal men, who neglect the duties of a Godly life, do ordinarily fall, and
make them (as it were) their ordinary trade. Or if through violence of
tentation, and neglect of keeping their watch, they have been surprised upon a
sudden, and overtaken of such sins, yet having this care to please God in the
duties of a godly life, this will but very rarely happen; and when it does, yet
they do not like wicked men, multiply their transgressions, by committing
often the same heinous sin; nor impenitently continue in it from day to day,
and year to year, but being through frailty fallen, they do not lie still,
but labor to come out of it by unfeigned repentance. Now how inestimable this
benefit is, which accompanyeth a godly life, whereby, in the greatest part, we
get victory over our corruptions, by which, others are conquered, and as slaves
held captive, and preserved from falling into innumerable, and those the most
heinous sins; it will easily appear, if we consider the greatness of the
evil from which we are hereby delivered, namely, from sin, which, above all
things in the world is most odious unto God, and most pernicious unto our
souls and bodies, as being the root and fountain of all those mischiefs and
miseries, unto which men are liable, both in this life, and the life to come.

. Sect. 3 That by leading a godly life, we are freed from the punishment of
our sins.
The which also may be a second motive to persuade us unto a godly life, in
that being thereby in the greatest part freed from our sins in respect Prow.
19. 23.
of their corruption and sinful acts, and wholly in assurance of faith from
the guilt of them, by virtue of Christ's death and obedience applied unto us, we
do also hereby escape the punishments which are due unto them. Of both which
the saying of Solomon is verified; The fear of the Lord tends to life, and
he that has it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil; to
wit, either of sin and punishment. And again, The Prou. 14. 27.
fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to make us depart from the snares of
death. For first, the faithful which walk in the ways of holiness and
righteousness, are wholly freed by the death and sufferings of Christ, from
all punishments properly so called, which are inflicted to satisfy Gods
Justice, seeing Christ has made full satisfaction for all their sins; and
therefore as it would not stand with the Justice of God, to let them go
unpunished, so neither that they should be twice punished, once in our surety,
and the second time in our selves, as I have proved at large in another place.
Christian Warfare, the third part.
Whereas those who make no conscience of their ways, and neglect the duties of
a godly life, being out of Christ, do bear the punishment of their sins
themselves, both in this world and the world to come. Secondly, by leading of a
godly life, they also escape many temporary Heb. 6. 6, 7, 8.
judgments, and sharp afflictions, whereby God, like a gracious and wise
Father, does correct his children, when they neglect their duty, and sin
against him, which differ nothing from the punishments that are in this life
inflicted upon the wicked, in their matter, and oftentimes very little in the
quantity and sharpness of the stripes, but only in the causes from which they
proceed, which is the love of a gracious Father toward the one, and the anger
of a just and severe Judge toward the other, and also their diverse ends; the
chastizements of the Faithful, being intended for their good and amendment,
that they may not, being judged, be condemned with the world, but 1. Cor. 11.
32.
the punishments of the wicked, for the satisfying of Gods Justice, by
inflicting on them deserved punishments. But howsoever, the sins of the
Faithful cannot move the Lord to reject them, or cause his love to depart from
them, seeing it is one branch of the covenant made in Christ, that he will love
them with an everlasting love, and pardon all their sins; yet they do move
him to correct them with the rod of men, and Ier. 31. 3, 31, 33, 34. 2. Sam. 7.
14. Psalm. 89. 31, 32. Heb. 12. 6. Apoc. 3. 19.
the stripes of the children of men; for he chastizeth every son whom he
loves and receives, that being pulled out of their sins by strong hand,
which they would not flee and forsake out of mere love, they may, by their
unfeigned repentance and amendment, escape eternal condemnation; as we see in
the example of David, the Corinthians and many others. The which his just, yet
gracious severity, there is no possible 1. Cor. 11. 31, 32, 33.
means to escape, no not though Noah, Daniel and Job should intercede for us,
or any other who are most highly in his favor, unless Ezekiel. 14. 13.
we prevent these sharp corrections, by leading a godly life, and fleeing from
sin, which is the cause of them; or stay Gods hand, by turning from our
sins by unfeigned repentance. Which course if we take, we shall be freed not
only from eternal punishments, but also from temporary afflictions, which our
sins do bring upon us, unless it be such as the Lord inflicteth for the
trial of his graces in us, that being approved, they may be crowned with an
answerable measure of joy and heavenly happiness. According to that of
Solomon; A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hides himself; but the simple
pass on, and are punished. Or if by our sins we have brought them upon Pro.
22. 3.
us, yet repenting of them, and returning into the ways of righteousness, we
shall, when we cry unto God, obtain help and deliverance, according to that
of the Psalmist; The righteous cry, and the Lord hears, Psalm. 34. 17.
and delivers them out of all their troubles. Seeing then no chastening for
the present seems joyous, but grievous, what a strong motive should Heb. 12.
11.
this be, to persuade us to forsake all our sins, and to serve the Lord in
the duties of a godly life, seeing we have hereby this singular benefit, of
being freed from temporary afflictions, which are so sharp and bitter unto us?
A third benefit which will redound unto us by leading of a godly life, is, that
being unblameable, and giving unto none any just cause of offense, we shall
hereby stop the mouths of wicked men, so as they shall not be able to reproach
us, nor blemish our good name by their calumnies and slanders, with any shadow
or color of truth. And this was a strong reason to move the Apostle to walk
in a godly and unblameable life, that by exercising himself herein, he might
have always a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men. And this
Act. 23. 1. and 24. 16. Tit. 2. 7, 8.
argument he uses, to persuade Titus to show himself in all things a pattern
of good works, that he who was of the contrary part might be ashamed, having
no evil thing to say of him. Thus the Apostle Peter exhorts us to sanctify
the Lord in our hearts, and to have a good conscience in all things, 1. Pet. 3.
15, 16.
that whereas wicked men speak evil of us, as of evil doers, they may be
ashamed, that falsely accuse our good conversation in Christ. And persuades
the Faithful to abstain from fleshly lusts, and to have their conversation
honest 1. Pet. 2. 11, 12.
among the Gentiles, that whereas they spoke evil of them, as of evil doers,
they might by their good works which they should behold, glorify God in the
day of visitation. And thus he moves subjects to show all obedience to
Magistrates, because it is the will of God, that by well-doing, Verse. 15.
they should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men. Or if we cannot thus
far prevail with them by our holy conversation, in respect of their
maliciousness, but that they will seek to disgrace us by their unjust
slanders and reproaches, yet may we in the confidence, and peaceable
cleerenesse of a good conscience, stand out against them as a brazen wall,
beating back their false calumnies upon their own heads, and like immovable
rocks, return their foam and froth upon themselves, when as all that hear
them, shall condemn their malice and fals-hood; Yea, they shall by their
slanders but give occasion unto all men to speak of our innocence, in which
respect (as Job speaks) though they should write a book against us, Job 31.
35, 36.
we might take it upon our shoulders, and bind it as a crown unto us; and
that not only a Crown of Fame in this life, but of Glory also in the life to
come; according to that of our Savior; Blessed are Matthew. 5. 11, 12.
ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of
evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for
great is your reward in Heaven. And that of the Apostle Peter: If ye be
reproched for the Name of Christ, happy are ye, for the 1. Pet. 4. 14.
Spirit of Glory, and of God rests upon you. Now what a strong reason this
should be, to move us to walk unblameably in the duties of a Godly life, it
may hereby appear, if we consider how precious and excellent a good name is,
seeing as the Wiseman speaks; A Good name is rather to be chosen then great
Riches, Pro. 22. 1.
and loving favor rather then Silver and Gold. And is to be preferred before
the most precious ointment, seeing it smells most sweetly, both to our selves
and others which are near and far off. Eccl. 7. 1.


. Sect. 4 That a godly life does much strengthen us against Satan's tentations.
A fourth benefit of a godly life is, that it much strengthens us against the
assaults of Satan, and so armeth us against all his tentations, that they shall
not be able to do us any hurt. For whereas those who live in their sins, and
neglect the duties of a godly life, do give unto him all advantage against
them, and by leaving off the brestplate of Righteousness, do lie open to his
poisonous darts; so as he may easily persuade them, that they are subject to
Gods wrath and the curse of the Law, seeing they continue in their sins: that
they are not ingrafted into Christ, seeing they bring forth no fruits of
holiness and righteousness; that they are out of Gods favor, seeing they
have no care to please him, by performing such duties as are acceptable in his
sight; and finally, that they are not the children of God, because they are
nothing like him, nor reformed according to his image; nor heirs of heavenly
happiness, seeing they have not purged themselves, as it becomes those who
have this hope. Contrariwise, when we keep this brestplate of Righteousness
fast buckled unto us, we may without danger repel all his fiery darts, seeing
we are assured that we are in Gods favor, whilst we labor in all things to
please him; that we are in Christ, seeing without him we could do nothing;
that we are Gods children, seeing we resemble him Ioh. 15. 5.
in holiness and righteousness, and labor after perfection, as he is
perfect. That we are freed from the curse of the Law, and the guilt and
punishment of all our sins, seeing we feel the virtue of Christ's death
effectual in us, for the mortifying and subduing of our corruptions. And
finally, that maugre all the malice of our spiritual enemies, we shall attain
unto heavenly happiness, seeing our merciful God has graciously promised,
that he will reward our temporary service with this inestimable and eternal
wages, and crown his own graces in us, and the fruits which we have brought
forth of them in the Christian duties of a godly life, with endless joy and
immortality.

. Sect. 5 That by a godly life we are prepared against the day of death.
The fourth benefit of a godly life is, that thereby we are continually
prepared against the day of death, so that the manifold evils Heb. 9. 27.
which accompany it cannot hurt us, nor the dreadful terrors thereof daunt
and dismay us. For howsoever it is appointed that all must die, and this
sentence, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, is irreuocable, yet to
those that walk in the ways of godliness, the nature of death is quite
changed, and the sting thereof taken away. For of the last and greatest evil,
it is made unto them, a preparatiue to the chiefest good; of an enemy, it is
become a friend; of a Sargeant to arrest us and imprison us in hell, it is
become a joyful messenger sent of God, to deliver us out of all worldly
miseries, and to bring us into the joys of heaven. In which regard the Wise
man says, that howsoever Pro. 14. 32.
the wicked is driven away in his wickedness, yet the righteous has hope in
his death. And that riches profit not in the day of wrath, but righteousness
delivers Chap. 11. 4.
from death, that is, from the sting of death, and all the evils that do
accompany it. And the Spirit of God pronounces them Blessed, Apoc. 14. 13.
that die in the Lord; for they rest from their labors, and their works
follow them; Namely, that they may be crowned with joy and immortality. The
which if it were well weighed, might justly, not only free the faithful from
the immoderate fear of death, but also make it appear precious in their eyes,
as it is in the sight of God, and move them Psalm. 116. 15. Phil. 1. 21, 23.
August. in 1. Epist. Joan.
with the Apostle, to desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, seeing that
is best of all; and (as one says) not to die patiently, but to live with
patience, and to die with joy. For who rejoices not, when after a wearisome
pilgrimage, he approaches near unto his own Country; when after a dangerous
passage, wherein he has been tossed and turmoiled with adverse winds and
tempestuous storms, he is ready to arrive safely in the long expected haven;
when after his days labor, he comes to receive liberal wages; and when
after a dangerous and doubtful fight, having conquered all his enemies, he is
to be presented by the holy Angels before his Sovereign King, that he may
receive the Crown of victory? And howsoever death has many terrors which do
accompany it, yet to those that have served God in the duties of a godly life,
they need not seem terrible, seeing against every blow they have their ward,
against every poison their sovereign antidote. They must leave the world; but
they must go to heaven; forgo their riches, but for them enjoy heavenly
treasures; be deprived of momentanie delights, but that they may attain unto
everlasting joys; lose the comfort of all their friends, but in lieu of it,
shall have the sweet society of the Saints and Angels, yea, the fruition of
God himself, and his Christ and holy Spirit, whom to enjoy, is to be
perfectly happy. Yea, but it is a grievous sight to behold our friends mourning
for our departure: but this is recompensed with the hope of our happy meeting;
and the present joys of our heavenly entertaynement, by the rest of our
friends that are gone before us. Yea, but death is a straight and paynefull
passage; but it brings us to a spacious and glorious Palace. In our bodies
we are afflicted with many griefs of sickness; but these are eased with the
inward peace of conscience, and comfort of the Spirit. We are in every part of
our bodies racked with pain; but they are only the throws, that go before
our heavenly birth, whereby we are borne to everlasting and immortal glory.
Our bodies must be buried and corrupt in the earth; but being sown in
corruption, they shall arise incorruptible, and our mortal shall 1. Cor. 15.
42, 43
put on immortality, our weakness, strength; and our baseness, glory.
Finally, if living in Gods fear, we dye in his favor, we may be strongly
armed against all the terrors of death, and expect it at all times with a
joyful countenance.

. Sect. 6 That by leading of a godly life we are assured to be freed from
judgment and condemnation.
Lastly, by leading of a godly life, we may be assured, that we shall be
freed from Judgment, and condemnation in the world to come. For if we live
here in the fear of God, our sins shall not come into Judgment, because
they are already judged in Christ, who has satisfied Gods Justice for them,
and paid our debt to the uttermost farthing. If we have been careful here
to play the good Stewards, and daily keeping our reckonings straight, receive
our acquittance and discharge before we sleep, sealed with the blood of
Christ, applied unto us by a lively and renewed faith, we shall have nothing
to account for at the Day of Judgment. If we have been faithful and
diligent in our Masters service, we shall have nothing to do then, but to
receive with joy our reward and wages. If we walk not after the flesh, but
after Romans 8. 1.
the Spirit, we are in Jesus Christ, and there is no condemnation due unto us;
for he was condemned, that we might be acquitted, and suffered the
punishment of our sins, that Gods Justice being satisfied, and wrath
appeased, we might be freed from hell and death. If we be partakers of the
first Resurrection, from the death Apoc. 20. 6.
of sin, to the life of righteousness, the second death shall have no power
over us. Now what stronger motives can there be unto a godly life, then to be
thereby assured of deliverance from these greatest evils? For how terrible a
thing is it to fall into the hands Heb. 10. 31.
of the everliving God? and to be called to account before his Judgment
Seat, who searches the heart and reins, and will call us to a reckoning for
every idle word? Whose justice is so perfect, and his examination so strict,
that though we were as Matthew. 12. 33.
just as Job, yet we should not be able to answer one of a thousand. Job 9.
2, 3.
Though we were as holy as David, yet had we need to pray with him, Enter
not into Judgment with thy Servant, O Lord: for Psalm. 143. 2.
in thy sight shall no man living be justified. How fearful and intolerable,
endless and easelesse, are those hellish torments which they must endure, who
are not in this life acquitted from them? And consequently, how inestimable is
this benefit, and worthy to be valued more then ten thousand worlds, to be
fully assured, that we have through Christ escaped this severe Judgment,
hellish condemnation, and everlasting torments with the devil and his angels?
which assurance we can no otherwise attain unto, then by serving God in the
duties of a godly life, and bringing forth the fruits of our faith in
repentance and new obedience. But I shall not need to press these points any
further, although much more might be said of them, as being most effectual
motives to persuade us to flee all sin, and to practice all Christian duties
in the whole course of our lives, seeing they are much beaten upon, and largely
handled by many others, there being scarce any that omit them, who write of
and persuade unto Christian resolution.

CAP. XLII.
Other reasons, taken from those singular privileges, which are peculiar unto
those who serve God in the duties of a godly life.

. Sect. 1 The first privilege is, that the image of God is repaired in us.
ANd so much concerning the privative benefits which accompany a godly life.
The positive benefits which we receive by it, are manifold. For first, hereby
the image of God is repaired in us, and we are made like unto him, seeing this
image chiefly consists in wisdom, holiness and righteousness, whereby
knowing God and his will, we are transformed in all holy obedience unto it. So
the Apostle says, that we have put on the New man, which is renewed in
knowledge, after the image Col. 3. 10.
of him that created us. And exhorts us to be renewed in the Spirit of Ephe.
4. 23, 24.
our minds, and to put on the new man, which after God is created in
righteousness and true holiness. So that if we be renewed in wisdom and
knowledge, in holiness and righteousness, we shall become like unto God,
having his image through Christ renewed in us, after which we were created,
but had it defaced in us by the fall of Adam. And this argument the Scriptures
do often use to persuade us unto an holy and righteous life. So the Lord
himself presses this reason to his people: For I am the Lord your God, ye
shall therefore sanctify your selves, and Leuit. 11. 44. Leuit. 19. 2. and 20.
7.
ye shall be holy, for I am holy. And again, Ye shall sanctify your
selves, and be ye holy, for I am the Lord your God. And our Savior Christ
exhorts us to be therefore perfect, that, as children of our heavenly
Father, Matthew. 5. 45, 48
we may resemble him in perfection. So the Apostle would have us to approve
our selves to be the sons of God, by being blameless, harmless, Phil. 2 15.
and without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation. And the
Apostle John teaches us, how we may approve our selves to have fellowship 1.
John 1. 6, 7.
with God, namely, by walking in the light, as he is in the light. And Ephesians. 5.
1.
finally, the Apostle Peter persuades us to an holy life by the same reason:
As he that has called you is holy, so be ye holy, in all manner of 1. Pet.
1. 15, 16.
conversation, because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy. Neither in
truth can any thing be more effectual to persuade us to an holy life, then
this argument, if it be well waighed. For the nearer we come to this most
absolute and perfect pattern, the more we shall be restored to that state of
excellency and perfection, in which we were created; the more we resemble him
who is the chief Goodness and blessedness, the more we shall exceed in
goodness and glory, in holiness and happiness, the which always accompany
one another. The more like we are unto God, the more communion we shall have
with him; the more he will love us and delight in us, as a Father ordinarily
best loves that child, that most resembles him in favor and nature, though
oftentimes out of mere self-love, because he seems to live in him, and not
for any excellency that is in those parts and qualities which he loves in
him. And if generally likeness causes love, when there is no worth in the
thing beloved, how much more will God infinitely love us, when as by our
likeness we shall be made most lovely, and that for his own sake, with a pure
and perfect love, because his Image is stamped in us, and he after a sort
lives in us, and we in him, his holiness and righteousness being manifested
in our godly life and conversation?

. Sect. 2 The second privilege is, that by a godly life we have title and
interest in all Gods promises, and first, of temporal blessings.
Secondly, by a godly life we have interest unto all Gods promises, whereby he
has assured us of all his blessings and benefits, both temporal 1. Tim. 4. 8.
Psalm. 34. 9, 10. Psalm. 84. 11. 2. Pet. 1. 3, 4.
and eternal, according to that of the Apostle; Godliness is profitable unto
all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and that which is to
come. So the Psalmist says, that they which seek and fear the Lord, shall
not want any good thing. For the Lord God is a sun and shield, he will give
grace and glory; and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly. And the Apostle Peter testifies, that God, according to his divine
power, has given unto us (that is, all the faithful who serve him in
holiness and righteousness) all things that pertain unto life and
godliness, through the knowledge of him who has called us to glory and
virtue; whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, etc.
Now these blessings and benefits which God has promised as the gracious
rewards of a godly conversation, are either temporal, and of this life, or
eternal, and of the life to come. Those of this life; are either corporal,
concerning the body and outward estate; or spiritual, respecting chiefly the
good of the soul, by enriching it with all sanctifying and saving graces. The
benefits of the former kind are promised to all those who serve the Lord, and
carefully observe all his Commandments, although not absolutely, but
conditionally, so far forth as the corporal blessings will best stand with
Gods glory, and our spiritual and eternal good. Thus the Lord promises in
the Law, that he will give unto those who observe and keep it, all the Deuteronomy.
28.
blessings of this life, respecting either their persons or states. As that he
will bless them in themselves, and also in their children and posterity;
Leuit. 26.
that he will give them health of body, and a long life and good days, Psalm.
34. 12.
prosperity and plenty of all good things, strength of body, and gifts of the
mind, as wisdom, fortitude, and the rest, that he will bless them in the
field and in the house, at home in the city, and abroad, by giving them victory
over all their enemies, and causing them to be had in honor and high esteem
amongst all the nations which dwelt about them. All which his gifts, are unto
those that fear God, double blessings, because he not only gives the things
themselves, but also the right use of them, whereby they become truly
profitable. Secondly, because he makes his gifts sufficient, in what
proportion soever they are, for their preservation and comfort, and by giving
contentment with them, causes them to satisfy their desires; whereas worldly
men are insatiable, like the grave and hell, which never say, Enough. Thirdly,
because he does measure out unto them such a proportion of worldly blessings,
as is most fit for their spiritual estate, that they may be more mindful of
him, and have their faith, hope, affiance, humility, and other saving graces
exercised and increased, and does not suffer them to abound in such superfluous
excess, as would be rather an heavy burden unto them then a benefit; a
means to quench his graces in them, and to distract them in all religious
duties; a snare to entangle them in worldly cares, and to withdraw their hearts
from him, and to fasten them upon the world; an occasion to make them forget
him, and like pampered horses, to kick against him that feeds them; to
weaken their affiance, and to make them trust in themselves and their own
provisions; to puff them up in pride toward him, and insolency toward their
neighbors, as though they excelled them as much in true worth, as they exceed
them in worldly wealth. The which is a singular benefit to the faithful; that
seeing they cannot, through natural corruption, measure their appetite, the
Lord, like a careful and skillful Physician, should stint and diet them,
letting them have so much, not as they desire, but as they are well able to
digest, seeing a greater quantity would but surcharge their stomakes and cause
a surfeit, turning all the superfluity into crudities, and the hurtful humors
of vice and sin, as pride, covetousness, love of the world, and such like,
which would much hazard and impair their spiritual health. And thus the Lord
promises corporal blessings unto them that serve him, not simply and
absolutely, but so as they may be truly beneficial; not because he would have
them so mercenary as to serve him chiefly for worldly wages, as the devil
charged Job (for he respects only that filial obedience which arises out
of a Job 1. 9.
lively faith, and unfeigned love) but seeing we are so sensual, that we have
things present in great esteem, and neglect future blessings much more
precious and permanent, therefore the Lord graciously condescending unto our
weakness and infirmities, does also promise and give unto us corporal
benefits, as it were temporary wages, that receiving, besides our future hopes,
this present pay, we might the rather be encouraged to perform unto him
diligent service. Thus the Lord persuades us not to forget his Law, but to
apply our hearts to keep his Commandments, because Pro. 3. 2.
length of days, long life, and peace they shall add unto us. Thus wisdom
moves all to embrace her, not only for her spiritual excellencies, but Pro.
8. 18.
also because riches and honor are with her; (and those which seldom meet)
Job 22. 24, 25.
durable riches and righteousness, unless these promises are rather to be
taken in a spiritual sense. And our Savior Christ persuades us to forsake
the world and our selves by this argument, because no man that leaves Mar. 10.
29, 30.
house, or brethren, or sisters, etc. for his sake and the Gospels, but they
shall receive an hundred fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and
sisters, etc. and in the world to come eternal life. The Apostle also uses
this reason to persuade unto Christian beneficence, not only because they
should reap a plentiful harvest, of their seed so sown, in heaven, but also
because God 2. Cor. 9. 6, 8.
was able to return unto them such sufficient plenty of temporal blessings,
that they might still abound unto every good work. So that Gods earthly and
corporal benefits, which he has promised to those that serve him, may serve
as strong, though not the strongest reasons, to make us diligent in all
Christian duties. For howsoever carnal and worldly men are to be condemned,
who stand most affected to temporary rewards, enquiring who will show them any
good, and what profit there is in serving the Almighty, Mal. 3. 14.
when any man persuades them unto it; yet Gods own children, though they are
chiefly to regard spiritual grace and heavenly glory, may have, in performance
of their duty, some respect to earthly benefits, and encourage themselves in
Gods service, in hope to receive such a proportion of them, as will stand with
their spiritual good and eternal salvation, to which end God has promised
them.

. Sect. 3 That by a godly life, Gods saving graces are much increased in us.
The second sort of the benefits of this life, are Gods spiritual graces, all
which are much increased by a godly life. And first, hereby our faith is much
confirmed and increased, by our frequent performing the duties of holiness and
righteousness. For as often Acts do confirm and increase an habit; and both
our bodily strength, and all faculties of the mind, are not only preserved,
but also much improoued by continual exercise; so virtuous actions and works
of piety and righteousness, being the exercises of our faith, do tend much to
the strengthening of it; whereas contrariwise, by the neglect of these duties,
it is much weakened, and by the contrary vices and acts of sin exceedingly
shaken, and grievously wounded. In which regard, the Apostle joins the
holding of faith, and a 1. Tim. 1. 19. 1. Cor. 15. 58.
good conscience, because the one will not stay without the other, being such
loving twins as cannot be divided, but live and die together. More especially,
the duties of a godly life, do confirm our faith in the assurance of our
election, not as causes, for the election of God is free of grace, and Romans 11.
6. Ephesians. 1. 4.
not of works, but as the effects and fruits of it, and as the end unto which
we are elected, for we are not chosen because we were holy, but to the end
that we might be holy, as the Apostle shows. Thus the Apostle Peter
exhorting us to make our calling and election sure, 2. Pet. 1. 10.
prescribes this as the only means, the joining of one virtue and Christian
duty with another, telling us, that if we do these things, we shall never
fall. The Psalmist likewise setting down the marks and signs, whereby we
may know whether God has chosen us to dwell in his holy mountain, makes this
the first and chief, to walk uprightly, and work righteousness, Psalm. 15. 2.
and 24. 4.
and to have clean hands, and a pure heart. Secondly, hereby our faith is
persuaded of Gods grace and love in Christ. For by keeping of Gods
Commandments, we are assured that we love God, according to that of the
Apostle John, Whosoever keeps his Word, in him verily is the love of God
perfected; 1. Ioh. 3. 6. 1. Ioh. 4. 19.
and consequently, that he loves us, seeing we love him, because he loved us
first, our love being but a spark of that divine and infinite flame. Thirdly,
of our effectual calling, this being the means which the Apostle prescribes
to make it sure. For hereby we know, that the grace of God, 2. Pet. 1. 10.
Tit. 2. 11, 12.
bringing salvation, has shined unto us, when as we are taught thereby, to
deny ungodliness and worldly lusts; and to live soberly, righteously, and
godly in this present world; that we have in a saving manner heard Gods Word,
when having received it into honest hearts, we have brought forth fruits Luke
8. 15.
with patience. That we are ingrafted into Christ the true Vine, when Ioh. 15.
we bring forth the ripe Grapes of holiness and righteousness. That we are
trees of righteousness of Gods own planting, when like the tree planted by
the rivers of waters, we bring forth fruit in due season. That we are good
men, when out of the good treasure of our heart Psalm. 1. 2. Mat. 7. 17, 18, 20
we bring forth that which is good. That we are of God, and the Sheep of
Christ, when we hear Gods Word, and follow him. And that we are truly Luke
6. 45.
a kin to Christ, when we do the will of his Father which is in heaven.
Ioh. 8. 47. Mat. 12. 50.
Fourthly, by a godly life, and the works of piety and righteousness, our
faith is assured of it self, that it is lively and unfeigned; for as our good
works do show it unto others, so also they approve it unto our selves, as
being the fruits of this tree, and the very breath of this body, without which,
it is but a dead stock and rotten carcass. For as the Apostle James Iam. 2.
17, 26.
tells us, Faith, if it have no works, is dead, being alone; And as the body
without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. Fifthly, our
faith is hereby assured of our justification, and of all the fruits and
benefits that do accompany it. As that we are freed from our sins, both in
respect of their guilt and punishment, by the death and resurrection of Jesus
Christ, when as by the virtue and power of them, we feel our selves delivered
from the corruption of them, so as they do not rule and reign in us, as in
former times, and quickened in the inner man unto holiness and newness of
life. That we are reconciled unto God, when as we feel an earnest desire and
constant endeavor wrought in us of pleasing him in all things. That we are his
children by adoption and grace, when we live as it becomes his children, and
resemble our heavenly Father in holiness and righteousness. That we are
sanctified by his Spirit, when as we bring forth the fruits of our
sanctification in a godly and Christian life. That we have unfeignedly repented
of our sins, when as we bring forth fruits worthy amendment, and do daily
exercise our selves in good works. Finally, that we are Citizens of heaven,
and heirs of everlasting happiness, when as we have our conversation there,
setting our hearts and affections on things above, and not on things beneath;
and when having Phil. 3. 20. Col. 3. 2. Joh. 3. 2, 3.
this hope, that we shall be made like unto Christ, we have purged our selves,
as he also is pure.

. Sect. 4 That a godly life strengthens and increases our hope and confidence
in God.
The second spiritual benefit of a godly life is, that it strengthens and
increases our hope and confidence in God, grounded upon this assurance, Psalm.
34. 15.
that he will preserve all those that fear and serve him, from all evil, all
perils and dangers, and the malice and might of all their enemies, and that he
will provide for them all things necessary, seeing he, who is so bountiful
even to his enemies, will not let his own children want any thing that is
good, who have a desire to serve and please him. So that they which fear the
Lord, have great cause to trust in the Lord, as the Psalmist Psalm. 115. 11.
exhorts, because he is their help and shield. And this made the three
Children so confident, that they cared not for the rage of the Tyrant, nor for
the fiery Furnace, though seuenfold hotter then ordinary, because they had
served God with a good conscience, and thereby were assured, that the God whom
they served, was both able and willing to deliver them. Dan. 3. 17.
This made Daniel to serve God constantly, whom he had formerly served,
notwithstanding the cruel edict of the King; because he well knew, that the
God whom he served, was able to deliver him from the Lions, as Dan. 6. 16.
Darius also acknowledged. From which confidence there arise diverse other
singular benefits, as inward joy and comfort in all estates, seeing in this
confidence we have cast all our care upon God; patience in all troubles, seeing
we trust assuredly in God for help and deliverance, in that time which shall
be most seasonable, both for his glory, and our own spiritual good and
everlasting salvation. Cheerfulness in the ways of godliness, when they
seem fullest of difficulty and danger, because the Lord, in whom we trust, is
able to support and defend us. And finally, conscience of our well doing, and
our earnest desire to glorify and please God in all Christian and holy duties,
does not only much strengthen our faith in the assurance of Gods infinite
mercies, and Christ's all-sufficient merits, but also exceedingly confirm our
affiance, in the sense and feeling of Gods love, so that we are thereby
enabled, with great confidence, to have our access unto the Throne of grace,
and with much liberty of speech and spirit, to make all our suits known unto
him, with assurance that they shall be graciously heard and granted. For the
effectual Iam. 5. 16.
fervent prayer of arighteous man avails much. And we are assured, with
David, that the God of our righteousness will hear our prayers, and that the
Lord, Psalm. 4. 1, 3.
who sets apart him that is godly, for himself, will hear us (being such)
when we call upon him; That the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and
that his ears are open to hear their cry. The which the Apostle Peter uses,
Psalm. 34. 15.
as an effectual argument, to move us to eschew evil, and do good, to seek
1. Pet. 3. 11, 12.
peace, and ensue it, because it confirms our confidence, that God will hear
and grant all our suits; seeing, as the Psalmist speaks, He will fulfill
Psalm. 145. 19.
the desires of them that fear him, he also will hear their cry, and will
save them. For howsoever the chief and principal cause of our confidence and
boldness be not any thing in our selves, but only Jesus Christ, in whom God
is well pleased with us, according to that of the Apostle; In whom Ephesians. 3. 12.
we have boldness and access with confidence, by the faith of him: And though
this be the maine ground of our affiance, when we make our suits known unto
God, because Christ our high Priest makes intercession for us, in confidence
whereof we may, as the Apostle exhorts, come boldly unto the Heb. 4. 16.
Throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of
need, yet we may draw near with much more boldness, and with a true heart, in
full Heb. 10. 22.
assurance of faith, when we have our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,
and our bodies washed with pure water; that is, not only the blood of
Redemption, which purges us from the guilt of our sins, but also the water
of ablution, which cleansing us from the corruption of sin, does assure us,
that we are washed in that Lauer of Christ's blood; and when our consciences are
so purged from dead works thereby, as that we are enabled, in some good
measure, to serve the living God. For if we regard wickedness in our Heb. 9.
14. Psalm. 66. 18.
hearts, we can have no assurance that God will hear us; if we come into Gods
presence with guilty consciences, accusing us for the neglect of his service,
and for living in sin without repentance, shame will cover our faces, and
take away all boldness and confidence, when we make our suits unto him. For
we know, that if our heart condemn us, God is greater Job. 3. 20, 21, 22
then our heart, and knows all things; but if our hearts condemn us not,
then have we confidence toward God: And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him,
because we keep his Commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in
his sight. For this makes him to entertain our suits, not only graciously in
respect of us, but also with great pleasure in himself, according to that of
Solomon; The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord; but Pro.
15. 8.
the prayer of the upright is his delight. Whereof it is that David, though a
man highly in Gods favor, would not rashly press into his presence, to make
his suits unto him, before he had renewed his righteousness by faith and
repentance. For he professes, that he would first wash his hands Psalm. 26. 6.
in innocence, and then he would compass Gods Altar. Now what greater benefit
then this, or what more effectual motive unto a godly life, then to have
hereby the grace and favor of our Sovereign Lord and King, so as we may at
all times, with boldness, come into his presence, and as his chief favorites,
have his ear still open unto us, so as we may freely make all our suits known
unto him, with assured confidence, that they shall be heard and granted, seeing
he takes delight in our prayers, and is as well pleased in giving, as we in
receiving?

. Sect. 5 That a godly life brings courage and true fortitude.
The third spiritual benefit which a godly life brings, is Christian courage
and true fortitude: For being assured of Gods favor and gracious assistance,
no dangers are able to daunt us; and having put on the brestplate of
righteousness, we fear not the incounters of any enemies. According to that
of Solomon; The wicked flee, when no man pursues, but the righteous are bold
as a Lion. An example whereof we have in David, who was so courageous in the
assurance of Gods assistance, that he says, he would not be afraid of ten
thousand of people, that had set themselves against Psalm. 3. 5.
him round about. And professes, that because God was his refuge and Psalm. 46.
1, 2.
strength, he would not fear though the earth were removed, and though the
Mountains were carried into the midst of the sea. Yea, though he should
walk Psalm. 23. 4.
through the vale of the shadow of death, yet he would fear no evil, because
God was with him, and his rod and staff comforted him. Neither was this his
case alone, but of all those that fear and serve the Lord, who, as he shows
at large, stand in fear of no evil, though dangers beset them on all sides,
because they have made God their refuge and fortress, who will therefore Psalm.
91. 2, 3, etc.
deliver them from the fear of the Fowler, and from the noisome pestilence,
etc. And give his Angels charge over them, to keep them in all their ways;
who shall bear them up in their hands, lest they dash their foot against a
stone. And therefore if we would be truly courageous, let us serve God in the
duties of a godly life, and being safe under his protection, and having him on
Romans 8. 31. Psalm. 56. 11.
our side, we shall not need to care who set against us, nor to fear what man
can do unto us.

. Sect. 6 That a godly life keeps our consciences pure and peaceable.
The fourth benefit is, that this godly life does keep our consciences pure
and peaceable. For when we set our selves with full resolution to please God
in all things, we carefully flee all known sins, whereby the conscience
would be defiled. And so having nothing to lay to our charge, or to accuse us
of before God, saving humane frailties and infirmities, for which we have (as
it were) a pardon of course, sealed by the blood of Christ; the conscience
becomes peaceable, and speaks nothing but good and joyful things unto us,
testifying the remission of our sins, our reconciliation with God, and that
we and our works are accepted of him. So that if with uprightness of heart we
will serve the true Melchisedech, in the duties of a godly life, he will be
unto us, not only a King Heb. 7. 2.
of righteousness, but also a King of peace. For dying for our sins, and
rising again to justify us, he has at his departure left this rich legacy to
all his true Disciples; Peace I leave with you, may peace I give unto you. The
Ioh. 14. 27. and 16. 33.
which is not to be esteemed a gift of small value, seeing as the Apostle
tells us, it passes all understanding; being one of those fruits, wherein
Phil. 4. 7.
the Kingdom of heaven, and our everlasting happiness is begun in us in this
life; for as he says, The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but Romans
14. 27.
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost. The which may
effectually move us to all Christian and holy duties of a godly life, seeing
these first fruits of heavenly joy, are incomparably of more value, then a
whole harvest of all earthly happiness, even in their present worth, as
bringing with them more sound comfort and contentment, more durable and lasting
joy; and also because they are sure evidences and earnest-pennies of our
heavenly Inheritance, and full fruition of everlasting blessedness.

. Sect. 7 That a godly life causes constancy and perseverance unto the end.
The fifth benefit which we shall receive by a godly life is, that if we once
with a firm resolution and earnest endeavor set our selves to serve and please
God, we shall continue in this estate, notwithstanding our manifold infirmities
and corruptions which make us daily prone to fall into sin. For they who are
once received into covenant with God, have not only the gracious promise of
the remission of their sins, but also have the means offered unto them, yea
wrought in them by God, of unfeigned repentance, whereby turning unto him from
their sins, and renewing their faith, which is the condition of the covenant,
in the assurance that they are all pardoned in Christ, they may with peace and
comfort proceed again in their course of godliness, as if they had never
failed in it, nor gone astray. Neither does the Lord only, as a gracious
Father, provide fit nourishment for his children, to preserve them in their
health and strength; but like a skillful and wise Physician, sovereign
medicines to recover them when they are sick and weak; and not only
affoordeth unto them means to keep them whole and sound, but the precious
Balm of Gilead, the blood of Christ, applied by faith; and the salve of all
sores of sin, unfeigned repentance, to heal them, when in the spiritual
conflict they are hurt and wounded. The which he proudeth for them, and (as it
were) puts it into their hands by his earnest exhortations, O Israel, turn
unto the Lord thy God, for thou have fallen by thine iniquity. Take Hos. 14. 1,
2.
unto you words, and turn to the Lord; Say unto him, Take away all iniquity,
and receive us graciously. And again; As I live, says the Lord God, I have
Ezekiel. 33. 11.
no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way
and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye dye, ye
house Ier. 8. 5, 6.
of Israel? Yea, he is displeased with them, and sharply reprooueth them, if
they neglect this medicine when he offers it unto them, that they may be
cured: Why is this people slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold
Ier. 31. 20.
fast deceit, they refuse to return; no man repented him of his wickedness,
saying, What have I done, etc? And if thus they are not moved to return, his
bowels are troubled, and yearne with compassion, as the Prophet speaks; and
he is sorry that they sorrow not, as we see in the example of our Savior
Christ, who wept over Jerusalem, because they would not make use Luke 19. 41.
of the acceptable Day whilst it lasted, that they might repent, and so escape
Gods imminent Judgments. Yea, he does not so leave them, but effectually
works, in the hearts of his faithful and chosen Ones, this repentance Act.
5. 31.
which he requires: for he gives repentance to the house of Israel: Ezekiel. 36.
26. Zach. 12. 10.
he takes away their stony hearts, and gives them hearts of flesh: he
powers the Spirit of grace upon the house of Judah, and causes them to
bewail their sins. The which may be unto us a singular encouragement in our
Christian course, when as we are assured, that notwithstanding our many
frailties and infirmities, we shall not be cast off, and though we have many
foiles and falls, yet we shall not lie still and perish in our sins; seeing
the Lord gives unto all his that fear and serve him, the grace of unfeigned
repentance, so as they rise again, and recover their former estate of
holiness, and withal his wonted grace and favor, as though they had never
sinned, and with it their wonted peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

. Sect. 8 Of the benefits which a godly life brings at the hour of death.
And these are the benefits which accompany a godly life, whilst we continue
in the world: the benefits which it brings, when by death we are to depart
out of it, are also great and inestimable: For when all worldly blessings
fail, and like miserable comforters leave and forsake us; when being in
greatest agony and distress, we stand in most need of help, then the
consolations which it brings, do exceedingly cheer and refresh us. For the
good Spirit of God, which has ruled and guided us throughout the whole course
of our lives, does not leave and forsake us at the hour of death, but then
especially does accompany and assist us, and the more our afflictions and
griefs abound, the more it causes our consolations to abound also. For it
seals in our hearts and consciences, the assurance of the pardon and
remission of all our sins, and says unto us, as sometimes Christ to the
sick of the palsy; Son, be of good comfort, thy sins are Matthew. 9. 2.
forgiven thee. It incourageth us against the fear of death, by assuring us,
that it has lost its sting, and therefore though like a serpent it still
hiss, yet it is not able to do us any hurt. It causes the beams of Gods
love to shine clearly in our hearts, by which they are so warmed and cheered,
that the chill and cold terrors of death cannot daunt and dismay us. It
calls to our remembrance our former care to serve and please God, and how we
have walked with him and before him, though not in legal perfection, yet with
integrity and uprightness Esa. 38. 3.
of heart, and how we have done that which is good in Gods sight. It witnesses
with our consciences, that we have been faithful Stewards, who have well
husbanded Gods talents entrusted unto us; and that our accounts are even, so
that we need not fear now when we are called to a reckoning. Yea, it puts
into our hands a general acquittance, sealed with the blood of Christ, that
we may have it in readiness, when we appear before our Judge. It tells us,
that now all our labors are ended, and that nothing remains, but to receive
our wages, and to keep with God, his Saints and holy Angels a perpetual
Sabbath in all joy and happiness; that now we are safely passed through a sea
of danger, and are arriving and entering into the heavenly Haven of everlasting
rest; that we have fought a good fight, and 2. Tim. 4 7. 8.
finished it with an happy victory, and that now nothing remains, but to
receive the Crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge has
laid up for us, and is now ready to set upon our heads with triumph and glory.
Again, a godly life changes the nature of death, and of a curse for sin,
makes it to become a great blessing; as being a means to free us from all
evils, and to enter us into the fruition of the chiefest good; so that
whosoever with the Apostle have led their lives in the true fear of God, may
say with him; For to me to live, is Phil. 1. 21.
Christ; and to die, is gain. For the death of the godly puts an end to all
their troubles, that all tears may be wiped from their eyes. It causes them
Apoc. 21. 4.
cease to sin, which so long as they live in the flesh, hangs upon them as
an heavy burden, and presses out of them many a sorrowful sigh and deep
groan. It brings with it a joyful rest from all their labors, which in this
life are so tedious and troublesome, and puts an end to their wearisome
pilgrimage. It freeth them from all worldly miseries, from poverty and penury,
sores and sicknesses, slanders and disgraces, and brings with it heavenly
plenty, and the riches of Gods Kingdom, perpetual health and everlasting
glory. It puts an end to the spiritual conflict, and to all the assaults of
our many, mighty and malicious enemies, so as they shall never more be able to
disturb our peace. It separateth us from the society of wicked Psalm. 120. 5.
worldlings, which whilst we live, is so irksome and dangerous, and from
participating with them either in their sins or punishments. It secureth us
from the evils to come, and acquitteth us from approaching dangers. Finally, as
it puts an end to all our evils both of punishment and sin, so it serves
as an entrance into the full fruition of all good, and for a strait gate,
whereby we pass into heavenly happiness. All which considerations should be
effectual reasons to persuade to the leading of a godly life, which is always
attended upon by such a blessed death, that brings so many comforts with it,
when all other comforts fail; and so many joys after it; of all which they
deprive themselves, who neglect Gods service, and spend their time and strength
in the eager pursuit of worldly vanities.

. Sect. 9 Of the inestimable benefits which a godly life will bring in the
world to come.
Finally, as a godly life is in this world profitable to all purposes, so is it
most beneficial in respect of the life to come. For thereby we Romans 8. 1.
Apoc. 20. 6.
are secured from that everlasting woe and misery, prepared for all those who
live and die in their sins, seeing there is no condemnation to those who are
in Jesus Christ, which walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, and the
second death shall have no power over them, who have their part in the first
resurrection, to holiness and newness of life. Secondly, we are assured
hereby of heavenly happiness; For they that have followed Matthew. 19. 28.
Christ in the regeneration, shall accompany him in glory. They that have
lived like Gods children in holiness and righteousness, as in this life they
have the adoption of sons, and the Spirit of adoption, Romans 8. 15.
crying in their hearts Abba, Father, so shall they in the life to come,
receive from their Father their heavenly inheritance; whereas they who have
neglected these duties, can neither have this hope here, nor that fruition
hereafter, seeing without holiness no man shall see God. For 1. Ioh. 3. 2, 3.
Heb. 12. 14.
howsoever (as one says) God made us without our selves, yet he will Augustine.
not so save us. But having given us a Being, reasonable souls, and his Word,
whereby he has made us acquainted with his will, and required our conformity
and obedience, he will have us join with him in working out our own
salvation, by performing those duties Phil. 2. 12.
which he has prescribed; and to walk in the way of holiness and
righteousness, which leads to everlasting happiness. So that though our
service of God in holy duties be not the cause of eternal life and glory, but
the free mercies of God and merits of Christ, yet being the way which leads
unto it, all may be assured that they shall attain to heavenly happiness, who
go constantly in it; whereas contrariwise they who never go in this way, can
never come unto that glory unto which it leads. Finally, a godly life is most
profitable in respect of the life to come, because God graciously crowns his
own graces in his children, and the fruits of them in their new obedience,
with a proportionable measure of glory and happiness, so that they who have in
this life shined brightest in the light of grace Dan. 12. 3.
and godliness, shall in that life shine brightest in glory and blessedness.
They who have most glorified him by their holy conversation, he will impart
unto them the greatest measure of glory, and both make them capable, and
replenish them with greatest joys. So that if we have any care or desire to
be secured from endless miseries, or to be assured of eternal happiness, let
us be moved hereby to serve and please God in the duties of an holy life; yea,
seeing the Lord in some proportion fitteth his wages to our works, and the
rich rewards of his free grace, according to those endeavors which he has
wrought in us of seeking his glory; let us, being transported with an holy
ambition, deuote our selves wholly to his service, and not only labor to keep
an ordinary pace with others, but striving for the richest prize, let us
endeavor to outstrip all that run with us in the race of godliness.

CAP. XLIII.
Of other singular privileges, wherewith God crowns a godly life.

. Sect. 1 Their conceits confuted, who imagine that God wholly reserueth the
rewards of those that serve him, for the life to come.
Having seen the benefits which accompany a godly life, let us now also
consider of the privileges wherewith God crowns those that lead it.
Although in truth there is little difference between these two, seeing those
benefits are privileges, as being peculiar prerogatives belonging only to the
godly; and these privileges singular benefits, which are promised and given
them as rewards of their godliness. But because I would not glut the Readers
appetite with satiety, by setting before him all at once, a multitude of dishes
cooked after the same fashion, I thought it not amiss to reserve these that
follow (as it were) for an after-course or second service, dressed in somewhat
a different manner; for as I considered the former benefits as the fruits of a
godly life; so I will consider these, as privileges coming directly from God,
wherewith he endoweth and inuesteth the persons of the godly, who desire and
endeavor to serve and please him. Although here again I must confess, that
those fruits of godliness are the free gifts of Gods grace, and these
privileges wherewith God peculiarly aduanceth the godly, may insome sort be
called the fruits of their godliness. But that we may come to our present
purpose. It is the conceit of wicked worldlings, that God wholly deferreth to
reward those that leave their sins, and deuote themselves unto his service,
till the Day of Judgment; and the punishments of those who neglect him, and
serve their own lusts, to the same time, if at least they believe at all, that
there will be such a Day, or such a retribution of rewards and punishments:
And that in the mean while all things happen alike to all, to the righteous
and to Eccles. 9. 2.
the wicked, to the good and clean, and to the evil and unclean, etc. Now
because (according to the Jews proverb) the days are prolonged, Ezech. 12.
22.
therefore they conclude, that all prophecies shall fail, being ready with
those scorners to ask; Where is the promise of his coming? And 2. Pet. 3. 4.
Eccles. 8. 11.
because sentence against their evil works is not executed speedily,
therefore their hearts are fully set in them to do evil; and because good
works, and the sincere service of God is not (as they think) in this life
rewarded, they measuring all things by sense and outward appearance, conclude
that there is no profit in it. And that therefore they will not buy uncertain
hopes at so high a price, as to forgo for them the pleasures of sin, which are
so sweet to their carnal taste, and Mal. 3. 14.
to weary themselves in Gods service, which is so distastefull to their corrupt
appetite.

. Sect. 2 That God ordinarily gives greatest plenty of worldly blessings to
worldly men.
And surely it cannot be denied, but that God, in the greatest part, reserueth
in his own keeping the rewards which he has promised to Psalm. 17. 14. and 73.
7. Luke 16. 25.
his own servants, and makes them to live more by faith then sense. That
ordinarily he gives outward and temporal things in greatest plenty, to such
beasts as he fatteth for the slaughter, and lets his own sheep feed upon
bare Commons; that he fills the bellies of wicked men with his hid
treasures, and causes their eyes to stand out with fatness; because
(according to their own desires) he gives unto them their portion in this
life, and all the good things which they are ever to enjoy; and keeps his
own children to a shorter allowance and more spare diet, trayning them up in
his School, with more severe discipline, that learning his will and ways,
they may be made fit for their heavenly Inheritance. It is true, that Gods
servants also are most commonly subject to crosses and afflictions more then
other men; and always debarred of many pleasures of sin, which are sweet
and delightful to the carnal appetite, of which bewitching cups the wicked of
the world do drink their fill. So that if they should be sequestered from
their hopes, and judged only according to outward appearance, they, above all
others, would seem most miserable. But what more then brutish blockishnesse
were this, if we should by all this be encouraged in sin, or 1. Cor. 15. 19.
discouraged in Gods service? For can we imagine that the just Judge of heaven
and earth should deal unjustly? or that Wisdom it self Genesis 18. 25.
should be so unwise in the dispensation of rewards and punishments? Is God
thus bountiful to strangers and enemies, that he causes them to abound with
earthly blessings; and reserueth he nothing better in store for his own
children that serve and please him? Does he correct their slips and falls with
such smarting rods of temporary afflictions? and has he not three-stringed
whips, Strappadoes and Rackes, for such as traitorously rebel against him, and
wilfully dishonor him by their outrageous wickedness? Shall we, who have not
so much as the least spark of that justice and truth, bounty and goodness,
which is in him as an infinite flame, perform our promises which we have made
to our servants? and shall not God keep his covenant with his? Shall we
prefer those of our own family before strangers, and extend our bounty to
those that serve and please us by doing our will, much more then to others who
neglect us, yea rather disgrace and wrong us by their ill carriage? and shall
the Lord, whom we see so bountiful to his enemies, be niggardly to his
friends? and not reserve his richest rewards for those which have endeavored to
do him best service, seeing heaven and earth are at his disposing? Let us not
then so much look upon our severe education, as upon the inheritance unto
which we are thus trained. Not upon the sorrowful seede-time, but upon our
joyful harvest. Not upon our sharp conflict, wounds and skarres, but upon our
Victory, Triumph and Crown: And so shall we be easily able to make Moses
his choice, and rather desire to suffer affliction with the people of God, then
to enjoy the pleasures of sin, Heb. 11. 25.
which last but for a season.

. Sect. 3 That even in this life God endoweth the Godly with many singular and
peculiar privileges, and first, that he loves them above all other his
creatures.
Yet, that secure worldlings may not be proud of their present preferments, nor
pleasing themselves with their portion, neglect to do God better service,
because they think he has no better wages then the temporary pay of worldly
benefits; and that Gods faithful Servants may not be discouraged in holy and
Christian duties, because all their estate stands in hopes, and little in
fruition; let us consider in the next place, that even in this life the
faithful have many rich and royal privileges, as the present pay and earnest
of their heavenly happiness, for their better encouragement in all Christian
duties, of which, wicked worldlings that utterly neglect them, are wholly
destitute. Whereof we are to take the better notice, because howsoever they
generally belong to all Gods children, yet many take little comfort by them,
either by reason of their ignorance, which causes them not to know them; or
their carelessness, which will not let them seriously consider of them; or
their earthly-mindednesse, which makes them, with Lots wife, more to look
back upon the pleasures of Sodom, then upon those privileges which lie before
them, as they are going on in the ways of godliness, and to cast their eyes
so much upon the false splendour and brightness of worldly vanities, that being
dazzled therewith, they are not able to discern spiritual and heavenly
excellencies; or finally, because they are so negligent in the duties of Gods
service, and weaken their faith with so many slips and falls, wants and
imperfections, that they are not able to make use of their privileges, nor to
apply them unto themselves with any comfort and assurance. And to speak
nothing of that reward which virtue and holy duties bring with them, in their
own excellency, and in the conscience of well-doing; nor of the foulness of
vice, which is punished in it self, and with those checkes of conscience, and
terrors of mind accompanying sinful actions, which make the heart sorrowful
and full of disquietnesse, when there is nothing but mirth and iollity in
outward appearance (in which regard, notwithstanding piety in the service of
God, is much to be preferred before the pleasing of our own sinful lusts,
though there were no afterreckoning, no heaven or hell, rewards or punishments)
there are many special and rich privileges, wherewith God even in this life
crowns that faithful service which is done unto him. The first, and
fountain of all the rest, is, that God loves them above all other his
creatures, with a special and singular love, which moves him to multiply all
his favors upon them, in all things which may further their temporary good and
everlasting happiness. For he loves those that fear and serve him, with an
everlasting love, and having set his affection upon them, he loves them to
Ier. 31. 3. Ioh. 13. 1.
the end; which he has notably manifested unto them, in that this love could
not be broken off by their enmity against him, but when they were yet sinners
and enemies, he sent his Son, his only Son, the Son of his love, to die
for their sins, that they by him might attain unto everlasting Ioh. 3. 16.
Romans 5. 8, 10.
life and happiness. In him he has adopted them for his sons and children,
and loves them as a tender father loves his child, accepting Ioh. 1. 12. 1.
Ioh. 3. 1. Mal. 3. 17, 18.
graciously of all their imperfect service, passing by all their infirmities,
and pardoning all their sins. Yea, he numbreth them among his chiefest
Jewels, and indoweth them with such special testimonies of his love, that it
is easy to discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that
fears God, and him that serves him not. But though the love of a father be
great toward his child, yet it does not sufficiently express Gods love
toward his, and therefore he compares it to the love of a tenderhearted
mother toward her sucking infant. And yet this comes short (as it needs
must: for how can that which is finite reach to that which is infinite?) and
therefore he says, that though a woman may forget her sucking child, yet he
will not forget them. And in this regard, to express Esa. 49. 15.
the greatness of his love, he takes a resemblance, from the highest degree
of love amongst men, which is of an husband toward his wife, Hos. 2. 19.
yea of a Bridegroom to his Bride, unto which, the love of parents and
friends, yea, of any other thing in the world, gives place, seeing they are
coupled in such near union and communion, that they are no more two, but one
flesh; so that the one, in loving the other, loves himself, and cannot Genesis
2. 24.
make much of his Spouse, but he cherishes his own flesh, (as it were) in
another body. The which infinite love of God toward those that serve him,
gives unto them full assurance, as of his present favors, so especially of
heavenly happiness. For if the Lord delight in us, then he will assuredly
Number. 14. 8.
bring us into this heavenly Canaan, which flows with a large stream of
far greater blessings then milk and honey, even with a flood of pleasures,
which are at Gods right hand for evermore. If the Lord so dearly love Job. 17.
21, 24.
us, then he will delight in our company, and where he is, there we shall be
also. 1. Job. 3. 2.
For where should the children be, but in their fathers family? Where should
the Bride be, but with her Bridegroom, who take their chief pleasure in the
mutual fruition of one another love? The which high and holy privilege, is a
most effectual reason to make us diligent in all the duties of Gods service,
which assures us that we are in this love and liking with God, upon which
depends our eternal happiness. For if men think it such an high
prerogative to be the favorites of great Princes, that they think all pains
and service too little, which may endeare them to their love, because this
alone intitleth them to all other benefits of honors, riches, and pleasures
which a kingdom can yield unto them; then with what cheerfulness should we
perform all holy duties of Gods service, which assure us, that we shall be,
and are his special Favorites, who has heaven and earth at his disposing,
with all the rich treasures and joyful pleasures contained in them, in the
assurance whereof, our Savior tells us, that we have much more cause to
rejoice, Luke 10. 20. 1. Pet. 1. 8.
then in the gift of miracles, or that the foul spirits are subdued unto us?

. Sect. 3 That God watches over the godly with his special providence; and the
benefits of this privilege.
The second privilege which God vouchsafes unto all those that lead a godly
life, is, that loving them with this fatherly love, he watches over them with
his providence, to confer upon them all manner of good. For howsoever all
things in heaven and earth are subject to this all-seeing and all-ruling
providence, yet after a more special manner he watches over those that fear
him, as his own peculiar people; and though his power and presence extend to
all the world, like the power of a King unto his whole Dominions, yet he is
hereby chiefly beneficial to those that fear and serve him, as being of his
own family, yea his adopted children in Jesus Christ. Thus the Psalmist says,
that the eyes of the Lord are upon the Psalm. 34. 15. and 33. 18.
righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. And again, The eyes of the
Lord are upon them that fear him; And as Elihu speaks, He withdraws Job
36. 7.
not his eyes from them. So David in another place; The Lord knows the Psalm.
37. 18.
days of the upright, and their inheritance shall be for ever. Yea, but the
eyes of the Lord are upon all things, and there is nothing so secret, that is
unknown unto him; and what privilege then have those herein that serve him,
above those that serve him not? It consists not in the general view, and
notice which God takes of one thing as well as of another; but in that he has
a more watchful and benign eye over those that fear him, to preserve them
from all evil, and to bestow upon them all that is good; by reason whereof
they are so far from miscarrying by any chance and casualtie, any malice or
fury of their enemies, that not so much as an hair Mat. 10. 30.
can fall from their head without the will of their heavenly Father. In which
respect, the Lord compares himself to an Eagle, which safely carries her
Deuteronomy. 1. 31. and 30. 11.
young, and defends them from all other ravenous birds, when they are unable
to shift for themselves. And to a careful Shepherd, who not only Ezech. 34.
12.
keeps his Sheep from the Wolf, but also feeds them in green Pastures,
Psalm. 23. 1, 2, 3.
drives them to the still waters, cures the sick, and carries in his arms
the lame and weak, as David also shows by his own experience. And thus our
Savior called himself the good Shepherd, who watched Ioh. 10. 1, 2, etc.
over his Sheep with such love and care, that he was ready to lay down his
life for them, rather then they should perish by any danger. Now the benefits
which we have by this privilege, are many and inestimable. For by this
special providence, God, like a faithful Shepherd, leads us out and in, and
directs us in all our courses, guides us in the ways of his Esa. 30. 21.
Commandments, and keeps us from wandering in the bypath of error, and
from losing our selves in the deserts of sin. And thus the Psalmist says,
that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delights Psalm.
37. 23.
in his way; whereby he is kept from falling into many sins, unto which he
is prone through natural corruption, and wherewith others, that are not thus
guided and governed, are often and easily overtaken; and also into many dangers
and evils, to which their frail lives are subject, whereinto others not thus
directed, do rush and perish in them. Secondly, by this special providence,
those that serve the Lord, are preserved from all evils, and protected against
all enemies; and that not after a slight and ordinary manner, but with such
vigilant care and tenderness, as a man watches over the apple of his eye, as
the Lord professes, and Zach. 2. 8. Psalm. 17. 8.
David also found by his own experience. The which, though it be
allsufficient to preserve us from all danger of evil, yet for our greater
comfort, and the better confirming of communion and love between his holy
Spirits and us, he causes his Angels to incampe round about those that Psalm.
34. 7.
fear him, and delivers them; yea, he commits them unto them, as their
special charge, to keep them in all their ways, and to bear them in their
hands, that they dash not their foot against a stone. Of which, we have many
examples; as of the three children thus preserved in the fiery furnace; and
Dan. 3. 25. and 6. 22.
Daniel in the Lions den; and in that mighty Army of holy Spirits, sent for the
comfort and encouragement of Elizeus servant. Thirdly, by this 2. King. 6. 17.
special providence, God both vpholdeth his children that serve him, when they
are ready to fall into sin and danger, and raises them up being fallen;
preserves them from troubles and afflictions, and delivers them out of them
when they call upon him. For he covers them with his Psalm. 91. 4, 5, 6, etc.
feathers, and under his wings they shall be safe, his truth shall be their
shield and buckler, etc. The eyes of the Lord are upon those that fear him, to
deliver their Psalm. 33. 18, 19.
soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. In which regard, the Lord
incourageth his servants against all dangers; Fear thou not, for I am Esa. 41.
10.
with thee: be not dismayed: for I am thy God; I will strengthen thee, yea, I
will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my
righteousness, etc. Or if for their chastisement they be afflicted and foiled
with any evil, either of sin or punishment, yet they shall not be forsaken,
and suffered to lie and perish in it, and as the Psalmist speaks, Though they
fall, they Psalm. 37. 24.
shall not utterly be cast down, for the Lord vpholdeth them with his hand.
Yea, though many be the troubles of the righteous, yet the Lord delivers them
out of all; and though he beats them with his rods, yet he keeps all their
bones, Psalm. 34. 17, 18.
so that not one of them is broken. For the Lord vpholdeth them in their
integrity, Psalm. 41. 12.
and sets them always before his face, as David speaks out of his own
experience. Finally, as God by this special providence preserves those that
serve him, from all evil; so also he provides for them all that is good,
supplying all their wants, and relieuing them in all their necessities. For if
we trust in the Lord, and do good, we shall dwell in the Land, and Psalm. 37.
3, 4.
verily we shall be fed; if we delight our selves in the Lord, he will give us
the desires of our hearts. Which argument David uses, to move all unto Gods
fear: O fear the Lord (says he) ye his Saints, for there is no want to them
that Psalm. 34. 9, 10.
fear him. The young Lions lack and suffer hunger, but they that fear the
Lord, shall not want any good thing. Now what greater privilege, then to be
thus at Gods finding? to have him our guide to direct us, our King to govern
and defend us; our loving Father, and careful Shepherd, to feed us, and
supply all our wants; to preserve us from dangers, and deliver us out of all
our troubles; to heal our wounds, and cure our diseases: seeing he beholds
all our wants, and is all-sufficient to supply them? What stronger motive then
this, to move us wholly to deuote our selves unto his service, in whom we live,
and move, and have our being, seeing our Act. 17 28.
frail lives are liable to so many evils, both of sin and punishment,
obnoxious to so many dangers, and stand in need of so many helps and comforts,
that if the Lord should but for the least moment withdraw his hand, and cast us
from under the protection of his wise and powerful providence, we should
utterly perish and come to nothing?

. Sect. 4 That he guides and governs the godly with his grace and holy
Spirit: 1. In their prosperity.
The third privilege which the Lord vouchsafes unto the godly, is, that he so
guides and governs them by his grace and holy Spirit, that they make a right
use of all estates, both of prosperity and adversity, and turn all things
which happen unto them by the Divine providence, to their spiritual good, the
enriching of their souls with all saving graces, and the furthering and
assuring of their eternal salvation. For whereas wicked men, inioying worldly
prosperity, do stand in slippery places, their table becoming a snare unto
them, and their honors, riches and pleasures, the baits of sin, which make
them to fall into the devils nets of perdition (for their honors nourish and
increase their ambition, their riches serve as sweet drinks, to make them
thirst the more, and increase their swelling dropsy of covetous desires, their
pleasures make them more sensual and voluptuous, and all together work in
them pride, and forgetfulness of God, carnal self-love, and love of the
world, affiance in earthly vanities, and contempt of spiritual and heavenly
things) The Lord preserves those that fear and serve him, from falling into
these tentations, by moderating their desires, and mortifying their carnal
concupiscence, so as they do not excessiuely affect these worldly vanities,
nor dote upon them when they have them, but use them only as helps and
comforts of their pilgrimage, and not set their hearts upon them as their
Paradise, and the rewards of their Country, because they know them to be vain
and uncertain, both in their getting and keeping; momentany and mutable, being
every day ready to leave us, or we them. Their honors do not puff them up in
pride, but make them the more humble, seeing they possess them not as their
own proprieties, but as Gods Talent, whereof one day they must give a
reckoning; as we see in the example of David, who though he were advanced from
a low estate to a Kingdom, yet professes, that his heart was not haughty,
nor his eyes Psalm. 131. 1, 2.
lofty, but that he behaved himself in all meekness and mildness, as a child
weaned of his mother. Their riches do not withdraw their hearts from God,
though they abound in them, neither do they trust in them, because they know
them to be uncertain, but in the everliving God, who gives them 1. Tim. 6. 17.
richly all things to enjoy; as we see in the example of Job, who though he
Job 31. 24.
were the wealthiest man in all the East, yet he did not make gold his hope,
Job. 31. 24.
nor said unto the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; nor rejoiced, because his
wealth was great, nor because his hand had gotten much. But only they use them
as the great instruments of well doing, and as means to enable them to
exercise themselves in the works of mercy, according to Jobs example, who
being rich and able to do good, did not withhold from the Job 31. 16, 17, 19.
poor their desire, nor caused the eyes of the widow to fail, nor did eat
his morsels alone, but did let the fatherless eat thereof, nor would see any
perish for want of clothing, nor the poor to lie without a covering. Their
pleasures, though as great as they enjoy, who have eminent places in Kings
Courts, do not, like intoxicating cups, bewitch them, and make them so drunk,
that they forget the joys of heaven, unto which they aspire, but even when
they have drunk the deepest draught of them, they can (with Solomon) say of
them, that all is vanity and vexation of spirit, and that there is no profit
Eccles. 2. 11.
under the Sun. And when they are put to their choice, so as they must of
necessity leave the one, to embrace the other, they will, with Moses, have such
respect to the recompense of their heavenly reward, that they will choose rather
Heb. 11. 25, 26.
to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of
sin for a season. Finally, though with the Patriarchs they abound with Gods
blessings, yet they will not fix their hearts upon them, because here they
Heb. 13. 14. and 11. 10.
have no continuing City, but they seek one to come, which has foundations,
whose builder and maker is God; and therefore like the Workman, is permanent
and everlasting. Now what a privilege is this, to be vpheld in such slippery
places, in which, all that are left to themselves, do fearfully fall? to have
antidotes against these dangerous drinks, wherewith all that want them, are
poisoned? to be made more humble, mindful of God, and thankful unto him by
these worldly things, which make the most proud, forgetful and ungrateful?
Finally, to have such a right use of all these earthly and temporary blessings,
that they become unto us pledges of Gods love, and earnest pennies of eternal
happiness, and so to enjoy both earth and heaven, all the comforts of this
life, as helps and furtherances to assure us of the glory and joys of the
life to come? Of which, seeing none but the godly are partakers, what a strong
motive should it be to persuade us unto the service of God in an holy life?

. Sect. 5 Secondly, he guides the godly in the time of their afflictions.
In respect also of the afflictions of this present life, godliness has no
less privileges. For first, they which carefully serve and please God, are
wholly 1. Pet. 2. 24. Col. 2. 14. Gal. 3. 13.
delivered from the^, as they are punishments of sin to satisfy Gods Justice,
because Christ has in their stead satisfied for them, and paid their debt to
the uttermost farthing, and by taking away their sins through his death and
sufferings, has also cancelled the handwriting which was against them, freed
them from the curse of the Law, and all the punishments which were due unto
them. Secondly, by leading of a godly life, we are freed from afflictions in
the greatest part, as they are the corrections of Gods children. For howsoever
sometimes the chief end, at which God aims in afflicting the godly, is the
trial of those graces which he has given them, that being approved, he may
be glorified that gave them, and Jam. 1. 12.
his gifts crowned in those that have received them; yet for the most part,
sin being the occasion, even of these trials, and the cause of other crosses,
according to that in the Lamentations; Wherefore does a living Lam. 3. 39.
man complain, a man suffers for his sins? Hereof it follows, that we
may escape these afflictions, if we carefully flee sin, and serve the Lord in
the duties of a godly life. For though the Lord judges his children 1. Cor.
11. 32.
in this life, that they may not be condemned in the life to come; yet it is
not as they are innocents (for the^ they should never come into judgment) but
as offenders, who by their sins and negligence in his service, have deserved
these, and far greater punishments. Though he chastizeth every Heb. 12. 6, 7.
son whom he receives, yet not being faultlesse, but when by their sins they
have displeased him, that he may bring them to repentance and amendment. And
therefore he prescribes this repentance as a means to prevent his
corrections, seeing, by reason of natural frailty and corruption, we cannot be
wholly innocent: As many as I love, I rebuke and chastize; Apoc. 3. 19.
be zealous therefore and amend. Though he make afflictions to serve for
sovereign salues to his Children, yet he would not apply them to the whole
skin, and sound flesh, but because they have sores which need to be cured,
being so festered, that the balm of his benefits will not heal them. Finally,
when by afflictions he weaneth them from the love of the world, it presupposes
that they dote too much upon it, and argues, that if, as they ought, they did
loathe and contemn it, in comparison of spiritual graces, and heavenly glory,
they should not have it imbittered unto them: For what mother would rub her
teat with mustard, or wormwood, to weane her child, if he had wit and will to
leave it in due time? So that if we would carefully flee sin, and please our
heavenly Father, by doing our duty, we should not need to fear stripes, but
should be continually cherished and encouraged with rewards. If we would not
surfeit of sin and wound our consciences, we should not be troubled with the
bitter medicine, and sharp and searching salve. But we might, with comfort and
assurance, apply Gods promises of preservation, both from outward and inward
afflictions, even when they are most rife in the world, and seize upon others
round about us, according to that of Eliphaz to Job, He shall deliver thee in
six troubles, yea in seven there shall no evil touch Job 5. 19. Psalm. 32. 10.
and 91. 3, 4. Pro. 3. 21, 22, 23, 24.
thee. And that of the Psalmist, Many sorrows shall be to the wicked, but he
that trusts in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about. Thirdly, if by our
sins we have brought afflictions upon us, yet walking before God in our
ordinary course, after an holy manner, we shall have hereby this privilege,
that those afflictions which are pernicious unto others, both in respect of
their souls and bodies, shall not be able to do them any harm. Or though,
like the Serpent, they bite them by the heel, and cause some temporary smart,
yet being armed with the breast plate of righteousness, they shall not hurt
their vital parts, nor any whit hinder them of everlasting happiness. Yea
contrariwise, through the good blessing of God, and assistance of his holy
Spirit, sanctifying them to their use, they, with all other things, shall work
together for their good, by drawing them nearer unto Romans 8. 28.
God, through unfeigned repentance, by mortifying their sins, weaning them
from the world, strengthening them in all grace, and by being unto them
infallible signs of Gods love, and their adoption. In all which, and
innumerable other respects, they may conclude (not from the sense and smart of
their afflictions, which, as the Apostle speaks, seem not Heb. 12. 11.
joyous, but grievous) but from the fruits of righteousness, which spring from
them; that it is good for them that they have been afflicted, that they might
Psalm. 119. 71. Lam. 3. 27.
learn Gods Statutes; and that it is good for a man that he bear the yoke
from his youth: yea, that they are blessed whom the Lord chasteneth, and
teaches Psalm.
them out of his Law. Finally, by leading of a godly life, we have this
privilege in respect of our afflictions, that we shall have seasonable
deliverance out of them, when as it shall be most fitting, both for Gods glory,
and our own spiritual and everlasting good. For as the Wise man says, The
righteousness of the upright shall deliver him, but transgressors shall Pro.
11. 8.
be taken in their naughtiness. So the Psalmist says, that many are the
troubles Psalm. 34, 17, 19.
of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of all. For, When the
righteous cry, the Lord hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles:
according to his gracious promise, Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will
Psalm. 50. 15.
deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me. And therefore this also should
effectually move us unto the duties of a godly life, feeing hereby all
estates are sanctified unto us, and even afflictions themselves are turned to
our good, which in their own nature are the punishments of sin. For seeing
through our intemperate lusts, we oftentimes surfeit of the pleasures of sin,
and thereby cast our selves in to many afflictions (as it were) dangerous
diseases, who would not esteem much of such a cordial, as will keep the
poison of the disease from the vital parts? yea, which will cause the
sickness it self to become a means of increasing and confirming our
spiritual health? But such a cordial is true godliness, which conuerteth
afflictions, which in their own nature are the diseases of our souls, and
states, caused by surfeiting upon sin, into notable helps and means for the
bettering of our spiritual estates, by making us to flee sin more carefully,
whereupon we have surfetted, and by confirming and increasing all Gods graces
in us.

. Sect. 6 That God inwardly guides the godly by his grace and holy Spirit.
The fourth privilege which the Lord bestows upon the godly, is, that as he
outwardly governs, defends and preserves them by his 1 Cor. ^. 16. and 6.
19.
wise and powerful providence; so he gives unto them an inward guide to
direct and rule them, to excite, uphold and strengthen them in all good
courses, to purge them from all their corruptions, and to enable them unto
every good work; even his own holy Spirit, and that not to visit them
sometimes by fits, but to dwell in them as in his temples, and to keep in
their souls and bodies continual residence, that he may be always ready to
direct and guide them in all their ways, to strengthen their weakness, and to
comfort their feeble hearts, that they may not faint in their Christian course.
And this the Lord promises to the faithful; I will put my Spirit within you,
and cause you to walk in my Statutes; and, Ye shall keep my Judgments and
do them. Neither does this Spirit come alone, but richly and royally attended
with a choice troop and train of all sanctifying and saving graces; as faith,
hope, charity, patience, humility, and a good conscience, with the rest, which
are of incomparable more value then the whole world, as bringing with them, for
the present, the greatest comfort and contentment, and being for the time to
come, earnest-pennies of everlasting joy and happiness. Nor does this holy
Spirit give us these graces in the first and least degrees only, but does
daily nourish and increase them in us, from one degree to another, till from
infancy to childhood, and from thence to youth, we Psalm. 92. 14, 15.
do at last grow up unto a perfect age in Christ, bringing forth most Ephesians. 4.
13.
fruit in our latter end. For being assisted and comforted by the Spirit, we
overcome all difficulties, and those duties which at the first seemed hard and
almost impossible, become familiar and pleasant; that yoke of Christ which at
first galled us, does not hurt Matthew. 11. 29.
us at all, when we are anointed with this oil, and his burden which seemed
intolerable, having this Companion to help and assist us, becomes light and
easy, yea, sweet and delightful. And so on the other side, when we submit
our selves to be guided and governed by the Spirit in the duties of a godly
life, and do not grieve it by quenching the good motions which it suggesteth
unto us, we cause the good Spirit of God to take pleasure in his habitation,
and to delight in us to do us good, multiplying and increasing his graces in
us, of which we have brought forth such good fruits, and redoubling our
talents, when as we have rightly used them to our Masters advantage; according
to that of our Savior; To him that has, shall be given, and he Matthew. 25. 29.
Luke 8. 18.
shall have abundance; and from him that has not, shall be taken even that
which he seems to have.

CAP. XLIIII.
Other singular privileges, wherewith God in this life crowns the godly,
which are the fruits and effects of his holy Spirit.

. Sect. 1 That God seals unto the godly, the assurance of their adoption.
THe fifth privilege peculiar to the godly, is the fruits and effects of the
Spirit, the first and chief whereof is this, that the Spirit witnesses and
seals in their hearts and consciences the assurance of their adoption,
whereby of the children of wrath and firebands of hell, they become the
children of God, and coheires with Jesus Christ of their heavenly Inheritance.
For as many Romans 8. 14, 15, 16.
as are led by the Spirit, they are the sons of God. For ye have not (says
the Apostle) received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have
received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba Father. The Spirit it
self bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. And
if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and ioynt-heires with Christ. And
again, Because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son
into Gal. 4. 6.
your hearts, crying Abba Father. So the Evangelist John says, that as many as
received Christ, to them he gave this privilege to become the sons of God,
Ioh. 1. 12.
even to them that believe on his name. So that whosoever lay hold upon Christ
by a true and lively faith, and bring forth the fruits thereof in holiness and
newness of life, thereby approving themselves to be such as are led by the
Spirit, they have this high and honorable privilege, that they are the sons
of God, and coheires with Christ in his Kingdom of glory. The which should be
a most effectual regument to persuade us to flee all manner of sin, that we may
not grieve the holy Spirit of God, whereby we are sealed unto the day of
Redemption, and to Ephesians. 4. 30.
lead a godly and Christian life, that we may walk worthy this high calling,
and approve our selves to be Gods children, by resembling our 1. Cor. 9. 25.
heavenly Father in holiness and righteousness. For if we would think no
pains too much in the service of an earthly King, if thereby we could be
assured, that he would adopt us for his sons, yea, make us heirs apparent to
his Crown and Kingdom, though corruptible and momentany; how diligent should
we be in serving and pleasing God, who has of his free grace assured all
those that fear and serve him, that they shall be his adopted sons, and
heirs of his incorruptible and glorious Kingdom, which shall have no end;
seeing this Crown brings no care with it, but all security, and such
surpassing joy and glory, as neither the eye has seen, the ear heard, nor
the 1. Cor. 2. 9.
heart of man can possibly conceive?

. Sect. 2 The second special privilege, is spiritual illumination.
The second special privilege and fruit of the Spirit, peculiar to the godly,
is, that he opens their eyes blinded with natural ignorance, Psalm. 119. 18.
Matthew. 11. 25. 1. Cor. 2. 14.
so as they see the wonderful things of Gods Law, and inlighteneth their dark
minds with supernatural, spiritual and heavenly Wisdom and prudence, so as
they not only conceive of the high and hidden mysteries of Gods Kingdom,
which the wisest of the world that are not thus illuminated, are not capable
of; but also in a saving manner are able to bring all they know to use, for
their spiritual direction in all the ways of godliness, which will bring
them to heavenly happiness. For it is the oil of the Spirit, wherewith our
eyes being anointed, do see and know all things. It is this comfortable 1.
Ioh. 2. 20, 27. Ioh. 14. 26.
Schoolmasters that teaches us all things, as our Savior speaks; without
whose instruction we remain ignorant of Gods will. For as no man knows the
things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him; 1. Cor. 2. 10, 11.
even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God. And
whatsoever God makes known unto us of his secret counsels, he reueyleth it
unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep
things Apoc. 3. 18.
of God. He is that spiritual eye-salue, wherewith Christ anoynteth our eyes
that we may see. It is he which by his secret whisperings (as it were) a voice
behind us, teaches us the way of salvation, saying, Esa. 31. 21.
This is the way, walk ye in it. But yet this voice is not heard of all, but
the faithful only, whose ears God has opened. This heavenly Light shines
not to all in all places, but only in Goshen to the true Israel of God, all
others still remaining in a more then Egyptian darkness; and to whomsoever it
appears, it teaches them to deny Tit. 2. 11, 12.
ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly and righteously, and godly
in this present world. This spiritual and divine Schoolmasters teaches not
all men; but those that truly fear God; according to that of the Psalmist,
The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach Psalm. 25. 12.
his way. And again, What man is he that fears the Lord? him shall he teach
in the way that he shall choose. And to such alone, who medirate in Psalm. 117.
99, 100.
his Testimonies, and keep his Precepts, he gives more wisdom and
understanding then to the ancient, or then to their teachers. The which should
be a powerful reason to move us unto the practice of all holy duties in a
godly life, seeing hereby we are assured of this spiritual illumination and
heavenly Wisdom, which is so high a privilege, that it far exceeds all
worldly treasures, in so much as he who best knew it, could not tell how to
value it, or to equal it with any price. Happy (says he) is the man that
finds wisdom, and the Pro. 3. 14, 15. and 8. 11, 19. and 16. 16.
man that gets understanding: for the merchandise thereof is better then the
merchandise of Silver, and the gain thereof then fine Gold. She is more
precious then Rubies, and all the things thou can desire, are not to be
compared unto her, etc. So Job, But where shall Wisdom be found? And where is
the Job 28. 12, 13. etc.
place of understanding? Man knows not the price thereof, neither is it found
in the Land of the living. It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver
be weighed for the price thereof. It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
with the precious Onix, and the Saphir, etc. And therefore if men think no
pains too much to obtain gold and precious treasures, how much more should
we labor without weariness for the getting of this Spiritual Wisdom, which
in true worth does so far exceed them? What care should we take to be in the
number of the godly, to whom this divine Light only shines? Yea, to be richly
stored with this treasure of godliness, wherein this heavenly Wisdom chiefly
consists? For the fear of the Lord is Wisdom; and to depart Job 28. 28.
from evil, is understanding. Or as the Psalmist speaks; The fear of Psalm.
111. 10. Pro. 9. 10.
the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom; a good understanding have all they that
do his commandments.

. Sect. 3 The third special privilege, is Sanctification by the Spirit.
The third special privilege bestowed upon the godly, is, that the Spirit of
God sanctifies them, changing and renewing their natures, from sinful
corruption, to sanctity and holiness. For it so inlighteneth their minds,
that they behold sin as it is in it own nature, most ugly and deformed, and
causes them to condemn it as the greatest evil. It works their wills,
hearts and affections to a loathing and detestation of it, so that they consent
not unto it, so far forth as they are renewed, even when the Law of their
members, warring Romans 7. 23.
against the Law of their minds, does lead them captive. Neither can they
sin, as in former times, with full consent of will, because it is in part
sanctified, nilling that which the flesh wills, in which regard the Apostle
John says, that he who is borne of God, sins not, for 1. Ioh. 3. 9.
his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he is borne of God. And
as being thus sanctified, they are inwardly kept from sin, in respect of the
love of it, and free and full consent unto it; so also from innumerable outward
acts of sin, into which others fall; partly, because they look more
carefully and conscionably to their ways, but especially, because the good
Spirit of God dwelling in them, quenches the fiery darts of Satan's tentations,
by his holy motions and monitions, Gal. 5. 17.
which oppose and fight against them, and so stays them when they are ready
to slip, and vpholdeth them when they are ready to fall. Yea, by renewing and
changing of our natures, it works in us, so far forth as we are sanctified,
an utter averseness to sin, and makes us spiritually to hate it as much as
ever we naturally loved it; so that it is no pain to us, nor any violence
offered unto our will, when we resist and flee from sin, as it is to the
wicked and unregenerate, who naturally drinking in iniquity as the Fish water,
are (as it were) tormented Job 15. 16.
with thirst, when they are forced to to forbear it. But though there were no
shame nor punishment to restrain them, no law to condemn them, nor heaven or
hell to reward or punish them, yet they would be a law to themselves, and with
all cheerfulness flee and forsake sin, out of that hatred and detestation
which they have conceived of it. And as they are thus preserved from sin; so
being quickened by the Spirit of God dwelling in them, they receive power and
spiritual strength, whereby they are enabled to do Gods will, and to serve
and please him in the duties of a godly life, and that not with that irksome
tediousness which the unregenerate feel in themselves, because Gods will and
theirs are opposite and contrary one to the other, but with cheerfulness and
delight, as the Angels in heaven, because their wills, being changed and
renewed, are conformed to the will of God, so that in doing his will, they do
their own, in which regard it is their meat and drink, when as with our
Savior they Ioh. 4. 34.
perform the will of their heavenly Father. Now what a singular privilege is
this, to be freed from the tyranny of sin and Satan, so as they have no
dominion over them, to rule and carry them which way they list, to their utter
ruin and destruction? To leave sin, not as wicked men, for fear of
punishment, though they love it better then the first borne of their bodies,
yea then their own lives, but out of mere Micah 6. 6.
hatred and detestation of it, because there is an auersenesse of their renewed
nature unto it? To yield obedience unto Gods Law, not out of terror and
constraint, but out of love and liking? To long and Psalm. 84. 2.
thirst in our souls after Gods presence, and the fruition of his holy
ordinances, and even to break with longing after Gods Judgments at all times,
Psalm. 119. 20.
that we may yield unto them that perfect obedience which he requires, and we
desire? To esteem sin the greatest bondage, and to complain most bitterly,
when we are led captive by it? Finally, to be freed from all burden and
wearisomenesse in our obedience, and to esteem Christ's yoke light and easy,
yea sweet and pleasant; seeing Gods glory and our salvation, our obedience and
eternal Psalm. 1. 1, 2. Luke 11. 28.
blessedness, are inseparably linked together? All which inestimable
privileges accompanying a godly life, may, as effectual reasons, move us to
embrace it.

. Sect. 4 The fourth special privilege, is internal and spiritual joy.
The fourth special privilege, which the Spirit of God brings to the godly,
is internal joy, which the Apostle numbr^^^ among the fruits of the Spirit,
and is a grace that arises out of our justification Gal. 5. 22.
and reconciliation with God, peace of conscience, and assurance of our
salvation, which cannot be crossed by any occurrent. The which joy far
exceeds all the joys of the world. For they satisfy not, but leave the soul
empty, so that the joy of one pleasure, does but stir up the appetite to
hunger after another, which if it should not be inioyed, leaves nothing but
sorrow behind; whereas this (as our Savior speaks) is a full joy, in the
fruition of God, partly, in sense and feeling, according John 15. 11.
to that of the Psalmist, O taste and see that the Lord is good! Psalm. 34. 8.
and partly, in the assurance of faith, which makes us rejoice in expectation
of full fruition. Worldly joy is short, and momentany, like the crackling of
thorns under a pot, which causes a sudden blaze, and as suddenly Eccles. 7.
6.
goes out: but the joy of the Spirit is lasting and permanent, and John. 16.
22.
no man (as our Savior says) can take it from us. That consists in eating and
drinking, and the inioying of such company as are like our selves; but this, in
the souls fruition of her beloved Spouse, whose love is Cant. 1. 2.
better then wine; seeing his favors are so full of rauishing delight, that
the heart is not able to contain them, as we see in the example of the Spouse
in the Canticles, who being brought by her Bridegroom into his banketing
house, was so filled, that she even surfeted of his delicacies, which forced
her to cry out, Stay me with flaggons: Comfort me with Cant. 2. 4, 5.
apples, for I am sick of love. Of which sweet and gracious entertainment of
the faithful soul, the Psalmist also speaks, They shall be abundantly
Psalm. 36. 8.
satisfied with the fatness of thy House, and thou shat make them drink of
the river of thy pleasures. Finally, the joy of worldlings accompanies their
prosperity; but when the evil day comes, it leaves and forsakes them, and
is turned into sorrow and grief of heart: but the godly rejoice even in their
tribulation and affliction, in their assurance of Gods love, and because they
know that they shall work together for their good, these light and momentany
afflictions causing unto them a far Romans 5. 3. Romans 8. 28. 2. Cor. 4. 17.
Iam. 1. 2.
most excellent and an eternal weight of glory. They account it all joy (as
the Apostle James speaks) when they fall into diverse tentations, knowing that
the trial of their faith works patience. And when they are persecuted for
righteousness sake, they being blessed in their sufferings, rejoice, Matthew. 5
10, 11
and are exceeding glad, because their reward is great in heaven. And thus the
Apostle says, that the Thessalonions received the Word in much affliction, 1.
These. 1. 6.
and with joy in the holy Ghost. And that the Hebrews took joyfully the
spoiling of their goods, knowing themselves, that they had in heaven a better,
and enduring substance. The which joy is a supernatural gift, and fruit of the
sanctifying Spirit, which all cannot attain unto, but the faithful only; and
therefore the Apostle prays for the Romans, that Romans 15. 13.
the God of hope would fill them with all joy and peace in believing, that they
might abound in hope through the power of the holy Ghost. It is a privilege
wherein wicked men have no portion, but is peculiar to the godly, in whom the
Kingdom of God is begun in this life, which none enjoy, but they Matthew. 6.
33.
which seek also his righteousness; seeing it consists not only in peace
Romans 14. 17.
and joy in the holy Ghost, but also in righteousness, as the Apostle
speaks: and therefore, seeing those things cannot be separated, which God
has conjoined, we must labor after righteousness, if we would be partakers of
this joy; unto which, if we do attain, we shall assuredly be filled with it.
For if the Apostle rejoiced in it, as in his Crown Phil. 4. 1. 1. These. 19. 20.
and joy, when he had been a means of converting others, and bringing them
into the way of truth and righteousness; and if the Apostle John rejoiced so
greatly, that he professes he had no greater joy in any outward Ioh. Epist. 2*
4. and Epist. 3. 3, 4.
thing, then when he saw his children walking in this way; then what
inestimable joy must this needs cause unto us, when our selves, by walking in
the way of holiness and righteousness, do attain unto the assurance of our
own happiness?

. Sect. 5 The last special privilege is Christian liberty.
The last special privilege peculiar unto the godly, which the Spirit
brings, is Christian liberty, whereby being freed out of the hands of all
Luke 1. 74.
our spiritual enemies, we serve the Lord in holiness and righteousness
without fear, and so attain unto the glorious liberty of the sons of God,
seeing his service is perfect freedom; and have power and dominion over all
the creatures, so as we may use them to all purposes, both for necessity and
comfort, having full right and interest in them by our adoption. The which
privilege also is a fruit of the Spirit, according to that of the Apostle,
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. And is derived unto 2. Cor.
3. 17.
us, when as the holy Ghost, by a lively faith applies unto us the virtue and
efficacy of Christ Jesus his death and satisfaction, whereby this liberty was
first purchased for us; in which respect, our Savior also challenges unto
himself this power and prerogative of setting us at liberty, as being our
alone Redeemer, who has delivered us out of the hands of all our spiritual
enemies; If (says he) the Son shall make you free, you shall be free Ioh. 8.
36.
indeed. We were subject to the wrath of God, but our Savior has freed Gal.
3. 13.
us from it, and by satisfying his Justice, has reconciled us unto him. We
were under the curse of the Law, but he has freed us, by being made a curse
for us. We were the wretched slaves of Satan, and in the state of death and
condemnation: but he by his death has destroyed him that had Heb. 2. 14, 15.
the power of death, that is, the devil, that he might deliver them, who
through the fear of death, were all their life time subject to bondage. We
were servants to the world, and the vassals of the earthly Mammon; but Christ
has overcome the world, both for himself and all his Elect, Ioh. 16. 33.
and so set us at liberty out of this thraldom. We were the servants of
sin, which made us slaves to all other enemies, and obeyed it in the wicked
lusts thereof: for as our Savior says, He that commits sin, Joh. 8. 34.
is the servant of sin; For his servants we are whom we obey, whether of
sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness. And though with the Romans
6. 16.
Jews we were ready to boast of our freedom, and (as it were) out of our
store, to promise liberty unto others, like those of whom the Apostle Peter
speaks, yet were we (like them) our selves, servants of 2. Pet. 2. 19.
corruption. For of whom a man is overcome, of the same he is brought in
bondage. Finally, we were slaves to our own sinful lusts, vile affections,
and turbulent passions, as wrath, pride, ambition, covetousness, and
voluptuousness, which were the most cruel Lords that ever tyrannized over
any, seeing they kept such a narrow watch over us, that they gave us not so
much as a breathing time of liberty, but forced us to drudge night and day, not
only in the sight of others, but when we were retired into the most secret
corners, because they held in miserable bondage our souls, as well as our
bodies, our judgments, wills, and affections, so as we liked and pleased our
selves in our thraldom, and had no desire to come out of it. But our Savior
has freed us from these enemies also, by mortifying our sins, and crucifying
our corruptions, by virtue of his death, applied unto us by his holy Spirit.
And lastly, we had no right to any of the creatures, having by sin lost our
dominion over them; but our Savior and his holy Spirit, by giving us the
liberties and privileges of sons, has restored us to our right, so that
they are all become good and pure unto us, being sanctified by the Word and 1.
Tim. 4. 4, 5. Tit. 1. 15.
prayer. But this royal privilege of Christian liberty belongs not to all,
but only to the faithful, who desire to serve and please God in the duties of
holiness and righteousness. Neither can we ever attain unto any assurance
that we have right and title unto it, till we feel it effectual in us for
our sanctification. For all those who are by Christ freed from Gods wrath, and
reconciled unto him, have hereby a desire wrought in them to serve and please
him, and will not willingly for any worldly hire provoke his displeasure. They
that are freed from the curse of the Law by the Cross of Christ, will crucify
their own lusts, and not run such a course, as will again make them
accursed. They that are delivered out of the hands of their spiritual enemies,
do worship and serve Luke 1. 74.
their Lord and Savior in holiness and righteousness, and being redeemed,
Tit. 2. 14.
that they may be his peculiar people, they become zealous of good works. They
that are freed from sin, in respect of the guilt and punishment, are also in
some measure freed from the corruption of it, so as it does not Romans 6. 12.
reign and rule in their mortal bodies, that they should obey it in the lusts
thereof, but being freed from sin, they become the servants of
righteousness. The Verse. 19.
which should be a forcible argument to move us unto the duties of a godly
life, seeing hereby we may be assured of this royal privilege of Christian
liberty, according to that of our Savior; If ye continue in my Ioh. 8. 31, 32.
Word, then are ye my Disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free. Whereas if we neglect them, and still live in
sin, yielding obedience unto our own carnal lusts; we lose the benefit and
comfort of this privilege, and have just cause to fear, that as yet we
remain in that miserable bondage of the devil, the world, and our own lusts.

CAP. XLV.
Of four other main privileges, wherewith God crowns the godly, both in
this life and the life to come.

. Sect. 1 The sixth main privilege, is, that God bestows upon the godly the
spirit of prayer and supplication.
THe sixth main privilege which God vouchsafes to the godly, is, that he
bestows upon them the Spirit of prayer Zach. 12. 10. Romans 8. 26, 27.
and supplication, and both hears and grants all the suites which they make
unto him. For he powers upon the house of David, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and supplication, as he has promised; and
whereas naturally we know not how to pray, nor what to pray for as we ought,
the Spirit helps our infirmities, and makes intercession for us with
gronings which cannot be uttered. And he that searches the hearts, knows
what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the Saints,
according to the will of God. Yea, he not only by his Spirit teaches us how
to pray, and what to ask, but has also bound himself by his gracious and
free promises, that he will hear all our suites made in the name of his
Son, and indicted by his Spirit, according to that of our Savior; Ask, and
you shall have; seek, and you shall Mat. 7 7. Job. 16. 23. 1. Ioh. 5. 14, 15.
Psalm. 50. 15.
find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. And again, Verily, verily I
say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it
you. Now what an high and holy privilege is this, to have always free access
unto God in all our wants and necessities, who is alone able to help us, and
will also do it because of his promise? To have a dear and able friend, into
whose bosom we may with boldness and comfort power out all our complaints,
who is ready to pity and ease us? To have a key always in our keeping, which
through Christ will open unto us the treasury of Gods graces, where we may
relieve our wants, and store our selves with all things needful for his glory,
and our own spiritual good and everlasting salvation. Finally, to converse
with the supreme and glorious King of heaven and earth in a familiar manner,
and to talk with him, as a man talks with his friend? For as the Lord
speaks to the Israelites, What nation is so great, who has God so nigh unto
them, as the Lord Deuteronomy. 4. 7.
our God is in all things that we call upon him for? But this privilege is
peculiar unto them who serve the Lord, by observing his will, according to that
of our Savior; If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask what Job.
15. 7.
you will, and it shall be done unto you; and not unto wicked men, who turn
Pro. 15. 8.
away their ear from hearing the Law, and neglect the duties of Gods service,
whose sacrifices and prayers are abominable (as before I have showed) and 28. 9.
and shall not be heard or granted of God, as he tells the rebellious
Jews; When you spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you, yea,
Psa. 1. 15. Pro. 1. 28. Zach. 7. 11, 12, 13.
when you make many prayers, I will not hear. And therefore let this also
effectually move us to serve the Lord in the duties of a godly life, that we
may be partakers of this rich and royal privilege, having not only the
Spirit of God as our Counselor, to draw all our suites and Petitions in such
manner and form as is agreeable to Gods will, and Christ our Advocate and
Master of Requests, to prefer them unto God in our behalf, not pleading our
deserts, but his own merits and his Fathers promises; but also this high Court
of Requests night and day open unto v^, that in all our necessities we may
make our suites and supplications known unto God, with confidence and
assurance that they shall be heard and granted.

. Sect. 2 The seventh maine privilege, is, that God grants unto them the
means to build them up in grace unto salvation.
The seventh privilege peculiar to the godly, is, that God grants unto them
the means to build them up in grace, and to bring them to salvation, with
hearts to use them, and the inward assistance of his holy Spirit, whereby they
become profitable and effectual to their ends. The which is to be understood,
first, of the public means, as hearing the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer,
which the most in the world have not at all, but those only that live in the
Church, of which the fewest, and least number enjoy them to their use and
benefit, either because they neglect and contemn them, or use them after a
cold, careless and formal manner, without any desire and endeavor to profit
by them, wanting in themselves faith, and a good conscience, and also the
inward cooperation of Esa. 6. 9.
Gods holy Spirit, to bless and sanctify them to their use. By reason whereof
it comes to pass, that after they have long been partakers of Gods holy
^dinances, they are never the better, but remain as ignorant and full of
^fidelity, as impenitent and unprofitable as they were at the first; yea in
^uth much the worse, seeing for want of faith and preparation, the pr^ching of
the Word, which is in it own nature, Gods strong Math. 11. 21. Romans 1. 16.
power to their salvation, and the savor of life unto life, becomes unto
them the sa^ur of death, to their deeper condemnation; and the Sacrament, 2.
Cor. 2. 16. 1. Cor. 11. 29.
which is the ^ale of salvation, through their unworthy receiving of it,
seals unto ^em judgment and condemnation; yea even their prayers themselves
a^ turned into sin, whilst they know not how to pray as they ought, ^th
faith and feruency, in spirit and truth, but draw near unto Esa. 29. 13.
God with th^r lips only, when as their hearts are far from him: whereas
unto the god^, they are great and inestimable privileges, because the Lord by
his S^irit stirs up their appetite to hunger and thirst after Psalm. 42. 1, 2.
them, and giu^th grace to use them aright, after that manner as has before
been she^ed, mixing faith with them, whereby they become profitable, Heb. 4. 2.
and that ^ot only a justifying faith, without which it is impossible to Heb.
11. 6.
please God, but ^ special faith or branch of the other, whereby they use Gods
holy or^ances without doubting, assuring themselves that he will, according ^o
his gracious promise, accompany their diligent, careful Iam. 1. 6.
and conscio^able use of the outward means, with the inward operation of his
holy spirit, and make them effectual for the enriching of their souls with
all ^pirituall and sanctifying graces, and the furthering of their everlasting
salvation. And secondly, the godly have this privilege more peculiar unto
themselves, in respect of the private means before spoken of; as
wat^hfulnesse, meditation, examination of themselves, private prayer, and the
rest, seeing scarce any but they use them; or if they do, slightly, coldly,
and to no purpose: whereas God gives them grace to use them aright, and with
an earnest desire to profit by them; the which he also satisfies, whilst by
the inward assistance of his holy Spirit, he makes them powerful and
effectual for their spiritual nourishment, and the enriching of their souls
with all sanctifying and saving graces. And this also may be an effectual
reason to move us to godliness, that we may enjoy these great privileges, and
not only have and use them with others, but also have them blessed and
sanctified by Gods Spirit, that they may become profitable and effectual to
our salvation, without which, our nourishment it self will turn to poison,
and Gods holy ordinances, which are the means of life and happiness, being
abused by us for want of grace and godliness, will but harden us in our
sins, and so increase our condemnation and punishment.

. Sect. 3 The eighth maine privilege i* that they shall persevere in the state
of grace unto salvation.
The eighth privilege peculiar to the godly, is, that they shall persevere in
the state of grace and salvation unto the end; and howsoever, through the
violence of the tentations of their spiritual enemies, and their own frailty
and corruption, they have many slips and falls, yet they shall never fall away;
and though they err sometimes out of the way of righteousness, into the
by-ways of sin, yet they return into it again by unfeigned repentance, and
redeem this lost time with more then ordinary diligence in Gods service. So
that though there may be, and are some ill premises in their lives which truly
fear God, yet they always make a good conclusion; though they have many rubs
in the ^beay, yet at length they come safely to their iourneys end. And though
^hey have many faults and failings in their lives, yet they are always ble^d
in their death; according to that of the Psalmist; Mark the perfect ^n, and
behold Psalm. 37. 37.
the upright, for the end of that man is peace: and that of the Preacher,
Though a sinner do ill an hundred times, and his days be prolong^d, yet
surely I know, it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before
him. The which their perseverance in the state of grace unto the end, ^ not
grounded upon themselves, or the strength of the graces which ^ey have received
(for then it were but a poor privilege, which would every day be subject to
losing) but upon the power and promises of G^d, his Nature and Attributes, the
Intercession of Christ, and the virtue of his holy Spirit assisting and
strengthening them. For, It is God which ^stablisheth us 2. Cor. 1. 21.
in Christ. It is his strength, whereby we are enabled to stand ^st against all
Ephesians. 6. 10, 12.
the tentations of our spiritual enemies: it is his power, ^hereby we are 1.
Pet. 1. 4.
kept through faith unto salvation. And though we are able t^ do nothing of
our selves, yet we can (with the Apostle) do all things, though the power Col.
3. 3.
of Christ, which strengthens us: neither is our spiritual lif^ in our own
custody, but it is hid with Christ in God, as the Apostle spe^keth. It stands
not upon the strength of our own free will, but of Gods will; and as our
Savior tells us, This is the Fathers will, that of ^ll which he had Ioh. 6.
39.
given him, he should not lose one, but should raise it up at the l^st Day. It
stands upon, not our resolution or love toward God, but upon his
unchangeable counsel and decree, which shall stand, who has not appointed 1.
These. 5. 9.
us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ; and upon his
love which is immutable and everlasting: for whom he lo^eth, to the end he
Jer. 31. 8.
loves them. Not upon our strength, but upon the power of God, who is more
mighty to save, then all our enemies to hurt and destroy us; so that Joh. 13. 1.
though we be weak, and unable to hold out, yet we shall be established; for
Romans 14* 4. 2. Tim. 1. 12.
God is able to make us stand, and to keep that which we have committed unto
him, against that great Day of Christ's appearing; for, he is greater then all,
and Ioh. 10. 28.
none is able to pull us out of his hand. Finally, it rests not upon the
truth of our promises made to God, but of his promises made to us, who is a
faithful and true witness, and all his promises in Christ, Yea and Amen. For
the Apoc. 1. 5. 2. Cor. 1. 20.
Lord has made his covenant with us, and promised, that he will put his Ier.
31. 31. and 33. 33. Esa. 59. 21. Ier. 32. 40.
Law in our inward parts, and write it in our hearts, and will be our God, and
we shall be his people. That he will forgive our iniquity, and remember our
sins no more: that he will put his Spirit upon us, and that his words which
he has put into our mouths, shall not depart out of them, from henceforth
even for ever: and that he will make an everlasting Covenant with us, and not
turn away from us to do us good, but will put his fear into our hearts, so
as we shall not depart from him. That though we fall, we shall not be cast off,
because the Lord puts Psalm. 37. 24. Psalm. 112. 6, 9.
under his hand. That our righteousness shall remain for ever, and that we
shall never be moved, but shall be had in everlasting remembrance. The which
Covenant and promises of God are most immutable and unchangeable. For the
Mountains shall depart, and the Hills shall be removed, but Gods kindness
shall not depart from us, neither shall the Covenant of his peace be removed.
Esa. 54. 10.
Yea, it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, then one tittle of his Word
to fail. Luke 16. 17.
The which may serve as a forcible argument to persuade us to serve the Lord in
the duties of a godly life; seeing when we are once entered into it, we shall
be sure to hold out in our Christian course unto salvation, notwithstanding our
own frailty and corruption, the many and great difficulties which we find in
the way, and the might and malice of all our spiritual enemies; for he that
has begun this good work of grace in us, is able and Phil. 1. 6.
willing to perfect it unto the end. The which argument, taken from the
infallibility of Gods counsel, ordaining us to salvation, the Apostle uses to
withold us from all sin; The foundation of God (says he) stands sure, 2.
Tim. 2. 19.
and the Lord knows them that are his. And let every one that names the name
of Christ, depart from iniquity. Yea, that we might the better be encouraged
to forsake all sin, and to serve God in holiness and righteousness, he has
not kept this royal and inestimable privilege of our perseverance in grace
unto salvation, as a secret to himself, but has so plainly revealed it in his
Word, that we may take notice and be assured of it, according to that of the
Apostle; These things have I written unto 1. Joh. 5. 13.
you who believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that he has
eternal life. To the end that thereby our hearts may be replenished with
gladness, and we encouraged to hold on in our course with joy, seeing though
we have many lets and mighty oppositions in the way, yet we are sure that at
the last we shall come safely to our iourneys end.

. Sect. 4 The great and inestimable privileges wherewith God crowns a godly
life in the world to come.
And these, with many other, are the rich and royal privileges, wherewith God
in this world does reward and crown a godly life: which though they be great
and inestimable, yet are they all little, in comparison of that glorious
happiness, which God has reserved for those that love and serve him in the
world to come, being all but short preludes to that heavenly harmony, and small
earnest-pennies and first fruits of that maine bargain, and plentiful
harvest. For there we shall, both in our souls and bodies, be perfectly freed
from all miseries and evils both of sin and punishment, and all tears shall
be clean wiped from our eyes; and Apoc. 21. 4.
there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be
any more pain, as the holy Ghost speaks. And contrariwise, we shall there
in joy such honors, riches and joys, as neither the tongue can utter, nor the
heart conceive. For we shall inherit Mat. 25. 34.
a Kingdom, an and 7. 31.
heavenly Kingdom: yea, the Kingdom Act. 4. 22.
of God, which like himself, because it chiefly consists in the fruition of
himself, is most absolute and infinite in all perfection. There we shall be
crowned with a Iam. 1 12.
Crown of life, an 1. Cor. 9. 25.
incorruptible Crown, a 1. Pet. 5. 4.
Crown of glory. There we shall be perpetually feasted at the great feast and
Apoc. 19. 9.
marriage Supper of the Kings Son, where there shall be nothing but mirth and
gladness, plenty without want, and fullness without satiety. There we shall
rest from all our labors, and sanctify unto God a perpetual Sabbath,
continually singing praises unto him, who is the Author and Fountain of all
our happiness. There we shall swim in a river and torrent of pleasure, and
have fullness of joy at Gods Psalm. 36. 8. and 16. 11. 1. Cor. 15.
right hand for evermore. There we shall have spiritual bodies, that is, such
as shall be endued with spiritual and excellent qualities; as immortality and
agility, strength and impassibility, beauty and comeliness, brightness and
glory. There our souls shall be perfectly renewed according to Gods Image,
being endued with such wisdom and understanding, that we shall know God and
his will, our selves, and all the secrets and mysteries Ephesians. 5. 27.
both of nature and grace; and with such complete holiness and righteousness,
that there shall be neither spot nor wrinkle in them. There we shall have the
blessed and glorious society of all the holy Saints and blessed Angels, and
perfectly loving them as our selves, we shall rejoice in their happiness, as
much as in our own, whereby our joys shall be, according to their innumerable
number, multiplied and increased. There we shall enjoy the company of our
Savior Christ himself in his perfect glory; and that which shall be the top
and perfection of all our happiness, we shall have the vision and fruition of
God himself, the Father, Son and holy Spirit, who being infinite in
goodness, glory, beauty, excellency, wisdom, power and all perfection, will
be the full consummation of all our joy and happiness; which blessed estate we
shall enjoy, not for a thousand, or many thousand millions of years, but these
pleasures shall last for evermore, Psalm. 16. 11.
and of this Kingdom there shall be no end. All which points I do here Ioh.
6. 51. 1. Pet. 1. 4.
but briefly touch, having entreated of them at large in another place. Only
let us here take notice, that this rich privilege and incomparable Christian
Warfare. The 2. part. lib. 3. cap. 3. 4, etc. Romans 6. 23.
happiness belongs not to all or the greatest part of men, but is peculiar
to the faithful, who desire and endeavor to serve and please God in the duties
of a godly life: For though eternal life be the free gift of God, and he may
bestow it where he will, yet he gives it not unto any, whom he does not first
fit for it, induing them with grace, before he aduanceth them to glory, and
working holiness in them whom Heb. 12. 14.
he purposes to bring unto happiness; without which no man shall see God, as
the Apostle speaks. Though we are not saved and glorified for a godly life,
but for the merits and righteousness of Christ applied by faith, yet we are
not saved without it, seeing it is the way which leads us unto this place of
heavenly happiness, in which if we travail not, we can never come to the end
of our journey. It is a free inheritance, but yet given to none who have not
approved themselves the children of God, by resembling their Father in
holiness, Matthew. 25. 34.
and righteousness. It is not Wolves or Goats that must feed in this heavenly
pasture, but only the Sheep of Christ, who stand at his right Ioh. 10. 27.
hand: and none are in this number, but those which hear his voice and follow
him. And therefore the Apostle calls this heavenly happiness a Crown of
righteousness, not only because it was purchased by the righteousness 2. Tim.
4. 8.
and obedience of Christ, but also because it is given to none but the
righteous, and their righteousness (not by merit, but of grace) is crowned
with it. So he tells us, that we must first be freed from Romans 6. 22.
the service of sin, and become servants to God, bringing forth the fruits of
holiness, before we can attain unto that end of everlasting life. The which,
above all other reasons, should powerfully move us unto the duties of Gods
service in a godly life. For seeing, as the Apostle speaks, we expect to
receive a Kingdom, which cannot be moved, let us have Heb. 12. 18.
grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. And
so I will conclude this part of my Treatise, containing the arguments and
reasons, which may effectually persuade us to the leading of a godly life. And
now nothing remains, but that I entreat thee (Christian Reader) not slightly
to pass over what has been said, but that thou consider and weigh seriously
these reasons which I have produced. And if they convince thy Judgments (as
they must needs, if it be not wilfully blinded) that the godly life is most
happy and blessed; both in respect of Gods glory, and thy own benefit;
freedom from evil, and fruition of good; present comfort, and future hope; be
encouraged to go forward in this way with more diligence and greater speed, if
already thou walk in it; or be persuaded by them, if thou art not as yet
entered into this course of Christianity, now to resolve of a happy beginning,
leaving thine eager pursuit of worldly vanities; which, if nothing else, yet
miserable experience in the end will teach thee, to be not only unprofitable,
but (if thou prefer them in thy judgment, and love them in thine heart,
before spiritual and heavenly excellencies) hurtful and pernicious, and
betaking thy self unto a new course, endeavor to serve and please God
thorowout the whole remainder of thy days in the duties of a godly life. For
be thou well assured, that these reasons shall be powerful and effectual,
either to persuade thee, or to condemn thee, and shall serve as evidences of
truth to draw thee, unto God in the duties of holiness and righteousness, or
as evidences of terror to convince thee before God at the day of Judgment,
for thy wilful neglect and contempt of all means and motives, which in this
acceptable time and day of salvation he has graciously granted thee, to draw
thee by the way of Grace and godliness, into that his heavenly Kingdom, full
of glory and happiness.

THE SIXTH AND LAST BOOK OF A GODLY LIFE, ENTREATING OF THE IMPEdiments which
usually hinder and discourage men from entering into, and proceeding in the
Christian duties which are required unto it, and of the helps and means
whereby they may be removed.
CAP. I.
Of those impediments which are cast into our way, to hinder us in the duties
of a godly life, by Satan the Arch-enemie of our salvation.

. Sect. 1 That Satan bends all his forces against us, to hinder us in the
duties of a godly life.
Having spoken of the duties of a godly life, and of the means whereby we may
be enabled to perform them; it now follows, according to the order which we
have propounded in the beginning of this Treatise, that we in the last place
set down the impediments, which usually hinder us from entering into this
Christian course, and from proceeding, when we have resolved to begin and go
forward in it. For as there is nothing excellent and of great moment, wherein
we meet not with some mighty opposition and notable hindrances, which, if we
be not well armed and prepared, will discourage us from attempting it, or
disable us in atchieuing it: so nothing in the world finds more lets and
discouragements, then our entrance into the course of Christianity, and our
progress in the ways of godliness. For whereas all the promises of this
life, and the life to come, do infallibly belong unto all those who serve the
Lord in the duties of holiness and righteousness (from whence there arises
an impossibility that they should miscarry, who conscionably perform them, or
not attain unto everlasting happiness, who walk constantly in the way that
leads unto it) hereof it is, that the enemies of our salvation bend all their
might and malice, to keep us from entering into this way, or to divert us out
of it, if we have already begun to run this race. These enemies are the
devil (who is the chief and principal) the world and the flesh, which are
his two chief captains that under their conduct lead all his forces. How
mighty and dangerous these enemies are, I have Christian Warfare.
showed at large in another place; only let it here suffice to know, that the
great red Dragon, as he is ready to spit out his venom against us at all times
and upon all occasions, that he may show his malice and spite against God by
seeking our destruction, who were created according to his Image; so he
disgorgeth against us whole floods of hellish poison, when we set our selves to
serve God in the duties of a godly life, that he may, by making our ways
slippery, cause us to fall. And though he suffer us quietly to go on in our
own ways which lead to perdition, without stop or check, yea labors
all he can to make them easy and pleasant to our corrupt flesh; yet when we
set our face toward the heavenly Canaan, he pursues us with all malice and
fury, encountreth us with an huge host of hellish tentations, and stops our
course with innumerable impediments and discouragements, which he casts in
our way, that we may return again into the Egyptian slavery, and glut our
selves with sensual and sinful pleasures. Yea, no sooner do we conceive a
good thought or godly motion, but he watches us that he may take al
opportunities of killing it in the womb, and to make it an abortiue Apoc. 12.
4.
birth, or of strangling it as soon as it is borne and sees the light, that
so he may disharten us by many discouragements, from proceeding in well doing.
Let us know, that as he is a malicious Dragon, so a strong and mighty Lion,
who still stands in our way, armed with sufficient power to destroy and
devour us, if we were left to his fury. That he is a crafty old Serpent,
excelling in natural subtilty, and through long and great experience, able by
a thousand cunning devices to supplant and stop us in the ways of godliness,
being well able through his deep policy, to use and employ all his forces for
his best advantage. Finally, that he is most vigilant and never sleeps, most
diligent and never rests, but night and day goes about seeking to devour
us, by enticing 1. Pet. 5. 8.
us to come within the reach of his cruel paws, whilst we wander and go
astray out of the ways of Godliness, and so are out of the protection of our
great and gracious Shepherd.

. Sect. 2 How we may remove the former impediments.
But that this may not discourage us from entering into, and proceeding in the
ways of godliness, let us consider, that whilst we study and endeavor to
serve and please God in all holy and Christian duties, we are in his grace and
favor, and under his protection, and having him on our side, we need not to
fear, though Satan and all the power of hell bandy themselves against us. And
therefore let us encourage our selves against the malice of the devil, by
setting against it Gods infinite and inestimable love toward all that fear
and serve Romans 8. 31.
him, which is more powerful to save and defend us, then Satan's malice to hurt
and destroy us. Let us remember, that the Lord has loved Ier. 31. 3.
us with an everlasting love, yea so loved us, that he has given unto us his
only begotten and dearly beloved Son to the death, that we thereby Ioh. 3. 16.
might attain to life and happiness. That he thus loved us when we Romans 5.
8, 10.
were strangers and enemies, and out of this inestimable love redeemed us out
of the hands of all our spiritual enemies, that we might serve him in
holiness and righteousness, and therefore much more will this love move him to
save and deliver us from their malice and fury, when we have wholly consecrated
our selves to his worship and service. That this love makes him so jealous of
our safety, that he who touches us, Zach. 2. 8.
touches the apple of his eye; and therefore as well will he suffer Satan's
malice to impeach his own Majesty, as to hurt us who are so dear unto him.
And though he has such a spite and spleen against us, that he wills and
desires above all things, that God might be dishonored in our destruction,
yet let us cheerfully go on in the ways of godliness, seeing Gods Almighty
and All-ruling will opposes and ouerswayeth his, and with no less
earnestness seeks our preservation and salvation. According to that of our
Savior; This is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the
Son, and believes on him, Joh. 6. 40.
may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

. Sect. 3 That Satan's might and malice compared with our weakness and
simplicity, must not discourage us, and the reasons hereof.
Neither let Satan's power consisting in his might and strength, and in his
craft and policy, compared with our weakness and simplicity, discourage us
from serving God in the duties of holiness and righteousness. But when we
have set our faces toward the heavenly Canaan, and are travailing unto it in
the ways of godliness, though we see mountainous difficulties, impossible in
respect of our own strength to be ouerpassed, on either hand, a sea of
troubles and dangers before us, and an huge host of spiritual enemies armed at
all points with hellish tentations, pursuing us at our backs; let us go on in
our course without dread, seeing those which are on our side are more, and more
mighty, then those which are against us. And first, when we see our own wants
and weaknesses opposed with such malicious might and hellish fury, let not
this dismay us, seeing it is a great part of our strength to see our
weakness, and we are best armed, when we see, acknowledge and bewail our
own nakedness. For this will make us more careful to provide and put on the
sprituall Armor, especially the shield of faith, and the sword of the Spirit,
whereby we shall be enabled to quench the fiery darts of the wicked one, and
to stand fast and Ephesians. 6. 16.
firm against all his tentations in the evil day, wherewith if we be
thoroughly armed, we can never be foiled. Or if through our frailties and
infirmities, we find herein many wants and imperfections, this must not
discourage us, seeing our armor has not so much sufficiency to defend us in
its own strength, as from the Author that made it, and gave it for our use, who
being Almighty, to make good his own work, and to be of high proof against
all tentations, will never suffer those to be vanquished, who are of his
arming, but will manifest his power in their infirmities, and glorify himself
in their victory. Again, the sight and sense of our weakness, and our
enemies power, must not so dismay us, as that we should desist in our course,
but drive us unto the God of our strength, crying with Moses unto him for help
and deliverance, when we are pursued by our spiritual enemies. Exodus 14. 15.
And acknowledging with Asa our own impotency to resist them, 2. Chro. 14. 11.
let us make it our ground, to implore Gods help. Let us be as children in
the hand of our heavenly Father, and the more we find and feel our own
weakness and pronenesse to fall, let us take so much the surer hold of him by
a lively faith, and implore his help with the more feruency, who is able and
willing to support us, and by the assistance of his holy Spirit to do all our
works for us, as the Prophet Esa. 26. 12.
speaks. Finally, when we are most weak in our selves, this is no hinderance
unto us, but that we may be so strong in the Lord and in Ephe. 6. 10.
the power of his might, as that we may be able to withstand and overcome all
Satan's tentations, whereby he labors to hinder us in the ways of
godliness. For though this strong armed man is able to keep in safety all
that he possesses, against weaker opposition, yet God, who is stronger then
he, is able to disarme him, and to set us at Luke 11. 22.
liberty from under his tyranny. Though our adversary be mighty, yet our
Savior, who has redeemed and delivered us, is almighty, and no power of earth
or hell is able to pull us out of his hand. And therefore when we see our own
weakness, let us labor also to see the Ioh. 10. 28, 29. Ephe. 1. 18, 19.
exceeding greatness of Gods power, not only in himself, but also toward us
who believe in him; and pray for our selves, as the Apostle for the Colossians,
not only that we may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, Col. 1. 10,
11.
being fruitful in every good work, but also that we may be strengthened with
all might according to his glorious power, and overcome all difficulties, which
our spiritual adversaries cast in our way, to stop and hinder us in this
course of godliness. The like comforts we may have in the performance of all
good duties, when as we consider Satan's craft and policy, and compare it with
our ignorance and simplicity, seeing this need not to discourage us, if we deny
our own wisdom as insufficient to guide us, and suffer our selves to be
wholly directed by the light of Gods truth, which is sufficient to discover and
defeat all his subtilties and hellish stratagems whereby he indeuoureth to
circumuent us; and give our selves over to be guided in all our ways by the
good Spirit of God, who being infinite in wisdom, is able to turn this
Achitophels policies into foolishness, to fustrate all his cunning plots and
proiects, and so to direct us in all our courses, that we shall easily avoid
all the snares and secret ambushments of this subtle enemy. And finally, his
vigilance and diligence, in seeking to turn us out of the right way, that we
may fall into his snares, cannot discourage us, if denying our own providence
and watchfulness, we commit and commend our selves unto Gods protection,
seeing he is that great Watchman of Israel, who never slumbreth Psalm. 121, 3.
4.
or sleeps, but continually keeps us under the all-seeing eye of his
providence, that he may preserve us safe from the malice and might of Satan and
all the enemies of our salvation.

. Sect. 4 Satan's tentations, whereby he impugneth our faith.
And thus we see, how we may generally encourage our selves in the duties of
a godly life, against those impediments which arise from the nature of this
grand enemy, who opposes us in them. Many others there are which are cast in
our way by his tentations, which either respect our faith, or the fruits of it
in a godly life. Concerning the former; this wily and experienced enemy
mainely bends all his forces and engines of battery against our faith,
because he well knows, that if he can destroy the root, the branches and
fruits which spring from it, will wither and fail of their own accord. And
therefore sometime taking advantage of our wants and unworthiness, our falls,
frailties, and infirmities, he persuades us that we have no faith at all,
when as we have it; and sometimes labors to make us neglect all means of
getting faith when it is wanting, by causing us to rest upon that show and
shadow of it, carnal security and fond presumption. Yea, he assaulteth our
faith diversely, in respect of all the causes and means of our salvation, that
so he may hinder us in the ways of godliness. For first, he moves us
either falsely to believe, that all men are beloved of God, and so we among the
rest, because we enjoy testimonies of his favor in worldly prosperity, though
these outward gifts are given in common to the good and bad; or to doubt of
Gods love, in respect of our afflictions, and so to neglect all duties of his
service, because we know not whether we or our works are accepted of him.
Secondly, he persuades us either to think that all are elected to salvation,
and so we among others, live as we list; or if some be elected, and some
reprobated, that this Decree is unchangeable; and therefore if we be elected,
we shall be saved, though we take our pleasure and neglect all good duties;
or if we be rejected, we shall be condemned, though we take never so much
pains in the ways of godliness. Finally, that we can have no assurance that
we are elected, and therefore it is in vain to labor after it, but rather,
that it is our wisest course to leave it to the venture, and take the benefit of
present pleasures. Thirdly, he will tell us that all are redeemed by Christ,
and we with others, and therefore we may live in our sins, seeing he has
satisfied for them; or that if he have redeemed but some only, that we cannot
be assured that we are in this number, though we be never so diligent in Gods
service. Fourthly, he will suggest that all are universally called, and yet
seeing many fall away, few are chosen, and consequently, that it is a matter
impossible to be assured that we are in Christ's little flock, because when we
have done all we can, we may become Apostates, and no better then Wolves and
Goats; and therefore it were best to spare our pains, and to enjoy our
pleasures when we may have them. Fifthly, he will tell us that we are justified
by faith alone, and therefore by that faith which is alone, and that good
works are not required to the act of justification, and therefore are
needless to the party justified; that they are not the causes of our
salvation, and therefore we need not to walk in them, but may easily go to
heaven by another way. Sixthly, that none upon earth can be perfectly
sanctified, and therefore seeing we cannot be Saints here, we must live like
other men, and not tire our selves in vain, by laboring after
impossibilities. Finally, that though we have never so much grace, and be as
forward as any in the duties of godliness, yet we may fall from this state,
and become as wicked as any other; and therefore seeing when we have done our
best in serving God, and have with much pains stored our selves with all
spiritual graces, we may lose all our labor, and become, notwithstanding all
our care and diligence, utter brankrupts in all goodness, it were our best
course to give over this doubtful pains in the service of God, and to
satisfy our own lusts with the present fruition of worldly delights. Of all
which tentations, which Satan as impediments casts in our way, to discourage
us in the course of godliness, I have largely spoken in the first part of my
Christian Warfare, and therefore here thus briefly pass them over, referring
the Christian Reader to that Book, for his more full satisfaction in these
points.

. Sect. 5 Satan's tentations, whereby he seeks to hinder us from entering into
the ways of godliness, or from proceeding in them.
In respect of the godly life it self, Satan raises against us many lets and
impediments, either to hinder us from entering into the course of Christianity,
or to make us perform the duties required in it superficially and
unprofitably. In respect of the former, he uses many devices, to stop our
entrance into the ways of godliness. And first, he labors to keep our
eyes blinded with ignorance, that we may not see the ways of godliness
wherein we should walk; or if they be discovered by the light of the Gospel
shining unto us, he will endeavor to keep us from seeing the profit and
necessity of walking in them. The former whereof we may avoid, by remembering
and considering, that saving knowledge is one of the chief grounds of a godly
life, without which, it is no more possible that we should perform the duties
of Christianity, then to walk in difficult ways, having no eyes to guide us,
nor light to direct us in them. And therefore we must not content our selves
with our good meaning and ignorant devotion, which can bring forth no better
fruits, then blind superstition and will worship, which are odious unto God,
but use all good means, whereby our minds may be enlightened with the saving
knowledge of Gods truth, and carefully inquire after the good and old Ier. 6.
16.
ways (as the Prophet speaks) that we may walk therein, and find rest to
our souls. And for the avoiding of the other, we must know and remember, that
nothing in the world is so profitable and necessary, as to walk in the ways of
godliness, after that by the light of truth they are discovered unto us,
seeing this alone, though all worldly things be wanting, will make us happy
and blessed in this life and the life to come; Luke 10. 42.
whereas if we have all other things, and want this, we shall be wretched and
miserable. Secondly, Satan labors to hinder us from entering into the ways
of Christianity, by alluring us to continue in our sinful courses, with the
baits of worldly vanities; and by causing us to content our selves with the
present possession of these earthly trifles, he makes us to neglect our
heavenly hopes, which are infinitely more excellent and permanent. For the
escaping of which snare, we must labor to contemn these enticing baits, by
considering that these worldly things are, in respect of spiritual grace and
heavenly glory, vain and unprofitable, uncertain, mutable and momentany, as
elsewhere I have plainly showed. Christ. Warf. 2. part.
Thirdly, he hinders us from all duties of godliness, by the deceitfulness
of sin, which he secretly windeth into our hearts by degrees, till by many acts
of wickedness, he has brought us unto a custom, which is like another
nature, and has in it the commanding force of an irresistable Law. Which
hindrance if we would avoid, we must watch over our selves, that our hearts be
not hardened, through the deceitfulness of sin; to which purpose, Heb. 3. 13.
we must shun the first occasions, withstand the first motions of it, and
pluck up these cursed plants, before they be thoroughly rooted, or if we have
already loaded our consciences with these dead works, our second care must be
to break off our sins by unfeigned repentance, offering herein to our
corrupt nature, an holy violence, and as the Apostle speaks, We must lay
aside every weight, and the sin that does so easily beset Heb. 12. 1.
us, clinging (as it were) about our necks, to hold us back, that we may so
run with patience unto the Race which is set before us, making void, by
degrees, the strong custom of sin, by the acts of piety and righteousness,
until we have confirmed in us the contrary custom of godliness and new
obedience. Finally, Satan labors to hinder us from entering into the course
of Christianity, by persuading us to make delays; and when he cannot any
longer make us believe that it is needless, or of small weight, but that
seeing the profit and necessity of it, we do resolve to leave our former
sinful lives, and to betake our selves unto Gods service, he will persuade us
to defer it for a time, as a thing unpleasing to our corrupt nature, and
unprofitable to our worldly ends, until we may find some fitter opportunity,
and have better settled our earthly business. The which impediment I shall have
fitter occasion to remove in the following Discourse; Only let us here
remember, that if we will be advised by our Saviors wise counsel, We must
first seek the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, Math. 6. 33.
which being a matter of greatest weight, and (in comparison) only necessary,
we must not put it off till aftertimes, which are uncertain, but secure our
selves of it, whilst the day of salvation lasts. And these are the common
impediments which Satan casts into our way, that he may stop us from entering
into the ways of godliness; with which, if he cannot so far prevail, as to
make us neglect all holy duties altogether, he will in the next place endeavor
to make them unprofitable for our salvation. To which purpose, amongst many
other lets, he chiefly and most usually uses these two. The first is, to keep
us from feeling in them any power of godliness, for the bettering of our
spiritual estate, by causing us to perform these duties in a cold and formal
manner, more for custom then conscience sake. The other is, to make us fickle
and unconstant in them, performing them by fits and flashes, when we have least
to do, and have some spare time from our worldly employments. The former
whereof we may avoid, by setting our selves about the duties of Christianity,
as our main business, with all resolute diligence, and zealous devotion,
knowing that it is impossible to travail in this way, so full of difficulties
and dangers, without serious endeavor, or to perform duties of so high a
nature, and so contrary to natural corruption, without diligent and painful
labor. The latter, by tying our selves unto a settled course, in the
performance of all Christian duties, knowing that he who goes sometime
forward, and sometimes backward, can never make any riddance of his journey,
nor come seasonably to the end of it. Both which weighty points I here thus
briefly pass over, because I have already spoken of them at large. And let
this suffice to have briefly mentioned those impediments, which Satan
immediately by himself ordinarily uses to hinder us from entering into, or
proceeding in the way of godliness; unto which, many more might be added, if I
had not already handled the most of them in the first part of my Christian
Warfare.

CAP. II.
Of worldly impediments which hinder a godly life; and first, such as are
public.

. Sect. 1 The first public impediment arising from evil Magistrates.
Unto the impediments which the devil himself directly uses to hinder our
proceeding in Christian duties, we will now add those which are cast into our
way by the world and the flesh, who join all their forces with him, which are
far more powerful and preualent then his own tentations. The impediments of
the world are either public, or private. The former respect superiors, as
Magistrates and Ministers; or inferiors, as the people that are under their
government. The impediments which oppose a godly life, respecting Magistrates,
are chiefly two: the first is, their authority and greatness abused to
impiety, as to the discountenancing of virtue and godliness, and the
countenancing of vice and sin, the discouraging of the faithful in all good
courses, and the heartening of the wicked in their impiety and profaneness. The
which is done by their private favors, denied to the one, and imparted to the
other; or by their public edicts and laws crying down the sincerity of
Religion, and strengthening the sons of Belial in their outrageous
wickedness. For the avoiding of which impediments, let us often consider how
much better it is to have the favor of God, in which consists our life and
happiness, and which being permanent and unchangeable, will never forsake us,
then the favor of Princes and great men, whose favors are momentany, seeing
(as the Psalmist speaks) their breath being in their Psalm. 146. 4.
nostrels, they will sooner return to their dust; and also fickle and mutable,
being ready to hate to morrow, whom they love to day; as we see in the example
of Haman, and many others. That it is better to have the peace of a good
conscience which accompanyeth well-doing, then the praise and applause of the
greatest Potentates, in our neglect of holy duties. That we shall have little
comfort when we are going to hell, though we carry in our hands their Pass or
Patent, affoording unto us a quiet passage without check or disturbance, no
though we have themselves to bear us company, and countenance us in the way.
Neither let the laws of evil Magistrates discourage us in Christian duties,
seeing we have a superior Law of the supreme King of heaven and earth,
whereunto both they and we are bound to yield obedience; and howsoever we are
thereby tied to be subordinate unto them, so long as they hold their
subordination unto God, yet when they leave him, we must leave them and their
laws, choosing with the Apostles, to obey God, rather then men, and resolutely
Act. 5. 29.
sustaining our selves in our Christian obedience, by our invincible patience,
in suffering with meekness, whatsoever might and malice can inflict upon us,
and with our infallible hopes of inioying that eternal happiness, which Christ
has promised to all those that suffer persecution Mat. 5. 10, 11.
for righteousness sake. The other impediment is the evil example of great
men, which mightily draws inferiors to imitation, if God stay them not with
his Spirit. For seeing likeness causes love, and this in great personages, is
the staff and strength of inferiors hopes, expecting to rise by their means,
hereof it is, that they conform themselves to imitate their manners, though
neither out of love to their persons or conditions, but merely out of
self-love, that they may hereby advance their own worldly ends. In which
regard, as prosperity finds many friends, so Princes and great men have many
followers, because they are the chief dispencers of these worldly preferments.
But if we would also leap over this block, and keep a constant course in the
ways of godliness; we must live, not by examples, but by precepts, and not
look what others do, but what God requires of us. And as we must not follow
a multitude, Exodus 23. 2.
and (as it were) the whole Herd, in doing evil, so neither the mighty (as it
were) the Rams of the flock, when as, like ill presidents, they mis-leade us
out of the ways of godliness, into the bypath of error and sin. And to this
end let us remember, that greatness has no privilege in grace and goodness,
seeing (as the Apostle tells us) Not many rich and 1. Cor. 1. 26. Math. 11.
25.
mighty are called: yea rather (as the experience of all times has taught us)
they come as far behind the meanest sort (for the most part) in all grace and
goodness, as they do exceed them in glory and greatness. And therefore let
not these glorious lights dazzle our eyes, and like the Ignis fatuus, or fools
fire, bewitch and entice us to follow them into the ditches and quagmires of
vice and sin, but leaving them where they leave the light of Gods truth, let
us wholly commit our selves over to be guided by it, which will preserve us
from being misled by such ill examples.

. Sect. 2 Of the impediments which arise from evil Ministers.
The other sort of public impediments, whereby the world hinders us in the
ways of godliness, arise from evil Ministers, both in respect of their
doctrine, and also their lives and ill examples. In the former respect, the
people are much hindered by such insufficient and unconscionable Ministers, as
either cannot, or will not instruct them in the duties of a godly life, or else
do it not after a right manner. And first, when such blind guides are set over
them, as cannot see the way of truth, and much less lead and direct others in
it; for when the blind lead the blind, they must Math. 15. 4.
needs both fall into the ditch, as our Savior speaks. Which kind of
Ministers are so far from deserving the esteem of true Pastors, that they
are unworthy the place of the dogs of the flock, seeing they are dumb, Esa.
56. 10.
and cannot bark and give any warning to the sheep when the Wolf comes.
Secondly, when such unconscionable Ministers have the charge of souls
committed unto them, as having sufficiency of gifts, will not, through
negligence and idleness, feed them with the Bread of life, and being more
cruel then the Ostriches, or the Dragons (as Jeremy Lamen. 4. 3.
speaks in another case) will not pull out their breasts, though full of milk,
for the feeding of Gods children committed to them, but let them starve and
perish for want of nourishment; herein worse then the other, who having dry
breasts, cannot (though they would) afford unto them the sincere milk of the
Word. Whereas these are so hard-hearted, that they can, but will not, choosing
rather to let their milk corrupt in their breasts, and to dry up for want of
drawing, then to preserve their own plenty, by communicating to the peoples
necessities. And not much better are they who preach but very seldom, having
gifts and strength sufficient, and then not so much out of conscience to
perform their duty, as to avoid the penalty of the Law, or the blemish of
ignorance and insufficiency. Seeing the life of grace in Gods people, cannot
ordinarily be Esa. 28. 9, 10.
preserved in any vigor by a monthly meal, but needs frequent nourishment,
as the people are able to hear and bear away. And therefore the Apostle
lays a strait charge upon Timothy, and in him, upon all Gods Ministers, not
only that they should preach the Word, but also that 2. Tim. 4. 1. Mark. 4.
33. Act. 20. 28.
they should do it instantly, in season, and out of season, that is, often,
and upon all occasions. Fourthly, the work of grace and godliness is much
hindered in the people, when as the Ministers preach themselves, and not Christ,
chiefly intending to show their own gifts, learning and eloquence, and not the
edification and salvation of the people. When as they do not preach the Word
with power and authority, like our Savior Mat. 7. 29.
Christ, nor in the evidence and demonstration of the Spirit, to their hearts
and consciences, that they may cast down the strong holds of sin; but come
1. Cor. 2. 4.
in the enticing speech of man's wisdom, to tickle the ear, and soar aloft
in idle and heartlesse speculations, far out of the reach, and above the
capacity of their hearers, filling their heads with the froth of witty
conceits, which have in them no solid nourishment. Wherein they carry
themselves contrary to the charge which our Savior gives to the Apostle
Peter, and all his faithful Ministers; namely, that in their teaching they
should take care to feed, not only his sheep, but also his tender lambs.
Joh. 21. 15. Act. 20. 35.
Finally, the people are much hindered in their growth of godliness, when as
their Ministers take no pains publicly to catechize and instruct them in the
maine principles of Christian Religion, seeing no good building can be erected
by them who neglect to lay a sure foundation; or privately to resolve their
doubts, and to provoke them by holy conferences, and Act. 20. 21.
earnest exhortations and persuasions, to put in practice those duties which
they have learned by their public ministry. Through which faults and defects
in worldly and careless Ministers, the people committed to their charge, are
much hindered in the ways of godliness. For where prophecy fails, there the
people must needs perish. Where there is a Pro. 29. 18. Amos 8. 11.
famine of the Word, what can follow but faintness and feebleness for want of
food? Where the Gospel is not preached, which is the power of Romans 1. 16. 2.
Cor. 2. 16.
God unto salvation, and the savor of life unto life, to all that believe:
what can ensue hereupon, but impotent weakness unto all good duties, and death
and destruction of body and soul? If the Watchmen sleep, who should give
warning to Gods people, of the approach of enemies, how easily may they surprise
and vanquish them? If the Gardener, and Vintager be slothful and idle in
planting and watering, how shall Gods Plants and Vines flourish? And if they
busy not themselves in pruning and weeding, how shall the Garden and Vineyard
thrive, and not rather be ouer-growne with weeds and thistles? If the lights be
put out, or hid under a bushel, what can follow but palpable darkness,
through which the people of God must necessarily err out of the ways of
truth? Romans 10. 17.
And if the Gospel of Christ be not painfully preached, which is the
ordinary means of begetting Faith; how should the people come out of the
state of infidelity, and believe, that they may be saved? And what can follow
of all this, but the utter neglect of all the duties belonging to a godly life,
when saving knowledge and a lively Faith, the foundations of it, are
overthrown?

. Sect. 3 Of the means whereby the former impediments may be removed, first, in
respect of the Ministers.
For the removing of which impediments, first, the Ministers are to be exhorted
and persuaded to do their duty. And in the first place, that none presume to
take upon them this high calling, which God has never called unto it, being
altogether unfitted and unfurnished with gifts necessarily required to this
high duty; seeing they purchase their means and maintenance with the price of
blood, not of the bodies, but of the precious souls of the people, the which
shall be required at their hands in that terrible day, when as Christ shall
come to judge both the quick and the dead. And secondly, those which God has
furnished with gifts, are to be moved and admonished in the fear of God, that
with all care and good conscience they feed the flock of Christ committed to
their charge, not for filthy lucre, 1. Pet. 5. 2, 3.
but with a willing mind, chiefly aiming at the glory of God in the
salvation of the people. To which purpose, let them first remember those names
and titles given them in the Scriptures, implying not only their duty, but
great and high privileges whereby they should be encouraged unto it. For they
are appointed of God to be the Lights of the world; and what sin and shame is
it to hide their Light, Matthew. 5. 13, 14, 15.
and to let the people sit in darkness and in the shadow of death? They are
the Salt of the earth, appointed not only to be sauorie in themselves, but
also to season others, which salt of Grace and Wisdom if they lose, they are
good for nothing, but to be cast upon the dunghill, and to be trodden under
feet. They are Gods Watchmen, Ezech. 3. 17. and 33. 7.
who have the care of his armies committed unto them, to give them warning of
the approach of their enemies, which if they neglect, the blood of those which
perish through their sloth, shall be required at their hands. They are
appointed to be Captains over the people, to Matthew. 15. 14.
go out and in before them, and to train and teach them how to fight against
the enemies of their salvation. They are Gods Husbandmen, 1. Cor. 3. 6, 9.
Gardeners and Vintagers, to plant and sow, purge, weed and prune his fields,
gardens and vineyards, that they may bring forth fruit 1. Cor. 4. 1, 2.
in due season. They are Stewards of his family, who must have in Matthew. 13. 52.
store both new and old, that they may give a fit portion to all their fellow
servants. They are Gods Ambassadors unto the people, 2. Cor. 5. 20, 21.
who represent his own person, and deliver unto them the glad tidings of the
Gospel, wherein God offers unto them peace and reconciliation; and therefore
being so highly honored, they must not be slack in doing their message.
Finally, they are their spiritual Fathers, 1. Cor. 4. 15.
ordained of God as his instruments, to beget them unto himself by the
immortal seed of the Word; which if they neglect, the people through their
default remain the children of wrath, and dead in their sins. Secondly, let
them remember that heavy woe and dreadful curse denounced against those who
preach not the Gospel, 1. Cor. 9. 16.
or do the work of the Lord negligently. Thirdly, let them have Ier. 48. 10.
in mind that fearful account which those have to make at the day of
Judgment, that through their sloth, worldliness, or unconscionable kind of
preaching, are found guilty of destroying the souls which were committed to
their charge. Fourthly, let them be encouraged to the diligent performance of
their duty, by that inward peace of conscience, and unspeakable joy and
comfort, which all Gods faithful Ministers find and feel in their own
hearts and consciences, when as by their Ministry they see God glorified in
the salvation of his people committed to their charge. Finally, let them
encourage themselves in their painful labors, by calling to mind that
unspeakable recompense of reward, promised to all those who convert others
unto righteousness, seeing they shall shine as stars of Dan. 12. 3.
the firmament in the glory of Gods Kingdom.

. Sect. 4 Of other means respecting the people.
Secondly, the people for their part, are to use all good helps and means for
the removing of this impediment. And first, their care must be to place
themselves under sufficient, godly, and faithful Ministers, who will carefully
and conscionably break unto them the bread of life. And if in the days of
their ignorance, they have seated themselves under blind guides, ignorant and
insufficient Ministers, or if such be imposed upon them against their wills in
those places where their lands and livings, trades and means do lie, they
must not only sigh and mourn under this burden, but also use all lawful
means to be freed from it as soon as they can, either by procuring some
better means by their care and charge, or by removing their habitation (though
with some worldly inconvenience) unto some other place; Esteeming this one
thing necessary, to enjoy the means of their salvation, and with the wise
Merchant purchasing this pearl Matthew. 13. 45.
and treasure at the highest rate, rather then be without it. For if we would
be hired with no worldly gain, to live in such places as afford no food for
the nourishment of our bodies; let us be no less wise and careful for our
precious souls, and not hazard them to death and destruction, by continuing in
those places for our worldly advantage, where there is a continual famine of
the Word, but rather then want it, we must wander from sea to sea, and from
the North to the East, that Amos 8. 11, 12.
we may seek and find it. But if the Ministers under whom God has placed us,
have sufficiency of gifts, and yet through sloth and negligence, worldliness
or want of care and good conscience, neglect their duty, we are not so easily
to abandon them, before we have used all good means whereby they may be made
more painful and diligent. And first, we must labor with God by our fervent
prayers, that he will sanctify their gifts, and give unto them, such faithful
and honest hearts, as that they may more conscionably set themselves to seek
Gods glory in the salvation of the people committed to their charge, and so
employ their talents which they have received, as that they may be able to make
a cheerful account, when as they shall be called to give up their reckoning.
For if those which are most faithful and diligent in discharge of their duty,
need these helps, which made the Apostle so often to desire the prayers of the
people; how much more do they need them, who have so many defects in the work
of their Ministry? Secondly, we must endeavor to draw them on to more
diligence by our good counsels and admonitions, in the Spirit of love and
meekenes, without all spleen and bitterness, or any disgrace offered to their
persons. Thirdly, we must labor to win and encourage them, not only by
avoiding causeless wranglings and contentions, but also by paying unto them
justly and honestly their full due, which Matthew. 10. 10.
by the Laws of God and men belong unto them, and not take occasion upon the
neglect of their duty to neglect ours. Yea, rather with open hearts and hands,
we must carry our selves liberally toward Gal. 6. 10. 1. Cor 9. 7. Heb. 13.
5. 1. Tim. 5. 17.
them according to our ability, that gayning their love, they may become more
careful to seek our spiritual good, communicating unto us their ministerial
gifts, when they see us willing to communicate unto them our corporal
blessings. Fourthly, we must not vilify and contemn their Ministry, though
there be therein some wants and imperfections, nor run from them to others,
who in our judgment do exceed them; but bear with their infirmities, and do
our best to reform and amend them. Finally, when they preach unto us, we are
to hear them with all diligence and reverence, whereby we shall make them more
careful to deliver things worth our hearing, and more ready to take greater
pains, when they see them so much regarded. For as the sucking of the child
draws down the mothers milk, and causes it to come in greater plenty,
whereas if the breast be not drawn, all the milk is soon dried up; so is it
in this case between the Minister and the people. By all which and the like
means if we prevail nothing, we are (if possibly we can) to remove our
selves from under their charge, seeing it is not much material unto us,
whether they cannot or will not teach us the way of salvation, and no less
necessity lies upon us of hearing, then upon them of preaching the Gospel;
nor a less woe, if through our own negligence we hear it not.

. Sect. 5 Of the impediment of a godly life, arising from the evil lives of
some Ministers.
The last public impediment respecting the Ministry, is the evil lives of
many, who take upon them to persuade others to the practice of Christian
duties. For ordinarily the people imagine, that they go fast enough in the
ways of godliness, if they keep full pace with those which are their
Teachers. And though they hear them often in the Pulpit, use many arguments to
draw them on to more perfection; yet they suppose that there is no necessity of
serving God so strictly and sincerely, but that all is spoken for form and
fashion sake; otherwise they who are so earnest in persuading us, would lead
us the way by their good example. For the removing of which impediment, we are
to know, that howsoever Ministers excel others in the common gifts of the
Spirit, as knowledge, learning and such like, yet the saving graces of God are
free, and not tied to any calling or profession more then others. And therefore
seeing in this regard, the learned has no privilege above the unlearned, the
Doctor above the Artificer, or the Pharisee before the Fisherman, it is no
great marvel, if the greatest Rabbis in the world be as small proficients
in Matthew. 11. 25. 1. Cor. 1. 26. Matthew. 23. 2, 3.
grace, and in the practice of holy and Christian duties, as those which they
scorn for their ignorance and simplicity. But yet so long as they sit in Moses
chair, we must not only hear them, but do as they say, though not as they
do, seeing their speeches are not grounded upon the authority of their persons
or actions, but upon the Word of God, unto which we owe simple and absolute
obedience, whosoever be the Messenger that brings it unto us. But of this I
have written more largely in the first part of my Warfare, unto which I refer
the Reader, who desires in this point more full satisfaction.

. Sect. 6 Of the public impediments which respect the people.
The common impediments of a godly life which respect the people, are also
diverse. As first, when they content themselves with a form of profession and
Religion, without any desire to find in themselves the power, efficacy and
fruit thereof, for the sanctifying of their hearts, and reforming of their
lives. As when they profess Religion, because the State establishes it; go
to the Church and hear the Word, because the Law requires it; pray in the
Congregation, and go to the Communion, because it is the custom of the
Country, and other of their neighbors do it as well as they. But this is to
rest in a shadow without a substance, and in a form of godliness, but denying
the power thereof. Which if we would avoid, our care must 2. Tim. 3. 5.
be to serve God in obedience to his Commandments, to worship him in Spirit
and truth, and to join the inward service of the heart and soul, with the
ourward service of the body; and finally, that in all these duties we propound
unto our selves right ends, namely, to profit by them in knowledge, faith, and
the practice of all holy duties of a godly life, that we may glorify God in the
further assurance of our salvation. The second impediment respecting The second
impediment.
the people, is the neglect and contempt of the Preaching of Gods Word, as a
thing unnecessary for their salvation. For howsoever they suppose, that there
is some use of it for their conversion unto God, the inlightening of their
minds with some knowledge of the truth, and the working of faith in some first
degrees; yet they hold it a needelesse task to be continually tied to these
religious exercises, and that it is sufficient to use them sometimes at their
best leisure. Which impediment if we would shun, we must remember, that as
the Word and the ministry thereof, is the immortal seed which begets us
to God, so it is the spiritual food of our Ephe. 4. 11, 12, 13.
souls, whereby they must be continually nourished, that the graces of the
Spirit begun, may be increased and confirmed in us, until we come to a
perfect age in Jesus Christ. That it is the sword of the Spirit, whereof we
have daily use in our spiritual warfare, (which lasts as long as our lives
last) for the repelling of our enemies, and the ouercomming of all their
dangerous temptations. That it is the only true light, which guides us in all
our ways, whereof if through negligence we deprive our selves, we shall walk
in darkness, and sit in the shadow of death. That it is our counselor in
all our doubts, and our comforter in all our troubles; the means to strengthen
and uphold us when we stand, and to recover and raise us when we are fallen; the
chief help we have to keep us in the way of truth, and to recall us when we
err and go astray; our food in time of health, and our physic to cure and
restore us when we are sick. The third impediment to the The third impediment.
life of grace and godliness is, when as the people are content to hear the
Word, but without any cheerfulness and delight, with cloyed stomachs and lost
appetites, whereof it is, that this delicious Manna is loathsome to their
carnal and surfetted taste, and yields no wholesome nourishment, because it
is eaten against the stomach. Which if we would remove, we must labor often
to quicken our appetite, that we may with David find and feel the
sweetness of Gods Psalm. 19. 10.
Word, far exceeding the honey and the hony-combe, and earnestly hunger and
thirst after it, that we may profit by it, and have the graces of Gods Spirit
nourished and increased in us. To which end we must often meditate upon the
excellency, profit and necessity of it, as being a Pearl above all price, and
the only chief treasure which will make us truly rich. The fourth
impediment, is want of diligence, reverence The fourth impediment.
and attention in the hearing of the Word, whereby most of this precious liquor
spilleth beside, and is utterly lost; and want of care to treasure it up in our
memories, or to meditate upon it afterward, that we may bring it home to our
hearts and consciences, and practice it in our lives. Which if we would remove,
we must consider, that it is not the deed done, which will make Gods
ordinances truly profitable, but the right manner of doing them; that God will
never bless unto us the means of our salvation, if we only bring our lips
and ears, and outward man unto them, and do not perform these religious
duties with our heart and spirit. And finally, that for our spiritual
nourishment it is not sufficient, that we have plenty of food set before us,
unless we feed on it with good appetites, retain it in our memories (as it
were) in the stomach; and well digest and apply it to our use by serious
meditation: which duties if we neglect, either not feeding upon the food of
our souls, or casting it up again as soon as it is eaten, we can never
attain unto any spiritual strength, but must needs grow faint and languish in
the life of godliness. The last impediment (which I The fifth impediment.
will here speak of) in the people, is too much curiosity, both in their
hearing and applying of the Word. For such itching ears have many, that they
loath the sincere milk of the Word, and all ordinary points handled in an
ordinary manner; and affect nothing but novelties, idle speculations and
curious questions; witty discourses and frothy conceits. But that we may shun
this foolish curiosity, let us know, that as the Ministers are bound to deliver
the sincere truth in the evidence 1. Cor. 2. 4.
of the Spirit and power, so they no less to hunger after it, even the sincere
milk of the Word, that they may grow up thereby: That 1. Pet. 21. 1. Cor. 2. 2.
as they are bound to teach, so we above all things must desire to know Jesus
Christ and him crucified. That they who desire to understand above that which
is meet, and affect only nicities and novelties, do feed Romans 12. 3.
upon froth and wind, which will puff them up, but never nourish 1. Cor. 8. 1.
them; and finally, that hungring after continual variety, and strange dishes,
is a sign of a sick and weak stomach, full of gross humors, which needs
to be purged, before it can be nourished. The like hinderance curiosity
brings to our proceedings in godliness, in respect of applying the Word;
when as men will not bring it home to their own hearts, but curiously prying
into, and examining the lives and manners of others, do put off all that is
spoken from themselves, and apply it unto them whom they think it more nearly
concerns. Which if we would avoid, we must conceive that God has purposely
sent what we hear as a message unto us, that all that is spoken, is for our
own learning and use, as if there were none in the Church besides. That the
Word which we hear will not profit, unless it be mixed with faith, and that
there is no faith, where there is no application to our own use. Finally, that
ye meat only nourishes us which our selves feed upon and digest, and not
that which being carved unto us we do not eat, but put it away from us, or
else lay it upon another man's trencher.

CAP. III.
Of such private impediments which the world uses, to hinder us in a godly
life, and first, those on the right hand.

. Sect. 1 Of the tentations of prosperity, which are most dangerous impediments
of a godly life.
WHat are the public impediments, which the world casts in our way, to
hinder us from proceeding in the duties of a godly life, we have showed in the
former chapter: and now it remains that we entreat of those which are more
private. And these are either the tentations wherewith the World usually
assaulteth us; or certain scandals and offenses which it lays before us, to
discourage us in the ways of Godliness. The World tempts us diversely, both
on the right hand with earthly prosperity, and on the left with crosses and
afflictions. The more dangerous of these two, are the tentations of prosperity,
wherewith the world allureth us (as by her bewitching baits) to make us leave
the narrow and afflicted path of righteousness and holiness, and to walk in
the broad and easy way that leads to destruction. These are those
intoxicating cups, whereby it makes men so drunk, that they have neither list
nor power to walk in the path of piety; those false lights, which so dazzle
men's eyes, that they cannot discern the excellency of spiritual grace and
heavenly glory; those inamouring potions, that make us to love the world, and
to dote so on this painted Strumpet, that we think all time lost which is not
spent in her service; those waters, which quench in us the love of God, the
zeal of his glory, and all feruency of desire in attayning to heavenly
happiness; those thorns, which choke in us all good motions of Gods Spirit;
and finally, those intangling snares which catch and hold us, that we cannot
go on in any religious duties or holy actions. Against these tentations, which
as strong impediments hinder so many from the profession and practice of
godliness, we may best arm our selves, by considering that the love of the
1. Ioh. 2. 15.
world and the love of God will not stand together, because, as the Apostle
James teaches us, The amity of the world is enmity against God, and he Iam.
4. 4.
who makes himself a friend to the one, does make himself an enemy to the
other. That the prosperity of the world is vain and uncertain, momentany and
mutable, hard to get, and easily lost. And that it does not usually further us
toward the attaining of our main and chief ends, as neither adding any thing
to Gods graces in us here, nor to our glory and happiness in the life to
come. Yea, by reason of our corruption, which is apt to abuse it to our own
harm, it usually becomes a great hinderance, and a notable pulbacke in
running the Race of Christianity, making us forgetful of God and our own
good, proud and high-minded, worldly and carnal, doting so upon the present
fruition Pro. 1. 32.
of earthly vanities, as that we utterly neglect all means of our future
happiness.

. Sect. 2 Of such impediments as a life from worldly things, as honors, riches
and pleasures, and from the society and familiarity of wicked men.
Now the special impediments of a godly life are diverse and manifold; but the
chief and principal which the world uses to tempt us on the right hand, are
honors, riches, pleasures, worldly friends and acquaintance, whose society and
conversation are notable hindrances to a godly life. And these baits the world
fitteth to every man's several humor and disposition; unto the ambitious, it
propounds honors and the glory of the world; unto the covetous, riches and
earthly treasures; unto the voluptuous, pleasures and carnal delights, causing
them to bend their whole thoughts, and to spend their whole time in compassing
them, so as they have no leisure to think upon, much less to perform the
duties of a godly life. Which impediments if we would avoid, we must learn to
contemn these earthly vanities, as being vain and worthless, uncertain both
in respect of getting and keeping, and unprofitable, yea hurtful and
pernicious to all those who set their hearts upon them. All which, with many
other to this purpose, I have largely handled in the second part of my
Christian Warfare, and therefore do here thus briefly pass them over.
Neither is it needful that I should here say much of the society, friendship,
and familiarity with the wicked and profane, seeing I have already spoken of
it in the former Discourse. Only let us here take notice, that it is one of
the chief impediments which the world uses to hinder us in the ways of
godliness. For no more apt is the contagious Sicut malu^ ^^r assiduo statu
tractus inflicit corp^^; ita peruer^^ l^^^tio assid^^e infirmantium infi^it
animum, vt tabescat delectatione praui operis, assiduitate curiosi sermonis.
Greg. super Ezech. Pro. 29. 6.
air, which we daily breathe, to poison and infect the body, then the company
of ungodly and ungracious men, to taint and infect the soul. And no more
possible is it to walk daily among snares and not be caught, or to live
amongst the eues and not be robbed, then to preserve our selves from being
entangled in the nets and grinnes of the wicked, and to be spoiled of all Gods
graces, if we take delight to consort our selves with such as are graceless
and ungodly. So Solomon tells us, that in the transgression of an evil man,
there is a snare, whereby he does not only more and more entangle himself,
but also all others that bear him company. For society and familiarity arises
out of likeness of minds and manners, and cannot long continue, if it do not
either find, or at least make this similitude and correspondence, according to
that of the Prophet; Can two Amos 3. 3.
walk together, and not be agreed? And as possible it is to reconcile light
and darkness, truth and falsehood, good and evil, as the faithful and
infidels, godly Christians and profane worldlings, both retaining their own
properties and dispositions. For an unjust man is an abomination to the Pro.
29. 27.
just, and he that is upright in his way, is an abomination to the wicked.
Neither let any so much presume upon their own strength, as to imagine that
they can retain their sincerity, though they keep wicked company, and rather
convert them to good, then be perverted by them unto evil, seeing this is a
matter of great difficulty. To be good (says one) among the Inter bonos bonum
esse, salutem habet, inter malos vero etiam laudem, etc. Bern. in Epist.
good, has in it health and safety; among the wicked to be so, is also
commendable and praiseworthy; in that, happiness is joined with much
security; in this, much virtue with difficulty. For as he who is running down
the hill, can sooner pull with him one that is ascending, then he who is going
up, can cause him to ascend that is running down: so he who holds an headlong
course in wickedness, can more easily carry with him one that is ascending the
hill of virtue, being a motion contrary to natural disposition, then he can
cause him to ascend with him. For in common experience we see, that the worser
state prevails more, in altring the better to its condition, then the better
to make the worse like it self. The infected are not so soon cured by the
sound, as they tainted with their contagion; Rotten Apples lying with the
sound, are not restored to soundness; but the sound are corrupted with their
rottenness. Dead carkases united to living bodies, are not thereby revived,
unless it be by miracle, as we see in Elizeus and Paul; but the living, if
they continue any time united to the 1. King. 4. 34. Act. 20. 10.
dead, partake with them in their mortality and corruption. And thus it is also
in our spiritual state, wherein the worser more prevails to corrupt the
better, then the better to reform the worse. For they being wholly flesh, are
more earnest and diligent in the devils service, to draw others unto his
Kingdom, then true Christians can be in the cause of God, seeing they are but
in part regenerate, and the flesh opposes the Spirit in all good actions,
which either respect themselves or their neighbors. And therefore wicked men
will leave no means unassayed, but will employ their whole strength and
endeavor to draw others with them into the same excess of worldliness and
wickedness. For first, they will infect them by their unsavory speeches and
filthy communication, which is a powerful means to taint those that bear
them company with their wickedness, according to that of the Apostle; Evil
words corrupt good manners. Secondly, 1. Cor. 15. 31.
by their exhortations and persuasions, as the Wiseman excellently Pro. 1. 10,
11, 12. and 5. 3. and 7. 13, 14, 21.
shows in diverse places, unto which Sirens songs we are apt to give heed,
unless we submit our selves to be guided and directed with the voice of
Wisdom, and be powerfully restrained with the contrary motions of Gods
Spirit. Thirdly, wicked men do much hinder them who keep them company in the
ways of godliness, and provoke them to accompany them in their sins, by
their evil examples, especially when they see them thrive and prosper in their
wickedness, as we see in David, who though he were a man according to Gods
own heart, yet his foot had almost slipped, when he saw the great prosperity of
the ungodly, being ready to conclude, that he had cleansed his heart in vain,
and washed his hands in innocence. The which tentation is of greater force,
when we have the Psalm. 73. 2, 13.
evil example not of some few, but of the multitude, or of some great and
eminent persons, whose actions above others, are most exemplary. Finally,
wicked men draw on those who keep them company, to have fellowship with them
in their wickedness, by their fair promises, alluring baits, and liberal
offers of rewards. And thus those sinful wretches of whom Solomon speaks,
draw on their companions to join with them in violence and oppression, by
offering unto them part of the spoil, and large rewards, to encourage them in
their wickedness: We shall find Pro. 1. 11, 13, 14.
(say they) all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil. Cast
in thy lot among us, let us all have one purse. Which dangerous impediment if
we would avoid, let us with all care and diligence make choice of good
company, which will both by their words, mutual exhortations, and good
examples, help us forward, and better our speed in the ways of godliness,
like runners in a race, who by striving who shall out-runne one another, do
all come to the goal in shorter time and with much more speed, then if they
should run alone, and have no other to contend with them. And contrariwise,
let us with like care shun familiar society with wicked men, though in
worldly respects it is profitable unto us, assuring our selves, that though for
the present, we find some benefit by such society, yet in the end our
spiritual loss will far exceed our worldly gain. Or if we be so settered
and hampered with such near bonds of consanguinity, alliance, necessary
intercourse of dealing, or near neighborhood, that we cannot go far from
them, yet at least let it be our grief, that we are constrained to live with
them, and come into their company more often then we would, according to the
example of holy David, who cried out in this case; Woe is me, that I soiourne
in Mesech, that I dwell Psalm. 20. 6.
in the tents of Kedar; and of Lot, whose righteous soul was much grieved, 2.
Pet. 2. 7.
when living among the Sodomites, he was forced to see their filthy
conversation. And to this end, let us remember first the many exhortations used
in the Scriptures, inciting us, with all care and circumspection, to shun and
avoid the society of the wicked: Be ye not Ephesians. 5. 7, 11.
partakers with them; neither have any fellowship with the unfruitful works
of darkness. Separate your selves from them, and come out from amongst Number.
16. 26. Apoc. 18. 4. Exodus 23. 1.
them, lest you be partakers of their plagues. Secondly, when their prosperity
allureth us to accompany them in their evil courses, let us not judge
according to outward appearance, nor consult with flesh and blood, but with
David go into Gods Sanctuary, and there we shall Psalm. 73. 17.
learn the end of these men* namely, that being set in slippery places, they
shall quickly catch a fall, and be so wholly rooted out, that their place shall
no more be found. Thirdly, that if we keep company with the wicked, we shall
not only communicate with them in their sins, but also in their punishments;
for the companions of fools shall be destroyed; and they that will not come out
of Babylon, shall be partakers of her plagues. Finally, let us remember, Pro.
13. 20.
that they are blessed, who walk not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stand
Psalm. 1. 1.
in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful. But of these
motives I have before spoken, and therefore content my self here, thus
briefefly to have touched them.

CAP. IIII.
Of private impediments on the left hand, as afflictions and persecutions.

. Sect. 1 How the world seeks to hinder our course in godliness by
afflictions and persecutions.
ON the left hand the World assaulteth us with afflictions and persecutions,
that it may hinder and discourage us in the ways of godliness. For first, it
loadeth us, as much as in it lies, with crosses and calamities, even for
righteousness sake, and then persuades us, that we serve God not only in
vain, but even to our loss: and therefore that it were our best course, to
take our liberty, and to live as others do, seeing we have no other rewards
for all our painful service, our strictness of life, and abandoning of our
pleasures, the unpleasant exercises of mortification, and denying in all things
our own wills and delightful lusts, but misery and affliction. And thus David
was assaulted, when he was ready to conclude, that Psalm. 73. 13.
he had cleansed his heart, and washed his hands to no purpose in innocence,
seeing he was afflicted every morning. And with the like tentation Job was
often discouraged, when as his three friends in so many places labor to
persuade him, that all his former labors in Gods service were vain and of no
worth, because of the extraordinary afflictions which he endured. And Jeremy
likewise was so much troubled with the sight of the Jer. 12. 1. and 20. 14, 18.
wickeds prosperity, and the sense of his own miseries, that he breaks out
into great impatiency. For the removing of which impediment, we are to know,
that howsoever the world, and worldly men use all their might and malice to
hinder us in our course of godliness, yet they are no ways able to do what
they intend, seeing they are not the chief causes of our afflictions, but
only Gods instruments who ouer-ruleth them at his pleasure, and so orders
and disposes of all our crosses and calamities which they inflict upon us,
both in respect of their matter and manner, measure and time of continuance, as
that they shall not any ways hurt us, but shall wholly tend to our good; not
consume and destroy us, but purify and purge us (like gold in the fire) from
the dross of our corruptions; not cool or quench our zeal and devotion, but
rather kindle and inflame them; and finally, not hinder us at all in the duties
of a godly life, but further and make us more forward and cheerful in
performing them, causing us, by these many tribulations, to go more surely and
safely, by the way of grace and godliness, into the Kingdom of heavenly joy
and happiness.

. Sect. 2 Of the worlds professed hatred, whereby it seeks to discourage us
in the duties of a godly life.
Now these afflictions and persecutions, which the world raises against us to
discourage us in all the duties of a godly life, are manifold, which in their
own nature are to flesh and blood bitter and grievous. And first, it pursues
us with professed hatred, maligning all, with all spleen and spite, who leave
the world, and love God. For though whilst we are of the world, it loves us,
because we are her own, yet when Christ has chosen us out of the world, and
we have given our names unto Joh. 15. 9.
him, professing that we will be his soldiers and servants, then the world,
out of that hatred which it bears to our Lord and Master, will begin, for his
sake to hate us. And as they who make themselves friends Jam. 4. 4.
of the world, do, by reason of that enmity which is between them, make
themselves thereby the enemies of God: so contrariwise, those that become
friends unto God, do hereby make themselves enemies to the world. So David
says, that they who rendered evil for good, were his adversaries, Psalm. 38. 20.
because he did follow the thing that was good. And therefore he professes
the like enmity against them, because they were Gods enemies: Do Psalm. 139.
21, 22
not (says he) I hate them (O Lord) that hate thee? and am I not grieved with
those that speak against thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them
mine enemies. The which hatred of the world, and malicious enmity against the
faithful, is a strong tentation, and great discouragement, especially to those
who are of mild, gentle and peaceable dispositions, to hinder their speed in
the ways of godliness. Against which, that we may be the better armed, let
us first consider, that it is a matter of mere necessity to undergo the
worlds hatred, if we would be assured, that we either love God, or that we are
beloved of him. For such enmity there is between them, that he who makes
himself a friend to the one, does necessarily Iam. 4. 4. 1. Ioh. 2. 15.
become an enemy to the other; and if any man love the world, the love of the
Father is not in him. So our Savior tells us, that we cannot Math. 6. 24.
serve God, and Mammon, being Masters of such a contrary disposition, but we
shall hate the one, whilst we love the other; or else cleave to the one, and
forsake the other. Secondly, let us consider, that there is no great loss of
the worlds love, which does us little good; yea, no little hurt, seeing (like a
miery dog) the more it fawneth upon us, the more it defiles us; nor any great
harm, yea no small gain in the worlds hatred, seeing it does but so much the
more weane our hearts and affections from the love of earthly vanities, that
they may with more entireness cleave unto God, and be wholly fixed upon
spiritual and heavenly excellencies. Thirdly, let us remember, that the hatred
of the world has been from the beginning, the Genesis 3. 15.
portion of all Gods Saints and servants, whom it has pursued with deadly
malice, because they have been beloved of God. Yea, above all others did it
most hate and malign our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and therefore we must
not think much if it pursues us with the like malice. For as he has told us,
The servant is not greater then his Lord; If they have Joh. 15. 19, 20.
persecuted me, they will also persecute you. Fourthly, the worlds hatred
needs not to discourage us in the ways of godliness, seeing it is unto us a
comfortable evidence, that we are not of the world, for then it would love his
own, but that we are the true Disciples of Jesus Christ, whom he has chosen
out of the world. Yea contrariwise, if the world should love us, we had just
cause to suspect our selves, seeing love arises out of likeness; neither could
we be so much in the worlds favor, unless we too much favored it. Fifthly,
the worlds hatred cannot discourage us, if we consider, that it is abundantly
recompensed with the love of God, and of his Saints and blessed Angels. For the
worlds malice can but bring some temporary trouble, joined with much inward and
spiritual comfort, but in the favor of the Lord is life and blessedness. And
therefore Psalm. 30. 5.
as no wise man, who is highly in the favor of his Prince, his chief Nobles,
and the best of the people, will greatly care for the hatred of base
gally-slaues, and the abiects of the Land, especially when the favor of both
will not stand together: so if we be truly wise for our own good, we will not,
if we be assured of Gods love, and all his faithful servants, regard much the
hatred of the world, which can love none but those whom God hates. Finally,
this hatred of the world for righteousness sake, will not dismay us, if we
always remember, that it shall be rewarded with everlasting happiness,
according to that of our Savior, Blessed are Luke 6. 22, 23.
ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their
company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son
of man's sake; rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy; for behold, your
reward is great in heaven; for in the like manner did their fathers to the
Prophets.

. Sect. 3 That the former point ought to be held with diverse cautions.
But yet some cautions must be here observed: as first, that howsoever we are
not to love the world, nor to maintain near and inward familiarity Romans 12.
18.
with Gods enemies, yet in respect of our private carriage, we must behave our
selves innocently and justly toward them, and as the Apostle speaks (as much
as in us lies) have peace with all men. Secondly, we must so hate their
sins, their worldliness and profaneness, as that in the mean time we love
their persons, performing unto them all civil and religious duties, whereby we
may gain them to Christ, and be means (as much as in us lies) of their
conversion and salvation. Thirdly, that under color of hating the world, we
do not carry our selves cynically and harshly, peeuishly and contentiously
with those which remain still professed worldlings, but go forward in the
practice of all holy duties, with all meekness of conversation, opposing them
in nothing, but when they oppose us in piety and righteousness. For the world
is ready to hate us too much already, for our profession and practice of Gods
true Religion, though by our perverse behavior, and rigid stiffenesse, even
about things indifferent, we do not give it any cause to hate our persons. And
therefore let us avoid their error, who when they have taken upon them the
profession of Christian Religion, think themselves bound to profess open
enmity against all those who are contrary minded; and that they best approve
their Christianity, when as the fire of dissension, by their tart behavior, is
kindled between them, because Christ came to Math. 10. 34. Luke 12. 49.
bring a sword and fire upon the earth, and to set at variance, even those
which are of a man's family. For in many other places, we are earnestly
exhorted to use all meekness and love, that we may win them by our
conversation who are without, unless it be in the cause of God, and the
defense of his truth. And therefore that place of our Savior is not to be
understood so much of the doings of the faithful, whereby standing upon
terms of hostility, they should provoke the enemies of the Gospel against
them, but rather of their sufferings and persecutions, which for Christ's sake
and the Gospel they should endure at the hands of the wicked, though they
behaved themselves as meekly and mildly, as innocently and lovingly, as the
cause of God and defense of his truth would suffer them. Or if at all, of their
doings and oppositions against profane worldlings, yet not in such things,
wherein they might lawfully agree, but in matters weighty and important, as
concerning Gods glory and their own salvation; and not in spleen, and spite,
or private revenge, but when they have lawful authority to suppress their
fury, and curb in their malice; or by an open war, according to the Law of God
and Nations proclaimed against them. Finally, we must take heed, that we do
not esteem all them as worldlings, who go not as far as we in the
profession of Religion and the practice of holy duties; for there are
Christians of all sizes and ages, and as well babes as grown men in Gods
family. But those only are to be ranked in this number of worldly opposites,
who are professed enemies of Christian Religion, or only have the name of
Christians, but are in truth gross idolaters, or wickedly profane, who in
their lives deny the power of that truth, which they outwardly profess;
maligning and hating all those who love and fear God, even for their
godliness sake, and displaying their banners of impiety against all grace and
goodness. Neither do I think that formal Christians, who live ciuilly
amongst us, professing Christianity, and joining with us in the public
exercises of Religion, are to be reckoned amongst these worldlings, who oppose
us, and whom we oppose, though we cannot observe in them any signs of sound
conversion, or of the sincerity and power of godliness; (seeing our Savior
himself is said to have loved the young man, who yet had not so far proceeded
in the course Mark 10. 21.
of Christianity) but profane persons, lewd livers, notorious blasphemers,
professed scorners, and malicious opposers against the Professors and
practisers of Gods true Religion.

. Sect. 4 Of the false judgment of the world, showed in their bitter censures
of the godly.
And thus we may encourage our selves in the duties of a godly life, against
the hatred of the world and wicked men. Let us in the next place consider of
the fruits of this hatred, from which diverse impediments do arise, that hinder
many in the ways of godliness. And these are either internal in the mind
and judgment, or external in the words and actions: of the former sort there
are two notable hindrances and discouragements. The first is the false
judgment and erroneous opinion of wicked worldlings, showed in their hard and
harsh, bitter and uncharitable censures of the godly, whereby they condemn
their persons, and all the good graces of God in them, with all the virtuous
actions which are done by them, as evil and faulty. Their feruencie of
devotion in religious exercises, they judge to be gross hypocrisy; their
wisdom and Christian prudence, they repute wiliness and subtilty; their
simplicity, folly; their zeal, 2. King. 9. 11.
madness; their patience, Stoicall apathy and stupidity; their frugalitie,
niggardly avarice; their bounty, lavish wastfulnesse; their Christian
forbearance and long-suffring, pusillanimity and base cowardice; their
severity, cruelty; their resolute and absolute obedience to Gods Law, they
condemn as no better then rebellion against Princes and Magistrates; their
contempt of the world and earthly vanities, is reputed by them cynicall and
melancholic sottishness and folly. In a word, if we set our selves seriously
to please God, nothing that we can do will please the world, but all is taken
at the worst, and even our best virtues will be branded and blemished by their
unjust and uncharitable censures, as blameworthy and vicious. But that this may
not discourage us in our Christian courses, let us consider, that this has
been ever the portion of all Gods children, to be condemned by his enemies.
Thus the Prophets were censured to be opposites to Princes and States, the
Apostles to be seditious Matthew. 11. 18.
persons and brochers of novelties. John the Baptists abstinence Matthew. 26. 8.
and austerity was counted deuillish, Mary's love and bounty reputed needless
and lavish wastefulnesse. Yea, our Savior Christ himself escaped not these
false and unjust censures, but had his best actions blemished with the
malicious censures of wicked men. His miracles done by the virtue of his divine
nature, were deemed to be done by the power of Beel-zebub the prince of the
devils; For his benign sociablenesse, he was judged a boone-companion and a
friend to Publicanes and sinners; and all his gracious words, wrested and
misconstrued unto the worst sense, which wit and malice could give unto them.
And therefore if we will walk in their steps, we must look for the like
measure, which both our fellow servants, and our great Lord and Master have
found before us. Again, let us remember that we stand or fall to our own
Master; and as it will do us little good to be approved of the world, when he
condemns us, so as little hurt, to be condemned of the world, when God and
our consciences do approve and justify us. Finally, let us know to our
comfort, that the day will come, when all these unjust censures and sentences
pronounced by the mouths of malicious men, shall be wholly reuersed; and all
the sorrow and grief caused by them, swallowed up with rauishing joy, when we
shall hear that last sentence of approbation pronounced by our Lord and
Savior; Well done, good and faithful servant, etc. applauded Matthew. 25. 23.
by the acclamation of all the Saints and Angels.

. Sect. 5 Of worldly contempt, unto which the godly are liable.
The other impediment, whereby the world labors to discourage all that in
the sincerity of their hearts fear and serve God, is, to Mal. 3. 17.
have them above all other men in greatest contempt and basest esteem. For
whom God prizeth as his choysest Jewels, the world vilifieth as abiects and the
refuse of all things; whom the Lord honors with the glorious titles and
privileges of his own children, and heirs apparent to his heavenly Kingdom,
the world despises as men unworthy to live in any humane society. And no
sooner are they admitted into that holy and happy communion with God, and
fellowship of his Saints, but presently worldly and wicked men shun them as
unworthy their company. For as the unjust man is an abomination Pro. 29. 27.
to the just, so he that is upright in his way, is abomination to the wicked.
And this was that stumbling block, which being cast into the way, hindered many
of the Rulers from following Christ, and from embracing and professing that
truth, of which their consciences were convinced, because they feared, lest
hereby they should impeach their reputation, and expose themselves to the
contempt of their consorts, loving the praise of men, more then the praise of
God. This kept the parents Ioh. 12. 43. Joh. 9. 23.
of the blind man from confessing Christ, and justifying his miracle, because
the Jews had decreed, that if any man did confess that Jesus was Christ, he
should be put out of their Synagogue, and banished from their societies and
public assemblies. Which impediment if we would remove, we must learn to
esteem basely of the worlds estimate, and neither to think better of our
selves, when it honors us, nor worse, when it vilifieth and despises us. To
which purpose let us consider, that when we are for righteousness sake most
contemned in the eyes of the world, we are most magnified in the eyes of God;
and contrariwise, when we have most the applause of men in our evil courses,
we are esteemed of God most vile and abject, according to that of our Savior,
That which is highly esteemed amongst Luke 16. 15.
men, is abominable in the sight of God. Let us remember, that we cannot
immoderately affect the applause of men, and maintain faith and a good
conscience. For as our Savior demands: How can ye believe, Ioh. 5. 44.
which receive honor one of another, and seel: not the honor that comes
from God only? That we can never hold out constantly in our course of
Christianity, unless we can with the Apostle, esteem it a very small 1. Cor.
4. 3.
thing to be judged of man's judgment; and can be content with him, by honor
and dishonor, evil report and good report, to go forward in the duties 2.
Cor. 6. 8.
of a godly life, which if we perform with never so much diligence and zeal,
yet if therein we do not aim chiefly to please God more then men, we shall
not be the servants of Christ, but of the world, Gal. 1. 10.
seeing we will be willing to lay aside our profession and holy practice, when
the world censureth and condemns them. Let us know, that it will little
avail us at the day of death or judgment, to have had the approbation and
applause of men, when as God and our own consciences shall condemn us; nor be
any cause of grief at that day, when we call to mind, that for the pleasing
and honoring God in all Christian duties, we have displeased the world, and
brought our selves into contempt with men, when as the Lord and our own
consciences shall approve and justify us. Let us consider, that as the praise
and applause of men Matthew. 7. 1, 2.
is mutable and momentary, so likewise their contempt, disprayses and false
censures; of which we within a while shall be acquitted, and they being
repayed according to their own measure, shall be judged and condemned. The
which argument the Prophet uses to encourage us in this case: Harken unto me,
ye that know righteousness, the people Esaias 51. 7, 8.
in whose heart is my Law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be afraid
of their reuilings; for the Moth shall eat them up, as a garment, and the
Worm shall eat them up like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever,
and my salvation from generation to generation. Finally, let us remember, that
it has been always the lot of the Righteous, who have truly feared God, and
made conscience of all their ways, to be vilified and basely esteemed amongst
wicked worldlings. Thus the Israelites, because they served God according to
his will, by offering unto him such sacrifices as he required, were so contemned
and despised of the Genesis 43. 32.
idolatrous Egyptians, that they accounted it an abomination to eat with Genesis
43. 32.
them. Of this, the true Church complayneth, and against this it prays: Have
mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us, for we are exceedingly Psalm. 123.
3, 4.
filled with contempt. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of
those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud. So likewise David
complayneth; I am small and despised; yet do I not forget thy precepts. Psalm.
119. 141.
And the Apostle Paul speaking of himself, and of other Gods faithful
Ministers, says, that they were made and reputed as the filth of the 1. Cor.
4. 13.
world, and the off-scowring of all things. Which Saints and servants of God
we must be contented to accompany in their contempt and vile esteem, when by
the profession and practice of the truth we fall into it, if ever we mean to
accompany them in glory. Yea, our Savior Christ himself was content for our
sakes to be contemned and Esaias 53. 2, 3.
despised amongst men, as it was foretold by the Prophet, and whilst he
performed the duties of his calling, to be accounted a friend and companion of
Publicanes and sinners, yea, to be himself esteemed a notorious sinner; a
prophaner of the Sabbaths, whilst he healed on them; a Sorcerer, whilst he
did miracles; a Wine-bibber, whilst he consorted with sinners after a familiar
manner, that he might call them to repentance: and lastly, after a despised
life, to die a contemptible and reproachful death, even the death of the
Cross, and thereby to be numbered amongst the wicked. And therefore why should
the members look for honor and high esteem, where the Head was so scorned
and contemned? Why should we not for his sake deny our selves and our own
credit and reputation amongst men, who therefore despise us, because we deuote
our selves unto his service? Why should we not think such contempt our
chiefest glory, and the base esteem of the world sufficiently recompensed,
when we are dignified with the title of Gods servants and sons, and with
that precious account which he makes of us? Why should we not with patience
and joy, follow our Head in the same way, by Heb. 12. 2.
which he ascended unto glory, comforting our selves, according to his
example, against all contempt and reproach, by looking upon the joy which is set
before us?

CAP. VI.
Of external impediments whereby the world hinders us in the duties of a
godly life; and first, slanders and derision.

. Sect. 1 How we may be armed against the slanders of the world.
ANd these are the impediments, which are internal in the minds and
judgments of wicked worldlings. Those which are external, arise from their
words and actions. Concerning the former, the world seeks to discourage all
those which truly fear God in their profession and holy practice by their
contumelies and foul aspersions, slanders and reproaches. For when they have
nothing in truth to object against them, in respect of their holy and
unblameable conversation; then imitating their father the devil, who is a
false accuser of the brethren, they load them with calumnies and slanders,
either by laying to their charge the things which they never did, or reporting
things materially true after a false and malicious manner, that with these
obloquies and reproaches they may discourage them in their Christian courses,
and discountenance and disgrace even their best actions. Thus Ahab accused
Elias to be a troubler of Israel; and Amazias 1. King. 18. 17.
Amos to have conspired against the King in the midst of the house of Israel,
Amos 7. 10.
and that the Land was not able to bear his words. Thus they slaundered
Stephen, that he had spoken blasphemous words against Moses and against Act. 6.
11.
God. Paul and Silas, that they were troublers of the City and State, that
Act. 16. 20. and 17. 7. and 18. 13.
they did contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying, that there was another
King, one Jesus. That they persuaded men to worship God contrary to the Law.
That Act. 21. 28. and 24. 5.
they taught all men every where, against the People, Law and Temple, and had
polluted that holy place by bringing Greeks into it. And thus by Tertullus
they slaundered Paul, affirming that he was a pestilent fellow, and a mouer of
sedition among the Jews throughout the world, etc. Yea, so malignant are these
black mouths, that they dared to cast foul and false Matthew. 12* 24. and 26.
61. Luke 23. 2.
aspersions upon our Savior Christ himself, and blot and blemish the white
and pure robe of his innocence, with their unjust and reproachful calumnies.
And such measure his Saints and servants found at the hands of wicked men, in
the time of the persecuting Emperors; such have they found since, and shall
do unto the end of the world. Against which discouragemenst, if we would be
armed, we must remember, that this needs not to seem any strange thing unto
us, seeing our Savior Christ has foretold, that this should be the lot of all
his servants, to be reviled and slaundered for his sake and the Gospels. That
our Head and Lord has borne these reproaches for our sake, and therefore we
his members and servants must not think much, if we suffer the like for him
and his truth. That there was never any so dear unto God, nor innocent amongst
men, who have not been whipped with the scourge of malicious tongues; and
therefore we must not think to go alone upon earth, but must here bear them
company, if ever we hope to enjoy their society in that heavenly happiness.
Secondly, if we would not be discouraged with Nos modo id agamus, vt male de
nobis nemo loqui absque mendatio possit. Hieronym. ad Celantiam. 1. Pet. 3. 16.
and 2. 12.
the obloquies and slanders of wicked men, let us preserve our innocence, and
walk unblameably in this evil generation, taking great care so to carry our
selves in all Holiness and Righteousness of conversation, that no man may
speak evil of us without a lie; and so the testimony of a good conscience
will more comfort and support us in all our Christian courses, then the
slanders of wicked men shall be able to daunt and dismay us. And this is the
best way to convince them of falsehood, not only unto others, but even to their
own consciences, and even to make them like and love (if they belong unto God)
the Religion which we profess. Neither can any thing more powerfully beat
back these poisonous darts of slanderous reports, then the brestplate of
righteousness and integrity, so as they shall never wound our heart, though
for a time they may blemish the brightness of our fame. No verbal Apologies
can so clear and justify us, and convince our adversaries of fals-hood and
malice, as this real confutation of an innocent and unblameable life. Finally,
let us consider, that they are pronounced blessed by our Savior, who are thus
reviled and slandered unjustly and wrongfully; and the more we are thus
disgraced and dishonored in this life, the more we shall be advanced and
glorified in the life to come; In which regard there is no just cause of
mourning, when we are thus falsely traduced for Christ's sake and the Gospel:
Yea, rather we should rejoice and be exceeding glad, because our reward is
great in heaven, Matthew. 5. 11, 12
as our Savior has taught us.

. Sect. 2 Of derision and scoffs, which the world uses to discourage the
godly.
The second impediment is the derision, scoffs and scorns of wicked
worldlings, whereby they disgrace the persons of the godly, and discountenance
and discourage them in all religious and holy duties. The which they do either
by their words, as in taunting speeches, making a jest of their profession and
holy practice, their hearing; reading, and studying of the Scriptures, praying,
godly communication, and such religious exercises; or by branding them with
opprobrious names, as Lollards, Hugonotes, Puritans, Sectaries, Bible-bearers,
Holy brethren and such like; or else by scornful gestures, as nodding,
shaking the head, mowing, ieering, laughing at them, and the like. The which is
a great impediment that hinders many (especially such as are of mild, modest
and ingenuous natures) from making any outward profession of Gods true
Religion, and performing of any religious exercises; or at least, to proceed in
them with much discouragement and disquietnesse of mind; as appears by those
pitiful complaints which they have from time to time made unto God, of these
indignities offered unto them by their spiteful adversaries. Thus the Church
complains, that Gods enemies did hiss and gnash their teeth against Lam. 2.
16. and 3. 14.
them; that they were a derision to all the people, and their song all the day.
And that in their bitter mourning and day of affliction, they in a taunting
manner required of them, that they would be merry and sing one of the Psalm. 137.
3.
songs of Sion. That they were become a reproach to their neighbors, a scorn
and derision to them that were round about them. That they were made a byword
Psalm. 79. 4.
among the Heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. Thus Job
complayneth; I am as one mocked of his neighbor, who calls upon God, and he
answers Psalm. 119. 5. and 35, 16.
him: The just and upright man is laughed to scorn. So David: The proud have
had me greatly in derision, with hypocritical mockers at feasts they gnashed
upon me with their teeth. They that did sit in the gate, spoke against me,
Psalm. 69. 12.
and I was the song of the drunkards. And speaking of himself as a tipe of
Christ, he says; All they that see me, laugh me to scorn, they shoot out the
lip Psalm. 22. 7.
and shake the head. By this, Jobs misery was much aggrauated, when as wicked
Job 30. 9.
men made him their song and byword. And Jeremy brought to such impatience,
that he resolved to speak no more in the name of the Lord, because he was in
derision daily, and every one reproched and mocked him. Ier. 20. 7, 8.


. Sect. 3 How we may be armed against the derisions, and scorns of worldlings.
But howsoever this is a great and grievous tentation, yet we must take heed
that we be not so discouraged thereby, as to desist, or so much as slacken our
pace in the ways of godliness; but though we sometime stumble at it a and
catch a fall, yet we must not lie still and quite give over our profession and
holy practice, but rise up again, and go in our course with renewed
resolution: According to the example of the Church of God, who though they were
somewhat daunted and grieved with the scoffs and derisions of the wicked, yet
they Psalm. 44. 13, 17, 18.
did not forget God, nor deal falsely in his covenants; Their heart turned not
back, neither did their steps turn from his way. And of holy David, who
professes, that though the proud had him greatly in derision, yet he Psalm.
119. 51.
declyned not from Gods Law. Unto which resolution that we may attain, let us
consider first, that herein no new thing does betide us, but that which all
Gods Saints and servants have suffered at the hands of the wicked from time to
time. For thus Ismael derided Isaac, and Genesis 21 9.
(as it is probable) the promises of God made unto him, and all the faithful
in his seed. Michol scoffed at the zeal of holy David, 2 Samuel 6. 16.
when she saw him dancing before the Arc. Thus the Israelites scorned Gods
Prophets and messengers that spoke unto them in the Word 2. Chro. 36. 15, 16.
of the Lord: And made themselves sport with Ezechiels Sermons, Ezekiel 33. 32.
as if he had been some pleasant Musician. Finally, thus Sanballat Neh. 4. 1,
4.
and Tobiah derided Nehemiah and the Jews, when they set them seriously to do
the work of the Lord. And the Jews scoffed at the Act. 2. 13.
Apostles, when they spoke with strange tongues the wonderful works of God,
as though they had been drunk with new wine. Yea, our Savior Christ
himself, in whom all gravity and wisdom shined, and in whose actions Might
and Majesty, Grace and Goodness clearly appeared, was notwithstanding no whit
privileged and exempted from the derision and scorns of wicked worldlings.
For the Pharisees laughed at his divine Sermons. Herod and the soldiers in
scorn clothe him in white and purple, crown him with thorns, bow the knee
before him, and flowtingly salute him as King of the Jews. yea, in his bitter
passion (which he suffering as innocent, Luke 23. 13.
should have drawn from all men even tears of blood) they sported themselves,
nodded their heads, and made themselves merry with his lamentable cry and
pitiful complaint, My God, my God, Matthew. ^7. 27. to 4^. Luke 23. 31. Matthew.
10. 24, 25.
why have thou forsaken me? Now if they have done these things to a green
tree, fruitful in all grace and goodness, what will they do to a dry and
barraine? If they have thus scoffed and derided our Lord and Master, let us
not, who are his poor and unworthy servants, think much to be thus used: If
he have suffered all these taunts and scorns for our sakes, why should we
think it much, to suffer with patience and joy the like or greater (if it were
possible) for his sake and the Gospels? Yea, if he have meekely borne our
sins and sorrows, and shed his precious blood, and endured the heavy wrath
of God due unto us, that he might save and deliver us out of the hands of all
our enemies; how ungrateful are we for all his love, if we will not for his
sake endure a taunt, a spiteful scorn or reproachful name, but choose rather
to neglect the duties of his service, and to run with wicked worldlings unto
the same excess of riot? So often therefore as the scoffs of profane men
discourage and dis-hearten us in Christian duties, let us animate and
strengthen our resolutions in them, by looking, with the eye of faith, upon our
Savior Christ, hanging naked upon the Cross, and dying a shameful death for
our sins, contemning this disgrace, and swallowing up this shame with the
infiniteness of his love. Let us be content to accompany him in despising
these despites, that we may also accompany him in glory and happiness;
according to that of the Apostle; Let us run with patience, the race which is
set before Heb. 12. 2, 3.
us, looking unto Jesus, the Author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy
that was set before him, endured the Cross, despised the shame, and is set
down at the right hand of the Throne of God. For consider him that endured
such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest we be weary and faint in
our minds.

. Sect. 4 Of the necessity of Christian Apology and profession of the truth.
Secondly, let us consider, that this Christian apology in the profession of
the truth, and practice of all holy and Christian duties, is a matter of Luke
9. 23.
urgent necessity, which as nearly concerns us, as the everlasting salvation
of our souls. For they that will be Christ's Disciples, must take up their
cross daily, and follow him; and be contented, for his sake and the Gospels,
to forsake kindred and friends, houses, lands, and life it self, if they be
called thereunto. Now how shall we with patience and constancy endure for
Christ's sake, wounds and stabs, if we shrink for words and scoffs? How shall
we ever hope to suffer rackes and gibbets, fire and sword, for the profession
of the truth, and the practice of Christian duties; if we be daunted with every
small disgrace, and discouraged in them with reproachful names, and scornful
taunts? Let us think with our selves, that if we cannot endure causeless
shame before men, which is accompanied with true glory, how shall we be able to
bear that everlasting shame and confusion of face, when as Christ shall be
ashamed to acknowledge Math. 10. 33. Mark. 8. 38.
us for his, before his Father, his holy Saints, and blessed Angels, because we
have been ashamed of him and his truth? Now that we may perform this duty,
which is so necessary, with cheerfulness and delight, and contemn the
derisions and scornings of graceless men, when they scoff at us for the
performance of Christian duties, blushing for shame that we should be thus
ashamed; let us consider, that when we are most derided of the wicked world,
for the conscionable performance of any Christian duties, we are then most
approved of God; and therefore when they seek to daunt us with their scoffs,
and to drive us from our Christian hold with gibes and reproaches; let us oppose
this as a shield of strength against them, saying unto our souls, My defense
is Psalm. 7. 10.
of God, who saves the upright in heart. Let us comfort and cheer our selves
with the peaceable testimony of a good conscience, and our inward joy in
well-doing; and with the applause of the holy Angels who look upon us, and the
approbation and praise of all that fear God. Let us remember, that they are
pronounced blessed by our Savior, who are Mat. 5. 10, 11. Luke 6. 22.
thus abused for righteousness sake, and that they shall reign with him in
his glory, who have suffered with him in these disgraces: that then, for Esa.
61. 7.
their shame, they shall receive double honor, and for confusion, they shall
rejoice in their portion, and everlasting joy shall be unto them. In which
respect, the Apostle Peter exhorts us to rejoice, in as much as we are
partakers of Christ's 1. Pet. 4. 14.
sufferings, that when his glory shall be revealed, we may be glad also with
exceeding joy. And therefore let no scoffs and scorns discourage us, but let
us, with the Apostle, approve our selves in all things, by honor, and
dishonor, 2. Cor. 6. 8.
evil report, and good report; and accompany our Savior Christ bearing his
Heb. 13. 13, 14.
reproach, that we may accompany him in glory; for we have here no abiding
City, but we seek one to come, as the Apostle speaks.

CAP. VII.
Of worldly persecutions, and how we may be strengthened against them.

. Sect. 1 Of the worlds cruelty, in persecuting the godly.
WE have showed in the former Chapters, what impediments the world, and wicked
men cast in the way, to hinder our profession and practice of the true
Religion, which respect their judgment and affections, their words and outward
gestures: and now we are to entreat of those which respect their works and
actions. And these are their contumelious and malicious handling of them, and
the bitter persecutions which they raise against them, that they may either
hinder them wholly from proceeding in the course of Christianity, or at least
cause them to go on with much discouragement and discomfort. The which
contumelies and persecutions are great and manifold; as the pursuing of them
with all malice and extremity, from place to place, apprehending them as
malefactors, haling them before their Judgment seats, false accusations,
unjust condemnations, imprisonments, and banishments, fire and sword, tortures
and punishments, executed and inflicted in the most exquisite manner which wit
and malice can devise and impose. And this malicious rage of wicked men, the
Prophet Esaias in lively manner expresses: The act of violence (says he) is in
Esa. 59. 6, 7, 8.
their hands; Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shead innocent
blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, wasting and destruction are in
their paths. The way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment in their
goings. Neither does the world use such spite and spleen toward the most
outrageous offender that ever lived, as it does to the Saints and servants of
God, for the truth sake. For toward them oftentimes it quite blunteth the
point and edge of humane laws, and commonly moderateth and mitigateth the
extreme rigor of them in their punishments; but against the faithful it
sharpeneth the point and edge where none is; yea, deuiseth new laws, when the
old restrain their malice. And whereas they content themselves with those
punishments which the laws determine against the most notorious and heinous
offenders, and when they are forced for the safety and preservation of humane
societies to execute them, they do it as the Law requires, and oftentimes
with some pity and compassion: contrariwise, when they have to do with those,
who being Gods faithful servants, have made themselves liable to their laws,
they sport themselves in their torments, and out of mere malice to them for
their Religion and piety, they execute the Laws with all savage cruelty,
adding both by their words and actions, many outrages over and above those
punishments which the Law requires; as we see in the example of our Savior
Christ, and the thieves crucified with him. For whereas they contented
themselves with their simple death, without any additaments of malice, they
could never satisfy their spiteful rage, in vexing and tormenting our Savior
Christ, but used him with all contumelious reproach, spitting upon, and
buffetting him, scourging and crowning him with thorns, scoffing and deriding
him, mocking and moing at him, giving unto him when he thirsted, gall and
vinegar, and insulting over him in mirth and triumph, when they saw the bitter
anguish of his soul. The which also is to be observed in the examples of those
punishments which have been inflicted upon most heinous malefactors; as
murderers, traitors, paricides, and upon the innocent Martyrs of Jesus Christ,
if we compare the one with the other. Of which, no other reason can be given,
but that the world loves her own, and hates those which belong unto God,
affecting the persons of wicked men, and setting themselves only against their
crimes, not out of any love toward God, or simple hatred of their sins, as
being transgressions of his Laws; but out of self love, because their
offenses are against humane laws, which if they should not be preserved and
maintained, observed and obeyed, societies could not subsist, nor the safety
and welfare of their own estates be otherwise vpheld. Whereas contrariwise,
it maligneth and hates even the very persons of the godly, as being the
members of Jesus Christ, only for their profession of Religion, and practice
of holy duties, and in these respects can never sufficiently disgorge its
malice against them.

. Sect. 2 That it has always been the lot of the godly to be persecuted in
the world.
Now the means to remove the former impediments, are manifold. The first is,
to consider, that it has always, from the beginning of the world, been the
lot of Gods children, to be persecuted of the wicked; in which regard it is
unto us a notable and comfortable evidence, that we love God, and are beloved
of him, when the wicked world maligneth and pursues us with all rage and
cruelty, for righteousness sake. For thus Cain persecuted Abel, because his
service was accepted of God. Thus Pharaoh and the Egyptians raged against the
Israelites, when they did but make mention of going into the Wilderness to
offer sacrifice. Thus the wicked Kings, and more wicked Priests, persecuted
Gods true Prophets; the Scribes and Pharisees, the Apostles of Jesus Christ; the
idolatrous Emperors, the Christians of the Primitive Church; and the limbs of
Antichrist, the holy Martyrs, because they professed Gods true Religion, and
brought forth the fruits of it in their holy practice. More particularly, David
often professes, that he was maligned by his wicked enemies without cause,
only because he did that which was good, and sought in all his courses to be
approved of God. And the Apostle Paul in many 2. Cor. 11. 23, 24, etc.
words sets down the grievous persecutions which he often suffered at
their hands, who were enemies to Gods truth. But as these holy Saints of God
were not by all these persecutions discouraged in their course of godliness;
but the more boysterously the storms of malicious rage blowed against them,
the more firmly and constantly they held the cloak of their Christian
profession and holy practice; according to that of David; Many are my
persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from Psalm. 119. 157.
thy testimonies: so must we do in this case, following their good example, if
we would have any comfortable assurance that God will think us worthy to be
ranked in this number. And this argument, taken from these examples, our
Savior uses to arm his Disciples against this discouragement: Rejoice (says
he) and be exceeding glad, seeing your reward is great in Mat. 5. 12.
heaven: for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you. Yea, our
Savior Christ himself has begun to us, that we may not fear to pledge him,
and has drunk the deepest draught in this bitter cup of worldly persecutions.
For what mischief could hell it self raise up out of her infernal bowels,
what cruel rage and exquisite vexations and torments could malicious wit
devise, which were not inflicted upon this innocent Lamb, the Lord our
righteousness? Now what can be a more effectual reason to move us with all
patience and cheerfulness, to endure the greatest extremities for Christ's
sake, then to remember what grievous torments he has suffered for us, who were
strangers and enemies unto God, and the children of wrath as well as others?
For if our great and glorious General, and Sovereign King, has thus exposed
himself to the extremest dangers, and thrust himself into the thickest crowd
of enemies, where he has received grisly and mortal wounds, that he might
rescue and recover us, who were taken captive by them, and set us at liberty;
how valiantly should we fight his battles, even unto blood, against the enemies
of our salvation, especially considering, that he looks upon us, incourageth
us to the fight, supporteth and strengthens us with his grace and holy
Spirit, defends and succoureth us when we are ouer-matched, raises us up
when we are foiled, and holds in his hand the Crown of victory, being ready
to set it upon our heads, when we have finished the fight? And this argument
our Savior uses to encourage us in all our sufferings and persecutions:
Remember (says he) the word that I said unto Joh. 15. 20.
you; The servant is not greater then his Lord. If they have persecuted me,
they will also persecute you. And so likewise the Apostle Peter; For as much
then 1. Pet. 4. 1.
(says he) as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm your selves
likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh, has
ceased from sin, etc. The which our persecutions we may well suffer with
greater patience and comfort, if we consider, that they are not punishments for
our sins, from all which, Christ has fully freed us, but the trials of our
faith, which being approved, shall be crowned with everlasting joy and
happiness. In which regard we have cause greatly to rejoice (as the Apostle
Peter speaks) 1. Pet. 1. 6, 7.
though now for a season (if need be) we are in heaviness, through manifold
tentations; that the trial of our faith, being much more precious then the
gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise,
and honor, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ. So the Apostle James,
My Iam. 1. 2, 12.
brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into diverse tentations; of which he
afterward renders this reason, Because blessed is the man that indureth
tentation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the Crown of life, which the
Lord has promised to them that love him. And indeed, what a wonderful
privilege is this? and what great cause does it minister unto us of comfort
and rejoicing, when we consider that the Lord has vouchsafed unto us this
great honor, to suffer afflictions for his own glory, and the furthering and
assuring of our salvation, when as he might have justly inflicted them, and
far greater upon us for our sins, and to the burden of our sufferings,
have deservedly added the uncomfortable weight of shame and infamy? All which
blessed privileges we shall lose, and run into the contrary mischiefs, and
even hellish condemnation, if we shrink from our profession and holy practice,
for fear of persecution, and refuse to suffer for his sake, who has suffered
so much for us. For he that loves his life, shall Ioh. 12. 25.
lose it; and he that hates his life in this world, shall keep it unto life
eternal. And again, If any man come to me (says our Savior) and hate not
his father Luke 14. 26, 27.
and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and sisters, and his own life
also (namely, when they come in comparison with Christ, and when the love of
both cannot stand together) he cannot be my Disciple. And whosoever does not
hear his cross and come unto me, cannot be my Disciple.

. Sect. 3 That our Savior has foretold these persecutions.
Secondly, let us consider that our Savior Christ has long ago foretold,
that whosoever will be his Disciples, must suffer in this world troubles and
persecutions, and that those who will attain unto heavenly happiness, must
travail unto it by that afflicted way which himself and all his servants have
gone before them. If any man (says he) will come after me, Luke 9. 23, 24, 25
let him deny himself, and take up his Cross daily and follow me. For
whosoever Mat. 16. 24, 25.
will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my
sake, shall save it. Now what is a man aduantaged, if he gain the whole world,
and lose himself, or be cast away? So the Apostles first offered the Cross
unto them, who Act. 14. 22.
would afterward wear the Crown, and have told us beforehand, that by many
tribulations we must enter into the Kingdom of God. And that whosoever 2. Tim.
3. 12. Luke 14. 27, 28, etc.
will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution. And therefore our
Savior Christ seriously advises us, that before we take upon us the
profession of Christianity, we first sit down and cast up our accounts,
examining our selves, whether we can be content to suffer with him, that we
may afterward reign with him; and to endure afflictions and persecutions in
this world, that we may eternally triumph with him in glory and happiness in
the world to come. Now what more fair dealing could be used, then to tell us
beforehand what we must trust to, and before he entertain us into his
service, to acquaint us thoroughly with our work which he requires of us,
before we can receive our wages which we expect from him? If indeed he had
allured us to serve him, by promising that we should enjoy pleasures, riches,
and honors in the world, and that for his sake we should be well accepted
and favored of all men, we should have had great cause of discouragement,
when we should come so far short of our hopes, and find nothing in the
world but crosses and afflictions, pains for pleasures, poverty for riches,
and for glory, shame and disgrace; for then seeing his promises fail in things
that concern this life, we had cause to doubt of those that respect the life
to come. But now contrariwise, seeing he has foretold, that we must in this
world suffer troubles and persecutions, and be hated of all men for his Name
sake, and that afterward, when by our patient suffering we have approved our
says and love toward him, he will crown these his graces in us with joy and
happiness in the life to come; our afflictions and persecutions should not
daunt and dismay us; yea, rather we should rejoice in them, as the infallible
signs of our future hopes, for having found Christ's Word verified in the first
part of his predictions, respecting our afflictions, and persecutions, we may
undoubtedly expect, that we shall find it also true in that part which
concerns our crown of victory and heavenly joys, which after our momentany
sufferings, we shall everlastingly possess, according to the gracious promises
which he has made unto us.

. Sect. 4 That worldly persecutions cannot greatly hurt us.
Thirdly, let us encourage our selves against these persecutions, because they
cannot greatly hurt us; for first, they are either light and easy, if they be
long and tedious; or short and momentany, if they be sharp and grievous. For
God has graciously so composed and framed our natures, that their frailty and
weakness cannot hold out to bear any heavy burdens, and has made them
mortal and of such short continuance, that their afflictions and grieuances
must needs be short and momentany. Secondly, the greatest persecutions which
rage and malice can raise against us, can but reach unto the body, and only
extend to the time of this life; but cannot at all hurt the soul, nor hinder
our happiness in the life to come. In which respect, our Savior incourageth
us against these persecutions; Fear not them which kill the body, but are not
able to kill the soul, but Mat. 10. 28.
rather fear him who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell. Thirdly,
these persecutions cannot much hurt us, because our gracious God keeps and
preserves us, so as we cannot faint and fall, and pulls out their sting, so
as they shall never be able to give unto us any mortal wounds. And therefore
as the Apostle Peter exhorts, Let them that suffer according 1. Pet. 4. 19.
to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing,
as unto a faithful Creator. Fourthly, because in our sharpest persecutions we
are so inwardly comforted with the consolation of Gods Spirit, that in our
greatest sufferings our joy may well exceed our grief. For as the 2. Cor. 1. 5.
sufferings of Christ abound in us, so also our consolation abounds by
Christ; as the Apostle found in his own experience. And this is that lasting
and full joy that our Savior promised to give, and so to continue it unto us,
Ioh. 15. 11.
that no man should be able to take it from us. This is that joy which causes
us to rejoice in tribulation, singing unto God with Paul and Silas Psalms of
praise, when our backs are torn with stripes, and our feet Act. 16. 25.
fastened in the stocks.

. Sect. 5 Of the patience which the Saints have showed in suffering
persecutions.
Fourthly, let us encourage and comfort our selves against all persecutions, by
remembering the patience and meekness, the joy and thankfulness which the
Saints and holy Martyrs of God have showed, in suffering all crosses and
calamities, tortures and grievous pains which the wicked world could inflict
upon them. For well may we go forward in this afflicted way with joy and
comfort, when as we have the Word of God to be our guide, the holy Martyrs of
former ages, as precedents for our imitation, and the faithful that now live
with us, to bear us company. Thus we read that the Apostles rejoiced, that
they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the Name of Christ. Thus the
Saints took joyfully the spoiling of their Act. 5. 41.
goods, knowing in themselves that they had in heaven, a better and more
enduring Heb. 10. 34.
substance. And when they were tortured, accepted not deliverance, that they
might obtain a better resurrection. Others had trial of cruel mockings Heb.
11. 35, 36.
and scourgings, bonds and imprisonment: They were stoned, sawne in sunder,
tempted and slain with the sword, etc. And thus the holy Martyrs of the
Primitive Church, and of later days, even tired their tormentors with their
patience and constancy, out-faced their most bitter tortures with their
cheerful countenances, rejoiced in the scorching flames, and even before they
died, triumphed over death. And therefore (as the Apostle exhorts) seeing we
are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us Heb. 12. 1.
lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let
us run with patience unto the race that is set before us, etc.

. Sect. 6 That our persecutions for righteousness sake shall be richly
rewarded.
Fifthly, let us consider the great and rich rewards which are given graciously
unto all those who suffer for the truth and righteousness sake. For Phil. 1.
29.
first, in it self it is an high and holy privilege, to suffer any thing for
the name of Christ, which the Apostle makes a higher degree of dignity then
simply to believe in him to justification, which is common to ordinary
Christians; For unto you (says he) it is given in the behalf of Christ, not
only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; which is a
prerogative peculiar to the holy Martyrs. In which regard, the Apostle James
would have us to account it not an ordinary matter of common rejoicing, but of
exceeding joy, when we are thus tempted and tried. But how Iam. 1. 2.
much more have we cause of unspeakable joy in our greatest afflictions and
persecutions, if we consider the present comfort which we feel in conscience
of well-doing, and the inward peace and joy in the holy Ghost, which always
accompany our sufferings, for the profession of the truth, and practice of holy
duties; and the future rewards which God has promised to all that endure them
with constancy and patience? For if we lose this life which is mortal and
momentany, we shall in lieu thereof find such an one as is immortal and
everlasting; If we suffer with Christ, we shall Ioh. 12. 35.
also reign with him. If we be persecuted for righteousness sake, we are by
Christ's 2. Tim. 2. 12.
own mouth pronounced blessed, because the Kingdom of heaven belongs Mat.
5. 10.
unto us. So the Apostle Peter; If ye suffer for righteousness sake, 1. Pet.
3. 14.
happy are ye, and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled: yea,
rather as our Savior exhorts; Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is
your Mat. 5. 11.
reward in heaven. And the Apostle Peter likewise wills us to rejoice, in as
1. Pet. 4. 13.
much as we are partakers of Christ's sufferings, because when his glory shall
be revealed, we shall be glad also with exceeding joy. And surely, if we
consider well of it, there can be no greater cause of sound rejoicing, seeing
there is no comparison between our present sorrows, and future joys;
between our smart of afflictions, and solace of heavenly delight, either in
their quantity or continuance, according to that of the Apostle, I reckon that
Romans 8. 18.
the sufferings of the present time, are not worthy to be compared with the
glory which shall be revealed in us; for after that we have suffered but a
little while, 1. Pet. 5. 10.
God will call us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus; and as the Apostle
speaks, These light and momentany afflictions, shall cause unto us a far
more 2. Cor. 4. 17.
exceeding and eternal weight of glory. And therefore let us not look to the
sorrowful seed-time, but to the joyful harvest; not to our present labors,
but to our Sabbath of rest; not to our bleeding wounds in the Christian
Warfare, but to our victory and everlasting triumph; not to the fire and
faggot, gibbet and sword, but to the glorious Crown, which Apoc. 2. 10.
shall be set upon his head that fights unto the death. Let us look to
Jesus, Heb. 12. 2.
the Author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him,
endured the Cross, despising the shame, and is now set down at the right hand
of the Throne of God; that so following his example, we may partake with him
in joy and happiness. On the other side, let us set before us, the dreadful
estate of those men at the day of Judgment, who either to please men, or to
gain their worldly ends, or finally, for fear of punishment, have denied
Christ and his Truth, either verbally with their mouths, or really in their
actions. For amongst other desperate sinners, the fearful Apoc. 21. 8.
shall be rejected of Christ, and have their portion in that lake which burns
with fire and brimstone. And as they have denied him before men, so he will
Mat. 10. 33, 34. and 7. 23.
deny them before his Father in heaven; saying, Depart from me, ye workers of
iniquity; I know ye not. Suppose therefore that we could by neglecting all
Christian duties, attain unto the honors, riches, and pleasures of the earth,
which men so eagerly hunt after, yet alas, what inestimable loss is in this
purchase? for as our Savior speaks; What will it profit us to gain the
whole world, and lose our own souls? Mark. 8. 36.


CAP. VIII.
Of the impediments of a godly life, which arise from scandals and offenses.

. Sect. 1 The first scandal arising from the prosperity of the wicked.
ANd thus have I showed what are the usual impediments which the world and
worldly men use to hinder us in the ways of godliness, both in respect of
their judgment and affections, their words and actions. Now we are to entreat
of such as arise from scandals and offenses, which they commonly cast in our
way, as stumbling blocks, to discourage us in the course of Christianity. The
first whereof, is the flourishing estate of wicked worldlings, who prosper in
their sinful courses, and abound in riches, honors, and pleasures, as though
they were highly in Gods favor, and were approved of him in all their
courses, seeing they enjoy above all others, so many testimonies of his love,
and exceed all other men in outward blessings. And this the wise Solomon
observed in his time: There is (says he) a vanity which is done upon the
earth; that there Eccles. 8. 14. and 9. 1, 2.
be just men, to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked;
again, there be wicked men, to whom it happens according to the work of the
righteous; I said that this also is vanity. This was it which had almost made
holy David's foot to slip, to offend against the generation of Gods children,
and to Psalm. 73. 2, 3, 13, 15.
conclude, that he had cleansed his heart, and washed his hands in innocence in
vain, when he observed the great prosperity of the wicked, and how they
thriued in all their courses. This brought Jeremy to a stand, and made him so
bold as to reason the matter with God, concerning the administration of his
righteous Judgments; Wherefore (says he) does the way of Ier. 12. 1, 2.
the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very trecherously?
Thou have planted them; yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring
forth fruit: Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. But
this impediment we shall easily remove, if with David we will go into Gods
Sanctuary; for there we shall understand their end: namely, that God has set
them in slippery places, from which he casts them Psalm. 73. 17, 18.
dwone into destruction. And this truth we may confirm unto our selves, not
only by our own daily observation, but also by the experience of the faithful,
who have gone before us, and have raised up their hearts with comfort, after
that they had stumbled at this stone of offense. I have seen (says David) the
wicked in great power, and spreading himself Psalm. 37. 35, 36, 37.
like a green Bay tree. Yet he passed away, and lo, he was not; yea I sought
him, but he could not be found. And contrariwise; Mark the perfect man, and
behold the upright; for (howsoever his beginnings may be embittered with
afflictions, yet) the end of that man is peace. But the transgressors shall be
destroyed together; and the end of the wicked shall be cut off. So out of his
wise experience Solomon thus concludes, Though a sinner do evil an hundred
times, and his days be prolonged, yet Eccles. 8. 12, 13.
surely I know it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before
him. But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his
days, which are a shadow, because he fears not before God. Again, let us
consider, that the wicked in this life have with Dives all their good, the Luke
16. 25.
which through their abuse turns to their great evil, fatting them for the
day of slaughter, and serving unto them as occasions and instruments of sin,
do but increase their fearful condemnation. Let us remember that they have
their portion in this life, having their Psalm. 17. 14.
bellies filled with Gods hid treasure, and no further joy remains unto them,
but this which is so mutable and momentany; whereas the Lord has far better
things in store for his own children and servants, even permanent riches and
honors, and pleasures at his own right hand for euer-more. And therefore we
need not to envy the happiness of these slaves, nor to be discouraged in the
service of our heavenly Father, though for the present they have more to spend
in their riotous courses then we; seeing though in the time of our nonage, he
gives unto us but some short allowance, because through childish folly we are
apt to abuse greater plenty, and to accompany them in the same excess; yet he
reserueth better things in store for us, even our heavenly inheritance, glory
without disgrace, riches and treasures which fade not, and rauishing delights
which shall continue for evermore.

. Sect. 2 The second scandal arising from judgment deferred.
The second scandal and offense, is that delay which God seems to make in
the administration of his Judgments, and dispensation of his benefits and
rewards. For first, when wicked men multiply their sins, and yet escape
deserved punishment, they begin to doubt whether there be any providence, and
so let the reins loose to all manner of wickedness: According to that of the
Preacher, Because Eccl. 8. 11.
sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily; therefore the hearts
of the children of men are fully set in them to do evil. And Gods children
likewise stumble at this stone of offense, being tempted to think that there
is no gain in godliness, and little profit in being more diligent then others
in the duties of Gods service, when as they observe that there is, in respect
of outward things, no assurance of love or hatred, nor any difference between
one and another, seeing all things come Eccl. 9. 1, 2.
alike to all, and there is one event to the righteous and the wicked, to the
good and to the clean, and to the unclean, to him that sacrifices, and to
him that sacrifices not. As is the good, so is the sinner, and he that
swears, as he that fears an oath. But this tentation and stumbling block I
have before removed; only let us remember, that Gods Judgments like himself
are eternal, and that he gives such rewards to the godly, and inflicteth such
punishments upon the wicked as are endless and everlasting. In which respect,
a thousand years are with God but as one day, as the Apostle 2. Pet. 3. 8.
speaks; and the benefits and afflictions of the longest liver, nothing in
comparison of future joys and miseries. And therefore the greatest prosperity
of wicked men should not encourage any to follow their sinful courses, seeing
it shall soon have an end, and bring with it endless punishments. Neither
should the longest and greatest afflictions discourage us in the duties of a
godly life, seeing they are but light and momentany, in respect of that
eternal weight of Glory, which they shall 2. Cor. 4. 17.
cause unto us. Let us consider, that though the Lord deferreth long to execute
his Judgments, yet those that abuse this patience and long-suffring, shall not
escape in the end, and the longer that vengeance has been delayed, the more
fearful and intolerable will it be when it is inflicted. For though God
comes slowly, yet he pays surely, and the longer that he is fetching his
stroke, the more heavily will it light upon those who do not prevent it by
their repentance. Finally, let us know, that wicked men, when they seem most
to flourish in the world, do not, even in this life, escape unpunished. For if
they be not haunted with those hellish furies, the terrors and torments of a
selfe-accusing conscience, which gives them inwardly many a cold pang, when
they smile and laugh in the face and outward appearance; they are not free from
more dangerous and desperate punishments, though they be less sensible and
smarting, even the deadly lethargy of carnal security, and that scarce
cureable disease of a feared conscience and hardness of heart. Neither ought
we to be any more discouraged, because God seems wholly to defer the
bestowing of his rewards upon those that serve him, unto another life, and
because in the mean time godliness brings little gain, and the service of
God small profit in the world. For suppose that this were so, yet the riches
and eternity of the reward, will, when it is bestowed, abundantly recompense
our short forbearance. And therefore, if the most covetous usurers can with
patience forbear the sight and fruition of their gold, which notwithstanding
is that dearely-beloued idol, upon which their hearts are fixed; and can
satisfy both their eyes and minds with the sight and perusal of their bonds,
which assure them, that at the years end, they shall receive it with some
advantage, though it be but ten in the hundred; why should not we with joy
and comfort perform service unto God, though he should wholly defer the
rewards which he has promised, even unto the end of our lives; seeing we have
a most sure Play Master, who has couenanted to give, in lieu of our
forbearance, an hundred for ten, yea, a thousand for one, and has committed
to our keeping infallible bonds and evidences sealed with the blood of Christ,
and ratified with his oath, with the daily reviewing whereof, we may continually
revive and refresh our drooping and fainting souls? But if we be so sensual,
that we only mind things present, and prefer small possessions, before the
greatest possibilities, and richest reuersions, let us further know, that even
in this life God rewards his servants with gifts of incomparable greater
value, then those which worldlings can most brag off. For besides that the
godly are in respect of outward things, at Gods finding, who will never suffer
them to want such a convenient competencie, as in his infinite Wisdom he
knows to be fittest for them; and though he gives not unto them such
superfluity and abundance, as many worldlings do possess, because he knows,
that it would rather be a burden to press them down unto the earth, then a
benefit to further them in the way to heavenly happiness, yet he gives them
sufficiency and contentation of mind, which the other want in their greatest
plenty: Besides all this (I say) he bestows upon them all the Royal
privileges, whereof I have already spoken, especially the assurance of his
love and their salvation, with all other spiritual graces, peace of
Conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, as before I have showed more at large.

. Sect. 3 The third scandal arising from hypocrites.
The last scandal and offense, whereof I will speak, by which men are hindered
from entering into, and proceeding in the duties of a godly life, arises from
those that make profession of Christianity and sincerity, whether they be
private persons, or public, as the Ministers of the Word and Sacraments. The
first is that which is given by hypocrites, who making profession of the true
Religion, do in their lives deny the power thereof, falling into many gross
and grievous sins; especially such as are committed against the second Table,
as injustice and uncharitableness, fraud and deceit, cruelty and oppression,
pride and covetousness, falsifying of their covenants and promises: And also
by such as profess the truth in sincerity and uprightness of heart, and yet
through humane frailty and infirmity, are sometimes ouer-taken of these and
such like sins. Both which cast before the feet of those, who are
unregenerate, such stumbling blocks of offense, that they are thereby brought
out of love with Gods true Religion, presuming that there is little good in it,
when as they discern no better fruits of it in their lives: and so hate not
only such professors; but also their profession for their sakes, resolving
with themselves, that they will never be of their religion, which is so
disgraced in the world by the evil conversation of these seeming forward men.
Yea, not only those which are without, are wholly hindered from entering into the
course of Christianity, but those also that are already entered, are hereby so
discountenanced and disheartened, that they proceed in the ways of godliness,
with much discomfort and discouragement. For they are not only hindered from
making any profession of Religion more then others, when they see it thus
infamed, lest hereby they might seem like unto them, and so bring upon
themselves the disgrace and reproach of hypocrites, but also out of the same
respects shun the practice of all Christian duties, which have at least any
appearance of Piety, as hearing the Word with any extraordinary diligence and
devotion, Holy communication, Christian admonition, strict observation and
sanctification of the Lords day, prayer in their families and such like,
because they would not incur among worldlings, the suspicion of being
hypocrites. For the avoiding of which scandal and impediment, let all those in
the fear of the Lord be admonished, which call upon the Name of Christ, to
depart from iniquity, and that as they shine more then others in the Light 2.
Tim. 2. 19.
of an holy profession, so also that they approve this Light to be divine and
heavenly, by the kindly and lively heat of a charitable conversation, and
glorify God, and adorn their profession, by bringing forth the fruits of it,
not only in their piety toward him, but in their works of righteousness and
charity toward their neighbors. Let them take heed, that they presume not to
take Gods holy covenant into their Psalm. 50. 16.
mouths, when as they hate to be reformed; nor to wear Gods livery of a
sincere profession, to dishonor him by their infamous lives: and that they do
not, by giving just cause of offense, as much as in them lies, destroy those
for whom Christ has died, and so cause his precious blood to be shed in vain,
lest in that great Day of accounts, the blood of these men, who have perished
by their evil example, be required at their hands. Let them remember, that
counterfeit piety is double iniquity; that the hypocrite shall be cut off, and his
hope perish; that the seeming holy Pharise is much more odious in Gods sight,
then Publicanes and open sinners, seeing they more dishonor God, and disgrace
his holy truth then any other. Finally, that God will be honored in all those
that draw near unto him, either by rewarding their sincerity, or punishing
their hypocrisy; and that above all others, the hypocrite shall be assuredly
plunged into that bottomless Gulf of hellish condemnation, in which regard,
when our Savior speaks of the undoubted punishments of desperate sinners, he
usually says, that they shall have their portion with hypocrites in outer
darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing Matthew. 24. 51.
of teeth. Those also, who are not yet called and regenerate, are to be
admonished, as they tender the everlasting salvation of their souls, that they
do not suffer themselves to be hindered and discouraged by this scandal of the
evil lives of hypocrites, and weak Christians, from the profession of Gods
true Religion, and the practice of holy duties. And to this purpose, that they
ascribe these enormities or frailties to any thing rather, then unto the
profession of the truth, or the outward practice of it in any Christian duties
of Gods service: As namely, to the malice of the devil, who with his
tentations, assaulteth professors with more hellish policy and fury then other
men, because their sins and falls do most dishonor God, and blemish the beauty
and brightness of his shyning truth; to the wily spite of worldlings, who with
all their endeavor entice or compel those that make any show of Religion, to
accompany them in their wicked courses, that they may countenance their actions
by their examples, or escape their admonitions and reprehensions, when as they
are now become alike faulty. Or to their deep and poisonous corruptions, which
notwithstanding their outward profession, do still lie secretly lurking in
their hearts, which cause them to break out into those sins, which their
own consciences, enlightened with Gods truth, do utterly condemn. Neither
can they with more show, impute their scandalous sins and foul falls, to the
just and pure Religion professed by them, then the crookedness of the work to
the right and perfect squire, or the foulness of their hands to the pure
cristall fountain, which if it were rightly used, would wash and make them
clean. For what are all their faults, but crooked aberrations from this
straight way of truth? What are they, but such sins as are continually
condemned and beaten down in the preaching of the Gospel? For how can they
have any encouragement to go on in their wickedness, by their often hearing
of Gods Word, wherein his fearful Judgments are daily denounced against all
those who live in their sins? And therefore accursed be that foul mouth, if
it be not washed in the tears of unfeigned repentance, that dare belch out
such a blasphemy against Gods holy truth, as to say, that if there were less
preaching and hearing of the Word, there would be more obedience toward
superiors, and more love and charity toward equals and inferiors. And
likewise thrice unhappy they, who will so stumble at this stone of offense,
cast into their ways by the evil lives of hypocrites, as that they refuse to
take upon them this holy profession, or to bring forth better fruits then they
in their Christian practice. As if all should refuse physic, because some dye
that take it; or wholesome food, because some who have their stomachs full of
corrupt humors, are not nourished thereby, but becoming more sick, do
presently cast it up again without profit. Finally, let no weak Christians
be discouraged by the evil lives of hypocrites, from making open and bold
profession of Gods truth, and bringing forth the outward fruits of it in the
practice of all Christian duties, because they would not be thought like unto
them. For what were this, but to deny Christ before men, because we would shun
their reproaches? and to be in truth impious in the neglect of Christian duties,
because we would shun the suspicion of hypocrisy? What were this, but to
esteem more of the vain and false censures of profane worldlings, then of
the approbation which our good actions, and holy duties shall have from God and
a good conscience? What were this, but to refuse to be Gods true treasure and
pure gold, because there are in the world many counterfeit slips? to grow in
his field, and to lie in his barn, like good wheat, because there are tares in
the one, and chafe in the other? What were this, but to give over our lawful
callings, and honest labors in them, because there be some of the same trade
that discred it themselves and their calling, by their fraudulent and
deceitful dealings? But if this prevail with us, let us also be ashamed to
eat wholesome food, because some have surfeted on it; or to drink such drinks
as others have abused to drunkenness. Yea rather, because others have
disgraced the pure and true Religion which we profess, by their wicked lives;
let us, who are sincerely minded, make open profession of it, that we may
adorn it by our holy conversation; for the more it is blotted and blemished
with their fruits of injustice, the more it needs the hands of innocents, to
wash and restore it to its native purity. And thus much of that scandal which
arises from the evil lives of hypocrites; of that which is caused by the bad
example of evil Ministers, I have before spoken, and therefore refer the
Reader to that which has been said.

CAP. IX.
Of the impediments of a godly life, arising from the flesh: and first, such as
arise from the intellectual faculties.

. Sect. 1 That the most dangerous impediments arise from our own corrupt flesh.
IF there were no other, or greater impediments, to hinder us in the ways of
godliness, then those which are already handled; yet were there no cause why
we should flatter our selves with a vain conceit, that we may go forward in
this course with much ease, as being a thing so slight and ordinary, that the
atchieuing of it needs little care and small endeavor. But how much more will
this fond opinion vanish, and the necessity of uniting all our forces clearly
appear, for the attaining unto any perfection in spiritual graces, and the
outward practice of them in the duties of a godly life, if we further consider,
that there are many more, and far more dangerous impediments which arise from
our sinful flesh, and the inbred corruption of our polluted nature, the which
is so auerse and contrary unto the sincere and spiritual service of God, that
nothing in the world seems more irksome and tedious unto it? In which regard,
we can no sooner set our selves seriously to serve and please God in those
holy duties which he requires, but presently it opposes us, discourageth us
in all good courses, hangs (as it were) about our necks as an heavy Heb.
12. 1.
burden, and tyreth us in our journey, hampereth and fettereth us, that we can
but slowly, and not without much pains and difficulty, proceed in any
Christian duties, and labors might and maine to shake off the yoke of new
obedience, that it may regaine wonted liberty, and glut it self in the
pleasures of sin, with sensual delight. Neither in truth would it be an hard
thing for us to overcome all those difficulties, and remove those impediments
which the devil and the world cast in our way, if our corrupt flesh did not
betray our Christian resolution, and willingly admit these discouragements, and
if it were not as ready to stumble at these blocks, that it may take occasion
thereby to stand still, or turn out of the way, as our other enemies to cast
them before us. So that above all impediments which hinder us in the course of
Christianity, we carry those which are most dangerous, in our own bosoms,
even the rebellious reluctations and oppositions of our own sinful flesh,
which hinder us wholly from all holy duties, or so interrupt us in them, that
we perform them at the best, with much weakness, and manifold wants and
imperfections. And thus the flesh hinders us, either by its frailty and
weakness, whereby it disableth us to perform the duties of Gods service; as
we see in the example of the Apostles, who through natural drowzinesse, could
not watch and pray, as their Lord enjoined them; according to that of our
Savior, The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak; or else Math.
26. 41.
by its maliciousness, which makes it wilfully to oppose and hinder the
spiritual part in all good duties; according to that of the Apostle, The Gal.
5. 17.
flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these
are contrary the one to the other, so as we cannot do that good we would. Of
which impediments caused by the flesh, the Apostle pitifully complains; To
will, is Romans 7. 18, 22, 23, 24.
present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For the
good that I would, I do not, but the evil that I would not, that I do. I
delight in the Law of God after the inner man; but I see another law in my
members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to
the law of sin, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who shall
deliver me from the body of this death? Which impediments if we would remove,
we must daily make war against our sinful flesh, and corruption of nature,
from whence they arise, and strike at the root, if we would kill the branches
which spring from it. We must labor with God by prayer, for the assistance of
his holy Spirit, that thereby we may be enabled to mortify and subdue the
flesh, and all its sinful lusts, which fight against our 1. Pet. 2. 11.
souls, and quickened in the inner man, unto new obedience and holiness of
life. And having gotten the mastery over this enemy, we must not content our
selves with our first victories, but we must still keep it under, like a
slave, and by daily buffetting and beating of it, hold it in subjection, 1.
Cor. 9. 27.
that it may not rebel against the spiritual part, nor hinder it from
performing the duties of a godly and Christian life. But this I will thus
briefly pass over, because I have already entreated of it at large, in the
fourth part of my Christian Warfare.

. Sect. 2 That ignorance is a great impediment to a godly life.
The special impediments which the flesh uses, to hinder us in the duties of
a godly life, arise either from the corruptions of nature, or from those
manifold objections, whereby it discourageth us from entering into, or
proceeding in it. The impediments of the former kind are internal in the
soul, or external in our works and actions. Concerning the first; the soul
is so generally corrupted in all the powers and faculties of it, that it wholly
disableth us unto all the duties of a godly life. The which corruptions are
either in the mind and understanding, or in the heart and affections. The mind
and understanding do hinder us in the practice of all Christan duties, both by
ignorance, which hinders and disableth us from knowing those things which are
necessary to salvation, and to the practice of all holy duties, and by
curiosity, which makes us to affect the knowledge of such things as are
needless and unprofitable. For first, we are hindered in the duties of a godly
life, by our natural ignorance of God, who is to be worshipped and served by
them, especially when we do not understand and know his saving attributes; as
that he is omniscient to take notice of all our thoughts, words and actions;
and omnipotent to reward them, if they be good; or to punish them, if they be
evil; that he is just, and will call all we do, to account; and merciful, to
pardon our infirmities and imperfections, if we labor and endeavor to do
unto him the best service we are able; that he is all-sufficient and infinite
in all goodness, most bountiful and gracious, and a rich rewarder of all
those who seek and serve him. All which being singular motives and
encouragements unto all Christian duties, the ignorance of them must needs be a
notable impediment to hinder us in them. For who can with cheerfulness serve
such a master as he knows not? or be faithful and diligent in his duty, when
as he cannot, upon any well-grounded knowledge, be assured that his service is
accepted, or shall be rewarded? Who can perform duties agreeable to Gods
nature, when he understands not what it is, or perform any spiritual
service, if he know not that he is spiritual unto whom it is performed? Thus
also we are hindered in the duties of a godly life, by being ignorant of Gods
revealed will; for seeing no service is acceptable, which is not agreeable unto
it, all devotion not guided by it, mere superstition, and all will worship
invented by our own brain, though with never so good intention, odious and
abominable; who sees not, that he who is ignorant of Gods will, is no more
able to walk in the way of his Commandments, then he who wants his bodily
eyes, to go in a strange and difficult way, without a guide? Yea, suppose that
we were set in this way, and led (as it were by the hand) by the directions of
others, yet if we do not see with our own eyes, and be not able of our selves
to discern the right way, by the light of Gods Word shining unto us; how
easily (if our guides do but a little leave us) shall we, through the malice
of the devil and our own corruption, err and go astray? And if we be not
able to try the spirits of our Teachers, 1. Joh. 4. 1. Act. 17. 11.
and to examine their doctrines by the Touchstone of Gods truth, how apt are
we to become a prey unto seducers and false teachers, and to fall into sects,
schisms, and damnable heresies? like blind men, who not seeing their way, do
stand wholly at the devotion of their guides, to go with them whithersoeuer
they shall be pleased to lead them. Again, ignorance of Gods special
providence, is a notable pulbacke from pious duties, whereby in a gracious and
just manner, he does even in this life administer and dispense his rewards to
those that serve him, preserving them from all dangers, and from the malice and
fury of all enemies who oppose them in their Christian conversation, and
providing for them all things necessary for their souls and bodies, in such a
competency and sufficiency, as is most fit for his own glory, and their
salvation: and also his judgments and punishments to them who neglect his
service, and spend their days in the works of darkness, performing ready
service unto sin and Satan. For when we do observe no profit accruing unto
them, who are careful to please God by doing his will; nor any discommodity or
punishment accompanying those, who walk in the sinful imaginations of their
own hearts, we are much hindered thereby in all Christian duties, and ready to
take any course which may further our worldly and wicked ends, seeing we are
neither restrained from evil by Gods fear, nor stirred up unto any good duty
by his love; neither terrified from sin by his affrighting judgments, nor
encouraged unto virtuous actions, by the expectation of his gracious rewards.
Finally, ignorance is a notable impediment to a godly life, because if we do
not know the duties which are required unto it, nor the chief things wherein
it consists, it is not possible that we should perform them. If we do not
know what is pleasing, and what displeasing unto God, what he requires in our
service of him, and what he forbids and condemns, as odious and
abominable, we shall mistake the one for the other, yea, be much more ready to
do such things as he hates, then such as are pleasing unto him, because our
corrupt nature is prone to the one, and auerse and backward to the other.
Besides, if we be ignorant, we cannot see the excellency, profit, and
necessity of all Christian duties belonging to a godly life, which as they are
singular motives to persuade us unto the embracing and practicing of them; so
the ignorance of them does make us utterly careless and negligent. In all
which respects (if we would remove this impediment) it is most necessary, that
we labor after the saving knowledge of God and his attributes, his will and
providence, and of all those duties of holiness and righteousness which he
requires of us; and to this end, carefully and conscionably use all good
means whereby we may attain unto it; of which I have spoken in the beginning
of this Treatise. For be we well assured, that so long as we continue
ignorant of these things, it is not possible to perform any duty acceptable
unto God. Neither let us content our selves with a speculatiue, idle, and
fruitless knowledge swimming in the brain, in which, though we excel all
others, we shall not become more godly and religious; but rather more proud and
vainglorious; but let us labor after that saving and experimental knowledge
of God and his attributes, his will and works, whereby we find and feel the
things we know, effectual for the sanctifying our hearts and affections, and
for the renewing of our lives in all holy obedience unto Gods will.

. Sect. 3 That vain curiosity is a great impediment to a godly life.
The other impediment, respecting the understanding, is vain curiosity, when
as neglecting to know those things concerning God and his will, which he has
revealed unto us in his Word, we pry into his secrets which belong not unto us;
spending our wits in spinning such Spiders webs, as are utterly unprofitable
for any use. For whilst we delight our selves in the study of these captious
curiosities, we wholly neglect all useful knowledge of the main points of
Christian Religion, as being matters too obuious and common for our sublimated
and subtle wits; yea, are so wholly intent unto idle speculations, that we can
find no leisure for the practice of any Christian duties, like those
star-gazing Astrologers, who so fix their eyes upon them, to observe their
magnitudes, motions, and influences, that they cannot discern their way, but
are ready to stumble at every stone, and to slip and fall into every ditch.
Which impediment if we would avoid, we must labor to mortify our spiritual
pride, which is the mother and nurse of this idle curiosity. Secondly, we must
be wise unto sobriety, not presuming to understand above that which is meet,
Romans 12. 3.
knowing that the secret things belong unto God, and only things revealed,
unto Deuteronomy. 29. 29.
us. Thirdly, let us in the first place bend our studies unto the attaining of
such knowledge as is most profitable and necessary, wherein we shall find such
plenty and variety, such high contemplations and divine Mysteries, that we
shall have little leisure or pleasure, in looking after idle speculations, and
fruitless curiosities. Finally, let us propound use and practice, as the maine
end of all our knowledge, and condemn as vain and frivolous, that which does
rather hinder then advance it; for the more we spend our time and strength
about curious nicities, the less remains for the gayning of solid knowledge,
and the practice of it in holy duties. Other impediments there are, which arise
from the sinful corruption of our intellectual faculties, which respect
either our minds, imaginations, and discourse of reason, or our judgments and
conclusions which arise from them. In respect of the former, it is a notable
hindrance of a godly life, when as all our cogitations are so wholly bent upon
worldly things, that we never enter into any consideration of our spiritual
estate, whether we and our actions are accepted of God or no, or whether that
we do please or displease him: Nor ever think with our selves, whether we
are in the state of grace and salvation, or of corruption and condemnation; and
whether we take that course, and walk in that way that leads to life and
blessedness, or that which brings all that go in it to hell and
destruction. And finally, when as we as are so wholly sensual and addicted to
the present fruition of earthly vanities, that we never consider, whether the
means be good or evil whereby we may compass them, nor take any notice of
the manifold evils both spiritual and corporal, temporal and eternal, which
our sins will bring upon us, if we continue in them without repentance; nor
yet of the manifold and unspeakable comforts and contentments, blessings and
benefits which accompany a godly life, both in this world and the World to
come. Which impediment, if we would remove, we must often enter into
consideration of these things, and into a serious examination of our estate,
according to those directions which I have before given, when I entreated of
the means whereby we may be enabled to lead a godly life.

. Sect. 4 Of impediments arising from corrupted and erroneous judgment.
The judgment also corrupted with error and ignorance, is a notable
impediment to hinder us from the sincere practice of all Christian duties of a
godly life. For hereby men be fool themselves with idle conceits, that have
no ground or warrant in Gods Word, and thereby rest contented with their
present estate, and never labor to attain unto a better. For so are they
blinded with natural ignorance, that they cannot discern their blindness,
but think themselves as sharp sighted as any other. So poor are they and
destitute of the riches of Gods saving graces, that they have no sense of their
poverty, but please themselves with shadows in stead of substance, like men
replenished with wind, in stead of wholesome nourishment, and those who
mistake the swelling of their dropsy humors, for sound and good flesh. So
dead they are in sin, that they have no feeling of their deadness, and
though they be never so much cut and lanched with the sword of the Spirit, and
keen Razour of the Word, they have no sense of it, nor ever complain more
then dead men of their wounds and gashes. Finally, lying in their sins, as in
their proper element, though they be never so heavy and intolerable, yet like a
fish under the water, they do not at all feel the weight of them. As we see
in the example of the proud Pharisees, who thought themselves sharp sighted and
righteous, when as they were in Christ's estimate stark blind, Ioh. 9. 40.
and wicked above all men, even Publicanes and sinners: of the Jews, who
thought themselves freemen, and the children of Abraham, when as they Ioh. 8.
33.
were the sons and slaves of sin and Satan; and of the lukewarm
Loadiceans, who falsely imagined that they were rich and increased with Apoc. 3.
17, 18.
goods, and had need of nothing; when as they were wretched and miserable,
poor, blind, and naked. The which false and erroneous judgment, is a
principal impediment unto a godly life; unto which (as one says of wisdom)
many might have attained, if they had not falsely supposed that they had already
attained unto it. For who labors to better his estate, that thinks it is
good enough already? or to attain unto more wealth, that contenteth himself
with his portion, as thinking it abundantly sufficient? who goes to the
Physician, that assures himself that he is in perfect health? or to the
Lawyer for counsel, that makes no doubt of the validity of his evidences? or
to the Divine for instruction, who supposes that he knows already as much as
he can teach him? And who labors to better his spiritual estate, who
thinks it already so good, that it needs no amendment? Which dangerous
impediment if we would remove, let us not measure our selves by the false ell
of carnal reason, and an erroneous judgment, nor compare our selves with our
selves, or with other men, whom we think worse then we; but let us examine our
ways and works by the perfect rule of Gods Word, and try thereby how
infinitely we come short of that exact obedience which his Law requires. Let
us thereby labor to come to a true sense of our own misery, and to have our
blind eyes so opened and enlightened, that we may discern the manifold wants
and imperfections of our best actions, and so labor after more perfection.
Finally, let us know it for certain, as an undoubted truth, that we have not
yet set forward one foot in the ways of Christianity and true godliness, when
we think that we have gone far enough already; for true grace is in
continual growth; and he that has attained unto any measure of it in truth,
seeing his wants and imperfections, strives and labors after more
perfection; wherein he, who has made the greatest progress, is most earnest
in proceeding, like him that runs a race, who makes best speed when he
approaches nearest unto the goal; or like the natural motion, which is slow
at the beginning but the longer it continues, the swifter it grows; as we
see in the descent and fall of a stone, which moves fastest, when it draws
near unto the center. And this we see in the example of the Pharisees and the
Apostle Paul; For they having an opinion of their own perfection, rested in
their own righteousness as sufficient for salvation, and never desired to be
made partakers of the righteousness of Christ, for their justification;
whereas by Christ's testimony it clearly appears, that they had not so much
as made an entrance into the way of life, and were much farther off from the
Kingdom of God then Publicanes and sinners. But contrariwise, the Apostle
having out-stripped almost all others, when he came nearest the goal of
perfection, made his greatest speed; forgetting those things which were behind,
and Phil. 3. 13, 14.
reaching forth to those which were before, and pressing toward the mark,
for the price of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ.

. Sect. 5 Of impediments arising from special errors in judgment.
The special and particular errors in judgment, which hinder men from
resolving to lead a godly life, are innumerable; and therefore I will content
my self to set down here some few of them, and but slightly to touch them,
because the bare naming of them, in respect of their inualidity and weakness,
is a sufficient confutation. First then, out of an erroneous judgment
concerning God, they falsely conceive, that he is so merciful, that either he
will save all men, or at least, them who perform some kind of service unto
him, though they be not like others, strict in their courses, but give liberty
to the satisfying of their sensual lusts, and to lead such a life as best
pleases them. Whereby they make an Idol of Gods mercy, in separating it from
his justice and truth, which has denounced death and condemnation against all
that neglect his service, and live in their sins without repentance. So they
think that God will accept of their good meaning, though being ignorant, they
know not how to serve him as he has required, notwithstanding that the Lord
in innumerable places of holy Scriptures, professes his hatred to superstition
and all will worship. That he will accept of us, if we go to the Church
according to the Princes Laws like other men, and offer unto God the outward
service of the body, in hearing the Word, and praying with the Congregation,
and receiving the Sacrament at Easter, although all be done in mere formality
and hypocrisy without any zeal and devotion, or desire to serve and please
God, or to profit by these spiritual exercises for the increasing of his
graces in us, notwithstanding that God in so many places reiects these
heartlesse sacrifices, lip-labor, and hypocritical Esa. 49. 13.
formalities, and being a Spirit, does require of us such a service as is
performed Mat. 15. 8.
in Spirit and truth. Thus they think that God is served in an acceptable Ioh.
4. 24.
manner, when they repeat the Lords Prayer, though they do not understand any
one Petition in it, and when they rehearse the Belief and the ten
Commandments, which they also use in stead of Prayer, not understanding aright
any one article of their faith, nor any precept of the Decalogue; and that they
have by this repetition blessed themselves sufficiently for the day following,
though a little child, who is destitute of all saving knowledge, is able to
perform this task as well as they. That they may live in their sins without
repentance unto old age, or the day of sickness and death, and that God is so
gracious that he will forgive all their sins, if before they depart this
life, they have but leisure to say; Lord, have mercy upon me, though the
Scriptures teach us, that he who turns Pro. 28. 9. and 15. 8. and 1. 24. 28.
Zach. 7. 11, 12.
away his ear from hearing the Law, his prayers are abominable; that God
abhors even the very sacrifices of the wicked; and that those who stop their
ears when God calls, shall not be heard when they call and cry unto him.
Finally, they suppose that they can repent when they list, though it be a free
grace of God, which must be accepted when he offers it, and cannot be
reasonably expected, if it be refused and rejected when he tendreth it unto us.
In respect of the Christian life it self, and the graces and duties required
unto it, they do all delude themselves with a false and erroneous judgment.
For they cannot persuade themselves that the godly life is best and most
blessed, nor that there is such necessity of it, as Preachers would bear them
in hand; but that they may take here their full swindge in pleasure, and set
their hearts upon riches and other worldly vanities, and yet be assured of
heavenly happiness, as well as those who are most scrupulous and precise;
though the Scriptures tell us that we cannot serve God and Mammon; that if we
love the world, the love Matthew. 6. 24. 1. Ioh. 2. 15.
of the Father is not in us, because the love of the one, is enmity against the
other; that without holiness we cannot see God and that the way to Iam. 4. 4.
Heb. 12. 14. Matthew. 7. 12.
heaven is narrow, and the gate so straight, that without much striving we
cannot enter into it. Thus they imagine, that they need not to take such
pains in hearing many Sermons, seeing the Preacher can tell them no more then
they know already, namely, that they must love God above all things, and their
neighbors as themselves; that the best fail in this, and that we are all
sinners, and must be saved only by Jesus Christ: Though the Scriptures truly
preached, are not only the spiritual seed to beget us, but the food also to
nourish us, the strong power of God to salvation to all that believe, and the
sword Romans 1. 16.
of the Spirit, to defend our selves, and beat back our enemies: Our heavenly
Schoolmasters to teach us the way, and the means also whereby we may be
enabled to walk in it, and finally, our guide to direct and lead us by the
hand, and our comforter to support us when we are ready to faint in our
journey. That it is sufficient, if we lead a civil life, and be no heinous
malefactors, as murderers, thieves, adulterers and such like; and that we
are good Christians, if we do no man harm, if we do no good, though he who
hid his talent in the earth, and did not increase it, was cast into outer
darkness; Dives tormented in hell, because he relieved not Lazarus; And
though our Savior professes, that he will reject at the day of Judgment,
not only oppressors, thieves and mutherers, but those also who have not fed
the hungry, and clothed the naked. Thus they think that they have abundantly
discharged their duty, if they have, for worldly ends, had some respect to
some duties of the second Table, as keeping their word, and dealing justly, and
giving now and then an alms, howsoever they have wholly neglected the duties of
the first Table, and have made no conscience of Gods service and Sabbaths;
though piety be the ground and foundation of all obedience, without which,
Justice and moral honesty have no true subsistence. That they need not to
labor after the knowledge of God and his will, because they are unlettered and
unlearned, though without knowledge of the maine principles of Religion, there
can be no Faith, and without Faith, no Salvation. That they have good hearts
toward God, though their speeches be filthy and profane, and their actions
wicked and mischievous, notwithstanding that our Savior has told us, that
Matthew. 7. 18. and 15, 18, 19.
the tree is known by its fruit, and that such as the fountain is, such also
are the streams that flow from it. That we are all sinners, and full of
infirmities and humane frailties, and therefore they must be excused, when
wittingly and wilfully they fall into grievous sins; though the Apostle
tells us, that he who thus sins, is not borne of God, but 1. Job. 3. 8, 9.
that he is of the devil, if with full swinge of will, he do him service.
That they are in Christ, and therefore have escaped condemnation, though the
Apostle says, that all who are in him, walk not after the Romans 8. 1. 2. Cor.
5. 17.
flesh, but after the Spirit, and that all who have put on Christ, are become
new creatures, and being ingrafted into this Vine, do bring forth fruits in
Job. 15. 2.
him. Thus they erroneously allege, that because Christ came to Matthew. 9. 13.
and 11. 28.
save sinners, therefore though they continue still in sin, they may have
their part in this salvation, whereas this comfort only belongs unto
repentant sinners, who labor and groan under their sins, as under an heavy
burden, and being weary of it, do flee unto Christ for ease. Thus they abuse
Gods eternal decree of predestination, concluding, that because he has
decreed and ordained all men, either to life and salvation, or to death and
destruction; and his counsel must stand, being immutable and unchangeable;
therefore it is no matter how they live, for if they be ordained to life, they
shall be saved, live how they list; or if to destruction, they cannot attain
to salvation, though they take never so much care and pains in Gods service.
The which their conceit is quite contrary to the Scriptures, which teach us,
that God has, in his decree of predestination, included the means with the
end, so that it is not possible to be condemned, if we conscionably use the
means, of attayning to salvation; or to be saved, if we neglect these means
and walk in the ways of wickedness which lead to destruction. For whom he
Romans 8. 30.
has predestined to salvation, those also he calls, justifies and
sanctifies. Those whom he has chosen, he has also ordained, that Ephesians. 1. 4.
they should be holy and without blame before him in love, and has elected 1.
Pet. 1. 2.
them, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience, and sprinkling
with the blood of Christ. Those whom he has ordained unto glory, he has
predestined them to be conformed to the Image of his Son, and has created
Romans 8. 29. Ephesians. 2. 8.
them in him to good works. And therefore if we be effectually called,
justified and sanctified, we may thereby be assured, that we are elected to
salvation; but if none of these can be found in us, we still continue in the
state of reprobation, seeing the means and end do inseparably go together.
Finally, when as the Scriptures teach us, that Faith alone justifies, as being
the only instrument that applies unto us Christ our righteousness; loose
Libertines do hence conclude, that that Faith which is alone, justifies; and
therefore, so they believe in Christ, they have liberty to live as they list,
and need not to take any pains to serve and please God in the duties of a
godly life. Whereas the Apostle plainly tells us, that we shall be judged
according to our works, 2. Cor. 5. 10.
whether they have bin good or evil. And our Savior has taught us, that he
will pronounce the last sentence according to the works of mercy, either
Matthew. 25. 34, 35, 36.
performed or neglected by us, as being the signs and undoubted evidences of
our Faith, whereby it is approved as sound and sincere, or condemned as
counterfeit and hypocritical. And the Apostle James expressly affirms, that
Faith without works is dead, and like a carkase without Iam. 2. 17, 26.
breath or life. And therefore, though good works are not required as causes
to the act of justification, yet they are necessary as effects to the Matthew.
25. 34. Romans 6. 23.
party justified; though they do not merit everlasting happiness, seeing it is
a gracious inheritance, and Gods free gift, yet they are the way that leads
unto it, in which we must necessarily walk, if we will be saved, for without
holiness we shall never see the Lord; as the Apostle tells us. Heb. 12. 14.


. Sect. 6 That infidelity is a great impediment to a godly life.
Again, the corruption of our intellectual faculties, does exceedingly hinder
us from serving God in the duties of a godly life, not only as it blinds
them with ignorance, and misleadeth them with error; but also as it poysoneth
them with cursed infidelity, which is the root of all other sins, and the
chief impediment of all Christian duties, the ground of all which is a lively
faith. For as the Apostle speaks, No man can come unto God, until he first
know that God Heb. 11. 6.
is, nor perform any faithful service unto him, until he be persuaded that
he is a rich rewarder of them who diligently seek and serve him. Again,
Without faith it is impossible to please God, because whatsoever is not Romans
14. 23.
done of Faith, is sin. Without Faith we cannot be ingrafted into Christ,
seeing it is the bond of this union, nor bring forth in him any fruits of new
obedience, for without Christ we can do nothing. Unless Ioh. 15. 2, 5.
by Faith we be assured of Gods love toward us, we cannot love him (for as the
Apostle John says, We love him, because he loves us first) and 1. Ioh. 4. 19.
without love there is no obedience, seeing it is the sum of the whole Law.
And therefore if we would lead a godly life, we must with all care and
endeavor remove this impediment, then the which, none is more pernicious (for
how should we flee from that sin, which we naturally love, or practice those
duties, unto which our natures are auerse, if we neither believe Gods
threatenings restrayning us from sin, nor his promises alluring us to
obedience?) And to this end we must carefully use all those means of which I
have before spoken, both of begetting Faith in us, if it be wanting, and of
confirming and increasing of it, if it be begun.

CAP. X.
Of those manifold impediments of a godly life, which arise from our sinful
and corrupt hearts and affections.

. Sect. 1 The first impediment is an heart hardened through the deceitfulness
of sin.
ANd thus have I showed, how we may remove those impediments of a godly life,
which arise from the corruption of the intellectual faculties. Those which
respect the heart and affections, are many and dangerous. The first is, when
our hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, and so habituated
and accustomed to evil courses, that it is death to us, if we endeavor to
forsake them, and to serve God in the duties of a godly life. Of this we have
many warnings in the Scriptures, as being a most dangerous rock, upon which
many have suffered shipwreck: To day if you will hear his voice, harden not
your hearts. Psalm. 95. 7, 8.
And, Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
unbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily,
while it is Heb. 3. 12, 13.
called to day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of
sin. Which impediment if we would remove, let us withstand sin in the
first motions of it, and if at any time we be overtaken, let us carefully take
heed, that we do not lie in sin, but rise again speedily by unfeigned
repentance. Let us beware that we do not often fall into the same sins,
after we have repented of them; seeing by many acts, we come at last to an
habit and custom. Or if this custom has already prevailed, and is now come
to have in it the strength of a Law, and to be (as it were) a second nature,
let us not suffer it any longer to continue inviolable, but bend all our power
and strength to disanull and break it. Neither let our corrupt nature plead
prescription for sin, or the neglect of holy duties, as though because we
have long done that which God forbids, or not done that which he has
commanded, therefore we must be borne with, if we do so still; seeing this is
no excuse at all, but rather the greatest aggrauation of our sinnefulnesse and
negligence. For though they might be somewhat excused, if they were done but
once or twice, they are altogether intolerable when they grow common and
customable. And therefore our long living in sin, and in the neglect of
Christian duties, should be so far from excusing our continuing in these
courses, that it ought to be a strong motive to double our diligence in
redeeming this lost time, as the Apostle exhorts. And this reason the Ephesians. ^.
16. 1. Pet. 4. 2, 3.
Apostle Peter also uses to persuade us, that we should no longer live the
rest of our time in the flesh, according to the lusts of men, but according to
the will of God, because the time past of our lives may suffice us to have
wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciutousnesse, lusts,
excess of wine, reuellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries. Now the
means whereby we may be enabled to break off this custom in sinning, and to
perform the contrary duties of a godly life, is, to labor to have our hearts
possessed and fraughted with Gods fear, partly in respect of his Judgments
denounced against sin, and partly in respect of his mercies and manifold
blessings, promised to all that serve and please him. For nothing does more
powerfully ouer-master this tyrannical custom, then the true fear of God;
even as the want thereof is the chief cause of falling into, and continuing in
sin. And secondly, our best course is to set our selves with a firm
resolution to break off, and discontinue our custom in sinning, and to
perform the contrary duties of a godly life, seeing many acts of well-doing
will at last bring us to an habit and custom, and make them easy and
familiar, which at the first entrance seemed difficult and almost impossible.
The like impediment unto all Christian duties, arises from security and
hardness of heart, which taking away all sense and feeling, both of Gods
mercies and Judgments, and putting away the evil day far from us, does make
us also therewith to put off the day of repentance, to neglect all holy and
religious duties, and to go on securely in our former evil courses. Of the
removing of which impediment I will not here speak, because I have handled it
at large in my Treatise of carnal security, and hardness of heart.

. Sect. 2 Of the second impediment respecting the heart, which is the world.
The second impediment of a godly life, respecting the heart, is worldly
concupiscence, and immoderate and excessive love of the world and earthly
things, and chiefly of honors, riches and pleasures, and that carking care
which arises from it, for the getting or keeping of them. Concerning the
former. As the love of God and the love of the world will not harbor together
in the same heart, because 1. Joh. 2. 15. Jam. 4. 4.
the amity and friendship of the one, is enmity against the other, as the
Apostles John and James teach us; so neither can we perform faithful service
to them both, being Masters which stand in flat opposition one to Math. 6. 24.
the other, as our Savior has told us. In which regard, Demas is said to 2.
Tim. 4. 10.
have forsaken the Apostle Paul, and with him, his Master Christ and his truth,
as soon as he begun to love this present world. For when men have once fixed
their hearts upon earthly vanities, all their cogitations are so taken up with
them, that they have no leisure to think upon any Christian duties; and so
wholly are they besotted with the love of this painted strumpet, that they
think all time lost, which is not spent in winning and gaining her. So that
when Christ inuiteth them unto his Marriage Supper, to feast them with
spiritual delicacies, that Gods graces may be so Luke 14. 16, 17.
strengthened in them, as that they may be enabled to serve him in all
Christian duties, they presently pretend excuses, and will not come. For Joh.
12. 42, 43.
the removing of which impediment, we must use all good means to weane our
hearts from the love of the world, that we may contemn it as vain and
worthless, in comparison of spiritual grace, and heavenly glory. To which
purpose we must consider, that the worlds prosperity which we dote so much
upon, will, being thus abused, become a notable tentation to draw us into all
manner of sin, to our perdition and destruction; according to that of the
wise Solomon; The prosperity of fools Prou. 1. 32. Mark. 8. 36.
shall destroy them: And, What will it profit us to gain the whole world, and
lose our own souls? as our Savior speaks. Let us consider, that these
worldly things are momentany and mutable, hardly gotten, and soon lost;
uncertain in the pursuit, whether after all our labor we shall obtain them
or no, and no more certain in the possession, seeing they may every day be
taken from us, or we from them. Let us consider, that they are vain, and
satisfy not, but the more we drink, the more we thirst; the more we abound,
the more we want; and that they bring not any sound contentment to their
owners, but labor in getting, care in keeping, and fear in losing them. That
they do not at all profit us for the assuring of those things which are
chiefly to be desired, nor at those times when we shall stand in most need of
help and comfort; namely, at the hour of death, and day of Judgment. Yea, if
we immoderately dote on them, they will become exceeding hurtful and
pernicious, being those thorns which will choke in us the seed of Gods Word,
from which all saving graces Math. 13. 22.
do spring; those snares of the devil, which entangle us to our perdition;
those heavy burdens, which hinder us in our journey toward our heavenly 1.
Tim. 6. 9, 10.
home, and Cammell-like bunches, which will keep us from entering into that
straight and narrow gate.

. Sect. 3 The third impediment arising from worldly cares.
The cares also of this world are a great impediment to a godly life. For
first, they hinder us from performing religious duties, as we see in the Math.
22. 5. Luke 14. 18. and 9 59, 61. Luke 10. 40.
example of those, who being invited to the Marriage Supper of the Kings Son,
refused to come; and of those, who being called to be Christ's Disciples, were
so taken up with the care of their worldly business, that they could find no
present leisure to follow Christ. Yea of Martha her self, who though she were
a good woman, yet was so cumbred with care, in providing for Christ's
entertainment, that she could find no time to hear his heavenly Sermons, and
envied her sister, for performing this high and holy duty. Or if we set our
selves to perform any service unto God, these cares interpose themselves, and
distract us with worldly and wandering thoughts, so as we cannot perform it
with any fruit and benefit: as we see in the Parable of the Sower, where he
that received seed among thorns, is (as our Savior expounds it) he that
hears the Word, and the Math. 13. 22.
cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word, and he
becomes Luke 8. 14.
unfruitful. In which regard, our Savior gives unto us a special caveat
(whereby we may be fitted for his coming) that we should take heed to our
selves, lest at any time our hearts be ouercharged with surfeiting and
drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and so that day come upon us at
unawares. For as the one surchargeth the stomach, and makes us unfit for any
bodily employment, so the other oppress and intoxicate the mind and heart (as
it were) with a kind of spiritual gluttony and drunkenness, that they become
altogether unprofitable for any religious exercise. Now the means to remove
this impediment are first, to contemn these worldly things, as being of small
value, in comparison of saving grace, and heavenly glory: For what we can
despise, we will not pursue with overmuch care. Secondly, let us learn to
live the life of faith, and not resting upon our own provision, cast our
selves upon Gods all-sufficient providence, and neuer-failing promises, who
will assuredly provide for us, if we wholly depend upon him. And this means
and motive the Scriptures offer unto us, to preserve us from covetousness and
carking care, according to that of the Psalmist, Commit thy way unto the Lord,
trust also in him, and Psalm. 37. 5.
he shall bring it to pass. And that counsel of the Wise man; Commit thy
Prou. 16. 3.
works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established. So the Apostle;
Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such
things Heb. 13. 5.
as ye have; for he has said, I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee. And the
Apostle Peter; Cast all your care upon him, for he cares for you. But most
excellently 1. Pet. 5. 7.
does our Savior Christ, with many strong arguments, arm us against this
carking care: Take no thought (says he) for your life, what you Math. 6. 25,
26, etc.
shall eat, or what you shall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put
on. First, because he that has given us that which is the greater and better,
he will not, if we depend upon him, deny unto us that which is less and worse.
Is not the life more then meat? and the body then raiment? Secondly, because
he who is so gracious, bountiful, and provident, as to provide for the Fowls
of the air, and the Lillies of the field, without their care and pains, will
much more provide for his children that rely upon him, and with their
reasonable pains and moderate care, do serve his providence. Thirdly, because
this carking care is bootlesse and unprofitable, seeing God, according as it
seems best to his infinite wisdom, has allotted unto every one a stint and
proportion in their estate, as well as in their bodily stature, unto which they
shall come, and not exceed it. And therefore as no man can add one cubit to
his stature of body, though he take never so much care and pains; so also it
is alike impossible hereby to add one mite unto that dimension of our estate,
which God by his wise and powerful providence has allotted unto us. Fourthly,
because this immoderate care is more fit for Infidels, who rest wholly upon
themselves and their own means, then for Christians, who acknowledge God,
most wise, and all-sufficient, to be their Father; seeing he is omniscient,
and takes notice of all our wants, and omnipotent, and most gracious and
bountiful, and therefore most able and willing to supply them. Fifthly,
because the best means to be assured of all earthly blessings, in such a
proportion as is most fit for Gods glory, and our salvation, is above, and
before all things, to seek Gods Kingdom and righteousness, because we have
his infallible promise, that if we so do, other things shall be added unto us,
as it were small advantages to this maine bargain. The which Solomon found
verified in his own experience; who being put to 1. King. 3. 9, 10, 12, 13.
his choice, and preferring wisdom, before riches, honor, and long life, did
not only obtain it at Gods hands, but all these things likewise for which he
made no suit. Lastly, because it is extreme folly to anticipate future cares
and troubles before they come, no not those of the next day, seeing when they
come, they will bring grief and vexation enough, though we do not prevent
them before they happen, and so redouble our sorrows. Neither in truth can we
tell whether those things whereof we take care, will befall us or no; and
therefore what folly is it to undergo certain trouble and care about
uncertainties? or if they shall happen, we may have wit to foresee them, but no
power to prevent them; and therefore to vex our selves before they come, is to
be miserable before the time.

CAP. XI.
Of impediments arising from our corrupt affections, and first, from carnal
hope and presumption.

. Sect. 1 That carnal hopes are great impediments to goodness.
IN respect of our carnal and corrupt affections, there are also many and
strong impediments which hinder us in the duties of a godly life. For whilst
they remain unmortified and unsubdued, they lust against the Spirit, powerful
drawing us from the practice and performance of Christian duties, and violently
carrying us into sinful courses. In which regard, the affections are called
the feet of the soul, because they carry us whither they incline and lead us,
either into the ways of godliness, if they be sanctified, or of sin and
wickedness, if they continue carnal and corrupt. The first unsanctified
affection, is carnal hope of escaping Gods heavy judgments and punishments
denounced against sin; and of the long continuance of our lives, by benefit
whereof we may safely enjoy the pleasures of sin, and need not to trouble our
selves by entering into any strict course of godliness, seeing after we have
long inioyed the world, we shall have time enough afterward to think of such
a course, as may fit and prepare us for the joys of life eternal. The which
is a notable hindrance to keep men from leading of a godly life. For whereas
if men had learned rightly to number their days, they would apply their hearts
Psalm. 90. 12.
unto wisdom; and if they were thoroughly persuaded that our lives are so
momentany and uncertain, that death may seize upon them suddenly, to day
before to morrow, it were not possible that they should so slightly put off a
matter of such great importance, as the everlasting salvation of their souls,
unto after and uncertain times, but rather would instantly 2. Pet. 1. 10.
begin to make their Calling and Election sure, and to work out their
salvation 1. Cor. 10. 12.
with fear and trembling, by furnishing their souls with all saving graces,
and expressing them in the duties of a godly life: Now when as they promise
unto themselves long life and many days, they put off all these things, as
being yet unseasonable and unnecessary, and with the rich fool in the Gospel,
say unto their souls; Soul, thou have much goods laid Luke 12. 19, 20.
up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry: which they
would not be so desperately mad to do, if that terrible voice of God still
sounded in their ears, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of
Mat. 24. 45, 46.
thee; then whose shall those things be which thou have provided? But
contrariwise, if with the wise servant, they well waighed the uncertainty of
their Lords coming to call them to an account, they would still be prepared,
and be in readiness, that they might enter with him into his heavenly joys.
Neither is there any better means to remove this impediment, then to meditate
often, not only of the momentany shortness of our lives, but also of the
great uncertainty of this short time. For if we would seriously consider, that
our life, in respect of eternity, is but as one day, yea an hour, a minute, a
moment; that it passes away as swiftly as a Weauers shuttle, as a tale told,
as a Post; and is but a flower, a vapor, a shadow, yea as vanity it self: If
we would also remember, that this short time is also uncertain, seeing we may
dye to day, as well as to morrow, this very hour, as well as the next, having
no assurance of any more time then the present, as being tenants at will, who
hold not life by lease, but only at the Lords pleasure, without so much as a
minutes warning; And finally, seeing in this short and uncertain time,
everlasting life and salvation is either gotten or lost; what folly and
madness is it to go on in our sins, and neglect all Christian duties, in
hope of long life, and to hazard our precious souls upon so uncertain and
tickle a point? It may be thou shall live another year, and it may be not
another day. The which rests not only on a possibility, but upon some
probability likewise, in respect of those innumerable dangers which outwardly
beset us, and the inward infirmities of our frail nature, which being the
matter, or (as it were) the harbingers of death, we carry still about, and in
us: which is also made more likely by the experience of many others, who have
been taken away suddenly, in the prime of their age, and chief of their
strength, not having had so much as a days, or hours warning. And shall we
venture our chief jewels, our precious souls, which are of much more price
unto us then ten thousand worlds, upon may-bees and uncertain hopes, which
being once lost, can never be recovered? Shall we hazard the everlasting joys
of heaven, which are unspeakable and inestimable, and endanger our selves to
intolerable and endless torments in hell fire, upon some likelihoods only,
which have so often failed? It may be thou shall live as long as thou
expectest. And what then gainest thou in this course of wickedness, but the
pleasures of sin, accompanied with the present checks and terrors of an
evil conscience, and the fears of imminent and approaching judgments, and
attended upon at the best, with continual sorrow and repentance even to the
day of death? And it may be thou shall die before thou art prepared for it, by
repenting for thy sins, and deuoting thy self to Gods service. And then what
losest thou, in lieu of the former gains, which are so vain in true value,
and momentany in continuance? Surely those pleasures which are at Gods right
hand for evermore, the joys of heaven, the fellowship of the Saints, and the
vision and fruition of God and his Christ, who being infinite in all goodness,
beauty, glory, and all perfection, do make all those perfectly and eternally
happy, who having faithfully served them in this life, shall see and enjoy them
in the life to come.

. Sect. 2 That carnal presumption is a great impediment to a godly life.
The second corrupt affection which hinders us in the duties of a godly life,
is carnal presumption, which carrying with it some show and semblance of a
strong faith, in the opinion of those who are blinded with ignorance, becomes
unto them a notable impediment, hindering them from the profession and practice
of true godliness. Yea, it is the devils ordinary prevailing weapon, wherewith
he assaulteth secure worldlings, which he finds by common experience so
powerful for his purpose, that for the most part he uses no other, unless
they have wounded their consciences, with committing of some horrible and
outrageous sins, which will suffer them to entertain no hope of Gods favor
and mercy in the forgiveness of them. In which case he possesses them with
terrors and fears, and drives them into the contrary extreme of desperation.
The which he also does, when he has to deal with melancholic persons, who
being naturally of a timorous and fearful disposition, cannot so easily be
persuaded to presume when there is no cause. Otherwise he seldom awakeneth
their sleeping consciences, but carries them quietly to hell and destruction
without noise. For the more sensible we are of our disease, the more we fear
the issue of it, and the more earnest and diligent we are to seek all means
of help, unless we have no hope of cure. In which regard, it may be truly
said, that whereas one perishes through despair, many hundred are plunged
into destruction by security and presumption; so much more dangerous this is
then the other, although nothing so horrid and terrible to look upon. Now this
presumption may be considered in respect of the object, either generally or
more specially. Generally, when as we presume of Gods mercy and goodness, of
the pardon of all our sins, and of the salvation of our souls, without any
sound ground or warrant out of Gods Word, when as we are in no sort qualified
and fitted to receive them. The fruit and effect of which persuasion, is a
purpose and resolution to continue still in our sins, because God is
merciful to forgive them, and to neglect the duties of a godly life, because
they are not only tedious and irksome unto us, but also of no great
necessity, seeing God respecting our frailty and weakness, will receive us to
grace and mercy. Whereas contrariwise, a true and lively faith does always
bring forth the fruits of unfeigned repentance, and persuading us of Gods love,
does work in our hearts true love toward him again, and a desire and
endeavor to express it in all holy obedience to Gods will, that we may thereby
glorify him who has been so good and gracious unto us. With like presumption
men are hindered from entering into the ways of godliness, and heartned to
continue in their sins, whilst they plead that Christ came to save sinners,
and that his death and merits, as they are sufficient in themselves to satisfy
Gods lustice, so they will be effectual unto them for their justification and
salvation, though they be not so strict and precise in making conscience of
all sins, or in practicing the duties of a godly life.

. Sect. 3 Of the means to remove the former impediment.
Now if we would avoid these impediments, let us know and consider first, that
this is a shameful and horrible abuse of Gods mercy and goodness, which he
will never let go unpunished, to take occasion thereby, the more to offend and
diplease him by wilful continuing in sin, and neglecting the duties of his
service. To provoke God to wrath, because he is patient and long-suffering, and
to sin against him, because he is good and gracious, and ready to forgive.
And finally, to neglect all duties of his service, because he is such a
bountiful Master, that he gives of his free grace and mercy, rich wages and
rewards, without all merit and desert. For these should rather be arguments to
inflame our love toward him, and to make us so much the more zealous of his
glory, and fearful to offend so gracious a God; according to that of the
Psalmist; There is mercy or forgiveness with thee, that thou may be
feared. Or if through Psalm. 130. 4.
frailty and infirmity, we have, contrary to our purpose and resolution, been
overtaken of any sin; this patience and love of God should be a strong
motive, to make us to rise out of it by unfeigned repentance; according to that
of the Apostle, Despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance,
and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to
repentance? Secondly, let us consider, that as the Lord is infinite in mercy
and compassion, so he is no less infinite in justice and truth; that as he is
merciful Exodus 34. 6, 7.
and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping
mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, to ansgression, and sin: so also he
is just in all his ways, and holy in all his works, and will by no means
clear the Psalm. 145. 17.
guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third
and fourth generation: that as he is a merciful Savior, so also a just God,
and Esa. 45. 21. Psalm. 11. 7.
a righteous Lord, who loves righteousness, and will not let sin go
unpunished, but will judge every man according to his works; and that he is a
terrible 2. Cor. 5. 10.
Judge, especially to those who abuse his mercy and long-suffering. And
therefore let us not disioyne these things which cannot be severed, nor imagine
such a mercy in God, as will not stand with his Justice, which were to mayme
the Divine nature, and to pull (as it were) one of his hands from him; which
outrageous violence offered unto his holy Majesty, he will never suffer to go
unpunished. Let us, with David, so acknowledge that he is good, as that we
do not deny that Psalm 25. 8. Psalm. ^01. 1.
he is also upright, and in our songs so sing of his mercy, as that we do
not disioyne his Judgment from it. Let us remember, that in God and in all his
works, mercy and truth do meet together, righteousness Psalm 8^. 10.
and peace do kiss each other. Let us not say, His mercy is great, he will
Ecclus. 5. 6, 7.
be pacified for the multitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from him,
and his indignation rests upon sinners. Neither let us, presuming on Gods
mercy and patience, make any tarrying to turn unto the Lord, nor put it off
from day to day; for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in
thy security thou shall be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance. Thus
the Apostle tells us, that if we despise the riches of Gods goodness and
forbearance, Romans 2. 4, 5, 6:
which should lead us to repentance, we shall after our hardness and
impenitent heart, treasure up unto our selves wrath, against the day of wrath,
and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render unto every
man according to his deeds. And the Lord threatens, that if any man hearing
the words of his curse against sinners, do bless himself in his heart,
saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to
add drunkenness to thirst; that he will not spare him, but that his anger and
jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in
the book of the Law, shall Deuteronomy. 29. 19, 20.
lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven. Let us
remember what the Apostle teaches us, namely, that no outrageous sinners,
continuing in their wickedness without repentance, shall inherit the Kingdom
of Christ and of God, and therefore exhorts, that we suffer no Ephesians. 5. 5, 6.
man to deceive us with vain words; seeing, because of these things comes
the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Finally, let us consider,
that though Gods mercies be in themselves infinite, and above all his works,
and all his gracious promises which are in Christ, yea, and Amen; yet they are
limited by his infallible truth, and appropriated unto repentant sinners, and
therefore cannot extend to the presumptuous, who take occasion from his mercies
to continue impenitently in their sins, but he will glorify his justice in
punishing them, as he glorifieth his mercy, in pardoning the sins of all
those who turn unto him by unfeigned repentance. And therefore let us
acknowledge with the Psalmist, that the Lord is good Psalm. 73. ^.
and gracious, yet not to all, but only to Israel, even to such as are of a
clean heart; and that as the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his
ears open to hear their cry: so the face of the Lord is against them that do
evil, to cut off the Psalm. 34. 15, 16.
remembrance of them from of the earth. Let us not presume upon Gods mercy
whilst we continue impenitently in our sins, but let us stand in awe of Gods
Justice and Judgments, and sin not, and offer first the sacrifice of
righteousness, Psalm. 4. 4, 5.
and then put our trust in the Lord. Those likewise, who presuming upon the
all-sufficiencie of Christ's death, merits, and satisfaction, do take occasion
thereby to continue in their sins without repentance, and to neglect the
duties of a godly life, may easily remove this dangerous impediment out of
their way, if they will but seriously consider, that this is a most fearful
abuse of his inestimable love, who has done so much for us, when as we use his
help to uphold us in our sins, and his death and merits, as a pillow whereon
we may sleep more securely in our wickedness. Whereas he came not to ratify
and confirm, but to dissolve and abolish 1. Ioh. 3. 8.
the works of the devil: And gave himself for us, not only to free us from
all sin, in respect of the guilt and punishment, but also to purge Tit. 2. 14.
us from all iniquity, and that being his peculiar people, we should be
zealous of good works. He has redeemed us out of the hands of all our
spiritual enemies, Luke 1. 74, 75.
that we may serve him in holiness and righteousness before him all the
days of our lives. He has bought us with a price, that we should glorify God
in our bodies and in our spirits, because they are his. He has given himself
for 1. Cor. 6. 20.
us, not only that he might justify us in the remission of our sins, but
also sanctify and cleanse us with the washing of the water by the Word; that he
Ephesians. 5. 25, 26.
might present us unto himself, as a glorious Spouse and Church, not having
spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that we should be holy and without
blame. Finally, he has redeemed us, not only from the guilt of sin, but
also from our vain conversation, by shedding his most precious Blood, as the
1. Pet. 1. 18.
Apostle Peter speaks. And therefore if we do not find and feel the
virtue of Christ's death and merits, as effectual for our sanctification as for
our justification, and to free us from the corruption of sin, as well as from
the guilt and punishment, we have little cause to presume of their efficacy
for our salvation, seeing these are always inseparably linked and conjoined.
Lastly, let us consider, that as our Savior Christ came Mat. 9. 13.
to save sinners, so withal to call them to repentance. And that the Redeemer
Esa. 59. 20.
came only to Sion, and to them who turn from transgression in Jacob: and
therefore let us not foolishly presume, that we shall be his redeemed, if we
continue in our sins without repentance. Let us not post off God to another
time, when he offers unto us mercy and forgiveness: But let Esa. 55. 6, 7.
us seek the Lord, while he may be found, and call upon him while he is
near. Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,
and let him return unto the Lord, and then he will have mercy upon him, and
abundantly pardon, as he has promised. Let us not presume on Gods mercy,
whilst we continue in our sins; yea, rather after that we have unfeignedly
repented of our sins, let us fear always, considering our Pro. 28. 14.
own frailty and infirmity, which makes us apt to relapse into them, and so
to provoke Gods wrath against us. Let us work out our salvation with fear and
trembling, and whilst we presume of standing, take heed of falling. Phil. 2.
13. 1. Cor. 10. 12.
And if we call God, Father, who without respect of persons judges according
to every man's works, let us pass the time of our soiourning here in fear,
as the 1. Pet. 1. 17.
Apostle Peter exhorts us.

. Sect. 4 Of presumption in neglecting the means of holiness.
And thus we see how carnal presumption generally hinders us, from entering
into, or proceeding in a godly life, and how we may remove this impediment.
More especially, we are hindered thereby, when as we presume, that we may
perform all duties required unto it, notwithstanding, that we neglect all
means of sanctification and holiness, which God has ordained for the working
his graces in us (as hearing the Word, receiving the Sacrament, Prayer, and the
rest) by the extraordinary operation of his holy Spirit in us. For the
remoouing of which impediment, we are to know, that howsoever God sometimes,
to show the infiniteness of his mercy, goodness, and power, which are free,
and not tied unto any means, does, when we least think of it, and when we
have not so much as a desire and endeavor to serve and please him, regenerate
and convert us; according to that of the Apostle, I was found of them that
sought me not; I was made manifest unto them Romans 10. 20.
that asked not after me (As we see in the example of those, who coming to
hear the Word only for form and fashion sake, without any desire Act. 2. 13,
37.
to profit by it, are notwithstanding effectually called and truly converted
by the mighty operation of Gods Spirit working with his own holy ordinance.
And though also when greater means are wanting, as in the time of persecution,
the Lord gives an extraordinary blessing to such as are mean and small,
causing his servants (like Moses and Elias) to go on constantly for many days
in the ways of godliness, in the strength of one meal; to the end it may
appear that the work of conversion and sanctification, is not effected by any
virtue inherent in the means, but that it is a gift of his grace, and conuayed
unto us by the powerful working of his holy Spirit: yet this is not Gods
common course, and ordinary manner of working his graces in us, but ordinarily
he will have us to use the means, and sanctify them as his own holy
ordinances, that they may be effectual to the ends for which we use them;
which if we neglect, we do in a presumptuous manner tempt the Lord; and can
have hereby no more hope, that God will work his graces in us, or enable us
unto the duties of a godly life, then if we rest upon his immediate providence,
and in the mean time neglect our meat, which he has ordained to nourish us,
or our clothes, which he has appointed us to use for the keeping of us warm.

CAP. XII.
Of the third sort of carnal affections, which are impediments to a godly
life; as superstitious scrupulosity, deiection of mind, fear and desperation.

. Sect. 1 That scrupulosity is a great impediment to a godly life.
THe third sort of carnal affections which are impediments to a godly life,
are such as are in the quite contrary extreme to the former, as anxious and
superstitious scrupulosity, heaviness and too much deiection of mind, fear
and desperation. Superstitious scrupulosity is, when through natural
blindness and want of sound knowledge, we doubt of all our actions, whether
they be lawful or unlawful, and call every thing into question, being ready
to yield unto every tentation which abridgeth us of our Christian liberty, when
some fearful judgment is suggested and threatened by the devil and our own
corruption, if we forbear not the use of things lawful, or do not such
things as are unlawful. The which, we mistaking for our own thoughts, and
concluding that we have given our full consent unto them (though in truth they
are the mere suggestions and tentations of our spiritual enemies) do yield
our selves over unto them, as though we were bound upon some fearful
penalty, to obey them, though they have no ground or warrant out of Gods Word,
yea in truth are expressly contrary unto it. The which is a notable impediment
to a godly life; First, because it makes us to spend our thoughts and time
about toys and trifles, as the using or not using such creatures, the doing or
not doing of such actions, as are in their own nature indifferent, and of
small importance; whilst in the mean while, we neglect the maine duties of
Gods service and of a godly life. Secondly, because these scrupulous and
superstitious fears, apprehending, upon every vain suggestion and slight
occasions, some dreadful judgment threatened, if we do not yield to the
tentation, do disturb and disquiet the mind, and take away all inward peace
and tranquillity which should comfort and encourage us in well-doing, and so
makes us to neglect altogether all good duties, or to perform them to no
purpose and profit, by reason of our doubting and incredulity, our trouble of
mind and disquietnesse. Yea oftentimes the body is so infeebled, partly by
these inward vexations, grief and heaviness, and partly by being restrained
from the comfortable use of Gods creatures, that they are disabled unto all
good duties, and become weak, sick, and unfit instruments to be used by the
soul in the service of God. Now the cause of these scrupulous fears and
troubles of mind are diverse. For first on Gods part, they are either fruits
and effects of his justice, hereby punishing our former sins, and especially
because we have neglected his holy fear, and to perform unto him the duties
of his service which he has required of us; it being just with God, that
because we would not harbor his fear in our hearts, we should have the^
replenished and vexed with causles fears of Bug-beares and shadows, and
because we would not serve him by yielding obedience unto his will, that
therefore we should become slaves to our own superstitious fantasies,
sometimes imposing upon us obedience unto them, and when we are ready to
perform it, pulling us back with some new suggestion, so that we stand in an
astonished manner, neither daring to do it, nor leave it undone, seeing both
alike threaten the same danger. Or else it is an effect of Gods mercy, when as
he conuerteth these effects of his Justice to their good; using them as means
of their contrition and humiliation, whereby they are fitted and prepared for
true repentance, and have a resolution and endeavor wrought in them of serving
God in all good duties, that so they may either be freed, or at least secured
from all those evils, which these scrupulous fears do threaten against them.
Secondly, on our part they are caused, first, by our sins, whereby we have
justly brought these vexations upon us. Secondly, by our ignorance and want of
judgment, which makes us that we cannot distinguish between the suggestions
and tentations of Satan and our own thoughts; between the bare imaginations
of our minds, unto which we give no entertainment, and the consent of our
wills unto them. By reason whereof, we either condemn our selves of such
sins as we never committed, seeing we have at the first entrance of such
thoughts and suggestions resisted, and like Wilde-fire have cast them out of
our minds and hearts, or that our sins in this kind are much more grievous
then they are, as though we had given full consent unto them, because we have a
while harbored them in our minds, by reuoluing and thinking too long on them,
before we have beaten them back, and quenched them by the shield of faith.
Thirdly, such scrupulosities and superstitious fears, arise commonly from the
natural humor of melancholy abounding in us, which makes fearful
impressions in our imaginations, and disquieteth our minds and hearts with
terrible apprehensions, which have no true ground in themselves, especially
when as this humor is (as it were) leauened and set a working and boiling with
the guilt of sin, tormenting the conscience, or with the sense and smart of
some great and extraordinary crosses and afflictions. Lastly the devil
labors to hinder us in the duties of a godly life, by making us scrupulous
and superstitious. For when he can keep us no longer in carnal security, by
reason that we are naturally timorous, and have some fear of God, through the
sight of our sins, and apprehension of his judgments begun in us, then he
indeuoreth to turn our fear to false objects, that so fearing those things
which are not to be feared, he may keep out of our hearts the true fear of
God, which should be in us the fountain of true obedience. And when he can no
longer continue us in open profaneness, being now resolved to perform some
service unto God, he will move us, all he may, to spend all our time and
strength about trifles and things of no worth, that in the mean while, we may
neglect main and substantial duties, which are necessary for the setting
forth of Gods glory, and the furthering and assuring of our salvation.
Secondly, by these scrupulous fears he distracteth our minds, turmoyleth our
hearts, and disturbeth and disquieteth our consciences, so as we cannot at all
perform any duties of Gods service, or if we do, yet so uncomfortably, and
with such anxiety and distraction, with such doubting and infidelity, that they
can neither be acceptable to God, nor profitable for our own salvation.
Lastly, when our hearts are possessed with these scrupulous fears, he easily
withholdeth us thereby from performing those holy duties which God requires,
whilst he suggesteth that some fearful judgment shall be fall us, if we do
them, because we are unworthy or unprepared; or else presses us to do them
out of these fears, that we may escape that which he threatens to impose:
And so to perform Christian duties not out of true grounds, and to right ends,
as love, filial fear, and obedience to God, to the end we may glorify him,
but out of slavish terror, that we may escape that violence which he
threatens upon our neglect. Whereof it will come to pass, that the best
duties thus performed, are not any true service of God, but rather of the
devil, seeing fear of him, and not the love of God; his terrible threatenings,
and not faith in Gods promises moves us unto them.

. Sect. 2 Of the means whereby we may be freed from superstitious
scrupulositie.
Now the means to be freed from this impediment, are, First, that we forsake
our sins, and turn unto God by unfeigned repentance, and so apply his
gracious promises unto us by a lively faith, that being reconciled unto us, he
may keep us safe under his providence and protection, and not justly for our
sins give us over to the Tempter, to be terrified with his fears, and
turmoyled with his false suggestions. Secondly, we must labor to have our
minds illuminated with saving knowledge, the light whereof will easily
discover the falsehood and vanities of these superstitious scruples and fears,
and to attain unto spiritual wisdom and sound judgment, that thereby we
may be enabled to discern between our own thoughts, which we entertain with
consent of will, and the tentations of the devil which we have resisted; the
good motions of Gods Spirit which are always agreeable to his Word, and the
suggestions of the devil, which have no ground or warrant from it. Thirdly, we
must take heed, that we do not take any thing upon the devils bare suggestion,
seeing he is a liar from the beginning, who by his falsehood labors to
deceive and destroy us (for what were this, but to believe in him by an
absolute faith, when there is no reason for it?) but we must examine his
tentations by the rule of Gods Word, which will easily discover the fraud,
weakness, and maliciousness of them. For nothing gives Satan more advantage
against weak Christians, then their readiness to give credit to his
tentations, without bringing them to the touchstone of Gods Truth. Fourthly, if
Satan takes advantage from the humor of melancholy abounding in us, to fill
and fraught our hearts with these scruples and fears, we must use the help of
the skillful Physician for the removing of this cause, that so the effects may
cease: And withal ask the counsel of some judicious and faithful Divine, who
may direct us in our ways, and resolve our doubts; upon whose judgment,
grounded upon Gods Word, we must more rest, then upon our own weak conceit
and opinions, especially being thus blinded with those black and foggie mists,
which false fear and melancholy have cast before them. Fifthly, we must
labor to have our hearts possessed and replenished with the true and filial
fear of God, springing from Faith and Love, whereby we shall be made zealous
in Gods service; and then there will be no room for these Panicke and
superstitious fears, nor any advantage given to Satan of seazing upon us with
his suggestions. Lastly, we must carefully take heed, that we do not yield our
selves over to be ruled by these scruples and fears, either to do, or not to
do any thing, because of some evil threatened; but in things indifferent, it
is our best course to resist the tentation, by doing the contrary to that which
is suggested, if Christian prudence tell us, that it is convenient, all
circumstances considered. And in things lawful or unlawful, we are to
perform or omit them, not out of scrupulous fear of any evils threatened by
the tempter, from which God is all-sufficient to shield us, but in obedience to
God, because he in his Word has commanded or forbidden them.

. Sect. 3 That carnal fear is a great hinderance unto godliness, and the
means to be freed from it.
Secondly, we are hindered by carnal fear in the duties of a godly life,
whilst thereby we are moved to think, that we shall never be able to
perform them, though we use all our endeavor; or if we have begun well, yet
we shall never hold out unto the end, by reason of our own frailties and
infirmities, the afflictions and troubles which cross us in these courses, and
the manifold and malicious tentations and persecutions, which are raised
against us by the enemies of our salvation. By which fears our minds are
troubled, our hearts vexed and turmoyled, our courage quailed, our resolutions
weakened, and we utterly disabled and discouraged from entering into this course
of Christianity, when as we have little or no hope of proceeding and continuing
in^^ unto the end, that we may be saved. The which tentation is much
strengthened, when we see the many faintings and faylings of others that have
gone before us, who professing Christianity, have either neglected the duties
belonging to it, or performed them to little purpose in a cold, formal and
careless manner; and in the end have wholly desisted and returned back to their
old prophanenes. Which impediment if we would remove, we must know that never
any did seriously and sincerely seek God in the ways of his commandments,
but they have assuredly found him. And therefore we must not be discouraged with
the faylings and relapses of hypocrites and temporaries, if our own conscices
testify unto us, that we labor to serve and please God in the uprightness of
our hearts. Secondly, our faintnes and weakness must not discourage us from
entering into, and proceeding in the ways of godliness, seeing we walk not in
our own strength, but by the power of God assisting us, nor by virtue of our
own resolutions and endeavors, but of Gods gracious and free promises made unto
us in Christ, that he will not only justify, but also sanctify us, and free
us as well from the corruption of sin, as the guilt and punishment. The which
if we apprehend by a true and lively Faith, we shall be able to overcome all
difficulties, and to serve God in some good and acceptable manner; as I have
more fully showed in the beginning of this Treatise. Finally, we need not to
fear our perseverance in the duties of godliness unto the end, if disclayming
our own strength, we rest and rely wholly upon Gods power and promises, seeing
he is able and all-sufficient to perfect that good work which he has begun,
to enable us likewise, who are impotent in our selves, to do all things
necessary for his glory and our salvation, Phil. 1. 6. and 4. 13. Ioh. 10. 28.
Romans 8. 35, 36, 38.
through the power of Christ which strengthens us. To arm us against all the
tentations of the devil, the world and our own flesh, so that all the power
of hell, the prosperity or persecutions of the world, nor any thing else
whatsoever, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, or to put out
and extinguish our love of him in our hearts; or to hinder our proceeding in
the ways of godliness, until by walking in them, we attain unto
everlasting joy and happiness.

. Sect. 4 That carnal sorrow is an impediment to a godly life.
Again, we are much hindered in the duties of a godly life, by carnal sorrow
and lumpish heaviness. For if (as the Apostle says) 2. Cor. 7.
worldly sorrow causes death, both in respect of the life of grace and glory,
then must it needs also disable us unto all actions of life, being made as
unfit for them hereby, as a man in the state of death, to perform any works of
the living. Now this heaviness and excessive sorrow arises from diverse causes,
as first, from the sight and sense of our innumerable and grievous sins, when
as it is not mixed with faith and the love of God, but merely arises out of
seruil fear and self-loue, apprehending Gods terrible Judgments against us for
our sins. Secondly, from the imperfection in our sanctification, whereof it is,
that our unmortified corruptions do rage and sway in us, disabling us unto
Gods service, and making us prone unto sin. That the duties which we perform,
are so full of wants and weaknesses, that we can with no comfort look upon
them. That the graces of Gods Spirit are imperfect, and continually assaulted
with our contrary corruptions; our faith with doubting; our affiance with
diffidence; our humility with pride; our repentance with security and hardness
of heart, and so in the rest. Thirdly, from our weakness in faith, persuading
us of the remission of our sins, and of our reconciliation and peace with
God. Fourthly, from spiritual desertions, whereby God estrangeth himself from
us, and seems to have left and forsaken us. Fifthly, from our fainting and
failing in the ways of godliness, and often relapses into sin. Sixthly,
from our manifold and sharp afflictions, which are so bitter and unpleasant to
the flesh, that they make us immoderately sorrowful, and to break out into
some impatiency, as though they were signs of Gods wrath and displeasure, and
not of his fatherly love correcting us for our amendment. Seventhly and lastly,
this sorrow arises in the hearts of weak Christians, when as they compare
themselves with others that have made a better and greater progress in the
graces of Gods Spirit, and in the duties of a godly life; being hereby moved to
think, that the graces which they see in others, are wholly wanting in
themselves, because their lesser light is obscured by a greater, and seems
nothing, because it is not of equal brightness. Or if they have any at all,
yet that it is false and hypocritical, because it is but of slender growth,
and much inferior to those which we observe in many others, whom
notwithstanding we have as much exceeded in means, as they us, in the fruits
of them. By which sorrows and heaviness, arising from these and such like
causes, the poor Christian does more and more weaken the operation of Gods
graces in him in the duties of a godly life, because he does too much already
apprehend their weakness, and more disableth himself, because he sees his
inability. For having with immoderate grief weakened his body, and spent his
spirits; oppressed his heart, and terrified his conscience, he is made lumpish
and dull, vncheerfull and uncomfortable in all the duties of Gods service. For
the removing of which impediment, we must carefully take heed that we do not
disioyne faith from our repentance; but as we have one eye upon our sins,
that we may sorrow for them, so the other eye upon our Savior Christ, who
has fully satisfied for them. Secondly, we must not dream upon any perfection
of sanctification in this life, though we labor after it, and then we shall not
be too much dejected, and mourn immoderately for our imperfection; whereas if
we fancy unto our selves a far greater measure of grace and holiness then it
is possible for us to attain, it will be a cause of excessive sorrow, when we
find how far we come short of our hopes. Thirdly, we must look upon Gods
graces, and the fruits of them in holy obedience, as testimonies of Gods love,
and evidences of our sanctification, and not as being any meritorious causes of
his favor, and our salvation. For then we need not to stand so much upon the
quantity and degree of them, as upon their sincerity and truth, which when we
find, we may rejoice in the assurance of Gods free grace and love through
Jesus Christ. Whereas if we look upon them in their worth and worthiness, the
sight of their imperfections will bereave our hearts of all sound comfort.
Fourthly, we must consider, that the first and least degrees of true grace are
accepted of God, and will make us also acceptable unto him. For he will not
break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax. He respects Math. 12.
20.
and tendreth his young lings and weaklings, as well as those who have attained
to greater strength; and he has pronounced them blessed, who Math. 5. 6.
hunger and thirst after righteousness, as well as those which are perfectly
righteous. Finally, as we must take notice of that we have not, that we may
labor after it, so also we must not neglect what we have, that we may be
truly thankful unto God, from whose free grace we have received it; among
which we may number spiritual life, whereby only we can be sensible of our
wounds and weakness, the sight and sense of our sins, by which we are moved
to deny our selves, and to fly unto Christ, hungring desires of grace and
holiness, seeing we have Gods promise that they shall be satisfied. And so we
shall join faith with our repentance, joy with our mourning, love and
thankfulness with our meekness and humility.

. Sect. 5 Of desperation, and that it is a great impediment to godliness.
Finally, these scrupulous fears, and carnal sorrow, if they be not removed
or moderated, will bring us by degrees, into that fearful gulf of deep
despair, whereby we shall cast off all hope of Gods mercy, and reject the
all-sufficient merits and satisfaction of Jesus Christ, through our
incredulity, as though the multitude and heinousness of our sins, did far
exceed them. And this is the very cutthroat of all piety, and the devils
strongest and most horrid chain, to inslaue men in his service, and to hinder
them from entertaining so much as a thought or desire of serving God in the
duties of a godly life. For it wholly discourageth a man from proceeding in
such a way, as offreth no hope of bringing him to his iourneys end. It makes a
servant wholly to neglect his duty, when as he is quite cut off from all
expectation of reward. It causes men to give themselves to all sensuality,
voluptuousness, and profaneness, when they have no other hopes, but what this
present life offers unto them; and the rather, that they may hereby put off,
for a little while, their terrors of conscience, and griefs of mind; as it
were by drinking of cold water in the fit of a fever. And wanting faith, by
which we are united unto Christ, in whom a lone we can bring forth fruits of
holiness and righteousness, how can we otherwise choose but be utterly barren
in all true obedience, and like wild Olive trees, bring forth only fruits of
impiety and wickedness? Which impediment if we would remove, we must remember,
that the Lord is infinite in grace and mercy, as he describes himself Exodus
34. 7.
in his Word, so that though our sins be many and grievous, yet they are
infinitely exceeded by them, for his mercies are above all his works. Micah 7.
18.
That he takes delight in showing mercy toward repentant sinners, seeing
hereby he exercises his nature, and magnifieth his holy name in the
manifestation of his grace and goodness. That he loved us when we were his
enemies; yea so loved us, that he sent his only begotten and dearly Ioh. 3.
16.
beloved Son to dye for us, and therefore will not now reject us, when as
through Christ we sue and seek to be reconciled unto him. That he has made
his free covenant of grace with us, wherein he has promised the remission of
all our sins, upon the alone condition of faith, bringing forth the fruits
thereof in unfeigned repentance, and that his promises are indefinite, without
exception of any sinners, and therefore shall assuredly belong unto us, if we
do not reject them through unbelief. That the merits and satisfaction of
Christ are of infinite value, and an all-sufficient satisfaction for the sins
of the whole world, if they were applied by faith; and that he has given unto
us his covenant in writing, and ratified it by his Sacraments, which he has
annexed as seals to the great Charter of our peace, that there might no place
be left to doubting. Finally, that our Savior Christ continually makes
intercession for us, pleading the all sufficiency of his merits and
satisfaction for our justification and salvation. So that though we sin, yet
this is our comfort, that we have an Advocate 1. Ioh. 2. 1, 2.
with the Father to plead our cause, even Jesus Christ the righteous, and he
is the propitiation for our sins.

. Sect. 6 That pride is a singular impediment to a godly life.
Besides these, there are diverse other carnal corruptions, which are notable
impediments unto a godly life. The first whereof is natural pride, whereby we
have an high conceit of our selves, and of every shadow and show of grace in
us, and imagine that we have so much already, that we need not to labor after
more, nor to use any means for enriching of our selves with those graces
whereof we stand in need. An example whereof we have in the Pharisees, who
thought they saw, when as they were blind, Ioh. 9. 31.
and therefore neglected the light of truth, when as the Sun of
righteousness did shine unto them. In the Laodiceans, who thought that they
were rich, and had need of nothing, when as they were poor and miserable,
Apoc. 3. 17.
blind and naked. In the young Iusticiary, who thought he had done all Math.
19. 20.
that God required of him, and attained unto perfection, when as yet he had
done nothing, but still remained the slave of sin, loaded with corruptions
and imperfections. And in the Corinthians, who proudly conceited that they were
rich, and reigned as Kings, not needing any help from the blessed Apostle,
when as still their lusts reigned in them. The which, above all other corrupt
affections, hinders us from proceeding in the ways of godliness. First,
because God denies to give his graces to such as being proudly conceited of
themselves, do not acknowledge that they stand in need of them, and
consequently would never be thankful for them. For he exalts the humble, and
pulls down the proud, he fills the hungry with good things, and sends
the full empty away. Secondly, Luke 1. 52, 53.
because they, thinking that they have enough already, never labor after more,
but neglect all good means which God has ordained for the begetting and
increasing of all his graces in us; and having scarce set one foot forward in
the course of Christianity, yet conceiting that they have almost attained unto
the Goal of perfection, and that they have far outstripped all others, they
stand still, as though there were no need of further proceeding. Now if we
would remove this impediment, we must mortify our carnal pride, and labor
after true humility, that having a sight of our sin and misery, we may not
content our selves, but labor to come out of this wretched estate. We must
strive to see and feel our wants and weaknesses, that so we may use all good
means whereby they may be supplied, and we strengthened; and the imperfections
of our best actions, that so we may labor after more perfection. We must
acknowledge our selves wounded and sick with sin, that Christ may heal and
cure us; weak in grace, that he may strengthen us; naked, that Apoc. 3. 18.
he may clothe us; poor, that he may enrich us; blind, that he may give us
sight, and lost in our selves, that he may save us. The second, is unjust
anger, frowardness, and peevishness, which for the time take away the use of
reason, and much more the power of Religion, making us unfit to pray, read, or
hear the Word of God, or to perform any other Christian duty, either unto
God, our neighbor, or our own person; and for the time so stifleth and
hinders the operations of Gods Spirit, and the holy motions of his Divine
graces dwelling in us, that scarce any semblance or show of them will appear,
either to others or our selves; as we see in the example of holy David, who in
his cooler thoughts and well tempred affections, made some scruple of cutting
Saul's garment, but being enraged 1. Sam. 25.
with fury, resolves on the death not only of Nabal who had offended him, but
of his whole family, who were innocent, and rather on his side then against
him. For the remoouing of which impediment, it is necessary that we do not
give way unto this unruly passion, according to the Apostles admonition, but
that we subdue and keep it under, not suffering the Sun to go down on our
wrath; using all good means to mortify Ephesians. 4. 26.
these carnal passions, and to attain unto the contrary grace of meekness
and gentleness, of which I have written at large in my Treatise of Anger.

. Sect. 7 That sloth and laziness is a great impediment to a godly life.
The third corrupt affection, is sloth and laziness, which makes men loath to
take pains in performing the duties of Gods service, as watchfulness, Prayer,
hearing the Word, Meditation, and the rest. For many having proceeded thus
far, as to approve these things in their judgments, and have some desires
and faint resolutions to put them in practice, yet when they find that they
cannot be done without some pains, being of an idle and sluggish disposition,
they are presently discouraged, and having found the treasure which is
sufficient to make them rich, choose rather to remain in their spiritual
beggary, then they will spend any sweat in digging for it. Needs then must this
be a great impediment to the duties of a godly life, when as men are so luskish
and lazy, that they fly that labor which is required unto them. Needs must
such sluggards live in poverty, seeing it is only the hand of the diligent
that makes rich. And Pro. 22. 13.
far off are they from atchieuing any excellent work, who sit idly still,
pretending excuses of danger and difficulty, and that there is a Lion without,
ready to slay them, if they go out into the street; which impediment if we
would remove, let us consider, that howsoever such men please themselves with
idle desires, yet they will nothing profit them, unless they shake off their
sluggishnesse, and use all diligence in their spiritual business. So Solomon
says, that the soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing; Pro. 13. 4.
but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. Yea, such desires, if we
rest in them, do hurt, rather then help us, according to that of Solomon; The
desire of the slothful kills him, for his hands refuse to labor. Secondly,
let Pro. 21. 25.
us consider, that by this sloth we do not only not get any spiritual riches,
but also that we consume that we already seem to have. For as our Savior
speaks in another case, He that gathers not, scatters abroad; Mat. 12. 30.
in which respect, Solomon makes that man which is slothful in his work,
(...)er to him that is a great waster. Thirdly, let us consider, that the Lord
Pro. 18. 9.
has appoin(...) this world to be a place of pains and labor, and reserueth
his Sabbath of rest for the world to come, after we have finished our work.
Here we must work in his Vineyard, and the night of death must come, before
we shall be called to receive our wages. Here we must keep our marks, and
there enjoy the riches which we have gotten by our spiritual trading. Here
we must fight the Lords battles, being covered with sweat and blood, and there
we shall obtain the Crown of victory. Finally, here we must travail like
poor Pilgrims, and then take our ease when we have finished our journey, and
are come safe to our heavenly home. Fourthly, let us call to mind the labors
of the Saints which have gone in this way before us, and especially of our
Savior Christ himself, who travailed for our sakes, not only unto weariness
and sweat, but even unto blood, and not foolishly imagine that we may take our
ease, and yet come timely and safely to the end of our hopes; seeing our
Savior has told us, that the Kingdom of heaven suffers violence, Mat. 11.
21.
and the violent take it by force, and that we must strive to enter into the
Luke 13. 24.
straight gate with all earnestness and constancy, because many shall seek
to enter, and shall not be able. Lastly, let us consider the punishments
denounced against those who idly sit still, and refuse to travel in the ways
of godliness. For it casts them into a deep sleep, whereby all the
operations of Gods graces are hindered, yea, it emptieth the sluggard of them
all, like him, who wanting meat, is famished with hunger: According to that of
Solomon; Sloathfulnesse casts into a deep sleep, and Pro. 19. 15.
the idle soul shall suffer hunger. And as it depriueth him of all grace in
this life, so also of glory and happiness in the life to come; for he only
must have the wages, who has labored in Christ's Vineyard. And contrariwise,
plungeth him into everlasting death and destruction. For the sloathfull and
unprofitable servant must be cast into outer Mat. 25. 26, 30.
darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And therefore, if
nothing else will move us, yet at least, let us take some pains in Gods
service, which being small and momentany, shall be everlastingly rewarded,
that we may escape the endless pains of hell. For if we cannot for a little
while endure the kindly heat of the Sun, how shall we be able to suffer
the skorching and tormenting flames of hell fire? If we are impatient of a
little sweat and labor in the duties of Christianity, and of our callings,
let us think with our selves how much more intolerable the endless torments
of the damned will be unto us.

. Sect. 8 Of weariness in well doing, and how it hinders us in all Christian
duties. And first, that which proceeds from an ill disposition of the body.
The last impediment which hinders us in the duties of a godly life, is
weariness in well-doing, which proceeds from a twofold cause. The first
outward, which is the ill disposition of the body to the performance of
Christian duties; proceeding either from external causes, as hunger, thirst,
heat, cold, excessive labor in worldly employments, and such like, or from
inward infirmities and diseases, which make the body faint and feeble, weak,
and unable to take any pains in the duties of a godly life. For seeing the
soul uses the body as its organ and instrument, for the performing of all
outward actions, and seeing there is such sympathy and familiarity between
them, that they mourn and rejoice together; hereof it must needs follow, that
when the body is indisposed to the duties of Gods service, the soul is thereby
unfitted for them; when the body is feeble and faint, the faculties of the
soul cannot be strong and vigorous in their actions and operations. When the
body is weary and full of pain, it must needs affect the mind, and much
distract it in all good duties. And finally, when the tool and instrument is
blunt and dull, unfit and untoward, the most cunning Artificer must needs be
hindered, and much fail in his curious workmanship. For the remoouing of which
impediment, we must use our best endeavor, that we may have a sound mind in
a sound body, and to use all good means of diet and Physic for the
preserving or recovering of our health, and to avoid intemperance, insobriety,
and excessive labor about worldly employments. Yea, we must avoid
immoderation and excess, even in the exercises of mortification, as fasting,
watching, and the rest; For as luxuriousness, delicacie, and sloth, do weaken
the body for want of exercise, and intemperance and insobriety do make it
feeble and unfit for any employment: so likewise the contrary extremes, and
ouer-rough and rigorous handling of it, do exhaust and consume the spirits,
and make it so weak and faint, that it is ready to sink under every burden.
And therefore we must carefully observe the mean, and avoid both extremes,
especially that unto which our corrupt nature inclines and carries us,
whether it be to sensuality, which pampereth the body with excess, or
willworship Col. 2. 23.
and superstition, in not sparing of it; which is not much less dangerous then
the other, although it be nothing so common and ordinary. For as if we would
make speedy iourneys, our Horse must neither be pampered nor starued, seeing by
the one he is made either resty or out of breath, and by the other so
enfeebled, that he will not be able to bear us: so is it with our bodies
which carry our souls, and therefore they must be used with like prudence and
providence.

. Sect. 9 Of weariness in well-doing, arising from the auersenesse of our wills
unto good duties.
The second cause is internal, which is the ill disposition of the mind and
will, being auerse unto all good duties and virtuous actions, and prone unto
all evil; delighting in worldly vanities, and pleasures of sin, and
dis-affecting and lothing spiritual exercises, as being wearisome and tedious,
difficult and troublesome to our corrupted nature. The which is a notable
impediment to our well proceeding in the ways of godliness; for either this
unwillingness causes such weariness, that it will make us either not to
enter into the Christian course, or soon desist and return again into our
former ways of wickedness and sensual delights, or else it will make us
unsettled and unconstant in all good duties, doing them only by fits and
flashes, when the good mood of devotion comes upon us, and neglecting them,
when other things which better please us come in the way; or finally, it
quenches our zeal and fervor of love unto the duties of Gods service, so
that we perform them weakly and wearily, coldly and formally, with much
dullness and spiritual deadness. The which impediments, if we would avoid,
we must labor and strive against this weariness and faintness in
well-doing, and endeavor all we may, to take away both these causes and
effects of it. And first we must rowze up our spirits, and stir up Gods
graces in 2. Tim. 1. 6.
us, as the Apostle exhorts, that we may not be weary of well-doing, by 2.
These. 3. 13.
considering the weight and worth, the profit and necessity of Christian and
religious duties, in comparison whereof, all worldly things ought to be
neglected as vain and of no value. Let us remember, that all the promises of
grace, life and salvation shall be assured unto us, if we faint not; whereas we
shall have no part or interest in them, though we have made never so good
beginnings or proceedings, if we do not still go forward and hold out unto
the end. For if we endure Matthew. 24. 13.
to the end, we shall be saved: if we fight unto the death, we shall receive
the Crown Apoc. 2. 10.
of Life. But if we lay our hand upon the Plough, and look back, we shall
Luke 9. 62.
not be though worthy of the Kingdom of heaven. Finally, let us daily renew
the means of Spiritual life and strength, that so they also may be renewed and
repaired, as hearing, reading, meditation, prayer, watchfulness, holy
conferences and the rest, without which the soul will grow faint and languish,
like the body which is deprived of corporal food; but especially when we feel
our faintness, and languishing weariness, let us unite all the powers of our
souls in prayer unto Almighty God, desiring him by the inward operation of his
holy Spirit, to quicken our deadness, and strengthen our weakness, that we
may not wax weary of well doing, but continue constant unto the end. Now
concerning the effects of this slothful weariness, which are also great
impediments to a godly life, as hindering us from entering into it, or proceeding
in it; inconstancy and vnsettlednesse in performing Christian duties, and want
of feruencie in our love and zeal in doing of them; I shall not need to add
any thing here for the remoouing of them, seeing I have spoken before of
perseverance, and constancy in the daily performance of all Christian duties,
and of that fervor of love and zeal, which ought to be used in doing of them.
And therefore thus much shall suffice to have spoken of those impediments which
arise from the flesh and corruption of our nature, and also of the helps and
means whereby we may remove them.

CAP. XIII.
Objections against a godly life made by the flesh, answered, and first, such
as pretend impossibility and difficulty.

. Sect. 1 That a godly life is possible unto us.
But the flesh does not only hinder us in the duties of a godly life, by those
real impediments, which it casts in our way, of which I have before spoken;
but also by suggesting into our minds, many strong objections, which tend to
this maine end, that we may be discouraged from entering into the course of
Christianity. And first, the flesh is ready to object, that in this state of
frailty and corruption, it is utterly impossible to lead a godly life, in that
manner as it has been before described. For who can bring that which is
clean, out of that which Job 14. 4.
is unclean? Who can lead such a life as is pleasing and acceptable unto God,
whose pure eyes can endure nothing which is impure and imperfect, seeing the
Prophet tells us, that our best righteousness is as Esaias 64. 6.
a polluted cloth; and the Apostle, who so far exceeded us that now live in
piety and righteousness, notwithstanding complayneth, that he could not do
the good he would, but contrariwise did the evil he would Romans 7. 15.
not. And therefore it is in vain to weary our selves about impossibilities,
and so to lose both the pleasures of this life, and that which is to come. And
thus the flesh persuades us to play the bankerupts, and to resolve, that
because we cannot pay all our whole debt, that therefore we will pay nothing
at all. To which I answer with our Savior Christ, that those things which are
impossible to us, are both possible and easy unto God, who has promised to
assist us, if we desire and endeavor to serve and please him. Secondly, I
answer, that though nothing will please God, but that which is pure and
perfect, and all our best actions are full of corruption and imperfection; yet
this need not to discourage us from doing the best we can, seeing Christ, who
has perfitly fulfilled the Law for us, covers our imperfections, with his
most perfect righteousness, and washes away our corruptions, in his most
precious blood, so that we may do the best we can, and then what is wanting on
our part, shall be supplied on his. For what the Law could not do, in Romans 8. 3.
that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son, in the likeness
of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the
righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit, as the Apostle speaks. Thirdly, though that
perfect obedience which the Law requires, be impossible unto us in respect of
our frailty and corruption, yet that Euangelical obedience, required in the
covenant of grace, (namely, that believing in Christ, we desire, resolve and
endeavor to please God in all things) is not so. Though we have no ability to
perform service unto God, in that exact perfection which the Law requires;
yet if we do that which we are able, in sincerity and truth, with upright
hearts and good consciences, we shall through Christ be accepted of God. For he
rejects not the least endeavors of his faithful servants, who desire Nehem.
1. 11.
to fear his name. He will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking
Matthew. 12. 20.
flax, till he bring forth judgment unto victory. He spares us as a father
spares Mal. 3. 17.
his son that serves him, and if we have a willing mind, we shall be accepted
according 2. Cor. 8. 12.
to that we have, and not according to that we have not. He pittieth our
frailties and infirmities, like as a father pittieth his children that fear
him, and Psalm. 103. 13, 14.
out of this pity pardons them; For he knows our frame, and remembers
that we are but dust. And though he has most pure eyes, which can endure no
pollution, yet he beholds not iniquity in Jacob, neither does he see Number. 23.
21.
perverseness in Israel. Nor is he any accepter of persons, but in every nation
he that Act. 10. 35.
fears him, and works righteousness (not according to the rigor of the law,
from which Christ has freed us, but in the truth and vprightnes of his heart)
is accepted of him. And thus was David accepted as a man according to Gods own
heart, because he applied himself to observe his precepts always Psalm. 119.
112.
and to the end, notwithstanding his grievous sins and fearful falls. Thus
Zacharias and Elizabeth were reputed righteous and perfect, because in the
sincerity and vprightnes of their hearts, they did labor and strive after
righteousness and perfection. And thus Asa is said to have done that which was
right in the sight of the Lord, notwithstanding his manifold 1. King. 15. 11,
14. 2. Chro. 24. 2. compared with Chap. 15. 7. and 16. 2, 7, 10, 12.
slips and great infirmities; because his heart was perfect or upright before
him. So that the impossibility of leading a godly life need not to discourage
us, seeing the Lord is all-sufficient to make it possible unto us, for he that
could create us pure and holy, according to his own Image, is as able to
restore us to this purity and perfection. Unto which, though it be not his
pleasure, that we should attain in this life, because he would train us up
in humility, and move us to ascribe unto him the whole glory of our salvation;
yet will he enable us unto such a measure and degree as himself will accept
of, as it it were in full perfection; and daily add unto his own gifts of
grace, until we come to a full age in Christ; for unto every one that has,
shall be given, until he have abundance, as our Savior speaks. Matthew. 25.
29.


. Sect. 2 To whom a godly life is difficult, and the causes of it.
Secondly, the flesh is ready to object, that though the duties of a godly life
are not absolutely impossible, yet at least they are so full of difficulty, and
unpleasant, so tedious and troublesome to our feeble and frail natures, and so
uncomfortable and painful, that there is no likelihood, that ever we shall
hold out in the doing of them; and therefore it is as good for us to neglect
them altogether, as to take upon us such an insupportable burden, as we shall
be forced to cast off, before we come half way to our iourneyes end. The which
objection our corrupt flesh does much strengthen against us, to hinder our
Christian resolution, and both our ingresse and progress in the ways of
godliness, by setting before us the manifold examples of those, that have
lived in former times, and in our own days, who having made some good
beginnings, have fallen back and relapsed into their former courses; and having
begun well with a purpose to proceed, have through weariness desisted,
before they could attain to their iourneyes end. And thus, like the sluggard,
the flesh persuades us to sit still in the house, because there is Pro. 26. 13.
a Lion in the streets. And like the murmuring spies, though it confesses
that the spiritual and heavenly Canaan be worth the desiring, as abounding
with all Gods blessings, yet it brings up an evil report of it, in respect
of the manifold difficulties whereby we must pass unto it, and the sons of
Anachim, the mighty enemies of our salvation, which must be overcome by us, who
are so far inferior unto them in strength, before we can attain unto that
place of rest and joy. The which tentation is exceeding dangerours, and a
notable impediment to hinder many from once entering into the course of
Christianity, because they imagine it to be so irksome and painful, that
they shall quickly be tired, and never be able to hold out unto the end. For
the answering whereof, that it may be no impediment unto us in the ways of
godliness, we are first to know and acknowledge, that it is true in part;
namely, that the course of Christianity is full of difficulties, hard and
tedious, unpleasant, and even intolerable and impossible in some respects. For
the Devil, which is that strong man, who holds all that he possesses in
peace, will not easily leave his hold, nor Mar. 9. 25, 26.
be cast out without many combats and conflicts. And howsoever he seems
deaf and dumb, whilst he is in quiet possession, and lulleth us asleep in
the cradle of carnal delights, yet when our Savior Christ by the Ministry of
the Word and Gospel, seeks to dispossess and cast him out, then he both
hears and cries out, rages and renteth us, with the violence of his
tentations, making us to seem both to our selves and others, as if we were
quite deprived of all spiritual life. And though this infernal Pharaoh
suffers us, whilst we do him service, to sit quietly by the fleshpots of
worldly and sensual delights, and even to glut our selves, and take our fill
of the pleasures of sin, without any great disturbance; yet no sooner do we
inwardly resolve, and outwardly make mention of departing out of his bondage,
that we may serve the Lord, but presently he rages against us, and pursues us
with hellish fury, that he may hinder us in our Spiritual journey toward the
heavenly Canaan, and again recover us into his captivity. Again, the
practice of Christianity becomes unto us tedious and difficult by reason of
our sloth, which makes us unwilling to take any pains in the duties of a
godly life; and every thing seems tedious and wearisome to a mind that is
indisposed and auerse unto it. And also because of our carnal sensuality,
which makes us think that we are not at liberty, if we may not run with
full careere into all manner of licentiousness. And like unto those Heathen
Rulers, to fret and fume, when we are restrained from going on in our wicked
courses by Gods Law; saying, Let us break his bonds Psalm. 2. 1, 1, 3.
asunder, and cast away his cords from us. And hereof it is, that the godly
life is in the Scriptures compared to a wearisome pilgrimage, which cannot be
finished without much pains and travail; to a dangerous Warfare, in which we
must have many a sore and dangerous conflict, before we get the victory; to a
narrow and afflicted way Matthew. 7. 12, 13.
and strait gate, through which we cannot pass without much striving. So
likewise to the mortification and cutting off our bodily members, which cannot
be without much grief; To a circumcision, yea, the circumcision of the heart:
and how can the heartstrings be cut, without much sense of pain? And finally,
to the birth of a child, which cannot be without sore travail going before.
Now if the infant which has continued but nine months in the mothers womb,
cannot in the ordinary course of nature be borne without much pain and many
sharp throws; then how much less can we be spiritually borne again without
great grief and labor, who have lain for the space of many years in our
sins, and strengthened our natural corruptions with long and continual
custom; seeing this is a work contrary unto and above nature?

. Sect. 3 The causes why the duties of a godly life seem difficult and tedious
even to the regenerate. Romans 7 22.
Again, the duties of a godly life are somewhat tedious and troublesome, even
unto the regenerate, who have made some entrance into them, because this work
of regeneration is not perfected at once, but only inchoate and begun. And
therefore, as they are delighted with the Law of God in the inner man, so they
find another law in their members, Romans 7. 23, 24.
warring against the Law of their minds, and leading them captive to the law
of sin. The which spiritual bondage affects them with such grief and
sorrow, that it forces them to cry out with the Apostle; O wretched Gal. 5. 17.
man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? We are not
wholly and perfectly sanctified, but remain partly flesh, and partly spirit,
like a city which is at civil wars within it self. And these do
continually lust the one against the other; So that no sooner do we set our
selves to perform any Christian duties of a godly life, in the spiritual
part; but presently the flesh opposes and interrupteth us in it. No sooner do
we resolve to go forward in the ways of godliness, but forthwith the
corruption of our nature, like an heavy burden, incompasseth us, and (as it
were) clingeth about our necks, so as we cannot proceed without much labor
and weariness. All which and many other the like impediments, as they do much
disturb and distract all in the duties of a godly life, so especially young
beginners at their first entrance into it. For then the Heb. 12. 1.
flesh is strongest to oppose, and the Spirit weakest to make resistance. Then
the world and worldly wicked men, do use most endeavor to regaine us into
their wonted society in the works of darkness, when we have newly left their
company; and the pleasures of sin, and the baytes of worldly profits,
alluring us to continue in our wonted courses, are freshest in our memories,
when as we have lately renounced and forsaken them, so as they are still
scarce out of our sight. Then the devil bends all his might and malice, his
stratagems and engines of battry against us (as Sennacherib against Hezechiah)
when we do disclaim his service, and refuse to pay him tribute. Then we
meet with gteatest difficulties, and have least strength to overcome them.
Then we go in the ways of Christianity, like little children, when they
first learn to go alone, who at every step are ready to stagger and fall,
through weakness and want of practice; whereas when we have accustomed our
selves to these courses, for some months or years, we go both more steadily
and with much greater safety and delight. Finally, then we are like unto
sluggards, who leave their down-beds with much irkesomnes and discontent, but
when they they have once risen and shaken off their sloth, they are sorry that
they have slept so long, and go cheerfully about their business. Neither did
ever man repent of his repentance, though at the first entrance it seemed
unpleasant and difficult, but rather feels such joy and comfort in it, that
he much grieueth in his soul, that he was no sooner grieved for his sins. Now
this difficulty is much increased unto young beginners by diverse means. Frst,
because they are apt to trust too much unto their own strength, which most
fails those that most rest upon it, and do not walk in the life and
strength of faith, relying themselves wholly upon Gods power and promises. For
so naturally are we, through pride and self-love, addicted to our selves, that
we will not easily seek for help abroad, so long as any hope remains that
we shall find it at home. Secondly, because in our first beginnings we are more
fickle, unconstant, and unsettled in our Christian courses. For how can he make
any good proceedings in his way, who sometimes goes forward, and sometimes
backward? how can he dispatch his business, who undoes one day that which he
did in another? or how should a man preserve his health and strength, who one
day carefully uses good diet or physic, and the next day neglects both,
and impayreth and hinders them by the quite contrary courses? Finally, because
we look more unto our selves then unto God, and so seeing the difficulty of
the work, and comparing it with our own weakness, we begin to despair
of ever atchieuing it; but in the mean time seldom or never look unto God,
who is all-sufficient to strengthen us, and to make us perfect unto every good
work. We apprehend our weakness to go alone, and are thereby discouraged,
because we consider not that we are led and supported by the hand of our
heavenly Father. We see our wounds and weaknesses, but not the salues and
remedies. We behold with Elias servant, who are against us, but through our
spiritual blindness cannot discern the more numerous and potent aids that
are on our side. And finally, we are ready with the Apostle to take notice of
the Law of our members, warring against the law of our Romans 7. 24, 25.
minds, and leading us captive to the law of sin; but not with him to
acknowledge with thankfulness our deliverance by Jesus Christ: And to be
discouraged with the sight and sense of our infirmities; but not to 2. Cor. 12.
9.
consider, that Gods grace is sufficient for us.

. Sect. 4 That the difculty of a godlife must not discourage us from it.
In all which respects it cannot be denied, but that there is some difficulty
in leading of a godly life, and much pains and labor required for the right
performance of the duties which belong unto it. Notwithstanding this must be
no impediment to hinder us from entering into, and proceeding in the course of
Christianity. Yea rather, because this above all things is most excellent,
profitable and necessary, as concerning us, no less then the everlasting
salvation or condemnation both of our bodies and souls, the difficulties which
we find in this way, should be so far from discouraging and making us sit
still, or turn back again to enjoy our sinful pleasures; that they should
rather inflame our disires, whet and confirm our resolutions, and make us much
more painful and diligent in our endeavors, that we may attain unto it,
seeing though the difficulty were much greater, yet the excellency, profit, and
necessity of leading such a life do far exceed it. And this use our Savior
Christ makes of it; For from the consideration of the small number which shall
be saved, and the difficulty of attayning unto heavenly happiness, he
enforces this exhortation; Strive to enter in at the straight gate, for many,
I say unto you, Luke 13. 24. Matthew. 7. 13, 14
will seek to enter in, and shall not be able: Because straight is the gate,
and narrow is the way which leads unto life, and few there be that find it.
So he tells us elsewhere, that the Kingdom of God suffers violence, and
the Matthew. 11. 12.
violent take it by force. And the Apostle Peter having said, that the
righteous shall scarcely be saved, that is, not without much difficulty and
laborious 1. Pet. 4. 18, 19.
diligence, takes thereupon occasion to persuade all, both to patient
suffering what God imposes, and diligent doing that which he inioyneth. And
surely if we had hereby no other benefit, but the escaping of the everlasting
torments of hell fire, which are easelesse and endless, it were me thinks a
motive strong enough to make us arm our resolution against all difficulties,
and to spare for no labor, that we may secure our selves from this dreadful
condemnation. He that is in danger of drowning, does not dispute of the great
pains which he must take before he can come to land, but thinking that his
strength can be no ways better spent, then in saving his life, he uses all
diligence, and labors even to extreme weariness, to secure his safety, yea
even then when he is doubtful of the success. And shall we think all labor
little, to preserve a momentany and miserable life, from a natural death: and
can we think any too much for the escaping of those everlasting torments of
hell fire? O that our fore-wit were as good as our after-wit! and that we could
be as wise by instruction and discourse of reason, as we are by feeling and
experience! O that we could consider with our selves, when we stumble at small
difficulties, and are discouraged from performing the duties of a godly life
with a little labor; how much less we shall be able to endure those
intolerable and endless torments, which are prepared for those who neglect
Gods service, and are slaves to Satan, and their own sinful flesh, to obey it
in the lusts thereof! If the easy pains of a godly life be not to be endured
of these nice and worldly wantons, which are also of such short continuance,
how intolerable will those torments be unto them which shall never have end?
If the damned spirits might have liberty to resume their bodies, and live upon
the earth again for a further trial, that amending their lives, they might
be saved, or returning unto their former sinful courses, they might be cast
back again into hell fire: O how would they melt, and be even resolved into
tears of hearty repentance for those sins which have made them obnoxious to
such fearful condemnation! How would they labor and spend their strength in
the exercises of mortification, and make their throats hoarce with prayers and
strong cries, that they might obtain mercy and forgiveness? How diligent
would they be in hearing, reading, and meditating in the Word, that they might
attain unto a lively faith, and thereby apply unto themselves Christ Jesus and
his righteousness, for their justification and salvation? How fruitful would
they be in good works; and how liberal and bountiful in almsdeeds, and in
relieuing the poor members of Jesus Christ? And yet most certain it is, that
their case shall be ours, if we run on in the same courses which they have
gone before us, seeing God is no respecter of persons, but is alike just and
true to all. Our punishments shall be as great, if we neglect Gods service, and
live in our sins; our too late repentance as desperate and comfortless, if
we abuse Gods patience and long-suffering, and let pass the acceptable time
and day of salvation.

. Sect. 5 That the recompense of reward must make us to overcome all
difficulties.
And yet there is a far stronger motive to make us overcome all difficulties,
and to use all paineful diligence in the duties of a godly life, namely, the
riches of reward promised to all those who spend their time and strength in
Gods service, even the everlasting joys of his Kingdom, unto which, both all
the sufferings and doings of this life are not to worthy Romans 8. 18.
to be compared. In which regard, Gods precepts are more to be desired Psalm.
19. 10, 11.
then gold, yea then much fine gold, and to be esteemed sweeter then the honey,
and the honey comb; because by them we are warned, and in keeping of them
there is great reward. For who would not serve such a Master, as is so
bountiful in requiting his pains? Who would not undertake any labor (seeing
the greatest is light, and the longest momentany) to be assured of that
super-exceeding and eternal weight of glory? Who would not patiently endure a
sorrowful seed-time, for so joyful an harvest? or refuse to work in Gods
Vineyard with all painful diligence, and comfortable cheerfulness, who is
assured of such liberal wages when he has ended his work? And therefore
though there were never so much difficulty in the duties of a godly life, and
never so much pains required unto the service of God, this should not
discourage us from entering into the course of Christianity, seeing our wages
and reward will infinitely exceed our work and labor. Especially considering
that these holy and religious duties are only unpleasant and tedious to the
flesh and corrupted nature, unto which (as the Apostle speaks) we are no
debtors that we should live according to the lusts thereof; and so by pleasing
of it, to displease God, and purchase unto our selves eternal death and
hellish condemnation.

. Sect. 6 That a godly life, in it own nature is not difficult and tedious,
but sweet and delightful.
Neither in truth are the duties of a godly life unpleasant and burdensome,
tedious and troublesome unto the spiritual and regenerate part, 1. Joh. 5. 3.
Mat. 11. 29, 30. Chrysostom. in Mat. 11. Homil. 39.
but sweet and delightful, easy and full of comfort. For Gods Commandments
are not grievous, as the Apostle John speaks; and our Savior tells us,
that his yoke is easy, and his burden light; and that they who will take them
upon them, shall find rest to their souls. Upon which words Chrysostom
speaks excellently to our present purpose. If (says he) hearing of a yoke
and a burden, thou art afraid and shrinkest back, thou must attribute this
fear, not to the nature of the things themselves, but to thine own sloth; for
if thou art prepared, and not sluggishly effeminate, all shall seem unto thee
easy and light. And therefore Christ, that he might teach us with what care we
ought to watch, has neither concealed the burden, nor the sweetness; but
joining both together, he has said, that it is a yoke, and also that it is
sweet. He calls it a burden; but adds, that it is light; that thou
should not shun it, as being too laborious, nor contemn it, as being too
easy. But if after all this, virtue seems unto thee hard and difficult,
consider how much more vice and sin, which Christ intimates, in that before
he said any thing of his yoke, he cries out, Come unto me all, ye that
labor and are heavy laden. Thereby showing, how great labor, and what an
intolerable burden sin imposes: for he says, not only all ye that labor,
but also, who are heavy laden. The which the Psalmist expresses more plainly,
and describes the nature of sin, saying, Mine iniquities are gone over mine
head, as Psalm. 38. 4.
an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. And Zachary likewise, where he
calls it a talent of lead. For experience will teach us, that the soul is
oppressed Zach. 5. 7.
with no heavier burden, then the conscience of an ill spent life, and the
remembrance of our sins; even as contrariwise nothing more exalts and
cheereth the mind, then the possession of justice and virtue. Yea, that
Evangelical obedience which Christ here calls his yoke and burden, is not
only light and easy, but also commodious and exceeding profitable. Which made
David, out of good experience, to profess, that the Law of Gods mouth was
better unto him, then thousands of gold and silver: Psalm. 119. 72, 127 Psalm.
19. 10. Pro. 8. 11, 18, 19
and that it was more to be desired then gold, yea then much fine gold. And
Solomon likewise affirms, that wisdom (that is, the saving knowledge and
practice of true godliness) is better then Rubies, and all things that may be
desired, are not to be compared unto it: that riches and honor are with it,
yea, durable riches and righteousness; and that the fruit thereof is better
then gold, yea then fine gold, and its reuenew then choice silver. Yea, the
duties of a godly life are not only easy and profitable, but also sweet and
pleasant. In which respect David says, that Gods Commandments were sweeter to
his Psalm. 19. 9. Psalm. 119. 103, 111. Verse. 14. Prou. 2. 10. and 3. 17. Ioh. 4.
34.
mouth then the honey, and the honey comb; that they were the rejoicing of his
heart, and that he rejoiced in Gods testimonies, above all riches. So Solomon
says, that wisdom is pleasant unto the soul, and that her ways are ways
of pleasantness, and her paths are peace. And our Savior Christ found so much
pleasure and comfort in doing his Fathers will, that he neglected his food,
even when he was hungry, in comparison of it. Now if the way of Gods
Commandments was esteemed of the Saints so easy, profitable and pleasant in
the time of the Law; how much more have we cause so to judge of it in the time
of the Gospel? seeing God has revealed his will much more clearly, and
affoorded us far greater helps; and encouraged us to serve him with much
sweeter and more gracious promises, not now veiled with types and shadows, but
clearly expressed to the understanding of the most simple, and certainly
assured unto us by the seals, the Sacraments, to take away from us all
doubting and wavering. By all which, and many other means, our Savior Christ
(as it was prophesied of him) makes all crooked ways straight, and all rough
places plain; that all Esa. 40. 4.
difficulties being taken away and removed, we may travel in the ways of
godliness with much ease and comfort, joy and delight. But above all other
encouragements against all pretended difficulties, this is one of the greatest,
in that the Lord, in the time of the Gospel, does not exact of us the rigorous
and strict performances of servants, who must not have their wages, unless
they do the will of their Lord, in that manner and measure as he requires;
but the duty and obedience of sons, passing by Mal. 3. 17. 2. Cor. 8. 12.
our infirmities, and accepting the will for the deed; the purpose and
endeavor, for the act and performance. And that there may be no manner of
discouragement, has also promised to assist us with his grace and holy Spirit,
that we may be the better enabled to do that which he requires; so as we may
say with the Apostle, I am able to do all things through the Phil. 4. 13.
power of Christ which strengthens me.

CAP. XIIII.
That a godly life is not tedious and troublesome to the regenerate man, but
easy and familiar.

. Sect. 1 That the regenerate have a new nature, unto which a godly life is
easy and pleasant.
ANd thus it appears, that the godly life is easy and pleasant in it self
and it own nature. Now if we can further prove, that it is also unto us
nothing hard or impossible, tedious or troublesome, but contrariwise easy and
familiar, then the objection of difficulties being sufficiently answered and
removed, need not to be any impediment to hinder us from entering into the ways
of godliness. To which purpose we are first to know, that howsoever the
leading of a godly life be as hard and difficult, as grievous and even
impossible for a natural man, as for Lead to swim, or for the earth to leave
its center, and to mount up unto the skies; yet unto those who are regenerate,
it is not so, seeing their corrupt nature is changed and sanctified, and they
have a new nature wrought in them, unto which a godly life is easy and
familiar, by reason of that similitude which is between them. And thus the
Lord, when he would have his people to serve him in the duties of holiness
and righteousness, does promise to work this change in them: And the Lord thy
God will circumcize thine Deuteronomy. 30. 6, 11, 14.
heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine
heart, and all thy soul, etc. For this commandment which I command thee, is
not hidden from thee, neither is it far off, etc. But the Word is very nigh
unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thine heart, that thou may do it. And
again, I will give Ezekiel. 11. 19, 20 and 36. 26, 27.
them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you, and I will take the
stony heart out of their flesh, and I will give them an heart of flesh, that
they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them. So in the
new covenant of grace the Lord promises, that he would write his Law, not in
Tables Jer. 31. 33.
of stone, but in the fleshie tables of their hearts, and put it into their
inward parts; thereby inabling them to yield unto it cheerful obedience,
seeing they have an internal cause of this spiritual motion in themselves,
even an heart sanctified and replenished with the love and fear of God, which
makes them to desire above all things to serve and please him. In respect of
which change (so far forth as they are changed and regenerate) it is no more
tedious and wearisome unto them to perform the duties of a godly life, then
for the living fountain to spring, or the river to flow, or for gross vapors
and slimie exhalations to mount aloft into the middle and highest region of the
air, when as they are rarefied by the Sun, and have their nature changed
from an earthly grosnesse, to an ayery or fiery subtilty and lightness;
although the relics of sin and corruption of nature remaining still in the
unregenerate part, do hang upon us, and pull us back, hindering us in our
spiritual motion (like an exhalation enclosed with the vapors of the middle
region, so as it cannot mount up unto his own proper place) whereof arise some
tedious conflicts and sharp incounters, which make the duties of a godly life
to seem unto us by fits more difficult and wearisome. Yea, if we rest upon
our own strength and abilities, the infirmities and corruptions which we shall
discover, will be notable discouragements to hinder us in the ways of
godliness, and like children which presume to go alone, when they have only
strength to walk as they are led in their fathers hand, we shall, by receiving
many falls and knocks, be so daunted and dismayed, that we shall be afraid to
set a foot forward in the duties of Christianity, as far exceeding our
abilities of performance. Whereas, if seeing our frailties and infirmities, we
take occasion thereby to deny our selves and our own strength, and wholly
distrust the weak reed of our own free wills, as being utterly insufficient
to stay and uphold us in our Christian course: And contrariwise, altogether
rely upon Gods power and promises, and acknowledge that his grace is
sufficient, when we most see and bewail our own weakness and impotencie;
we shall hereby receive no discouragement, 2. Cor. 12. 9.
but go on cheerfully in all holy duties of his service. For when we are
most blind and ignorant, this grace of God will be all-sufficient to
inlighten us; when we are most weak and feeble, it will confirm and
strengthen us; when we most distaste the duties of Christianity, as being
bitter and unpleasant to our corrupted nature, it will, by changing and renewing
it, make them to become easy and pleasant, and (as we see in the example of
David) sweeter unto our mouths then the honey and the honey comb. When we
feel the flesh rebelling and Psalm. 19. 9, 10.
lusting against the Spirit, it will mortify and subdue it; And when our
tumultuous passions and inordinate affections do rage in us, striving to carry
us with headlong fury, from the service of God, to the service of Satan, the
world, and our own unruly lusts, it will powerfully purge away their
corruption, rectify their disorder, and make them become serviceable to the
spiritual part; like wild beasts, which being in their own nature fierce and
cruel, and ready to devour or tear us in pieces, when they are mastred and
tamed, become helpefull and commodious for diverse uses. And thus the grace of
God sanctifies our love, and weaning it from worldly vanities, fixes it upon
spiritual and heavenly things. Thus it changes our choler into zeal; our
hatred of good things into the hatred of that which is evil; our worldly
sorrow, into repentant grief for sin; our carnal joy into spiritual
rejoicing in the assurance of Gods favor; and our desperate boldness and
audaciousnesse, into Christian courage, and magnanimous resolution, which will
enable us valiantly to oppose and overcome all difficulties, which would
discourage and hinder us in the profession and practice of true godliness. So
that the difficulty of Christian duties, compared with our own frailties and
infirmities, will not discourage us, if we do not sever the Law from the
Gospel, looking only upon that obedience which it requires, and not unto that
grace of God which the Gospel promises, and which he purposely bestows upon
us, that thereby we may be enabled to perform that which he commands. But
rather the sight and sense of our own weakness, will but make us cling the
faster to the firm pillar of our strength, and to flee unto him in our earnest
and effectual prayers, desiring him to command what he will, if withal he
will give unto us grace and strength to perform those duties which he
commands.

. Sect. 2 That a godly life is made easy, through the power of God the Father
assisting us.
Secondly, the duties of a godly life, which are so difficult, in respect of
our frailty and corruption, become easy and familiar unto us, not only in
respect of this grace, whereby our natures are changed and renewed; but also in
respect of those fresh supplies which we daily have from God himself, even
the Father, Son, and holy Spirit. For first, God the Father does not content
himself to have regenerated us, and renewed our nature, and so to leave us,
but he daily repaireth our decayed strength; he does not only infuse some
spiritual graces into us, and so leave us to be vpheld by their inherent
strength, but he still stands by us, and continually assisteth us by his
power and providence, out of his rich Treasury supplying what is wanting,
strengthening us when we are ready to faint; raising us, when we slip and
fall; repairing his graces with new supplies, when they are spent and wasted,
and (as it were) re-inforcing his spiritual Bands and Troops, when as they
are enfeebled and wearied in the conflict of tentations. He not only
commands the duties of his service, but also that we may be both encouraged
and enabled to do them; he promises his assistance, and that he will join
with us, supplying by his all-sufficient power, what is wanting through our
weakness. Thus he wills us to Joel. 2. 12.
repent and turn unto him, and Jer. 31. 18.
works also this conversion and repentance, exhorts us to Jer. 4. 4.
circumcize our hearts, and withal, Deuteronomy. 30. 6.
promises that he will circumcize them, inioyneth us to Deuteronomy. 10. 12.
love and fear him, and Romans 5. ^.
sheadeth abroad his love in our hearts by his holy Spirit, whereby he
inflameth them with love toward him, and Ier. 32. 40.
puts his fear into them, that we dare not depart from him, by doing
wilfully any thing that is displeasing in his sight. Though then we be
naturally barren in the fruits of new obedience, yet this must not discourage
us, seeing the Lord has promised, that he will make us trees of
righteousness planted by his own Esa. 61. 3. Psalm. 1. 3.
right hand, which shall bring forth fruit in due season, like trees planted
by the rivers of waters, and that he will power the sweet dewes of his grace
upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground. If we be feeble Esa.
44. 3, 4.
and weak in our own strength; yet the Lord himself will strengthen and
encourage us in every good work by his gracious presence; saying, Fear thou
not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God, Esa. 41. 10, 11, 14.
I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with
the right hand of my righteousness. I the Lord thy God will hold thy right
hand, saying unto thee, Fear not, I will help thee. When we find and feel
our faintnes and feeblenes in holy duties, let not this make us to desist and
give them over, as impossible to be achieved; but let us remember, that the
everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not,
neither Esa. 40. 28, 29, 30, 31.
is weary; who gives power to the faint, and to them that have no might,
increases strength. So that though those who are in their youth and prime age,
be weary, faint, and utterly fall, yet if being humbled in the sense of our
own weakness, we do deny our selves, and wait upon the Lord, he will renew
Phil. 1. 6.
our strength, and we shall mount up with wings as Eagles; we shall run, and not
be weary; and walk, and not be faint. This work of regeneration is not our
own, but the Lords, who is as able and willing to perfect a work, as to begin
it; for not to finish what he has undertaken and begun, were a sign either of
inconstancy, or want of power, whereas he is immutable and omnipotent;
according to that of the Prophet, Shall I bring to the birth, and not Esa. 66.
9.
cause to bring forth, says the Lord? shall I cause to bring forth, and shut
the womb, says thy God? Though then the duties of a godly life seem unto us
hard, difficult, and even impossible; yet let not this discourage us, seeing
nothing is impossible with God; though they be so far above our abilities,
Luke 1. 37.
that they also exceed our hopes, so as we scarce dare sue and seek after that
power of performance which God requires, and we desire; let us remember, that
the Lord is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that we ask or Ephesians. 3.
20.
think, according to the power that works in us. And though we are ready to
stumble at every stone of offense, and to sink in every tentation, let us go
on cheerfully for all this, seeing our God is able to keep us from falling,
and to Jude verse. 24.
present us faultlesse before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.
Yea, he is ready to prevent us with his grace, and not only to work in us (as
in the Prodigal son) some good desires of returning unto our heavenly Father,
Luke 15.
that we may serve him; but even when he sees us afar off, he will run to
meet us, give us kind intertainment, and feast us so with a banquet of his
graces, that we shall be enabled with cheerfulness to do his work. And
therefore, though we find never so mighty opposition, as soon as we are entered
into the course of Christianity, yet being assured of Gods presence and
assistance, let not this dismay us; For if God be with us, who can be against
Romans 8. 31.
us? Pharaoh may well frown and storm against us, but his ruin shall be our
safety. The devil may rage, and (as it were) rend us with his tentations, but
out he must come and leave his hold, when God commands him. Though we
apprehend the greatness and difficulty of the work, and our own weakness
and insufficiency to go through with it; let not this discourage us from
undertaking it: for the Lord is with us, his grace is all-sufficient, and his
power is manifested and glorified in our infirmities. Though we are weak 2.
Cor. 12. 9. Ephesians. 6. 10, 13.
in our own strength, and able to do nothing, yet we are strong in the Lord,
and in the power of his might, and (with the Apostle) able to do all things,
through the power of Christ, which strengthens us. Though we through our
corruption, are prone to fall into any sin; the Lord shall deliver us from
every evil 2. Tim. 4. 18.
work, and preserve us unto his heavenly Kingdom: and finally, though we are
so fettred and gauled with our natural corruptions, that we can scarce creep
in the ways of Gods Commandments, yet we may resolve to run Psalm. 119. 32.
in them with great agility and swiftness, when he shall be pleased to enlarge
our hearts. They (says an ancient Father) who resolve to pass from the love
of worldly pleasure, unto an honest and virtuous life, find it at the Cyr. in
Hesaiam. lib. 4. cap. 55.
first a rough and uncouth way, which is hardly passable. For the sweetness of
a long settled and confirmed custom, opposes and hinders them, and lothnesse
to break it, does much intoxicate and disturb their minds. Neither can our
carnal affections be easily shunned or subdued, nor is the way of virtue
plain and easy to every one who offers to run in it. But yet, God
prospering and helping us forward, and smoothing and leuelling these rough and
impassable ways, a man may easily escape, or overcome the assaults of his own
carnal affections, and courageously mount unto the top of the hill of virtue.

. Sect. 3 That God the Son joining with us, takes away all difficulty.
Secondly, God the Son joining with us in the duties of a godly life, will
take away all difficulty, and enable us to perform them with all cheerefulnes
and delight. For being united unto him by a true and a lively faith, and
ingrafted into this blessed and fruitful Vine, as living branches, we shall
receive such spiritual life and sap of grace from him, that we shall bring
forth the ripe grapes and pleasant fruits of holiness and righteousness. Being
knit unto him in this blessed union, and becoming lively members of his body,
we shall have communion with him, and receive such virtue and vigor, as shall
be effectual, not only for our justification, but also for our sanctification.
From his death Romans 6. 4.
we shall receive virtue and strength for the mortifying of the flesh and the
sinful lusts thereof, so as it shall no longer reign and rule in us as in
former times, and from his Resurrection such a quickening power, as will enable
us to rise out of the grave of sin, and to walk in the ways of holiness and
righteousness, bringing forth the plentiful fruits of new and true obedience.
Besides, our Savior, who exhorts us to take his yoke upon us, offreth
himself to join with us, and to be our yoke fellow; and as the taller and
stronger Ox, drawing together with one that is less and weaker, eases him of
the chiefest part of the burden; so our Savior so far exceeding us in
greatness and strength, does free us from all irkesomnesse and cumbersome
tediousness of that burden which he lays upon us, by bearing it up upon his
own blessed neck and shoulders. Neither does he call us unto him to trouble
and vex us, but to ease and comfort us. Not to oppress us with a burden above
our strength, but to lighten us of the intolerable load of sin, by taking it
upon himself, in stead whereof, he lays upon us his sweet and easy yoke of
Evangelical obedience; according to that his gracious call and inuitation,
Come unto me, all ye Matthew. 11. 28, 29, 30.
that labor and are heavy laden, and I will ease you; take my yoke upon you
and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest
unto your souls; for my yoke is easy, and my burden light. So that though it
be a yoke and burden, yet it needs not dismay us, seeing it is but light and
easy, in comparison of that unsupportable weight of sin, the wrath of God, and
curse of the Law, from which he has freed us; and not such an one as will
toil and turmoile us; but a burden that brings ease, and a labor which
causes rest. It is not Christ's purpose to surcharge and oppress us, by
imposing a burden above our strength; for he that has taught us that a good
man is merciful unto his beast, Pro. 12. 10.
will not be hard-hearted and cruel to his yoke, fellows, yea to his own
body and bowels; but only he desires that we would bear him company,
promising that if our weight be ouer-burthensome, he will ease us, if it be
irksome and tedious, he will make it sweet and pleasant, and if there be any
defects and wants in us, he will supply them by virtue of that communion which
we have with him. If we be dead, Romans 6. 4.
and cannot move in the actions of piety and righteousness, by touching his
dead body, he will give us spiritual life and motion. For as the Father
rayseth up the dead and quickneth them; even so the Son Joh. 5. 21, 25.
quickneth whom he will. He is the Resurrection and the Life; he that believes
Ioh. 11. 25.
in him, though he were dead, yet shall he live. So if being raised, we want
spiritual illumination, that we may walk in those ways which God has
prescribed, our Savior will supply it, according to that of the Apostle;
Awake, thou that sleep, and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give
thee light. If we be weak and feeble, he will strengthen us with might Ephesians. 5.
14.
by his Spirit in the inner man. If we feel the exercises of a godly life so
Ephesians. 3. 16.
difficult and unpleasant to our corrupt nature, that we have little hope of
proceeding in them, that which is defective through natural corruption, he will
supply by grace above all that we can expect; for he is able to do exceeding
abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power Verse. 20.
that works in us. If we be faint, he will support us; if weary, he will
refresh us; if we fall, he will lift us up. If we be discomforted and
discouraged with afflictions and tribulations which we meet with in the way, he
will strengthen us with faith and patience, that we may be able to bear them;
so as we may say with the Apostle; We are troubled on every side, 2. Cor. 4. 8,
9.
yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not
forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.

. Sect. 4 That the duties of a godly life are made easy by the assistance of
the holy Spirit.
Finally, the holy Spirit so assisteth us with his grace, that the duties of a
godly life, which are to the flesh difficult and unpleasant, become Romans 8. 11.
sweet and easy. For when we feel our selves most dull and dead, and utterly
unable to move in the ways of godliness; this Spirit of life and power will
quicken and revive us; according to that of the Apostle; If the Spirit of him
that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you; he that raised up Christ from
the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwells
in you. If our flesh rebel and labor to hinder us in all good duties, the
Spirit of God will mortify and subdue it. If carnal corruption be so strong
in us, that it withdraws our hearts and affections from God and his service;
This Spirit of God as a sharp razour will circumcise our hearts, and purging
us from our natural Deuteronomy. 30. 6.
corruption, will inflame them with Gods love, and with fervent desires to
please him in all things. If we be so straightned in our zeal and devotion,
that we can neither read, hear, nor pray, yet our comfort is, that the Spirit
of God is not straightned, but can like fire thaw our Mic. 2. 7.
frozen hearts, open our ears and hearts, that we shall be able with Lydia to
attend unto those things which concern our salvation, and helping Luke 16. 14.
our infirmities, will make intercession for us with gronings which cannot be
Romans 8. 26.
uttered. If we be destitute of all saving graces in our own sense and
feeling, and do thirst after them like the dry lands, Gods Spirit will quench
our thirst, and be in us as a fountain of living water springing up Ioh. 4. 14.
into everlasting life. Finally, if we be stiff and inactive unto every good
work, so as we cannot perform any duty of Gods service, or if we do, yet
with much difficulty, and with murmuring and complaining of the flesh; this
oil and holy unction of the Spirit will supple and soften our hearts and
stiff joints, making us to go with ease and agility in the ways of
godliness, like the wheels of a cart, which being dry, go hardly and with a
creaking noise, but when they are oyled, run with much ease and swiftness.
And therefore when we find our selves indisposed to Gods service, prayer or
any other duty, and see some difficulty in them to our sinful flesh; let us
not hereby be discouraged, but feeling our own weakness, let us crave the
help and assistance of this holy Spirit, that we may be strengthened Ephesians. 3.
16.
thereby in the inner man, with all might, according to his glorious power, and
so Col. 1. 10, 11.
walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good
work. Let us go boldly unto the Throne of grace, craving the Spirit to
support us, seeing we have Gods promise that he will give it to those that ask
him. Let us beg the Spirit of Grace and supplication, seeing the Luke 11. 13.
Zach. 12. 10.
Lord has promised to bestow it upon all the faithful; and finding our selves
so dry and empty of all goodness, that we thirst after Gods grace which
inricheth us with it; let us by faith go unto Christ, inuiting us to come unto
him, and to drink plentifully of these waters Ioh. 7. 37, 38.
of the Spirit, that we may be nourished thereby unto everlasting life.

. Sect. 5 That the saving graces of the Spirit wrought in us, make the godly
life easy and familiar.
And as the Spirit it self, so the gifts and graces which it brings with it,
and works in us, are notable helps enabling us to overcome all difficulties
which we find in the way: As first, a true and lively Faith, which not only
overcomes the world and all the enemies of our salvation, and uniting us unto
Christ, does cause us to bring forth fruits in him, but also persuades and
assures us, that notwithstanding all lets and difficulties, we shall attain
unto that sanctification and holiness of life which we labor after. The which
as a singular encouragement hearteneth us to take pains, and to use all
diligence in all Christian duties, when as we are sure that we shall not lose
our labor, but shall receive the fruit and benefit of it in the end. Secondly,
a lively hope enableth us to overcome all difficulties, when as we do assuredly
expect, not only help and assistance from God, for the performing of those
duties, unto which in our selves we are altogether insufficient; but also do
wait for that bountiful wages and rich reward, which God has promised to all
those who serve and please him; namely, all the testimonies of his love and
favor in this life, and that eternal crown of glory and happiness, which he
reserueth for us in the life to come. For this is that helmet 1. These. 5. 8.
of salvation, which defends us against al incounters of our spiritual Heb.
6. 18.
enemies; this is that sure anchor-hold which keeps us immovable in all the
tempestuous storms of tentations, and from making shipwreck of our souls
against the rocks of despair. Neither is it possible, that we should be tired
with any labor, or danted and dismayed with any difficulty or danger, if we
have an eye to the recompense of reward, and expect after our short and small
labors, such an inestimable and everlasting Heb. 11. 25, 26.
weight of glory. Thirdly, fervent charity enableth us to overcome all
difficulties. For love makes every burden light, and if our necks be anointed
with this oil, the yoke of Christ will seem easy and sweet. For as Augustine
says, The labors of lovers are not burdensome, Lib. de Sancta viduitate.
but bring rather delight, as we see in the example of those who love those
painful sports of hunting, hawking, fishing and such like, seeing the pains
which are taken about the things we love, are either counted no labor, or else
the labor is loved and brings no tediousnes. In which regard, love is
compared to the peyzes of a clock, which sets all the wheels a-going. Or to
the wheels of a chariot, which make it easily drawn, and to go with much ease,
which otherwise are hardly to be moved. True love (says one) is of great
force. And he that is loved in an Grandem vim obtinet vera dilectio, etc. Hier.
ad Celantiam.
high degree, challenges unto himself the whole will and heart of him that
loves him. Nothing so imperiously commands as charity. And if we truly love
Christ, remembering that he has redeemd with his blood, we shall then know,
that we can then neither will nor do any other thing, then that which he
wills and commands; according to that, He who loves me, keeps my
commandments. He that loves, says August. John. 14. 15. Confess. lib. 11.
laboreth not; and it is only love which blusheth at the name of difficulty.
So the Apostle, Charity bears all things, believes all things, hops 1.
Cor. 13. 7.
all things, endures all things. An example whereof we have in David, who
because he loved Gods Commandments, therefore they Psalm. 119. 47.
were not tedious unto him, but sweet and pleasant. Fourthly, ardent zeal and
fervent devotion, will arm us greatly against all difficulties. For this
serves to the soul, as the spirits to the body, making it, which in it self
is heavy and lumpish, quick and vigorous, active, and never wearied in
well-doing. And whereas sloth, coldness and averseness of will does make things
easy, hard and difficult, a huge mountain of every little molehill, and every
straw a great block; contrariwise the heat of fervent zeal and devotion,
causes us to contemn and scorn all oppositions, and makes our greatest
labors in the service of God, light and delightful. Fifthly, the inward peace
of conscience and joy in the holy Ghost, which follows our justification by
faith, and reconciliation with God, is a notable help enabling us to overcome
all difficulties. For the mind and conscience being inwardly quiet, are
nothing or but little troubled with outward storms, but go on quietly in all
holy duties acceptable to God, without any disturbance, even in the midst of
worldly garboiles and tumultuous troubles. And whereas the wicked which want
this peace, are never at quiet in the greatest calm of worldly prosperity,
being like unto a troubled sea, which cannot rest, whose Esa. 57. 20, 21.
waters cast up mire and dirt; those who have this inward peace, are quiet in
the greatest storms of trouble, and rejoice not only in temporal blessings,
but even in their tribulations and persecutions for righteousness sake. Romans 5.
3. Math. 5. 11.


. Sect. 6 That Christian fortitude overcomes all difficulties, and makes a
godly life easy.
Sixthly, Christian fortitude and magnanimous resolution will exceedingly help
us to overcome all oppositions, the which is not to be grounded upon our own
strength, nor upon the virtues and graces which are inherent in us, but upon
the power and promises of almighty God, the mediation and intercession of Jesus
Christ, and our union and communion with him, and finally upon the help and
assistance of the holy Spirit, which in our greatest weakness are
allsufficient to strengthen us against al impedime^ts that hinder us in
Christian duties. For if we be armed with this fortitude and Christian courage,
we shall be the better able to withstand the tentations of Satan and the world,
and subdue our own corrupt lusts and violent passions, which will not easily be
mastred and overcome, if we weakly and fearfully set upon them. For as
Nettles lightly and gently touched, retain their venom and vigor, and sting
the hand, but hurt not at all, if we roughly graspe and gripe them in fast
hold; And as the fire, if we resolutely rush upon it and trample it under
foot, is easily extinguished, but if it be gently handled, burns that which
touches it; and if there be plenty of combustible matter, increases to a
great flame: so our corrupt flesh and tumultuous passions, if they be handled
gently, and (as it were) with a fearful touch, will but the more sting and
burn us, but if they be assaulted with undaunted courage, and nought-dreading
valor, they will soon be subdued, and give us the comfort of an easy
victory. Besides, howsoever we have many helps from God, and sweet comforts
of his Spirit, which may sufficiently encourage us in our Christian courses,
against all oppositions, yet it cannot be denied, but that we shall meet with
so many difficulties, in respect of the corruption of our nature, and
encounters of our spiritual enemies, that we had great need of courage and
resolution for the ouercomming of them. The palace of virtue is not seated upon
the plain, but upon a rock and steep hill, which we cannot mount without
some pains, nor continue this pains without resolved courage. We must
travail, like painful pilgrims, before we can take our rest in our own
country. We must laboriously work, before we can receive our wages, mourn
and weep, before we can laugh and rejoice, bedewing our cheeks with tears,
before we can have them clean wiped away; and both fight and Apoc. 2. 10.
overcome our spiritual enemies, before we can obtain full victory, or
triumph in glory. All which, as on the one side they must not daunt and dismay
us, because our joys exceed our grief; our comforts, our crosses; and they
which are on our part, those that are against us: so on the other side, they
should keep us, when we enter into the course of Christianity, from dreaming
of ease, or pleasing our selves with a vain conceit, that we shall find
pleasures without pains, and undertake such a work as is so easy, that we may
go about it between sleeping and waking, and easily overcome it, though we be
never so negligent: And contrariwise make it appear how necessary it is, that
before we go about this building, we cast up our accounts, and when we have
resolved upon it, that we arm our selves with courage and fortitude, that
ouerco^ming all difficulties and oppositions, we may be able to perfect and
finish it.

. Sect. 7 Of the means whereby we may attain unto Christian fortitude.
Now the means of attaining unto this Christian fortitude, whereby we are made
ready to do whatsoever God commands, and to suffer whatsoever he imposes,
are first to consider what our Savior Christ has done and suffered for our
sakes; what poverty and contempt, shame and disgrace, slanders and reuilings,
blindfolding and buffeting, scourging and crucifying; what inward sorrows and
bitter agonies in the sight and sense of Gods wrath due unto our sins, he
has meekely and patiently endured for us. And this argument the Apostle Peter
uses to strengthen our resolution against all difficulties: For as much then
as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm your 1. Pet. 4. 1.
selves likewise with the same mind: seeing as Apostle speaks, He therefore
endured these things, lest we should be weary and faint in our minds. Heb.
12. 3.
And then also let us think with our selves, who it was that suffered all
this, namely, Jesus Christ the innocent and righteous, who never sinned, and in
whose mouth there was no guile; the glorious and eternal Son of God, equal
unto his Father in might and Majesty: And for whom he suffered all these great
evils, even for us and for our sins, which were strangers and enemies unto
him, dead in our sins, and the children of wrath as well as others; and the
motives and manner of these sufferings, not upon our entreaty, and much less
desert, not by any compulsion or constraint, but upon his own accord, and out
of his mere grace and good will, meekly, and cheerfully. To consider likewise
what our Savior has done for us, namely, forgiven the infinite debt of our
sins, overcome all the enemies of our salvation, reconciled us unto God,
united us unto himself, whereby we have communion with him in all his
benefits, imparted unto us some portion of his saving graces, and innumerable
pledges of his love and favor, which are also earnest-pennies of our
salvation. For who can thoroughly ponder these things, and not be thereby armed
with a magnanimous resolution of doing and suffering any thing for Christ's
sake? For did our Lord and Master suffer all this for us; and shall we not be
ready and willing to suffer much lesser things for him? Shall our Captain and
General lie in the field, and endure much hardness, and many sharp and
dangerous conflicts; and shall we take our ease at home, and solace our selves
in worldly delights? Did he endure many afflictions, and grievous persecutions
for our sakes, that he might purchase for us everlasting life and happiness,
and himself lead us the way under his Cross; and will we dream of going to
that place of joy, without pain or difficulty, as it were lying in an
Horse-litter, and sleeping in a bed of Down? Was his love toward us so great
and inestimable, that nothing could hinder him from emptying himself of glory
and coming to us, that he might work that great work of our Redemption; and
shall we not be willing and resolute to go unto him, through thick and thin,
fire and water, evil report, and good report, affliction and persecution, that
he may make us partakers of his glory, and crown us with his happiness? Could
no difficulty daunt and discourage him from showing the infiniteness of his
love, in doing all things necessary for our salvation; and shall we think any
task too hard to be undertaken, which may express our love, our desire to
glorify him, and care to please him? Secondly, we may strengthen our selves in
this magnanimous fortitude and resolution, by observing the courage and
constancy of Gods Saints and servants of former ages, and in our own times,
whom no difficulties could discourage, either from doing that which God
requires, or suffering that which he inflicteth. Of both which, we have for
our imitation, the examples of the Patriarchs, Enoch, Noah, Lot, Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Job, David and the rest, of the Prophets and holy men of God, the
Apostles of Jesus Christ, and the devout and godly Martyrs which succeeded
them, who were not only content to spend their sweat and labor in Gods
service, but were also prodigal of their blood, and patiently endured the most
cruel and exquisite torments which wit and maljce could devise, rather then
they would leave their holy profession and practice of Gods truth. And
therefore if these Saints, of the same nature with us, and bearing about with
them the like infirmities, did, upon the same grounds which we likewise have
in common with them, courageously withstand all oppositions, and valiantly rush
through all difficulties which stood in their way, and hindered them from
following their Lord and Master Jesus Christ; why should every small danger
daunt us, and a little labor and short pains dismay and discourage us from
going on in the duties of a godly life? If they thought it too little to
express their love toward their Savior, to endure with patience and joy,
death it self, and exquisite torments; shall we think it too much to take a
little pains in mortifying our sinful flesh, and the lusts thereof? Were they
content to suffer the rendings and tearings of wild beasts, rackes, gibbets,
fire and sword; and will not we, to show our love to God and his Christ, our
blessed Savior, who has done and suffered so much for us, take a little
pains in the duties of a godly life; as fasting, praying, watching, and the
rest, that we may glorify them by our holy conversation? Finally, if we would
attain unto this magnanimous fortitude, which easily overcomes all
difficulties, we must continually have in our eye the eternal recompense of
reward, according to the example of our Savior Christ, the Author and
finisher of our faith, who for the joy Heb. 12. 2.
that was set before him, endured the Cross, and despised the shame. For if
hope of a little gain make Merchants so resolute and valiant, that they dare
expose themselves to the dangers both of sea and land: if soldiers are so full
of courage and fortitude, that they dare rush into all desperate perils, and
fight at the push of pike, yea even at the Canons mouth, for a little pay or
booty, or for the applause of their Captain and fellow soldiers, or vain
fame and momentany glory in the world; what difficulty should be so great, that
should be able to discourage us from resolving to lead a godly life, which
shall be rewarded with the infinite and everlasting riches, and inestimable
glory and happiness of Gods Kingdom?

. Sect. 8 That by daily and constant practice we may easily overcome all
difficulties.
The last means whereby we may be enabled to overcome all difficulties, is the
daily and constant practice of all Christian duties; seeing howsoever they may
seem at the first, harsh and unpleasant to our corrupt nature, yet continual
use will make them easy and familiar, and bring us at length to such a custom
and settled habit, that we shall perform them with much comfort and delight.
For as the mind is more and more darkened by the often acts of sin, and so
loses the light of truth, that no saving knowledge remains in it, but
malignity only and pollution; so by the many and often acts of piety and
righteousness, the mind is more enlightened, and aspireth unto a greater
measure of true wisdom, this righteousness and holiness offering themselves
as clear glasses, unto the eyes of the understanding, as Chrysostom has well
observed. Besides, Sicut enim qui peccat, dum peccat, magis atque magis
tenebrescit men's eius, etc. Chrysostom. in Mat. 7. Hom. 18 Psalm. 19. 10.
the more often that we perform these Christian and religious duties, and the
longer and more constantly that we continue in them, the more we shall relish
and taste their sweetness; so that though at first they seemed to our carnal
appetite as bitter and unpleasant, as the infusion of gall or wormwood, yet
continual use and daily practice, will make them sweeter to our mouths then
the honey and honey comb, as we see in David's example; by reason that we
shall find in our own good experience, the manifold comforts which accompany
the diligent performance of these Christian duties; as peace with God, and the
beams of his love and favor shed abroad in our hearts, and shining upon us,
the peace of a good conscience, and inward joy of the holy Ghost, sweet
communion with God, access and increase of all spiritual graces, contentation
in all estates, and assurance of our salvation, and that in the mean time, all
things whatsoever, and even afflictions themselves, shall turn to our good.
These, and many such like benefits, accompanying our constant walking in the
ways of godliness, will make them not only easy, but sweet and delightful.
And whereas at first we came to the performing of Christian duties, as a Bear
to the stake, and found nothing in them, but vexation and irksome weariness;
by use and custom coming to know and relish their profit and excellency, we
find such spiritual sweetness, that it is our meat and drink to be
exercised in them. So that now we esteem Gods Sabbaths our delight; hear,
read, pray, meditate, confer, and do the works of mercy with much joy and
cheerfulness. Now the means to attain unto this daily and constant practice,
which takes away all difficulty and distaste, is to inure our selves thereunto
by degrees, and with a firm resolution, to break off all excuses, and set
apart some short time, as a day, week, or month, for the strict leading of a
godly life, in the performance of all Christian duties, as they have bin before
set down. Which when we have done, let us look back and examine our selves,
if we can in our consciences find any cause of repenting this course, in
leaving worldly and wicked delights and the pleasures of sin, and betaking
and consecrating our selves to serve God in the duties of holiness and
righteousness: yea, if we do not find in this short time, more sound comfort
and true joy, then in many years before, when we neglected them.

. Sect. 9 That worldlings take more pains about earthly vanities, and in the
service of sin and Satan, then is required to a godly life.
Now if any, notwithstanding of all these helps and comforts, still complain
of the difficulties which he finds in the course of Christianity, Pro. 26. 13.
and use it as an excuse for his neglect of all the duties of a godly life; let
such a man know, that the fault is not in the hardness and crookednes of the
way, but in his own negligence, who will not use the means which God offers
unto him for the ouercomming of these difficulties, and neither take any pains
to be truly informed, nor to travel in it after he knows it. For because
they are lazy, and have no list to work; therefore they sit in the house and
complain, that there is a Lion in the way, a Lion in the streets. Because they
would sit still by the fleshpots of Egypt, and glut themselves with carnal
pleasures, therefore they cavil against their entering into, and proceeding in
that way which leads to the holy Land, as though the difficulties were so
many and great which affront us in it, that it is vnpassible and impossible to
be traveled by them. Their affections are so strong, that they cannot master
and mortify them; their bodies tender and delicate, and not inured to take
that pains which is required to the well performing of Christian duties, and
their natures are so easy and flexible, that they cannot withstand the
allurements and importunity of their old companions, drawing and persuading
them to accompany them in their sinful courses. All which excuses, what do
they argue but their sloth and negligence; yea rather, their want of love, and
contempt of spiritual grace and heavenly glory? Seeing the same men who
pretend these difficulties, are ready to undertake far greater pains, for
the obtaining of those worldly vanities, whereupon they have fixed their hearts
(and even delight themselves in these toylesome labors) then is required for
the attaining of heavenly happiness; and go willingly through many more and
greater difficulties in those ways that lead to hell and destruction, then
they should ever find in the way that would bring them to life and salvation?
For first, consider the pains which worldly men are content to endure for the
compassing of honors, riches and pleasures, how they carke and care, toil and
moyle, watch and labor, travel by sea and land, and run into many desperate
dangers, for the getting of these worthless vanities, which are alike
uncertain in the possession, as in the pursuit and acquisition. How they tire
their thoughts in the restless night, about plots and policies, for the
preventing or circumuenting one another. How their hearts are continually upon
the rack of their own passions, being diversely distracted between hopes and
fears; false joys, and true griefs; love, and dislike; longing desires, and
lothing auersation. Consider also what pains and care they take about their
frail and mortal bodies, and for the preserving of their flitting and fading
health and strength, and the prolonging of their uncertain and momentany life.
What pains they take in tricking and trimming, decking and adorning, clothing
and beautifying, nourishing and feeding, pampering and pleasing, physicking and
dyeting their corruptible carcases, though they are assured, that by all their
care and cost they can but for a short time adiourne diseases and infirmities,
and for a small and uncertain while procure a repriuall from approaching death.
Finally, consider that there is much more toil and difficulty in the ways of
vice and sin, then in the way of virtue and godliness, although carnal love
so sweeteneth it to a corrupt appetite, that it is either not discerned, or not
much abhorred. For example, what rackes and torments are in covetousness and
ambition, and what comfort and sweetness in contentation, and submission of
our estates to the will of God? What pangs and pulls of an evil conscience
accompany vice and sin, and what peace and quietness, joy and delight have
we in the conscience of our innocence and well-doing? Unto what storms and
tempests does pride expose us, from all which we are secured by lowliness and
humility? What vexation and grief is there in malice, envy, anger, and desire
of revenge; and what joy and sweet delight to be found in brotherly love,
rejoicing in one another good, peaceablenesse, passing by and pardoning of
offenses, and making friends of enemies, by our kind usage and sweet
conversation? What trouble and discontent in discord, contention and wrangling
suits of Law; and what sweetness and contentment in amity, friendship, mutual
agreement, and even in departing from some part of our right, that we may
thereby purchase Jewels of far greater price, peace and love? Finally, what
anxiety and vexation is there in carking care about worldly things, and what
joy and pleasure in the life of faith, whereby we securely rely upon Gods
promises and providence, and go boldly unto him, as unto our gracious Father,
when we are in any want, with confidence that it shall be supplied in that
manner and measure, as will best stand with his glory and our own good. In all
which respects, and innumerable others, as wicked worldlings, after all their
labors about worldly vanities, and the vain and unfruitful works of
darkness, have just cause to complain with those in the Book of Wisdom;
We have wearied our selves in the way of wickedness and destruction, yea, we
Wisd. 5. 7, 8.
have gone through deserts, where there lay no way; but as for the way of the
Lord, we have not known it; what has pride profited us? or what good has
riches with our vaunting brought us? All these things are passed away as a
shadow, and as a Poast that hasted by: So on the other side, the faithful,
who have spent their time and strength in the duties of a godly life, have just
cause to comfort themselves in their happy choice, when leaving the world, and
the pleasures of sin, and embracing the love and fear of God, they have
devoted themselves wholly to Gods service, seeing they may with Augustine
rejoice in God and praise him, saying, Let my heart praise thee, and let my
tongue and all my bones say, O Lord, who is like unto thee, etc? Confess. l. 9.
c. 1.
How sweet and pleasant is it now become, to want the sweetness of worldly
vanities? That which I feared to lose, what joy is it to have lost? For thou, O
most true and supreme sweetness, did cast them out of me; thou did cast
them out, and did enter in their stead, who art sweeter then pleasure, but
not to flesh and blood; cleerer and brighter then all light, but to the inner
man only; and then all honor, much more high and honorable, but not to those
who are exalted in themselves. Now was my mind free from the biting and eating
cares of ambition, covetousness, voluptuousness, and from scratching the
itching scab of lust, and did freely talk with thee, my beauty, riches,
salvation, and my Lord and God. And after a painful warfare, they may with
the Apostle make that comfortable conclusion, when death approaches; I have
fought a good fight, I have finished 2. Tim. 4. 8.
my course, I have kept the faith; Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown
of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give unto me at
that day. And therefore let not those seeming difficulties any longer
discourage us from resolving to serve God in the duties of a godly life, seeing
thereby we shun and escape much greater difficulties in the ways of sin, then
we shall ever find in the way of a Christian and holy conversation.

CAP. XV.
That a godly life is not harsh and unpleasant, mopish and melancholic, but
above all others, most cheerful and pleasant, sweet and delightful.

. Sect. 1 That though a godly life were sad and sorrowful, yet this should not
discourage from it.
A Third objection which the flesh makes against a godly life, to discourage
and hinder us from entering into, or proceeding in it, is, that it is harsh and
unpleasant, mopish and melancholic, depriving us of all joy and delight, which
is the very life of our life, and which being taken from us, it becomes
irksome and tedious. The which objection of the flesh, the devil and the
world labor all they may, with their utmost policy and skill, to confirm and
strengthen; and knowing that men naturally are affected with nothing more then
with pleasure and joy, and do shun above all things sorrow and sadness,
they use all their Art to blind and delude us; by offering to our view all the
pleasures of carnal and corrupt courses, and hiding from us the griefs and
mischiefs which always attend upon them, and like a bitter tang or loathsome
after-taste, do utterly spoil these sinful and fleshly delicacies. And
contrariwise, they offer to our consideration all the sorrow and smart, losses
and worldly inconveniences, which they must undergo who resolve to please God,
in the strict and constant performance of the duties belonging to a godly life,
concealing in the mean while the manifold comforts which do accompany them,
and the inestimable joys, and everlasting happiness, unto which they attain
that continue in them unto the end. For the answering of which objection, we
are first to know, that though there were as much sadness, and as little joy
for the present time in the godly life, as is pretended by our spiritual
enemies, yet this should not discourage us from choosing and embracing it;
seeing both the pleasures and pains, solace and sorrows of this life are but
short and momentany, whereas both the joys and griefs which shall immediately
succeed them, are endless and everlasting. In which regard, we are to account
that mirth miserable, which ends in perpetual mourning, and that sorrow and
sadness sweet and comfortable, which is attended with eternal and heavenly
joys. So our Savior, Blessed are they that mourn, Mat. 5. 4.
for they shall be comforted. And again; Blessed are ye that weep now, for
Luke 6. 21, 25.
ye shall laugh; and woe unto you that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and
weep. Now if we worthily abhor unwholesome meats and drinks, though they
be never so sweet and pleasant to our taste, because we lose that delight which
we take in them, by the bitter pains of sickness, indangering our lives,
which soon after follows it; and if we love that wholesome, though bitter
medicine, which freeth us from tedious sickness, and preserves our health:
why should we not be alike wise in spiritual things, which concern our
souls, hating those carnal and sinful pleasures, which endanger them to
sickness and everlasting death, and loving those Christian and holy duties,
though they be bitter and unpleasant to our fleshly and corrupt appetite,
which preserve our spiritual health, and certainly assure us of eternal life
and happiness? Neither are the religious exercises of a godly life harsh and
unpleasant, either in their own nature, or to us in the spiritual part, and
so far forth as we are regenerate and sanctified: yea, rather they are of
incomparable sweetness, above the honey and honey comb, and affect us in the
inner man with unspeakable joy and delight, as we see in the example of David,
the Apostle Paul, Psalm. 19. 9, 10. Romans 7. 22. Ioh. 4. 34.
and our Savior Christ himself: but to our carnal appetite and sinful
flesh, which (like a sick and aguish stomach, full of corrupt and noisome
humors) does bring our palate quite out of taste, judging those spiritual
duties which are sweet and pleasant, bitter and loathsome, and our sinful vices
and works of darkness, that are sour and harsh to a right judging taste,
delightful and well-rellishing. And therefore, seeing we are not (as the
Apostle speaks) debtors unto the flesh, that we Romans 8. 12.
should fulfill the lusts thereof, let not this distaste which it feels in
religious exercises withdraw us from them, or discourage us in them; yea, let
us so much the rather be diligent and constant in these duties, that we may
mortify this carnal concupiscence, that fights against our souls, and 1.
Pet. 2. 11.
by displeasing it, please our God and our own consciences, and nourish and
preserve our spiritual life and health.

. Sect. 2 That sanctification takes not away our joy and delight, but only
changes and improueth it.
But this objection which the flesh makes against the leading of a godly life,
it further presses and confirms by the experience which we may have in
others, and the examples of many Christians, who spend a great part of their
time in sighing and sorrowing, mourning and lamenting, as though they were
deprived of all inward joy, and outward pleasures, and do live in such a
melancholic and mopish manner, as though they thought all delights unlawful,
being ready to condemn themselves, and censure others, if they laugh or smile,
or show any other signs of gladness and rejoicing, as not sauouring of
sanctification, and the mortification of our fleshly lusts; not beseeming the
season, which is a time of mourning, nor befitting the place, which is a valley
of tears, nor yet well suting with the example of our Savior Christ, of whom
it is written, that he mourned and wept, but never any thing said of his mirth
and laughter. For the answering whereof, we are first to know, that
sanctification and mortification do not annihilate or change the essence and
being of nature, or the substance of our faculties, passions, and affections,
but only renueth and purges them from their corruption, that becoming holy,
they may be serviceable to God, and the spiritual and inner man. It does not
abolish and take them away, but moderateth them in their degree, and keeps
them from extremity and excess, when as they are exercised about worldly
things; and both rectifieth their disorder, and corrects their viciosity and
faultiness. And finally, it causes our passions and affections to change
their objects, making us to bewail our sins, in which formerly we rejoiced,
and to rejoice in those spiritual exercises, which in the days of our
ignorance we loathed and neglected. It takes away the lightness, vanity, and
madness of mirth, and causes it to become more grave and sober: It changes
our rejoicing in evil, for rejoicing in that which is good: It moderateth the
excess of our earthly joy, which is more in the creature, then in the
Creator: It makes us to rejoice but a little, in things that are but a little
worth, and to abound, and even triumph with joy in things of greatest
excellency, as the assurance of Gods love and our own salvation, and the
manifold and undoubted testimonies of his grace and favor toward us. And if
Christians do not find in them this change of joy, from worse to better, from
carnal to spiritual, from that which is vain and worthless, unto that,
which (as the Apostle Peter calls it) is unspeakable and glorious; 1. Pet. 1.
8.
it is their own fault, and not of their Christian profession. Neither in truth
can the carriage of diverse Christians be in this regard excused, who as though
they thought joy and a godly life incompetible, and not to be reconciled or
conjoined, or supposed that when they did forsake the world, their sins, and
carnal pleasures, they were presently bound to part with mirth and gladness,
joy and delight, do purposely affect a sad countenance and carriage, a demure
and dejected look, inwardly sighing and groaning upon every slight occasion,
drooping and hanging down the head, as though all joy were in the pleasures of
sin which they have forsaken, and no cause at all of rejoicing in their
present estate. Whereby they not only make their own lives tedious and
wearisome, and so ouer-strait and strict, unpleasant and uncomfortable, that
being tired with it, they are not able to hold out, but change this rigourous
severity for licencious liberty; or else go forward without life and spirit,
courage or comfort: but also by their example discourage others that are
without, from taking upon them the profession of Christianity, or resolving to
lead a godly life, as fearing that it is so austere and destitute of all joy
and delight, that it is altogether intolerable and not to be endured. Whereas
contrariwise, if as they have greater cause, they could also perceive, that
they have above all other the greatest, most solid, and lasting joy, it would
be a notable inducement to move them to take upon them their holy profession,
and to resolve that they will follow and join with them in the practice of
those duties, in which they discern such pleasure and comfort.

. Sect. 3 That no joy of worldlings is comparable to that which is in
Christians.
But that those who affect such melancholic heaviness, and purposely banish
both out of their hearts and countenances all joy and mirth, may be reclaimed
from going on still in this erroneous and tedious course, and that others may
not be discouraged by their example, from resolving to lead a godly life; let
us know, that there is no joy comparable unto that which is, or ought to be in
Christians, that desire to serve and please God in their holy conversation. For
if, as Bernard has Oblatus siquidem Isaac; sanctificatus est, non mactatus.
Non Isaac, sed aries morietur, non peribit tibi laetitia, sed contumacia, etc.
Bernard. sermo de verbis Petri, Ecce, nos reliquimus omnia:
excellently observed, we can be content with Abraham, in faith and obedience
toward God, to offer and sacrifice our Isaac: First, our laughter and joy, it
shall only be sanctified, but not slaughtred and killed. Thy Isaac shall not
die, nor thy mirth perish, but the Ram only, that is, the perverseness and
profaneness of thy pleasure and joy, which ends always in grief and
anxiety. Isaac thy joy shall not die, as thou supposest, but shall surely live;
only it shall be lifted aloft upon the Altar and upon the wood, that thy joy
may be holy and heavenly, sublime and lofty, not in the flesh and things
beneath, but in spiritual things, in the cross of Christ, and those high and
holy privileges which we have through him. For howsoever Christians in their
first conversion and humiliation, chiefly act the part of sorrow and heaviness
in the sight and sense of their manifold and heinous sins, and shead tears
of bitter grief, looking upon him whom they have pierced, yet being Zach. 12.
10. Romans 5. 1, 3.
justified by faith, and having peace with God, in assurance of his mercy, and
remission of their sins, they triumph with joy, even in their afflictions and
tribulations, and though they sow in tears, yet they reap in joy; though they
have a dropping and sorrowful seed-time, yet their harvest, which yields
unto them a fruitful crop of saving graces, (which yet are but the first
fruits of their succeeding joy and heavenly happiness) is full of mirth and
gladness. So that with David they rejoice Psalm. 4. 7.
more in the bright beams of Gods gracious countenance shining upon them, then
worldlings do or can do, when their corn and wine is increased. And though
they be, in respect of their afflicted estate, As sorrowful, yet they are
always rejoicing (as the Apostle speaks) because 2. Cor. 6. 10.
they know that all things, even crosses and calamities themselves work
together for their good. The which will more manifestly appear, if we a little
further consider the testimonies and examples of holy Scripture. For the
Psalmist tells us, that the voice of rejoicing and Psalm. 118. 15.
salvation is in the Tabernacles of the righteous; And Solomon speaking of
Wisdom, which consists in the saving knowledge of God and his truth, and the
practice of it in all holy and religious duties, says that her ways, are
ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. So David says Pro. 3. 17.
of the Church and children of God, the lively members of it, That Psalm. 36. 8.
they should be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of his house, and that
he would make them drink of the rivers of his pleasure. Our Savior also
promises unto the Disciples, and in them to all the faithful, that he Job.
16. 22.
would give them such a permanent joy, as no man should be able to take it from
them. And finally, the Apostle sets it down, not as a common gift, but as a
special fruit of the Spirit (not drooping sorrow, and disconsolate heaviness,
but) joy and peace. And this also appears Gal. 5. 22.
by the examples of the holy men of God recorded in the Scriptures: Thus David
says; My soul shall be joyful in the Lord, it shall rejoice Psalm. 35. 9.
in his salvation. Neither did he only thus rejoice in the testimonies of Gods
favor, and conquest of his enemies, but also in his obedience and keeping of
Gods Law: I have rejoiced in the way of thy Psalm. 119. 14, 16.
testimonies as much as in all riches. I will delight my self in thy Statutes:
I will not forget thy Word. And again; I delight to do thy will, O my God,
Psalm. 40. 8.
yea thy Law is within mine heart. Thus the Apostles rejoiced even in Act. 5.
41.
their persecutions, because they were thought worthy to suffer for Christ's
sake; and Paul and Silas, when as their backs were torn Act. 16.
with sore stripes, and their feet locked in the Stocks. Thus the Apostle
found matter enough to glory in through Jesus Christ, in things Romans 15. 17.
pertaining to God: And tasted such unspeakable joy in the knowledge of Christ
and him crucified, that he disclaymeth all other Gal. 6. 14.
joy. And elsewhere he professes, that he had no scant measure of this sweet
delight, but that he was filled with comfort, and was exceeding 2. Cor. 7. 4.
joyful, even in all his tribulations. Neither is this joy whereof I speak,
in which the Christian exceeds all other men, sensual and carnal, in the
pleasures of sin, and the fruition of earthly vanities, not in rioting and
reuelling, in swilling and drinking, dicing and carding, vain dalliance and
good fellowship, chambring and wantonness: for such Eccles. 2 1, 2.
pleasure he accounts vanity, and such mirth madness; and chooses rather to
go into the house of mourning, then into the house of such feasting and
rejoicing, because such joy and laughter is but short and momentany, like the
crackling of thorns under a pot, and always ends in Eccles. 7. 2, 6.
sorrow and anxiety. It is not in mad mirth, and in sinful and unlawful
delights: for Christian charity rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the
1. Cor. 13. 6.
truth; and this joy is always joined with righteousness, and the peace of a
Romans 14. 17.
good conscience, in which the Kingdom of God consists. For being subjects
of Christ's Kingdom, such as it is, such also is their joy; but his Kingdom is
not of this world, but spiritual and heavenly: and therefore their joy and
rejoicing is likewise of the same nature. And howsoever Gods children may and
ought to rejoice even in his temporary blessings, as they are testimonies of
their heavenly Fathers love, and also in honest sports and recreations, of
which I have before spoken, whereby they are fitted for higher duties, as
music, shooting, hunting, hawking, and such like, those cautions before set
down being duly observed; yea, howsoever in these respects they have greater
and more just cause of joy and rejoicing then any worldling, because these are
but usurpers, who have a fearful account to make of their intrusion, whereas
the other have their right restored unto them by Jesus Christ; yet, these are
not the chief joys which they rest upon, as being in comparison, dull and
heartlesse, cold and comfortless; only they use them for the necessity of
their body and natural life, as some small refreshings in their Inn, that
they may afterward with more strength and cheerfulness, proceed in their
journey. But the prime and principal joys which ravish their souls with
inward delight, are secret and unknown to all, saving those who have tasted of
them. So that they may say to worldlings of their joys, when they object unto
them their sadness and want of mirth, as our Savior of his meat, We have
joys which you know not of, seeing our joy is to do the will of our heavenly
Father. For it is that hidden Manna which our Savior gives them to eat, and
like Ioh. 4. 34. Apoc. 2. 17.
that new name written in the white stone, which no man knows, saving he that
receives it. It is a beauty which cannot be beheld with carnal eyes, and a
sweetness which is not rellished by a common and profane taste, seeing it is
of an holy and spiritual nature: so that when Christians are so afflicted in
their outward estate, that they seem unto natural men to have no cause at all
of rejoicing, they may notwithstanding say with the Apostle, We have whereof we
may glory through Jesus Christ, in those things Romans 15. 17.
which pertain to God.

. Sect. 4 Of the diverse objects of our spiritual joy.
Now the objects of this Spiritual joy are diverse, the chief and principal is
God himself, his Christ and holy Spirit, for he being the summum bonum, the
supreme joy and chief blessedness, the fruition of him and his grace, and the
bright beams of his face and favor shining upon us, must needs be the matter
and cause of supreme and unspeakable joy. And this is that joy, and rejoicing
in the Lord, which is in the Scriptures not only permitted to the faithful,
and restrained unto them alone as their peculiar and proper right, but enjoined
and required as being a duty which we owe unto God, the performance whereof
makes them happy and blessed. Let not (says the Lord) the wise man glory in
his wisdom, Ier. 9. 24.
nor the mighty man in his might, nor the rich man in his riches; But let him
that glories, glory in this, that he understands and knows me, etc. So the
Psalmist exhorts to this joy; Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous, for
praise is Psalm. 33. 1.
comely for the upright. Of which he propounds himself for an example; My
soul shall be joyful in the Lord, it shall rejoice in his salvation. And the
Psalm. 35. 9.
Apostle likewise; Let him that glories, glory in the Lord. And again; 2.
Cor. 10. 17. Phil. 4. 4.
Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice. In which himself took
such abundant comfort and contentment, that he rests in it alone, and
renounceth all other joys; God forbid that I should glory in any thing, saving
Gal 6. 14.
in the Cross of Jesus Christ; by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I
unto the world. And if we thus rejoice in the Lord, we shall not only be
blessed and happy in our work, but also in our wages and reward, which is
promised unto all those who make him their chiefest joy; according to that of
the Psalmist, Delight thy self in the Lord, and he shall give thee Psalm. 37. 4.
the desires of thine heart. So the Lord promises to the faithful, that they
should delight themselves in him, and he would cause them to ride Esa. 58. 14.
upon the high places of the earth, and feed them with the heritage of Jacob,
etc. And as the Faithful do thus rejoice in God himself, so also in his Word
and works. For when they find sweetness and comfort in the spiritual Manna
and food of their souls, then they feed upon it with joy and delight. So
David, I have rejoiced in the way of thy Testimonies, as much as in all riches.
Thy Testimonies are my delight Psalm. 119. 14, 24, 103, 111, 162.
and my counselors. Thy Testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever, for
they are the rejoicing of mine heart. How sweet are thy words unto my taste,
yea, sweeter then honey unto my mouth! I rejoice at thy Word, as one that
finds great spoil. So also they rejoice in Gods works of creation and
government, admiring Gods infinite wisdom, power and goodness that shines
in them: Especially in that great work of our Redemption by Jesus Christ, and
in the application thereof unto themselves, by the inward and effectual
working of Gods Word and holy Spirit. Thus also do they rejoice in the life of
faith, and in the fruits thereof, their sanctification and new obedience, and
in the testimony of a good conscience, according to that of the Apostle, Our
rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and 2.
Cor. 1. 12.
godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom; but by the grace of God, we have
had our conversation in the world. Yea, the faithful with holy and heavenly
minds do rejoice in earthly and temporary blessings, in their houses and
lands, wives and children, meats and drinks, pastimes and recreations. For to
this end God has given them; neither is there (as the Wise man speaks) in
them any other good, but for Eccles. 3. 12, 13.
a man to rejoice in their fruition, and to do good in his life; and that
every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labor, it is the
gift of God. And again; Behold that which I have seen. It is good and comely
for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his Eccles. 5. 18,
19.
labor that he takes under the Sun, all the days of his life which God
gives him; for it is his portion. Every man also to whom God has given riches
and wealth, and has given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
and to rejoice in his labor, this is the gift of God.

. Sect. 5 That the Christians chiefest joy is Spiritual, and wherein it
exceeds all other joys.
So that no lawful joy, either spiritual, or temporal, inward or outward, is
wanting unto the righteous who desire to please God. But yet their chief and
principal joy in which they exceed all others, is spiritual, in the
assurance of Gods love and their own salvation, and that both in respect of
the excellency, perpetuity and propriety of it. For first, it excels all
other joys, being of a spiritual and divine nature, and (as it were) a short
prelude to that heavenly and harmonious joy, of which we shall have the full
and everlasting fruition in the life to come. For so the Apostle teaches us,
that the Kingdom of God (that Romans 14. 17.
is, the first beginnings of it in this world) consists not in meats and
drinks, but in righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy Ghost; and they who
have here tasted these first beginnings of this heavenly joy, shall have the
perfect fruition of that fullness of joy, and of those eternal pleasures Psalm.
16. 11. Pro. 28. 12.
which are at Gods right hand for evermore. So that when righteous men rejoice,
there is great glory, (as the Wise man speaks) seeing their joy far
exceeds the joy of them who rejoice in their corn and wine, as being not
only much more excellent both in respect of Psalm. 4. 7.
the nature and object, but also an earnest-penny of a greater bargain, the
first beginnings and prime taste of those full rivers of divine pleasures,
whereof they shall drink their fill in Gods Kingdom; and the first fruits of
that heavenly and happy harvest of joy, which is reserved for them in the life
to come. And therefore no marvel, seeing this spiritual joy is above all
others most excellent, that David (when having wounded his conscience with
grievous sins, he was deprived of the sense and feeling of it for a time)
did so earnestly desire to have it again restored: Restore unto me Psalm. 36.
8. Psalm. 51. 12.
the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit: Seeing herein
he had much more contentment, sound comfort and delight, then in all the
earthly pleasures, which a Kingdom could yield unto him? For they all were but
slight and childish, this, solid and substantial; they, vain and worthless,
this, excellent and of incomparable value; they, short and fickle, momentany
and mutable, this, durable and permanent. And this is the second reason to
commend unto us this spiritual Joy, in that it is not like worldly joys,
only by fits and flashes, but settled and constant in all estates and
conditions, as well in adversity and affliction, as in prosperity and all
earthly abundance. For if our hearts be once replenished with this Joy, no
man shall be able to take it from us; and being of a spiritual Romans 5. 3.
John 16. 22.
and divine nature, no earthly thing can quell or quench it. No prison can
lock it from us, no banishment can divide and sever us, no losses and crosses,
confiscations of goods, Rackes or Gibbets, fire or sword, can take it away and
deprive us of it. For in all extremities we have an inward Comforter, even the
Spirit of God dwelling in us, which fills our hearts with joy, and turns
our mourning into mirth and gladness, and as our afflictions John 16. 7. 2.
Cor. 1. 5.
do abound, so also he causes our consolations to abound much more. We live
the life of faith, and not of sense, which looks not so much upon things
present, as unto our future hopes and certaineties, and hereby we apply unto
us Gods Word and gracious promises, which supplyeth comfort sufficient to
support us in all our sorrows. For it assures us, that those are blessed
which mourn now, because they shall be comforted, and which weep now, for
they shall laugh. Math. 5. 4. Luke ^. 21.
That all things, even afflictions themselves shall work together for the best,
and our momentany and light sufferings shall cause unto us a far most
excellent Romans 8 28. 2 Cor. 4. 17. Act. 14. 22. 2. Tim. 2. 12.
and eternal weight of glory, that by these many tribulations we shall enter
into the Kingdom of heaven: and if we suffer with Christ, we shall also
reign with him. And this was that Word of God applied by faith, which was
David's comfort in his afflictions, without which he should have perished.
Psalm. 119. 50, 92
This was it which made the Church of Macedonia in a great trial 2 Cor. 8. 2.
of affliction, and in their deep poverty, to have withal abundance of joy.
This made the godly Hebrews to take joyfully the spoiling of their goods,
knowing Heb. 10. 34.
that they had in heaven a better and enduring substance. Finally, by this the
Apostle himself was filled with comfort, and exceeding joyful in all his 2.
Cor. 7. 8.
tribulations. But contrariwise, the carnal joy of worldlings in the pleasures
of sin, is fickle and false, mutable and momentany, like the short blaze and
crackling of thorns under a pot, or laughter in a fit of frenzy, Eccl. 7. 6.
or of a man tickled, which laugheth in the face and countenance, when he is
grieved at the heart; because in the midst of their mirth they have many a
cold qualme and check of conscience, being not able to forget, that after all
their youthful rejoicing, they must come unto Judgment. Chap. 11. verse. 9.
The which even in laughter makes the heart sorrowful, because the end of
Prou. 14. 13.
their mirth is heaviness; and when they glory in outward appearance, to have
2. Cor. 5. 12.
no joy at all in the heart. For who but fools can rejoice in their full
barnes, and abundant provisions, that remembers, This night his soul shall be
Luke 12. 20.
taken from him? Who can have any sound joy and comfort in such pleasures and
delights, which within a while shall end in endless woe and misery; according
to that of our Savior, Woe unto you that laugh now, for Luk 6. 25.
ye shall mourn and weep?

. Sect. 6 That this spiritual joy is proper to the godly, and belongs to no
other.
Finally, the faithful, who resolve and endeavor to serve and please God in
the duties of a godly life, have propriety in this spiritual and Psalm. 33. 1.
Psalm. 111. 8, 15.
heavenly joy, seeing it belongs to them all, and to them alone, none other
having any part and share in this high and holy privilege. For first, this joy
in the Scriptures is appropriated unto them only, and no other. So the
Psalmist; Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous, for praise is comely for the
upright. And again, Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the
upright in heart. The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the Tabernacles of
the righteous. In which regard, he desires to see the good of Psalm. 106. 5.
Gods chosen, to rejoice in the gladness of his Nation, that he might glory
with his inheritance. And the Prophet Esaias joins these together; Thou meetest
Esa. 64. 5.
him that rejoices and works righteousness. Secondly, the faithful can
only thus rejoice, because all the causes of this spiritual joy belong
peculiarly unto them alone. For they only are elected to salvation, in which
respect, our Savior exhorts his Disciples to rejoice in this, because their
names were written in the Book of life. They alone are the redeemed of Luke
10. 20.
the Lord, who being freed out of the captivity of all their spiritual
enemies, have exceeding great and just cause to rejoice in this gracious
deliverance. And when by the glad tidings of the Gospel, the Lord proclaims
Esa. 61. 1, 2, 3.
liberty to captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound,
then does he also thereby comfort them that mourn, giving unto them beauty
for ashes, and for mourning, the oil of joy. So the Prophet says, that the
redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Sion; and
everlasting Esa. 51. 11.
joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness, and joy; and
sorrow and mourning shall flee away. They are called to the Marriage of the
Math. 22. 2.
Kings Son, and feasted with a delicious banquet of his special favors; and
none but they have communion with Christ, that they may rejoice Cant. 2. 4, 5.
and solace themselves in the fruition of his love. They, and none besides, are
justified of Gods free grace, through the righteousness and obedience of Jesus
Christ, and therefore have cause to be of good comfort, seeing Math. 9. 2.
their sins are forgiven them. So the faithful profess, that they would
greatly rejoice in the Lord, and that their souls should be joyful in their
God, Esa. 61. 10.
because he had clothed them with the garment of salvation, and covered them
with the robe of righteousness, as a Bridegroom decketh himself with
ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her self with her Jewels. They also have
cause, above all others, of joy and rejoicing, in that they are reconciled unto
God by Jesus Christ, and are at peace with him, and with their own
consciences, Romans 5. 1, 3.
in which respect they have just cause of glorying in their tribulations: for
this peace with God, passes all understanding, and his love is Phil. 4. 7.
Cant. 1. 2.
better then wine, refreshing and cheering our hearts more, then all the cold
qualmes of worldly crosses can daunt and dismay them; seeing by Gods love
toward us, and our love toward him, we have this privilege, that all things
shall work together for our good. They alone have the Spirit of Romans 8. 28.
God dwelling in them, which works in their hearts this spiritual joy, Gal.
5. 22.
and by uniting them unto Christ, and through him unto God his Father, the
Author and Fountain of all goodness, blessedness and joy, does give unto
them cause sufficient of triumphing with joy unspeakable and Esa. 51. 12.
glorious, in the fruition of all happiness through this sweet and happy
communion. Finally, the faithful only who serve and please God, have hope and
assurance of eternal blessedness in the Kingdom of heaven, when all tears
being wiped away from their eyes, they shall be comforted Apoc. 21. 4.
after their mourning, and after their weeping, laugh and rejoice. For Math. 5.
4.
the Lord will show them the path of life, and cause them to enjoy in his
presence Luke 6. 21.
fullness of joy, and at his right hand pleasures for evermore. In which
regard, Psalm. 16. 11.
the godly, in this assurance of faith, have as much greater, and better cause
of rejoicing above all worldlings, who abound in their present possessions of
earthly wealth, and wallow themselves in voluptuous pleasures, as a young heir
in his nonage, who expects the inheritance of some goodly Lordship, or if you
will, some great and glorious Monarchy, has more cause of rejoicing, then a
poor cotager in a silly tenement, in which for the present he dwells, but
yet only holds it at the Landlords pleasure. For there we shall have riches
and treasures which Mat. 6. 19, 20.
cannot rust with canker, nor we be robbed of them by thieves; there are
honors subject to no blemish of disgrace, and pleasures for evermore. In all
which respects, let the righteous be glad, as the Psalmist exhorts, let Psalm.
68. 3.
them rejoice before God, yea, let them exceedingly rejoice. And that not by
fits and flashes, but at all times, and upon all occasions, according to that
of the Apostle; Rejoice evermore. Neither is there any time unseasonable for 1.
These. 5. 16.
the spiritual joy of the righteous, so long as they have the face and favor
of God shining upon them, which is all-sufficient in it self to turn all
their mourning into mirth, and their sorrow into gladness; even when they are
sore pinched and pressed with the weight of their afflictions; and cause them
to rejoice inwardly in their hearts, when their cheeks are bedewed with their
tears. Herein, quite contrary to the wicked, who rejoice in the face, but not
in the heart, whereas the faithful 2. Cor. 5. 12.
do inwardly glory, even in their tribulations, which notwithstanding being
bitter and unpleasant to the flesh, do make them to discover nothing but grief
in their outward countenance. Yea, sorrow for sin it self, when as we
mourn as a man mourns for the death of his only son and first borne, does
not abate our spiritual joy, yea in truth it does much increase it; for this
godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, not to 2. Cor. 7. 10.
be repented of, and causes the true Christian exceedingly to rejoice, in that
he can heartily grieve, because by his sins he has displeased his God. And
this trembling in the sight and sense of our sins, and the Judgments of God
due unto them, may, through faith assuring us, that by Christ we are freed from
them, be joined with inward gladness, according to that of the Psalmist; Serve
the Lord with fear, and rejoice Psalm. 2. 11.
with trembling.

. Sect. 7 An admonition to the faithful, to lay hld on this joyful
privilege, and to shake off sorrow and sadness.
By all which it appears, that godliness does not deprive any of joy and
gladness; yea rather, the more godly we are, the better right and title we
have unto it, and may justly exceed all others as much in mirth and
cheerfulness, as we have in us more then they, the causes of all sound and
solid rejoicing. The which as it should persuade all who are yet unresolved, to
enter without delay, into this Christian course, that they may attain unto
this high and excellent privilege, and not suffer themselves to be any longer
discouraged with this vain and false conceit, that they must leave all their
chiefest joys, when they leave and forsake the pleasures of sin: so should
it move those who have a desire and purpose to serve and please God, to lay
hold of this joyful privilege, seeing God freely offers it unto them, and
not any longer to please themselves with their melancholic dumpes, and
affected sadness, as though they were greatest proficients in mortification,
when they most exceed in lumpish heaviness, which needs to be mortified as well
as any other carnal affection, that in stead thereof our hearts may be
replenished with spiritual joy. For hereby they do not only exceedingly
discredit and disgrace a godly life, and by casting upon it this false
aspersion of sorrow and sadness, discourage others from entering into it; but
also make it to become so tedious and troublesome, harsh and unpleasant, that
they cannot proceed in it without much vncomfortablenesse; nor perform the
duties of Gods service with any cheerfulness and delight, when as their
spirits are dulled and deaded with this mournful and dejected heaviness. For
as the Wise man has observed; Heaviness in the heart of man makes Pro. 12.
25.
it stoop, needing no other burden to ouerwhelme it, seeing it is pressed
down with its own weight. And again; A merry heart makes a cheerful Pro.
15. 13, 15.
countenance, but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. All the days of
the afflicted are evil, but he that is of a merry heart, has a continual
feast. And in another place; A merry heart does good like a medicine, but a
broken Prou. 17. 22.
spirit dries the bones. Now that they may shake off this sadness, and raise
their drooping hearts with spiritual joy, let them consider, that sorrow and
heaviness in themselves are evil, and the fruits of sin; and therefore are
not simply acceptable unto God, who delights not in the grief and vexation
of his servants, but only when they are sanctified, moderate in their measure,
seasonable in their time, placed upon a right subject, which can be nothing
else but sin and punishment, and directed to a right end. Secondly, that
sanctified joy is a fruit of the Spirit, and pleasing unto God, as being a part
of that service which he requires of us in the first Table, seeing this is
one way of having God in our hearts, when we rejoice in him; besides that, it
is a means of all other parts of Gods worship, which cannot be well performed
without joy and cheerfulness. Thirdly, let them consider, that the Lord
promises this joy and gladness, as a singular privilege, and a special
benefit unto the faithful; and therefore that it is great folly to refuse it
when he offers it. Thus the Prophet says, that in the Church shall be
heard the voice of joy, and the Ier. 33. 11.
voice of gladness; the voice of the Bridegroom, and the voice of the Bride;
the voice of them that shall say, Praise the Lord of hosts. For the Lord is
good, and his mercy indureth for ever. And our Savior has promised, that he
will Joh. 16. 22.
give unto the faithful such constant and permanent joy, as no man shall be
able to take from the^. Fourthly, that the privation of this joy is threatened
as a punishment for sin: Thou shall not go into the house of feasting, to
Jer. 16. 8. and 23. 10.
sit with them to eat and drink: For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of
Israel, Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in
your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
Bridegroom, and the voice of the Bride. And again; I will cause all her mirth
to Hos. 2. 11.
cease, her feast days, her new Moons and Sabbaths, and all her solemn
feasts. And therefore who can please himself in affecting sorrow and
heaviness, which the Lord threateneth as a punishment of sin? Fifthly, let
them consider, that as mourning is a preparation to faith, and (as it were) a
sorrowful seed-time; so joy and rejoicing is the effect and fruit, the croppe
and harvest of it, whereby we may try it, both in respect of the truth, and
also the degree of it; for whereas there is no rejoicing, there is no faith;
little joy, weak faith; and fullness of joy, fullness also of persuasion.
Neither is it possible that a man can have assurance of Gods love, the
remission of his sins, and of that inestimable happiness which is reserved
in our heavenly inheritance, but that his heart must needs be filled with joy
and rejoicing. Although it cannot be denied, but that in the time of our first
conversion and humiliation, and in the case of spiritual desertions, when God
hides his face, and seems to withdraw from us the testimonies of his love
and favor; this joy is so eclypsed, that the warmth and comfort of it is
hardly to be discerned, even as faith it self, from which it springs, is
like a fire raked under the ashes, and not to be perceived by sense and
feeling. Finally, consider that this spiritual joy makes us blessed, as not
only being it self full of sweetness and comfort, but also the first
beginning, and the very entrance into the eternal joys of Gods Kingdom;
wherewith our drooping hearts are so cheered and refreshed, that all
difficulties become easy, all tediousness in Gods service is taken away, and
the time that is spent therein seems short and pleasant. In which respect the
Psalmist pronounces that people blessed, Psalm. 89. 15, 16.
that know the joyful sound, because they shall walk cheerfully in the light
of Gods countenance; rejoicing in his name all the day, and being exalted in
his righteousness. And therefore let all those who desire to go forward in
the duties of a godly life with comfort and cheerfulness, labor to have
their hearts replenished with this spiritual joy, and to scatter and dispell,
as much as in them lies, the foggy mists of sad, melancholy, and lumpish
heaviness, which makes us either to stand still in the ways of godliness
for want of this joyful light, or to go forward in them slowly, and with much
discomfort and weariness. And to this end, let them labor earnestly to live
the life of faith, which draws from Christ all the cordials of comfort, and
to be thereby more and more assured of the remission of their sins, their
reconciliation with God, and of the eternal salvation of their souls, which
will lift up their hearts with unspeakable joy, even when they are most
dejected with worldly afflictions; and make them to go on cheerfully in the
duties of Gods service, when they are fully ascertained of such liberal wages,
and such an inestimable recompense of heavenly rewards.

CAP. XVI.
Three other objections of the flesh against a godly life, propounded, and
answered.

. Sect. 1 That a godly life takes away no lawful liberty, but rather
establishes it.
THe fourth objection which the flesh makes against a godly life, is, that it
takes away all our liberty, and so checketh and curbeth us in all our
thoughts, words, and works, within the strict limits of Gods Law, that we
have no freedom like other men, to think, speak, or do such things as are
most pleasing unto us. To which I answer, that it does not deprive us of any
lawful liberty, but only restrains us from lawless licentiousness, and
curbeth in the flesh, that it may not run on in exorbitant courses, and glut it
self with sinful pleasures, which always end in grief and bitterness.
Wherein it does not take away any true liberty, but rather freeth us from the
most miserable and grievous bondage, and basest servitude Ioh. 8. 34.
and thraldom unto Satan, sin, and our own lusts. Yea, rather by leading of
a godly life, we are restored unto that ancient and true liberty in which we
were created, even the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, resembling
herein our heavenly Father, who, though he be most free to do whatsoever
pleases him, yet in respect of his holy and pure nature, cannot sin, or do
any evil which is contrary unto it. And as well may we say that the glorified
Saints, who are crowned with joy and happiness, have lost all their liberty,
because they are so confirmed by supernatural grace, that they cannot sin,
as that we are deprived of it, because we are restrained by Gods Word and holy
Spirit from all manner of wickedness; or that a son has lost his liberty,
when he lives according to his Fathers will that dearly loves him, and is
freed from the government of some base slave, who egged and thrust him on in
all wicked courses, which in the end would deprive him of his fathers love, and
justly disinherite him of his desired patrimony. Yea, let us know, that as
sin is the greatest bondage, so the service of God is the greatest and best
liberty; when as we are stablished in all grace and goodness by his free
Spirit, Psalm. 51. 12.
and submit our selves to be guided and directed by it in all our ways, as the
body by the soul. For as the Apostle speaks, Where the Spirit of the Lord
is, there is liberty. Let us know, that as our Savior Christ came amongst us
2. Cor. 3. 37.
to take away the sins of the world, both in respect of the guilt,
punishment, and corruption: so also, as our Redeemer, to free us out of
bondage, and to purchase for us perfect liberty, which is, that being delivered
out of Luke 1. 74, 75.
the hands of all our spiritual enemies, we should worship and serve him in
holiness and righteousness before him without fear, all the days of our
lives. Of which liberty himself speaks; If the Son shall make ye free, ye
shall be Ioh 6. 36.
free indeed. And therefore let us not hearken to the flesh, which abuses and
deludeth us, by giving unto things false names, gracing the bondage of sin and
thraldom unto our own lusts, with the glorious title of liberty, and
disgracing our Christian liberty and freedom from sin, with the name of
bondage; but knowing that this was one special end of Christ's coming and
dying for us, that he might destroy the works of 1. Joh. 3. 8.
the devil, and free us out of the bondage of sin; let us stand fast in Gal.
5. 1, 13.
the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, and not be entangled again
with the yoke of bondage. And seeing he has called us unto liberty, let us not
abuse it for an occasion to the flesh, as the Apostle exhorts.

. Sect. 2 That a godly life does not take away friendship and good society, but
rather increases it.
The fifth objection against a godly life is, that it takes away all familiar
friendship and good fellowship, all merry meetings and civil conversation from
amongst men, estranging their minds one from another, and making them to
delight more in solitariness then in company. To which I answer, that if by
these glorious names of friendship, good fellowship, and civil conversation,
be meant the common commerce which worldly wicked men have one with another,
in the works of darkness and pleasures of sin, in gluttony and
drunkenness, in May-games, misrule, and mad merriments, in carnal
reuellings, Stage Plays, Wakes, and Morrice-dances, in swaggering, swearing,
backebiting, and corrupt and filthy communication; in dycing, carding, and
spending both their time and states in unlawful gaming; then is it no blemish
or aspersion unto a godly life, but rather an high praise and commendation,
that it breaks off such wicked and dangerous societies, and reformeth such
pernicious disorders as always end in grief and vexation. But if hereby be
understood true friendship, and Christian familiarity and acquaintance, lawful
meetings, and joyful feasting with one another in the true fear of God; then
does not a godly life abolish them, but rather confirm and increase them among
all true Christians. For purging away the corruptions, and rectifying the
disorders of societies and conversation, and making them truly civil and
religious, it causes them to be much more comfortable and profitable, and
consequently more frequently to be affected by all those who taste the
sweetness and benefit which comes of them, without any sting of sin, or
after-tang of bitter grief. As we see in the example of those Christians,
which lived in the first age of the Act. 2. 46.
Primitive Church, who took exceeding joy in the Communion of Saints, in
mutual conuersing one with another, and in their frequent meetings, to eat
and drink and rejoice together. And therefore unless any will presuppose,
that sin is the only bond of all good fellowship, and that we cannot take
pleasure in one another company, unless we join together to displease and
dishonor God, and that we can never be merry so long as he is with us; And
unless we account that only to be ciuility, when as we show no dislike of
sin, but soothe and bolster, yea, encourage and thrust on all that bear us
company in the ways of wickedness; let us not falsely affirm, that a godly
life is any hindrance to civil conversation, or that it depriueth us of the
mutual joy and comfort, which we might otherwise take in friendship and
fellowship one with another.

. Sect. 3 That a godly life does not bring with it want and poverty.
The sixth objection is, that godliness brings with it want and poverty, as
appears first by common experience, and innumerable examples of those, who
being most religious and conscionable in all their courses, come as far short
of other men in worldly wealth, as they exceed and go before them in piety and
honest dealing, in so much as it is grown into a common, yet wicked Proverb,
that plain dealing is a Jewel, but he that uses it, shall dye a beggar. And
secondly, it stands with reason that it should be so, seeing piety lets
pass, and refuses many advantages, by which, those that want it, do increase
their wealth, and improoue their worldly estate. For their thoughts less run
upon earthly things, being taken up with heavenly; their endeavors are more
faint and weak in pursuing them, then theirs who have set their hearts upon
them; their time and strength is not so wholly employed in getting and keeping
riches. They lose much which they might get, because they will not use
unlawful means, as fraud and deceit, extortion and oppression; because they
will not lie, and confirm it with an oath for their advantage; nor profane
the Sabbath by selling and buying, and laboring in their callings; nor keep
servants under them, who make no conscience of these things, though they be
never so profitable, nor follow the bent of the times, and soothe every one in
their humor, of whom they may make any advantage. And finally, because they
will not stoop to every bait of profit which is cast before them, until by
due examination in the Court of Conscience it may appear to be honest and
lawful. To which I answer, first, that though all this were true, that
godliness should give a Supersedeas to worldly thrift, so that it were not
possible to embrace piety, and escape poverty, or to be rich and religious
both at once; yet this should not weaken our resolution to serve God in the
duties of a godly life, seeing our spiritual gains do far exceed our
worldly loss. For godliness it self is the chiefest gain, as 1. Tim. 6. 6.
bringing with it that contentation which all worldly wealth cannot purchase.
Secondly, though being godly, we have but a poor estate, yet it is more to be
esteemed then the greatest abundance of the ungodly, according to that of the
Psalmist; A little that a righteous man has, is better Psalm. 37. 16, 17.
then the riches of many wicked. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
but the Lord vpholdeth the righteous. The little wealth they have, is
accompanied with Gods blessing, by which it is made more sufficient and durable
for their use and comfort, then the rich Treasuries, and full storehouses of
worldlings; their little pittance, being like the Widows cruze of oil and
handful of meal, which as it was daily spent, so by the blessing of God it
was daily renewed and replenished, that there might be no want, when the full
barnes were emptied, and the storehouses of the rich without food; like Daniels
pulse, which made him and his fellows fatter and in better liking, then the
provision which was brought to others from the Kings Table. Finally, like the
small streams of a living fountain, which continue running in the greatest
drought, when great standing waters, and huge torrents arising from land waters
are dried up. Again, though the godly have but little, yet that which they
have, they have received from Gods own hand, as a testimony of his love and
favor, as Jacob acknowledged to his brother Esau, Take, I pray thee, my Genesis
33. 11.
blessing which is brought to thee, because God has dealt graciously with me,
and I have enough. Yea, they receive it from him as his free gift, and shall
never be called with wicked men to account for intrusion and usurpation.
Neither is it a gift to be esteemed only in its own value, but as an
earnest-penny, which binds a greater bargain, and gives them assurance of
their heavenly inheritance, and everlasting happiness in Gods Kingdom.
Finally, though they have but little, yet they have with it a good conscience,
seeing they have gotten it by lawful means, the which will be in stead of a
continual feast, and make a dinner of cold Pro. 15. 15, 17.
herbs, or simple roots, better then a stalled Ox, or the greatest dainties
to them that want it. Whereas contrariwise, the greater plenty of wicked men
brings no such comfort with it; because it is mutable and momentany in it
self, and gives no assurance of better and more durable riches which shall
succeed it. Because their worldly abundance is often joined with many and great
discontents, which depriueth the owners of all their joy, as we see in the
example of Saul, Ahab, Haman, and many others. Because their prosperity slays
them, whilst it serves as a snare, to entangle Pro. 1. 32.
them in all manner of sins; as a pasture, to fit and prepare them for
destruction; as an intoxicating cup, to bewitch and inamour them with worldly
love, and to make them neglect spiritual and heavenly things; because after
their great cheer, they shall have such an heavy reckoning as will quite dampe
all their music and delight. And finally, because they are no gifts of Gods
love and favor, but rather of his clemency and forbearance; like the liberal
allowance which Princes make to great and noble Traitors, until they be
brought forth to trial and execution, according to course and extremity of
the Law.

. Sect. 4 That though many godly men are poor, yet godliness is no cause of
their poverty.
In the second place I answer, that though many are poor who are godly, yet
their godliness is not the cause of their poverty; seeing it only finds,
but not makes them to be in this penurious estate. For when the Gospel is
preached, the poor rather receive it then the rich, seeing the little comfort
which they have in earthly things, does make them to seek for it in
spiritual and heavenly; whereas the abundance of the rich intangleth their
hearts in the snares of worldly love, choketh in them the seed of Gods Word,
and makes them to neglect the means of their salvation. Thirdly, I answer,
that godliness is a cause and means of riches, and not of poverty, seeking it
has the promises of this life, and that 1. Tim. 4. 8.
which is to come; and God has undertaken (who is able and all-sufficient)
seeing the earth is his, and all that therein is, and most true and infallible
in Psalm. 24. 1.
his Word) that nothing which is good, shall be wanting unto those that Psalm.
34. 10. and 84. 11.
fear and serve him; that if we will first seek his Kingdom and
righteousness, all other things shall be cast upon us; that he will withhold no
good thing from them that walk uprightly. That if we will cease to do evil,
and learn Esaias 1. 17, 18, 19.
to do well, if we consent and obey, we shall eat the good things of the
Land. If indeed riches were simply our own earnings, and could be gotten by
our own policies, care and labor, then those who exceed others in all these,
might promise unto themselves the greatest plenty, though they utterly neglect
Gods service; but seeing it is only Gods blessing that makes rich, it is not
to be imagined, that the Lord, infinite in bounty and goodness, will be less
liberal in paying our wages, because we are more faithful and diligent in
doing his work. And therefore if we fear want and poverty, it must not
discourage us from the service of God, but rather be a strong motive to make us
serve him with more earnest endeavor, seeing he will preserve those who serve
him from poverty, so far forth as it is evil and a punishment of sin, and
will give unto them all temporal blessings, so far forth as they are good
and profitable. And if he scant them of these earthly trifles, it is but to fit
them for the receiving of his greater and better gifts, even the rich treasures
of his spiritual graces, faith, hope, patience and the rest, and for the
everlasting riches and glory of his heavenly Kingdom. For he that rewarded
Solomon with peace, wealth and honor, because in the first 1. King. 3. 9, 11.
place he desired civil wisdom to govern the people, will not deny them unto
those, who affect above all things spiritual Wisdom, consisting in true
godliness; if in his divine Wisdom, he does see that it is better for them to
have them, then to want and be scanted of them.

CAP. XVII.
Their objection answered, who allege that their poverty presses them to
such continual labor, that they have no leisure for the duties of a godly
life.

. Sect. 1 That Gods Commandments bind unto obedience both poor and rich.
THe seventh objection is made by those who are afflicted with poverty, and
cannot, without much labor and great pains, procure necessaries for the
sustayning of their own lives and those that depend upon them. O, say they, we
are so miserably poor, that unless we spend our whole time in the works of
our callings, we cannot get such a small competency as is sufficient to hold
life and soul together, nor food and clothing for our selves, wives, children
and families, which we must provide for, unless we would be worse then
Infidels, being bound so to do both by the Law of God and nature. And
therefore having no spare time to spend in Religious duties, we hope that God
will have us excused, and not impute the fault unto us, but to our poverty,
which necessarily constrains us to neglect the duties of his service, which
if we had time and leisure, like other men, we would willingly perform. To
which I answer first, that the Law and commandments of God are given
indefinitely and generally unto all men, the poor as well as the rich, and tie
all sorts of men equally and indifferently unto obedience, without any
exemption or toleration granted to any state and condition. Otherwise, if such
excuses might pass for current pay, none would want pretenses to slip their
necks out of the yoke of obedience, seeing prosperity and plenty, as well as
adversity and penury, do not want their several employments, and
distractions enough to hinder us from the duties of Gods service, if at least we
will yield and give way unto them. Secondly I answer, that the state of
poverty being sanctified unto us, is much more fit for the duties of Gods
service, then that which flows with plenty and abundance, as being less
subject to many potent vices and corruptions which hinder us in them, as pride
and self-love, wrath and insolency, sloth and idleness, intemperance,
insobriety and many others.

. Sect. 2 That poverty hinders not Gods graces in us, but rather furthereth
them.
Thirdly, poverty does not hinder any of Gods graces in us: Yea, through Gods
blessing, does much further and increase them; as meekness, humility,
patience, temperance, sobriety, watchfulness in prayer. Yea, it does not make
us less fit for any, either in respect of the graces themselves or the
practice and exercise of them; for saving graces are not bought for money, nor
lost for want of coin to purchase them, but are the gifts of God, which he
gives freely without respect of persons, to poor and rich, if they hunger and
thirst after them; according to that gracious call: Ho, every one that
thirsts, come ye to the waters, and he that has no money, come ye, buy and
Esaias 51. 1.
eat, yea come buy wine and milk without money, and without price. So our
Savior Christ; If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink; Joh. 7.
37, 38, 39.
he that believes on me, as the Scripture has said, out of his belly shall
flow rivers of living water; that is, the saving graces of his sanctifying
Spirit, as he expounds it in the words following. Neither does poverty
hinder the Spiritual exercise of any grace in our outward practice, no, not
Christian bounty and beneficence, which God measures not by the greatness of
the gift; but the obedience and liberality of the giver; For if a man has a
willing mind, he is accepted 2. Cor. 8. 12.
according to that which he has, and not according to that which he has
not, as in this particular case the Apostle speaks. The which our Savior
evidently shows in the example of the poor, yet liberal widow, whose two
mites being all her wealth, was esteemed the greatest gift that was cast into
the Treasury. Much less does poverty hinder us in the duties of Gods
service, which seeing they are to be performed, not with outward pomp, but in
Spirit and Truth, need not the help of money and riches to further Ioh. 4. 24.
us in them. And this the examples of all Gods Saints, who have lived in former
ages, do evidently show, unto whom poverty was no impediment to hinder them
from performing unto God any duty of his service. For the poor Fishermen were
no less diligent in all religious duties, then the wealthy Patriarchs; poor
Lazarus, then rich Abraham; Amos an heard-man, then Esayas of the Kings stock;
Paul a poor Tent-maker, then David a rich King; yea, our Savior Christ
himself, as he exceeded all others in poverty, living upon alms, and not
having a place of his own Luke 9. 58.
where to lay his head; so he exceeded all men that ever lived in piety, and
in the practice of all Religious duties belonging to a godly life.

. Sect. 3 That the more poor we are, the more earnest we should be in Gods
service.
Fourthly, I answer, that the more poor we are in our outward estate, the
more intentive and diligent should we be in the service of 1. Tim. 6. 6.
God, and all religious exercises; that being defective in earthly blessings,
we may be made rich in all spiritual and saving graces, and that wanting with
Peter and John, silver and gold, we may with them exceed in Godliness, which
is the chiefest Gain, and brings with it the greatest contentment. Finally,
that having no other patrimony in lands and houses, wherein we might delight
our selves, we do make Gods testimonies to be our heritage for ever, and the
very rejoicing Psalm. 119. 111.
of our hearts. Fifthly, seeing the whole earth and all therein is, is the
Lords, and at his disposing, to whom he pleases, and it is his blessing alone
which makes rich, therefore the more poor we Psalm. 24. 1.
are, the more painful and diligent should we be in all duties of his
service, that he may so bless our labors, and prosper our handy-worke, as
that it may be an effectual means, serving his providence, for procuring some
sufficiency of these temporal benefits. Thus David acknowledged, that it was
the Lord whom he served, Psalm. 23. 5.
that had furnished his table. That it is he who gives unto all, their Psalm.
145. 15, 16.
meat in due season, and by opening his hand, does satisfy the desire of
every living thing. That except the Lord build the house, they labor Psalm.
127. 1, 2.
in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the City, the watchman waketh
but in vain; And that it is in vain for us to rise up early, to sit up late,
and to eat the bread of sorrows, unless the Lord do bless our labors, as
the experience of many in all times plainly shows, whose carking care, and
restless labors will not afford them such necessaries, as are cast upon
others with little pains. It is the Lord, as 1. Sam. 2. 7, 8.
Hanna professes, who makes poor, and makes rich, brings low, and lifts
up; He rayseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from
the dunghill, to set them among Princes, and to make them inherit the Crown
of glory. It is the blessing of the Lord that makes rich, and adds Pro. 10.
22.
no sorrow with it, as the Wise man speaks; and it is his powerful Word, by
which we live, and not by bread only, as himself teaches us. Deuteronomy. 8. 3.
Matthew. 4. 4.
And therefore let us not think, that by neglecting Gods service we shall
thrive the better, or that we shall have the more liberal wages, because we
are slothful in doing his work, and spend our whole time and strength about
our own.

. Sect. 4 That if being poor, we carefully serve God, we may securely cast our
selves upon his gracious providence, and expect him to be our reward.
Sixthly, though we be poor, and have nothing to sustain us and our charge,
but what we earne with our daily and painful labor, yet if we do not
wholly addict our selves to the world, but allot seasonable times to Gods
worship and service, we shall not be the nearer to want and penury; yea rather,
laying aside all carking care, we may securely cast our selves with full
affiance upon his providence and promises, and expect such a blessing upon the
labors of our hands performed in due place and time, as that neither we, nor
those that belong unto us, shall want food convenient, nor any other thing that
is good. For if the Lord be so gracious and bountiful, that he provides for
strangers, who serve Satan and their own lusts, how can we imagine that he will
suffer those of his own family, who spare time from their necessary
employments, that they may do him faithful service, to want and pine for
hunger? If his providence extends to the Fowls Mat. 6. 26, 28.
of heaven, and the beasts of the field, to feed them without their care, and
if he clotheth the Lillies of the field without their labor, how will he not
take greater care for us that are his household servants, and adopted children,
who moderately use our best study and endeavor to serve his providence, in
providing things necessary, but so in the mean time, as that we will, by
borrowing some time from the works of our callings, rather endanger our selves
to want, then we will be wanting unto him in spiritual duties of his service?
Let us then, as the Apostle exhorts, be careful for nothing, but resting
upon his Phil. 4. 6.
care and providence with firm affiance, let us in all our necessities, by
prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make our requests known unto God.
For the Lord has bound himself freely by many gracious promises, that if
casting off all carking care, we trust in him, and serve him in the duties of
piety and righteousness, he will provide for us what we stand in need of,
and will not suffer us to want any thing that is good. So the Psalmist, Trust
in the Lord, and do good, so shall thou dwell in the land, Psalm. 37. 3, 5. Pro.
16. 3. Psalm. 34. 9, 10.
and verily thou shall be fed. Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in
him, and he shall bring it to pass. O fear the Lord, ye his Saints, for
there is no want to them that fear him. The young Lions do lack and suffer
hunger: but they that seek the Lord, shall not want any good things. So the
Wise man tells us, that the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous
to famish, but he Pro. 10. 3.
casts away the substance of the wicked. The which David saw confirmed in his
own experience, having not observed in all his time from his youth to old age,
that the righteous had been at any time forsaken, or Psalm. 37. 25.
their seed begging their bread. And thus the Apostle Peter exhorts us to
cast all our care upon the Lord, for he cares for us. The which promises 1.
Pet. 5. 7.
the Apostle to the Hebrews lays as a ground of his disswasion from
covetousness and discontent; Let your conversation (says he) be without
covetousness, and be content with such things as ye have: for he has said,
Heb. 13. 5.
I will not leave thee nor forsake thee. Seventhly, if we deuote our selves
unto Gods service and love, as it beseems his children, in holy obedience,
allotting time convenient to religious duties, the Lord himself will be our
wages and exceeding great reward, and he that is God all-sufficient, Genesis 15.
1. Chap. 17. 1. Deus mihi sufficit, etiamsi caetera cuncta ferat alius. Gregor.
Nazian. Cygn. Carmin. lib. Nimis auarus est, cui Deus non sufficit.
in the absence of all earthly helps and means, will be our portion and
inheritance, which whosoever enjoy, can want nothing. And this argument the Lord
uses to encourage Abraham to serve him; Fear not, Abraham, I am thy shield,
and thine exceeding great reward. And again, I am the almighty, or
all-sufficient God, walk before me, and be thou upright. And therefore let us
say with one of the Ancients; God alone suffices me, although who so will
take all things else besides him; for he is too covetous whom God cannot
satisfy. Eighthly, if we be diligent in Gods service, though we have not so
much as others, yet that little we have (as before I showed) is much better
then their great riches and revenues who neglect it. According to that of the
Wise man, Better is a little with righteousness, then great revenues without
Pro. 16. 8. and 28. 6. and 15. 16
right. Better is the poor that walks in his uprightness, then he that is
perverse in his ways, though he be rich. And, Better is a little with the
fear of the Lord, then great treasures and trouble therewith. For as the
Psalmist says, The Lord knows the days of the upright, and their
inheritance shall be for Psalm. 37. 18, 19.
ever; they shall not be ashamed in the evil time; and in the days of famine
they shall be satisfied, etc. Again, that little which the righteous have,
that fear and serve God, is better then the abundance of the wicked, who serve
the world and their own lusts, because that godliness which is joined with
it, is the greatest gain, and in the lowest estate 1. Tim. 6. 6.
brings contentation, which is a Jewel of such value, that it is above the
purchase of all earthly riches, and cannot be bought with the price of a
monarchy. According to that of the Wise man; The righteous eats to the
satisfying of his soul, though his commons be never so Pro. 13. 25.
short; but the belly of the wicked shall want, even when he sits at his
full furnished table. For when his appetite is satisfied, he is not satisfied,
because he wants an appetite.

. Sect. 5 That the objection of poverty is but a frivolous and false excuse.
Finally, let all those know, who object their poverty, and their continual
labors to supply their wants, as an excuse for their neglect of Gods service
in the duties of a godly life, that it is but a false and frivolous pretense,
whereby they palliat and color their irreligious profaneness. For they who
will not serve God when they are poor, would much less do it if they were
rich. They that will sue and seek unto God for help and succor, when they
are destitute of necessaries, would much more neglect him, if their storehouses
were full, and their tables furnished with all plenty. They that will not call
upon Esa. 26. 16.
the Lord when they are in trouble, nor power forth a prayer unto him when his
chastizement is upon him, would much more forget him and neglect this duty in
their prosperity and security from danger. And who sees not by continual
experience, that many who have seemed diligent and devout in the duties of Gods
service, in their poor and mean estate, have afterward been loose and
lazy, cold and negligent, when the world has smiled upon them, and their
wealth and riches have been increased and multiplied? Neither in truth is
poverty, and pains to supply our wants, any hindrance to the daily and
necessary duties of Gods service, seeing if we order our time aright, and
wisely dispose of our business, both of them may well stand together. For the
Lord requires not at our hands, that we should spend the greatest part of our
time in religious exercises, and neglect the duties of our callings, but only
that we allot some small time to holy duties, and perform our honest labors
in the rest, therein yielding obedience by performing these works, because he
has required them. And so far is he off from exacting of us monkish
idleness, and vacancy from all labor, under pretense that we may wholly
deuote our selves to religious exercises, that he expressly forbids it,
and Prou. 6. 6. and 24. 30, 31. Prou. 27. 23. Ephesians. 4. 28. 2. These. 3. 10.
strictly requires painful diligence in the duties of our callings; and
contrariwise condemns sloth and negligence, adiudging those who will not
labor, as unworthy to eat, and censuring them to be worse then Infidels, who
by their diligence and care provide not for their family. But yet all 1. Tim.
5. 8.
this infers no necessity of neglecting religious duties, seeing there is no
man so wholly taken up with his labors, that may not find some spare time for
the duties of Gods service, seeing less is required hereunto, then he who is
most diligent spends in superfluous sleep, idel conferences, and upon other
needless and vselesse occasions; as we shall more fully show in answering the
next objection.

CAP. XVIII.
Their objection answered, who pretend that their multitude of worldly
employments will allow them no leisure for religious duties.

. Sect. 1 That earthly blessings are no hindrances unto godliness, but the
immoderate love of them.
WHen the mind and heart are indisposed to Gods service, and auerse to
religious exercises, the flesh will never want excuses to put them off, and
withdraw us from them; neither is there any estate and condition, which will
not minister distractions and discouragements. For if we be poor, it will
suggest, that all our time is little enough, though it be wholly spent in our
labors, that thereby we may earne and furnish our selves with things necessary
for our maintenance: if we have sufficiency and plenty of all temporal
blessings, they will steal our hearts from God, and so wholly fix them upon
earthly things, that they will find little or no leisure for spiritual
exercises. And now they have so many things to look unto, the care of so many
businesses lying upon them, so many and weighty employments, for the well
managing of their worldly estates, if they will not suffer all to go to loss,
and the blessings of God to perish through their negligence, that they cannot,
like others who have little to do, spend much of their time in religious
exercises; as prayer, reading and hearing the Word, meditation and such like.
Neither do they think it necessary that they should so do, seeing God will
excuse, if not approve and commend them, if they follow diligently the duties
of their callings. And this carnal disposition in worldly men, our Savior
taxes in the Parable of those unworthy ghests, who being invited unto the
Marriage Math. 22. 2.
of the Kings Son, pretend diverse excuses, all which are borrowed from their
worldly employments. One had bought a piece of ground, and must Luke 14. 18, 19.
needs go and see it; another had bought a yoke of Oxen, and must needs go to
prove them; another had married a wife, and could not come. Yea even Martha
her self, though otherwise a virtuous and religious Luke 10. 42.
woman, being encumbered with worldly employments, thought her neglect of
hearing Christ, excused, and her sister Mary, worthy blame, because she did not
join with her. For the answering of which objection, let us first know, that
Gods temporal blessings, which he has bestowed upon us, are not in
themselves any causes to hinder us from the duties of Gods service, but our
immoderate love of them, which makes us forget and neglect the Author of our
good, and to mind and affect the gifts, more then the giver. For otherwise,
the greatness of our means and possessions would not, through multitude of
employments, be distractions to hinder us from serving God, but rather
effectual motives to persuade us unto it, which also being rightly and wisely
managed, would afford us better leisure for religious duties, seeing we are
well provided for, though we take but moderate care, and but ordinary pains in
the works of our callings. It is not our necessary business and employments,
which so wholly take us up, that we have no time to spare for Gods service; but
such cumbersome employments which the inordinate and immoderate love of the
world and earthly things imposes upon us, that by excessive care and labor,
our state being managed to the greatest advantage, we may become suddenly
rich. It is not the comforts of this life which hinder us in the spiritual
race, but the sin and worldly concupiscence that does so Heb. 12. 1.
easily beset us, which makes them so weighty and cumbersome unto us. And
therefore we must mortify our carnal love of earthly things, if we would not
have them to be hindrances in spiritual exercises. For if we do not
immoderately affect them, we shall take little pleasure, so to cumber and
ouertoyle our selves in our worldly employments about them, that we can find
no time for religious duties. Let us not inordinately love the world, and
worldly things, if we would have the love of the Father to 1. Ioh. 2. 15. Math.
6 24.
abide in us; nor deuote our selves to the service of the earthly Mammon, if we
would have any time to spare for Gods service. Let us cease from our Pro 23. 4,
5.
carnal wisdom, and not labor to be rich, seeing riches make themselves
wings, and fly away, like an Eagle toward heaven. Let not this heavy
Judgment of God be drawn upon us by our worldly love, that we should take
pleasure to labor in the very fire, and weary our selves for very vanity. Let
us Hab. 2. 13.
remember, that a fearful woe is denounced against him, that toyleth himself
to increase that which is not his, and ladeth himself with thick clay; so as
Verse. 6.
he cannot go on cheerfully in the ways of godliness. And that, if to
multiply and heap up this worldly pelf, we neglect the duties of Gods
service, he will cross and curse our endeavors; and then we shall sow Hag.
1. 6, 7, 8.
much, and bring in little; eat, but not have enough; drink, and not be
satisfied; clothe our selves, and not be warm; and put all the wages which we
earne, into a bag with holes. For if God blow upon it, when we look for much,
it will come to little; or if he do not, he will bring upon us a more heavy
Judgment, by suffering us to enjoy our riches, which we immoderately love,
that we may fall into tentations and snares, and into many foolish and hurtful
1. Tim. 6 9, 10.
lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is
the root of all evil, which while some coueted after, they have erred from the
faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. And this is that sore
evil which Solomon observed under the Sun, namely, Riches kept for the Eccl.
5. 13.
owners thereof to their hurt. Let us remember, that when we have by all our
toil heaped up riches, they shall (as the Wise man speaks) perish by evil
travel; and he that has most wearied himself by getting wealth; As he verse.
15.
came forth of his mothers womb naked, so he shall return as he came, and
shall take nothing of his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.

. Sect. 2 That we must not undertake all employments which the world and flesh
will press upon us.
Finally, let us know, that if we will undertake all such employments as the
world and the flesh will impose upon us, they will play the cruel Pharaohs,
and oppress our souls with a much more cruel servitude then that of Egypt.
For if we do but make mention of surceasing our labors for a while, that we
may have some time to perform that service unto God which he requires,
imputing this unto us as some idle and lazy humor, they will redouble our
already too toylesome task, and press such devout purposes out of us with
their heavy burdens, and rather then we should want employment, to keep us
from serving God, they will cause us to tire our selves, night and day, in
gathering straw, that is, about idle vanities which will not profit, to be
afterward spent to as little purpose, namely, that upon the foundation of
riches thus scraped together, we may erect Pyramides and Towers threatening the
skies, and mansion houses and stately buildings, to continue our names unto
posterity. Yea in truth, there is not in the whole world such a terrible
bondage to the body under the most tyrannous Lords, as this is to the soul,
which the flesh and the world impose upon it. For in them it is lawful for the
slave at some time to find leisure for rest and sleep, for eating and
drinking, that being refreshed, he may again return to his task; whereas
these more cruel tyrants wear out those souls which are imbondaged by them
with toylesome labors, and yet will allow them no time for their spiritual
repast, nor to refresh themselves and repair their strength, by resting from
their labors upon the Lords Sabbaths, or by feeding upon the Manna of the
Word, in hearing, reading, and meditation, and by sequestring themselves from
earthly business, that they may by prayer and invocation, solace themselves in
that sweet communion which they have with God in this holy exercise. But if we
would have our souls to thrive in spiritual grace and strength, we must
shake off the yoke of this tyranny, and never be so wholly intent to advance
our worldly estate, as to neglect the taking of our souls repast in religious
exercises, according to the counsel of Hierome to a virtuous Matrone: So
(says he) take care of thine house, as that thou do always allow Ita habeto
solicitudiuem domus, vt aliquam tamen vacationem animae tribuas, etc. Hieron.
ad Celantiam.
some leisure and liberty to thy soul. Neither do I say this, that I would
withdraw thee wholly from thy charge; yea rather, I do it to this end, that in
this vacation from worldly business, thou may learn and meditate, how thou
ought to behave thy self toward thy family and charge, when thou returnest
unto them. For howsoever we must take care and pains about things concerning
this life, in due time and place, yet so, as we do according to our Saviors
counsel, give the priority and precedence, both in our judgments, affections,
and practice, unto spiritual and heavenly things, as being of far greater
weight and Math. 6. 33.
worth, seeking first the Kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and then
temporal and earthly things in a second and inferior place.

. Sect. 3 That no business is of like moment, as by serving God to save our
souls.
Neither is there any worldly business of like moment and importance, as by
serving God, to seek and assure the salvation of our souls. For this, as our
Savior teaches us, is that one thing necessary, in comparison Luke 10. 42.
whereof, all other things must be neglected, though they were of as high a
nature as Martha's employment, to give entertainment unto Christ himself. Of
which, if we were well persuaded, and did esteem spiritual and heavenly
things, according to their true worth, we, who can in our greatest employments
find some spare time to spend about earthly trifles of small value, would not
only be streighted and scanted of it for religious exercises. Let no man
(says one) think it a lawful excuse Jgitur nemo se excuset public is
actibus, nemo de occupatione militiae conqueratur, etc. August. in Psalm. 93.
Psalm. 119. 72. Verse. 127.
to allege his businesses of state, nor complain of his employments in the
wars; seeing with every faithful man the Christian warfare ought first to be
undertaken. And this was David's judgment, who esteemed the Law of the Lord
better unto him, then thousands of gold and silver. The which was seconded by
his affection; for as he professes, he loved Gods Commandments above gold,
yea above fine gold. So Solomon, or rather the eternal Wisdom of God by him,
teaches us to esteem our spiritual trading for the good of our souls, above
the merchandise of silver, and the Pro. 3. 14, 15. and 8. 11.
gain of godliness above fine gold; seeing it is more precious then rubies,
and all things that we can desire, are not to be compared unto it. So the Lord
by Jeremy, reckons all worldly things in comparison of this, as chafe to
wheat. Ier. 23. 28.
And the Apostle esteems those things that were greatest gain unto him, no
better then dung, yea, then loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Phil.
3. 7, 8. Joh. 6. 27.
Jesus Christ. And therefore let us not labor so much for the meat that
perishes, as to neglect for it the meat which endures to eternal life; as
our Savior Mar. 8. 36.
exhorts us; for what will it profit us to gain the whole world, and to Mat.
6. 19, 20.
lose our own souls? To get earthly treasures and riches, which the rust will
fret and the moth eat; and to lose those heavenly and everlasting treasures,
which are not subject to any casualties? To compass by our care and labor
Dives his dainty fare and costly clothing; and by neglecting the service of God
and the means of our salvation, to be cast with him into hell, where is
weeping and gnashing of teeth? For there (as one says) Illi vtique omnes
plangent, illi lugebunt, qui ita se curis vitae praesentis inuoluunt, vt
obliuiscantur futuram, etc. Hyer. ad Celant.
they shall wail and lament, who have so infolded themselves with the cares of
this life present, as that they could find no leisure to think of the life to
come; whom the coming of the Lord shall take at unawares, oppressed with the
sleep of ignorance and carnal security.

. Sect. 4 That they who neglect the duties of Gods service, cannot expect good
success to their labors.
Secondly, let all such know, that neglect the duties of Gods service, under
the pretense of their great and weighty employments, that they cannot in so
doing reasonably expect any good success of their toylesome Pro. 10. 22. Deuteronomy.
8. 18.
labors, or that they will answer their hopes, in the getting and preserving
of that wealth, which they so much love and long after; for it is not their
most careful and painful endeavors, but Gods blessing only that makes
rich; It is he alone that gives them power to get wealth. And how can they
expect this blessing from God upon their labors, when as they can find no
leisure to crave it at his hands? how can they think that he will,
notwithstanding all their pains, prosper their worldly estates, unless it be
for a further and more fearful Judgment, when as they have no care to serve
and please him? Yea, why may they not justly fear that he will blow upon their
wealth, and cause it to vanish like smoke, and Hag. 1. 9.
even to melt like butter in the Sun; or cause that riches, which is thus
wickedly gotten, by neglecting all duties of Gods service, to be as wickedly
spent by their heirs and successors, serving unto them as inducements and
helps to further them in all riotous and luxurious courses, to their ruin and
destruction, as the getting of them has been the cause and occasion of many
fearful sins, and of the utter neglect of all religious duties, that so
both they and their heirs, though they run contrary ways, may yet meet
together in hell and condemnation. Let them also know, that if before they go
about the works of their callings, they would renew their Covenant with God,
by renewing their faith and repentance; and so being reconciled, undertake
their employments with peaceable minds and good consciences; if they would
first call upon the Lord for his blessing upon their labors, and resign
themselves and all their affairs to the gracious guidance of his good
providence; If they would propound his glory, as the main end of all their
labor, and as they live the life of faith, so also they would labor in the
strength thereof; resting upon Gods gracious promises, and waiting for a
blessing upon all their affairs; if they would sanctify their 1. Tim 4. 5.
works by the Word and Prayer, without which, even those things which are in
their own nature pure and honest, become impure and 1. Cor. 10. 31.
profane to the irreligious and unbelievers, and desire the assistance of his
holy Spirit for the directing of all their labors to a right end; Finally, if
they would by all these religious exercises sharpen their tools before they
go to work, they should not hereby find their labors put back and
hindered, but profitably advanced, and better achieved, then if they undertake
them being blunt and dull; seeing by the sharpness of the instruments, they
shall soon redeem the time which is spent in whetting them. Neither would
this hinder our Christian thrift, nor our godly and lawful gains, but much
further and increase them; and repair all we lose, by that time which we
spend in Gods service with much advantage, through his powerful blessing upon
our labors, from which Fountain alone, all lawful prosperity springs and
flows. Whereas contrariwise, if neglecting these religious duties of Gods
service, we rest upon our own pains and providence, and as the Prophet
speaks, sacrifice unto our own nets, either God will curse and Hab. 1. 16.
cross our labors, and frustrate all our hopes, or if we thrive by them in
our worldly estates, all that we get by this means, shall be but like
Naboths Vineyard to Ahab, which rooted out both him and all his posterity; like
the Israelites Quayles, which came out of their nostrels; like Judas his sop,
with which the devil entered; or like cold water, given to gratify those who
are sick of a burning fever; seeing it but inflameth the heat of their
carnal concupiscence, and prepares matter for their everlasting burning in
the unquenchable flames of hell fire.

. Sect. 5 That the duties of our particular callings, must give place to the
general calling of Christianity.
Thirdly, let them know, that the duties of our particular callings, must give
place to the general calling of Christianity, when as both of them (as they
ordinarily may) will not stand together. For by these duties we draw near unto
God, and have communion with him, and no calling must call us from God, or
withdraw us from this blessed fellowship. They are the spiritual repast of our
souls, by which they get spiritual strength, and live the life of faith; and
therefore if we so highly prize the health and life of our bodies, that we
think no business so important, that should make us neglect the means of
preserving them, as eating, drinking, resting, sleeping, and such like; why
should we imagine any to be so weighty and necessary, as that for the
following of it, we should neglect the health and welfare of our precious
souls? Let us consider, that our callings were made for us, and not we for our
callings; for our good and benefit, and not for our hurt and ruin; for the
glorifying of God, and furthering of our salvation, and not for his dishonor,
by neglecting his service, and like snares to entangle us, that we cannot
proceed in such holy duties, as will make our calling and election sure. When
two things come together, which differ in their degrees of excellency and
necessity, we can easily resolve, in earthly things to give priority and
precedence unto that, which exceeds the other in worth and use. O would we
could be thus wise in this case; and seeing spiritual and heavenly things,
and employments about them, which tend to the everlasting salvation of our
souls, do as much exceed our earthly affairs, as heaven, earth, and those
things which are permanent and everlasting, such as are momentany and of short
continuance; I would we could be so wise for our own good, as to give those
duties which excel, the first place and pre-eminence. God has so graciously
respected our infirmity and weakness, that whereas he might have challenged
the greatest part of our time for his immediate service, as being above all
other employments most honorable and profitable, he is content that we
should consecrate unto him one day of seven, and one or two hours of every
day, out of four and twenty, or some small part of the Morning and Evening,
leaving unto us all the rest for our businesses and employments, which respect
the good of our bodies and estates. And being left so rich, will we yet
steal? will we incroach upon Gods right, who has dealt so bountifully with
us, and leave him nothing, that deserves all? Do we think it absurd to
neglect the duties of our particular callings all the week, under pretense of
spending our whole time in regious exercises, as hearing the Word, Prayer,
Meditation; and yet imagine it to be an excuse which will pass for current,
if neglecting all duties of Christianity, which are much more excellent and
necessary, we can say for our selves, that we are so wholly taken up with
worldly employments, that we can spare no time at all for holy duties? Yea,
do we think it unequal, that the duties of piety and Religion should
incroach a little upon that long time which is allotted to the duties of our
callings; and shall these spoil the other of their right, seeing they have
ordinarily such scant allowance, though they be in their nature much more
excellent, and to us more profitable and necessary? O let not the world and our
own carnal love of earthly vanities so much besot us; but let us as willingly
and cheerfully allow that short time required to religious duties, which
advance our spiritual estate, enrich us with saving graces, preserve our
souls in good plight and liking, further our salvation, and assure us of
heavenly and everlasting happiness; as we do a far longer time to worldly
employments about our corruptible bodies, and fickle estates, and the
compassing of such earthly things, as in comparison are vain and of no worth,
and in respect of their durablenesse and continuance, momentany and mutable.
And if at any time we be brought into such straights of time, that the one of
necessity must give place to the other, let those exercises which are of the
more noble nature, have the precedencie; and being much more excellent in
worth, and yet bounded with much narrower limits of time, let the better be
preferred before the worse, and that which is only poorer in time, borrow from
that which out of its plenty has more to lend. Wherein we have the poor Luke
2. 15.
shepherds for our examples and precedents, who neglected their sheep, to
seek and find out their Savior; In Mary, who spared time Luke 10. 40.
from her worldly, though weighty employments, that she might nourish her soul
with the bread of life; and in our Savior Christ himself, who being scanted
of time, for the public duties of his calling in preaching the Word and
working miracles; yet rather chose to borrow time from his rest and sleep,
then he would neglect the Religious duty of private prayer.

. Sect. 6 That we have time sufficient for Religious and civil duties, if it
be wisely husbanded.
Fourthly, let us consider, that we are not ordinarily thrust into such
straights, but that if we will, we may easily find some convenient time for
both sorts of duties; those which are religious belonging to Gods service, and
those which are civil, about our ordinary callings. Neither is there any
vocation so laborious, which if it be wisely followed, will not afford some
fit time for holy exercises. For tell me, thou who complaynest of thy little
leisure, and thy short time for thy great employments, if thou be so niggardly
thrifty in expending it, that thou have none to spare from the works of thy
calling to any other use or purpose; Do thou not borrow from them, so much
as would serve religious duties, not one hour in the four and twenty, to be
divided between thy morning and evening devotions? Do not thou, who
complaynest of this waste, in that time which is bestowed upon Christ and the
duties of Gods service, spend much more upon thine own lusts and sinful
pleasures, either in superfluous sleep, or complementall inuitations or
visitations, or in vain disports and unprofitable pastimes, or in fruitless,
if not carnal and corrupt communication and idle chat, or sitting longer at
thy meals then either health or profit, necessity or ciuility does require?
And is thine hap so hard, that thou art at liberty for all other purposes, and
art only pinched in the straits of time, when thou should spare a little for
Gods service, and the eternal welfare of thy precious soul? Surely if this
be thy case, thy state is miserable; for he that wants time for Gods service,
will also want it for his own salvation. He that can find no time for the
Lords work, shall never have time to receive his wages. He that can find no
leisure to enrich his soul with spiritual grace, shall thereby also lose the
opportunity of attayning unto heavenly glory. Do not then for shame abuse thy
self any longer with so vain an excuse, as though thou could find in
thine heart to be godly and religious, if thou could find any time for
religious exercises. For either thou must confess, that thou spendest no time
worse, or acknowledge thy folly in not preferring the better: either that the
duties of Gods service, which concern his glory, and thine own salvation, are
less excellent and necessary then any of thine ordinary employments, or else
that thou art as unwise as profane, in spending so thy whole time in those, as
that the other for want of time should be quite excluded. But rather learn
wisely to divide thy self and leisure between them, allotting constantly to
either their due portion, and thou shall find convenient time both for
religious and civil exercises; and when thy spiritual man, like Mary, has
chosen the better part, let not the flesh by its murmuring pull thee from it.
And if the duties of our callings importune us for a greater allowance of time,
that we may dispatch them, let us not incroach upon Gods right, and rob our
souls of that leisure and liberty which is required to spiritual exercises,
but let us rather borrow it from our flesh, which may better spare it; as
either from our superfluous sleep, or vain pastimes, or fruitless
discourses, or some other thing as worthless and unprofitable. And if we have
not yet time enough for our multitude of employments, our best course is to
imitate wise Pilots and Mariners, who will lighten their ship of some part of
her lading, that they may save the rest and best part of their goods from
danger of sinking. And like wise trauaylers, when we find our selves ready to
faint under our burden, let us cast away the refuse which may best be spared,
that we may bring our chief treasures and choysest jewels to our iourneyes
end. For if our Savior Christ would have us to forsake father and mother, wife
and children, yea even our own lives, rather then they should hinder us from
being his Disciples; If he Luke 14. 26.
would have us to pluck out our eyes, and cut off our right hands, if they
offend us, and hinder our journey to heavenly happiness, because it is better
that Matthew. 5. 29.
some of our members should perish, then that the whole body should be cast
into hell: then how much rather should we cast off some of our worldly
businesses, when they so encumber and turmoyle us, that they allow us no
leisure for spiritual exercises, nor to perform those religious duties, which
being neglected, deprive us of all assurance of eternal salvation?

. Sect. 7 That none are exempted by God from the duties of his service, under
pretense of any other business.
Finally, let those who excuse their neglect of Gods service, by pretending
their multitude of important businesses, which allow them no leisure for
Religious exercises, know and remember, that the Lord exempteth none, no, not
Kings themselves, from performing of them, whose employments notwithstanding
exceed those of other men, both in weight and number, as having not only the
charge and burden of their own families, but of the whole Church and
Commonwealth lying upon them. For even they are commanded to have with them
continually the Book of Gods Law, and to read and meditate Deuteronomy. 1. 17, 18,
19.
therein all the days of their life, that they may learn to fear the Lord
their God, and to keep all the Words of his Law and his Statutes, to do them.
Let them also consider the care of Gods servants in all ages, to yield unto him
this service and obedience. So that though their businesses and employments
have been never so manifold and weighty, yet when they have been most
encumbred, they ever found time sufficient for the Religious duties of Gods
service. Who ever had more, and more weighty employments then Joshua, both in
war and peace; as having not only a Kingdom to conquer, and many mighty and
warlike enemies to subdue, which was afterward to be divided amongst all the
tribes, but also a stiffenecked people under his government, unto whom, upon
all weighty occasions he was to administer justice? And yet, as the Lord
charged him, that the Book of the Law should Ios. 1. 8.
not depart out of his mouth, but that he should meditate therein day and
night, that he might observe to do according to all that was written therein;
so did he answerably yield his obedience, professing before all the people,
that though they should all neglect these duties, yet he and his household Ios.
24. 15.
would serve the Lord. Who could spare less time then holy David from his
important employments, both in war and peace? And yet all this could not
hinder him from Religious exercises, but upon all occasions he meditated in
Gods Law both day and night; Psalm. 88. 1. and 119. 55, 62. Psalm. 55. 17. and
119. 64.
and thrice in the day at least, did in a set and solemn manner call upon him;
besides his often prayers and praises upon special occasions. Who could have
less leisure then Daniel, that having the care of managing the chief affairs
of a mighty Monarchy imposed upon him, had all his actions so curiously scanned
by his many, mighty, and malicious enemies, that small negligences would have
been aggrauated against him as great faults? And yet notwithstanding all these
businesses of State, and those that concerned his own particular, he could
thrice a day sequester himself from Dan. 6. 10.
them all, and in a solemn manner deuote himself to the Religious duties of
Gods service. Yea, was there ever any man so seriously employed, in such
important affairs of his public calling, as our Savior Christ, so as he
could scarce spare any time from his preaching, working miracles, and such
divine exercises, for the releeuing of his body, and satisfying of his hunger?
And yet rather then he Luke 6. 12. and 21, 37.
would want time for his private prayers and devotions, he borrowed some from
his sleep. And therefore, unless we would not be numbered among the faithful,
let us follow their examples; if we would be esteemed Christ's Disciples, let
us imitate his practice, and not think our selves excused in the neglect of
Religious duties by our worldly businesses, which are incomparably less in
number, and lighter in value and true worth, then those wherein many of Gods
Saints and servants have been daily employed, from which notwithstanding they
borrowed time sufficient for spiritual exercises. The which admonition, as it
generally concerns all Christians of every calling; so especially Students
and Professors of Divinity, who are more apt then others, to excuse their
neglect of Christian practice in pious and Religious duties, because they are
so wholly taken up with their studies and speculations, that they have little or
no leisure for the other: The which they think not only justifiable, but also
commendable, because their minds are continually exercised in the theory and
speculation of religious objects, and in divine studies and contemplations. But
such are to know, that nothing more hinders the Religious practice of
Christianity, then when we spend our time, and suffer our selves to be wholly
taken up with ieiune speculations, and such studies as are only mental:
Because being exercises and labors of the mind and soul, they toil and tire
it, and so spend all the virtue and vigor of the powers and faculties
belonging unto it, and waste and exhaust the spirits, that no strength
remains for practique duties, nor any ability to perform any exercises of
Religion and devotion. Yea, above all other employments, they most alienate the
mind, and withdraw the heart and affection wholly from them. For whereas those
who are exercised about bodily labors, as riding, trauayling, working in their
arts and trades, plowing and such like, may often have leisure, without any
great distraction, to lift up their hearts unto God in short Prayers and
Meditations, in praising God, and singing Psalms, not for custom, but for
conscience sake, not to make themselves merry and pass the time with less
tediousness, but out of a pure desire to glorify God; or to entertain one
another with Religious discourses and holy conferences; those whose minds are
taken up with litterall studies and speculations, can no more intend the
spiritual exercises of Christian devotion, then they can at the same time
suppe and blow, because the powers of the mind being finite, cannot intend
many things at once. The which (as I think) is a chief cause, why the acutest
Schoolmen and greatest and most learned Doctors in high mysteries and curious
speculations, are oftentimes most cold in devotion, and most negligent in the
practice of holy duties, although they are able to teach them unto others.

CAP. XIX.
Their objection answered, who excuse their neglect of Religious duties, under
pretense that the times and places wherein they live, are full of corruption.

. Sect. 1 That the corruption of the times is a strong tentation to withdraw us
from godliness.
MAny other are the objections, which the flesh makes to hinder us from the
profession of piety, and the practice of it in the duties of a godly life. And
first, it is ready to object, that the times and places in which we live, and
the persons with whom we daily converse, are so corrupt and sinful, that it is
almost impossible we should live so strictly, as it were otherwise to be
wished, and not be tainted and infected with the common corruptions. For the
occasions of sinning are so ordinary and manifold, the prouocations pressed
upon us by wicked worldlings so strong and forcible, the evil examples which
are daily before our eyes, so hurtful and pernicious, as powerfully drawing us
to imitation; the neglect and contempt of sincerity and piety, and the practice
of it in the duties of a godly life, so usual and almost universal, that he
who resolves to take a different and contrary course, then that which is
embraced and applauded by the multitude, must seem to go alone, and to tire
and spend his strength in vain, by swimming against the stream, and rowing
(as it were) against the wind and tide: Yea, by living innocently, and
observing justice and righteousness in all his dealings, what shall he gain
hereby, but expose himself to become a prey, as the Prophet speaks? Besides,
Esa. 59. 15.
with what great discouragements shall the godly meet in such times and
places? How are they wondered at and pursued like Owls by little birds? How
shall they be crossed in all their preferments, though they deserve never so
well, because they do not follow the current of the times; and make conscience
of taking those corrupt courses, and using those unlawful means whereby
others rise? How shall they be maligned and reproched, opposed and persecuted,
if they refuse to run on with others into the same excess of riot? To which I
answer, that it cannot be denied, but that these are strong tentations, and
great discouragements which hinder many from the profession of Religion, and
the practice of it in Christian duties. The which our Savior himself
implies, where he says, that because in the latter times iniquity shall
abound, the love of many shall wax cold; Matthew. 24. 12.
And the Apostle likewise, where he calls the last days perilous times 2.
Tim. 3. 1.
in regard of those manifold and enormious sins which should then reign. For
as it is a difficult thing in a general plague, when men draw in daily the
infected air, to continue sound and healthy; so is it no less hard in the
common corruption of life and manners, to continue in our integrity and
holiness of conversation. But yet howsoever hypocrites and time-seruers
stumble and fall at this stone of offense, for want of Christian resolution,
and because they love the things of this present life, better then spiritual
grace or heavenly glory, yet the faithful must not be daunted and dismayed
with these discouragements, seeing our Savior has forewarned them to expect
no other, and so forearmed them against they come. Yea, he has provided
cordials of comfort against these cold qualmes of earthly calamities, and as he
has foretold the worlds rage and malice against us, so he has put courage
into us, by assuring us that he has overcome the World. As he has taught us
that the way is narrow, and the gate straight that leads to happiness, Ioh. 6.
33. Acts 14. 22.
and that by many tribulations we must enter into the Kingdom of heaven: so
he has done it not to this end, that we should strain courtesy, and pretend
excuses of difficulty, but to arm our resolution, and to make us strive to go
in this way, and to enter into this gate, because if we cannot deny the world
and our selves also, we cannot be his Disciples, nor ever reign with him,
unless we are also willing to suffer with 2. Tim. 2. 12.
him. Again, the Lord has given us express charge, that we should not regard
a multitude to follow them in evil; that we should save our selves Exodus 23.
1.
from this untoward generation; that when we see the unfruitful works of
darkness, Abs 2. 40.
we should not thereby take occasion to have fellowship with them, Ephe. 5. 11,
15.
but rather reprove them, that when our ways are laid full of the snares of
sin, we look the better to our footing, and walk so much the more
circumspectly, not using the euilnesse of the days, as an inducement unto
sin, but rather of redeeming the time, by doubling our Verse 16.
diligence in all Christian duties. And as those who live in infectious places,
do not (if they be wise) grow careless and desperate, but use rather their
best preservatives to keep out the pestilent air, and the best diet they can
to keep them in health: so must we use the like care for our souls in the
like case. Which if we neglect to do, we shall evidently declare, that what
show soever we make to the contrary, the times and we are well agreed, and
that there is not much less corruption within us, then we see without us, so
that unless God should change our hearts, we would not by the change of the
place and company be much changed.

. Sect. 2 That though it be hard to flesh and blood to live religiously in
corrupt times, yet it is possible, yea easy to the regenerate.
It is indeed, in respect of flesh and blood, an hard thing, and almost
impossible, to live as Lambs among Wolves, and to retain the sweetness of
innocence, when like that River which histories speak of, we run through a
salt sea of worldly wickedness: but what is impossible to nature, is possible
to grace, and much more to the God of all grace and goodness, who has
promised to assist and to establish us in every good work, when once we are
thoroughly resolved to undertake it. And this appears in the examples of the
faithful in all ages, who though they have necessarily lived amongst the
wicked, and thereby have bin endangered to all the former tentations and
encumbrances, that have not been drawn hereby to follow the times, and to
imitate the examples of wicked men, but have continued constant in their holy
profession, and religious practice of all the duties of piety and
righteousness. Thus Enoch walked with God, and Noah continued in his
uprightness, though almost all the world followed their own sinful lusts,
and lived in all wickedness and sensuality. So Lot in Sodom, Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob amongst the Canaanites, Joseph, David, Nehemiah, Obadiah, Mordecay,
Hester and Daniel, retained their sincerity and integrity, though they lived in
the wicked and profane courts of Pharaoh, Saul, Artaxerxes, Ahab, Ahasuerus and
Nebuchadnezar. And the Apostle sends saluations from the Saints that Phil. 4.
22.
lived in Nero his household, though like the master it abounded with all manner
of outrageous wickedness. And the reason is, because those who are regenerate,
have a new nature begun in them, which being spiritual and heavenly, cannot
suffer, or receive alteration from things which are of an inferior nature, no
more then spiritual substances can suffer of corporal, or heavenly bodies, of
those that are elementary. And though the flesh and part unregenerate lies
open to the tentations of the devil and the world, and may easily be allured to
any sin, yet so far forth as we are renewed, we resist them and cannot
sin, because it is contrary to this spiritual nature, and the Spirit of God
dwelling in us, which is the Author of it, according to that of the Apostle
John; Whosoever is borne of God, does not commit 1. John 3. 9.
sin, for his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he is
borne of God. And therefore as the fish retains his freshness in the salt
waters, and the hot baths their warmth, though they be enclosed with the cold
earth: so the faithful, so far forth as they are regenerate and renewed,
retain their piety and godliness of conversation, even when they be
encompassed on all sides with wicked worldlings, although their society and
examples are exceeding dangerous prouocations unto all sin and wickedness,
in respect of their flesh and unregenerate part; the one being like fire, the
other like gunpowder, or some combustible matter; especially when such
familiarity and society is not necessary, but of free choice, seeing it is just
with God, that those who love tentation should fall into it. Otherwise, the
faithful may retain their sincerity and piety Act. 2. 40.
in the midst of a froward generation; yea if necessity, and not their
voluntary election thrust them into such times and places, they may not only
go on in their Christian course, but even in the most evil days redeem the
time, by redoubling their diligence in all pious duties of Gods service, as the
Apostle implies. And this we see in the example of the holy Martyrs in the
times of persecution, who have redoubled their zeal and devotion in Gods
service, when none almost did bear them company, but all the world opposed
against them, and did hold in their view a quite 1. King. 18.
contrary course. Thus Elias his zeal was not cooled and quenched by the
idolatry and profaneness of those times, but much intended and increased. And
David, when he saw the evil examples of transgressors, was Psalm. 119. 139.
not drawn hereby to imitate them, but was the more consumed with his Act. 17.
16.
zeal, because they had forgotten Gods Law. Thus Paul's feruency of devotion
was more inflamed, when he saw the superstition of the Athenians. Ioh. 2. 17.
And thus was our Savior Christ consumed with zeal of his Fathers glory, when
as he saw his Temple profaned, and true Religion neglected and contemned.

. Sect. 4 A note of difference between true zeal and devotion, and that which
is false and hypocritical.
So that here we may have an undoubted and infallible sign, whereby we may
know whether our zeal and devotion be true and sincere, or false and
hypocritical; for if they be upright and in truth, they will not be lost in
evil places and times; if they be substantial, and (as it were a new nature)
and not mere shows and shadows, they will still retain it, and being of
superior virtue, will strive against and overcome these corruptions of the
times, which are contrary to them. Whereas if they yield unto them, and become
profane with the irreligious, neglecting all Christian duties, because they
live with those who do neglect them; it is hereby manifest, that there was
never any true change in their nature, but only some accidental alteration
for worldly respects. Though cold water be made never so hot, yet the heat of
it will soon be abated, when it is taken off the fire, and compassed about
with the cold air, and becomes more cold then it was at the first. And
though the Iron being heat in the Forge, is much more hot and scorching then
the fire in other combustible matter, yet being put into the water, or cast
upon the ground in the cold air, it becomes more cold then either of them;
because in this alteration there is no change of nature, but only of the
quality by outward accident. But contrariwise, the fire which is naturally hot,
and the Bath which is naturally warm, are not cooled by the cold winter air
which does incompasse them. Yea by this antiparistasis and enclosure, their
natural quality being kept in and better compacted, is intended and increased,
so that the fire which but moderately heateth in mild weather, scorcheth in
cold frosts: and the Bath, which is but temperately warm in summer, even
smoketh and scaldeth with heat in the cold winter, because this heat is
natural, and no aduentitious quality. And so the religion and devotion of
hypocrites, being no kindly heat proceeding from a renewed nature, is quickly
cooled in the company of the worldly and profane, and returns to more then
natural coldness; whereas the feruor of true Christian devotion is not abated,
but rather increased, when they live in corrupt times and sinful places,
because proceeding from a new nature, the inherent virtue and vigor of it,
uniting it self together to withstand all contrary opposition, is better
compacted and becomes more strong and preualent. So that those evil examples
which corrupt others, do but the better arm their resolution to withstand
them, and make them strive with more earnestness and devotion, to fly such
sins as they see committed, and to put in practice the contrary duties. And
as the Ostrich turns Iron it self, which would kill other creatures, into
wholesome nourishment; and as some beasts and birds do convert Spiders, and
other poisons into cordials and and restoratiues, which are deadly and
pernicious unto other living things of a different nature: so Gods children,
which are renewed and regenerate by his holy Spirit, are not only nourished
and strengthened with their ordinary food; as hearing the Word, prayer, holy
conferences and good company; but through Gods Spirit assisting them, are able
to turn even Iron ages into good nourishment, and the poison of evil examples
into cordials and preservatives, to strengthen them the more against common
corruptions and reigning sins. And therefore to excuse our neglect of
Christian duties belonging to a godly life, because we live in evil places and
times, what is it, but to proclaim that we are like unto them, and are not yet
regenerate by Gods Spirit, nor changed in our natures, but still remain in the
state of corruption, and consequently liable to death and condemnation?

CAP. XX.
Diverse other objections made by the flesh against a godly life, propounded and
answered.

. Sect. 1 That it is not enough to live harmlesly, unless we perform
religious duties.
ANother objection which the flesh makes against the strict performances of
Christian duties, is, that it is unnecessary, seeing if we be harmless, and
not guilty of heinous sins; as idolatry, blasphemy, murder, adultery,
drunkenness, theft, and such like, but live honestly amongst our neighbors,
doing no man any hurt, and in good fame and name in the world, the Lord will
accept of us, and bear with our infirmities, though we be not so precise as
many others, in performing the duties of a godly life, as they have been before
described. To which I answer, that the Lord will never accept of us as his
servants and children, if we do not at least desire, resolve and endeavor to
yield unto him entire obedience to his whole Law, as well by doing the duties
which he has commanded, as in leaving undone the vices which he has
forbidden; and that this obedience chiefly consists rather in performance of
that which is good, then in abstinence from that which is evil; and that if to
be harmless and innocent, were all that is required to Christianity, then
were we best Christians when we sit idly still, rather then when we are in
action, yea though we should sleep out our whole lives, because then we are
furthest off from doing any hurt. But let us consider that God requires
service at our hands, and he is counted but a sorry servant, who receiving
meat, drink, and wages, does content himself if he do his Master no harm,
though he never endeavor to do him any good. That the axe is set to Math. 3.
10.
the root of the tree, to cut it down, that it may be cast into the fire, if
it brings not forth good fruit, though it should bear none that is evil;
and the barren tree must be hewne down and cast out of the Lords Vineyard,
Luke 13. 7.
because it does but cumber the ground. That we must be, not only trees of
innocence, but trees of righteousness, if we be of Gods planting, which Esa.
61. 3. Luke 8. 44.
are distinguished from evil trees destinated to the fire, not by bearing
nothing, but by bringing forth good fruit. Let us remember, that the Figtree
was cursed by our Savior, not because it had upon it figs, like those in one
of Ieremies baskets, which were so very naughty, that they could Ier. 24. 2.
Math. 21. 19.
not be eaten they were so bad; but because it had none at all, when Christ
purposely came to find some upon it. That the unprofitable servant is by Math.
25. 30.
his Lord reputed an evil servant, and adjudged to punishment, for not
increasing his Masters Talent, though he had not misspent it in riotous
living. And that the sentence of condemnation shall pass against those, Mat.
25. 41, 42.
who neglect to do the works of mercy to Christ's poor members, though they
never oppressed or wronged them. Finally, let us know that they deceive
themselves, who dream of a mean between not doing good, and doing evil; for
if we be not on Gods side, we are against him; if Luke 11. 23.
we gather not with Christ, we scatter abroad: neither can we sooner cease to
Esa. 1. 16.
do evil, but presently we begin to do that which is good.

. Sect. 2 That it is not sufficient to serve God in some things, and at some
times.
Again, it is ready to object, that if it be not sufficient to abstain from
evil, and from gross and heinous sins, but that we must also perform the
contrary duties, yet at least it is not necessary that we should be tied so
strictly unto all duties of holiness and righteousness which God requires;
or if to all, yet not at all times, but that it is enough, if we perform some
good duties, either toward God, or our neighbors, though we neglect others,
and that we be at some times zealous and devout, though at other times we
take our liberty, and ease our selves of this hard task, by taking our
pleasures, seeing as long as we live in this world we cannot be Saints, but
must live like other men, as being alike frail and full of infirmities. To
which I answer, that even in this life, we must be of the communion of Saints,
if ever we mean to communicate with them in glory and happiness; and
howsoever corruption of nature and humane frailties hang upon us, yet we must
not willingly nourish them, and cheerfully obey the flesh in the lusts thereof;
for if we live after the flesh, we shall Romans 8. 13.
dye; but we must labor through the Spirit, to mortify the deeds of this body
of sin, that we may live, as the Apostle teaches us. And although we cannot,
by reason of the law of the members, and the sin that hangs upon us, yield
unto the Law that perfect and strict obedience which it requires: for in many
things we sin all; yet if ever we would have any Iam. 3. 2.
sound comfort in the gracious promises of the Gospel, we must yield unto God
the obedience of sons, which consists in an earnest desire, full
resolution, and diligent endeavor to please our heavenly Father, by framing our
lives according unto his will in all things, and at all times. We must put off
(as much as in us lies) the whole old man, with all his corrupt Ephesians. 4. 22,
23, 24
and deceitful lusts; and being renewed in the spirit of our minds, we must
put on the New man, which after God, is created both in righteousness and true
holiness. We must have with David, respect unto all Gods Commandments, Psalm.
119. 6, 20.
and lead our lives both in godliness and in honesty. For though we be 1.
Tim. 2. 2.
never so devout and zealous in religious duties, yet if we do not join with
them the duties of charity and righteousness, God will reject us, as being no
better then hypocrites; according to that of the Prophet; I hate, Amos 5. 21,
22, 24.
I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
Though ye offer me burnt offerings, and meat offerings, I will not accept
them, etc. But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a
mighty stream. So the Lord professes, that he would not be pleased with
thousands of Rams, Micah 6. 6, 8.
or ten thousand rivers of oil, no, not with the first borne of their body,
for the sin of their souls, unless also they would do justly, and love
mercy. And though we be never so just in our dealings, and so bountiful, that
we could be content to give all our goods to the poor, yet if it be not
joined 1. Cor. 13. 3.
with piety and charity, and do not proceed from saving knowledge and a lively
faith, true obedience, and a good conscience, it is all worth nothing, and no
better then glorious sins in Gods sight. And therefore if we would have our
service accepted, we must, according to the Apostles example, live both holily
toward God, and justly and unblameably toward 1. These. 2. 10.
men. If we would approve our selves to be the redeemed of the Lord, we Luke
1. 74, 75.
must serve him in holiness and righteousness before him; and that not by
fits and flashes, but all the days of our lives. But of these points I have
spoken before at large, when I entreated of integrity and constancy, the
inseparable properties of a godly life; and therefore refer the Reader to
that place.

. Sect. 3 Their objection answered, who pretend that they have outgone many
others.
Furthermore, being deluded with the flesh, we are ready to object, that though
we have not attained to that perfection which were to be desired, yet we are
forward enough in the course of Christianity, seeing we have outrunne many
others, although there are many also who are far before us. For answer
whereof we are to know, that he who thinks that he has proceeded far
enough, has not as yet set one foot forward in the Christian Race; and though
we had made some good progress, yet if we now stand still, and do not
continue running till we come to the goal, we shall never obtain the
Garland. And therefore, imitating runners who strive for a prize, we must not
look so much to those whom we have outrunne, as to those that are still
before us, that we may overtake, and get before them to the mark; seeing if
we stand still, and rest in that which we have already done, he that is
furthest behind, and yet continues running, will soon overtake us, and get
the Garland from us. We must not please our selves in our good proceedings, and
run no more; for in the ways of Christianity, he that goes not forward,
goes backward; and when we cease to be better, we begin to be worse; neither
must we look how far we have proceeded, but how much of the Race remains
still vnrunne, and how far we are yet from the Goal of perfection: And with
the Apostle, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching Phil. 3.
13, 14.
forth to those things which are before, we must press toward the mark, for
the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. He that is ambitious, is
not pleased with his present honors, because he is preferred before many
others: but if there be yet any above him, he is not quiet in his mind, till
he have matched or exceeded him. O then, why should we be so sluggish about
spiritual and heavenly preferments, which are incomparably of greater worth
and excellency? why should we not be as religiously ambitious in aspiring,
even unto the highest degrees of heavenly glory and happiness, which is
permanent and everlasting; as in striving after worldly honors, which are
contemptible in their worth, and momentany and mutable in their continuance;
seeing man that is in honor, Psalm. 49. 12.
abides not, but is like the beasts that perish, as the Psalmist speaks?

. Sect. 4 Their objection answered, who affirm that Ministers only are bound
to the strict performance of religious duties.
Moreover, the flesh is ready to object, that howsoever this strict performance
of Christian duties be required of Ministers, who have more knowledge, and many
helps which many others want, and also fewer lets and distractions, having by
reason of their small employments about worldly things, little else to do,
then to attend unto spiritual exercises; yet those who are of the common sort
of people, as Tradesmen, Artificers, and Husbandmen, cannot by the same reason
be so strictly tied to religious duties, seeing they are simple, ignorant, and
unlettered, and have much more business and employment in the works of their
calling. To which I answer first, that though Ministers be tied to exercise
themselves, above all others, in those personal duties which belong to their
special calling, as reading, Meditation, and study in the Scriptures, and
other religious duties, which are more proper and peculiar unto them: yet the
general duties of Christianity, as Prayer, Thanksgiving, receiving the
Sacrament, watchfulness, and such like, do lie out in common, both to them
and all other men that are true members of the Church. In regard whereof, there
is no distinction or difference between one and another, seeing our Savior
Christ having with his precious Blood washed us all from our sins, has made
us all alike, Kings and Priests, unto God and his Father. Neither Apoc. 1. 5, 6.
has he selected some only from among the rest, unto whom he has
appropriated the religious duties of Gods service, but has made us altogether
indifferently, a chosen generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, a 1.
Pet. 2. 9, 5.
peculiar people, that we should show forth the praises of him, who has
called us out of darkness into this marvelous light, and to offer up
spiritual sacrifice, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. And howsoever the
public performance of these religious duties, does more peculiarly belong
unto them, in respect of their public calling in the Church, yet private
devotions, and the duties of Gods service and a godly life, belong
indifferently unto all, without exception or exemption of any person. Neither
are the admonitions and exhortations unto these duties in the Scriptures
directed only unto Ministers, as that they should keep the spiritual watch,
examine themselves, put on the Christian Armor, pray continually, and in all
things give thanks, but unto the whole Church and people of God. Secondly,
howsoever Gods Ministers ought to shine as lights in the world, to be good
examples unto their flocks, over which God has made them overseers, to be
guides unto the rest of the faithful, that they may lead and direct them in
the ways of godliness, and to be Captains of the Lords Armies, to go out
and in before them; yet it is to this end, that the people should walk in
their light, and no longer sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, that
they should imitate their holy example, and propound them as good patterns and
precedents for their imitation; that they should follow their guides, be
directed by them, and tread in their footsteps, so long as they go before them
in the ways of truth and godliness; and finally, that they should march after
their spiritual Captains and Leaders, and join with them, in fighting
against the enemies of their salvation. For it were as good for them to want
these burning and shining Lights, if they sit idly still and do nothing; to
have no such examples, if they never imitate them; to be without guides, if
they will not follow them; and these Captains and Leaders, if they let them
sustain alone the brunt of the battle, and not like faithful Soldiers,
join common forces against common enemies. Thirdly, I answer, that if the
special employments of our particular callings, might make us dispense with
the general duties of Christianity and Gods service; the Ministers calling, if
we faithfully walk in it, and diligently perform our duties, has as much
business and employment, and not many fewer or less distractions from private
religious duties, then those which are of other professions: As besides his
private studies, Reading and Meditation, unto 1. Tim. 4. 15, 16.
which he must seriously attend, that he may prepare and fit himself for the
public service of the Church, and the government of his own family, he must
also watch over his flock, visit the sick, strengthen the weak, comfort the
afflicted, privately admonish those that err and go out of the way, exhort
those that are sluggish, and rebuke those who wilfully offend, and continue in
their sins. All which, if they be performed with that conscionable care which
they ought, will leave them as little time as other men for their private
devotions, although under this pretense they must not be neglected. Finally,
though more be required of Gods Ministers in respect of degree, seeing where
the Lord bestows a greater measure of his gifts and graces, there he
requires that they should in a greater measure bring forth the fruits of holy
obedience; yet the same duties are to be performed of all Christians,
according to the proportion of their grace received, and both alike are tied to
yield unto God, their common Master, religious service, although those who
exceed in knowledge and other gifts, are bound to do them in more perfection.
And howsoever a greater measure of knowledge is required of the Minister then
the people, because his lips must preserve Mal. 2. 7.
it, as in a common Treasury, that they may have recourse unto him for the
supplying of their wants; yet as all men must live by their own Habac. 2. 5.
faith, so also they must walk by their own sight, and have such a measure of
knowledge and illumination of the Spirit, as may be sufficient to direct them
in all Christian and religious duties. For their souls being alike precious
unto them, as theirs are who are called to the Ministry, and the way and
means the same which bring both to eternal life and happiness, it behooves
them both alike to labor after this common salvation, in the performance of
the same Religious duties, which are also required of both as common unto them.

. Sect. 5 Their objection answered, who pretend the want of means.
But here again they are ready to object, that if they had such means of
knowledge, and other saving graces as others enjoy, and such helps and
furtherances in the duties of a godly life as many abound with; then with some
reason they were to be blamed, if they did neglect them. But alas, they are
under some ignorant or idle minister, which cannot or will not instruct them, or
such unconscionable guides, as shine not in the light of a good example, but
rather lay stumbling stones of offense before them, by their enormious and
scandalous lives, and neglecting all good duties themselves, do dis-hearten
and discountenance them who are careful to perform them, rather then any
ways encourage them, either by their words or actions. In which regard they
think that they may be excused, if they be not so zealous and forward in
performing the Religious duties of Gods service and of a godly life. To which I
have in part before answered, namely, that if this be our case, first we must
use all good means to move them to their duty, and especially that we power
forth our hearty prayers unto God for our Pastors and Ministers, entreating
him that he will inlighten their minds, and sanctify their hearts and
affections, and so make them as able, as willing to perform those high and
holy duties unto which they are called. And secondly, if the courses which they
still hold, afford us no better hopes; then accounting the glorifying of God
in the eternal salvation of our souls, that one thing necessary, which is
far to be preferred before all earthly commodities, we must labor to place
our selves under such Pastors and Teachers, as will carefully and conscionably
break unto us the bread of life, and shine before us, not only in the light
of doctrine, but also of an holy life and conversation. In the mean time,
these outward wants must not make us neglect the Religious duties of a godly
life; or if they do, they cannot be sufficient to excuse our negligence, which
does not so much proceed from the want of external means, or those
discouragements which are without us, as from the secret corruptions that lie
lurking within us. Which if they were thoroughly mortified, and our hearts
inflamed with fervent zeal and true devotion, we would not be moved by these
public defects and discouragements, to neglect the private duties of Gods
service; yea, rather we would use them with more diligence, as being, through
want of the other, pressed upon us with a greater necessity. For he that has
no friends or parents to look unto him, or such as greatly care not whether he
feed upon wholesome food, or famish for want of bread, finds that he is the
more bound hereby to provide for himself. Whereas contrariwise, these
corruptions which make us neglect the duties of Gods service, still remaining
in us, and quenching in our hearts all zeal and devotion, would make us alike
cold and negligent in our private exercises of Religion, although the public
means which we enjoyed were never so excellent. Of the former, we have an
example in David, who when he lived in the barren wilderness, had his soul so
watered with the dew of Gods grace, that it never brought forth more and better
fruits of holiness; and so inflamed with the fire of Gods Spirit, that he was
never more devout in religious exercises, nor more zealous in the private
duties of Gods service, though being banished and exiled from the Tabernacle
and the public place of Gods worship, he was withal deprived of the ordinary
means of his salvation. And the like we see in the example of the persecuted
Martyrs, who never were more fervent in their private devotions, then when they
durst not show themselves in open assemblies, but hid their heads from their
pursuers in secret corners and solitary places. And of many others in our own
times, who being necessarily debarred of all public helps, and
discountenanced and discouraged in their godly courses, by those which should
be their guides and leaders, yet being inwardly furnished with saving graces,
do outwardly exercise them in all religious and holy duties. For howsoever the
public Ministry is the ordinary means to begin, as also to preserve and
increase Gods graces in us, and to give unto us not only birth and spiritual
life, but also growth and strength, whereby we are enabled unto all duties of
a godly life; so that whosoever neglect it, when they may have it, can never
look to thrive in grace, or to have any ability to serve God in any acceptable
manner, because they despise his holy Ordinances, fancying unto themselves alife
which needs no nourishment; yet we must hold it to be but a means and
instrument, whereby God, who is the supreme cause and chief Agent, is pleased
ordinarily to work, but yet when he depriueth us of them, can effect his own
good work of grace and sanctification, either without them, or when they are
weak and insufficient, as well as with them, and when they are most excellent
and in greatest plenty. Of the other we have an example in Judas, who being
full of inward corruption, could not thrive, no, not under Christ's own
Ministry, and Demas, Ananias and Sapphira under the Ministry of the Apostles,
who performed no acceptable service unto God by all these helps, because their
hearts were not sincere and upright, but still remained carnal and defiled with
worldly love. Yea, we may have experience of it in many vnthriuing Christians
of these times, who though they live under a most powerful and excellent
Ministry, and abound in all the spiritual means of grace and salvation, yet
remain as worldly and carnal, as auerse and backward unto all duties of a
godly life, as those who are utterly destitute of them.

. Sect. 6 Their objection answered, who pretend, that it is not safe to be more
forward then other men.
Finally, men misled by carnal corruption, are ready to excuse themselves,
for not entering into the course of Christianity, though their judgments are
convinced of this truth, that it is above all others most excellent, profitable
and necessary, by obiecting, that it is neither good nor safe to make greater
profession then other men, or to be more strict in our lives, then ordinary
Christians; because we are not sure that we shall be able to hold out in our
sincerity, and holy practice, and if we should relapse, our latter end would be
worse then our beginning. Neither can we tell, in respect of humane frailty,
whether we may not fall into some grievous and heinous sins, or at least such
as are contrary to our strict profession; which if we do, our faults will be
more observed in us, though they would be little regarded in ordinary men, and
more bitterly censured and condemned; yea, we our selves shall be a wonderment
to all that know us, and both shame our selves and our profession. To which I
answer, first, that none can make any greater profession of strict performing
all Christian duties, then that which we all make at our Baptism, when we
enter into covenant with God, that we will renounce the service of sin and
Satan, the world and our own sinful lusts, and betake our selves wholly to the
service of God, in all duties of holiness and righteousness. Which if we do
not all still make, and renew upon all occasions, what do we but disgrace our
selves, by casting off our Lords liuerie, denying and renouncing our promise
and profession, and returning into the ancient servitude of sin and Satan?
Yea, what do we else but daily play the hypocrites, when as praying that we
may do Gods will in earth, in that purity and perfection, which the Saints and
holy Angels do it in heaven, and that we may serve God in holiness,
righteousness and sobriety all the days of our lives, we are notwithstanding so
far from desiring, or going about it, that we are ashamed to profess that we
have any such meaning? Secondly, I answer, that we are all bound, one as well
as another, to make this profession of holiness and sincerity; neither is it
left unto us as a thing arbitrarie, and at our own choice, but expressly
commanded and enjoined, that we should glorify God, by professing our selves
his servants, and living according to this profession, which none refuses to
do, but such as are destitute of a lively Faith, whereby we are assured, that
God is in Christ our gracious Lord and Father, and we his servants and people;
for as with the Romans 10. 10.
heart man believes unto righteousness, so with the mouth confession is made
unto salvation; According to that of David, I believed, therefore have I Psalm.
116. 10.
spoken. Thirdly, I answer, that fear of falling away, or of being overtaken
with some gross sins, must not hinder our profession and practice of piety;
but rather this profession and practice must therefore be undertaken, that we
may hereby be moved more carefully to use all good means of perseuering in all
grace and godliness, and to observe our ways with greater diligence, and make
straight steps unto our feet, that we do not slip, nor hault, nor turn
aside out of the way. And if we with these minds take upon us the profession
of Christianity, and endeavor to bring forth the fruits of it in our holy
practice, the Lord, who has begun this good work in us, will also finish
it; he will uphold us that we shall not greatly fall; or if we do, yet he
will not suffer us to lie still and perish, but will so assist us with his
grace and holy Spirit, that we shall rise again by unfeigned repentance. In
the mean time no man has just cause to wonder, if we fall through
infirmity, though it be into some greater sins then many commit, who make
little or no profession at all; if either he consider humane frailty common to
all, the relics of corruption remaining still in us after regeneration, and
the combat which thence arises between the flesh and the Spirit; that,
sometime prevailing, and this again gets the upper hand; the malice of the
devil, who most fiercely assaulteth with his tentations, those who have
renounced his service, and in whom the Image of God most clearly shines; or
else the examples of the Saints in former ages, who have been subject to like
frailties and infirmities, though they were just and upright in all their
ways, and men in their ordinary and common carriage, according to Gods own
heart, and have been sometimes, though rarely, overtaken with gross sins, as
Noah, Lot, David, Peter and the rest. And therefore it is no marvel if we,
likewise have our slips and falls, yea rather, it is a great wonder, if we, who
come so far short of them in grace and obedience, should stand in such slippery
places where they have fallen, and be supported so with Gods grace and holy
Spirit, notwithstanding our greater frailty and weakness, that we may
challenge all the world to accuse us of any gross sin. If indeed he who has
professed himself the child of God, and approved himself to be so, by his
sonne-like obedience, should, like the wicked, make sin his way and trade,
defend it when he is reproved, and continue in it without repentance, this were
a matter of deserved wonder; but not so, if walking constantly in the ways of
Godliness, they sometimes slip and get a fall, especially when they plainly
show by their sorrow ensuing, that they are not pleased with their sin, but
having done the evil which they hated in the inner Romans 7. 20, 22.
man, do not continue in it, but rise out of it by unfeigned repentance. But
suppose for all this, that professing sincerity, we shall be wondered at of the
world, if we hap to fall into any open and scandalous sin; It is not better
that with the godly we should be wondered at for doing evil, then that with
wicked men our good actions should cause wonder. For though it be our shame to
sin, and thereby to expose our selves to wonderment; yet this wondering it
self, is rather a grace then a blemish unto us; seeing men wonder not at
matters common and ordinary, but at such only as rarely happen. We wonder not
at profane rakehells, when they break their word, lie, swear and deal
unjustly; but to see one that is reputed just and honest to do thus at any
time, does make all that know them, to marvel at it; and the reason is,
because it is common and ordinary in the one, but very rare and a thing seldom
or never before seen in the other. And yet there is no man that is not
graceless and desperate, who would not rather choose so to carry himself, as
that he may be reputed an honest man, though his faults are more observed and
wondered at, then so as to gain the reproach of a wicked person, although their
faults being ordinary, are little observed and less maruailed at. Though every
man wonder, when he sees a botching piece of work to come out of the hands of
a cunning and curious artizan, and maruaileth nothing at all, if he should see
such an one or worse come out of the hands of a bungler; yet every one desires
rather to be a skillful workman, and to be so reputed, then a bungling botcher.
And though a spot be sooner seen in a beautiful face, then in one foul and
deformed; or a blot and stain in a fine piece of Lawne or Cambricke, then in
some common rag, or coorse canuas; and a faithful servant be more wondered at,
that is taken halting in some deceitful action, then when a false fellow does
so, that makes deceitful dealing his usual trade; yet every one prefers
beauty with some blemish, before foulness and deformity; fine cloth, though a
little spotted, before filthy and worne-out rags; and a faithful servant with
his seldom slips, before a dishonest fellow, whose worst dealing rayseth no
wonder, because being his ordinary custom, no man that knows him, expects
better fruits from such a bramble: And so, though our profession of godliness,
and endeavor to bring forth ordinary fruits of it in an holy conversation,
should more expose us to be wondered at, when we fall through humane frailty and
infirmity; yet this should not hinder us from entering into this Christian
course, seeing it is a means to make us stand more upon our credit, to
restrain us from all sin, whereby we might blemish it, and to keep with David
a careful watch over our selves, that our hearts being found Psalm. 119. 18.
in Gods Statutes, there may be no cause why we should be ashamed. And
howsoever, when we are overtaken, our faults are more observed and maruailed
at, yet though our sin shameth us, this wonder at it, is rather our praise
and commendation. And when we are at the worst, yet our state is better, and
we preferred in Gods estimate and in the opinion of all that fear him, before
those who never took upon them the profession of piety, nor cared to bring
forth any fruits of it in a godly life, though their faults are little observed
or regarded, and not (like the others) matter of table-talke, because no man
thinks them to be any news.

. Sect. 7 That the duties of a godly life must not be delayed.
The last objection which the flesh makes, is, that it is yet too soon to
enter into this strict course of a godly life; seeing howsoever it may be
necessary in due time and place to do it, yet the present time of our youth
and strength is not fit for such austerity. It cannot be denied, but that God
must be religiously served, but all in good time; we have the day before us,
and shall have leisure enough to serve our selves and God too. After we have
better settled our worldly estate, and attained unto such a proportion of
wealth for our own maintenance and those that belong unto us, or have
delighted our selves with such and such pleasures, then it will be more
seasonable to sequester our selves from the world, and to betake our selves
unto our devotions. And thus, when the flesh cannot any longer hide from us the
profit and necessity of leading a godly life, then it moves us to make
delays, and to poast it off from time to time, till at last we be prevented
with unexpected death, and so perish in our sins. Of this Augustine
propounds himself as an example: As no man (says he) is so sluggish, that
will in his judgment prefer perpetual sleeping before waking, and going
about his business, but yet when sloth has seized upon his members, deferreth
to shake it off, though it be high time that he should rise: so I thought it
better to yield my self rather to thy love, then mine own lust; but that
pleased and overcame me; this liked me and held me captive. For I had nothing
to answer, when thou said unto me; Arise, thou that sleep, Ephe. 5. 14.
and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light, being convinced
with the truth, but only the words of the slothful and sleepie: Anon, behold
Modo, ecce modo, sine paululum. Sed modo and modo non habebant modum, and sine
paululum in longum ibat. Confess. lib. 8. cap. 5.
by and by, let me alone yet a little. But a little and a little exceeded all
measure: and, Let me alone a little, grew out to a great length. For the
answering of which objection, let us know, that the service of God in the
duties of a godly life, is a matter of greatest moment, profit and necessity;
and therefore that it is great folly to put it off with delays, seeing all our
life is too little for it. For if God is so bountiful and rich in mercy, that
he is content to reward our temporary and momentany service, with the eternal
wages of heavenly happiness, how ungrateful are we, if we think that the
short time of our lives is too much to be spent in his service, who will reward
our soon ending works, with everlasting wages? Let us consider, that seeing
the service of God is of greatest worth and excellency, most profitable and
only necessary; it is therefore ridiculous folly, not to give it precedence
and the first place, but to prefer before it every base trifle; yea, things
not only of no value, but also such as are hurtful and pernicious, as the
service of Satan, the world, and our own lusts, for the contemptible wages of
earthly vanities. Let us remember, that we have only the time present for our
employment: for the time past is irreuocable, and the time to come uncertain,
which if we promise unto our selves, we incroach upon Gods right, seeing he
has given unto us no promise of it, and sin presumptuously, by taking upon
us to dispose of that which is only in the hand of God. That now is the
acceptable time and day 2. Cor. 6. 2.
of salvation, and we do not know whether it will last till to morrow, which
if it be once past, can never be recovered. And therefore whilst it is called
Psalm. 95. 7, 8.
to day, let us hearken unto his voice, calling us to repentance, and inuiting
us to serve him, and not harden our hearts: Let us seek the Lord whilst he
Esa. 55. 6, 7.
may be found, and call upon him whilst he is nigh; for if he depart in
displeasure, we may long seek him with the Spouse in the Canticles, ere we
Cant. 5.
shall find him. Let us consider, that the leading of a godly life is
necessary to salvation, for that time which remains after our calling. For as
the Apostle says, Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. And what Heb.
12. 14.
madness then is it, to cast a thing of such moment upon all uncertainties?
for it is uncertain whether thou shall live one day longer; if thou live,
uncertain whether thou shall have the means whereby thou may be enabled
for Gods service, and uncertain if thou have them, whether God will give thee
will to use them, or power to profit by them, for the obtaining of spiritual
life and strength, whereby thou may be enabled to serve him, seeing he may
justly refuse to be served by thee in thy decrepit age, when thou have no
strength to serve the devil, the world, and thine own lusts, because thou
have refused to do it in thy flourishing youth, and chief strength. To which
purpose one says, When the wicked man will, he cannot, because when he could,
he Cum vult improbu^ homo, non potest, quia qua^do potuit noluit. Ideo per
malum velle perd^dit honum posse. August. in Epist. Johan. Sermon. 36. Chrysan 2
Cor. 11. Homil. 22.
would not: and so by an ill will, he loses the power of well-doing. But thou will object, as he of whom Chrysostom speaks; That God has given many this
privilege, to confess him in old age. To which I answer with him: What then?
will he therefore give it thee? Thou will say, Perhaps he will? Why say thou
perhaps? Does it but sometime happen? Consider, that the matter in
deliberation, is the salvation or damnation of thy soul. And therefore think
with thy self of the contrary, and say; But what if God will not give it?
Do thou yet say, And what if he will give it? God grant he may. But sure for
all that, to lay hold on the time present, is both more certain and more
profitable. For if thou now beginnest, thou art sure to get all that thou
desire, whether God grant or deny the former privilege; whereas if thou
delayest, even for this, oftentimes thou shall not receive it. When thou go
to the wars, thou do not say, There is no need for me to dispose of mine
estate; perhaps I shall return. Neither do thou say, when thou do
deliberate of marriage; I will choose a poor wife; for many in so doing have
grown rich beyond all hope. And going about to build an house, thou do not
say, I will lay a rotten foundation; for many houses have stood, though their
foundations have been weak. And yet when thou have to deal about the
salvation of thy soul, thou layest hold on things more rotten, and put all
upon uncertainties, saying, It often happens, it sometimes comes to pass.
It is indeed uncertain, will thou say, but I trust to Gods mercy, for he is
gracious. This I know and acknowledge; but know this also, that this merciful
God has suddenly taken away, when they least expected it, such as thou art,
who have posted him off with vain delays. And what though much time be
granted thee? how art thou sure that thou shall amend and become better, etc?
For how do thou think that God will then assist thee, seeing thou have so
often refused his help, when he has graciously offered it? or how can thou
hope of any ability without it? Now thou can not walk in the ways of
godliness; and how will thou be able to do it hereafter, when thou art more
inthralled unto Satan, more loaded with the intolerable weight of thy
multiplied sins, more clogged and hampered, fettered and hindered with the
strong chains of thy corruptions, which are grown habitual, and have doubled
their force with long custom? Finally, when as thou art more impotent to shake
them off, and mortify them, by reason of the infirmities of old age? Yet say,
thou could then serve God in all Christian duties: yet how much time in the
mean while have thou misspent, not only without gain, but to thy
incomparable loss, which if it had been employed in Gods service, would have
added much inestimable riches to the everlasting recompense of heavenly
rewards? And therefore when as God requires at our hands that present service
which is due unto him, let us not put him off, like banquerupts and ill
debtors, with words and promises, that we will pay all hereafter, seeing the
longer we live, the more we spend on the stock, and less able we shall be to
make satisfaction. But seeing he requires present and constant service, not
because he needs it, but that he may take occasion thereby of crowning our
works with richer rewards; let us not be so great enemies to our own
preferment, as by deferring and scanting our work, to cause the Lord to abate
our wages; but laying aside every weight, Heb. 12. 1.
and the sin which does so easily beset us, let us (as the Apostle exhorts)
run with patience the race which is set before us.

. Sect. 8 The Conclusion of the whole Treatise.
And thus have I, through the gracious assistance of Gods holy Spirit, finished
this long work, for which his blessed Name be praised and magnified; And have
not only described the godly life, in all the parts and branches thereof, and
the special duties required unto it, but also the means both public and
private, whereby we may be enabled, and the arguments and reasons whereby we
may be moved and persuaded to perform them, and likewise have showed the
greatest and most usual lets and impediments, whereby men are commonly hindered
from entering into, and proceeding in the ways of godliness, and how also we
may remove and overcome them. And now nothing remains, but that I entreat
thee (Christian Reader) by the mercies of God, and as thou tendrest his glory,
and the eternal salvation of thine own soul, that thou will resolve and
endeavor to walk in this alone way that leads to heavenly happiness, now
that he has so plainly discovered it unto thee. For much better were it for
thee never to have known the way of truth and godliness, then after thou
know it, not to walk in it; seeing the servant Luke 12. 47.
that knows his Masters will, and does it not, shall be beaten with many
stripes. Heretofore thy ignorance might somewhat extenuate thy sin, and
neglect of Gods service in the duties of a godly life, and mitigate also thy
punishment, because thou might pretend thy willingness to walk in this
way, but that thou did want a guide to go before thee: But now this
pretense is taken away, and thou quite left without all excuse. For what can
the Lord by his Ministers do more for the salvation of thy precious soul,
then to show thee the way that leads to eternal blessedness, and to teach
thee how thou may walk in it; to make known unto thee what thou must do
that thou may be saved, and the means also whereby Act. 2. 37.
thou may be enabled to do it? to exhort and persuade thee, by effectual
reasons, to use these means, that so thou may walk in this way, and to
teach thee how to remove all those impediments which might otherwise hinder
and discourage thee in thy course? O let not therefore his so great grace be
unto thee, not only in vain, but also to thy loss. Let nor, O let not these
my poor, yet painful labors, which I have undertaken with cheerfulness,
proceeded in with comfort, and finished with joy, that I might glorify God in
thy salvation, rise up as a witness against thee at that great Day, because
thou have only read them, and after cast them into some corner, without
further use. If thou know these things, Luke 11. 28. Joh. 13. 17.
blessed art thou, if thou do them. And happy, yea thrice happy shall I
think my self, if being furthered by my poor means in the ways of
salvation, thou may be my crown and my rejoicing. Frustrate not (I beseech
thee) the maine end of my painful labors, so much desired, so often and
earnestly begged, and defraud me not of my hope and joy, and therewith thy
self also of thine own salvation. It is not my writing, nor thy reading, that
can save our souls in that great Day of the Lord, but the holy practice of
those duties which I teach, and thou learnest, in the whole course of our lives
and conuersations, which because we are unable to perform in our own
strength, but it is the Lord only which inableth Phil. 2. 13.
us, both to will, and to do, let us (I entreat thee) pray one for another,
desiring of the Lord, that we may not only be filled with the knowledge of
Col. 1. 10, 11.
his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, but also that in this
light we may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in
every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all
might, according 2. Tim. 3. 17.
to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with ioyfulnesse.
And that we may not only be perfect, and thoroughly furnished unto all good
works; but also that we may be steadfast, immovable, and always abounding 1.
Cor. 5. 58. Prou. 16. 9. and 20. 24. Ier. 20. 23.
in the work of the Lord, for as much as we know, that our labor is not vain
in the Lord. But man knows not his own ways, neither is it in man that
walks, to direct his steps; and how much less is he able in his own
strength to be a guide unto others, or by his most powerful persuasions to
move them to accompany him in the ways of godliness? O thou therefore who art
the Author of light and life, and the rich Fountain of all grace and glory,
as thou have graciously enlightened my mind with the knowledge of thy will, and
enabled me also to reveal it unto others, so inflame mine heart with the
beauty and brightness of it, that I may love and embrace it; kindle in me,
more and more, holy desires; confirm my resolutions, and strengthen all my
good endeavors, that as I have taught thy ways unto others, so I my self may
walk constantly in them, that so I may shine before them, both in the light of
doctrine, and also of a good and holy example, in the whole course of my life
and conversation. Join also, I humbly beseech thee, with these my poor
labors, which I have wholly devoted to thy glory, and the good of my brethren,
the inward assistance of thy grace and holy Spirit, and thereby add such power
and efficacy, virtue and vigor unto them, that they may not only reveal the
way of salvation to the understanding of the Christian Readers, but may also
effectually move and persuade them to walk in it sincerely and uprightly,
constantly and continually, unto the very end of their lives; to the glory of
thy great Name, and the comfort and salvation of all our souls, through thine
only Son, and our blessed Savior Jesus Christ: to whom with thee and thy
most holy Spirit, three persons, and one only true God, most wise, glorious,
gracious and blessed, be ascribed of us, and thy whole Church, all glory, and
praise, might, Majesty and dominion, both now and evermore. Amen.

A PARAPHRASE UPON THE LORDS PRAYER.
ALmighty and eternal God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in him our
gracious Father, we thy poor children by adoption and grace, here
acknowledge, that we are utterly unworthy to be counted in the number of thy
meanest servants, and much less deserve that high title and privilege to be
called thy sons and children. For we have not demeaned our selves as it
becomes children of such a Father, in all love, reverence, and obedience, nor
approved our selves to be like unto thee, in wisdom, holiness, and
righteousness. We have abased our selves, to do service unto sin and Satan,
for the trifling wages of worldly vanities; never considering that we are the
children of such a glorious Father, and heirs to such an heavenly inheritance.
We do not like children securely rest upon thy fatherly providence, and cannot
with boldness approach to the Throne of Grace, to make our suits known unto
thee, by reason of our selfe-guiltinesse and ill deserving, though thou art
gracious and ready always through Christ, to hear and help us. We have not
duly feared thee, though thou art our heavenly Father, full of Majesty and
power, neither have we been afraid to sin against thee, though we stand
always in thy presence, who art able to cast body and soul into hell We have
not glorified thy holy Name, by renouncing impiety and worldly lusts, and
consecrating our selves wholly to thy worship and service, but have served
sin and Satan, for the base hire of worldly vanities. We have not glorified
thee in thy mercies by our unfeigned thankfulness, nor have been encouraged
by thy liberal wages, to perform unto thee diligent and cheerful service,
but have abused thy good gifts to thy dishonor, and have set our minds and
hearts more upon them, then upon thee who have graciously bestowed them upon
us. We have not sanctified thee in thy Judgments, by humbling our selves under
thy hand, nor have profited by thy fatherly corrections for the amendment of
our lives, and turning unto thee from our sins by unfeigned repentance. We
have not suffered thee to reign and rule in our hearts and consciences by the
Scepter of thy Word and holy Spirit, but have often grieved it, by resisting
and quenching the good motions thereof, and by subiecting our selves to be
governed by our own lusts. We have not behaved our selves as it became
subjects of thy Kingdom, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, and living
holily, righteously, and soberly in this present world. We have not denied our
selves and our own wills and affections, which are opposite to thy holy will,
nor endeavored as we ought, to perform unto thee in all things, that absolute
obedience which is due unto thee our Creator and Redeemer. We have not obeyed
thee cheerfully and with delight, readily and without delays, sincerely and
constantly, but have divided our selves between thee and the world, and have
served thee but by fits and flashes. We have not in all things submitted our
selves unto thy good pleasure, but have murmured against thy providence, when
we have been crossed in our desires. We have not restrained and mortified
our carnal and worldly lusts of ambition, covetousness, and voluptuousness,
but have immoderately desired, and set our hearts too much upon earthly and
momentany things. We have more hungered after the meat which perishes, then
after spiritual food which indures unto life everlasting. We have not
contented our selves with that portion which thou have allotted unto us, nor
cast all our care upon thee for all things needful, but have turmoyled our
selves with carking care, and trusted too much unto our own providence. We
have not so earnestly desired to be freed from the corruption and pollution of
our sins, as from the guilt and punishment, and have been more ready to have
them pardoned, then to leave and forsake them. We have not labored after the
fruits of sanctification, to be assured thereby that we are justified and
reconciled, or content our selves with a small measure, and thereby weaken our
assurance. We are not pressed with our sins, as with an heavy burden, nor have
(as we ought) seriously bewailed them, nor earnestly desired to be eased of
them. We do not carefully keep our watch, that we be not again surprised by
sin, and so are apt to relapse again into the same sins, after we have
repented of them, and received pardon. We are negligent in the use of the
means whereby we might be assured of the remission of our sins, neither do
we sincerely and from the bottom of our hearts remit injuries, but in
profession and show, forgiving, but not forgetting them. We do not approve
our sincerity in remitting injuries, by our readiness to perform all good
duties to those who have offended us, and by ouercomming evil with goodness.
We are too apt to take notice of every injury, and do not pass by offenses,
approouing our wisdom, by our slownesse to anger; and our love, by covering a
multitude of sins, but are apt to retain anger, and to seek revenge when we
are wronged. We do not as we should, resist the tentations of the flesh,
world, and devil, but though we pray against them, yet upon every slight
occasion we run into them, and are easily enticed to fall into sin, and to
forfeit that liberty which Christ has purchased for us. We live securely, as
if we were free from all danger of enemies, and do not duly consider their
malice and subtilty, our own weakness, and their power, that we might be
moved hereby to pray with more feruency to be freed from tentations, or for
thy assistance, that we might overcome them, and be delivered from all evil:
whereof it comes to pass that we are often foiled by them, and led captive
unto sin. We are not daily prepared against the time of tentation, nor keep
the Christian Armor fast buckled unto us, that we might be able to resist our
enemies. We do not watchfully avoid the occasions of evil, nor carefully
observe our hearts and senses, keeping them under Covenant, that they may not
roue after worldly vanities, which are the usual occasions whereby we are
plunged into all evil. But we beseech thee, good Lord, to be gracious unto
us, in the forgiveness of all our sins, and wash them away in the precious
Blood of Jesus Christ, that they may never be imputed unto us, nor bring upon
us that wrath which they have deserved. Yea, Lord, we beseech thee for Christ's
sake, not only free us from deserved punishments, but being reconciled unto us
in thy Son, multiply thy favors and blessings upon us in all things
pertaining to grace and godliness, glory and happiness. Persuade us by thy
Spirit and a lively faith, that thou art in Christ, our Father, and we thy
children by adoption and grace. Let us ever love and fear thee, as our
gracious Father, perform unto thee the obedience of children, and labor to
resemble thee in wisdom, holiness, and righteousness, that so we may walk
worthy this high calling whereunto thou have called us. Let us demean our
selves as Pilgrims on earth, and have our conversation in heaven, where our
inheritance is, minding and affecting things above, where Christ sits at thy
right hand. Let us wholly rely upon thy fatherly providence, who art both able
and willing to help us, and let us with boldness and confidence have recourse
unto thee in all our wants, and with assurance that thou will graciously hear
and help us. Let us in our judgments esteem, in our hearts desire, and in
all our actions seek thy glory above all things, and let it ever be more
dear unto us then our own salvation. Let us give glory to thy Name, in all
our thoughts, words, and actions, and not only do it our selves, but also
give just occasion to others of glorifying thee. Let us sanctify thee, both in
thy mercies and judgments, toward our selves or others; let thy rich wages
make us more faithful and cheerful in thy service, and thy fatherly
corrections more fearful to displease thee. Remove all impediments of thy
glory, and advance the means whereby it is advanced. Advance thy Kingdom
universally over all; rule over thine enemies, and subject all things unto thy
government, that nothing may resist thy power. Rule over thine own servants
and Church after a special manner, in protecting and preserving them, and let
them, like dutiful subjects, yield obedience unto thee their Sovereign in all
things. Make us in this life true members of the Kingdom of grace, that
afterward we may be triumphant members of the Kingdom of glory. Rule in our
hearts effectually by thy Word and Spirit; work in us thine own good work of
grace; make us Citizens of the Saints, and meet to be partakers of thy
Kingdom of glory. Pull us more and more out of the kingdom of Satan, in which
we naturally are subjects, and let him no longer reign and rule in our hearts
and minds to our perdition. Let us no longer be ruled by the lawless law of
sin, neither let it reign in our mortal bodies, by making our members the
instruments of it; but be thou our King, and rule in our hearts by thy Word and
Spirit. Erect the Kingdom of grace, where it is not yet begun; continue and
increase it amongst us, where it is established; bless the means whereby it is
furthered, and remove the impediments which hinder it. Free us from the
remnants of the kingdom of darkness, from our sins and corruptions, lusts
and concupiscences. Let us not yield to the tentations of Satan, the world, and
our own flesh, but give us victory over them. Let us first seek thy Kingdom
and righteousness, and let us endeavor to be members of the Kingdom of grace,
that afterward we may be members of the Kingdom of glory. Let thy Kingdom of
glory also come; hasten the coming of Christ to Judgment; to this end,
accomplish the number of thine Elect, and subdue thine enemies under thy feet.
Let us so live always, as if we were ready to meet Jesus Christ, and let us
labor to be ever such, as we desire to appear before his Judgment seat,
that so when he comes, we may not depart from him ashamed. Let it appear, O
Lord, that thou raignest in our hearts by our humble subjection and submission
in all things unto thy most holy will; let us see and bewail our imperfect
obedience, and daily labor after more perfection. Give us grace to deny our
selves, and our own wills and affections, which are opposite to thy will, and
let us labor to perform absolute obedience unto thee in all things. Arm us
with patience in all our afflictions, that we may say with Christ, Not my will,
O Father, but thine be done. Let us seriously desire that thy will may be done
concerning us, and let us not grieve when we see it done, because it crosses
our wills. Let us not content our selves with a bare outward obedience, but let
us do thy will after a spiritual manner, as the Angels do it in heaven, with
sincerity and uprightness of heart, with alacrity and cheerfulness, with
readiness and speed without delay. Let us do thy will fully, and not by
halues; constantly, and not by fits; faithfully and humbly, not assuming any
glory to our selves, but yielding it wholly unto thee. Let all our suites which
concern our selves, be referred to thy glory as their maine end. Give us
temporal benefits, so far forth as they serve for thy glory and our
spiritual good. Teach us to moderate our desires, and not to covet after
superfluities, seeing thou have taught us to ask for bread, and not for
dainties. Let us be contented with our allowance, if we have but necessaries,
as food and raiment, yea, bread to sustain our lives; and if thou give us
more, make us thankful unto thee for it. Let us have a true desire and care to
get our goods by good and lawful means, that we may be assured that we eat
our own bread, and that it is given us of thee. Let us walk diligently in our
lawful callings, that we may eat the labors of our own hands, and working
with quietness that which is good, let us eat our own bread. Let us not set
our hearts and desires upon the things of this life, nor covet other men's
goods, but be contented with our own portion which in thy wise providence thou
have allotted unto us. Let us have a moderate care to provide that which is
convenient, that we may not be burdensome, but rather helpefull unto others,
and let us neither be careless and negligent, nor turmoile our selves with
carking care to hoord up for many years. Let us depend upon thy blessing in
the use of good means for the obtaining of our desires, and expect it upon the
things themselves when we have obtained them, and let us sanctify all thy
blessings to our use, by the Word, Prayer, and Thanksgiving. Let us not trust
in our own provision, but in thee; and casting all our care upon thee, let us
in all our wants fly unto thee for supply. Give us things necessary, not
only for our nature, but also for our states and callings, places and persons.
Give us with thy blessings their right use, and give them virtue and strength
to sustain and nourish us. Let us, when we want these blessings, beg them
from thee, and when we have received them, return thee thanks. Inflame our
hearts with love toward our brethren, and let us not, through covetousness
and self-love, seek only our own good, but let us seek the common good of
our brethren, and pray for it as well as for our own. Let us know and
acknowledge our frailty and mortality, who need to be daily sustained by thee,
and let this make us like children, to resort daily unto thee our heavenly
Father, craving from thee all things needful. Let us not be distrustfully
careful for the time to come, but ever depend upon thy Fatherly providence,
being assured that thou who have provided for us to day, wilt provide for us to
morrow. Let us lay up goods to good ends, not only that we may have to supply
our wants, and to provide for our families, but also to relieve the necessities
of others. Let us not be so addicted to the commodities of this life, but that
withal, we do most principally labor for Spiritual graces, and things
pertaining to a better life. Let us as much desire to be freed from the
corruption of sin, as the guilt and punishment, and as we crave the
forgiveness of our sins, so let us earnestly labor to forsake them. Remit
and pardon all our sins, and to this end give us a lively Faith to apply
Christ for our justification. Let us pray for remission, not only with
feruencie, but also with Faith, steadfastly believing that thou will pardon
them, and seal this assurance in our hearts by thy good Spirit. Let us see our
sins, and heartily bewail them, and be truly grieved because they no more
grieve us. Let us after reconciliation desire and endeavor in all things to
please thee, and choose rather to displease our selves and all the world, then
thy Majesty. Let us confirm our Faith in the assurance of pardon, by forgiving
those who have trespassed against us, and that not in show only, but in truth
and sincerity. Let us not only forgive injuries, but also forget them, and
approve our sincerity in remitting, by our readiness to perform all good
duties unto them, that we may overcome evil with goodness. Let us pass by
offenses, and show our wisdom in our slownesse to Anger and Revenge. Let us
do good to those that hurt us, and pray for those that persecute us. Give unto
us not only the grace of Justification, and the Remission of our sins, but
also of Sanctification, and the spirit of fortitude, whereby we may mortify
sin, and be enabled to resist the tentations of the flesh, the world and the
devil. Let us not, when we are washed with the blood of Christ, and freed from
the guilt and curse of sin, defile our selves again, nor be entangled in the
yoke of bondage, but let us stand fast in the liberty which Christ has
purchased for us. Let us not abuse our liberty as an occasion to the flesh, and
because we are freed from sin, sin the more freely; but being delivered out of
the hands of all our spiritual enemies, let us worship and serve thee without
fear, in holiness and righteousness before thee all the days of our lives.
Let us continually watch and pray, that we do not enter into tentations,
seeing our spiritual enemies are ever most busy and malicious in assaulting
those, whom thou have pulled out of the kingdom of darkness, and made
subjects of thy Kingdom, and servants of thy family. Let us consider our own
weakness, and our enemies power, and let this move us with more feruency to
crave thy help and assistance. Establish us (O Lord) by thy free Spirit, and
so strengthen us with thy wisdom and power, that we may be able to stand
against the artificial and cunning tentations of the devil. Do not give us
over to the Tempter, nor leave us to our selves, but with the tentation give an
happy issue, that we may have the upper hand, and be preserved from all evil.
We crave not to be freed from tentation, but that we may not be tempted above
our power; Yea, try us, O Lord, as much as thou will, so that being tried, we
may be found approved. Let us quench the fiery darts of the devil with the
shield of Faith, and not admit of his suggestions, but nippe them in the head,
when they are first offered unto us. Lead us not (O Lord) into tentation; give
us not over to our own lusts, to be hardened with the deceitfulness of sin,
nor to the world, to be carried away with the desires thereof, nor to the
devil, to be overcome with his tentations, and to be carried away captive to
do his will. Let those weakness which we discern in tentation, make us to
rest more entirely upon thy power. Let us in the sight of them be truly
humbled; turn them to our good, and make us more careful in the use of all
good means to attain unto more strength. Let us not fall away in the time of
tentation, but enable us to withstand our enemies in the evil day; and having
finished the fight, let us stand fast, and be kept by thy power through faith
unto salvation. Let us always be prepared for the day of battle, and put on
thy whole armor, that we may be enabled to resist our enemies. Let us not
tempt thee by running into tentation, and expose our selves to Satan's baytes
and snares, before they be offered unto us. Let all our trials and tentations
tend to our good, and the more enrich us with Spiritual graces, and so further
our everlasting salvation. Do not (O Lord) punish in us one sin, by giving
us over to another, neither leave us to our own lusts, to the hardness of our
hearts, or to a reprobate mind, to commit sin with greediness. Give us thy
sanctifying Spirit, and enable us thereby not only to fight against the flesh,
but also to subdue and mortify our earthly members, our inordinate affections
and evil concupiscence. Renew us by thy Spirit, that we may no longer be
carnal, but Spiritual, walking not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Let
us not be carried away with the world, or overcome with the tentations, either
on the right hand, or on the left: But let us overcome the world by Faith. Give
us the Spirit of Wisdom to preserve us, that we be not ensnared with worldly
wiles; keep us from being corrupted with rotten speeches, and the inticements
and ill counsels of the wicked; let us not stumble at their scandals and
offenses, nor be misled by their evil ensamples, preserve us from the
contagion of their company, and let us not be conformed to their fashions, but
notwithstanding all their tentations, let us constantly persevere in the course
of holiness and righteousness. Give us grace to renounce all worldly lusts,
ambition, covetousness and voluptuousness. Weane our hearts from earthly
vanities, and let us use the world as not abusing it. Crucify us to the world,
and the world unto us, and let us live as pilgrims and strangers upon the
earth, and Citizens of heaven. Let us mind heavenly things, and contemn the
things of the world as mere vanities, in comparison of Spiritual graces and
heavenly glory. Let us not be overcome with worldly afflictions, but either in
whole or in part release us of them; or else arm us with patience, that we
may bear them and endure tentation, that so being approved, we may receive
the Crown of life. Tread down Satan under our feet, show thy power in our
weakness, and glorify thy Name in our victory. Perfect the work of our
Sanctification and Redemption which is begun in this life; and not only free us
in part from our corruptions, but conform us wholly to the glorious Image of
thy Son. Deliver us from every evil thing, and preserve us unblameable to thy
heavenly Kingdom. Let us shake off security, and be vigilant and watchful,
and let us above all observations look to our hearts. Let us keep a narrow
watch over our tongues and senses, let us make a covenant with our eyes, and
turn them away from beholding vanities. Let us long after our full
deliverance, and final victory over our spiritual enemies; and seeing we
shall not absolutely be freed from sin, and perfectly sanctified in this
life, let us earnestly desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, that so
being fully delivered from the body of this death, we may perform unto thee
such perfect service as thou requirest. Confirm our Faith in this assurance,
that thou will hear our prayers, and grant our requests, seeing thine is the
Kingdom, whereby thou have right to give whatsoever we desire, thine is the
power and might, whereby thou art able to grant our requests, and thine also is
the glory both of giving all good things, and also of all good things given;
and therefore thou will be willing to hear our suits, seeing they tend to the
advancement of thy glory. And so (Lord) we ascribe unto thee universal
Kingdom, whereby thou rulest and gouernest all things, and acknowledge thy
wisdom, power and providence, to thy praise in disposing of them at thy
pleasure: we acknowledge and ascribe unto thee the glory of being our King,
who preseruest and defendest us, rulest and gouernest us with the Scepter of
thy Word and holy Spirit. We ascribe unto thee all power, whereby thou art able
to do whatsoever thou will, and magnify thy Name for keeping and ruling us
with this power unto salvation. We render unto thee all glory, and the
deserved praise of all thy goodness, magnifying thee according to the
multitude of thy mercies, and the excellency of thy gifts, wherewith thou have
enriched us; desiring that we may ascribe all the good we have done, or can
do, to thy glory, as being the supreme end of all things. And this thy
Kingdom, Power and Glory, we do not limit with the longest time, but ascribe
them unto thee from everlasting, to everlasting, even as thou thy self art
without beginning or ending. And thus, holy and heavenly Father, we testify our
faith, and the truth of our desires, by saying Amen, and give the assent of our
hearts to the words of our mouths in all our petitions; believing that thou in
thy good time wilt grant all our suites which we have made according to thy
will, as shall best stand with thy Glory, and our salvation; in which
persuasion we conclude our prayers, and attend thy leisure, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.

A private Prayer for the Morning.
O Lord our God, most glorious in majesty, and omnipotent in power, who fillest
heaven and earth with thy presence, and yet in a more special manner
vouchsafest to dwell with those who are of a broken heart and contrite spirit,
to hear and help them in all their necessities; I thy poor humble servant,
in the mediation of Jesus Christ, do make bold to approach into thy glorious
and dreadful presence, that I may lay open before thee my wretched estate and
condition, by reason of my manifold and grievous sins, and those fearful
punishments, both temporal and eternal, unto which by their guilt they have
most justly obliged me. For though thou did create me holy and righteous,
according unto thine own Image, yet I have fallen from that state of innocence
and blessedness, in the loins of my first father Adam, and by being guilty
of his sin, am become also liable to his punishment. And as I am partaker of
his sin by imputation, as being one of his taynted posterity, so also of the
corruption of his nature by propagation, the which like a fretting leprosy, or
running canker, has wholly ouerspred all the powers and parts of my soul and
body, utterly disabling them unto all duties of thy service, and making them
the ready instruments of sin and Satan. And whereas in their creation they
were fit habitations for thine own Majesty to dwell in by thy Spirit, through
this natural corruption they became cages of unclean birds, yea, noisome
sinkes, exhaling and breathing out the loathsome sent, and poisonous vapors of
carnal concupiscence and filthy lusts. Mine understanding is so darkened with
ignorance, that it is naturally unacquainted with thy will and ways, and
though it be wise to evil, yet unto that which is good, I have no knowledge;
my carnal reason and wisdom is enmity against thee, and understands not
the things of thy Spirit, but so foolish it is, that it judges them
foolishness. My judgment is so corrupted, that it has no spiritual
discerning, being ready to mistake evil for good, falsehood for truth, and
wrong for right. My conscience is either seared or superstitious, either
senseless of sin, or scared with shadows; my mind and imaginations are
only and continually evil, rouing wholly after earthly things, and never
minding spiritual and heavenly. My memory is become a storehouse of iniquity,
with which it is so fully fraughted, that there is no room for good
instructions and the rich treasures of thy saving Truth. My will is so
corrupted, that it stands in flat opposition to thine holy will, approving
and choosing that which thou dislikest and condemnest, and refusing and
abhorring that which thou likest and command. My heart is wholly turned from
thee, and cleaves to world and earthly vanities, and is full of infidelity,
security and impenitency, hardened in sin, and unflexible to all good. Mine
affections are wholly corrupted and disordred, loving, fearing and trusting in
the creature more then in the Creator; and all the members and parts of my body
are sluggish and slothful unto all duties of thy service, but the apt and
ready instruments of my sinful soul for the acting of all manner of
wickedness. From which cursed fountain of original corruption, have
plentifully flowed those poisonous streams of actual transgressions, whereby I
have violated and broken thy whole Law in thought, word and deed. For in stead
of doing thy Law, I have wholly transgressed it; in stead of observing the
duties commanded, I have committed the vices forbidden; in stead of continuing
in obedience, I have continually disobeyed it, from my tender infancy to this
present day. A great part of my time I have lien stark dead in trespasses and
sins, not being able to think a good thought, or entertayne a good desire,
because both my mind and will were enslaued unto Satan in the chains of sin.
And all this while my ears were deaf, mine eyes blinded, and my heart without
understanding, so as I could neither hear, see, nor discern the things which
concerned thy glory and mine own salvation, but utterly neglected thy many and
gracious calls inuiting me to thy service. Yea, Lord, since the time that thou
have, through thy mighty power, and of thy mere grace, quickened and raised me
from this death of sin, how have I, like Lazarus, come out of the grave bound
hand and foot, and still so fettred and hampred with the relikes of my
corruptions, that I walk slowly and lamely in the ways of thy Commandments,
oftentimes neglecting, upon every slight occasion, the duties of holiness and
righteousness, and oftentimes performing them with such weakness and
imperfection, as it is hard to say whether they were not better undone, then so
done? O how often do I forget even the main end for which I live, namely,
that by glorifying thee I may live eternally; and as though I were a citizen of
the earth, how have I my conversation here, spending my thoughts and strength
about worldly vanities which profit not, and not so much as minding spiritual
and heavenly things! How slowly (alas) do I come to the duties of thy service,
who art so infinitely bountiful in thy rewards! How coldly and carelessly, how
dully and drowzily, how irreuerently and negligently do I perform them! How
soon am I weary of these holy exercises, and desire to return to my worldly
employments! How little sweetness does my aguish taste feel in thy love,
though it be better then wine, and in feeding upon thy spiritual delicacies in
thy banqueting house, thy Word and Sacraments? How little delight have I had in
thy Sanctuary and Sabbaths, and how have I consecrated the least part of them
as an holy Rest unto thee, and misspent the greatest part in thinking mine own
thoughts, in thinking mine own words, and doing mine own works? How much and
often have I abused thine holy ordinances, through my worldliness and
profaneness, and after that I have long inioyed them, how little have I
profited by them? Mine heart is still full of gross infidelity, which is the
cause that I am not much raised and comforted with thy sweet promises, nor
dejected and humbled with thy terrible threatenings. It is full of impenitency,
being unapt to mourn for sins past, or to resolve upon amendment for the
time to come. It is full of carnal security, making me to apprehend no
danger, when as I walk in the midst of pernicious snares, which are in every
place laid in my way by my spiritual enemies, and to put the evil day far
from me, when as pulling it on with my sins, it approaches near, and is ready
to seize upon me. It is much hardened through the deceitfulness of sin,
custom in sinning depriving me of the sense of it. There is much spiritual
pride that lies lurking in it, which makes me ready to arrogate the good
things I have not, to ouerweene those I have, and to attribute the praise of
both unto my self, and so to rob thee of the glory of thine own gifts.
Hypocrisy also still hangs upon me, being ready, like a sly thief, to
steal in, when I open the door of mine heart, to let in any grace or
religious duty. I am still tainted and poisoned with carnal self-love, which
makes me oftentimes to incur spiritual hurt and damage, whilst I labor
ouer-eagerly after worldly good, and earthly advantage. Yea as hereby I am made
apt to neglect my soul, for the seeming and present good of my body,
defrauding it of all dues that belong unto it; so likewise the duties of
righteousness and love which I owe to my neighbors, when as they are in my
partial affection ouer-ballanced with some worldly profit, pleasure or
preferment. O that my head were a fountain of tears, that I might wash my
defiled body and soul in the floods of unfeigned sorrow! O that I could mourn
for my sins, as a man mourns for his only son, and be sorry for them, as
a man is sorry for the death of his firstborn! O that I could look upon him
whom I have pierced with bitter grief, and be thoroughly displeased with my
self, because I have by my sins so much displeased thee, who have been ever
unto me so gracious a God, and so loving a Father! O that thou would come
down and strike my rocky heart, that out of it might flow wholesome streams
of repentance! But alas, the filthy stains and deep dye of my sins cannot
be washed clean with these waters. It is only that Fountain which thou have
opened to the house of David, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and
for uncleanness, that is sufficient to purge me from my ingrained filthiness.
It is those bloody streams alone which so plentifully flowed out of my
crucified Savior, that can cleanse me from all my sins. And therefore (O Lord)
for thy mercies sake, and for thy Christ's sake, wash my leprous body and soul
in the streams of this thy Jordan. Yea (Lord) seeing they are so deeply
stained with the double double dye of imputed and inherent, original and
actual sins, that no slight and ordinary washing can purify and restore
them to their created cleanness, multiply thy washings; drench and diue me
thoroughly in the streams of this living Fountain, that being cleansed from my
Scarlet and Crimson sins, both in respect of their guilt and punishment, I
may become as white as Snow, and that no spot remaining of spiritual
defilement, I may be justified when thou iudgest, and stand righteous in thy
sight. And together with the stain of sin, take away also the sting of
conscience, and work in it sound and secure peace, by persuading me, by the
infallible testimony of thy Spirit, that my sins are remitted, I reconciled
through the death and satisfaction of thy Son, and that, of the child of
wrath, and heir of perdition, I am now become thine own child by adoption and
grace. And to this end let me find and feel it in me, not only the Spirit of
Adoption persuading me of thy fatherly love, and sealing me up unto the Day of
my Redemption, but also the Spirit of Sanctification, mortifying in me all my
sinful corruptions, by applying unto me the virtue of Christ's death, and
quickening me in the inner man, unto holiness and newness of life, by the
power and efficacy of his Resurrection. Let me put off, concerning the former
conversation, the old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceitful lusts;
and being renewed in the spirit of my mind, let me put on the new man, which,
after thine own glorious Image, is created in righteousness and true
holiness. Let me continually keep a narrow watch over my self, that I be
not again entangled in the snares of the devil, nor circumuented and misled
through the deceitfulness of my corrupt flesh, but being freed from sin, let
me now become the servant of righteousness. Let me make conscience of all my
ways, and shun not only open and notorious, but also secret sins, yea,
all the occasions of evil, and hate even the garment which is spotted of the
flesh. Let me put on daily the whole armor of God, that being weak in my
self, I may be strong in thee, and in the power of thy might, and be enabled
to withstand the wiles of the devil, and resist all tentations in the evil
Day; praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
watching thereunto with all perseverance. Weane mine heart and affections more
and more from the love of the world and earthly vanities, and being a pilgrim
on earth, let my conversation be in heaven, from whence I expect a Savior and
Redeemer. Begin, and work in me all spiritual gifts and saving graces which
yet are wanting, and daily increase and confirm those that are begun; and let
me daily bring forth the fruits of them all, throughout my whole life and
conversation in new obedience, laboring to perform unto thee faithful
service in all my thoughts, words and deeds. Let me delight in the ways of thy
Commandments, and perform all the duties of holiness, righteousness and
sobriety, with all cheerfulness and inward joy. Let me daily seek thy face
and favor above all things, and rejoice in nothing so much, as in the
assurance of thy love, and when the light of thy countenance shines upon me.
Remove out of my way, all lets and impediments, which might hinder me in my
Christian course, or so assist me with thy grace, that I may overcome them.
Stablish me with thy free Spirit, that I may not only begin well, but also
continue in all grace and goodness unto the very end of my life, and let me be
steadfast, immovable, and always abounding in the work of the Lord. And with
these my prayers and supplications, I do also join my praises and
thanksgiving, lauding and magnifying thy great and glorious Name, for thine
inestimable love, and the fruits and testimonies thereof showed unto me, even
from before all beginnings unto this present day. For that thou have, of thy
free grace, chosen me to life and salvation, created me after thine own
similitude and likeness, in wisdom, holiness and righteousness, redeemed
me at so dear a price, out of the miserable bondage of my spiritual enemies,
effectually called me, by the sound of the Gospel, to the knowledge of thy
truth, united me unto Christ by thy Spirit and a lively faith, and made me
partaker of all his benefits; for my justification by his righteousness and
obedience, and for some degrees of sanctification begun in me, whereby thou
have subdued the power of sin, that though it dwells, yet it does not
reign in me, and have wrought in me some desire, resolution and endeavor to
serve and please thee. For that thou have watched over me with thy providence,
in the whole course of my life, and namely, this night past, and have thereby
preserved me from all perils; from the terrors of the night, and the malice
of mine enemies, and have refreshed me with quiet rest, and now raised me up in
the strength thereof to do thee service. O Lord, enlarge my heart, that I may
duly consider of thy manifold and rich mercies, and be thoroughly inflamed with
the apprehension of thy love. What am I (my God) that thou should be thus
gracious unto me, who am altogether less then the least of thy mercies, yea
worthy of thy greatest punishments! O that I could love and praise thee
according to thy bounty and goodness! And being so poor, that I have nothing
to repay; and thou so rich, that thou neither need, nor requirest any thing
else; O that I could ever remain a grateful debtor, having mine heart filled
with thankfulness, and my mouth with thanksgiving! And now (Lord) I further
beseech thee, to continue still my God and guide, to direct, lead and uphold
me in all the ways of holiness and righteousness. Take me into thy
gracious protection this day and ever, and watch so over me with thy
all-ruling providence, that I may be preserved safe from all enemies, worldly
and spiritual, and from those manifold dangers which incompasse me on every
side. Give me grace so to spend this day, that some glory may redound unto
thee by my service, some profit and benefit unto those with whom I live, and
some further assurance unto my self (from the increase of saving graces
discerned in me, and spiritual strength in all good duties) of my salvation
and eternal happiness. Order and govern all my thoughts, that they may be
religious and honest; my speeches, that they may be wise, and seasoned with
grace, and all my works and actions for the well performing both of the
general duties of Christianity, and the special duties of my calling,
blessing so all my labors, that I may be cheered and comforted in them by my
prosperous success in all my good endeavors. Supply unto me all temporal
blessings, and the necessary comforts of this life, and let me live at thy
finding, and receive whatsoever I enjoy, as the gifts of thine own hand, and
pledges of thy love, that I may return the praise which is due unto thee for
them, and use them as helps to further me in all duties of thy service.
Finally, I beseech thee, good Lord, to vouchsafe these and all other benefits,
not only unto me, but also to thy whole Church and every particular member
thereof, especially to this in which I live. Multiply thy favors upon our
Sovereign Lord the King, our noble Prince, the Prince Electour Palatine, and
the Lady Elizabeth his wife, with their issue; upon the honorable Lords of the
Privy Council, the Magistrates and Ministers of thy Word and Sacraments, the
afflicted members of Jesus Christ, my friends and benefactours, kindred and
acquaintance, and especially upon this whole family; giving unto us all grace,
that we may keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; and so join
together with our hearts and minds in all duties of thy service, as that we may
jointly inherit that eternal happiness of thy Kingdom, through Jesus Christ
our Lord; to whom with thee and thine holy Spirit, be rendered all glory and
praise, might, Majesty, and Dominion, both now and evermore. Amen.

Another private Prayer for the Morning.
O Almighty and eternal God, our most gracious and loving Father in Jesus
Christ, I thy poor sinful servant, being in my self utterly unworthy to
appear in thy glorious presence, do yet in the Name and mediation of Jesus
Christ, offer unto thee my prayers and supplications, in obedience to thy
Commandments, and in some assurance of thy gracious promises; rendering unto
thee from the bottom of mine heart, all humble and hearty thanks, for thy
manifold mercies and abundant blessings multiplied upon me, both in respect of
spiritual and heavenly privileges, which concern my everlasting salvation,
and of temporal and earthly benefits appertaining to the good of this life,
and my present estate in this place of my Pilgrimage. For that thou have freely
loved me from all eternity, and of thy mere grace have chosen me unto life
and glory, without any respect of my works or worthiness. For creating me
according to thine own Image, and redeeming me out of the estate of sin and
death. For calling me effectually by thy Word and Spirit, and making me a
servant of thine own family, and a member of Jesus Christ, whereby thou have
given me just title unto him and all his benefits. For making with me the
Covenant of grace, adopting me in him to be thy child, unto a lively hope of
my heavenly inheritance. For justifying me in his righteousness imputed unto
me, and applied by a lively faith; and sanctifying me with thy Spirit, giving
me some power over my corruptions, and some desire and endeavor to serve and
please thee in the duties of a godly life. For watching over me with thy
providence ever since I had my being and birth, shielding me from dangers,
delivering me out of manifold evils, and providing for me all things
necessary both for my soul and body. For preserving me this night past from
all perils, giving unto me quiet rest, and bringing me in safety to see the
light, adding yet another day to my life, that therein I may do thee service,
and use all good means for the furthering and assuring of my salvation. O
Lord, give me a true sense and feeling of thy love, that I may love thee
again, and a lively apprehension and taste of thy rich mercy and goodness,
that mine heart and voice may return unto thee the praises that are due. Yea,
so much the more, O Lord, increase my thankfulness, by how much the less
worthy I am of the least of thy mercies, by reason of my manifold and grievous
sins. For I confess unfeignedly that miserable estate in which I am by
nature; both in respect of my original corruption in which I was conceived and
borne, whereby all the powers and faculties of my body and soul have been
wholly defiled, and utterly disabled unto all duties of thy service, for which
I was created; and that I have made my self much more miserable, by adding
heereunto actual transgressions, whereby I have broken all and every of thy
Commandments, in thought, word, and deed, both by omitting the duties which
thou have commanded, and committing the contrary vices and sins which thou
have forbidden; the which, as they are for the quality of them heinous, so do
they in number exceed the hairs of mine head and the stars of heaven. Yea,
Lord, I have not only thus sinned against thee in the days of my ignorance,
when as I neither had any knowledge of thee and of thy will, nor so much as any
desire to serve and please thee, but even since the time that thou have called
me to the knowledge of thy Truth, and by the good motions of thy Spirit, have
persuaded me to embrace, profess, and practice it; since thou have allured
me by thy gracious promises to serve thee, and have encouraged me heereunto
by innumerable blessings, and large testimonies of thy favor, I have often
sinned against thee through frailty and infirmity, and not seldom against my
knowledge and conscience. Oftentimes I have neglected thy service, to serve in
the mean while mine own sinful lusts; and when I have undertaken it, I have
performed it oftentimes after a cold and formal manner, with much weakness
and weariness, vnchearefulnesse, and deadness of heart and spirit. By all
which my sins thus multiplied against thee, I have justly deserved to be
deprived of all thy blessings and benefits, and to be overwhelmed with all
those fearful punishments threatened in the Law, respecting both this life and
the life to come. O Lord my God, affect my heart with unfeigned sorrow in the
sight and sense of this my sin and misery. And as it is a burden too heavy
for me to bear, so let me have such a feeling of it, that I may hunger after
the righteousness of Jesus Christ, and apply it unto me by a lively faith;
and so make good the Covenant of grace, which thou have made with me: one
special branch whereof is this, that thou will remember my sins no more. I
confess that I have offended thy Justice, but my Savior Christ has satisfied
it, by paying my debt to the uttermost farthing: accept therefore of his
satisfaction, and impute not unto me that debt which he has discharged. I
have deserved eternal death and condemnation: but he was condemned, that I
might be acquitted, and has suffered the bitter death of the Cross, and
thine anger due unto my sins, that I might be freed from death and thy
displeasure: and therefore, O Lord, I beseech thee for his sake, to take away
the guilt and punishment of all my sins, that they may never be imputed unto
me in this life, nor in the life to come. And being thus justified by faith,
and at peace with thee, let me also obtain peace of conscience, in the
assurance of the remission of my sins, and thy love and favor in Jesus
Christ. Give unto me thine holy Spirit, and thereby seal me up unto the day
of my Redemption, and make me thine own Child by adoption and grace. Let me
approve my self to be thy Child, by resembling thee my heavenly Father in
holiness and righteousness; by hating and forsaking all that is evil, and by
loving and embracing all that is good. Sanctify me thorowout in my soul and
body, and let me not only make an holy profession with my mouth, but let it
proceed from my heart, and be expressed in the whole course of my life.
Encourage me in this work against all difficulties, by assuring me that thou will bring it to good effect, and let me apply unto my self thy gracious
promises, which assure me as well of my sanctification and victory over my
corruptions, as of my justification and freedom from the guilt and punishment
of my sins. Let me set continually before me thy Law, as the rule of my
life, and labor to conform my obedience in all things thereunto, denying
ungodliness and all worldly lusts, and living holily and religiously, in
respect of thee; righteously and charitably, in respect of my neighbors; and
temperately and soberly, in respect of mine own person. Let me labor to
observe thy whole Law, in forsaking all sin; especially that which is most
sweet and pleasing to my corrupt flesh, and in embracing all virtues and
Christian duties which thou have commanded, especially those unto which my
nature is most auerse. Let me not content my self with such an hypocritical
holiness as is destitute of righteousness, nor with such a merely moral
righteousness as is without holiness; but let me approve my piety to be
sincere, by my justice, charity, and mercy, and let these be sanctified by my
true godliness and religious devotion. Let me not stand at a stay, contenting
my self with that small measure of sanctification which is begun in me, but
let me daily strive in the use of all good means, whereby I may attain unto
more perfection, and so sanctify them unto me by thy holy Spirit, that they
may be effectual to perfect that good work which thou have begun. Enrich
me more and more with all sanctifying and saving graces, with the knowledge of
thee and thy will, a lively faith in Jesus Christ, unfeigned repentance for my
sins, firm affiance and confidence in thee, fervent love of thee and my
neighbors, yea, even mine enemies for thy sake. Inflame mine heart with an
ardent zeal of thy glory, replenish it with thy fear, that it may never
depart from thee. Strengthen mine hope, in the assured expectation of all thy
gracious promises, especially those which concern my everlasting happiness;
give me patience in all my troubles, thankfulness for all thy benefits,
peace of conscience, spiritual joy in the assurance of thy love, and the grace
of perseverance in the profession and practice of thy true Religion unto the
end. Remove all stumbling blocks of offense out of my way; comfort me against
all discouragements, and arm me against all the tentations of my spiritual
enemies, that they may never prevail against me. Take me into thy gracious
protection this day and ever, preserve me with thy providence from all dangers,
uphold me with thy Spirit, that I fall not into sin. Direct me with thy
Wisdom, and strengthen me with thy power in all my thoughts, words and works,
that they may be acceptable in thy sight. Bless and assist me in the general
duties of Christianity, and in the special duties of my calling, that they may
have good success, and wholly tend to the advancement of thy glory, the
edification of my brethren, and mine own spiritual and everlasting good.
Bless thy whole Church and every member thereof, especially this in which I
live, with all the Magistrates, Ministers and people, this Family, and all to
whom I am bound in any special bond of duty, beseeching thee to give unto us
all, according to our several necessities, all those gifts and graces which
thou in thy wisdom know needful, even for Jesus Christ his sake: to whom
with thee and thy holy Spirit, I ascribe all glory and praise, power and
dominion, both now and for evermore. Amen.

A Prayer for the Family in the Morning.
O Lord our God, who by thine infinite wisdom and power have created all
things in heaven and earth, and by thy gracious and all-ruling providence do
continually sustain and preserve them, we thine humble and unworthy servants,
do here, in the mediation of Jesus Christ, prostrate our selves before the
Throne of Grace, acknowledging that unto thee belongs all glory and praise,
but unto us shame and confusion of face; for whereas thou did create us,
according to thine own Image, in wisdom, holiness and righteousness, we
have fallen in the loins of our first parents, from this blessed estate, by
transgressing of thy Commandment, and thereby have defaced thy glorious Image
in us, deprived our selves of all happiness, and become liable unto death of
body and soul. Yea, we have derived from our first parents, not only the
guilt of their sin, but also the corruption of their nature, which has so
ouerspred all the powers and parts of our souls and bodies, that they are
utterly impotent and insufficient to perform any duties of thy service, for
which end they were created; but most forward and cheerful in the service of
sin and Satan. From which root of original sin, we have brought forth
those cursed fruits of actual transgressions, which we have multiplied against
thy Majesty, by breaking all and every of thy Commandments in thought, word
and deed, even from the beginning of our days to this present time. Many have
been our secret sins, of which, thou alone and our own consciences have
been witnesses; and many have we committed in the view of the world, to the
dishonor of thy blessed Name, and slander of our Christian profession. Many
have been our sins of ignorance, the which unto us are inexcusable, because
thou have reueiled thy self and thy will so clearly unto us; and many
likewise have been our sins against knowledge and conscience, and the good
motions of thy holy Spirit. Oftentimes have we sinned through frailty, being
surprised upon the sudden, with the violent and subtle tentations of our
spiritual enemies; and oftentimes wilfully, advisedly and deliberately, after
many vows and promises of repentance and amendment. We have sinned against
thee before our conversion, when as Satan's throne being set up in our hearts,
we performed unto him in all things cheerful obedience, and suffered sin to
reign and rule in us, without any gainesaying or resistance; and since we
have been called to the knowledge of thy Truth, though we have submitted our
selves as subjects of thy Kingdom, to be governed by thy Word and Spirit, yet
have we much failed in yielding that obedience which is due unto thee, being so
led captive by our corruptions, that we could neither do the good we would,
nor leave undone the evil we would not; and though by thy holy Spirit, we
have cast Satan out of his Throne, and vanquished the flesh with the lusts
thereof, so as they could not reign over us, as in former times, yet these
enemies of our salvation do still fight against our souls, and being not
quite cast out, are as thorns in our sides, and as pricks in our eyes,
disturbing continually our peace, wounding our consciences, and leading us
captive unto sin. And hereof it is, that we have so often, and upon such
slight occasions utterly neglected the duties of thy service, and when we have
set our selves about them, have done them so coldly and carelessly, and
discovered therein so many wants and weaknesses, imperfections and corruptions,
that if thou should deal with us according to thy righteous Judgment, even
the best duties that ever we performed, could not escape unpunished. O Lord our
God, make us truly apprehensiue of our sin and misery, that we may humble
our selves under thy mighty hand, and turn unto thee by unfeigned repentance,
and not only bewail our sins past with unfeigned sorrow, but amend our lives
for the time to come; and so accept of us in thy Best-beloued, and whilst we
are returning unto thee, meet us in the way, and like a tender Father embrace
us in the arms of thy mercy. Do away all our sins, and blot out all our
iniquities; and so wash and purge our defiled souls and bodies in the precious
blood of thine innocent Son, from the guilt and punishment of all our sins,
that they may never be laid to our charge, neither in this world, nor in the
world to come. Yea, Lord, let us not only have the benefit of thy grace in thy
free pardon, but also the comfort and peace of it, by having it sealed through
the inward testimony of thy Spirit in our hearts and consciences; and for our
better assurance, let us find and feel the power and efficacy of Christ's
death and Resurrection thereby applied unto us, as effectual for our
Sanctification, as for our Justification, and for our freedom from the
corruption of sin, that it may have no longer dominion over us, and
spiritual renewing unto newness of life, as well as from the guilt and
punishment. It is enough, Lord, and too much, that Satan and sin have thus
far prevailed, not only for the bringing of us into the state of death and
condemnation, but also for the condemning and crucifying of the Lord of life,
the nayling of his innocent body to the Cross, and the shedding of his
precious blood. Now (Lord) reward them as they have deserved, and pay them
double into their bosom. Break the head of the old Serpent, that though he
hiss against us with his tentations, yet he may not hurt us; nail our body of
sin unto the Cross of Christ, and by virtue of his death, crucify our flesh
and the lusts thereof, that they may no longer have dominion over us, but may
like slaves be held in perpetual subjection to our spiritual part. Yea,
subdue the power of sin in all the faculties and parts of our souls and
bodies. Mortify the corruption of our minds and understandings, the wisdom
of the flesh, and errors of our judgments, our foolish fantasies and
conceits, our earthly mindedness, and all vain and wicked thoughts, that we
may check sin in the first motions, and kill this viperous brood, before
they come to growth and strength. Mortify the frowardness, and perverseness
of our wills, the corruption of our hearts and affections, especially our
self-loue and love of the world, unjust anger, and desire of revenge, carnal
concupiscence and uncleanness, intemperance, ambition, pride, covetousness
and voluptuousness. Let us hold our eyes and ears, our tongues and taste, and
all other our senses under covenant, and make all vain and wicked sights, all
rotten and unsavory speeches, all intemperance and insobriety odious and
loathsome unto us. Quicken us in the innerman, and frame us in all holy
obedience unto thy heavenly will; make us such as thou would have us to be,
and renew thine own Image in us, in wisdom, holiness and righteousness, and
let us no more defile and deface it with our corruptions. Let us submit our
selves in all things to be guided by thy good Spirit, and yield cheerful
obedience unto all the motions thereof, not grieuing it by checking and
quenching them, or putting them off by delays to another time. Let us serve
thee in holiness, righteousness and sobriety, not dividing those things which
thou have conjoined; and not by fits and flashes, but constantly and
continually thorowout the whole course of our lives. Enrich us plentifully with
all the gifts and graces of thy sanctifying Spirit, as Faith, Hope, Humility,
Patience and the rest; yea, let us daily thrive in Spiritual strength, and not
stand at a stay, but grow up toward perfection, from childhood to a ripe age
in Jesus Christ. And with these our prayers and suites, we do with like humble
heartinesse join thy praises and our thanksgiving, for thy manifold blessings
and benefits, respecting our souls, bodies or estates. For thine undeserved
love, whereby thou have of thy free and mere grace elected, created, redeemed,
called, justified, sanctified and preserved us unto an heavenly inheritance,
and hope of a better life. For our present peace and prosperity, health, food,
apparel, sufficiency of all temporal benefits, and contentedness in them,
and especially for causing us so long to enjoy the Light of thy Gospel with
such liberty and safety. For preserving us from all dangers this night past,
and this day hitherto, and enabling us by our rest, and other comforts of this
life, to do thee service. O Lord, we praise and magnify thee for these and
all other thy mercies, and are sorry and ashamed, that we can be no more
thankful, having nothing else to return unto thee for all thy benefits. And
now, Lord, seeing in thee we live, move, and have our being, we beseech thee
to continue thy grace and favor still unto us in the whole course of our
lives, and namely, this day receive us into thy keeping, watch over us with thy
providence, and preserve us with thy grace and power from all dangers, both
spiritual and temporal, and from all evils both of sin and punishment. Let
us set our selves wholly to seek and serve thee, and propound thy glory unto
our selves, as the maine end of all our thoughts, words and actions, and so
direct and order them by thy holy Spirit, that they may upon all occasions
further and advance it. And for as much as if thou do not build the house,
we shall but labor in vain to build it, O Lord, bless us all in the duties
of our several places and callings, that they may tend to the joint good of
the whole Family, and every one of us in particular, that finding thy blessing
upon the works of our hands, we may with more courage and comfort be
faithful and painful in them. Set thy fear always before us, and let us
carry our selves in all our courses carefully and conscionably, as in thy sight
and presence, that whatsoever we do, or take in hand, may be acceptable unto
thee. Bless together with us thy whole Church, this especially in which we
live, our gracious King, and Noble Prince, the Prince and Princess Palatine,
with all their issue, the Council, Magistrates, Ministers, and the whole
people of this Land, the afflicted members of Jesus Christ, and this whole
Family, with all other our friends, kindred and acquaintance; beseeching thee
to vouchsafe unto us all, and to every one of us in our several places and
callings, all things necessary for our present comfort and future happiness,
even for Jesus Christ his sake; in whose Name and words we conclude our
prayers, saying as he has taught us; Our Father, which art in heaven, etc.

Another Prayer for the Family in the Morning.
O Lord our God, who art in thine own nature glorious and full of majesty,
infinite in goodness, wisdom, power, bounty, truth, and all perfection, most
just in all thy ways, and holy in all thy works, and our most gracious Father
in Jesus Christ, we thine unworthy servants, finding and feeling our selves
loaded with the unsupportable weight of our manifold and grievous sins, do
come unto thee for ease, and being sick in sin, even unto the death, do
flee unto thee the alone Physicion of our souls, that we may be eased and
cured, and do here lay open before thee our miserable estate and condition,
that thou may magnify thy mercies in our recovery. We confess our
hereditary diseases, and that original leprosy of our bodies and souls,
whereby they were infected and corrupted, even in our first conception, and so
disabled unto thy service, that we cannot of our selves think a good thought,
nor so much as entertain into our hearts a desire to come out of the miserable
thraldom of sin and Satan. Our wisdom is enmity against thee, and we are
not capable of that knowledge which thy Spirit reuealeth. All the imaginations
of the thoughts of our hearts are only evil, and that continually; our
consciences are loaded with dead works; our wills crooked and rebellious,
still resisting all good motions of thy Spirit; our hearts hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin; our affections, desires and passions so disordred and
poisoned with natural corruption, that they are become filthy and loathsome
sinckes of sin; and all the members of our bodies, the ready instruments of
our defiled souls for the acting of all abominable wickedness. So that being,
through his natural corruption, a sinful generation and viprous brood, we
have justly deserved, that thou should reject and pursue us with thy wrath,
though we were free from all other sins, saving those alone whereof we were
guilty as soon as we were borne. And yet (alas) we have not stayed here, but
have added unto this our original sin, innumerable numbers of actual
transgressions, by breaking thy whole Law, and every Commandment thereof, in
thought, word and deed, both in the omission of all duties therein required,
and in the commission of the vices and sins therein forbidden; whereby we
have made our selves liable to the fearful curse thereof, and to all the
plagues and punishments of this life, and the life to come. Neither is there
any power in us to help our selves out of this misery, being as unable to
renew our nature, as the Blackamore to change his skin, or the Leopard his
spots. Yea, when by thy Spirit we are regenerate, and have some desires and
endeavors to serve and please thee, we are utterly unable to satisfy thy
Justice for the least of our sins past, seeing, if thou look upon us with
thy pure eyes, our best righteousness will appear like a polluted cloth, so
mingled with our imperfections, and stained with our corruptions, that it
cannot challenge any other reward as its due, but thy displeasure and
everlasting death. O Lord, we humbly beseech thee, let us not securely rest
and please our selves in this our woeful condition, but having a lively sense
and feeling of our sin and misery, let us labor above all things to be freed
from it. And seeing there is no name in heaven or earth, whereby we may be
saved, but by Jesus Christ alone, thine only Son and blessed Redeemer, whom
thou have purposely sent into the world to save sinners; O Lord, let us
renounce our selves and all creatures in heaven and earth, as being utterly
insufficient to satisfy thy Justice, and save our souls, and let us rest upon
him alone, hungring and thirsting after his righteousness, and desiring above
all things that we may be found in him. And for his sake we humbly beseech
thee to magnify thy mercies in the free forgiveness of all our sins: and as
they in their weight and number do exceedingly abound, so let thy grace abound
much more in their forgiveness. Enter not into judgment with thy servants;
for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. We are not able to answer
unto thy Justice one of a thousand, but Christ our surety has paid our debt,
and now as our Advocate pleads for us, that by him thou have thy due, and
that thy Justice shall sustain no loss in setting us free, seeing he has
made full satisfaction for us. Hear him then, dear God, thus pleading for us;
Hear us, holy Father, in his mediation pleading for our selves; forgive us all
our debts, and cancel the handwriting by which we were obliged, that it may
never be produced in judgment against us. Contrariwise, we beseech thee,
write the new covenant of grace, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy
tables of our hearts, and not only enrole the great Charter of our peace in
the volume of the Book, containing in it the glad tidings of the Gospel, but
ingrosse and ingraue it in the book of our consciences, by the finger of thy
Spirit, that we may with inestimable joy daily peruse it, when we have it in
our own custody. And not only work in us this peace, in our assured freedom
from the guilt of all our sins, but also inward and outward purity in our
souls and bodies, by bathing and washing them in the blood of Christ from all
sinful corruption: And sanctify us throughout, that our whole spirit, and
soul, and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ: make us in him more then conquerours over all the enemies of our
salvation, and spiritual Kings reigning especially over our corruptions, that
they may not by their might and malice disturb our peace. Revive us more and
more with the Spirit of Grace and power; that we may walk with cheerefulnes in
the ways of thy commandments, performing throughout the whole course of our
lives, all Christian duties of holiness, righteousness and sobriety. Indue us
plentifully with all sanctifying and saving graces, and let us bring forth the
fruits of them all in our new obedience, with all sincerity and vprightnes of
heart. Open our blind eyes, that we may see the wonderful things of thy law;
increase our faith, that the gates of hell may not preuail against it; preserve
us from carnal security and hardness of heart; and as we daily renew our
sins, so let us daily renew our repentance and sorrow for them. Confirm our
affiance in the assurance of thy power and love, strengthen our hope, work our
hearts to thy fear, inflame them with thy love, and with fervent zeal of thy
glory; give us humility, patience, and spiritual rejoicing in the assurance of
thy favor, even in our afflictions and tribulations. Make us zealous of good
works, that we may approve our faith by the fruits of it, and let us never
be weary of well-doing. Arm us against all the assaults of our spiritual
enemies, against the fear of death and judgment; to which end let us keep
always our accounts even, that we may not be loath to be called to a reckoning.
Prepare us for the days of affliction and persecution, that we may be ready
with wisdom, constancy and courage, not only to do, but also suffer all
things for thy sake. Accept, with these our suits and prayers, our praises and
thanksgiving for thy manifold blessings and benefits, both corporal,
spiritual and eternal; for thy inestimable love, and that singular pledge
thereof, thy dear and only Son, whom thou have given unto us to work that
great work of our Redemption; for our being, and well-being, all thy graces in
this life, and assured hope of glory and happiness in the life to come. For
our continual preservation in the whole course of our lives, this night past,
and this day hitherto; for our quiet rest, and all other comforts of this life.
For all which, and all other thy mercies, thy blessed name be praised and
magnified. We beseech thee (good Lord) continue thy mercy and love toward us
in the whole course of our lives; and namely, in the residue of this day watch
over us with thy gracious providence, and thereby preserve us from all sin
and danger, and so rule all our thoughts, words and deeds, that being holy and
righteous, they may be acceptable in thy sight. Let us so spend this day in thy
fear, as though it were the last day of our lives; and let us, with all care
and watchfulness, so arm our selves against all the tentations of our
spiritual enemies, as that they may not prevail against us to make us
slothful in thy service. Finally, give unto us all things necessary for our
souls and bodies, and so sanctify all thy blessings to our use, that they may
be helps and furtherances unto us in seeking thy glory, and our own salvation.
Vouchsafe these, and all other blessings, not only unto us, but also to thy
whole Church, and every member thereof, as if particularly we had named them,
and so join us in the holy communion of grace, as that we may for ever enjoy
the communion and fellowship of thy blessed Saints and Angels in the Kingdom
of glory. Hear us, and help us, O God of our salvation, in all these our
suits, for thy Son and our Savior Jesus Christ his sake; to whom with thee
and thy holy Spirit, one true and everlasting God, we ascribe the glory and
praise of all goodness and perfection both now and evermore. Amen.

A Prayer for the Family in the Evening.
O Lord our God, most high and holy, most dreadful and glorious in thy might
and Majesty unto all creatures, terrible and like a consuming fire unto all
impenitent sinners; but a most gracious and loving Father unto all those, who
are reconciled unto thee in Jesus Christ. Thou have commanded us to call upon
thee in all our necessities, and have encouraged us hereunto by thy most
gracious and free promise, that where two or three are gathered together in the
name of thy Son, there thou will be present amongst them by thy holy Spirit,
to hear their suits, and relieve their wants. In obedience to which
Commandment, and in some assurance of thy gracious promise, we thy poor and
unworthy servants, do here, in the mediation of Jesus Christ, humbly
prostrate our selves before thy Throne of grace and mercy, acknowledging our
selves guilty of innumerable sins, and thereby liable to as many fearful
punishments; but yet in the merits of thy Son, and in the truth of thy
promises, pleading for pardon and forgiveness. We confess unto thee, that we
were conceived and borne in sin, having all the faculties and powers of our
souls and bodies so wholly defiled with original corruption, that we are
utterly disabled for thy service, and prone unto all manner of wickedness; and
have, in the whole course of our lives, multiplied against thee our actual
transgressions, by breaking thy whole Law, and every Commandment thereof, in
thought, word, and deed. We are naturally full of ignorance and blindness of
mind, neither knowing thee, nor thy truth, and after that thou have caused the
light of the Gospel to shine unto us for many years, our minds are still full
of darkness. We content our selves with a small measure of knowledge, and
continue children in understanding, when we should be of ripe age, not striving
after more perfection; neither according to the measure of our means, are we
rich in knowledge, and in the fruits of new obedience. We are full of
infidelity and doubting, and negligent in the use of the means, whereby our
faith should be confirmed and strengthened; and are full also of impenitency,
security and hardness of heart, and do both seldom and slightly bewail our
sins past, and but weakly and inconstantly resolve and endeavor to amend our
lives for the time to come. We are ready to trust in the creature, more then in
thee the Creator, and cannot, as we ought, rest upon thy power and promises in
the absence of inferior means. We are apt to forget thee, when thou most
remembrest us, and the more that we abound with thy blessings, the less
mindful we are of thee from whom we have received them. We have loved the
world and earthly things, more then thee and heavenly excellencies, and have
preferred the pleasures of sin, before thy love and favor, being ready to
hazard these, rather then to forgo them. We are full of self-love, and have
been moved hereby to sow unto the flesh, of which we can reap nothing but sin
and punishment; and have set our hearts so much upon carnal vanities, that
they easily draw them away from thee. We do not patiently and constantly hope
and wait for the accomplishment of thy promises, though we have great
experience of thy power, truth and goodness toward us. We are cold or
lukewarm in our zeal, and have not with any feruency advanced the means of
thy glory, nor removed the impediments whereby it is hindered. Our rejoicing is
more in the flesh then in the Spirit; in worldly things and the pleasures of
sin, more then in thee the Fountain of all true joy; in the fruition of thy
present favors, and expectation of heavenly happiness. We are ungrateful
unto thee for thy manifold benefits, and oftentimes when we praise thee, it is
with our lips only, and not with inward joy and cheerfulness of our hearts.
We do not approve our love and thankfulness unto thee by our fruits of
obedience; but have been negligent in the duties of holiness and
righteousness, that we might give glory to thy holy Name, and all we do, is
maimed and imperfect, full of wants and weaknesses, and stained with many
corruptions. We are ready to murmr and repine in our least afflictions, and
do not bear thy fatherly corrections with patience and thankfulness, being
more sensible of the smart, then of our sins which have caused it; and
looking more to the rod, then unto thy hand, which thereby chastizest us for
our amendment. We do not fear to displease thee by our sins, nor avoid
thine anger as the greatest evil; or if we do fear thee at all, it is not so
much for thy mercies, as to avoid thy Judgments. We have not adorned our
selves with humility and meekness, in the sight and sense of our own
vileness and unworthiness; but are full of spiritual pride, arrogating unto
our selves those gifts we have not, and ouerweening those we have, or ascribing
the praise of them unto our selves, which is only due to thee. We are
negligent in the duties of thy service, and do not perform them in Spirit and
truth, but either neglect them upon every slight occasion, or do them without
due preparation, coldly and formally, without any feruency of zeal, respecting
thy glory, or our spiritual good. We have often taken thy holy Name in vain,
and abused thine holy ordinances, and profaned thy Sabbaths, not doing thy
will only on thy holy Day, but speaking our own words, walking in our own
ways, and seeking our own carnal delights. We have also neglected the duties
of righteousness, charity and mercy toward our neighbors, and of temperance
and sobriety toward our selves. By all which, and many other our sins, we
have made our selves subject to thy wrath and the curse of the Law, and have
justly deserved to be deprived of all testimonies of thy love, and to be
overwhelmed with all thy judgments and punishments, both in this life, and the
life to come. O Lord our God, affect our hearts with sonne-like sorrow, because
we have so much and often displeased thee our gracious Father; and let us be
grieved in our souls, that we are so little grieved for our sins, whereby
we have pierced our Savior, and grieved thy good Spirit dwelling in us. And
further, we beseech thee, in the multitude of thy mercies, to remit and
forgive all our sins, and wash us clean from the guilt and punishment of
them all, that they may neither deprive us of thy love and manifold blessings
temporal and eternal, nor expose us to thy wrath and fearful punishments.
And not only remit our sins, and heal our souls, but speak comfortably to
our consciences, by the secret voice of thy Spirit, as once thy Son did to
the sick of the palsy, Sons, be of good comfort, your sins are forgiven
you. Strengthen our weak faith in the assurance of thy love, and the remission
of our sins, and let us labor earnestly in the use of all good means,
whereby it may be more and more increased and confirmed, that so without
wavering and doubting we may apply Christ unto us with all his benefits, and
thy gracious promises made in him. Let us not weaken and wound it with sins
committed against our knowledge and consciences, but nourish it by bringing
forth the fruits of obedience in a godly life. Assure us that we are thy
children by adoption and grace, and heirs of that heavenly inheritance
reserved for thy Saints, and let us approve our selves to be so, by demeaning
our selves in all things as it beseems thy Sons. Let us love, reverence,
and obey thee our heavenly Father, and think all too little which we can do
or suffer for thy sake, that thereby we may express our love toward thee. Let
us, above all things, be zealous of thy glory, rejoicing when it is magnified,
and grieuing when it is neglected either by our selves or others. Let us not
hazard our heavenly inheritance, by wilful sinning for the gayning of the
whole world, but let us labor to make our calling and election sure, and work
out our salvation with fear and trembling. Give unto us peace of a good
conscience, and replenish our hearts with spiritual joy in the assurance of
thy favor. Let us undoubtedly expect the performance of al thy gracious
promises made in Christ, even when thou seem to delay them, especially that
main promise of everlasting life and happiness; and having this hope, let us
daily purge our selves, as he also is pure. But especially give us grace, that
we may bring forth the fruits of our faith, in true, hearty, and unfeigned
repentance; bewayling our sins past, hating our present corruptions which
still hang upon us, and both purposing and seriously indeuouring to leave and
forsake our sins, and to serve thee in holiness and righteousness all the
days of our lives. Let us not defer our repentance from day to day, but
seeing the necessity thereof unto salvation, let us lay hold of the acceptable
time, and whilst it is called to day, let us not harden our hearts, but turn
unto thee with all our souls. Let us, as we daily renew our sins, renew also
our faith and repentance, and have an earnest and serious study of pleasing
thee in all things. Let us not content our selves with a small measure of
repentance, seeing our sins are many and grievous, but let us aspire to the
highest perfection, hating sin with a perfect hatred, and bewayling it with
bitter grief. Finally, let us constantly persevere in the practice of
repentance, and having begun in it, let us continue it to the very end of our
lives. And as we beg these benefits at thy hands, so we yield unto thee
most humble and hearty thanks, for all thy mercies and favors vouchsafed unto
us, especially for all thy spiritual graces concerning eternal life, and
above all, for that inestimable pledge of thy love, thy dear and only Son,
whom thou have given to the death, that he might free us from all our
spiritual enemies, and purchase for us everlasting happiness. We praise
thee, for that thou have watched over us with thy gracious providence, in the
whole course of our lives, and namely, this day past, preserving us from all
dangers, and furnishing us with all necessaries, and blessing us in all our
labors and endeavors. We beseech thee, holy Father, to continue with our
thankfulness, thy love toward us and care over us. Take us this night into
thy gracious protection, and watch over us with thy providence, waking and
sleeping, and thereby preserve us from all perils and dangers, and from the
malice and fury of all our enemies spiritual and temporal, especially of that
raging and roaring Lion, the devil, who seeks all advantages to work our
destruction. Let us not sleep, like others, the sleep of sin, which
brings death, but let us still keep the spiritual watch, that we may
always be prepared for the day of death and Judgment, and have our accounts
continually in readiness, that when we are called to a reckoning, we may
with comfort appear before our Judge. Preserve us in the dark from the works
of darkness, and let us day and night behave our selves as in thy sight and
presence, making no less conscience of secret sins, then of those which are
open and manifest. Let us, whilst our bodies rest, have our minds exercised
with holy and heavenly Meditations, and let them be so seasoned with thy
grace, and guided by thy good Spirit, that they may not in our sleep give way
to sinful thoughts and vain imaginations. Give unto us such quiet and
moderate rest, that our bodies may thereby be refreshed, and their decayed
strength repaired; and so bless and sanctify our sleep unto us, that it may
be a means of preserving our health, and of making us more fit for all duties
of thy service. Hear us, gracious God, in all these our suites, and vouchsafe
these and all other blessings which in thy wisdom thou know needful, not
only unto us, but also to all thy children and servants, and especially such
as be of this Church, the Magistrates, Ministers, and whole people, even for
Jesus Christ his sake; In whose Name and words we conclude our prayers, as he
himself has taught us, saying, Our Father, which art in heaven, etc.

Another Prayer for the Family in the Evening.
O Immortal, invisible, and only true God, most wise, mighty, just, and
merciful, holy and infinite in all perfection, Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and in him our most gracious and loving Father: Thou have in thy Word
invited sinners to come unto thee, promising that if we confess and forsake
our sins, we shall find mercy; if we lay them open, thou will hide them;
and if we acknowledge and bewail them, thou will show thy self faithful and
righteous in forgiving them: we thy unworthy servants, being laden with sin
and misery, do here humble our selves before thee, and in the mediation of
Jesus Christ, prostrate our selves before the Throne of grace, suing unto thee
for mercy and forgiveness. We confess unto thee, holy Father, that we are by
nature dead in trespasses and sins, and the children of wrath as well as
others, loaded with the guilt, both of that corruption in which we were
conceived, and of innumerable actual transgressions, whereby we have violated
thy whole Law, and so made our selves subject to the curse thereof, and
everlasting death of body and soul. The which our sin and misery is much
aggrauated, in that we have long lived without any sense of it, or any desire
to be freed from it, but took all our delight in displeasing thy Majesty, and
in performing cheerful service unto sin and Satan. Yea, Lord, after that
thou of thy free grace have given us a sight of our misery, and have pulled us
out of this wretched thraldom, working in us some desires, resolutions, and
endeavors to serve and please thee, we confess that the relics of sin do
still remain in us in great strength; and howsoever the old man and body of
sin, have by thy holy Spirit received their deadly wound, yet have they in
them such life and strength, and are so animated and revived with the
suggestions of our old adversary the devil, breathing (as it were) a new life
into them, that they do still much vex and trouble us, making continual
war against our souls, and oftentimes leading them captive unto sin. Much
blindness and vanity do still remain in our minds, so that we have but a
dim sight of thee, and thy will and ways. Our memories are weak and
slippery, and, like riuen vessels, let the precious liquor of the Word of life
and grace run out, as soon as it is put into them. Our consciences are
defiled and impure, loaded with the guilt of sin, and yet oftentimes
senseless of their burden. Our judgments are full of error and ignorance,
and very weak in spiritual discerning. Our wills perverse and obstinate in
evil, and very auerse and awke to good things, and do not incline to the
doing of thy will with cheerfulness and delight. Our hearts remain still
hard and full of carnal security, intractable and inflexible, and do not
relent and melt, either with thy mercies or judgments. We are still assaulted
with much doubting and infidelity, and our faith is often shaken with dangerous
tentations. Our repentance is weak, and full of wants; our sorrow for sin
slight, and soon over, and our resolutions and endeavors to amend, subject to
much inconstancy, and broken off with every small impediment. There is much
poison of corruption still remaining in our affections, which draws us from
thee, when we sell our selves to seek and serve thee, unto the world, and
earthly things. We are still full of carnal self-love and love of the world,
which quenches and cools in us the love of thee, and of spiritual and
heavenly things; our affiance in thee is weak, and after much experience of
thy power and sufficiency, goodness and truth, we can hardly trust thee,
unless we have inferior means and helps, as pawnes in our hands, and we
are too too prone to rely upon the creatures, and our own policies and
strength; our hopes are faint and wavering, one while inclining toward
presumption, and soon after forsaking us, endanger us to despair. We
oftentimes fear men, and neglect thee, and hazard thy love, to avoid their
displeasure. Our zeal is lukewarm, in seeking thy glory, and our devotion
cold in holy duties. There still remains in us, much pride, hypocrisy,
impatiencie, unjust anger, covetousness, voluptuousness, and all other
sinful lusts, which continually fight and strive against the good motions of
thy holy Spirit, and oftentimes overcome, and quench them. And notwithstanding
that the flesh and the corrupt lusts thereof do still remain so strong in us,
yet we acknowledge to our shame, that we are careless and negligent in
fighting against them, and in using those good means whereby we might be
enabled to subdue them, and to purge our hearts from these carnal corruptions:
whereof it is, that residing in us in great vigor and strength, they disable
us in doing the good we would, and make us to do the evil we would not,
oftentimes wholly hinder us from the duties of thy service, and oftentimes so
disturb and distract us in them, that we perform them with much weakness and
weariness, with great dullness and deadness of heart and spirit; and whilst
we are delighted in thy Law in the inner man, this Law of our members
rebelling against the law of our minds, leads us captive to the law of
sin. O wretched men that we are, who shall deliver us from the body of this
death! Gracious God, we beseech thee, give us more and more a lively sense and
feeling of these our wants and imperfections, frailties and corruption, that we
may wholly deny and disclaim our selves and our own righteousness in the
work of our justification and salvation, to the end that we may entirely rest
upon thine infinite mercies and the all-sufficient merits and perfect obedience
of Jesus Christ. For whose sake we most humbly beseech thee to pardon
graciously all our wants and weaknesses, covering our imperfections with his
most perfect righteousness, and washing away all our sinful corruptions in his
most precious blood. Yea, Lord, forgive and forget for his sake not only our
errors and infirmities, but also those manifold and grievous sins, which we
have committed against thee in the whole course of our lives, whether in the
days of our ignorance, or since we attained the knowledge of thy truth: wash
them all away in the blood of Christ, and heal our souls with that sovereign
salve of sin, which is as sufficient to cure deep and deadly wounds, as
small sores and slight scratches. Yea, Lord, not only remit and forgive us all
our sins, but let us also have comfort and peace in our consciences in the
assurance of our pardon, through the infallible testimony of thy holy Spirit;
and thereby sanctify us thorowout, that we may deuote and consecrate both our
souls and bodies wholly to thy worship and service. Mortify our corrupt flesh
with the lusts thereof, and let them have no longer dominion in us. Yea, holy
Father, not only lop the branches of our corruptions, but pull them up by the
very root, and not only wound and weaken the Old man and body of sin, but
kill and crucify, destroy and abolish it in thy good time, that no relics of
it may remain in us, to disturb our peace, and distract us in thy service.
Quicken us with the Spiritual life of grace, that being made strong and
vigorous, we may courageously overcome all lets and difficulties, which oppose
us in our Christian course, and may perform unto thee all duties of piety,
righteousness and sobriety all the days of our lives, with all cheerfulness
and delight. Let thy Spirit dwelling in us, replenish our hearts and souls
with all sanctifying and saving graces. Inlighten our minds with a sound,
saving and experimental knowledge of thee and thy Truth, and let us draw
whatsoever we know into use and practice. Take away from us our natural
doubting and infidelity, and work in us a true, lively and justifying faith,
that we may apply unto us all thy gracious promises made in Christ, and rest
only upon his merits and thy mercies, for our justification and salvation.
Give us hearty and unfeigned repentance for our sins, that, we may not only
bewail them with godly grief, but also leave and forsake them, and serve thee
in holiness and newness of life. Confirm our affiance in thee, and let us
firmly resolve, that though thou should kill us, yet we will still trust in
thee. Let us confidently expect the performance of all thy gracious promises
with a lively hope, and still wait upon thee when thou seem to defer thy
help. Let us have a sensible feeling of thy love, shed abroad in our hearts by
thy holy Spirit, that being inflamed thereby, we may love thee again with all
our souls and strength, and all others in and for thee. Let this fire of holy
love show, and approve it self by the flame and heat of godly zeal, in
seeking thy glory in and above all things, fervently, yet wisely and
discreetly, opposing whatsoever hinders it, and furthering all the means
whereby it is furthered. Work thy fear in our hearts, and let us stand in awe
of thee, not only for thy Judgments, but also for thy mercies, abhorring
nothing more then thy displeasure, who have ever been unto us so gracious and
good a Father. Give us grace to yield unto thee all sonne-like and true
obedience, both by doing that which thou enioynest, and suffering that which
thou imposest. Adorn us with meekness and humility, and let us be base in
our own eyes, that we may be precious in thy sight. Replenish our hearts with
Spiritual joy in the assurance of thy love and our salvation, that nothing may
dant or dampe it; and stablish us with thy free Spirit, that we may never fall
from thee, but may persevere in the profession and practice of true godliness,
till death summoneth us to Judgment. Let us be just toward all, and merciful
toward the poor and afflicted, still abounding in all good works, and make
us temperate, sober and thankful in the use of all thy blessings, that they
may further, and not hinder us in all Christian duties. And as we implore thy
goodness for those things which we want, so with thankful hearts and voices,
we praise and magnify thy great and glorious Name for all thy mercies and
favors vouchsafed unto us, respecting either this life or the life to come.
And namely, for preserving our lives, and blessing our labors; for releeuing
our wants, and defending us from danger this day past. We beseech thee unto the
multitude of thy other graces, add this with the rest, that we may make right
use of them, for the stirring up of our thankfulness, and inflaming of our
hearts with thy love. O Lord, be still gracious unto us, and now receive our
bodies and souls into thy hand this night, that they may be safe in thy
keeping from all evil both of sin and punishment; and as we cease from the
works of our callings, so much more let us rest from all works of darkness,
with a full purpose never again to undertake them. Give us comfortable and
quiet sleep, that our spirits being thereby refreshed, and our strength
renewed, we may be the fitter to serve thee in the general duties of
Christianity, and the special duties of our callings. Let not our sleep
break off our spiritual watch, but let us still be in readiness for the
glorious appearing of Jesus Christ. When we wake, let us wake with thee,
lifting up our hearts and souls in holy and heavenly Meditations, and praising
thee for all thy goodness. Together with us, bless thy whole Church, this in
which we live, our sovereign Lord and King, our Noble Prince, the Prince and
Princess Palatine, the Council, Magistrates, and Ministers, those which are
afflicted, and thy whole people, beseeching thee in our several places, to
give us whatsoever thou know needful for us, for Jesus Christ's sake: to
whom with thee and thy holy Spirit, we ascribe all glory and praise both now
and evermore. Amen.

A Prayer for the Lords Day in the Morning.
O Lord our God, glorious in Majesty, omnipotent in power, infinite in all
goodness and perfection, and our most gracious Father in Jesus Christ, who
have created all things of nothing for thine own glory, and man especially for
thine own service; the which he is bound to perform both by the right of
creation, wherein thou have vouchsafed unto him his being; and of Redemption,
whereby thou have given unto him his wel-being, by restoring him to that estate
of blessedness which he had lost by his sins. But yet in a more especial manner
ought this service to be performed on thine own peculiar Day, which thou have
appropriated to thy worship, and consecrated to an holy rest, both by thy
commandment, and also thine own example. We thine unprofitable servants, and
utterly unworthy of these high and holy privileges, do here present our
selves before thee, desiring, and in some poor measure indeuouring to
sanctify this Day of rest, and to glorify thee by performing, as we are able,
such duties of thy service as thou requirest. Howbeit, we must needs
acknowledge, to thy glory and our own shame, that we have utterly disabled our
selves unto them by our manifold and grievous sins. For through our natural
corruption, thy Sabbaths, which should be our delight, are become tedious and
unpleasant; thy service, which should be our meat and drink, and even the very
life of our life, and joy of our hearts, is become so loathsome and distasteful
to our carnal appetite, that either we utterly neglect it, or else perform it
after a cold and careless manner, with much dullness, drowzines, and irksome
weariness. Our wisdom is enmity against thee, and our understandings dull in
conceiving spiritual things, our thoughts and imaginations so wholly carried
away with earthly vanities, that when they should be wholly intent unto
spiritual exercises, they roue and wander after worldly trifles. Our
consciences are so loaded with dead works and the guilt of our sins, that they
weaken our faith in applying thy promises, and deprive us of that confidence
and comfort which we should otherwise have in our praying and hearing. Our
memories are like riuen vessels, which suffer the precious liquor of thy Word
to run out without use or profit. Our wills are so stubborn and rebellious,
that we cannot submit to thine holy Ordinances, but resist both the outward
ministry of thy Word, and the inward motions of thy holy Spirit. Our hearts are
so hardened with the deceitfulness of sin, that they are not easily mollified
with thy sweet promises and gracious benefits, nor terrified and broken with
thy threatenings and righteous Judgments. Our affections are so wholly corrupted
and disordred, that they are wholly set upon worldly things; and little love and
delight in thee and thy saving truth, in thy service and Sabbaths, do we
feel in our dead hearts, in comparison of that fervor of affection, which we
sensibly perceive in the pleasures of sin, and worldly delights. And with
this corruption of our sinful souls, our bodies likewise are so tainted and
infected, that they are altogether indisposed unto thy service, and exceeding
dead and lumpish in the performance of all holy and Religious duties. From
which total corruption of our natures, have issued and sprung those
innumerable numbers of actual transgressions, whereby we have broken thy whole
Law, and every Commandment thereof in thought, word and deed. But especially
we acknowledge our fearful neglect of the duties of thy service, and our
weak and imperfect performances, when we have undertaken them; our profanation
of thy Sabbaths, and abuse of thine holy Ordinances; our little profiting by
those plentiful means of our salvation, which for a long time thou have
graciously affoorded us, either for the increasing of saving knowledge, the
strengthening of our faith, or bringing forth fruits of new obedience; our want
of faith and feruency of spirit in calling upon thy Name; our want of reverence
and attention in hearing thy Word; our many distractions and wandering thoughts;
our want of care to treasure it up in our hearts, and of conscience to make an
holy use of it in our lives and conuersations. By all which and innumerable
other sins, we acknowledge (good Lord) that we have justly deserved to be
deprived of all means of our salvation, and that thou should take away from
us the food of our souls, and cause them to perish through Spiritual famine;
or that thou should turn our meat into poison, and make it to become the
savor of death to our deeper condemnation, which in it own nature is the
savor of life unto life, and thine own strong power unto salvation. But we
beseech thee (good Lord) for thy Sons sake, to be gracious unto us in the
free pardon of these and all other our sins; and seeing he has fully
satisfied thy Justice, by that all-sufficient sacrifice, which he has once
offered upon his Cross, be reconciled unto us in him, and cleanse us thoroughly
from the guilt and punishment of all our sins, that they may not be as a wall
of separation to stop from us thy blessings, nor as strong chains to pull
down upon us thy judgments and punishments, either in this world, or in the
world to come. And being thus freed from all our sins, let us deuote our
selves wholly to thy service: which that we may perform with greater
cheerfulness and diligence, let us have the comfortable assurance of this thy
mercy in the remission of our sins, sealed in our hearts by thy good Spirit,
witnessing unto us that we are thy children by adoption and grace. And thereby
not only seal us up unto the Day of our Redemption, but also sanctify us
throughout in our bodies and souls, by the mortification of the flesh, and our
spiritual quickening in the inner man, that we may, in the whole course of
our lives, serve and please thee. But in a more especial manner we beseech
thee (good Lord) to sanctify us, that we may sanctify this thy Sabbath; and
assist us by thy grace and holy Spirit, that we may so perform the religious
duties of thy service, as that we may be made more holy, and enabled unto the
leading of such a Christian life as may be acceptable in thy sight. Take away
from us the corruption of our natures, whereby we are made backward and untoward
to the duties of thy service, and make us willing to sequester our selves from
all worldly affairs, that we may wholly be employed in them. Let us rejoice in
thy Sabbaths, as being the time of our spiritual refection, and the market of
our souls, and let us not rest in a formal keeping of them, but perform the
duties required in them, with all care and good conscience, not only in the
outward man, but with our hearts and souls, in spirit and truth. Free us from
carnal wearines, as thinking the time long till they be past: but knowing that
time to be best spent which is employed in thy service, let us take most
comfort and contentment in it. Enable us (good Lord) by private preparation to
fit our selves for thy public service, meditating on our wants, that we may
use all good means whereby they may be supplied, and on our special sins and
corruptions, that we may get spiritual strength against them, and imploring the
assistance of thy good Spirit, that we may be enabled thereby to perform, in
an holy manner, all duties which thou requirest. Let us keep an holy Rest unto
thee, and abstain not only from the ordinary works of our callings and
worldly affairs, but also from all carnal pleasures and sensual delights.
Suffer not our thoughts to be taken up with worldly or wicked cogitations, but
let our minds be exercised in spiritual and heavenly meditations. Set a watch
before our mouths, that we may not, on thine holy Day, speak our own words,
nor utter any idle, vain, worldly or wicked speeches; but let our tongues
speak to thy praise, and be exercised in holy and religious conferences,
tending to the mutual edification one of another. Let us not content our
selves with a mere cessation from our labors, but refer this Rest to
holiness, as the maine end thereof, without which the outward rest is but
vain; and with the external, let us join the internal rest from sin,
exercising our selves in repentance from dead works. Make us careful in using
all good means which thou have ordained for the sanctifying of thy Day, both
publicly and privately, and let us, with one heart and voice, join with the
rest of the Congregation in all the parts of thy service. Enable all thy
Ministers in all places, and him especially to whose charge thou have committed
us, that they may break unto us the Bread of life, and rightly divide thy Word
for our spiritual nourishment. Furnish them with all gifts and graces
necessary for their high calling, and let them deliver thy truth as in thy
presence, faithfully and powerfully, truly and sincerely, and so assist them
with the inward working of thine holy Spirit, that thy Word may be effectual
for the conversion, edification and salvation of their hearers. Enable us by
the same Spirit, to call upon thee with faith and feruency, and with all love
and thankfulness to praise thee for all thy blessings vouchsafed unto us. Let us
with all due reverence and attention hear thy Word, lay it up in our hearts and
memories, and bring forth the fruits of it in our lives and conuersations. Give
us grace also (O Lord) to sanctify thy Sabbaths privately, by performing by
our selves, and in our own families, those private duties which are specially
required on this thy Day. Let us meditate on thy Word after we have heard it,
and apply it unto our selves for our own use. Let us meditate on thy
marvelous works of Creation, Preservation and Redemption; but especially on
the death and Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, that they may be effectual
to mortify our sins, and to quicken us unto newnes of life. Let us spend our
time in religious exercises, and in the works of charity and mercy, as being
those sacrifices wherein thou most delightest; but especially in those
spiritual duties which tend to the salvation of our own and others souls,
taking care not only to sanctify thine holy Day our selves, but, as much as
in us lies, that it may be sanctified by all those who any ways belong to our
charge. Accept of our praise and thanksgiving for all thy blessings and
benefits, both spiritual and temporal, which thou have multiplied upon us,
and continue them unto us this day and ever, preserving us from all perils, and
furnishing us with all necessaries, that we may be the fitter with all
cheerfulness to do thee service: And vouchsafe all these blessings which we
have craved for our selves, with all other things which in thy wisdom thou
see needful, unto every true member of thy Church, etc. even for Jesus Christ
his sake, to whom with thee and thine holy Spirit, we ascribe all praise and
glory, power and dominion, both now, and for evermore. Amen.

A Prayer for the Evening of the Lords Day.
O Eternal God, who art glorious in Majesty and power, and of infinite
goodness and mercy unto all those who are reconciled unto thee in thy Son;
we thine unworthy servants, having nothing else to return unto thee for the
innumerable testimonies of thy love, which with a bountiful hand thou have
multiplied upon us, do here offer unto thee the sacrifice of praise and
thanksgiving for all thy blessings and benefits, which either respect our
souls or bodies; this life, or the life to come. More especially, we laud and
magnify thy great and glorious Name, for that thou have loved us from all
eternity, and of thy mere grace, without any respect of our worthiness, have
made us vessels of grace by thy free election, created us according to thine
own Image, redeemed us out of the hands of all our spiritual enemies, by
giving thy dearly beloved Son to dye for us, when as we were strangers and
enemies; for calling us by thy Word and Spirit, to the saving knowledge, and
effectual participation of him and all his benefits; for our justification by
his obedience, our sanctification by thy Spirit, and for that assurance which
thou have given us of a better life in the world to come. For all temporal
benefits, as health, wealth, peace, plenty, preservation from dangers, and
protection from all our enemies, both worldly and spiritual. And especially,
we praise and glorify thee, for vouchsafing unto us, in such a gracious
manner, the means of our salvation; for our blessed opportunities and
liberties, with peace and safety in sanctifying thy Sabbaths, publicly and
privately, by hearing thy Word, and calling upon thy Name, and performing other
duties of thy service, that thereby we may glorify thee, and make our own
calling and election sure; and for giving unto us hearts, wherein, by thy
Spirit, thou have wrought some poor desires and endeavors, to make use of
these thy benefits, for the enriching of our souls with all spiritual graces,
as at other times heretofore, so namely, this day past. O that our souls could
be ravished with the sweet apprehension of such inestimable blessings! O that
we could exceed all others in love and thankfulness, as far as we exceed
them in these high and holy privileges, and were able to express them in our
careful and conscionable endeavors to glorify and please thee in all things,
who have been so gracious and good unto us! But alas, how unworthy have we made
our selves of the least of these thy benefits, by our manifold and grievous
sins; both our original corruption, which having ouer-spred all the powers
and parts of our souls and bodies, has utterly disabled them unto all duties
of thy service; and our manifold actual transgressions, which in number and
weight exceed all things but thy mercies, which are above all thy works, and
the merits and satisfaction of thy Son, which are of infinite worth and
value? More especially, we humbly acknowledge our fearful abuse of those great
privileges and means of our salvation, which for a long time thou have
graciously granted unto us. For not only have we, in the days of our
ignorance, utterly neglected all duties of thy service, spending our whole
strength in the miserable slavery of sin and Satan, and profaned and
misspent thy Sabbaths, in pleasing our carnal lusts, and performing the
works of darkness, in greater measure, and worse manner then any other days
besides; but even since we have been called to the knowledge of thy truth, and
have consecrated our selves to thy service, we have either upon slight
occasions neglected those holy duties of thy public and private worship, or
performed them with many wants and weaknesses, discovering unto thee who
searchest the heart, many imperfections and great corruptions. For we have not
remembered thy Sabbaths, nor with fervent desires longed after thine holy Day.
We have not delighted in them, nor consecrated them unto thee as an holy Rest;
but though the spirit has been willing, yet the flesh has been weak, and
soon tired with spiritual exercises. We have been much defective in our zeal
and devotion, and have been too too cold and formal in religious duties, and
have not performed them with that care and conscience, nor have served thee
with our hearts and souls, in spirit and truth, in that degree which thou
requirest; but externally and with the outward man, having in the mean while
our minds and hearts carried away with many distractions and worldly
imaginations. Our cogitations have not bin taken wholly up with spiritual and
heavenly things, but we have suffered them to roue and wander after earthly
trifles. Our tongues have not, in that measure as they ought, been exercised in
setting forth thy praise, nor in such holy and religious conferences as tend to
the edification one of another: but we have spoken our own words on thine holy
Day, and many of our speeches have been idle and vain, worldly and unsavory.
We have not, as we ought, privately prepared and fitted our selves for thy
public service, by prayer and meditation, and by renewing our faith and
repentance; but have come into thy glorious presence without due fear and
reverence, having our hearts clogged and choked with many corruptions, which
have disabled them to the duties of thy service, and have made them like
vnfallowed and vnweeded grounds, unfit to receive the seed of thy Word. We have
not called upon thy Name with faith and feruency of spirit, nor given thanks
unto thee for all thy benefits, with such cheerfulnes as became us. We have
not, with due reverence and attention, heard thy holy Word, nor laid it up in
our memories, nor applied it to our hearts and consciences, nor made an holy
use of it, by putting it in practice in our lives and conuersations. We have
not meditated, as we ought, on thy Word which we have heard, nor on thy
marvelous works of Creation, Preservation and Redemption, nor diligently read
and studied in thy holy Book, nor exercised our selves in the works of mercy
and Christian charity toward our brethren, in that manner and measure which
thou requirest, especially in those spiritual duties which tend to the mutual
edification of one another. In which, and many other kinds, as we have often
offended heretofore, so we cannot excuse our selves of many imperfections and
corruptions which we have showed this day past, in all the duties of thy
service which we have performed unto thee. But seeing we do acknowledge our
wants and weaknesses, and do bewail them with unfeigned sorrow, we beseech
thee (dear God) accept of us in Jesus Christ, according to thy gracious
promises, covering all our imperfections with his most perfect obedience, and
washing away our corruptions in that pure Fountain of his precious blood. In
him accept of our poor desires and endeavors to do thee service; seeing what
is wanting in us, is abundantly supplied by his absolute and all-sufficient
righteousness, which is made ours by faith. And that we may, for the time to
come, perform service unto thee with more diligence and cheerfulness, let thy
Spirit witness unto our spirit, that thou have forgiven all our sins past,
passed by and covered all our infirmities and frailties, and do graciously
accept of us in thy Best-beloued. And with the same thine holy Spirit, prosper
and perfect thine own good work of grace and sanctification which thou have
begun in us. Thou see (Lord) how we are hampered and fettered in the chains
of our corruptions, which so distract and hinder us in all holy duties, that we
perform them with much discouragement, and little joy. Help us, O God of our
salvation, and break in sunder these chains of sin, that being set at
liberty, we may, with all alacrity and delight, run the way of thy
Commandments, and esteem it our meat and drink to do thy will. To this end
assist us (good Lord) by thine holy Spirit, and thereby sanctify unto us thine
holy Ordinances and means of our salvation, that they may be effectual for
the effecting and perfecting of thine own good work of grace and sanctification
in us. Apply unto us powerfully thy Word, which either this day, or any other
time we have heard, that it may inlighten our minds with saving knowledge;
sanctify our hearts and affections, that they may be more and more weaned from
the love of the world and earthly vanities, and fixed upon spiritual and
heavenly things, and may be effectual for the reforming of our lives and
conuersations, and the strengthening of us unto all duties of a godly life;
that so being not only hearers of thy Word, but also doers of it, we may be
assured of eternal blessedness. Let us walk worthy our high and holy
calling, and in all things adorn our Christian profession, that by our holy
and unblameable lives we may gain others to thy Kingdom. Let us exceed all
others as much in spiritual graces, and in bringing forth the fruits of new
obedience, as we are preferred before them, through thy free grace in outward
privileges, and in the gracious means of our salvation; and as thou do
continually sow in our hearts the seed of thy Word, and water it with the dew
of thine holy Spirit, so let us answerably grow in grace from one measure to
another, till we come to a perfect age in Jesus Christ. Do not only pardon
graciously all our wants and weaknesses, which either this day or heretofore we
have showed in the duties of thy worship and service, but enable us for the
time to come to perform them daily with more and more perfection; and grant
that we may so sanctify thy Sabbaths here upon earth, as that we may be
assured that we shall keep an eternal Sabbath with thee in thy glorious
Kingdom. Finally, we beseech thee for thy Christ his sake, to take us this
night and ever into thy gracious protection, and thereby preserve us from all
perils, and from the malice of all our enemies spiritual and temporal. Leave
us not now unto our selves, but still assist us with thy grace and holy Spirit,
that we may perform the duties of thy Sabbaths, which yet remain in some good
and acceptable manner. Season our hearts with those holy instructions and
comforts, which thou have imparted unto us this day past, and make them
faithful treasuries of these precious Jewels. Let our minds, whilst we are
waking, be so wholly taken up with heavenly Meditations, that even our dreams
may savor of them, and in our deepest sleep, let our minds and souls watch
and wait upon thee. Thou have sown good seed in our hearts: O let not the
enemy steal it away, nor whilst we sleep, sow in them the malicious tares of
evil and vain thoughts and imaginations, and so hinder the growth thereof.
Give us quiet and moderate rest, for the better refreshing of our bodies and
minds, that so to morrow we may be enabled to perform such faithful service
unto thee in the general duties of Christianity, and the special duties of
our callings, as may tend to thy glory and the everlasting salvation of our
own souls. And together with us, bless thy whole Church and every member
thereof, etc. And vouchsafe both to them and us, these and all other blessings
which in thy wisdom thou know needful, even for Jesus Christ his sake: to
whom with thee and thy blessed Spirit, we acknowledge to be due, and from our
hearts desire to give all glory and praise, both now and evermore. Amen.

A Prayer before receiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.
O Lord our God, who art infinite in goodness, grace, and mercy; most true in
all thy promises, and most just and powerful in performance; thou have, when
we were strangers and enemies, subject to the curse of the Law, and liable to
thy wrath, by reason of our manifold and grievous sins, and utterly unable to
free our selves out of the state of death and condemnation, given unto us thine
only and dear Son, to work the great work of our Redemption, by his
perfect satisfaction, death, and obedience. By whom, thy Justice being fully
satisfied, and thy wrath appeased, thou have made with us in him thy Covenant
of grace, wherein thou have promised the free pardon of our sins, and the
salvation of our souls, grace in this life, and glory and happiness in the
life to come, upon the alone condition of faith, laying hold upon Christ and
his righteousness, and bringing forth the fruits thereof in hearty repentance
and amendment of life. The which, though it be in it self of most infallible
truth, yet having respect to our weakness, doubting, and infidelity, thou
have been graciously pleased to confirm it unto us, by adding thereunto thy
Seals, the Sacraments. So that nothing has been wanting on thy part, either
for the perfecting the great work of our Redemption, or the effectual
applying of it unto us for our use and benefit. But (O Lord) we humbly
confess, that as we have shamefully broken the Covenant of works, by failing
in the condition of perfect obedience; and have made void thy promises of life
and happiness, by our grievous and innumerable sins, both original and
actual; so also, as much as in us lies, we have deprived our selves of the
benefits which thou offerest unto us in the new Covenant of grace in Jesus
Christ, by our manifold faylings, wants, and imperfections in performing our
promises made unto thee, if thou should look to the perfection of our
graces and outward actions, and not unto the inward truth and sincerity of our
hearts. For we have not thoroughly acquainted our selves with the knowledge of
thy saving truth, concerning this great mystery of our salvation, nor searched
and examined these spiritual Evidences, for the clear understanding of them;
and much less for the bringing of them home to our hearts and consciences,
that in them we might have sound peace and comfort in the assurance of thy love
and our own salvation. Our faith has been exceeding weak in apprehending
and applying Christ and thy gracious promises made in him; and we too too
negligent in using those blessed means which thou have graciously affoorded
us, for the strengthening of it. For we have not only been exceeding
negligent in hearing, reading, and meditating in thy Word, the great Charter of
our peace, which contains in it all our spiritual and heavenly privileges;
but also in making right use of thy Seals, the Sacraments, annexed unto it,
especially this of our Lords Supper, which thou have ordained for the
spiritual food of our souls, to nourish them unto everlasting life. We have
not highly esteemed of this holy banquet, but have often pretended excuses, and
absented our selves, when as thou have graciously invited us unto it. We have
not hungered and thirsted after this heavenly Manna and waters of life; but with
cloyed appetites have carelessly neglected them, when as they have been set
before us. And when we have presented our selves at this holy feast, we have
come to thy Table, after a cold, careless and formal manner, without all due
preparation, and have performed this holy action with profane and unwashed
hands, more for custom then for conscience sake. We have come in much
ignorance of thee and thy truth, thy gracious Covenant, and the Seals annexed
unto it; and that little knowledge we have had, has been more in our heads,
then in our hearts and affections, in idle speculation, then in use and
practice. We have not rightly discerned the body of our Lord, nor put that
difference which we ought, between these elements consecrated to this holy
service, and those which are for common use. We have not duly considered, as
became us, the relation between the signs and the things signified, but have
too much stuck in the outward elements and actions, not looking to the
spiritual graces signified and sealed by them. We have not approved our
selves as worthy ghests, by renewing carefully and conscionably our faith and
repentance, but have presented our selves before thee with much infidelity and
great impenitencie; though, since our last coming to thine holy Table, we have
often renewed our sins; neither have we brought forth such plentiful fruits
of charity toward our brethren for thy sake, as thou requirest, and as it
becomes the true members of Jesus Christ, either by liberal giving unto
those that want, or free forgiving those who have offended us. We have not
showed our Saviors death in this holy action, nor thankefully remembered the
great work of our Redemption, by his precious death and bloodshed. And though
we have professed our selves thy servants by wearing thy livery, yet we have
not endeavored to walk worthy this high calling, by glorifying thee our Lord
and Master. O Lord our God, shame and confusion covers our faces, not only
in the sight and sense of our manifold and grievous sins, both original and
actual, but also of our great imperfections and corruptions, which we show in
the best duties of thy worship and service. We confess, holy Father, that if
thou should enter into judgment with us, and deal with us according to our
deserts, thou might justly make void thy Covenant with us, deprive us of
these means of our salvation, or else make them ineffectual and of no use
unto us whilst we enjoy them. But seeing we are heartily sorry for our
sins, and not only unfeignedly bewail our imperfections, but also desire and
labor after more perfection, promising for the time to come, that we will
more carefully use all good means, whereby we may be enabled to perform all
duties of thy service in a more perfect manner; Good Lord, we most humbly
beseech thee, for Jesus Christ his sake, to pardon graciously all our wants and
weaknesses, to accept, according to thy gracious promises, our will, for the
deed; our poor endeavors, for perfect performance, and to cover all our
imperfections, with Christ's perfect righteousness and obedience, and to wash
away all our corruptions in his most precious Blood. And seeing we do now
again intend to perform the holy duties of thy service, in hearing thy Word,
Prayer, and receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: Good Lord, we
earnestly beseech thee, for thy Sons sake, to assist us so with thy grace and
holy Spirit, as that we may perform these actions of thy service, in some
good and acceptable manner, for the advancement of thy glory, the comfort of
our souls, and the furthering and assuring of our own salvation. More
especially, wee-intreate thee to enable us with thy grace, that we may be
duly prepared, and come as worthy ghests to thy Table. Give us a lively sight
and sense of our sins and imperfections, wants and weaknesses, and let us
hunger and thirst after Christ and his righteousness; and after the spiritual
food of his Body and Blood, for the nourishment of our souls unto eternal
life. Let us not coldly and formally perform this high and holy duty, but
bend all the powers of our souls to the doing of it, in some such manner as
may be acceptable in thy sight. Inlighten our minds more and more with the
saving knowledge of thee and thy truth, and especially of the great work of
our Redemption, and thine infinite love shining in it, of the Covenant of
grace, and Seals annexed unto it; and let not this knowledge reside only in
our understandings, but let it also descend into our hearts, that it may be
profitable for their sanctification. Enable us rightly to discern our Lords
Body, and feelingly to understand the relation between the Signs and the
things signified, applying both unto our selves in their right use. To this end
indue us with a true and lively faith, that we may not only receive the
outward Elements, but also may inwardly feed upon the precious Body and Blood
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that thereby we may be enriched with all
saving graces, strengthened unto all good duties, and nourished unto
everlasting life. Enable us also to bring forth the fruits of this faith in
unfeigned repentance, bewayling our sins past, hating those corruptions which
still hang upon us, and resolving to leave them for the time to come, and to
serve thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives. And as
we have daily renewed our sins, so give us now grace, that we may renew our
faith and repentance, bathing our souls and bodies afresh, even in the
Fountain of Christ's precious Blood, and in the tears of unfeigned sorrow,
mourning with bitter grief, because we have pierced him with our sins, and
caused the Lord of life to be put unto a shameful death. Inflame our hearts
with most fervent love toward thee and our neighbors, yea, even our enemies
for thy sake, and lincke our hearts together in an holy Communion, as it
becomes the true members of Jesus Christ. Let us also approve our love to
be sound and sincere, by the fruits of it, and especially, by forgiving and
forgetting all our wrongs and injuries, as heartily as we desire to be
forgiven of thee, and by performing all works of mercy and Christian charity,
toward all those who need our help; not only by comforting and refreshing
their bodies, but also by performing all Christian duties for the eternal
salvation of their souls. And being thus prepared, let us, when we come to thy
Table, perform that duty of thy service in some good and acceptable manner,
with all reverence, faith and inward feruencie and devotion. Let us with the
outward signs receive the things signified, Jesus Christ and all his benefits;
that being more and more united unto him, we may receive from him the
Spiritual life of Grace, and those holy virtues of his divine nature, that we
may grow up in him unto a perfect man. Let us bring with us the hand and mouth
of faith; and let it be more and more strengthened in the assurance of all thy
gracious promises, by these seals of thy covenant communicated unto us. Make
us partakers of Christ's merits, by imputation of his nature and essence by
conjunction, and of his power and efficacy by thy holy Spirit; and let us show
his death till he come, gratefully remembering this great work of our
Redemption by his blood, that we may be thankful, and praise thee the blessed
Trinity in unity, all the days of our lives. Finally, as we do by these
means profess our selves thy servants in taking upon us thy livery and
cognizance, so give us grace, that we may constantly strive and endeavor to
walk worthy this high calling, and to glorify thee in the duties of holiness
and righteousness, whilst we have any breath or being. Hear us and help
us, O God of our salvation, and answer us graciusly in these our suits and
petitions, for Jesus Christ his sake; to whom with thee and thine holy Spirit,
be rendered of us and thy whole Church, all glory and praise, power and
dominion, both now and evermore. Amen.

A thanksgiving after the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.
O Lord our God, most glorious and most gracious, infinite in bounty and
goodness unto all thy children and servants in Jesus Christ, we do here offer
unto thee the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, and do laud and magnify
thy great and glorious Name, for all thy mercies and favors vouchsafed unto
us; especially because thou have loved us with an everlasting love, yea so
loved us, that thou have, of thy mere grace and free good will, even when we
were strangers and enemies, given unto us thy Best-beloued and only Son, to
work the great work of our Redemption, and by his death and precious
bloodshed to deliver us out of the hands of all our spiritual enemies, and to
free us from everlasting death and condemnation, that we might be heirs
through him of eternal glory and happiness in thy Kingdom. We praise thee
also for the free covenant of grace and salvation which thou have made with us
in him, whereby thou have assured us of the remission of our sins, our
reconciliation with thee, and of endless happiness in the life to come; and
for confirming this covenant unto us, by annexing thereunto the seals thy
Sacraments, that thereby our weak faith might be strengthened and increased,
and we more and more freed from doubting and incredulity. We thank thee (holy
Father) for renewing this thy covenant with us this day, and for confirming our
union with Jesus Christ our head, and one with another, by giving unto us his
precious body and blood, as the Spiritual food of our souls, whereby they are
nourished unto everlasting life. O Lord our God, it is thy great mercy, that
thou nourishest our mortal bodies with food that perishes, but how wonderful
is this thy bounty and goodness, in that thou feedest our souls with this
bread of Life that came down from heaven, and with this food that endures to
life eternal! If thou should permit us but to gather up the crummes that
fall from thy Table, we must needs acknowledge, that it were a favor far
above our deserts; O then how should we admire and magnify thy mercy and
bounty, in vouchsafing such vile and unworthy wretches, this high and holy
privilege, to be feasted at thine own Table, not with ordinary cheer, but
with such spiritual and divine delicacies, even the precious body and blood of
thine only dear Son, whereby he becomes one with us, and we with him,
even as thou, holy Father, and he are one, in that holy and happy union. O
that our narrow hearts were enlarged, that we might in some measure apprehend
this thine infinite and incomprehensible goodness! O that being cold in
themselves, they were warmed and inflamed with the fire and flame of this
divine love; that with the lively sense and feeling of it, we might be moved
to return love for love, and express it by our fervent zeal and endeavor in
all things, to please and glorify thee throughout the whole course of our
lives and conuersations! Which because it is not in our own power, O thou the
rich fountain of all grace and goodness, inspire and inflame our cold and
frozen hearts with the beams of thy love, shed abroad in them by thine holy
Spirit, that we may love thee with unfeigned love, and contemning all things in
comparison of thee, may long and labor after nothing so much, as to enjoy thee
in this life by grace, and the presence of thy blessed Spirit, and by full and
perfect vision and fruition in the life to come. To this end, gracious God,
bless unto us thine holy Ordinances and means of our salvation, and by the
inward assistance of thy good Spirit, make them powerful and effectual to the
attayning of those ends, for which thou have given, and we received them. Let
us find hereby our union with Christ strengthened and confirmed, by feeling
the Spiritual life and sap of grace derived unto us, and increased in us, from
this root of righteousness, not only for our further assurance of our
justification, but also for the perfecting of our sanctification, and the
strengthening of us unto all Christian duties of a godly life. Let us by this
Spiritual food of our souls, find our selves nourished and enriched with all
saving graces, especially let us feel our weak faith confirmed and increased,
that we may, without wavering, be persuaded of all thy gracious promises made
unto us, and effectually apply unto our selves Jesus Christ and all his
benefits, seeing thou have not only offered them in thy Word and covenant of
grace, but also sealed, and thereby fully assured them unto us by thy seals
the Sacraments. Give us grace, that we may approve this faith to be true and
lively, by bringing forth plentiful fruits of it in repentance and newness of
life; bewayling our sins, because they have pierced our Savior; and fearing
to offend thee for the time to come, seeing thine exact Justice would not
suffer them to go unpunished, when thine only and dear Son did bear them
upon his Cross. Let us not by sin, hazard our souls again to death for the
wages of worldly vanities, seeing to redeem us from them, our Savior and
surety paid unto thy Justice the inestimable price of his precious blood; but
being freed from sin, let us become his servants that has redeemed us,
serving him in the duties of holiness and righteousness all the days of our
lives. And as we have professed our selves to be of thy Family, by taking upon
us and wearing thy liuerie, so let us adorn our profession, and glorify thee
our Lord and Master, by having the light of our Christian conversation shining
before all men; in all things behauing our selves as it becomes thy children
and servants. Let us have our Lords death in remembrance, until he come; not
only that it may stir us up to unfeigned thankfulness unto thee, for giving
thy Son, and to him, for giving himself unto us and for us, but also that it
may be as a shield of proof, to arm us against all our spiritual enemies,
thy wrath, the curse of the law, Satan, death, sin and condemnation, that
they may never prevail against us. Let us also, as we have in this holy
communion professed our selves members of the same body, approve our selves to
be indeed so, by performing all duties of love toward one another, both in
releeuing those that want, and forgiving those who have offended us. Finally,
we beseech thee (dear Father) to enable us by thy grace and holy Spirit, that
we may perform our vows and promises which we have made unto thee, especially
in the time of preparation before we came to thy Table; and seeing in the
sense and feeling of our wants and weaknesses in thy Spiritual graces,
required to the worthy receiving of the Sacrament, as knowledge, faith,
repentance and charity, we were displeased with our selves, and promised that
we would endeavor to have them increased and strengthened for the time to come;
good Lord, we beseech thee, give us grace to perform what we have promised,
and to labor carefully and conscionably in the use of all good means, for the
enriching of our souls with these and all other saving graces of thy
sanctifying Spirit, that so also we may bring forth the fruits of them in our
godly and Christian lives, to the glory of thy blessed Name, and the comfort
and salvation of our bodies and souls, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A Prayer for the Sick.
MOst glorious and mighty God, who are righteous in all thy ways, and holy in
all thy works; most just in all thy Judgments, and infinitely gracious, and
merciful toward thy children in Jesus Christ, even in thy chastizements and
Fatherly corrections; who art the Author of health and sickness, and have in
thy hand the issues of life and death. For as much as thou have commanded us to
call upon thee, as at all times, so especially in the time of trouble and
affliction, and have encouraged us hereunto by thy most gracious promise, that
thou will hear and help us, that being delivered, we may glorify thee. We
thy poor humble servants, in obedience unto this thy Commandment, and in
confidence of this thy promise, do here in the Name and mediation of Jesus
Christ, humbly prostrate our selves before thee, acknowledging and bewayling
our manifold and grievous sins. For we were not only conceived and borne in
sin, and thereby so defiled in all the powers and parts of our souls and
bodies, that we have been disabled unto all good duties, and made prone to
all wickedness; but we have also from this bitter root of original
corruption, brought forth continually those cursed fruits of actual
transgressions, by breaking all and every of thy Commandments in thought, word
and deed, from the beginning of our lives, unto this present hour: And that
not only in the days of our ignorance, whilst we continued the vassals of
Satan, and when as sin reigned and ruled in us, and we performed unto it
voluntary and cheerful obedience, as unto our King and Sovereign; but even
since thou have graciously called us out of the kingdom of darkness, and
have wrought in our hearts some desires to serve thee: we have often rebelled
against thee, and for the base hire of worldly trifles, have been allured to
commit many sins, not only through frailty and infirmity, but even against
our knowledge and consciences; contrary to our general vow in Baptism, and
many special promises which we have made unto thee upon sundry occasions. And
although thou have given unto us our Being, and preserved us in it by thy
special and good providence, and have redeemed us by the death of thy dear
Son, out of the hands of all our spiritual enemies, that we might worship
and serve thee, in holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives;
yet, Lord, we humbly confess, that we have been too too forgetful of these
inestimable mercies, neglected the duties of thy service, and spent the
greatest part of our lives in pursuing worldly vanities. These, these (dear
Father) have been for the most part the subject of our thoughts, the object of
our desires, and the chief marks, at which we have aimed in our most earnest
endeavors. And so have we in our understandings minded earthly things, in our
hearts affected them with such longing desires, and with all our strength
pursued them in all our works and actions, as though we had no better hopes,
and had forgotten that we are pilgrims on earth, and Citizens of heaven. As for
the duties of thy service, we have often, through this eager pursuit of worldly
vanities, forgotten and neglected them; and often have performed them with much
coldness and formality, weakness and weariness, dullness and drowzinesse of
heart and spirit, whilst our minds and affections have been distracted and
carried away, and our devotion and zeal cooled and quenched, by our overmuch
minding and loving of earthly things. And though thou have allured us to
perform unto thee more sincere and cheerful service, by promising to give us
the rich wages, and free reward of heavenly happiness; yea for the present
have encouraged us hereunto, by multiplying upon us many temporal blessings;
as health, strength, peace, plenty, food, apparel, and such like: yet we have
abused these benefits, by taking occasion thereby to go on in our sins with
greater security, and have been made by them more negligent in thy service. And
therefore (O Lord) it were just with thee, if thou should deprive us of them
all, turning our strength into weakness, our health into sickness, and all
our peace and comfort into tortures of body, and troubles of mind. But (dear
Father) deal with us, not according to our deserts, but according to thy
wonted mercies in Jesus Christ. And seeing the end of thy chastisements is not
destruction, but salvation; not to punish our sins, for which thy Son has
fully satisfied thy Justice by his all-sufficient sufferings; but to bring us
to repentance: we most humbly beseech thee, to give unto us a true sight and
sense of them, unfeigned sorrow, and a perfect hatred of them, and a full
resolution to leave and forsake them for the time to come, and to serve thee in
the contrary duties of holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives.
And thus returning unto thee by unfeigned repentance (O Lord) we beseech thee
turn unto us, and be reconciled unto us in Jesus Christ. Forget and forgive
our manifold and grievous sins, whether of omission or commission; of frailty
and infirmity: or those which we have wittingly and willingly fallen into; and
wash them all away in the blood of thy Son, that they may never be imputed unto
us, either in this world, or in the world to come. Seal also our pardon unto
us in our hearts and consciences, by the gracious testimony of thy holy Spirit,
and thereby sanctify us thorow-out in our souls and bodies, that being freed
from the guilt, punishment, and corruption of all our sins, we may be found
unblameable and without spot in the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ. Replenish our
empty souls with all sanctifying and saving graces, and strengthen us unto the
performance of all Christian and holy duties, with all zeal, cheerfulness and
uprightness of heart. More especially, we humbly entreat thee to extend thy
grace and favor unto this thy sick servant, and sanctify this thy fatherly
chastisement unto him, that it may be an effectual means of increasing his
sanctification, and furthering his eternal salvation. And seeing by sickness,
thou put us in mind of our approaching end, and by death, summonest us to
appear before thee in Judgment: O Lord, give him grace, to prepare himself
against the day of death, that he may be ready to render up his accounts, when
thou shall call him to give up his reckoning, and so with joy and cheerfulness
may commend his soul and body unto thee, as into the hands of a faithful
Savior, who wilt crown them both with joy and glory. Let him continually
endeavor to suppress the power of death, and to take away the sting of it, by
mortifying the flesh, and the lusts thereof. Give him grace to renew his
covenant with thee, by renewing the condition of it, which is, embracing thy
promises by a lively faith, and bringing forth the fruits thereof by unfeigned
repentance. Let him confess his sins, bewail and forsake them, resolving to
amend his life, if thou shall prolong his days. Comfort him with the comforts
of thy Spirit, and as his bodily griefs abound, so let thy consolations abound
and exceed them. Give him patience to endure what thou inflictest, and tempt
him not above his power, but either lessen his griefs, or increase his
strength. Moderate and mitigate his bodily pains, with the inward feelings of
thy love, peace of conscience, and joy in the holy Ghost. If it will stand with
thy glory, and his salvation, prolong his days, and restore his health, that
he may yet again praise thee, as for all thy mercies, so especially for his
recovery; and bless unto him all means of physic and diet, which are fit for
this purpose. And being raised from his bed of sickness, give unto him a right
use both of thy fatherly chastisements, and of thy gracious deliverance; that
by the one, he may be moved to fear thee, and to hate sin, having tasted the
bitter fruits of it; and by the other, to love and glorify thee, who have
heard his prayer in the day of his tribulation, and by them both, to serve thee
with greater zeal, and with more earnest endeavor then ever heretofore. Hear
us, dear Father, and answer us graciously in these our suits, even for Jesus
Christ his sake; to whom with thee and the holy Spirit, we acknowledge to be
due, and desire to give all glory, praise and thanksgiving, both now and for
evermore. Amen.

But if the sick party be a child, and so not capable of the outward and
ordinary means of salvation, then pray for him after this manner:
MOre especially, we humbly entreat thee, to extend thy grace and favor unto
this thy sick servant; and seeing thou art not only the God of the faithful,
but also of their seed, and love and tendrest not only the sheep of Christ,
but even the tender lambs; we earnestly beseech thee, make good thy gracious
Covenant with this thy weak and sick servant. And because he is not capable
of outward means, supply graciously the defect of them by thine holy Spirit.
Unite him thereby unto Jesus Christ, that becoming a lively member of his
body, he may be made partaker of his righteousness, death and obedience, for
his justification, and so he may stand righteous in thy sight. Free him from
the guilt and punishment of all his sins, and sanctify him in his soul and
body, that either he may be fit to glorify thee on earth, or to be glorified
by thee in heaven. If it be thy blessed will, restore him to his health and
strength again, that he may live to be a comfort unto his friends, and a
profitable instrument to set forth thy glory in the Church and Commonwealth;
but if thou art purposed to put an end to his days, so fit and prepare him for
thy Kingdom, as that he may live with thee eternally in glory and immortality,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

If the party be irrecouerably sick, or ready to depart out of this world,
then we may, in stead of praying for his restoring to health, make, in his
behalf, these following petitions:
ANd seeing (O Lord) thou have smitten thy sick servant (as we conceive)
irrecouerably, and do now purpose to put an end unto the days of his
pilgrimage; we most humbly beseech thee, to prepare him for thine own
Kingdom. Weane his mind and affections from the world and earthly vanities,
where he is but a stranger, and fix them wholly upon spiritual and heavenly
things, as it becomes a Citizen of thy Kingdom. Let him earnestly desire to
be dissolved and to be with Christ, seeing that is best of all, and let him
long after the vision and fruition of thee, in whose presence is fullness of
joy for evermore. To this end (O Lord) reveal thy self unto him more clearly
then ever heretofore, that seeing thy beauty, goodness and excellency, his
heart may be thoroughly inflamed with thy love. Give him, even whilst he
lives, an entrance into thy Kingdom, not only by the assurance of faith and
hope, but also by letting him have a lively taste of those heavenly joys,
which thou have prepared for him. Moderate his griefs and pains, that they
may not hinder his soul from mounting aloft in divine contemplations; and
secretly whisper unto his heart sweet comforts by thy Spirit, when as he is,
through weakness, insensible of outward consolations. Inflame his heart with
fervent love toward thee and his brethren; yea even his enemies for thy sake,
that he may be assured, that his sins are forgiven of thee; because thou
give him grace to forgive all men. Strengthen him against the tentations of
all his spiritual enemies, and manifest thy power in his weakness, by giving
unto him a full and final victory over them. Frustrate the malice of Satan,
defeat his policies, and confound his power, that he may not prevail against
him in this last conflict. Arm him against the fear of thy wrath and severe
justice, by assuring him that Christ has appeased the one, and satisfied the
other. Comfort him against the fear of death, by persuading him, that Christ's
death has swallowed it in victory, pulled out the sting thereof, and made it
harmless; yea exceeding profitable, as serving now for a passage to glory and
happiness; and by strengthening him, to apply unto himself these
consolations, by a lively faith. Weane his heart from worldly cares, that they
may be no distractions to hinder him in his heavenly journey; and let the
assurance, and taste of immortal joys, take away all lothnesse to leave
earthly comforts. Set a guard of thy blessed Angels about him, and let them
serve as thy Messengers and Ministers, to convey his soul, as soon as it is
separated from his body, into thy Kingdom, that it may be there crowned with
glory and immortality. Finally, we beseech thee, give us all here present, an
holy use of these examples of our mortality, that thereby our hearts being
weaned from the world, we may make it our chief business to prepare our
selves against the day of death and Judgment, that so we may with joy and
comfort appear before thee, when thou shall be pleased to call us to give
unto thee an account of our Stewardship. Hear us, we beseech thee, in these
our suits and supplications, for thy Son, and our Savior, Jesus Christ his
sake; to whom with thee, and thy holy Spirit, be ascribed all glory and praise,
power and dominion, both now and for evermore. Amen.

A Prayer for Children.
O Almighty God, and my most gracious Father in Jesus Christ, I humbly
confess, that I am a most wretched sinner, and altogether unworthy to be in
the Covenant of grace and salvation: For I was not only conceived and borne in
sin and corruption, whereby thy glorious Image was defaced in me; but I have
added thereunto many actual sins, by breaking thy Commandments, in thought,
word and deed; whereby I have deserved thy just anger in this life, and
eternal death in the world to come. But seeing thou have vouchsafed to receive
me into thy Covenant, of thy free mercy, giving me the sign thereof, the
Sacrament of Baptism; and have sent thy Son Jesus Christ to dye for, and by
his death to redeem the young as well as the old; I beseech thee, for his
sake, to pardon all my sins, and to wash them all away in his most precious
blood; to receive me into thy love and favor, and to make me thine own child
by adoption and grace. Give me thine holy Spirit to sanctify, rule and govern
me; that according to my age and small ability, I may labor to serve thee.
Make me daily to increase in grace, as I increase in years; inlighten my mind
with the knowledge of thee, and my Savior Christ and his truth. Sow in me the
seeds of faith, and let it show it self as soon as I am capable thereof, in
repentance and true obedience. Make me loving, dutiful and awful to my
Parents and Governors, and let me learn by obeying them in my tender youth,
to obey thee in my riper age. Give me grace to hearken to their good
admonitions and instructions, and to profit and amend by their reproves and
chastisements. Make me humble, courteous and meek, modest and sober, diligent
to please in all good things, and virtuous in my whole course of life, that so
I may increase in favor with thee and all good men. And as I beg these
benefits at thy hands, so I yield unto thee all humble and hearty thanks and
praise, for all benefits, both spiritual and temporal vouchsafed unto me; and
namely, for that it has pleased thee to give me quiet rest and sleep this
night past, and have safely preserved me from all perils and dangers to which
my frail life is daily subject. Continue (O Lord) thy love and favor toward
me for ever; and especially this day take me into thy fatherly protection;
preserve me from sin and peril, and grant, that being diligent and
industrious in learning such good things as are taught me, I may increase in
knowledge, and profit by instruction, in such virtues and good qualities, as
are fit for me. O Lord, bless and preserve my father and mother, my brethren
and sisters, with all other my kindred and friends, together with thy whole
Church: and grant that we may live in thy favor, dye in thy faith, and after
death inherit the joys of thine everlasting Kingdom, through Jesus Christ our
Lord: to whom with thee and thy holy Spirit, be all honor and glory, both now,
and for evermore.

Amen.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, Sir Henry Mountagu, KNIGHT; Baron of KIMBOLTON,
Viscount MANDEVILLE, Lord President of his MAJESTY'S most Honorable Privy
Counsel; And to the truly Noble and Virtuous Lady, the Lady MARGARET his Wife.
J. D. wishes all temporal happiness, with the confluence of all spiritual
Graces in this life, and eternal blessedness in the life to come.
Right Honorable, and my most honored Lord and Lady,
AS long peace and prosperity, are the common causes of carnal security and
hardness of heart, so these the usual forerunners of fearful punishments,
seeing in this desperate Disease (which we may fitly call, the stone in the
heart) more gentle Medicines will not effect the cure. For when men's hearts are
come to brassy or flinty hardness, nothing will melt them (without some
extraordinary work of the Spirit) but the fiery furnace of Affliction, nothing
will bruise and break them, but the heavy hammer of Gods dreadful judgments.
And this is manifest in the examples of all Ages, which are left unto us in the
Scriptures, to give us warning. As of the old world, Sodom and her bordering
Cities; and of the Israelites, Gods own best beloved people, all which, as
they were lulled asleep in the Cradle of carnal Security, with the pleasing
and bewitching tunes of peace and pleasure; so were they always, when they
least suspected it, surprised upon the sudden in their lethargy of sin,
with some remarkable plagues and punishments. And therefore considering with my
self, that our long peace, plenty and prosperity has infected the most that
live in our land, with deep security and retchlesse carelessness, and caused
them to dream, that this Sunshine will never set: I could not choose but
suspect, and daily expect the near approaching of the other, and that the dark
night of affliction and calamity will ere long surprise us, unless the loud
cries of Gods Ministers do speedily awaken us out of our lethargy, and move
us to meet the Lord and prevent his judgments, by turning unto him in unfeigned
repentance. In which regard, being appointed and called by God to be one of
his (though least worthy) watchmen, whose office requires, that we should not
only our selves keep the spiritual watch, but also, as much as in us lies,
awaken others: I thought it my duty, by giving warning of these approaching
dangers, to rowze up as many as I could out of this sleep, or rather lethargy
of security. And because my voice were far too weak (though I could, as the
Lord requires, lift it up as a Trumpet) to be heard of all the people of this
Land, I have endeavored to convey the sound thereof (as it were) by these paper
Pipes, even unto the most remote places; and to those especially, where the
lively voice of Gods faithful watchmen, is rarely heard; either because the
means of their maintenance by sacrilege and Church-robbery, or symonicall
fraud is taken away; or because dumb, or idle and sleeping watchmen do hold
their places, without any care to perform their duty, as neither keeping the
watch themselves, nor being either able or willing to keep others waking. The
which my labors I have made bold to dedicate unto your Honors: To you, my
Lord, I confess, not without some presumption, as not being hitherto known
unto you, yet herein not inexcusable, in that it proceeds from a desire to
show how much I honor you, for your profession and protection of Gods true and
sincere Religion, in that Honorable place unto which God has called you; your
love to Learning, and fouour toward the Learned. But to you Noble Lady, in
whose notice and undeserved respect, I have been more happy, I have devoted
this poor part and mite of my worthless Works, that living in these Paper
Monuments, as it were, in my longest lasting posterity, I may, even after death
has imposed silence, still testify unto the world mine humble love and
unfeigned thankfulness, for your manifold and great favors vouchsafed unto
me; and how much I honor you for those singular virtues and graces, wherewith
God has enriched you, especially your piety toward him and love of his truth,
much approved, as by many other fruits, so especially by your love to his
Ministers and Ambassadors. The which were ample matter for a larger discourse,
to encourage others of your rank to imitation, did not your modesty and
humility attending and adorning all the rest, admonish me that such praises of
you, unto you, will be thought unnecessary, if not unpleasing and distasteful.
The Lord infinitely rich in all goodness and perfection, more and more
multiply, all Christian Virtues and saving Graces in you both; in the light and
luster whereof you shall be ever more truly honorable in the sight of God and
all those that fear him, then in the highest dignities and noblest
aduancements that the world can yield unto you.

Your Honors most obliged in all Christian duty and humble service, JOHN
DOWNAME.

OF CARNAL SECVRITIE.
THE FIRST BOOK.
CHAP. I.
The Preface. Of Security in general: and more specially of security in the
state of Innocence; and of that which is in us after the Fall.

. 1 That God the supreme goodness turns all, even evil it self into good.
AS it is the nature and property of the supreme Goodness, to make all things
like unto it self, and even out of evil to produce that which is good: so is
it the nature of sin and corruption, so to poison and taint whatsoever it
touches, that though it be of an indifferent nature, yea originally good, it
makes it like it self evil and sinful. Of the former we have God himself,
the best example; who being infinite in wisdom, power and goodness, does not
only effect his good ends by good means and instruments; but is able to bring
light out of darkness, good out of evil, and to make the worst instruments
fit tools for the perfecting and polishing his best works. And thus he
ordinarily uses the evil of punishment, as crosses, calamities and
afflictions of all kinds corporal and spiritual, not only for the just
punishment of the wicked, but for the trial of his own Servants, the purging
and Romans 8. 28.
purifying of them from their corruptions, the exercise, and by exercise 2.
Cor. 4. 17.
the manifesting and increasing of their spiritual graces, and the furthering
and assuring of their salvation. Thus he uses the wicked for the chastizement
of his Children, and the Devil himself and his malicious tentations, for the
strengthening of them in Faith, Love, Patience, and all other saving graces,
after they have had experience of Gods power and goodness, assisting and
giving them victory in these spiritual conflicts. Yea, this chief Goodness
can make even sin it self in others, to serve as a means to execute his
wise and just Counsels, as the malicious practices of Joseph's brethren, the
means of his Genesis 45. 5. 7. 8.
advancement, and their own preservation: the sin of Absolon, Achitophel and
Shemei, for his rod to chastize David, and to humble 2. Sam. 12. 11. and 16.
10. Act. 2. 23. and 3. 28.
him for his grievous falls; the sin of Judas, the Scribes, Pharisees and
Devil himself, to set forward the work of our Redemption by the death of our
Savior. Yea, he can make of sin in the same party, an Antidote against
sin, and, as it were, smother it in its own smoke, and by letting his
Servants slip into lesser sins, he can preserve them from falling, or being
fallen, can pull them out of those which are greater. As when by the prick of
other sins, he lets 2. Cor. 12. 7.
out the wind of pride, which is most hateful unto him, and pernicious unto
our selves; and when by leaving us, he suffers us to slip Matt. 26. 33. 34.
into sin to make us cast away selfe-confidence, that we may more firmly
cleave unto him, who alone is able to support us by a lively Faith.

. 2 That it is the nature of sin and corruption to turn all into evil.
Of the other we have lamentable experience, not only in Satan, but
principally in our own sinful corruptions, which make us apt and ready to
abuse all things unto sin, and out of the best premises to infer the worst
conclusions. And thus our wicked flesh abuses Gods saving attributes unto
sin, as his infinite mercy which should cause us to fear him, to move us
thereby to go on in our wicked courses, more sinning that grace may more
abound. His Patience and long suffering, which should lead us to repentance,
to work in us hardness of heart, and by deferring our repentance to treasure
up wrath against the day of wrath. His Justice and righteous Judgments, which
should above all things make us afraid to displease him, because he is a
consuming fire, and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
living God, the flesh abuses to make men to despair of Ezech. 33. 10, 11 Esa.
22. 12, 13.
all grace or future good, and therefore to lay hold of the present delights of
sin, saying with the Epicures, Let us eat and drink, for to 1. Cor. 15. 32.
morrow we shall die. But especially and most ordinarily our sinful
corruption abuses Gods temporal benefits unto evil, which being originally
good, are unto us in respect of their use of an indifferent nature; good to
those who use them well; and evil unto those that abuse them unto sin. And
of this kind is wordly prosperity, with all earthly benefits which do
accompany it, as health, wealth, peace, plenty, immunitie from dangers, and
such like; the which our sinful flesh abuses, for the robbing of our souls
of all grace, and the replenishing of them with all vice and sin, as
forgetfulness of God, pride, profaneness, neglect of Religion, and contempt
of Gods Ordinances, tyranny, oppression, cruelty, with innumerable others of
this Christian Warfare, 2. Part.
hellish brood, as elsewhere I have more fully showed.

. 3 That fleshly corruption abuses prosperity, to the be getting in us
carnal security. Psalm. 111. 10. Pro. 1. 7.
But especially among and above the rest, does our fleshly corruption abuse
this worldly prosperity, as a means to beget in us carnal security, which
is the Mother and Nurse of all other wickedness; whereby men's hearts being
emptied of all fear of God, which is the head and beginning of true wisdom,
are made capable and fit to receive all manner of wickedness, and to run in a
headlong course into all kinds of horrible and hellish impieties. Of which we
have too lamentable experience in these our days; wherein few make conscience
of any sin, not punishable by humane Laws, which offers unto them either
pleasure or profit; as neglect of Religion, and duties of Gods Service, bitter
Cursing, blasphemous Swearing, profanation of Gods Sabbaths, Cruelty,
Oppression, Briberie, Extorsion, Whoredom, Drunkenness, Fraud, Usury,
deceitful Dealing, and matchless Pride, showed especially in shameless and
monstrous fashions of Apparel, whereby Women are transformed into Men, and Men
into Women. And what is the cause of all these mischiefs, but carnal
security? whereby Men bless themselves in their wicked courses, and put far
from them the Judgments of God and the evil Day, and together with them their
Repentance and amendment of life? And from whence does this security arise and
spring, but from our abundance of Gods temporal Blessings, long Prosperity,
Peace and Plenty, abused by our carnal corruption, which makes Men to forget
God, because they find no need of him; to neglect and contemn his fearful
Judgments, because they have not felt the smart of them; and because they have
long escaped punishment in their evil courses, they continue still securely in
them, promising impunitie unto themselves, upon their former experience, for
the time to come, and also the continuance of all their worldly prosperity,
concluding, that tomorrow will be like this day, and much more abundant, as the
Prophet Esa. 56. 12.
speaks.

. 4 The motive which induced me to the writing of this Treatise.
And therefore seeing this carnal security is a capital sin, and most
odious in Gods sight; and a mother Vice which in her fruitful womb breeds
and nourishes all other kinds of wickedness; and seeing it is the Sin of
the Times and of the Country, which has wholly corrupted and poisoned the
greatest number of our Nation, and somewhat tainted the very best; I thought it
a fit Subject to write upon (For a word spoken in due season how good is it?)
Pro. 15. 23.
and to encounter this mother Sin with the Sword of the Spirit, and to strike
at this Root of all Vice with the Axe of Gods Word; knowing, that if it be
vanquished, all other Vices that depend upon it will easily be put to flight;
if it be mortified and killed, the cursed offspring of this hellish Monster,
will either be obortiues in her dead womb, or die for want of nourishment, if
already they be bred and borne; when as her poisonous breasts can yield unto
them no further food.

. 5 That it is necessary to distinguish security into its several kinds.
But that we may not mistake our Friends for our Enemies, and because they have
some resemblance of the same names and colors, fight against both alike, and
so as much endamage our selves by wounding those that are of our own party,
as get advantage by subduing those that are against us: It shall not be amiss
in the first place to marshall them in their several ranks, and by due
distinctions to separate the one from the other, as Iehu the Priests of the
Lord from 2. King 10.
the Priests of Baal; that so we may with more courage and confidence assault
our Enemies, and afterward comfort and cherish our Friends, which will, if
they be rightly and kindly used, be serviceable unto us, and after victory
add unto our triumph much joy and contentment.

. 6 Of security in the state of Innocence.
Security, generally taken, is (as Aquinas defines it) a perfect
tranquillity and freedom of the mind from fear. In which sense Aquin. 2. 2.
quest. 129. art. 7. in Etymolog.
it is opposed to fear as the privation thereof. And from hence it has it
Etymology and Notation, as Isidore notes; Securus quasi sine cura; a Man is
said to be secure, who is without care or fear. More specially security is
taken either for that which is natural, or that which is supernatural, divine
and holy. Natural security is that which proceeds from natural causes, as
safety from all dangers, and assurance of the constant fruition of all the
good things which we desire. The which is to be considered* as it was
originally in us by creation, in the state of innocence and perfection, or as
it is now in us in the state of corruption after the fall. Security in the
state of innocence, was a perfect tranquillity of the mind without the
encounters of any fears, which was wrought in our first Parents by the Lord
our Creator, and was a fruit of their full assurance of Gods protection and
providence continually watching over them, whereby they were assured of
freedom from all evil, and of the fruition of all good; and of that inward
peace of conscience with God, and that outward peace which they had with all
the visible Creatures, none of which could hurt them, all of which were useful
and serviceable unto them. The which security was lost by the fall of our
first Parents, whereby they became guilty of sin, obnoxious to Gods wrath,
and as out-lawes, cast out from under the privilege and safeguard of his
protection, which was accompanied with horror and fear, proceeding from a
dreadful expectation of deserved punishment. And this fear was continually
increased by the consideration of Gods exact Justice, which will not let sin
escape unpunished, from our enmity with God, appearing in the opposition of
his goodness and purity, against our wickedness and corruption; and that
inward war of the conscience, against our passions and carnal concupiscence,
and that outward war between us and all the Creatures. For no sooner became
we rebels against our Lord and Creator, and broke the peace between us and
him, but they also rebelled against us, and breaking the peace between us,
became our professed Enemies, and ready instruments of executing Gods wrath
against us for our sins.

. 7 Of security in the state of Corruption, and the original of it.
Now because being in this case, we could not do cheerful service, unto
Satan, who when we were cast from under Gods protection had taken us captive
to do his will, but out of fear and discontent were likely to endeavor the
bettering of our estate, and to secke some means to free our selves from this
dreadful misery; therefore this subtle Enemy of our salvation, labored to
make up this breach, whereby we did lie open to all dangers, and in stead of
the firm wall of Gods protection, which like an impregnable Bulwark secured
us from all evil, he built about us a Wall of rubbish and untempered Mortar,
or rather of straw and sear wood, which in stead of preserving us from outward
perils, was ready to betray us to all assaults of Enemies, to be set on fire
with Gods wrath and the wild fire of Hell, the tentations of the Devil, and so
to become, in stead of a Wall of defense, fuel for our execution, and means
of our greater torment. To all which evils we were more desperately exposed,
because by this seeming shelter, and ayerie wall of defense, we were made
wholly negligent, as though there were no evil approaching, nor any Enemy able
to disturb our peace. The which weak Fort and vain Defense, was wholly
framed of Satan's errors and lies, whereby he made us either to apprehend, by
a false conceit things that were not, or to misse-apply unto our selves things
that are, as though they were near and on our side, when as they are far off
from our defense, and rather against, then for us, so long as we are in the
state of impenitencie and unbelief. In the former respect he makes us secure
by telling us of our natural excellencies, our good meanings and intentions,
our justice and love to God and Men, whereby we fulfill the Law, and merit from
God by our good lives his protection and defense; when as there is nothing in
us but ignorance and unbelief, worldliness and profaneness, sin and
corruption, which so defiles even those actions which we think most
glorious, that they are abominable in Gods sight. And also by telling us that
we have peace with God, and are highly in his favor; and peace with all the
Creatures, so as nothing will do us any harm; when as all things in Heaven
and Earth are at enmity with us, and (when God does but give the sign of
battle) will set upon us with all their fury. In the other respect, he
secureth us, by setting before us the infinite mercies of God, inferring
thereupon, that we may safely go on in our sins, because God is so
merciful, that few or none shall be condemned, and that though we defer
our repentance to the last hour, yet even then we shall have pardon, if we
have but leisure to say, Lord have mercy upon me; the all-sufficient merits of
Christ which are a full price of redemption for the whole World; the gracious
and indefinite Promises of the Gospel made unto all Men without exception; the
impunitie of sinners, and namely of themselves, having long continued in their
sinful courses; the prosperity of the wicked who glut themselves with the
pleasures of sin, the afflictions of the faithful who are precise and strict
in all their ways, and diverse other motives, of which we shall speak more
fully hereafter: from all which he concludes, that we may lay aside all
fear, and take liberty to satisfy our carnal lusts, because there is no
danger at all, of either present or future punishment.

And thus in stead of that security, which we had in our creation, and in the
state of innocence, accompanying the assurance of Gods love and protection,
whereby we should have been made more cheerful and courageous in the duties
of Holiness and Righteousness, because we served such a gracious and
powerful Lord, as was both able and willing to protect us from all perils, and
to safeguard us from all enemies; Satan labors to work in us this carnal
security, whereby we are encouraged to perform service unto himself with
all confidence and cheerfulness; persuading us that we are safe from all
danger, though we be daily obnoxious to Gods wrath, liable to his fearful
Judgments, and in the very jaws of Death and Hell. With which security he
brings more to destruction then with all his terrors and fears, whereby he
indeauoureth to plunge men into desperation, yea in truth then with all other
tentations, though never so ugly and terrible in their outward appearance. In
which regard it behooves all Christians as they love their souls, and would
either escape Death and Hell, or attain unto salvation and everlasting
happiness, that they keep a narrow watch over themselves; and that being
wounded by this viperous Serpent with the sting of sin, they do not
thereupon fall into this pleasing slumber, or rather dead sleep of carnal
security, the which brings all, ouer-taken with it, into destruction and
condemnation of Body and Soul.

CHAP. II.
Of carnal security, and what it is.

. 1 Of the general Parts of this Treatise.
TO which purpose let us now speak more specially of it. And for our more
orderly proceeding, I will first show what it is, that so knowing, we may the
better avoid it. Secondly, the causes of it and means, which Satan and our
own corruption use to work it in us. Thirdly, the diverse sorts and kinds of
this Vice. Fourthly, how we may know the one from the other. Fifthly, the signs
whereby we may discern, whether and how far forth we are tainted and
infected with this deadly poison: and lastly, the means whereby we may either
be preserved from falling into it, or recovered, if we be already ouer-taken.

. 2 Carnal security defined.
Concerning the first, we will make it plain, not only by a Definition or
Description, but also by Testimonies and Examples of it recorded in the holy
Scriptures. It may best be defined, if in all things we oppose it to that
Virtue whereof it is the privation, namely, the true fear of God, after this
manner. Carnal security is a Vice or vicious habit, whereby forgetting or
neglecting both the justice and power of God in punishing sin, and also his
infinite Love and Goodness in Christ, his Merits and Judgments, his Promises
and Threatenings, with the manifold benefits which we have received from him, we
do cast off all fear of him, and so quietly and securely go on in sin
without repentance, promising unto our selves immunitie from all punishment,
and not only for the present the constant fruition of our carnal delights,
but also everlasting salvation in the World to come. Unto this description, for
the better clearing of the point in hand; we may add that of Bernards,
describing an hard or secure heart: It is that (says he) which is not rent
with compunction, nor Bernard. de Consid. ad Eugenium lib. 1.
softened with piety, nor moved with prayers, nor yields to threatenings, and
is hardened with stripes. It is ungrateful for benefits, unfaithful for
counsels, fierce in respect of judgments, shameless in regard of things
filthy and dishonest, undaunted in dangers, inhumane in humane actions, rash in
divine, forgetful of things past, neglectfull of things present, improuident
for things to come. It is that which remembers nothing past but injuries,
loses the benefit of all things present, and fore-casteth and provides for
nothing to come but revenge. And that I may in a word comprehend the evils of
this horrible Vice; it is that which neither fears God nor respects Man. So
that if we would have a brief definition of this Security, it is nothing else
but the absence and privation of the fear of God; for as security generally
considered, is the freedom of the mind from all fear; so this special kind
of it carnal security, is that horrible Vice which emptieth the heart wholly
of the true fear of God. And thus the wise Man opposes them the one against
the other. Happy is the man (says he) that fears always, but he that
hardneth Pro. 28. 14.
his heart shall fall into mischief.

. 3 Testimonies of Scripture, showing what it is.
And this is that security of which David speaks: The transgression of the
wicked says within my heart, that there is no fear of Psalm. 36. 1, 2.
God before his eyes: For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his
iniquity be found out to be hateful. And describing the prosperous estate of
the wicked, he says, That continuing in their corruption, and being covered
with violence, as with a garment; They speak loftily, Psalm. 73. 8, 9, 11.
and set their mouths against the Heavens; saying, How does God know? and is
there knowledge in the most High? And Job discoursing of the same subject,
namely, wicked men flourishing in worldly prosperity, says, that their houses
are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon Job 21. 9.
them. They take the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoice in the sound of the Organs;
they spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
Therefore they say unto God, depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of
thy ways. What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit
should we have if we pray unto him?

. 4 Examples of carnal security.
The examples of this Vice, recorded in the holy Scriptures, are very many. It
was one of the first sins which tainted our first Parents; who upon the
Devils word promised unto themselves, in the transgression of Gods
Commandment, not only impunitie for their sin, but also a great addition to
their present happiness. The old World was drowned in deep security, before
it was drowned with the general Deluge. For though Noah, the Preacher of
Righteousness, denounced Gods Judgments, that he might bring them to
repentance, yet they securely went on in their sins without fear of danger,
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until Luk 17. 27, 28.
the day that Noah entering into the Arc, the Flood came and took them all
away. It was a chief sin of Sodom and Gomorrah, accompanying their Ease and
Plenty, Peace and Prosperity, which made them to bless themselves in all
their abominable wickedness, to stop their ears to righteous Lot,
foretelling their imminent plagues; and to run on in their sinful courses, as
though they were obnoxious to no danger. For as our Savior notes, They did
eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded, until
the day that Lot departing out of Sodom, it rayned Fire and Brimstone from
Heaven and destroyed them all. Thus David complayneth of the great Ones of his
time, who grievously oppressed the Poor, presuming of Gods conniuency and
their own impunitie: He has said in his heart, God has Psalm. 10. 11.
forgotten, he hides his Face, he will never see it. This was the sin of
old Babylon, who having lifted up her self by blood and cruelty above all
other Nations, never laid her sins to heart, but dwelled carelessly Esa. 47.
7, 8.
and gave her self to pleasure, and concluded, That she should be a Lady for
ever, and never sit as a Widow, nor know the loss of Children. And such is
the carnal security, of the new Babylon and the Roman Antichrist, as the
Apostle John describes it, who having multiplied her Idolatries, and made the
Kings and Nations of the Earth drunk with the golden cup of her Fornications,
and her self with the blood of the holy Martyrs, securely goes on in her
sins without repentance, Apoc. 18. 7.
and presumes notwithstanding of impunitie, and the long continuance of her
worldly prosperity. Such was the security of those desperate sinners, of whom
the Prophet Esaias speaks, who made a covenant with Death, and were at an
agreement with Hell, and so securely went on in their sin, promising unto
themselves, that when the ouer-flowing scourge should pass through, it should
not come unto them; because they had made lies their refuge, and were hid under
falsehood. Esa. 28. 15.
For this the Ancients of the House of Israel are condemned, who having
committed many and great abominations in the dark, were out of all fear of
punishment, saying. The Lord sees us not, the Lord has forsaken the Earth.
And finally, this was the security of the Ezech. 8. 12. and 9. 9.
people of the Jews, who were settled on their lees, and resolved to go on in
their wicked courses, saying in their hearts, The Lord will not do Zeph. 1. 12.
good, nor will he do evil.

CHAP. III.
Of the manifold causes of carnal security.

. 1 The first cause of Security, ignorance of God, and his saving attributes.
WE have seen what this carnal Security is; and now in the next place we
are to consider of the causes and means, whereby it is wrought in us. The
first whereof is ignorance either natural or affected, which like a thick
cloud or foggie mist, does hide from the eyes of our minds all the motions of
Gods fear, and makes us secure in the midst of dangers, because we do not
see the evils that encompasse us round about. Like unto silly Birds which sit
singing on the boughs, when the unseen Archer has his Bolt upon the string,
ready to shoot and smite them off; or which feed securely on the Bait, within
the compass of the Net, because it lies hidden from their sight. For we are
beset on all sides with innumerable dangers, but yet remain secure, even when
they are ready to seize upon us, because we see only the baits that delight
us, but do not behold, by reason of our ignorance, the Nets and Snares which
are ready to catch us. We see and taste the pleasures of sin, and the
bewitching allurements of worldly riches and preferments; but because we
neither know nor acknowledge the justice of God in punishing sin, his hatred
of it, and inflamed wrath against it, which nothing could quench, but the
streams of Christ's precious Blood, his all-seeing Eye, which takes notice of
all sins though never so secretly committed, and omnipotent Power in
punishing them; nor the malice of the Devil in tempting us unto sin, nor the
manifold miseries into which we plunge our selves, when we yield to his
tentations; therefore we bless our selves in this cursed estate, and securely
go on in sin without repentance.

. 2 The second cause, want of consideration of that we know.
The second cause of security is, when as knowing these things, for want of
consideration we cast them negligently behind our backs, and make no use of
that we know. For therefore do men securely go on in their sin and fear no
danger; because they do not meditate and consider, that the eye of their Judge
is always upon them, who will execute righteous Judgment without respect of
persons; of the day of Judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be
disclosed, and all hidden things brought to light. Of that strict account,
which is then to be given, and the eternal miseries and hellish tormentg into
which they shall be irrecouerably plunged, who come short in their reckonings,
and are not able to pay their debts. Because they do not consider that the
pleasures of sin, which they presently enjoy, are short and momentanie, and
may every day be taken from us or we from them; but the punishments of them
great and endless, even the final loss of eternal happiness; and the
intolerable torments of hellish condemnation.

. 3 The third cause, self confidence.
The third cause of carnal Security, is self Confidence, arising from an
erroneous opinion of our own power and sufficiency, for the fruition of our
desires, and freedom from all dangers. For therefore are men secure, because
they think themselves so wise, that they can with their policy either prevent
all dangers, or quit themselves out of them, if they be fallen into them.
Because they have an opinion of their own strength, as though thereby they
were able to protect themselves from all evils, to withstand all enemies which
may attempt the disturbing of their peace, and to safe-gard both their own
persons, and all that belong unto them, from all perils; and that by their
own absolute power, or by the aid of their friends, or the situation Ier. 49.
16.
of their Country far remote from Enemies, or environed with the Sea, or the
strength of their Fortifications, which they think Psalm. 20. 7.
impregnable, or their Munition and warlike preparations, wherein they excel
all their neighbor Nations. So also this carnal security arises in many
from confidence in those spiritual privileges, wherein they are preferred
before others, as that they are members of the true Church, and enjoy the Word,
the Sacraments, and the rest of Gods holy Ordinances, as we see in the example
of the Israelites, who went on in their sins with great security, because
they had the Ier. 7. 4.
Temple of the Lord, the Arc and Law of God amongst them. And finally, many
nourish this security in them, out of an opinion of their own worthiness and
merits, and supposing themselves to be much more holy then others, they
imagine that God is bound to them for their well-deseruing, to watch over them
in more especial manner, that no evil may happen unto them.

. 4 The fourth cause, abuse of worldly prosperity.
The fourth cause of carnal Security, is worldly Prosperity, which makes
men believe that it is a sure Friend, and will never leave them, though in
truth it is but a fawning Flatterer, which is as unconstant as the Moon, the
Wind, or April weather. It promises that they shall still drink their
delicious pleasures out of a full Cup, that their Tables shall ouer-flow with
dainties, and their Riches long continue, Psalm. 49.
of which when they have spent their fill, there will be enough to leave unto
their Children. And as it promises unto them the long continuance of all their
worldly good, so also protection from all dangers, causing them to fear no
evil, because they feel none. It blinds also their eyes with folly, and so
puffs up their hearts with pride, that they cannot see their sins, with
those fearful judgments which do attend them, but makes them think their
vices virtues, and their outrageous wickedness, small slips and humane
frailties. It makes them to forget God, and to remove his Judgments far out
of Ezech. 9. 9.
their sight, and to presume that he either sees them not, or if he do, Psalm.
50. 21.
is not displeased with their wicked courses. To this purpose the Psalmist
speaks: The wicked (says he) through pride of his countenance Psalm. 10. 4,
5, 6.
will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts. His ways are
always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight; as for his
enemies, he puffs at them. He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved,
for I shall never be in adversity. Yea, this worldly prosperity makes men to
forget God, not only through infirmity, but also wilfully to banish all
remembrance of him out of their minds. So Job Job 21. 13, 14.
says, that the wicked flourishing in all plenty and prosperity, and
spending their days in wealth and pleasure, do therefore say unto God; Depart
from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy Ways. What is the Almighty,
that we should serve him? and what profit shall we have, if we pray unto him?
or if they come not to this height of impiety, but that they live ciuilly
amongst men, and perform unto God some cold, heartlesse, and formal service;
then their great prosperity makes them think that they are Gods special
Darlings, seeing they have in their hands so many pledges of his love, and that
because for the present they have received so much good from him, there is no
reason why they should fear any evil for the time to come. And thus Babylon
from her present prosperity, securely concludes, that she should be a Lady
for ever, and know neither Widdow-hood nor loss of Esa. 47. 8, 9.
Children. And the rich Fool in the Gospel, securely gave himself Luke 12.
19.
over to ease and pleasure, because he had stored up much goods for many
years. Yea, even David himself was lulled with this prosperity into the
sleep of security. For in his prosperity he said, that he Psalm. 30. 6.
should never be moved. And Job in his prosperity, concluded, That he Job. 29.
18.
should die in his nest, and should multiply his days as the Sand.

And as this security is caused by self Prosperity, so also it is much
nourished and strengthened by the consideration of the flourishing estate of
others, who go on in their sins without repentance. For men are not afraid
to take those wicked courses, which they see to thrive so well with others; and
will feed securely on those pleasing dainties, which cause others to be in such
good liking. They will not be persuaded that sin is so ugly and ill as men
make it, when as the fruits and offspring of it are so much to be desired;
nor that God so much hates it as Preachers bear them in hand, seeing he
bestows upon those that commit and continue in it, so many testimonies of his
love. On the other side, they see small reason, why they should be over strict
in Gods Service, when as they see those who are most forward and diligent in
it, most afflicted in the World, or why they may not take their fill of the
pleasures of sin, when as they see those that most scrupulously shun it,
thrive no better.

. 5 The fifth cause of Security, is customable sinning.
The fifth cause of carnal Security, is customable sinning, not renewing our
repentance, as soon as we are fallen into it, but committing Quid non inuertat
consuetudo? quis non assiduitate duretur? etc. Bern. de consider. ad Eugen.
lib. 1. Job 6. 7.
it again and again, and making it an ordinary practice, and familiar unto
us by common use. What (says one) does not custom invert? what is not hardened
by assiduitie? what is it that gives not way to use? unto how many does use
make that sweet and pleasant, which at first they abhorred as bitter and
distastefull? so as they may say of their sins, as Job of his sorrows; The
things which my soul refused to touch, are become my daily food. For sin
which at first seemed intolerable unto thee, if thou accustom thy self unto
it, in process of time thou will judge it not so heavy; and within a while,
thou will feel it light; and soon after, not feel it at all: or if there be
any sense, it will be not of grief and sorrow, but of pleasure and delight.
And if we still give way unto it, and do not break it off by serious
repentance, it will bring us not only to security and hardness of heart, but
to impudency and desperate boldness, which will not only make us to commit
sin without fear and blushing in the sight of the same, but to defend it as
though it were lawful; yea, to glory in it as if it were commendable; as we
see in the example of Doeg, who not only did abominable wickedness, but also
boasted Psalm. 52. 1.
himself in his mischief, as the Psalmist speaks. For sin as often as it is
committed, leaves a blot and poisonous taint behind it in the heart and
conscience, which if we do not labor to wash away with the precious blood of
Christ, applied afresh unto us by a lively Faith, and by bathing them in the
tears of unfeigned repentance, it will make them ready to receive the
infection of the next tentation, and at last so wholly corrupt and sinful,
that they will be sensible of no wickedness, because it is of the same nature
and temper with them. To which purpose, one says, that these pricks of
tentations, coming Minus autem dolent sed magis inficiunt, quia dum menti
diutius adhaerent; ta^to fiunt minus pauendi quanto magis ass^^e^i Gregor.
Moral. lib. 24. cap. 7.
into common use, are made more large and wide, though not more sharp and
sensible. They grieve less, but infect more; because sticking long unto the
mind, they are by so much the less feared, by how much they are become the
more familiar. For out of many acts of sin, at last, it comes to an habit,
which, as it is long in getting, so it is not easily lost. And whilst it
continues, sin is committed at ease without any reluctation of mind or
checks of conscience, and lived in with great security; these evil habites
producing actions like themselves with as great facility as the eye sees, or
the ear hears. Again, this often sinning grows unto a custom, which
being evil, is the greatest Tyrant, having in it the nature of a Law, which
brings an urgent necessity with it that cannot be resisted: yea, it
becomes a second Nature, and causes men to sin as familiarly and easily;
as the River runs, the stone descends, or the sparks fly upwards. It
hardneth the heart and seareth the conscience, making it like unto the pathway
which is much trampled upon, in which the seed of the Word can take no root,
but as soon as it is cast upon it, the Fowls or Fiends of hell come and take
it away, as our Savior speaks. It makes the heart like unto the hand Matthew.
13.
which by much labor gets such a callum or thick skin upon it, that it is
almost insensible; and the Conscience like unto the Back, which is at first
sensible of the smallest stripe; but with much whipping, becomes so stupid
and benumbed, that the greatest lashes cause little smart.

. 6 The sixth cause of Security, is the present impunitie of sinners.
The sixth cause of this carnal Security, is impunitie of sinners, after much
wickedness committed by them. For although God out of his goodness, patience
and long suffering, differreth the execution of his righteous Judgments, and
after sinners have often deserved Death and condemnation, does give unto them
many Repriualls, that in the mean time they may sue out their Pardon and
escape punishment, by turning unto him by unfeigned repentance; yet the vessels
of wrath ordained to destruction, through the hardness of their hearts which
cannot repent, take occasion upon this Mercy and Patience of God, of living
securely in their wicked courses, and so by multiplying their sins, treasure
up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the
righteous Judgment of God, as the Apostle Romans 2. 4, 5.
speaks. Like herein to desperate Malefactors, who because they have often
escaped, securely go on in their wickedness, as though they were free from
all danger; or rather to such as being apprehended, arraigned and adjudged to
die, are through the favor of the Judge repriued for a while, that they may
use means to procure their pardon. But they, because day of Execution is a
little deferred, conclude with themselves, that all the storm of peril is
ouerblowne, and (with Agag) that the bitterness of death is past, and
therefore spend their whole time in Pleasures and Delights, in Dancing and
Reuelling, Drinking and Whoring; yea, securely return to their former wicked
courses, Stealing and Robbing, Quarrelling and Killing, till the Judge seeing
his Mercy and Patience thus abused, do give out his Warrant for their speedy
Execution. So the wise Man tells us, that because sentence against an evil
work, is not executed speedily, therefore Eccles. 8. 11.
the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. An example
whereof we have in the Israelites, who because God held his Esa. 57. 11.
peace for a long time, therefore they feared him not. Yea, it grew to a wicked
proverb amongst them; that the days were prolonged, and every vision failed,
that is, because the Judgments of God, threatened by the Prophets, were
deferred, therefore their prophesies were worthy Ezecb. 12. 22.
no credit, as being never likely to be fulfilled. So Scoffers of these latter
times, securely walk after their own lusts, and say, Where is the 2. Pet. 3.
3, 4.
promise of Christ's coming to judgment? seeing since the Fathers fell
asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation,
as the Apostle Peter has forewarned us. And what is the cause of all this,
but the abuse of Gods patience and long-suffering, and a false and blasphemous
conceit of his Nature and Actions arising from it. For when he delayeth to
inflict his Judgments upon the wicked for their sins; they conclude, that
there is no God, or no Providence, that he sits in Heaven, and either sees
not, or regards not what is done on Earth; yea, that he is like them,
allowing and approving of their wicked courses, as the Psalmist speaks; Psalm.
50. 21.
and therefore they may securely proceed in their sins without fear or
danger.

. 7 The seventh cause, presumption on Gods mercy.
The seventh cause of carnal security, is presumption on Gods mercy, whereby
men conceive, that though they live as they list, and daily provoke his wrath
against them, by wilful sins committed against knowledge and conscience, yet
he is so pitiful and tender in compassion, that he will not at all, or but
very slightly punish them for their wickedness, or though they do make them
liable to his displeasure by their sins, yet they may continue in them for a
time, and not deprive themselves of the pleasure and profit of them, seeing
whenever they repent, they shall have pardon, and be received to Grace and
Mercy. The which they may do time enough hereafter, when God begins to
execute judgment; which if he defer to do until the hour of their death,
even then it will be time enough to repent, seeing he offers his Grace to
all whatsoever, at all times whenever, that forsake their sins and call
upon him for mercy and forgiveness. And thus do wicked men make an Idol of a
mercy, in God falsely fancied, unto themselves, whilst they sever it from his
Justice, which will not let the sins of such presumptuous wretches go
unpunished; and from his Truth which has denounced fearful Judgments
against them, who securely abuse his patience and long suffering, which should
lead them to repentance, and make them sorry and ashamed, that they should
offend so gracious and merciful a God, as an encouragement to hearten them on
in their course of wickedness, and to make them contemn his Judgments and
Threatenings.

. 8 The eight cause, the neglect or contempt of the means of grace and
salvation.
The eighth cause, is the neglect or contempt of the means of spiritual grace
and eternal salvation, as of hearing the Word, the use of the Sacraments,
Meditation, Prayer, holy Conferences, and such like. For as these are the
means of working our hearts to the true fear of God, repentance and
spiritual watchfulness; so the neglect of them causes carnal security,
hardness of heart, and boldness in sinning. And as all other Vices get head
and strength, by forsaking the use of the means, whereby the contrary Virtues
are wrought, because they are the privation of them, and therefore the remouall
of the one from that subject, which is capable of them, is the placing of the
other, as we see Light succeed Darkness; and Darkness, Light; Rest Labor,
and Labor Rest: so is it in these, the putting away of the fear of God, by
neglecting the means whereby it is bred and nourished in us, is the cause of
entertayning carnal security. And so likewise, as all other Vices, being
admitted, do mutually strengthen one another, that they may keep firmer and
surer possession against the Virtues which they oppose; so is it between
these, for the more we neglect the Word, Sacraments, and the rest, the more
secure we shall be in all sinful courses; and the more strong we grow in
carnal security, the more negligent we wax in those holy Exercises. And
therefore the Prophet joins them together, as mutual causes of one another:
They stopped their ears that they should not hear, and made Zach. 7. 11, 12.
their hearts as an Adamant stone.

. 9 The ninth cause, hearing the Word without Faith.
The ninth cause, is the hearing of the Word without Faith, giving no credit
either to the threatenings of the Law or promises of the Gospel. Heb. 4. 2.
For as the Word is unprofitable, if it be not mixed with Faith in those that
hear it, as the Apostle speaks: so it becomes in this respect, by
accident, through our corruption, dangerous and hurtful. Either it is the
savor of life unto life, or the savor of death unto death. 2. Cor. 2. 16.
Either it weakneth and kills Vice, or gives more strength and vigor to it;
either it softneth our hearts like Wax, or hardneth them like Clay; either it
works them to Gods fear, when we believe his Promises and Threatenings, or
makes them more carnally secure when we give no credit to them. For the Word
of God proceeding out of his mouth, shall not return unto him void, but shall
accomplish that which pleases him, and prosper in the thing whereto he sends
it, Esai. 55. 11.
as the Prophet speaks. And as often as we hear it, either it sets us
forward in the right way that leads to salvation, or through our corruption
and unbelief, it makes us to go faster and more securely in the ways of
death and destruction. It will make our hearts melt like the heart of good
Josiah, or to become more hard like the heart of Pharaoh; and we shall receive
Gods Ambassadors with fear and trembling, as the Corinthians did Titus; or
with proud neglect, and 2. Cor. 7. 15.
scornful censures; fore-stalling prejudice, and resolved obstinacy, as the
Athenians did the Apostle Paul. So the Lord speaks of some, Act. 17. 18, 32.
who should take occasion upon hearing the curses of the Law, to bless Deuteronomy.
29. 20.
themselves in their hearts, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the
imagination of my heart to add drunkenness to thirst. And the Prophet from
the Lord, says of the people of the Jews, that whilst they heard and
understood not, and seeing perceived not, their hearts were made Esa. 6. 9.
more fat, their ears heavy, and their eyes more blind; which is not caused
by any natural property of the Word, but by accident through man's corruption
that does abuse it, and so makes that a curse which was ordained for a
blessing. Like the weak and tender eye, that is made more blind by the bright
beams of the Sun, which cause stronger sights to see and discern the
better; or the weak ear, which is made more deaf by too much hearing of loud
sounds; or the sick stomach, which becomes more sick by receiving wholesome
nourishment, whereby one strong and healthy would be confirmed in health, and
by well digesting of it, minister vigor and strength to the whole body.

. 10 The tenth cause, the not applying the Word preached.
The tenth cause, is the not applying of the Word preached or read unto our
selves, for our own use and benefit, but putting it off to others as though it
concerned them and not us, especially admonitions and reprehensions for sin,
and the threatenings of Gods Judgments against those that continue in them
without repentance. For so are men blinded with pride and self love, that they
can see no faults in themselves, or if they do, yet they seem so small and
venial, that they are scarce worth the reproving; and so defective are they in
charity toward their Neighbors, that they can easily spy the least Motes in
their eyes, and make of every Moll-hill a huge Mountain. And this makes them
to shift all rebukes for sin, and denunciations of punishment from themselves
unto others, to whom they think they more fitly belong, and so bless
themselves and securely live in sin, as though they were free from all
danger. Yea, though they be never so faulty in those Vices that are reproved,
yet if in truth they can find out any that in the judgment of the World, do
go beyond them in those kinds; then can they hear them sharply rebuked
without any sting of conscience, or sense of the smart of their own sins,
yea, with much pleasure and delight. And thus have I often heard, after some
powerful Sermon against covetousness, a greedy Muck-worme, nothing moved for
his own avarice, because he has been able to pick out of a whole City or
Country some one, supposed to be more wretched then himself, unto whom he
has applied all that was spoken. And so when pride has been rebuked, or
profaneness, or worldliness, or any other sin; I have noted, that those who
have highly offended in these kinds, in the judgment of all others, have like
innocents securely blessed themselves, applying nothing spoken to their own
use, because they could point at others that have exceeded them in faultiness.
As if the Cutpurse should think himself safe and secure from danger of Law;
because there are other greater Thieves, that break Houses and rob by the high
Way; or the common Whore-master, should think himself in no danger of Gods or
Man's Laws, because there are others that live in Incest and filthy Sodomie; or
the Manslayer, should flatter himself with a secure hope of escaping at the
day of Assize, because there are some in the Iayle that have committed
parricide.

. 11 The eleventh cause is the misse-applying of the promises of the Gospel.
The eleventh cause of carnal Security, is the misse-applying of the promises
of the Gospel unto those, who have no part or interest in them. For when as
there is no promise so general and indefinite, which is not limited and
restrained to the condition of the Covenant of Grace, Faith in Christ bringing
forth the fruits of unfeigned repentance; yet wicked men resolving to go on in
the course of sin, no sooner hear the Promises of Gods mercy, the pardon of
their sins, and eternal life and salvation, for the righteousness and
obedience of Jesus Christ, which have always the former condition expressed or
understood, but presently with great confidence, or rather presumption, they
lay hold of the Promises, but have no care at all of performing the Condition.
Thus when the Lord says: As truly as I live I will not the death of a sinner,
that they make use of for the Ezech. 33. 41.
nourishing of their carnal security, never regarding what follows; but
that he repent and live. So when Christ says, that he came not to Matthew. 9. 13.
call the Righteous, but Sinners; with that they comfort themselves in their
sinful courses, but observe not to what he calls them, namely, to
repentance, before they can have any part with him in glory. And when they
hear the Apostles speech; that God will have all men to be 1. Tim. 2. 4.
saved, they make a bolster of it whereon they sleep securely in their sins;
but leave out the following condition, which would help to keep them waking,
namely, that he will have all, whom he would have saved, come first to the
saving knowledge of his Truth, which is 1. Ioh. 2, 3, 4.
never severed from the fruits of obedience. And thus these Spiders out of the
fragrant flowers of Gods promises, suck most deadly poison; and make no other
use of the sweet tunes of the Gospel, but to bring and continue them in the
deep sleep of carnal security; the which serve unto the faithful as
effectual means and motives to make them leave their sins, and turn unto
the Lord by unfeigned repentance.

. 12 The last cause, is a flattering Ministry.
The last cause of this carnal security, is a soothing and flattering
ministry, and when those who are sent as Gods Ambassadors, to denounce his
Judgments against impenitent sinners, either for fear or favor, for hope of
gain or avoiding of displeasure, do their message unfaithfully, proclayming
peace to them, against whom God has denounced war, and applying unto them
the gracious promises of the Gospel, to whom nothing belongs, but the
terrible threatenings of the Law. Of such Prophets the Lord often complayneth.
They say still (says he) unto them that despise me; The Lord has said, Ier.
23. 17.
ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one, that walks after the
imagination of his own heart; No evil shall come upon you. And again, They
have healed the hurt of the Daughter of my People slightly, Ier. 6. 14.
saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace. Of such the Prophet Ezechiel
speaks thus from the Lord. They have seduced my people, Ezech. 13. 10.
saying, Peace, and there was no peace; and one built up a Wall, and lo,
others dawbed it with untempered mortar. If the pride of great Ones will
display it self in its colors, and in wearing garments of strange and even
unnatural fashions, they encourage them in it, because these things being of
an indifferent nature, are left to their free choice, and there is no
difference to be made between Yellow and Blew, French and English. Yea (if
they will so have it) whether being Men or Women, they disguise themselves in
the habit of the contrary Sex. If being their Benefactors, they live upon
usury, that they may be more bountiful toward them in their mind, and more
able in their purse; they soothe them in this sin, by telling them that
whatsoever is spoken of it in the Scriptures, to show how heinous it is in Gods
sight, is to be understood only of biting usury, and of that which is exacted
of those who are miserably poor. If they have a mind to enrich themselves with
bribes, they secure them in their course as being a matter full of equity,
that those who do good unto others, should again receive from them answerable
gratuities. If Naboths Vineyard so please them, that by right or wrong they
will wring him out of it; they hold them excused, if they desire it on a price;
and if oppression and blood follow upon his denial, not they, but poor
Naboth, is to be blamed, who would be so wilful and churlish, as to deny men
of their greatness and worth, a thing so convenient and necessary for them.
And thus do they, as the Prophet speaks, put cushions under Ezech. 13. 18,
19.
their elbowes, that they may sin at their ease, and pollute Gods Name among
the People for handfulls of Barley and pieces of Bread, to slay the souls that
should not dye, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by lying
unto them who will give them the hearing. Yea, with this false and flattering
Doctrine, many join their wicked example, bearing them company, who are under
their charge, in all their sinful courses, yea, rather as Captains and
Precedents, they go before them and lead them the way. The which when it
happens (O would it did not happen too often) it gives double strength to men's
carnal security; there being few that fear to follow their Guides, or to go
as far as they in the fruition of their sinful pleasures or profits, who are
by their Calling and Profession bound to restrain themselves and others from
all that is evil and sinful. But contrariwise, tread securely in those
Paths, which they see their Teachers tread before them, supposing that if
there were any great danger in walking these wicked ways, they who far
exceed them in learning and knowledge, would not with the hazard of their own
souls so ordinarily travail in them.

CHAP. IIII.
Of the diverse kinds of carnal Security.

. 1 Of natural security, which is in all men.
Having spoken of the causes of carnal Security, it now follows that we
show the kinds thereof. And first it may be distinguished by the diverse
degrees of it. In which respect carnal security is either natural, or
affected and voluntary. Natural, is that which every one brings into the
World with him, and is a fruit or branch of original corruption, and one kind
of hardness of heart, whereby forgetting Gods Power and Providence, his
Justice and hatred of Sin, and not observing his fearful Judgments executed
upon the wicked, nor his Mercies extended toward those that serve him, men's
hearts are emptied of the true fear of God, and so without check and remorse
of conscience, or grief of heart, quietly and securely go on in their sinful
courses to their eternal destruction. And this is naturally bred and borne in
all men alike without exception, although nourished and increased diversely by
those causes of security before spoken of, according to that predominancy
which they severally have, in one more then in another. And continues and
wholly possesses all the powers and faculties of Heart and Mind, as it were a
spiritual Lethargy, till the Lord awakneth them out of it; as he does even
the wicked sometimes, by the thundering threatenings of the Law and sense of his
heavy Judgments for their sins, striking horror and despair into their
minds, hearts and consciences, whereby it comes to pass, that they who
slept securely and never awaked, can now take no rest at all. And the godly
always whom he first rowseth out of this dead sleep, partly by Legal
comminations, and partly by some sharp Afflictions, so as like the Iaylor
suddenly awakned, they cry out to Gods Ministers; Men and Brethren, what shall
we do that we may be saved? and Act. 16.
afterward by the preaching of the Gospel, whereby the true fear of God is
wrought in them, which makes them to watch over their ways that they may not,
being overcome by tentations, do any thing displeasing in the sight of God.
So that even naturally, this veil of security is spread over the eyes of all
men, whereby they see not, or seeing (like men asleep with their eyes open)
consider and regard not, the all-seeing Eye of God looking upon them, yea, even
into all the secret corners of their hearts and reins, the Justice and Power
of God, whereby he is ready and able to punish sin, nor his Love, Mercy, and
Goodness, toward all those that seek and serve him, until by the preaching
of the Word, and inward operation of the Spirit, applying unto them the virtue
of Christ's death, this veil is rent in sunder, whereby they come to a sight of
Gods saving attributes; which work in us a reverent and filial fear of him,
which is always accompanied with a holy care and watchfulness over our
selves, that we do not any thing displeasing in his sight.

. 2 Of carnal security which is affected and voluntary.
The carnal security which is affected and voluntary, is when as men
purposely use all means to harden their hearts against Gods fear, and to stop
their ears, that they may not hear any thing which may awaken them of their
pleasing sleep of sin, that so they may without any disturbance commit all
manner of wickedness with delight and greediness, whereby they much
strengthen and increase their natural security, until by custom it
becomes habitual. They add Art to Nature, and thinking that they cannot
sleep soundly enough, and without fear of disturbance in their natural
slumber of security, they stupifie their senses (as it were with opium) till
they are brought into an unrecoverable Lethargy and sleep of death. They do
not only draw over their already hard hearts and seared consciences, a callum
or thick skin, which will not be pierced with the prick of a pin, but (as one
says) even a treble plated armor, Triplex circa praecordia ferrum.
which is high proof against the Sword of Gods Spirit, the Word of God; yea,
even the Musket shot of his Judgments and Punishments. They do not only
quench all good motions of Gods Spirit restrayning them from sin, but quite
put out those small sparks of the light of Nature, which remain in them. They
do not alone stop the voice and cry of their consciences, with the louder
clamor of their tumultuous lusts and passions; but put to silence all that
would admonish them of their wicked courses, with their impudency in sinning.
They harden their foreheads against all reproves, and fly in their faces who
reprehend their wickedness. They shut their Esa. 6. 9. Zach. 7. 11, 12.
eyes that they may not see Gods Judgments, and stop their ears that they may
not hear of them, either as they are threatened in the ministry of the Word,
or inflicted on impenitent sinners like unto themselves; yea, they stupifie
their senses, that they have no feeling of them, but can outface their own
punishments, and even laugh, when they are lashed with Gods whip. And though
all these outward Sconces were batterd and beaten down, so as sin dare no
longer abide in the countenance, Words and external Actions, yet they have an
inward Fort, unto which, being impregnable, it may safely retire, even an heart
of Rocky and Adamant hardness, whereas it may sleep in great security, there
being no engine or shot which will batter this Hold.

. 3 Of carnal security which is in the unregenerate.
Secondly, this carnal security is to be distinguished according to the
diverse subjects in which it is. For it is to be considered, as it is in the
unregenerate before conversion, who are wholly ignorant and forgetful of God,
destitute of Faith and the fear of God, or as it does remain in the
faithful, after they are in part regenerate and truly converted. In the
unregenerate it continues in it full strength, wholly possessing and
corrupting the mind and heart, and depriving them utterly of Gods fear, of the
sight and sense of their sins, and of the Judgments and Punishments due unto
them, either threatened and imminent, or else already inflicted and imposed. In
these it reigns and rules without resistance as a King and Sovereign, unto
whom they yield peaceable and quiet obedience, keeping all in peace without any
fear or disturbance, and as Satan's Viceroy subiecteth all the powers of the
Mind and Soul unto his rule and government, so as quietly and without fear
they do his will, according to the saying of our Savior; When a strong Man
armed keeps his house, all that he possesses is in peace. Or if the
conscience being awakned and affrighted Luke 11. 21.
with the threatenings of the Law and apprehension of Gods Judgment, does check
their lusts and passions, and disturb this quiet peace; Carnal security soon
pacifieth these tumults, by stopping the voice of the Conscience, and casting
it into a deep sleep, whilst it causes it to be lulled in the lap of
carnal pleasure, and sings unto it the sweet and bewitching tunes of worldly
delights, with the dittie of earthly profits and preferments. In which they
continue, till they come to sleep that last sleep of death, and are summoned
to appear before Gods Judgment Seat, to give an account of all their former
courses; unless in the mean time the Lord hastening his Judgment, does
strike the conscience with such horrors and fear, and so vexes and tormenteth
it with the guilt of sin, and apprehension of his wrath, that security is
not able, by all the former means, to bring or keep it asleep, or to stop
and quiet the loud cries thereof. In which case it is forced to give place, and
to yield over the Regencie of such tormented wretches to his adversary and
opposite hellish desperation, which is like unto it in nothing but this, in
that it is alike faithful servant to their great Governor Satan, holding men
firmly, though after a rougher manner, as his Vassalls and Slaves to do his
will, till having finished their work, they receive the wages of Hell
torments, and endless destruction.

. 4 Of that carnal security which remains in the regenerate; and how it
grows upon them.
The carnal security of the faithful, is those relics that remain of
natural security, in the part unregenerate, and one especial fruit of Gal.
5. 17.
the Flesh, which is but in part mortified by the Spirit. For our regeneration
and sanctification being imperfect in this life, the Christian Man is partly
Flesh and partly Spirit, both which are accompanied with their several fruits,
as the Apostle shows, the which continually fight and lust one against the
other; and sometime the Flesh and its Corruption, sometime the Spirit and its
saving Graces, preuayleth and gives the adverse part the foil; as elsewhere I
have more fully In the fourth part of the Christian warfare.
showed. Thus the part unregenerate retayneth and nourishes carnal security,
forgetfulness of God and his all-seeing Wisdom, his omnipotent Power, and
severe Justice in punishing sin, his Mercy and Goodness toward those that
fear and serve him, and thereby becomes careless and secure, and goes on
in sin without repentance. And contrariwise, the part regenerate, remembering
these holy Attributes, still retayneth and cherishes the true fear of God,
and thereby is made careful and watchful to please him in all things, and
consequently to avoid sin as the greatest evil, or having been overtaken
with it through frailty and infirmity, not to continue in it, but to arise
again out of it by unfeigned repentance. And these continually make war one
against the other, and sometime the fear of God prevails and brings
security in subjection, and then the Christian makes conscience of all sin,
and with all care and watchfulness auoydeth all tentations, causes and
occasions, that might allure or draw him unto wickedness; then he daily
renueth his repentance, and labors diligently in the use of all good means,
whereby he may make 2. Pet. 1. 10. Phil. 2. 12. 1. Cor. 10. 12.
his calling and election sure, and as the Apostle speaks, works out his
salvation with fear and trembling, and by his own and others falls, is made
more careful to look unto his standing. Sometimes security gets the upper
hand, and gives Gods fear the foil, so that in respect of sense and feeling
it grows cold and languishing, and very faintly and remisly exercises it
self in its actions and operations. And then the Christian presuming on his
own present strength, and of his former progress in the ways of godliness,
begins to stand at a stay, supposing that he is now rich enough in
spiritual grace, and therefore may leave gathering, and spend upon the stock,
that he is out of all danger of declyning and going back, and that God will
keep him safe in his greatest negligence, and howsoever he carries himself,
make good unto him his gracious promises of life and salvation. And then
forgetting Gods Justice and Judgments, and his Mercy and Goodness toward
him, he begins securely to glut himself with worldly pleasures, and to
pursue earthly profits and preferments; he grows timorous to be seen in any
course of Godliness, which may cross him in their fruition, and willing to
strain his conscience, in using all means whereby he may obtain and securely
enjoy them. Then he sticks not to quench the good motions of Gods Spirit,
inciting him to return to his former holy courses, and restrayning him from
sin whereby he grieueth this holy Ghest, and were he not most gracious,
without respect of desert, would soon make him weary of his lodging. Then he
begins to neglect the exercises of mortification, which tend to the subduing
of the Flesh, and his former care in often renewing his Covenant with God, by
renewing the condition thereof, Faith and Repentance. Then he grows careless
and negligent in the means of Grace and Salvation, as hearing the Word,
receiving the Sacrament, Prayer, communion with the Faithful, and holy
Conferences, whereby they are mutual helps to stir up Gods graces in one
another; not caring much whether he use them or no, and therefore taking slight
occasions as lawful and sufficient excuses of their neglect; or when he does
perform these duties, it is after a cold and formal manner, dully and
drowsily, negligently and wearily, without any taste or spiritual feeling of
joy and comfort in the use of them. And in a word, is little or nothing
affected either with Gods Promises or Threatenings, either with his Mercies or
with his Judgments, either with love and delight, in that which is good, or
with hatred and dislike of that which is evil; and therefore securely lies
snorting in his sins, as though there were no fear of danger, and takes no
care to better his present estate, by rising out of them, by unfeigned
repentance.

. 5 Of insensible and sensible security in the faithful.
And this is that carnal security which is incident to Gods dearest Children;
the which nevertheless may be distinguished, in respect of the diverse degrees
of it; for either it is insensible and not perceived, or else sensible and
discerned. The former, like a deep sleep, does stupifie for the time of the
continuance of it, all their senses, and abuses their mind and imaginations
with deceiving dreams and false apprehensions, whereby they conceive that they
are in good estate, highly in Gods favor, and free from all danger, and
therefore securely go on in their sinful courses without repentance, and
neglect the means whereby the fear of God might be renewed and repaired in
them, or else use them after a cold and formal manner. And this was the case
of holy David himself, after his fearful fall into those grievous sins of
Adultery and Murder, till he was awakned out of this 2. Sam. 12.
dead sleep, by that message, which God by Nathan sent unto him; and of the
Angel of the Church of Laodicea, who in his carnal security blessed himself
with a false opinion, that his estate was in such a degree of excellency and
perfection, that nothing was wanting unto Apoc. 3. 17.
him, whereas in truth he was exceeding miserable, poor, blind and naked, as
our Savior testifies. The other security which is sensible, brings the
faithful but into an heavy slumber, so as they may say with the Spouse in the
Canticles, I sleep, but my heart waketh, or like Cant. 5. 2.
unto the sleep (or rather disease in sleep) which Physicians call Ephialtes,
wherein they feel this weight of carnal security, lying heavy upon their
hearts, and strive with all their might to shake it off, but are notable, till
God assist them by his Spirit, and thoroughly awaken them by his Word. For the
faithful, in this security, do carefully and conscionably use the means,
whereby they may be freed from it, as the diligent hearing of the Word,
Meditation, Prayer, and such like; and are much grieved in themselves, that
they perform these duties with so much dullness and drowsinesse, and that they
so little profit by them. And this was the case of David, who being somewhat
awakned by Nathan, does fly unto God by Prayer, desiring to be awakned more
thoroughly, and to be more and more quickened by Gods Spirit, and to recover the
operations and feelings of it, which were so much abated in him. Create (says
he) in me a clean heart, O God, and Psalm. 51. 10.
renew a right Spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy Presence, and take
not thy holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and
uphold me with thy free Spirit. And again; My soul cleaves unto Psalm. 119.
25. 88.
the dust; quicken thou me according to thy Word. Quicken me after thy loving
kindness, so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth. So the Church
complayneth unto God of this security and hardness of heart. O Lord, why have
thou made us to err from thy Ways, and Esa. 63. 17.
hardened our heart from thy fear. Return for thy servants sake, the Tribes of
thine Inheritance.

. 6 Of the causes of carnal security in the faithful. First, prosperity,
worldly or spiritual.
Now the causes of this carnal security in the Faithful, are principally
these. First, their abuse of worldly prosperity and temporal benefits, with
which God has blessed them; when as being in themselves common gifts, which
he bestows as often, and in as great plenty, upon the wicked as the godly,
they notwithstanding esteem them as special Testimonies and Pledges of his
love, and so out of this false ground conclude, that he will watch over them
with his Providence, and keep them still in this flourishing estate, safe and
sure from all afflictions and troubles: which moves the Lord, that he may
waken them out of this security, in which they were more apt to rest upon his
gifts then upon the Giver, or at least upon the Giver for the gifts sake, to
deprive them of this prosperity, in which they trust, and to hide his Face
from them in respect of those earthly pledges of his love. As we see in the
example of David. I said (says he) in my Psalm. 30. 6.
prosperity I shall never be moved, thou Lord, of thy favor have made my
Mountain to stand so strong, that is, Thou have so established my Kingdom,
even as Mount Sion, the seat thereof which cannot be removed: But thou did
hide thy Face, and I was troubled. In which security 2. San. 24.
David was, when he numbered the people, trusting overmuch in the arm of
Flesh, and multitude of his Subjects; but was awakened out of this sleep by
the message of the Prophet, and that grievous plague whereby so many of them
were destroyed. Yea, sometime this carnal security in them, is caused through
their spiritual prosperity, and the joyful feelings of Gods favor in the
pledges of saving graces; which makes them to think these comforts will
always last, and that in the strength of them, they shall hold out in the
profession and practice of true godliness unto the end; and so rest more upon
the Springs or Streams of these sanctifying Graces, then upon God himself,
who is the Fountain of them. Which moves the Lord to stop the course, by
spiritual desertions, as it were, at the head of the River, and to give them
over to their own strength without any flow of fresh supply, whereupon these
streams in their sense and feeling are soon wasted, with the scorching heat
of tentations, so as they return to their natural dryness. And to this
security, new Conuerts are most subject, who like fresh water Soldiers,
think that they have wholly conquered all their spiritual Enemies, because
they have gotten the better of them in some light skirmishes; and that they are
sure and firm for ever falling, because they have such feelings of Gods
assistance, and the joy and comfort that does accompany it; whereas in truth,
God tendering their childhood and weakness, does hold them up in their ways,
because he would not at their first venturing to go, have them discouraged by
their falls; and knowing that like untried Soldiers, they are faint-hearted,
and easily discouraged from fighting in the spiritual warfare, he gives them
victory in some small skirmishes, that they may be heartned to endure
constantly and courageously in sorer conflicts. The which they
misse-construing, and attributing too much unto their own strength and valor,
the Lord to drive them from this ill-grounded security, does leave them to
themselves, and suffers them to fall, and to be overtaken with some danger,
upon which they become oftentimes in the sight and sense of their weakness, as
cowardly and fearful, as they were before confident and courageous, and
uncomfortably complain as men forlorn and forsaken of all hope. And this an
ancient Father well observed. Some (says he) think the sweetness of their
imitation, Quidam dulcedin^m incheationis putant sublimi^a^em confirmationis:
and ideo cum tentatio s^quitur derelictos se a Deo putant. Greg. in Moral. lib.
24. cap. 7.
the height of their confirmation, and therefore when a tentation follows,
they judge that they are utterly forsaken of God. And again, For the most part
every one, newly converted, herein slippeth and fails; that whilst he is
entertained with the sweet sense of some gifts of grace for his initiation or
entrance into the course of Christianity, he thinks that he has attained
unto the confirmation of perfection, and esteems it the consummation of full
measure; not knowing that they are but the allurements of inchoation: whereof
it comes to pass, that whilst he is touched and shaken with the tempest of
some tentation, he suspecteth himself to be despised of God, and in the high
way to utter destruction; whereas if he would not give too much credit to the
comforts of his first entrance; he would in his prosperity, prepare his mind
to endure adversity, and would afterward so much the more firmly resist
Vices, coming to encounter him, by how much he had more wisely foreseen them.

. 7 The second cause is spiritual pride.
Another cause of carnal security in the faithful, much like unto the
former, is spiritual Pride, whereby they ouer-weene their own abilities, and
the measure and strength of their gifts and graces received. And so leaving
their only sure dependancy upon Gods power and all sufficiency, goodness,
promises and providence, they begin to depend upon their own strength, and to
put confidence in their own graces and gifts, as though they were sufficient
to preserve them in all good, and defend them from all evil. And hereupon they
grow secure, presuming that they have a staff of strength in their own hands,
which is able to support them from falling into sin, to beat back the
violence of any tentation, to protect them against all enemies, and so to
assist them in all their good endeavors, that they shall be able to hold out
without faynting in the ways of Righteousness, which moves the Lord
oftentimes to withdraw his grace and assistance from them, to lead them into
tentation, and give them over to their own strength, the which failing them,
when they most rely upon it (so as they fearfully fall into grievous sins)
they learn by lamentable experience to give all glory unto God, by whose
strength alone they stand, and in all humility to acknowledge their own
frailty; to cast away all-selfe-confidence and presumption of their own
strength, and to build their security on a surer foundation, even Gods power,
promises, and providence, which will never fail. Austine speaks well to this
purpose. God (says he) sometime takes Deserit aliquando Deus vnde superbis,
vt scias non tuum sed eius esse, and discas superbus non esse. De Nature. and
Great. cap. 28 c. 7. c. 743.
from thee that whereof thou art proud, that so knowing that it is not thine
but his, thou may learn not to be lifted up with pride. An example whereof
we have in the Apostle Peter, who through spiritual pride ouer-weening his
own abilities, and resting securely upon the strength of his own courage and
resolution, and on the great measure of his love toward his Master, vowed that
he would never forsake him, but would adhere unto him in all dangers. Yea, so
confident and presumptuous was he, that when our Savior (who better Matthew. 26.
33.
knew him then he himself) foretold his fearful fall, he contradicted Truth
it self, and would not from his Mouth take notice of his frailty and
infirmity, until he had found and felt it by his own experience.

CHAP. V.
Of the differences between the carnal security of the Unregenerate and the
Regenerate.

. 1 That the carnal security of the unregenerate and regenerate, are in many
things alike.
WE have showed diverse kinds of carnal security, as they are distinguished by
their diverse Subjects and Degrees. Now, because those who are possessed with
these diverse kinds, are apt to mistake the one for the other, the Regenerate
being ready, especially in the time of tentation, to make their state worse,
and the Unregenerate better then it is; It is necessary in the next place, that
we set down the differences, whereby the one may be known from the other, for
the comfort of the godly, and humiliation of such as are lifted up in their
own conceits. The which, I confess, is a thing hard to do, if we consider
the security of the Faithful, as it is in them in the highest degree, and
that which is in the Unregenerate, somewhat abated and weakened with the
accusations of conscience, and the common motions of Gods restrayning Spirit,
stirred up in them at sometimes by the ministry of the Word and afflictions;
especially if in this case we judge according to present sense and feeling. For
they are for the time both alike destitute of the operations of the spiritual
Life of grace, and so both alike dead in outward appearance. Both alike without
the virtue and vigor of the saving Knowledge, Remembrance, and consideration
of those saving Attributes, which work in our hearts the true fear of God,
both taken up alike with selfe-confidence, and drunken with worldly
prosperity. Both usually sinning, and abusing Gods Patience and Mercy, unto
presumption and deferring of repentance, and both alike neglecting, yea,
loathing the means of salvation. Both neglecting to apply by Faith, or
misse-applying the Word which they hear preached unto them; and delighting
rather in a flattering Ministry which will soothe them, then in a faithful
Ministry which will reprove and check them in their evil courses. Both
abusing as well the Mercies as the Judgments of God, and neither profiting by
his benefits nor corrections. Both alike negligent in the service of God, and
in observing his Commandments, or in formalitie and outward show only.
Finally, both alike senseless and without all feeling of their miserable
estate, and so without any desire or endeavor to come out of it, because they
think themselves well, and that they have need of nothing, as we see in the
example of the Angel of the Church of Laodicea, and of Sardis; who had a name
that she lived, but was dead, that is, in Apoc. 3. 1, 2. 17, 18.
a deadly swound, as appears in the Epistle sent by Christ unto him.

. 2 Of the differences between the carnal security of the unregenerate, and
that which is in the regenerate in the highest degree.
But yet howsoever in many things they agree, notwithstanding in some things
they differ. For the security of a Christian, though in the highest degree,
springs from the flesh, as it is in part mortified, and so together with it
has received a deadly wound by the Spirit of God, of which it shall never
recover, although like a Man mortally wounded, it may for a while perform some
actions in as great strength, as when it was in perfect health and vigor, and
like a Candle give as great a blaze, when it is ready to go out, as ever it
did before: but the security of a Worldling is a fruit of the Flesh in its
full vigor, and as it were the child of his strength, and therefore like the
Father, vigorous and long lived, and daily increasing and growing in force and
might, as it increases in age. The security of a Christian is the fruit of
his worst part, even of the old Man and part unregenerate, and so like an old
man's child, decrepit with age, having almost quite spent his natural heat and
moisture, it is weaker in his constitution, and shorter of life, though for a
while it may seem in all things to match a child gotten in maturitie of age
and full strength; but the security of a Worldling is the fruit of the whole
Man, and in his full vigor, without any abatement. That like Esau, is but a
Twin in the wound, resisted by one that is stronger then he, and will prevail,
and howsoever it has the prioritie of Birth and Age, and for a time may seem
stronger, and to carry all before it with force and violence; yet it is matched
and resisted by the true fear of God, which (like Jacob) in wrestling with it
will prevail, and in the end supplant it and get the upper hand. In the
Christian, even in the height of his security, there is the root of Gods
fear, though in the winter of tentation it lies hid and brings forth no
fruits; and there is a seed of Gods 1. Ioh. 3. 9.
grace and holy Spirit ever remaining in him, though hidden under the clods of
sin and corruption, which being watered with the dew and fruitful showers of
Gods Word and Spirit, will sprout up and bring forth plentiful fruits: But in
the Worldling there is a root of bitterness, and his heart had never the
seeds of Gods grace and holy fear sown in it; and therefore nothing is to be
expected to spring out of it, but the Thorns and Thistles of carnal and
sinful actions. The carnal security of the Faithful, does but take away
from them the comfort of their present condition, but not of times past, when
as they have had the sweet feelings of Gods love, shed abroad in their hearts,
and working them to his fear, upon which grounds they may be recovered out of
this sleep with some comfort, when as they know that their state is not
desperate. But the security of Worldlings depriueth them of all true
consolation, past and present, and abuses them with false comforts, which will
end in Horror and Despair. The security of the regenerate is at the worst but
a syncope, and casts them for a time into a swound or trance, leaving no
appearance of spiritual life in respect of motion and outward actions, but it
will not be long ere they recover, and show that life was only hid, but not
quite taken away, by the functions and operations of it in holy and Christian
duties: But the security of the unregenerate is the swound of death, out of
which they never recover, till by their last summons they are awakned to come
unto judgment. The security of Believers in the highest degree, is but like
the frost, which works them for the time to a stony hardness, but the
Sunshine of the Word, heat of Gods Anger, and fire of Afflictions thaweth
them, brings them again to their wonted softness, and causes them to
resolve and melt in the tears of true Repentance; but the security of the
wicked makes them (like Bricke-bats) the more hard the more they are heat by
the former means, yea, of more then adamantine hardness, so as nothing will
soften them, and cause them to relent. Finally, the security of Gods Children,
when it is at the worst, does only like ashes hide and cover under it the true
fear of God, so as it yields for the time no light or heat; and yet it
lives in them, and will revive when Gods Spirit blows upon it, and gives a
fresh supply of grace, as it were, of more fuel. But the security of the
ungodly, like water does quite extinguish it, or rather it could never be
kindled in them, because there is contained in their hearts a main Flood or
Sea of carnal corruption.

. 3 Of the differences between carnal security in the Faithful and Wicked:
and first, in respect of their causes.
And thus we see, that howsoever the carnal security of the wicked and
godly, are alike in many things, yet there are diverse main differences
between them, though it be considered in the regenerate in the highest degree,
and so insensible that it depriueth them of all sense and spiritual feeling of
their dangerous estate and condition. But if we compare that carnal security,
which is ordinarily in the regenerate, and is more subdued and abated by the
Spirit of God, with that which is in the unregenerate Worldlings, we shall find
that the differences between them are many, and much more perspicuous and
easy to be discerned. For first, they differ in respect of their causes from
which they spring, not so much because they are diverse in their nature, for,
for the most part, they are the same, even the same flesh and natural
corruption, and the same fruits which arise from it, but in respect of their
diverse measure and degree. For the security of the unregenerate, is a fruit of
flesh in its full strength and vigor; but that of the regenerate, as it is
mortified, weakened and subdued to the spiritual part. That proceeds from
palpable ignorance, from utter forgetfulness, and total neglect of God in his
saving Attributes, which are the only causes that work Gods fear in our
hearts; and so reigns and rules in them without opposition and resistance,
like a King in his Throne: But this arises from these causes as they are
abated, opposed, and in part subdued by their contrary virtues, the Knowledge,
Remembrance and Consideration of God and his Attributes, of Wisdom, Justice,
Power, Mercy and Goodness. And therefore being much weakened in its natural
strength, like the causes of it; it does not usually in Hostile manner assault
us in the open Field; but like a Tyrant deposed from his Regency, or a slye
Rebel that wants force, it secretly and cunningly steals upon us,
insinuates and windeth it self into our hearts at unawares, when we least
suspect it, and fights against the fear of God out of ambushments and upon
advantages, and sometimes gives it the foil, and for a time makes it give
place; but being renewed and strengthened by the Spirit of God, it re-encountreth
carnal security, drives it from its Holds, and again brings it under
subjection. And the like might be said of all other causes of security before
mentioned, were it not over long to stand severally upon them; all which in the
unregenerate are in their vigor, strength and sole Regency, having no
opposites to moderate and weaken them: but in the regenerate they are in part
mortified by Gods Spirit, subdued, and deposed from their Rule by those Graces
which are contrary to them, and answerably their security is either total,
or but in part, stronger or weaker according to the quality and nature of the
causes from which it springs.

. 4 The second difference in their effects.
Secondly, they differ in their effects, which in the one are more strong and
permanent, in the other more weak and momentaine. For the security of the
unregenerate, strikes with a deadly blow all the powers of the soul, and
brings them into a deep Lethargy, which depriueth them of all sense and
feeling of their disease, and consequently, of all desire to be cured of it;
yea, it makes them (like the blind and dumb Shepherds of whom the Prophet
speaks) to delight Esa, 56. 10.
in sleeping, unwilling to be awakned, and angry with those who use any means
to rowse them up. So that the more they sleep the more they may, till at last
they are brought to eternal death and destruction, or if by the Trumpet of the
Word, sounding loud in their ears, they be somewhat disturbed in their
carnal rest, either with Pharaoh they will not at all acknowledge the voice of
the Lord, nor Exodus 5. 2.
have any desire of reconciling themselves unto him by unfeigned repentance, but
use all means to quiet their minds, that they may fall into their deep sleep
again (as shunning the hearing of the Word, Music, merry Company, and
making themselves drunk with carnal and worldly pleasures and delights) or if
they acknowledge Gods voice, they harden their hearts against it with Herod,
and betake Mar. 6. 19.
themselves to sleep still in their beloved sins; or with the secure Jews,
they inioyne silence to Gods Prophets, that they may sleep still and not be
disturbed in their rest; or with Foelix, they desire to be Act. 24. 25.
respited till they have better leisure, not being as yet willing to be
awakned, but saying with the Sluggard in the Proverbs, Yet a little Pro. 6. 10.
more sleep, a little more slumber, and a little more folding of the hands
together, till at last their Lethargy have as deeply seized upon them as ever
it had done before. But the security of the faithful brings them only into
a spiritual slumber, in which they partly sleep and partly wake, so as they
may say with the Spouse in the Canticles, I sleep, but my heart waketh. It
causes them not to lie down quietly Cant. 5. 2.
on the bed of rest, but only as they are sitting up to nod and take a short
nap, and one while drowsinesse preuayling, they nod and sink down the head,
and soon after rowze up themselves again, and awake out of their slumber.
Neither are they so much ouer-taken, but that every small cause and noise will
recover them out of their sleep, and make them start up; as the sound of Gods
Word rebuking their sloth, the admonitions and exhortations of their friends,
afflictions, and such like. Their senses are not benumbed and stupefied, and so
utterly disabled to execute their functions, but only dulled and blunted. And
therefore with the Spouse, they hear the voice of Christ their Beloved, they
acknowledge it, and are able to put a difference between it and the voice of a
Stranger, they are affected with it, and have a desire to be more and more
awakned by it, that they may hear Cant. 5. 2, 3, 4.
it with more reverence and attention. They are not with carnal worldlings
ordinarily so soundly asleep, as that they know not of it, and so like them
dream that they are waking, and exercised as they ought in all Christian
employments; but have a sense and feeling of their drowsinesse, know that their
imaginations are deluded with vain dreams, and can complain of them, and not
only desire to shake off their drowsinesse and to be thoroughly awakned, but
also use Quare vitia sua nemo confitetur? quia etiam nunc in illis est. Somnium
narrare vigilantis est: and vitia sua consiteri, sanitatis indicium est, etc.
Senec. Epist. 54.
the means which God has sanctified for this purpose. All which do show that
they are more awake then asleep; for it is the action of wakefulnesse to feel
our drowsinesse; and not the sleeper, but he that waketh is able to tell his
dream: yea, finding themselves unable to hold up their heads and shake off
their drowfinesse, they crave the help of those who are more watchful, and
desire that they will stir and rowze them up with their admonitions and
exhortations; but especially they complain of their spiritual sloth unto the
Lord, and desire him to quicken their deadness, and to free them from this
slumber Esa. 63. 17.
of security, by putting into their hearts his true fear. Whereby it
appears that the deep sleep of security cannot ordinarily seize upon them,
because they desire and labor to shake it off; and to this end stir up the
Graces of God in them; as also because the vapors of carnal corruption are
not so gross in them as in the unregenerate, but somewhat rarefied with the
beams of Gods Spirit, and so more easily dispelled with the warmth of Gods
saving Graces, especially the true fear of God. Or if through too much sloth
and negligence they be ouer-taken with it, yet it is not in them a Lethargy
which brings death, as it is in wicked men; but only a sleep, wherein
though there be for a time a cessation of vital functions and actions, yet
diverse infallible signs of life remain, as the pulse, breathing, and natural
heat. For the Christian in this sleep of security, breaths out some holy
desires of being awakned, and not only utters in his words his profession of
godliness, and by his speech discovers that he is a Citizen of the heavenly
Canaan, but also approves his profession by his practice, so that by feeling
the pulse and motion of the vital spirits in his hand, it is easy to guess
at the holy Affections of his heart. And even in this sleep the Spirit of God
is not idle in him, but like the vital heat is still in working, and never
cease to consume and dissipate the gross vapors of carnal corruption, till
being vanished, the Christian awakneth as a man out of sleep, that is, more
fresh and vigorous then before, being now willing to redeem his time lost
through negligence and sloth, by being more watchful, diligent and zealous in
the performance of all Christian duties.

. 5 Another difference in their effects.
So that hence also appears another difference between the carnal security
of Worldlings, and that which is incident to Gods Children; seeing that utterly
disableth them to the performance of all good duties, even as a man that is
dead, or in a deep sleep of Lethargy, is utterly unable to do the actions
of the Living; yea, it causes them to abhor them as irksome and
troublesome: but this only works a temporary neglect of such duties, as
they afterward perform with so much the more care and diligence, after they
are recovered out of this sleep of security. That causes Worldlings to hate
and abhor the means, whereby they might be recovered out of their Lethargy,
because they are in love with their disease, as the consideration of Gods
Justice, Power, Goodness, and the rest of those Attributes which serve to
implant Gods fear in our hearts, the hearing of the Word, Prayer, and such
other helps, of which we shall speak hereafter: but the other which is in the
Christian, being sensible and discerned by him, does work in his heart an
hatred of it, a desire to be freed from it, and an endeavor in the use of all
good means, where by his desire may be satisfied.

. 6 That they differ in respect of the subject.
Thirdly, they differ in respect of their subject; for the carnal security of
the unregenerate possesses the whole heart; but this of the faithful only
that part which remains unregenerate, and at the same time the true fear of
God keeps possession of the regenerate part, continually making war against
carnal security, until in the end it have gotten the victory, subdued it,
and driven it out of its strong hold.

. 7 That they differ in their properties.
Fourthly, they differ in their properties; for the carnal security of
Worldlings is insensible, and in the midst of their deep sleep and
dangerous Lethargy, they suppose themselves waking in their perfect health,
and so complete in respect of their spiritual estate, that they need nothing,
as being highly in Gods favor, strong in Faith, rich in all Grace, and most
assured of eternal salvation. But the security of the faithful is discerned
by them, and no sickness vexes them more, then the stone in their hearts; so
that they are never at ease till they have voyded it. To which purpose they use
carefully all the good medicines prescribed in Gods Word, for the effecting of
the Cure; and flee daily to the heavenly Physician, by their frequent and
fervent Prayers, for his counsel, direction and assistance in this behalf.
And when they feel themselves eased by these means in part, they so rejoice
in the Cure begun, as that withal they cease not to bewail the dregs and
relics of their disease, which they feel still remaining in them. Secondly,
the security of the unregenerate is voluntary and affected, because through
it they quietly live in the pleasures of sin without any disturbance. In
which regard they nourish their sloth, and use all means both to fall into it,
and to continue in it without molestation. They compose themselves with a
settled purpose to take their carnal ease, they make choice of such places and
company, where they may not be disturbed with any noise, either of Gods Word
in the public Ministry, or of the admonitions and rebukes of private
Friends. They put out all light, both the outward light of the Word, and the
inward light of Nature and Conscience; and if these disquiet them by giving
some glimpses into their darkened minds, whether they will or no, they wilfully
shut their eyes, and even blindfold themselves by the interposition of worldly
vanities, that they may not see them. They lay them down to rest, and make
unto themselves soft Pillowes and Beds of down, that they may sleep at ease.
Yea, that they may sleep the more soundly, they cast themselves into the
cradle or lap of prosperity, and desire to be rocked and sung asleep with the
bewitching tunes of carnal pleasures. And so from a sound sleep they fall
into a deep Lethargy, out of which they have neither will nor power to be
awakned; yea, they shun the company of such as endeavor to disturb them of
their carnal rest, and if any seek by admonitions and exhortations to awaken
them out of their sleep, that they may save that labor and not disquiet them,
they are ready (with the Sluggard) to say unto them, that they are awake
already. But above all they hate the very sight of their spiritual Physician,
because they abhor nothing more then to be cured of their disease, which
brings unto them such ease and pleasure. Contrariwise, the true Christian
affects not this sleep of security, but is ouer-taken by it unwillingly and
at unawares. He does not out of a settled purpose and resolution, compose
himself unto it, but through his natural infirmity it creeps and steals
upon him, when he thinks not of it, and desiring to watch with the Disciples,
he finds Matthew. 26.
the Spirit willing, but the Flesh weak. When he feels sluggishnesse to
creep upon him, he labors to shake it off, either by entertayning religious
Discourses and holy Conferences, or by harkning to the shrill Trumpet of Gods
Word, or by employing himself in honest and virtuous Actions. He does not
voluntarily give himself to carnal ease, but that he may be watchful as the
Apostle exhorts, Ephesians. 5. 14.
he arises and stands up. And when he finds all these means too weak to
shake off his drowsinesse, he desires the help of others to keep him waking.
Especially he prays unto the Lord to quicken him with his good Spirit, and to
open his eyes that he may not sleep the sleep of death.

. 8 That they differ in time of continuance.
Finally, the security of the unregenerate and the faithful differ in time.
For they live always in carnal security, and their whole life is a
continual sleep, unless now and then they be awakned and molested with some
outward afflictions, and inward pangs of conscience; and then they do what
they can to compose themselves again to their carnal rest. Yea, in truth,
they are never thoroughly and truly awakned, but even in their waking they are
spiritually asleep; and the pinches and nips of conscience make them to move
but like those that are in a Lethargy, who know not what they do, nor to what
end. They walk sometimes in some seeming good ways, which in respect of the
deed done, might well become the watchful; but it is like those who talk and
walk in their sleep, for though their eyes be open and their legs and tongues
move, yet their hearts are possessed with drowsy deadness, so that they
speak they know not what, and walk they know not whither. But the faithful,
after their conversion, do continually keep the Christian watch, inwardly
waking in their hearts, when they seem to sleep in some outward actions: or
if they be indeed ouer-taken with carnal drowsinesse, by reason of some
relics of carnal corruption remaining in them, yet it is rather a nod or
nap, then a deep sleep; or if also they fall into this through the violence
and strength of their natural sluggishnesse, yet they do not live and die in
it like secure Worldlings, but by the outward sound of the Word, and the inward
voice and power of the Spirit they are awakned and rowsed up, and renewing their
repentance, they do afresh betake themselves to the practice of all Christian
and holy duties.

CHAP. VI.
Of the signs of carnal security, arising from the causes of it.

. 1 That the causes of carnal security do argue and show the effect.
ANd thus we have showed the many differences, which may be observed between
that carnal security which is in the unregenerate, and that which after
regeneration remains in the faithful: And now according to our order
propounded, we are to set down some signs of this Vice, according to which if
we examine our selves, we may discern whether it reigns and rules in us or
no. To the end, that if after due trial and examination of our estate, we find
that it does, we may not content our selves with this fearful condition, and
so continue in it, but may labor earnestly to come out of it, and to this
purpose carefully use the means of which I shall speak afterward. The first
sort of signs are, when we find the causes of this security in us, of which I
have before spoken. For as Effects argue the Cause, so the Cause the Effects;
especially in Vices of this nature, which being diversely considered, are
mutual Causes and Effects one of another. Even as the fire causes the wood to
burn; and the wood burning increases and preserves the heat of the fire.
For so these Causes produce security; which is no sooner bred, but it
presently gives life and vigor to that which bred it. Even as we see in some
Herbs and Flowers, the Root gives life to the Leaves and Branches which
spring from it; and they being grown, the Root again lives in them, and
dies when they are plucked from it. As for example, contempt of Gods Word,
causes Security, and Security being entered into the heart, causes the Word
to be the more contemned.

. 2 The first sign of carnal security, is ignorance of God and his
Attributes.
The first sign then of carnal security, is when men are grossly ignorant,
either through blindness of nature, or affectation. So that we may undoubtedly
conclude, that if Ignorance be seated in the head, Security holds his
residence in the heart. For were they not secure they could not content
themselves to live in this damnable estate, quite destitute of all saving
Grace, or sound assurance and hope of eternal salvation, but would use all
means to come out of it, and to attain unto the saving knowledge of God and
his will. Again, of contraries there is the same reason. But the true fear of
God is caused by saving Knowledge, and this Knowledge is an infallible sign of
Gods fear. Yea, these are mutual causes one of another; for Knowledge is the
cause why we fear God, and the fear of God is (as the Pro. 1. 7.
wise Man says) the beginning of Knowledge. Whereof it is, that Psalm. 111. 10.
the Law of God is called the fear of God, because this fear is wrought Psalm.
19. 9.
in us by the knowledge of it. So Moses is commanded, to gather the Deuteronomy. 31.
12. and 4. 10.
people together, that they may hear and learn the fear of the Lord their
God. As therefore the light of saving Knowledge discovers the habitation of
Gods true fear, so the fogs of Ignorance, which blind the mind, plainly show
to them who have spiritual discerning, that carnal security lodges in that
heart. Neither is there any means to be freed from that security, which is
naturally borne and bred with us, till we know and acknowledge our manifold
sins, whereby we have grievously transgressed Gods Law, and made our selves
subject to the curse thereof, as also the Justice, Power and Truth of God,
whereby he is both able, willing and resolved, to punish them who continue in
their sins without repentance.

. 3 The second sign, is when we are forgetful of God and his Attributes.
The second sign of carnal security, is forgetfulness of God and his
Attributes; when as we seldom or never remember, or think of his
Omnipresence, and all-seeing Wisdom beholding us at all times, and in all our
actions; his Justice and hatred of sin, and those that live in it; his Mercy,
Goodness and love of Holiness and Righteousness, extended to those that
fear and serve him: or finally, of the last Judgment, when as we must give a
strict account of all which we have done in the flesh, before a just and
impartial Judge, which will not let Virtue go unrewarded, nor Sin
unpunished. For as we would think that Malefactor most secure and retchlesse,
who being liable to the Law, guilty of heinous crimes, and bound over to give
an account of all his offenses the next Assizes before an upright Judge, should
spend his time in drinking and reuelling, pleasure and delight, and never
think of the day of his Arraignment, nor how he may so answer for himself,
that he may escape the sentence of death, or procure his Pardon: so much more
is he to be thought not only asleep, but even stark dead in his security,
who never calls to mind either his own sins, or Gods Justice and righteous
Judgments, or those eternal Punishments unto which he is liable, and shall
never escape if in this life he has not procured his Pardon by Faith in
Christ, and bringing forth the fruits of it in unfeigned repentance.

. 4 The third sign Pride and self-Confidence.
The third sign, is Pride and selfe-Confidence; For as the true fear of God
and Humility, are always joined together, and are mutual causes one of
another, so that the more humble we are the more we fear God, and the more
that we fear him the more we humble our selves in his sight, because they both
proceed from the same Root and are streams of the same Fountain; namely, the
saving Knowledge of Gods Wisdom, Power, Justice, Goodness, Truth, and our
own vileness and unworthiness: So Security and Pride accompany one
another, neither could we ever be secure, if Pride did not possess our hearts,
making us to ouer-weene our gifts, and to think our estate better then it is.
Neither could we ever be lifted up with pride, if Security did not shut our
eyes, and stupifie our senses, so as we cannot see or discern, how little
cause we have of being exalted, and how great and manifold of deiection and
humiliation. So confidence in our selves, as in our own wisdom, strength,
merits and worthiness, is a notable sign of carnal security, even as
diffidence in our selves, and affiance in God, is a sure sign of his fear;
and therefore they are joined by the Psalmist, Ye that fear the Lord, trust in
the Psalm. 115. 11.
Lord. For who would not think him most deeply secure, who being assaulted by
a mighty Enemy armed at all points, should trust in a Reed and paper
Buckler, presuming that they are sufficient not only for defense, but also
obtaining victory; especially, if at the same time he should refuse Armor of
proof, and approved weapons being offered unto him. But such and far greater
is their security, who being to fight against, not only worldly Enemies, but
spiritual, even the wrath of God, the curse of the Law, and the tentations of
the Devil; trust in the bruised Reed of their wisdom and strength, and in
the paper Buckler of their own works and worthiness; refusing in the mean
time, the sure defense of Gods wisdom, power and gracious assistance, and the
all-sufficient Shield of his free Grace and Mercy, and Merits and Obedience of
Jesus Christ.

. 5 The fourth sign, abuse of prosperity.
The fourth sign is, when being in worldly prosperity, we abuse it to pride
and carnal presumption, saying with the Wicked, We shall Psalm. 10. 6.
never be moved, nor ever see adversity. For what greater security then to
presume of standing in such slippery places, in which we have seen so many
fall before us? to think that we can keep the Sea in one settled course, whose
nature is to ebb and flow? to keep the Moon constant and always at the
full, whose nature is to change, increase, and wane? or to think that we shall
have for a long time firm fruition of these earthly vanities; when as both
they and we are so mutable and momentanie, as that every day we are in danger
to be taken from them, or they from us? what greater security then to be proud
of a flitting shadow, and to presume of our safety, which is no better backed
then with the strength of a bubble? To think that we can constantly hold Gods
gifts which in their own nature, are the wages of those that fear and serve
him, when as by multiplying our sins, and especially our pride and
presumption, we daily provoke his wrath and move him in his just displeasure to
take them from us? Finally, what greater sign of extreme security, then to be
proud of our Masters wealth committed to our keeping, as if it were our own?
and because we are more indebted, and have a greater account to make then other
men; as though we should never be called to a reckoning?

. 6 The fifth sign, is customable sinning.
The fifth sign, is customable sinning without renewing of repentance;
especially if these sins be committed, not through frailty and infirmity,
but against knowledge and conscience. For howsoever, he that fears God may
fall into sin; yet the secure person alone commits commonly known sins,
which either wound or fear the Conscience. Though he may fall often, as the
wise Man speaks (for in many things we sin all;) Yet he makes not a
custom Eccles. 7. 20. Iam. 3. 2.
of it, neither is it his way* but his slips and errors; but it is the secure
man only that makes sin his usual trade, that walks in the Psalm. 19. 1.
counsatle of the ungodly, as his way, that stands in the way of sinners, as
his place of abode, that sits in the seat of the scornful, as in the
place of his rest and chief repose. Finally, though the faithful through his
own wickedness, and strength of Satan's tentations, may grievously fall into
heinous sins; yet it is not his, but a property of a secure Worldling, to
continue in such sins without repentance. It is a great sign of carnal
security, to commit a known sin, for the base hire of earthly vanities,
seeing (if God take him with the manner and lay it to his charge) it is the
bane of his Soul, the loss of Heaven, and purchase of everlasting torments in
Hell fire. And who not blinded with security, could run these hazards for
things of such small value? But how much more, if having often hardly escaped
these dangers, we make a common practice of thrusting our selves into them by
our ordinary course of sin; and by careless living in these sins without
repentance? For who, not drowned in security, could imagine himself to be in
any safety, that has the halter about his neck, and the knife at his throat,
and is every minute in danger of execution? yea, who can cast himself upon the
Pikes, and take deep draughts of this deadly poison of sin, and yet presume
of health and safety?

. 7 The sixth sign, abuse of Gods Patience to impenitency. Romans 2. 4.
The sixth sign of security, is when a Man takes encouragement by Gods
patience and long suffering, and his own impunitie for his former offenses, of
multiplying his transgressions, and of going on in sin without repentance. For
the riches of Gods goodness, and patient forbearance, should (as the Apostle
says) lead us to repentance, filling our hearts with sorrow, and our faces
with shame, because we have so long and so often offended a God so gracious and
merciful. And besides, it is a notable encouragement to make us hasten our
repentance, seeing upon it we are sure of pardon. For we shall surely find him
gracious in our returning, whom we have found so gracious in our backsliding;
he will undoubtedly show mercy, and pardon our sins upon our repentance, who
has so long time patiently waited, that he might take occasion upon our true
conversion, to have mercy upon us. But if we abuse and despise so great a mercy
and unspeakable goodness, and take occasion of Gods patience and love, the
more to provoke him, and to go on more carelessly in our sinful courses, what
does this argue but an hard and secure heart, which cannot repent, but
treasureth up unto it self wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of
the righteous Judgment of God, who though now he be patient, yet shall at that
day, render unto every man according to his deeds; Romans 2. 5, 6.
rowsing him up with greatest torment and smart, who has lived in his sins
with greatest security; and inflicting upon him the sorest Apoc. 18. 7.
punishment, who has most contemptuously abused his greatest patience.

. 8 The seventh sign, presumption on Gods mercy.
The seventh sign, is presumption on Gods Mercy, whereby the impenitent sinner
persuades himself, that sin he never so much, yet God is so gracious that
he will forgive him, and so takes occasion hereby to give liberty unto his
carnal lusts, that they may glut themselves with their sinful delights, and
embrace all wicked objects without fear of danger. Now, this argues an heart
destitute of all grace, and desperately hardened with carnal security. For
though Gods mercy be great and infinite, yet he has none for them who thus
grossly abuse it, but for those alone who take occasion thereby to reverence his
goodness, and to shun with greater care his displeasure, according to that of
the Psalmist: There is mercy with thee, that thou may Psalm. 130. 4.
be feared; and they only are his true Israel and Vessels of Grace, in whose
salvation he will glorify and set forth the praise of his rich Mercies; who
return and seek the Lord their God, and David their King, that is, the son
of David, and his holy anointed Jesus Christ, and fear the Lord and his
goodness, as the Prophet speaks. Hos. 3. 5.


. 9 The eight sign, is the contempt of the means of salvation.
The eight sign, is the contempt and utter neglect of the means of Grace and
Salvation, as the Hearing, Reading, and meditating in the Word, Prayer, the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, communion with the Faithful and the rest, or
the cold and careless, formal and negligent using of them, without any desire
or endeavor to profit by them. For they whose hearts are seasoned with any
true fear of God at all, do fear and seek his Face, and favor in his holy
Ordinances; they tremble at his Word, as the Prophet speaks, they work out
their Esa. 66. 2. Phil. 2. 12.
salvation, in the use of all good means, sanctified for this purpose, with
fear and trembling, as the Apostle teaches us; their hearts long after the
Waters of Life, like the thirsty Lands; and as the chased Heart Psalm. 42. 1.
bray after the Rivers of Water: and if they be restrained from coming into
Gods holy Assemblies, passionately cry out with David, O how amiable are thy
Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts! my Soul longs, Psalm. 84. 1, 2.
yea, even faints for the Courts of the Lord! my heart and my flesh cries
out for the living God! And when they hear the Law, their hearts melt, as did
the heart of good Josiah, they are astonyed in the sight of sense of their
sins, and hear the Word with trembling, like Ezrah Ezra. 9. 4.
and his Companions. They receive Gods faithful Ministers with all respect and
reverence, though never so mean in their own persons, yet because they are
Gods Ambassadors and do his message; according 1. These. 2. 13.
to that of the Prophet: Who is among you that fears the Lord, Esa. 50. 10.
that obeys the voice of his Servant? herein like unto dutiful subjects, who
reuerencing their King, receive a message from him by his meanest Officer with
awful fear. On the other side, it is an evident sign of a heart possessed
with carnal security, and destitute of all fear of God, when we contemn,
neglect, or carelessly and coldly use these means of our salvation; vainly
presuming that we can come with ease to our iournyes end, and never go in the
way, nor use the means which may bring us unto it; and that we can attain
unto life and salvation, and despise the Word of life and salvation, which is
appointed Act. 13. 26.
of God as the only ordinary means of attayning unto them. When Phil. 2. 16.
our ears are heavy, that we cannot hear; and our eyes shut, that we cannot
Esa. 6. 9.
see: It is a sign, that we have also a fat heart which cannot understand,
that we might be converted and healed; seeing God by the Prophet joins
these together. When with the captive Jews we refuse to Zach. 7. 11, 12.
harken, and pull away the shoulder, and stop our ears that we may not hear;
it is apparent, that we have also with them, made our hearts as an Adamant
stone. When we contemn and even rebel against Gods Word and the Prophets that
bring it, and say with the Jews unto the Seers, see not; and to the Prophets,
prophecy not unto us right things, Esa. 30. 30.
speak: unto us smoothe things, prophecy deceits; If with the men of Anathoth,
We seek the Prophets lives, because we think them ouersharpe in reproouing
our sins, and say, Prophecy not in the Name of Ier. 45. 21.
the Lord, that thou die not by our hand. Yea, though we go not so far, but
only neglect the Word, saying to Gods Ministers, as Foelix to Paul: Go thy
way for this time, when I have a convenient season I will Act. 24. 25.
send for thee, and take every slight occasion to absent our selves, when the
Word is preached; or when we have heard, say with our mouths with the wicked
Jews, or in our actions (which is all one) with many carnal Protestants. As
for the Word that thou have spoken unto us Ier. 44. 16, 17.
in the Name of the Lord, we will not harken unto thee, but we will certainly
do whatsoever goes out of our own mouth. If we esteem Gods Ministers the
worse, because of their Calling, and give them more neglectfull intertaynment,
because they do Gods message. If we hear their Embassage coldly and
carelessly, drowsily and wearily; yea, proudly and scornefully, like the
Courtiers and Gallants of these times, who will outface Gods Ministers when
they labor to discountenance their sins, and hear their Pride, Vanity,
Whoredom, Briberie, Oppression, and other such sins, with geeres and smiles,
even then laughing it out, when they are lashed with the whip of severe
reproof, and have deep gashes made in their Consciences by the Sword of the
Spirit; it is a manifest sign, that we are deeply plunged into this Lethargy
of carnal security, that our hearts are come to Adamantine hardness, our
senses stupefied, and our consciences seared and even gangrened, so that our
diseases are almost desperate and even past cure, unless the Lord the
all-sufficient Physician take them in hand, to whose power and skill nothing is
impossible.

. 10 The ninth sign, hearing the Word without Faith.
The ninth sign of carnal security, is when we hear the Word without Faith;
neither giving credit unto the Promises of the Gospel, whereby we are
encouraged to serve God, nor to the Threatenings of the Law, whereby we are
discouraged in the ways of sin. An example whereof we have in the people of
the Jews, who by Christ's melodious music preaching unto them Gods Matthew. 11.
21.
mercies to the Penitent, were not allured to obedience; nor by John the
Baptists mournful threatenings of the Law, were moved to shead the tears of
hearty repentance. For to hear the Word without Faith, is (as it were) to
receive meat into our hands, wanting a mouth to feed upon it. And as it is a
sign of the true fear of God when we believe his Word, not only that which
is spoken by his own mouth, but that also which from him is delivered unto us
by his Ministers, which is all one in substance, like the Water which is the
same in the Fountain, with that which is conueighed unto us by the Conduit
pipes, as Iehosaphat implies 2. Chron. 20. 20.
in that speech to the People: Believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be
established: believe his Prophets, so shall you prosper; and our Savior
plainly shows, saying, He that hears you hears me, Luke 10. 16.
and he that despises you despises me, and he that despises me despises
him that sent me; because as he was the Angel or Messenger of the Covenant
sent by God, so his Ministers are his Messengers sent by him: So is it a sign
of the want of this fear and of carnal security, when we do not hear with
Faith the Word of the Lord spoken unto us by his Ambassadors. And as it was an
evidence of Noah's Faith, when he took warning by Gods Word, before the Flood
Heb. 11. 7.
came, to build the Arc, as the Apostle shows; and that those Egyptians
feared God, who hearing the threatenings of grievous hayle by the mouth of
Moses, were warned by it, and made their servants Exodus 9. 20.
and cattle flee into the houses: so is it a sign of the greatest security,
when as hearing Gods Word, we give no credit unto it, but carelessly go on in
our sinful courses without repentance, as though we had never heard of either
Promise or Threatening.

. 11 The tenth sign, not applying of the Word.
The tenth sign is, when hearing the Word, we do not apply it unto our
selves, to make use of it for our own good; but that it may lose its effect
and have no operation in us, put it off and apply it unto others. O, this was a
good lesson; would such an one had been here that he might have heard it. That
was an effectual reproof for such a sin; would such an one had been
present who is guilty of it. Wherein these secure Worldlings are only
charitable, wishing better to their Neighbors then unto themselves; and
sparing food from their famished Souls, that others wants may be supplied; if
at least that may be called charity, which begins not at home; or he may be
said to love his Neighbor, who never truly loved himself. Now what does this
argue but deep security, when as men have no sense of their own woeful
estate, nor any desire to come out of it? What does it show, but that their
hearts are frozen in the dregs of sin, when like a stone wall they beat
back all reproves? What does it prove, when being full of wounds and festred
sores, from the head to the foot, they pull off and cast away the salues which
are applied by the skillful Chyrurgeon for their cure, thinking that they have
no need of them; but that they are rotten in their corruption, and their sores
gangrened, which makes them secure and careless, because they have no sense
of smart?

. 12 The eleventh sign, misse-applying of the Promises.
The eleventh sign is, when as we misse-apply the Promises of the Gospel unto
us, which do not at all belong unto us, because we do not perform the
condition of Faith and Repentance. For as the eager longing of the sick
patient, after unwholesome meats and drinks, does show unto the skillful
Physician what humor abounds, because it is the nature of every one of them,
to affect that food whereby it is chiefly nourished: so the Worldlings delight
in feeding upon the Promises of the Gospel, does argue his security, seeing
this spiritual Manna received into a carnal stomach, does nourish and much
increase this disease, not in it own nature, but through the malignant
property of the stomach that receives it, and the gross abuse of these
foolish Patients, who will feed upon these Cordialls of comfort, before their
gross humors are purged by Faith and Repentance, and so are not helped at all
of their diseases, but have the heat of their Fever much increased.

. 13 The twelfth sign, is to delight in a flattering Ministry.
The twelfth sign is, when as men delight in a pleasing and flattering
Ministry, who will soothe them up in their sinful courses, and let them
sleep securely in their wickedness without any disturbance. So the secure and
hard-hearted Jews, being resolved to walk on still in their evil ways,
would either have the Prophets save their labor and not prophecy at all; or
if they would needs take the pains, they condition with them to speak unto
them, not right but smooth things, Esa. 30. 6.
and to prophecy deceits. So the Prophet Michah, out of the experience of his
time, says: If a man walking in the Spirit and falsehood, do lie; or walking
with the wind, that is, be so vain and ambitious of men's praises, that he
will be carried any way with the breath of their mouths, to speak falsehood
and untruth, saying; I will prophecy unto Mic. 2. 11.
thee of wine and of strong drink, he shall even be the Prophet of this
people. And secure and hard-hearted Ahab could not endure the sharp, though
wholesome, reproves of Elias; nor to be crossed in his courses by Michaias; but
is well pleased with the lies of the four 1. King. 22.
hundred false prophets, because they spoke according to his appetite, and
fitted their words and matter according to his humor. The reason is, because
being fully resolved to continue impenitently in their sinful courses, and
even to hazard their souls to extremest perils, rather then to leave
delighting of themselves with the pleasures of sin, they are willing to be
free from all outward checkes of the Word, and inward checkes of Conscience,
and to preserve as much, as may be, their minds in peace and security, that
they may take their fill of carnal delights, when as they are not embittered
with any disturbance. Wherein they are like unto foolish Patients, who
preferring their ease before their health, will not have their festred sores
searched to the bottom by the skillful Chyrurgeon, because they will not
endure the pain of the cure, but rather entrust themselves into the hands of
some Mountebanke and Impostuor, who will take upon him to cure them with a
healing plaster. Or like those who are sick of the Lethargy, who being
insensible of their estate, had rather continue in it without disturbance to
their destruction; then to be awakned out of it by any unpleasing means,
though they are fit and necessary for their recovery.

CHAP. VII.
Of eight other signs of carnal security, arising from the effects of it,
and other Arguments.

. 1 The first sign, not to profit by afflictions. First, on others.
ANd these are the signs of carnal security, arising from the causes of it.
Other signs there are which arise from the effects, and some other Arguments.
As first, it is a sign of a secure and hard heart, when as we do not profit
in Gods fear and obedience by afflictions, and Gods judgments and punishments
inflicted, either upon other men or our selves. Upon others; for every wise Man
is made more wary and watchful by other men's harms. If we see another man
fall that goes before us; when we come to the same place, we do more
carefully look to our footing. If our Neighbors house be on fire, we make it
our own case, and labor all we can to avoid the like mischief. When
Malefactors are severely punished, those that be guilty of the same crimes, if
they have any grace in them, do take warning; and are moved thereby to desist
from those wicked courses, which bring unto the Offenders such shame of smart.
On the other side, we account him a most foolish, retchlesse and secure person,
who takes no warning by other men's evils. We think him a careless child,
who seeing his brother dis-inherited for his vain, loose and riotous courses,
does tread in the same steps, and yet promise unto himself to succeed his
Father in all his possessions. And we esteem him a desperate Malefactor, who
seeing his Fellow executed for felony, does at the same time cut purses. But
yet much more secure and desperate is he to be accounted, who goes on in his
sins against God, when he sees his fearful Judgments executed upon others
for the like wickedness. For whereas one Malefactor may escape the hands of the
Judge, when Esa. 28. 15.
another is taken, or being apprehended, may make better friends, and find more
favor then another, that is weaker in friends and means; God is of such
power, and his hand guided by his all-seeing eye stretches out so far, that
no man either by secret acting of his sin, or speedy and far flying can
escape his Judgment seat; and he is such an impartial Judge, that he
executes righteous Judgment upon all men without respect of persons. Now this
security is much aggrauated, when we will take no warning by those Judgments
which we see executed, not only on those that are far off, but such as are
near unto us; as upon those that have been Partners and Companions with us in
that wickedness which we see punished, in our Neighbors or near Friends, on
those who are of the same Family or Kindred, and most especially when they are
inflicted upon our own Children or Parents. In which respect Daniel
aggrauateth the carnal security of Belshazzar, who having seen Gods
Judgments Dan. 5. 3. 22.
in fearful manner executed upon his Grandfather Nebuchadnezer, for
oppressing Gods people, spoiling the Temple, and sacrilegious taking and
retayning the holy Vessels; took no warning by it, but lived in the same
sins, adding this further unto them, that he abused those holy Vessels in
his profane and drunken feasts. And thou his son, O Belshazzar (says he)
have not humbled thine heart, though thou know all this; But have lifted up
thy self against the Lord of Heaven; and they have brought the Vessels of his
House before thee, and Thou and thy Lords, thy Wives and thy Concubines, have
drunk wine in them, etc.

. 2 Secondly, such as are inflicted on our selves.
But much more does it argue an heart full of carnal security, when as we
make no good use for our repentance and humiliation, of those afflictions which
are inflicted upon our own persons. For, ictus piscator sapit, the burnt child
dreadeth the fire; Et sero sapiunt phryges, (...). Quae nocent docent.
even those that are most dull of conceit, wax wiser by many warnings. And it
is a sign, that we are more senseless through this security, then the Horse
or Ass, if we are nothing moved with the Rod and Spur of Gods chastizements
and punishments. Even many of the Jews, though very negligent and secure in
their prosperity, have this Testimony given unto them by the Prophet, that
they were awakned out of their dead slumber by afflictions, and sought unto God
in the day of their adversity. O Lord (says he) in trouble they have Esa. 26.
16.
visited thee, they have powered forth a prayer when thy chastning was upon
them. Though there were others of them more senseless in their security, of
whose stupiditie the Lord complayneth: In vain have I Ier. 2. 30.
smitten your Children, they have received no correction. And the Prophet: Thou
have stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou have consumed them, but
they have refused to receive correction, they have made their faces harder then
a Rock, they have refused to return. And again, The people turns not unto
him that smites them; neither do they seek Esa. 9. 13.
the Lord of Hosts. But who were these? even such as were more brutish then the
Ox and Ass, as he says in the beginning of his prophecy, Esa* 1. 3, 5.
whom the Lord gives over as a desperate cure, because they grew worse by his
corrections. And yet many carnal Protestants, who are so deeply asleep in
this security, that they do not know that they are in this Lethargy, being
nothing touched with Gods Judgments, do bless themselves in this state,
because they can cover all over with a conceit of patience, saying, Gods will
be done, without thinking any more of it to lay it to their hearts. But these
men will have their victory before any conflict; they will at the first step
leap to the top of perfection in patience, and not ascend unto it by any
degrees. They think that they can in all things submit themselves unto Gods
will, and yet never care in any thing to do his will. They would seem strong
in this grace alone, being weak or nothing in any other, which is impossible;
seeing they are linked one with another, and either are begun or not begun,
thrive or decrease, live or die altogether. And therefore this is not patience
wherewith they delude themselves. For we cannot possess our souls in
patience, till we possess them in peace, peace with God and peace of
Conscience. Neither can we have this peace after our combat with afflictions,
till we have renewed our Covenant with God, whom we have by our sins
displeased, and moved to correct us, by renewing the condition on our part,
Faith and Repentance: without which our patience is nothing but stupiditie and
blockishnesse, not in obedience to God, but out of our senselesnes of his
stripes; not springing from the love of God, which makes us to yield in all
things unto him; but out of self love which causes us to put off all grief
as much as may be, and to this end to cast our selves into this Lethargy,
that we may with more ease sleep out our pain. Finally, it is no fruit of
Faith and affiance in God, but of our carnal security and hardness of heart,
which make us that we cannot be affected either with Gods Mercies or
Judgments. But much more does it argue, that men's hearts are deeply and
desperately besotted with this Vice, when they are not only Stoicall and
blockish in apprehending Gods Judgments* but also use all means to stupifie
their senses, that they may not feel their smart, and to intoxicate their
minds that they may not consider of them, making themselves drunk with
pleasures, that they may have no sense of pain, and casting themselves into
this dead sleep of security, that no grief of sorrow may pierce their
hearts. And when God by his chastizements calls them with the Israelites to
weeping and mourning, to baldness and Esa. 22. 12, 13.
to girding with Sackcloth; they spend their time in joy and gladness,
feasting and reuelling, music and merry company, eating and drinking,
because to morrow they shall dye.

. 3 The second sign, is to have no desire to keep Gods Commandments.
The second sign of carnal security is, when as we have no desire and
endeavor to serve God and keep his Commandments, either Genesis 22. 14. Deuteronomy.
6. 13. Deuteronomy. 10. 12. and 8. 6. Pro. 8. 13 and 16. 6.
in doing the good which he requires, or in departing from the evil which he
has forbidden. For the true fear of God does always stir us up to obedience,
whereof it is that they are usually joined together and often taken the one for
the other. Thou shall fear the Lord thy God, and serve him. And now Israel,
what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to
walk in all his Ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all
thy heart and with all thy soul; to keep the Commandments of the Lord and
his Statutes. So the wise Man says, that the fear of the Lord is to depart
from evil. Hence it is, that the Law is called, the fear of the Lord; and all
other Psalm. 19: 9. Eccles. 12. 13. Psalm. 111. 10: Pro. 1. 7. and 9. 10. Psalm.
128. 1.
virtues and obedience are comprehended under it alone. The fear of the Lord
is the head or beginning of wisdom. And, blessed is every one that fears
the Lord, that walks in his Ways. And contrariwise, the want of all grace,
and neglect of duty and obedience, is comprised under the want of Gods fear.
So the Apostle having set down a large Romans 3. 18.
Catalogue of heinous sins, comprehends all in this one, as the cause of
all the rest. There is no fear of God before their eyes. For security Job 15.
4.
brings men to an utter contempt of Gods Law, and neglect of obedience,
preparing and making them fit for all wickedness. And therefore when we see
disobedience, impiety and neglect of all good duties in the life and outward
actions; we may take it as an undoubted sign, that Security has thrust out
all fear of God from lodging in the heart and affections, according to that of
the Psalmist: The Psalm. 36. 1.
transgression of the Wicked says within my heart, that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.

. 4 Secondly, when we yield obedience but by fits:
But though this sign, where it is to be seen plainly, shows the grossest
security, yet there are other sorts of it more subtle and refined, which
cannot be discerned by it, seeing there are many men carnally secure, who seem
to make conscience of many sins, and of performing many duties. And if we
look upon them in some fits of their devotion, especially in the time of
affliction, we would think that they had in them a great measure of Gods
fear. And therefore in the next place, for discovering of them, we are further
to know, that it is a sign of carnal security, when as we yield obedience
but by fits, and are unconstant in our good desires, endeavors and actions, no
longer fearing and serving God, then whilst his Judgments are imminent or
inflicted upon us. For as it is the property of the fear of God to be
constant it self, and to make us constant in our obedience; according to that
in the Proverbs: Blessed is the man that fears always. Pro. 28. 14. Deuteronomy. 4.
10. 1. Pet. 1. 17. Ier. 32. 39.
So is it a sign, that our hearts are destitute of Gods fear, and possessed
by carnal security, when we are fickle and unconstant, serving God, shunning
sin, and doing that which is good only, when the good mood is upon us, or
when we are driven thereunto either by some approaching or present punishment.
For even the negligent Steward looked about him, when his Master called him to
give an account of his Stewardship. And the most careless Slave that securely
neglects all his Masters commands, will begin to fear him, when he sees him
take the Cudgel into his hand to beat him, or when he feels the smart of
the whip: whereas he that fears God with a sonne-like fear, is always
constant in his duty (although not continually in like measure) because the
Arguments inciting to this fear, are continually the same in themselves, and
he does constantly consider of them.

. 5 Thirdly, when we do not yield obedience to the whole Law, but some parts
only.
Again, it is a sign of carnal security, when as we do not make conscience
of yielding obedience to the whole Law of God, but think it enough, if we
have respect to some part only, though we neglect the rest, as the first
Table without the second, or the second without the first. And that we shall
escape well enough, if we leave some sins, though we retain some other, and
perform some good duties, though we cast others behind our backs. Never
considering that the curse of the Law is denounced against all, who continue
not in Deuteronomy 26. 27. Gal. 3. 10. Iam. 2. 10. Psalm. 119. 6.
all that is written in the Book of the Law to do it. That he who breaks
one Commandment, is guilty of all. That he who truly fears God, has
respect, with David, to all his Commandments, because he is equally the
Author of them all, and requires obedience to one as well as another. Finally,
that some few sins retained can keep possession for the Devil as well as
many, wound the conscience, harden the heart, and on all occasions make an
easy entrance for all their fellows. So also it is a sign of this security,
when as we do not yield obedience with the whole Man, inward as well as
outward; with the heart as well as with the tongue and hand; secretly in our
Closets as well as in the Church and open Streets. For this shows, that we
do not think of Gods all-seeing Eye, which beholds us as well in the
darkest Night as in the brightest Day, and searches and examineth Ier. 17. 10.
not only our actions subject to the view of Man, but also our hearts and
reins. Now, what is this but like foolish and secure Malefactors, to be
careful to hide our faults and crimes from our Fellows and Companions, who
are liable to the same condemnation, and to commit them without fear in the
presence of the Judge.

. 6 Fourthly, when our obedience arises not from spiritual causes, nor is
directed to right ends.
Finally, it is a sign of security, when we content our selves with such a
kind of obedience, as arises not from spiritual causes, nor is directed to
right ends, but is done out of carnal motives and sinister respects. As when
we leave sin and perform good duties, not out of Faith, and the true love
and fear of God, but out of self-love and love of the World. When as we are
moved hereunto by pleasure, rewards or punishments; and aim rather at our own
then Gods glory; and are guided and directed in all our actions, not by the
Word of God, but by carnal reason, proceeding, staying and turning back, as
it suggesteth unto us, worldly inducements or discouragements. For as it was a
sign, that Abraham truly feared God, when as he Genesis 22. 12.
yielded absolute obedience to Gods Command and Word, without taking any advice
from carnal reason; so is it a sign of carnal security, when as we only so
far forth take counsel and direction from the Word of God, as will stand
with our carnal reason and affection, performing those good works, and
forsaking those Vices, which we would do or leave undone, though there were no
immortality of the Soul, no Judgment; yea, no God to behold us, and to
reward our good, or punish our evil actions.

. 7 The third sign, delaying of Repentance.
The third sign of carnal security, is the delaying of our repentance,
thinking that we can repent when we list, and that we may do it time enough in
our old age, or on our sick beds. For as the true fear of God moves us
continually to renew our repentance, as we renew our sins; and still to keep
our Accounts even, that we may always be in readiness against that unknown
and uncertain Day, when as we shall be called to render them before Gods
tribunal Seat of Judgment; so security makes us to carry our selves, like
worldly men, whose estate, by reason of debt and danger, is forlorn and
desperate; who never look upon their books of Accounts to sum them up; yea,
rather keep no account at all, because they are resolved to take their
pleasure securely, and to riot it out as long as they may, and never cross
their delights, nor check their joys, by calling to their mind and
remembrance their after reckonings. Now what can argue greater security, then
through our want of consideration to mistake our repentance, as a thing being
in our own power, and therefore at our command whenever we call for it,
whereas it is the free gift of God, and therefore to be received with all care
and diligence, whilst the acceptable Time and Day of salvation lasts,
wherein the Lord graciously offers this gift unto us? What can more convince
us that our hearts are in this dead sleep, then caresly to put off a thing of
such importance as our repentance is, which concerns us no less then our
eternal Salvation or Damnation, unto aftertimes which are most uncertain, we
having no assurance, no, not so much as of one minute? What shows more
evidently our careless retchlesnesse, then Luke 17.
with the old World and the filthy Sodomites, to live impenitently in our
sins, Eating and Drinking, Buying and Selling, Building and Planting, till
we be swept away with the Deluge of Gods Judgments, and be consumed with his
inflamed Wrath. Or with Belshazzar Dan. 5.
to feast and carowze, till the Finger upon the Wall writ down the sentence of
our condemnation? Finally, if security did not besot us, how could we be so
be-fooled, as to conceive that we may more fitly and conveniently repent long
hereafter, then at the present; when we have, by abusing Gods patience,
incensed his wrath, and moved him to withdraw his gifts and graces? When we
have hardened our hearts with customable finning, so as neither Gods Word nor
Works, Mercies nor Judgments, can pierce into them? When as we are distracted
with infirmities of body and cares of mind; sense of present evils, and fear
of worse? How could we be persuaded to imagine, that we shall more easily make
up our reckonings between God and us, when they are grown so great as they
are sufficient to fill Zacharies large roll, then when they are in Day-bookes
and short Zach. 5. 2.
Scrowles? that we can better come out of Satan's bondage, when he has long
held us in his captivity, and worn us out, and lamed us with his gyues and
fetters of sin, then when we are first come into his thraldom? Or that we
can pull up sin, when by time and continuance it is like an grown Tree
rooted in us, then when it was newly planted, and as it were, in the tender
twigs, if our hearts were not hardened, and the eyes of our understanding quite
blinded with this carnal security?

. 8 The fourth sign, is hypocrisy.
The fourth sign, is Hypocrisy, when as we make outward show of holiness,
and nourish corruption in our hearts; tipping our tongues with a golden and
glorious profession; and angling for praise and commendations, by presenting
unto the sight of men, some seeming good actions, that we may more cunningly
hide and disguise our secret sins. For as sincerity and Gods fear
accompany one another, according to that of the wise Man; He that walks in
his uprightness Pro. 14. 2.
fears the Lord, as we see in the example of Job, who is said to have Job 1.
1.
been a man perfect and upright, and the cause thereof is rendered, because he
was one that feared the Lord* So Security and Hypocrisy are never severed,
but as the Cause and Effect go still together. For if we were not blinded with
security, we could never be so foolish as to imagine, that we may please God
with outward shows, that being a Spirit he will be content with outward and
bodily service, that he can be satisfied with the service of the outward Man,
and that in the Church only, and when we are in good and religious Company,
and let the Devil and the World have the heart at all times, and the whole Man
in places secret and unseen? How could we hope to be out of danger, when we
are in the dark, and doing the works of darkness, seeing Night and Day are to
God alike, and his piercing eye searches and sees even the hidden secrets of
the heart and reins, if our carnal security did not make us believe, that as
we regard not God, but have removed him far from our thoughts, so he as
little respects and thinks of us. Like the foolish Lapwing, who having
hidden his head, becomes secure, thinking that he is no more seen, then he
himself sees others.

. 9 The fifth sign, is to fear Man more then God.
The fifth sign, is when we fear Men more then God, being more careful to
please, and more loath to displease them, then his Majesty. Matthew. 10. 28.
Exodus 1. 17, 18. Heb. 11. 23. Dan. 3. and 6.
For as the true fear of God makes us to neglect men, in comparison of him,
according to the commandment of our Savior; Fear not them that kill the
body, etc. and the example of the good Midwiues, and the Parents of Moses, who
feared God more then Pharaoh, of Daniel and the three Children who regarded not
the Kings Edict, either commanding Idolatry or forbidding Gods true worship,
and the Apostles who professed, that they feared God more then Act. 5.
Men: So it is the nature of carnal security, to make us fear and respect
men, because their rewards and punishments, like unto it self are carnal;
worldly, present and subject to the senses; and to neglect God, though his be
unspeakable and everlasting, because being future and for the time to come, and
as yet not to be seen or felt, we never consider nor think of them. Herein,
much like unto foolish children, who fear more the Schole-master, threatening
to whip them, because of the present smart; then the deserved threats of their
just Father, though they concern them no less, then their reiection out of
his favor for the present, and dis-inheriting from their patrimony in time to
come.

. 10 The sixth sign, immoderate fear in time of danger.
The sixth sign of carnal security, is immoderate fear in time of danger.
For it is an ordinary thing with Vices, when they are a little checked and
crossed, to turn into their contrary extremes; As of presumption into
despair, profane mirth into deep melancholy, insolent pride into most abject
baseness; as we see in the example of Benhadad, who being exalted in the
opinion of his irresistable forces, 1. King. 20. 3. 10. 32.
gloriously boasts that the King of Israells silver and gold, wives and
children, were already his before the battle, because the dust of Samaria
could not suffice for handfulls for all the people that followed him; but being
put to the worse in the battle, he becomes cowardly base, sending his
servants with halters about their necks, to acknowledge his service, and to beg
for life. And thus it fares with carnal security, which in the time of
prosperity and safety, is bold and confident, but when danger approaches
entertayneth all fears, and is presently daunted and dismayed with the shaking
of a leaf. As we see in the example of the Apostle Peter, who was most
confident and Matthew. 26. 33.
secure in his own strength before he was tried; but when he sees himself
in some peril, every skar-crow makes him afraid. And as Pro. 28. 1.
the true fear of God expels other fears (like that wind which is
strongest in a whirlewinde where diverse meet) according to that of the
Apostle, We have not received the spirit of bondage to fear again, Romans 8. 15.
but the Spirit of adoption; and because as Saint John says, perfect love 1.
Ioh. 4. 98.
casts out fear, as the air gives place to the good liquor when it is
powered into a vessel, and all other lights vanish at the appearing of the
Sun: So contrariwise carnal security, which is most contrary to fear,
when it is vpheld with worldly safety and peace; does give place in the time
of danger unto it; which being entered causes us to fear shadows as well as
substances, and not only that which has being in truth, but such false
dangers as we give being unto by imagination and fearful apprehension.
According to the saying of the Psalmist; There were they afraid where no fear
was; and that of the Psalm. 53. 5.
wise Man; The Wicked flees when no man pursues, but the Righteous Pro. 28. 1.
are bold as a Lion.

. 11 The seventh sign, is to run from God and to rest on inferior means, in
danger and affliction.
The seventh sign is, when we run from God in the time of danger, unto
secundarie causes and inferior means, which failing, we wholly distrust God as
not able or willing to help us, and being forsaken on all sides, we are wholly
possessed with fear, and so by it are plunged into despair. For as he that
truly fears God for his Goodness, All Sufficiency, Justice, Mercy, Power
and Providence, is moved by the same Attributes to put his trust and affiance
in him in all dangers, like the loving child who the more he fears and
reuerenceth his Father, the more ready he is to flee unto him in confidence of
his help when any peril approaches, because the same motives serve for both;
and as they who sanctify the Lord of Hosts by letting him to be their fear
Esa. 8. 13, 14.
and dread, may be assured that he also will be their Sanctuary, unto which
when they flee in time of danger, they may be in safety, as the Prophet Esaias
speaks: So he whose heart is destitute of Gods fear, and taken up with
carnal security, never thinks of those Attributes which seem to work in
us both fear and affiance; but thinks that God sits in Heaven, not
regarding what is done upon the Earth; and says in his heart, the Lord will
do neither good or evil. The Zeph. 1. 12.
which as it takes away from him all fear of God, so also all affiance;
neither will he who has neglected to reverence him as his Father, flee unto
him in time of danger with any confidence, as his Patron and Protector; but
will rather cast himself upon inferior means, wherein he trusts, and flee
any whither then unto God, from whom his heart being wholly estranged, he
expects no help at his hands in the time of trouble.

. 12 The eight sign, is contempt of Gods Ministers.
Lastly, it is a sign of carnal security, when as in our hearts we do not
reverence his Ministers and Ambassadors, who in the work of their ministry
represent his Majesty, and in an especial manner bear in them his Image. For
as he that truly fears his King, does in the execution of their Office
reverence not only the Lord Chancellor and Chief Justice, but even the meanest
Major or Bayliffe, who represent his person, and come in his name, to inioyne
that which he has commanded; so he that fears the King of Kings, reuerenceth
also not only the person of Kings and Princes, because they bear in them the
Image of his Power and Sovereignty, but also his Ambassadors, who bring unto
us his Word of Truth, which has no less power in spiritual and heavenly
things, then the word of the greatest Monarch, speaking on Gods behalf about
things that are earthly and temporal; for they have authority given them to
judge the people, Ezech. 20. 4.
as the Lord speaks to the Prophet; and they have a large Commission given
them for the execution of their Office and ministerial Function, both for
absoluing the penitent Believer, and condemning the unbelieving and impenitent
sinner; not in their own authority (which the Popes challenge as belonging
inseparably to their Sea and Place, which inableth them to bind and loose
absolutely without respect of persons, penitent or impenitent, or any condition
to be observed by the party, saving such as respect the Popes profit;) but
declaratiuely as Gods Messengers, speaking in his Name; according to that of
our Savior: Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted Ioh. 20. 23.
unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. In which
respect it is an evident sign of a secure sinner, whose heart is destitute of
Gods fear, when as he shows no reverence and respect to his Ambassador,
sent unto them on so weighty a message, which concerns them as much as their
eternal life or death. Besides, it argues plainly, that their heart is still
possessed with carnal security, who show no reverence unto the Preachers of
the Gospel; for they are the only means of awakning and rowsing men up out
of this spiritual Lethargy, wherein otherwise they would sleep to their
everlasting perdition; and therefore it is not possible that any, who have
received this great benefit by their means and ministry, but that for ever
after they should respect and reverence them, who under God were and are the
alone instruments and means of conferring and preserving this benefit upon
them. And so much for the signs of carnal security, according unto which if
we carefully examine our selves, we may clearly know in what case we stand,
and whether our hearts are possessed with the true fear of God; or being quite
destitute of it, they be wholly taken up with carnal security. To the end,
that if we find our selves infected with this dangerous poison, we may use the
means following as spiritual Antidotes, to overcome and drive it from our
hearts; or if we find our hearts purged already in some measure from it, and
endued with Gods fear, we may use them notwithstanding, that we may be more
and more cleansed from this security, and that the fear of God may be still
preserved and increased in us.

CHAP. VIII.
Of such Reasons as may move us to abhor carnal security, and to use all
means either to prevent it, or to be freed from it.

. 1 That it is necessary to have our hearts wrought unto the hatred of this
Vice.
IN the practice of physic it is a thing of greatest difficulty, to discover
truly and thoroughly the disease of the Patient, and the state of his body; and
yet this skill is most necessary, seeing they who fail in this point alone,
must needs fail in all the rest, applying unfit, if not hurtful medicines,
which weaken the body and strengthen the disease. But yet it is not enough that
the sickness by the symptoms and signs be plainly discerned; and the causes
and effects, properties and qualities of it well known; if the learned
Physician and sick Patient proceed no further; but it is also required for the
effecting of the cure, that there be first a willingness in the Patient to be
healed of his infirmity, with a resolution to use the medicines which shall be
prescribed; and then skill and faithfulness in the Physician, to prescribe
such as are effectual for his recovery. And thus it fares with the
spiritual diseases of the soul, the Patient and Physician. For we must first
labor to know what the sickness is by the signs thereof, and then be
careful in prescribing and applying the best remedies. And therefore having
plainly discovered this dangerous disease of carnal security by the signs of
it, it remains now that we come to the cure, and show the means whereby he
who finds himself sick of this pernicious disease, may be recovered to
spiritual health. And first, because the skill in the physician is nothing in
prescribing the best means, except there be also a will in the Patient to use
and apply them; I will use some motives to persuade all that find themselves
affected with this sickness, to desire with all earnestness that they may be
cured, that so they may be made willing also to apply the remedies. And because
all physic, both for body and soul, is in it self, or at least in conceit
unpleasant to the Patient; and none are willing to use it, but those who feel
the pain or see the danger of their disease; therefore it is fit that we set
down the nature, properties and effects of this carnal security, that so a
desire may be wrought in those who are subject unto it to be cured of it. The
which is more necessary in that this sickness is not painful to the Patient,
but insensible, like the lethargy or dead palsy; yea, in truth most pleasant
and delightful to the most, so that he who has it, is naturally loath to be
cured of it, because he lives at ease without disturbance, inioyeth quietly
all his worldly comforts, and goes on to his destruction with a cheerful
heart and merry countenance. And therefore the less he feels the pain, the
more he needs to see the danger; and seeing himself cannot apprehend it,
because this disease affects the mind and takes away the understanding, so
as it cannot naturally be discerned by the party that has it; I will show how
desperate and pernicious it is unto all those, who do not use the means
whereby to be recovered.

. 2 That Christ has given us special warning to flee security.
The danger of this disease hereby appears, in that Christ the great and
chief Physician of our souls, does so carefully give warning of it; using all
means to let all those that are his to see the danger, and to take such
courses as they may prevent it, or being tainted and ouer-taken with it, may be
awakned and rowsed up out of this sweet, yet pernicious slumber. And this he
does both by Parables, Examples, and Admonitions, and Exhortations, which he
presses and enforces from them. For first, this is the main scope of the
Parable of the wise and foolish Virgins, of which, they being possessed with
the true fear of Matthew. 25.
God, stood carefully upon their watch, expecting the uncertain coming of the
Bridegroom, and so when he came, were received with him into the bridal
Chamber of eternal blessedness; but the other being secure and retchlesse,
spent their time in ease and sloth, not using any means to be prepared
against the time of his approaching, who being taken upon the sudden, unprovided
and unfurnished of the oil of saving grace, and the light of an holy life,
were excluded from the marriage feast, and deprived of the fruition of heavenly
happiness. To this end also tends the Parable of the wise and faithful, and
the evil and unfaithful Servant; the one expecting daily his Masters coming,
carries himself in all his affairs, and toward his fellows, so wisely and
honestly, as if his Master were already present, and he is for his Matthew 24.
45. Luke 12. 42.
reward pronounced blessed, and made Ruler of all his Master has, for his
fidelity and care at his coming. The other being made secure, because his
Lord delayeth his coming, behaueth himself so as though he thought he would
never come, smiting his fellow servants, and eating and drinking with the
drunken, who is taken upon a sudden by his Master, and in a day when he looks
not for him, and for his reward is cut off and appointed to have his portion
with the Hypocrites, where shall Luke 12. 18, 19.
be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Finally, at this our Savior also aymeth in
the Parable of the rich Man, who abounding in all provision, and having more
Corn and Fruits then room to bestow them in, gives himself to secure rest
and ease, saying to his Soul, Thou have much goods laid up for many years,
take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But out of this secure slumber he
is quickly awakned with Gods voice, saying; Thou Fool, this night thy soul
shall be required of thee, and then whose shall those things be which thou have
provided?

. 3 The examples of security in others severely punished, ought to be warnings
unto us.
To this purpose our Savior also produces examples, moving us to be wise by
the experience of others harms. As the example of Luke 17. 26.
those who lived before the Flood, and of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, who
lived securely in their sins, eating and drinking, buying and selling,
planting and building, marrying and giving in marriage, as though they had
been free from all danger, and sure that those pleasures would have ever
lasted. But the issue of this sinful security was, that they were surprised
with Gods fearful Judgments at unawares; For no sooner was Noah entered into
the Arc, but the Flood came and drowned them all; and presently after that Lot
was gone out of Sodom, those sinful and secure Cities with all their
Inhabitants, were terribly consumed with fire and brimstone. And from both
these Parables and Examples, the Lord raises admonitions and inforceth
exhortations, moving us to shake off carnal security, and being affected with
Christian fear, to stand carefully upon our watch, and to be instant in
prayer, that we may be found ready at Christ's appearing. Watch therefore, for
you know not what hour your Lord does Matthew. 24. 42.
come. And again, Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning.
Luke 12. 35, 36.
And ye your selves like unto them that wait for their Lord when he will
return from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks, they may open
unto him immediately. Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when he
comes, shall find watching, etc. And this know, that if the good man of the
house had known what hour the Thief would come, he would have watched, and
not have suffered his house to be broken through. Be therefore ready also; for
the Son of Man comes at an hour when ye think not. And elsewhere: Take
you heed, watch and pray, for Mark. 13. 35, 36.
ye know not when the time is, etc. least coming suddenly, he find you
sleeping. By all which we see the necessity of an holy and religious fear,
stirring us to watchfulness, and the extreme danger of carnal security. For
if that be not without much hazard and peril, and ought to be carefully
shunned of us, whereof our Savior gives us once warning, then how jeaperdous
and full of extreme danger is this carnal security, and with how great care
to be avoided of us, of which Christ gives us so many warnings, as of nothing
else more often and earnestly, in so many and such great variety of Parables,
Examples and Admonitions. And withal, thus much is employed hereby, that as
this sin of security is great and dangerous, so we are naturally most prone
to be ouer-taken by it, which moves our Savior to use so many and effectual
means to preserve us from it, or to awaken us out of it, if we be already
fallen into this spiritual Lethargy.

. 4 That Christ's holy Apostles have given us many warnings, to take heed of
carnal security.
With like care and earnestness, do Christ's holy Apostles admonish and warn
us, to take heed of this dangerous and pernicious Romans 13. 11, 12.
sin of carnal security. The Apostle Paul tells us, that now it is high
time to awake out of sleep, because now our salvation is nearer then when we
believed, that is, then at our first conversion, when as we begun to believe.
And therefore as Runners for a prize, make most speed when they come nearest
unto the Goal: so should we be most careful in shaking off all security and
sloth, and in running swiftly in the Race of godliness, when we approach to the
Goal of blessedness: and exhorts us, that seeing the Night is far spent,
and the Day is at Ephesians. 5. 14, 15.
hand, we do therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the Armor
of light. And again: Awake thou that sleep, and arise from 1. These. 5. 6.
the dead; and Christ shall give thee light. See that ye walk circumspectly,
not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. And
elsewhere: Let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober, etc.
And because we are always in danger, he would have us to be at no time
retchlesse and secure, but seeing we have innumerable enemies ever ready to
assault us, he exhorts us to have continually the whole Armor of God fast
buckled unto us, that we may be able Ephesians. 6. 11:
to stand against the wiles of the Devil. So the Apostle Peter upon the same
ground, exhorts us to shake off carnal security, and to stand still upon
our guard with all care and watchfulness. Be sober (says he) be vigilant,
because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring Lion walks 1. Pet. 5. 8, 9.
about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist steadfast in the Faith.

. 5 That carnal security is a most dangerous sickness of the soul.
But that we may be moved to abhor this sin of carnal security with
greater hatred, let us further consider, that it is a most fearful and
pernicious vice, which has in it all relations of ill, being not only in it
self exceeding evil, but also the cause of many and grievous evils. In it
self it is a disease of the soul most dangerous and desperate, unless it be
cured by unfeigned repentance; for there is no disease more pernicious to the
spiritual Patient, sick in sin, then the stone in heart, or if you will an
heart of stone; no stone so hard and hardly broken. For though the voice of the
Lord be so powerful and full of Majesty, that it breaks the Cedars,
shakes the earth and makes it to tremble; yea, renteth the Rocks, turning
them into a standing water, Psalm. 29. 4, 5. and 114. 8. Number. 20. 11.
and the Flint it self into a Fountain of waters, as the Psalmist speaks;
yet it moves not the secure and stony heart, nor resolves it into the tears
of repentance; and therefore we read that when the Word of God by the Prophet
was so mighty, that it claue insunder the stony Altar, yet the more hard and
stony heart of Jeroboam, was not at all 1. King. 13.
affected and pierced with it; but notwithstanding all Gods terrible
Threatenings he goes on securely in his sin. It is (as the Prophet calls
it) that Spirit of deep sleep, which closes up men's eyes, and depriueth them
of the spiritual use of their senses and understanding, making the Vision and
Word of the Lord, as the words of a Book which is Esa. 29. 9, 10, 11.
sealed; so as Gods Ministers may complain of such, as he does in the same
place, that they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with
strong drink. Neither is it an ordinary sleep, but that dangerous Lethargy
of the soul, which makes men as unfit to all holy duties and spiritual
exercises, as death it self makes them unapt and unable to perform any
natural or moral actions. It is the Devils cradle, in which he lulleth men
asleep, so as he may do with them what he pleases; that deadly stinging Viper
which brings them into the deep slumber of death and destruction; and that
Cart of Hell, which in the dark night of Ignorance, carries quietly and
without noise, huge multitudes into the Pit of everlasting death. Finally, it
is that Circes, that Siren, that Witch, which transformeth men into bruit
beasts, and depriueth them not only of all grace, but even of natural reason
and understanding. It is a seeming peace, more Nimia securitas mentis tempestas
est. Gregor. in Moral.
dangerous then any war; and in outward appearance a quiet calm, but in
truth the most perilous tempest, in which many millions of souls do suffer
shipwreck, and sink into the gulf of endless perdition.

. 6 That carnal security is a disease hardly cured.
And as this security is a dangerous and grievous disease, so in this respect
it is the more pernicious, because it is hardly cured, and that in a double
respect; first, because insensible diseases are in themselves most desperate,
as the Lethargy, dead palsy, apoplexy. And even in acute sicknesses, as
Feauers and burning Agues, we account the patient most hopeless and helpless,
when as he is past feeling of his sickness. Thus also the wounded members are
most hardly cured, when by much effusion of blood and spirits they are become
stiff and benumbed. And whereas green wounds, which are most sharp and
painful to sense, are soon healed; those which are full of dead flesh,
gangrened or turned into Cankers, as they are freest from pain, so are they
furthest from curing. And thus it also fares with those who are spiritually
sick, and wounded with the sores of sin; the more sensible they are of their
grief, the more hope there is of their recovery; and contrariwise, the more
senseless and stupid, the more hardly can they be restored to their spiritual
health. For as Augustine says, Quod non dolet non pro sano, sed pro ^ortuo
computandum. August.
that wound which payneth not, is not to be esteemed sound, but dead.
Secondly, because he who is not sensible of his disease, thinking himself
already well enough, does use no means whereby he may be recovered; the
which is also the condition of those who are sick of this senseless
security; they think they are in good case, rich in all things, and have need
of nothing, as we see in the example of the Angel of the Church of Laodicea;
and therefore seek not to better their Apoc. 3. 17.
estate till God open their eyes, and gives them the sight and sense of their
poverty and wretchedness. In which regard we may fitly say to those who are
sick of this security, as Bernard to Eugenius, there is Nihil plus metuo tibi
pace ista. lib. 1. de Gonsid.
no greater cause of fear, then such peace and quiet.

. 7 That carnal security is the cause of all sin.
But as this security is in it self evil and sinful, so is it the cause of
all evil, and that both the evil of sin, and also the evil of punishment.
Pro. 13. 14.
For as the fear of God restrayneth those who are endued with it from all
wickedness, and as the wise Man speaks, is like the Wellsprings of life to
make us flee from, and escape the snares of death; so this carnal security
keeps open house for all impiety and sin, whilst the secure person
presumes not only of impunitie, notwithstanding that he fatteth himself with
the pleasures of sin, but also promises unto his soul the long fruition of
his present prosperity, and afterward the perpetual possession of
everlasting happiness. So the Psalmist says, that the workers of iniquity
boasted themselves in their wickedness, Psalm. 94. 4, 5, 6.
broke in pieces the Lords people, and afflicted his heritage, murdered the
Widow, Stranger and Fatherless, saying, the Lord shall not see, neither shall
the God of Jacob regard it. And the Prophet tells us, that Babylon lived in
all voluptuousness, securely presuming that she should be a Queen for ever
and see no evil. Thus Abraham Esa. 49.
concludes, that the Egyptians were fit for Rapes, Murder, and all outrageous
wickedness, because there was no fear of God in the Land. Genesis 20. 11.
And the Apostle having set down a Catalogue of many grievous sins; sets
down this as the mother sin and cause of all the rest, that there was no
fear of God before their eyes. Romans 3. 18.


. 8 That security emptieth the heart of all grace, and prepares and makes it
fit to receive Satan, with all his tentations.
For security which emptieth the heart of all fear of God, not only
encourages the flesh to go on in all sinful courses, which will yield unto it
delight, profit or preferment, because there is no fear of danger, and
entertayneth all the tentations of the World, which bring with them any carnal
contentment, but also sets the door of our hearts wide open to let in
Satan, and makes way for all his tentations. For when this evil spirit and
enemy of our salvation, would lay more firm and sure hold of such as he
already possesses, he departs for a time, as though by the power of Gods
Word and Spirit, he Matt. 12. 43, 44.
were cast out and vanquished. But when hereby he has made them secure and
retchlesse, he returns again, and finding his house (that is their hearts)
empty and clean swept, with this beesom of carnal security, of all
spiritual graces, and garnished with all vices, which are the ornaments in
which he most delights, He takes with him seven other spirits, more wicked
then himself, and they enter in and dwell there, and so the last state of that
man is worse then the first. So that if security has first taken up the
room, Satan may at his pleasure make an entrance and get an easy victory.
For as in civil affairs, nothing does more expose a state to desperate
danger, then when through prosperity and ease it becomes secure, fearing no
enemy, nor suspecting the approach of any evil, as the stories of Troy,
Babylon, Carthage, Rome, and many others, do make it manifest; so nothing does
more endanger our souls, to be sacked and spoiled of all grace, by our
spiritual enemies, then when being taken up with sloth and security, we fear
no danger. So that the Devil, World and Flesh, intending to assault us (as the
Danites, the men of Laish) may encourage Iud. 18. 7. 10.
one another with assured hope of victory, because they are to fight against
such as are quiet and secure, and therefore easy to be overcome. For this
security is the mother of Sloth and Negligence, making men not to regard their
enemies strength and malice, nor their own danger; and consequently, to omit
all means of their own safety. Yea, not only do our spiritual enemies
thus finally vanquish the vessels of wrath prepared to destruction; but
oftentimes Ad vnius horae ebrietat^m nudat faemora quae per 600. annos
sobrietate contexerat. Hieron. ad Ocean.
foil and lead captive unto sin Gods dearest servants, as we see in the
example of Noah, who persisted in his justice and integrity in time of danger,
but when the Flood was past, and he secured from all fear, he is foiled by
Satan in his own family. So Lot who stood in his uprightness, when he lived
in danger among the Sodomites, fell shamefully in the sole company of his own
daughters. And David, who in the time of his persecution by Saul, was a
pattern of piety, when he walked securely on the Roof of his Kingly Palace,
was tempted and overcome. But yet this security arising from outward causes,
does not so much endanger us, as that which arises from an opinion of our own
strength, and the weakness of our spiritual enemies, because we have gotten
the better of them in some conflicts. For it makes us to neglect the chief
pillar of our strength, the power and providence of God, and all good means,
whereby we might be enabled to stand in the day of battle; and so
encourages our enemies to assault and set upon us, and weakneth our hands in
making resistance. Whereby Saepe quem tentationis certamen superare non valuit,
sua deterius securitas strauit, etc. Greg. in Moral. Saepe men's dum virtutis
suae securitate resoluitur infidiante aduersario inopinatae culpae telo
perforatur. ibid.
(as one says) oftentimes it comes to pass, that he whom the conflict of
tentation could not overcome, is shamefully foiled by his own security. And
the mind becoming loose and negligent in security of its own virtue, is
pierced and wounded with the weapon of an unexpected fault by our treacherous
enemy. And this is the cause, why the Lord continually exercises his servants
in the spiritual warfare, and suffers the enemies of their salvation to
skirmish with them, that they may be preserved from security, which is far
more dangerous then any war. And as Scipio wisely advised in the Senate, that
Carthage should not utterly be destroyed, lest the Romans with too much peace
and security, should become slothful and effeminate, and so be easily
subdued by some other enemies: so the Lord would not give us a full victory
over our spiritual enemies, but suffers them (though with ouer-ruled and
abated forces) to skirmish with us, that we may not become slothful and
secure, and so exposed to more danger. And thus we see, that carnal security
is in it self a dangerous evil and grievous sin, the which should move us
with irreconcilable hatred to abhor and make war against it; never being at
rest, till by the use of those good means which God has sanctified for this
purpose, we have banished it out of our hearts, and in stead of it,
established in them the true fear of God.

CHAP. IX.
Where is showed that carnal security is the cause of many fearful
punishments.

. 1 That carnal security depriueth of Gods favor and protection, and
dispoyleth us of all spiritual grace.
But that we may be moved to pursue this Vice with more deadly hatred, and more
carefully use all good means to be armed against it, let us now further
consider, that as it is the evil of sin, and the cause thereof, as has
been showed; so also it is the cause of the evil of punishment; yea, it self
is also a punishment of other sins. Concerning the former: This security
exposes us to many evils both privative and positive. For it depriueth us of
Gods assistance in the day of tentation, whilst it blinds our eyes, that we
cannot see the want of his help, hardneth our hearts that we cannot desire it,
and shuts our mouths that we cannot crave it by our fervent prayers. It
dispoyleth us of the rich furniture of Gods saving graces, by causing us to
neglect, or formally and coldly to use the means whereby they should be
nourished and increased, as hearing the Word, Reading, Meditating, Prayer, and
the rest, presuming that we are well enough, safe, and in good estate without
them; whereupon must needs follow their languishing and decaying, if this
security be still cherished in us. For the strongest bodies will wax faint
and weak, if they be deprived of their food whereby they should be
nourished. The greatest flame and fire will soon go out, if it be not fed
with a new supply of fuel and kept in by blowing. The greatest state will
soon be consumed, if men lauishly spend upon the stock, and use no means to
add unto it. The best Vines will grow wild, and bring unripe and sour Grapes,
if they be neglected and be not pruned and well ordered. The most fruitful
ground, will in stead of good Grain, bring forth weeds, Thorns and Thistles,
if it be not husbanded and manured. And thus it fares with us in our
spiritual estate, our strength of grace will turn unto weakness, if in our
security we think our selves so strong, that we need not to cherish them
with the spiritual Manna, and means of grace and salvation. The fire of the
Spirit will be extinguished, if we cast upon it this cold water of security,
and do not continually re-enliue it by blowing upon it, and stir up the
gifts and graces of God in us, as Paul exhorts Timothy. We shall soon
break and 2. Tim. 1. 6.
be banke-rupted in our spiritual state, if thinking with the Laodiceans,
Apoc. 3. 17.
that we are rich enough and have need of nothing, we neglect the means
whereby the main stock of Gods graces may be preserved and increased in us.
We shall like degenerate Vines, in stead of sweet, bring forth nothing but
sour Grapes, if we neglect the continual purging and pruning of our selves
from our superfluous lusts, and do not preserve our hearts well ordered and in
the fear of God. Finally, in stead of the fruits of Virtue, we shall breed and
bring forth nothing but the weeds of Vice and Sin, if we neglect our
spiritual husbandry, break not up the fallow grounds of our hearts, weed
them not of thornie cares, manure them not by the use of all good means,
whereby they may be made rich and fertile, and sow not in them the good seed
of Gods Word, which will bring forth in us the fruits of Holiness and
Righteousness.

. 2 Of some special graces whereof carnal security depriueth us.
More particularly, our light of knowledge will soon grow dim, if we
securely content our selves with that we have, and do not more illuminate our
understanding by the light of Gods Word, from which (as the light of the Moon
from the Sun) it was first borrowed. Or else, if it remain quick and sharp
in theorie and speculation, it will wax vain and unprofitable in respect of
use, and no way further but rather hinder us in the ways of godliness. Our
faith will become faint, if through security we carelessly neglect the means
of Hearing, Romans 10. 17. 1. Tim. 1. 5.
Reading, Praying, etc. seeing it is nursed and cherished by the same means,
by which it was bred and borne in us. Our love will wax cold and fruitless,
if we grow secure and sluggish with the Spouse in the Canticles, neglecting to
see and seek the face of our Beloved in Cant. 5. 2. 6.
the use of his holy Ordinances, to harken to his Voice, not meditating on his
infinite love, wherewith he has loved us: upon which cooling of our affection
toward him, he will withdraw himself, and hide from us his loving Countenance
(as it is in the same place) and so we shall also lose the sweet and
comfortable sense and feeling of his love in our hearts, till we have shaken
off our carnal security, and have diligently sought his face and favor by
renewing our faith and repentance. Our affiance in God will soon languish, if
we either securely flatter our selves with a conceit that we are out of
danger, or have strength in our own hands to prevent or overcome it, neither
can we catch sure hold of this staff of our strength, till we see what need
we have of it, and have cast out of our hands the brittle Reed of our own
abilities. Our fear of God will quickly fail and give place, if we nourish
security, which is an utter enemy and opposite unto it; for contraties,
without mean, cannot be in their strength and vigor in the same subject at
the same time; and if we neglect, through this security, the means and
causes of Gods fear, as the meditating on his Power, Presence, and Providence,
his Mercy, Justice, Goodness, Truth; it must needs follow, that it self will
decay in us. Our patience will be enfeebled, when as we presume that we are
safe from all trialls and tentations, or securely resting on our own strength,
as sufficient to overcome them, we have neglected to gather Arguments of
comfort and consolation against the day of affliction. Finally, our prayers
will grow cold and formal, vnchearfull and heartlesse, when by our security
we are made insensible of our wants, and are in no fear of approaching evils.

. 3 That Gods Spirit will not dwell in a secure heart.
And as this security depriueth us of all saving grace: so also of the good
Spirit of God, which is the author and fountain of them. For 1. These. 5. 19.
it causes us, through sloth and negligence to quench the good motions of the
Spirit, either persuading us to the preformance of good duties, or to shun
and avoid vice and sin, whilst we neglect to put in practice, the things
unto which it moves us: And so vexing Ephesians. 4. 30.
and grieuing this holy guest, we make him weary of his lodging, and willing
to depart from us. For, as security makes way for the evil spirit to enter
into our hearts, when as it sweepeth it clean of all virtue, and garnisheth it
with vice and sinful corruptions: so it makes the good Spirit to remove and
depart, being in all things most opposite unto it. And as the fire is
extinguished when as we do not blow and cherish it, or if we stop the vent so
as it cannot flame out, and smother it in its own smoke; so we do extinguish
the fire of Gods Spirit, when through security we neglect to use the means
whereby it is nourished, or will not let it blaze and flame out in the actions
of holiness and righteousness.

. 4 That Carnal security depriueth us of eternal happiness.
Neither does it only deprive us of grace in this life, but also of glory and
happiness in the life to come. For this crown and garland 1. Cor. 9. 23, 24.
Apoc. 2. 10. and 3. 21.
of everlasting blessedness, is not promised to slothful loyterers, but unto
them that strive for it, to wrastlers that contend for masterie, to runners
that run in the Spiritual race, that hold out to the end, to those that
fight in the Christian warfare, and never give over the field till they have
obtained victory. This gate of life is not opened to those that slothfully sit
still, and securely content themselves with their present state, not caring
whether they go in or no; but unto those that strive Matthew. 7. 13. and 11. 12.
to enter into it, and use a kind of holy violence, that they may press in,
and not be in danger of being put back. Salvation belongs not to those, who
are careless and secure in the use of the means whereby it may be had, but
to such as work it out with fear and trembling. These marriage joys are not
prepared for such foolish Phil. 2. 12.
virgins as sleep in security, and take no care to be found in readiness;
but for the wise, who not knowing when the Bridegroom Matthew. 25. 10.
will come, do stand upon their watch, and have their lamps of Faith clearly
burning, and giving out the light of a godly life. And therefore Nemo duri
cordis salutem vnquam adeptus est, etc. Bernard. ad Eugen. lib. 1. Ezech. 11.
29. and 36. 26.
(as one says) there was never any of an hard and secure heart that obtained
salvation, unless God having mercy upon him, has taken away his stony heart
from him, and given him an heart of flesh, as the Prophet speaks.

. 5 That Carnal security exposes us to positive evils, and first to all
dangers.
And thus we see that Carnal security depriueth us of all good in this life
and the life to come. But besides this privation of good, it does also expose
us positiuely to all evil. As first, it makes us subject to all dangers, and
that in diverse respects. First, meritoriously and deservedly it being just with
God, that they should not be shaded under the wings of his providence, who
have no awful respect of his presence, but are careless and unconscionable in
all their ways. Secondly, because they are improuident and negligent in the
using of any means, whereby they may be prevented, either prayer unto God for
his protection, or repentance for sin, which has endangered them to Gods
Judgments, or Christian prudence, in fore-casting what evils may befall them,
or if they happen, how they may prevent them. In which regard, it is no more
strange for secure men to fall into mischief, then to see a man, who having
blind-folded himself, and runs he cares not whither with headlong haste,
or that walks in his sleep, to stumble at blocks in his way, or to fall into
Pits and Ditches. Thirdly, because they always lie open unto their spiritual
enemies, and encourage them with their secure carelessness to set upon them,
because before the assault they are sure of victory. Fourthly, because giving
themselves to sloth and ease, they neglect to buckle the Christian Armor upon
them, whereby they might be enabled to resist their enemies in the day of
conflict. And lastly, because they who through security are destitute of the
fear of God, endanger themselves to all things else which are to be feared;
and howsoever they are void of all fear in the time of prosperity; yet when
the things they never feared fall upon them, they are so amazed and astonished
with approaching dangers, and so deprived of all courage to resist, or counsel
to avoid them; that they do through excessive fear ineuitably Nunquam secura
debet esse foelicitas, quia periculosiora sunt animo secura, quam corpori
aduersa etc. Aug. in Sent. T. 3. c. 1059. Qui praesumit minus veretur, minus
praecauet, plus periclitatur, etc. Tertul. de cultu Foemin. page 407.
fall into many of them, which they might have escaped, if they had feared
seasonably, and prouidently foreseen them before they happened. In which
respect, one says, that our prosperity ought never to be secure; because
security is more dangerous to our mind, then adversity to our body. For
things prosperous do first corrupt us, before those which are adverse, can
break and hurt us. And another Father gives the reason of this danger,
Because he that securely presumes fears not, and so is less cautelous and
provident, and thereby more apt to fall into danger. Fear is the foundation of
health and safety; and presumption the impediment of fear. And therefore it
is more profitable if we fear that we may fall, for by fearing we shall take
heed, and taking heed we shall escape.

. 6 That carnal security exposes us to Gods fearful Judgments.
Secondly, this carnal security brings upon us Gods fearful Judgments,
as appears by many testimonies of Scriptures, wherein Deuteronomy. 19. 19, 20, 21.
they are denounced, and many examples of secure sinners, upon whom they have
been inflicted. So the Lord threatens, that if any hearing the words of the
Curse recorded in the Book of the Law, do bless himself in his heart,
saying, I shall have peace though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to
add drunkenness unto thirst; he will not spare him, but then his anger and
jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in
that Book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under
Heaven; and the Lord shall separate him unto evil. Thus, because the Rulers of
Jerusalem said, We Esa. 28. 15, 18.
have made a covenant with Death, and with Hell are we at agreement, when the
ouerflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we
have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid our selves;
therefore the Lord threatens, that their covenant with Death shall be
disanulled, and their agreement with Hell shall not stand, and that when the
ouerflowing scourge shall pass through, they should be trodden down by it. So
because the residue of Israel, living in great iniquity, blood and
perverseness, said in their security; The Lord has forsaken Ezech. 9. 9, 10.
the Earth and sees not; the Lord threatens that his eye should not spare
them, and that he would have no pity, but would recompense their way upon
their head. Thus the more careless and secure the Jews were in examining
their wicked works and ways, saying in their hearts; The Lord will do neither
good nor evil, the more curiously Zeph. 1. 12, 13.
he threatens to search them out, and to punish them with greater severity;
the which he implies by that borrowed speech, that he would search Jerusalem
with Candles, and punish the men that were settled on their lees, making their
goods to become a booty, and their houses a desolation. So, because Babylon
lived in her sins with great security, and promised unto her self
impunitie, and the continuance of her prosperity, the Lord denounces those
judgments against her, Esa. 47. 8.
from which specially she blessed her self, even loss of Sovereignty,
slaughter and desolation: the which is also threatened against the Antitype the
Romish Babylon, and in Gods good time shall be inflicted. Apoc. 18. 7, 8.
And thus do secure sinners who through hardness of their heart cannot
repent, treasure up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath, and Romans 2.
5, 6.
the revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render unto every
man according to his deeds.

. 7 The former point illustrated by examples.
This also is clear and evident by the examples of former times; for thus the
old World, and Sodom and Gomorrah, living securely in Luke 17. 25, 28.
their sins without repentance, eating and drinking, buying and selling,
building and planting, marrying and giving in marriage; were destroyed with
Gods fearful Judgments of Fire and Water. So the Jews, when they securely
blessed themselves in their prosperity, and drowned the voice of the Lords
Heralds, denouncing war, with Ier. 6. 142
their louder cry of peace, peace, were vanquished by their enemies, and led
into a miserable captivity. Thus Belshazzar was attached in Dan. 5.
the midst of his cups, and being in his chief pollity, feasting his Princes
and Concubines, and far off from all danger, his ruin is written by a finger
upon the Wall, and soon after executed and accomplished. And as this has
been the condition of secure men in time past; so is it now, and shall be to
the end of the World, and even at the end of it; For when they shall say peace
and safety, then sudden destruction shall come upon them, as travail upon a
Woman with 1. These. 5. 3.
child, and they shall not escape, as the Apostle tells us. In which regard
the estate of secure men, flourishing in prosperity, is like the state of the
fatted Ox that is led to slaughter, who is as secure and far from fear, as he
was in fore-times, when he was led to the pasture; or of the silly Bird, which
feeds securely on the bait, when the Net is ready to be pulled upon her; or
of the Drunkard, of which the wise Man speaks, who sleeps securely in the
midst of the Sea, or as he lies upon the top of the Mast, ready to be
blown over Hatches Pro. 23. 34.
in every Tempest.

. 8 That carnal security plungeth men into everlasting condemnation.
But most fearful is the estate of secure men, in respect of that fearful
condemnation, which they plunge themselves into, in the World to come. When as
they shall not only be deprived of heavenly joys, but be also for ever
tormented with hellish torments. As we see in the example of the retchlesse and
secure servant, whose Lord came in a day when he looked not for him, and in an
hour that he was not aware of, and not only deprived him of the reward given
to the faithful servant, whom he found well employed, but also cut him off,
and appointed Matt. 24. 50, 51.
him his portion with hypocrites, where shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth. Neither shall they be subject only to ordinary punishments and
tortures in this hellish condemnation (though the least in this kind be
fearful and intolerable) but as they have more securely wallowed themselves in
carnal and worldly pleasures, presuming that they should always last, the
more exquisitely shall they be tormented; as we see by that fearful sentence
pronounced against the Whore of Babylon, the Antichrist of Rome. How much she
has glorifieth her Apoc. 18. 7.
self and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: For she
says in her heart, I sit a Queen and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
For if the Lord observes such a just proportion in executing judgment,
according to the Law of requital in this life: How much more Lex tallonis.
may she, and all other of her condition, expect it in the last judgment,
when there shall be no further day of vengeance taken, but every sinner shall
be punished to the full, according to the quality and quantity of his sins?

. 9 That carnal security is a fearful punishment of other sins.
Finally, as this carnal security is in it self sinful, the cause of sin
and the cause of punishment: so (that we may know that there is no relation or
respect of evil wanting in it) it self also is a fearful punishment of other
sins. For when we not only put out the small sparks of the light of nature
remaining in us, and put to silence our own consciences, accusing us for
sin; but also strive against Gods Spirit, and quench the good motions
thereof, either moving us to good or restrayning us from evil; then it is just
with God to give us up unto our Genesis 6. 3.
own lusts, seeing we will needs serve them, and not let his spirit always
strive with us; to blind our minds and understandings (not by putting out our
eyes, but) by withholding the light of his holy Spirit, whereby alone they are
illuminated; to harden our hearts (not by infusion of corruption) but leaving
them to their own natural hardness, and denying to give the Oil of his
grace, whereby they might be softened, and to cause the many wounds which we
have given unto our consciences, to take away the sense and feeling of it, and
so turn unto a deadly Gangrene or incurable Canker. So Augustine says, that
Iustissima poena vt qui sciens rectum non facit, ami^^at scire quod rectum. De
lib. Arbit. lib. 3.
it is a just punishment from God, that he who knows to do well and does it
not, should also be deprived of the knowledge of well-doing. Thus when the
Gentiles sinned in the highest kind against their consciences, and knowing the
true God by the light of nature, and by reading in the great Book of the
Creatures, did not worship him as God, but fell into grievous Idolatry, and
committed spiritual Whoredom with all the Creatures; the Lord (as the Apostle
says) that they might receive ((...)) that recompense Romans 1. 27.
of reward which was due unto their wilful error, gave them over to their
own vain imaginations, to become Fools, to the unclean lusts of their own
hearts and vile affections, and to a reprobate mind, to commit sin with
greediness, and without any sense or feeling. So when the Jews would take no
warning neither by Gods Words nor Works, but wearied his Prophets with speaking
unto them, and himself with smiting and correcting them; so that he excuses
his neglect of fatherly chastisements, because he found them unprofitable and
bootlesse: Wherefore should you be stricken any more; seeing ye will revolt
Esa. 1. 5.
more and more. At last, as a reward and just punishment of their impenitency,
he gives them up to their blindness of mind, carnal security and hardness
of heart. Go, and tell this people; hear ye indeed, Esa. 6. 9, 10.
but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of
this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see
with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart,
and convert and be healed. Thus when they lived in injustice and Zach. 1. 10,
11, 12.
oppression, and would show no mercy, nor harken to Gods Prophets calling them
to repentance, their hearts also became as hard as the Adamant stone. And thus
the Lord threatens, that he will bring distress Zeph. 1. 17.
upon them, and make them to walk like blind men, without light of comfort, or
sight of understanding, because they had sinned against him. And this of all
other punishments, inflicted in this life, is most grievous and fearful, and
therefore with greatest care to be avoided. For other punishments, being
sanctified by Gods Spirit to our use, do open our eyes, but this shuts and
makes them stark blind; others make us to flee unto God, and draw near unto
him for ease and comfort, but this makes us to flee further from him, as
though we needed not his help. Others bruise our hearts and make them
contrite, causing them of stone to become flesh; but this does more and more
harden them (as frost does the water which it conuerteth into Ice) and of flesh
makes them to become stone. Other afflictions do help to cure our spiritual
sores, and to draw out the Core of our corruptions, but this makes them to rot
and fester, by neglecting those wholesome salues, whereby they should be healed.
Others refine us, like good metal, in the fiery furnace, and like Files do
scowre away our rust, but this makes us to rust the more, and covers us over
with filth and dross. Others make us cry out unto God by prayer, and more
diligent in his Esa. 26. 16.
service, this shuts our mouths that we cannot, and hardneth our hearts
that we will not call upon him, and makes us to neglect all good duties.
Others correct us and make us better, this corrupts and Heb. 8. 12. Apoc. 3.
19. 2. Tim. 2. 12. and 3. 12. Act. 14. 22.
makes us worse. Finally, they are the way to Gods Kingdom, for we must suffer
with Christ before we can reign in him; yea, they help us forward in the way
of Righteousness, that leads unto Happiness, and so, as the Apostle says,
cause unto us a far most excellent and eternal 2. Cor. 4. 17.
weight of glory; but this punishment of carnal security and hardness of
heart, does make us utterly to neglect this way, and thrusts us into the
broad way that leads to destruction.

CHAP. X.
Of the means whereby we may be preserved from carnal security. As first
avoiding and taking away the causes of it.

. 1 The first remedy, is to avoid ignorance, and labor after knowledge.
BY that which has been said in the former Chapter, it may manifestly
appear, that the sin of carnal security is out of measure sinful, a
capital evil, and most dangerous disease of the soul, which is more heartily
to be abhorred, and more carefully to be avoided, then the plague, leprosy, or
corporal lethargy. But, for as much as it is not sufficient that we see the
manifold mischiefs of this Spiritual sickness, and thereby be moved to hate
it, and earnestly to desire to be freed from it; unless we also know by what
means our desire may be satisfied: I will in the next place propound the
preservatives, which may keep us from this disease, and the medicines which
may cure and recover us if we be already fallen into it. First, then if we
would be cured of this Spiritual lethargy, we must imitate skillful
Physicians, who to effect a perfect cure, do labor chiefly to take away the
causes of the sickness, and withal to strengthen and confirm the affected
part, that being expulsed they may be able to keep them from re-entring. Which
not being observed, there can be no perfect cure, but the Patient will be
ready, upon the next distemper of heat, cold, or misdiet, to relapse
dangerously into his former disease. And if we Ibi maxim oportet obseruare
peccatum vbi nasci solet. Hieronym.
would take away these malignant and poisonous streams of carnal security,
it will be to little purpose to lade and empty them in the current, unless we
damme and stop up the Wellhead and Fountain from which the Spring. To which
end, we will propound them in the same order wherein they were formerly
handled. And first, if we would be freed from carnal security, we must
labor to come out of our natural ignorance, and to have our minds illightned
with the knowledge of God, and of those attributes, whereby his true fear is
wrought in our hearts, as his omnipotent power, omniscient wisdom,
omnipresence, justice, truth, mercy, goodness, and the rest. For there are
scarce any that are ignorant of these, who are not wholly possessed with
carnal security; neither does it make them watchful and fearful to be
compassed about with desperate dangers, because living in the blindness of
ignorance, and in such palpable darkness as obscureth all things, they want
both light and sight to see and apprehend them.

. 2 The second remedy, is to consider and meditate often on Gods attributes.
The second means and remedy against security, is not only to know God and
his attributes, but also often to meditate and consider of them. As still to
think and remember, that he who sees all things, sees and beholds our
most secret actions, yea, searches our very hearts and reins, discerning
every turning and winding in this Labyrinth, much better then we our selves. So
Solomon, The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the
good. Proverb. 15. 3. And Job, I know that thou can do every thing, and that
no thought can be withheld from thee. Job 42. 2. And therefore David sets
God continually before him. I have (says he) set the Lord always before me,
because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Psalm. 16. 8. and Psalm.
119. 168. Yea, Deus totus est sen^us, totus vi^us, totus ^udi^us Pl^^ hist.
(...). l. ^. c. 7.
that he looks not thus upon us afar off, he being in heaven and we on
earth, but being in all Sphae^^* cuius ^en^^um vbique. circ^mf^rentia ^u^quam.
Emp^^ocles. Psalm. 1^9. 8* 9.
places alike, is present with us, and stands by to see how in all things we
carry our selves; and not as an idle speculatour, only to gaze on our actions
with either liking or dislike of them, but as our Magna tibi custod^a
necessaria est qui ante ocules ^udicis v^uis cuncta cernentis. Bernard. m^d^t.
c. 6.
Judge, who will either acquit and reward us if we do well, or condemn and
punish us if we do evil. And not such a corrupt Judge who may be blinded with
rewards, and takes more care to weigh the bribe then the cause, or a respecter
of persons, who may easily be misled by favor or friendship; or one so weak
in authority, or confined in his jurisdiction to such narrow limits, or of
such small power and strength, that we may appeal from his sentence to an
higher Court, flee out of his dominions, or by our own wisdom and strength,
or help of our friends, deliver our selves from his just doom, by main
force. But let us remember, that the Judge who stands by and looks upon our
actions, is most upright and impartial, who accepts no man's person, and so
all-sufficient in himself that he needs no rewards, and supreme Lord of
all, so that we cannot give him any thing which is not his own already. That
his dominion lasts unto all ages, and extends unto all creatures, and his
presence fills all places, so that, If we could ascend into heaven, he is
there; if we should 2. Cor. 5. 10.
make our heds in hell, he is there; if we should take the wings of the
morning, to flee from his presence, and dwell in the utmost parts of the sea,
even there the hand of his power and providence would find us out. that his
sentence and decrees are much more firm and irreuocable then those of the
Medes and Persians, and his truth so inviolable and unchangeable, that what he
has spoken cannot be disanulled, but shall surely be accomplished. That he is
so omnipotent in power, that all the creatures in heaven and earth cannot
resist his will. That he is a God that hates iniquity, and is a consuming
fire to burn up impenitent Heb. 12. 31.
sinners as stubble, in which regard it is a fearful things to fall into the
hands of this just, true, powerful, and everliving God. Finally, let us
consider, that he who looks upon us, and stands by us, is infinitely good
and gracious, our dear Father in Jesus Christ, who has bestowed on us all the
benefits which we enjoy in present possession and future hope; and therefore,
that it is great impiety and foul shame, to abuse such infinite mercy and
inestimable benefits, by neglecting his eye and presence, and sleeping through
carnal security quietly in our sins, without any desire to come out of them
by unfeigned repentance. And if thus considering and meditating on Gods nature
and attributes, we set him continually before our eyes, and ourselves and all
our actions in his presence, it is not possible that there should be any place
to lodge security in our hearts. For if the eye of the loving and wise Father,
of the just Judge and sovereign King, do make Children and Subjects to shake
off security, and to carry themselves in their presence with awful
reverence, and with a desire to approve their words and works unto them; how
much more shall we thus do, if we continually set God before us, the King of
Kings, the supreme Judge of men and Angels, and our most gracious Father in
Jesus Christ?

. 3 The third means is, to cast off all self-confidence.
The third means is to cast of all selfe-confidence, and opinion of our own
wisdom and strength, as being altogether insufficient to preserve us from the
least dangers. Which that we may do, let us consider, that we are never
nearer falling, then when we rest upon the broken staff of our own strength;
and never further from it, then when utterly despayring of all our own
abilities, we cast these brittle reeds out of our hands, which do but trouble
us and hinder our hold, and rely our selves upon the Lord, the sure and never
failing pillar of our strength. And this we see in the example of David, who
Psalm. 30. 6, 7.
in the strength of his prosperity growing confident, that he could not be
moved, was presently troubled and foiled: But when finding Psalm. 94. 18.
his foot to slip, he despaired of standing in his own strength, then the
mercy of the Lord did hold him up. But especially, let us wholly deny and
reject our own worth and merits, the opinion our good natures, good meanings,
and intentions; yea, of the strength of our spiritual graces, as though they
were sufficient to deserve Gods protection, or to uphold and defend us against
all perils. For this makes us much the less to respect God and reverence his
holy Majesty, and to sleep more deadly in our carnal security, when we
lodge in the castle of our own strength and abilities, and have the keys of
our safety and protection in our own keeping. Whereas if we see and
acknowledge our own insufficiency, our want of wisdom and power to keep us
from any danger, and defend us against tentations; our frailety to fall into
sin, and inabilitie to any good actions; our pronenesse to fall into perils,
and want of power to recover out of them; our unworthiness of Gods least
favor, and worthiness of his greatest Judgments: this would make us to shake
off all security, and to work out our salvation with fear and trembling, as
the Apostle exhorts; Phil. 2. 12, 13.
because of our selves, we are able to do nothing, but it is Phil. 3. 12, 13,
14.
God only which works in us both to will and to do, of his good pleasure.
This would keep us from being secure, as though we were possessed of all we
desire, and were already perfect; and make us with the Apostle, to forget
those things which are behind, and to reach forth unto those Heb. 4. 1.
things which are before, and with all our care and endeavor, to press toward
the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus; lest,
having the promise of the garland of blessedness, through our sloth and
security, we come short of it, as the Apostle speaks.

. 4 That it is a notable means to weaken self-confidence, if we consider the
strength of our spiritual enemies.
But much more effectual would it be for the shaking off this carnal
security, if we would weaken our selfe-confidence by our often consideration
not only of our frailetie and weakness, which make us prone to fall in the
least trials and tentations, but also of our many and mighty, politic and
most malicious enemies, who incessantly assault us, and will easily get the
victory, if the Lord, for a just punishment of our selfe-confidence, leave us
to our selves; or if we securely neglect to stand upon our guard, to fight
against that in the power of Gods might, and to keep the Christian armor
still, buckled unto us. For we can be no more ready to give them advantage,
then they to take it, and to make the most spiteful use of it for our
overthrow; we can be no more feeble to stand, then they strong and malicious to
cast us down, and to tread us under foot when they have gotten us at their
cruel mercy. Yea, let us consider this humane frailetie not only in our
selves, and the strength and malice of our enemies in their assaults against
us; but in those who have gone before us, who have far exceeded us in grace
and spiritual strength, and yet have been fearfully foiled, by giving them
advantage through their security, as of Noah, Lot, David, Peter, and many
others. And so may we easily conclude, that we, who are weak and fresh water
Soldiers, have little reason to be secure, when the Lords greatest Worthies
have through the might and malice of their enemies, and their own
heedlessenesse received such foiles; and that we poor shrubs may easily be
trodden under the feet of these Wolves and Lions; when such tall Cedars could
not stand before them. Whereby we shall not only be made more wary and
watchful over our footing by the example of their slips; but also distrusting
in our own strength, we shall rest with full affiance upon Gods gracious power
and promises, who is alone sufficient to preserve us in these dangers. Finally,
add to the power and malice, the diligence and watchfulness of our spiritual
enemies; for Satan (as he confesses) exercises himself in compassing the
earth to and fro, that he may spy out his Job 1. 7.
best opportunities to do us mischief. And the Apostle persuades us to
sobriety and watchfulness by this argument, because our adversary 1. Pet. 5.
8.
the Devil goes about continually like a roaring Lion seeing whom he may
devour. And therefore if this great Fowler still watches to catch us in the
nets of destruction, much more should we watch for our preservation, that we
may escape them; if he lays snares and grinnes to entrappe us in every
place, at home and abroad, in our beds, and at our tables, in our recreations,
and the labors of our callings, yea in our most holy exercises, hearing,
reading, praying, what place is there for security, if we have any desire to
escape them, and to be kept from falling into ruin? If this great thief watch
to break Math. 24. 43.
in into the houses of our hearts, and to rob us of the treasures of spiritual
grace and lead us captive unto sin: O why should we give place to security
in the midst of these desperate dangers, and not rather stand upon our watch,
that we may prevent them? yea, seeing we are apt to slumber and sleep, why
should we trust to our own watchfulness, and not rather put our whole
affiance in the great Watchman of Israel, desiring him continually to watch
over us, and when we are ready to slumber in security, to awaken us out of it
by his Word and Spirit, lest we sleep the sleep of death, and become a prey
to our spiritual enemies.

. 5 The third remedy, is to use well our prosperity.
The fourth means is, that we abuse not our prosperity to the nourishing of
our security, nor suffer our selves to be abused by it; but if God send it,
that we make such holy and right use of it, as that it may increase in us the
true fear of God, and make us more diligent and spiritually watchful unto all
religious and honest duties. And to this end let us not suffer our judgments
to be blinded with a false conceit, that it is an infallible sign of Gods
love, and that therefore because we enjoy it, we are highly in his favor, and
consequently out of the gunshot of any either present or future danger, so as
we may be secure and sear nothing. For these worldly things are but of an
indifferent nature in respect of their use; good or evil, as they are well or
ill used, and no sure testimonies of Gods love, seeing these outward things
happen alike to all, as the Wiseman speaks Yea, in regard Ecele. 9. 1, 2.
that (by reason of our corruption) they are seldom well used, but
contrariwise abused to sin, forgetfulness of God, pride, ambition,
covetousness, and many other vices, therefore the Lord ordinarily bestows
them in greatest abundance upon wicked men, as Turks, Infidels, and carnal
Christians, that surfeiting of their plenty (as the Psalmist speaks) their
Table may become a snare; and gives them to his best and dearest children with
a sparing hand; or if liberally, yet he seasoneth and tempereth them with many
crosses and afflictions, that their hearts may not be too much set upon them.
Which being rightly considered, our prosperity will not nourish security, but
rather fear, lest we should be in the greatest and worst number. Secondly, let
not our hearts trust in these earthly things, wisdom, strength, riches,
friends, or any other thing, wherein men place their worldly happiness, and so
be secure, as though they could free us from all danger; for these earthly
things are weak and vain, unable to help us in time of trouble, and
momentany and mutable, ready to forsake and leave us when we most rely upon
them, or though they could do us some pleasure, in being means of our freedom
from small perils; yet they will nothing profit us, if we live securely in our
sins for the appeasing of Gods wrath, or satisfying his justice; they will
do us no good when we shall most need it, namely at the day of death, or the
day of Judgment. Lastly, let us consider that these worldly benefits are not
absolutely bestowed on us, to do with them what we list, but are the Lords
Talents, entrusted unto us, as his Stewards, to be employed for our Masters
advantage, and good of our Fellow-seruants. So that the more we have received,
the more we are indebted, and the greater account we have to make at the day
of Judgment, and to sustain the greater condemnation if we have wasted our
Masters goods, and so come short in our reckonings. In which respect our great
prosperity should not nourish in us pride and security, but rather humility
and fear, care and watchfulness, that we may so take the present comforts of
these worldly blessings, as that they may not hinder but rather further us, to
the everlasting fruition of heavenly happiness.

. 6 The fifth remedy is to shun customable sinning.
The fifth means to avoid carnal security, is to shun customable sin,
and howsoever through infirmity we sometime flippe into it, yet let us take
heed we do not choose it for our common way, and by much use and often acting
of it, make it as familiar as if it were our ordinary Trade and Occupation.
For custom of sinning does take Omne peccatum vile est consuetudine, and fit
homini quasi nullum. Aug. in aduent. Dom. ser. 4. c. 10.
away all sense of sin, and whereas at the first it seemed notorious and
heinous, and therefore affrighted the conscience with guilt and horror, after
that men have often committed it, it seems little or nothing, and therefore
they continue in it without fear. So those that are often flesht in blould and
cruelty, make no more account of killing a man, then of killing a beast: those
that inure their tongues to oaths and blasphemies, vent them as securely and
without fear, as yea and nay; they that have often stolen their neighbors
goods, could as securely continue their theft, as other men their Trades and
Occupations, were they not endangered hereby to humane laws. And in a word,
sinners of all kinds, by much custom in sinning, do make this deadly Serpent
so tame, that they dare without fear put it into their bosoms. And by
iniuring themselves to drink of this mortal poison by degrees, they make it
so familiar to their stomachs, that they are not sensible of any hurt it does
them. Yea, by much acquaintance, sin (which at first terrified the conscience
like an enemy) becomes their play-fellow, and they account it but a
recreation of their youth, and even a sport to do evil; herein like through
their impiety, unto little children in their simplicity, who securely play at
the Cockatrice hole, as the Prophet speaks to another purpose. Esa. 11. 8.
In which regard, let us carefully take heed, that we be not hardened Heb. 3.
13.
with the deceitfulness of sin: which, though it be a malicious enemy, by
much conuersing with us, will so insinuate, that we shall securely entertain
it as a welcome Guest. Let us in respect of our great frailty, take occasion
by our former falls to become more careful and fearful, that we do not fall
again, avoiding all means of sin which draw and entice us to it; or if we
be overtaken, let us not lie in it still, lest we fall into this sleep of
security, but let us rise out of it presently by renewed repentance. And as
soon as we feel our self stung with this poisonous Viper, let us without
delay apply the antidotes and remedies which are fit to cure the wound, for
else this poison will disperse it into all the parts of our heart and soul,
and so bring us into this deadly sleep of carnal security, in which we shall
perish without sense or feeling.

. 7 The sixth remedy is to make precious account of Gods grace and forbearance.
The sixth means is, that we make precious account of Gods grace and
forbearance, his patience and long suffering, and labor to have our hearts so
affected with them, as that they may be wrought to Gods love and fear,
whereby we shall be made careful and watchful, that we do not displease this
gracious and good God, who so loves us, and whom we so love; or if through
frailty we have incurred his displeasure, that we do with unwearied
diligence seek his face and favor by renewing our repentance. For we may be
assured that we shall not lose our labor, seeing he is so patient and slow to
wrath, that he will receive us to grace if we turn unto him. And contrariwise,
let us take heed of abusing this patience and long-suffering of God, by taking
occasion and encouragement thereby to continue impenitently in our sins;
seeing hereby we shall become so secure and hardhearted in our sinful
courses, that whereas before we refused or Romans 2. 4, 5.
delayed to repent, now repentance will refuse us, so as either it will never
come into our thoughts, or else not be able to pierce into our hearts, they
will be so hardened through Gods righteous Judgment for our gross abuse of his
grace and goodness.

. 8 The seventh remedy is to shun presumption.
The seventh means is, carefully to take heed that we do not presumptuously
abuse Gods mercies, as an occasion and encouragement Psalm. 130. 4.
unto sin, but contrariwise, fear and reverence him the more, by how much we
find him more loving and gracious, according to that of the Psalmist; There is
forgiveness with thee, that thou may be feared. For there is nothing more
that does beget and nourish this carnal security (as the miserable experience
of former Ages and our own times does lamentably prove) then this conceit,
that God is so merciful, that he will pardon all our sins, whenever we
turn from them by repentance, although it be even at the hour of our death.
And consequently, nothing would more weaken and cause it to languish, then if
we pluck this weapon from it, and turn the edge and point of it against it
self; taking occasion thereby the more to love God who is so gracious, and out
of this love the more to fear his displeasure. To which end let us always
consider that the Lord is no less infinite in justice then in mercy, and that
he is as ready to glorify himself in manifesting the one by punishing of
presumptuous and impenitent sinners, as the other in sparing and forgiving
those that turn unto him by unfeigned repentance. That those whom he cannot
allure and draw unto him with the hand of his mercy, he will thrust from him
with the hand of his justice; and that the greater mercy he has showed to
move us to repentance, the more fearful judgments will he inflict upon us
if we neglect it through our carnal security; and because we have not only
wilfully wounded our souls with sin, but also have despited our heavenly
Chyrurgeon by casting away the plasters which he has applied for our cure,
he will let us rot in our corruptions, laugh at our destruction, and mock
when Apoc. 22. 11. Pro. 1. 24, 26.
our fear comes.

. 9 The eighth remedy is to use carefully the means of salvation.
The eighth means is, that we diligently use the means of salvation, seeing
they are also the means of implanting the fear of God Ier. 3. 4.
in our hearts, and so remoouing and rooting out of this carnal security. As
first the careful and conscionable hearing of the Word, which is that Plow and
Harrow that breaks up the fallow grounds of our hearts, and that bruiseth and
makes them contrite, so as they are fit to receive the seeds of all spiritual
graces; that Hammer which breaks these rocks in pieces, and that Fire which
melts and dissolueth those metals that cannot be broken, as Jeremy
speaks: and Ier. 23. 29.
finally that Sword of the Spirit which gives a deadly wound to carnal
security, whilst it lays open the heinousness of sin, the wrath of God,
and curse of the law due unto it, the rewards promised unto those who fear the
Lord, and the punishments denounced against those who live in their security,
both in this life and the life to come. Neither is it possible that we should
long sleep in carnal security, if we leave our ears open to receive the
voice of these sons of thunder speaking unto us. Especially, let us withal
diligence hearken unto those admonitions and exhortations which are purposely
used by the holy Ghost, to rouse us up out of this sleep of security. As that
admonition of our Savior. Watch therefore, for ye know not Matthew. 24. 42.
what hour your Lord does come. And again, Take ye heed, watch and Mar. 13.
33.
pray, for ye know not when the time is. Let your loins be girded about, Luke
12. 35, 36.
and your lights burning; and ye your selves like unto them that wait for
their Lord, when he shall return from the wedding, that when he comes and
knocks, ye may open unto him immediately. Blessed are those Servants, whom
the Lord when he comes shall find watching. So let us hearken unto, and with
all care meditate upon those admonitions and exhortations of the Apostles.
Awake thou that sleep, and stand up Ephesians. 5. 14.
from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. It is now high time to awake
from sleep, for now is our salvation nearer then when we believed. The night
is far spent, and the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of
darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. Let us not Romans 13. 11, 12.
1 Thessalonians. 5. 6. 1. Cor. 10. 12. Phil. 2. 12.
sleep as do others, but let watch and be sober. He that thinks he
stands, let him take heed lest he fall. Work out your salvation with fear
and trembling. Take heed lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
unbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily,
whilst it is called to day, lest any of you be hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin. Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the
Devil, as Heb. 3. 12, 13.
a roaring Lion, walks about seeking whom he may devour. So also meditating
in Gods law, which in it self is sufficient to cause our hearts 2. Kings 22.
10.
to melt, like the heart of Josias, with true compunction and contrition, so as
the frozen dregs of security can have no harbor; and in the Gospel, which
will implant in them the fear of God arising out of faith and love. To this
purpose serves also the often receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,
whilst laboring to come prepared, that we may receive it to life and
salvation, and not to judgment and condemnation, it gives us occasion to
examine our estate, and to call our selves to a strict account before Gods
Tribunal, and to renew our covenant with him by renewing the condition of
faith and repentance. And finally, holy conferences whereby we stir up Gods
graces in one another, keep and uphold them from falling, and raise them up
being fallen, exuscitate and re-enliue the gifts of Gods Spirit, which are
ready to be cooled and quenched; and by mutual exhortations preserve one
another, that we be not hardened Heb. 3. 13.
through the deceitfulness of sin.

. 10 The ninth remedy is, to hear the Word with faith.
The ninth means is, that we receive the Word with faith, without which it
cannot profit us for the shaking off this carnal security. For, as ungracious
Children and Servants proceed in their evil courses, though they hear their
Parents and Governors encouraging them to obedience by many promises, and
indeauouring to terrify them by threatening punishment, if they give no credit
to their word; so unless we believe Gods gracious promises, made to those that
fear him, and his threatenings against those who securely neglect him, his
mercies and judgments; we will neither entertain this fear, nor banish
security out of our hearts. Whereas contrariwise, if we give credit to the
things we hear, namely, that thete is a just God who beholds all our
works, who will call all that we do to judgment, even our unknown actions
and secret thoughts, either to crown them with everlasting rewards, or to
punish them with intolerable and endless torments, it is not possible that we
should be secure. For if no man can live in security who is persuaded, that
being liable to the Law, his neck is daily in danger of the halter, or that a
sword hangs over his head in a weak thread; though these are but temporal
evils, which when they have done their worst, do but hasten that death, with
nature would bring unto us, with a little slower pace; much less could they
be secure, if they thought themselves indeed endangered to hellish torments,
and everlasting death, and condemnation.

. 11 The tenth remedy is, to apply the Word unto ourselves.
The tenth means is, that we do apply unto our selves the Word which we
hear, and not, if we dislike it, shift it off from our selves to others;
saying unto our souls, when we hear reproves, this is my sin which is
reproved, seeing I have either committed it, or having the seeds of it in me,
may bring forth the fruits of it in outward act, if God by his Word and holy
Spirit nippe and restrain them not. This admonition belongs unto me, and I
will take warning and grow wiser, and more watchful by it. This instruction is
mine, for my better direction in avoiding sin, and embracing godliness; and
this judgment threatened will light upon me, if I securely go on in my sins,
and do not prevent it by unfeigned repentance. For, as our meat will not
nourish us, if we give it to be eaten by others, nor our clothes keep us
warm, unless we put them on, nor medicines and salues cure our sicknesses
and sores, unless they be taken and applied; no more will this food and
physic of our souls do us any good, if we put it off unto others, and do
not make it our own by application.

. 12 The eleventh remedy is not to misapplie the promises.
The eleventh means is, that we do not make the Word unprofitable by
misapplying it, as when we arrogate unto our selves the gracious promises of
the Gospel, not performing the condition of faith and repentance; but that we
learn rightly to apply it as our state and condition duly examined and
considered does require. As we must apply unto our selves the threatenings of
the Law, reprehensions and admonitions, when we find that we securely go on in
our sins, and the comforts of the Gospel, when as we find and feel the
weight of our sins, and are truly humbled under the burden of them.
Otherwise the Word will have the same effects that physic and salues have
being misapplied, as cordials to a strong body not well purged from gross
humors, and strong medicines to a weak and feeble Patient; healing plasters
applied to festred sores, which have more need of the lancer and strong
corrasiues, and these to small and green hurts that would be healed with some
gentle salve; that is, it will cast those who are dejected and hopeless into
deep despair, and make the presumptuous and hard-hearted the more retchlesse
and secure.

Finally, it is a special means to be preserved from security, when as
taking no pleasure in being soothed and flattered in all our courses,
especially by our Teachers and Guides, we do affect and submit our selves unto
a faithful Ministry, who will tell us plainly of our sins, and rouse us up
by their exhortations and rebukes, when as we are ready to lie and sleep in
them through carnal security. And this was David's choice, who desired not to
eat of the Wickeds dainties; Psalm. 141. 5.
but (says he) let the righteous smite me, and it shall be a kindness; and
let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my
head. So Solomon: Open rebuke is better then secret love, and the wounds Pro.
25. 5, 6.
of a friend, because they are faithful, are better then the kisses of an
enemy, which are deceitful. For, we are naturally blinded with self-love,
which hides and extenuateth our sins, and causes us to continue in them
without fear, making us believe that all is well: but a faithful Minister
will put off these fig-leaues, and pulling off the mask of vain pretenses and
excuses, will lay them naked before us, so as we may see their ugly deformity.
And when we are ready to sleep in them through carnal security, they being
our spiritual Watchmen appointed by God to watch over our souls, will awaken
us out of our slumber, by sounding in our ears the threatenings of the Law
against the impenitent and secure, and the promises of the Gospel to those who
acknowledging their sins, do rise out of them, and forsake them by unfeigned
repentance.

CHAP. XI.
Wherein are set down diverse other remedies whereby we may be preserved from
carnal security.

. 1 The first remedy is, to withstand security in the first degrees of it.
BEsides those means of preserving and delivering us from carnal security by
remoouing the causes of it, of which I have entreated in the former Chapter;
there are diverse others remaining, which are now to be spoken of. And first, if
we would avoid security and hardness of heart in the highest degrees, we must
shun the first beginnings of it, and carefully foresee and fear it long
before it comes. For then we may prevent it, by using those good means, which
are fit for this purpose, of which I have spoken in part, and shall more fully
handle them in the following discourse. But if it have once seized upon us,
then it will be too late, by any thing that our selves can do to come out of
it, because it takes away all spiritual sense and feeling, so as we shall
have neither will nor power to use any means to be freed from it. We must
with all care and providence shun this Viper, that it may not come near us, or
presently apply remedies as soon as we are stung, seeing it will be too late
when as the poison has ouer-spread our souls, and has made us to be
altogether stupid and senseless. It is the sleep of the soul, and therefore
it will be too late to come out of it, when we are fallen deeply into it,
seeing it depriueth us of the use of our spiritual senses, so as we know not
our estate, but rather dream that we are waking, and exercised in such duties
as God requires; but as soon as we feel it approaching by our stretching and
yawning, when we are about good duties, our coldness and dulnes, our slacknes
and negligence in holy exercises, which we have formerly performed with
pleasure and cheerfulnes; or when we are falling into a slumber, and (as it
were) nod in our sincerity and zeal, so as we have some sense of our estate,
and are so much waking, as that we know that we are ready to sleep; so as we
may say with the Spouse in the Canticles; I sleep, but my heart waketh; and
are Cant. 5. 2.
able to hear the voice of our Bridegroom, Christ calling unto us in his
Ordinances, Open unto me my Sister, my Love, my Dove, then let us not give way
to sloth, but presently start up and shake off this drowsinesse, and use all
good means that we be not ouer-taken of it. Yea, it is the Lethargy of the
soul, and therefore must be prevented before it approaches; for after it has
seized upon us, it takes away all sense and feeling, and so benummeth and
deaddeth all the spiritual faculties, that the party is not only unable and
unwilling to help himself, but is also scarce recouerable by all means that
can be used by the most skillful Physicians. In which regard the faithful do
fear this disease of carnal security more, then any outward afflictions;
yea, then any other sickness of sin, because it is scarce capable of any
means whereby it may be cured. And they who fear it not, nor use any means
to preserve themselves from this dreadful and deadly Lethargy, do evidently
show, that it has already seized on them, and brought them past sense and
apprehension of the danger. To which purpose Bernard speaks excellently. Do
not (says he) overmuch inquire after this hardness of heart, to Nee pergas
quaerere quid illud sit, si non expauisti tuum hoc est. Solum est cor durum
quod seipsum non exhorret, quia nec sentit. Ad Eugen. lib. 1.
know what it is. For if thou fear it not, thine heart is such an one; for
it is only the hard heart which is void of fear, and has no feeling of it
own hardness. But those that most fear it are farthest from it, seeing they
use all their care and best endeavor, in the use of all good means, whereby
they may be preserved from so great an evil; and think it not enough to
fight against it, when it appears in it height and strength, or rather
appears not unto them because it is so; but will avoid all occasions, and
withstand and overcome this mischief in its first beginnings and least
degrees. Neither does this evil seize upon us all at once in it full growth
and greatness, but steals and creeps upon us by degrees; as the Apostle
intimates, where he exhorts us to take heed, lest we be hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin. And as the hand does not at first get a callum Heb. 3.
13.
and brawnie hardness, but by much labor and exercise it grows upon it by
little and little: so this thick skin of carnal security, does not at first
ouer-grow the heart, but increases by degrees, by often sinning and much sloth
and negligence. We do not at first fall into a dead sleep, but by degrees it
comes on us; first we are drowsy and sluggish, we reach and stretch, and
give our selves to ease and rest, leaving off our bodily labor, and then we
slumber slightly, being not quite deprived of the use of our senses, so that if
a word be spoken we easily hear it and are awakned; and from slumbring we
fall to sleeping, which in the first entrance is more shallow, and afterward
more thoroughly seazeth on the senses, and so becomes more deep and dead: and
thus it is with this spiritual sleep of carnal security. It comes not to
the full depth at the beginning; But first we become drowsy and sluggish in
holy duties, we are soon wearied when we set our selves about them, and long
to have them ended; then we give our selves to carnal ease and begin to
neglect them altogether, or to perform them coldly and formally, as though we
were neither waking nor sleeping, but falling into a slumber; but even then we
may be raised and recovered, if God in his Word do rowze us up, and teach us
the means whereby we may shake off our sloth. Which if we neglect to hear,
either by absenting our selves or by careless contempt, then from slumbring
we fall to sleeping; and from shallow sleep, to sleep so deeply and soundly,
that we cannot hear Gods Ministers and Watchmen, though they lift up their
voices like a Trumpet, to tell us of our sins, and by sounding a loud alarm,
do give us warning of a whole Army of approaching evils. A green wound (as
one says) is not without sense of pain, nor is it presently Plaga recens
dolor non caret; neque enim iam occaluit vulnus nec in tam breui versum in
insensibile est. Bern. ad Eugen. lib. 1.
full of dead flesh, and gangrened so as it is quite past all feeling; and so
these wounds of sin are not insensible at the first, but are made to be so in
time, when the means are neglected, whereby they might be cured. And let us
follow the same course for the healing of our souls, which we take for helping
of our bodily diseases, that is, prevent them if we can, before they come, by
our care and providence, or if they have tainted us at unawares, let us
withstand them in their first beginnings; and set upon them in their weakness,
before they are settled, and so shall we get an easy victory.

. 2 The second remedy is, to nourish in our hearts the true fear of God.
The second means is, that we nourish in our hearts the fear of God, which
is the Antidote that expels the poison of carnal security; and considering
our great frailty, and the might and multitude, malice and policy of our
spiritual Enemies, let us follow the counsel of the Apostle, and work out
our salvation Phil. 2. 12.
with fear and trembling; assuring our selves that as our state is blessed,
when we nourish this fear, so it is fearful, when as our hearts are hardened
with carnal security. For as we are never further from falling, then when
fearing that we may fall, we do with all care and watchfulness look to our
footing; so we are never nearer to be overtaken with evil, then when thinking
it farthest off, we fear no danger, nor use any means whereby we may prevent
it; according to the saying of the wise Man; Blessed is the man that fears
always; Pro. 28. 14.
but he that hardneth his heart shall fall into mischief. For this fear will
cause us to keep a narrow watch over our hearts, that they do not entertayne,
as other sins, so especially this carnal security, which will make way for
all the rest, yea, and cherish and strengthen them after they are entered, so as
they will never depart nor be thrust out till this security be expelled with
them. It will set before us the examples of Gods chiefest Worthies, which have
been assaulted and foiled with this vice; and therefore enforce our greater
care and watchfulness, seeing we who are weak and feeble in comparison of
them, may much more easily be surprised, if we do not continually expect the
approach of it, and so with all diligence arm our selves against it.

. 3 The third remedy is, to make great account of a soft and relenting heart.
The third means is, that we make great account of a soft and relenting heart
and tender conscience, when we have them, which will make us tremble at the
hearing of Gods Word, and even melt like the heart of Josias, and strict and
scrupulous in avoiding all appearance of evil. To which end we must shun all
causes and occasions of sin, as well as the sin it self. Especially let us
avoid, as much as may be, the company of such as are hard hearted and carnally
secure, who are apt to infect us with their contagion. For as bodily
drowsinesse goes from one to another, and when we see our Companion yawne we
are ready to yawne also, being infected with his sluggishnesse; and the long
fetching of his breath that sleeps, is a means to draw sleep on others that
lie with him: so is this sloth of security alike contagious. We see that
those who are fearful and cowardly, are much emboldned to affront dangers,
when being in the company of such as are undaunted and desperate, they see them
often escape many perils, into which they have rashly adventured and thrust
themselves; and so does it make those that are fearful to commit sin, in
respect of the manifold evils that do accompany it, to become more bold and
aduenturous to run into it, and more secure and careless after it is
committed, when we have before our eyes, the examples of those who daily
commit greater sins with greater security, because for the present they live
in impunitie, and are not by God called to a reckoning. Again, if we would
preserve our hearts and consciences soft and tender, we must walk with God,
and set our selves in his presence, as Enoch did; and so shall we make scruple
not only of open and manifest, but of secret and unknown sins, because he
being always present, they are seen and known of him. Not only of such
sins as are great and heinous, but even of the least and first degrees of
wickedness; thinking no sin small which will lesson those sweet joys and
comforts we have in our communion with God, and change his gracious smiles and
influences of his favor, into an angry and frowning countenance. For if we
do without fear fall often into lesser sins, we shall in a while live
securely in those which are greater; and as Sheep and lesser Cattle, though
lighter of body, yet by their multitude trample a pathway, as soon as greater
and heavier beasts, that come more seldom and in lesser droues; so will these
lesser and lighter sins, in respect of their multitude and often happening,
harden the heart and cause it to become like a beaten path, unfit to receive
the seed of Gods Word, or to bring forth any fruits of godliness. Finally, we
must attentively harken to the voice of conscience, when it checketh us for
sin, or approves us for well-doing; restrayneth us from evil, or inciteth
us to good; and not suffer the voice thereof to be drowned with the clamor of
our lusts, which will make it weary of speaking and admonishing, when it
admonishes and speaks in vain, and willing to let us go on securely in our
courses, seeing we refuse to take counsel and direction from it. And we must
take heed of known and voluntary sins which wound the conscience, and being
often reiterated make it seared and benumbed, and casts it (as it were) into
a trance, in which it has no sense and feeling. For if this be our case,
needs must we sleep in deep security, when as our Watchman sleeps, that
should awake us; needs must we, like desperate Malefactors, be without fear of
Law and punishment, when we see no witness to give evidence against us. Our
care therefore must be, that we may avoid this fearful estate, to keep the
conscience pure from the defilements of sin, or if it be defiled to purge it
presently by renewing our faith and repentance. To preserve it in as much life
and sense as we can, or if we perceive that it begins to grow stupid and
benumbed, we must quicken and stir it up by meditating in the Law, and by
summoning it often to give an account, before the supreme Judge, of its neglect
of duty, and deadness and backwardness in giving evidence.

. 4 The fourth remedy is, examination of our estate.
The fourth means is, that we often and seriously examine our estate in the
Audit of conscience, and as in Gods presence, how it stands Psalm. 4. 4. and
119. 59.
between him and us, and whether it thriueth and grows better, or decays
and waxes worse in spiritual graces, and in the practice of Christian and
holy duties. As whether sin and corruption increases in strength, or whether
it is daily more and more mortified and subdued in us. Whether we profit or
thrine in our spiritual growth, by the means of our salvation, and the use of
Gods holy Ordinances, and wax richer in all spiritual graces, or whether we
spend of the stock and grow more faint and poor in them. With what appetite
we feed on the food of our souls, and how we are strengthened and increased
thereby in knowledge, faith, affiance, love and the fear of God, and with what
alacrity and cheerfulness we serve God in all holy duties. Whether we get or
lose ground in the spiritual Warfare, or have the better, or go by the worst
in the conflict of tentations against the Enemies of our salvation. Whether we
go forward, or backward, or stand at a stay, in our own conceit, in the
spiritual Race; and whether we be in such an estate, as that we could be
content to hear our last summons, to give an account of our Stewardship before
Gods Tribunal. How we have and do spend and employ his Talents committed to
our keeping, whether to the honor or dishonor of our Lord and Master, and the
profit or hurt of our fellow servants; and whether we in these respects keep
our accounts so even, as that we are daily ready to give up our reckoning, if
our great Lord and Sovereign do call us to it. And if we exercise our selves
much and often in such trialls and examinations, we shall daily grow in Gods
fear, and leave no place in our hearts for carnal security to lodge in; we
shall like those that do often look their faces in the glass, keep our
souls and consciences from these sinful spots, and from being besmeared and
ouer-growne with this dirt and filth of carnal security; and like good
Factors, we shall become wary and careful in managing our Masters business,
if with them we often look upon our Books of account, and sum up our
reckonings between him and us. But if with the Elephant being guilty of our
own foulness and deformities, we shun drinking in such clear waters as will
discover them unto us; if (like Helen in her age) we will not look our faces
in the glass of Gods Law, because we would not see our spiritual wrinkles; if
like unthrifts and banke-rupts, we will keep no Books of reckoning, or if we
have any, do cast them into the furthest corner of our memory, and seldom or
never look upon them; then may we well keep our consciences spotted, and our
hearts defiled, and our lives unreformed, and be utterly ruined in our
spiritual estate, and yet continue long in this miserable condition with much
security.

. 5 The fifth remedy is, to esteem much of private admonitions.
The fifth means is, that we much esteem the private admonitions and
reprehensions of our godly and faithful friends. For in nothing Eccles. 4. 9,
18.
more then this, is the saying of the wise Man verified; Two are better then
one, for if they fall, the one will help up his fellow: but woe to him that is
alone when he falls; for he has not another to help him up. When men are
apt through their drowsy sloth to neglect their weighty business, or to
forslow their journey by ouer-sleeping themselves, they hold it a great
kindness in those that will awaken them, and call them up betimes, though it
be not pleasant for the instant to be broken of their sleep. But what
business so weighty, as to make our election and calling sure? what journey
more important then to travail toward our heavenly Country? and wherein are
we more sluggish and apt to lose our best oportunities, by ouer-sleeping our
selves in carnal security, if we be not rowzed up and awakned with the
admonitions, exhortations, and necessary reproves of our faithful friends?
Those that are falling into a Lethargy, being unable to refrain sleeping, do
think themselves beholding after their recovery to such about them, as by
their pricking and nipping them, have kept them waking, though it may be for
the present, it was a thanklesse office, being so distastefull to their humor
and appetite; but we are prone to fall into this spiritual Lethargy of
carnal security, which is more dangerous and pernicious then ten thousand
bodily deaths; and therefore by so much more are we to esteem the kind
office of such a faithful friend, who by the nips and pricks of admonitions
and reproves, does keep us from falling or continuing in this sleep of
death. When our bodily sores begin to fester at the bottom, and to breed dead
flesh, and when our bodies abound with hurtful humors, we not only
voluntarily send for the Chyrurgeon and Physician, but thank and reward them,
though to our smart and pain, they use, to cure us, corrasiues and strong
potions. And shall we not be as careful for the recovery of our souls, and
as thankful to those who use these good means to effect the cure, although
they be distastefull; yea, painful and loathsome to our carnal sense and
appetite? But it is not enough that we highly esteem those Christian duties,
for our spiritual good; if our friends be not also willing to perform them.
Now to an ingenuous nature, it is in this cure as painful and unpleasant to
be the Physician as the Patient; to admonish and reprove our friends, as to
hear them admonishing and reproouing us; because it sauoureth of needless
curiosity and censorious business. And therefore it is necessary for us to
use all good means, to move one another to the performance of this duty. And
this we shall do if we perform it mutually as there is need on either side,
and watch over one another by turns, either party being ready to awaken the
other, when he sees him falling into this deadly sleep. For this liberty of
love being used on both sides, will make both more willing, both to speak and
hear, provided that it be not by way of regeration, and by retorting the
admonition at the same time; which sauoureth of some spleen, and argues a
willingness to requite, and a kind of impatiencie to be in debt, or by our
faultiness to be obnoxious unto our friend, unless he be as deeply engaged
unto us. And secondly, if our friend be mistaken in us, and we are able to
excuse and defend our innocence by a just apology; yet this must be done so,
as it may not give any distaste or discouragement unto him, in performing the
like duty another time, not by harsh contestations, but with great mildness
and love, thanking him much for his care in the general, although it causes
an error in this particular. And to this end let us remember that it was an
error of love, which as it is not suspicious, and hides a multitude of sins,
that they may not be discovered to our hurt and shame; so it is sometimes
jealous when it comes to play the part of the Chyrurgeon, and whilst it
searches our sores to the bottom, it may at unawares go somewhat too deep
and touch the quick, fearing to leave any of the dead flesh or core behind.

. 6 The sixth remedy is, to visit those who are in affliction.
The sixth means is, often to visit those who are afflicted, either outwardly
in body and estate, or inwardly in mind; as those who are ruined in their
estates, or have lost their nearest and needful friends, upon whom they
chiefly depended; or lie groaning upon the bed of sickness, or being afflicted
and troubled in conscience in the sight and sense of their sins, do
pitifully complain of their wretched and disconsolate condition. The which we
are principally to do in the time of our health, wealth and prosperity, when
as we are most apt to forget God and our selves, and so to be overtaken of
carnal security. For, we may use such distressed souls as glasses, to
represent unto us our own condition, and as lively pictures, in which we may
see resembled our own frailty and mortality. They may serve unto us as
visible Lectures, teaching and calling to our remembrance, both our own
sins, whereby we have deserved the like or greater punishments, the justice
of God, in his righteous judgments, and our own danger in respect of both, to
be attached with the like or more grievous afflictions, if we do not make use
of these examples in others, and by waxing wiser by their harms, do not
prevent them from falling on us, by turning from our sins by unfeigned
repentance. And as it is profitable for young Gallants that are given to
wastfulnesse, to look upon such Unthrifts as themselves, not in their ruff
and riot, when they are adored by Parasites, and seem to carry the world with
them in a string, for that will but make them the more secure in their wastfull
courses; but when, having spent all, they have lost all their credit and
esteem with their wealth, are forsaken of all their friends, censured for
their prodigality, even by those who for the time that the streams thereof
did flow, did quench their thirst, and supplied their wants by sucking from
them; finally cast into prison without hope of delivery, and not able to
supply themselves with the ordinary necessaries of food and apparel; seeing
in them they may easily learn what will be the end of their iourny, if they
hold on in the way of their excess and prodigality: So is it behoofefull for
those who flourishing in worldly prosperity, are ready to fall into the
slumber of carnal security, to acquaint themselves with such pitiful
objects, not only that they may hereby be put in mind of the bounty of God
toward them, who have received, though not deserved better then these in
affliction, and so may be moved to be more thankful unto him, and more
cheerful in his service, being encouraged with the present pay of more
liberal wages; but also considering that they are alike frail, and all
worldly things momentanie and mutable, they may not sleep in security, but
prepare themselves against the day of trial and tentation. In which regard the
Wiseman says, that it is Eccles. 7. 2.
better to go into the house of mourning, then the house of feasting; because
that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart, namely,
not only to be moved hereby to a work of mercy, in mourning with those that
mourn, and partaking with them in some of their grief, that it may be easier
when as we bear a part of their burden, even as we communicate unto them
some comfort and refreshing; but also that using them wisely as examples
whereby we may be warned to shake off security, and to enjoy our present
prosperity with temperance and sobriety.

. 7 The seventh remedy is, to meditate on the tentations and sufferings of
Christ.
The seventh means is, to remember and meditate often on the tentations,
afflictions, and sufferings of Christ. For what place is there for carnal
security, if we consider that the spiritual enemies of our salvation, durst
set upon Christ our Head, in whom there was no matter of corruption to work
upon, and from whom they received so many foiles? If they spared not to cast
their darts of tentations against this impregnable Fort and Pillar of strength,
how much more against us, who are but flesh and blood, and apt to be pierced,
through our weakness and corruption? And if they presumed to cast their
hellish wildfire against him, whose pure nature it could not touch nor taint,
but was presently exstinguished, as if it had fallen into the sea; what are we
to expect, whose corruption like unto touch-wood or tinder is easily set on
fire? what assaults, what wounds and foiles, are Ephesians. 6. 10, 11.
we to fear if we be not always prepared, strengthening our selves in the
Lord, and in the power of his might, and keeping the Christian Armor close
buckled unto us? Besides, meditation upon Christ's Passion and Sufferings is a
notable means to preserve us from security. For if Gods Justice be so exact,
and if his most pure nature so abhorred sin, that he punished it thus
severely in his only begotten and dearly beloved Son; how shall we escape,
if by a lively faith we be not united unto Christ, and so made partakers of
his satisfaction and obedience, bringing forth the fruits of this faith in
hearty repentance and amendment of life? Again, if Chsist our Head were
exposed to so many dangers, and in his whole life endured so many and grievous
afflictions, what place of security is there unto us who are members of his
body? For, if they have done these Luke 22 31.
things to the green tree, what shall be done to the dry? If they have thus
used our Lord and Master, they will not spare the poor servants of his
family; for, as our Savior says, The Disciple is not above his Math. 10. 24,
25. Ioh. 13. 16.
Master, nor the Servant is not better then his Lord. Yea, what security can
we have, as though we were in no danger of crosses and troubles, when as the
Scriptures plainly teach us, that as Christ our Head has thus suffered, so
likewise we his members must suffer with him: That we are predestinate by God
to be conformed to the image of his Son, first Romans 8. 29.
in his sufferings, and then in his glory. That by many tribulattons we Act.
14. 22.
must enter into the Kingdom of God. That if we will live Godly in Christ, 2.
Tim. 3. 12. and 2. 12.
we must suffer persecution. That if we will reign with Christ, we must first
suffer with him. That whom the Lord loves, he chasteneth, and Heb. 12. 6, 8.
scourges every son whom he receives; and if we be without chastisements,
whereof all are partakers, we are bastards and no sons. In which regard we
have no reason, no not in our greatest prosperity to be secure, seeing we are
daily in danger of these crosses and afflictions; which if we altogether
escape, and pass all our days in peace and ease, plenty and prosperity,
then have we least cause of all to be secure, Psalm. 17. 14.
for it is the greatest affliction not at all to be afflicted, seeing we Luke
16. 25.
may justly fear, that we are bastards and no sons, in that our heavenly
Father corrects us not; that with the wicked we have our portion in this
life, and with the well fed Ox are fatted for the slaughter.

. 8 The eighth remedy is, to consider that security in this life is
unseasonable.
The eighth means is, to remember and consider, that in this life there is no
time nor place for security, but we are then to expect true security when we
are come safe to our heavenly home. For we are now Pilgrims and Trauellours,
that continually are in danger to fall into the hands of Thieves, who will
rob and spoil us, not only of temporal blessings, but of the rich treasures
of spiritual graces. We are not yet in the Haven but in a dangerous Sea,
tossed and turmoiled with the tempests of trouble, and therefore we must not
give our selves to security and rest, but be always preparing against a
storm. We are now Exiles among strangers that love us not, and therefore are
ready to spy all advantages to do us hurt; in which regard we had need not
to sleep in security, but to keep a good watch, and to stand upon our guard,
that we be not surprised at unawares. We are in the Christian warfare,
sighting against the many and mighty politic and malicious enemies of our
salvation, and therefore in the putting on of our Armor, we must not take
unto us that security which is only fit and seasonable when we put it off,
we must not carry our selves in the day of battle as in the day of triumph;
nor bless 2. King. 2. 11. Quousque vicino serpente tua male secura dormitat
industria? Bernard. Epist. Nulla est securitas vicino serpente dormire.
Hieronym. Vbi est maxima securitas, ibi maximum est periculum. August. in Psalm.
99 Iam quidem per conuersionem rubrum mare transitum est. etc. Gregor. lib. 24.
cap. 7. August. confess. lib. 10. cap. 32. col. 178. Vbi est securitas? Hic
nusquam, i^ ista vita, nusquam, etc. in Psalm. 99. cap. 8. c. 1116.
our selves as though we were free from all dangers, when as we are on all
sides encompassed with them. There is no place to sleep in security, when the
old Serpent is so near unto us; for, in this case, the greater security the
greater danger. And though, as one says, we have by our conversion passed the
Red Sea, yet in the Wilderness of this present life, we shall not want
enemies to set upon us. We have left behind us our sins past, as it were the
Egyptians drowned upon the Shore; but yet, hurtful vices and corruptions (as
it were) other enemies encounter us, and seek to stop our passage, as we are
traveling toward the Land of Canaan. Now our former faults, like pursuing
enemies, only by the Divine virtue assisting us are slaughtered, but the
pricks of tentations, as it were, other enemies come in the front, which
cannot be vanquished without our diligence and labor. No man (says Austine)
ought to be secure in this life which wholly is called a tentation: lest he,
which of worse might become better, of better become worse. There is but one
hope, one trust, one firm promise and assurance, even thy mercies. And again,
Where (says he) is security? no where in this life, but only in the hope of
Gods promises: but when we shall attain to heavenly happiness, there shall
we enjoy perfect security; when the Gates of the new Jerusalem shall be shut
and made sure with strong bars, there shall be full rejoicing and exsulting
with great joy. And therefore, let us not by a false security, which is an
abortiue brat, and borne before the time, expose our selves to greater danger,
especially to the hazard and loss of that heavenly security, which shall be
disturbed with no trouble; but let us stay our time; and watch till the
Bridegroom does come, and open the door for us to enter into the wedding
Chamber; and now prepare our selves to fight against our spiritual Enemies,
that having gotten the victory in this life, we may triumph over them with
joy, peace, and endless security in the life to come.

. 9 The ninth remedy is, to meditate often on the last judgment.
The ninth means to shun carnal security is, often to meditate on the day of
Judgment, the all-seeing Wisdom, omnipotent Power, Sieve Comedam, sieve bibam,
sieve aliud aliquid faciam, semper vox illa terribilis auribus meis insonare
videtur. Surgite mortui, and venite ad iudicium. Hieron. in Matthew. Matthew. 24.
46, 47, 48, 51.
and the exact Justice of our Judge, the greatness of our reckonings, and
strictness of that account which will then be required; and will be
impossible for us to set even, if we seldom or never think of them here, but
pass our time in sloth and security. Let us remember how happy their
condition will be, who like faithful servants have been careful to perform
their duty, watching daily for the coming of their Lord, when they shall be
reputed blessed, and be made Ruler of their Masters substance; and the
miserable plight of those who have not expected his coming nor prepared for
it, but have spent their days in riot and pleasure, in oppression and
cruelty; when coming suddenly he shall take them at unawares, cut them off,
and give them their portion with Hypocrites, where shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. Let us think with what joy we shall hear that happy
sentence; Well done, good and faithful servant, Matthew. 25. 21, 26, 27, 30.
thou have been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many
things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord; and with what tormenting grief
and bitter anguish, those who have been unprofitable and unfruitful, shall
hear that fearful saying; Thou wicked and slothful servant, etc. Take the
talent from him, and give it unto him that has ten talents, etc. And cast the
unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing
of teeth. Let us consider, with what cheerfulness and joy we shall meet the
Bridegroom, the Lord of glory and happiness, if we have watched for his
coming, and are found in readiness, having our Lamps of Faith and a godly
life clearly burning, when we shall enter with him into the bridal Chamber of
eternal blessedness, to be feasted with unspeakable Matthew. 25. 1, 2, etc.
pleasures, and to solace our selves perpetually in his love; and with what
terror and dismayednesse they shall be possessed, who by his coming shall be
awakned out of their sleep of carnal security, and being unready shall be
shut out of doors, and when they desire to enter shall hear that fearful and
dreadful speech; Go your ways, I know you not. Finally, let us remember with
what inestimable joy and rejoicing, we shall hear that happy sentence; Come
ye blessed Children of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the World; and with what horror and howling the Wicked shall
hear their last doom; Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his angels. And withal, let us set before us the
execution of this righteous sentence, which shall be, not the momentanie or
only long continuance of these rewards and punishments, but eternal life and
happiness to the godly and Matthew. 5. 46.
faithful, and everlasting death and condemnation to the wicked and
unbelievers.

. 10 The last remedy is, frequent and fervent prayer for Gods blessing upon
all the former means
The last means, which sanctifies and gives efficacy unto all the rest, is
frequent and fervent prayer, that it will please the Watchman of Israel, who
neither slumbreth nor sleeps to watch over us, and to preserve us in
watchfulness, that we fall not into this sleep of carnal security, or being
ready to slumber that he will awaken and rowse us up with the good motions of
his Word and Spirit. And when we feel our hearts enclining to hardness by
their neglect, or slothful, cold, and sluggish use of the means of our
salvation, we must with the Church, expostulate with God, and cry out unto
him: O Lord, why have thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our Esa.
63. 17.
hearts from thy fear? And earnestly desire him with David, that he will
create in us a clean heart, and renew a right spirit in us; and that Psalm. 51.
10.
according to his promise, he will take the stony hearts out of our bodies,
Ezeeh. 11. 19.
and give us hearts of flesh, which will tremble at his Word, and fear him for
his Mercies and Judgments. Finally, let us pray unto him, that he will give us
grace with all care and good conscience, to use the means before spoken of,
and so bless them unto us by his holy Spirit, as that they may be effectual
for our preservation from carnal security, for the suppling and softning of
our hearts, for the replenishing of them with his true fear, and for the
stirring of us up to Christian watchfulness; that we may be in readiness
against the day of the appearing of our Bridegroom, our LORD and SAVIOVR JESUS
CHRIST, and so may enter into that door of heavenly happiness, and communicate
with him in those unspeakable and everlasting joys, which with his precious
death and bloodshed, he has purchased for us.

OF SPIRITVALL AND CHRISTIAN SECVRITIE.
THE SECOND BOOK.
CHAP. I.
Wherein spiritual security is defined, and the definition explaned.

. 1 That all security is not to be condemned, but that it is in some kind
commendable; and to be desired.
Having spoken of that Security, which is natural, in all the kinds of it: it
now in Non quaelibet securitas est laudabilis: sed qua^do deponit a^iquis curam
p^out deb^t. Th. Aquin. 2. 2. quaest. 129. art. 7.
the last place remains, that we briefly entreat of that Security which is
supernatural, divine and holy. For as all Security is not commendable, but
only when a man, as he ought, lays aside all care; so on the other side, all
Security is not to be condemned, but when he assumeth it as he ought not;
namely, such a Security as is built on an ill foundation, and upon false and
deceitful grounds; which as it proceeds from evil causes, so it always
produces evil and pernicious effects, as has sufficiently been showed in
the former discourse. But besides this, there is a Security which is good and
warrantable, commendable, and to be desired and embraced of us, grounded on
just causes, and rightly assumed of those unto whom of due it appertains;
namely, the security of the faithful, having its foundation not upon any
thing in themselves, or any inferior means and secundarie causes, but upon
God alone his Power, Providence and Promises, made unto them in Jesus Christ.
For after that we are regenerate by the Spirit of God, and being reconciled,
are become his Children by adoption and grace, and so like Children in the
favor of our heavenly Father, and received under the covert of his protection,
then begins that created Security, which was in the state of Innocence, to
be renewed in us; the which though we cannot attain unto in the highest
perfection in this life, because our knowledge, faith and love, which should
cast out all fear, are imperfect; yet is it much firmer, surer, and more
permanent, then that of our first Parents, because that rested on the condition
of their obedience, and this upon the freedom of their will, which was mutable
and changeable; but this renewed security, rests upon the covenant of Grace
made in Christ and his Righteousness and Obedience, which are unchangeable and
everlasting, and has no condition on our part, but a lively faith, bringing
forth fruits of unfeigned repentance; and these Graces also are the free gifts
of God, which after he has once bestowed, he never again takes Romans 11. 29.
from us. And this security every Christian ought to labor after, and so much
the rather, because we shall never be freed from that carnal security which
is so dangerous and pernicious, before we have given entertaynment unto this
other in our hearts. For some shelter Man naturally desires and will have,
under which shrowding himself, he may be safe either in Truth or in Opinion,
and so freed from horrors and fears, which otherwise, like hellish Furies,
would haunt and vex him. Which was the cause, (as I have showed) why our first
Parents being deprived, through their fall, of their created security,
grounded upon the knowledge and remembrance of God, and his saving Attributes;
were so apt to be abused by Satan, imposing in stead thereof a false and
counterfeit security, contrariwise grounded on ignorance and forgetfulness;
which, whilst through the blindness of their minds it freed them from fear,
because the causes of their fear could not be discerned by them, it did expose
them to much the greater danger, because they were in the case of those, who
are in the time of their sleep assaulted with many, mighty, and malicious
Enemies, and do not so much as dream of their approaching. But yet such is
man's nature, that he had rather be covered with Fig-leaues, then have no
clothing, and have in his hands a Reed and paper Buckler, which have no
strength to defend him, but what he gives them by a false opinion, rather then
no weapons at all; and will choose rather a counterfeit security, which may
serve for the present to preserve him from true horrors and fears, that he may
not be tormented before the time, rather then he will have none at all. In
which respects it is the only way, when we would persuade men to cast off
carnal security, to offer them in stead thereof Christian security, which
delivers from all dangers, not only in show and opinion, but also in Deed
and Truth; excelling the other in worth, more then massy gold a rotten gilded
post, and in strength more then Armor of proof, a painted shadow; or an
impregnable Fort, a paper Wall.

. 2 The description of spiritual Security.
And to this purpose, I thought it necessary to add something of it to the
former discourse, hoping that men will with more ease be moved to cast away that
intoxicating and pernicious poison, which makes them to sleep out the
tortures of an evil conscience, and depriueth them of their senses, that with
them it may take away their fears; when in stead thereof I offer unto them
this sovereign Cordial, which will expel them, and arm the heart with true
Christian courage and resolution. In speaking whereof I will first show what it
is, the nature, causes, and effects of it; and then the means whereby we may
be enriched with this inestimable treasure. Concerning the first, it may be
thus described. Christian security is a grace of God, following our
regeneration, justification, and peace with him through Jesus Christ; whereby
acknowledging, believing, and remembering the all-seeing wisdom, omnipotent
power, infinite goodness and mercy of God toward us in Christ, we do
without carnal and servile fear, in all estates and at all times, rest
quietly and contentedly upon his promises and providence, for the supplying of
all our wants, protection from all dangers, and deliverance from all evils.

. 3 That God is the author of spiritual security.
In which description, I show first the Fountain from which it springs; not
from nature, whose poisonous breasts do now give no such milk; not from our
own wisdom, power, endeauours, or any worldly causes, or secundarie means;
but from God himself the Author and Fountain of every good and perfect gift,
who of his free grace bestows this blessing upon those that fear and serve
him. And Iam. 1. 17.
as it proceeds from him, so upon him, as the only sure foundation, it
rests and relyeth, and not on humane policy and strength or any creature,
or earthly thing whatsoever. So the Lord propounds this ground of Christian
courage and security, and no other. Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not
dismayed, for I am thy God; I will strengthen Esa. 41. 10. 13. Ier. 30. 10. and
46. 27, 28. Heb. 13. 5, 6. Psalm. 3. 5, 6. and 4. 8.
thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of
my righteousness. I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto
thee, fear not, I will help. And upon this alone, holy David securely
rests: I laid me down and slept, I awaked for the Lord sustained me. I
will not be afraid of ten thousand of people that have set themselves against
me round about. And again: I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for
thou Lord only make me dwell in safety. Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no Psalm. 23. 4.
evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. And
elsewhere: The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? Psalm. 27.
1, 3.
The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? Though an host
should encampe against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise
against me, in this will I be confident. And in another place: What time I am
afraid I will trust in thee; In God I have put my trust, I Psalm. 56. 3, 4.
will not fear what flesh can do unto me. Thus the Church triumphs over
all her troubles, and remains secure in cases of greatest fear, in sole
confidence of Gods protection. God is our refuge and Psalm. 46. 1, 2, 3.
strength, a very present help in trouble; therefore will we not fear though
the earth be removed; and though the mountains be carried into the midst of
the sea, etc. And so likewise the Apostle Paul. What shall we say then to these
things? if God be for us, who can be against us? who Romans 8. 31. to 39.
shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that justifies,
who is he that condemns? etc. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
peril, or sword? nay in all these things we are more then Conquerours through
him that loved us: and thereupon he concludes: I am persuaded that neither
death nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able
to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Yea; so
solely and wholly do the faithful ground their spiritual security upon the
Lord, that when they excel and abound in wisdom, strength, and all earthly
helps, it is not increased; and when they are deprived of them all, it is no
whit lessened and abated; because the Lord in himself is all-mightie and
all-sufficient, and has by all these means no strength added unto him, nor
yet is any whit weakened, when all these inferior comforts and encouragements
are taken away. And this the Lord requires of Abraham, that he should be
secure in his sole protection; Fear not Gen 15. 1. and 17. 1.
Abraham, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. And again, I am the
almighty God, or the God all-sufficient, walk before me, and be thou upright.
And of the Church; Fear not thou worm Jacob and ye Esa 41. 14.
men of Israel; I will help thee, says the Lord, and thy Redeemer the holy
One of Israel. Intimating thus much, that though the Church were so sensible of
her own weakness, that she was as unable in her own strength to resist the
malicious rage of her cruel enemies, as a seely worm; yet she had cause
enough to be secure and without 2. Cor. 12. 9.
fear, because the Lord (who is all-sufficient, and takes delight to manifest
his power in weakness) had promised his help.

. 4 That the regenerate only are the subject of spiritual security.
Thirdly I say, that this Christian security follows our regeneration,
justification, and peace with God; because there is no true security to those
who are unregenerate, under the guilt, and obnoxious to the punishment of
sin; and who have God for their enemy, who is able and ready every minute
to consume and destroy them. There is no sound security to those, who by
hellish charms have rocked conscience asleep, which is every day in danger to
be awakened, and being rowzed up, will catch them by the throat, and hale them
to answer for all their crimes at the impartial Bar of Gods fearful
Judgment. In which regards, I may conclude with the Prophet, that there is no
such peace to the wicked; for when they are once awakened Esa. 57. 20, 21.
out of this sleep of carnal security, they are like the troubled Sea when
it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. But it is the faithful
only, who being truly converted from their wicked ways, justified and
reconciled unto God, and having peace with him, have also peace of conscience,
that are capable of this grace of spiritual security.

. 5 The grounds of spiritual security, on which it rests.
Fourthly, I lay down the grounds of Christian security whereupon it rests,
namely knowledge, belief, and remembrance of God and his saving attributes.
Wherein it is quite contrary to carnal security, which is grounded on the
ignorance, not believing, and forgetfulness of them; which the greater they
are, the greater is the carnal man's security; even as contrariwise spiritual
security increases in strength, as we do more and more increase in the
contrary graces. Fifthly, I show what fear spiritual security expels,
namely that only which is carnal and servile. For, as for that holy, filial,
and spiritual fear of God our gracious Father in Jesus Christ, it is no way
opposite to this Christian security, yea, they are mutual causes one of
another; and so, the more the one increases, the more vigor and strength it
ministers to the other. The more happy we find and feel our selves in our
secure resting under Gods protection, the more Nihil potest esse securius, quam
illi omnia committere qui nouit suis cultoribus congrue profutura praestare.
Cassian. in Psa. 72.
we fear to displease so gracious a Father, under the wings of whose
providence we enjoy such sweet security; and the more we fear to offend him,
the more secure we are in his love and favor. For, as one says, nothing can
be more safe and secure, then to commit all things unto him, who knows how to
give most fitly all things profitable to those that fear and serve him.

. 6 Of the continuance and perpetuity of spiritual security.
Sixthly, I add the continuance and perpetuity of the Christians security,
not for a spint alone like carnal security, till the conscience be awakened
with the threatenings of the Law, or the smart of Gods severe Judgments; but in
all estates, and at all times, though not always alike and in the same
proportion, in his sense and feeling. In which respect the Christian finds it
to increase or diminish, as he thriueth or decays in those graces which are
the causes, which both breed and nourish it, and as he is more diligent and
careful, or more negligent and remiss in using the means whereby it is
obtained and preserved. But when the Christian thriueth in spiritual grace, is
watchful over all his ways, and endeavors in all things to please and
serve God, and so preserves inwardly peace with him and peace of conscience,
then is there no outward thing that can disturb his peace, or deprive him of
his spiritual security which he has in the assurance of Gods favor and
protection, but he constantly retains it at all times, and in all estates,
and enjoys secure peace in the midst of wars and troubles, and a quiet
calm in the greatest storms and tempests of worldly calamities. As for
example, in the time of extremest dangers he is secure and safe, as though
there were no peril approaching; so as he can say with David; I laid me down
and slept; Psalm. 3. 5, 6.
I awaked, for the Lord sustained me; I will not be afraid for ten thousands of
people, that have set themselves against me round about. The Lord Psalm. 27. 1,
3.
is my light and salvation, whom shall I fear? the strength of my life, of
whom shall I be afraid? Though an host should encampe against me, my heart
shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this I will be
confident. And with the Church: God is our refuge and strength, a very Psalm.
46. 1, 2.
present help in trouble: therefore will we not fear, though the earth be
removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea. So
in the time, not only of worldly prosperity, when God hedgeth him in on all
sides with the pledges of his love, but also of affliction, trouble, and
persecution, he is secure in the assurance of Gods favor; because he knows
that these are signs of his adoption, Romans 8. 28.
and that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them
that are the Called according to his purpose. That verse. 35.
Afflictions, Tribulation, Distress, Persecution, Famine, Nakedness, Peril
or Sword, shall not be able to separate him from the love of Christ. That they
do not hinder, but further him in the way to everlasting happiness; For by
many tribulations we must enter into the Act. 14. 22.
Kingdom of God; we must first suffer with Christ, that afterward 2. Tim. 2.
12.
we may reign with him; and these short and momentanie afflictions 2. Cor. 4.
17.
shall cause unto us, a far most excellent and an eternal weight of glory.
That they are not unto them effects of the Legal curse, but assurances of
everlasting Blessedness; according to that of David; Blessed is the man whom
thou chastenest, O Lord; and teach him out Psalm. 94. 12.
of thy Law. And of the Apostle Peter; If ye suffer for Righteousness, Pet.
3. 14.
happy are ye, and be not afraid of their terror, neither be ye troubled.
And of the Apostle James: Blessed is the man that indureth Iam. 1. 12.
tentation, for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life, which the
Lord has promised to them that love him. And finally, that of our Savior:
Blessed are they that are persecuted for Righteousness Matthew. 5. 10, 11.
sake; for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are ye when men revile
you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely
for my sake; rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven.
In which respects, they that are justified by Faith Romans 5. 1, 3.
and have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, not only rejoice in
hope of the glory of God, and bear their afflictions with patience, but even
glory in tribulation, as the Apostle speaks. In a word, he loses not his
spiritual security, no not in the agony of death it self; because the
Righteous has hope in death, and when he Pro. 14. 32.
is killed, even by Gods own hand, can say with Job, Though he slay Job 13.
15.
me, yet will I trust in him. And because he knows, that though Death be
able to separate his soul from the body, yet it is not able Romans 8. 38, 39.
to separate him from the love of God in Christ. Yea, contrariwise it shall
serve as a passage conducting him into Gods presence, and hasten the fruition
of this glorious Majesty and supreme goodness, In whose presence is fullness
of joy, and at whose right hand there are Psalm. 16. 11.
pleasures for ever more.

CHAP. II.
Of the Causes and Effects of spiritual Security.

. 1 The causes of spiritual security respecting God.
Having showed what spiritual Security is, it now follows that we entreat
of the Causes of it; which are of Deus nobis haec otiasecit. Virgil. Eclog. 1.
two sorts, the first respecting God, the other our selves. The chief and
principal cause of it is Gods free grace, working this spiritual security in
our hearts, that we may with greater joy and cheerfulness, perform unto him
faithful service, when as we are assured, that though we have many enemies
which oppose us in it, yet none shall be able to do us any hurt, nor hinder
us from receiving the recompense of reward, which the Lord of his free mercy
and grace has promised unto us. And thus David acknowledges that it was no
wisdom, power or providence of his own, but the Lord only that did make him
dwell in safety. And that Psalm. 4. 1. and 91. 1.
he who dwells in the secret place of the most High, shall abide safe from
all danger under the shadow of the Almighty. Secondly, we have this security
by the free donation and legacy of Jesus Christ, who at his coming in the
flesh, brought this peace with him, and caused it to be proclaimed by his holy
Angels: Glory to God in the Highest, and on Luke 2. 14.
Earth peace, good will toward men. And leaving the Earth, bequeathed unto the
faithful, and left this peace behind him. Peace I leave with Ioh. 14. 27.
you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world gives give I unto you (that
is, a worldly and outward peace, for in the World ye shall have Ioh. 16. 33.
tribulation; but a spiritual peace with God, and peace of Conscience, by
which ye shall have inward tranquillity of mind, and security from all
danger, in the midst of earthly troubles, and therefore) let not your heart
be troubled, neither let it be afraid. The fruit of which peace is the
security of all the faithful, following their regeneration and change of
their nature from savage cruelty, unto a Doue-like simplicity and Lambe-like
meekness one toward another, according to that prophecy of Esaias, foretelling
the state of Christ's Kingdom. The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the
Leopard shall lie down Esa. 11. 6, 7.
with the Kid, and the Calfe, and the young Lion, and the Fatling together; and
a little Child shall lead them, etc. And the suckling Child shall play on the
hole of the Aspe, and the weaned Child shall put his hand on the Cockatrice
Den. They shall not destroy in all mine holy Mountain; for the Earth shall be
full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters that cover the Sea. Thirdly,
we enjoy this security by virtue of the Covenant of grace, which God has made
with us in Jesus Christ. Wherein the Lord has freely promised that he will be
our God and King, and we his peculiar People and Subjects of his Kingdom; whom
he will therefore receive under his protection, and preserve safe and secure
from all danger; and that he will be our Shepherd, and we his Flock and the
Sheep of his pasture, whom he will keep safe in his Sheepe-fold from the
Wolf, Lion, Bear, and all other ravenous Beasts, which shall attempt to hurt
us, according to that of the Prophet: I will save my Flock, and they shall no
more be a prey. And I will Ezech. 34. 22, to 31.
set one Shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David
(that is, Jesus Christ the Son of David) he shall feed them, and he shall
be their Shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David a
Prince among them; I the Lord have spoken it. And I will make with them a
covenant of peace; and I will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the Land;
and they shall dwell safely in the Wilderness, and sleep in the Woods, etc.

. 2 The causes of spiritual security respecting our selves.
The causes of this spiritual security on our part, are those virtues and
graces received from God, which have the promise of it, and make us fit and
capable to receive and apprehend it, when as the Lord of his free grace does
offer it unto us. The principal whereof is the Spirit of adoption, crying in
our hearts, Abba Father; which seals up Romans 8. 15, 16.
in our hearts the assurance of Gods love, and bears witness with our
spirit, that we are children of God. And if Children, then Heirs, and Heirs
of God and Co-heires with Christ, who as we suffer together, so shall we be
glorified together. The which Spirit of adoption is opposed to the Spirit of
bondage, and freeing us from all servile fear, does inuest us with the
privilege, and together with it the peace of security of the Children of God.
And this Spirit also is accompanied with an whole Army of spiritual Graces,
which taking up, and (as it were) manning the Fort of our hearts, do keep
them and us safe and secure in all assaults of danger, and the spiritual
encounters of tentations, so as they shall never be able to make us fall away,
or alienate us from Gods use. So the Apostle Peter tells us, that if we give
all diligence 2. Pet 1. 5, 6, 10.
to make our Calling and Election sure, by adding one Grace and Virtue to
another; this golden Chain will so keep and strengthen us, that we shall
never fall, that is, neither from the estate of Grace in this life, into the
state of sin and death; nor from our assurance of the state of Glory, in the
life to come, into that miserable condition of condemnation and destruction.

. 3 Of the particular causes of spiritual security, first, saving knowledge.
But besides these Graces in general, there are special Graces, which are the
causes of this spiritual Security, both because the promise of it is made by
God unto them, and because in this respect we become capable of it, and fit to
apprehend and receive it when the Lord in mercy bestows it upon us. The first
of these, is the saving Knowledge and remembrance of God and his saving
Attributes, of Wisdom, Power, All Sufficiency, Mercy, Goodness, Love and
Truth; not only as they are infinitely in God, and of his Essence and Nature;
but as they extend and are exercised toward us. For when we acknowledge and
remember, that God is infinite in all goodness and perfection, is our God, and
we his Servants and Children; that he is infinite in wisdom, and knows what
is best for us, how to prevent all dangers, to supply most fitly and fully all
our wants, and to deliver us most seasonably from all evil both of sin and
punishment; that he is infinite in power and able to do whatsoever he will,
and can at pleasure destroy our Enemies, and defeat all their projects and
purposes, and arm us with strength in our greatest weakness, so as we shall
be able to overcome them, and withstand all their tentations; that he is
all-sufficient, and by himself able to supply all our wants, as well without as
with means; and a rich portion, which is sufficient to make them who enjoy him
happy, in the absence of all earthly good and presence of all temporal
miseries; that he is infinite in mercy, goodness and love toward us in
Christ, and therefore as willing, as able to do that for us, which he knows
to be best, and most fit to make us eternally happy, and that he is also
infinite in truth, most infallibly verifying and accomplishing his Word and
gracious Promises, made unto us of Grace and Glory, temporal protection and
everlasting salvation; then do we cast our selves securely upon his
providence, for supply of all our wants, protection from all dangers, and
deliverance out of all miseries and afflictions. So that as carnal security
is caused through the ignorance and forgetfulness of God and his Attributes;
so Christian security, which is opposite unto it, is caused by the knowledge,
acknowledgement, and remembrance of them.

. 4 The second cause, a lively Faith in Christ.
The second cause which produces this spiritual security, as the fruit and
effect of it, is a lively faith in Christ, and firm affiance and Romans 5. 1, 3.
confidence in God. For being justified by Faith, we have peace with God, and
peace of Conscience, and with them inward security and spiritual joy, even in
afflictions and tribulations. So being by Faith ingrafted into Christ, and
become members of his body, we may be secure in his power and protection,
assuring our selves that he will preserve his own members from all evil,
provide for them all necessaries, and defend them from the malice and power of
all Enemies, so as they shall not be able to hurt and destroy them, which were
to suffer a mayme in his own blessed Body. If we by Faith rely our selves
upon this Rock of strength, then though the Rain descend, and the Floods
come, and the Winds blow and beat upon us, yet we are secure Matthew. 7. 26.
from all danger, because we cannot sink or fall being founded upon a Rock.
If we believe Gods Promises of preservation and protection, there is no cause
of fear in the greatest extremities, because we are sure of help and
deliverance, which is certainly promised to all the faithful, according to the
saying of Iehosaphat; Believe 2. Chron. 20. 20.
in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established, believe his Prophets and
ye shall prosper. If believing in God we put our affiance in him, and cast our
selves wholly upon his providence and protection, this will work in us this
spiritual security. For he that dwells in the secret of Psalm. 91. 1, 2, 3,
etc.
the most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. He that makes
the Lord his refuge, fortress and trust, shall be delivered from the snare of
the Fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He will cover him with his
feathers, and under his wings shall he trust, his Truth shall be his shield and
buckler. He shall not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that
flies by day, etc. because he has made the Lord his refuge, and the most
high his habitation. There shall no evil befall him, neither shall any plague
come near his dwelling. For he will give his Angels charge over him, to keep
him in all his ways, etc. If with David we put our trust in the Lord, we
shall not need to fear what Psalm. 56. 4.
flesh can do unto us. If we trust in the Lord we shall be blessed, and
Ier. 17. 7, 8.
like a Tree planted by the Waters, that spreads out her Roots by the River,
which shall not see when heat comes, but her leaf shall be green, and
shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from
yielding fruit.

. 5 The third cause, Charity.
The third cause of spiritual security is Charity; for (as the Apostle
tells us) there is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; 1.
Ioh. 4. 18. Col. 3. 14, 15.
and if we do above all things put on charity which is the bond of
perfectness, then also will the peace of God rule in our hearts, and work in
them this Christian security. For if we truly love God, it is an evident
sign unto us that he loves us; for as the Apostle says, We love him because
he loved us first; and being assured of Gods love, we 1. Ioh. 4. 19.
need not to doubt of his protection, whereby he will keep us from all evil;
and of his providence watching over us, which will provide for us all things
necessary. And finally, if we unfeignedly love the Lord, then may we be secure
in all dangers, and in the midst of all troubles and crosses, because the
Lord through his infinite wisdom and power will cause all things, even
afflictions themselves, to work together for good to them that love him; and
will so weaken the Romans 8. 28, 35.
strength of them, that they shall never be able to separate us from the love
of Christ.

. 6 The fourth cause, the true fear of God.
The fourth cause is, the true fear of God, for this fear remooueth all other
fears whatsoever, and if with filial affection we fear God Psalm. 34. 9.
as Sons, we may thereby be freed from the servile fear of Slaves. So also
this fear of God will free us from fear of Men, and the fear of our Creator
will quite expel the fear of the Creature. It will free us from fear of all
danger of evil, seeing nothing shall be able to hinder our happiness. For,
Blessed is the man that fears the Lord; he shall not be moved for ever, but
shall be had in everlasting remembrance. Psalm. 112. 1, 6, 7.
He shall not be afraid of any evil tidings, his heart is fixed trusting in
the Lord. His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his
desire upon his enemies.

The fifth cause is, Justice and righteousness both in our hearts, words and
actions: because, as the Wiseman says, He that walks uprightly walks
surely: for, the righteous shall never be removed, and there Pro. 10 9, 10.
and 12. 21.
shall no evil happen unto the just. And that because the Lord watches over
them, to deliver them in the time of danger, and provide for them in the time
of want. For, as the Psalmist says, The eyes of the Psalm. 34. 15. 1. Pet. 3.
12.
Lord are upon the Righteous, and his ears are open to hear their cry; so
that, none shall be able to harm us, if we follow that which is good. And
unto them he has made his promises of peace and protection. The work of
righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness quietness and
assurance for ever; and my people shall dwell in a peaceable Esa. 32. 17.
habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places. And again: In
righteousness thou shall be established; thou shall be far from oppression,
for thou shall not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near Esa.
54. 14.
thee. In assurance of which promises, the righteous is bold as a Lion, Pro.
28. 1.
and disdaineth to go out of his way of justice and godliness, though he be
affronted with many dangers, because being armed with this breast plate of
righteousness, he is assured they cannot hurt him. Ephesians. 6. 14.


. 7 The last cause is new obedience.
The last cause of this spiritual security is new obedience. For when like
dutiful and loving children, we do desire and endeavor to do the will of
our heavenly Father, at all times and in all things, and perform as much as we
are able, that obedience which his law requires, not only in our outward
actions, but also in our hearts and inward affections; and bewail our wants
and imperfections, when we come short of that measure and degree which we
desire to attain unto, it will work in our hearts a child-like confidence in
the love of our God, and make us securely to repose and cast our selves in all
estates and conditions upon his gracious providence, for the supplying of all
our wants, protection from all dangers, and deliverance out of all afflictions.
And so much the rather, because we are hereby strengthened in our Faith, and
enabled to apply unto our selves all those sweet and comfortable promises
which God has made unto those who bring forth these fruits of new obedience;
especially those which concern spiritual peace and tranquillity of mind, and
this holy and Christian security. So the Lord promises, That if we will
keep his Statutes and Judgments, we shall dwell in the Land in Leuit. 25.
18, 19.
safety. And in another place, That if we keep his Statutes, and walk Chap.
26. 3, 5, 6.
in his Commandments to do them, the Lord with all other temporal benefits,
promises peace and safety; and that we shall lie down and none shall make
us afraid. And Zophar tells us, that if we prepare Job 11. 13, 15, 19
our hearts to seek God, and stretch out our hands toward him, that then we
shall be steadfast and without fear, lie down securely, and be freed from the
fear of all things. So Wisdom promises, that who so hearken unto her, and
obey her voice, they shall dwell safely, and shall Pro. 1. 33.
be quiet from fear of evil. Yea, the Lord has not only said, but sworn
it, that all his redeemed shall worship and serve him without fear, Luke 1.
74, 75.
in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of their life.

. 8 Of the effects of spiritual security.
And these are the causes of this spiritual security. The effects of it are
quite contrary to those of carnal security; for it does not make us more
slothful and sluggish in the service of God, but more watchful over all our
ways, that we may do all things which are acceptable unto God, from whom we
enjoy so great a blessing; and not commit any thing against knowledge and
conscience, which may disturb our sweet peace, or deprive us of the inward joy
of this spiritual security. It does not make us more negligent and backward
in holy duties, but to perform them with all diligence and cheerfulness,
seeing we walk in this way of godliness without fear; and have part of our
heavenly wages in present pa^, peace of conscience, spiritual security, and
joy in the holy Ghost, which are the preludes and first beginnings of
everlasting happiness. For, as the Apostle says, The kingdom of God is not
meat and drink, but righteousness, Romans 14. 17.
and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost. It freeth us from the bondage of the
Law, which presses from us the obedience of slaves, out of servile Romans 8. 15.
fear of smart and punishment, and rest^reth us to the glorious liberty of
the sons of God, yielding ingen^ous and voluntary obedience, out of mere
love to our heavenly Father. It takes away all painfulnesse and
displeasantnesse in yeeldin^ ^eruice unto God, by taking away Legal fear,
which (as the Apo^^le says) has torment, 1. Ioh. 4. 18.
and makes Christ's yoke easy, and his bur^hen light, when we feel his
promise accomplished of giving unto our souls this spiritual rest. Matthew. 11.
29.
It preserves us from all iniquity, especially from speaking lies, which is a
base vice grounded on servile fear, either of losing some benefit, or
sustayning some evil or inconvenience, by incurring man's displeasure in
speaking truth. From which fear, Christian security freeing us, does also
keep us from the vice of lying, which is the effect of it. According to that
of the Prophet, The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies,
neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their ^^^. 3. 13.
mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. It
makes us also with more constancy and patience, to endure afflictions and all
troubles, when as we are secure of the event, and are assured that they shall
all of them advance our spiritual good and heavenly glory. It works in us
Christian courage and resolution, in resisting all the assaults of the enemies
of our salvation, when a securely resting upon God his wisdom, power, and
providence, we are assured for the present, that they shall not be able by
all their might and malice to do us any hurt, and that the issue of this
spiritual warfare will be our victory here, and our triumph in glory in the
life to come. Finally, it causes us to be more frequent and fervent in
prayer, when as without servile fear we may approach into Gods Psalm. 145. 19.
presence, and with the liberty, boldness, and confidence of sons, make our
suits and supplications unto him, in the mediation of Jesus Christ, with
confidence that he will hear us graciously, and bountifully condescend unto
our desires. According to that of the Apostle, In whom we have boldness, or
free liberty of speaking, and access, with Ephesians. 3. 12.
confidence by the faith of him. The which he uses as an effectual argument,
to make us more frequent and diligent in performing of this duties Let us
therefore come boldly unto the Throne of grace, that we may Heb 4 16.
obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. And thus much of the
causes and effects of spiritual Security.

CHAP. III.
Of the means of spiritual Security, whereby it may be obtained, or
preserved and increased.

1 Th st ms, highly to esteem it and e i and in him.
NOw it follows in the last place, that we set down the means of obtaining
and preserving this grace of Christian security. And first, if we would
attain unto this rich gift (which makes us with joy and comfort to enjoy all
other blessings, because it secureth us of their fruition, quieteth our minds
in the midst of all dangers, comfort us against all afflictions, as a rich
treasury supplieth all our wants, and is unto us an impregnable Fort to keep
off all our spiritual enemies, and Armor of proof to beat back the darts
of their tentations) we must in our judgments esteem it according to the
worth and value, in our hearts and affections love and desire it, and so
resolve, with all care and good conscience, to endeavor in the use of all good
means whereby we may attain unto it, and preserve and cherish it when we have
gotten it. As first, if we would have the effect wrought in us, we must labor
that the causes of it may be effectual in us to this purpose. And seeing God
is the author of this excellent gift, and that rich fountain of all grace and
goodness, from which Iam. 1. 17. Matthew. 7. 7. Ioh. 16. 23.
flow these sweet and still streams of Christian security, let us beg it at
his hands by fervent prayer, who is no niggard of his gifts, but has promised
to give them plentifully to all that ask them in the name of his Son. Yea,
let us not only seek this security from him as the fountain, but ground it
on him only as the alone foundation of it. For there is nothing in our selves
or any creature, whereupon it may safely and surely rest, but only upon Gods
infinite wisdom, beholding us and all things, with all means and
oportunities to preserve us from all evil, and to confer upon us all good;
and his omnipotent power, whereby he is able to do whatsoever in his wisdom
he knows to be best; upon his all-sufficiencie, whereby he suffices us by
himself alone without all other help; his mercy and goodness, whereby he is
as willing and ready, as able to help us; and his promises and truth, which
assure us of his favor, with all the fruits of it, and that he will never
fail those who by a lively faith do rest upon them. And if we ground our
security on this immooueable Rock, then though we be never so weak in our
own strength, never so much encountered with dangers, and mightily assaulted
with our many, strong, and malicious enemies, yet may we retain our security,
notwithstanding all these difficulties, because he alone is able to support us
by his own strength, to preserve us from and in all perils, and to give us
victory over all our enemies.

. 2 The second means is, to labor to be in the number of Christ Disciples,
and of his flock.
Secondly, if we would have this Legacy of spiritual security which Christ
has left us, we must labor to be in the number of his Disciples, unto whom
alone it is bequeathed; to be sheep of his flock and fold, over whom he
watches and takes care, to protect them from all enemies, and to preserve
them from all dangers; and then we may be secure, seeing we have his promise,
that he will give unto us eternal life, that we shall never perish, and that
no man shall Ioh. 10. 28.
pluck us out of his hand. And if we have the Lord for our shepherd, then may
we with David rest securely upon his providence, assuring Psalm. 23. 1. and 34.
10.
our selves that if we live at his finding, we shall want nothing. Then may we
safely lie down in the green pastures, and be led by him by those still
waters of peace and security; yea, though he lead us into places of fear and
danger, even through the valley of the shadow of death, yet may we be secure
and fear no evil, seeing he is with us, and with his rod and staff does
comfort us. Yea, we must labor after a nearer union with Christ, and to be
espoused unto him, and then we being his Spouse, and he being our
Bridegroom, we may rest securely under his powerful protection, seeing by
the institution and law of marriage, he is bound both to defend and provide for
us; and because he that touches us, touches him; he that offers any
injury unto us, does offer it (as it were) to his own person: then may we
with the Spouse in the Canticles, sit down securely under his shadow Cant. 2.
3, 6.
with great delight, and sleep in safety, when his left hand is under our
head, and his right hand does embrace us. Or if we would be nearer unto him for
our greater safety and security, let us labor to become members of his
blessed body, united unto him by his holy Spirit and a lively faith; seeing
then there will be no place for fear, because he that touches us, touches
the apple of his eye; he that does Zach. 2. 8.
us any hurt, hurts and offers violence against his own body; and he that
seeks to pluck us from him, shall go about an impossible work, even to
pluck a member from the body of Christ, which he tenderly loves, seeing he
has all power in heaven and earth committed unto him, so as no creature is
able to prevail against him.

. 3 The third means is, that we labor to be in the Covenant of Grace.
Thirdly, if we would obtain this spiritual security, we must labor to be
within the compass of the covenant of Grace, which God has made with us in
Jesus Christ. For such only as are in the Covenant, have right unto the
Promises of Gods grace and providence, watching over them, for the endowing
them with all good, and of his power and protection to shield and defend them
from all evil. Such only have God for their Lord and King, and are the
peculiar People and Subjects of his Kingdom, over whom he has taken charge,
and received them under the safeguard of his protection. As for others, they are
strangers unto him, whom he respects not; yea, they are no better then Rebels
and Out-lawes, who have no benefit by his protection, and therefore can have in
them no true security, but may well fear with Cain, that being exiled out of
Gods presence, they shall be like Fugitives and Vagabonds upon the earth, and
that it shall come to Genesis 4. 14.
pass, that every one that finds them shall be ready to slay them. Whereas
if we have the Seal of the Covenant stamped upon us, we are thereby secured
from all evil; for when the destroying Angel is purposely sent from God to
spoil and make havoc of all, yet his commission is restrained, so as he may
not hurt those which are in the Covenant, but those only who have not the
Seal of God in their foreheads. Now the means to be in this Covenant with
God, is to perform the Apoc. 7. 3. and 9. 4.
condition of Faith, bringing forth the fruits thereof in hearty repentance
and amendment of life; which we must therefore above all things labor after,
that we may have interest in the former privileges. And because through our
frailty and infirmity, we are apt to wound and weaken our Faith by our
sins; and this shield is oftentimes shrewdly battered, with beating back the
fiery darts and bullets of Satan's tentations: And our repentance also is ready
to grow faint and languish, both in respect of our grief for sin past, and
resolution to leave and forsake it for the time to come; and so by weakening the
Covenant, not in it self, but in our apprehension, we are ready to lose our
inward peace, and to have our security disturbed with fears; therefore as we
often sin, so does it become us often to renew our Covenant with God, by
renewing the condition of Faith and Repentance, that so also with them we may
renew our security, according to that in Job; If iniquity be in thine hand,
put it far away, and let not Job 11. 14, 15, 18, 19.
wickedness dwell in thy Tabernacles. For then thou shall lift up thy face
without spot; yea, thou shall be steadfast, and shall not fear. And thou shall
be secure because there is hope; yea, thou shall dig about thee, and thou
shall take thy rest in safety. Also thou shall lie down and none shall make
thee afraid; yea, many shall make suite unto thee.

. 4 The fourth means is, to labor to have the causes of it in us. As, first,
the Spirit of adoption, and the chain of saving graces.
Fourthly, if we would have spiritual security, we must endeavor by all
means to have those causes of it in our selves, of which I have spoken. As
first, the Spirit of adoption, whereby being assured that we are Gods children
through Christ, we may securely rest upon the providence and promises of our
heavenly Father, for the providing of all things necessary, for the supplying
of all our wants, preservation from all dangers, and protection from all
enemies. For if earthly Parents, according to their power, perform all these
things to their children, so as they are secure and without fear, when they
are in the sight and presence of their able friends; how much more will our
heavenly Father, who infinitely exceeds them in power and love? For if he be so
infinitely gracious, that he preserves those which are strangers unto him, how
much more those who are of his own Family? if he does good unto all, how much
more those who are of the Matthew. 5. 45. Gal. 6. 10.
household of Faith? if he provides for the young Lions and Ravens that call
upon them, and richly clotheth the Lillies and Flowers of Matthew. 6. 26. 30.
the Field, how much more will he defend and preserve, feed and clothe his
own Children, whom he has loved so deerly, that he Romans 8. 32.
has not spared to give his best beloved and only begotten Son to the death
for their redemption and salvation? So also we must labor after the gifts and
graces of the Spirit, which have the promises of Gods protection made unto
them; so that if we have them, we may be secure in his help and assistance,
because if he be with us, it mattereth Romans 8 31.
not who oppose against us; if we are destitute of them, then being hopeless
and helpless, there is no place for peace and security. Again, these saving
graces are the only means whereby we may make our Calling and Election sure;
which if we do, no worldly thing can 2. Pet. 1. 10.
disturb our peace, or dampe our joy; but if for want of them we want also
this assurance, how can we have any room in our hearts for security to lodge
in, seeing they are wholly taken up with fears and doubtings? or at least with
carnal security which keeps all quiet, because it shuts our eyes, and
benummeth all our senses, so as we cannot see nor feel our danger? Finally,
these virtues and spiritual graces are our Christian armor, which being
buckled unto us, is of high proof, to preserve us in safety against all
assaults of enemies, that would disturb our peace; but if they be wanting,
then like the Israelites Exodus 32. 25.
we are naked, dis-armed of Gods assistance, dis-furnished of all munition and
weapons, whereby we might make any resistance against the encounters of our
spiritual enemies, and so an easy prey to be seized on, and led captive by
them.

. 5 The fifth means is, to labor to be endued with those peciall saving graces,
which are the causes of, first, knowledge and remembrance of God and his
Attributes. Secondly, A lively Faith.
More especially if we would use the means, whereby we may in joy this
Christian security, we must labor to know, acknowledge and remember Gods
saving Attributes, as he exercises them toward us for our good, as his
Wisdom, Power, All-sufficiencie, Mercy, Goodness, Truth and the Rest. For
these are the foundation and ground of this security, upon which it is built
and rests; of which if we are ignorant or forgetful, it is no more possible
for this Fort of security to be erected in us; then to set up a goodly
building without a foundation, or to make it durable, if it be seated without
other support, upon the Moors or Sands. In the second place, let us labor
after a lively and justifying Faith, which is the condition of the Covenant,
upon which alone all our safety and security rests and relyeth; the alone
instrument which unites us unto Christ, and the only hand by which we receive
all Gods promises, and the fruits and benefits which do accompany them.
Finally, that impenetrable shield which repelleth all the fiery darts of
Satan, and makes us undaunted and without fear; when we are encountered with
his tentations. And therefore if we be endued with Faith, there is cause enough
why we should be secure, seeing we are in Covenant with God, and by virtue
thereof, under his protection, the members of Christ who is so armed with
power, that all the malice of the Devil and power of Hell, are not able to
vanquish or do us any hurt; and have all our vital parts covered with a
shield of proof, which cannot be pierced with all the Darts of Satan's
tentations. Thirdly, let us use all good means, to Thirdly, Affiance in God.
have our hearts comforted and confirmed, with firm affiance and confidence in
God, which is a fruit of the former grace, wherewith if we be endued, the Lord
will be the Rock of our refuge, our Sanctuary Psalm. 18. 1, 2. and 144. 2.
and Castle of strength, unto which if we flee in the time of danger, we may
enjoy safety and security. For the God in whom we trust is able to supply
all our wants, to preserve us in the day of danger, and to defeat and bring to
naught all the plots and practices of all our enemies; and if we make him our
hope and confidence, he will be our strength and tower, and he will so watch
over us with his providence, that we may sleep securely under the shadow of
his wings. Fourthly, Fourthly, Love of God.
let us seek with all earnestness, to have our hearts inflamed with that
heavenly fire of Gods love, which being but a reflection or little spark of
his divine love toward us, will be an evident sign to assure us of it. And
this love of God in us and toward us, will work in us spiritual security in
the assurance of Gods protection, who so loves us and whom we so love; and
this filial affection, when we find and feel it in us, will cast out all
servile fear, and make us bold and confident in the sense and apprehension of
his favor toward us, knowing that he who so dearly loves us is
all-sufficient in wisdom and power, to turn all things to our good, and to
make all our afflictions and tentations, our Enemies power and our own
weakness, to become helps and furtherances to our salvation. Fifthly, if we
would Fifthly, The fear of God.
have this spiritual security, we must by all means cleanse our hearts from
carnal security, and nourish in them the true fear of God. For as well may
we accord Light and Darkness, Fire and Water, Good and Evil, as spiritual
security with that which is carnal. Whereas contrariwise, the true fear of
God dwelling in us, will banish all other fears, and make us secure in those
gracious Promises, which the Lord has made unto all that fear him: as namely,
that there shall be nothing Psalm. 34. 9. and 145. 19.
wanting unto them, and that he will fulfull the desire of them that fear
him, and will hear their cry and save them. So that if they be not short in
desiring safety and security, the Lord will not be slow to grant it, or
though they should be wanting unto themselves in this regard, yet the Lord will
not be wanting unto them, seeing he is both willing and able to do exceeding
abundantly, above that we can either Ephesians. 3. 20.
ask or think. Sixthly, if we desire this security, we must labor, that
Sixthly, Christian righteousness.
we may be always found clothed with the garment of righteousness, both the
imputed righteousness of Christ applied by faith, which does perfectly free us
from all danger, and bring with it peace Romans 5. 1.
of conscience and joy in the holy Ghost; and inherent righteousness and
holiness wrought in us by virtue of Christ's death and resurrection, whereby
we are entitled unto all the promises of Gods grace and protection made unto
the righteous, and among the rest unto them especially which concern our
safety and security, of which I have before spoken. Seventhly, (which is like
unto the former) we Seventhly, New obedience.
must study and endeavor to perform unto God, in lieu of thankfulness for
all his benefits, new obedience; not that of the Law which is impossible, but
Evangelical which is the obedience of faith: when having respect unto all Gods
Commandments we labor to walk in them with sincere and upright hearts, and
with constancy and perseverance Psalm. 119. 6.
unto the end. And if we thus seek out this old and good Ier. 6. 16.
way, it will bring us to this rest of spiritual security which we labor
after. If we take this sweet and easy yoke of Evangelical obedience, and
hating all Pharisaicall pride, learn of Christ to be meek and lowly in
heart, we have his gracious promise for it, that we shall find Matt. 11. 28,
29.
this rest for our souls. If we approve our selves to be the children of our
heavenly Father, by having his image of holiness and righteousness stamped on
us, and by yielding in all things obedience to his Will, that so we may be
acceptable in his sight, then will he give us the spirit of adoption, which
will cast out all servile fear, and give us much confidence, boldness and
security in the assurance of his love.

. 6 The sixth means, contempt of the World.
The sixth means to enjoy this spiritual security is, to cast out of our
hearts all carnal love of earthly things, and so to contemn the world and
worldly vanities, as that we can be content, if God so pleases, to leave them
as well as enjoy them. For if having our desires mortified to the world, we
have learned with the Apostle Paul, In whatsoever state we are therewith to be
content: If we know how to be Phil. 4. 12.
abased, and how to abound, and be every where, and in all things instructed,
both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need: then may
we in a great part be freed from all carnal fear, and both securely enjoy
these transitory things when God gives them, because it will not much trouble
us if it be his pleasure to take them away; and also securely want them, when
God scanteth us of them, because our desires and hopes are moderate after their
fruition. For our fears hold a proportion with our love and hope, neither can
they Defines timere, si sperare desieris. Seneca.
be little if these be great, nor contrariwise excessive and immoderate, if
these tempered and ouerruled with reason and religion. And therefore if our
hearts be weaned from the love of earthly things, then may we hold them (as
children their birds which they are weary of) in our open hands, being secure
and careless, whether they stay with us, or (as Solomon speaks) like the
Eagle betake themselves to their Pro. 23. 5.
wings and flee away. But if our affections and love be still fixed and
fastened on them, then will we be unwilling to leave them, and so always Nemo
secu^us est in his bonis que potest inuitus a^^^tere. August de lib. arbit.
in fear, lest they be taken from us. For (as one says) no man can be secure
in the fruition of that, which he is altogether unwilling to lose and forgo.

. 7 The seventh means to keep our hearts upright, and our consciences pure.
The fifth means of spiritual security is, to keep our hearts upright, and
our consciences pure and undefiled from sin; especially from such sins as
are committed, not through ignorance and infirmity, but against knowledge and
conscience. Or if we have fallen into any such, our second care must be to
arise out of them and forsake them, and to purge our consciences by bathing
them in the blood of Christ by Faith, and in the tears of unfeigned repentance.
For the Hic murus aben^us esto ni^ conscire sibi, nulla pallescere cul a Hor^t.
epist. l. 1. Epist* 1.
conscience is of the nature of the eye, it must be kept clean, and then it
will be cheerful and quiet; but if we nourish in it willingly the least sins
(as it were little Motes in our sight) it will smart and rage, and never be
quiet till they be cast out. And so long as we do thus preserve the peace of
a good conscience, we may be secure and without Exemplo quodcu^que malo

fear, because we have also peace with God, For if our heart condemn us not,
then have we confidence toward. God (as the Apostle speaks) and whatsoever
we ask we receive of him, because we keep his Commandments, and do those
things which are pleasing in his sight. But if our heart condemn us (then will
not God acquit us) for he is greater then our heart, and knows all things.
So that only the pure conscience can be the secure conscience; for sin is
the only cause of fear, and therefore if i^ be purged away, there is no place
for fear to lodge in. But if sin remain and defile the heart and
conscience, there is no 1. Ioh. 4. 20, 21.
room for security; for how can a man be secure, that by guilt of sin is
liable to Gods displeasure, and has broken the peace with him? Quid prodest
recondere se and oculos hominum a^resque vitare? bona conscientia turbam
aduocat, mala etiam in solitudine anxia atque sollicita est: si honesta sunt
quae facis, omnes sciant. Si turpia, quid refert neminem scire, cum tuscias? O
te miserum si contemn^^ hunc testem. Senec. Epist. 43. Socrates interrega^us

how can he not be full of fear, that is daily in danger to be attached with
his judgments; and to bear the deserved punishment of his sin? And this the
Heathens saw by the light of nature, namely, that Guilt and Fear, Innocence
and Security, like inseparable companions accompany one another. For one
being asked who they were that lived securely, answered, They only who were
not conscious unto themselves of any evil. And another affirms, that it is a
great portion of security to do nothing unjustly; in which regard men of
might lead a life confused and disturbed, because look how much they hurt, and
so much also they fear. For though a man may be safe for the present, having
an evil conscience, yet he can never be secure; and though when he sins
he be not taken with the manner, yet he is always in fear of being taken. He
is troubled in his sleep, and whilst any man's wickedness is spoken of, he
thinks of his own; and though the guilty may have the hap to be hid, yet
cannot they have the confidence of it.

estates.
The last means of security is, to keep a narrow watch over all our ways,
and often to examine our estates, and to cast up our accounts between God and
us, and when we find that we are cast behind hand, to plead Christ's payment by
a lively Faith, that so we may get our Quietus est, and have the Handwriting
of the Law cancelled and nailed to his Cross. For this security is not caused
like that which is carnal, by negligence and sloth, but by care and
watchfulness; For then may we securely expect our summons to come to Gods
Audit, when like the wise Steward we find the Book of our reckonings just and
straight. Then may we with much peace and cheerfulness be called to give up
our accounts, when we find, that we have profitably employed our Masters
talents, and have increased them five or ten fold, by putting them out to the
use of our Lord; that is, the advancement of his glory, and good of our fellow
servants. Then may we with the wise Virgins securely expect the coming of our
Bridegroom, though through natural heaviness, we be sometimes overtaken with
drowsinesse, and take a nap, if we do in our usual course stand upon our
watch, and have the Lamps of a Christian profession, replenished and trimmed
with the inward oil of Faith, and all other saving Graces, and the outward
light of good works and a godly and righteous life; seeing when he comes we
shall enter with him into the bridal Chamber, and there solace our selves in
his love, and in the fruition of those inestimable and eternal joys which he
has prepared for us; the which he grant unto us, that has deerly bought them
for us, Jesus Christ the Righteous; to whom with the Father and the holy
Spirit, three Persons, and one Immortal, Invisible, only wise and infinitely
good God, be ascribed al glory and praise, power, majesty and dominion, both
now and for ever more.

AMEN.
Trin-vni Deo gloria.
