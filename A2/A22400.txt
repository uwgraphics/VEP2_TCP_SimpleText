DIEV ET MON DROIT. royal English blazon or coat of arms By the King. A
Proclamation for restraint of killing, dressing, and eating of Flesh in Lent,
or on Fish days, appointed by the Law, to be hereafter strictly observed by
all sorts of people.
WHereas diverse good Laws and Statutes, have heretofore, with great care and
providence been made and enacted for the due observation of Lent, and other
days appointed for Fish days, as well for the sparing and increase of Flesh
victual, as for the maintenance of the Navy and Shipping of this Realm, by
the encouragement of Fishermen to go to the Seas for the taking of Fish; which
Laws, and politic Constitutions, have from time to time been seconded and
quickened by sundry Proclamations, and other Acts and Ordinances of State in
the times of Our Royal Predecessors; And whereas, notwithstanding so many good
provisions heretofore had and made in that kind, We have observed, that the
inordinate liberty usually taken by all sorts of people, to kill, dress and
eat Flesh in the Lent season, and on other days and times prohibited, is
become so inueterate an evil, that it will require more then ordinary care to
suppress the same.

We therefore, much affecting the reformation of so great and growing an
evil, which is so great an enemy to the plenty of this Our Kingdom, Have
thought fit thus timely, (the better to take away all pretenses of excuse) to
express Our self and Our Royal Commandment in this behalf: Whereof without
future declaration of Our pleasure in this kind, We shall expect, and do
require from all Our Subjects, that due notice be taken, and that a strict and
continued obedience and conformity be yielded thereunto, both for the present,
and in all succeding times.

And therefore We do straightly charge and command all and every person and
persons whatsoever, to whom it may appertain, carefully to provide and see,
that these Orders following may be duly observed and put in execution, upon
pain of Our high displeasure, and such penalties, as by the Laws of this Our
Realm may be inflicted upon the Offenders, for their contempt or neglect of Us
and Our Laws, whereof We shall show Our Self most sensible.

And first, whereas we find, that the chiefest cause of these disorders has
grown from the Licenses that have been granted to Butchers, to kill and utter
Flesh contrary to Law, And that by Our Laws, no Mayor, Justice of Peace, or
other person of what degree or quality soever, can grant any License in this
kind; And that the Lords and others of Our Privy Council, do by Our
direction forbear to grant the same, or give way thereunto; Our will and
pleasure is, upon the penalties provided by Law, and such further punishment to
be inflicted upon the offenders, as shall be thought meet, that no such
License shall be granted for the killing or uttering of Flesh; And, that no
Butcher, or other person whatsoever, do by color thereof, kill, utter, or put
to sale any Flesh contrary to the Laws established and provided in that
behalf.

And for the avoiding of such inconveniences hereafter, Our will and pleasure
is, That the Lord Mayor of Our City of London, and every other Officer and
Justice of Peace, shall call before them, and send for any of the servants of
any Inholders, Victualers, Cooks, Alehousekeepers, Tauerners, and keepers of
Ordinary tables, and such others that utter Victuals, and to examine them upon
their corporal Oaths, what Flesh is, or has been during the Lent season, or
other days prohibited by the Law, dressed, killed, uttered, oreaten in their
houses, which if they shall refuse to do, then to commit to prison the said
servants so refusing upon their Oaths to declare the truth.

That the Lord Mayor shall also yearly before Lent, or at the beginning
thereof cause all Inholders, keepers of Ordinary tables, Victuallers,
Alehouse-keepers, and Tauerners within the City and Liberties thereof, to
appear before him, or such persons as he shall appoint meet for that purpose;
And shall take Recognizances with sufficient Sureties of every of them in good
sums of money, (viz.) One hundred pounds of the Principal, and their Sureties
thirty pounds apiece, to Our use, not to dress any Flesh in their houses in
the Lent time, or at other times prohibited, for any respect, nor suffer it to
be eaten contrary to Law. The like Recognizance with Sureties, shall be taken of
the like parties upon like penalties, by the Justices of peace of Our City of
Westminster, and the Liberties thereof, and every of the said Recognizances to
be certified into Our Exchequer.

And for the Butchers, and others that come with Victual or Flesh out of the
Country into the City, Our pleasure is, That the Lord Mayor shall cause
certain persons to watch at the Gates and other like places in the Suburbs,
where Flesh may be brought, to view and search, and to intercept the same: And
if any of those watchmen shall be found negligent and corrupt in his Charge,
then he to be committed to prison during the whole Lent.

And to the end that Fishermen may employ themselves to Sea with better
encouragement then heretofore, and that the Fishmongers may furnish themselves
with such store from time to time hereafter, as shall be expedient, as well for
the provision of the City, as for selling the same at reasonable Rates; We will
that they take notice of this Our Commandment, and constant resolution for
observance of Lent, and Fish-dayes, both now and hereafter, as by Law is
required.

And furthermore, as We think it fit, that every man should be a rule of
order and abstinence in his own house, as well in respect of the public, as
of his private ease and benefit: So We straightly charge and command all
Inholders, keepers of Ordinary tables, Victuallers, Alchouse-keepers, and
Tauerners, not to make any Supper for any person or persons whatsoever, upon
Friday nights, either in Lent or out of Lent; nor to suffer any meat to be
then dressed, uttered, sold or eaten in their houses, upon pain of such
punishment, as is due to those that shall contemn Our Royal pleasure and
Commandment.

And forasmuch as upon further advice and consideration had, that the restraint
of killing and dressing of Flesh is no sufficient remedy for the mischief,
unless there be better care also taken to suppress the unlawful and
inordinate eating of Flesh in the time of Lent, and on other days and times
prohibited, wherewith Our Subjects have accustomed themselue, rather for
delicacie then for necessity; It is therefore Our Royal will and pleasure, and
accordingly We do hereby straightly prohibit and forbid all Our Subjects, of
what degree or quality soever within this Realm, to eat any manner of Flesh in
ye time of Lent, or on other days now usually observed as Fish-daies, without
aspeciall License first obtained from the Bishop of the Diocese, or such other
as by the Law have power to give License in that behalf, and according to Our
Laws in that case provided, (which We will and command shall be sparingly
granted, and in cases of necessity only) upon pain of Our high displeasure,
and to be proceeded against by Our Attorney general in Our Court of
Star Chamber as contemners of our Royal Commandment, and upon such further
penalties, as by the Laws and Statutes of Our Realm may be inflicted on
those that shall wilfully offend in this kind.

And as these Orders are to be executed in Our City of London, and places near
to the same, so it is Our express pleasure and Commandment, That Our Justices
of Peace in all Shires within their Rule, and all other Majors, Bailifes, and
chief Officers in Towns Corporate, or in any Liberties within their Precincts,
shall cause the same to be observed and performed in like manner; and that no
manner of Toleration, Favor, or Conniuencie be used by any Justice of Peace, or
other Officer, contrary to the true meaning of this Our Proclamation, as both
they that shall presume wittingly so to tolerate the offense, as also the party
himself offending, will answer the same at their uttermost perils: Our
Commandment being, That Our Laws in this case shall be hereafter severely
executed upon all Offenders whatsoever:

Further charging and commanding the Lord Mayor of Our City of London, the
Justices of Assise in their several Circuits, the Majors and the chief
Officers of all other Cities and Towns corporate, Justices of Peace, Lords of
Liberties, and all other Officers and ministers within the several Counties of
this Our Realm, that they and every of them fully obey this Our pleasure, and
cause and compel the same to be obeyed and executed by others, as they will
answer the contrary at their uttermost perils.

And for the due execution of the prenusses in all other the Counties of this
Our Realm, as well as in Our Cities of London and Westminster, We do hereby
straightly charge and command all Our Justices of Peace within the same Counties,
as well within Liberties as without, That yearly, and every year hereafter
before Lent, they cause to come and appear before them, all Inholders, Cooks,
Tauerners, Alehouse-keepers, Butchers, and others Vicinallers whatsoever, and
to require and take of them to Our use, several Recognizances, with Sureties,
for observation of the premises, (viz.) The Principals in ten Pounds, and
their two Sureties in five pounds apiece: And if they shall refuse or neglect
to enter into such Recognizances, then the said Justices shall suppress such
persons so refusing, from victualling any more, and shall also cause them
forthwith to become bound by Recognizance with Sureties to Our use, (viz.) The
Principals in twenty pounds, and their two Sureties in ten pounds apiece, not
to victual, or sell Beer or Ale from thencefoorth; which if they shall refuse
to do, then the said Justices to commit to prison all such persons so refusing
to enter into such Recognizances, until they shall submit themselves, and
become bound, as aforesaid. And further, for all such Inholders, Cooks,
Tauerners, Alehouse keepers, Butchers and other Victuallers, as shall not
appear before the said Justices, as aforesaid, That they may immediately send
forth their warrants, or grant Process against them, and every of them so
making default, to appear and answer their contempt at the next general
Sessions of the Peace.

And further, for the more due punishment of Inholders, keepers of Ordinary
tables, Cooks, Butchers, Victuallers, Alehouse-keepers, Tauerners, and such
like, who shall forfeit their Recognizances by killing or dressing of Flesh, or
suffering it to be eaten in their houses in the Lent time, and other
Fish-dayes; And to the end that the same may be as well taken in due form of
Law, as duly certified into Our Exchequer, We do will and require all
Justices of Peace, as well within Liberties as without, That at such times as
they shall mere within their several Divisions, for the taking of such
Recognizances, that they give notice to the Clerks of the Peace, or their
deputies, to attend them for that purpose. Of whom we will require a strict
account for the Legal taking and returning of the same Recognizan^es into Our
said Exchequer: The said Clerks of the Peace and their Deputies, taking for
the making and certifying of the same Recognizances of all Inkeepers,
Tauerners, Cooks, and Butchers, the Fee of two shillings six pence, and of
all Alehouse keepers the Fee of twelve pence, as is limited to be taken by the
Clerk of the Peace for Our County of Middlesex for every such Recognizance,
and no more.

And lastly, for that the Fishmongers (upon the observation of the aforesaid
Orders) may perhaps take occasion thereby, to inhance the prices, as well of
Fresh, as of Seafish, We do therefore hereby further charge and command all
Fishmongers whatsoever, That they sell and utter their Fish at moderate and
usual rates and prices; And that all Justices of Peace, Majors, Bailiffes, and
other our Officers, as well within Liberties as without, to whom it shall
appertain, shall from time to time take such order with the said Fishmongers,
that Our Subjects be not grieved by any such enhancement or increase of prices
upon Fish, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such further punishment as
may be inflicted upon them by Our Laws.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the fourteenth day of January, in the first
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
