HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT royal blazon of the House of
Stuart
By the King. A Proclamation prohibiting the Importation of Allome, and the
buying and spending thereof in any His MAJESTY'S Dominions.
WHereas that great and commendable Work of making Allome, of the Native Mines
of this Our Kingdom, not many years since discovered within Our County of
York, is by the disbursements and expense of sundry great sums of money,
made by Our most dear and Royal Father, King James, of blessed memory,
brought to such perfection, as there is now no doubt or question, but
sufficient quantities of good, well roached, and merchantable Allome may be
made, as well for supply of Our own Dominions, of so necessary and useful a
Commodity, as also for foreign vent and sale of great quantities thereof into
other neighbor Kingdoms; which being a Work of so great honor to this
Kingdom, and of such use and consequence, for the public service, and good
of this Commonwealth, whereby many families of Our loving Subjects are kept and
maintained in work, much treasure saved within the Land, which was heretofore
yearly exported, for furnishing of Allome from foreign parts, and some
increase also brought to Our annual Revenues, toward the said excessive
charge and expense, which Our said dear Father was put unto about it: We have
thought fit (with the advice of Our Privy Council) by all honorable and
lawful means, to uphold and maintain the same; which can by no means be
done, unless the Importation of Allome from foreign parts, and the use
thereof here, when it shall be brought in, be carefully restrained, and the
many sleights, frauds, and devices, heretofore used therein, be met withal and
prevented.

We therefore do by this Our Proclamation straightly charge and command, That
no foreign Allome be hereafter imported, or brought into, or bought, sold,
uttered, or spent within this Our Realm, or any other Our Dominions, and that
no English Allome, that has been, or shall be once exported, or shipped in any
Boat or Vessel to be transported, shall at any time after be bought, sold,
uttered or spent within this Our Realm of England: And that no person or
persons whatsoever, either Our own natural borne Subjects, or Denizens, or
Strangers, Merchants, Mariners, Artificers, or others, nor any of them, do
attempt hereafter to import, buy, sell, or vent, or cause to be imported,
bought, sold, or vented any such foreign or English Allome so prohibited, upon
pain of forfeiture of all such Allome so imported, bought, sold, or vented,
to be seized to Our use, and upon such further penalties and punishments, as
We, or Our Privy Council, or Our Treasurer of England, for the time being,
shall think fit to inflict upon every such offender.

And for the better finding out, and discovery of the said offenders, We do
hereby require and command, That Our said Treasurer, Chancellor, and Barons of
the Exchequer for the time being, shall, and do award, such, and so many
Commissions, of such and the like tenor and effect, as in the time of Our said
dear Father, were accustomed, or might be awarded, or otherwise, as they
shall think fit, for examining and finding out of all offenses and offenders
against this Our Proclamation; To the end, That as well the Importers of al such
Allome prohibited, as the Buyers, Sellers, Spenders, and Receivers thereof, may
receive condign punishment for the same.

And whereas We understand, That diverse great quantities of such prohibited
Allome have used to be imported into this Realm, under the name or names of
sundry poor Mariners, and others, men of little or no value; We will and
command, That not only the said Mariners, or others, who shall so import, or
color the Importation of such prohibited Allome, shall be punished, as their
misdemeanors therein shall deserve; But also, That the Ship, Boat, or
Vessel wherein any such Allome shall be imported, or out of which any such
Allome shall be unshipped, or laid on land, contrary to this Our Proclamation,
shall be arrested and stayed by the officers of every Port, respectively,
until the Master, or Owner thereof, shall cause the full value of the Allome
so imported, unshipped, or laid on land, to be duly paid, and answered to the
hands of Our Agent, or Agents for Our said Allome Works for the time being, to
Our use, or to such others, as they shall appoint in that behalf.

And We do further straightly charge and command, All and singular such person
or persons, as shall hereafter seize any Allome, by this Proclamation
prohibited to be imported, bought, sold, used or disposed of, That they do
forthwith deliver the same to Our said Agent, or Agents in London: And for the
better encouragement of such as shall find out, and discover the offenders and
offenses, to be committed against the tenor and true meaning of this Our
Proclamation, Our will and pleasure is, That Our Agent or Agents, shall allow
to him or them, who shall discover and seize any such prohibited Allome, the
full sum of nine shillings for every hundred weight, and after the rate for
every lesser or greater quantity, that shall be so seized and brought unto the
said Agents, or one of them; And for all such Allome as shall be shifted away,
and not seized, for which offense the full value thereof is to be forfeited to
Our use, and paid to the hands of Our said Agent or Agents, as aforesaid, The
one moity thereof shall be to the discouerer, who shall prosecute and recover
the same, and the other moity to remain to Our said Agent or Agents, to be
disposed of, as in their Letters Patents of Agencie is ordered and appointed.

And We do further charge and command, All and singular the Officers of Our
Customs within all and every the Ports and Havens of Our said Dominions, and
the Creekes and members thereof, That they, and every of them, do not only
forbear to take any Entry or Entries, or give any Bill or Warrant for vnlading
or landing of any Allome prohibited as aforesaid, but do also cause Seizure
and stay to be made thereof to Our use, upon pain of forfeiture of his or
their Offices respectively, and undergoing Our heavy displeasure, and such
other punishments, as their neglects and contempts herein shall be found to
demerit.

And for the better execution of the premises, We do straightly charge and
command all Majors, Shiriffes, Justices of Peace, Constables, headboroughs,
Tything-men, and all other Our Officers and Ministers, as well of Our Admiralty,
as otherwise, and all other Our loving Subjects, to whom it shall or may
appertain, That they, and every of them, at all times hereafter, and from time
to time, be ayding and assisting to Our said Agent and Agents, and their
deputies, and to such Our Commissioners, as shall be from time to time
appointed for, or about this Our Service; And also to be, from time to time,
likewise ayding and assisting to all Our Customers, Searchers, Waiters, and all
other person or persons thereunto deputed by Our said Agent or Agents, in, or
for the seizing, searching for, or carrying away of all such prohibited Allome,
imported or landed, or hereafter to be imported, landed, bought, sold, vented,
or disposed, contrary to this Our Royal prohibition and commandment: And if
any person or persons shall be found openly to oppose, or privately to
animate, or encourage others to contradict or withstand the due execution of
this Our Service, That then Our said Treasurer of England, or Chancellor of
Our Exchequer, for the time being, shall cause such person and persons to be
sent for by a Messenger, and brought before Our Privy Council, or themselves,
or the one of them, to receive such condign punishment therein, as shall be
thought meet to be inflicted upon him or them, for his or their wilful
contempt and disobedience in this behalf.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the thirteenth day of April, in the first
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
