A Proclamation for preventing of Deceit used in the Importation of Madder.
WHereas the true workmanship of Manufactures in every Nation does preserve not
only the worth, but also the esteem thereof, to the great avail and profit
of that Nation. And whereas the Woollen Clothes of this Kingdom being well
and perfectly made, Dyed and dressed, are in great reputation in Foreign
Nations, and are a great addition to the wealth of this Kingdom, and the false
and deceitful Dying thereof, does much detract from their estimation. And
whereas Madder which is a Dying Stuff of principal use for laying the ground
of many several colors, is brought from Foreign parts into this Realm, the
deceitful mixture whereof with Sand and otherwise, does not only deceive the
Buyer, but does also fret the Cloth, and make the Colors defective. We
therefore upon mature advice and deliberation by Our Letters Patents Sealed
with Our Great Seal of England, bearing date at Westminster the twelfth day of
January, in the third year of Our Reign for the causes therein expressed, and
to prevent and suppress the said deceit and abuse, Did ordain and appoint
George Bedford Gentleman (who by his industry and experience had found out a
perfect way for the discovery and reformation of that abuse) to be Our Officer
by himself, or his Deputies instructed by him, to search all Madder which
should from thenceforth be imported before the same should be put to Sale, and
to discover the undue mixtures of such imported Madder, and by convenient
Marks and Descriptions by him to be invented to distinguish the same, that so
neither the Buyer should be cousened, nor the Dyer who should use the same be
abused.

Nevertheless, We find that some ill disposed persons importing Madder,
contemning Our Royal commandment in a case so much tending to the public
good, have hitherto opposed Our said Officer in the execution of the trust
committed unto him, whereby the abuses aforesaid do continue, and will
increase daily, if the same be not prevented. We therefore minding the
reformation of these deceipts, and being well satisfied of the ability of Our
said Officer to perform that service wherewith we have trusted him, for that
upon public trial made at the common Hall of the Company of Dyers of Our
City of London, he has made it appear in the presence of some of the
Officers and Ministers of Our Custom House in Our Port of London, and of the
best experienced Dyers, that he is able and ready exactly to perform his
duty, Have thought it fit in a case of this nature, by this Our Royal
Proclamation, to notify and publish Our Royal will and pleasure, touching the
searching and trying of all Madder imported, and to be imported before the same
be put to Sale. And We do hereby signify and declare to all whom it does or
may concern, That the said George Bedford is the Officer or person whom We
have authorized and appointed for the present execution of that service, by
himself, or his sufficient Deputies, according to Our said Letters Patents, to
him granted as aforesaid: And that We shall expect and do require from all
Our loving Subjects, that due notice be taken thereof, and that a strict and
continued obedience and conformity be yielded hereunto. And for the better
performing Our Royal will and pleasure herein; We do straightly charge and
command all and every person and persons whatsoever, whom it may concern,
carefully to provide and see Our Royal will and pleasure observed in the
Orders and Rules hereafter following, as they tender Our pleasure, and would
avoid the contrary at their uttermost peril.

First therefore Our Royal will and pleasure is, That all and every the
Masters of Ships or other vessel wherein Madder shall be imported, shall from
henceforth express and set down in the entry of his Ship and lading thereof
every parcel of goods in his Ship, that he or they shall know, or believe to
be Madder by that name, and no otherwise, and shall affirm the same upon his
Oath, as is used touching Entries of Goods with Our Customers, and shall
likewise give a true note in writing unto Our said Officer or his Deputy,
attending at Our Custom House for that purpose, of every parcel of Madder so
entered, and imported by him in his Ship accordingly.

That if the Owners of the said Madder or their Assigns shall not within
convenient time after the Shipper of Master has made his Entry with Our
Customers take up by Bill at sight, and present the same their Madder, and give
notice thereof unto Our said Officer, or his Deputy, to the end he may take
the same into his custody for the trial thereof; Our will and pleasure is,
That then Our Collector, Comptroller and Surueyor of Our Customs and Duties,
do by their general Warrant cause the Wayters of that Ship to take up and see
the said Madder to be weighed and laid into Our said Office, and delivered into
the safe custody of Our said Officer, by whom the said Madder being searched,
tried and Sealed, shall nevertheless be detemed and kept, until he receive
Warrant from Our aforesaid Officers of Our Customs and Duties, or their
Assigns or Deputies, that all the Custom and Duties for the same due to Us in
Our Custom House be duly paid or agreed for, and until the Fees due to Our
said Officer, and all other charge thereto happening through the Owners default
be fully satisfied and paid.

That no Porter, Carman, or other person shall presume by direction from the
Merchant, or otherwise, to lade, take, help or consent to the carrying of any
Madder from the Port, or place of landing, without Warrant from the said George
Bedford Our Officer or other Officer to be appointed by Us or of his Deputy or
Deputies for the time being. And We do hereby absolutely prohibit and forbid
all persons of what estate, degree or condition soever, directly, or
indirectly, to Buy, Sell or put to Sale, or to hide, keep, conceal, or occupy
any of the said Madder, that has not been viewed, searched, tried,
distinguished, and Sealed by Our said Officer his Deputies or Assigns, and
which has not the Seal of Our said Office and Officer thereon, upon pain of
Our high displeasure if notice be not given unto Our said Officer, before the
same be discovered. And it shall be at Our Officers choice, whether he will
search try, and Seal the said Madder at the Custom House, or for the ease and
conueniencie of the Merchants to do it at their own houses, and all Madder
there and elsewhere found by him or his Deputies to be unsealed, shall
immediately thereupon be tried, sealed, and distinguished.

That Our Grauer of Our Mynt and Seals, or any other whom Our said Officer
shall employ, shall from time to time frame and make such several Stamps and
Seals, to be engraven with Our Arms or otherwise, as he shall think fit,
always observing that the Stamps for the best sort of Madder, shall be
engraven with this word, Crop: for the second, sort, with this word Ghemeene,
and for the third and worst sort, with this word Mull. And if upon trial any
of the said Madder be found to be mixed or burdened with above two pounds of
Earth, or Sand in the hundred weight; Then shall the said Officer enter in a
Book to be kept for that purpose the weight of the Sand or Earth so mixed
therewith, and upon the Seal shall be added this word, Mixed, with a figure,
showing that the same Madder is mixed and imperfect, and showing also in what
proportion in the hundred pound weight that mixture is made, upon which side of
the Seal also shall be expressed the name of the Port or place whereinto the
said Madder was first brought, with certain Figures and Letters of Direction
unto Our said Officers Books of Register, whereof We will all Our loving
Subjects to take special notice, to the end that after they have bargained for
any parcel of the said Madder, they may by carrying or sending a Copy of that
side of the Seal unto Our Officer in that Custom House (at Custom house
time) have Certificate under his hand of the proportion of the mixture thereof,
if the Seal should be altered. According whereunto We do straightly charge and
command all persons selling Madder to make allowance and abatement, unto the
Dyers or other Buyers of such Madder, containing such undue mixture.

That all Clothiers, Dyers, and all other persons occupying Madder within this
Kingdom, shall according to the proportion of the mixture of the said Madder
with Earth or Sand, add a like quantity or proportion of good Madder in the
Dye Fat, to the end the colors therewithal dyed may be made full, good, and
without blemish or imperfection.

That the said George Bedford Our present Officer having already taken his
corporal oath for the faithful performance of Our trust, and his duty in this
behalf; Our will and pleasure is, that such Oath shall be likewise administered
unto his several Deputies, and so many of them as shall be sufficient for the
performing of this service in the several Ports of this Kingdom; And We do
hereby straightly charge and command all and singular Majors, Sheriffs, Justices
of the Peace, Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughs, Tithingmen, Customers,
Collectors, Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, Messengers, Farmors, Deputies,
and all other Our Officers, Ministers and loving Subjects whatsoever, That they
and every of them from time to time, and at all times when Our said Officer, or
his Deputies in Our name shall require them thereunto be aiding and assisting
unto the said George Bedford Our Officer, his Deputies and Assigns for the
time being, in all things in or about the accomplishment of Our Royal will and
pleasure in Our said recited Letters Patents or in the Warrants of Our high
Treasurer of England, as is hereby expressed. And that they or any of them do
not any way hinder, molest, interrupt, let, deteine, or keep Our said Officer
his Deputies or Assigns, or any, or either of them from or in the execution of
this Our Service, or any thing touching the Premises, as they tender Our
displeasure, and will avoid the same at their peril.

Lastly, that if any person of what estate, degree or condition soever, shall
hereafter offend in any part of the Premises; or shall falsify, deface, alter
or take off any of the said Seals from the Bale, Fat or other thing in which
the said Madder was first brought into this Kingdom, before the same be all
used and spent: Our will and pleasure is, That immediate notice be given
thereof unto Our Attorney General for the time being, whom We will and
require in Our behalf to prosecute and proceed against the Offenders in Our
Court of Starchamber or Exchequer-Chamber, or any other Our Courts as the cause
shall require, to the end they may receive such severe Censure and coudigne
Punishment, as by the Laws and Customs of this Kingdom, or Our Prerogative
Royal, may be inflicted on them for such their Contempt, Disobedience, and
wilful breach of Our Royal will and Commandment, and for their frauds and
abuses.

Given at Our Court at East-Greenwich, The fifteenth day of June, in the
seventh year of Our Reign.
God save the King.
