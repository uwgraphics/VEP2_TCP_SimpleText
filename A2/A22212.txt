The assaute and conquest of heaven translated out of french into english by
Thomas Paynel.

To the most high / most virtuous / and most excellent princess / the
most noble queen Mary dowager of France / daughter and sister unto the most
victorious kings of England and of France / your humble orator Thomas Paynel
prays good health and prosperity.
Saying the time and season of gostly and spiritual warr^ / that is the holy
time of lent approaches nere / and with his gostly trumpet calls every man
and woman to his standerd and place / thereto resist by hard and sharp
penance / by continual prayer and fast / by abstinence from iniquite and
voluptuous pleasure / by gyuynge of alms / and doing other charitable deeds /
our gostly ennemie the dyuell / which with out rest / by night and day / by
see and land sercheth whom he may devour: Luc. 3.
and bring to perpetual pain: Luc. 21.
I thought hit therefore very necessary and greatly expedient to invent and
find some ways and craft (specially for the unlearned people) to withstand
the forsayde disceytfull and pusant e^nemie: Tob. 4. 1. Pe. 5.
which thing this my littel book (if I be not disceiued) and so that ye reder
all though he have but small learning / diligently listen thereto / and follow
the fruitful precepts thereof / shall be with few words so instructed / and
so strongly armed / that he shall quickly perceive him self to be invincible
/ and of habilite to fight / also (by goddis grace) to withstand his enemy
and obtain victory. This kind of spiritual war is nothing like the warr^
of this world. In this spiritual warr^ (if we will) be hit never so tedious /
we be ever Sap^. 7
more sure of victory / of good name and fame / and by continuance / of joy
everlasting. Which joy and perpetual pleasure they that ensue your wise
dome / your good and virtuous disposition / do highlyer esteem than any worldly
richesse / which worldly things be ever more as fletynge / as celestial be
steadfast. O than what a difference is this / yea what a pleasure to be sure of
victory and there with joy everlasting? And because I have considered / that
your virtuous living / your continuance in goodness / and perfect love to the
co^munaltie / may besides the goodly and me dicinable precepts of this book /
the sooner provoke the people to follow goddis co^mandementes / to leave their
vicious living / and to arm and prepare them self to withstand the
maliciousnes of our myghtifull and horrible e^nemy the dyuell: after I had
long ymagined / I utterly determined to dedicate this my rude tra^slacion to
your grace: that if neither for goddis sake / nor by means of this book they
will not refrain from vice / yet they redynge your name / and remembrynge your
virtuous disposytion / your clean life and chastity / shall be the redyer to hate
ill and ensewe virtue / the prompter to forsake vanishynge pleasure / to enjoy
parpetual: To. 12.
and so either folowinge Christis standerde / that is Christis precepts /
orels the clean and pure life of some good christen woman / that is of your
grace / they shall at the last victoriously opteyne (by goddis grace) the
crown and glory of heaven. For truly who so will opteyne victory and the
favor of god / and perceive the feats of this spiritual war / he must
leave all vicious living and grondly observe goddis commandments / and
follow virtue. Mat. 19
For as vice is distroyer of all things / so virtue in this field / as in all
other causes is chief governor and maistres. Mar. 10
And to them parauenture that shall maruayle / wherefore I have dedicated this
my book unto your excellence / rather than to any other man / I say that I can
not parceyue / but that women and specially in this goostly war / yea or in
any other / may and have given to every creature both spiritual and
temporal instructions and right great learning. What instruction and example
of virtue gave to all Christen people the noble warrior saynct Catharine? The
invincible martyr saynct Margaret? The hardy champion saint Barbara? The wise
captain saint Vrsula / with such other? And how strongly warred (I speak of
pagannes) Just. li. 2.
Penthasilea / queen of Amazons? Prop. li. 3.
Cleopatra queen of Egypt? Cannubula queen of Volscorum? Verg. li. 7
And Hasbites? With such other noble women? Sil. lib. 1.
What hunger / what thyrste / what heat / and what cold enduredde they for a
lyttel vain glory of this wretched world? If they than for these worldly
vanites / so wauerynge / so inconstant / and so caduke / suffered with good will
and gladly / all heaviness / all pains / and all sorrow: What labor and
travail should be grievous yea or seem pain full to us Christis soudiours and
servants to conquer virtue to follow goddis co^mandementes / and to enjoy /
joy everlasting? Considering than / that this war for man's soul health
is very necessary and wholesome / I pray and exhort each one to read this
little treatise / containing the armor thereof / and grondly to follow and
continue in the profitable exhortacions of the same. For why to read only and
not to practice that thou haste read / is nothing. So it may be read and
followed / that for vice man shall opteyne virtue / and after the calamite and
wretchedness of this miserable world / perpetual joy and pleasure. Thus I
commend me your daily orator to your excellence / desirynge your grace
favorably to accept this my small book.

REgnum cesorum vim patitur. Matt. xi. The kingdom of heaven must be got by
strength. Considering than that heaven must be conquered by force / labor /
peyue / and by chiualry / hit is necessary for us to be armed with all pieces:
as a knight that goes either to battle / or to the assaute of any town or
castle. For hit were no wisdom to go thither unarmed / considering the
perils and dangers of imbushementes / treason / and encountrynge of our
ennemies / which watch still / and by craft and subtlety beset the way
that leads us to heaven: to rob / slay / murder / and to bring all them to
eternal damnation / that desire to enjoy the bliss of heaven / where every
man coueteth to inhabit and dwell. Of this way David says: Psalmo Cxli.
In via hac qua ambulabam abscondetunt laqueum mihi. that is to say / In the
way where I walked / they have laid snares and caltrappes / to catch and
deceive me. But where shall we find this armor? And who can inuente the
subtilte and craft to resist and withsta^de so many and so violent ennemies?
Take thou Christis armor / that is to say the holy scripture / conteyninge in
hit all virtue / the which is the armor of the soul. which we also must
use against these three ennemies / that is against the world / the flesh / and
the devil / which three never cesse to spy and deuyse how to disceyue and
attrappe our souls with sin. Iuxta illud. Mundus / caro / demonia diuersa
moue^t prelia. The world / the flesh / and the deuylles lie in imbushement to
distroye and bring to damnation all those that desire the joy everlasting.
And therefore for our sure defense / hit is convenient that we be armed with the
foresaid armor / that is with virtue. The first piece of christian armor.
The first piece of this armor is the shert of chastity / without which no
goodness can be virtuous / as saynct Gregory says in his Omelis: Nullum bonu^
est sine castitate. Chastity is likened to Bisse / which is a kind of lynen
clothe as white as snow / and it grows in the parts of Egypt and
Jerusalem. This lynen clothe er it come to his whitenes / suffers much
beatynge and wryngynge: In like manner so does chastity / er it come to the pure
perfection thereof: that is to say / hit suffers great affliction / in
resistynge the prickynges and temptacions of voluptuous and fleshely pleasure.
Also as the shert is the first vesture of every creature / so is chastity and
virginite the first and principallest virtue of al virtues. For the child
brings none othere thing with it out of the mothers womb but only
virginite. Therefore we ought greatly to love hit / and diligently keep hit. For
commonly the father and mother love much better their first fruit / than the
second or the third. Virginite is a virtue that highly pleases god and his
angels: to the which angels as says saint Hieronyme) virginite is nere of
kynrede. This virtue also is lykened to yuory / which naturally is white /
cold / and strong. So virginite and chastity is white by inocency / cold by
pureness of heart and body / strong and hardy to resist the flesshely
temptacions. Hit is also to be noted / that when yuory waxes old / hit waxes
read: So like wise chastity purely and continually kept is a very martyrdom /
as writes saint Bernarde and saint Hieronyme. For why / To live chastely in
this mortal body is the life of an angel: that is to say it is more to live
chastely in this wretched world / than to reyse one from death to life.
Chastity also is lykened to lylies for their manyfolde propreties / the which
now I let pass for brefenes of time / and also because I have copyously written
thereof in a another treatise called the Garlande of spiritual love. But besides
that / I have written of three propreties. Lylies may not suffer to be touched or
handled: For incontinent after they be touched / be hit never so littell /
their whitenes does diminisshe / and they lose their sweet odor and savor: In
like manner as soon as chastity is never so littell unhonestly touched / hit
loses perte of the pureness and good sauoure thereof. The touching also may be
so dishonest / as by reason of vile and stynkynge pleasure / or consent / that
virginite without any recovering thereof / shall be corrupted for evermore. And
therefore we ought to keep it charely. How virginite is observed and lrepte.
But how shall we keep hit? By great and hard penance: which is lykened to
a man's doublet / the which keeps his sherete from all fylthines. For if a man
should go for the most part in his shert / he should shortly defyle it: So in
like manner he yt does not sharp and hard penance in youth and in age /
using vile and roughe vesture / and keeping well his five wits: there is no
doubt but he shall soon lose chastity. For saint Hieronyme my says: A full
bealy inflameth quickly the holle body to vile thoughts and vain pleasure.
And to the intent we may shortly use and wear the forsayde doublet joyfully /
it is requisite that hit be dyed in to purpull: that is / we must do penance
principally for goddis sake / remembrynge how he after his baptism went in
to wilderness / and there fasted.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes without meat or
drink / alone among beasts: and how for us he suffered many other labors
and smartes / as going now hither now thither preaching and teaching / and
for man endurynge many other horrible tourmentes: Showing and by that
manifesting / that without penance we can not aproche to the kingdom of
heaven. Truly if we regard and well consider the peynes that he suffered for us
/ all penance / al affliction / and all indurance (though it be never so
grievous) shall seem to us to be without grefe or pain. Therefore let us
wyllingly do penance: as well for goddis sake as satisfaccio^ of our sins /
and that we may keep clean from al vice and filthynes our fair and clean
sherte of chastity. Of these two garments the wise man says: Bissus et
purputa indument si eius. Prouet. xxxi.
By bissus is understand chastity / and by purpull the doublet of penance.
This doublet is likened to thorns / among ye which goodly lylies grow /
sufferynge no hurt by the thorns: Like wise chastity is bett kept among the
sharp thorns of contricion and penance / than among delicious pleasures of
this world. After all this we must have a peyre of scarlet hosen / tied and
fastened to the forsayde doublet with vii. points. These hosen be the
co^syderacion of the reward that the soul and the body to gyther shall receive
in ye glory of heaven / for the sharp penance they endured in this world.
The.vii. poy^tes be ye.vii. doweres / with which the soul and ye body shall be
rewarded after ye resurrection. There is no penance so sharp / but (if it be
closed in these hosen / and surely tied with these poy^tes) it shall be made
soft and light to be suffered and borne. As a man wha^ he is well trussed / is
therefore much ye lyghter: So the co^sideracion of the gift and reward /
which we look fore / makes sweet all peynes / which we suffer in this world
/ as says saint Gregory: Co^sideratio p^mii minuit vim flagelli. After all
this we must have shows garnyshed with p^cious stones called iacinctes /
which in color be like ye bright sky: yt is to say / we must order well the
feet of our soul / that is our affections with heavenly desire / couetyng to be
out of this world / and to come to the company of our lord god. Orels these
shows may be understand the good examples of holy faders / with the which
we should show our affections / that they be not wounded and hurt with the
thorns of te^ptacion and tribulation. For as says a holy doctoure: There can
be notynge so hard / but we shall suffer it easily / if we think on and
remember the good examples of holy fathers. And by this mean our affections /
which be called the feet of our soul / shall surmounte and overcome all
thorns of carnal and worldly desire / with out any wound of temptation. Of
this the prophet does remember us / saying: Hie. 2.
Prohibe pedem tuum a nuditate. Take heed (says the prophet) thou walk not
bare footed. He goth bare foted / that sets his affections on the carnal /
erthely / and slyppery things of this world: which be but earth and durte.
Such folks make their hose and shows of myer / as children do that put their
legs and feet in the myer / and say they have put on their bowtes. Such
vileness does not become kings children: for they ought to be goodlye and
gaylye showde: and to have their shows made as holy scripture declares: Can.
7.
Quam pulchri sunt gressus tui in calciamentis filia principis. O thou princis
daughter how goodlye be thy feet and well garnysshed? This pryncis daughter is
the soul of every one of them that be the children of god. Therefore we may
not walk bare footed / but we must have our affections well hosed and shoode
/ with such manner of shows as we before have recited. And that our affections
be the feet of our soul / saint Agustyne bearethe witness / saying: Verius est
anima vbi amat / quam vbi animat: The soul (says he) is more trulier there
where it loves / tha^ where hit gives life: that is to say / than in the
body. For as the body is carried from one place to an other by the foot of man:
So like wise the soul is carried by man's desires and affections. Therefore we
ought to take heed / that we have good feet / and that we play not the ass /
that al way stombleth. Such asses be they that live not after goddis law and
good reason: but suffer them self to fall in desire: and (as beastis
unreasonable) in to carnal and unhonest affections. Wherefore it is impossible
for them to find the way to paradise / which is a sharp and a strayte way.
For why / their feet / that is their affections be defiled and full of spots
/ by reason of syckenes / corruption / and fylthynesse. The leg harneis.


Also we must needs have bowtes of yronne / that is to say leg harneis: the
one of them is called strong Patience / the other Constance / patience sister:
the which keep up the soul in aduersite and tribulacion / that it stomble not
in to desperacion / or in to murmuracion. For like as the legs and knees
sustain all the deeds of the body: So patience and constance keep the soul in
her estate / taking good head / that when aduersite and tribulacion comes /
she neither fall nor stomble. Therefore we must diligently watch and labor
to opteyne this virtue Patience: and to keep hit in the grace and love of
almighty god: if we will prospere and keep well such goodness and virtues /
as god has given us: The which says in his gospel: Luc. xxi.
In pacientia vestra possidevitis animas vestras: Ye shall possess your self
and your souls / if ye have patience.

After all this we must have a coote of mayle / called Justice. The cote of
mayle.
Justice is a virtue that ascriueth to every man his own. To god / honor and
love: to man discipline and sobrenesse: and to his neighbor good love and
dilection. But we by this coote of mayle shall only take and understand the
dilection and charity that we owe to our neighbor. For as the mayles of this
coote knytte one mayle to another: So all good christen people should be joined
and knytte with the cord of charity one to an other. For as a man / when one
or two mayles are broken / is in great daungere and peril to be hurt and
wounded: So in like wise / when a man loves all his neighbors / except one
or two / he is in peril and daungere (if he so depart hence) to be
perpetually dampened. The collar and the borders of this coote of mayle / for
the most part is gylted: whereby is understand / that god ought to be the
beginning / the end / and the very cause why we love our neighbors / orelles
we shall be woundersly disceyued. Therefore our lord god said to his disciples:
Diligite inuicem / sicut dilexi vos. Love you one an other as I have loved you:
Io. xiii.
that is / love you each other purely / and for the salute and health of your
souls / and not for carnalitie / for flattering / for covetousness / orelles
for any other ill entente or ill end.

Of the bright armor. The.ii. Chaptre.
THat we may the better keep this forsayde cote of mayle / it is necessary we
have bright harnes to put upon hit. The breast plate of this harneis is the
consideration of our birth: The back piece is the Meditation of death. For
when that we grou^dly consider from whense we came / and whereof we be made and
created with in our mothers womb / that is of the sede of man and woman /
which sede is the vilest mattier that may be: I say if we consider these
things: we shall diligently take heed that we break not this coote of equite
and Justice: that is to say / we shall take heed we wrong no man / nor hate
none of our neighbors: nor yet through pride auaunce our self above all
other. In like manner when we profou^dely mark and consider our end and the
hour of our death (for undoubted we must all dye) we shall never be wounded
with the arowes or darts of adversity or tribulation: nor yet fall to sin
by impacience or murmuration. For we know surely / that death shall be the
end of our trybulation / and the beginning of our joy and consolation. And
all the troubles and aduersytes of this world / be not to be compared (as
saynct Paul says) to the glory / reward / and crown that we look fore. Non
sunt condign passiones huius temporis ad futuram gloriam / que reuelabitur in
nobis. To. 8.
Our adversaries / whether they be visible or invisible wha^ so ever they
trouble us / they do none other thing (so that we be not against hit) but only
prepare for us the crown of glory and everlasting joy. Therefore David
says: Supra dorsum mesi fabricauersit peccatores. Psalmo Cxxviii.
The sinners (says David) and mine adversaries have forged upon my back a
crown of glory. Than to the intent we be not over thrown by adversity and
tribulacion / let us take this good back piece and strong armoure / the
meditation of death. For saint Hierony me says: Facise contemnit omnia qui
cogitat semper se esse moriturum. He lightly dispiseth all things / and
wyllyngly suffers tribulacion / that ever more thinks he must dye.

Of the Vambrace. The.iii. Chap.
ALso we must have our Vambraces to defend us against the labor of this
mortal fyfe. For as it is written / anon after a man is borne / he comes to
labor and pain: Homo nascitur ad labore^. et no^ ad te quie^. Job. v.
Man is borne to labor and pain / and to no rest. Hit is necessary we
labor in this world / that we may come to the glory of heaven. But to the end
we be not ouerpressed by labor / we must have a staff to stay us by / and
somewhat to rest us on. This staff shall be the virtue of strength / which is
lykened to a rod or to a staff. For strength causes man that no labor or
pain of this mortal life may over come him: and hit gives him sustentacion
and help / joy / and consolation / as David says in his spalme: Psalm. 2
Virga tua et baculus tuus ipsa me consolata sunt. Strength is also compared
and lykened to iron / that breaks and distroyeth all thing. In like manner
the virtue of strength breaks all thing / and resists all the pains of
this mortal life / as hit appears by the holy and blessed martyrs / which
were never ouerco^men / but have had all way the victory of all their
adversaries. Of whom it is written: Mori possunt / sed fletti non possunt. The
tyrannes have power to kylle and slay the bodies of goddis friends: but they
have not the power to turn them to their will and minds.

Of the gau^telettes. The.iiii. Chap.
THan for vambraces let us take the virtue of strength: But with these
vambraces we must needs have two gauntelettes to cover our hands / that is /
Declinare a malo et facere bonum. Psalm. 30
The first is to decline from ill / and there with to flee all occasions of
sin: The second is to do well: and to seek all occasions and ways (as nere
as we may) to do well. And we must needs have both these gauntelettes: for
one without the other can not suffice.

Of the Gorget / and what it is. The fyfte Chaptre.
FOrthermore we must put on our gorgette / which is very necessary to avoid
the cuttynge of our throtes. This Gorgette is abstinence / sobrenesse / and
temperance: without the which we be in peril of death. For the scripture
says / that many moo dye by excess and surfettes / than by the sword:
Plures occidit gula quam gladius. And not only by spiritual death of the
soul / but also by corporal death of the body. For / as well nere all
phisicions and philosophers say / all corporal syckenesse / that we suffce /
comes (for the most part) by excess of meats and drynkes. For these causes
this gorgette is necessary to defend us both from spiritual and corporal
death. This gorgette serves also for an other entente. For hit keeps a man
from vain and ydell words / from detraction and hurtefull communycacyon: and
like wise from all manner of leasynges / which often times wound man to death:
and also (as saint Paul says) they cause god to dysdayne and hate man: To. ^.
Detractatores deo odibiles. God hatethe those / that backebyte their
neighbors. Sap^. ^
And the wise man says: Os quod mentitur, occidit animam: A lyenge mouth
kylleth the soul. And our lord in the gospel says: Mat. xii.
De omni verbo ocioso quod loquuti fuerint homines, reddituri sunt rationem in
die iudicii. Of all ydell words spoken of man / man at the day of judgment
shall give acco^pte. O how hard a sentence is this to many a man / ye and well
nere to all ye world? Saint James says / that he is a perfect man / which
can refrain his tongue: but there be very few that can do it. And for all that
we must needs labor to refrain hit: for both death and life is in the
hands of the tongue. Pro. xviii
Mors and vita in manibus lingue. Death / when the tongue is not well kept: Life
/ when it is kept and refrayned from ill. There is no man that can nombre the
myschiefes that come of to many indiscreet words and communicacion. Therefore
temperance is very expedyent and profitable for us / to know how we should
order and gyde this our lyttyll tongue: to the entente we displease not our
maker / nor yet hurt our neighbor: and to the end our soul be not taken by
her ennemies / which ever more and with contynuall watch / spy and search
none other wise the febleste and weakeste part of the cite of the soul / than
men of war search the febleste place of that city / which they entende to
conquer and take by force of arms. I think there is no place in man's body
more weaker than the tongue or the mouth. For if the taste of man be not well
seasoned / well temperedde / and well taken head of / hit is the food and
nourishement of lechery / and of all other fylthynesse. If the tongue be not
refrayned / hit is the occasion of anger / trouble / discord / division /
hatred / discencion / and of other ylles innumerable. Therefore we ought in this
thing to use diligence / and to purchase both sobrenesse and temperaunce. For
he ought to keep his mouth both clean and net / that daily must with god
speak.

Of the Helmet / and what it is. The syxte Chaptre.
EArther it is convenient and necessary that we put on the Helmet of health: as
saynct Paul does monysshe us / saying: Ephesians. vi.
Et galeam salutis accipite. This helmet is the fear of god / that puttethe
back all adversities and strokes: and (as saynct Paul says) is never
broken. Eccle. 1.
Timor domini expellit peccatum. The fear of god puts back all sin: and
without hit no man can be justified. Blessed is he that has this helmette upon
his heed contynually: that is to say / upon his thought: which is the heed of
the soul / as saint Gregory says. The fear of god does in like manner to
the soul / as the watch man does / that is in the tower of a castle /
which only walks up and down / lokynge and prienge out on every side / to
spy if any enemies come. And as he often times awaketh the knights and men of
arms / that be in the fortress and castle: even so does the fear of god in
the castle of the soul / which daily sturrethe up the strength and virtues
of the soul / to relyste the princypall ennemies / that will enbatayle /
fight / and let her to the vttermoste of their power / to come to the
celestial joy and pleasure of Paradise. These three enemies ben called the
world / the flesh / and the devil: which be laid in enbushementes and
companyes for to destroy all the friends of our lord Jesus Christ. This good
Helmette does bear of all thing / and all thing fearethe hit. For as the
philosopher says: Eccl. 7.
Qui timet deum, omnia timent eum. All thing fears him / that fears god.
And this Helmet is well and proprely set / in the most nobleste and highest
place of man's body. And there / where the five corporal wits have
principally their vigure and place. For the fear of god is like a strong
vssher or porter / the which keeps the five gates of our five wits: and the
secret wyckette of our heart. And because ^^e fear of god must sometime
watch and at on^^ at all these five gates / hit is necessary hit have some
help. The help shall be long provision / which is lykened to the visour of
the helmette / where in be many small holes: by the which he sees here and
there. And also he lyfteth hit up and puts hit down at his pleasure. So
it is by provision: For prouysion has many thoughts and subtle
considerations: by the which it sees and perceyueth long before the
aduersites and dangers that may chance to the soul by this or that mean or
operation / or this thought or delectacion. Prouysyon also sees long before
al disceites and embusshementes of her enemies: and shows them to this good
porter / called the fear of god / which with out delay causes all such
things / that may hurt the soul / to avoid and depart: and lettethe in
all such things / that may help the soul. Eccl. 7
For as hit is written: Qui timet deum, nihit negligit. That is to say / He
that dredeth god escheweth all ill: and does to his power / all that good is.
So we se how this Helmette is profitable to the soul / to defend the heed /
that is the heart / and the thought. But with this / it is conueniente to have
upon this Helmette a gylden creste. For we be all or should be the knights of
our lord Jesus Christ. By this gylden Crestegarnyshed with a precious stone
named Serdonique / is sygnyfied the virtue of Hope / which ought to be well
tied and pynned to this helmet that is to the Fear of god. For Hope with out
the fear of god is nothing / nor of no value. For to great fear may cast
maunes soul into despeyre: and to great hope may cast man's soul in to
pride and presu^pcion. Therefore they must be always well myngled and knytte to
gether. The foresaid precious stone has three colors: the lowest part is
black: the myddell part is white: the highest part is read. In like manner
the virtue of hope causes a man to dispreyse and little regard these vile
and worldly things / as of no value / but full of clouds and darkness. Also
hit makethe the myddell part of man / that is man's heart and body white:
that is to be chaste and without sin: showing him (if he live virtuously)
what reward and glory he shall obtain / in the celestial court of
paradise. Also hope makes a man read / that is burning in the fire of
charity and love both of god and of his neighbor. This virtue (the creste) is
very necessary for them that be in trybulacion / and in continual battle
against their enemies: and therefore it behooves us to take good head / that it
fail us not at our most need. We must also be diligent and take good head we
trust not in man: for if we do / we shall be disceyued. And they that trust in
men / be acursed by the prophet Hieremie / saying: Iere. 17*
Maledictus vir, qui confidit in homine. That man is accursed / that trustethe
in man / or in any wordlye thing / or in his strength / or in his wisdom /
or in his own merits. For he shall consume and wither away / like as the
genepre tree does in wilderness: that is to say / he shall lose and be
deprived of all the humor of grace and devotion. But he that puts his
confidence / hope / and trust in god / is only blessed / and he shall walk
without danger or peril / through the mids of his adversaries and ennemies /
until he shall come to the end of his iourneis / that is to the city of
paradise. Of which thing the prophet bears witness / saying: Qui autem
sperant in domino mu tabunt fortitudinem. assument alas vt aquile. ambulabunt
et non laborabunt. etc. Esa. 40
They that put all their confidence and hope in god / shall wax every day
stronger and stronger: and shall take wings as an egle / to flee unto the
trone of the divine majesty: they shall go without pain. For why / all pain
and afflixcion shall seem to them to be sweet and without pain / because of
the desire that they shall have to come to their intent / that is to god / and
so to eternal joy and pleasure.

Of the two edged sword. The.vii. Chaptre.
AFter all those things it is requisite / that we have our two edged sword
gyrded about us. These be the words of god: Gladius bis acutus. Of the which
sword saint Paul says: Ephesians. vi.
Et gladiu^ spu^s. quod est verbu^ dei. Take thou (says saint Paul) ye gostly
sword that is the word of god. This sword cuttethe on both sides: for it
has power to distroye and kylle both body and soul: as it is written in the
gospel. we ought (as David says) ever more to have this sword in our hand.
Psalm. 149
Et gladii ancipi tes in manibus eorum. And to what entente? Ad faciendam
vindictam in nationibus. To take vengeance upon those nations / which be
contrary to the soul. But who shall put this thing in execucion? Dame
Justice. For it is written by our lord Jesus Christ / which is the word of
god: Eterit iusticia cingusum lumborum eius. Esa. xi.
This virtue Justice is very well ordered and put about man's raynes: For hit
is the most dangerous place and wey of man's body: by the which man's soul
is most vexed and troubled: and specially by the abominable and horrible sin
of lechery. David bears wytnes / saying: Quoniam lumbi mei impleti sunt
illusionibus. Ioh. xi.
My raynes be replenyshed with illusyons / that is with flesshely desire /
thoughts / pleasures / and pollucions: which in that place have their seat
and might: as it is written in Job: Virtus eius in lumbis eius. The virtue of
the devil is in the raynes of man. For Luxure is the sin / by the which our
enemy the devil leads many a one to eternal damnation. Therefore it is
necessary that dame Justice have her seat there: and that she have always
this sharp sword in her hand / that is the word of god / to do Justice: and
to take vengeance on those that would deprive the soul of the noble and
precious treasure of Chastity. For commonly where as good and sharp Justice
is / such trewantes and such thieves dare neither sport / nor yet show them
self. And so like wise it is of man's soul: which contynually punysheth all
ill mocions / suggestions / flesshely / and worldly temptacions. And also with
this sharp sword they dymynysshe and chastise their enemies / that is their
desires / their affections / all hurtefull and intemperate cogitacions and
thoughts. For why / as soon after as she has perceived their disceytes and
their assautes / Justice takes and reherseth the word of god / and the
auctorities of holy scripture: with the which she compels all her ennemies
to recule and give back / as our lord did when the fend tempted him with
three temptacions / in the which all other are contained. Our lord answered
him nothing / but he proved it by the word of god / and by holy scripture /
comprehended in the book called Exodi. The which auctorities the dyuell could
not brook / nor yet suffer. And through the virtue of these holy words / he
was beaten back and ouerco^men / as hit had been with a sharp sword: and so
he left our lord / and departed to his own confusion. In like manner the
soul in all temptacyon must express and bring fourth the word of god:
which (as saint Paul says) is much more sharp and persynge / than any
rasoure or two edged sword: Hab. 4
Viuus est setmo dei et efficax, et penetrabilior omni gladio ancipiti. It is
than a sure thing to be always gyrded with this sword / which must hang on
our left side / by ye cord of Justice and equity / against our raynes and
our thyes: In the which two places the most dangerous and fearful
adversaries of man's soul dwell. Therefore holy scripture reherseth / that.lxxx.
of the strongest men of Israel compased king Salomons bed / which king
Solomon represents our lord Jesus Christ / which rests him self in the
devout soul of man / as the sword does in the scabarde: And each of the
forsayde mighty men had his sword upon his thygh (propter timores nocturnos)
for dread of the disceytes / and secret assautes of their ennemies / which
most commonly work by night: that is / in the night of sin / or of
ignorance. For the sin of luxure and lechery is most commonly done by night
/ in cloudy and dark places. And also between them that be married / the which
may use the course of nature without sin / so they use hit to a good intent
/ and temperately. The reason here of is / as says saint Augustine / in his
book called the Cite of god / to open and show the transgression of our fore
fathers / of whom we that be come / by the sede of man and woman / be dettours
/ and must answer therefore. The Scabarde or shethe of this sharp sword is
the heart of man / in the which the word of god ought to be / and there to
rest contynually.

Of the dagger. The viii. Chaptre.
BUt with these weapons and instruments of war we must needs have a dagger
by our side / and our hand there upon evermore: that is to say / we must put
in effect and execute the word of god / and his comau^dementes. For hit is not
inoughe to know them only / but we must put to our hands to work and
fulfill them / that is to say / we must lay our hands upon our dagger. This
thing was figured in the children of Israel / after their returning from the
captivity of Babylon / in the time of Nemee: which Nemee / with the children
of Israel / did edify and build the temple and walls of Jerusalem again.
And because their enemies were molestyous and grievous unto them / he ordained
/ that they the which labored in edifienge of the temple and walls of
Jerusalem / should have a sword in the one of their hands / and with the
other hand / they should labor.

Of the Shield. The. nynthe Chaptre.
AFter those things it is necessary for us to take the Shield of faith / as
saint Paul warns us to do: with the which we may quench / and utterly
distroye / and with stand all the darts of our ennemie the devil: which
darts be replenysshed with the fire of carnal concupiscence / of covetousness
/ of pride / and of vain glory: which.iii. be the.iii. principal darts of
our enemy. Unto which three we may apply all other / as spryngynge and
engendered of them. And like as we bear our shield on our left side: So we
ought principally to take the shield of faith in time of adversity. And that
we bear our shield on the left side of our heart / is because (as the
philosopher does say) the heart of man is between his breastis / inclinynge to
his left side. Whereby is signified that the heart of man is more enclyned to
vice than virtue / as our lord god says to Noe: Sen sus enim et cogitatio
cordis humani in malum prona sunt ab adolescentia. Genesis 8
Therefore we ought to put the shield of faith before the heart. For hit is
his propre harneys. Faith is also upon the right eye of the soul and of
reason: the which gives no judgment / but of natural things: but yet faith
iugeth not only things natural: but also such things as be above nature:
and believes that that reason can not discuss or comprehend. And as he that
has lost his right eye is not mete to be in battle: because he can not shote
right / nor se how to avoid strokes: So he that has no faith / is not mete
to be in spiritual battle. Therefore the postels desired our lord to augme^t
their faith / that so they might be able to fight against the dyuell of hell
and his soudiours. Luc. 17
Domime adauge nobis fidem. This shield in his upper part is large / and
narowe in the lower part: so faith is large in ye love of god and celestial
things: and narowe in those erthely and worldly things. This shield has.iii.
corners: And faith believes ye Trinite to be but one god. These three corners
must be garnyshed with.iii precious stones: with a Jasper / a Saphir / and a
calcidone. Jasper is grene: and when so ever any herb or plant is grene / it
is a token of life. In like manner when any man desires honest and good
manners: it is a token his heart lives by right and true faith. This precious
stone Iaspe auoydeth all fantasies and ill illusyons: True faith chaseth away
all dyuellyshe te^ptacions. The second precious stone is called a Saphir his
color is blewe / his propretie is to take a way venom / and to kill
spiders: So in like wise true faith regardethe only celestial things / and
reputeth these worldly things to be of no virtue. Faith also dryueth back
and utterly does kylle the poysonfull temptacions / and ill mocions of man's
heart: as the holy a postels have written: Act. xv
Fide purificans corda eorum. The third precious stone is called Calcidone:
which in color is very paale: whose nature and propretie is to cast back
all deed things: Like wise the true faith is pale: that is to say / by great
and sharp penance / mortifienge and avoiding deedly sin and all the
occasions of sin / hit makes man paale. If we bear and use well this shield
/ we can not be wounded with darts nor arowes visible nor invisible.

Of the Spear The. tenthe Chaptre.
BUt to the intent we want nothing necessary for this war / we must have
and bear a spear in our hand: that is / we must show good exampulles to
our neighbors / that they thereby may glorify and laud ye goodness of god: and
not because we would or yet look to be preised therefore: as our lord says in
his holy gospel: Luciat lux vestra coram hominibus, vt videant opea vestra
bona. Matt. v.
It is also to be noted / that one man should sooner hurt an other a far of
with a spear / than with a sword: So we shall sooner stere men to do and to
live well by good example / than only by good words: as a certain doctor
says: Plus mouent exempla qua^ verba. This spear must be of a great length
by perceueraunce in goodness. For hit is not enough to do well for a while /
but we must continue therein. The continuance in goodness does only cause man
to desire the crown of heaven. And they only shall be saved / that continue in
goodness / and keep goddis commandementes: as our lord says in the gospel:
Matt. x. et. xxiiii.
Qui autem perseuerauerit vsque in finem, hic saluus erit. This spear also
must be streyghte by the help and means of good intention. For who that
either lyuethe well by hypocrisy for vain glory / or any other ill intencion
/ he shall never give good buffette with this spear / because hit is crooked.
We must do good pryncypally for the love of god / for our soul health / and to
instruct our neighbors in goodness and virtue: when so ever we do hit for this
entente / than our spear is streyghte and sharp / and ready to stryke and
wound deedly / that is to say / it is ready to provoke other to goodness / and
to love god above all thing. Farther more no man may smite with this spear
with out he hold hit low / and under his right arm: nor in like case no man
may do him self good or his neighbor / except he desire that his good deeds
may be kept close: and without he do them only for goddis sake. And when we
thus shall do our good deeds: we must hold our spear under our sadylle: but god
shall lift hit up / and bring hit to light / and in to syghte of other: as
hit is written in the holy gospelle: Non potest ciuitas abscondi supra montem
posita.

Of the Coote armuur The.xi. Chaptre.
Saying we have all the devour armoure of the soul / where of we have spoken:
it is needful we speak some what of the coote armoure / which is worn upon
all other harneis: in the which also be peynted and drawn the arms of that
lord / which we fight fore. This coote armor is made after the fashion of a
cloak / set with gold / silver / precious stones / and other rich and
diverse colors. This Coote armoure is lykened to the virtue of Charity /
which is called Christis lyuery / whereby he knows all his knights and
friends / as he said to his disciples: Io. 30
In hoc cognoscent omnes, quia discipuli mei estis, si dilectione^ habueritis
adinuicem. By this thing (says our lord) men shall know you to be my
disciples / if ye love each other charitably. Charity is a virtue / the which
wills us to love god with all our hearts / with all our minds / and with all
our thoughts / and to love our neighbors as our self. But because here before
/ when we rehearsed the coote of mayie we spoke of the love that we ought to
bear to our neighbor: we will at this time speak of the love / which we
ought to have to god: the which is above all thing: and therefore let us
put hit above and upon all our other harneis. In this coote armor must be
many precious stones / and pri^cipally three / that is a Crisolite / a Berill /
and a Thopasy: the which signify that charity ought to proceed from a pure
heart and a good conscience: also from a true faith. Crisolitus is a precious
stone and a noble / sparklynge like the fire: and if ye set hit nere the fire
/ by and by hit will be all in a flame. The fire is of very pure nature and
virtue: for hit takes away the rustynes and all fylthynes from gold / silver
/ and all other metal / and makes hit bright and shynynge: So in like manner
the fire of charity remoueth from man's heart all fylthynes of sin / and
purifieth the same: and as the precious stone Crisolitus loves the fire / in
so much that hit drawethe the fire to hit / if hit be nere: So in like wise
does a pure and a clear heart / approchynge to god / which is the fire that
consumes all rustynes of sin / as Moses says: Deus tuus ignis co^sume^s
est. Deu. 4
Therefore even as soon as ye heart of man draws nere this fire / with
burning desire and fervent love / he draws to hy^ the love of god. And
therefore our lord desiringe to inflame us with this fire of charity / he came
kyndely and louyngly unto us / and receyuedde this flesshely body / and shed
his precious blood for our health and redemption: Whereby he showed manifestly /
how heartily and how ferue^tly he loved us. Therefore we must light our fire /
that is our love at his great fire / and furnace / approchynge nere thereto by
pureness of heart and body. For the wise man says / that a sou^de and a pure
heart causes man to be nere to god / and greatly in his favor. The second
precious stone is named berillus / whose color is grene / and some what pale:
hit has six corners / and sygnyfyeth that the parsone / which has charity
is always grene by good operacion and good works / which he shows to his
neighbor / by the.vi. works of mercy / the which the.vi. corners of this
precious stone sygnyfieth. The palenes thereof betokens mortifienge and
chastisinge of ye body. The.iii. stone is called thopase / which has.ii.
nobul colors: that is the color of the sky / and ye color of gold. The
color of ye sky signifies the love that we owe to god: the color of gold
signifies ye love yt we owe to our neighbor. And as this topase excedeth i^
brightness al other stones: so charity excedeth ye nobility of all other
virtues: as ye apostle says: Mayor aute^ horu^ est charitas. 1. Co. 13
And as this thopase receives and has in it self ye qualities of all other
precious stones: So Charity does and exercises the deeds of all other
virtues: as hit appears in the pistols of saynct Paul / where he says: 1.
Co. 13
Charitas patiens est. etc. And therefore a certain doctor called Prospere /
in his book of contemplacion says / that Charity is the soul of all virtues.
For as the soul gives life and strength to the five corporal wits: as
unto the ese / the sight: unto the ears / herynge: So like wise Charity
opens the eye of man's heart to the help and comfort of pour folk: his
ears to harken to goddis commandments: and his hands to do the good warkes
of mercy: and so forth of other virtues / with the which ye cloak of Charity
is garnyshed and rychely apparayled / as hit were with silver / gold /
precious stones / and other goodly and diverse colors: As our lord god says
by the prophet unto the devout soul: Esech. 10
Vestiui te discoloribus. I have clothed the with a garmente of diverse colors:
But in especial there be two colors / that is white and purpull: Pro. 30
as hit is written: Bissus et purpura indumentum eius. And as purpull shows
well upon white: so charity becomes well an inocent and a devout person. This
garment is made and wouon with the threde of grace / and of the holy gooste. It
is made also of the inward parts of our lord Jesus Christ: hit was dyed
purpull at the time of his holy passion: by the which passion he showed
manyfestly how fervently he loved us. And therefore al we be bound to love him
again as much as is possible: and to light our fire / that is our love at
the furnace of his singular love. Charity is compared to fire / as our savior
says in the holy gospel: Luc. 12
Ignem veni mi^tere in terram: And that is for many propreties / which are
ascryued to the fire. First and formoste / fire is the most virtuous of all
elements: and charity in effect is above all virtues. The fire burns and
gives light: Charity burns by sweet affection / and it gives light by good
examples. The fire ke^deleth the deed cole / and mollyfyeth the hard and cold
iron: Charity dryueth away from man the cold of covetousness / and causes
the soul (the which by reason of sin is deed) to revive. Fire turns all
thing to ashes: and Charity (by reason of humiltie) causes man to repute him
self vile / and but ashes. Fire naturallye ever more asendeth upward:
Charity is ever more occupied doing good warkes. Fire takes away the rustynes
of iron: Charity skoureth away the rust and fylthynes of sin. The fiere
casts sparkels: Charity casts up heavenly desire. The fire makes the
pot to boil and defe^deth the pot from flies: Charity causes the heart of
man to boil in devotion / and keeps hit from the dyuels / and all other
temptacions. Fire defends / that the fletermouse drynketh not the oil out of
the lamp: Charity defends / that our gostly ennemie drink not from us the
gracious oil of the holy gooste / being in the heart of man / which is called
the lamp of our soul. In this Cote armor is liuerie. In this gown of
marriage must be peynted the kings arms under whose standerd we war / that
is the arms of our lord Jesus. It his than necessary that we paynte with
letters of asure in the fore part of this armor a cross / and the name
Jesus: That is because we ought contynually to have in memory the innumerable
benefyttes / that god has done for us. And on the back side thereof we must
do peynte Christus, that we may bear in remembrance / how Christ with his
precious blood bought / redeemed / and saved us.

Of the Horse. The.xii. Chap.
ANd when we have all the foresaid harneis / and there upon this goodly Cote
armor / than are we ready to assaute the cite of Paradise / which must be
conqueredde par force: Matt. xi.
Regnum celorum vim patitur. And so we shall be strong and mighty to resyste
all our enemies that would hurt or withstand us.

But yet there is no other thing. Truly hit is not mete that a knight armed
should go on foot: wherefore he must needs have a hardy / a swefte a strong and
a well tournynge horse. His horse may not be heavy / drawing back / or
fearful. This horse is lykened to ma^s body: the which instead of a horse
we must needs use. Which also ought to be white / by clenlynes and pure
Chastity. The.iiii. horse shoos.
Farther more he must be shodde with four shows / that is with the four
pryncipall affections: which be called / love / heaviness / hope and dread:
the which must be ruled and ordered after goddis commandments: For other
wise they be fautye / and not surely set on as good horse shows ought to be.
The horse saddyll.
This horse saddyll is called the knowledge of man's fragilite / and sickness /
where unto man's nature is subject. Farther more hit is to be known / that a
knight shall never ride surely / except he know all his horses conditions: So
like wise the soul shall never govern well the body / except hit know his
disease / his complexion / his strength / and his conditions. This saddyll
must be straightly bound and gyrded with the gyrthe of examinacion of
conscience: The (...)
orelles the saddyll may turn / and cause his master to fall. The poytrell
of this horse betokens the remembrance of death / and knowledge of the vilany
and filthynesse of the body. The poytrell.
The croper sygnifyeth confession of our sins. The crop.
For as the horse auoideth his dounge and fylthynesse behind: So the soul by
great humylite and devout confession auoydeth her sin. And as the poytrell
and the croper keep the sadyll fast upon the horse from falling: So in like
manner the remembrauuce of death / and humble confession of sin / makethe a
man to know him self. The first steroppe.
The first steroppe is humylitie in prosperity / the which by continuance
is long enough: For it is great pain to ride with short steroppes: and so
like wise / if we do not continue in goodness / all that we do is naught / and
to none effect. The second steroppe.
The second steroppe is patience in aduersytie: which is very necessary to
hold fast man's soul upon the sadyll / from falling or tournynge. Of this
patience saint Paul says: Patientia enim vobis necessaria est. Hit is
conuenyent also that this horse be brydled / and so to lead him at our
pleasure: Heb. 10
that is to say / we must needs chastise our body: that it rebelle not
against the soul. We must also take heed / that this horse overthrow not
his master: that is that the body distroye not the soul: bearing away the
soul as him lusts to corporal plesures and voluptyes. But yet we must not
so rigorously and with so great pain use hit / that hit should not be able to
go. Therefore hit is conuenyent to lead him by the rain of Discrecion. For
discrecion is a virtue / the which without fautynge leads a man to the
right way / inclynynge or wauerynge no more on the one side than on the
another / but keeping hit self well / gothe fourth still on in the kings high
way: which is both virtuous and also profitable. When this horse is trapped
apparayled and garnyshed after the manner before said: we must mou^te and leap
up upon his back / and so learn to gide and govern him with the brydell of
wisdom and rain of discrecion / that is to know the ready way which we
ought to keep / and the paths that lead us to the Cite of Paradise.

Of the spourres. The.xiii. Chap.
BVter we begin to learn and to lead this horse / it is necessary we put on
our gylte spourres / to quycken him / if he be to slow / to full of praunsynge
/ or to fyerce. One of the spourres is called esperance / and hope of the
glory and felycite / that they shall have / which in this world do penance
for their sins. The other spoure is called fear of damnacion. It is also
very necessary that these spoures be gylted: For what so ever we do / it must
be done for goddis sake. And that this seruyable fear turn him self to
chyldysshe fear: and that is when men specially forbear to do ill / for dread
lest by their misdeeds / they should provoke the wrath of god. And so like
wise of hope. Under this manner before said / these spoures must be gylted: and
so they shall cause our horse to be hardy / quiver / light / and ready at will.
Now than let us ride and so handell our self / that our soul be always
master. Let us also lay siege to the cite of Paradise. But above all other
prouysion hit is very needful / that we carye vitayle with us: orels we may
famysshe and dye for lack of sustinaunce. We must needs have breadde: For we
have yet a long journey to go: as the angel said to the prophet Helie:
Grandis enim tibi restat via. And what thing shall this breadde be? Truly the
word of god: with the which the soul of man is made satte / as David says:
Sicut adipe et pinguedine repleatur anima mea. Psalm. lxii Psalm. Liii.
And again: Panis cor hominis confirmet. Breadde comfort man's heart: and
the word of god does comfort and causes man's soul to live: and with out
this breadde no man may live long. Therefore our lord says: Luc. 4.
Non in solo pane viuit homo. A man lives not only by breadde / but by the
word that proceeds from the mouth of god. Saint Augustine says: As man's
flesh is after he has fasted / so is the soul that is not fed contynually
with the word of god. Let us than take this breadde and bear hit with us in
our mawe / or in the bynne of our heart and memory hanging from our neck /
and descendynge to the side of our heart: that is / that we have always the
word of god in our mouth and heart / swetely chawynge hit: and we shall find
therein great comfort and great sweetness. Let us also carye wine with us /
that we may thereby more comforttably and meryly suffer the pain of so long a
journey. This wine is called spiritual joy / and witness of good conscience:
which always reioyseth man's heart. Of the which wine David says: Et vinum
letificet cor hominis. Psalm. Liii.
When we have all the foresaid things / than may we stoutely walk Vsque ad
montem dei Jacob, unto the cite of Jerusalem / that is to Paradise. But now
what way shall we take / that we err not in our journey? Truly the way of
goddis commandments: Of the which David speaks: psalm. 11^
Viam mandatorum tuorum cucutti, quum dilatasti cor meum. O lord god (says
David) I run by the way of thy commandments / after that you had
enlarged mine heart with thy love and charity. These ways be goodly and honest
/ as we read in the book of wisdom: pro. 3
Die ems vie pulchre. But yet for all that the bie paths (though they be
strayter) be more pesible / and much more shorter. These bye paths be called
the counsayles of the holy gospel: as to keep virginite / to forsake the
world / and all other erthly things / as to much affection and love of our
friends / with other like / the which religious men should keep / that they
might so the sooner come to this cite of Paradise: and also to avoid the
danger of thieves / which most commonly lie lurkynge by the high ways side.
Of these bye paths and foot paths speaks the wise man: Etomnes semite eius
pacifice: Pr^. 3
Let us therefore go and ride hastyly as long as hit is day / lest the night
come suddenly upon us / that is lest death come suddenly upon us: for than we
can go no more. Therefore our lord said to his disciples: Ambulate, dum lucem
habetis, ne tenebre vos comprehendant. Io. 1^
Go you (says our lord) as long as ye have light / lest the darkness of
death come suddenly upon you. Therefore let us walk while we have space / and
let us run / not with the foot of our body / but of the soul / by holy
desires and good affections: And when we come nere unto the cite / let us
lay siege there unto / coueringe us with our te^tes and pauilions: that is to
say / with good examples of holy saints: Considering / how they in time
paste besieged and conquered this cite by force and violence / enduringe great
pain and labor: and at the last by the virtue of good and steadfast faith /
they overcame all pains and labors: as saint Paul says / writing to the
Hebrews: Heb. 11
Sancti per fidem vicerunt regna. Let us than besiege this cite / and let us
assault it on every side / and specially on that side / on which we think
sooneste to get hit. This cite has.xii. gates / of the which.xii. gates /
the.xii. apostels / the.xii. patriarchs / and the.xii. prophettes be porters.
At every gate be iii. porters in the name of the trinite. There be turrettes
and dwelling places innumerable: Quia multe mansiones in celo. Io. 14
There be in Paradise very many dwelling places / meet for every man after
their merit. And therefore let us take counsel / on which side we shall
assail this cite. Me thinks we shall soonest come in it we cast and shoot
our darts / arowes / and gounnes against the great to wre and place of this
cite / wherein the king and the queen dwell / that is our sweet lord Jesus /
and Mary his sweet mother. Against this tower we must cast so many syghes /
compunctions of heart / tears / and devout prayers / that we may find some
enter in to this cite: and perceive by some feeling of devotion given us by god
/ that our syghes and prayers be hard: If we can not get in to the cite at
our pleasure: yet for all that let us not break up our siege / but continue
hit still / cryynge: Upon them / upon them. And let us go continually from
one gate to an other / until we may find some enter: that is to say / Let
us pray / now to one saint / now to an other / as our devotion will serve
us. But before all other and pryncipally let us pray deuoutely to our
blessed lady / queen of this cite / mother of mercy and of all pite: For she is
so gentyl and so kind / that she will not hyde her from us / but will open to
us the gates of this cite / though she had yet leauer that we should continue
ever more in virtue / good life / and devout prayere. But if she or any other
prolonge the matter / let us scale the walls with the ladder of Contemplacion
/ and let us set up this ladder of contemplacion just to the walls / that
is considrynge god and such heavenly and worldly things as may be seen and
consydred by man. For why / by the knowledge of visyble things / we may comme
to the knowledge of divine and inuysyble things / as saint Paul says: To. 1
Inuisibilia enim dei a creatura mundi, per eq que facta sunt, intellecta
conspiciuntur. And if they overthrow us from this ladder (for we can not
remain long upon hit / because of the weight of our body / which always
anoyeth and hurts the soul / not suffrynge it to lift it self upward to
god / which thing man's soul naturally desires to do / as the wise man
says: Sa. ix.
Corpus, quod corrumpitur, aggrauat anima^. etc. Yet for all that / let us not
give over and depart from our siege / but let us manly and so assaute this cite
on some side / whether it be by shotinge of gounnes or serpentynes against
those gates and towers / that through breaking and brusynge of them / they
may give ear to our prayers and requestis: and farther more open their gates
to us / by compassyon and pity: and that we may parceyue and feel by devotion
that they have helped us: for than the cite shall be taken. And we must cry: To
ye assault good fellows / to the assault: Upon them / upon them. God save
king Jesus / god save king Jesus. After all this let us take prisoners: one /
one saint: an other / an other / orels many of them after as we find our
minds inflamed with devotion / to take one / or to take many. For who that
has most prisoners shall be most rich. And than we must fylle and
replenysshe our bags and sackes with spoylynges: that is to say / our desires
and hearts with diverse gifts of the holy gooste / and with diverse virtues and
graces: from some one the virtue of humylyte / from some other Charity: and so
forth of other / until our sackes be filled up. And we enryched must take heed / that we bring with us no small sackes. why / after our desire and
devotion / we shall bring from thence grace / gifts / indulgence / and
pardone. Nor we must not marvel / nor yet give over the siege of this cite /
though we be some time wounded and beaten back: For as it is a great preyse
and honor for a knight / to be wounded and suffer many a stroke / for the love
of his prince and master: So in like manner hit is great honor to us / to
suffer greatte pain / and to be grievously wounded for goddis sake / and for
his love to endure great labor / great penance / and temtacion. For if we
continue in this battle and assault until we dye / we shall be greatly
rewarded / and shall have a crown of victory: which of duty must be given
unto them / that manly / and strongly / have foughten in this paynefulle life
for goddis sake. For why / as Job says: Job. vii
Militia est vita hominis super terram. The life of man in this world is none
other thing but a continual warfare against the pryncis of darkness: which
be the fendes of hell: and their soudyours / ye which are the world and the
flesh / with unlawful and dishonest desire: the which both night and day
labor to distroye and over come us. And also to bring us out of the high
way / that leads men to heaven. If we may over come these our ennemies / we
shall be crowned / as our lord god says in the Apocalypse: Apot. ^
Vincenti, inquit, dabo edete de ligno vite, quod est in paradiso dei mei. He
that gets the victory (says our lord) shall eat of the tree of life /
which is in Paradise: and in the glory of god my father. The which thing
grant us the father / the son / and the holy ghost. Amen.

Thus ends this devout treatise. Imprinted at London in Fletestrete / in the
house of Thomas Berthelet / nere to the Cu^dite / at the sign of Lucrece. The
year of our lord. 1529. The 10. day of March.
