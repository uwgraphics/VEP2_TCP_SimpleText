By the King.
IT is a thing notorious that many of the meanest sort of our people in diverse
parts of our kingdom, either by secret combination, wrought by some wicked
instruments, or by ill example of the first beginners, have presumed lately to
assemble themselves riotously in multitudes, and being armed with sundry
weapons, have laid open in forcible manner a great quantity of several men's
possessions, some newly enclosed, and others of longer continuance, making
their pretense that some towns have been depopulated, and diverse families
undone by means of such Enclosures. In which seditious courses they have
persisted not only after many prohibitions by our Ministers in the several
Counties, but after particular Proclamations published by our Royal Authority,
and which is more, when so many means of lenity and gentleness were offered
to reclaim them, as no Prince would have used, but such a one as was both
confident in the loyal affections of his Subjects in general, and
compassionate toward the simplicity of such Offenders: many of them stood out
most obstinately, and in open field rebelliously resisted such forces as in
Our name, and by Our authority came to repress them, whereupon insued by
necessity in the end that some blood was drawn as well by martial Execution,
as by civil Justice.

Upon this accident it seems good unto Us to declare to the world, and
specially to Our loving Subjects, as well that which concerns Our affections
(which upon several respects are divided between comfort and grief) as that
which concerns also Our Princely intentions, which likewise are bent upon the
contrary objects and courses of Grace and Justice. For first of all We find
cause of comfort in our selves in regard of the clearenesse of Our conscience
(to whom God has committed the care and supreme Government of Our people)
from giving cause or color of such complaint; the matter whereof is such, as
We take Our selves more interessed therein then any our Subjects can be: For
as We cannot but know, that the glory and strength of all Kings consists in
the multitude of Subjects, so may We not forget that it is a special and
peculiar pre-eminence of those Countries, over which God has placed Us, that
they do excel in breeding and nourishing of able and serviceable people, both
for War and Peace, which We do justly esteem above all Treasure and
Commodities, which our said dominions do otherwise so plentifully yield unto
Us. Neither in this particular case of depopulation, can any man make doubt but
it must be far from our inclination to suffer any tolleration of that which
may be any occasion to decay or diminish our people, if we did consider
nothing else, but that use and application which we may make (as other Princes
do) both of the bodies of our people to carry arms for defense of our Crown,
and of their goods and substance to supply our wants upon all just and
reasonable occasions, so as we may by many reasons sufficiently justify our
care herein toward God and the world (forasmuch as apperteineth to our Kingly
Office) seeing the said Enclosures (lawful or unlawful) were all or the most
part made before we had taken the Scepter of this Government into our
Possession. Whereunto we may add (as wholly cleansing and washing our hands
from the tolleration of these grieuances) the continual and strict charges and
commandments given by us to our Judges and Justices, for, the care and
reformation of those things which may be in any wise grievous to our people in
their several Countries, although in this point there is some defense
alleged by our subordinate Ministers, and specially by the Justices of Assise,
that our people have been wanting to themselves in the due and ordinary means
which they ought to take, by presentment of such as are or have been guilty of
these oppressions. But as we take comfort that the causes of these complaints
have not proceeded from our Government, having contrariwise (before these
seditious courses first brake forth) taken into our Princely consideration this
matter of depopulating and decaying of Towns and Families (whereof we are more
sensible, then any other) with resolution to cure whatsoever is amiss, by just
and orderly remedies: So are we grieved to behold what the disloyalty and
obstinacy of this rebellious people has forced us unto, who being naturally
inclined to spare shedding of blood, could have wished that the humble and
voluntary submission and repentance of all those Offenders, might both have
prevented the loss of the life of any one of them, and the example of Justice
upon some might have prevented the loss of more. And seeing it was of such
necessity, that some in regard of their intolerable obstinacy in so pernicious
Treason should perish, rather then the sparks of such a fire in our Kingdom
should be left unquenched, that it may yet serve to put others in mind of their
duty, and save them from the like ruin and destruction, for such and so
Traitorous attemps hereafter: In all which considerations, for that which may
concern our own Royal intention, as we would have all men know and conceive,
that neither the pretense of any wrongs received, nor our great mislike of
depopulation in general, can in any wise stay us any longer, from a severe and
just prosecution of such as shall take upon them to be their own judges and
reformers, either in this or any other pretended grieuance: So on the other
side, we are not minded that the offenses of a few (though justly provoking our
Royal indignation) shall alter our Gracious disposition to give relief in
this case, where it apperteineth, were it for none other cause, then in respect
of so many others our good and loving Subjects, which might have alleged like
cause of grief, and nevertheless have contained themselves in their due
obedience.

And therefore We do first declare and publish our Princely resolution, That
if any of our Subjects shall hereafter upon pretenses of the same or like
grieuances, either persist in the unlawful and rebellious Act already begun,
or renew and break forth into the like, in any parts of our Kingdom; We will
prefer the safety, quiet, and protection of our Subjects in general, and of
the body of our State, before the compassion of any such Offenders, be they
more or less, and howsoever misled: and must forget our natural clemency by
pursuing them with all severity for their so heinous Treasons, as well by our
Arms as Laws, knowing well, that We are bound (as the head of the politic
body of our Realm) to follow the course which the best Physicians use in
dangerous diseases, which is, by a sharp remedy applied to a small and
infected part, to save the whole from dissolution and destruction. To which
end We do accordingly charge and command all our Lieutenants, Deputy
Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and all other Magistrates of Justice
under Us, and all other our loving Subjects to whom it shall any ways
appertain, to do and employ their uttermost endeavors and forces for the
keeping of our Subjects in peace and obedience, for prevention of all such
riotous and rebellious Assemblies, and destroying them, (if any do remain, or
shall happen to arise) by force of Arms, and by execution (even to present
death) of such as shall make resistance.

On the other side We do notify and declare to all our loving Subjects, That
We are resolved, not out of any apprehension or regard of these tumults and
disorders (which We know well to be only dangerous to those that attempt them,
and which experience may teach them, that they are in a moment to be dispersed)
nor to satisfy disobedient people, be they rich or poor: But merely out of
love of Justice, Christian compassion of other of our Subjects, who being
likewise touched with this grief, avoided the like offenses, As also out of
our Princely care and providence to preserve our people from decay or
diminution, To cause the abuses of Depopulations and unlawful Enclosures to be
further looked into, and by peaceable and orderly means to establish such a
reformation thereof, as shall be needful for the just relief of those that
have just cause to complain, and therein neglect no remedy, which either the
laws of our Realm do prescribe, or our own Royal Authority, with the
advice of our Council can supply.

For which purpose we have already assembled our Judges, and given them in
charge straightly, to make it one of their principal cares as well to discover
the said offenses, as to consider how far they may be touched in law, and in
what course, and accordingly to proceed against them with all severity. And
yet because the execution thereof requires some time, though no more then must
of necessity be employed therein, if any turbulent or seditious spirits by
their impatience, or through their desire to satisfy their own wicked humors,
by moving common troubles shall seek to prevent the course of Justice by any
such unlawful attempts, as have been lately used, and abusing our gracious
disposition shall take the presumption to be Reformers of the said
inconvenience by any force, because they perceive hereby how much we mislike of
it: We do once again denounce unto them the same severe punishment, which
belongs to Rebels in the highest degree, And do require all and every our
Magistrates, Officers and Ministers of Justice (according to their place of
authority) and all our loyal Subjects according to their duty of assistance
(laying aside all slackenes or fond pity) to see it duly put in execution:
As on the other side we do promise, and are resolved graciously to lend our
ears to humble and just complaints, and to afford our people Justice and
favor both in this and all occasions fit for a King to do for his good
Subjects in general and in particular.

Given at our Manor of Greenewich the xxviij. day of June, in the fifth year
of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

Majesty. ANNO DOM. 1607.
