Here begins the first chapter which tells how and by whom the Cite
of Ladies was first begone to build. Capitulo. Primo.
AFter the manner that I have much in usage / and to that thing which the
excercyse of my life is most dys posed / that is to know in the haun tynge of
study. On a day as I was sitting in my little cell diverse books of diverse
matters about me. Mine entente was at that time to travail and to gather in
to my consayte the wayenge of diverse sentences of diverse auctours by my long
time before studied. I dressed my vysage toward those foresaid books /
thinking as for y^ time to leave in peace subtle things / and to dysporte me
for to look upon some pleasant book of the writing of some poets / and as I
was in this entente I serched about me after some praty book / and of
adventure came a strange book in to my hands that was taken to me to keep / I
opened this book and I saw by ye intytulacyon that it called him Matheolus.
Then in laughing because I had not seen him / and often times I had herd
speak of him that he should not speak well of the reverence of women. I thought
that in manner of solace I would vysyte him. And yet I had not looked long on
him but yt my good mother that bare me called me to the refeccyon of souper
whereof ye hour was come purposynge to se him in the morning / I left him at
yt time / and in ye morrow following I sat me again to my study as I did of
custom I forgate it not in put my will to effect yt came to me ye night
before to vysyte ye foresaid book of Matheolus. And then I began to read and to
prosede in him. But as me seemed ye matter was not right pleasant to people yt
delyted them not in evil saying / nor it was of no profit to any edyfyenge
of virtue / seeing the words and the matters dyshonest of which it touched
vysytynge here and there / and so came to ye end I left him and took head of
more higher matters and of more profit / yet the sight of this foresaid book
how be it that he was of none auctoryte it engendered in me a new thought /
which made great marvel to grow in my courage / and thinking what might be
the cause and whereof it might come that so many diverse men clerks and others
have been and ben enclyned to say by mouth / and in their treatise and
wrytynges so many slaundres and blames of women and of their condycyons and not
only one or twain nor this Matheolus / which among others has no manner of
reputacyon and treats in manner of scorn / but generally in all treatyses of
phylosphres / poets / and all rethorycyens / which should be long to reherce
all their names / speaks as it were by one mouth and accords all in semble
conclusyon determining that ye condycyons of women ben fully enclyned to all
vices. These things thinking in me right depely / I began to examyne myself
and my condycyons as a woman natural. And in like wise I dyscuted of other
women / whose company I haunted / as well of pryncesses and of great ladies as
of mean gentle women right great plentye / which of their graces have told
me their pryuytees and strayte thoughts to know by my Judgment in conscience
and with out favor if it it might be true that so many notable men of one
and other witnesses / yet not withstanding that for things yt I might know
as long as I have sought and serched I could not perceive that such
Iugementes might be true against the natural condycyons or ma ners of women.
I argued strongly against these women saying yt it should be to great a thing
yt so many famous men / so solemn clerks of so high and great
understanding / so clearly seeing in all things as it seemed that should have
spoken or written lyengly / and in so many places yt of pain I found any
moral volume what so ever yt auctoure were yt or I had read it to ye end but
some chapytres or certain clauses were of blaming of them. This only short
reason made me to conclude that mine understanding / for his symplenesse and
ygnoraunce ne could not know my great defautes and semblably of other women
that always it accorded that it was so truly / and so I reported me more to
the Judgment of other then to that I felt or know of myself. Thus in this
thought was I as a person half from himself / and there came before me right
great foyson of dyttyes and proverbs of many diverse auctours to ye purpose yt
I remembered in myself one after another / as it were a well spryngynge. And
in conclusyon of all I determined yt god made a foul thing when he fourmed
woman in meruayllynge how so worshypfull a work man deyned ever to make one
so abhomynable work which is the vessel as by saying of the^ and y^
draught and herbegage of al evil and of all vices Then I being in this
thought there sprange in me a great dyspleasannce and sorrow of courage in
dyspraysynge myself and all womenkynde so as if yt should be showed in nature
/ and I said such words in my'complayntes. Ha lord god how may yt be / for
if I arre not in y^ faith I ought not doubt yt thine infynyte wisdom and very
parfyte goodness had nothing made but yt all were good / and fourmest not y^
thyselfe woman right syngulerly and then y^ gave her all such inclynacyons yt
pleased ye yt she should have and how may yt be yt thou should have failed in
any thing / and always se here so many great occasyons thus Iuged determined
and co^ cluded against them I can not understand this re pugnaunce / and if it
be so good lord god yt it be true yt womankynde haboundeth in so many abhomy
nacyons as many men witnesses / and thou say thyselfe yt the witness of
many is for'to believe / by the which I ought not doubt but that it shol de be
true. Alas good lord why had thou not made me to be borne in to this
world in y^ mascu line kind / to that entente yt mine euclynacyons might have been al to have served the the better and y^ I should not have arred in any
thing and might have been of so great perfeccyon as they say yt men be / yet
sith it is so that thy debonayrnesse stretche th not so much toward me / then
spare my negly gence in thy service good lord god / and be not dyspleased. For
that servant that receives leest rewards of his lord / leest is bound to
his service. Such words and mo ynowe I said right lon ge in my sorrowful
thought to god and in my lamentacyon so as she that by my folly held me right
evil content of that that god made me to be borne in to this world in kind
of woman.

Xp^ine tells how.iii. ladies appeared to her / and how she yt went before
reasoned with her first and comforted her of the dyspleasure that she had
Capitulo. Secundo.
AS I was in this sorrowful thought y^ heed down cast as a shamfull per sone /
the eyes full of teeres holding mine hand under my cheke / lenynge on y^
pomell of my chair sod^ynly I saw come down upon my lap a stremyn ge of
light as it were of y^ same. And I that was in a derke place i which y^ sone
might not shine at y^ hour sterte then as though I had been waked of a dreme /
and dressynge the heed to behold this light fro whens it might come I saw
before me standing three ladies crowned of right sovereign reverence. Of the
which the shynynge of their clear faces gave light unto me and to all the
place / there as I was meruayllynge neither man nor woman with me considering
the door close upon me / and they thither came doubting leest it had been some
fantasye for to have tempted me made the sign of the cross in my forehede full
of dread. And then she which was the first of the three in laughing began thus
to reason with me Dear daughter dread ye naught / for we be not come hyder for
nothing that is contrary unto the / nor to do the to be encombred / but for to
comfort the as those that have pity of thy trouble / and to put the out of the
ygnoraunce that so much blyndeth thine understanding / and that thou put
fro the that thou know of very certain s^yence / to give faith to the
contrary to that which thou felest not / ne see not / ne know otherwise
than by pluralyte of strange opynyons. Thou resemblest the fool of the which
was made a Iape which was slepynge in ye mylle and whas clothed in the
clothing of a woman / and to make resemblaunce those that mocked him wytnessed
yt he was a woman / and so he byleued more their false saynges than ye
certaynte of his being. How is it fair daughter / and where is thy wit
become Have thou forgoten now how ye fine gold proves him in the fornayse
yt he changes not his virtue but is more plyaunt to be brought in to diverse
facyons. And know thou not yt the most meruayllous things be most
debatous and most arguous if thou will advise the / In the same wise to the
most high things that been yt is to know ye celestyall things. Behold if
these great phylosophres that has been that thou arguest against thine own
kind have determined false and to the contrary of truth / and as they
repugne one against another as thou thyselfe have seen in ye book of
Metaphisike where as Arystotle reproves their opynyons / and reherseth the
same wise of Plato and of others / and note this again. If saint Austyne and
other doctors of ye church have done so / the same wise Arystotle in some
parties al be it that he be called the prince of phylosophres and in whom
Phylosophye natural and moral was soueraynely. And it seems that trowest
that all the words of Phylosophres ben artycles of the faith of Ihesu christ /
and that they may not arre. And as to these poets of which thou spekest
know not thou well that they have spoken in many things in manner of
fables. And do entende so much to the contrary of that that their sayenges
shows. And it may be taken after the rewle of grammere the which is named
Antyphrasys / the which entendeth thus as thou know well / 'as one should
say sith one is a shrewe / that is to say that he is good / and so by the
contrary. So I counsel the that thou do thy profit of their sayenges and
thou understand it so what so ever be their entente in such places where as
they blame women. And peradventure this same man that is Matheolus in his book
understood ye same. For there be many things who so takes them after the
letter it should be pure heresye / and shame to him that says it / and not
only to him but to others. And the same wise of ye Romaunce of the rose on
whom is put great faith because of the auctoryte of the maker of the order of
marriage which is an holy estate and worshypfull and ordained of god. This
thing proves clearly by experyence that the contrary is true of the
shrewdenesse that they purpose and sith to be in that estate / to the great
charge and blame of women. For who was ever that housbande yt ever suffered
such maystrye of his wife that she should have leave to say so many vylanyes
and iniures as they put upon women that they should say / I believe what so
ever thou have seen in writing you saw it never at ye eye. So they be pure
lesynges right shrewdely colored. Thus I say in concludynge my lefe friend
that folly caused ye this present opinion. Now come again to thyselfe and
take thy wit and trouble ye no more for such fantasyes. For know well yt all
this evil saynges generally of women hurts ye sayers and not ye women.

Xp^ine says how that the lady that reasoned with her devised what was her
propryete and where of she served / and told her how she should build a cite
with ye help of these.iij. ladies. Ca. iij.
THis famous lady saying these words to me with ye presence of whom I can
not say which of my wits was most undertaken in mine herynge / in
herkenynge of her worthy words where that my sight was in beholdynge her great
beauty / her attire / her reverent port / and her right worshypfull
countenance / and the same wise of the others / and wist not which of them to
behold / for so much these three ladies resembled either other / that of
pain I might know that one from that other / but that I should have been
deceived. And she of the less auctoryte than that other had her chere so
fyerse that whom her eyes beheld was not so hardy / but that he should be
undertaken with great dread. For it seemed that she manased the evil doers. So
I was before them standing up from my syege for their reverence beholdynge
them without faynynge of any word / as that person that was so overtaken yt
could not sown a word. And I had great marvel in my heart thinking who
they might be and right gladly if I had durst I would have asked their names
and their being / and what was the sygnyfyenge of ye dyfferent septres yt each
of them held in their right hands which were of right great richesse and
wherefore they were come thither / yet when I had thought me not worthy to reason
with them in such demaundes so high ladies as they appeared unto me I durst
in no manner but continued my sight upon them half aferde / and half assured
by the words that I had herd them say / which has cast me out of my first
thought / yet that right wise lady yt had reasoned with me which knew my
thought in spyryte as she that has sight in all things answered to my thought
saying thus. Dear daughter know ye that the prouydence of god that nothing
leueth vain ne comes not us to estable though that we know celestyall
things to be and to haunte among the people of this bace world to ye entente
to put in order and to hold in equity the stablementes made by ourselfe after
the will of god in diverse offices / to ye which god we three ben daughters and
of him borne. So it is mine office to redress men and women when they are out
of the way to put them again in the right way. And I come to the^ pryuely in
spyryte all couertely / and I preche them and teache them in showing their
error / and that in which they fail I assygne them the causes / and after I
teache them ye manner to follow that that is to do / and how they should flee
that that is to be left. And for yt I serve to show clearly and make to se in
conscience their deeds to every man and woman / and their propre tatches and
defautes / thou feast me hold instead of a septre this bright glass or
myroure that I bear in my right hand know this for truth that there is no
person that looks in this myroure but he may know every creature what he is
clearly. O my myroure it is of so great dygnyte that it is not without great
cause that he is so enuyronned of so rich precious stones as thou see it.
For by him these beynges qualytees proporcyon / and measures of al things ben
know ne / ne without him may nothing be well made nor done / and for yt that
thou desyrest to know also the offices of mine other two systers yt thou see
here / to that entente that the wytnessynge of us may be to the more certain
each of them in their own person shall answer of their name and of their
propryete / yet the cause and the mouynge of our coming shall be declared by
me right here / I make the to understand that as there shall be done nothing
without good cause / our apperyn ge is nothing here in vain. For though that
we be not comunely in many places and that the knowledge of us comes not unto
all people.

Nevertheless for the great love the which thou haste for to inquire after
things by very long and contynuall study / by the which thou do yield
thyselfe here solytarye / and thou withdraw est the out of the world / thou
haste deserved and thou deseruest to be vysyted and to be comforted of us in
thy trouble and sorrow as right a dear friend / and that thou be made clearly
seeing those things that defoule and trouble thy courage in the derkenesse of
thought. Also there is a gretter cause of our coming and a more specyal that
thou shalt know by our reuelacyon / so understand to that entente that this
error might be destroyed we would that these ladies and all worshypfull women
might have from hens forth some manner of place to come to or a cloystre of
defense against all those that would assail them. For the defaute of which
all these foresaid ladies and famous women have long time be left unclosed as
a field without hedge without finding of any champyon that for their defense
might compare suffycyently. Notwithstanding these noble men that by ordenaunce
of right ought to defend them / which by negligence and no force has
suffered them to be defouled / by ye which it is no meruayl though their
enuyous enemies and the outrage of vylaynes assaylled them by diverse crafts
and have had ye vyctory against them in their war for defaute of defense
where is yt cite so strong yt might not sone be taken if there be not found
resystence. Nor so unjust a cause but it might be gotten by co^tynuaunce of him
yt pledeth without party / right so these simple and debonayre ladies to ye
ensample of pacyence which god commands has suffered frendely these great
iniuryes yt so much by ye mouth of so many and their hands writing have
suffered so much wrong thus they report them to god of their good right / yet
now it is time that their Just cause be put out of ye hands of Pharao. And
therefore between us three ladies yt thou see here moved by pity / we be come
to tell the of a certain building made in the manner of a cloystre of a Cite
strongely wrought by masons hands and well builded / which is predestynate to
the for to make and to stable it by our help and counsel / in the which
shall none enhabyte but only ladies of good fame / and women worthy of
praysynges. For to them where virtue shall not be found / the walls of our
Cite shall be strongely shytte.

Xp^ine tells how the lady deuyfed to her the Cite that was committed to her
to make and yt she was stabled to help her to begin the walls and the
cloystre about / and after told her her name. Capitulo.iiij.
THus fair daughter yt prerogatyue is given to the among al other women to
make and fortefye the Cite of ladies for the which thou shalt take upon the
to make the foundement and parfytely conclude him. And thou shall te receive of
us three / wine and water as of a clear well. And we shall deliver to the matter
enough more stronger and more durable than any marbre / and as for Cyment
there shall be no better tha^ thou shalt have. So shall thy Cite be right fay
re without pere and of perpetual during to the world. Haste you not read yt
the king Troys founded the great cite of Troy by ye help of Appolo / Mynerue
/ and Neptune / which the people at that time trowed them as gods. And also
how Cadmus founded the cite of Thebes by ye mynestracyon of gods. And for all
that those cy tees by space of time were overthrown and ben turned in to
ruin. But I prophecye to the as verray Sybylle that never this cite which
thou shalt found shall be brought to naught / ne shall not fall but always
endure in prosperyte maulgre all his enuyous enemies / though that he be fou
ght withal by many diverse assaults / so she shall never be taken ne overcome.
Sometime ye royalme of Amosonye was begone by ye ordynaun ce and entrepryse of
diverse women of great courage which despised bondage so as the hystoryes
bears witness. And long time by them it was mayntayned under sygnyouryes of
diverse queen's right noble ladies ye which they chose them self and governed
right fair and well / and by gre te strength maynteyned the lordshyp / and
never thelesse though they were of great might and puyssaunce and that in the
time of their domynacyon conquered great part of the oryent and all the lands
nyghe them put them in dread / and in the same wise the country of Greece
doubted them which that time was y^ four of all countrees of y^ world / and
not for yt within process of time the puyssaunce of the royalme by the same
manner as it is of all other worldely lordshyppes there is not by den in this
time as now but only ye same. But this cite shall be of much more stronger
buyldyn ge that thou have to make / for ye which to begin I am committed by ye
delyberacyon among us all three ladies together to deliver the mortar durable
and without corrupcyon to make the stron foundementes and the great walls all
about. And to lift up the high large and great towers and strong castelles
/ dyked / bastyled / and barred as much as it perteyneth to a cite of great
defen ce / and by our deuyse thou shalt set it in great dep nesse to endure
the longer / and after thou shalt lift up the walls so high yt all the
world shall dread them. Daughter thus I have now told ye the causes of our
coming to ye entente yt thou take the more credence to my saying. Now I will
yt thou learn my name by the sown of yt whi che only thou shalt know yt
thou have in me if y^ will follow mine ordynau^ces a mynystresse in thy need
to do ytyu might not yestereuen. I am na med dame Reason / now advise ye then
if you be in good conduyte / so I say no more to ye at this time

Here Xp^ine tells how the second lady told her her name / and whereof she
served / and how she should help her to make the masonry of the cite of
Ladies. Ca. v.
When the lady above said had accheued her word or that I had laysoure to
answer. The second lady began to answer in this manner I am called
ryghtwysnesse which has my dwelling more in heaven than in earth. But as a
sone beme / and a lyghtnynge or a shynynge or god and messangere of his
goodness / I haunte among the Just persons and counsel them to do all
thing well and to yield to every man that that is his / and after to say and
sustain truth to be re the right of the poor people and Innocents / to
grieve others by vsurpacyon / and sustain the renown of them that been accused
without cause. I am the shield and defense of the servants of god / I call on
the punycyon of evil folks / I make to give and allow to the trauayllers /
and I reward the good doers / and god makes open his secrets by me to his
friends. I am their advocate in heaven. This shynynge line yt thou see me
hold instead of a Septre in my right hand is y^ right rewle y^ departs the
right from the wrong / and it shows the dyfference between good and evil /
who so follows it shall not goo out of the way. This is the staff of peace
that reconsyleth the good. And where upon they lene them / he smyteth and
beteth the evil doers / what should I more say to the. By this line all
things are lymytted and the dygnytees of him ben infynyte. So understand
that he shall serve the well / and thou shalt have need of him to measure the
building of the cite that is committed to the to make / and of the said Cite
to make the stone work and to make within the high towers and the high pa
layces to compace the housynge and all the mansyons / the streets and places /
and all things couenables to help the / and to put suffycyent people within
the foresaid Cite / thus am I come in thine help with my sister Reason / and
this noble lady which thou see here. Boholde this is mine office. Now
dysmaye thou not of the great largeness and long cyrcuyte of the closing of
the wall. For by the help of god and of us thou shalt build it and people
it right well and fair without leuynge of any void thing with fair mansyons
and strong herbegages

Here Xp^ine tells how the third lady told her what she was and wherefore
she served / and how she would help her to make the high bataylmentes of the
towers of her Cite and to people it with noble ladies. Ca. vi.
AFter this spoke the third lady which said right thus. Xp^ine right dear
friend. I am Justice the synguler daughter of god / and my being proceeds
purely of his propre person. My dwelling is in heaven / in earth / and in
hell. In heaven for the glory of saints and of blessed souls / In earth for
to depart and give every man his porcyon other of good or of evil as he has
deserved. In hell for the punycyon of evil people I bow not to no part. For
there is no friend / no fere of great will / pity / nor prayer / thretnynge nor
cruelte that moves me. Mine office is only for to Judge / depart / and to
make y^ payment after every man's ryghtfull deseruynge. I sustain all things
in estate / and without me there may no thing be stablysshed / I am in god /
and god is in me / and we be as one self thing. He that follows me may not
fail. And my way is sure. I teache to every man and woman wholesome
understanding if he believe me / and I teache him to chastyce / to know / and
to reprove himself / first to do to another yt that he would should be done to
him / to depart things without favor to say truth / to fle and hate
lesynges / and to put away all vycyous things. This vessel of fine gold yt
thou see in my right hand made after ye guyse of a round measure / god my
fader gave it me / and it serves to measure to every man his lyueray of such
merit as he ought to have. It is marked with ye flower deluce of the Trynyte /
and he yielded him Just to porcyons there may no man complain of my measure.
But these men of the world have other measures which they say depends and
come th of mine. But falsely they measure often times under shadow of me / and
there their measure is not always Just / other it is to large to some * or to
little to some others. I might hold long tale enough of the propryetees of
mine office. But shortly for to say I am an especyall among other virtues /
for all they refer them to me. And among us.iij. ladies that thou see here
we be as one self thing / and we may none of us do without other. And that
the first dysposeth / the second ordeyneth and puts it to work. And then I
that am the third perfourmeth it and brings it to end. Thus am I stabled to
help the by the will of us three perfytely to make thy Cite. And mine office
shall be to make ye high roffes of thy towers of the mansyons and of the
herbegages which shall be of fine gold shynynge bright. And I shall people it
of right worthy ladies / and they shall be such that shall have the prerogatyue
and the honor among these other women as ye most excellences. And there I
shall yield the by thine own help parfyte fortefyenge and closing of strong
gates the which I shall go seek in heaven and I shall deliver unto the the
keys with mine own hands.

Here Xp^ine tells how she spoke to to the.iij. ladies. Ca. vij.
THese words abouesayd ended which I had herkened by great entente of
these.iij. ladies which had drawn fro me entyerly the dyspleasaunce that I
had before their coming Suddenly I fell down at their feet not only on
knees but all flat for their great excellence / kissing y^ earth about
their feet worshyppynge them as goddesses. I began myneoryson of praysynge of
them in this wise. O lady of sovereign dygnyte / Lanternesse of heaven gyuynge
ly ght to all the earth / wells of paradyse / and the Joy of them that been
blessed / whereof is come to your highness such humylyte that ye have vouched
saufe to come from your high syeges and shynynge trones in to the troubled
tabernacle and dar ke of a simple and an ygnoraunt study / which may not
yield couenable thankynges to such a benefyce / and which have by the rain
of the dew of your sweet words fallen upon me departed and tempered the
dryness of mine understanding / so y^ it feleth him now ready to burgyn and
put out new plants / dysposed to bear fruit of profitable virtue and
delectable smelling / how shall it be done in me such grace that I shall
receive the gift after your word to make and fortefye now right in this
world such a new cite. I am not saint Thomas the appostle that made by
deuyne grace in heaven a rich palace to y^ king of ynde? Nor my feeble wit
can not / ne knows not the craft ne measures / ne the study nor the pratyke
of building / and if these things by possybylyte of conning were now in
mine understanding / where should be taken suffycyent strength in my f^ble
woman's body to put so great a thing to work / yet nevertheless my right
redoubted ladies how be it yt the meruayllynge of these new tidings be
strange to me I know well y^ there is nothing impossyble as to god and I
ought not doubt that what things y^ ever be taken on hand by the counsel
and help of you three / but that they be well and fair ended. Thus worship ped
be god with all my power and you my ladies that so much have worshypped me that
I am sta bled to so noble a commyssyon y^ which I receive with great
gladness. And se here your chamberere ready to obey. Now command after your
pleasure.

Here Xp^ine tells how by the commandment of dame Reason she began to
dygge the earth to make the foundement. Ca. viij.
REason y^ noble lady then answered and said. Now rise daughter without more
abiding / go we in to the field of scryptures / there shall be lou^ ded the
Cite of Ladies in a plain country and fruytefull / there where all fruytes and
sweet waters ben found / and where the ground haboundeth of all good things.
Take the py coys of thine understanding and dygge strong ly / and make a great
dyke about where thou see y^ trace of my line. And I shall help the to bear
out y^ earth upon mine own sholders. And then for to obey to their
commau^demente I dressed me lightly feeling my self by y^ virtue of them more
strong and more light than I was before. So she went before and I after / and
we came in to the foresaid field / I began to dyke and dygge af ter her sign
with the picoys of inquisycyon / and my first work was done in this wise.
Madame me thinks well that ye have said to me before applyenge to the purpose
of yt / yt many me^ have so much blamed and blames generally y^ condycions of
women / that the gold the more it is in the fornayce the more it fyneth him /
which is to understand / that the more they be blamed wrongfully the more
increases their merit of their praysynge / yet I pray you tell me wherefore it
is and whens comes y^ cause that so many diverse auctours have spoken against
the^ in their books sith that I feel now that it is of wrong / whether that
nature enclyne them / or if they do it for hate / and whens ryseth the cause.
Than she answered thus. Daughter for to give the way to goo in more deper I
shall here out this first to be borne out. Know that it comes not of nature /
but it is all y^ contrary. For there is in y^ worl de no man so great / ne so
strong as he is of y^ gre te love that nature by the will of god puts by
twene man and woman. But the causes ben diverse and indyfferent yt has moved
and moves many diverse men to blame women / and the same wise y^ auctours in
their books as y^ thou have found For some have done it in god entente / that
is to know / for to draw again these men that be out of the way / by the
hauntynge of diverse women that been vycyous and light / whereof they be assotted
/ other to keep them yt they be not assotted and to the entente y^ every man
should fle y^ life y^ is lecherous and foul / they have blamed all women
generally for their trowynge to do of al abhomy nacyons. Madame said I then
pardon me if I yield you here your word / then have they done well sith y^
good entente has moved them. For it is said that the entente Iugeth the man.
Fair daughter y^ is evil taken said she. For ygnoraun ce makes not one to
excuse him if he siewe a man in good entente / and by his folysshe trowynge
then should it be well done / yet what so ever they be as in that they have
used of evil right. For why to do greuaunce and preiudyce to one party to
trow to socoure another it is no right / and to blame al y^ condycyons of
women to y^ contrary of truth so as I shall show y^ by experyence.
Notwithstan dynge they should do it in y^ entente to withdraw these foles from
folly / and also yt if I blame the fire which is right a good element and
right necessary because yt some men were burnt therein. And al so y^ water for
y^ some me^ ben drowned in it / and the same wise if one should say of all
good things which a man may use both well and evil no man ou ght to blame
them though these foles abuse the^. And these points y^ haste touched
thyselfe in thy sayings / yet they yt so has spoken habundauntly what so ever
was their entente they have taken their purpose upon the large only to come to
their entente / so as he does yt makes him to cut a long and a large gown
of a piece of cloth that cost him naught / and no man says the con trary so he
takes and grants the right of ano there to his usage / yet as thou haste
said other times ynowe. If thou should have sought the way es to withdraw
these men from folly and to keep them that they labor not in vain to blame
the life and the condycyons of them the which shows them vycyous and light
/ as there is nothing in ye world yt makes one more to fle to say the right
truth / as does a shrewde woman / ly ght and cursed as it shows which is
a thing counterfayte and out of her propre condycyon natu rall which ought to
be simple / pryuy / and honest I consent well that they should have builded so
ueraynely a good and fair work / but to blame all where there ben so many
right excellent I pro myse y^ that it came never of me but that they failed and
fail gretely / and al they y^ follows them So cast out these foul stones
ragged and black out of thy work for they shall never serve ne shall not be
put i good building of thy cite. Other men have blamed women for other causes
/ for to some it is come of their own vices and some be moved for ye defaute
of their own ladies others for pure envy / some others for delectacyon that
of their propre condycyon has to say shrewdely Other for to show that they
have seen enough of scripture / and so they grounded them on that y^ they have
found in books and speaks after those others and aledge them for auctours.
Those the which it is come of their propre vices ben men that have used their
youth in the dyssolute life and habou^ded them in many diverse loves of diverse
women. Thus they are borne up by diverse causes which takes no head of
themself and waxes old in their sins without repentance / yet ta ke they
sorrow to their passed folyes and dyssolute life that they have led in their
time. For nature is waxed cold in them which suffers them not to put their
courage to effect after their will that ye appetyte would without puyssaunce.
So they have sorrow when they se that ye life yt they were wont to call their
good time is faylled from them and that the young men yt ben now have the time
as they were wont to have. Thus they know not how to put away their sorrow
but to blame women by their trowynge to do dys pleasaunce to others. And one
says communely such old men speak foul and dyshonestly so as thou may
se them / and properly of Matheolus which confesses himself that he was old
full of will and no power / and thou may prove it true by him that I have
said to the. And believe it stably that it is in the same wise of others / but
these old men thus defouled which be as ye life of a mesell that may not be
heled of the good ancient men that I have made perfyte in virtue in the mouth
of whom after their courage all the words ben of good ensampre / honest / and
dyscrete and which hates all evil doyinge and evil saying. And they defame
not ne blame another men ne women / but hates all vices in general
counsaylynge to fle them and follow the right way. Those that have been moved
by defaute of their own body ben some impotent and dyfformed of their members
that have sharp and malycyous understanding. And the sorrow of their
impotencye can none otherwise aduenge them / but to blame them of whom comes
Joy to many by trowynge to turn away ye pleasaunce of others when they may
not use it in their own person.

Those that have blamed them by envy ben some myscheuous men yt have seen and
known diverse women of gretter understanding and more noble of condycyon than
they be yt blames them And therefore their great enyuye has moved them to
blame all women / trowynge to withdraw and to make less their worship and
praysynge / All this yt he has done I wot not what man in his saying that he
claymeth title of philosophy in which he trauayleth him much to prove how it
perteyneth not that every woman be worshypped much by man / and says that
they yt makes so much of them changes wrongfully ye name of his book / that
is to say of phylosophye makes phylosopholy. But I promise the and afferme yt
he himself by the bringing forth of that process full of lesynges yt he
holds makes a right phylosopholy. Those that of nature are evil sayers / it
is no marvel when they blame every man thought they say evil of women / and
always this I promise ye that a man that says evil wylfully of women it
comes of right great age of courage. For he does against reason and against
kind Against reason in so much that he is right unkind and evil knowing of
teh great benefeytes that women has done to him / so great yt he may not yield
them again / and by so often times and contynuelly that she does to him of
necessyte against kind in that that there is no dome be ne bird but
naturally it loves derely their fader and mother. So it is a thing out of
kind when a reasonable man does the contrary.

And so as there is so worthy a work al be it that it be made by a good
master but some notwithstanding yt they can but little they will
counterfeyte. There ben many that meddle them of endytynge / and they seem that
they may not do amysse sith that others have said in their books that that they
would say and as that men says I know some of them that will entremete and
meddle for to speak in making of dyttyes of fresshe water without salt.

Such ben their wrytynges and their balades without understanding or feeling
/ and speaking of the condycyons of women / or of lords / or of other peole /
and they can not know themself nor advise their caytyuous inclynacyons and
defautes / and ye simple people which ben ygnoraunt as they say that it is
the best done thing in the world.

Here Xp^ine tells how she dygged in ye earth which is to understand the
questyons that she made to Reason / any how reason answered her. Capitulo.ix.
Now I have arrayed and ordained great work / so think thou to dygge in the
earth after ye pourtrayenge of my sign. And then to obey her commandment I
smote with all my might in this manner. Madame whens came it to Ouyde that is
of reputacyon among poets as one of the most sovereign / notwithstanding yt
diverse clerks say / and my Judgment accords to the same always under your
correccyon yt Vyrgyle was more to praise and his wrytynges of more
spedefulnesse than his which blamed women so much in many of his dyttyes as
in the book yt he made which is called the craft of love / and also in other
of his volumes.

Answer. Ouide was a subtle man in the craft and science of poetrye and had
great understanding / all be it he let his body slyppe in to all vanyte and
delight of flesh, not only in one love / but habandoned himself to al women
so as he might. Nor he kept not measure nor truth to no woman / but haunted
this life in his youth as long as he might / for ye which at the last he had
the reward and payment yt unto such a case perteyneth. That is to know /
sclaundre / loss of goods and members / wherefore in for his great
voluptuousness as well in deed as in word counsayllynge the young folk to lead the same life he was sent in to exyle. Also as it happened after that by
favor of some young puyssaunt Romans he was called again fro exyle. And he
kept him not after from falling again in his evil doing / whereof he was
somewhat punysshed before. And then he was chafed and dysseuered from his
members by his own deserte. Thus it is to the purpose that I said to ye above.
For when he saw that he might not led ye life in the which he was wont to
delight him so much. The^ he took on him strongly to blame women by his subtle
reasons / and by that enforced him to dysprayse them to others.

Madame ye say well. But I have seen a book of another auctore Italyen. I
suppose of the contrary or of the marches of Costane which calls him
Cecodastoly that says in a chapter meruayllous abhomynacyons more than any
other such as be not to reherce of no person that has understanding.

Answer. Though Cecodastoly say evil of all women / Daughter marvel the
not for he had all women in hate and dyspleasaunce and ye same wise by his
horrible shrewdenesse he would make them to dysplease and to be hated of al
men. So he was allowed after his merit / for by the deseruynge of his cursed
vice he was burnt in the fire right dyshonestly. Another little bo ke in
latyne I saw also madame / yt names him the secret of women which speaks
of ye makyn ge of their bodies natural many great defautes Answer. Thou may
know by thyselfe with out any other prove / yt that book was made at vo
lentees and fayntly colored as thou have read whi che is an open thing to
the yt it is drawn all of lesynges / and though yt some men say that it was
arystotyll / that is not to believe that such a phylo sophre was so charged
with so false tales. For by that / that these women may clearly prove and kno
we that some things yt he touches be not true / but very fables / thus they
may conclude yt these matters that he treats of be very lesynges. But
remembrest y^ it not that he says at his beginning yt I wot not what pope
cursed every man that should read it to any woman / or take it them to read.
Madame I remember it well. Than kno west not thou the malycyous cause wherefore
this Iape was given to be byleued of bestyall men and nyce at the beginning of
yt book. Madame nay but if ye tell it me. It was to yt entente yt women should
not have no knowledge of that book nor of that contained in him. For he yt made
it knew well that if they read it or herd it read / yt they should know
well yt it was but tryfles so they should ha ue spoken against him and mocked
him. Thus wol de y^ auctoure yt made it mock and begyle y^ men yt should read
it by this way. Madame I am remembered yt among these other things yt he has
said when he has spoken in oughe of ye impotence imperfeccyon and feebleness
which is cause of myss hapynge of woman's body in ye womb of ye mother yt
nature is ashamed / when she saw yt she had four med such a body as a thing
imperfyte. Ha the great folly sweet friend and the great blyndnesse out of all
reason yt moves or styreth any man to say it and how nature which is ye
chambryere of god is she more maystres tha^ her master almighty god which had
ye shap of man and woman in his thought when it came to his will to form Ada^
of ye s^yme of ye earth in the field of Damas / and when he had made him he
brought him in to paradyse ter restre which was and is the worthyest place of
this low world / and there Adam slepte and of one of his Rybbes to yt entente
yt he should love woman as his own fless he fourmed ye body of y^ woman / so
the most sovereign werkeman had no shame to make and form the body of woman
/ and should na ture be ashamed thereof. Ha ye great some of folyes to say yt
it is true / and how was she four med I wot not if y^ notest it / she was
fourmed af ter the image of god. O how durst the mouth say so evil of so
noble a prynte / but some be so gre te foles yt they trow when they here say
that god made man after his image y^ it be to say of materyall body. But it is
not so / for god had not then taken the body of man but it is to understand of
the soul which is a spyryte understanding the which shall endure without end
to y^ lykenes of the deite / y^ which soul god made and put as good and as
worthy and all even to the body of woman as of man. But yet as to the making
of the body the woman was made of the most sovereign work man / and in what
place was she made / In paradyse terrestre / whereof came the foul matere y^
she was made of. Nay it was of the most noble matere that ever was made that
was of the body that god made. Madame after that that I feel of you woman is
right a noble thing. But yet Tullyus says y^ a man should never serve a woman
/ and he that does it defouleth himself / for none ought to serve that that
is lower than him self. Answer. He is happy that serves y^ vyrgyne that is
above all the aungelles / and he or she that is most high ought to serve her
in whom all virtue haboundeth. Also madame one of the Cathons says which that
was a great clerk / y^ if y^ world had been without we should have been
conuersannt with gods. Answer. Now may thou well se the folly of him that
men held so sage. For by y^ encheson of woman men reygne th with god. And if
any would say y^ man wa^ ban^sshed by woman by the cause of dame Eue^ I say
yt he has gotten more high degree by ou^ lady Mary than he lost by Eve in so
much yt the manhood is Joined to y^ godhede and that had not ben if the
trespace of Eve had not ben. So both man and woman ought to lift up themself
from that defaute / and he that worshyppeth woman worcester shyppeth himself. For of
so much as man's nature fell more lower by such a creature as woman / by
woman she is lift up again more higher / and to be conuersaunt with gods as
Caton says if woman had not be / he said more truer tha^ he wend / for he was
a paynyme / and among the^ of yt law they understood as well gods to be in
hell as in heaven / yt is to know the deuylles whi che they called their
gods of hell. So it is no Iape that men should have been co^uersaunt with
those gods if our lady Mary had not ben.

Also of the same altrycacyons and answers. Capitulo.x.
ALso the same Caton says yet that the woman yt pleases a man naturally re
sembleth the rose which is pleasant to se / but ye thorn is under and
prycketh Answer. This Caton says more trewer again tha^ he wend. For every
good ho nest woman and of good life ought to be and is one of the pleasauntest
things yt is to se. And always there is the thorn of dread to do amysse and
a compu^ccyon in her courage which yt parts not fro her. And yt makes her
to hold her pryue and sytteth still / and that is it yt keeps her. Many
auctours bears witness madame yt women ben by nature synful. Daughter thou
have herd speak of a pro uerbe that says that yt nature gives may not be
taken away. So it should be to great a marvel if they should be so enclyned
to sin naturally. For the women yt loves her worship nature styreth them
never to come in such places where as yt sin that is said of them is used /
as in tauernes and other places to yt or for that ordained / and if any man
would answer and say yt shame keeps them / I say yt is not true. For it is
another thing that keeps them which is their natural condy cyon which is
not so enclyned thereto. And I put case that they were so enclyned and that
shame gave them such resystence contrary to their natural inclynacyon that yt
virtue and constaunce should turn them to great worship and praysynge. And to
yt purpose remembrest thou not that not long ago that as thou were in a
festfull day at the gate of thine house deuysynge one and other with a worcester
shypfull damoysell thy neighbor. And you saw a man come out of a tavern yt
went talking with another saying / I have spente thus much at y^ tavern /
and my wife shall drink no wine to night. And then thou called him to the and
asked y^ cause why / and he said to the. For this cause madame. For she has
such a condycyon that every time that I come from the tavern she asks me
how much I have spente / and if it be more tha^ xij. pens she will recompense
me by the sobernes of her mouth / and that yt I have spente to much and says
yt if we both should spend so largely / our craft should not tournysshe us
to our dyspence. Madame said I then of y^ I remember me well. and then she said
to me. Thou may know by ensamples ynowe y^ by nature women ben sobre / and
those yt be not they go out of kind / for there may not be a more lewder vice
in a woman than glo^o ny / for yt vice draws to him many other vices But y^
may well se of them great companyes and great prese in their chyrches at
sermons and at pardons holding their beedes in their hands say enge their
prayers. Madame said I yt is truth But these men say yt they go fresshe and
Ioly to show their beauty and to draw these me^ to their love Answer. That
should be a thing for ^o believe dear friend if one saw none there but young
women and fresshe* but y^ shalt se there for one yon ge woman.xx. or.xxx. old
of simple habyte to go and haunte ye places of devotion. And if devotion be
among women it should follow in y^ same wise yt charity fauteth not there /
for they vysyte y^ syke and comfort the^ / they run to pore people and se^
che th hospytalles and bury y^ deed bodies. Me seems yt these be y^ works of
women y^ which ben y^ ^oue rain traces yt god commands us to follow. Ma
dame ye say well / but there is an auctour says yt women by nature have ill
courage and be as children And for that cause children ben co^uersaunt with
them / and they with the children. Answer. Dou ghter if thou take heed to y^
nature of a child of his condycyon / he loves frendlynesse / and swetnes And
what thing is there in y^ world more swet ter and more amyable than is a
woman well set in order. Ha the cursed people of the deuylles condy cyon that
would have the welthe and virtue of meekness and benygnyte that is in women
turn to evil and in to reproffe. For though women love children / it comes
not of them by y^ vice of ygno raunce / but it comes of the swetnesse of their
co^dycyon / and if they be as children in benygnyte of that and in that they be
well counsaylled. For so as the gospel records. Ne said not our lord to his
appostles when they stryued among them which should be most great / and he
called a child and laid his hand on his heed and said. I say you certainly
that he that will hold him little and meke as a child shall be most hye. For
who that meketh him shall be enhaunced / and he y^ enhaun ceth him shall be put
low. Madame men does me great hurt of one proverb in latyne y^ they re
prove women by often times which says weep speak / and spynne / god has put
in woman. An swear. Forsothe sweet friend that word is true how be it that he
y^ trowed or said y^ in reprove / it was for them a good hap which by
speaking / weeping / and spynnynge have been saved / thus god put in them such
condycyons. And against them that so much reproves them in the condyon of
weeping. I say if that our savior Ihesu christ to whom no thought is hid
and which sees every courage had known that y^ teeres of women had come
only of fragylyte and symplenesse / the dygnyte of his great highness had not
ben so enclyned to yield himself teeres of y^ eyes of his worshypfull and
gloryons body by compassy on when he saw Mary Magdaleyne and Mar^ha her sister
weep for y^ death of their brother Lazare which he raised from the death. O
how many great graces god has done to women because of their teeres. He
dyspraysed not the teeres of the foresaid Mary Magdaleyne / but accepted them
in so much that he pardoned her of her sins / and by the merytes of them she
is in heaven gloryously Also he put not away those teeres of y^ wydowe which
wept for her deed sone y^ one bare to the earth. And our lord which is y^
well of all pity moved of compassyon for the teeres of her went to ask her /
wherefore wepest thou / and then ano ne he raised the child to y^ life. Other
great graces which should be long to tell god has done to many women for
their weeping and always does. wherefore I suppose that because of their
weeping and their devotion many of them ben saved and others also which they
pray for. Ne was not saint Austyne y^ glorious doctoure of y^ church converted
to the faith / because of weeping of his mother. For that same good lady wept
with out ceasing praynge to god y^ it might please hy^ to enlumyne the heart
of her sone which was at y^ time a paynyme and out of y^ believe from y^ light
of y^ faith. wherefore this good lady went often times to require saint
Ambrose y^ he should pray to god for him / and then my lady Reason said to me I
suppose said she y^ it should be a thing impossy ble y^ so many teeres of a
woman should be lost. O blessed saint Ambrose thou trowed not y^ so many teeres
of a woman should be set at naught / and that may be answer to men y^ reprove
women y^ because of their weeping / of a woman is y^ holy light in the front
of holy church which clereth and enlumyneth all the church. That is to know
saint Austyne. So let men speak no more of y^ as now. The same wise truly
god put the speaking in woman worshypped be he. For if speech had not ben put
in them they had been dome / yet contrary to y^ that the proverb which I
know not who made it at his pleasure in the reproffe of women / if language of
y^ woman had been so mo che reprouable and of so little auctoryte as some me^
would say / our lord Ihesu Christ had never vou ched saufe y^ so worshypfull a
mystery as y^ was of his glorious resurreccyon which was first announced by
woman as he himself commanded to the blessed Mary Magdaleyne to whom he
appeared first on Ester day that she should tell it and a^nounce it to his
dyscyples and to Peter. O blessed lord Ihesu loved be thou which with other
infy nyte gifts and graces y^ thou have done and given to woman kind would
that woman should be y^ berer of so high and worshypfull tidings well ou ght
these enuyous men to be still if they advise them well. It was a good hap y^
the woman of Cananee was so great a speker which did nou ght else but cry
after our lord Ihesu Christ going by the streets of Iherusalem saying. Have
mercy on me lord for my daughter is syke. But what did our lord god he in
whom al mercy ha bounded and haboundeth / and to whom it suffysed one only
word coming from the heart to have mercy. It seemed y^ he delyted in many
words of y^ mouth of y^ woman always perseueraunt in her prayer / but wherefore
did he it / It was to prove her steadfastness. For when he herd her lyken her
self to dogs / that seemed a little rudely for y^ she was of a strange law
and not of gods law She had no shame to speak well and wisely in saying.
Lord it is true y^ the little dogs eteth y^ crommes that falls from y^
table of their lord. O right wise woman who has tought the to speak so. Thou
gatest thy cause by thy language issued of good will / and well it seemed. For
our lord bare witness of his own mouth / retournynge than unto his
appostles saying to th^ym that he had not found such faith in Israel and
granted unto her request and desire. Ha who may sum suffysauntly the
worship in y^ kind of woman the which the enuyous men will so dysprayse
considering that in the heart of a little woman of the kynred of paynymes* god
found more faith than in all the bysshoppes and princes or priests / or in
the people of Jews y^ called themself the worthy people of god. In such a
manner spoke also longly and with great pleatynge and well for her the woman
Samarytane that was come to draw of the water / where she found Ihesu christ
sitting all weary. O thou blessed godhede conjoined to the worshypful body.
How might thou suffer thy holy mouth to open / and to hold the rain of
words of health to this poor and little woman sinner / ye which was not of
that law. Truly thou showed well yt thou dysdayned not ye devout kind of
women. Ne spoke not wisely the woman yt sat at the sermon of our lord Ihesu
Christ which was so embraced with his holy words / so as one says yt women
may not believe so soon / yet she spoke at yt time / and then she rose with a
great will and said. Blessed be yt womb that bare the and the pappes that thou
sowked. Thus thou may understand fair sweet friend that god has showed yt
truly he loves language to be well served. So that ought not to be reproffe
to them whereof so much welthe comes and so little evil / for no man sees
great preiudyce come of their language. And as to spynne / truly it is gods
will yt it be kyndely to them. For that office is necessary to gods service /
and to ye help of every creature reasonable / without the which work the
offices of the world should be maynteyned in great foulness and vnclen
nesse. So it is great shredenesse to put that in to y^ reproffe of woman that
ought to turn them to great honor and praysynge.

Xp^ine demands of Reason wherefore it is that women sytteth not in the syege
of pleadynge Capitulo.xj.
RIght high and worshypfull lady / your fair reasons satysfyeth right gretely
my thought. But yet tell me if it please you the truth / wherefore is that yt
these women hold no pleadynge in the court of Justice / nor they know not
of the causes ne does no Judgment. For these men say yt it is for they can
not / and that woman yt sytteth in ye place of Justice governs her shrewdely.
Daughter these ben but Iapes and thyn ges contryued of that y^ one list to say
of women But he that would demand the causes and rea sons of al things it
should be to much to answe re. How be it that Arystotle in in his book of pro
blemes yeldeth reason of many things / and in the same wise in the book of
propryetees of things ben contained ye beynges of diverse accyons naturalles.
But as to yt fair friend the same wise if it be demanded why god ordained not
y^ these men should do ye offices of women / and the women the offices of men.
But y^ answer is this ye as a wise lord well ordained stablyssheth his meyne
to do dyueuers offices one one thing / another another thing / as so that yt
one does another do the not. The same wise god has ordained man and woman to
serve / and also to help / comfort / and hol de company one with another
every of them in y^ he is ordained to do / and has given to every kind such
nature and inclynacyon as to do his office competently perteynynge to him /
how be it that man's nature abuses often times in yt that he ought to do. He
has given to men body strong power / and hardy to go and come and speak / and
for ye these men that have yt nature lerneth the laws / and ought to put them
in execucyon / to hold ye world in the order of Justice. And they be bound
yt in case yt any would not obey to ye laws establed by right and reason yt
they should make them to obey by force of their bodies and by puyssaunce of
arms and that the women may not do. For how be it that god has given them
understanding yet they may not use it in yt manner for their honest. For it
were not conuenyent that they should goo sewe them in Judgment as these men
done. For there ben ynowe y^ does it / for what needs three men to lift up a
fardell yt twain may lightly be re it away / yet if some men would say yt
women have not suffycyent understanding for to learn the laws / the contrary
is made open by experyence / and it appears of many women / as it shall be
said here after ye which have been right great phylosophres and have learned
more subtle science and more higher than the laws written by men. And also who
would purpose that they have not natural wit in deed of polycye and of
governance. I give ye ensample of many great may stresses that have been in
time past / and also in thy time / to y^ entente y^ thou sholdest know the
better my trou the of them that have been wydowes which have kept good
governance in all their doings af ter the death of their housbandes / which
gives open experyence yt a woman that has understand dynge is couenable in all
things.

Here it speaks of ye Empress Nyehole and after of diverse noble queen's and
pryncesses of France. Capitulo.xij.
TEll me I pray the where was ever that king of great understanding in the
deed of polycye of gouernaun ce to keep sovereign Justice / and al so of high
magnyfycence in living that is reode of the right noble Empress Nychole. For
not withstanding that in these countrees great / large / and diverse that she
had the rewle of had been kings of great fame called Pharaons of whom she was
descended. This lady was she that first began to live in her royalme after
laws and worldely polycy / and she destroyed the rude manners of living of
those countrees y^ she had in governance. And these auctours say y^ speak th
of her that she amended y^ rudeness of her people. And she was herytoure of
the foresaid Pharaons / not only of y^ little country / but of the roy alme of
Arabee of Ethyope and of Egypt / and of y^ I Will Maromye which is right long
and large / and habundaunte of all manner of goods which is closed with the
flode of Nyle which she go uerned by meruayllous prudence / what shall I say
more of this lady which had all this welthe but that she was so wise and of
such governance y^ holy scripture speaks of her great virtue. She herself
ordained laws and ryghtes to govern her people. She habounded in great
noblesse and richesse more than any man in those days / and she was profounde
and expert in scryptures and in scyen ces. And she had so high a courage that
she dysdeyned to be married ne would that no man should have, knowledge of her
body.

Of the queen of France which was named Fredegonde. Ca. xiij.
OF ladies of wise governance I might tell the enough. The queen of France
Fredegonde that had been y^ wife of king Charles notwithstanding she was
cruel out of natural law of woman ^et after the death of her houfba^ de she
governed the royalme of France by great prowe^se which was at that time in
right great balaunce. For there was left her a sone without mo herytours of
his fader the which was called Clothary^ / so there was great deuy^yon among
the lords because of governance and upon y^ there fell great war to y^
royalme / yet this lady held contynually her sone between her arms. And she
called and assembled their lords in a counsel and said lords so here your
king / ye have not for gotten the truth / which always has been in France
/ and now despise him not though he be a child / for by y^ help of god he
shall increase and when he shall come to age he shall know his good friends and
shall reward them after their deserts. So I pray you dysheryte hy^ not wrong
fully. And as for me I make you certain that he shall reward them that well
and truly maynteyneth him that they shall be the better ever after. And so
this queen appeased y^ lords thrughe the which sad governance she did so
much that she drew her sone out of his enemies hands and nourysshed him
herself till that he was of age and by her he gate the crown and the worcester
ship of the royalme which had never ben done but by the great prudence of
her.

And in the same wise one may say of the right wise / and in all cases good
the noble queen Blaunche mother unto Saint Lowes / which so nobly and prudently
governed y^ ^oyalme of Frail ^o ryll her sone were ripe of age / which was
never better governed by man / and also when he was come to his age by y^
proffe of her wise gouernan^ ^e she was always thyefe of his counsay^e / and no
thing was done without her and also she sewed her ^one always in battle and
in war / other n^ out nombre I might tell y^ to this purpose which I let
pass for shortness of time / yet sith y^ we be entered to speak of ladies of
France without goyenge ferther to seek strange stories. Thou saw in thy
time y^ noble queen of France Jane wedowe of king Charles the fourth / yfthou
ha ne it in mind. Advise the great welthe that y^ fame of this noble lady
witnesses as much in no table ordinance of her court as in manner of ly
uynge and in sovereign Justice. It was never spoken of prince that maynteyned
and kept better in his land y^ was pertaining to him tha^ this lady did.
And the noble lady that was wedded to the duke of Orlynaunce sone of king
Phylyp resembled her well / the which in her wydo whode in the which she was
long time maynteyned Justice in her country so ryghtfully that no man might do
better. Also the queen of France dame Blaunche which was wife to king Johan
maynteyned her land and governed by great order of right and Justice. And what
might one say of the worshypfull and wise lady the duchess of Aniou some time
daughter to the holy Charles de Bloys duke of Brytayne / and after was wife to
the younger brother of y^ king of France. The which duke was called sith king
of Ce^yl how held she under the rod of Justice the lands and countrees / as
well of Prouance as of other that she governed and held in her hand for the
right noble children while y^ they were young / where was ever clamoure or
playnte hard of wrong done that this noble lady should do. In the same wise
the Countess de la march lady and countess of Uandome and of Castres which
yet is on live / what might one say of her governance would it not be known
how and in what manner her I^ styce was maynteyned / and she herself as a
good and wise lady took head thereto curyously. And what should I say more / one
might say in oughe of gre te ladies / means / and less / in the same wise
how they did that y^ was perteynynge to them who so will take heed. It seems
me that one might se that these noble ladies in their wydo whode have sustained
and suffycyently well kept Iurysdyc^yon and right in their lordeshyppes as
their housbandes did that time living and as well loved of their subjects
and better. For be it no doubt nor dyspleasaunce to men y^ there ben many
women y^ have better understanding than some of these men have / of the which
if their housbandes had byleued them that they had had such understanding as
they had it might have turned them to great profit / yet though these women
communely meddle them not of the deed of Judgment ne pronounce the causes of
parties it is to them no force. For by so much they have the less charge to
their souls and to their bodies. And how be it that it is a thing necessary
for to punysshe y^ evil doers and to do right unto every man there ben men
ynowe and such officers that they might wyss he y^ they had never known more
than their moders. For if they go all the right way / god knows of the
which if there be any fraud their punycyon is not little.

Of altercacyons and arguments of Xp^ine to dame Reason. Ca. xiiij.
CErtes madame ye say right well / and your reasons ben right well sow^yn ge in
my courage. But yet though it be so of their understanding is that proved
that women have feeble bodies / tender and not mighty in the deeds of strength
/ and by nature they ben cowardes / and this is one thing that makes much
less the degree and auctoryte of the kind of woman / by the Judgment of men.
For they will say that in so much as a body is more imperfyte in every thing
so much is it abredged and made less of his virtue. And by that that thou
folowest it / it is y^ less for to praise. Answer. Dear daughter this
following is not good nor to be sustained. For without fail one sees often
times y^ when nature has restrained any thing from a body y^ she has
fourmed / she rewards yt body in some other thing of as much valor / as
thus. If a woman be imparfyte of shap / or of beauty / or of im potencye / or
feebleness of members it is sign y^ she recompenseth her with some other thing
that is more worth than yt she has berafte her. Ensample as it is said of the
great phylosophre Arystotle which was right lewd of shap / one eye higher
than that other and of strange vysage / yet though he had any deformyte of
body or of shap / true ly nature recompensed him right gretely in
understanding retentyfe and feeling as it appears by this antentyke wrytynges
so yt recompensynge of so great wit was of more valor tha^ though he had a
body like unto Absolon. In the same wise one may say of the great Emperor
Alexandre yt was but little of body yet had he gre te virtue in his courage as
it appeared and so it is by many others. So I promise the fair love yt the
great and strong body causes not the virtuous and mighty courage / but it
comes of a virtuous stre^ gethe and manners yt is given of god / which graun
teth to nature to leave to some creatures reasonables more tha^ to some others /
for it is a gift hyd in the understanding and in courage / and not only in
the strength of body nor of members thus we know often times by that y^ great
men ynowe and of strong members we se they be latches faylyn ge and recrayed /
and of others that have been little and fe ble of body y^ ben hardy and full
strong / and the same wise it is of other virtues / but as to y^ hardynes and
such strength / god and nature has done enough for women in y^ that he
has given them Im potencye. For at y^ leest they ben agreably excused by yt
defaute in so much yt they do not these horry ble crueltees y^ wrongs and the
great greues and extorcyons the which are done to y^ world bycau se of
strength / so they shall not have such punyssh mentes as such case requires /
and it should have been right good for y^ souls of man y^ they might have
passed the pilgrimage of this world in the feeble body of woman. And truly I
say and come again to my purpose y^ if nature had not given great strength
of members to a woman's body y^ she recompenseth her right well in that y^ there
is given to her a more virtuous inclynacyon / yt is to love god / and to be
dredefull naturally to do co^ trary to his commandments / and those that do
otherwise does out of kind. But always advise the dear daughter how it
seems y^ god list to show all degrees to men though y^ they say y^ for as
much as women have not all so great stren gthe and hardynesse corporal as
communely these men have y^ they ought not believe y^ it is for that that al
bodily strength and hardynesse be shytte fro the kind of woman. It appears
by that that in many women there is showed great courage / strength and
hardynesse to undertake all manner of strong things and to accheue them like
as did these great men and solem^ne conquerours of who^ there is made so great
mencyon in wrytynges as I shall remember y^ here after by ensample. Fair
daughter now I have ordained and arrayed for y^ a pytte great and large. And I
have borne out upon my sholdres right great burdens of rubrysshe of the earth.
And it is time yt thou set in these great and strong stones for the
foundement of y^ walls of the cite of Ladies. Now take thy truell and thy
plumbe with thy line and make y^ ready to work strong ly y^ masonry by great
dylygence. For se here a gre te and a large stone which I will y^ it be y^
first set in the foundement of thy cite / and know it yt na ture herself
has pourtrayed it by the signs of Astrologye for to be allowed in this work.
Now draw the a little abacke and I shall cast him on.

Of the queen Semyramys. Ca. xv.
SEmyramys was a woman of right great virtue in deed of great and vycto ryous
courage / in vndertakynge of entrepryses / and in hauntynge of de des of arms
/ the which was so excellent that the people there the which were pay nymes
said that for the great might and strength that she had both upon the land
/ and upon the sea / that she was sister unto the great god Iupyter and
daughter to the ancient god Saturnus which they called the god of the land
and of the sea. This lady was the wife of king Nynus yt named y^ cite of
Nynyue of his name. And he was so great a couqueroure that by the help of his
wife Semyramys which likewise as he rode always with him in harnoys / he
conquered y^ great Babylone and all the land of Assyrye and other countrees
many. It happened that the lady beyn ge yet enough in young age Nynus her
housba^ de was slain with an arowe at the assault of a cite / yet when the
obsequyes and the solompnytees was couenably done of the foresaid king / the
la die never left y^ excercyse of arms / but more than before by right great
courage took upon her to go uerne by strength the lordshyppes / royalmes / and
lands which her housbande and she had conquered with the sword / which
lands and royalmes she kept right notably by great discyplyne of che ualrye.
So and in such manner she haunted and ac complysshed so many of notable works
that no man in vygure and in strength surmounted her This lady in whom
habounded right hardy cou rage / ne doubted no pain / ne was not aferde of no
perils / but put herself to all things by such excellence y^ she overcame
all her adversaries y^ had trowed to put her in her wydowhode out of all her
co^questes. By y^ which she was so dredde and doubted in arms yt she kept
not only y^ countres before conquered but with a right great army went upon y^
land of Ethyope which she overcame by great strength and put it under
subieccyon and Joined it to her Empire. From thens she wen te with a great
puyssaunce in to Inde / and assailed strongly the men of Inde / to whom there
was never man approached to make them war. So she overcame them and put them
under her subieccyon / and sith she went ferther upon their coun trees so
much that to say shortly that she conque red all the oryent which is called
the Eest part of y^ world which were right great and mighty. This Semyramys
enforced and made against y^ cite of Babylone which was founded by Nem broche
and the gyauntes and was set in the field of Semyaar great and of meruayllous
strength and cyrcuyte / and so this lady made it more stron ger of diverse
defenses / and let make about lar ge and deep dykes. Semyramys was in a time
in her chamber and maidens about her k^mynge her heed. It happened that
tidings came y^ one of her royalmes began to rebel against her. So she lyfted
up herself and swear by her puyssaunce that the other tresse of her heed
should never be tressed which was vntressed till the time that she had venged
her of that injury and put again that land in to her subieccyon. So she made
an^ ne all her men to arm them in a great multitude and went upon these
rebels / and by meruaylous strength put them under subieccyon / and thus
they and all her other subjects dradde her that never sith they durst not
move a foot to rebel. Of the which noble deed and couragyous long time after
gave witness a great image made of brass gylte / rychely lift up upon an
high pyller in Ba bylone which represented a pryncesse holding and sword in
her hand / and one of the sides of her heed tressed and y^ other not. This
queen founded and edyfyed of new diverse cytees and strong places and acco^
plysshed many other great deeds so much yt there was never written of no man of
so great courage ne of more meruaylous works worthy to be had in mind. It is
truth that many blames her and so she ought of right if she had been of our
law of that yt she took her own sone to housbande yt she had gotten of Nynus
her lord but the causes that moved her to that were.ij. pryncypally / that one
that she would not have had in her Empire none other lady crowned save only
herself y^ which should have been if her sone had wedded any other lady / that
other cause was that her seemed no man worthy to have her to his wife save only
her ow ne sone / yet was this cause y^ gretter thrughe whi the she was somewhat
excused in y^ that she was not of our law / for y^ people lived after y^ law
of nature where one durst do to another without mysse taking that which his
heart perceived / or desired. For it is no doubt that if she had thou ght that
it had been evil or that any blame should fall to her thereof but that she had
so great and so high courage / and loved so much worship / she would never
have done it. Now is the first stone set in the foundement of our cite. Now
it is con uenyent from hens forth to set sewyngly stones to the quantyte for
to auaunce our building.

Of the Amozones. Capitulo.xvi.
A Land there is toward the end of Europe after the great see that hold th
in all the world / which land is called Syche or Sychye. It happened sometime
that y^ country by force of war was despoyled of all y^ young men dwell lynge
in that country. And when the women of that place saw that they had lost
their housbandes / their brethren / and their kynnesmen. And there was none
left but old men and children / they assembled by great courage and took
counsel between them and aduysed the conclusyon that from that time forth
they would maynteyne their lordshyppes without any subieccyon of me^ and made
such a commandment that no manner of man should enter in to their
iurysdyc^yon* yet for to have lygnage they should go in to y^ nerte country by
a certain season of the year / and then should they turn home again in to
their coun tree. And if they were delivered of any sons they should send them
unto their faders. And if they were maid children they would nourysshe them
themself to perform their ordinance. Then they chose.ij. of the most noble
ladies among them to be crowned queen's of which one was called Lampheto /
that other Marpasye. This do ne they chased out of their country all y^
mankind that was left both young and old. And after yt they armed them and
with a great battle all of ladies and of maidens went upon their enemies and
wasted all their land by fire and by armrs / and there was none that might
resyst them and to speak shortly they avenged the death of their friends full
notably. And by this way began the women of Syche or of Sychye to bear arms /
y^ which sith were called Amozonnes / that is as much to say as vnpapped. For
that they had such a manner y^ the noble women when they were little maidens
their lift pappes were cut of by a certain craft / for y^ they should not
be combred to bear the shield. And to them that were not gentylwome^ their
right pappes were cut away to shote the more easily. So they went so much
delytynge in the craft of arms that they encrea sed by forte right much
their country and their royalmes in so much that their fame went all about
as I have here before touched to ye. Then they went in to diverse countrees
each of them ledynge a great host and did so much y^ they conquered a great
part of Europe and of the country of Ayfe and put under subieccyon many diverse
countres and Joined them to their lordshyppes and founded many cytees and
towns / and in like wise in Ayse in the cite of Ephese which is and long
time has been of great renown. Of these two queen's Marpasye dyed first in a
battle the^ the Amozones crowned her daughter in her place a noble maid and a
fair which was named Synoppe which had so great courage and high y^ all y^
days of her life she dysdeyned not to be cou pled to no man but remained still
a maybe al her life. So she had none other love nor charge but only in the
excersyse of arms / and in y^ she had so great pleasunce that she might not be
satysfyed to assail and conquer lands and royalmes / and by her her mother
was greatly venged in so much that those of that country were slain and put to
the sword and wasted all the land and conquered.

Of ye queen of Amozonye Thamaris. Ca. xvii.
THus as thou may here how the Amozones began and maynteyned long time
their lordshyppes right worshypfully. Of the which they made queen's by
succession one after another if right worshypful ladies which to name by row
it might turn the reders to great noyaunce. So it shall suffyse to speak of
y^ pryn cypalles of which there was one called Thama rye right hardy wise and
sage by whose wit cautele and strength. Cyrrus the strong and mygh ty king
of Perse was overcome and taken / whi che had conquered the great Babylone /
and in the same wise a great part of y^ world. So he would after many other
conquestes that he had done goo upon the land of Amozones in hope to have put
them under his subieccyon / whereof it happened as this same wise / y^ queen
knew by her spy es that this same king Cyrrus would come upon her with so
great strength of people that ought suffycyently to conquer all the world /
she aduysed her that it should be impossyble to dyscomfyte their host by
strength of arms. So it was con uenyent to labor by cautele. And then she
went this worshypfull capytayne when she knew y^ Cyrrus was entered before in
to her land / y^ which she suffered and let him pass before in to her land
without any gain saying / she made arm all her damoyselles / and by right
good ordinance put them in diverse busshmentes upon y^ moun tayues and in y^
woods where that Cyrrus might pass none other way. There abode this Tha marys
right stylly with all her hoostes unto y^ ty me that Cyrrus and his people were
come in to y^ strayte ways in forestes / and among y^ craggy roches where
thrughe he must needs pass. And then the lady when that she saw time made
hastily to blow a trompette. And then this Cyrrus was right sore abashed
which took no head to himself / and suddenly saw him assailed in every
part. For these ladies that were upon the moun taynes threw down great
roches upon them which might go another forward ne back war de for the
dyuersyte of the country / and some of y^ busshmentes were before which slew
y^ people down right fervently y^ would have issued out of the strayte
passages and might not gather them together for that other busshment y^ was
behind them. So they were smyten a sondre with strong roches to the death all
the people / and Cyrrus taken and by the commandment of the queen left alive
and his barons with him / whom she made to come before her in to a pauylyon
after y^ dyscomfyture / and for the great wrath that she had to him for one of
her maidens that he had slain by y^ way before / the would have no mercy of
Cyrrus nor of his barons / but made to smite of their hedes before him. And
after that she said to him Cyrrus which by thy crueltees were never satys fyed
with y^ blood of man now thou may drink at thy will. And then she made to
sinyte of his heed and cast it in to a basyne / in to and which she had made
to gather the blood of his lords. Fair dou ghter and my dear friend these
things I bring in remembrance for that affermeth the matter y^ I have told
the of. Notwithstanding that thou know them well / and thyselfe have
rehearsed them another time in thy book of y^ mutacyon of fortune and in y^ same
wise in thine epistle of Othea. So I shall say to the more yet here after
following.

How the strong Hercules and Theseus went upon the Amozones and how the.ij.
ladies Me nal^pe and ypolyte had almoost overcome them Capitulo.xviij.
WHat should I say more of ye strength of their bodies or by the prowe^se of
arms of these ladies of Amozonye / which by all countrees were dredde and
doubted anon to y^ of land gre ce which was far thens. And y^ tidings wen
^e how these ladies seized not to destroy lands and wasted the countres if
they would not yield them right soon unto them / and how they to withstand
their enemies. Of this all Greece was aferde doubting that the lands of them
should stretche in short tnme unto their country. Then there was in Greece in
the flower of his you the Hercules the meruayllous strong man whi che in his
time did more meruaylles of strength than ever man did that was borne of
woman / of whom is made mencyon in hystoryes. For he fought with gyauntes and
Lions / with serpents and monstres right mer^ayllous and had of all them the
vyctory. And to say shortly he was so strong y^ never man was like him in
strength except Sampson le forte. This Hercules said y^ it were not good to
abide till these ladies of Amo ^onye came upon them / but it were much better
to go upon them first / then for y^ they let ordeyne a great nauye of ships
and assembled a* great com pany of young lusty men for to go thither in great
haste / when Theseus the worshypfull and wise man which was king of Athenes
knew this tidings he said that he should not go without him. And so he
assembled a great host with this host of Hercules / and when they were all
assem bled they put them in to the sea toward the coun tree of Amozonye. And
when they approached the country Hercules notwithstanding his meruay lous
strength and hardynesse and his great host of people durst not take the port
by day ne to co me down upon the land / so much the strength of these
amozones was blown about in diverse countrees that it were marvel to say and
believe if there were not so many hystoryes bring witness of them yt there
has been so many worcester shypfull men overcome by women. So Hercules and his host
abode till the dark night was co me. And then when the hour was come that eve
ry mortal creature ought to take his rest and sleep he and his host lepte a
land and entered in to the country / and began to set fire in cytees and
towns and slew all the women yt took no head of their coming. In the mean
time great was y^ cry among y^ people / then they were not slow to run to
their harnoys al manner of women as those that were most hardyest to run
among y^ people toward y^ see side upon their enemies. And then there reigned
upon these Amozones the queen Orthya y^ which was a lady of right great
worthynesse and conquered many lands. And this was the mother of y^ worshypfull
queen Pantasylya of whom shall be made mencyon he re after. This queen Orthya
was crowned after ye cheualrous queen Anthyoppe y^ which maynteyned y^
Amozones in great dys^yplyne of arms and of cheualrye / and was passing wise
and hardye in her time. So this queen Orthya herd this tidings how the
Greeks were come in by night fighting on the land and always sleynge the
people. Then it was to deem yt she was wroth and thought to be avenged upon
their male talent / and anon manasynge them that she dredde not commanded to
make ready all her battle / there one might se all the ladies busy to run to
their har noys and assembled them about their queen / and by this time was the
clear day come. And then this queen armed herself and abode to put in order
her bataylles and her hosts. Then were there.ij. worshypful maidens of
sovereign strength of cheualrye and hardynesse and wise above many others. Of
which y^ one was called Manalyppe and that other Ipolyte / and they were right
nyghe kynne to the queen / and they abode not only the co mynge of their queen
/ but as fast as they might be armed / their speres in their hands / their
shel des of strong elemphant hanging upon their necks mounted upon their
well rennynge cour sers went right fast rennynge toward y^ port / and with
great hete as those y^ were supprysed with wrath berynge low their speres bare
thrughe y^ best of y^ greeks. That is to know Manalyppe toward Hercules / and
Ipolyte to Thesens / but whether they had wrath or no it apered well / for
notwithstanding y^ great strength hardynesse and great courage of them so
strongly these maidens hurt them / and by so great encountre each of them
beat their knight / and they also fell on yt other side / but as soon as they
might they recovered them self and ran upon them with good swerdes. O what
worship ought these ladies to have y^ by such.ij. women were beten.ij. of ye
best knights yt were in all ye world / and this thing should not be credyble
to be true but y^ so many antentyke doc tours bears witness of it / these
same doctors meruayllynge themself of this adventure in excusing specially
Hercules co^syderynge his outragyous strength says yt he was beholdynge to
his horse yt lepte from ye great hurt of y^ stroke / for they trowed not if
they had been on ^ote but they should have been thrown down / these.ij.
knights were ashamed to be thus bete^ of these.ij. maidens. Notwtstandynge
these maidens fought with their swerdes against these.ij. knights strongly and y^
battle endured long * yet at y^ last and what me^ uayle yt these maidens were
taken / for there ought not to be like strokes between the^. Of this pryse they
thought them gretely honored. Hercules and Thesens were gladder tha^ and they
had taken a cite So they held them in their ships with them to refresshe
them and to unarm them and thought that they had well employed their will. And
when they saw them unarmed and that they we re so fair and so semely then
doubled their Joy for they took never pray y^ was to them so agreeable / and so
they kept them with great Joy and plea saunce. Then came the queen upon the
greeks with a great host / and when y^ tidings came to her that these two
maidens were taken she was mer uayllously sorrowful / yet for doubt that they
shol de do any harm to these ladies that were taken if she went upon them she
rested as then / and sent to them by.ij. of her baronnesses and badde them to
put to their fynaunce for these.ij. ladies as mo che as it pleased them and she
would send it unto them. Hercules and Theseus received these messageres with
great worship and answered them courtoysly / and if the queen would make a
small peace with them / and both she and her baronnesses should promise that
they should never arm them against the Greeks but to be their good friends And
the Greeks would promise them in the same wise that they would yield home
these.ij. ladies all quyte without having any other ransom save their
harnoys only / for that they would ha ue for worship and remembrance for ever
of this vyctory that they had upon these ladies. Then y^ queen for the desire
that she had to have these.ij. damoyselles again / whom that she loved so mo
che was constrained to make a peace with y^ greeks. So was this matter
entreated and accorded between them y^ the queen came to them all unarmed with
right a fair company of ladies and maidens in so rich array that they saw
never such before / the greeks met with them and fee sted them and made sure
the peace between them and there was much Joy made / yet not for that it noyed
gretely Thesens to deliver Ipolyte for he was smyten with great love. So
Hercules prayed and required the queen so much for him that she granted
Thesens to take Ipolyte unto his wife and so should led her in to his country
/ And then were the weddynges made worshypful ly / and after that the Greeks
departed / and Thesens led home ypolyte which had a sone after ward that
was called Ipolytus which was a knight of great worship and a chosen man amon
ge many. And when it was known in greece that that the peace was made they had
never gretter Joy. For there was never no thing that they doubted more.

Of the queen Pantassylea how she went to the socours of Troy. Ca. xix.
Long time lived this noble queen Orthya / and in great prosperyte hell de the
land of Amozonye and much increased their puyssaunce and she was right old
when she dyed. Then they crowned after her her noble daughter the right
worshypfull Pantassylle / which above all others bare the crown of wit / of
price / of wisdom and worthynesse. This lady was ne uer weary to bear arms ne
to fight / and by her their lordshyp was increased more than ever it was. For
she tested never time. So she was so much dredde of her enemies that there
durst none abide her. This lady was of so high courage that she dysdeyned
never to be coupled to man but was a maid all her life. In her time was the
great war of the Greeks against the Troyans / and for the great fame that
floured thrughe all y^ worl de of the right great worship and knyghthode of
Ector of Troy as of the most manly of the worl de and of the most excellent
in all graces. As it is the usage that gladly every friend would desire to
vysyte his like. Pantassylle which was the thyefe of all ladies of y^ world /
and which that herd say contynuelly so great goodness of this worshypful
Ector she loved him worshypfully of right great love / and above all things
she desired to se him / and for to fulfill this desire she departed from her
royalme in great haste with right a noble company of ladies and damoyselles of
great prowess and right rychely armed. So she took her way toward Troy which
was not little / but right far of / yet it thought not long / nor
trauaylable to the heart y^ loves well / and when they ca me to y^ port of
Troy there aryued this noble pa^ tassylle / and yet it was to late for there
she found Ec tor deed which was slain by Achylles lyenge a wait for him in
y^ battle / in whom perysshed y^ flower of all knyghthode of Troy. Then this
que ne Pa^tassylle was received with great worship of king Pryamus and of the
queen Eccuba his wife / and of all their lords / but yet she had her heart
always on that y^ she saw never Ector on live / which caused her yt there
might nothing reioy ce her / yet ye king and ye queen which without ceasing
sorowed for y^ death of their sone Ector said to her yt sith they might not
show him to her on live yt they would show him to her deed. Then they led
her in to y^ temple where they had made his sepulture y^ most noble and most
rich y^ ever any hystory made mency on of / for it was made in a chapel right
rich all of gold and precious stones before the high awter of their gods /
and the re sat ye body of Ector in a chair which was so bawmed and covered
y^ it seemed vysybly y^ it was on live holding a sword in his hand semynge al
way yt his fyers vysage manased the Greeks clo thed in a garment great and
large all of Tyssue embrowdred with precious stones traylynge on y^ earth and
covered y^ parties bynethe which were plunged in fine bawme / which yielded
meruayllous swetnes / there ye Troyans held this body in great worship as it
had been one of their gods with light of ware clearly bre^nynge / and there was
ry chesse without nombre / and thither they led this queen Pantassylle the which
as soon as y^ chapel was opened and saw the body of Ector kneled her dow ne
saluynge him as he had been on live / and after she went nere and in beholdynge
y^ vysage she began to say such words weeping. Ha flower and excellence of
all knyghthode of all the world / the ground and y^ ending of all
worthynesse / who may no we from hense forth auaunte him after you of any
prowess / or to stretche a ^werde sith y^ now is quenche^ the light and
ensample of so great highness. Alas what hour was borne the arm so cursed
that durst by his outragyous cou rage despoyle the world of so great a
treasoure. O right noble prince wherefore is my fortune so contrary that I had
not ben so nyghe you when the false traytoure that slew you made such a wait
upon your person. If I had been there I would have waited upon your person
myself / yet and ye were on live he would believe your death should be
revenged. Ha what great wrath and sorrow that mine heart feleth to se you thus
without puyssaunce to speak to me whom I desy red so much to se. Now sith it
may none other wise be. I swear by all the high gods that we believe on and
promise well and afferme to you my dear lord y^ while my life shall endure
your death shall be venged by me upon the Greeks. Thus knelynge before y^ body
Pantassylle spoke so high that y^ great company of lords and ladies of the
che^alrye that were there might here her. she and all wept for pity and could
full evil depart from thens / yet at the last kissing the han de with which
he held the sword she departed saying. worthynesse of knyghthode which seemed
you well in ydur life when y^ representacyon of your body bears you witness
of so great excel lence / and anon she departed weeping right tenderly / and
as soon as she might she armed her / and lepte out of y^ cite with her host
right nobly arrayed against the Greeks that were at y^ syege. And to say
shortly of that y^ she did there without fail if she had lived long she
would have done ma ny meruaylles of arms. So she would not tour ne homewarde
but would fight with Pyrrus y^ was y^ sone of Achylles and was a right manly
kny ght of his hand. and so much she beat hy^ and wounded him y^ he was
almost slain. And with great pay ne he was rescowed of his people and as a
deed man was borne out of y^ field / and the Greeks trowed never that he should
escape / wherefore they made much sorrow / and if she had hate to the fader
she showed it well to y^ sone. Nevertheless to ma ke short the tale when she
had done there so much of arms by diverse Iourneys with her people y^ the
Greeks were underneath Pyrrus y^ was amended of his wounds had meruayllous
shame and sorrow that he was thus beten so foul of this woman. So he ordained
his people of his host which were of right great prowess that they should
attend to none other thing in y^ battle save only to enclose Pantassyllee
between them and to put her from her people / for he would that she were slain
by his own hand and he promised them if they might do thus to give them great
gifts. This thing to accomplysshe y^ people of Pyrrus put great pain long
time or they might happen to do it / ^or they dred so much to come nyghe her
for y^ great strokes that she gave, yet not for that to come to the conclusyon
they applied it as those y^ took no head to other thing / and saw in a
Iournay where she did meruayllous deeds of arms that it might nere hand
suffyse to Ector if he had been on live / that by reason she ought to be weary /
and there they enclosed her among them / and departed her from her battle /
and so sore oppressed her ladies that they might not socoure her / and that
notwithstanding by right meruayllous virtue and strength she would have
defended her / and then they brake her harnoys and smote of a quarter of her
helm. Then Pyrrus when he saw y^ heed bare by which her yelowe here appeared
gave her so great a stroke y^ he clefte in sondre y^ heed and the brain. And
thus ended the worshypfull Pantassylle of whom it was great loss to the
Troyans and great sorrow to all her country which made great sorrow and
lamentacyon For never sith there reigned none such upon the Amozones. And
then they bare the body home in to her own country. And thus as thou may
here began the royalme of women and was maynteyned by great puyssau^ce / which
endured by y^ space of.viij. hundred years as thou thyselfe may note and se /
and read by the hystoryes of nom bre which may run sith their beginning
till after the conquest of great Alexandre y^ conquered al y^ world. In which
time it appeared y^ then en dured y^ reygne and lordshyp of y^ Amozones. For y^
hystory of him makes mencyon how he went in to that royalme and how he was
received of the queen and o^ the ladies: So was this Alexa^dre long time after
the destruccyon of Troy / and y^ same wise more than.iiij. hundred years after
the foundacyon of Rome which was long time af ter y^ said destruccyon of
Troy. wherefore if thou will take the leysoure to bring together the hy stories
and to calcule the times and the nombre thou shalt find that this royalme and
the lord ship of women endured right a long space / and thou may note that
in all the lordshyppes y^ has been in the world which by the space of so much
time has endured one shall not find more nota ble princes nor in more
quantyte ne that has do ne more natable deeds than were done by y^ queen's and
the ladies of that realm.

Of Cenobye queen of Palmurenes. Ca. xx.
THere were not worshypfull women only of these Amozones / for y^ valyau^t
Cenobye ought not to be of less fame and worthynes y^ was queen of palmurenes
a lady of noble blood / issued of Ptholomees kings of egypt. Of this lady
was apperynge all her youth the great cou rage and knyghtly inclynacyon that
she had. For as soon as she was strengthed there might no man keep her but
that she would leave the dwellyn ge in the towns closyd / in palayces / or in
royal chambres but to enhabyte the woods and forestes in which places she
had her sword gurde abou te her and darts by great dylygence tosle the wild
beestes / as hertes and hyndes. And after that began to fight with Lions / with
beres / and with many other wild beestes / and she assailed them without dread
and overcame them meruayllously. This lady held it for no pain to lie in the
woods do ubtynge nothing upon the hard earth / in hot and in cold / ne it
grieved her not to trace y^ strayte passages of y^ forestes / grave upon y^
mountains / dyke in the valays / rennynge after y^ bestes. This lady
dyspraysed all carnal love / and long time refused marriage as she yt would
keep her vyrgynyte / yet at y^ last constrained by her kynne she took to
housbande the king of Palmurenes Of great beauty and soueraynly of body and of
vysa ge was this noble Cenobye which set but little by her beauty. And fortune
was so favorable to her inclynacyon yt she consented to have an housbande
corespondent enough to her condyons. This king which was a knyghtly man
had great lust to conquer by strength of arms all the oryent and ye
Empyres about him. In this same time Ualeryan Auguste y^ held y^ Empire of
Rome was taken of Sapore king of Perce. This king of Palmurenes assembled his
great host and Cenobye made no great force of the fresshnes of her beauty /
but dysposed her to suffer the travail of arms with her housbande / and to
were harnoys / and to be partycypant with him in all labors in y^ exercise of
knyghthode. This king that was named Ordonet stabled Herod his sone of
another woman to conduyte one par te of his host taking head against the said
Sa pore king of Perce which that time occupied Mesopotame / after he ordained
that on yt other part should go upon him Cenobye his wife with another great
part of his host. And he himself should go in that other part with the
third par te of his host. So they departed in such ordinance. But what
shall I say / the end of this matter was such so as thou may se by y^
hystoryes that this lady Cenobye so myghtely and by such hardynesse and virtue
gate diverse bataylles against this king and had the vyctorye / and by her
prowess put Mesopotame under the subieccyon of her housbande / and besyeged
Sopore the king of Perce in his own cite and took him by strength with his
Concubynes / and there she co^ quered great haboundaunce of richesse. After
this vyctorye it happened yt her housbande was slain by one of his own kynnes
men for envy that he reigned upon him / yet this lady by noble courage took
the possessyon of the Empire for her children which were yet but young / and
put her self in the sea royal as Empress and took thereof the gouernannct by
great virtue and charge and to say all / so she governed by so great wit and
dyscyplyne of knyghthode / that Galeryan and Clau dyan Emperoures of Rome
thought that they oc cupyed a part of the oryent for ye Romans dur ste never
undertake any thing against her. And the same wise the Egypcyans ne y^
Arabyens ne those of Armony but doubted her puyssaunce and her great
fyer^enesse and held them content to keep that they had and meddle no
ferther. This lady was worshypped of her princes and of her people obeyed and
loved and of her knights dred and doubted / for when she rode with her people
as often times it happened she would never speak to them of her host but her
harnoys on her back and her helm on her heed / nor to no battle made her
armure to be led in charyot. Notwithstanding other kings used that guyse.
And always she rode upon a well rennynge courser / and often times she would
ride unknown to espy her enemies before her folk. This noble lady Cenobye
with yt that she passed all other knights of the world yt time in dyscyplyne
and craft of knyghthode. Also she passed all other ladies in noblesse and good
condycyons of honest life / and right sobre soueraynely in all her demeanynge
yet notwithstanding she made often times great feestes un to her barons and to
strangers / and all magnyfycence was holden with her / and royal largess in
all things / and great gifts and fair / and could well draw people to her
love and benyuolence / she was always of a sovereign chastyte. For she kept her
not only from other men but in the same wise she would not lie with her
housbande / but for having of issue / and that she showed openly by that that
she would not lie with him after yt she felt her with child / and to that
entente that all that appeared outward should afferme that yt was inward / she
would never that any vycyous man should haunte her court / and she would yt al
they that would desire to stand in her good grace were virtuous and well
condycyoned / and she did great honor to people after their worthy nesse and
virtues / and not only for their richesse or birth / and she loved much
those men that we re of sad condycyons and proved in knyghthode. She lived
after a royal custom of an Empress by great magnyfycence and cost of estate
af ter the manner of Perse / which was those days the most pontyfycall
custom that was among kings. She was served in vessel of gold and of
precious stones / She was garnyss head of all good array / and also she gathered
great treasoures of her own without doing of extorcyon. and she gave right
largely where that it was rea sonable / for there was never prince of gretter
lar guess nor of more gretter magnyfycence.

And with these said things one of ye highest of her virtues that I shall say
to the was learned in letters in those of Egypt and of her own lan guage / and
when she had rest then right dylygent ly she took head to the scole and desired
to be taught in philosophy by a phylosophre yt was named longyne. She knew the
latyne and ye grekysshe letters by ye help of which she ordained and put
right curyously all her hystoryes under right short words / and the same
wise she would that her children that she nourysshed were learned in scyences.
Now take good head right dear friend if thou have ought seen of any prince or
knight more universal in all the virtues.

Of Lylye mother of ye good knight Thyerrys. Capitulo.xxj.
ANd how that the noble lady Lylye was not in battle in propre person is she
not to be praised as right a no ble and worshypfull lady in y^ that she
counsayllynge her sone Thyerrys ye right noble knight made him to turn again
in to the battle as thou shalt here. This Tyer res was in his time one of the
great princes of ye palace of the Emperor of Constantynoble / and was right a
fair man and right well proved in the worthynesse of knyghthode / and with that
by the right good nourysshynge and counsayllynge of his mother was right
virtuous and excellently manered. It happened y^ a prince named Odonatre went
upon the Romans for to destroy them and all Italy / and as these Romans
went to require the foresaid Emperor of Constantynoble of his help / he
sent to them this knight Tyerres as for the best knight of cheualry with right
a great host of people. So it happened as he fought in battle ordained
against this Odonatre the fortune of the battle turned against him in such
wise that for dread he was constrained to fle toward the cite of Rauenne / and
when this worshypful and wise mother which took good head of the battle saw
her sone fle she had great and meruayllous sorrow / considering that there
might be no gretter reproffe to a knight than to fle in battle. Anon the
great noblesse of her courage made her to forgete all moderly pity in such
manner that she had lever to se y^ death of her sone worshypfully than there
should fall to him such a shame. So she ran anon before him and prayed him
right tenderly yt he should not dyshonoure him by such fleing / but yt he
should assemble again his host and turn to ye battle / yet he took no
charge of these words / and then the good mother supprysed with great wrath
lyfted up her gown before and said to him / truly fair sone thou have no
place to fle to but thou turn again in to the womb fro whens thou came.
Then was this Thyerres so ashamed yt he left his fleing and assembled his
people again / and touc ned again to the battle in the which for y^ hete
that he had of the shame of the words of his mo der he fought so strongly that
he dyscomfyted his enemies and slew Odonatre / and so all Italye was delivered
of their enemies by the wit of this lady where it was like to be utterly
destroy ed. So me seems that the honor of this vycto ry came more of the
mother than of the sone.

Of the queen of France Fredegonde. Ca. xxij.
OF the queen of France Fredegonde of whom I spoke before was also of great
hardynesse of that that she did in battle. For as I have touched ho we yt she
was left wedowe of king Chylderyke her housbande having Clotharye her sone
at her pappes / and y^ royalme was assay led with werre she said to her barons.
Lords ne dread you not for the multitude of our enemies that been come upon us.
For I have thought befo re a wyle by the which we shall overcome them if ye
will believe me / I shall leave al femynyne dre de / and I shall arm mine heart
with the hardynesse of a man to that entente to encreace the cou rage of you /
and of all our host by pity of your young prince. So I shall go before having
him in mine arms and ye shall follow me and that we have ordained our
conestable to do / ye shall do the same. And the barons answered and bad her to
com maunde them and with right good heart they would labor it. And then she
let make and well ordained her host. Sith she put her before well hor sed her
sone between her arms the barons after and all the bataylles sewynge by fair
order. And so they rode toward their enemies so long till the night was come.
And then they entered in to a forest. So the conestable cut down an high
branch of a tree / and all the remenaunt did ye same wise and covered al
their horses with may and tied belles about some of their necks as men does
to horse that gothe in pastures and in this manner they rode together an easy
pace till they ca me nyghe the lodgings of their enemies / and they held
high branches and bows of may in their hands. And always the queen went
before with hardy courage in warning them by promyses and fair words for to
do well holdyn ge the little king between her arms of which they all had
great pity / and had the more courage to keep his right. And when they thought
yt they were nyghe enough their enemies they rested them. when the dawning of
the day began to appear those that made watch of the host of the enemies
perceived it and began to say one to ano there. Se here a great marvel. For
yesternyght there appeared no wood nor forest nyghe us and se now a right
great and a thycke wood ye others yt beheld this thing said that it must
needs be yt the wood had been there long time before for it might be none
otherwise but that they have been so beestyss he that they have not perceived it
/ and that it was to se that it was a wood / the belles of the horse that
pastured might have made them certain. And so as they devised they thought ne
uer on the treachery. Suddenly the queen's host cast away their branches and
then that yt seemed to their enemies a wode it appeared knights ar med / so they
ran upon them / and this was done so suddenly yt their enemies had no
leysoure to arm them / for they were all in their beds. So they went in to
their lodgings / and slew and took them all that they could find / and thus
they had the vyctory by the wit of this good queen Fredegonde.

Of the maid Camylle. Ca. xxiij.
OF women of worship and of knight hode I might tell the enough. The noble
maid Camylle was no less worthy than those before said. This Camylle was
daughter of the right ancient king of Uoulques named Machabyus and when she
was borne her mother dyed / and anon after her fader was dysheryted by his own
people that rebelled against him / and so much they troubled him that he was
constrained to fle for saving of his life. So he bare nothing with him save
only his young daughter whom he loof so great love. And when he came to pass
over a great ryuere that he might not chose but he must needs pass it / he was
in great myschyefe for that that he could find no counsel to help his little
daughter to pass / and when he had thought enough he took great ryndes of
trees and made a vessel as it were a little bote. So he put his little
daughter within and bound ye vessel with good ropes to his arm. And after
put it in the ryuere / and he swymmynge trayled easily this vessel after him /
and so he and his daughter passed over the water in to the woods / and there
he lived long for he durst not go none other way for dread of his enemies.
He nourysshed his daughter with the milk of wild bestes unto the time that
she was well strengthed / and with the skynnes of ye beestes that he slew he
covered both him and his daughter and they had none other bed ne other
covering but skynnes of bestes. And when she was waxed much she began to
war with wild be stes and to sle them with her slings and stones and she
would run after so lightly that there might no greyhounde do better. And thus
she conty nued till she came to her parfyte age in which she found herself of
a meruayllous strength and har dynesse / and then she was enfourmed of her
fader of the wrong that he had of his subgectes. She feeling herself of great
strength and right couragyous departed from thens and took her to ar mes / and
to say shortly she did so much and applied her purpose that with the help
of some of her kynnesmen she being always in her propre person in bataylles /
did so much by strength of arms that she conquered again all her country
and never left after to pursewe the deeds of cheualrye / and she was of so
high courage that she deyned never to have housbande ne to be coupled to man.
And this same Camylle was ye maiden that came to the socoure of Turnus against
Eneas when he was come down in to Italye.

Of ye queen Ueronycle of Capadoce. Ca. xxiiij.
THere was a queen in capadoce that was named Ueronycle noble of blood and of
courage / as she that was daughter to the great king Mycrydaces that ruled a
great part of the oryent / and wife of king Aryaraces ye Capadocyan. This
lady contynewed in her wedowhode in the which wedowhode one of the brethren
of her housbande assailed her with war to dysheryte her and her children /
and as it happened during this strife that ye uncle slew the.ij. sons of
this lady and his own neuewes. She was so utterly moved with sorrow yt this
great wroth made all dread to fle from her. So she armed herself and with a
great host went against her brother in law / and so she plied her entente
that at ye last she slew him her own hand and made her charyot to go over
him and overcame y^ battle.

Of the noble Archemyse queen of Carye. Capitulo.xxv.
WHat shall we say less of the noble and the right excellent Archemyse than
of other worshypfull ladies which was queen of Carye the which abo de wedowe
long after her housban de king Mansole the which she loved of so gre te love
that it might never depart from her heart as it appeared so as it shall be
devised to the in time and place here after. Her housba^de left her many fair
and great countrees in governance yet to govern she never was abashed / for
streng the / in virtue / sadness of condycyons / and prudente in governance
was all in her. So she had with that so great hardynesse in deed of knyghthode
/ and so well kept the dyscyplyne of cheu^^rye that she had the vyctory of
many diverse bataylles. And thus the highness of her name was gretely lift up
by great praysynge. For in her wedowhode with that that right nobly she governed
the countres she armed her by diverse times and in especyall.ij. notable deeds /
yt one was to keep her country yt other was to keep truth and faithful
promise. The first was when the foresaid king Mansole her housbande was deed /
those of y^ rodes which marched right nyghe the royalme of this lady had great
envy and dysdayne that a woman should have the lordshyp of the royalme of
Carye and for that in hope to put her out and to get ye land they came upon
her with a great army and a great multitude of ships and made her way
toward the eyte of da^ycarnase which stood upon the sea in an high place
called I care which was right a strong place. So there were to this Cite two
gates of which that one was within the cite as it were hid and covered and
at the entering right strayte / and there might one go and enter in to yt
palace without seeing of them without and of them of the cite also. That other
comune gate was nyghe the walls of the Cite. And when this worshypfull and
wise Archemyse knew by her spies that her enemies were come she made her
people to go to harnoys of who^ there were assembled ynowe and entered in that
little gate in to the ships that she ordained to come thither / yet or she
departed she ordained to them of the cite which were good and true in whom
she trysted well to do such things as she commanded them that when she should
make a certain sign yt she devised to them yt they should make to them of the
rodes a sign of love and that they should call them upon the walls and should
say to them that they would deliver to them the cite / and that they should
come boldly / and yt they should do so much if they might to make them lepe
out of their ships and to enter in to the market place of the cite. And this
thing ordained the lady and her host issued out at the little gate and went
a little way in to the high see so that her enemies took no head of them /
and as she had made her sign and knew by ye sign of them of the cite that
the enemies were entered in / anon she returned by the great gate and took the
ships of her enemies and entered in to ye cite / and made to assail the men
of the Rodes in every part by her busshmentes / and she and her host were
before them / and so slew them al and dyscomfyted them and had the vyctory.
And yet more worshypfully did this noble Archemyse / for she went after in to
the ships of her enemies with all her host / and went to the Rodes / and
made to lift up an high sign of vyctorye as though it* had been their people
that should come again vyctoryously. And when those of yt country saw this
trowynge that it had been their people they were passing Joyful / and let
open their port and Archemyse came in and ordained people to keep the port /
and then went straight to the palace and took and slew all the princes. And
thus those of the Rodes were taken which took no head of themself / and the
lady kept her seized in the foresaid Cite. And anon after all the hole I Will of
Rodes yielded them unto her.

And after that she had put all the isle in seruage and under trybute she left
it garnysshed with good kepers / and so returned home / yet or she departed
she let make two images of brass in y^ cite / of which that one represented
the person of Ar chemyse as ouercomer. And that other the Cite of Rodes as
overcome. Another notable deed among others that this lady did was this that
when it was so that Exerse ye king of Perse was come against the Macedonyes
and all ye land was full of his host both on horse back and on foot and ye
ryuageful of people and of his ships as he that trowed to destroy all greece.
Than ye Greeks which had made alyaunce with this lady Archemyse sent to her
to require her of her help / to the which help she sent not only but like
a cheualrous lady came in propre person with right a great host. And so well
she kept her place there that to say shortly anon she put her in battle
against these men of Perse and dyscomfyted them. And when she had dyscomfyted
them upon the land she entered into the ships and was before al others with
her nauye and nyghe the cite of Salemyne she gave them battle And as they
fought strongly this worshypfull archemyse was among the first lords and
capytaynes of her host and comforted them with great boldness saying. Now
forth my brethren and good knights and labor so that the worship may be
ours / and deserve ye this day pray sing and worship. And my great treasoure
shall not be spared unto you / and to say all she did so much that in
likewise as she dyscomfyted them on the land / she dyscomfyted them on the
water / And Exerses fled shamefully / and thus she had people innumerable /
for as many writers of hystoryes bears witness / she had so great an host
that diverse ryuers tarried them as she passed. And so had this worshypfull lady
this noble vyctorye and returned worshypfully in to her coun tree with the
dyademe of great worship.

Of the hardynesse of Cleolis. Ca. xxvj.
ALso Cleolis ye noble Romayne was right an hardy woman and a wise.
notwithstanding it was not in the war nor in battle. For as it happened
ones that the Romans by certain couenauntes made between them and a king
that had been their adversary. It was accorded that by certyfycacyon of the
couenauntes there was sent to that king to be in hostage the noble maiden
Cleolis and other mandens of noble lygnage of Rome / and when this Cleolis had been a great while in the foresaid hoostage. She thought that it was a great
hurt to the worship of the Cite of Rome / that so many of noble maidens should
be holden as prisoners of a strange king. So this Cleolys armed her courage
with great hardynes / and did so much by fair words and fair promyses that
she deceived wysele them yt had them in keeping and departed from thens by
night / and led her fellows and went so long till they aryued upon the
reuer of Tybre / and there this Cleolys found in y^ meadows an horse
pasturynge. And then she which happily never rode before mounted upon this
horse / and without any manner of dread of the depnesse of the water put one of
her felawes behind her and passed over. And after all y^ others one after
another and so they passed over saufe / and this lady Cleolys led them to
Rome and brought them to their friends. The hardynesse of this maid was gre
tely praised of them of Rome / and y^ same wise y^ king that had them in
hostage praised her gretely and had thereof great solace. And the Romans to
that entente that there should be a remembrau^ ce had of this deed from thens
for the. They made make the image of Cleolys which was made in y^ guyse of a
maid sitting upon an horse. And they put this image in an high place upon
the way by which they went to a temple and there it abode long time. Now we
have accheued ynou ghe as for the foundement of our cite. Now we must lift up
the high walls all about.

Xp^ine demands of Reason if ever god list to make a woman so noble to have
any vndersta^ dynge of the highness of science. Ca. xxvii.
THese things of me right well herd I answered to y^ lady that spoke to me.
Madame truly without fay le god showed great meruaylles in y^ strength of
these foresaid ladies of the which ye have touched / yet I pray you to make
me wise if it please you / to the which god has given them so many graces
it pleased to worship the kind of woman to give pryuylege to any of them of
the virtue of high understanding and of great science / and if they have
abyle wit to that. For that I desire to know for y^ that men maynteyne and
say that the understand dynge of women is but of little taking. Answer.
Daughter by that yt I have said here to fo re thou may know the contrary of
their opyny on / and for to expound it more plainly I shall gy ue it the first
by ensamples. I say to the again and doubt never the contrary that if it
were the custom to put the little maidens to the scole and that sewyngly were
made to learn y^ s^yences as they do to the man children / that they should
learn as parfytely / and they should be as well entered in to the subtyltes of all the arts and scyences as they be / and peradventure there should be mo of them
/ for I have touched here to fore by how mo che that women have the body more
soft than y^ men have / and less habyle to do diverse things by so much they
have the understanding more sharp there as they apply it. Madame be not
dyspleased / suffer me upon this point if it please you. Certainly me^ would
never suffer this que styon to pass for truth but if it were openly
assoyled. For they would say yt one says comunely these men to understand
much more than y^ women does. Answer daughter know thou wherefore it is
that they understand less. Madame nay but if it please you to tell it me
without fail it is for that they haunte not so many die uers places ne so many
diverse things / but they hold them within their houses / and it suffyseth
them to do their busynesses / and there is nothyn ge that techeth a creature
reasonable so much as does the experyence of many diverse things. Madame and
sith that they have the understanding abyle to conceive and to learn as the
men have / wherefore learn they not more. Answer. For yt daughter for it is no
need to y^ comune thyn ge that they meddle them of that which is commit ted to
man to do / as I have said to the before. It suffyseth that they do comune
office to y^ which they are ordained / and that that one Iugeth by y^
experyence of that that the women can less than men it is no marvel as it is
said before though their understanding be less. Make the a behol dynge of the
people of the low country / or of the high mountains. Thou shalt find
countries ynowe yt the people seem as bestes they be so sym ple / and yet it is
no doubt that nature has made them as parfyte in all these things as in body
and understanding as well as y^ wysest people / and y^ most expert of those
that been in good cytees or in good towns / and that is for defaute of
learning. Not withstanding as I have said to the before that of men and women
some have better vndestrandynge than some / for there has been women of right
great conning and of great understanding. I shall tell the and to our pur
pose that I told the of the understanding of women that they have as sharp
wit to learn as men have.

Of women yt were enlumyned of great scyences and first of y^ noble maid
Cornyfye. Ca. xxviii.
COrnyfye the noble maid was sent to the scole by her fader in manner of scorn
/ or of Iape with her brother Cornyfycyen when they were young children. But
this little maid by mernayllous wit haunted the scole so much yt she began
to feel the sweet drops of understand dynge to learn. So it was no light
thing to take away this pleasaunce from her / to the which all other women's
works put a part / she applied her in that she might. And thus she occupied
her so well by the space of time that she was right a sovereign poet / and not
only in yt science but it seemed that she was nourysshed with y^ myl ke and
with the doctrine of party te phylosophye For she would feel and know of all
manner of scy ences that she learned soueraynly in so much that she passed her
brother which was right a great poet in all excellent clargye / and it
suffysed her not only the conning but she put the vnderstandyn ge to work it
/ and her hands to y^ pen in compylynge many right notable books / the
which books and dyttyes were in the time of saint Gre gory of great price / of
whom Bocace the Italyen which was a great poet makes mencyo^ in pray sing
this woman says in his book. O right great worship to that woman y^ has left
woman's works and applies and gives her wit to y^ study of right high
conning. And this Bocace says forthermore certefyenge the purpose y^ I said
to the of the wits of women. Now ben they ashamed says he as these slow
women y^ so mysse trusts of theyrselfe and of their understanding so as
though they were borne in the mountains without understanding what is welthe
or worship / and so dyscourageth themself / and says that they be not good to
other thing nor profitable but to take men about the neck and to bear and
nourysshe children / and god has given them fair understanding if they
would apply it in all things that these glorious and excellent men does /
for if they would study / the things be another more ne less but also comune
to women as to men / and may by honest labor get them name perpetual / the
which having is agreeable to all worshypfull men. Right dear daughter thus
may thou se how this auctoure Bocace bears witness of that that I have
said to the and how he prayseth and proves science in woman.

Of Probe the Romayne. Ca. xxix.
OF great excellence in science also was Probe y^ Romayne wife of Adelphe / and
was crystened. This woman had so notable wit / and she loved and haunted the
scole so much that she could soueraynly the. vi^. scyences lyberales and was
right a sovereign poet. And by so great labor in studyenge she haunted the
books of poets and in especyall of vyrgyle and of his dyttyes that to all
purposes she had them all in mind / y^ which as in a time she saw by great
entente of her wit and of her thought / and as she took head of the
sygnyfyenge of them / It came to her entencyon that one might after the
foresaid books dyscryue all the scripture and the hystoryes of the old
testament and of the new by pleasant verses and full of substance the which
thing for certain that the auctoure Bocace says is not without marvel
that so high consyderacyon might enter in the brain of woman / and right a
^rete meruayleas he says to put it in execucyo^ for she right gretely
desiring to fulfill her thou ght put the hand to the work and sometime she
ran by the Bucolyques or by Eueydos or by y^ Georgykes which were the books
that Uyrgyle made which ben so named / that is to say / she vysyted and read
and now of one part she took the hole verse / now of others some little
parts she touched by meruayllous craft and subtylte to her purpose / and so
ordynately made hole verses and y^ letell parts put together and coupled and
read in be holding y^ law / the craft and the measure of fete and the
Ioynynge together y^ verses without fay lynge in any part that no man might do
better. And by such manner after the beginning of the world she made the
beginning of her book in sewynge all the hystoryes of the old testament and
of the new / and so came to the sendynge of y^ holn ghost to the apostles
according all with y^ books of Uyrgyle so ordynately that who had not
knowing of this making would have wend that Uyrgyle had been a prophet or an
Euangelyst together. For the which the foresaid Bocace says great
recommendacyon and lowynge of this woman. For it appears openly that she had
very knowledge and plain of holy books and holy volumes of deuyne scripture the
which book was known of many great clerks and deuynes of our time. And this
noble lady would y^ this foresaid work made and compounded by great labor
Labor should be called Centonyas. And not^^ standing y^ the labor of work
as for the gretnesse ought suffyse to y^ life of a man / yet she left not till
she had made many diverse other books right worshypfull and excellent. One
among all other she made in verses and to be called also Cento nigh because of
an hundred verses that been contey ned therein. Also she took the books of Omerus
y^ poet and the verses by which one might conclu de to the praysynge of her
which knew not one ly the latyne letters but also the greeks as parfytely. Of
the which lady and of her things y^ she did Bocace says that it ought to be
great pleasaunce to all women to here.

Of Sapho poet and phylosophre. Ca. xxx.
ANd of less co^nynge the^ Probe / was not the noble Sapho / which was a
maid of y^ cite of Mylycene. This Sapho was of right great beauty of body and
of vysage / and in manner ly countenance / and in speech right agreeable and
pleasant / and above all other graces that were given her she passed of high
understanding. For she was expert pro^oundely in many diverse arts and
scyences. And she knew not only letters and wrytynges made by others / but of
herself she found many new things / and made many diverse books and dyttyes
/ of whom speaks ^he poe^^ Bornes these fair words of poetyke language Sapho
garnysshed of quycke understanding and of brenuynge desire by contynuel study
among the beestysshe people and without co^nynge haunted the highness of the
mountay ne of ^ernaso / this is to understand the par^yte study by very
hardynesse and boldness / she ac companyed herself with ye.ix. muses not
refused that is to say^ among the crafts and scyences / and so entered in the
forest of Lawryere full of braun ches of virtue / and flowers of diverse colors
smelling of great swetnesse of diverse herbs where they rest them and dwell /
grammar / Logyke / and the noble rethoryke / Geometry / and Arysmetryke and so
much she went yt she came and aryued in the cave and depnesse of Appolyne god
of science and conning / and found the spring and conduyte of Castolyo the
well / and took the wrest of the harne and touched it. So she made great
melodyes with the nymphs ledynge y^ dance / this is to understand with the
rules of Irmony and cords of musyke. By these things that Bocace says of her
ought to be understand the depnesse of her understanding / and y^ books that
she made of so deep science that the sentences ben strong to know and
understand to men of great wit and the scole after the witness of ancient
men endures unto this day / and her wrytynges and dyt^yes right notably
compounded and made by y^ lyghtes and ensamples to them that comes after
par^yte writing and e^dytynge. She found many diverse manners of making of
songs / and dyttyes plays / and weeping complayntes and strange lamentacyons
of love right well and in fair order which were named after her name Saphyse
/ and of these dyttyes records Crassus that when Plato the great Phylosophre
which was master to Arystotle was deed / one found the books of the
wrytynges of Sapho under his bolster of his heed / and to say shortly of this
lady she was of so great excellence of conning yt in the Cite where she was
conuersaunt to y^ intent y^ she was most worshypfull and that she should be
always in remembrance / one made to her likeness an image of brass hallowed
in the name of her lift of a great hight. So was this lady na med and counted
among all other poets of renown / of the which as Bocace says the
worshyppes of dyademes and of crowns / and of mytres of bysshoppes be not
gretter ne them that has vyctores and chaplettes of Lauryere and palm.
Leonte that was a greek was a great phyloso phre also / which durst reprove
the Phylosophre Theophrast by pure and true reasons / which was so gretely
named in his days.

Of the maid Manthoa. Ca. xxxj.
IF the scyences ben easy and couenable to women to learn / know it for
truth that the same wise y^ crafts are not un seen to them and some time in
the old law of paynymes y^ people used many diverse dyuynacyons of that that
was to come by the fiyght of birds / and by the flambes of fire. And by the
entrayles of deed beestes. And that was a propre art or a co^nynge which they
held in great dygnyte. In this time a maiden was a great maystresse which was
daughter of Thyryfye / which was the gretest priest of y^ cite of Thebes so as
we call him a bishop / for in y^ other laws the bysshoppes were married. This
woman that was named Manthea which flou red in the time of king Edyppus was
of so clear and great wit that she knew all the craft of Pyromancye which
is for to dyuyne by y^ flambes of fire / the which art used in the old time
those of Caldee which found it / and others say th that Nembroche the gyaunt
found it. So the re was in her time no man that knew y^ mouyn ges of the
flambes of fire / the colors and y^ sow ^e yt came out of the fire but she.
And also she kne we clearly the veins of beestes / the throtes of bo les and
the entraylles of all beestes that one wol de believe that by these crafts
often times y^ spyrytes were constrained to speak and to give answer of that
yt one would know. In the time of this lady Thebes was destroyed thrughe the
en cheson of the.ij. sons of king Edyppus. Then went this lady to dwell in
Asye / and there she made a temple of the god Apollo the which was sith in
great renown. She ended her life in Ita lie / and of ye name of this lady for
her great auctoryte there was named a Cite of the country and yet is Manthoa /
in y^ which vyrgyle was borne

Of Medea and another queen named Cyrtes Capitulo.xxxij.
MEdea of whom hystoryes enough makes mencyon could as much of craft and
conning as she before reherced. She was the daughter of Oaths king of Coloos
and of Per te / She was right fair of body and of vysage / But in conning she
passed all other women in her time / she knew the virtues of every diverse
herb and all manner enchauntementes that might be made and of any craft that
might be learned she was not ygnoraunt by y^ virtue of a song that she could /
she would make ye Air to trouble and the sky to wax dark / move y^ wyndes
out of the pyttes and caves of the earth to make the tempests to rise in the
air / to make waters and great ryuers to stand still / to make venyme to make
fyres without labor to brenne any ma ner thing y^ she would and all such
manner of thyn ges she could do / this was she yt made Jason to conquer the
golden fleece by enchauntement.

Cyrtes also was a queen of a country upon the sea which stood upon the
entryes of Italye. This lady could so much of the craft of enchau^ tement
that there was nothing that she would do / but she would do it by y^ virtue of
her enchaun tement / and by a drink that she would give she would change the
bodies of men in to the fygu res of wild bestes and birds. And to witness ye
same thing it is written in ye hystory of Ulyxes that when he returned after
the destruccyon of Troy trowed to go again in to his country / of great
fortune and woodnesse of tempests burled his ships here and there by many
diverse trou bles that at the last they aryued at the port of y^ cite of this
lady Cyrtes. yet this wise vlyxes wol de not take the land without license of
the queen of the land / he sent certain of his knights to her for to know
if it pleased her that they might take the land. Then this lady trowed that
they had been her enemies gave them drink of y^ drink that she made / and
anon they were trans fourmed in to hogs / but Ulyxes went anon to her /
and did so much y^ they were put again in to their own s^ap / and in the
same wise some men say of Dyomede that was another prince of Greece that when
he aryued at the port of this lady Cyrtes y^ she made his knights to be trans
fygured in to birds which be yet right great and of other shappe than other
birds ben / and they ben right fyerse and those of that country call them
Dyomedens.

Xp^ine asks of Reason if there was ever woman that found any thing of
herself that was not known before / and she told her of Nycostra te
otherwise called Carmentis. Ca. xxxiij.
I Xp^ine which understood these things of dame reason replied upon that in
this ma nere. Madame I se well y^ ye might find ynowe and of great nombre of
women praised in scyences and in craft / but know ye any that by y^ ver tue
of their feeling and of subtylte of wit have found of themself any new
crafts and scyences necessary good and couenable that were never found before
nor known / for it is not so gre te maystry to follow and to learn after any
other science found and comune before as it is to find of theymselfe some
new thing not accustomed before. Answer. Ne doubt ye not y^ contrary my
dear friend but many crafts and scyen ces right notable has been found by
the wit and subtylte of women as much by speculacyon of understanding the
which shows them by writing as in crafts ye shows them in werkynge of
hands and of labor. And of these I shall give the ensamples. And first I
shall tell the of Nycostrate which those of Italye called Carmentes. This lady
was daughter of the king of Archadye named Pallent. She was meruayl lous wytty
and given of god to her of special gifts of understanding. She was a great
clarke in the letter of Greece / and had so much fair and wise speech and
worshypfull faconde that y^ poets being y^ time y^ wrote of her feigned in her
wrytynges y^ she was love of the god Mercuryus / and y^ she had a sone by the
foresaid god / which was of great understanding. This lady by certain
chance that happened in the country where she was went out of her country /
her sone and great foyson of people yt followed and went with her / and with a
great nauye came in to Italye / and aryued upon the water of Tybre and there
she descended out of her ships. So she went up upon an high hylle that she
named the mount Palentyne after her fader upon the which mount the Cite of
Rome was founded sith. This lady with her sone and those that followed her
founded a fair castle there. And as this lady had found the me^ of that
country al bestysshe and rude she ordained and wrote certain laws by y^
which she enjoined them to live by order of right and reason after Justice and
she was the first yt in this country which was sith of so great renown / and
of whom all the laws of right come of the first yt establed the laws there.
This lady knew by inspyracyo^ deuyne that by the spyryte of prophecye among
other graces that she had synguler specyalte was given to her how this country
ought to be in time to come most noble of excellence and of renown above all
the countres of the world. So it seemed her that it should be no honest thing
yt when the highness of the Empire of Rome that all the word ought to
lordeshyp and govern that they should use of letters and carectes strange /
and begged of other countrees / and to that entente al so that she would show
her wisdom and excellence of wit to the world to come / she did so much
by her study that she found propre letters dyfferenced from all other nacyons
of the world that is to know the. A. B. C. and the ordenaunce of latyne by
putting together of y^ same letters with the dyfference of vowelles with all
the entering of the science of grammere. The which letters and scyences she
took and taught them to her people / and would yt it should be known com
munely / so it was no little science nor little profy table that this woman
found. For y^ subtylnesse of the said science / and for the great profit and
welthe that is come to ye world by it one might say that there was never
worthyer thing foun de to the world / and of that benefyse y^ Italyens have
not ben unkind and of good right to whom this thing was so meruayllous that
they had her not only in reputacyon more than man / but a goddess. For the
which they honored her with deuyne worshyppes. And when she was deed they
edyfyed and founded a tymple in her name. And it was made and builded at the
foot of the foresaid mountain where she dwelled. And to give to this lady a
perpetual memory for evermore / they took many of them their names as after
the scyences that she had found / and also they gave the name of her to diverse
of their things so as themself of that country for the science of latyne
which that was found there by that lady they call themself latynes in great
worship / and that more is for that that ita in latyne that is to say in
Frensshe ouy / and in English ye / the sovereign affyrmacyon of this language
is latyne. And yet it suffyseth not them yt this country was called y^ land of
latyne / but they would that all the countres over the mountains which is
great and large / and where there were many diverse countres and lordshyppes all
was called Italye. Of this lady Carmentys dyttyes were called carmen in latin
And also the Romans that came a great while sith named one of the gates of
the Cite of Rome Carmentele / the which names for what manner prosperyte that
ye Romans had sith another for no highness of Emperors they changed never
sith / so as it appears unto this day it endure th yet. And what will thou
more fair daughter may there any man say more worship of any man borne of
woman / yet thou trowest not that this craft be only to the world by which
many scyences and diverse have been found.

Of Mynerue that found many scyences / and the manner to make Armoure of Iron
and steel. Ca. xxxiiij.
MInerue so as thou haste written in other places was maiden of Greece and her
surname was Pallas / this maid was of so great excellence in wit that the
lewd people of that country for that yt they knew not well of what kynrede
she was of / and they saw her do things yt had not ben before in usage / said
that she was a goddess comen from heaven / for by so much as they knew not
from whens she came the more was to them meruaylable the great conning of her
above all women in her time / this lady was subtle and of great understanding
not only in one thing but soueraynely in all things. She found by her
subtylnesse certain lettres Grekeysshe that some call them Carectes / by the
which one might put a great tale of diverse things in writing in the space of
right few lettres and of short writing the which abreuyacyons uses the
Greeks yet which was right a fair inuencyon and a subtle to find. She
found nombre and manner of a compte and to put together sommes. She had the
spyryte so much enlumyned of understanding that she found many crafts and
works to make that had never ben found before. The craft of wolle and to
make clothe / and she found first yt ever was aduysed to shere sheep to tose
wolle / to kembe and to card it with diverse instruments to make it clean / to
make it soft with rods of iron / to spynne at y^ dysta^^e and after
instruments to make the clothe / and how it should be wouen. Also she found
the cafte and usage to ma ke oil of fruytes of ye earth / of Olyues and of
other fruit to press it and to draw ye lycoure. Also she found y^ craft
and the usage to make carts and charyottes to bear things easily from one
place to another / and yet did this lady more / and that seemed more
meruaylable for that yt it is far fro y^ nature of woman yt she should advise
her of such things. For she found the craft and the manner of ma king of
harnoys and armure of iron and of stele the which the knights, and men of
arms uses in ba tail with which they cover their bodies and yt she t^ke it
first to them at Athenes to whom she taught ye usage of ordeynynge hoostes in
battle and the manner of fighting in order and arowe / and she found first
pypes / shalmes / and trompes and instruments of mouth. This lady with the
great virtue of understanding yt she had was always a vyrgyn / and for y^ great
chastyte yt she was of y^ poets said in their sayenges yt wulcan y^ god of
fire had long wrestled with her / and finally she overcame him and surmounted
him / yt is as much to say / y^ she overcame the brennynge and the
concupyscence of the flesh which gives great defaute in youth. The people
of Athenes had her in great reuer^nce and called her goddess of arms and of
knyghthode because y^ she found first y^ usage. And also they called her
goddess of conning for the great science y^ habou^ded in her. After her death
they made to her a temple in Athenes consecrate in her name / and in that
temple they set her image which was in y^ shap and semblaunce of a maiden y^
which image sygnyfyed wisdom and knyghthode / and so this image had the eyes
terryble and cruel for yt that knyghthode is ordained to execute y^ rygure of
Justice / also it sygnyfyed yt one knew little often times to what end
entendeth y^ entencyon of a wise man / she had y^ heed helmet which betokened
yt a knight ought to have strength in virtue / and also it sygnyfyed yt the
counsayles ought to be couerte and secret. She was clothed with an haw berke
which betokens ye puyssaunce of ye state of knyghthode / and it betokened
also that the wise man ought to be always armed against y^ monyn ges of fortune
be it well or evil / she held a shafte or a long spear which was to say yt
a knight ou ght to be the staff of Justice / and it sygnyfyed also yt the wise
man pycketh his darte of a great length. She had hanging at her neck a targe
or a shield of crystal which betokened that the knights ought to be always
waking and to se clear upon the defense of the country and of the people Also
it sygnyfyed that unto the wise man al thyn ges ben brought and made open. In
the mids of this targe there was also pourtrayed the heed of a serpent the
which was named Gorgon / the which heed betokened and sygnyfyed that a noble
and worthy knight ought to be subtyl and wy ly and watchynge upon his enemies
as does y^ serpent it was also to understand that the wise man ought to be
aduysed of all malyces thrughe which he might be noyed. Also they put a bird
in y^ one side of this image as for keep it which flees by night that men
calls a choughe which betokens that a knight ought to be as well by night
as by day all ready for the defense comu ne if need be. Also it sygnyfyed that
the wise man should wake at every hour upon that that is to him easy to do.
This lady was by long time holden by so great reverence / and so much went
her renown that in many places were stabled and made temples in her name / and
in the same wise long time after that y^ Romans were in their great
puyssaunce put her image among their other gods.

Of the right noble queen Seres. Ca. xxxv.
CEres which was in the right old days queen of the royalme of Syculyens had
a prerogatyue to find by subtylte of wit first the science and usage of the
tyllynge of the earth and of the toles that perteyneth thereto. She tau ght to
her subjects to put together and to make tame y^ oxen and to accustom them to
be coupled in ye yoke. She found also y^ ploughe and showed them ye manner how
they should cleue and depart ye earth and all the labor y^ thereto perteyneth
/ and after she taught them to cast the sede upon ye earth and to cover it /
and after when the sede was grown and multyplyed she showed them how they
should repe the corn / and with betynge of flayles to put it out of the eres.
After she taught them to grynde it by twene.ij. hard stones by craft / and
how they shol de make mylles and she taught them after to make bread of the
mele / and also this lady taught to ye peo ple y^ lived customably as beestes
with acornes and hawthorne buryes / and wild apples to use more couenable
fedynges / yet this lady did more for the people of y^ country that had it of
custom to dwell here and there in woods and in wild places and void as
beestes made them to assemble by gre te companyes / and taught them to make
towns and cytees and howses in the which they should dwell together / and
thus by this lady y^ world was brought out of the beestysshnesse in to the
reasonable life of man. Of this Ceres the poets feigned the tale how her
daughter was rauysshed by Pluto god of hell / and for the auctoryte of her
vndersta^ dynge and the great welthe y^ she had procured to the world / the
people of thens worshypped her and called her goddess of corn.

Of the noble queen I^es that found first the craft to make Orchardes and to
plan te plants. Ca. xxxvj.
THe same wise was Isys of so great te understanding in the deed of labor
that she was not only named queen of Egypt but right syguler and special
goodness of Egypcyens. Of this Isys speaks y^ fable that Iupyter loved her
and how he transfourmed her in to a cow / and after how she came in to her
first form which by sygnyfyenge of her great understanding so as thou
haste touched her thyselfe in thy book of Othea. She found diverse manners of
letters abreged that she tought the Egypcyans and gave them form of their
long language to abrege it. This was the daughter of Iuachus king of Greeks
and sister of Phoroneus which was ry ght a wise man / and this lady went out
of Greece for diverse things y^ fell and went in to Egypt with her brother.
There she taught among other things the usage of orchardes and to graffe
trees on diverse stocks / and she gave and ordained certain laws and
ryghtfull / and she tought y^ people of Egypt which lived rudely without
ordynau^ ce of Justice to live by right order / and to speak shor tely she did
so much y^ living and deed / they had her in great reverence / and her
renown went thru ghe the world in so much that in diverse places were made
temples and oratoryes in her name. And also at Rome in the time of their
highness they made a temple in her name where they ordey ned sacrefyses and
offerynges and great solempnytees in the manner as they of Egypt were accusto
med to do for her. The housbande of this lady was named Aprys / which after
the arroure of ancient people was sone of the god Iupyter and of Nyode /
daughter of Phoroneus / of whom the old hystoryes and poets makes mencyon
enough.

Of the great welthe that is come to the world by diverse ladies. Ca. xxxvij.
MAdame I have great marvel of y^ / that I have herd you say y^ so much
good should come to the world because of y^ understanding of woman. And these
men say comunely their understanding is as a thing without price and y^
they have not served ne serves to the world but for to bear children and
spynne. An swear. Now may thou well know the great ygnoraunce and they
yield no thankynges to them from whom they come. And also thou may se cle
rely how god which nothing does without cause has will to show to men
that he dyspray seth not ye woman kind / ne though that he con sydereth that
in the brain of woman there is so great understanding that not only they ben
abyle for to learn / and to withholde the scyences / but to find of themself
all new scyences of so great vtylyte and profit unto the world / that
nothing is more necessary so as thou may se of this Carmentes of whom I
have spoken to the y^ found the letters of latyne / to the which god has been
so gracyous and so much multyplyed the science ye this lady found which
has defaced as among us all y^ letters of Ebrue and of Grew / and that
nyghe Europe which conteyneth a great party and space of the earth uses of
these letters of the which there be made and compounded infynyte books of
volumes of al facultees / where be put and kept in perpetual memory the
acts and deeds of men and the nobles and excellent praysyngees of god and all
manner scyences and crafts. So may thou conclude that the welthe y^ this
woman has done is infynyte. For by this lady though yt they will not know it
these men are drawn out of yg noraunce and put in to knowing / by her they
have y^ craft to send their courages and entencyons as far as they will and
have knowledge and understanding again of all things that pleases them and
the same wise to know things passed and present / and some that are to come.
And also by y^ scy ence of this woman men may make accord and Join
frendshyppes with persons far fro them and by answers that they gave that
one to that other they feel and know their will without seeing. And to say
shortly all the welthe yt comes of letters may not be told / for they
dyscryue and make to understand and know god and celestyall things / the
heuens the sea / the earth al persons and all things / where was there ever
man tha^ ever did more good.

Of the same. Capitulo.xxxviij.
ANd also where was there ever man by whom more welthe happened to the world
than did by this noble queen Ceres of whom I have spoken of to the before
which may not get a name of gretter praysynge as to bring y^ wild men
dwelling in wodes as beestes with out law of right to dwell in cytees and
towns and to teache them to use ye right way and to have pourchaced vytayle of
better ^edynge than acornes and wild apples / that is to know / whetes and
corns by the which these men have the body more fair and more clear and the
members more strong and more mouynge as it were mete more comforta tyfe / and
more couenable to man's nature and the land full of thystles of thorns / and
of busshes evil set to gyder and full of wild trees / she taught to cleanse by
labor / and to sow the sede the which by the labourynge of ye ground there
as it was wild it becomes free and tame to ye comune profit / and so by this
lady man's nature recey ueth that profit by the which the wild and rude
world was changed in to the guyse of good cy tees and towns / and the
slawstrynge wits and slow / being in the caves of ygnoraunce were changed
and brought again in to highness of contemplacyon and exersyses couenables /
and she ordained some men to labonre the feldes by y^ which so many cytees and
town are replenysshed and sustained / and some to do other necessary works to
live by. I sys the same wise in orchardes / and gardynes who may sum the
great welthe that she procured t^ the world to give the manner to lift up
plants and trees and so many good her bes couenable to y^ nourysshynge of man.
My nerve also that pourueyed by her wit to man's nature so many diverse
necessary th^nges as clothing of wolle which were before clothed with skynnes
of be^stes. Also she put them out of pain that they had to bear all their
necessary things between their arms from one place to another and ordained
and found the manner to make carts and charyottes for their socoure and to
the nobles and knights she found the craft and the usage to make harnoys to
cover their bodies for the more suretye in the war more fair and stronger
and more couenable than they had before which was only with the hydes of
beestes. Xp^ine and I said to her. Ha madame. Now I perceive by that / yt ye
say more than ever I did the great unkindness and uncunning of these men
that so much evil says of women / for notwithstanding that it should seem
that there is cause enough of praysynge of them by that woman is mother to man
/ and al other welthes that one mayese openly that generally women does to
men. Truly I se nere the right hepe of beuety ses and of sovereign largeness
that they have re ceyned and receive of them. Now let them hol de their peace
from hens torthe these evil saying clerks of women that have blamed and
spoken shrewdely of women in their books and dyttyes and other such / and
let them cast down their eyes for shame of that they have mysse said
considering the truth which is contrary un to their writing seeing this
noble lady Carme^ it is the which by the highness of her understand dynge has
taught them as their maystresse at y^ scole such a lesson by y^ which
understanding / they hold them so high and worshypfull / that is to know
the noble letters of latyne / yet what shall these nobles and knights say to
this thing so much against right that says evil gene rally of all women /
let them refrain their mou these and from hens forth aduysynge y^ usage, to
bear arms in battle / and to fight in ordenaunce of y^ which craft they
praise them and hold them gre te / and all is come to them by women* and
generally al men that lives by bread / and that lives in Cytees and towns by
the order of right. And also those y^ tylleth the land / have they so much
cause to blame women as many of them does thynkyn ge upon these benefeytes
and goodnesses which they have done for them. Forsothe nay. And that by these
women / that is to understand Myuerne Ceres / and Isys there ben come to them
so many dy^^rs ^elthes and profytes / of the which benefy ses they have their
life worshypfully and so they ly ue and shall live always. These things ben well
appealed without fail madame / but yet it seems me that the doctrine of
Arystotle which was of right great profit to man's wit and whereof one
holds of great count and of right / none of all that other phylosophres that
ever were the re is not of so great profit to the world as have been and ben
by y^ doctrine of these foresaid ladies.

Of the maiden Arenye that found the craft to shere sheep / to dress the
wolles / and to make clothe. Ca. xxxix.
NOt only by these ladies god had lust to pouruey to the world many diverse
things and necessaryes / but also in y^ same wise by many diverse others. So as
by a maid of the lan de of Assye that was named Arenye daughter of ydmuete
Cholophone y^ which was of meruayl lous and subtell wit. So much she
labored her wits y^ she found first the craft to dye wolle in to diverse
colors and to make works in clothe as paynters does / in the manner that we
should call y^ clothes of high list and in this craft she was meruayllous
subtle. And it was she whereof the fable speaks and says that she stryued with
Pallas which became a flee. This woman fou^ de another science more
necessary. For this was she that found first the manner of Flax and manner of
works to make lynnen clothe / y^ which thing seems to be right necessary
to y^ world thou ghe that some men say that the exercise thereof be reprofe to
women. This Arenye also found first to make nets and crafts to take birds
and fysshes and found the craft of fyss hynge / and to ta ke and deceive the
strong wild beestes and conyes and hares / and birds with nets which was
not known before. So me seems that this woman made no little service to y^
world by y^ whi che sith men have found great profit. Notwtstandynge yt
diverse auctoures and also this Bocace which tells ye foresaid things have
said that the world was better when ye people lived not but with hawes and
acornes / and y^ they ware but skynnes of bestes then it has been sith when
that they were taught to use others more delycatyfe / yet save the reverence of
the said auctoure and of all them that shall say that it is preiudyce to y^
world to use such things and that the nourysshynge of man's body should be
found and used I say that in so much that any creature receive th more of
graces and of great gifts of god / by so much is he the more beholdynge to
serve him ye better / and that yfony creature use evil of well y^ god has
provided for him and granted him to use them well and couenably / and made
them for the usage of man and woman y^ it comes of the shrewdenesse and
cursydnesse of them that uses it evil and not that y^ things of him should
not be evil but good to use. Ihesu christ himself in his own person showed it
well for he used bread and wine fless he and fyss he / robe of color / of
lynnen / and of all other things necessary which had not be done if it had been better to use to eat acornes and hawes and also he honored much the
science yt Ce res found / that is to know of bread when it plea sed him to
give to man and woman his own body in form of bread / and that they should
use it.

Of Pamphyle that found the craft to draw sylke of the worms. Ca. xl.
OF scyences good and profitable foun de by women / among others we ou ght not
to forgete the noble P^mphy le of the country of Greece. This lady was of right
subtle wit in diverse works / and so much delyted to search strange
things that she was the first y^ found the craft of sylke. For as she was
right subtle and yma gynatyfe she aduysed her of these worms y^ makes sylke
naturally upon the branches of trees So she took y^ bothomes that these worms
had made and she saw that they were right fair / and then she took many
thredes and put them together and twyned them / and then she assayed if this
threde would take any fair color / and when she had proved all this and saw
that it was right a fair thing she took it to make and to weue in to clothes
of sylke. For the which thing of the conning of this woman there is come
great beauty and profit to y^ world multyplyed in all conntres. For god is
worshypped and served in diverse arayes thereof. And the noble robes and ray
mentes of prelates in deuyne offices ben made thereof. And also of Emperors
kings and pryn ces / and the same wise the people of some lands uses none
other clothing for that they have no wolles and they have ynowe of sylke
worms.

Of Thamar that was a sovereign maystresse in the craft of payntynge / and of
another named Irayne. Ca. xli.
WHat would thou I should say if nature of woman be able to find and to
learn the speculatyfe scyences and also these hand crafts. The same wise it
is empropryed to execute the^ and put them in work right subtylly when they
have learned them. So as it is written of a woman that was named Thamar which
was of so gre te subtylte in the craft and science of payntynge that in those
days while she lived there was no ne such as she was in conning. This woman
as Bocace says was daughter to Nyton Peyn tree and was in ye time of Olympe.
Olympe was a great solemn day so called / in the which there were made
diverse plays / and he that gate it should be granted un to him yt he asked yt
it were a reasonable thing the which feast and plays was done in the honor
of Iupyter / and it was ha lowed from.vj. year unto.vj. year.iiij. year free by
twene both / and Hercules ordained first this feast / and of ye first
beginning yt it was ordained they made their date. So as does the christian men
of the Incarnacyon of Ihesu christ. This Thamar left all women's works and
followed the craft of her fader by right great subtelte of wit in y^ time
when Archylans reigned upon the Macedonyes she had synguler praysynge in so
much yt they of the country of Ephese that there worship ped the goddess
Dyane made by great charge yt this Thamar should paynte the image of their
goddess / which they kept long time after in great dygnyte as a thing made
by great subtylte and solempnely painted / and they showed never this image but
at the feast and solempnyte of ye god desse the which payntynge as it endured
by right great age bare so great witness of the subtyl te of this woman that
unto this day there is me mory of her wit. In this science of payntynge there
was also a woman of Greece soueraynly ler ned which was named Irane that she
passed al those that were in her time / this woman was a dyscyple of a
payntoure called Cracyne y^ which was a sovereign work man / yet she was
subtle and so much learned in the science y^ she passed and exce ded her
master so meruayllousiy y^ for the remem braunce of her they let make an
image which was as a maiden yt painted / and they lift it for ho noure among
y^ other images of sovereign were ke men of certain works yt had been before
her. For such custom had these ancient men yt they worshypped both men and
women yt pass other in excellence whyder it were of understanding or of
strength or of beauty / or of any other grace or virtue yt for to make their
perpetual remembrau^ ce they made to set their images in high and worcester
shypfull places. Marcya the Romayne yt was also a vyrgyne was of right great
virtue in noble living / and in good condycyons / she was also of noble wit
in y^ craft of payntynge / this woman wrought by so great craft and so
maysterly ye she passed all men / and the same wise Gaye and Spolyn yt were
called y^ most sovereign payntoures of the world in their time / she passed
them and attained the worship of all yt might be known of yt science after
that that the maystres said. This Marcya to that entente yt the remembrance of
ye science should show after her among her noble works she made a table by
great craft where she painted her figure beholdynge her in a myroure so
properly y^ every man y^ saw it Iuged it to be on live / the which table
right long sith was soue raynely kept and she wed to work men as a treasoure
of solempnyte. Then I said to her mada me by this ensample one may perceive yt
in y^ old time these wise people were more worshypped than they be no we / and
the scye nces holds in much more price / yet to the purpose of that yt ye
say of women expert in y^ science of payntynge. I know at this day a woman
yt men calls Ana stase ye is so much expert and learned to make vyny ettes
of enlumynynge in books and chasynge hysto ryes yt there is mencyon made of any
work man in y^ town of Paris / yet there ben such in yt tow ne yt ben called
y^ soueraynest werkemen of y^ worl de / but yt she passes them / ne yt so
swetely makes flourysshynges as she does / and this I know by experyence /
for she has wrought for myself diverse things which ben holden syngulersby
themself among the vynyettes of other work men. Responce. Of yt I believe the
well fair daughter / for thou may find women ynowe which ben well expert
in diverse things who yt wol de search about in the world / and yet to y^
same purpose I shall tell the of a woman of Rome.

Here it speaks of Semproyne. Ca. xlij.
SEmproyne of Rome was a woman of gre te beauty / yet notwithsta^dynge yt the
shap of her body and of her vysage passed in her time all other women in beauty
/ yet she passed and exceded in excellence of subtylte of her wit / ye which
she had so ready yt there was nothing so subtle in word nor in work but
anon she would have it so holy yt she would not fail but as her list she
would report it all yt she had herd say though it were right a great
narracyo^. This lady knew not only the latyne letters but y^ Grekyss he also
entyerly and wrote them so wyttely yt it was great marvel to se. Also of
speech and faconde and of fair manner so comely and so gentle yt by her
words and manners she could draw any person to y^ she wol de / if she would
or list to provoke them to solace / or Joy / to weep or to sorrow / in y^ same
wise she could move every man thereto / other to hardynes or to any deed of
strength / or to learn any other thing / she could styre them thereto / and
she had spoken with them. And with that so much she was of manner / of speech /
and of countenance / and full of courtoysye / and of swetnesse that one should
ne uer be satysfyed to behold her / and here her / she song so melodyously /
and by great craft played in all instruments soueraynly / and she could all
manner of plays / and to say shortly she was right able and wytty to do al
manner of things yt man nes wit might comprehend.

Here Xp^ine asks of Reason if natural prude^ ce be in woman. Ca. xliij.
IXp^ine yet said to her. Madame truly I se well yt it is true that god
worshypped be he has given understanding to woman comprehensyfe in all
things to understand / know / and to hold / yet for yt that one sees
people ynowe yt have right subtle wit and ready to feel and to understand
all yt one would show them / and ben so subtyl in feeling and retentyfe yt
there is no science but yt it be open enough to them which by hauntynge of
the scole geteth right great clargye. And nevertheless there ben many also yt
be of great reputacyon among clerks and full of science yt have but little
wisdom in manners and in worldely governance whereof I have great marvel /
for it is no doubt that the introduccyon of science techeth y^ good co^dycyons
and virtues. So I would know right feign of you my lady if it pleased you if
the understanding of woman which is enough as me seems by your proves and
that I se it by taking and retentyfe in subtle things and scyences as others
ben / but I would wit if their understanding be prompte and abyle in things
yt prudence techeth / y^ is to know to have advise upon yt which is best to
do / and of that yt ought to be leest remembrance of things passed by y^
which one may be y^ more expert by yt ensample yt one have wise sight in
governance of present things / and that one have pourueyaunce upon things to
come. These things as me seems techeth prudence.

Answer thou say true daughter / but this prudence of which thou spekest /
know yt it comes by nature to man and woman to some more / to some less /
and not to allyke / how be it that she does so much yt naturally they ben
prudent. For thou may know yt two strengthes together ben more and more
resystynge tha^ is every strength by himself. And therefore I say to the yt
every person yt by nature has prudence / that is called natural wit / and
with that conning gotten to yt person brings him to praysynge / of great
excellence / yet such has one / as thou thyselfe has said / yt another
has not. For that one is the gift of god y^ other is gotten by long studyenge
/ yet they ben both good / but some sooner shall chose natural wit without
science gotten tha^ gotten with science / and nevertheless upon this preposycyon
the re may many opposycyons be found / of the which may spring questyons
ynowe / for one might say that he does well to chose the more which is most
auaylable or profit in the comune need / and it is so that to know scyences
it profyteth a synguler person and more to all persons by the showing that
he does to others that all should not do of natural wit that he should
have. For this natural wit may not endure but during the life of the
person that has it / and when he dies his wette dies with him / but the
Science that is gotten endures perpetually for ever to them that has it for
to know in praysynge / and it profyteth unto many people / in so much that
they do teache it unto others / and makes books unto them that been to come.

So their science dies not with them. So as I may show ye by ensample of
Arystotle and of others by y^ which the scyences were brought to ye worl de y^
profyteth more to y^ world the conning go ten of them than does all y^
prudence without scy ence gotten of all yt men passed or those yt ben. Not
withstanding yt by prudence many diverse royalmes and Empyres has been well
governed and dressed / yet al these things ben faylynge and gothe with these
men / and science endures ever. But yet this questyon I shall leave vnassoylled
and to determyne to others. For it draws not to the purpose of y^
strengthynge of our cite / and I shall turn again to the questyon that thou
have made to me / that is to know if there be natural prudence in woman / of
the which thing I answer y^ so that thou may know by that yt is said to
the be fore. So as thou may se generally by the gouer naunce of them in
offices that are put to them to do / and if thou take heed it shall seem y^
good. Thou shalt find that to govern their household and to pouruaye for it
in all things after their puyssaunce they ben comunely and for the most
party right curyous quycke and dylygent in so much that their neglygent
housbandes thinks yt it is great anoyaunce to them yt they busy them so much
to do that that perteyneth to them to pour uaye and then they say / that they
would be maystresses and more wise than they. And thus they would turn it in
to evil that yt many women say to the^ in good entente and of these wise women
spe keth y^ epistle of Salamon / of which y^ substance after our purpose will
say yt it follows so.

The epistle of Salamon in the book of proverbs. Ca. xliiij.
WHo shall find a strong woman yt is to say wise / her housbande shall not
fault of all good. She is praised of all ye country / and her housbande trust
th her well / for she yeldeth him al well the and prosperyte in all times / she
seeks and pour chaseth wolles / that is to understand work to keep her meyny
i profitable works to garnysshe her hous^ande and she herself put her hands
to the business / and she is as a ship of a marchaunte yt bears all manner of
goods and pouruayeth for bread. She gives her gifts to them yt ben worcester thy /
and those ben her counsayllours. And all haboundaunce of meets and drynkes
spryngeth also to her servants. She consydereth the value of a manner or she
bye it. And by yt work of her wit she has planted vynes with the which her
house hold is pouruayed. She gyrdeth her raynes with strength and constaunce of
business / and her ar mes ben in contynuall good work she sees that her
business is good and therefore she contynueth it And for so much yt the light
of her labor shall never be quenched what dark time that comes She busyeth
herself in strong things / and with that she dysprayseth not women's works
but she herself works it. She stretches her hands to the poor and feeble
in their socoure / her house by her pourueyaunce is kept from al manner of
coldness of snow and those yt she has to govern ben clothed in double robes.
She makes for herself robes of sylke of purple of worship and of renown /
and her housbande is worshypped when he is set with ye first ancient men of ye
earth. She makes cloth lynnen and woollen yt she sells / and her clothing is
strength and worship / and for that Joy perpetual shall be to her / her
mouth speaks always words of wisdom / and the law of buxomnesse is in her
tongue. She consydereth the prouysyons of her house / and she eteth not her
bread ydell. The condycyons of her children shows yt she is their mother / and
the work of them shows her goodness. The clean raiment of her housbande
yeldeth her praysynges. She is maystresse of her daughters in all things
though they be great / she dysprayseth false praysynges and vain beauty.
Such a woman shall dread our lord and shall be praised. and she shall yield
her fruit after her work whi che prayseth her in all places.

Here it speaks of Gay Cyryle. Ca. xlv.
TO the purpose yt the epistle of Salamon says of a wise woman may well be
remembered the noble queen Gay Cyryle. This lady was of Rome or of Constaunce /
and married to a king of ye Romans. She was of prudence in the deed of
governance and right virtuous. And with the great natural wit truth and
bounte yt she had above all women she was praised to be right a great vyander
and of notable pourueyau^ ce / and though she were a queen and might well leave
to work with her hands / yet she had ye heart always to profit in some
thing and no time to be idle / but always labored in some work / and the
same wise she made ye ladies and damoyselles about her to labor / and in
especyall those yt served her. She found ye manner to sort wolles / and to
make fine clothe and of diverse sorts / and in yt she occupied her which is
for ye time a right honorable thyn ge / by which this noble lady in all
places was praised and worshypped / by which for ye reverence and memory of
her the Romans which after increased in right great puyssaunce which in her
time were not ordained and maynteyned the custo me yt to the wedding of her
daughters when the spouse should enter first in to ye house of her housbande /
one asked how she should be named / and she answered Gaye / and that gave to
understand yt she would follow this same lady in deeds and in works after her
puyssaunce.

Here it speaks of the advise of Dydo queen of Cartage. Ca. xlv^.
PRudence so as thyselfe have said befo re / is to have advise and a beholdynge
upon things that one will take on hand how yt they should be determy ned /
and yt women should be in such respect aduysed in great matters. I shall give
ye yet ensample of some puyssaunt ladies / and first of Dydo. This Dydo was
first named Elyxa / the conning of her prudence showed well by her were kes as
I shall tell ye. She founded and edyfyed a cy te in ye land of Auffryke named
Cartage of ye whi che she was lady and queen / and the manner of yt foundynge to
get ye land and to possede it showed in her great constaunce / noblesse and
virtue / without whi che to have by grace very prudence may not be in any
person. The coming of this lady was of them of Fenyce which of ye last
parties of Egyp te came in to ye land of Syrye / and there they founded and
builded diverse noble towns and Cytees Among ye which people there was a
king called Agenor of ye which descended by lygnage the fader of this lady
dydo which was named Beel and was king of Fenyce / and he put the royalme of
Cypre under his subieccyon. This king had one sone named Pygynalyo^ / and this
maiden Dydo with out mo children / and when he came to the death he charged
gretely his barons yt they should bear to these.ij. children love and truth
and so to do they ma de promise to him. When ye king was deed they crowned
Pygynalyon his sone and wedded Elyxe which was right a fair maid to a duke
of the country which was grettest after ye king and was called Acerbe Cite or
Cytens. And this Cyteon was the great priest of the temple of Hercules after
their law and was a meruayllous rich man And so he and his wife loved much
together and led a good life. But this king Pygynalyon was of shrewde
condycyons / cruel / and the most coueytous person that one might se / for
he could not have so much but he would coueyte more Elyxe his sister which
knew well his great coueytyse / and also she knew well that her housba^ de
had great treasoure / and there was great speaking of this richesse / she
counsaylled and aduysed him that he should keep him from the king / and should
put his goods in some secret place / to that entente that the king should
not take it away. Cycyens byleued well this counsel yet he kept not well
his person from the awaytes of the king as she had told him. So the king
made him to be slain on a day / to the entente yt he might have his great
treasoures / of the which death Elyxe had so great sorrow that she was nere
hand deed / and was long time in weeping and wayllynge / soro wynge pyteously
her hus band and her lord / cursynge her cruel brother that made him to dye.
But the false king that found a wyle of his opinion which was for yt that he
had found little or naught of the goods of Cytens and bare great rancoure to
his sister. For he thought that she had hydden the goods. And she which saw
well yt she was in great peril of her life was warned by her prudence to le ue
her own country and to go thens. This thing remembered / she took advise in
herself by virtuous courage of yt she should do and armed her with stren gthe
and constaunce to put in effect yt she would take on hand. So this lady knew
well yt the king was not welbyloued of his lords / nor of his people for ye
great crueltyes and extorcyons yt he did / so she took to her certain lords
and cytesyns / and also of ye comune people / and after yt that she had ma de
them swear yt they should hold it in counsel such thyngesas she would
deuyse to them she by right fair language began to declare her enten te / so
much yt they accorded to go with her / and there to they made their oath to be
true and faithful. So this lady as soon as she might made ready her nauye all
secretly / and by night she departed with al her great treasours and foyson of
people with her and she charged greatly her maryners to employ the^ to go. More
gretter malice did this lady for she knew well yt her brother as soon as he
knew of her going would send people after her / and secretly she made fylle
great males and great fardelles of things of no valewe / but they were heavy
as it had been great treasoure to yt entente yt in delyuerynge these foresaid
males and fardelles to them yt her brother would send after it should let her
pass and not to hurt her going / which thing came all to ye point / for
they were not long, gone but great foyson of people came from ye king sewyn
ge after her to have arested her but the lady well and wisely spoke to them and
said that she went in her pilgrimage / so they let her not / but when this
lady saw y^ this excusacyon would not aduayle she knew well yt he would
nothing with her but to have her treasoure, and she said yt she would send it
to him with a good will / and those yt knew well that they would do their pain
to content ye kyn ges appetyte and to apease y^ king / and then ye lady with a
sorrowful chere as though she took sorrow for it made to be delivered all
these males and bags to them. And those yt trowed verily ye they had do ne
well their deuoyre and y^ they should bring Joy full tidings to the king
departed from her / and the queen without making semblaunt of yt thou ght on
her going as soon as she might / and they went so long by day and by night
yt they aryued in ye I Will of Cypre / and there they refresshed them a ly tell
while / and anon after she took her ships when she had done her oblacyons
unto ye gods / and she brought with her ye priest of Iouys and his wife and
all his household / and he had dyuyned before yt the re should come a lady of
ye parties of Phenyce for ye which he should leave his country and should go with
her. Thus they went and left behind them ye lan de of Greece and the land of
Cecyll in ye right hand and they sailed long by ye land of Me^ulye so much
yt they aryued in Ausryke and there took ye land and anon came ye people of
ye country to se y^ manner and what people they were / and when they saw ye
lady and her people they brought plentye of vy^ay les and the lady spoke to
them right friendly and said / yt for the great welthe ye she had herd say of
yt coun tree she was come thither to dwell there if it pleased them / and they
answered yt they would well / and ye lady yt made semblau^t yt she would make
no great dwelling upon a strange land required the^ to selle to her upon ye
see cost so much land only as ye hyde of an ox would enclose there to make
dwelling places for her and her people / the which thing was granted to her
/ and the couenauntes and the price sworn between them. The lady then which
showed her wit and great prudence made to take an hyde of an ox / and made to
cut it by ye smallest thonges yt might be made and knytte the^ together all on
length and after made to stretche it upon ye ground all about y^ see cost
which con teyned a meruayllous great country of ye which thing ye sellers
were meruayllous sore abashed and meruaylled much of ye cauteyles of this
woman and not for yt yet they must hold their price* and thus this lady gate
this land in Auffryke / and in ye said fortakynge there was smyten of ye heed
of an horse / by y^ which heed and by ye cry and the flight of byr des they
understood after their dyuynynge y^ in yt cite that should be founded / there
should be in time to come men of war and wise in arms. Then this lady sent
anon all about to seek werkeme^ and opened her treasoure and made to build a
Cite / meruayllous great / fair and strong which she named Cartage / and the
tower of ye dongeon she called Byrse which is to say ye hyde of an ox / and
so as she bega^to build her cite she herd tidings of her brother which
manaced her gretely and all y^ were in her company for because she had mocked
him of ye treasoure / but she answered to ye messangers yt the treasoure was
good and fair yt she took to bear to her brother / but yt by adventure those yt
brought it took it away and put instead of y^ some false things / or yt it
might well be for ye vengeance of ye death of her housbande ye gods had no
will yt he yt slew him should rejoice his goods and there fore they have
changed it. But as for the manasynge she thought by the help of her gods
she should defend her from her brother / and then she ma de to call all those
yt she had brought thither with her and said to them yt she would not yt they
should abide with her against her courage / ne yt by her should come encombraunce
to them / by ye which if they would turn home again all or some of them y^
she would restore the^ for their labor and send the^ forth / and they
answered all with one voice yt they would live and dye with her without partynge
all the days of their lives. Then departed the messangers, and ye lady as
much as she might busyed her to perform her cyte^ and when it wasal made she
or deyned laws to ye people for to live after right and Justice / and thus she
governed so notably and by great prudence yt in all cou^tres went her renown /
and every ma^spake of her not only for the great virtue yt was in her but as
much for hardynesse of ye fair entrepryse yt she had made / and for the great
prudent governance they changed her name and called her Dydo which is as
much to say in latyne as Ui rago / y^ is to say she yt has virtue and
strength of man / and thus she lived gloryously a great while and longer had
done if fortune had been favorable to her / but as she often times enuyous to
them that been in prosperyte dyste^pered to her an hard drau ght of drink at
the last so as here after in time and place I shall tell the.

Here it speaks of Opis. Ca. xlvij.
OPys or Ops yt sith was called goddess and mother of gods was of ye ancient
people / had in reputacyon as right a wise woman for yt that after ye saying
of the old hystoryes right prudently and constauntly she could hold her
content among ye prosperytees and aduersytees yt happened to her in her time.
This lady was dou ghter of Urane yt was right a puyssaunt man in Greece and of
Uesta his wife which was right rude and little knowing of ye world / and
this lady Opys or Ops was wedded to Saturnus y^ kyn ge of Crete which was her
brother. So this kyn ge had a vysyon yt his wife should be delivered of a man
child yt should slay him / and for to void this foresaid destenye he ordained
that all ye men chyl dren yt the queen should have should be slain / yet for
all yt this lady did so much by her wit whi che found such cauteyles yt
she respyted her three sons from ye death / yt is to know Iupyter Neptunus /
and Pluto / and she was gretely worship ped sith / and her wisdom praised /
and for her understanding / and for the auctoryte of her chyl dren she gate in
her time so great voice / and worcester ship in the world yt the lewd people of the
coun tree called her goddess and mother of gods. For her'sones in their
living was counted for gods for yt they were in some things more knowing
then other men that were all as bestes. So there were ordained and sacryfyed
temples / the which opinion the foles kept long time / and the same wise at
Rome in the time of the prosperyte of the Romans was this folly / and then
had this goddess in great reverence.

Of Lauyne daughter of the king Latin. Capitulo.xlviij.
LAuyne which was queen of the La rynes had also praysynge of pruden ce. This
noble lady was descended of this Saturnus king of Crete of whom we have
spoken / and was daughter of the king Latin / and after Turnus the king of
Turylyens coueyted to have her to wife / but her fader which had answer of ye
god des that she should be given to a lord of Troy which tarried the marriage
long time / not with sta^dynge yt his wife labored ye contrary / and when
Eneas was ary^ed in Italy he asked leave of the king Latyne to descend upon
his land / but he gave him not only yt leave / but he granted him his
daughter in marriage. And for this cause Tur nus moved war against Eneas in
the which was great slaughter and king Turnus was slay ne himself. And Eneas
had ye vyctory and wedded Lauyne that had sith a sone by him of whom she mas
great when Eneas dyed. But when it ca^^e that she should be delivered for the
great dread that she had that a sone that Eneas had of another woman / which
child was named Asta nyus that for couetyse of reygnyge should not slay the
child that she was delivered of. She went and was delivered in a wood and
gave the child a name Iulyus Syluyus. This lady would never after be married /
and she governed her in her wydo whode right prudentely / and maynteyned the
royalme by great wisdom / and her sone in law had her in so great love yt he
had none evil will against her nor his brother. But after that yt he had
builded the ryte of Alba he went to dwell there / and Lauyne governed the land
right wisely till the child was grown / of the which child came Remus and
Romulus which founded To me / and the high Romayne princes that came sith.
what would thou that I should say mo re dear daughter / me seems that I
have brought for the proves ynowe to mine entente / that is to understand of
that I she we by quycke reason and ensample that god has not had / ne has
in reprobacyon the femynyne use as these men have / so as thou see clearly.
And as it has appeared and yet shall appear by the dysposycyon of mine other
two systers that been here. For well me seems y^ from hens forth it ought to
suffyse in that that I have made the walls of the cloystre of the cite of
ladies. Now ben all things accheued and ordained. Now comes forth mine
other, two systers / and by their help and deuyse let the remenaunte of the
building be performed and made an end by them.

Here ends the table.
Here begins the second party of the book of ye Cite of Ladies the which
tells how and by whom the Cite was builded within and peopled. And ye first
chapter speaks of ye.v. Sybylles. Capitulo. Primo.


AFter the words of the first lady that was named Reason. The second la die
drew her toward me the which was named ryghtwysnesse / and thus said to me.
Dear friend I ought to draw me abacke / nor to bellowe to build and to make
the stone work with thy help in cyrcuyte of ye cloystre of the wail now
made by my sister Reason of the cite of Ladies. Now take thy toles and come
before and tempre thy mortar in eve ry corner / and build on fast with the
foot of thy pen. For I shall deliver enough whereof / and by y^ virtue of
god we shall have good building and high palayces / royal and noble mansyons
of these excellent ladies of great worship and renown che shall be lodged in
this cite / and shall abide perpe tually fro hens forth. The^ IXp^ine herynge y^
worcester de of this worshypfull lady said in this manner / Right excellent lady se
me here all ready. No we command for my desire is to obey / and she laid to
me thus. Friend behold these fair stones more fayrer than any precious stones
and shynynge whi che I have sought for y^ and ordained them, ready to lodge them
in the ma^onry seems y^ yt I have been idle while my sister Reason and you have been busy Or set them a row after my line yt thou see here by the ordinance
yt I shall tell the. Among the ladies of sovereign dygnyte may well be put in
the row ofhyghnesse the hyghly fulfilled of Sa pyence the wise Sybelles the
which as old an tentyke auctours put in their wrytynges were.x. by nombre
though yt some put but.ix. O my dear friend take heed here what more worship
in deed of reuelacyons did god ever to a prophet that he loved more than he
gave and granted to these right noble ladies of whom I speak to the did not
he send in to them y^ holy spyryte of prophecy so much y^ it seemed not only
of that y^ they said that it should be a pronosty cacyon of time to come / but
it seemed as it were of chronicles of thyn ges passed and came so much that they
were cle rely understanding in their things written / and also of the coming
of our lord Ihesu Christ whi che came right long time after they spoke more
clearly as it is found than did all the prophets These ladies used al their
lives in maiden hode and dyspraysed pollucyon / and all were named Sy belles /
and it is not to understand y^ it was their propre names / but Sybelle is to
say as knowyn ge the thought of god / and so they were called for that that
they prophesied meruayllous things that it was conuenyent that y^ they said
should co me to them of the pure thought of god. So it is a name of office and
no propre name. These ladies were borne in diverse countres of the world and
not all in one time / and all they prophesied great foyson of things to come
and in especyall of our lord Ihesu Christ and of his coming / so as it is
said right clearly though that they were al paynymes and not of the law of
Jews which that time was the law of god. The first was borne in the land of
Perse / and for that she was na med Persya. The second was of Lybye / and was
called Lybyca. The third of De^phe engendered in the temple of Appolyn / and
was named Delphyca. And this lady preched the destruccyon of Troy long time
before / and Ouyde put many verses of her in his book. The fourth was of
ytalye and was called Symerya. The fyfte was of Babylon and was called
Erophyle. This lady answered to them of greece of things y^ they demand her /
that Troy and ylyon the strong castle should perysshe by them / and y^ Omere
shol de write lesyngly / also she was called Erytell for y^ she dwelled in y^
I Will / and there were her books found. The.vj. was of the I Will of Samos and was
called Samya. The.vij. was called Cunyana and was borne of ytallye in Cumynys
in y^ land of Champayne. The.viij. was named Elespontyne and was borne
hesponte in the fe^de of Troy and floured in y^ temple of y^ noble auctoures
Solyn and Tyry. The.ix. was of Frygya therfo re she was named Frygica. This
lady spoke much of y^ falling of diverse lordshyps / and she spoke much of y^
coming of y^ false prophet Antecryst The.x. was called Tyburtine / and by
another na me Albuyna of whom the wrytynges are much praised for that y^ she
wrote clearly of Ihesu Christ and notwithstanding that these Sybylles were
borne of paynymes all they reproved their law / and blamed them y^ they
worshypped diverse god des saying yt there is but one god / and that all their
ydolles were but vain.

Here it speaks of Sybyll Erytee. Ca. ij.
Among y^ other Sybelles Eryte had the gretest prerogatyue of wisdom. For of
her the virtue was so great by a synguler and a special gift of god yt she
wrote and prophesied diverse things to come so clearly yt it seemed better to be
a gospel than prophecye / and at the request of the greeks she put their
labors clearly in wrytynges / their ba taylles / and the destruccyon of Troy
yt it was never clerer after it was done than it was before. The same wise she
descryued and put to gyder in few words and true y^ Empire and the lordshyp
of the To maynes / and their diverse adventures long time before y^ it was come
/ and so it seemed better to be a short remembrance of things passed than of
things of time to come. And a more greter deed she did and a more marvel /
for she prophesied and opened plainly the secretenesse of the thought of god
yt was never opened by the prophets but by ^ygures and derke words and
couerte. That is to know the holy ghost / the mystery of the Incarna cyon of
the sone of god in y^ maiden Mary. And in her book there was written / Ihesus /
Ceytos / Cenyos. Sothor which was to say in english Ihesu Christ sone of god
and sauyoure / and there was also the life and the works of him / the treason
and the taking and all the scornynges and his death. The resurreccyon / the
vyctory / and the Assencyon / the coming of the holy ghost to ye apostles / y^
coming at y^ day of Judgment / and y^ same wise y^ she had said and compounded
shortly the mystery of y^ christian faith / and not onele she told y^ deeds to
come / y^ is to say y^ day of Judgment / y^ trembling day the earth shall
sweet blood / y^ king shall come fro heaven yt shall Judge all y^ world / and yt
both good and evil shall se / every soul shall take again his body / and
every soul shall have praysynge after his deserte. There richesse shall fail
and y^ false images also / y^ fire shall brenne both see and land / and al
thing shall perysshe except the saints loved of god / there shall be no
thing hid / all shall be open / and all things shall dye / there shall be
weeping and sorrowful people shall strain their tethe for dystres The sone / y^
moan / the sterres shall lose their clerenesse / hills and valays shall be made
even / the sea and y^ land and all things shall be brought in egalnes The
trompe of heaven shall call mankind to come to the Judgment / then there shall
be great dread and every man shall weep for his folly. Then shall the earth be
made new / kings and princes shall come before the Judge which shall give
every man after his deserte. Fire of brymstone shall depart from heaven which
shall fall in to hell. And all these things ben contained in.xxvij. verses
that this Sybylle made. For the which merytes as Bocace says and other wise
auctoures which that writes of her holds yt she was right well byloued with
god / and that she ought to be honored more than any other woman after ye holy
sayn tes of paradyse. This woman kept her in vyrgy nyte all ye days of her
life / and so it is to presume yt she was brought up in all clennesse / for in
an heart evil tatches / or fouled with vices it may not be that much light
of knowing of things to come might have his being.

Of the Sybyll Almethea. Ca. iij.
ALmethea y^ Sybylle was borne as it is said in ye land of Champayne whi che
is nyghe Rome. This lady had al so right especyall grace of ye spyryte of
prophecy / and she was borne as some auc tours say in ye time of the
destruccyon of Troy / and lived unto ye time of Tarquyne y^ proud / and some
called her Deiphyle. This lady notwithstandyn ge yt she lived a meruayllous
great age she was a vyrgyne all her life / and for y^ great wisdom of her some
poets feigned yt was loved of Phoebus whi che they called god of wisdom / and
that by ye gift of this Phoebus she gate so much of understanding and lived
long / which is to understand y^ for her maydenhode and for yt she was loved
of god y^ sone of sapyence which enlumyned her with ye clerenesse of prophecye
by y^ which she has said before and written many diverse things to come. Over
this it is written that she being at y^ ryuage of Bayoule nyghe ye lake of
hell had a noble and a meruayllous a^swere and reuelacyon deuyne whi che is
written and kept in her name and is in vere Ry med. And though it be right an
ancient thing it is yet a great marvel of y^ gretenesse and the excellence
of this to whom it is well co^^ydered and beholden. Some faynynges say yt the
led Eneas to hell and brought him again. This woman came to Rome and
brought with her.ix. books the which she presented to sell to Tarquyne ye king
/ but as he would refuse to take them of ye price yt she as ked she burnt.iij.
of them in his presence / and that other day she asked for the other.vi. books
yt were left y^ same price as she asked for y^ hole.ix. and swear yt if one
would not give the same price yt she asked anon she would brenne.iij. of them
/ and the day after y^ king Tarquyne gave her the same price yt she asked
first. So these books were well kekte and it was found yt they declared
clearly y^ acts yt should come unto y^ Romans / and the great case y^ sith
has happened they found written in y^ said books / y^ which syngulerly be
kept in y^ treasourye of the Emperors as for to receive counsel of them as
it were an answer deuyne* Now take heed here sweet friend how god gave so
gre te grace to a women yt she had wit to counsel and advise not only one
Emperor in his life / but to all them yt were to come to Rome and all ye deeds
of ye Empire during ye world. So tell me I the pray where was there ever a
man y^ should do yt / and y^ as a fool not long ago heldest y^ evil co^tente
to be of ye kind of such creatures thinking ye god would have had it in
reprocyon / of this Sybylle speaks Uyrgyll in his book all in verses. She en
ded her days and her tomb was showed long after

Of dyders ladies prophets. Ca. iiij.
THese foresaid ladies were not only by ye gift of god prophetysynge to ye
world / but there has been great foyson of others i al law es yt has been
holden / for if thou look in ye law of Jews y^ shalt find ynowe as Delborra
which was a woman prophet in ye time of Iuges of Israel / by y^ which
Delborra ye people of god we re delivered out of ye bondage of ye king of
Canaan which had holden them in seruytude.xx. years. The blessed Elysabeth
cosyne to our lady was not she a prophet when she said to ye blessed mayde^ yt
came to vysyte her / whens comes this y^ the mother of god is come to me / yet
she knew yt she was conceived of ye holy ghost / but it was by ye spyryte of
prophecye. Also my friend ye good lady Anne hebrewe yt lyghted ye lamps in ye
temple had not she ye spyryte of prophecy as Symeo^ had ye prophet to whom our
lady presented Ihu^* christ on Candelmasse day upon ye awter of ye temple and ye
holy prophet knew yt it was the savior of ye world / and took him between
his arms / yet the good lady Anne which went about in ye temple doing her
office / anon as she saw ye holy vyrgyne holding her sone enter in to ye
temple / she knew in spyryte yt it was ye savior of ye world / she k^^^ed
down and worshypped him and said with an high voice yt it was he that was
come to save all the world. Thou shalt find women pro phetes ynowe in ye
law of Jews and thou look after them / and in the christian law as infynyte as
ye saints / but now pass we over these here / for yt that one might say yt
god had pryuyleged them by his special gift* and let us pass over speaking
yet of paynymes. The queen of Saba of who me holy scripture makes mencyon yt
when she yt was of sovereign understanding herd speak of the wisdom of
Salamon of whom yt fame ran by all the world she desired to se him / and for
that y^ she came out of a corner of the oryent one of ye last parties of the
world / she left her country and rode by the land of Othyope / and of Egypt
by the passa ges of the reed see / and by ye great deserts of Arabe / and with
a noble company of princes / lords / and kny ghtes / and of many noble ladies
with great estate / and treasoure of many precious things / and aryued in the
cite of Iherusalem to se and vysyte the wise Salamon / and to know if it were
true that folk said of him in all the world. So Salamon received her with
great worship as it was reason and she was with him a great while and proved
his wisdom in many things. Many demaundes and questyons she made to him
which were right derke / and couerte / the which he answered after that she
asked so gretely yt she said that he might not have so great wisdom by man's
wit / but by the special gift of god. This lady g^^te him many diverse
precious things among y^ which there were plants of little trees yt yielded
lycoure and bare bawme. The which king Salamon made plant nyghe a water
called Allephater and commanded yt they should be labored and kept wisely
and also she gave hy^ many precious Iewelles. Of ye wisdom of this lady and of
her prophecy speaks many diverse scryptures yt says / yt as she was in
Iherusalem / and that Salamon led her for to se ye noblesse of the temple yt
he had made to build. She saw a long board yt was couched attrauers of a
mire and made as a planke to pass over the depnesse. Then the body rested in
beholdynge ye planke and worshypped it and said / this plan ke which is now
holden in great foulness and put under ye feet shall be yet worshypped above
all ye trees of the world and garnysshed with precy ous stones and treasoure
of princes / and upon this sa me planke he shall dye yt shall bring the Jews
law to naught. They held this word but for a scorn or a Iape but put him
away and hid him in ye earth in a place where as they trowed that it should
never be found / but that y^ god will have kept is well saved. For as well as
they could hy de it yet it was found at the last in the time of ye passion of
our lord Ihesu Christ / and of this planke was the cross on y^ which our
sauyoure suffered his passion / and then was the prophecye made true of this
lady.

Of Nycostrate / and of others. Ca. v.
THis Nycostrate of whom mencyon was made before was also a woman prophet /
for as soon as she had passed ye flode of Tybre and she with her sone Eua^der
where hystoryes ynowe ma keth mencyon was upon ye mount Pallentyne she
prophesied yt upon y^ hill should be builded a cite ye most named yt ever was
in ye world / and shol de be ye chief and sovereign of al lordshyppes world ly
/ and to y^ conclusyon yt she would be y^ tyrst yt should lay a stone / she
builded there a strong castle so as it is said before and there is Rome
builded sith and edyfyed. Also Cassandra ye noble maid of Troy daughter to
king Pryamus of Troy / and sister to the worshypfull Hector / she was so
great a clarke yt she knew all ye crafts and was also a pro phete. For this
maid would never take man thou ghe it had been a great prince and she had in
spyryte yt y^ was to come she was ever full of sorrow and heavy nesse / and when
she saw ye great prosperyte of Troy so gretely flourysshed in magnyfycence
before y^ y^ war began between y^ Troyans and the greeks she made much
sorrow and wept sore beholdynge ye noblesse and richesse of ye cite / her
fair and worship full brethren and specially ye noble Hector yt was so
worshypfull a man she might not hold her peace for the great sorrow yt was to
come. And when she saw ye war begin tha^ began her sorrow / so she seized
not to cry and wayle and counsayled her fader and her brethren to make peace
with the greeks or else without fail with y^ war they should be destroyed /
but they took no charge of all her words nor byleued her / and always as she y^
gretely play ned and of good right this great loss and damage my ght not be
still by y^ which often times she was bete^ of her fader and of her brethren
y^ said she was a fool / but for all y^ she would not hold her in peace to dye
therefore ne spared not to speak without seasyn ge. For y^ which to make her
hold her peace they made her to be shytte in a chamber to put away her noise
from their eeres / yet it had been better y^ they had byleued her / for it
happened to them as she had told them before. So they byleued at the end and
then it was to late for them / and so it happens often times y^ a fool will
never believe a thing till he have it. Also was it not a meruayllous Pronosty
cacyon y^ the queen Basyne made / y^ had been y^ wife of the king of Thorynge
and sith was wife to Chylderyke ye.iiij. king of France so as the Chronicles
conteyneth it. For y^ hystory says y^ the night of y^ wedding of her and of
y^ king Chyl deryke / she said to him y^ he should hold hy^ chaste y^ night
and he should se a meruaylous vyspon. And then she said to him anon after y^
he should rise and go to the door of the chamber and not well that that he
should se. The kyuge went thither and it seemed him that he saw great bestes
that men call Unycornes / Leopardes / and Lions / that went and came by the
palace / so he returned again all aferde and demanded y^ queen what that
should sygnyfye / and she answered him that she would tell him in the morning
/ and that he should have no dread / but to go thither again / and so he did.
And it seemed him that he same great beres and wolves y^ would run one upon
another. The queen sent him again the third time / and him seemed that he
saw dogs / and little beestes / each of them dyspysynge other. And as the
king was much adradde of this thing. The queen told him the aduy syon of
the beestes that he had seen / which sygnyfyed diverse generacyons of princes
y^ should reygne in France that should come of them / y^ which their
condycyons and their deeds should draw after y^ nature of those beestes that
he had seen. So thou may clearly se fair love how our lord has made
open often times his secrets to the world by women.

Here it speaks of Anthonye that became Empress. Capitulo.vj.
THat was no little secret that god showed by reuelacyon of a woman to
Iustynyan / which was sith Em peroure of Constantynoble as y^ hystoryes
tells. This Iustynya^ was keeper of the treasours and coffers of the Emperor
Iustyne. It happened in a day that as this Iusty nyan was gone to dysporte him
in y^ feldes / and had brought with him to be his comfort a woman that he
loved much which was called Anthony / and when the hour of night was come
and that this Iustynyan had lust to sleep / and laid his heed in his lovers
lap. And when he was on sleep / then Anthony saw a great Egle come flyen ge
over them which payned him to come down to keep the vysage of Iustynyan fro
y^ brennynge of the sone with his wings. This woman which was wise understood
the sygnyfyaunce. And when he was awaked she reasoned with him by fair words
and said. Fair sweet love I have loved you much and love you as him which is
the master of my body / and of my love as ye know well. So it is no reason
that a lover well loved of his love ought to deny her nothing. And for that I
would require you in reward of my maydenhede / and of my love but one gift
the which though it be right great to me it shall seem to you but right little
if ye will grant it me. Iustynya^ answered to his love that she should require
him hardely / and that she should fail of nothing y^ he might grant her.
Then said Anthony. My love y^ gift that I require of you is this / that when
ye shall be Emperor y^ ye have not in dyspraysyng your poor love Anthony / but
y^ she may accompanye her with your worship and with your Empire by true marriage /
and so to promise me right anon / when Iustynyan had herd the damoysell thus
speak he began to laughe trowynge that she said it in Iape. And as he y^ held
it as a thing impossyble to hap pen to him promised her y^ without fail he
would take her to his wife when he should be Emperor and so he swear by all
his gods / and then she thanked him hertely / and in token of this promise
she gave him her ring / and he gave his to her. And anon the began to say. I
bring the tidings certainly that thou shalt be Emperor and that it shall
be in short time. And then they depar ted. So it passed not long time after
that as the Emperor Iustyne had assembled his host to go upon them of Perce a
sykenesse took him thrughe the which he dyed. And as after the princes and ba
rons were assembled to chose a new Emperor and they might not well accord /
it happened that in manner of dyspyte of another / they chose Iustynya^ to be
Emperor / the which slewthed not but as soon as he might / right vygorously
with a great host ran upon these Percyens and wanne y^ ba tail and took the
king of Perce and conquered there great good and worship / and when he was
returned home i to his palace Anthony his love forgate hy^ not but dydey^ she
might to enter by great subtylte there where he sat i his trone with his princes
/ and she kneled before him and began her reason and said y^ she was a maid y^
was come to him to ask right and reason of a ma^y^ had betrouthed her and had
given her his ring and taken hers. The Emperor which yet thought not on her
/ answered her and said if that man had betrouthed her reason would that he
took her / and if she might prove that she said yt she should have right and
that he should take her. And then Anthony drew the ring from her finger / and
showed it to him / and said. Noble Empe roure I may prove it by this ring /
behold it if thou know it. Then the Emperor saw well yt he was taken by
his words yet not for yt he thou ght to keep his promise. And anon he made
her to be led into his chamber to array her in noble garments / and took her
to wife.

Here Xp^ine speaks to ryghtwysnes. Ca. vii.
MAdame by that that I understand and se openly the great right of women
against that of which they be so mo che accused makes me to know bet ter
from hense forth the wrong of their accusers. And yet I may not hold me
still of a comune custom yt renneth among these men And in the same wise
among some women / that the comune custom is this / that when these women be
with child / and be delivered of a maid child / the husbands ben wroth
with it often ty mes and chydeth / for that his wife was not dely uered of a
sone. And their nyce wives which ought to have sovereign Joy of that / that
god has saufely delivered them / and thank him with good heart / they
troubled themself also / for yt their house bands ben troubled with it. And
madame from whens comes that / y^ they be wroth / be the daughters of more
preiudyce than y^ sons / or be they of less love to their fader and mother and
less charge to them than be the sons. Answer. Dear friend for that that thou
demaundest me y^ cause whens it comes I answer the certainly that / that
comes of right great symplenesse and ygnoraunce to them that troubles them
so. Notwithstanding that the pryncypal cause that moves them thereto is for ye
cost of their goods yt they must vnpurse and lay out when they be in the age
of marriage. And also some does it for that they doubt ye perils yt they
may be deceived by evil counsel in symples / but al these causes in regard
be of no reason For as touching the doubt that they do folly / there ben but
few / but they enfourme their children when they ben young and little and that
ye mother gives them good ensamples between themself in honest and techynge.
For if the mother were of a folly life it should be little ensample to the
daughter / and that she be kept from evil company and holden short in time
of youth / it is the prerogatyue to good condycyons all her life. Item as to
the cost I trow if the fader and mother behold well that yt the sone cost them
/ as to make them to learn scyences or craft / as to hold them in estate and
also in superfluous despenses / in lewd companyes / and in many nycetees / I
trow they should find but little advantage in sons more than in daughters.
And the wrath and sorrow yt they cause often times their faders and moders to
have / as in following of dyssolute life and so much grefe and cost to their
faders and moders I trow it should pass the sorrow that they have for their
dough ters. Behold how many sons thou shalt fyn de that have nourysshed
swetely and mekely their faders and moders in their age / so as they ought to
do. I trow thou shalt find them but thynne sown. And though ye fader and
mother make as much of their sons as their goods / when they be wexen mighty
and rich and their fader poor they will despise him / and they will be wroth
and shameful when they se him. And if their fader be rich they will desire
his death to have his good. All be not such / but there be many of them / and
when the sons be married / god knows the gre te coueytyse that they have
always to draw from ye fader and mother / and they would not recke thou ghe they
should dye for hongre / so that they might have al. And where as ye mother
abides wedo we and where as they ought to comfort her / and to be staff and
berer up of her age / they will cry on her till they have drawn from her that
yt she has And if she will not give them enough after their entente they will
have no conscience to move plee against her. Of such sons there be ynowe / and
some daughters happily also. yet if thou take good head I trow thou shalt find
sons more shrewysshe to the fader and mother than daughters. And yet I put case
that all were good / it is comunely said y^ doghters hold better company to
the faders and moders than the sons. And more vysyteth / comfort / and
keeps them in their sykenes and ege The cause is this / for that yt the sons
trauaylleth more up and down in the world here and there / and the daughters
be more coye and hold them more nyghe so as thou may se thyselfe. For
notwithstanding that thy brethren were right na turall and of great love /
they be gone in to the world and thou alone art abiding to keep company with
thy good mother ye which is a sovereign comfort in her age. And for that I
say to the in conclusyon that they be more foles that troubles them and be
wroth when they have borne daughters. And for that that upon this purpose thou
have put me / I will tell the of some women of whom among other the hystoryes
writes / which were right kind unto their fader and mother.

Here it begins to speak of doughtes yt loved fader and mother / and first of
Drypetrue. Ca. viij.
OF great love to her fader was Drypetrue queen of Laodocye / she was daughter
to the great king Mytrydaces And she loved him so much yt she followed him in
all bataylles. She was of a strange shappe in some things / for she had a
double rewe of tethe which was a great deformyte / but she was of so great
love to her fader yt she ^^te hy^ never another in prosperyte ne i evil fortune
And though she were a queen and lady of a great land by the which she might
well be at rest and ease in her country / she was in every place partycy pante
of all the pains and trauayles that her fader had in many diverse armies there
as he was And when he was ouercomen of the great Pompee / she left him never /
but served him by great charge and dylygence.

Of Isyphyle. Ca. ix.
ISyphyle put her in peril of death to save her fader / which was named
Thoant and was king of Leuydynyens. And as his country rebelled against him and
with a great woodnesse came to the palace to sle the king. Isyphyle ano ne
hid him in one of her coffres. And after she lepte out to appease the people
/ but i^ auayled her nothing / and as they sought the king all abou te and
might not find him. They put the points of their glayues against Isyphyle and
gretel^ manaced her of death if she would not tell them o^ her fader. And with
that they promised her if they might know by her where he was / they would
crown her queen / and they would obaye to her. But she which coueyted more y^
life of her fader then to be queen / ne was not aferde for dread of d^ the
answered them with an hardy courage / and without sign of any dread / that
without fail he was fled a great while before. And at y^ lastfor^ that they
might not find him / and that she so surely affermed them that he was fled /
they byleued her and crowned her queen / and a while she reigned peasybly upon
them. And she yt a little while had kept her fader secretly for dread at the
last yt by some enuyous person he might be accused / put him out by night and
sent him by see to another place with great goods / but as this thing was at
the last opened to the untrue Cytezyns they cha ced their queen Isyphyle out of
the royalme and wol de have slain her if her great goodness had not kept her.

Of the maid Claudyne. Ca. x.
AS a sign of great love showed the maiden Claudyne to her fader / then when
by the good deeds of him / and by ye great vyctoryes that he had had in many
bataylles returned him / and vyctoryously was received at Rome in the
sovereign worship that they called y^ tryumphe / which was a right great
worship / in y^ which they received princes when they returned ouercomers of
any great deeds. So this same fader of Claudyne which was one of the princes
of Rome right worshypfull being in this honor of tryum phe was assailed by
another of the lords of Rome that hated him. But when Claudyne his dou ghter
which was sacred to the gods Besta / as we say here a relygyous of some
abbay / and was with the ladies of her order that were gone to the processyon
against this foresaid prince / so as the custom was / herd the noise / and
knew yt her fa der was assailed of his enemies. Then the great love that the
daughter had to the fader made her forgete all the simple behauynge that a
relygyous woman should have commonly. Also she put back all dread and* fere in
such manner that anon she lepte forth and went flyenge thrughe the prece /
and boldly went among the swerdes that she saw upon her fader / and took
him by the throat yt she saw next him / and to her power took strongly upon
her to defend her fader / there y^ prece was so great that anon the medlynge
was departed. Then as the worshypfull Romans had of custo me to set much by
every parsone y^ did any worshypful act of marvel / praised gretely this
may den and gave her great laud of that she had done.

Here it speaks of a woman that gave her mother sowke in the prison. Ca. xi.
ORete love also had a woman of Rome to her mother / of whom the hystoryes
speaks. It happened that y^ said mother for a certain crime that she was
attaynted of / was condemned to per petuall prison. And that none should give
her ney there mete nor drink / by the which in this manner she should fynysshe
her life. The daughter co^stray ned of great love being sorry for this
condempnacyon / required them that kept the prison of a specyal grace / that
she might vysyte her mother every day while she was on live / to that entente
that she might counsel her of pacyence. And shortly to say / so much she
employed and prayed / that y^ kepers of the prison had pity on her / and
granted her yt she should vysyte her mother every day. But or she should go to
her that she bare with her no vy tail. And when this vysytacyon had endured by
so many days / that it was impossyble to the Iay loures yt the woman prisoner
might live so long naturally without mete and yet was not deed / and
considered yt none other vysyted her but her daughter / which they serched
right dylygently or she should go in to her mother / they meruaylled right
strongely what that might be. And on a day they spyed the mother and the
daughter together y^ which was lately desyuered of a child / and then they
saw her give the tete to her mother so much till she had al / and thus the
mother drew milk of the pappes of her daughter. And thus the daughter yielded
to the mother in her age that yt she had taken of her in her youth. This
co^tynuell dylygence and great love of y^ daughter to y^ mother moved the
Iaylours to great pity and they reported it to the Iuges / then of manly
compassyon they delivered the mother to the daughter. Also to the purpose of
love of the daughter to y^ fader one may say of ye good and wise Grysylde
which sith was marquyse of Saluce / of whom I shall tell hereafter the great
virtue / stablenesse / and constaunce. O how true love has nature given unto
her / to be so busy to serve her fader Ianycle so humbly and obeysauntely in
his sykenesse / and in his age / that she in her clennesse and vyrgynyte / and
in y^ flower of her youth nourysshed / and governed so dylygentely by the
labor / and the craft of her hands getynge / with great charge and
business the poor life of them both. O in a good hour were those daughters
borne of su che bounte / and so great love to their fader and mother. For
notwithstanding that that they do that they ought to do / yet they get great
merit to the soul / and great praysynge is given them of y^ world / and in
the same wise to the sons that been of y^ co^dycyon. what would thou that I
should say more I could tell ye ensamples ynowe of like case but enough
suffyseth.

Here ryghtwysnesse says that she has accheued the stone work of the Cite /
and it is time to people it. Ca. xij.
Now me seems right dear friend y^ our building is well lift up of our Cite
of Ladies / and y^ high masonry al alonge the large streets / and the royal
palayces / strong buyldynges of dongeons / and defensable towers lyfted right
high that it may be seen a far. So it is time fro hensforthe that we
begin to people this noble cite / to yt entente that she be not waste nor voy
de but enhabyted of ladies of great excellence / for we will none other people.
O how fortunate shall y^ cytezynes of our cite be / for they shall have no
need to have dread nor doubt to be dyslodged of their possessyon by
strangers. For this is y^ propryete of our work y^ the owners shall not need
to be put out. And now there is a new femenyne royalme bygon / but it is
much more worthyer than that other was. For it shall need yt the ladies lodged
here goo out of their land for to conceive ne bring forth new heirs to
maynteyne their possessyon by diverse ages fro lygne to lygne. For it shall
suffyse enough for ever of them yt we shall put in it now / for this is y^
destyne of them / yt they shall never dye. And without fail they shall abide
in the same age / beauty / and fresshnesse / be they young or o^de that we
shall put therein. And when we have peopled it with noble cytezynes. Dame
Iustyne my sister shall come after yt shall bring thither y^ queen / above all
other women most excellent / accompanied with pryncesses of great dygny te /
which shall enhabyte y^ most high places and high dongeons. For it is good
reason y^ when y^ queen shall come thither that she find the cite gar nysshed
and peopled of noble ladies that should receive her with great worship as their
sovereign lady and Empress of all their kind / yet what cytezyns shall we put
there / shall they be unstable women or defamed / certainly nay / but they shall
be al worshypfull women and of great auctoryte. For mo re fair people ne more
great array may not be in a cite than good women and worshypfull. Now rise
leefe friend / now put the in busynes and go before / and let us seek them.

Here Xp^ine asks of dame ryghtwysnesse if y^ be true y^ these books and
these men says yt the life of marriage is hard to bear for ye occasyon of
women and to their great wrong. And ryghtwysnesse answers and begins to
speak of the great love of women to their husbands. Ca. xiij.
THen in going to seek the fore said ladies by ye ordinance of dame
ryghtwysnesse / in go ynge I said these words / ma dame without fail ye and
reason have assoyled and concluded so well and so fair my questyons and
demanndes y^ I can not replye no more / and I hold me right well enfourmed of
yt y^ I sought. And by you two I have learned enough how al things able ought
to be done and learned / as much in strength of bodies as in wysdo me of
understanding / and if al virtues be possible to be executed by women. But yet
I pray you y^ ye would tell and certyfye me / if it be true y^ these men say /
and so many auctours bears witness thrughe the which I am in right a great
thought / y^ the ly fe of y^ order of marriage be to men heavy and enuyron ned of
so great tempest by y^ blame and importunyte of women and of their ravenous
grefe / as it is wry ten in many books / and people ynowe witnesses it. and
that they love their husbands and their com pany so little / yt nothing
noyeth them so much / by y^ which to void such inco^uenyences / many have
counsayled y^ wise men yt they mary not / certefyenge yt few of them be true
in their party / and also walere writes to Ruphyn / and Theophrastus in his
book says yt no wise man ought to take a wife / for there is but little love
in a woman / but great charge and Jangling. And if ye man do it to be y^
better served and kept in his sykenes / more better and more truly a true
servant shall keep him and ser ue him / and shall not cost him so much. And if
y^ woman be syke y^ husband is in great sorrow / and dare not speak one word
nyghe her. And enough of such things he tells which should be to long to
reherce / wherefore I say mine own lady that if these things be true / these
defaultes be so great yt all ye grace and virtues yt they may have be brought
to naught and quenched. Answer. Certesdere friend so as y^ thyselfe has said
sometime to y^ pur pose yt one may led a process well at his ease that pledeth
without party. And I promise the that* y^ books that so says women made them
not. But I trow yt he yt would make a new book yt were true of the debates
of marriage and yt he were enfour med of y^ truth one should find other
tidings Alas dear friend how many women be there as thou know thyselfe yt
uses their weary life in y^ band of marriage by the hardness of their husba^
des in more greter penance than they were escla ues among the sarazynes. Ha
god how many hard betynges without cause and reason / how ma ny vylanous
wrongs and outragyous bondages suffers many of these good and worshypfull
women which all cry not out an harowe / and such yt dye for hungre / and for
mysease / and their husbands ben at the tavern / and in other dyssolute
places / and yet y^ poor women shall be beten at their coming home / and that
shall be their souper. And to say yt these husbands ben any thing sorrowful for
the sykenesse of their wives. I pray the my lo ue where be they. And without
that / y^ I say more to the / thou may know well yt these sclaundres said
against women who so says it they were and be things found and said of
vyolence and ayenste truth. For the husbands ben masters over the women /
and not y^ women their maystresses / so they would never suffer such auctorite
of their wives But I promise the yt all maryages be not maynteyned in such
contents it were great damage. For there ben some that lives in peasyblenesse
/ lo ue / and truth together / by that that y^ parties be good and dyscrete /
and reasonable / though it be not of evil husbands. There ben right good /
worshypfull / and wise / and that the women that meteth with them lives as to
the glory of y^ world in right a good hour for them. And y^ thou may well
know by thyselfe that and thou had such one that in thy Judgment none
other man passed him in all bounte / peasyblenes / truth / and good lo ue of
the which the sorrows of yt that death took him away from the shall never
part from thine heart. And though that I say to the / and it is trou the that
there ben many good women right evil led by their diverse housbandes. Know
it for truth yt there be many diverse women / shrewde cruel / and cursed /
and without reason. For if I should say that all were good / lightly I might be
proved a liar. But in y^ less party / and of that party which be good I
meddle me not. For such evil women ben as things out of their nature. But for
to speak of those that been good / for yt that this Theofrastus of whom thou
have spoken says / yt also truly and as busely shall a ma^be kept in his
sykenesse / or in his need by his servant as by his wife. A how many good
women ben there so bu sy to serve their husbondes hole or syke by true love as
and they were their gods. I trow that one shall not find but few such
servants. And for that that we be entered in to this matter I shall gy ue the
many ensamples of great love and truth of women borne to their housbandes.
And now we be thanked be god returned to our Cite with a noble company of
worshypfull women that we shall lodge there. And se here this noble lady and
que ne Hypsytrace wife sometime of the rich king Mytrydaces for that yt she
is of old time / and her valor of great dygnyte we shall lodge her first in
the noble palace that is arrayed for her.

Here it speaks of ye queen Hypsytrace. Ca. xiiij.
How might there be any crea ture of gretter love to another than was y^ right
fair / good / and true Hypsytrace to her hus ba^de. And it showed well. She was
wife of the great king Mytrydaces / which governed ye cou^tres of.xxiiij.
languages. And though it so were that this king was mighty and puyssaunt. The
Romans moved right hard war against him / but in all y^ time yt he
labored by great charges in y^ bataylles / where yt ever he went his good
wife left him not / and though that this king after y^ manner of Barbaryne
had diverse concubynes. Nevertheless this noble lady was always embraced in
parfyte love / in such manner yt in no wise she suffered not that he should go
without her / where she was often times in bataylles with him in peril to lose
his royalme and in adventure of his life against y^ Romans. But when he should
go in to a strange regyon or in to a far country / or pass the sea / or
destres / and peryllous forestes / he went never but she was al way his right
true felawe without departing. For she loved him of so parfyte love yt she
thought yt no man should serve her lord so clenly ne so well as she should.
And against that / yt the phylosophre Theofrastus says touching this matter.
This lady for that yt she knew yt often times kings and princes have false
servants / whereof follows false service. She as a true lover to yt entente
yt she might mynystre al necessaryes and conuenable thyn ges to her lord /
though it so be yt she suffered great pain she would always follow* him / and
for so much that to such a deed the habyte of a woman is not conuenable / nor
it is not expedyent that a woman so nyghe a great king / and so noble a
fyghter in battle should be seen to that entente / that a man should seem to
smite of her yelowe here is as gold which to the apparellynge of a woman is a
thyn ge right well semynge. But with yt she spared not y^ fair fresshnesse of
her vysage / but ware her helm / under the which she was often times soylled
and full of ^wetynge and duste / and her fair body and soft used the harneys
and habergyon / hosed with iron / and the precious rings and the rich orname^
tes put a part. Instead of which she bare in her hands / axes / hard
speres / bows and arowes* stretchynge aswerde. And in this manner this noble
queen governed her by strength of great love and true / and thus she changed
the tenderness of her fair body and young / which was wont to be cheryss head
softely / and delycately / and she lived after the manner of a strong armed
knight.

O says Bocaca that writes this story / what is that that love causes not
one to do when she that had it of custom to live so delycately / to lie soft
/ and to have al things at her ease / and now demea ned by her free will as
it were an hard man and a strong lyenge day and night in y^ mountains and
valays / in the deserts / and in forestes / often times upon the bare earth
for dread of enemies in every side of her wild beestes / and serpents. But
all this was sweet to her / to be always nyghe her husband / for to comfort
him / counsel him / and serve him in all his needs. And yet after when she
had suffered to endure long time many hard trauayles. It happened that her
husband was dyscomfyted right cruelly by Pompee prince of the host of the
Romans / so that he was constrained to fle. yet when he was forsaken of al
his own people and left alone / his good wife left him never / but rennynge
after followed him by hills and valays / by forestes / and by many strayte
passages / and he which was forsaken of all his friends / and had no manner of
hope / yet was he comforted by his good wife / which counsaylled him swetely
to have hope of better fortune. And the more that he and she were in great
trybulacyon the more she payned herself to do him solace / and to rejoice him
by the swetnesse of her / to y^ entente to appease his malancoly by goodly
plays that she could find by the which things / and by y^ great sweetness
of her / so much she comforted him / that in every mysery yt he suffered in all
his trybulacyons she ma de him so to forgete it / that he said often times yt
he was not in exyle but him seemed that he was ry ght delycyously in his palace
with his true spouse.

Of the Empress Tryayre. Ca. xv.
RIght like to the foresaid queen in ca se and in true love toward her
husband was the noble Empress Try air wife of Lucyan Urylyan Empe roure of
the Romans. She loved him of so great love / that she followed him in every
place / and in all bataylles armed like a knight always right nyghe him / and
fought right strong ly / whereof it happened on a time that this Emperor had
war with Uaspasyan because of the lordeshyp of the Empire. And when he should
go against a Cite of Uolques and should do by night that he should enter in to
the town he found the people a sleep / and he went upon them cruelly. But
this noble lady Tryayre which all the night had followed her husband and was
not far fro him but always desiring that he might have the vyctory of the
battle always in harnays the sw^rde gyrde about her / fighting right
fyersely in the rowte nyghe her husband / now here / now there by the
darkness of the night having no dread nor fere / but that she bare her so
worshypfully that she had ye price of the battle above al others and did many
meruayles. So it showed well as Bocace says y^ great love y^ she had to her
husban de in proving the band of marriage yt other wol de so much reprove.

Of the queen Archemyse. Ca. xvi.
OF ladies that have loved their husbands of great love and showed it in deed
I may say yet of y^ noble lady Archemyse queen of Carye that as it is said befo
re followed y^ king Mansole her husband in many great batayles till he came to
y^ de the. And she outraged with so great sorrow as much as any creature might
bear / if she showed it well in his life that she loved him well she did no
less in the end. For in making all the solempnytes yt was in y^ usage there
/ as much as might be made for a king with great company of princes and of
barons made brenne the body of her housbande / whereof she herself gadred the
ashes quenchynge them with her teeres / and put them in a vessel of gold. So
she seemed that it was no reason that y^ ashes of him that she had loved so
much should have other scpulture than y^ heart and the body where the rote of
this great love was / and therefore she drank the foresaid ashes / by
succession of time meddled with her drink / by little and little till she had taken
all / yet notwithstanding yt for the remembrance of him she would let make
such a sepulture / which should be always for him a perpetual memory / and to
make it she spared no treasoure / so she made to seek certain work men that
could deuyse and make meruayllous works in building / that is to know /
Scope / Bryaxe / Thymothe / and Leothayre / which were work men of great
excellence / and the queen said to them yt she would have a sepulture made for
the king Mansole her lord / y^ most solemn that king or prince might have
in y^ world. For she would yt by the meruayllous work the name of her
husband should endure always. And they said that they would do it right well.
So the queen made them to seek stones of marble ynowe / and of Jasper of diverse
colors / and all that ever they would ask. The end of the work was such /
that the foresaid work men before the cite of Elycarnase which is the master
Cite of Carye lyfted up a great work of marble stone wrought by entayle right
nobly.

And it was made square / and in every squarenesse it was of.lxiiij. foot. And
on hight an.C. and.xl. fore And yet it was more meruaylous. For all this great
building was set upon.xxx. great pyllers of marble. And each of the.iiij.
work men wrought by strife one with another / whereof y^ work was so
meruaylous that it gave not only remembrance of him that it was made for /
But it was marvel of the subtylnesse of the work men.

The first work man to perform this work yt was called Itrayre made the
highness of the sepulture to be lyfted up by.lx. degrees. And after came the
syxte work man named Pychys the which wrought a charyote of marble / and set
it in the highness of the building. This work was so meruaylous that it was
called one of the.vij. meruayles of the world. And in so much that it was
made for the king Mansolee / the work took his name and was called Mansolee.
And for that / yt it was the most solemn sepulture that ever was made for
king or for prince. All other sepultures of kings and princes have been called
sith mansolees. And thus appeared well in deed and in sign that the true love
dured all the while she lived.

Of Argyne daughter of the king Adrastus. Capitulo.xvij.
O The great love proved that Argyne had / daughter to Adrastus king of Arge
toward her housbande Polymyte. O what is he that dare say yt there is but
little love in a woman to ward her husband / if he consider well this lady.
This Polymyte that was the husband of Ar gyne stryued with his brother
Ethyocles for bycau se of the lordeshyp of the royalme of Thebes. which
perteyued to him by certain couenauntes yt were made between them / but as
Ethyocles wol de not in no manner wise grant him the royalme Polymyte his
brother moved war against him to the help of whom king Adrastus came with all his power / yet fortune turned shrewdely again ste Polymyte which slew his
brother / and his brother him in battle. And the host bode not long on live
but only the king Adrastus and slew ye third part of his people. But when
Argyne kne we that her husband was deed in battle. She departed and all her
ladies with her out of y^ cite of Arge / and forsook her royal see. And of that
that she did Bacace says in this manner. The noble lady Argyne herd say
that the body of Polymyte her husband lay unburied among the bodies and
caraynes of the comune people that there we re slain. Anon she full of sorrow
left the habyte and ^he ornaments / the noblesse and swetnesse of her court
to dwell in her chambres worshypfully arrayed / and with that by great desire /
the brennynge of love surmounted and overcame the feeble nesse and womanly
tendrenesse. And so much she went by her Iourneys / till that she came to yt
pla ce where the battle had been / on the which way she had no fere of the
busshmentes nor of the way tynge of her enemies / ne was never weary of long
nesse of the way. And she came in to the field / dredynge not y^ cruel bestes
ne ye great birds sewynge the deed bodies / ne y^ wicked spyrytes which after
the likeness of diverse fowls flies about deed bodies. And which is a
thing more meruaylous as Bocace says / she doubted not the pre cepte / nor
the commandment of king* Creonce which had commanded and made cry upon
the pain of losing of their heedes that none should vysyte nor bury those
bodies whose so ever they were. For she was not come thither for to obey to
that commandment / but as soon as she was ary ued / which was about y^
night / she left not for no stynkynge yt came out of y^ caraynes / but went
with a great brennynge and a sorrowful courage / and underset the bodies / now
one / now another / seeking for him yt she loved so much / now here / now
there / and thus she seized not till that with the light of a little bronde
offyre that she held in her hand she knew her right entyerly beloved
husband / and so she found that she sought. O said Bocace the meruaylous love
/ the brennynge desy re / and the affection of women. For as the face of her
husband for y^ rustynesse of his harnoys half eten / all full of stynkynge /
all forbledde / full of dust charged with foulness / all pale and black
which was as at that time unable to be known might be hid from this woman
so brennyngly she loved him / thus y^ stynkynge of the body and the foul nesse
of the vysage might not let her / but that she kyssed him / and embraced him
straytely between her arms. Notwithstanding the precepte / and commandment
of king Creonce / she spared not but yt she cried with an high voice. Alas
alas I have found him yt I loved so much / and then she wept with great
plente of teeres. For as she knew by often times kissing his mouth yt there
was no life in him / and had washed him with her teeres al stynkynge / and often
times by great cries / wepynges / and waylynges called upon him fynably as she
saw yt the soul was departed fro y^ body made to light up a great fire so as
it was the manner there of buryenge of kings and of great states / to that en
tente y^ she would do ye last and pyteous office / put hy^ in the fire with many
sorrowful cries of whom she gadred the ashes right derely in a vessel of
gold And when she had done all this / as she yt would ad uenture her body to
the death for to venge her hus band / did so much / and put to such pain
with ye help of other ladies whereof there was great qua^ tyte y^ the walls of
the cite of Thebes were overthrown / and gate the town / and put all to death.

Of the noble lady Egryppyne. Ca. xviij.
WEll ought to be put among these no ble ladies of great love to their
housbandes y^ noble lady Egryppyne dou ghter of Mark Egryppyne and of Iulye
daughter of the Emperor Octauyan lord of all the world. And as this noble
lady was given in marriage to Bermanyce the right noble prince / well manered /
wise / and an encreaser and multeplyer of the comune profit of Rome. Tybere y^
Emperor which was of evil condycyons / took such envy of the welthe that
he herd of Bermanyce husband of the said lady Egryppyne / and of that yt
every man loved him / that he let make watch upon him and ^lewe him / of
whose does his good wife had such sorrow y^ she would in like wise be slain
/ and that seemed right well. For she withdrewe not to say great vy lanyes to
Tybere / For the which he made her to be beten and tourmented cruelly / and
put her in prison. But as she that the sorrow of her housbande might not
forgete / loved better the death than the life / purposed never to ete nor
drink / but this pur pose came to the tyrant Tybere to tourment her longer /
and would constrayne her by tourmentes that she should ete / but it auayled
not. So he wol de by strength make to cast the mete in to y^ stomach. But she
showed well to him that he had puyssaunce to make folk to be slain / but
not to keep them from death if they would. For thus she ended her days.

Here Xp^ine speaks / and right wysnes answers gyuynge ensamples of the
noble lady Iulye daughter of Iulyus Caesar / wife of ye prince Pompee.
Capitulo.xix.
WHen that my lady ryghtwysnes said to me these words. I replied her in such
manner. Madame truly it seem th me to be great honor to the kind of women to
here tell of so many excellent ladies. And amon ge other virtues of them ought
to be right agrea ble to al people / y^ so great love may be in ye heart of a
woman in y^ bond of marriage. Now let them sleep and hold their peace this
Matheolus and all other Ianglers that enuyously and lyengly ha ue spoken
against women. But madame yet me thinks y^ the phylosophre Phylostratus of
who me I have spoken here above says that these women hates their husbands
when they be old / and also yt they love not these conning men y^ be clerks.
For he says that the charges hat one ought to have in dangers of women / and
the studyenge of books ben contrary together. Answer. O dear friend hold thy
peace / I have anon found ye ensamples contrary to their saying / by the
which we shall hold them as no sayenges true. Iulye was in her time the most
noblest of the ladies of Rome daughter of Iulyus Caesar which was sy th
Emperor of Rome and of Coruylle his wife coming down fro Eneas of Troy.
This lady was wife of Pompee ye great conqueroure y^ whi che as Bocace says in
ouercomynge the kings / in putting down / in making again of other in
putting under subieccyon diverse nacyons in destroyenge thieves of the sea /
having the favor of Rome of all the kings in the world / in crettynge the
lordshyppes / not only of y^ lands / but also of y^ see and caves by
meruayllous vyctoryes in sovereign worship was than waxen old and sore bruised.
But not for that the noble lady Iulye his wife which was but young as yet /
loved hy^ of so great love y^ she ended her life by a strange adventure. For
as it happened in a day that Pom pee had devotion to give praysynge to gods
y^ he had gotten by noble vyctoryes and would do sa crefyse after the custom of
that country. And as the beast sacryfyed was upon the awter / and Pomp as by
devotion held him by that one side / his robe was soylled with the blood
yssuynge out of the wound of the beast / wherefore Pomp did of his robe and
sent it home by one of his servants / and for to bring another clean and
fresshe. So it happened by an evil fortune y^ he y^ bare y^ robe met with
Iulye y^ wife of Pomp y^ which when she saw ye robe of her lord so soyled
with blood / then for that yt she knew well yt diverse times it hap ned in
Rome yt to them that were the best / one wol de run upon him for envy and
sle him wherewith she was supprysed suddenly by the sign that she saw of
certain byleuynge yt it had happened so to her husband by some fortune / by
which such sudden sorrow took her at the heart that as she yt would no
longer live / she being great with child fell flat to the earth / pale and
styffe / and the eyes turned in her heed / that there might no remedy be had
so sone to put her out of that dread / but yt she yielded up the spyryte /
which death by reason ought to be great sorrow to the husband. But it was not
only preiudycyable to him nor to y^ Romans / but it was also to all the
world of y^ time. For if she and her sone had lived / y^ great werre had never
ben y^ was sith between Iulyus Caesar and Pomp / y^ which war was
preiudycyable to all the lands of the world.

Of the noble lady Tyerce Emulyene. Ca. xx.
THe fair and good Tyerce Emulyene wife of prince Scypyon y^ first Affrycan
hated not her husband also though he were old. This lady was of great
prudence and right virtuous / and as her husband was old / and she yet fair
and yonge*y^ notwithstanding he lay with a bond woman which was her
servant / and so often it fell y^ this worshypfull lady perceived it. She not
withstanding y^ her heart was sorrowful v^ed ye virtue of her great
understanding / and not only of y^ passion of Ialousye. For she dyssymyled so
wisely y^ her husband ne none other herd her ne uer speak of it. For she
would not tell it to him for that y^ he should seem y^ it were shame to him y^
she should reprove so wise and so great a man as he was and to make mencyon
thereof to o^y other. For y^ shol de be a manner of repreffe and losing of y^
praysynge so wise a man / and against y^ honor of his person / which had
conquered so many royalmes and Empyres. So she never left him this good lady*
to serve him truly / to love him / and worship him. And when he was deed / she
made the maiden fre and wedded her to a free man. And I Xp^ine answered. Then
truly madame to this purpose ye ye say / I have seen often times women in
like case which for any thing yt they knew / would not say though they
knew well that their husbanddes had them but in little love / and yet they
loved them / and made them good chere / and releued them / and comforted them
of whom they had children before. And also I have herd say of a lady of Bry
tayne that lived but late / and was countess of Coemen which was in the
flower of her youth fair above all the ladies. And by her great goodness /
and constaunce she did the same.

Of Uancyppe wife of the phylosopre Socrates. Capitulo.xxj.
VAncyppe the right noble lady a woman of great conning and bounte / so she
had to husband y^ great phylosophre Socrates. And notwithstanding that he was
in great age / and that he had great charge to search and tour ne the books to
pourchace for his wife soft things and curyous / the worshypful woman left
ne uer to love him / but trowed that it was so great a thing the excellent
understanding / and the great virtue of him / and of his constaunce / that she
had him in sovereign love and reverence. And when this woman knew yt her
husband was condemned to ye death by them of Athenes for that yt he blamed
them yt they worshypped the ydolles / and said yt there was not but one god
that ought to be worship ped and served. This noble lady might not have pa
cyence of this thing but fled / her here hangyn ge about her chekes / full
of sorrow / weeping / and betynge at the palace gate where her housbande was /
and there she found him among the false Iuges which had taken to him a
venymous drink to shorten his life / and when it came to y^ point yt Socrates
would put y^ cup to his mou the to drink the venyme / she went to him with
a great wrath and raced the cup out of his han de and threw it all together
on the earth / but Socrates repreued her / and counsayled her to have pacy ence
/ and comforted her. And when she might not let him in no wise fro yt death /
she sorowed strong ly and said. Ha what harm and what loss is it / to make so
Just a man to dye wrongefully and synfully. And Socrates always comforted her /
and said to her / y^ it was better y^ he should dye wrongfully / then
ryghtfully / and so he passed. But the sorrow ended not in the heart of her
that loved him so mo che all her life.

Of Pomp Paulyne / wife of Seneke Capitulo.xxij.
THe right wise phylosophre Seneke notwithstanding yt he was right old / and
al his intent was in studyeng it failed not but y^ he was well byloued of his
wife / fair and young which was named Pompee Paulyne. All the charge yt this
noble lady had was to serve him and keep him in peace / as she yt right truly
and derely loved him / and when she knew yt ye tyrau^t emperor Nero to who^
he had been master had condemned him to dye / to be drowned in a bayne fat /
then as she yt became out of herself sorrow / and as she yt would feign dye
with her husband / went cryenge many vylanyes to the tyrant Nero to the
entente yt he shol de stretche his cruelte upon her also. But all that auayled
her not / so much she sorowed the death of her housbande / yt she lived not
long after. And I Xp^ine said then to the lady yt spoke to me. Certes madame
your words has remembered me / and drawn to mind many other women / fair /
and young / right perfytely loving their husbands / notwithstanding yt they
were right feeble and old And in my time I have seen ynowe yt have loved their
husbands perfytely / and has borne them true love all y^ while they lived /
and namely y^ noble daughter of one of ye great barons of Brytayne yt was given
by marriage to y^ right worshypfull consta ble of France sir Bertram Claquyn /
the which notwithstanding yt he was right lewd of shap of his body and old
/ this noble lady being in the flower of her youth / which took head more to
the great price of his virtue then to the facyon of his body loved him of right
great love / so much yt all her life she had plente of sorrow for his death.
And ynowe of other like I might tell / which that I let pass for
shortuesse of time. Answer of y^ I le ue the right well / and yet I shall tell
the of mo ladies loving their husbands.

Of the noble Sulpyce. Ca. xxiij.
SUlpyce was wife of Lentylyus Co^sulyennole a man of Rome / whom she loved of
so great love as it appeared. For when he should be condemned by the Iuges of
Rome for certay ne things of which he was blamed to be sent wretchedly into
exyle / and there to use his life poor ly. The good lady Sulpyce
notwithstondynge yt she was in Rome of right great richesse / and might abide
in ease and rest loved better to follow her hus band in his pouerte and exyle
/ than abide in habou^ dance of richesse without him. So she renou^ced all her
heritage / goods and country / and did so much yt she stale away fro her
mother and cosynes / which kept her for the same cause yt she should not go
away. And in an unknown wede did so much yt she went to her housbande.
Xp^ine said. Certes madame it seems me by y^ that ye say of some women that I
have seen in my time in like case. For of such I have known of whom the
husbands have become lyppers / and that it were conuenyent yt they were
departed fro the world and put in syke houses. But their good wives evermore
for that y^ they would not leave them loved better to goo with them for to serve
them in their sykenesse / and to hold them the true faith and promise in
marriage tha^ to bide without their housbandes well at ease in their houses. And
I trow I know one that is young / fair / and good / of whom the housbande
is had in suspeccyon of such sykenesse. But as her friends has warned her /
and preched to her to leave his company / and to dwell with them / she answered
that the days of her life she would not leave him. And if they make it to be
proved yt he is ataynte of ye said maladye / by which it is co^uenyent yt he
for sake ye world yt without fail she would go with him. And for that cause
her friends have left it to make a proffe thereof. Also other women I know
that I leave to be named for that yt by adventure I should dysplease them which
yt have housbandes so cursed / and of so an vnordynate life / that y^ fader and
the mother of the woman would yt they were deed And does all that they may for
to withdraw the women to them from their shrewde husbands / but they love
better to be bete^ with many pains and to be in great pouerte / and subieccyon
with their husbands then for to leave them. And they say to their friends / ye
have given me to him / with him shall I live and dye / and these things be
seen all day / but all people consydereth it not.

Here it speaks of diverse ladies that respyted their husbands fro the death.
Ca. xxiiij.
OF many women also in the same wy se as those before said of great love to
their husbands I will tell you yet. It happened after that / yt Jason had been
in Coltos to get the gol den fleece / that some of his knights that he brou
ght with him which were of a country of Greece / that is called Menudye left
their own country and Cite / and went to dwell in another Cite of Greece that
is called Lacedemonye / so they were there gretely received and honored as
much for their ancient noblesse as for their richesse. And there they married
the most noblest maidens of ye Cite. And so much they waxed rich and mounted
in worship that they lyfted up themself in so great pride that they would make
a conspyracyon against the soueraynes of the Cite / and so they did to have the
lordeshyp. So their ymagynacyon was known / wherefore all were put in prison /
and condemned to the death. Of this thing their wives were in great sorrows.
And they assembled them together as for to make their sorrows. So it was
counsayled among them if any way might be found how they might deliver their
husbands. And in the end this was their conclusyon / that in a night they
should array them in lewd gowns / and they should cover their heedes with
mantellesas though they would not be know ne. And in such a wise they went
to the prison / and so much they prayed with weeping and gifts to the kepers
of the prison yt they would suffer them to go se their husbands. And when they
were with their husbands they gave them their lewd gow nes and took those
gowns yt they were clothed in. And sith put them out of the prison / and y^
kepers trowed yt it were the women y^ had turned agay ne. And when it came to
the day yt they should dye the kepers brought them to ye tourment. And when it
was seen yt they were women each of them had great marvel of their wise
cauteyle. So they were gretely praised / and the cytezynes had pity of their
daughters / so there dyed none. And so the se worshypful women delivered their
husbands fro the death.

Here Xp^ine speaks to dame right wysnesayen ste them that says that women
can not keep no counsel. And the answer yt she makes of Porcya.
Capitulo.xxv.
MAdame I know certaynely now and also I have perceived that great is y^ love
/ and the truth that many have had and has to their husbands And therefore I
have great marvel of a language y^ renneth comunely among these men. And
also master John^ de Meun affermeth it so strongly in his romaunce of y^ rose
/ and other auctours also does it / that what a man say the to his wife it
may not be kept pryue / and that women can not hold their peace. Answer.
Dear friend thou ought to know that all women be not wise / and the same it
is of men / by the which if a man have any wit / he ought well to advise him
what wit his wife has / and what good nesse or he say any thing yt he
would have kept close / for thereof might come folly. But when a man knows
that he has a good wife / wise / and dys crete / there is nothing more trusty
in the world nor y^ so much may comfort a man. For dyscrecy on and
secretenesse are too be commended in any person. And yet to ye purpose of
women loving their husbands. There was late a man in Rome right notable named
Brutus which was mary ed to a gentyl woman named Porcya / this noble Porcya
was daughter of Chaton the less which was neuewe to great Chaton. Her
foresaid housbande Brutus felt that his wife was right wy se / secret / and
chaste / told her his entente / that he and Cassyen another noble man of Rome
were in purpose to sle Iulyus Caesar at the counsel / the which thing the
wise lady aduysynge the great evil that might come of it with all her puyssaunce
counsayled him the contrary / and warned him of the myschyefe that might fall
thereof / and might not sleep all the night. Then the morrow comen when that the
foresaid Brutus went out of his chamber to goo to perform his entrepryse.
The lady which would full feign turn his purpose took a rasoure from the
barboure as though she would have pared her nails / and let the rasoure
fall / and after made as though she would have taken it up / and anon she
smote herself in ye hand / wherefore her women that saw her so wounded cried
so pyteously and so strongely yt Brutus turned again. And when he saw her
hurt he blamed her / and said that it was not her office to work with a
rasoure but of ye barboure. And she answered him that she had not done it so
folyly as he thought. For that that she had done was a purpose to assaye how
she might sle herself if y^ entrepryse that he had made should turn him to
evil. But for all that he would not leave but went anon / and between him and
Cassyen they slew Iulyus Caesar. And anon after they were exyled and Brutus
was slain / notwithstanding that he was fled out of Rome. But when Porcya his
good wife knew that he was deed / her sorrow was so great that she forsook the
Joy of her life. And for that yt men took away from her / her kny ues and all
things that she might sle her with. For folks saw well what she would do /
she wen te to the fire and took brennynge coals and burnt her and dyed. And by
this way ended this noble lady Porcya / which was the most straungest de the
that ever any dyed on.

And yet of the same matter / and speaks of the noble lady Curya. Ca. xxvj.
ANd yet I shall tell the to that purpose against them yt say yt women can not
keep no counsel / and always conty nuynge the matter of the great love yt
many women have to their husbands. Curya the noble Romayne was of meruayllous
faith / constaunce / wisdom / and love towar de Quyntus Lucrecyus her
husband. For when her said husband / and other in like wise should be
condemned to the death for a certain crime yt was put upon them / and it
should come to his know ledge yt one sought them to be Iustyfyed. It happened
him so well that they had space to flee. But for the fere that they had to be
found / they went to hyde them in caves of wild beestes / and yet they durst
not abide there. But Lucrecyus / by ye good counsel of his wife parted never
out of his chamber / and when they that sought them came there / she held him
between her arms in her bed / and she hyd him so wisely that they never
perceived him. And after had him so wisely between ye wall les of her chamber /
that never none of her m^ynye perceived it ne knew it. And she could so well
ke pe his counsel by great cautele and wisdom / yt she clothed her in poor
clothes / her here hangyn ge about her chekes / al forwepte / betynge her ha^
des together / went about by the streets and by ye temples and asked all
about after her husband and serched if any person knew where her husband
was become / or to what place he was fled For my desire is to be felawe with
him in his exyle / and in his myseryes. And by this way so wisely she could
feign that never man perceived it / and so she saved him. And with yt she
comforted her housbande full of sorrow. And shortly to say / so much she
did / and so much she purchaced for him that she delivered him not only from
his exyle / but from his death also.

yet of the same purpose. Ca. xxvij.
ANd for that we be in purpose to tell ensamples against them that say that
women can not keep no counsel / truly I might tell ye of ynowe of the^
without nombre. But let it suffyse ye of one that I shall tell the yet. In the
time y^ Nero the tyrant and Emperor reigned in Rome / the re were certain
men that considered that for the right great myscheues and crueltes ye the said
Nero did / that it should be great welthe and profit to ta ke away the life
fro him. So they made conspyra cyon against him / and were aduysed to sle him.
These same men repaired al to ye house of one woman in the which they trusted
so much that they spared not say the deed of their conspyracyon before her.
And as it happened in an evening tide that they were aduysed to put to effect
in y^ mourning their entrepryse they souped with the said woman / and they
kept them not wisely fro speaking / by the which by mysaduenture / there were
so me yt herd them / which for to flatter and to have grace of the Emperor
went and told him what they herd them say / by the which they were not so
soon departed from the said woman but that the sergeauntes of the Emperor
came to ye woman's house / but because that they found not the men there yt
conspyred thus ye death of ye emperor they took the woman and led her before
ye Emperor which inquired gretely of this matter. But he could never do so
much by gyuynge of great gifts / nor by promise / nor by force of tourmentes
/ of which he spared none that he might know of this woman what men they were
/ ne yt she knew any thing of such matters / and thus this woman was
meruayllously proved both secret and constaunte.

Proves against them that say that a man is but lewd that byleueth the
counsel of his wife / or takes any head thereto. Ca. xxviij.
MAdame by these reasons that I under stand of you and by that y^ I se so
much wit and welthe to be in a woman / I mer uayle of that / that diverse men
say / yt these men ben lewd fools yt believe and gives credence to ye
counsel of their wives. Answer. I have said to the before that all women be
not wise. But those yt have wives / good / and wise does great folly when they
believe them not / so as thou may se by that that I have said to the before.
For if Brutus had byleued Porcy a his wife as for sleynge of Iulyus Caesar he
had not be slain himself ne the evil had not happened that fell. And for
that that we be entered in to this purpose. I shall tell the of diverse to whom
it has happened evil in the same wise that they byleued not their wives. And
also I shall tell the after of diverse to whom it has well happened / that
they byleued their wives. if Iulyus Caesar of whom we have spoken / had byleued
y^ right wise and good woman / which by many tokens that she had seen
apperynge / that betokened y^ death of her husband / and the horrible dreme
that she had the night before by the which she counsayled him to turn his
purpose that he should not come at the counsel yt day / if he had not come
there / he had not ben slain. Also in the same wise Pomp that had wedded
Iulye the daughter of Iulyus Caesar as I have said before. And after her he
wedded another noble lady named Cornelya / which to the purpose abouesayd
loved him so much yt for none evil fortune that happened him would not leave
him. And also when he was constrained to fle by the sea after the battle in
which he was dyscom fyted by Iulyus Caesar / the good lady was always with him /
and bare him company in all his perils And when he aryued in the kingdom of
Egypt and that Tholomee the king of that country made semblaunte by treason
that he had Joy of his coming / sent his people before him as though they
should receive him with Joy / and that was for to sle him / the which people
said to him that he should enter in to their ships and that he should leave
his people to that entente yt they might bring their vessels to the port
more lyghtely. But when he would have entered in to their ships his good and
wise wife Cornylle counsayled him y^ contrary that he should not go in to any
nor to put his people away from him. And when she saw yt he would not believe
her / nor do by her counsel / she would have gone in to the ship with him /
but he would not suffer her / and made her to be holden with strength / then
began her sorrow that never failed after all y^ days of her life. For he was
not far from her / but she had always her beholdynge after him / and there
she saw the traitors murder him within the ship. For the which she would
have drowned herself in the sea if she had not ben kept with strength. Also
as it happened myscheuously to Ector of Troy. For as y^ night before yt he was
slain Adromatha his wife had a right meruaylous vysyon / that if Ector went
to the battle in the morrow yt he should dye with out fail / by the which
this lady affrayed of this thing / which was no dreme but a meruaylous
prophecy / prayed him with Joined hands upon her knees before him beryng
between her arms his two fair sons yt as that day he should not co me at the
battle. But he despised her words / thinking that evermore it seemed him yt
it should be reproffe to him / that for the counsel and worcester des of a woman he
should leave to go to ye battle / another for prayer of fader nor mother to whom
she had prayed to require him / would he not leave. whereby it happened him as
it is said before. For he was slain by Achylles / therefore it had been bet ter
yt he had byleued her. Of case infynyte I my ght tell y^ of men to whom it
happened full evil by diverse manners yt they dysdeyned not to believe y^
counsel of their good and wise wives. But if any evil come to them yt
dyspyseth their counsayles / those women ought not to be blamed.

Here it speaks of them yt there is good coming of it that byleueth yt
counsel of their wives / and gives ensample of diverse ladies. Ca. xxix.
OF them to whom it has fortuned well by the byl^uynge of y^ counsel of
their wives / I shall tell ye of some and let it suffyse the for a proffe. So
much I might say that the process should be without end. And let that
avail the which is said before of many that may serve to the same purpose.
The Emperor Iustynyan of whom it is said before had a baron with him that he
held him as a felawe / and loved him as himself / and was called Bellyfere
which was right a worthy knight. So the Emperor had made him master and
gouernoure of his cheualry and made him to sit at his table served as himself
And to say also he showed him many signs of lo ue that the barons had great
envy thereof. In so much that they said to the Emperor / that he en tended
to slay him / and to take the Empire upon him. The Emperor byleued this thing
to sone and to find the way couertely how that he might make him to dye. Then
he commanded that he should go fight against a people that was called y^
Uoendres where as no man might have the better for the great strength that
they were of / when Bellyfere understood this commandment and knew well that
the Emperor charged him not with this thing but if he had be fallen out of
his grace / and benyuolence. So he was so meruayllously sorrowful that he might
not be more. And went home to his house. When his wife which was called
Antonye / and was sister to y^ Empress / saw her husband lie upon his bed
pale and pensyfe / and the eyes full of teeres / she that had great pity of him
demanded him so much that with great pain he told her'the cause of his
sorrow / and when y^ lady understood it then she made se^blaunt to be right
Joyous and comforted him and said Sir have ye none other thing that
dyscomforteth you but this. And yt is to understand that the faith of Ihesu
christ was as yet but right new. And therefore the good lady which was a cry
sten woman began to say / have ye trust in Ihesu christ yt was crucyfyed / and
ye shall have ye higher hand of your enemies with ye help of him. And though
the enuyous would noye you / ye shall do so much by your worthynesse that ye
shall yield them liars of that y^ they say. So believe me well and despise not
my words / and let all your hope be in god / and I promise you that ye shall
over come them. And be well ware y^ ye show no manner semblaunt to have any
dyspleasaunce of this thing / and that no man se you sorry / but right Joyful
/ as he that is well content. And ye shall assem ble your host in the hastyest
wise that ye may / and beware also that no man know at what port ye will
aryue. And also look y^ ye have ships y^owe / and then part your host in to
two parts as soon as ye may secretly with one party entryn ge in to
Auffryke / and anon run upon your ene myes / and I shall have that other
party of your people with me / and we shall aryue by the sea at an haven. And
I tell you that they shall abide to give you battle / and we shall enter in to
that other part in towns and cytees / and we shall put them all to ye death
/ and brenne and destroy all that they find. Bellyfere byleued well this
counsel of his wife / so he did as a wise man. For more ne for less yt she
had said he ordained him on his way / of y^ which it came so well to pass /
yt he overcame his enemies and put them under subieccyon / and took ye king of
Uoendres / and so he had this noble voctory by the counsel and wit of his
worshypfull wife / and then the Emperor loved him better than ever he did
before. Also king Alexan der had not in despyte the words of ye queen his
wife that was daughter of Dayre king of Per se / when the said Alexander felt
that he was em poisoned by his servants / and of the great soro we that he
felt he would go cast himself in a ryuere to end his life the sooner. And ye
good lady yt went against him though she had right great so row took him /
and comforted him / and said to him yt he should turn again / and should
lay him in his bed. And she would speak to his barons / and would make his
ordinance as was perteynynge to such a prince. For it should be a great
losing of his worship if one might say after that ympacyence had overcome
him.. So he byleued his wife / and by her counsel made his ordynaunces.

Here it speaks of the great welthe that is come to the world and every day
comes by the cause of women. Ca. xxx.
MAdame I se infynyte welthes come to ye world by women. And always these men
say that there is none but it comes by them. Answer. Fair friend thou may
se by that that I have said to the long ago that the contrary yt they say is
true. For there is no man that may so me y^ great welthe yt is come to the
world by women / and every day comes I have proved to the by the noble
ladies that has brought to ye worl de scyences and crafts. But if it suffyse
the not yt I have said to y^ of temporal welthes y^ ben come by them. I shall
tell ye of yt spyrytualles. O how is every man so unkind that he forgeteth yt
by women the gate of paradyse was opened to us that is by ye vyrgyne Mary /
what gretter welthe may one desire and that god is made man as I have said to
the before. And who may forgete the great welthes that the moders do to the
children / and women to all men and to all the world. I pray them that they
would not forgete y^ welthes that touches of whens they be spyrytuall. And let
us behold in the old law of Jews if thou will behold the hystory of
Moses to whom god ga ue the law of ye Jews written. Thou shalt fyn de yt by
a woman yt same holy prophet by whom came so many great welthes was respyted
from death as I shall tell the. In the time that the Jews were in y^
thraldom of y^ king of Egypt there should a man be borne of the Ebrues y^
should defend the children of Israel from the bonda ge of them. So it
happened when that Moses yt noble duke was borne of his mother, which durst
not nourysshe him was constrained to put hy in a little basket and put him in
to the ryuere. So it happened as god would that he should be saved / y^
Chermyche the daughter of king Pharao sported her upon the ryuere that time ye
the basket f^o ted upon the water by the which anon she made to take it up
for to save that she had gotten. And when she saw that it was a child / and
so fair that no fayrer might be seen she had a meruaylous great Joy. So she
made it to be nourysshed / and said that it was her child. And for that y^ by
miracle he would not souke no woman of a strange law / she made it to souke
and to be nourysshed by a woman of the Ebrues. This Moses chosen of god when
he was of age / it was he to whom god gave the law and that drew the
children of Israel out of the hondes of the Egyptyens / and passed the reed
see and was duke and conduytoure of ye children of Israel. And thus came so
great welthe to ye Jews by ye cause of this woman yt saved him.

Of Iudyth that noble lady. Ca. xxxj.
THe noble lady and wydowe Iudyth saved the people of Israel from peryss
hynge / in the time that the secon de Nabugodonosor had sent Holophernes duke
of his cheualry upon the Jews after that he had conquered the land of Egypt.
And as the said Holophernes with a great puyssaunce had besyeged the Jews in
a cite / and also he fared so foul with them that they might not abide it
long / and had taken away the co^duytes of water from them / and al their vy
taylles began to fail them. Now ye Jews had no hope to have power against him
/ and they were as upon the point to be taken of him that ma naced them
gretely / wherefore they were in great sorrow. And then they went to their
prayers be, sechynge almighty god that he would have pity of his people / and
to defend them from their ene myes. God herd their prayers / and as he would
save all mankind by a woman / he would save the^ and socoure them by a woman.
In that cite was Iudyth than / the wise woman which was yet but young and
right fair / but yet more chaste / and that was better / she had much pity of
the people that were in such desolacyon and prayed god night and day that he
would socoure them. And so as god enspyred her in whom she had great trust She
aduysed her of great herdynesse and in a night she commended her to god / and
departed out of the cite she and her servant / and went so much till that
she came to the host of Holophernes And when they yt made the watch of ye
host perceived her great beauty by the light of the moon / they led her
anon to Holophernes / which received her with great Joy / for yt she was so
fair and made her to sytte by him / and praised much her wit / and her
beauty. And in the beholdynge of her he was gretely embraced with love and by
great desire he coueted her. But she that thought otherwise prayed god always in
her thought yt he would her help to perform yt she would do / and she led
Holophernes always forth with fair worcester des till yt she saw her time / when it
was come to the third part of ye night Holophernes had given a souper to his
barons and had well dronken and was well chaufed with wine and mete / and might
abide no longer fro bed / and sent for this good la die Iudyth yt she should
come before him. And the^ he told her his will / and that time she said nothyn
ge contrary to his entente. But she said yt she wol pray him yt for ye more
honest he would make voy de his pauylyon of all people / and that he should
goo first to bed / and that she would come to him with out fail about
mydnyght when all men slepte. And thus he accorded. And the good lady put her
to her payers always prayenge god yt he would gy ue hardynes to her womanly
heart and ferefull to de liver his people fro ye fell tyrant / when Iudyth
thought yt Holophernes was on sleep / she came stylly and her maiden with her /
and herkened at ye door of ye pauylyon and understood yt he slepte strongely.
Then said ye lady go we hardely / for god is with us. So she entered in and
without dread took ye swer de yt she saw at his beds head and drew him out
naked and lift him up with all her strength and smo te of ye heed of
Holophernes / without herynge of any body / and put ye heed in her lap / and
as soon as she might she dressed her toward ye cite so much yt without any
lettynge came to the gate and cried come come and open / for god is with us.
And when she was entered in no man knew the way yt was made of this adventure.
And on the morrow she hanged the heed upon a perch above the walls and all
the people of the cite armed them and manfully ran upon their enemies the
which were yet in their beds. For they took no head of them of the cite. And
when they came in to the Pauylyon of their duke to make him arise hastily / and
there they found him deed / and al his people began to sparcle So they slew
and took all yt they might find. And thus was ye people of god delivered fro
y^ hands of Holophernes by Iudyth the worshypfull lady which shall enermore
be praised gretely in holy scripture.

Of the worshypfull queen Hester. Ca. xxxij.
BY the noble and wise lady queen He ster god would also deliver his people
from ye bondage of king Assuere This king Assuere was of great puyssaunce
above al other kings in those days. And posseded many royalmes / and he was a
paynyme and held the Jews in seruage And as the king made to seek in all
royalmes the most noble maidens / the most fair / ye best taught for to
chose one among them al yt might plea se him best to be his wife. And among
all others was brought before him / the noble / good / wise / and fair / and
loved of god / the maiden Hester yt was an Ebrue / which pleased him most
above all others / and so he wedded her / and so much he loved her of great
love that he would not denaye her of nothing that she would require him of. It
happened on a time after / that a false flatterer which was named Naman / and
he exhorted the king against the Jews / that he did so much yt he commanded
all about / where that ever the Jews were found that they sholdde be taken.
And the queen knew nothing of this / for if she had known it / it would have
grieved her evil yt the people should be so evil entreated. Nevertheless an
uncle of hers named Mardocheus which was as chyefe of the Jews made her to
know it / and prayed her that she would remedy it as soon as she might. For
the day was short within the which yt the sentence of the king should be
execu ted. Of this the queen Hester was right sorry / so she clothed and arrayed
her in the most noblest wise that she might / and went with her woman as to
dysporte her in a gardyne where she knew well yt the king was at the
wyndowes. And when at y^ tournynge toward the chamber of the king as though
she thought not on him. And she ^awe y^ king at the wyndowes / anon she fell
down on her knees and saluted him / and the king to whom it pleased her
humylyte / and which had great pleasure to behold her great beauty of the
which she had enough called her and said to her / y^ she should de mau^de
what thing she would and she should have it And ye queen said to him ye she
would none other thing but yt he should come and dyne with her in her chamber
/ and that he should bring with him Naman / and the king granted her. And
when three days were past ye king came and dyned with her. And he had so
agreeable chere yt pleased him well. And then he beheld her countenance / her
worship / her bounte / and beauty / and would not leave her in peace / but that
he should ask some manner great gift. Then she fell down at his feet and in
weeping she began to say / that she would pray him that he would have pity on
the people of the Jews and that he would not put them to so great myschyefe
sith yt he had put her in so great worship. For it was great pity to se her
lygnage and them of her nacyon so vylanously to be destroyed And then the king
all wroth answered her and said. Mine own lady what is he that durst do it.
She answered / sir Naman your provost make th it to be done / which is here
present. And to say it shortly / the king called again his sentence and
Naman was hanged which had caused all ye to be done. And Mardocheus uncle to
y^ queen was put in his place / the Jews fraunchysed and made most priuyleged
of any other people and most had in worship. And so in the same wise that
god would by Iudyth he did by this noble queen He ster that his people were
saved. And believe it not yt these two ladies were alone in y^ holy scripture by
who^ god would save his people diverse times For there benynowe of others which
I leave for shortness of time as of Delborra of whom I have spoken above / which
delivered the people fro bondage.

Of the ladies of Sabyne. Ca. xxxiij.
OF ladies of ancient law of paynymes / also I may tell the of many whi the
in the same wise were cause of saving of countres / cytees / and towns But I
shall pass over except two en samples right notable without mo / for all
proves of them. when Remus and Romulus had founded the cite of Rome / and
Romulus had peopled the cite / and fulfilled it of knights and men of arms
that he had chosen and assembled after die uers vyctoryes that he had / Romulus
wo^de fay ne purchase that they might have wives to y^ entente that they might
have issue yt might posses the cite and the lordeshyp. But he wyste not well
how he might do yt he and his felawshyp might have wives / and that they were
married / for the kings and the princes / and the people of y^ coun tree desired
not greatly to have affynyte with them for that it seemed them yt they were
fyerse people / and diverse / and so they would not give them their daughters in
marriage. And therefore Romulus aduy sed of a great cautele made to cry a
^ourney and a Ioustes by all the countres / and that it pleased the kings and
princes and lords and all other peo ple should bring adyes and damoyselles to
^e y^ dysporte of the strange knights. The day of y^ feast was come / and
great was the assemble what of one side / what of that other. And thither came
great foyson of ladies and of maidens to behold the play. And among all
others the king of Sabyne had brought with him a fair mayden^ which was his
daughter with all the ladies and gentylwomen of that country that followed her.
Thus were the Ioustes ordained without the cy te in a fair plain beside an
hylle. And the ladies were al set by row on hye upon y^ hylle. There the
knights enforced them one against another to make dysporte. For y^ fair
ladies that they saw increased their hertes in strength and hardynesse to
make knights. And to make the ta^e short when they had run together enough
/ and Romulus seemed that it was time to do that they had ordained. He took a
great horn of an Holofaunt and began to blow right high. That blow ynge and
that token they intended well / and ano ne left the play / and all they ran
toward the ladies / and Romulus took the kings daughter for he was gretely
smyten with love / and all that others in the same wise took each of them one /
and anon they set them on their horses and fled toward ye cite. And they
shytte y^ gates right well and surely. There was a great cry and great soro we
of the faders and moders that their daughters were so taken away with strength,
But their weeping auayled them not. Romulus made a great feast and wedded his
lady / and so did all y^ others. Of this sprange great war. For as soon as
ye king of Sabyne might / he came with a great host upon y^ Romans / but it
was no light thing to over co me them nor to dyscomfyte them / for they were
ry ght manly men. The war endured between the^ v. years / and on a day when
both hosts should mete together and this thing was gretely sorowed of the
ladies of y^ cite yt there should be so great man slaughter. And when this
Romulus was issued out of y^ cite with a great host. The queen assembled to a
parlyament al y^ ladies of the cite in to a temple / and then she which was
right wise / good and fair / began thus to say / worshypfull ladies of Sabyne
/ my right dear systers and felawes / ye kno we y^ rauysshynge yt was done on
us by our housba^des / for y^ which cause our faders and friends ha th moved
war to our husbands and our husbands against the^. So we may not in our
part in no manner determyne this mortal wars / nor to be mayntened who yt
ever wyn y^ vyctory / but it must be great p^iudyce to us / for if our
husbands be over come it ought to be to us yt love them as reason is and y^ we
have children by them / right great sorrow and desolacyon / and that our little
children should be or phelynes / that is to say without faders. And if it
happen that our husbands have the vyctory and yt our faders and friends be
deed and destroyed / certes we ought to have great pity y^ for us there should
such myschyefe happen / and that y^ is done may be none other wise. And
therefore me seems it should be great welthe if y^ any counsel might be
found by us that peace were set in this war. And if it please you to follow
me / and do as I shall do I trow we shall come well to our entente. And all the
ladies answered to the words of the queen and said that she should command
and they would obey. And then the queen went with her here about her chekes
/ and bare foot / and all ye others did in the same wise. And those that had
children bare them between their arms and led them with them / and there was
great foyson of children and of women with child. The queen put herself
before in this pyteous processyon and so they came to the field right there as
the battle should be the same hour y^ they began to assemble. And she went
to put herself between both hoostes with all the company of ladies and gentyl
women so that they might not assemble. For y^ queen and all the other ladies
kneled between them cryenge with an high voice. Faders and friends / right
dear lords / entyerly byloued housbandes / for gods sake make peace / or
else sle us here / and let us no longer live / when the housbandes saw their
wives and their children between their ar mes It is no doubt yt they were
gretely abashed and dysmayde / and the same wise to the faders to se their
daughters it filled their hertesful of pity by which they looked one upon
another and beheld the pity of the ladies which prayed them so mekely / y^
which caused both parties to turn all their wrath and malice in to
amourous pity as of the sons to the fader / so much that they were
constrained to cast of their harneys on both par ties / and to embrace each
other / and to make a fynall peace. Romulus led the king of Sabyne his fader
in to the cite and gretely worshypped him and all the company. And thus by the
wosdome and virtue of this queen and of the other ladies were the Romans and
Sabynes saved that they be not destroyed.

Of Uetury the noble lady of Rome. Ca. xxxiiij.
VEtury was a noble lady of Rome / mother of the right worshypful To main named
Marcyan a man of virtue and counsel / subtle / and ready / wise and hardy.
This worship full knight sone of Uetury was sen te by the Romans with a great
host against the Coryens / of whom he had the vyctory / and took the fortress
of Uolques / for the which vyctory y^ he had upon the Coryens / he was named
Coryolus. Of this thing this man was so gretely worshypped that he had all the
governance of Rome But as that was a thing right dangerous to govern the
people every man after his entente*

At the last y^ Romans were wroth against him and condemned him to be exyled
/ and was banysshed out of Rome. But of that he could right well revenge him.
For he went toward the Coryens that he had dyscomfyted before / and made them
to rebelle against the Romans / and they made him their capytayne / and with a
great puyssau^ce came upon the cite of Rome / and did them much harm where
so ever they went. The Romans doubted this matter gretely / and for y^ peril
which they saw themself in / they sent messages to them to treat for the
peace. But Marcyen dysdey ned not to here them / and as often as they sent it
auayled them not but evermore did them much harm. So they sent to him y^
bysshoppes / and the priests all reuested in vestymentes praynge him right
humbly for y^ peace / but it auayled not. And then the Romans wist not what to
do / but they sent ladies of the cite to the noble lady Ueturye mother of
Marcyen to pray her that she would ta ke the pain to treat for the peace unto
her sone. Then this good lady Uetury departed out of the cite and with her the
noblest ladies of the town / and in this processyon she went to her sone /
the which sone as a good knight as soon as he knew y^ coming of his mother
descended from his horse and went on foot to mete her / and received her right
humbly as a sone ought to do his mother. And the^ as she began to pray him for
the peace he answered that it perteyned to the mother to command the soue and
not to pray. And thus this noble lady led him again to Rome. And by her
were ye Romans as that time kept from dystruccyon and thus she did alone /
that all ye high legates of Rome might not do.

Of the queen of France Crotylde. Ca. xxxv.
OF great welthes that be come by women to behold the spyrytualte as I have
said to y^ before. Crotylde daughter of the king of Burgoyne wy fe of the
strong Clodonne king of France / was it not she by whom y^ faith of The su
christ was first brought and spredde to the kings and princes of France /
where might there be a better thing done than that was y^ she did For as she
was made light with the faith of our lord. And she was a good lady and an
holy. She never seized to comune with her husband and pray him that he would
receive the faith / and be baptized / but he would not accord to her / always
this lady seized not to pray unto god in weeping and fasting that he would
enlumyne the heart of the king / in so much yt at the last our lord had pity
of her afflyc^yon / and enspyred y^ king in such manner y^ as he was ones
gone to do a batayl against y^ king of Almaunce and the dyscomfyture of ye
battle came upon him. And then y^ king Clodon so as god would enspyre him
lyfted up his eyes toward heaven and by great affection said these words.
Almighty god which that ye queen my wife byleueth and worshyppeth let thine
infynyte grace shine on me this day to help me in this battle. And I promise
the yt I shall receive thine holy faith / he had no sooner said these words
but that the deed of the battle turned to him and had the plain vyctory.
Then he yielded thankynges to our lord and returned home with great comfort
and Joy / and received baptyme with the queen and all his barons / and after
all the people. And from that hour unto this day our lord has stretched his
grace so plenteously on us y^ the faith failed never sith in France / and
all by the prayers of this good lady and holy queen / ne there was never king
heretyke worshypped by god as there has been of diverse other kings and
Emperoures / the which thing is gretely to be praised in them. And therefore
they be called very christian people. If I would tell the all yt great welthes
that comes by women the writing should be to great. But yet upon the act
that touches y^ spyrytualte / how many holy martyrs have there ben comforted
/ harbored / and refresshed by women / wives / and wydowes. If thou will read
thou shalt find that it pleased god that all for ye most part in their
aduersytees and martyrdomes were comforted by women / not only the martyrs
but also the appostles saint Poule and other / and in the same wise Ihesu christ
was refresshed and comforted by women. And y^ frenss he men that have in so
great devotion the body of saint Denis a good cause why / for he brought first
the faith in to France / have not they that blessed body / and ye bodies also
of his blessed felawes saint Rust^ke and saint Elenthere thrughe the help of a
woman. For the tyrant that made them to be heeded ordained that the bodies
should be cast in to the river of Said / and they that should have done it put
the bodies in a sack to bear it thither. and they were harbored with a good
woman a wedowe which was named Catule / the which opened the sack and took
out ye holy bodies and put in to the sack deed hogs. And buried these holy
martyrs as worshypfully as she could in her own house. And set writing over
them to ye entente that in time to come they should be known And long time
after also by a woman there was made first a chapel in the honor of them.
That was by my lady saint Geuenyene till unto that time that the good king of
France Dangobert founded the church that is now there.

Here it speaks against them yt say yt is not good that women should learn
letters. Ca. xxxvi.
AFter these things before said. I Xp^ine said thus. Madame I se well that
many great welthes comes by women And if any evil have followed by any evil
women / nevertheless it seems me that there ben many mo welthes come by good
women / and in the same wise by wise women / and by them that have learned
scyences / of whom there is mencyon made before / by the which I marvel
gretely of the opinion of some men that say / that they would not in no wise
that their daughters or wives or kynneswomen should learn scyences and that it
should apayre their co^dycyo^s. Answer. Thou may se well by that that all the
opynyons of men be not founded upon reason / and yt they have wrong. For it
ought not to be presumed that of knowing the science moral and they that learn
virtue the condycyons of them ought not to be enpayred by that / but it is no
doubt yt they nobled thereby and amended / how is it thought that he that
lerneth a good lesson of doctrine should enpayre. This thing is not to say ne
to sustain / I say not that it is good that a man or a woman should study in
scyences of sorcery / or of such as ben forbidden. For it is not for naught
that the church has put them out of the comune usage / but that ye women
apayreth with conning it is not well to believe. Quintus Ortencyus was not of
the same opinion yt was a great rethorycyen in Rome and a so uerayne endytoure.
The same man had a daughter named Hortence whom he loved much for y^
subtylnesse of her wit / and made her to learn let tres / and to study in the
foresaid science of retho^yke / whereof she learned so much that not only as
Boca^e says she resembled her fader by wit and good remembrance and in all
facultes / but also of well pronounsynge / and of all order of speaking so well
that he passed her in nothing. And to the purpose of that yt is said above of
welthe yt comes by women. The welthe yt comes by this woman and by her
conning was among other that in y^ time that Rome was governed by three men /
this woman Hortence took upon her to sustain the causes of women and to
demean that that a man durst not take on hand / that was of certain charges
that one would put upon them and on their araymentes in ye time of necessytes
of Rome. And the cloquence of this woman was so fair that she was herd with
no less will tha^ her fader was / and gate her cause. In the same wise to
speak of more new time without lokynge after old hystoryes. Iohsi Andry a
solemn legyster of Boloynela Grace / was not of the same opinion that it was
evil that women were lettered / as to this fair daughter / and good / that he
loved so much which was named Nouuelle ma de her to learn letters / and she
had the laws y^ when he was occupied in any business by ye which he might
not entende to read ye lessons of his scolers he sent Nouuelle his daughter in
his place to read to y^ scolers in y^ thayre / and to y^ entente yt her beauty
should not hurre y^ thought of them y^ she taught she had a little curtyne
before her * and by such manner she fullylled y^ occupa^yons of her fader who^
he loved so much / that for to put y^ name of her in remembrance made a
notable letter of a book of law that he called it after the name of his dough
ter Nouuelle. So there be not many men that be wise of the opinion above said.
Thy fader yt was a natural phylosophre had not that opynyo that women should
not learn letters / but in so mo che that he saw she enclyned to learning as
thou know well he had great pleasure of it. And by ye blame of thy mother
which by the comune opyny on of women thou were tarried in thy youth to enter
more in the depnesse of scyences. But as the proverb say the / that nature
gives may not be taken away. So it may not hurt the feeling of conning
that thou have gadred together the little drops of the which I trow that thou
wenest be not of lyt^ll valor / but thou hold them in great treasoure and
without fail thou haste cau se. And I Xp^ine answered. Madame that you say is
as true as the Pater noster.

Here Xp^ine to ryghtwysnesse and she answers against them yt sa^e there be
but few women chaste / and tells of Susanne. Ca. xxxvij.
MAdame to that yt I se that these great welthes and all virtues may be found
in women. And whens comes it yt these men say that there be but few women
chaste. And if it be so / al other virtues should be as naught in so much y^
chastyte should be the most sovereign virtue in a woman. But by y^ I have
herd you say it is all other wise. Answer. By that that I have said to y^
truly and that thou know is open enough ye contrary. And yet I think to
say and always shall O of how many worshypful ladies chaste speaks holy
scripture / which rather chase the death than to break their chastyte / and
clennesse of body and of thought / so as the fair and goo Susanne the wife of
Ioachym that was a man of y^ lygnage of Jews rich and of great auctoryte. And
as upon a time this good lady sported her alone in a gardyne / there entered to
her two false old prestes and required her to sin with them / and she always
denied them. By which when they saw y^ their prayer auayled not they manased
her to accuse her to the Justice / and to put on her that she was found with a
young man. And when she herd their manales / for y^ custom was there that
women found in such case were stoned to the death she said than enuyronned
with anguysshe in every part. If I do not that these men require me I shall
have corporal death. And if I do it I offend before the face of my creatoure.
But not for that it is better to be innocent and suffer corporal death then
fall by sin in to the wrath of my lord god And then cried Susanne and the
people that were within came anon / and to say shortly so much witness these
false priests made that Susanne was condemned to the death. But god which
provided always for his friends opened the mou the of y^ profit Danyel which
was a young chyl de between the arms of his mother y^ which when they led
Susanne to the Judgment with great multitude of people y^ went weeping after
her / cried and said yt the innocent Susanne was Iuged by great wrong. So she
was led home again and the false priests better examyned were foun de by
their confession culpable. And the innocent Susanne was delivered and they were
Iuged to the death.

Of Sarra the wife of Abraham. Ca. xxxviij.
OF the chastyte and goodness of Sarra speaks the bible about the.xx.
chapter of Genesis. This woman was wife of Abraham y^ great Patryarke Much
good thing is there said of her in holy scripture which that I leave to tell
the for shortness. But of her chastyte may one say to the purpose that we
spoke of before that there ben fair women ynowe that be chaste. For she was of
so sovereign beauty that in her time she passed all other women / so much that
many princes co ueted her / but she was so true that she dysdeyned not to here
them. whereof among all the others that coueyted her was the king Pharao / in
so much that he took her away by strength from her husband. But the great
goodness of her whi che yet passed her beauty desired of god that she lo ued
so tenderly that he would keep her from all manner of vylanyes. And almighty
god herynge her petycyon tourmented so much Pharao and his people both of
body and of heart by grievous sykenesses and diverse vysytacyons / that he
touched her never / and so was he constrained to yield her again.

Of Rebecca. Capitulo.xxxix.
REbecca the wife of Isaac the Patry arc fader of Jacob / was not much less
to praise than the fair and good Sarra. This Rebecca is meruayllously praised
in holy scripture of die uers things. And it is written of her in the.xxiiij.
chapter of the first book of ye bible / that she was so good / wise / and
honest / that she was ensample of chastyte unto all women that knew her. And
with that she bare her meruayllously mekely toward her housbande / and so
symply that she seemed not that she was a lady / and therefore y^ good man Isaac
worshypped her / and loved her meruayllously well. But this good woman Rebec ca
had of almighty god a better gift than the love of her housbande for her
great chastyte and goodness. For this noble lady that was so mo che in the
love and in the grace of our lord Ihesu she had it so gretely yt
notwithstanding she was old and ^arayne god gave her two children in one
womb which was Jacob and Esau / of whom came the lygnages of Israel.

Of the noble woman Ruth. Ca. xl.
OF good ladies and chaste I might tell the / of which holy scripture makes
mencyon which I leave for shorten^s Ruth was a noble lady and a good which
dessended of ye lygnage of Dauyd the prophet. She was right chaste / and in
likewise in her wydowhode of right great love to her husband as it appeared.
For the great love that she had to him when he was deed she forsook her ow ne
country / and nacyon / and went to dwell and use her life with the Jews of
the which lygnage her husband came / and dwelled with his own mother. And to
say shortly this noble lady was so good and chaste that there was a book made
of her / and of her life / in the which these things be fore said be written.

Of Penolope wife of Ulyxes. Ca. xlj.
OF chaste ladies paynymes there be found ynowe right good and worshypfull in
diverse chronicles Penolope the wife of prince Ulyxes was rygh a virtuous lady /
and among other virtues yt she had she was gretely praised for her chastyte /
and many diverse hystoryes makes mencyon of her. For this lady all the while ye
her husband was at the syege before Trope yt endured.x. years / she governed
her right wisely. And not withstanding yt she was required of many kings and
princes for because yt she was so fair / she would not harken to them nor here
them speak. And she was wy se and prudent / and devout to her gods / and of
fair and good behauynge. And also after ye dystruccyon of Troy she abode her
said husband other.x. years and men supposed that he was perysshed in the sea.
where there were many pestylences. And when he was come home he found her
besyeged with a king ye would have had her by strength in ma ryage. For her
great beauty and chastyte / her husband came in the guyse of a Pilgrim and
inquired of her / and when he herd good tidings of her / he was right Joyous.
And he had great Joy of his young sone Thelomachus which he left with her
right little / and he found him then parfytely grown. And I Xp^ine said thus.
Madame by y^ that I have herd you say / these foresaid ladies left not to be
chaste though they were fair. For many men say that of great pain there be
found any fair women chaste. Answer. Those yt so say fails. For there be
/ has been / and shall be fair women chaste.

Here it speaks against them that say that it is a pain for to find any
fair woman chaste. Capitulo.xlij.
MAryamyre was a woman of Ebrue daughter of king Arystobolus / she was of so
great beauty that not only in that time men wend that she had passed and
exceded all other women in beauty / but they Iuged her that she was rather a
celestyall image and godly / than a mortal woman / and ye figure of her was
painted in a table and sent to king Anthony of Egypt y^ whi che for the
great marvel of such beauty said / and Iuged that she was daughter of
Iupyter the god For he would not believe that she might be engen dred by a
mortal man. This lady notwithstanding her excellent beauty and yt she was
tempted and assayed to be had of diverse great princes / and kings.
Nevertheless by great virtue and strength of courage she re^ysted all / and
for yt she was the more praised and more shynynge in renown. And yet she was
more to praise / in so much that she was wedded right evil / that is to know
/ to Herod Anthy pater king of Jews which was a man of great cruelte / and
also he had made to be slain the brother of this good lady / for the which
cause and many others that he did to her she had him in hate. But for all that
she left never to be a good woman and chaste. And yet with this it came to the
knowledge of this lady that he had ordained that if he dyed before her / that
she should he slain anon after to the entente that none other should have the
possessyon of so great beauty after him.

Also the same purpose of Anthony wife of Dru se Tybere brother of the noble
Emperor Nero. Capitulo..xliij.
FOr that that one says comunely yt it is as strong a thing yt a fair woman
may keep her among young men and courtyours desirous of love without taking
/ as it is to be amon ge the flambes of fire without brennynge / well she could
defend her the fair and good Anthonye wife of Druse Thybere brother of Nero
the Emperor. This lady dwelled in the flower of her so uerayne beauty and
grene youth wedowe of Druse Thybere her husband which his brother Nero had
slain with poison / whereof this noble lady had so great sorrow that she
purposed never after to be married / but to live in chastyte / y^ which pur
pose she held as long as she lived so holy yt there was never paynyme lady
that had gretter praysynge of chastyte. So she did of this thing so much
more to be praised as Bocace says that in this chastyte and contynuence she
was abiding among in the court among ye young lusty people / fresshe and
Ioly lovers living courtely. There she used her life without spotte of any
blame / or of any manner of lyghtnesse / the which thing as the auctoure
says is worthy too be lyfted up in praylynge / so as of a young woman right
excellent in beauty which was the daughter of Mark Anthonye that led his
life full synfully. But not for that the lewd ensamples that she saw / made
her never to fall / but that she abode always in chastyte among the brennynge
tyres / and it was no little while / but that she was perseueraunt till that
she dyed for age. Of such that were fair and chaste living among the
worldely people / and also in court among the young lusty folks / of
ensamples I might find the ynowe and at this day also / nor doubt the not
but there ben many though that the evil tongues lysteth for too say
shrewdely. And of such good and chaste ladies ledynge their lives among these
worldely people speaks Ualery of this noble and worthy lady Sulpyce / the
which was of great beauty / and yet she was named the most chaste among all
the ladies of Rome.

Here it speaks against them that says that women would be rauysshed / and
gives ensamples of diverse / and first it speaks of the noble and worthy lady
Lucresse. wife of Tarquyne Collatyn. Capitulo.xliiij.
THen I Xp^ine said thus. Madame I believe it well that ye say / and I am sure
that there ben ynowe fair women chaste / and that can keep them from the
awayte of the deceyuours / yet it greueth me of that that many men say that
women would be rauysshed / and that it dysplease th them not though they say
the contrary with their mouth. But it were a great thing to make me to believe
it that it were agreeable to them. Answer. Doubt it not fair friend / that
it is no pleasaunce to these chaste ladies of heart and thought to be
rauysshed / but it is to them right great sorrow above all other / and that it
be true there be many of them that have showed it by fair ensamples. As of
Lucres the right noble woman of Rome / sovereign in chastyte among all yt
ladies of Rome wife of the noble Tarquyne Col latin / and as Tarquyne the
proud sone of the kyn ge was taken with the love of this lady Lucres / and
durst not tell it her / for the great chastyte that she was of / but dyspayred
to come thereto by gifts or prayer. So he thought to come to it by cautele / he
said yt he was well byloued with her husband by y^ which he entered in to her
house when it pleased him / by the which as in a time he wol de go thither when
he knew verily that her housbande was not at home / and she received him ry
ght worshypfully as hy^ which she thought was a right good friend to her
housbande. But Tarquyne which thought all otherwise did so much that he
entered at night in to her chamber / of y^ which she was gretely aferde. And to
say shortly when he had spoken enough by great promyses / gifts / and offres
that he might do his will with her / and saw that all auayled not / he took
his sword and manaced her to ^lee her if she spoke one word / but that she
should consent to his will / and she answered that he should ^le her hardely
for she loved more to dye than to consent. Tarquyne yt saw that nothing
auayled him / aduysed him of another great malice / and said that he would tell
it openly yt he had found her with one of her servants / and to say shortly
she was so gretely aferde of this thing thinking yt folks would soon believe
such a thing by the words of him she suffered his strength. But yet might
not Lucresse bear pacyentely this great dyspleasure / wherefore when it was day
she sent to seek her husband / and her fader and kynnesfolke which were y^
grettest of Rome / and when they were come to her she told them with great
wepynges and waylynges that which was done to her. And as her housbande and
kynnes folks saw her in so great sorrow recomforted her / she drew a knyfe
that she had under her gown saying / though it be so that I clear me of this
sin / and I show mine Innocence / nevertheless I deliver me not from
tourment / nor I put me out of pain / ne fro hens forth there shall never
woman live shamed by the ensample of Lucresse. And these things said / by
great strength she fyxed y^ knyfe in to her breast / and fell down dyenge in
y^ sight of her husband and friends. So they ran al as they had been out of
themself upon this Tarquyne / and for this cause all Rome was moved / and
chased the king out of the town and they would have slain his sone if they
might have fouude him. And never sith there was no king in Rome because of
this great outrage done to Lucres / and as some say for because of her there
was a law made that if any man that rauysshed a woman should dye the which
law is conuenable and Just.

Of the same purpose of ye queen of Gausegres. Capitulo.xlv.
WEll to the purpose above said the hystory makes mencyon of ye noble que ne
and wife of Orgyagontes king of Gausegres. It happened in the time when the
Romans made their great conquestes upon strangers y^ this said king was
taken by the said Romans in a battle and his wife with him / and when they
were at their lodgyn ge y^ noble queen which was right fair / simple and
chaste pleased gretely one of yt constables of the said host of Rome which
had taken the king and her. So he prayed and required her by great offres /
but when he saw that prayers auayled him not / he left of and spoke no more.
Then this noble lady had great sorrow for the wrong that this con stable did
to her / and she left not to think how she might be revenged. So she ^aryed
and dyssyinyled till she saw her time / and when she saw that the ransom
was brought for to deliver her hus band and her / the lady would y^ this money
should be paid to y^ said constable she being present To whom she said that
she would that he should way the gold to the entente that he should have no
wrong / and that he were not deceived. And when she saw that he intended to
way the gold and that there was noae of his people about him. The lady took a
knyfe and smote him in the throat and slew him / and smote of his head and
without any trouble brought it to her husband and told him ho we she had done
/ and how she had revenged her wrong.

yet of the same / and of ye ladies of Sycambres and other maidens. Ca. xlvj.
ALso though I may give the ensam ples of married women of whom I might tell
the enough of whom the sorrow to be rauysshed was importa ble / I shall tell
the of wydowes and maidens. Sysponne was a woman of Greece / and she was taken
and rauysshed with maryners and scommers of y^ see / which were enemies to
that country / the which lady as she that was of great beauty was required by
them right gretely. And when she saw that she might not escape / but to be
rauysshed she had this thing in so great abho mynacyon and dyspleasannce that
she had lever to dye. And therefore she lepte in to y^ see / and was drowned.
Also the Sycambres which now ben called Frensshme^ assailed on a time among
other the cite of Rome with a great host and a mul tytude of people. And in
hope that they should have destroyed the cite they brought their wives with them
and their children. And it happened that y^ dyscomfyture turned upon y^
Sycambres / when their wives saw that / they counsayled among them yt it was
better to dye in defending their chastyte. For they knew yt after y^ usage of
war they should be rauysshed than to be deedly dishonored. So they made
fortresses about them with their charyottes and carts and armed them against y^
Romans / and they defended them as much as they might and slew many of them
/ but at y^ last they were siayne y^ most part of them. And those that were
left on live prayed with Joined hands that they would not touch them in no
vy lany / and that they might use the end of their lives in serving in the
temple of maidens of the goddess Uesta. But for that that it was not grau^ ted
to them they would sle them rather than to be rauysshed. Also of maidens in
like wise so as of Uyrgyne the noble maid of Rome which the false Judge
Claudyen trowed to have by cautele and by force / and when he saw y^ prayer
auayled him not / but she notwithstanding her grene youth had lever to dye
than to be rauysshed. Also there was a cite taken in Lombardy by the enemies
which that slew the lord. The daughters of y^ said lord which were right
fair in so much y^ they thought they should be sold to be rauysshed / they
pourneyed them of a strange remedy / for ye which they were gretely to
praise. For they took the flesh of chekyns raw and put it in their bosoms /
so it was anon corrupt by hete / whereof it happened that when they yt would
rauysshe them came nyghe to them and they felt y^ stynke anon they left them
saying. O gods how these lom bardes stynke. But that stynkynge made them to
smell right sweet.

Proves against that yt one speaks of y^ inconstaunce of women. Xp^ine speaks
and ryghtwysnes answers of y^ inconstaunce and fragylyte of diverse
Emperoures. Ca. xlvij.
MAdame ye tell me meruayllous constaunce / stablenesse and virtue of y^ great
courage of women / what might one say more of the most stron gest men that
ever were / yet above all vices that men and also the books say to be of women
cries all of one voice upon them / yt they be varyable / Inconstaunte /
chaungeable / light / and of frail courage / bowynge as children. Are these
men then so constaunnte that they may not vary and it is a great thing to do
that so much accuses women of inconstaunce. Certes if they do to much it is
right lewd and evil semynge to ask of another a virtue that they can not have
themself. Answer. Fair sweet love haste not thou always herd say that a
fool perceyueth better the little mote in ye face of his neighbor then he
beholds the great beme yt hangs over his own eye. So I shall show the
great contradyccyon in that that these men say so much of the varyaunce of
women. They accord all generally that women by nature be right frail / and
yet these men desire that women should be of grtter constaunce then they can be
themself. For those that so calls themself to be so strong and of so noble
condy cyon / yet they may not hold them from falling in to many right great
defautes and sins / and know well that they mysse take / and they labor so
moch^ to the women that if any of them fall in any defaute of which they are
the cause / and by their cautayles they have drawn them thereto by great pain
and labor / yet ^yth they name them so frail they ought in some wise for to
supporte their fragylyte / and not to call a little fault a gre te crime / yet
they list not to supporte them but ma keth and says many great gryefes of
them / And they denaye not to call them strong / and constaunte when they
endure their great outrages. And thus at all purposes these men would ha ue the
right from them. And of yt thou have spoken enough in thy pystle of the god of
love. But to yt thou demaundest me if these men be so strong and so constaunte
that they have cause to blame other of their constaunce. If thou behold sith
y^ ages and ancient time unto this day by the books and by that thou haste
seen in thine age / and at all times theu may se it before thine eyes / not
only in simple men / nor of low estate / but of y^ grettest thou may know
y^ perfeccyon of their constaun ce / I will not say absolutely that it is with
them so generally as they say of women but as it has been / and is in some of
them. And for that that if there be in the courage of men no inconstaunce but
accuse the women of y^ vice. Take heed now here / and I shall give the
ensamples of y^ grettest princes and most lyfted up in estate / which is a
thing not perteynynge to y^ same vice more tha^ in others without seeking in
more au^cyent ages where was there ever courage of women so frail / nor so
evil accustomed and less constaunt then was the Emperor Claudyen. He was so
varyable y^ what so ever he ordained in one hour he despised it in another /
and there was never sta blenes found in his word / he accorded to all cou^
sail. He caused his wife to be slain by his cruel te / and after at night he,
asked wherefore she came not to bed / and commanded his servants y^ he had
made smite of their heedes to come and play with him. This Emperor was of so
caytyfe a courage that he trembled always / nor he trusted no body / I can not
tell the all the shrewdenesse of the condycyons of this lewd Emperor / but
y^ he was full of fragylyte. Tybere y^ Emperor what was he more wroth / all
in constaunce / all varyaunce / all slyppernesse was mor en him tha^ ever was

Of Nero the cruel Emperor. Ca. xlviij.
ANd Nero that was he / sith we be entered in the deeds of Emperoures. Of this
Nero the great varyablenesse ap pered. For at y^ beginning he was good enough
and did his pain to please all people. But after he had no refrain of his
lechery / of his rauyne / nor of his cruelte / and to exercise it the more /
often times he armed him by night and went with his glotons and his felawes to
unthrifty places playenge and Iapynge by the streets / doing all shrewdenes /
and to find occasyon to do shrewdely / he shouldred them y^ he met / and if
they spoke any word / other he would wound them or sle them. He brake
tauernes and doors of lewd houses / he took women by streng the / whereby he
was almoost slain ones of y^ husband of a woman that he had rauysshed. He
let make bathes for lewdenesse / and ete and drank all the night and slepte
y^ day. He ordained now one thing now another / as his folly styred him to do
diverse things. All lechery / al superfluytes all pride / and al manner
thoughts of folly was in him / he haunted al evil / he loved noughty folks
and tourmented the good. He was consenting to y^ death of his fader and of his
mother / and when she was deed he made her to be opened to se the place where he
was conceived. And when he had seen it / he said that she was a fair woman
when she lived. He slew his wife Octouyene that was ry ght a good woman / and
took another y^ he loved much at y^ beginning / and after slew her / he let
sle a kynnes woman of his own because she wol de not be married to him / he
made to sle his little daughter within the age of.vij. years because one bare
her to play with a dukes sons. He let sle y^ noble phylosophre Seneke which
was his may ster. For that that he was always ashamed when he saw him / he
enpoysoned his provost faynynge y^ he would hele him again / he enpoysoned
with metes and drynkes all y^ noble ancient princes and barons of great
auctoryte that had great governance / he made to sie his aunte / and took her
goods / he made to destroy all the nobles of Rome and put them in exyle / and
destroyed their chyl dren / he made a cruel man of Egypt to be accustomed to
ete man's fless he raw to the entente that by him he would make men to be
eten quick what shall I say one may not tell the horrible deeds that he did
ne gathered together y^ erueltees of him. He made fire to be cast all about
Rome vj. days and.vj. nyghtes / and by that pestylence dyed much of the
people / he beheld the falling of his toure / and made great Joy / and song
/ He made to sle saint Peter and saint Poule / and ma ny other martyrs. And in
doing these things when he had reigned the space of.xiiij. years the Romans
y^ had suffered to much rebelled against him / and he fell in dyspayre and slew
himself.

Of the Emperor and of others. Ca. xlix.
I great marvel I have told y^ as y^ it seems by adventure of the
cursednesse of Nero / and of his fragylytes. But I promise the y^ the Emperor
that succeeded him which was named Galba was but little better if he had lived
long / for his cruelte was out of measure. And with his other vices he was so
varyable y^ there was no manner of restraining ne he was never in one estate /
now cruel and without measure / now to soft and without Justice / neglygent
/ enuyous / and full of suspeccyon / little loving his princes and his
knights / caytyfe / and fereful of courage coueytous above all thing / he
reigned but.vj. months for he was slain to shorte^ his crueltes But Othomy
which that succeeded him was no better / For that some say that women ben
cutyous. The Emperor was curyous and delyca te of his body / caytyfe of
courage / seeking after nothing but his ease folyly large / a great gloton
faynte / lecherous / a false traytoure / and full of all shrewdenesse / full of
dysdayne. And ye end of him was that he slew himself after yt he had reigned
three months / for because that his enemies had the vyctory of him in battle.
Uyncylyen that succeeded this Othomy was no better but full of cursednesse / I
wot not what I shall tell the more and thou trow that I lie / read y^
hystoryes of Emperors / and the process of their lives / and thou shalt
find that there were but few in nombre yt were of good condycyons / ryghtfull
and constaunt / of the which good was the Emperor Trayane and Tytus. But I
promise the that against these two good thou shalt find.x. evil. And in the
same wise of ye Popes and of people of holy church / which ought to be more
chosen / but though y^ at the beginning of christian faith there were sayn
tes. Sith the Emperor Constantyne gave to ye church great revenues and
rychesses / ye holiness that has been / read their gestes and crownacles and
tell me if they be of ye same perfeccyon now / and now thou may se at this
day if the world be in amendynge. And if great stablenesse have been and great
constaunce in the deeds and counsayles as much of temporal princes / as of
spyrytuall / it appears enough. I shall say to the more I woe te not to whom
men speak of inconstaunce / nor of varaunce of women / nor how they have no
shame to open their mouth when they behold how in the great deeds governed by
them / and not by ye women with so much inconstaunce and varyaunce as it were
ye deeds of children / and how well their purpose and accord abides y^ they
make in their great counsayles. And I shall tell the all at ones upon these
things / there is none other inconstau^ ce nor varyaunce but to do against
that y^ reason techeth. And a creature reasonable made after the image of god /
and that has knowledge of that y^ enclyneth more to sensualyte than to reason
that is frail / and the more y^ the shrewdenesse is great the ferder it is fro
reason / and ought to be called ye gre^ter fragylyte. And I am certain that
read al alonge the hystoryes of whom that ever they are written though
philosophers and many auctours have said and afferme that there is so great
fragy lyte in women that thou shalt not find any woman of so great
cursednesse as there has been in great quantyte of men. The worste women that
thou shalt find in holy scripture was Athalys and Iesobell her mother queen's
of Iherusalem which poursued the children of Israel. Brunchent queen of
France / and some other. But advise the of the cursednesse of Judas that so
myscheuously betrayed his good master sweet Ihesus to who^ he was appostle yt
had done him so much good / and take heed of Iulyan the apostata. Denis the
tyrant. So many of shrewde kings in diverse countrees / of false Emperoures
and Popes / and other prelates without faith / full of coueytyse / y^
antecrystes also and thou shalt find also ye men have cause to hold their
peace / and that women have cause to thank god / and praise him that ha the put
the treasoure of so many good souls in ye bodies of women. So I shall say no
more as now against them by ensamples of the deeds of them that call these
women so frail. And I shall tell the of diverse women right stable and
constaunt of whom the hystoryes ben right good to here of good ensamples.

Of Grysylde Marquys of Saluce a woman of great virtue / and specially in
pacyence. Ca. l.
Written it is y^ there was a Marquys of Saluce named by name Gautyre sans pere.
He was fair of body and a worshypfull man / but right strange of condycyons
his lords often ty mes counsayled him and prayed him that he would mary / that
he might have issue. But it was long time or he would accord to them. At the
last he said to them that he would with a good will. If it should be agreeable
to them / that he might take such a woman as he would chose to be married unto
/ to the which thing they accorded and ma de their oath thereto. This Marquys
haunted often times the dysporte of hunting and hawkyn ge in the feldes / in
the which among the poor men laborers of that town there dwelled a right
poor man impotent and old yt was called Ianycle / and was a good true man al
his life. This same good man had a daughter of the age o^. xviij years named
Grysylde / which served him by gre te dylygence and found him by ye labor
of her spynnynge. The said Marquys which often times passed that way had well
aduysed the good condycyons and the honest of this maiden whiwas right fair
of body and of vysage / whom he had right gretely in his grace. It happened
that the Marquys yt was accorded with his barons yt he should take a wife /
said to them / yt they should assemble at a certain day for ye weddynges /
and he ^rdeyned that all the ladies should be there / so he let make great
array. And at yt day as all men and women were assembled before him / he made
al yt route to take their horses / for to go with him for to fetch home his
spouse. So they went right unto the house of Ianycle / and there they met
with Grysylde with a pot of water upon her heed whi che came fro the well. He
demanded of her where her fader was. And this Grysy^de mekely kneled down
and said unto him that he was at home. Go seek him said he unto her. And when
the good man was come / ye Marquys said to him yt he would take his daughter by
marriage. And Ia nycle answered him that he should do his pleasure. So the
ladies entered in to the little house and clothed and arrayed the spouse right
nobly so as it perteyned to the estate of a Marquys / of Robes and of Iewelles
that he had ordained for her. So he led her home and wedded her in his
palace. And to make the tale short. This lady bare her so well to every
creature that y^ nobles great and little / and all the people loved her / and
so well she could behave her with every person yt every man held them content
/ and she served and cherysshed her lord so as she ought. This year this lady
had a daughter which was taken in great Joy. But when she was in age that she
was taken fro the pappes The Marquys made the lady to believe for to pro ue her
constaunce / that she dyspleased the lords yt the lygnage of her should
lordeshyp upon them / and and therefore he would that the child were slain To
this thing which ought to be right hard to every mother. Grysylde answered
that the daughter was his own and that he might do his pleasure. So he made
the child to be taken to a squire of his y^ which in making semblaunt that
he came thither to sle the child / and he bare it secretly to Boloyne la grace
to the countess of Payngo which was sister to the Marquys to keep and to
nourysshe it. But for all this Grysylde made never semblaunt of heaviness that
trowed her daughter to be slain. Again in the year after y^ lady was with
child and was delivered of a fair sone the fade received it with great Joy.
And yet again the Marquys would assaye his wife as he did before / and said
to her that the child must needs be slain to content the lords and his
people. And Grysylde answered that if it suffysed not that her child should
dye / that she was ready to dye if it my ght please him. So he took the child
to y^ squire in the ^ame wise as he did that other / and yet she made never
semblaunt of sorrow / ne said other word / but that she prayed the squire that
when he had slain the child / that he would hury him / to the entente that
the tender flesh of the child were not eten with wild beestes / ne with
birds Of this great hardness there appeared never chau^ gynge chere in
Grysylde. But yet it was no^ long after that y^ Marquys would assay her again
when they had been together.vij. years / in the which time the good lady had
borne her so well that it ought to have suffysed y^ proving of her virtue when
the Marquys on a day called her in to his chamber and said to her that he was
in point to lose his lordshyp by his knights and his squyers for her. For
they had great dysdayne to hold for their lady and maystres the daughter of
Ianycle So it is conuenyent if he would appease them y^ she went home again
to her fader so as she came thens / and that he should wedde another more
gentle woman / and of more higher blood. To this thing which ought to be
right grievous and hard to her / a^swered grysylde. My lord I knew well always
and oftymes thought y^ between thy noblesse and magnyfyce^ce and my pouerte
might be no proporcyon nor I thought me not only worthy to be your spouse /
nor also to be y^ poorest of your house. And now I am ready to return in to
the house of my fader / in y^ which I shall were mine age. And as to my dowre
that thou have ordained me to have / that I ought to have I se it well. Thou
know well yt when thou tokest me out of my faders house thou made me to be
dyspoyled all naked / and clothed me again in good robes with the which I
came with y^ / ne never other thing of mine own brought I with me / but faith
/ manner / love / reverence / and pouerte. So it is reason y^ I yield to the
again thy mouable goods. And se here thy robe of which I me despoyle / and
so I yield to y^ y^ ring with the which thou dydest wedde me / and I yield to
the all other rings / Iewelles / clothing / and array / by y^ which I was
worshypped and enryched in thy chamber / all naked out of my faders house I
came / and all naked I shall turn again. Save yt it me seems a thing
vnconuenable yt this womb in the which the children were y^ thou had
engendered should appear all naked before y^ people For the which if it pleas
the and none otherwise I pray the y^ for the recompensacyon of my vygynyte y^
I brought in to thy palace the which I bear not again that it may please the
that there might be left unto me a simple smock with the which I shall cover
the womb of thy wife / sometime Marquyse. And then y^ Marpuys might not hold
him no more from weeping for compassyon / and yet he overcame his courage and
ordained yt there was brought to her a smock. Then in the presence of all y^
knights and ladies Grysylde dyspoyled her / and did of her hosen and shoes /
and put of all her ornaments / and nothing remained but only the smock.
Then stretched the rumoure all about that y^ Marquys would depart from his
wife and all men and women were come to the palace so rowing gretely of this
thing. And Grysylde all naked save her smock / bare heeded / and bare foot
was set upon an horse / and with company of lords / knights / and ladies /
that all men and women wept cursynge the Marquys and sorowed gretely the
goodness of the lady / yet Grysylde never cast teere out of her eyes and was
conuayed unto y^ house of her fader / the which good old man had been always in
doubt thinking y^ his lord should be full every day of so poor a marriage.
Then he he ring the noise went to mete with his daughter and brought to her
her old cote all to torn which he had kept / so she clothed her again
without showing semblau^t of any sorrow. And thus dwelled Grysylde with her
fader a while in such humylyte and pouerte and in serving her fader as she
was wont / no sorrow showing outwardes nor no heavy countenance was seen in
her / but recom forted her fader of his heaviness that he had for to se his
daughter to fall from so great highness in to so great pouerte. And when the
Marquys se med that he had proved his true spouse enough / he sent to his
sister that she should come to him right nobly accompanied with lords and
ladies / and should bring with her his two young children without making
semblaunt that they were his And he made his barons and sugectes to understand
de that he would take a new wife / and wedde a right notable lady which his
sister had in kepyn ge. So he made to assemble a right fair company of
knights and of ladies in his palas that sa me day that his sister should
aryue / And he let make right a fair feast and a great. So he sent to
Grysylde and said to her in this manner. Grysylde the maiden that I shall wedde
shall be here to morrow. And for that I desire that my sister and her company
should be right nobly received / for that that thou know my condycyon / and
how I ought to receive lords and ladies / and thou know the chambres and
places / and to the entente that every person be well lodged after his estate
/ and in especyall my spouse that shall be. For I will that thou have all the
charge / And all officers shall obaye unto the. So think thereon and se that
all be well ordained. Grysylde answered and said she would do it with right a
good will. And in the morning the company were ary ued / great was there the
fceste. And Grysylde left not for her lewd coote / but that she went with a
glad chere to mete the maiden and new spouse as she trowed / and making
reverence humbly kneled before her saying welcome my lady and also to the sone
/ and to all men and women of the com pany / and thus received them each after
their estate right Ioyously. And though so be that she was in the habyte of a
poor woman it seemed by her be hauoure y^ she was a woman of right great
worship / and of meruayllous prudence so much that the strangers meruaylled
them how such fair speech / and such worshypfull might be under so poor an
habyte. Grysylde had made so well to be ordained al things that there was
nothing amysse at the point. But with so good a will dre we her nyghe this
maiden and the sone / that she could not depart from them. The Marquys had
made* ready all things as for to wedde the young maiden. And when it came to
the hour to sing the mass. Then came ye Marquys and before all he called
Grysylde and said to her how seems y^ Grysylde of my new spouse / is she not
fair and goodly. And she answered full goodly. Certainly my lord there may
not be found a good liar ne a fayrer. But of one thing I will pray y^ in good
faith and counsel y^ that is that thou make her not sorry / ne prycke her not
with the nedles of which thou have proved that other. For this is more young
and more delycyously nourysshed / so parad uenture she shall not suffered as yt
other has done Then ye Marquys herynge y^ words of Grysylde considering her
great stablenesse strength and constaunce had great marvel of her virtue /
and pity took him that he had given her to suffer with out saying the
contrary. So he began to say thus in the presence of all the people. Grysylde
it ought enough to suffyse y^ proving of thy con staunce / of thy very
faith / truth / and great love / hobey saunce / and meekness / well proved
toward me. And believe it that there is no man under heaven that by so many
proves has known the love of marriage as I have done in the. And then the
Marquys went nere her which held down her heed for shame for the great
praysynge that he said to her. So he enbraced her uraytely in his arms and
kyssed her in saying. Thou art mine only spouse / other weddynges shall I
never ha ue. This maid that thou thynkest that should be my spouse is thy
daughter and mine / and that other is thy sone and mine. So know they all that
be here that that I have done has been to prove my true spouse / and not to
condemn her. And I have made my children to be nourysshed at Boloyne la grace
with my sister / and not s^ayne them / now se them here. Then this lady herynge
the words of her lord y^ Marquys fell down flat for Joy And when she came
to herself she took y^ children in her arms / and it was no doubt but her
heart had meruayllous* Joy. And all the people wept for Joy and pity. There
was she grieved more than ever she was before. So she was clothed again and
arrayed right rychely. So the feast was great and right Joyous where every man
had great worcester des of the praysynge of this lady. And they lived together.xx.
years in great Joy and peace. And the Marquys made Ianycle her fader of whom
he made no great compte before to come to y^ palace and there he held him in
great worship / he married his children hyghly and after him his sone succeeded
by y^ good will of the lords / and of y^ comunes also.

Of Florence of Rome. Ca. lj.
OF Grysylde Marquyse of Saluce yt had enough of virtuous strength / and
constaunce I have said to y^. Now I shall tell the of the noble Florence
Empress of rome which by meruaylous pacyence suffered great aduersyte / so as
it is written of her in the miracles of our lady. This la die was of sovereign
beauty but she was more cha ste / and virtuous. It happened yt the Emperor
her husband ought to go to a great war right a great way thens. So he left
to keep his country / and his wife / a brother that he had the which tempted
with the enemy after the departing of y^ Emperor coueyted folyly his
brothers wife / and to speak shortly he held her so short that she sho^ de
accord to his will / yt for dread y^ after y^ prayers he would use her by force
/ he put her in prison in a strong toure and there she was till the coming of
the Emperor when it came that the tidings were brought that y^ said
Emperor was come again / he made y^ lady to be taken out of prison / she not
wenynge that he would complain on her wrongfully and he did it to the entente
yt she should keep y^ country while he would go against his brother / at the
arrynge of whom he took all the evil of this good lady / and the worste yt
might be said by the which the Emperor yt byleued him sent his people and
ordained yt or he should aryue with out making any mencyon of it that she
should be slain. For he would not se her ne find her onlyue. But she
meruayllynge much of these tidings prayed so much to them that were
committed to do this thing that they should let her go in an habyte unknown.
So they granted her her desire. Then this noble lady went and by a strange
adventure that happened her / she was committed to keep a child of a great
prince. So it fortuned that y^ brother of that prince was taken with the love of
her / in so much that after that he had required her enough / for despyte
that she would not accord to him / he slew the young child by her as she
slepte to y^ entente to make her to be destroyed. All these aduersytees which
were not little suffered this noble lady the Empress right pacyently and by
right strong and constaunt courage. And when she should be led to the place
where she should be put to y^ death as she y^ some supposed had slain the
child such pity came to the lord and to the lady for the fair life and the
great ver tues y^ they had seen in her that their hertes could not suffer her
to dye / but they put her in exyle. In the which place as she was in great
pouerte and was right pacyent and devout toward god and his sweet mother / she
slepte on a time after her prayers made to god in a fair grene place / the^
she had a vysyon of the blessed vyrgyne Mary y^ she should gader a certain
herb yt was under her heed / and with that herb she should get her living /
in helynge all manner of sykenesses. And on a time after by the said herb the
lady had heled so many syke folks / of whom y^ renown sprange all abou te it
fortuned that the brother of y^ prince that had slain the child above said was
syke of a great sykenesse right horrybly / for whom men were sen te to fetch
this woman to hele him. And when she was come in to his presence she said to
him that he might well se that god beat him with his rods / and that he
should confess his sin openly / and he should be hole / for otherwise she
might not hele him. And then he moved with great contryey on confessed his
horrible wickedness / and how he himself had slain the child thrughe
which y^ good lady was blamed yt kept him. The prince was passing wroth
with this and would at all times do Justice on his brother. But the noble lady
prayed him so much that she appeased him to him / and then she heled him anon
/ and thus this good lady yielded good for evil after the co^maun bement of
god. It happened in the same wise and it tarried not long after / but that the
brother of the Emperor / by y^ which Florence was exyled fell in so horrible
sykenesse of the lyppre that he was all stynkynge. And as the voice went in
all the world how there was a woman yt would hele al manner of sykenesse.
Anon men were sen te out to seek her by the commandment of y^ Em peroure
without any knowledge what she was.

For he demed his wife to be deed long before.

And when she was come before him she said to him that it was conuenyent that
he should confess him openly / for otherwise he might not be heled. But as he
refused it long time / at the last he opened all his wickedness that he had
done to the Empress / for y^ which he wist well that god punysshed him. This
thing herd of the Emperor being passing wroth of that yt he trowed that
he had made his true spouse to dye that he loved so much would have slain his
brother. But the good lady opened herself to the Emperor and made the peace
between him and his brother. And thus Florence recovered by the merit of her
patyence / her estate and felycyte / with great Joy of the Emperor and of
all people.

Of the wife of Barnabo the Geneuoys. Capitulo.lij.
TO the purpose yet of women that be constaunte may well be brought to
remembrance the hystory that Bocace tells in his book of Cent nouuelles how
it happened on a time in Paris / as many merchants Lombardes and Italyens
were together at a souper. In which as they spoke of many things they tell to
spe ke of their wives / so much that among others a Ianeuoys that was called
Barnabo began gre tely to praise his wife of beauty / of wit / of chastyte
above all things / and of al virtues. So there was another outragyous felawe
in the company named Ambrose which said that he was a fool to praise his wife
so much and specially of chastyte and that there was none so strong but that
one should overcome her by gifts / by promise / and fair words / and so to
come to his entente. Of this thing began a great strife between them twain
and it came so far forth y^ they laid in wager the some of.v. thousand
Floryns Barnabo said yt / y^ other should not lie with his wife for all yt he
could do And Ambrose laid yt he should / and y^ he would bryn ge so good a
token yt it should suffyse* yt other merchants did as much as they could to
seas the debate but it auayled not. Ambrose departed th^s as soon as he might
/ and went to Gene / and when he came there he inquired gretely of y^ life of
the wife of Bar^abo / But to say shortly / so much he herd record of her
great goodness that he lost al his hope that he should never come to his
entente whereof he found himself gretely abashed and repentaunt of his folly.
And he aduysed him of a gre te malice / for it grieved his heart right sore to
lose so.v. thousand floryns. So he did so much yt he spoke to an old poor
woman yt repaired often times to the house of y^, good woman. And gave and
promised her so much that he was put in a great cofre / and was borne in to
the chamber of ye said good woman to whom y^ old poor woman had made to
understand that there was much good gere in y^ cofre / which was taken her
to keep / and thieves labored to rob her / and therefore she prayed her that
it might abide a little while in her chamber to be kept till they came home yt
ought it / to the which thing y^ good woman consented with a good will.
Ambrose which was in the cofre made such a wait upon the lady by ny ght that
he saw her all naked / and with yt went preuyly out of y^ cofre and took a
gyrdell and a purse made with the nedle yt she had wrought by good craft. And
after entered in to the cofre again so preuyly that the lady that slepte / and
with her a ly tell daughter that she had felt nothing of it. And when he had been there.iij. days y^ old poor woman came again to fetch her cofre.
Ambrose yt had great Joy and wend yt he had well employed his entente / went
to Parysagayne and reported to her husband before all the company that he had
line with his wife at his ease. And first he told him the token of the
chamber and of ye payntynge that was in it. After he showed him the purse and
the gyrdell that he knew well / and said that the had given it to him / and
told him all the facyon of her body / and that he saw her all naked / and he
told him also that she had a little spotte as it we re a warte under the lift
pappe. Then y^ husband byleued stably by the tokens the words of Am brose /
of which if he were sorry no man marvel And then he paid him and contented
him of this v. thousand floryns. And as soon as he might he went to Gene.
And before that he should aryue he sent expressly to his factoure that
governed all his doings there / in whom he trusted above all things the
manner how he would yt he should sle this woman his wife / the which y^
commaun dement seen made the good woman to mount on horseback / and made her
to believe that he would bring her to her husband. And the good woman which
byleued him well went with him with great Joy. But when they were come into a
woe de he told her that he must needs sle her by the co^ maundement of his
master her housbande. And to make the tale short this woman did so much
which was so good and so fair and so much she could preche that he let her
go so that she should promise him yt she should go out of the country. She that
was thus escaped went unto a town and did so much to a good woman that she
bought her clothing for a man / so she cut of her here and she arrayed her
in the likeness of a young man. And she did so much that she put herself
with a rich man of Cateloyne named Syguyr Ferant yt was come down from his
ship to refresshe him so she served him so well that he held him conten te
meruayllously. For he found never so good a servant / and this same woman
called herseite Sagurat Daffynoly. This Saguyr Ferant yt went again in to the
ship and Sagurat daffynoly with him went so much by see till he came in to
Alexandre / and there he bought faucons right fair and good / horses also. And
after that he went towar de the Sowdan of Babylone with whom he had good
frendeshyp / and when he had byden there a while and the Sowdan aduysed well
this Sagurat Daffynoly the which served so dylygently his master / and the
which seemed to him so fair and gracyous that he pleased him meruayllously so
much that he prayed this Saguyr Ferant yt he would give him to him / and he
would make him a great master / and he granted him against his will. And to
say shortly so well this Sagurat Daffynoly served the Sowdan that he trusted
no man so much as he did him / and was so great master about him that he
governed all. It hap pened that in a town of the Sowdans should be a great
fair where merchants came of all parties / the Sowdan ordained Sagurat yt he
should go in to that town to keep the fair / and to take heed of his right.
And as it happened as god wol de yt to that fair was come with other Italyens
that brought many Iewelles this false Ambrose above said / which was gretely
enryched with y^ goods of Barnabo. Sagurat that was lyeutenaunt of the town
of the Sowdans was gretely worshypped of all people / and for he was a great
lord and a great master the merchants brought to him every day Iewelles to
selle. So amon ge others there came to him that same Ambrose / and as he had
opened a little cofre full of Iewelles before Sagurat to the entente yt he
should se them And in this cofre was y^ purse and the gyrdell before said / by
the which as soon as Sagurat saw it he knew it well and took it in his
hand and beheld it strongely meruayllynge gretely how they might come
thither. And Ambrose that but little thought of yt adventure began to laughe
right fa ste / and Sagurat yt saw him laughe said to him Friend I suppose that
thou laughest of that / that I muse to behold this woman's thing / and
forsothe it is right fair. And Ambrose answered hy^ My lord it is at your
commandment. But I laughe for that that I bethynke me of the manner how I
had it. So god give me Joy said Sagurant I pray the tell me how thou had
it. By my faith said Ambrose I shall tell you how I gate it / I had it of a
fair gentylwoman yt gave it me with whom I lay all a hole night. And
moreover beside that I gate five thousand Floryns of good gold for a wager
that I did make with the folyss he husband of her that is named Barnabo
which durst so lewdely lay it with me that I should not lie with his wife /
and now ye unhappy man has slain her also. But he has better deserved to
be punysshed than she. For a man may well know that every woman is frail and
light to overcome. So there is no man yt ought to have affyaunce in a woman.
Then knew Sa gurat the cause of the wrath of her housbande yt she knew never
before. But as a right prudent and stable wisely she dyssymyled unto the time
yt it come to the point. So she made semblaunt to have right great solace of
this thing / and she said to him that he was right a good felawe / and yt he
would have him right specially in frendeshyp / and that he would that he should
abide and bye marchaundyse for them both / and that he would take him enough
whereof in his hands. Of that Am brose had great Joy. And forth with Sagurat
made to deliver him an house. And for to deceive him the better she took him
money in his hands And showed him so great sign of love yt he was always with
him. And she made him to tell that Iape before the Sowdan to make him to laughe
And to say shortly how the thing was determined. So much Sagurat did and
pourchased that she did so much to the Ieneuoys that were in that country
after that that she knew the estate of Baruabo yt was fallen in pouerte. what
for the great fynaunce that he had paid / and for the great sorrow that he
took therefore that Barna bo should come over in to that country by the com
maundement of the Sowdan / and to make ye tale short / when he was come in to
that country he ca me before ye Sowdan. And anon Sagurat made seek after
Ambrose. But or he came he had well enfourmed the Sowdan how Ambrose lied in
making his auaunte yt he made of this woman. And she prayed him also that in
case that the trou ^he were come to knowledge yt he would punysshe Justly the
said Ambrose / the which thing when Ambrose and Barnabo were come before the
Sowdan / Sagurat began to say in this manner. Ambrose it pleases to our lord
that is here that thou tell the Iape all alonge how thou dydest get of
Barnabo that here is.v. thousand floryns where of thou haste told him by what
manner thou did lie with his wife. And then Ambrose changed co loure as he to
whom the truth might uneaths suffer to cover so an untrue fraud / for it
was to him a sudden thing of the which he took no he de. Then he took to him
a little manner and answe red. My lord it is no force though I tell it not.
Barnabo knows well enough. I have shame of his shame. And then Barnabo full
of sorrow and of shame prayed yt he might never here of it more / and that he
would let him leave. But Sagurat answered as in laughing that he should not
go / and that it was conuenyent that he let him tell it. Then Ambrose which
saw that he was constrained began to say all with a trembling voice that he
had made Barnabo to understand and all as he had told them. And when he had
ended his reason Sagurat asked of Barnabo if it were true that Ambrose had said
/ and he answered and said ye without fail. And how said Sagurat be ye well
certain that this man here lay with your wife / for that that he told to you
certain tokens / be you such a be that you can not know that by ways
ynowe fraudelently he might know ye facyon of her body without lyenge with her
/ and ye have for this cause made your wife to dye / ye are worthy to dye
yourselfe for ye have no suffycyent proof. Then Barnabo had great dread And
then Sagurat that would no longer be still and that her seemed time to speak
said to Ambrose False traytoure say the truth without making the to be
tourmented. And ye woman of whom y^ auauntest the is not yet deed / but she is
not far hens to say ye contrary to thy false lesynges. For y^ touched her
never. There was a great assemble / what of lords of the Sowdans as of great
foyson of Lombardes which meruayllously herkened this thing. And to say it
shortly this Ambrose was so led yt he confessed before the Sowdan and all
the people all the fraud / and how he had wrought by coueytyse to get
those.v. thousand Floryns. when Barnabo herd this almost he was out of
himself / for yt he wyste none other but that his wife was slain. But the
good woman came to him and said / what would thou give him that would yield
the thy wife again alive hole and chaste Barnabo answered and said that he
would give all that ever he could make in the world. And then she said unto
him. Barnabo brother and friend / how is that thou know not her. And as he
was abashed that he wist not what he did she vnbotened her breast and said to
him I am thy dear felawe yt thou haste condemned to the death without cause.
And then they embraced each other in meruayllous great Joy. And the Sowdan and
all the people was gretely admeruayled of this thing / and right gretely pray
sed the great virtue of this woman / and they gave her great gifts. And all
the goods that was perteynynge to Ambrose was given to her / and he was put
unto the death right myscheuously / And right so Barnabo and the good woman his
wife turned home again in to their country / and there they lived together
long time after in prosperyte and Joy.

Here it shows how after that / that Ryghtwysnesse had told of these
constaunce / my lady Xp^ine asked her if it be true that diverse men say that
there ben but few women true in their amourouse life / and thereto a^swered
ryghtwysnes. Capitulo.liij.
WHen my lady ryghtwysenesse had tol de me all these things and enough of
others which I leave for shortness So as of Loonce that was a woman of Greece /
the which would never for tourmentes that any man would do to her accuse two
men with yt which she was aquaynted / but cut of her tongue with her tethe
before the Judge to put him out of hope that she should tell him by strength of
tourmentes. And ynowe of other ladies and gentylwomen which were of constaunte
courage that they had lever to drink poison and dye / than to bow against
right and truth. And then I said to her / Madame ye have showed me enough
great constaunce in the courage of women and all other virtues / that truly
there may no more be said of no man. So I marvel me gretely how so many
worshypfull ladies that ha ue ben so wise and so well lettred / and that have
gotten the fair style of endytynge and to make fair books has suffered so
long without saying y^ contrary so many errors to be wytnessed against them
by diverse men when that they knew well yt it was of great wrong. Answer / my
dear friend this questyon is light enough to assoyle / thou may se by that
that is said before / that ye great virtues of these ladies of whom I have
told y^ here abo ue in diverse works dyfferenced one from another ententyfely
occupied and not all in one self thing. This work was reserved to the to
make and not to them / an to people of good understanding / ye women were
praised enough without other writing. And as to the longnesse of time passed
without gain saying all things comes well to point / and enough to ye
beholdynge of the long world / how long suffers god heresies to be in the
world against the holy law / which yet endures yt he has not destroyed
them. So it is of many other things yt ben suffered long without gain saying
and sith they be reproved at ye last Then I Xp^ine said to her. Madame ye say
pas sing well. But I yield me certain / yt many noyses grows among the
evil sayers of this present work / which will say yt if it be true yt some
women have been / and ben good / yet they be not so al Answer. what marvel
though they be not all noted / that of the company of Ihesu christ there were
but.xij. yet was one right evil / and these men durst say yt all women should
be good / what shol de they be than I suppose when all men be parfyte that the
women shall follow them. I Xp^ine a^swered. Madame now let us leave these
questyons / but a little yssuynge out of terms whereof we have spoken till now
/ right gladly I would ma ke you some demaundes to ye same purpose if yt I
knew yt it should not noy you / for that y^ the matter though it be founded
upon the law of kind / it comes not all by the attemperynge of reason.

And she answered unto me / dear friend / say what thou will. For the dyscyple
yt asks of ye master ought not to be reproved though he ask yt he desires
to know. Madame there renneth in ye worl de a natural law of men to women /
and women to men / not the law made by the stablynge of peo ple / but by
carnal enclynacyon by the which they love each other of right great and
strong love by one pleasant time / and so they know not to what cause ne
wherefore such love one of another is fyx ed in them. And in this love yt is
comune enough and it is called y^ amourous life / ye men say comunely yt women
though they promise / there he but fe we abiding in one place / and of little
love. Right subtle and faynte / and all yt comes of the lyghtnesse of their
courage. And among all other auctours y^ accuses them of yt Ouyde in his book
of ye craft of love gives them right great charge / and this Ouy de says and
others in ye same wise when they have blamed enough ye women upon yt thing yt
they put in their books as well of y^ descyuable condycyons of them as of their
wickedness yt they do it for ye comune welthe to ye entente to advise ye me^
of their cauteyles ye better to eschew them / so as of ye serpent which is
hid under an herb. So please it you mine own lady to teache me the trou th
of this thing. Answer. My dear friend as to that yt they say yt women be
desceyuable I wot not what I shall say to the more. For thyselfe has treated
suffycyentely enough of this matter / as well against this Ouyde as against
others in thine epistle of ye god of love. And in the epystles upon the
Romaunce of the rose. But upon the point yt thou have touched to me / yt they
say yt they do yet for the comune welthe. I shall show the yt it was
nothing for yt cause / and se here the reason. The comune profit in a Cite /
or a country / or in comunalte of people is none other thing but one profit /
and the general welthe is of y^ which each one has his part. But the thing
yt should be done in profit some and not to some / should be called the
pryuate welthe or propre / and not ye comune. And yet yt shall do the less
good yt is taken away from one and given to another. And this thing ought to
be called not pryuate welthe or propre / but right great extorcyon made to
another in favor of the party. So thou may se and perceive clearly yt they
do it favorably and in preiudyce of one part to his gryefe to sustain yt
other. For they spoke not to ye women in aduysynge them yt they keep them from
the awaytes of men. And yet it is a thing right certain often times yt they
desceyue women by their cauteylous and false semblaunt. And it is no doubt yt
the women be as well in the nombre of ye creatures erthely as be the men. Then
I conclu de yt they should do for y^ comune welthe yt is to un derstande of.ij.
parts they should have spoken as well to ye women yt they should beware of the
men as they have done to the men to beware of ye women. But for to leave to goo
to questyon and in following ye other / yt is to understand y^ women be not of
so little love there as their hearts is set and that they be more stabler
tha^ they say / it shall suffy se to prove it by ensample of them y^ have
perceyuered unto the death. And first I shall tell the of y^ noble Dydo queen of
Cartage of whom it is spo ken here above of her great valor as thyselfe ha
the touched other times.

Here it speaks of Dydo queen of Cartage to y^ purpose y^ love is stable in a
woman. Ca. liiij.
SO as it is said above. Dydo queen of Cartage being in her cite in Joy and
peace reygnynge gloryously come by fortune Eneas fled from Troy after the
destruccyon of ye Du ke and capytayne of many Troyans cast by diverse tempests
/ their ships broken / their vytayles failed / and great loss of people.
Desirous of rest / we ry of rouynge by y^ see / busy to get lodging / aryued
at y^ port of Cartage / and as for doubt of mysta king he would not be so
hardy to take lord with out license of y^ of the queen / but sent to her to
know whyder it pleased her or no. But y^ noble lady full of worship and of
worthynes which knew well that the Troyans were of more reputacyon for y^
time / then was any nacyon of the world. And y^ this Duke Eneas was of the
noble blood royal of Troy. She gave him not only license that he should take
the land / But she herself with a noble company of lords / and ladies / and
gentyl women came against him unto the sea side / and received him and all his
company with great worship / she led him in to her cite and gretely
worshypped him / feested him / and eased him / why should I make the tale
long. So long Eneas was there at soiourne / ease / and rest / that he
thought but little of all the tourmentes that he had before And so much was
their hauntynge / y^ love which subtylly can set harteson fire made that one
to love that other. But after that that experyence showed she loved much
better Eneas than he die de her. For notwithstanding that he had given to her
his faith that he should never take other woman / but that he should be hers
evermore / he departed after that / that she had refresshed him with good and
ease / his ships garnysshed full of trea sour and goods / as she that had
not spared her goods there as the heart was holly set went away without
taking leave by night right tray tourously without knowing of her / and thus
he paid his hostess. The which departing was to her so great sorrow of him
that she loved so mo che that she would forsake all Joy and her life also. And
in deed after that she had wept and wayled enough she cast herself in a
great fire that she le te make / and so she burnt herself. And others say
that she slew herself with the sword of Eneas. And thus pyteously ended y^
noble queen Dydo y^ which had been so greatly worshypped y^ she passed in
renown all other women in her time.

Of Medea the true Lover. Ca. lv.
MEdea daughter of the king of Colcos which had so much understand dynge
loved ofto great love and stable Jason. This Jason was a knight of Greece right
manly in arms. He herd tell that in y^ I Will of Colcos which was in the
country of which the fader of Medea was king / there was a sheep that seemed
as impossyble to conquer. And yet it was prophesied that by a knight it should
be conquered. Jason which understood this thing / as right desirous to
encreas his renown from good to better / departed from Greece with a great
company to the entente to prove him in this conquest. And as he was ary ued in
the foresaid country of Colcos / the king of the land said to him that it was
impossyble y^ by the prowess of arms of man the golden fleece might be gotten.
For it was a thing made by en chautement / and y^ as many knights as assayed
it were perysshed. So he would not that he should lose his life in such
manner. And Jason said shor tely that sith he had taken the enterprise in hand
he would not leave to dye therefore. Medea the dou ghter of y^ king which saw
Jason of such beau te and o^ so great renown / and of the lygnage of a kyn ge
seemed that he were a good marriage for her / and that he might y^ better employe
his love to her she thought to keep him from the death. For great py te took
her y^ such a knight should perysshe so. So she spoke to him long and at
laysoure / and to say shortly she took him charms and enchauntementesas she
y^ could all / and taught him all ye manner how and by what way he should
conquer y^ golden fleece so y^ Jason should promise her to take her to wife
without having other / and to love her truly. But of this promise lied Jason.
For after that that he was come to his entente he left her for another /
whereof as soon as he had left her she fell in such dyspayre y^ there was
never after Joy in her heart

Of Tysbe the maiden. Ca* lvj.
OUyde tells in his book of Methamorphoseos that in the cite of Babylone
were.ij. noble and rich Cytezynes right nyghe neighbors yt ye walls of
their houses yt they dwelled in Joined togvder. These.ij. men had.ij. children
fair above all others / yt one a sone yt was named Pyra mys / and yt other a
daughter which was named Tysbe. These.ij. children which yet were without
malice / as of ye age of.vij. years loved so parfytely together yt they might
not abide one from another. And it was their guyse always yt every day to rise
in the morning together to take their refeccyon of their faders for to go to
play with other children of their age to ye entente yt they might be always
together / and at al their plays one might se them together / and thus endure
till they were waxe^ great / and as they grew in age so increased ye flambes
of their love / so much yt by their hauntynge they were perceived / and so
some had suspeccyon by the which it was reported to the mother of Tysbe The
which took such wrath of this thing yt she shytte her fast in her chambres
/ and said that she would keep her well enough fro the hauntynge of Pyramys.
Of this prison were right sorrowful these two lovers that their wepynges and
com playntes were right pyteous. And so was this sorrow to them right hard for
that none of them might se other. This dystresse endured passing long / the
which made not less their love / ne made them nothing ye slower for so much
as they saw not each other but always increased the hete of their age / so
much that they were come to the age of.xv. years. It happened on a day so as
fortune would that Thysbe that thought always in her love all weeping in her
chamber beholdynge the wall that was between y^.ij. houses in sayen ge
pyteously. O thou wall of hard stone which make the departing between my
love and me / if there were any pity in the thou would cleue in sondre to the
entente that I might se him that I have desired so much. And as she said these
words / she saw by adventure in a corner y^ wall cleued by the which she
perceived the light of that other part / and then she dygged in the clefte
with the pendant of her gyrdell / for other tool had she none / ye hole
increased so much ye she put thrughe the pendant / to the entente that Pyramys
should perceive it. The which thing happened as by this token these.ij.
lovers often times assembled to speak together in the foresaid hole where they
made their pyteous complayntes. And at the last constrained by great love they
took counsel that they would stele away by night fro their faders and
moders. And that each of them should find other at a well under a white
mulbery tree / where they were wont to play in their youth. And as Tysbe
which loved more was the first come to the well abiding her love / she
being aferde of a lion that she herd coming to drink at the well she fled
to hyde her in a busshe there by. And in going she let fall a white
couerchefe the whi che the lion found / and cast upon it the entrayles of
beestes that he had devoured / Pyramys came or y^ Tysbe durst come out of the
busshe. And for that he found the couerchefe of Tysbe which he perceived by
the moon light charged with the entraylles / trowed verily that his love was
devoured. So he had so great sorrow that he slew himself with his sword. And
as he was in dyen ge Tysbe came which found him in that point and by the
token of the couerchefe y^ she saw him have in his hand she knew ye cause of
y^ evil adventure / whereof she had such sorrow y^ she would live no longer.
And when she saw that the spyry te of her love was out of his body after many
gre te ^amentacyons that she made she slew herself with the same sword.

Of the good woman Hero. Ca. lvij.
THe noble young woman Hero loved not much less ye Hander than did Tysbe
Pyramys. For as this Hander to keep the worship of her loved better to put him
in great peril tha^ she should be blamed for him / to y^ entente y^ their love
might endure the longer / without espyenge of any people / he took such a
manner to se his lady often times. He rose by night from his bed to the
entente y^ no man should know it. And went alone to an arm of ye see right
large which was called Herles and passed over swymmynge till he ca me to a
castle named Habydon y^ stood upon the ryuere in y^ other side where y^ Hero
dwelled which abode at a wyndowe / and in the long nyghtes of winter held
out a bronde of fire at the wyndo we to the entente y^ he should come the right
way thither. These.ij. lovers continued this life many years till fortune had
envy of their solacyous life / and thought to trouble them. For as it
happened on a time of winter y^ by the woodnesse of y^ see the ryuere was full
of tempest and passing deep and peryllous / the which tempest during so
long without ceasing y^ they thought it right long y^ one to se that other
which was right noyous to the.ij. lovers and gretely they complained them of
y^ wind and of the tempest that endured so long At the last the Hander whom
great desire chased by that y^ he saw in a night the bronde at ye wyndowe y^
Hero held It seemed him y^ she called him and he thought great cowardyse y^ he
put him not in peril / and that he went not / for dread of which he doubted
him. And she would feign defend hy^ y^ he should not go to put him in such
peril if she might. Notwithstanding she held out y^ bronde at adventure to
teache him the right way if he would needs do it. So thus happened the unhap py
adventure y^ the Hander put himself in the ryuere and might not strive against
the flode of y^ wa ter which bare him so far that he must needs drown. The
good Hero to whom her heart gave as it happened seized never weeping. And when
ye clear day appeared as she y^ slepte not went agay ne to y^ wyndowe where she
had been all the night And she saw ye body of her love flete upon the wa ter
nyghe ye brynke. She y^ would not live no long after cast her in to ye see /
and did so much y^ she ^oke her love in her arms / and so dyed / and thus
she was perysshed.

Of Sysmonde daughter of the prince of Salerne. Ca. lviij.
BOcace tells in y^ book of Cent Nou uelles y^ a prince of Salerne named
Cancre had a fair daughter right gentle and courtoys which was named
Sysmonde. He loved this daughter of so great love that with great pain he
would accord unto the styrynge of his lords to marye her to the Earl of
Champayne. But as she that should not abide long in marriage / this Earl dyed
and ye fader took her home again to him / thinking never to marye her again.
The lady which was nourysshed tenderly / and was right fair / and in the
flower of her youth. And which yt knew the will of her fader that she should
be ma ryed again went and aduysed her among all the servants of her fader
of a squire the which above all the others though there were great foy son of
knights and gentle men he seemed to her fair and good / and worthy to be
loved. And so much that she thought to pass her youth more Joy ously to take
her pleasau^ce. And long time or she would dyscouer this thing she beheld
every day when she sat at her faders table the manner / coun tenaunce / and
condycyons of the squire which was named Guyscart so much that from day to
day he seemed to her more parfyte among all thyn ges. By the which she called
him on a day before her and said to him in this manner / Guyscart fair friend
the trust that I have in your bounte / beauty / and wisdom / counsayleth me to
dyscouer to you of diverse things that touches me right secret the which I
would not tell to none other body. But I would or yt I tell it you to have your
truth that shall never be opened by you. Guyscart an swered. Madame you need
not to doubt that there shall be nothing known by me that ye tell me / and
for that I assure you by my truth. And then said Sysmonde to him / Guyscarte
know it for truth yt my pleasaunce is in a gentylman / that I love and
wylloue / and for that that I may not well speak to him nor by whom to send
him my will. I would that ye were mean of our loves. Now behold if I have
great trust in you above all others when I will put mine honor in your
hands. And there he set him on his knees and said. Madame I know well that ye
have su che wit and goodness that ye would not do the thing vnconuenable.
So I thank you right mekely that ye trust in me more than in another. Now
command your good pleasure to me your servant / and I shall obey to my power
and serve him if I knew which he were yt were so happy to have the love of a
lady of so great worthynesse / as ye are. For certes he has not failed of a
noble love. When Sysmonde yt had will to prove him had herd him speak so
wisely. The^ she took him by the hand and said. Friend Guyscart know it that
thou art he that I have chosen for mine one ly love / and in whom I will take
all my pleasaun ce. For me seems that the noblesse of thy courage and the good
manners of which thou art full yel death the worthy to have an high love. The
young man had great Joy of this thing and thanked right humbly / and shortly
to say / long time con tynued their love without that / ye any tidings was
felt thereof. But fortune enuyous of their so lace would no longer suffer
these.ij. lovers in Joy but turned their dysporte in to great and bitter
sorrow by meruaylous adventure. It fortuned in a summers day yt Sysmonde
dysported her in a gar dyne with her maidens / at yt hour her fader that had
none other welthe but when he saw her wen te alone in to her chamber to
dysporte him with her. But when he found ye wyndowes shytte and the curteynes of
the bed drawn / and that there was no body there trowed that she had been a
sleep. So he would not awake her but laid him on a little couche / and there
he slepte strongly. when Sysmonde thought yt she had been long enough in ye
gardyne she went to her chamber and laid her on her bed as for to sleep /
all her women were voyded and shytte the door upon her / not perceiving yt her
fader or any other was there / and when she saw her self alone she rose from
her bed and went to seek Guyscart which was in one of he wardrobes / and
brought him in to her chamber. And so as they de uysed between them two within
the curteyns as they yt trowed yt they were alone / the prince awoke and
understood yt there was a man with his daughter / he had so great sorrow of ye
thing yt of pain the consyderacyon yt he should dyshonoure his daughter might
not keep hym*but that he had de parted them. Nevertheless he suffered and
understood well who it was / and did so much yt he lepte out of the chamber
they not knowing of him. And when these two lovers had been enough together
Guyscarte departed. But the prince that had made watch upon him / anon he
made him to be ta ken and prysoned him. And after went to his daughter / and
they being alone in ye chamber ye eyesfull of teeres / and with great sorrow
began to say to her. Sygysmonde I trowed to have in y^ a dou ghter above all
women / fair / chaste / and wyse*but of so much am I y^ more overcome to say
as thou ghe I had trowed the contrary. For if I had not seen it with mine eyes
there was nothing that should have made me believe that thou had be sup prysed
with the love of any man*but it had been thine housbande. But as of yt I am
certain ye sorrow thereof shall be the tourment of mine age. And of that little
time yt I have to live / and that which en grudgeth most my wrath is that y^
I trowed y^ to be of more noble courage then any woman bor ne. And I se well
the contrary / by that y^ thou have taken the to one of ye leest of mine
household. For if thou would have done such a thing / thou my ghtest have
found some of more noblesse and worship in my court then when thou took
Guyscart. To whom I trow to yield the sorrow yt I have by his cause. For I
would yt thou know it that I shall make him to dye / and the same would I do
by the if I might destroy fro mine heart the love yt I have in ye more gretter
than ever fader had to his daughter / which tourneth me fro it / when Sysmonde
understood this thing and that her fader co^ de^pned him to death yt she loved
so much she was so sorrowful that she would feign dye yt hour / yet by right
stable courage and constaunte chere with out casting any teeres out of her eyes
/ though she was dysposed to live no longer she a^swered thus Fader sith that
it is so that fortune has made yt to be known which that I would so feign
have covered. I have no need to make no request of you / except if I wyste
to ask of you remyssyon and life to him that ye manace of death. I would bese
che you to take mine and leave his. For in that yt I ask you pardon / and ye
would do to him as ye say I would not ask it. For I will no longer live. For
of so much I make you certain that by his death ye shall sle me. But of this
thing that moves you to so great wrath against us / have ye not cause to take
it unto your own blame. For ye that be of fless he have not ye engendered a
daughter of fless he and not of stone nor of iron. And ye ought to think
though ye be old / what and how great is the heaviness of youth living in
delyces and at ease / and the pryckynges which are to pass. And sith that I
saw that ye thought never mary me again / and feeling me young and prycked
with lustynesse I fell to love this same gentylman and not without a cause / ne
without great delyberacyon I consented and accorded to mine heart that he
desired / yet or that I aduysed well the condycy ons of him parfyte in all
virtues more than any other of your court / and that ye may know your self
which have nourysshed him / and what other thing is noblesse but virtues /
for it comes not of fless he and blood which is but donge / so ye have not
cause to say that I have taken me to the leest noble of your court / and thus
ye have no cause of wrath toward us / your own blame co^sydered But at all
if ye will take so great punysshment of him for that trespace it perteyneth not
to be taken but it should be taken of wrong and of sin. But it is more right
yt I have it which styred him thereto / which thought that he ought to have
it. For certes it should have been to much in the heart of a vylayne to have
refused a lady of such parentage Ought ye then to employe this trespace all
upon him and not upon me. Then the prince departed from Sysmonde. But yet he
was not appeased to ward Guyscart / but in the morning made him to be slain
/ and commanded that the heart should be taken out of the body / the which
heart y^ fader put in a right rich cup of gold / and by a secremessagere
sent it unto his daughter / and he should say that he sent her that present
and to enjoy of that thing yt she loved most. The messagere came before
Sysmonde and made his present and said yt he was charged therewith. And she took
the cup and opened it / and anon she knew the adventure. But though she
had sorrow inestymable / she was not dysmayed of her high courage / but made
her answer to him in this wise without chau^gynge her chere saying. My friend
say to y^ prince that one thing perceive I well / that is this / yt to so
noble a heart he has given such a sepulture that perteyneth to him. For
other than gold and precious stones ought he not have. Tha^ she stouped over
the cup and kyssed the heart / in saying pyteously. Ha right sweet heart
herboure of all my pleasure. Cursed be the cruelte of that makes me to see the
in this plyte. ye were always present in mine heart / and the very eyes of my
thought. Now have thou passed the course of thy noble life by diverse fortunes
/ but yet thou have such asepul ture of thine enemy as thy worthynesse has
deserved / so it pertayneth well that I do mine office that thou be washed and
bayned with the teeres of her that thou loved so much / and thou shalt not
fail thereof / and with yt thy soul shall not be long without mine. For that
is no reason but yt I shall make ye company in short time / yet maulgre
fortune that has be to the so contrary / there is come to the so much of
well now that my cruel fader bath sent y^ to me to thentent yt thou be more
worshypped / and that I speak to the or that I dye and that my soul may se
thyn / of whom I desire the company above all thing / for I know well yt thy
spyryte desires mine / such words and others ynowe said Sysinonde so pyteous
that any person that hard it ought to have great pity of it. And so depely
she wept that it seemed y^ she had.ij. wells in her head yt ran without ceasynge
in to y^ cup without making noise or cry / but with allow voice kissing always
y^ heart. The ladys and gentylwomen y^ were about her had great marvel of
this thing / for they knew nothing of y^ aduenre / ne what was the cause of
y^ great sorrow. So they wept all for pytye / and payned them to reco^forte her
/ but it auayled not / and in vain they asked her most pryue women the cause
of her sorrow. And she overcome with meruayllous sorrow when she had wept enough
said. O right welbyloued heart I have done al mine ossyce that longed to y^
now there rests naught to do but to send my soul to make company with
thine. And with these words she lift her up and opened an almarye and took out
a box where she had put venymous herbs to dyssolue in water / to have it ready
when the cause happed. So she cast y^ water in to the cup where the heart was
and without any manner dread drank it all / and laid her done upon her bed
abydyn ge the death holding y^ cup always right stratly when y^ women saw her
body change by signs of death / sorowynge meruayllously cursed y^ fader
which was gone a little while to dysporte him. And than he came at the hour
that the venym by began to stretche about in the veins / and he full of sorrow
of ye case yt was happed repenting him of yt he had done / bygan to speak to
her by sweet worcester des trowyng to have reco^forted her making gre te sorrow /
and his daughter a^swered hy^ Cancre reser ue thy teeres till a another time /
for here is no need of the^ and I desire the^ not / you resemblest ye mad man yt
slew a man and after wept tor it / had it not be better yt you had let thy
douzter live at plesau^ce secretly loving a man tha^ to se her hard death by thy
cruelte to thy great sorrow. The which death shall make that thing that was
secret to appear openly / and then she might speak no more for her heart brake
/ holding the cup right straytely in her hands And anon after her ye fader
dyed for sorrow. And thus ended Sysmonde the daughter of the prince of Salerne
/

Of Lyzabeth and of other lovers. Ca. lix.
ALso Bocace tells in the saydbooke of Cent Nouuelles that in the cite of
Messyne in Italy there was a young woman named Lyzabeth / ye which iij.
brethren of hers by their coueytousnes tarried her of maryenge. And they had a
factoure and a gouernoure of all their busynesses right fair and a goodly
young man which that their fader had nourysshed all his youth. It happened by
the contynuell frequentacyon yt they had between them they loved each other,
and this love continued a while right Ioyously. But at the last as these
brethren perceived as they that would not make great noise for dyshonourynge
of their sister were aduysed to sle him. And in deed they led this young man
which was named Laurence with them unto a manner of thieves / and when they
were come thither they had him in to a gardyne and slew him / and buried him
among the trees. And they came home again to their house made them to believe
yt they had sent this Laurence far in to another cou^re in their message.
Lyzabeth which loved Laurence of so gre te love was nothing at hertes ease
because she had lost ye presence of her love and her heart gave her straungely
of this matter so much yt in a time co^ strayned of right love might not
suffer no longer but yt she a^ked of one other brethren where yt Laurence was
and why he tarried so long. By y^ which her brother answered her right tyersly
and said / what perteyneth it to ye to know / and then Ly zabeth perceived
certainly y^ they had slain lau rence / for ye which she made meruaylous
sorrow when she was alone / and she wept all y^ night right depely without
taking any manner of rest in co^playnynge him yt she loved so much / and there
with she became right syke / for ye which sykenesse she required her brethren
yt they would let her go to dysporte her at their manner without the Cite a little
while / and when they had granted her she went thither / and she to whom her
heart gave all this ad uenture went alone in to ye gardyne where this Laurence
lay deed / and lokynge all about she saw where ye body was buried by the
raysynge of the new earth / and then she dygged ye earth with a pycoys yt she
found there so much till she found y^ body Then embrasynge ye body by great
dystresse made sorrow out of measure. But for so much that she knew that she
might not be long there for fere she should be perceived / took ye body out of
ye earth and took the heed of her love yt her brethren had smyten of / and
knytted it in a couerchefe and buried it in one of her great pottes whereon they
use to set herbs and plants and an herb above it sweet ly smelling yt is
called Basylycon. And with this pot she turned home to her house again but
she had this pot in so great cherete yt she could not part from it but put
it in one of her chamber wyndowes in the air. And she watered it with none
other water but with the teeres of her eyes night and day. And this thing
endured no little while as some of these men say women forgeteth lightly / but
it seemed yt her sorrow increased from day to day / and thus was the Basylycon
waxen fair and great for the fatness of the earth / and to tell shortly so
much she led this life upon ye pot / yt it happened yt some of her
neighbors perceived how she wept without ceasing at this wyndowe upon the
pot / and told to her bre therne the marvel of her sorrow. So they were
gretely abashed what it might be. And by ny ght stale away the pot whereof
in the mornyn ge there began to spring a new noyaunce when she found not her
pot / and for all grace she requy red yt she might have her pot again and
she wol de quyte it them though she should give her par te of all her other
goods / and said pyteously in complaining. Alas in what hour brought my
mother me forth in to this world with my cruel brethren y^ which hates my
simple pleasau^ce / that they will not leave me a little poor pot of
Basylycon which cost them naught nor yield it me again / and I ask them
nothing else for my marriage / and for my dowry. Alas it is not great ye I
desire of them / and thus she let it pass / but her soro we never seized so
much yt she laid her on a bed and was sore syke. In the which sykenesse what
so ever one offered her she set not by it ne by no Joy in ye world but only
her pot / and thus she dyed pyteously. And I think not yt this thing is a
le sing for there they made a song of ye complaynte of this geney^woma^ and
of her pot which they sing yet. what shall I tell ye more I should hold ye
to long if I told ye the hystoryes of women in such manner of love taken /
which have loved of right great love. Of another also tells Boca ce of whom
ye housbande made to eat ye heart of her love / which never ete after. The
same did ye lady of Fayllee which loved the Chastelayne of Coussy by to great
love. Also I soude Trystram. Tyamere which loved Hercules so much yt she
slew herself when he was deed. So it is no dou bte y^ there is right great
love in a co^staunte woman where she sets her heart though it be so yt
there be some women light. But these pyteous ensamples and ynowe of others yt I
might tell the ought not to be ye cause to move y^ courage of women to put
them in this peryllous see and dampnable of lewd love. For always the end
thereof is to them great preiudyce in grefe of body and goods / or dyshonoure
in y^ soul which is most. So they shalldo as wise women which by good wit
can eschew and not to give audyence to the^ which with out ceasing trauaylleth
the^ to deceive them in such case.

Of Juno and of other diverse ladies of renown. Ca. lx.
Now I have told y^ of great foyson of ladies of the which y^ hystoryes
makes mencyon / but for to say of all the process should be infynyte the
which I have not taken in hand / and it suttyseth me without more that I
bring forth some in wytnessynge to say the contrary to that y^ thou have
purposed that diverse men say. I will tell the in conclusyon of some that has been in y^ world gretely praised by diverse accyde^tes more tha^ by great
virtues. Juno daughter of Sa turnus and of Opys after the sayenges of poets
and y^ error of paynymes was gretely praised abo ue all other women of yt
law more for her good fortune than for any other excellence. She was sister of
Iupyter and married unto him whom they called sovereign god / and for the great
richesse and fortune in which she lived and habounded with her housbande was
reputed as goddess of richesse. And those mad people byleued y^ for her
stature that she had after her death that they were the better fortuned / and
they granted to her also y^ comfort of y^ ryghtes of marriage / and by her
help the women recovered in praynge to her / and they made temples of her all
about / awters / priests / plays and sacrefyses / and thus was she long
worship ped of the greeks and of them of Cartage / and with that she was
brought to Rome after and put in y^ Capytole in the Celle of Iupyter her
housbande. And there she was worshypped of Romans y^ were lords of the
world with many diverse cerymonyes by long time. Also Europe yt was daughter
of Agenor king of Phenyce was also gretely praised for that / that Iupyter
which loved her named the third part of y^ world after her name. And it is
to know that of the names of diverse women has been diverse lands / Cytees and
towns named so / as England of a woman that was called Angle / and so of
others.

Iocasta queen of Thebes was praised for her great infortune / for by
mysaduenture she had wed ded her own sone after that / yt she had slain his
own fader whereof none of them both knew. And she saw that he dyspayred
when he knew y^ adventure and after saw him slain between two sons yt she
had. Also Meduse or Bargon was praised for her great beauty / she was daughter
of the rich king Porce of whom y^ Royalme was right haboundauntly closed with
y^ see. This Me duse as the ancient hystoryes says was of so meruayllous
beauty that not only she passed all other women / but that is a meruayllous
thing and above nature. She had her countenance so pleasant with her beauty
of body and of vysage and of her yelowe heeres as long thredes of gold and
cryspe that she drew every mortal creature yt she beheld to her / so that
she was unmouable to all people. And therefore the fable fayneth that she became
a stone. Helayne wife of Menelans / king of Lacedemoyne daughter of Tyndarus
king of Ceballe / and of Leyda his wife was gretely renowned for her great
beauty. And for that that it happened for because of the rauyss hynge that
Paris made of her which was y^ cause by the which Troy was destroyed of this
queen / though it be said of the beauty of others / the hystoryes affermeth
that she was the fairest woman that ever was borne of mother. And therefore these
Poets say that she was engendered of Iupyter the great god. Also Polexene that
was the meke daughter of king Pryamus was also as fair a maid as is made
mencyon in any hystore / and with y^ she was right stable and constaunte of
courage as she showed in receyuynge the death without vysege or ^here when she
was heeded upon the tomb of Achylles / then she said that it was more agreeable
to her to dye than to be led in seruage. Of others ynowe I might tell y^ whi
che that I leave for shortenesse.

Here speaks Xp^ine / and ryghtwysnesse answe reth against them that women
draw me^ to them by their gayness. Ca. lxj.
IXp^ine said thus Madame truly to y^ purpose above said. The peryllous life
of folly love to that y^ I se / truly it ought to be eschewed of women that
have any understanding in so much that it is to them so preiudyable. But
there is great blame given to them that delight them to be gay in their array
and clothing / and some say that they do it for to draw these me^ to their
love. Answer. Dear love I shall not excuse them that be curyous and quaynte of
their array For without fail that vice and not little ne no quayntenesse out of
estate that perteyneth to every person to bear is not without blame by y^ whi
che not to excuse the evil / but to the entente that none charge them to give
greter blame / ne other that it affermeth not of such women yt one sees
fresshe and gaye. I say to the certaynely that it co meth not to all women
because of love that they do so / but it comes to many as well men as women by
right good condycyon and natural inclynacyon that they delight them in
fresshenesse / and in fair habytes and rich / in clennesse / and in
profitable things. And if it come to them by kind it were herd to them to
eschew it how be it that it should be the more virtuous. It is not written of
the Appostle saint Barthylme we the which was a right great gentle man / that
notwithstanding that our sauyoure christ Ihesu preched and teched strongly of
pouerte and lymplenesse in all manner of things / yet the blessed apostle all
his life ware clothes of sylke frenged about with gold and precious stones /
and it co meth to him of kind to be rychely arrayed y^ which is comunely a
curyous thing and full of pride / and yet he sinned not. And some will say
that for that cause our lord suffered that for his martyr dome he left his
skin / and was slain. And the se things that I tell the for to show that
no man ought to Judge another of conscience for his haby te / ne for his array.
For it perteyneth only to god to be Judge of all creatures / and upon that I
shall tell the some ensamples.

Of Claudyne a woman of Rome. Ca. lxij.
ALso Bocace and Ualere tells y^ Clau dyne which was a noble lady of Rome
delyted gretely in fayr^ clothynges and delycate. And for that yt she was
modelycatyfe than the other ladies of Rome / some presumed shrewdely against her
/ and against her chastyte to y^ preiudyce of her good name. So it happened in
the.xv. year of the second battle of Aufryke. That the image of Pyssemonde
mother of ye gods after opinion had been borne fro Rome there were assembled
all the noble ladies of Rome to go mete with the image which was put in a ship
upon Tybre / but y^ maryners might not aryue at the port for all their
strength. Then Claudyne which knew well yt she was mysbylened of wrong for
her fresshnesse she kneled before the image and made her prayer all on high in
saying to the goddess / that as truly as that she knew that her chastyte
was hole and not cor rupte that she would give her grace that she alone might
draw the ship to the haven. And then trusting to her clennesse took her
gyrdell and boun de it to the stern of the ship / and atter drew the ship to
the ryuayle as lightly as though all the maryners of the world had been there.
And then every body meruaylled thereof. I have not told y^ this ensample for
the thing that I wene that y^ image that they as foles and myscreauntes call a
goddess yt had might to lift up the prayer of Claudyne but I have told it
the for to show the that she that was so gaye left not for so much to be
chaste and by that she showed that she had that the truth of her chastyte was
so courable to her the which helped her and not the goddess.

How they lie not upon some women for so mo che though they delight them in
fair clothing and array. Ca. lxiij.
ANd those women that would be byloued pain them for y^ cause to be gaye nyce
and curyous. I shall prove the yt encheson makes them not the sooner / ne the
better to be loved of wise men and of worship / and more sooner and better ben
these virtuous women honest and simple loved of them that love worship than the
most Iolyest and fairest. So one might answer me thus / sith that women draw
these men to them by their virtue and honest. It were better that there were
fewer good women / but y^ reason should be naught worth. For the good and
profitable things ought not to be left to be told and to increase for that
though the foles abuse them and every man ought to do his deuoyre as well
doing though it fortune the contrary. And yt it is so that many women ben
loved for their virtues and honest. I shall show the ensamples first of
diverse sayn tes of paradyse I might tell the that were couey ted of men for
their honest. Lucresse of whom I spoke here above which was rauysshed / the
great honest of her was cause that Tarquyne lo ued her more than her beauty.
For as her house ba^ de was ones at a soupere there as this Tarquyne was which
rauysshed her after and diverse other knights with them they began to speak of
their wives / and every man said that his was best. But to know ye truth and
to prove which o^ their wives was most worthy to be praised every man went
to horse back and went to their houses. And though yt they found occupied
in the most honest offices and the work were y^ mo^e of reputacyon whereof it
fortuned yt Lucresse among all the other was found y^ most honestly occupied
as right a wise and a good woman clothed in a simple gown among her maidens
and her women werkyngein wulles and speaking of ver tuous things / and thither
came y^ said Tarquyne sone of y^ king with her house bade which behol dynge
her great honest / her simple countenance and her still manner was so amerous
of her yt it cau ^ed hy^ to do the folly that he did after.

Of queen Blaunche mother of saint Jews and o^ other good women loved for their
virtues. Capitulo.lxiiij.
THe same wise was loved for her gre te understanding / wisdom / virtue and
bounte / the right noble queen Blau^che mother of saint Jews of y^ earl of
Cha^payne not^standynge she had passed ye flower of her youth. But this no ble
earl herynge y^ queen speak to him with so wise words when he had begone to war
against y^ said said saint Jews and the good lady spoke to him of it saying
that he ought not to do so co^ syderynge the welthes that her sone had done to
him / the earl beheld her by great intent meruay lynge him of the great
goodness and virtue of her by ye which he was so strongely undertaken with her
love yt he wist not what to say nor do / ne durst never war against him after.
For he knew well y^ there was so much welthe in her and of virtue also yt he
could never do otherwise but accord with him and her. So he suffered fro that
hour for the many troubles by lewd desires that constrained him / yet she
answered him by the same. And then when she doubted not that he should never
make war to the king but would be all his / and that she was incertayne that
heart and body and all yt ever he had was submytted to her commandment / so
she loved him all his life after. And he left not for a little wanhope that he
might come to her love. So he made his lovely complayntes in dyttyes praysynge
gretely his lady. The which goodly dyttyes that he made he put them to a
musyeyen to set them in to song right delectably And in his halle at Prouynce
and also at Troyes he made write them and yet they appear in many places. And
thus might I tell the of many other And I Xp^ine answered Madame to your
purpose in like case I have seen by experyence. For I know many virtuous women
that by that they have confessed them to me in complaining them to me of the
pleasaunce that they took there they have been more required sith y^ time y^
their great beauty and youth has been past* than they were in their great
f^oure whereof they said. Alas what will ye that I say to these men seeing in me
any countenance of folly by y^ which they have color and cause to think
that he was of accord to do so great folly. And I perceive now open ly by that
y^ ye say that the great welthe of them has been cause to make them to love.
And it is well contrary to y^ opyupon of diverse folk yt say that a good woman
that would be chaste shall ne uer be that woman that list to be coueyted nor re
quyred.

Xp^ine asks and right wysnes answers against them that say that women by
nature ben scarce. Capitulo.lxv.
REplye you I can no more mine own lady / For my questyons ben well assoyled.
And it seems me that ye ha ue enough proved false the evil say enges yt so
many men say upon women. And also among other vices of women they say yt
Auaryce is a natural thing in them / but it appears not so to me by that
that ye say. An swear. Dear daughter I tell the certainly yt Auaryce is no
more natural in women than in men / and if there be less god knows it. And
that thou may se by that that by y^ couetysenesse of diverse men there is
much more harm done to the worl de than by the little couetysenesse of women.
But as I have said to the before that y^ fool knows better the little
trespace in his neighbor than he does the great crime of himself. And by
that that one sethe often times y^ women delight them in loving to spynne and
card such thyngesme^ call couetyse. But I promise the yt there ben great
foyson of them that if they had whereof they would not be scarce ne couetouse as
of that yt should be to their worship. But poor men hold comunely their wynes
so strayte yt they must needs keep that they have / for they wot well it were
no light thing to have more. And so there ben some people yt calls women
scarce / for yt they have ma ryed full large wastours of their goods / and the
poor women yt knew well yt their housbandes have spended lewdely that yt
should find their household and that they and their children dare not compare
chere and may not hold them to speak to their housbandes and to counsel
them of less de spence. So such things is no coueytyse ne scar senesse but
it is a sign of right great prudence / and such debates one may se often
times in maryages by that yt such counsayllynge pleases not to the men / and
by yt they give blame to the women of yt they ought to praise them of. But yt
it be true that this vice of Auaryce be not in them so as some will say / It
appears to alms that with ry ght good will they do daily / and god knows
it how many prisoners in the land of y^ sara^yns how many nedy gentylmen and
others have been and ben all days low in the world comforted and socoured by
women and by their goods. The Ladies of Rome were not scarce when in the ty me
that y^ Cite was gretely grieved with war / by the which all y^ comune
treasoure of y^ town was wasted and spended on men of arms whereof it was
great sorrow to y^ Romans to find the way to have silver to put forth an
army which was of force right necessary for them. But the la dies by their
own fre will and also the wydowes assembled them and brought all their
Iewelles and all that they had without sparynge any thing to y^ princes of Rome
/ and freely took it them of y^ whi che thing the ladies were gretely praised
/ and afterward all their Iewelles and goods were yielded to them again and
of good right. For they were the cause of y^ recouerynge of Rome.

Of the rich lady and lyberall named Buyse. Capitulo.lxvj.
OF the lyberalyte of women also it is written in the deeds of y^ Romans of y^
worshypfull rich woman Buyse or Paulyne which was in y^ land of Puyl le in
the time yt Hanyball gre ued so much the Romans by fire and yren / yt he
despoyled almost all Italy of men and of goods It happened yt of y^ great
dyscomfyture of Canes whereof Hanyball had so noble a vyctorye / many Romans
fled y^ escaped from the battle wou^ ded and hurt. But this worshypfull lady
Buyse received all them that she might have anon to the nombre of.x. thousand
and gadered them in to her houses / for she was of great richesse. So she made
them to be heled at her cost and charge / and socoured them all with her goods
so much y^ by the help and comfort y^ she did to themthey might turn
again to Rome and set up their arms again of the which thing she was right
gretely praised. So doubt ye not dear friend that of infynyte women / large
curtoys / and ly / berall I might tell the enough. And also with out seeking
more ferther the hystoryes as well of other largess of ladies I might tell the
enough Ne was not the lyberalyte great of the noble lady de la ryuere named
Margarete which is yet on live / and was sometime wife of the lord Burell
lord de la ryuere / and first chambrelayne of the wise king Charles. This
lady as she yt was always / wise / worshypfull and well manered. It happened in
a time among others / yt she being at a great feast where there was great
foyson of noble ladies and of knights and of gentylmen in great apparayle.
Then this noble lady which was fair and young as she beheld y^ noble
cheualry that was there thought that there was no che re among others right a
notable knight and of great worship in his living that was called sir Emenyon
de Pomyners. This lady left not for so much yt he was a goodly man to have
remem braunce of him because of his worthynesse and bounte / her thought y^
more fayrer array might not be in a company than notable men and of good fame
though that they were old. So she asked gretely where this sir Emenyon was y^
he was not at that assemble. So it was told her that he was in prison in the
castle of Paris for five hon dred frankes in which he was bound for a vyage
that he did in arms as he did often times. Ha said the noble lady what shame
is this to ye realm to suffer such a man to be an hour in prison for debt.
And than she took the chapellet of gold that she had upon her head / right
rich and fair / and put upon her instead of that a chapellet of per uencle /
and so she took it to a certain messagere and said. Go and put this chapellet
in plegge for that he owes / and that he be delivered anoue and come heder /
the which thing was done of the whi che she was gretely praised.

Of pryncesses and of ladies of France. Ca. lxvij.
ANd I Xp^ine said thus. Madame sithe that ye have remembered this lady that is
in my time and are entered to the same pourse of ladies of France a bydynge in
that country. I pray you that it please you to say some what of them that ye
seem ought to be said / and yfye think yt it be good that they may be
harbored in our cite. For when refore ought they to be forgotten as though
they were strangers. Answer. Xp^ine I answer the certaynely that I se many
of the^ right virtuous / and it pleases me well y^ they be of our cytezeynes
And first of all shall not be refused / there the noble queen of France
Isabell debauere / now by the grace of god reygnynge in whom there was never
found no cruelte nor extorcyon ne none evil vice but always in good love and
benygnyte to her subjects. Ne ought not gretely to be praised y^ fair young /
good and wise duchess of Berry wife of duke John^ late sone of king John^ of
France and brother of y^ wise king Charles / y^ which noble duchess bare
herself so wisely and chaste in the flower of her youth y^ all y^ world
praised her of great virtue. what should I say to y^ of y^ duchess of
Orlyaunce wife of Jews sone of Charles y^ wise king of France late daughter
of ye duke of Myllayne / of which prudent lady ye might tell y^ strong and
constau^te courage of great love to her lord / aduysed in governance / Just
to every man and wise of her behauoure. what is there to say of y^ duchess of
Burgoyne wife of duke John^ sone of Phylyp / late sone of king John^ of
France / was she not right virtuous true to her lord benygne in heart / and
in her countenance / good in co^ dycyons and without any vice. The countess
of Cleremount daughter of y^ duke of Berry above said of his first wife and

performed / and what noble ladies were chosen to enhabyte the high palace and
ye high dongeons.


The first chapter tells how Justice led the queen of heaven to enhabyte
and lordeshyp in the Cite of ladies. Capitulo. Primo.
ANd then my lady Justice drew her toward me in her high manner and said
thus. Xp^ine to say y^ right way It seems me well y^ after thy possybylyte
with the help of my systers so that thou have known to put in work thou have
wrought well and fair in the building of the Cite of Ladies. And from hense
forth it is time y^ I entremete me of the surpluse so as I have promised the.
That is to know to bring thither and lodge the most excellent and blessed que
ne among all women with her noble company so that the cite may be
lordeshypped and governed by her / and enhabyted with a great multitude of
noble ladies of her court and of her me^ny For I se the palace and the high
mansyons ready and arrayed / and all the streets covered to recey ue her and her
right honorable and excellent rowte and assemble. Now come on then ye pryn
cesses / ladies / and all women before / to receive this lady with great
worship and reverence. which is not only your queen / but she which has
domynacyon and lordeshyp above al puysaunce after here only sone that she bare
and con ceyued of the holy ghost / and which is y^ sone of god the fader. But
it is good reason yt this most high and excellent pryncesse be mekely prayed
by y^ assemble of all ladies and women yt it please her of her great makenesse
to dwell here allow among them in their Cite and congregacyon without having
them in dysdayne for the regard of her highness toward their lytelnesse. But
it needs not to doubt yt her meekness which passes all others and her
benygnyte more than aungelyke ne will not suffer her to make refuge to dwell
and enhabyte in ye Cite of ladies above all other women in ye palace yt my
sister ryghwysnesse has ordained for her which is all made of glory and of
praysynge. Now come on then al women with me and say we thus here. we salute y^
with y^ same sa lutacyo^ yt the angel brought to y^ / y^ which y^ have most
agreeable above al other salutacyo^s saying to ye. (Aue Maria). All y^ devout
kind of women beseech the mekely yt thou abhor not to dwell among them by
grace and pity as their defenderesse / and protectryce / and keperayenst all ye
assaults of y^ enemies and of the world / and yt they may drink of y^ well
of virtues yt flows fro ye / and to be refresshed / so yt sin and all vice
be to them abhomy nable. Now then come on our heavenly queen / te^ ple of god /
selle and cloystre of ye holy ghost / habytacle of y^ Trynyte / Joy of
aungelles / Sterre and redress of them yt ben out of y^ right way / hope of al
true byleuynge people. O blessed lady what is he so outragyous yt ever dare
thy^ke or put out of his mouth yt the femenyne kind is foul considered thy
dygnyte / for though all the doings of women were evil / so passes and
surmounteth y^ light of thy goodness all the evil yt may be. And when god
would chose his spouse in thiskynde for thine honor right excellent lady. All
men ought to be ware / not only to blame women but to have the^ in great
reverence. The answer of the blessed queen is thus Justice y^ right welbyloued
of my sone / with right good will I shall dwell and abide among my systers and
friends the women. For reason / right wysnesse / and thyselfe would that I did
so / and nature enclyneth me thereto / for they serve me / praise me / and
worship me without sea sing. So I am and shall be evermore the heed of the
kind of women. For this thing was ever in the thought of god the fader
preparate / and ordained in the counsel of y^ Trynyte Then answered Justice
with all the women / Lady thankynges / and praysynges be given to the by the in
fynyte worlds. Now lady save us / and pray for us to thy sone which nothing
the refuses.

Of the Systers of our Lady and of Mary Magdaleyne. Ca. secundo.
Now y^ Empress is lodged with us whether the evil saying Ianglers will or
no. And now ought y^ blessed systers to put in / and saint Mary Mag daleyne
with them / which made her company without leuynge her in the time of the
passion of her sone right nyghe the cross. O the great faith of women and
great love which never left y^ sone of god quycke nor deed when he was
abandonned and forsaken of his apostles / and it ap pered well yt god reproved
not the love of women as it were a frail thing as some men will say when he
put so great love in the heart of y^ blessed Mary Magdaleyne and of other
ladies as it appe red and that it proved so much.

Of saint Katheryne the holy vyrgyne. Ca. iij.
TO make company with y^ vyrgyne queen of heaven / and pryncesse of y^ Cite of
Ladies / we must lodge with her the blessed vyrgynes and holy ladies in showing
how god has proved the kind of women / by that that the same wise that he
given unto men he has given unto women for to understand in their young and
tender age for to be constaunte and strong in sufferynge horrible martyrdomes
for y^ holy law / the which ben crowned in glory of whom the fair lyuesben
of good ensample to here to every every woman above all othher wisdom / and
there fore they shall be y^ superlatyue degree of our Cite And first as a right
excellent y^ blessed Katheryn which was daughter of king Costs of Alexa^dre.
This blessed vyrgyn was left to be heir of her fader in the age of.xviij.
years / and notably she governed her and her heritage / she was a cryste^ woe
man and all given to god refusing all other marya ges. It happened that in to
the cite of Alexandre was come y^ Emperor Maxencyus the which on a day of
great solempnyte of his gods had made to array great appareyle to make
solemn sacryfyse. Katheryne being in her palace herd the noise of beestes
yt were arrayed to do sacryfyse and great noise of instruments / and as she had
sent to know what it was. And it was reported to her that ye Emperor was in
the temple to do sacrefyse anon she went and began to correct y^ Em peroure
of yt error by many wise words / and as she was a great clerk and had
learned scyences began to prove by good reasons of Phylosophye yt there was but
one god maker of all things / and yt he ought to be worshypped and none other.
when yt Emperor herd this maiden which was so no ble and of so great
auctoryte thus speak / and which yt was so fair was all admeruaylled and
wyste not what to say but intended to behold her / so he sen te al about to
seek phylosophres in all ye land of egypt / so there came before him.l.
phylosophres which held the^ right evil content when they knew the cause
wherefore they were brought thy der. And said that little wit had moved them
to travail from so far coutrees for to dyspute with a maiden / and to tell
shortly when y^ day of their dysputac yon was come / the blessed Katheryne
led them for the so with arguments / that they were all overcome and could
not assoyle her questyons for y^ which y^ Emperor was pas sing wroth with
them / but all that aduayled no thing. For by the grace of god and by the holy
worcester des of the vyrgyne they were all converted and confessed the name of Ihesu
Christ / for the which despyte the Emperor made them all to be burnt and the
holy maiden conforted them in their martyrdom / and assured them to be
received in perpetual glory and prayed god that he would keep them in the
very faith. And so by her they were put in y^ nombre of the blessed martyrs.
And such a miracle god showed in them y^ the fire never hurt their bodies ne
their clothes but that they bode al hole after the fire was done without losing
of any here of their heedes / but it seemed that all were on live The tyraunte
Maxencyus which gretely coueyted the holy vyrgyne katheryne for her beauty
began to flatter her y^ she should turn to his will / But when he saw that
it aduayled nothing he turned him to his manasynges and then to tour mented
and made her to be beten cruelly and after to put her in prison without
vysytynge of any per sone y^ space of.xij. days without mete or drink
trowynge to have made her dye for hongre. But the aungelles of our lord were
with her which comforted her and after the.xij. days she was brou ght before
the Emperor / and he saw her more fresshe and hole than she was before / and
trowed that she had been vysyted. So he commanded the kepers of the prison to
be tourmented / but Kathe ryne which had pity on them affermed that she had no
comfort save only from heaven. The Em peroure wist not what hard tourmentes
he my ght make to tourment her. And by the counsel of his prouoste he let
make wheles full of rasoures which turned one against another / and what
someuer was in the mids was al cut of / and between these wheles he made
put saint Katheryne all naked which always worshypped god with Joined hands.
Then the aungelles of god came and defended her / which brake the wheles with
so great strength that all the tourmentoures were slain with them. And when
the Empe roures wife understood these meruaylles y^ god made for saint
Katheryne she was converted / and blamed the Emperor of that that he did /
and then she went and vysyted the holy vyrgyne in the prison and prayed her
that she would pray to god for her. For the which despyte y^ Emperor made to
tourmente his wife and to draw of her pappes / and the vyrgyne said to her.
Doubt ye not y^ tourmentes noble queen for this day thou shalt be received
in the Joy without end. And then the Emperor made his wife to be heeded and
a great multitude of people that were converted. The Emperor required
Katheryn that she would be his wife / and when he saw that she was refusing
to all his petycyons went and gave his sentence that she should b^ heeded. And
she made her prayer praynge for all them that had re membraunce on her passion
/ and for them that called her name in their trybulacyons that god might be
their help and socoure. A voice came fro heaven which said yt her prayer was
herd. So she made an end of her martyrdom and instead of blood there ran
milk out of her body. And y^ aungelles took her holy body and bare it to ye
moun te Synay which is.xx. days Journey fro thens And there they buried her /
at the which tomb god has done many miracles which I let pass for
shortenesse. And of the same tomb there renneth oil which heleth many syke
men and god anon after punysshed the Emperor right hor rybly.

Of saint Margarete. Ca. iiij.
WE shall not forgete also ye blessed vyr gyne saint Margarete of whom y^
Legende is known full well how she was borne in Antyoche of noble kynrede /
introducte in y^ faith when she was young of her nouryse / of whom right
humbly she went every day to keep the sheep / whereof it happened y^ Olybryus
which was steward with the Emperor saw her in going by and coueyted her.
So he sent to fetch her / and for that that she would not consent to his
will / and that she told him that she was a christian woman / he made her to be
strongly tourmented / beten and prysoned in the which prison for that y^ she
felt her tempted she required that she might se him vysybly that so much
evil pourchased her. And then came an horrible serpente which gretely made
her aferde and swalowed her. But she made the sign of the cross and anon the
ser pente brake / and after she saw at a corner of the prison a black figure
as of a man of Ethyope / And then Margarete went boldly and coniured him /
and he couched under her feet / and she set her feet upon his throat / and
he cried with an high voice / mercy. The prison fulfilled with clerenesse
Margarete was comforted of the aun gelles / and then she was tourmented again
before the Judge / the which when he saw that all his ammonycyons aduayled him
not / made her to be tourmented more than she was before. But the aungelles of
god came and brake all the tour mentes / and the vyrgyne lepte away from it
all hole / and there was great foyson of people converted. And when the false
tyraunte saw that he ordained y^ she was heeded. But she made her oryson
first / and prayed unto almighty god for all them that remembered her passion
/ and all they that prayed unto her in their trybulacyens / and for women great
with child that almighty god would grauute unto them their petycyon. And ye
angel of god came and told her that her prayers were herd and that she
should go in the name of god to receive the palm of the vyctory / and then she
stretched forth her neck and was heeded / and the aungelles bare her soul to
heaven. This false Olybryus also made to tourmente the holy vyrgyne named Regyne
/ which was right yon ge of the age of.xv. years for that that she would not
accord to him / and she converted much peo ple with her holy prechynge.

Of the holy vyrgyne saint Luce. Ca. v.
THe biessyd saint Luce which was borne in Rome ought not to be forgeten in
our letanye / ye which was rauysshed of ye king Aceya of Barbary. And when he
was in his co^n tree he trowed to have defouled her. Then she by the virtue of
god began so to preche unto him yt he meruaylled of her wit and left her and
said yt she was a goddess and held her in great worship and reverence in his
palace. And right reverent ly he establysshed her dwelling for her and her
meyny / and ordained that no man should repair thither to hurt her or trouble
her. And she without ceasing was in fastings and in orysons and led right
an holy life prayenge for her host* yt it might please god to enlumyne him
with the ly ght of his holy faith / and her host asked counsel of her in
all his doings / and he took it well what so ever she counsayled him / when he
went to the werre he prayed her that she would pray to her god for him / and
she blessed him / and he ca me again as ouercomer of his enemies / wherefore he
would worship her as a goddess and would have made to build a temple for her
but she said that he should beware thereof and that there was not but one god /
and that she was a simple sinner and thus she was by the space of.xx. years
persevering in holy life. So she had it by reuelacyon of our lord that she
should return to Rome / and there she should accomplysshe the term of her
life by martyrdom / and she told it to the king whi che was right full of
sorrow for it / and answered her and said. Alas if thou part from me / mine
enemies will assail me / and I shall lose my good fortune when I shall not
have the. And she said to him / thou king come with me / and leave thine
erthely royalme / for thou art chosen to posses a more noble kingdom which
is without end And he anon left all that he had and went with the holy
vyrgyne not as a lord but as a seruau^te And when they were come to rome / and
she was known that she was a christian woman / she was taken and brought to her
martyrdom. Of the which thing the king Aeeya was right sorrowful and ran
about and would have revenged her after his power / if the holy vyrgyne had
not bydden him the contrary / so he wept tenderly and cried that they were
cursed people to do so much evil to the holy vyrgyne of god. And when it came
that one should smite of the heed of yt blessed vyrgyne / ye king went to
put his heed by hers / cryenge I am a christian man / and I offer mine heed to
Ihesu Christ god and maker of all thing whom that holy Luce worshyppeth. And
so they were both heeded together and crowned in glory / and xij. other with
them that were converted by the holy vyrgyne saint Luce whereof the feast of
them is hallowed together in the.vij. kalenders of Iule

Of ye blessed vyrgyne saint Martyne. Ca. vj.
THe blessed vyrgyne Martyne may not be forgoten. This blessed maid was borne
in Rome of right noble kynred. The Emperor would constrayne her to be his
wife bycau se of her beauty / and she answered I am a christian woman offered to
god alive which delyteth him in chaste bodies and in clean heart / and to him
I do sacrefyse and commend me. And for despyte of these words the Emperor
made her to be led to the temple to constrayne her to worship the ydolles /
and she kneled down and her eyes toward heaven / lyftynge up her Joined hands
made her orysons to god / and anon the ydolles fell down all to torn / the
temple brake / and the prestes of the temple of ydolles were slain / and the
devil that was in the ydoll cried and confessed that the holy vyrgyne Martyne
was the very servant of god. The tyraunte Emperor for to revenge his gods
made her to be cruelly tourmented / in the which god appeared to her and
comforted her / and she prayed for them yt tourmented her somoche that they
were converted by her merytes / and great foyson of people also. Of ye which
thing the Emperor was worse dysposed than before and made her to be
tourmented more and more of diverse tourmentynges and cruel But those that
tourmented her thought verily yt they saw god and his saints before her / and
they asked mercy of her and were converted. And so as she was in oryson
prayenge for them a light came round about them / and a voice was herd from
heaven that said I spare you for the love of my right welbyloued Martyne. And
then the provost cried to them for that they were converted and said. O fools
ye are deceived by this en chauntresse Martyne. And they answered without
dread. Nay thou art deceived by the dyuyll yt dwells within the / for thou
know not him that made the. And the Emperor wroth out of measure
commanded them to be hanged / and their flesh to be al to torn / and they
receyuynge martyr dome Joyfully praised god. And the Emperor again made
martyne to be dispoyled al naked and her flesh white as lylye yt made them
abashed for her great beauty / and when the Emperor which coueyted her had
long time counsayled her / and saw that she would not obaye / made her to be
cut al about / and out of her wounds there came milk for blood / and
yielded great swetnesse and yet he wood on her made to stretche her abroad and
raced her with hokes and brake all the bo die so much that they that tourmented
her were al weary and god kept her that she should not dye so soon / to the
entente that the tourmentoures might have cause to be converted the which
began to cry Emperor we will do no more / for the aungelles beteth us with
chains. And then there came new tormentoures to tourment her and anon they
were deed / and the Emperor co^ fused wyste not what to do / but made her to
be stretched to brenne her with brennynge gr^es / and always she gloryfyed our
lord / and there came out of her mouth right great swetnesse / and when the
tyrauntes had tourmented her so much that they were ashamed they cast her in a
derke prison And Emenyon the cosyn of the Emperor wen te to look in to the
prison / and he saw Martyne enuyronned with aungelles set in a trone right
well arrayed and there was great clerenesse with many diverse songs right
melodyous / and she held a table of gold in y^ which there was wry ten. My
lord sweet Ihesu christ so much by thy works praised in thy blessed saints
Emenyon gretely admeruayled of this thing went to tell it to the Emperor
which answered yt he was deceived by her enchau^tementes / in ye morning the
tyrant made her to be taken out of prison / and every body meruaylled of that
yt she was all hole thrughe which many was converted. At the last he made her
to be led to the tymple to constrayne her to do sacrefyse to the false
gods. Then y^ devil began to braye and said / alas alas I am confounded /
and the holy vyrgyne commanded him to come out and that he should show him in
his own lewd likeness / and anon there came a great thondre with lyghtnynge
/ that came from heaven and brake the ydoll and burnt ye priests. And then the
Emperor was wood with her and made her to be stretched abroad and raced all
y^ flesh of her body with combs of iron / and she always worshypped god / and
when he saw that she dyed not he made her to be put to wild beestes to be
devoured and a great lion that had not eten in three days came to her and bowed
him to her and lay down by her as it were a little dog and lycked her wounds
/ and she thanked our lord in saying. Blessed be thou almighty god that by thy
virtue have modered the cruelte of wicked bestes. The tyraunte wroth with this
thing commanded that the lion should be put again in to his cave / and ye
lion dressed him by great wrath and made a lepe and slew Emenyon the
Emperoures cosyn of the which thing he was right sorrowful and commanded her
to be cast in to the fire / and she being within with a Joyful chere god sent
a great wind that put away the fire about her and burnt them that tourme^ted
her The Emperor commanded that the here of her heed should be cut awaye^
which was right fair and long saying that the enchauntementes was in her
heeres. And the vyrgyne said to him. Thou take away the heeres which is an
ornamente of woman / as the apostle says / and god shall put the out of thy
reygne and poursue y^ and thou shalt bide the death with great sorrow and
pain. Then he made her to be enclosed in a temple where his gods were / and
nailed the door and sealed it with his own sygnete. And when three days were
past he came again and found his gods all overthrown and the holy vyrgyne
playenge with aungelles hole and sound. The Emperor asked her what she had
done with his gods / and she said y^ virtue of Ihesu christ has overthrown
them and confounded them. And then he commanded that one should cut her
throat / the^ there was herd a voice that said Martyne vyrgyne for that that
thou have fought for my name thou shalt enter in to my kingdom among my
saints. And thou shalt enjoy with me euerlastyngly. And thus ended ye
blessed Martyne / and then came the bishop of Rome with all his clargye and
buried y^ body honorably in y^ church. And ye same day y^ Emperor Alexa^
der was smyten with such a sorrow yt he ete his own flesh and gnewe
himself to the death.

Of saint Luce of Syracuse. Ca. vij.
ANother vyrgyne Saint Luce there was in the Cite of Syracuse / and so as she
prayed at y^ sepulture of saint Agace for her mother which was sy ke / she saw
saint Agace in a vysyon in the mids of aungelles arrayed in precious stones
which said to her. Luce my sister devout vyrgyne wherefore requyrest thou of
me yt thou may give to thy mother thyselfe I tell the for cer tayne y^ so as
y^ cite of Cathonyas is lyfted up by me / so shall the cite of Syracuse be
worshypped by y^. For thou have arrayed to Ihesu christ delectable Iewelles in
thy clennesse. Luce rose up / and her mother was hole / and she gave all that she
had for gods sake / and after ended her life by martyrdom / and among other
martyrdomes that she had / y^ Judge manaced her to make her to be led to y^
place where yt lewd women used their life. and there she should be defouled in
the despyte of her spouse / and she answered. The soul shall never be de fouled
without consent of y^ mind. For if thou ma ke me to be corrupted by force my
chastyte / and my vyctory shall be doubled thereby / and so as they would led
her to y^ place above said / she was so heavy yt for no horse nor other bestes
yt should draw her thither might not be removed and they put cords on her fete
to draw her forth but she was so sta ble as it had been an hylle. And at her
passing she prophesyed that that was to come to the Emperor. Also the
glorious vyrgyne saint Benet borne in rome is worthy of great reverence. She
had with her.xij. vyrgynes converted by her predycacyon. She desired to
increase by prechynge the christian relygyon. So she departed and her com pany
and preched and converted much people with out having any dread for god was
with them and by the will of god they were departed in son dre and stretched
them in diverse countrees to yt entente that every of them might profit / and
as this holy vyrgyne had converted diverse cou^ tres and increased the faith of
our lord / she ended her life by the palm of martyrdom / and on y^ same wise
did her holy felawes. And saint fauste was not of less perfeccyon of the age
of.xiiij. years / which for that that she would not do sacrefyse to the
ydolles / the Emperor Maxymy on made her to be sawed with a saw of iron But
as the ^awyers seized not sawynge fro the hour of tyerce anon to the hour of
noone and they might not entame her / and they said to her by what virtue have
thou holden us by thine en chauntementes so long here without doing any
thing / and the holy vyrgyne Fauste began to preche to them of Ihesu Christ and
of his law and so converted them. The Emperor had gre te indyngnacyon hereof
and made her to be tour mented with diverse tourmentes / and among others he
made to nail her heed with a thousan de nails like to the helm of a knight /
and she prayed for them that did her persecucyon. And the provost was
converted by that that he saw y^ heuens open and god sitting with his
aungelles and when saint Fauste was in y^ cawdron o^ wa ter boylynge y^ said
provost began to cry. Thou holy servant of god ne go thou not without me and
lepte in to the cawdron / and when the other twain that he had converted saw
y^ they lepte in to the cawdron also / of which the water boiled right
fervently / and the holy Fauste touched theym*and they felt no manner of evil.
And she said I am in the mids as it were a byne beryn ge fruit / as our
lord says / where there ben two or three assembled in my name I am in y^
mids of them. And then there was herd a voice from heaven that said. Come to
me my blessed vyrgyne the fader has asked for you / and they that herd this
thing yielded up the ghost right Ioyously.

Of saint Iustyne. Ca. viii.
THe holy vyrgyne Iustyne borne in ^nthyoche young and of sovereign beauty
overcame the devil which was called up by y^ calling of a ^y gromancere that
he should do so mo che that she should consent to the will of a man that was
gretely taken with her love / and left her not in peace. But for that that by
prayers nor by promyses he could do nothing / he trowed that the ^eu^ll
should help him but it aduayled him not / for the glorious Iustyne chased the
ene my diverse times which that put him in diverse fourmes to tempte her. But he
was overcome of her and went his way confused. And at the last she ended her
life by martyrdom and converted the said nygromancere that was called Cypryen
and had been a man of right a shrewde life / but by her he was put in a good
life / and diverse others were converted by y^ signs yt god showed in her. Also
y^ blessed vyrgyne Eulalye borne in Spay ne of the age of.xij. years stale
away from her fa der and mother that held her in close for that that she never
stynted to speak of our lord Ihesu christ so she fled by night / and went
and cast down the ydolles of the temples to the earth / and cried to the Iuges
that did so much persecucyon to the martyrs that they were deceived / and
that in that faith she would dye / so she was put in y^ nombre of the knights
of Ihesu christ / and had many great tourmentes / and there was much peo ple
converted by y^ miracles yt god showed to her Also of another holy vyrgyne that
was called Matre which was right sore tourmented for y^ faith of Ihesu Christ
/ and among her tourmen tes she had her pappes raced from her body / and
after so as she was in the prison god sent unto her his angel which that
establysshed her health / whereof the provost was gretely abashed.

But he left not for that / but that he made her to be gretely tourmented of
diverse pains / and at the last she yielded up the spyryte to god / and her
holy body lies night the Cite of Raynes.

Also the blessed vyrgyne saint Faith suffered martyrdom in her youth / and
had many tourmentes. And our lord crowned her and sent her a crown of
precious stones by an angel / and god showed for her many meruaylles / by the
whi che many people were converted. Also the holy and blessed vyrgyne Marcyenne
when one did worship to a false image of an ydoll / she took the ydoll and
threw him to the ground and brake him / for the which cause she was so much
beten that they left her for deed / and prysoned in a place*in the which
place a false mynystre trowed to have rauysshed her by night. But by grace deuy
ne there came a great wall between her and hy^ that he might not goo from
thens / the which was seen on the morrow of all the people / by the which
there was much people converted. This holy and blessed vyrgyne had many
diverse tourmentes. But always she preched of the name of Ihesu Christ / and at
the last she prayed to god that he would take her unto him. And thus she ended
her life in her great tourmente.

Also the blessed vyrgyne Saint Eufenye also suffered much for y^ name of god /
she was of good kynred and of noble shap of body. The provost Pry sens
co^^saylled her that she should worship the ydolles / and forsake Ihesu christ
/ and she by right great arguments answered him so much that he could not
assoyle her questyons whereof he had so great wrath that he was overcome of a
woman / and made her to be tourmented with right grievous and hard tourmentes.
But though y^ body of her were sore bruised her wit always en creased and
yielded good words full of the holy ghost / and when she was tourmented the
aungel of god defended her and brake the tourment / and tourmented the
tourmentoures / and she with a glad vysage went out all hole. The false
provost made to hete a fournoys of which y^ flame stretched out by.xl. cubytes
of hight / and made her to be cast in it and she sange within it praysyn ge god
right melodyously so high y^ all people praised her / and when ye fire was
all consumed she came out saufe and hole. The Judge wrother tha^ he was made to
bring brennynge pynsons to draw out her members / but those that should have
done it were so aferde that none durst touch her and all the tourmentes were
all to broken. So ye false tyraunte made to bring four lions / and other.ij.
wild beestes but they worshypped her / and y^ blessed vyrgyne desirous to go
to her god prayed him that he would take her to him / and then she ended
without touching of any of the wild beestes.

Of the vyrgyne Theodosyne / Saint Barbara / and saint Dorothe. Ca. ix.
THe constaunce of the martyrdom of the blessed Theodosyne comes to our
purpose well to be remembered This vyrgyne was right noble and of great beauty
of ye age of.xviij. years she by meruayllous wit dysputed with the Judge
which manaced her to tourment her yi she forsook not Ihesu Christ / and as she
answered by godly words / he made her to be taken by ye here and beten right
sore / and she said to him. Cer tes he is a caytyfe that would lordeshyp
another and can not govern himself. Alas to him that has great charge to be
fulfilled with metes and drynkes and has no thought of the hongre evil for him
that would be warmed and will not clo the ne warm those that been evil clothed
/ woe be to him that would have rest and trauaylleth others evil be it to him
that says all things ben his and he has received them of god / woe be to
him that would that one should do well and he does all evil. Such worthy
words said always y^ holy vyrgyne in her tourmente. But for that she had
sorrow in her heart of the shame of that / that her shamfast members appeared
openly god sent her a white cloud that covered her al. And Urban the Judge
manaced her more and more to whom she said. Thou she west none of my meeses of
my dinner that is ordained for me. And the tyrant manaced her that he would
corrupt her vyrgynyte / to whom she answered. Thou mana cest in vain to be
corrupcyon in me for god enha byteth in ye clean hertes. The provost more wode
than he was made her to be cast in the sea an heavy stone about her neck. And
she borne up with aungelles and brought again to the loud syngyn ge and bare
the stone between her hands / which wayed much more than herself. The
tyraunte made to let go upon her.ij. Leoperdes but they lepte about her
making her great chere. At the last the tyrant yt knew not how to do made
to smite of her heed / and the soul departed fro her body vysybly in ye shappe
of a white down / shynyn ge bright / and the same night she appeared to her fa
der and mother more clerer than the sone / crowned with precious stoues
accompanied with many vyrgynes holding a cross of gold in her hand / and
said to them. Se here what is the Joy that ye would have put away from me /
and by yt they were converted. Also in ye time of Maxymyan the Emperor
floured in virtues ye blessed vyrgyne saint Barbara of noble lygnage and
soueray nely sayre / her fader for because of her beauty had shytte her in a
toure / and she had inspyracyon of ye christian faith / and for that yt she
might not be baptized of none other she herself took water and baptized her in
the name of the fader and sone and the holy ghost. Her fader would have married
her right hyghly and she refused all maryages / and at the last she told that
she was crystened / and had vowed her vyrgynyte unto god / the fader would
have slain her for that cause / and she fled and escaped / and as her fader
poursued her to put her to the death / at the last he found her by ye techyn
ge of a shepeherde which serched anon both him and his beestes / and the
fader led her to y^ provost the which for that that she dysobeyed al his
commandments made her to be martyred with many a grievous tourmente / and
hanged her by the feet / and she said to him / caytyfe ne see thou not that
the tourmentes does me no harm / and he right wroth made her pappes to be
drawn from her body / and in that estate made her to be led thrughe the
cite. And she always gloryfyed god. But for that that she had shame that her
vyrgynall body was seen all naked / our lord sent her his angel and heled
all her wounds / and covered her body with a white clothe. And when she had been led forth ynou ghe one led her again before the provost which was
wode when he saw her all hole / and her face shynynge bright / so he made her
again to be tourmented so much that he commanded when he could think of no
mo tourmentes that her heed should be smyten of. And she made her orysons and
prayed god that he might be in the help of all them that required her in
remembrau^ ce and recorded her passion. And when she had all ended her oryson
and prayer / there was a voy ce herd from heaven which said unto her in this
wise. Come unto me my right dear welbyloued daughter to rest the in the
kingdom of my fader and receive thy crown. And that that thou have required
shall be granted to the and so as she was gone up upon y^ hylle where she
should be heeded Her cruel fader smote of her heed himself. And as he came
down the hylle y^ fire of heaven brent him al to poudre. Also y^ blessed
vyrgyne saint Dorothe the same wise suffered diverse martyrdo mes in Capadoce.
And for that y^ she would not take no man to housbande / and spoke so much of
her spouse Ihesu Christ. The master of the scoles which was named Theophylus
said to her in mockery when one led her to be heeded / that at the leest when
she should be with her spouse that she would send to him of the roses and
apples of the gardyne of her housbande / and she said that she would / whereof
it happened that as soon as she had made an end of her martyrdom right a
fair young child as of y^ age of.iiij. years come to Theophylus and brought
with him a little panyer full of s^ueraynly fair roses and apples
meruayllously well smelling and fair / and said yt the vyrgyne Dorothe sent
them to him. Then was he gretely admeruaylled for it was written in the month
of February / so he was converted and after was martyred for the name of Ihesu
christ So of all other saints vyrgynes that been in heaven by constaunce of
martyrdom if I would tell the y^ hystory should be right long so as saint
Cecyle / saint Agnes / saint Agace / and infynyte others / and if thou will
have mo / go and behol de in the hystoryal myroure and there thou shalt find
enough. And I shall tell the yet of Saint Crystyne for that that she is thy
godmoder / and is a vyrgyne of great dygnyte I shall tell the life of her more
plain / which is devout and fair.

The life of saint Xp^ine vyrgyne and martyr. Capitulo.x.
THe blessid vyrgyne saint Xp^ine was of the cite of Sire daughter of Urban
master of the cheualrye / this la die for her beauty was kept in close by y^
commandment of her fader in a toure / and she had with her seven maidens. And
there her fader let make a fair oratory of ydolles nyghe to the chamber of
Xp^yne to the entente that she should worship them. But she that was so young
as of the age of.xij. years was enspyred of the faith of Ihesu christ and made
no for ce of the ydolles whereof y^ maidens meruaylled and often times they
called on her to do oblacyon. And when she had taken ensence so as to make
sacrefyse to the ydolles / she kneled toward y^ Eest at a wyndowe and looked
toward heaven and encensed the inmortall god. And the most part of the night
she was at that wyndowe beholdyn ge the sterres and she waylynge besought god
ry ght deuoutely and prayed him that he would be her help against all her
adversaries. The maidens which perceived well that her heart was all in Ihesu
christ / kneled before her often times with Joined hands prayenge yt she
should not put her entente in a strange god / but yt she would worship the
gods of her fader and mother / and if that she were known al they should be
destroy ed. Saint Xp^ine answered that they were decey ued by the devil which
styred them to worship so many gods / and that there was but one. At the last
as her fader knew yt his daughter would not worship the ydolles he was right
sorrowful and reproved her. And she said that with a good will she would offer
to god of heaven / and he trowed that she mente Iupyter and was right glad and
would have kyssed her / but she c^yed and said / foul not my mouth. For I
will offer mine offrynge clean to god of heaven / and of earth / and of yt her
fa der was content. And she went in to her cham bre and shytte fast the door
/ and set her on her knees / and offered her holy oryson to god in weeping / and
y^ holy angel of our lord came down and comforted her / and brought her
white bread and mete whereof she ete / for in.iij. days she had no manner of
mete nor drink. After that saint Xp^ine saw at y^ wyn dowes many poor
christian men beggynge at the foot of her toure / and she had nothing to give
them / and she went to seek the Idolles of her fader which were of gold and
silver / and she bra ke them all and gave the pieces to the poor men. And when
her fader knew that thing he beat her right cruelly / and she told him
plainly that he was deceived to worship such false images and that there was
but one god in Trynyte / the which she confessed / and other god would she not
worship to dye therefore / wherefore he was wood with her / and made her to be
bound with chains / and led her betynge her in diverse places / and after
put her in prison / and he said yt he would be Judge himself of that cause. So
he made her to be brought before him on the morrow and manaced her with all
tourmentes / if she would not worship the ydolles / and after that that he sa
we well that she would not turn her entente for prayer ne for manaces / made
her to be stryped all naked both arms and legs and beten so much that.xij.
men were weary of it / and she asked her fader always if he aduysed her not /
and he said to her. Daughter natural pity constrayneth sore my courage to
tourmente the so which art my flesh. But the reverence and the faith that
I have to my gods constrayneth me to do it for y^ that thou dyspysest them.
And the holy vyrgyue answered him. Tyrant which I ought not to call fader /
but enemy of mine holiness / tourmente the flesh hardely that thou haste
engendered / and spare it not. For as for that thou may well do at thy
pleasure / but as for the spyryte the which was made of my fader the which is
in heaven thou have no power in no wise to touch it by no temptacyon / for
Ihesu christ my sauyoure ke peth him. The cruel fader more wood then he was
made to bring a whele that he had let make / and made this holy sweet young
maiden to be bound to it / and to put fire under / and after made to cast
boylynge oil great plentye upon her body / and the whele turned upon her /
and all to brake her / but god the sovereign fader had pity on his servant
sent his angel which brake y^ whele all to pieces / and slew the
tourmentoures staunched the fire / and delivered the vyrgyne ho le and sound /
and slew more than a thousand persons that beheld her without pity / and
the aungelles of god came about her and comforted her. And her fader asked her
/ tell me who has taught the all the cursednesse. And she answered / Tyrant
without pity / have not I told the well that my fader Ihesu christ has
taught me this pacyence / and all the right way in the faith of god alive. And
therefore despise I all thy tourmentes. And I shall overcome in y^ virtue of god
all the assaults of the devil. And he overcome and confused made to cast her
in right an horrible and a derke prison. And so as she was there thynkyn ge on
the great mysteryes of our lord there came to her.iij. aungelles with a great
light and brought her mete / and comforted her / and she yielded thankynges to
god. Urban wist not what to do with her / and left not to think before what
tourmentes he might do to her / at the last as all anoy ed with her for to be
delivered of her made to put a great stone about her neck and throw her in
to the sea. But anon as they threw her in to the sea / the aungelles received
her / and she went up on the water with the aungelles / and then Xp^ine prayed
our lord Ihesu christ lyftynge up her eyes to heaven that it might please him yt
she might re ceyue ye holy sacrament of baptyme in yt same water which she had
desired so much to have. And then our lord Ihesu christ dessended in propre
per sone with a great multitude of aungelles / and bap tysed her and made her
after his name Xp^ine / and crowned her / and shynynge sterre upon her heed /
and set her on the land. And that same night Urban was tourmented with y^
devil and dyed myscheuously. And in y^ morning after she was found prayenge
in her faders halle in a corner.

And thus this blessed Xp^ine which god would receive by matyrdome which she
desired right much was led again by the tourmentoures in to the prison. And
y^ new Judge named zyon which knew well what was done to her / made her to
come before him and coueyted her for her beauty / but when he saw that all his
fair words aduayled him not he made her to be tourmented again and made to
^ylle a great cawdron full of oil and pytche and a great fire underneath it /
and four men tourmented her in the cawdron with great hokes of iron / and the
holy vyrgyne song to god right melodyously and mocked the tourmentoures and
manaced them with the pains of hell. And when the cruel Judge saw yt
nothing aduayled him he made to hang her in the place before all people by
the here of her heed / which was long and shynynge like gold. And the women came rennynge about her which wept for pity to se so young a maiden
tourmented / and cried to the tyrant saying. Thou untrue and cruel man /
how might the heart of a man have such cruelte against a maiden so fair and
so tender / thou art worse than any wild be / and all would have run
upon him. Then the Judge said to her. Xp^ine friend thou shalt suffer no more
tourmente / but come with me / and let us worship y^ sovereign god that has
sustained the so much / he thought of Iupyter which they held for their
sovereign god / but she thought all otherwise.

Then she said to him / thou have right well said and I grant the. And then he
made her to be un hanged and led her to the temple / and great, foy son of
people followed them / when he had brought her before the ydolles trowynge that
she would have worshypped them / she kneled down behol dynge toward heaven /
and made her oryson to god and then she rose up and turned her toward ye
ydoll and said / I say to the thou wicked spyryte which art in this ydoll in
y^ name of Ihesu christ yt thou come out / and anon y^ wicked spyryte lepte out
and made a great and a ferefull noise by y^ which all were so ferde that they
fell down to the earth And the Judge when he was releued said. Xp^ine thou
haste moved our god almighty / but for that that he has pity on y^ / he is
come out that he might se his creature. And she was wroth with yt word / and
reproved him strongly that he was so blind that he knew not gods virtue.
So she prayed god that the ydoll should falledowne al to poudre / y^ which
thing was done / and by the worcester des and signs of ye holy maid there were
converted what of men and women mo than.iij. thousand. And the Judge right sore
aferde said. If y^ king knew that that is done against our god / by the
showing of this Xp^ine / he would destroy me myscheuously / and then the Judge
full of angu ys^ he waxed wood and dyed. The third Iu ge came after named
Iulyan / and made to take Xp^ine and made his auaunt that he would make her to
worship the ydolles. But for all his might that he could do / he might not make
her remeue out of the place where she was / so he let make a great fire about
her / and she bode in yt fire.iij. days and.iij. nyghtes / and there were
herd many diverse sweet melodyes / and the tourmentoures were aferde by y^
meruayllous signs yt they saw / the which things reported to Iulyan he
wend to have waxen wode / and when y^ fire was consumed she came out al hole.
The Judge made serpents to be brought forth and made to cast upon her.ii. aspes
and.ij great colubres which bote and venymed meruayllously / but these
serpents fell down at her fete ye the hedes enclyned toward her without
doing her any herme. And then there were other.ij. horrybie serpents let
lowce upon her and they hanged them at her pappes and lycked her. And Xp^ine
looked toward heaven and said. I yield the thankynges my lord god Ihesu christ
which have ma de me so worshypfully to be enhaunced by the holy virtues that
these horrible serpents knows thy dygnyte in me. And this obstynate Iulyan
se ynge these meruaylles cried to him that was ke per of the serpents. Art
not thou enchaunted of Xp^ine also by the which thou haste no power to move
the serpents against her. Then he which doubted the Judge trowed to have moved
the serpents against her / and they ran upon him and slew him. And so much
every body doubted ye serpents that none durst come nyghe Xp^ine / and she
commanded them by the virtue of god that they should go again into their own
place without doing any harm to any creature / and so they did. Then she
raised again ye deed man to his life which anon cast him at her feet and
was converted. And the Judge blinded with ye devil so as he perceived not the
meruayllous signs said unto Xp^ine. Thou have enough showed thy wytche
crafts / and she said to him. Thou man out of wit if thine eyes would se y^
virtues of god thou sholdest believe them. And then he beyn ge passing wroth
made to draw her pappes out of her body / and anon there came out milk instead of blood. And for that yt she without ceasing named the name of our lord
Ihesus / he made to cut of her tongue / but she spoke better and clerer after
then she did before / and blessed god in tha^kynge him of his great benefeytes
that he did to her. And began to make her oryson unto god yt it might please
him to perform the crown of her martyrdom and to receive her to him. And
then there was herd a voice from heaven sayen ge / Xp^ine pure and clean the
heuens ben open for the / and the reygne without end ready and all the company
of saints blesses god for the / for thou have fro thy youth sustained the
name of christ / and then she praised and gloryfyed god the eyes to ward
heaven. The voice was herd again which said. Come Xp^ine my right welbyloued
and cho sen daughter / and receive the palm and perdurable crown and ye
reward of thy passyonable life in the confession of my name. And ye false Iu
lyan that herd this voice blamed the tourmentoures that they had not cut the
tongue of Xp^ine more nerer / so they cut it so nyghe that she shol de not
speak so much as she did of our lord Ie su christ / for they took an iron
hoke and pulled out the tongue / and cut it anon to ye throat. And she took
the culpen of the tongue and threw it to the vysage of the tyrant / and smote
out his eye / and said to him as holely as ever she spoke before. Thou cursed
tyrant what avails the to cut of my tongue to ye entente yt it should not
worship god when my spyryte shall always worship him and thy spyryte shall dwell
always in cursednesse. And for yt thou know not my word it is good reason yt
my tongue has made the blind. Then she which yt saw Ihesu christ sitting
in the right side of his fader ended her martyrdom by two arowes that were
shot at her / one in the side / yt other toward ye heart. And a cosyne of
hers which was converted by her buried her body and wro te her glorious
legende. O blessed Xp^ine and holy maiden and chosen of god I pray the by the
holiness whereof god has made the so worthy to pray for me a sinner named of
thy name / and have pity on me blessed godmoder which haste rejoiced me to
have cause to put thine holy legende in my wrytynges the which at the
reverence I harecorded a long that it might be agreeable to the and to all
women cause of good ensample.

Of diverse saints which y^ saw their children martyred before them. Ca. xj.
O what thing in y^ world is more ten dre to a moderly heart than to se her
child to suffer pain. But for that yt I se faith is yet the grettest thing
as it appeared to many worshypfull women which for the love of Ihesu christ
offered their own children to tourment. As this blessed Felyx which saw
her.viij. children which were right fair yonglynges martyred before her / and
comforted and counsayled them of pacyence by moderly words to be stable in the
faith. And for the love of god she had forgoten all womanly courage as to the
body. And after that when she had offered them all in sacrefyse to god she would
be sacrefyed herself unto god by martyrdom.

Also the blessed Iulytte in the same wise which had a son named Cyrycus /
she nourysshed him not only with bodily fode but also with spy rytuall. For
without ceasing she enfourmed hy^ in the faith in such wise that he being
right little and young might never be overcome with tourmente / ne by fair
words that he should for sake the name of Ihesu christ / but when he was
tourmented he said with his little clear voice. I am a christian man / I am a
christian man. I thank the our lord Ihesu christ / and he spoke so openly as it
had been a man of.xl. years of age / and his good mother comforted him the
which was also right cruelly tourmented / and she without sea sing praised
our lord and comforted other mar tyres / and spoke of the heavenly Joy that
they die de abide / and that they should have no dread.

Also what shall we now say of the meruayllous constaunce and strength yt
the blessed Blan dyne had / she saw tourmented and martyred be fore her her
daughter which was of ye age of.xv. years whom she comforted Ioyously / and
after as a woman should go to her spouse / she went to put her in tourmente /
and was so much tourmented by multitude of martyrdomes that the tourmen
toures were weary of her / and put her on agrydyren and roasted her and was
always prycked with pynnes of iron / and she always gloryfyed our lord god /
and so she co^tynued anon to y^ death. what should I say to the for to
fulfill our cite of such meyny. Come on Saint Ursula with all thy.xj.
thousand vyrgynes and blessed martyrs for y^ name of Ihesu christ all their
heedes smyten of so as they were sent to be married and they aryued in a land
of myscreauntes which would constrayne them to forsake the faith of god / and
they cho se rather to dye than to forsake the name of their sauyoure Ihesu
christ.

Of saint Maryne the holy vyrgyne. Ca. xij.
OF vyrgynes martyred one might tell a great nombre / and the same wise of
others that lived in relygyon / and in many other holy guyses / and I shall
tell the of twain of whom the hysto ry is right fair. A seculer man had one
only daughter little and young named Maryne / so he put her in the ward of a
cosyne of his own / and entered in relygyon / and led right an holy life. And
not for that nature drew him to think on his daughter whereof his pain made
him to be heavy / so he was right pensyfe / and the abbot demanded him the
cause of his heaviness so much till he told him that all his thought was upon a
daughter of his / which he had left in the worl de which he might not
forgete. The abbot bad hy^ yt he should go to fetch her / and y^ she might be
put in to relygyon with him. So was this maid with her fader clothed as a
little monk / and could well keep her close / and she was of right good
dyscyplyne. And when she came to the age of.xviij. years always persevering
from good to better / y^ fader which had taught her this holy life passed out
of this world / and she abode alone in her faders celle in holy living / so
that the abbot and all other praised her holy conuersacyon / and wist none
other but y^ she was a man. This abbay was but.iij. miles from a market town
So it fortuned that the monks must of necessyte go other whiles unto the
foresaid market for to bye their necessaryes / whereof it happened diverse times
that they were nyghted in their coming home ward / in the winter season after
that they had done their busynes / so that they must needs lie in the town.
And Maryne which was named friar Maryne diverse times abo de at his course in
the foresaid town in a certain hostery where he lodged communely when he came
to the town. So it hap in that time that the daughter of y^ host was with
child. And as she was constrained by her fader and mother to tell whose it was
she put it upon frer^ Maryne where of the fader and mother came and complained to
the abbot which made him to be sent for and was right sorrowful of this
thing. And the holy may den had lever take the blame upon her than to ex cuse
her. And she kneled weeping and ^ayd / fader pray for me I have sinned and I
shall do penaun ce. And then the abbot being right wroth made him to be beten
and tourmented / and put him out of the monastery and defending him the en
trynge again. And he set him on the e^the before y^ abbay / and lay there in
penance / and asked of his brethren one mors^ll of bread ones a day and y^
do^ ghter of y^ hosteler was delivered of a sone / and y^ mother of her brought
this child to Maryne before y^ abbay and there left it. And the holy maiden
received him / and with the morselles of bread y^ men going in and out gave
him nourysshed this child as though it had been his own / and on a time after
that y^ brethren moved with pity prayed the abbot that he would receyne again
friar Maryne to mercy / and with great pain they constrained him at their
prayer. And she had been then.v. years in that penance before the gate of the
monastery. And when he was entered in the abbaye the abbot commanded him to do
all y^ foul offices of within / and that he should bryn in water to wasshe al
their necessaryes / and that he should serve all the people of the place. And
the holy vyrgyne did it humbly / and with a good will And within a while after
she passed to our lord. And when the brethren had told this to the abbot he
said to them. Se ye that his syn^e was su che that he deserved no pardon.
Nevertheless wass he him and bury him far from the abbay And so as they did
of his clothes such as he wa re they saw that it was a woman / then they
began to cry and were passing sorry for the great evil and greuaunce that was
done to so holy a creature without cause / of the which conuersacyon they had
great marvel. This thing told to the abbot he was astonyed gretely / and
anon he fell down at the feere of the holy body in great weeping / betynge
his breast for his blame and cry enge mercy / and requyrynge pardon / and
ordained her sepulture in a chapel within the monaste ry. Thither came all the
monks among the whi che there was one that had but one eye which kneced
down and kyssed the holy body by great devotion / and anon his sight was
restored to him the same day. And the woman that bare the child became out of
her wyste / and cried on her sin / and then she was brought unto the ho ly
body / and there she recovered health. And sith almighty god did many miracles
for her in the ^ayd place.

Of the most holy and blestyd vyrgyne Eu^ra syne. Capitulo.xiij.
THere was a mayde^ alexa^dre named Eufrasyne y^ which god had given to her
fader Paffousyen a man of gre te richesse by the prayers of an holy abbot and
of a covent of monks yt was nyghe him / when this daughter was waxen mo che ye
fader would have married her / but she yt was given in purpose to keep her
vyrgynyte fled clothed in ye guyse of a man / and required y^ abbot yt she
might be received in to y^ said abbaye / and made him to believe that she was a
young man of the Emperoures court which had devotion to be rendered in to that
relygyon. The abbot which sa we his great devotion received him with good
will. And when the fader might not find his daughter he had meruayllous
sorrow. So he ca me to the abbot to tell his great sorrow to find some
comfort / and prayed him and his couente to pray to god that he might have
some tidings of her. The abbot comforted him and said yt he might not believe
that a child given of god by prayer should be perysshed. Long the abbot and
the covent prayed to god for this thing. And as this good man might here no
tidings came eve ry day to the abbot to have some comfort in his trybulacyon
y^ abbot said to him on a day truly I wene not that thy daughter is evil gone
for if it were so I deem that god would have showed it vuto us or this time.
But and if thou will speak to a child of devotion and prayer the which we
have here within which came hyder from y^ Emperors court / and god has
given him so much of grace that every person that speaks with him fyndeth him
right well comforted. Paffou syen prayed him that for gods love he might
speak with him. And the abbot made the fader to be brought to the daughter
which he knew not but the daughter knew well y^ fader / so she was anon
full of teeres and turned her a part so as though she would end some manner
of oryson / and the beauty and the fresshnesse of her vysage was gretely
empayred by y^ great abstynence yt she did. After she spoke to her fader and
comforted him and made him certain that he should se his daughter or he dyed /
and that he should not doubt but that she was in the service of god where ever
she were / and that yet he should have great Joy of her The fader trowed that
he knew that by dyuyne virtue and departed thens right well comforted and said
to the abbot that ever sith his daughter departed he had not found to his
courage so mo the of comfort / and I am said he fulfilled with the grace of
god sith that I shall have tidings of my daughter / and with that
recommendynge him to the abbot and to the prayers of y^ brethren he departed.
But he might not hold him / but yt he must often times come again to vysyte
ye ho ly brother / and he did nothing but by his coun sail. And thus it
endured by so long time that this daughter which named herself Synaroch had
complete the space of.xxxviij. year within her celle. And than it pleased god
to call her to him and sykenes took her. The good man of yt right sorrow full
came thither / and when he saw that Synaroche should dye he began to cry. Alas
where be those sweet words and those promyses that y^ have made to me that I
should se my daughter. Syna roche passed to god / and the fader was not there
when he passed. He held a writing in hand whi che no man might take out / ye
abbot and all ye covent came to assaye but they did nothing / upon this y^
fader came thither with great cryenge / and great weeping for his good friend
which he found deed on whom was all his comfort. and as soon as he
approached the corpse to kiss it before all he opened the hand and took to him
y^ writynge / and he took it and red within that it was his daughter / and
that none should touch her body to bury it but only he / this thing was
great marvel to him / to the abbot / and to all ye covent which gretely
praised her holy stablenes in virtue. And to the fader doubled the weeping in
consolacyon of his life. So he sold all yt ever he had / and rendered him in to
the same abbaye and there he ended his life. Now I have told the of diverse
vyrgynes. So I shall tell the of other ladies martyrs right glorious and of
holy life.

Of the blyssed lady Anastase and her fellows Ca. xiiij.
THere was in the time of y^ great persecucyon of the christian people in Rome in
the time of Dyoclutan y^ Emperor. There was in that Cite ry ght a noble lady
of great richesse and of great auctoryte which was named Anastase. This lady
had meruayllous great compassyon of the tourment that she saw done every day
to the martyrs / and for to comfort them and vysy te them / she clothed her
in the habyte of a poor woman / and went with one maiden unto the prysons
where they were / and comforted them with precious meets and drynkes / and of
such as she might. She washed / and wyped their wounds / and anointed them
with right precious oyntementes. And she continued so long till she was
accused to Publyen / which was a noble man of Rome which that would have had
her to wife / which waxed wroth with it / and he made such awaytes on her
that she durst not come out of her house. And then among other martyrs in
the prison there was Saint Gryso gone a man of right great excellence / the
which had suffered many diverse tourmentes / and he was sustained of the
goods and the vysytacyons of that good and gracyous lady Anastase. Unto whom
the foresaid saint Grysogone sent couertely diverse epystles / by a good
virtuous christian woman / counsaylynge her of pacyence / and in the same wise
she sent unto him by the said woman. And at the last so as god would he that
held her so short dyed. And she sold all that she had / and employed it all
in the vysytacyon and sustenaunce of martyrs. This noble lady had great
suyte of ladies and of maydyns crystened. And among the others. There
were.iij. maidens systers of noble lygnage which were right famylyer with her
/ one of these systers was called Agappe that other Thyonne / and the third
Hyrene. So it came to the knowledge of the Emperor that these noble systers
were crystened / he sent for them and promised them great gifts and that he
would marye them hyghly if they would forsake the name of Ihesu christ / and as
they made thereof no charge he made them to be beten / and after to be put in
hard prison in the which prison their holy friend Anastase vysyted them not
sparynge night and day and prayed god that he would suffer her to live while
her goods endured to the entente that she might employ them al in that holy
work. The Emperor commanded Dulcycyon his provost that all y^ christian peo
ple that were in y^ prysons should be constrained by tourmentes to worship y^
ydolles. So y^ said provost made them for to be brought before him among
which were the.iij. systers. And when the cursed Judge saw them he coueyted
them for their beauty and counsaylled them in secret wise by fair words and
promyses that they should accord to him / and he should deliver them. But as
they were all that refusing he put them in to the ward of one y^ was famylyer
with him and he made them to be led in to his house and he thought to have
them against their will or with their will. And when the night came he went
alone without light to the house where he made them to be brought. And as he
would goo to the place where he herd their voice / which all the night did
no thing but praise god / He passed by the place where all the vessels of
the kechyne were kept. And then he full of the devil and blinded with the
spyryte of Lechery so as god would he took them by the neck and kyssed them
straytely sith one and sith another / and trowed yt it had been the maidens. And
so much he went thus doyn ge y^ he was verily weary. And when it was day he
went to his people which abode him without / which when they saw him / he
seemed a figure of the devil so much he was soylled with fat and coals / and
his gown rent and traylynge in the dyrte / so they fled from him all
aferde. And when he saw them fle thus / and that they despy sed him he was
meruayllously abass^ed / wherefore it was / so he thought him that he would go
and complain to the Emperor of that y^ every man mocked him there as he
went and scorned him. And when he was entered into y^ palas where many abode
him in the morning / then there began a great cry upon him where some beat
by^ with rods / some shoued him abacke saying. Go out of the way thou
unhappy and abhomynable person thou stynkest all about / some scrat ched him
in y^ vysage / and some laughed him to scorn / so he was greatly
admeruaylled what that it might be that he was almoost out of his wit. For
the devil had closed so his eyes that he might no perceive it / so he turned
him home again unto his house right foul ashamed.

And then another Judge was put in his place / which made these three blessed
vyrgynes to come before him / and he would make them to worship the ydolles /
and for that that they would do nothing as his bidding was / he commau^ ded
them to be dyspoyled all naked / and so to be beten / yet for all their might
they might not despoyle them / for their clothes were so cleuynge to them that
there might no man put them of / so he made them to be put in a fire right hot
brennynge which grieved them nothing. And then they prayed to god that they
might end their ly ues if it pleased him / so they passed anon to our lord
right gloryously. But for to show that it was their will to dye / the fire
never burnt them nor none of their clothes / and when the fire was wasted the
bodies of them were found / the han des Joined as hole and fresshe as though
they had slepte. And the blessed lady Anastase which took good head of them
buried them.

Of saint Theodore the vyrgyne. Ca. xv.
ANother noble felawe had this good Anastase which was named Theo dory / the
which had.iij. young children. This lady for that that she refused marriage of
the earl Lencadyne / and yt she would not do sacrefyse to the ydolles there was
made many tourmentes for her. And to constrayne the better by moderly pity made
to tourment one of her sons. But by the virtue of ye faith which passed
nature she comforted him saying / sone ne doubt thou not these tourmentes /
for by them thou shalt go to Joy euerlastyn ge / and then the lady was put in
prison. A sone of the devil came to her to defoule her chastyte / but suddenly
he began to blede at the nose / and he cry ed and said that a young felawe had
smyten him on the nose with his fyst which was with her in the prison. So this
lady was tourmented / and at the last they slew her and her.iij. sons which
yielded their blessed spyrytes gloryfyenge god and the blessed Anastase buried
them. Then this holy Anastase had so much haunted the vysytacyon of martyrs
that at the last she was taken and emprysoned / so she might no more vysyre y^
saints of god / ne had no mete nor drink. But god which would not that she
which so dylygently had comforted and refresshed his holy seruaun tes to
suffer more / he sent unto her the spyryte of her blessed felawe Theodorye
with a great light the which set before her a table and she brought with her
diverse precious refecryens. And kept company with her.xxx. days / in the
which time was never delivered to her mete nor drink / and they trowed that
she had been deed for hongre / so she found all alpue and brought before the
pr^uost which had great sorrow / and for that yt diverse people were converted
by ye miracle / he made her to be put in a shyn with other trespassours that
were condemned to death. And when they were in the high see / the maryners to
obey that that they were commanded / brake the ship and went in to another
vessel. And then the blessed Theodosyne appeared to them / and conveyed the^ by
the sea a night and a day / as surely as they had been upon the plain earth /
so much that she set them in the I Will of palm / in the which I Will the re were
many byss hoppes and holy men put in exyle so they were receyned there / with
praysynges to god and with great Joy. And those that were escaped with
Anastase were baptized and byleued in god. This thing after come to the
knowledge of the Emperor he sent to fetch them all both man and woman and
child about the nombre of three hundred / which he made all to dye by diverse
tourmentes. And the blessed Anastase after many great arguments that she made
to ye Emperor / and after diverse tourmentes that she had was crowned by
martyrdom.

Of the noble Natalye. Ca. xvj.
NAtalye y^ noble wife of Adryan pryn ce of the cheual^y of the Emperor
Maxymyan as she was crystened se cretly in the time that diverse cryste^ people
were martyred she herd say that Adryan her housbande for whom she prayed god
without ceasing was suddenly converted in beholdynge ye martyrs tourmented /
and had confessed the name of Ihesu christ wherefore ye Em perour of that right
wroth made him to be put in right an hard prison. The good lady right Joyous
of ye conuersyon of her housbande went anon to ye prison to comfort him /
and to pray him to persevere in that he had begone / and kyssed the chains with
which he was bound wepyn ge for pity and Joy / and counsayllynge him great
ly that he would have no respect to these erthely Joys that endured but a
while / but that he shol de have before his eyes the great glory that was
ordained for him. This holy lady was there lon ge comfortynge him and all the
other martyrs praynge god that she might be of their company and prayed them
gretely that they should comfor te her housbande of whom she doubted her that
by force of tourmentes he should not change in the stablenesse of the faith /
she vysyted him eve ry day / and every day preched him to have stablenesse /
and many a fair word she spoke to him. But for that that she and diverse other
ladies vy syted the holy martyrs the Emperor made to defend that no woman
should come in to them. And therefore she clothed her in the guyse of a man And
when it came to the day of his last martyrdom she was present and wyped his
wounds and kyssed his blood and prayed him that he wol de pray to god for her.
And thus passed the blessed Adryan / and she took with her one of his hands
that was cut of / and wrapped it full derely in a couerchefe as a relyke.
This holy lady after the death of her housbande one would constrayne her to be
wedded because she was of high lygnage fair and rich / so she was always in
oryson pray enge god that he would draw her out of the han des of them that
would constrayne her to be wedded. And then there appeared to her in slepynge ye
spyryte of her housbande which comforted her / and said unto her that she
should goo in to Coustantynoble to burye the bodies of many martyrs that were
there / and she did so. And when she had been there a while in gods service
in vy sytynge the holy martyrs emprysoned / her housbande appeared unto her
again and said to her / Sister and friend Chambere of Ihesu Christ co me on in
to glory perpetual for our lord calls the. And then she awoke / and anon
after she passed to our lord.

Of the holy and blessed Saint Affra. Capitulo.xvij.
AFfra was a woman that lived folyly converted to the faith of Ihesu Christ and
was accused to the Judge which said to her. It suffyseth not the / ye
dyshonestye of thy body but yt thou must fall in error to worship a strange
god / do sacrefyse to our gods that they may pardon the And Affra answered /
I shall do sacrefyse to my god Ihesu Christ that came down for sinners. For
his gospel says yt a woman a sinner wassh ed his feet with her teres and had
forgyuenesse And he despised never folyly living woman ne ye publycanes
sinners but he let them ete with him. The Judge said unto her. If thou do no
sacrefyse thou shalt not be loved of thy rybaudes / ne thon shalt receive no
gifts of them. She answered I shall never receive cursed gifts and those yt I
have gotten untruly I have prayed to the poor peo ple that they will take them
and pray for my fyn nes. The Judge gave his sentence that saint Affra should be
burnt sith that she would not do sacrefyse. And when she was delivered to
tourmente she worshypped god and said lord god almighty Ihesu christ which
call sinners to penance receive my martyrdom in goood entente in the hour
of my passion / and deliver me fro everlasting fire by this corporal fire
that is arrayed to my body / and ye fire being about her she said. Lord Ihesu
christ pleases ye to receive me a pore sinner in sacrefyse of thy holy name y^
y^ offered thyselfe in sacrefyse for all the world / and thou ryghtfull we re
put on the cross for the unrightful / and good for the evil doers / blessed
for the cursed / sweet for the bitter / clean and innocent from sin to
deliver the sinners. To the I offer the sacrefyse of my body which lives and
reygneth with the fader and the holy ghost by all the world of worlds. And
thus ended the blessed Affre for whom our lord has showed sith many miracles.

Here tells Justice of diverse ladyed which served and lodged the appostles
and other saints. Capitulo.xviii.
WHat would thou that I say to the more fair Xp^ine. I might bring to
remembrance such ensamples without nombre. But for that y^ thou art adme
ruaylled so as thou haste said here before that wherefore all auctours blame
women. I say to the that though that thou have found it in the wrytynges of
auctours pay nymes I trow that to that purpose thou sha^te find but few in
holy legendes and in the hysto ryes of Ihesu christ and of his appostles / and
the same wise of all the saints so as thou may se / but a great nombre thou
shalt find of meruayl lous constaunce by the grace of god in women / and good
seruyces great charytees that they have do ne and do without faynynge / and by
good will to y^ servants of god both hospytalytees and other good deeds / so
as it is written of Drucyane which was a good lady and a awydowe / which re
ceyued to host saint John^ the euangelyst / she served him of his mete and his
drink. And when the said saint Johan should be received fro his exyle and
those of the cite made him a great feast Drucyane was borne to be buried which
was deed for sorrow yt he tarried so long / and her neygh boures said to him.
Johan see here Drucyane thy good hostess which is deed for sorrow for thy
long taryenge / she shall serve y^ no more. And than saint Johan said to her
Drucyane rise up and go in to thy house and make ready my refeccy on / and she
rose from death to life. Also another of ye cite of Lymoges named Susanne /
she was the first that harbored saint Marcyall which was sent thither by
saint Peter to convert the country and did him right much good.

Also the good lady Maxymylle buried saint Androwe and took him from the
cross / and doing this she put herself to the peril of death.

Also ye holy maid Euphygene followed by denocyon saint Mathewe the euangelyst
/ and after his death she made to edefye for him right a fair church. Also
another good lady was so much taken with the love of saint Poule ye apostle that
she followed him all about / and served him by great dylygence. Also in yt time
of ye apostles a noble queen called Helyn / and it was not she y^ was mother of
Constantyne but another queen of Oblygoys which went to Iherusalem / in the
which there was great scarcete of vytaylles for the famyne that was there. And
when she knew that the saints of our lord that were in ye Cite to preche and
to convert the people dyed for hongre she made to bye so much vytaylles for
them that they were pouruayed as long as the derthe lasted. Also when one
lydde saint Poule to be heeded by the commandment of Nero a good lady which
was called Pautylle that was acostomed to serve him came against him weeping
gretely. And saint Poule asked of her a couerchefe that she had upon her heed /
and she took it him whereof the shrewde people yt were there mocked him saying
for that it was fair that so much she had lost. Saint Poule himself wyped
his eyes / and after when he was deed he sent it again to the woman full of
blood wherefore she kept it right rychely. And saint Poule appeared to her and
said that for so much that she had done him service in heaven in prayenge for
her / enough of others in like case I might tell the. Uaxyllete was a noble
lady in the virtue of charity. This lady was married to saint Iulyan. And in the
night of their wedding of one acorde they vowed vyrgynyte / and none might
think the holy conuersacyon of this woman / ne y^ multitude of women and
maidens that were saved and drawn to holy life by her holy monycyon. To say
shortly so much she had of grace in her that our lord spoke to her as she
was in dyenge. I wot not what I should say more Xp^yne my dear love I might
tell the without nombre of ladies of diverse estates as well vyrgynes as wydowes
/ or married women / in whom god has showed his virtues by meruayllous
strength and constaun ce / so be thou suffysed as now. For right well and
fair as it seems me I have well quytte me of my ne office in perfourmynge of
the high bataylementes of thy Cite. And I have peopled it with excellent
ladies / so as I promised the. And notwithstanding that I name not / ne may
not name all the holy ladies by their names / which yt has been / which that been / and which that shall be / all may be comprehended in this Cite of Ladies
/ of the which one may say. ( Gloriosa dicta sunt de te ciuitas dei). That
is to say / glorious things ben said of the thou Cite of god. So I yield it to
the as a parfyte thing well and stably so as I promised the. Now I betake the
to god / and the peace of our high sovereign be euerlastyngely with the.

AMEN
Here Xp^ine speaks unto the ladies in the end of the book. Ca. xix.
MI right redoubted ladies worship ped by god now is our Cite well accheued
and made parfyte / in the which all ye that loves honor / virtue / and
praysynge may be lodged with great worship as well those that are past as those
that been now / and those that be to come.

For it is founded and made for every woman of worship. And my right dear
ladies it is a thing natural to man's heart to rejoice him when he fyndeth
him that he has the vyctory of any entrepryse / and that his enemies be
confounded So have ye cause all ye my ladies to rejoice you now virtuously in
god and in good co^dycyons by this new cite to se it parfyte which may not be
only the refuge of al you / that is to understand de of virtuous women / but
also the defense and ward against your enemies and assayllers if ye keep it
well. For ye may se that the matter whereof it is made is all of virtue / and so
truly shynynge that all ye may behold therein and specially in y^
emfrytaylynge of this last party / and the same wise in that which may
touch you of other par ties. And my dear ladies. So use ye not of this new
heritage as these proud people which be come so full of pride when their
prosperyte encrea seth and are mounted in richesse / but by y^ ensample of your
queen the sovereign vyrgyne which after so great worship that the angel
brought to her as to be the mother of the sone of god. She so much more meked
her in calling her y^ hand maiden of god. So my ladies as be it true that the
more the virtues ben the more ye ought to yel de you humble and benygne / and
this Cite be cause unto you to love good manners / and to be virtuous and
humble. And have ye not in despyte ye ladies that been married to be so subjects
to your housbandes. For it is not some times best to a creature to be free out
of subieccyon / and that witnesses the tongue of our lord god where he says
to Esoras the prophet. Those he says that use their free will falls in
sin / and despise their lord / and defouleth the Just people / and therefore
they perysshe. So be ye humble and pa^yente and the grace of god shall encreace
in you / and ye shall be given in praysynge to y^ world. For saint Gregory
says that pacyence is the entrye of paradyse and the way of Ihesu Christ. And
amon you vyrgynes in the state of maydenhode / be ye clean / simple / coye /
and without ydelnesse. For y^ gynnes of evil men ben set against you. So be ye
armed with virtuous strength against their cauteyles to eschew their
frequentacyon.

And to ladies wedowes be honest in habyte and countenance and in word /
devout in deed and in conuersacyon / prudente in governance / pacyente in
that where need is / in meekness and in charity. And to all generally / great
/ mean / and little will ye always to be set in defense against the ene myes of
your worship and chastyte. Se my ladies how these that accuses you makes all
them liars that blames you. And put abacke these losen gyers which by diverse
draughtes hurts and withdraws that that ye ought to keep so well / that is
to understand your worshyppes. O the lewd love of which they counsel you
and styreth you thereto. Fle it for gods love fle it / for be ye certain /
though that the semblaunt be fair it is deceyuable / that at all times the
end of it is preiudyce to you. And think not the contrary for otherwise it
may not be. Remember how they call you frail and false / and always they
seek en gynes right strange and deceyuable with great pain and travail for
to take you so as one do the to take wild beestes. Flee their gynnes my ladies
/ flee their acquayntaunce under laughyn ge of whom is lapped venyme right
full of anguysshe which brings one lightly to the death And thus that it
please you my right redoubted ladies to draw to the virtues and flee vices to
encreace and multeplye our Cite / and ye to reioy ce in well doing. And me
your servant to be re commended unto you in praynge god which by his grace in
this world grant me for to live / and persevere in his holy service / and at
the end to be pyteous to my great defautes / and grant both unto you and me
the Joy which endureeuermore.

AMEN
