By the Queen.
WHereas advertisement is given unto us, that there is at this time dispersed
within our City of London, and the Suburbs thereof, a great multitude of base
and loose people, such as neither have any certain place of abode, nor any
good or lawful cause of business to attend hereabouts, but lie privily
corners and bad houses, listening after news and stirs, and spreading rumors
and tales, being of like lihood ready to lay hold of any occasion to enter
into any tumult or disorder, thereby to seek rapine and pillage: And like wise
that further numbers of such forced of vagabond people do continually stock
and gather to our City, and the places confining about the same: Forasmuch as
we have lately in this most dangerous and desperate action of Rebellion, had
most evident and full proof of the loyal and true hearts and settled and
vnmoouebale affections, as well of the rest of our Subjects, as specially of our
Citizens of London, whereby we do to our great comfort foresee there can grow
now account of disturbance of our peace and quiet, but from such refuse and
vagabond people:

Therefore we do straightly command and charge all persons, that such loose
people, having no certain dwelling or abode within the City and Suburbs
thereof, or otherwise no sufficient cause of stay or lawful business,
presently anoyde, and get them down into the Country, upon pain of death by
Marshall Law, to be executed upon them, And do in like manner command all
people of like sort and condition, or any other persons that cannot yield some
reasonable cause of their repair, to forbear to come out of the Country to
our said City, or the Suburbs thereof, upon like pain: And we do
straightly charge as well our Provost Marshall, as the Constables and others,
to whom it may appertain, to apprehend such offenders, that they be proceeded
with, with all care and diligence, as they will answer it at their uttermost
peril.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the fifteenth day of February 1600. in the
three and fortieth year of our Reign.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Queens most excellent
Majesty.

ANNO 1600.
