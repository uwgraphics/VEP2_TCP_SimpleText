Some Prison Meditations of an humble Heart, etc.
OH, Oh my Soul, be not unmindful of the large mercy and goodness of the Lord
showed toward thee, neither forget the exceeding loving kindness of the Holy
One manifested unto thee Oh my Soul; Oh let the sense of what the Lord thy
dear, tender, pitiful, compassionate God has done for thee; continually be
fresh in and upon thee oh my Soul, for the Lord thy God has freely done that
for thee, which none besides him the mighty one could do: Oh my Soul the Lord
has brought thee out of the pit, even out of the horrible pit, and out of the
mire and clay, wherein thou once stuck so fast, as that thou could never have
been able to have gotten out by all means possible thou could have invented,
but must have sunk deeper and deeper therein, and so have perished for ever,
had not the Lord God of infinite mercy helped thee, who did cast his eye of
pity and compassion upon thee, and out of his mere mercy, love and free grace,
stretched out his hand to help thee oh my Soul, when none besides him could
help thee, and by his arm of loving kindness lifted thee up out of the
horrible pit, out of the mire and clay, and has set thy feet upon a Rock which
stands sure, and can never be moved, and thereon he establishes thy goings,
praises, pure living righteous Praises to the Lord thy God be rendered by thee
Oh my Soul even for ever and for ever more.

Oh my Soul remember thou wast once even like a poor silly sheep without a
shepherd wandering upon the barren mountains and dry heaths in the wilderness
and solitary places, full of trouble, sorrow, and perplexity, and knew not the
way to the fold of rest, oftentimes mourning and weeping alone as a Dove
without her Mate, when no eye saw thy sorrow but the Lord alone; often saying
in thy heart, whose state and condition is so miserable as mine? who so poor
and desolate as I? none knows how i^ is with me but the Lord alone: And
indeed the Lord then saw thee and knew how it was with thee oh my Soul, and he
the tender God of unfathomable bowels of compassion, beheld thee in that day
when thou did eat thy bread weeping, and mingled thy drink with thy tears, and
he the compassionate one heard thy secret cries, and knew thy secret desires,
and thy sighing and groaning entered into his ears, and thy tears which thou
dropped upon his altar, laid open unto the view of the eye of thy tender
mercyful God, and his tender bowels was moved with pity toward thee, and for
his own seed sake he had compassion upon thee oh my soul, and helped thee in
the day of thy trouble, and delivered thee out of distress, who freely reached
forth his arm unto thee and took thee by the hand, and brought thee out of the
wildernesses and desolate places, and set thy feet in the right way which has
led thee to a City of habitation, and to the fold of rest; and now the Lord
(who both sought thee and found thee out, and brought thee out of the
wilderness, and from off the barren mountains) he is become thy shepherd oh my
soul; and how can thou want any good thing, he oftentimes feeds thee, and
even causes thee to lie down in green Pastures and leads thee by the still
waters, even Shilos brook which runs softly, and he spreads thy Table in the
sight of thy enemies, and anointeth thy head with the oil of gladness, and
causes thy cup to overflow with new wine, and has brought thee to sit under
thy own Vine, and under thy fig tree, and none shall make thee afraid oh my
soul: Oh the goodness of the Lord, oh the kindness of the Lord, oh the mercy of
the Lord, oh the pity of the Lord, oh the compassion of the Lord God of tender
bowels is even unutterable, unspeakable, unfathomable and incomprehensible; Oh
the height, oh the depth, oh the length, oh the breadth of the love of the
Lord: oh my soul! truly when thou meditatest of the goodness of the Lord, and
considerest of his loving kindness and mercy showed toward thee, oh how can
but the sense thereof pitch thee even upon a stand of admiration: Oh surely,
surely when thou oh my soul looks back into his works and considerest how
much he has wrought in thee and for thee, thou can see no end of his praises;
oh praises, oh living praises, holy righteous praises unto the pure holy
righteous Lord God be ascribed by thee oh my soul for ever and for ever more.
Oh my Soul as thou art kept in the fresh sense and remembrance of the great
loving kindness, the great mercy, the great pity and unspeakable compassion of
the Lord thy tender God which he has and daily does manifest unto thee oh my
soul; Oh how can thou but in the sense of Gods unspeakable love abound in
love, in pity, in mercy, in kindness, in tenderness and compassion toward all
people, but especially toward all souls, who are seeking, thirsting, hungring,
breathing, crying and panting after Righteousness, peace and everlasting rest,
and eternal happiness: Oh my soul the Lord thy God knows the frame of thy
spirit, the Lord knows the tenderness of thy bowels, and the openness of thy
bosom toward all the seekers after Righteousness, toward all the travelers
to Sion, and toward all the Mourners therein: Oh my soul remember how that at
some times when the great fountain, the great deep has opened and issued forth
of his fullness into thee oh my soul; and when joy has come into thy heart as a
river, and gladness as a mighty stream, refreshings as shoures in the spring,
and consolation as due upon the tender plants, and when thou could sing for joy
of heart, and shout out aloud even praises and halleluiahs to thy God, that
then even then thou oh my soul remembers the poor and needy in his own eyes;
and think thou hear his cry sounding in thy ear, and his soul saying in
secret; Oh how many is there who eats of the largest loaves, and drinks of
the largest full flagons; but oh alas for me, I have scarce a drop of
refreshment, hardly a crum of consolation, but my tears is my m^at and drink
day and night, whilst my enemy says unto me where is thy God: Oh I go bowed
down all the day long, and none knows my sorrow but the Lord alone; Oh I am
even as an Owl in the desert, and as the Pelican in the Wilderness, I am as
the alone quail in the stuble fields, and as a Dove mourning for the loss of
her Mate, and as the alone Sparrow upon the house top, and as a woman forsaken
and grieved in spirit; Oh whose condition is like mine! is there any amongst
the Sons and daughters of Men like unto me? is there any so poor as I? oh is
there any so needy as I? oh is there any so weak and feeble as I? is there any
so foolish as I? oh is there any so dry and barren as I? oh is there any so
cold and fruitless to Godward as I? is there any so desolate as I? Oh my
leanness, oh my leanness, oh how long, how long shall it be thus with me? oh
how long, how long shall I sit mourning as by the river of Babylon with my Harp
laid aside? oh when, when shall I walk again in Sion, and travel in the streets
of Jerusalem? with a new song in my mouth, and everlasting joy upon my head,
and living praises in my heart unto the Lord who dwells in his Sion, and his
presence is great in his Jerusalem? but oh alas for me, I am as one cast out
of his sight, and one who walks dejected all the day long; Oh when will the
Lord cause the days of my mourning to be over, and the nights of my sorrow to
pass away, and my sighings and groanings to vanish, and all tears to be wiped
from mine eyes; Oh when will the Lord give me beauty instead of ashes, the oil
of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness,
that I (a poor dry barren one) might become a tree of Righteousness, bringing
forth fruit of holiness abundantly to the praise of the Lord God, that he in
and through me might be glorified; oh when shall my winter be over, and the
terrible storms gone; Oh when shall the cold nipping frosts be expelled, and
the darkness and gloominess be extinguished? Oh when will the Sun of
Righteousness break forth unto me in his glory, and his warm beams refresh and
warm my poor cold soul? Oh when will the spring come, when shall I know a
spring time in the Lord? oh when will Summer come? oh when will the singing of
birds come? oh when shall I hear the voice of the Turtle in my Land? oh when
will the shoures from on high fall down upon my soul? oh when shall I receive
the early and latter rain? oh when shall I come to sit under my own Vine, and
under my fig tree, and none to make me afraid? Oh how long shall my beloved be
hid from me as in the ^lifts of the Rocks, and as in the secret places of the
Stares? sometimes indeed he shows himself unto me as behind the wall, and as
through a lattis, and then my bowels, my tender bowels are moved for him: Oh
when, oh when shall I have a full enjoyment of him whom my soul loves; oh that
I could but plainly hear his voice, and perfectly see his face; for oh indeed
sweet is his voice, and his countenance is very comely; oh my soul desires him
in the night season, and in the morning I seek him early; but oh I cannot find
him whom my soul loves, for he has withdrawn himself from me, and that is the
cause of my leanness, coldness, barrenness and unfruitfulness to Godward which
is the cause of my sorrow, tears, sighing, groaning, mourning, and walking
dejected all the day long.

Oh indeed there was a time once when my beloved kn^cked at the door of my
heart, saying again and again, open, open, unto me; my head is wet with dew,
and my locks filled with the drops of the night; open, open unto me and let me
in; but oh wo's me I was gotten into a bed of false ease and wrong security,
and was loath to come out; but I made excuses and said, I have put off my coat,
how shall I put it on, I have washed my feet how shall I defile them, etc. and
I lingered so long as that my beloved withdrew himself; and at last I rose (in
my own time not when he called) to open to my beloved, and he was gone, and
then I called him, but he did not answer me, I sought him but did not find him,
and oh now my bowels, my bowels is even pained for him, and my soul pants
after him even as the heart pants after the water brooks; Oh that I could but
find him whom my soul loves, oh I would hold him, I would hold him fast, I
would not let him go; he should lie all night in my bosom, I would be watchful
and diligent that I grieve him not, and very fearful of displeasing of him; and
would take heed of giving him any cause whereby to leave me, and thus to hide
his face from me; but oh alas for me, when shall I find him, when will he come
whom I long for? Oh when, when shall I have my full enjoyment of him? oh when
will he bring me into his banqueting house, and his love be even as a banner
over me, his left hand under my head, and his right imbrasing of me, staying me
with flagons, comforting me with apples, making me sick of love, giving me of
his spised Wine, and of the juice of his Pomgranets; oh if thus I could come to
enjoy him whom my soul loves, then would all tears be wiped away from mine
eyes, and I forget my sorrow because of joy and gladness, and then should I
look no more sorrowful; but should rejoice as Hannah did, and say oh my heart
rejoices in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in the Lord, and my mouth is
enlarged over my enemy (who said unto me I should be always barren and
unfruitful) because I rejoice in his salvation, who has regarded my low
estate; oh now I the barren shall bear seven, and she who has had many
Children wax feeble, now I the parched ground become a Pool, and I the dry has
springs of water, now I the soletary place rejoice, and I the desert blossom as
a Rose; I the poor one made rich, and I the weak one made strong, I the foolish
one made wise, I the empty one overflow with fullness; now the days of my sore
mourning turned into joy, and the nights of my sorrow turned into pleasure, and
the seasons of my seeking him whom my soul loves turned into times of sweet
reposes with him in his bed of solace: But oh alas for me, I may speak of
these things, but oh when, when will it be thus with me? oh how long shall I
wait, how long shall I seek, how long shall I call and utter my voice weeping,
saylng oh come away, come away unto me, thou whom I mourn for, whom I long
after, whom my soul loves; oh I have waited so long that I am weary, and begin
to be almost without hope of his coming any more unto me: Well what shall I do,
and whether shall I go, I will even lay me down in sorrow, and make it my bed,
and make grief my sheets, and tears my pillow, and sighing and mourning my
sleep until he come whom my soul loves; for verily I cannot, I cannot be
satisfied with another besides him.

Oh who amongst the sons and daughters of Men shall I make my moan unto? unto
whom shall I complain and ease my heart unto? where shall I find one who is
sensible of my condition, that can simpathize with me, and that can speak a
word in season unto my poor soul, oh is it thus with any as it is with me? Yes,
yes, I believe there is many has been, and many now are in thy condition: Oh
where may I find one of them that I might ease my heart unto him, and spread my
condition before him; for oh verily my bowels is very open to those who be in
my condition; well, have patience, be quiet and be still, and lend an ear unto
me, and I may speak a little how it is with me, and it may be (if the Lord
will) to thy comfort; for oh truly my soul loves thee, oh my heart is moved
with compassion toward thee, oh my bowels, my bowels is open unto thee, and my
soul greatly simpathize with thy soul, and could even wish my soul (for a time)
in thy souls stead; oh though indeed I am but a Child, yet truly I am in some
measure sensible of thy condition, and can read it by my own; and oh how
willingly would I help thee according to my ability; oh truly methinks I would
even be a help unto all who stand in need of help, but especially unto thee
thou poor soul, what art thou poor, so am I; what art thou weak and feeble, so
am I oftentimes; what art thou empty, so am I oftentimes; what art thou cold
and barren, so am I sometimes; what art thou as one desolate and destitute, so
am I sometimes; what does thou eat thy bread weeping, and mingle thy drink with
thy tears, it is so with me at sometimes when I want the enjoyment of him whom
my soul loves, for truly it is with me sometimes as it is with thee; for
sometimes I have not the enjoyment of my beloved as I have at other times, but
sometimes he seems to be withdrawn and to hide his face from me, oh then it is
with me as it is with thee; oh then sorrows take hold upon me, and trouble
surroundeth me about as a wall, and mourning covers me as a garment, and none
sees my tears but the Lord; oh then my leanness, my leanness, my coldness and
barrenness is my greatest burden, which causes me to go bowed down in spirit,
saying in my heart, Oh whether is my beloved gone, and what is the cause he
has withdrawn himself from me; wherefore is it thus with me, what is the
matter, what shall I do, what will the Lord leave me, what will my God forsake
me, what will the Lord now cast me off who has done so much for me? Oh what is
the cause that it is thus with me? wherefore is the windows of Heaven shut up,
and the shoures of refreshment from on high withheld from me? oh once I could
say the Lord is my shepherd, and my soul does not want; he causes me to feed,
and even to lie down in green Pastures, and leads me by the still waters, and
spreads my table with dainties, and anointeth my head with the oil of
gladness, and causes my cup to overflow with new Wine: But oh alas for me
now, I am in a dry and thirsty land where no water is; oh what has the Lord
cast me off for ever; Oh my tears is my meat and drink, whilst my enemy says
unto me where is thy God, do thou think he will ever appear again unto thee,
why do thou thus hunger, thirst, cry and pant after him; alas it is in vain
for thee to wait for him; once indeed thou had the enjoyment of him, once thou
went with the multitude with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy
and praise with a multitude that keep holy day; but alas thou must not look
for such a day again: And thus the adversary of my soul endeavors to add
sorrow to my sorrow, and to increase the weight of my burden, that so I might
sink and never rise; But oh the Lord my God is near to help me, even in that
time when I can scarce perceive him, and when I am (as Peter was) ready to
sink, then his invisible arm of mercy is ready to save me, and a secret hope
the Lord preserves alive in me, which is as an anchor unto my soul, which
keeps me from suffering shipwreck, a hope that the Lord will appear again to me
to my joy, whereby some encouragement I feel stirring in me to wait upon the
Lord patiently, and to trust in him, though I do not see him, and to rely upon
him and hope in his tender bowels when he seems to be far off me, and to roll
my self upon him, and surely he will appear again to thy joy oh my soul, who
can not be satisfied without his presence, even the presence of the Lord thy
God which thou desires more then all things else whatsoever; wherefore the
Lord seeing it is so with thee that thou desires his presence more then all
other things; surely, surely he will not cast thee off for ever, surely he will
appear again to thy joy, wherefore why art thou so much cast down oh my soul,
and why art thou thus disquieted within me? oh hope, hope thou in thy God, for
thou shall yet praise him, the Lord will yet again command his loving kindness
in the day time, and in the night season, his song shall be with thee, even
praises to the God of thy life; oh wait patiently upon the Lord, and trust in
the living God, whose compassions fails not toward those who loves him; oh he
will send out his light and his truth into thee again, and it shall bring thee
unto his holy hill and to his Tabernacle, and then shall thou go to the altar
of God, of God thy exceeding joy, and upon thy harp shall thou praise the Lord
thy God, thy delight and joy, oh it is good for thee both to hope and quietly
to wait upon the Lord, for the Lord is good to the man that waits upon him,
unto the soul which seeks him, and cannot be satisfied without him; oh wait
patiently upon him even as a servant waits upon his Master, and as a maiden
at the hand of her Mistress, so do thou wait for the Lord, and even as the
Husbandman who sows his seed in the Earth has long patience for it until he
receives the early and latter rain; so do thou wait patiently upon the Lord
who will be unto thee as the early and latter rain in due season; wait upon
him, he who is to come, will come, and will not tarry, and his reward will be
with him, even fullness of joy, comfort, peace, rest, and sweet satisfaction
unto thee oh my soul.

Oh my soul, oh my soul, surely, surely, the Lord will never leave thee nor
forsake thee if thou forsake him not; indeed he may seem to hide his face from
thee for a time, but without doubt he will appear again to thy comfort, who
cannot live without him oh my soul, the Lord hears thee often saying in
secret, alas what is the glory of the world unto me, what is the honor and
praise of the world to me, what is the favors friendship and estemation of the
world to me, what is the vanity, vain sports, delights and pleasures of the
sons and daughters of Men to me? oh surely all these things are but as dross
and dung unto me, in comparison of the Lord my God who is the fountain of
everlasting joy, delight, and pleasure; oh if I enjoy him fully I have enough;
he is the joying of my heart, the rejoicing and glading of my spirit, the
strength of my rains, the girdle of my lines; wherefore how can I live without
him; oh my soul the Lord intends good unto thee by all his dealings with thee,
if he withdraw for a time and hide his face from thee for a season, it is
thereby to let thee see what thou art without him, how poor, how weak, how
feeble, how foolish, how empty, how dead, how dry, how cold, how barren and
unfruitful art thou without the Lord, that so thou being made truly sensible of
thy own weakness and inability may be the more sensible of the needfulness of
the supporting power, and upholding arm and saving grace of the Lord thy God,
and the more to rely and depend upon the Lord; oh my soul through the Lords
withdrawing his presence from thee thou comes the more to know what the want of
his presence is, and coms to learn to prize the sweet enjoyment of his presence
the more, and to hold him fast and cleave unto him, and to be very vigilent and
careful, thou does not grieve him, nor do the thing that may cause him to
withdraw himself from thee oh my soul. Oh my soul, thou must learn to know how
to want, and how to abound, how to be full, and how to be empty, how to be
rich, and how to be poor, and in every condition to be content, and not to
murmur against the Lord; the Lord can open and none can shut, and he can shut
and none can open; the Lord can open the windows of Heaven, and shour down
abundantly upon thee oh my soul, and even make a plenty in thy land, even cause
thy store to abound with corn, and thy Fats overflow with new wine; and he can
also shut up the windows of heaven for a time, and make a famine in thy Land if
he pleases, and thou must not say unto him (in a murmuring way) why deals
thou thus with me? for indeed he may do what he will do, and yet all his doings
are just and righteous altogether, and in all his dealings with thee, he thy
dear, tender nursing Father, intends good unto thee, oh my soul. Oh my soul,
when the fountain opens, and the great deep overfloweth, and fills thee with
plenty of things needful for thee, even then oh my soul dread and fear thou
before the Lord, and take heed of being lifted up in heart, of being puffed up
in mind, of being exalted in spirit, and beware of a false ease and wrong
liberty and false security, which may soon steal upon thee at such a time, when
thou art rich, wise, strong, and full enough in thy own eyes, if thou do not
abide upon the watch and dread the Lord, and drink the draughts of joy in the
pure fear and trembling, never departing therefrom, in what ever thou enjoy of
the Lord, or receive from the Lord, or do and suffer for the Lord, keeping low
in heart, meek in mind, humble in soul, tender in bowels, contrite in spirit,
and then oh my soul thou art in a safe condition, truly my soul when thou
appears wise, strong, rich and full enough in thy own eye, even then thou art
rather in greater danger then when thou appears weak, poor and empty in thy
own eyes, although thou art not then without danger, but has cause to fear and
watch in all conditions; oh my soul when thou appears weak, poor and feeble
in thy own eyes, even then take heed of distrust and doubting, but hold fast
thy trust in the Lord, and let thy confidence in his name be firm, and thy
hope in his tender bowels be sure, and constantly rely and depend upon him,
and honor him in believing in him, and if he kill thee, yet trust thou in him,
and never leave him; for alas whether should thou go, he has the word of
eternal life, who is worthy to be glorified, magnified, honored and praised,
feared, served, loved and obeyed for ever, and forever more: Oh my soul thou
dearly loves thy Fathers Children; oh the Lord knows how near and dear his
dear babes and tender lambs are unto thee oh my soul; oh thou knows them in
the spirit of love, wherein thou delights to embrace them (even those whom
(outwardly) thou never saw) and (in spirit) to clasp them about, and kiss them
with a kiss of peace, and hug them in the bosom of indearedness; ah thy bowels,
thy bowels is open unto them, and thy love is dear indeed toward them as the
Lord thy God knows; and oh that love might abound in thee more and more, and
in the hearts of all the children of Light, it may abound one toward another,
as in days past, and years which are gone, that it may appear to all, we are of
God who is love, and that we all are true disciples of Christ, in that we love
one another, not only in show and in word, but in deed and in truth, loving one
another fervently with a pure heart.

Oh my soul, thou desire to simpathize with thy Fathers Children; in their
trials, sufferings and afflictions; and (in spirit) to bear a part with them
therein; oh thou desire, even to mourn with them that mourn, and to weep
with them that weep in secret; and to rejoice with them that rejoice, and to
travel in spirit, with and for the Travelers to Sion, and with the Travelers
in Sion, and to watch with those Watchmen, which the Lord has set (upon the
walls of Jerusalem, who for Sions sake cannot be still, and for Jerusalems
sake, cannot hold their peace; who cease not to cry day and night to the Lord,
and can give him no rest, until he establish Jerusalem, and make her a praise
in the whole Earth for ever more.

Oh my soul, be watchful and wary, that thou do not in the least degree, seek
glory, honor, and praise to thy self; and to be had in esteem by others; but oh
wait to feel self, wholly baptized into death, and made of no reputation; and
take heed that thy left hand, know not, what thy right hand does; and do
nothing to be seen of men, or whereby to be accounted of by others; but in all
thou does, appeal unto him, who sees in secret; and he it is, who will reward
thee openly; seek thou to be only known, and manifested, to the pure un-erring
witness of God, in all consciences; and to stand justified and approved by it,
and that is enough; no honor, no glory, no praise, but to God alone, oh strive
not, for Lordship, and Mastership over others; but rather strive to be most
meekest, lowest, humblest, tender and contrite in mind, and spirit,
condescending even to the lowest, and serving the meanest, in love; seeking
peace, and unity among brethren, with all self-denial; bearing, forbearing,
and forgiving for the Seeds sake; bearing with the infirmities of the weak, and
with the haltings of the feeble, watching for the good, in all, without respect
of persons; but not to watch for evil, in any, for that is abominable, in the
eyes of the Lord; and seek thou the glory of God alone, the honor of his name;
the exaltation and spreading forth of his truth; the freedom, growth, and
reign of the Seed of God, in the hearts of all; the prosperity of his tender
Lambs, Babes and Children, that they may all stand, in this day of trial; and
be preserved in this hour of darkness, and temptation; and even to seek the
good of all; yea the good of thy greatest Enemies, and have nothing but love
and good will toward thy greatest Persecuters; seeking the salvation of all
people, but not the destruction of any.

And oh my soul, be circumspect, and vigilent, to walk so as becomes the
Gospel, and thee to be an adorning to the truth of God; and to be as an holy
example, and righteous pattern unto all people, where ever I come, that I may
be unto the Lord, as a sweet smell, and delectable savor, that the blessing of
the Lord my God, may be poured down upon me, yet more and more, that I might
become fruitful unto the Lord my God, and be an instrument in his hand amongst
the Sons and Daughters of Men, to the praise, glory, honor, and renown of the
Lord Almighty, for ever more; oh my soul, watch and fear, before the Lord, and
take heed thou do not that thing to please others, which thou know is not
approved by the Lord; keep thy eye unto the Lord, and look not out at others,
to walk by imitation, and if thou sees him or her, one or another, what ever
they be accounted of; do those things, which the Lord allows thee not to do;
do not thee do them, because an other does them; but watch and keep close unto
the Lord, and take counsel of him.

Oh my soul, do not judge, or justify those things, which thou has not a true
discerning in; because an other judges or justifies them, but rather be passive
in that matter, and stand still and wait upon the Lord for a perfect
understanding in all things.

Oh my soul, seek not liberty to the flesh, beware of that, counted freedom,
which is indeed bondage, which has stolen upon many in their latter days; oh
my soul, endeavor to put off those things, which in their place, are said to
be lawful, which are a means to hinder thy growth into the Eternal: and oh,
walk wisely before all Men, giving no offense to the Jew nor Gentile, nor to
the Church in God, knowing that there is that, which is lawful, but not
expedient; there is that which is lawful, but it edifies not; wherefore forbear
what may be forborne; and yet be not brought under the power of any thing below
the life, but seek after those things, which make for edification, love, peace
and unity; for God is the Author of peace, and not the Author of confusion,
strife, contention and debate; Oh my soul, thou does greatly desire, that I
might not appear, in the sight of any of the Lords Lambs, and little ones; to
be more, then what I really am in and through the grace of God, by which I am
what I am, and his grace which he has freely bestowed upon me has not been in
vain, praises to his name for ever; Oh I would not be accounted of by any
little one to be more then what I am in the Lord, but rather let me be hid,
least honor should be ascribed unto that, unto which it does not belong; for
indeed all honor belongs to God alone; alas all flesh is as grass, and what
is Man, he is but a Vessel wherein God may appear or disappear as he pleases,
and indeed the Lord is jealous of his glory, and he will not give it unto
another; wherefore my soul seek the glory, honor and praise to God alone, unto
whom only it is due for ever and ever more. Oh my soul, thou does not want the
love, the dear unfeigned love of the Lords dear babes, tender lambs and
children, and oh thou desires thou may not want their prayers for thee oh my
soul, that I may be preserved in this day of trial, and be enabled by the Lord
to finish my Testimony for him to his praise and my comfort, joy and peace for
ever more.

Oh my soul fear thou before the living God, and very diligently take heed
least thou who stand'st should fall as several has done, to their own woe, and
to the dishonor of God, and to the causing his unchangable Truth to be evil
spoken of, and many seekers after Righteousness to stumble, and the hands of
Sions enemies thereby strengthened against the faithful of the Lord, w^ose
hearts are made sad, whom the Lord has not made sad; even in the sense of the
sad condition of those, who once in some measure were acquainted with the Lord,
once tasted of his goodness, and graciousness, of his sweet unspeakable love
and peace, and even in some measure, tasted and handled of the word of life;
and of the Powers of the World to come; who were delivered out of spiritual
Egypt, by an outstretched Arm, and Mighty Power, and by the same power carried
through the Spiritual sea and wilderness, and did in measure eat of the
spiritual meat and drink of the Spiritual Rock which was made unto them as a
pillar of fire by night, and a pillar of a cloud by day, etc. and yet behold
they are drawn back again by the enemy of their soul, through their yielding
unto his temptations, and receiving his proffers, and are turned as the Dog to
his vomit, and as the sow that was washed to her wallowing again in the mire;
and has even made shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, and are proved
treacherous children, denying their father who begat them, and casting off
their mother who traveled in pain to bring them forth, and hating the womb that
bore them, and paps which gave them suck, and this has come upon them through
carelessness and sloathfulness, and through reasoning and consulting with the
enemy of their souls, and through looking at the trouble, trial, sufferings,
streights, and difficulties which appeared in their way, and through lusting
after the flesh pots of Egypt through looking back into the ease, pleasure,
riches and honor of this world, which has carried them away captive again
into Egypt into the house of bondage again; wherefore oh my soul watch, watch
and stand fast in that liberty which the truth Christ the power of God has
brought thee into, and take heed thou be not again entangled with the yoke of
bondage.

Oh my soul if there be some who once were fresh, green, tender living and
fruitful unto God, who now has lost their freshness, greenness, tenderness and
fruitfulness toward God, and now coldness, deadness, and barrenness is come
upon them to Godward, and their love and zeal for the Lord waxed cold; Oh my
soul if it have thus happened unto some, oh how can thou but fear before the
Lord, oh my soul least the same should happen unto thee also.

And if some there be whose minds are gotten into a full liberty, and are at
ease in the flesh, living above the cross of Christ Jesus, which crucifies to
the world, and are grown careless and negligent, spending their time often with
vain talking, foolish jesting, and needless communication, who formerly spent
their time in waiting upon the Lord in meditating and exercising themselves in
the things of God, being very watchful over their thoughts, words, works and
actions, having the pure fear of the Righteous God fresh in their hearts,
standing in awe of him always, least they should sin against him in thought,
word and deed, lying down and rising up in his pure fear, eating and drinking,
and doing all things in the pure fear of the Lord, knowing a stay to their
minds, a stop to their thoughts, a bridle to their tongues, a watch before
their mouth, and a fearing in their hearts, least they should not be watchful
enough over their lives and conversations, yea even over their very carriage
and gesture, their words being very few, sober and savoury, even savouring of
the grace of God in their hearts, they desiring and endeavoring very
diligently to walk so as that they might in life, carriage and conversation be
as holy patterns and righteous examples of love, of peace, of holiness and
purity, of meekness and lowliness, of tenderness and pity, of mercy and
compassion, of patience and long suffering, of sobriety and gentleness, etc.
that so they might walk as becomes Saints, blameless and harmless, as sons of
God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among
whom to shine as lights to the adorning of the truth of God professed by them,
and to the glory, honor and praise of the Lord God, and to the joy, comfort,
refreshment, peace and consolation of their own souls: Oh this condition which
once they were in was very sweet, blessed and happy; and if now they have in
measure lost this sweet condition, and so in measure are departed from their
first love, and grown careless and negligent, puffed up with knowledge without
life, which only keeps humble, satisfying themselves with talking of what they
formerly enjoyed of the Lord, and of what they have done and suffered for the
Lord, etc. I say if it be thus with some, then oh my soul in the sense of what
is come upon them, how can thou but fear, dread and tremble in heart before the
Lord, not in the least measure or degree to watch for evil in any, or to have
an eye open to spy out the nakedness of another, or to take an occasion against
them because of their failings and haltings, or being b^sie in looking at
others conditions; and in keeping their Vinyards and neglect the keeping of thy
own: Nay, nay, oh my Soul, let it not be so with thee; but if thou (as thou
sets in thy habitation without desiring at all to look abroad at others)
sees that it has and is happened unto many according as is forementioned;
then oh my soul only let it be as a warning unto thee the more to fear before
the Lord, and to be the more watchful in the light, and to keep closer unto the
Lord, least the same things should happen unto thee oh my soul as has happened
unto them; unto whom let thy tenderness extend, and thy dear love abound with
secret cries, and strong groanings unto the Lord thy God on their behalfes, and
on thy own behalf, that thou may be kept and preserved unto the end: Oh alas
for thee my poor soul, how weak art thou, and how unable to stand as of thy
self; wherefore cleave, cleave, and keep close unto the Lord, thy tender
compassionate God, and then assuredly the Lord will cleave unto thee, and will
not leave thee oh my soul; wherefore lift up thy head in the strength of the
Lord, and look up unto the holy one, whose dwelling is on high in the holy
place; and with thee oh my soul, as thou art kept humble in heart, contrite in
spirit, meek in mind, and trembles at his word: and look not at thy own
weakness, feebleness and inability, but keep thy eye unto the Lord, and trust
in his name, rely and depend upon his arm, and hope in his tender bowels; who
makes the poor rich, the weak strong, the simple wise; wait thou patiently
upon him, and look not out at the greatness of others measures; neither look
thou at the smallness of thy own, least faintness, weariness, and
discouragement should thereby come in upon thee, and thou murmur because thy
measure is no greater, but be thou contented, and truly satisfied with thy
portion, and be faithful unto the Lord in thy measure, and being faithful in
the little, thou shall be made ruler over much, and enter into the joy of the
Lord, wait upon him, who has freely given in thee what thou has of him, and
he can give thee more; there was nothing in thee (that was of thee) which
induced the Lord to communicate that measure of his fullness unto thee which he
has dispensed to thee, but of his own mere mercy, tender love and free grace,
who of his own free will has begotten thee again unto a living hope, so that
thou right well knows that it is not he that wills nor he that runeth, but
God who shows mercy; Oh thou had not awakened out of the sleep of sin and
corruption, had not the mighty God thundered from his dwelling place upon thee
and awakened thee oh my soul, surely thou had never been raised out of the dust
of sin, and grave of iniquity had not the Lord of his own free will raised thee
up, and brought thee forth by his own Almighty power; Oh my soul surely thou
had never as (as of thy self) turned unto the Lord, had not the Lord of his own
free will turned thee, and after thou was turned thou repented, and after thou
was afflicted thou smote upon thy thigh, yea thou was confounded because thou
bore the shame of thy youth; and surely my soul after the Lord had turned thee
in measure unto him, thou had not followed him in the narrow and strait way,
through the Cross in the self denial, had not the Lord thy God drawn thee after
him by the cords and woings of his tender love; and surely thou had turned back
again from the Lord into the mire and dirt again, and had never stood until
this hour, but must have fainted and dyed ere this day, had not the Lord of his
own free will kept thee, preserved thee, upheld thee, and supported thee by his
own almighty power, whose grace has been sufficient for thee, both in the day
of prosperity, and in the day of adversity, in the time of trial, in the hour
of temptation; and so let all flesh be silent in thee oh my soul, and the Lord
only exalted, and the boaster for ever excluded, and God alone have the glory,
and self wholly slain, and the Lord alone honored and praised, and his
unspeakable love and free grace admired, and his holy name feared and obeyed,
by whose grace thou art what thou art, and his grace bestowed upon thee has
not been in vain; blessed, blessed be the Lord, and pure, holy praises to him,
and glory, and Halleluiah to him in the highest, Amen says my soul. Oh Lord
what was I, and what was my Fathers house, I was neither a Prophet nor a
Prophets son; what was I, that the King of glory should cast his eye upon me,
even when I laid as among the pits; what was I that he should hold forth the
scepter unto me, and I should find favor in his sight, who regarded my low
estate, and raised me out of the dust, and brought me from off the dunghill to
sit among Princes.

Oh my soul the Lord has done much for thee since the day he formed thee in
the womb, and brought thee forth for his praise; he has made the crooked
things strait before thee, and rough smooth, and mountains he has laid low
before thee, and removed many a hill out of thy way, and he has made a way for
thee in the Wilderness, and a path through many a thicket, he has lopt the
bough with terror, and the great one of stature has been hewn down, he did
cut up the thicket of the Forest with Iron, and Lebanon did fall by a mighty
one; oh he has made the hard things easy unto thee; oh how has his love made
thee willing to bow thy neck to the yoke, and to take up the Cross, and totally
to despise the shame, and to follow the Lamb through some trials and
tribulations, whose love has drawn thee after him, whose love has (as it
were) made thee to forget thy Fathers house; Oh how has his love caused me to
cast off other lovers, and to love the Lord my God, who is now become my
treasure, and my heart is with him; so that if I be shut up in prison, if I
enjoy him; oh then days, months and years may pass over my head, and time is
not thought long nor sufferings hard, because of the enjoyment of the presence
of the Lord my treasure, whom my soul loves, for whose sake I am willing to
suffer; whose pure sweet refreshing comfortable presence makes a prison
delightsome to me; praises, pure living praises to my God for ever, who has
been with me in six troubles, and in the seventh he has not left me; he is my
buckler, my shield, my strength, my Rock, my safe guard, my strong t^wer;
wherefore I Will not fear the threats of the wicked, neither regard the cruelty
of the ungodly, nor heed the purposes of my enemy; nor mind the d^terminations
of unrighteous men, through the strength of my God I will not fear, though the
Earth be removed and carried into the midst of the Sea; and though the
mountains shake through the swelling thereof; though the Heathen rage, and the
people imagine vain things, and the Rulers take council against me, I Will not
fear what Man can do unto me, for the Lord is with me, and I shall not be
moved; and the Lord will help me, and that right early; yet alas for me poor,
poor worm, I am but a child weak and feeble, but indeed having had great
experience of the love of my God, and of his tender fatherly care over me, how
can I but confidently trust, hope, rely and depend upon the Lord my God,
believing that he the mighty one will enable me the weak one to wade through
and endure those trials he pleases to exercise me withal; who through his love
and mercy has caused my trials to work for my good praises to his name for
ever more; who has nine times delivered me out of the hands of unreasonable
men, out of their prisons and holes, where I have suffered for the Testimony of
my God, through his enabling of me without murmuring against him; praises unto
him alone; no honor, no honor, no glory, but unto God says my soul, who has
kept me by his power from bowing to the Beast, or drinking of the Whores Cup;
pure praises to my dear God for ever more, who will free me once again from
bonds in his own time. I am willing to wait thy season oh my God, who art with
me; and oh let me never depart from thee oh Lord, and then I know thou will
never leave me, but thou will be my God to help me still, and to support me
still, and to comfort me still, and refresh me still, and quicken me still, and
to feed me still with bread from Heaven, fresh Manna morning by morning, and
give me to drink of the River of thy pleasure daily; who wilt enable me to
stand faithful to thee unto the end of my days, that I may finish my Testimony
for thee, thy name and truth in this thy day, even with joy, and lay down my
head in peace, in thy tender bosom of endless love oh my tender God, and
therein repose with thy dear Children for evermore; and have my full
satisfaction of love in thee, thou fountain of Love, and therein fetch my full
breath for ever more; Oh let it be so, oh let it be so, oh my dear God for thy
own seed sake, to thy own praise thou holy one, who is worthy, worthy of all
glory, glory, honor and everlasting thanksgiving, and pure living praises for
ever, and ever more, Amen, Halleluiah, glory and eternal renown to the almighty
one in the highest, Amen.

Oh my soul thou dearly loves the whole Flock of God wherever they are
scattered upon the face of the Earth; oh thou greatly desires their prosperity
and tranquillity, and that the Lord may prosper and bless them with all
Spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus: Oh the Lord God keep all his Children
every where in this hour and power of darkness, and preserve all his dear babes
and tender lambs in this day of great trial and manifold temptation; Oh the
Lord keep all those who make mention of his name in sincerity and truth, from
bowing in the least degree unto the Beast, and from drinking the least drop of
the Whores cup, although she should be permitted to drink their blood; Oh the
Lord God almighty keep his sheep and lambs who were once scattered abroad, in
the cloudy dark day, whom he has sought and found out, and gathered out of the
desert places, and wast howling Wilderness, whom he has brought from off the
barren mountains and dry heaths into the low, low, low fresh green Valley,
where the pure sweet refreshing consolating springs of life eternal
encompasseth them about; Oh the Lord keep them still and quiet, minding their
feeding, and not at all heed the raging of the Sea, nor regard the unmercyful
waves thereof, which often looks very high, as if they would quite overflow the
valley of the low places, and drown all who flee not unto the mountains for
refuge and safety; but oh let not the sheep and lambs, and little ones fear,
nor at all flee to the hills for refuge, for behold the Lord the high and
mighty one, the holy one of Israel is their Shepherd, and he even continually
watches over them, and greatly cares for them, and he it is who has given
bounds to the raging Sea, and he limits the proud waves thereof, and shuteth up
her floods as he pleases; he can let forth the wind, and suffer a storm, and
he can make a calm when he pleases, he can cause the sea and the wind to obey
him; and therefore the Children of God need not to fear none besides the Lord,
who will suffer nothing to befall them but what shall work for good to all his
chosen faithful ones; wherefore it is good for all the Children of the Lord
confidently to trust in the Lord and not at all fear, though their enemies
pursue hard after them, and say in their hearts, come, come, we will pursue
them, we will overtake them, our lusts shall be satisfied upon them, we will
have the desire of our hearts concerning them, we will draw our swords, and our
hands shall destroy them, and we will try whether their Gods (in whom they say
they trust) be able to deliver them from the stroke of our hands; well let not
Israel heed the boasting and threatenings of his enemies; nor regard the
purposes of his adversaries, though they pursue hard after him, and say we will
bring them back again into Egypt, or else we will totally destroy them; yet let
not Israel fear, for the Lord his God is between him, and his enemies, and
fights for him against his adversaries, and he in his anger will look down upon
them, and trouble their host, and take off their Chariot wheels, and will blow
in his wrath upon them, and the sea of his righteous indignation shall cover
them, and they shall sink as lead in the bottom of his righteous Judgments, and
he will get himself a name through the destruction of Sions enemies, and honor
and magnify himself through the deliverance of his chosen, who will work
wonders for the sake of his Redeemed, in so much as the Dukes of Edom shall be
amazed, and even trembling shall take hold upon the mighty men of Moab, and all
Nations shall shiver and quake before the mighty God of Israel, who is dreadful
in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders: Oh let Israel honor his God in
believing in him, and in trusting in his name, in relying and depending upon
his arm of everlasting strength, and patiently without murmurings to wait upon
the Lord, for he that is to come will come, and will not tarry, whose work is
before him, and his reward is with him, even joy for the mourners in Sion, and
beauty for ashes, gladness for the heavy hearted in Jerusalem, freedom for
bondage, freedom from weights, burdens and grievous oppressions.

Oh let all the Children of the Lord wait without fainting upon the Lord, for
yet a little while and the voice will be heard, saying rejoice, oh rejoice, and
even sing for joy ye saints, servants, and prophets of the most high, and
triumph in the Lord Almighty over the beast and false prophet, and over the
Whore which has corrupted the Earth, who has long set as a queen, and said in
her heart, she should never see sorrow, with whom the Nations of the Earth has
committed fornication, and she has made Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People
drunk with the wine of her fornication, who has long deceived the Nations with
her golden cup which has been filled with abominations, and in her is found
all the blood of the Martyrs, and servants of Jesus, which has been shed upon
the earth, and she has rid upon the beast that rose out of the Sea, who
received his seat, great power and authority from the Dragon, who persecuted
the true woman that was clothed with the sun, and had a crown of twelve Stars
upon her head, who sought to devour her Man child, and made war against the
remnant of her seed, who keep the commands of God, and have the Testimony of
Jesus, these cannot worship the beast nor his name, nor receive his mark, but
these worship God alone, and are followers of the Lamb through many
tribulations, whose garments are made white in his blood, by whom they are
redeemed from amongst men, these the Beast and false Prophet have sought, to
kill, persecute and root out from off the face of the earth; but woe, woe, woe, to
the beast, false prophet, and the Whore, for the day of their Judgment is come,
and misery, calamity, distress and destruction is coming upon them, and she the
mother of Harlots, the mother of Witchcrafts, the abominations of the earth
shall utterly be destroyed, and totally burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord
God Almighty who judges her, and now sing oh Heavens and rejoice ye who live
therein, over mystery Babylon the great, for it is fallen, it is fallen as a
mighty millstone into the bottom of the Sea, never more to arise again, Amen,
Halleluiah.

The Lord will thunder from Heaven upon thy enemies oh Sion, and will break thy
adversaries to pieces, and will give strength to thy King, and exalt the horn
of his Anointed, and he shall reign and rule, and prosper, and execute justice
and true judgment in the earth, in his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel
shall dwell safely, and sit under his own Vine, and none shall make him afraid;
then shall it be said to Jerusalem fear not, and to Sion, let not thy hands be
slack, the Lord in the midst of thee is mighty, he has saved thee, he has
set thee free from thy trouble, he will rejoice over thee with joy, he will joy
over thee with singing, then it shall be said, sing oh daughter of Sion, and
shout oh Israel, and rejoice with all thy heart oh daughter of Jerusalem, for
the Lord has taken away thy Judgment, he has cast out thy enemies, and thy
warfare is accomplished, and thy great travel is finished, and now thou shall
rest from thy labor, and they who has labored and mourned with thee and for
thee shall rejoice for joy with thee, and suck and be satisfied with the sweet
consolation of thy breast, and milk out and be delighted in the abundance of
thy glory; oh the Lord thy husband, thy maker, the God of hosts is his name,
will extend peace, joy, comfort, and everlasting refreshment as a mighty
stream, and endless consolation as a river; oh then shall they be comforted in
thee after their sorrow, and be born up upon thy sides, and dandles upon thy
knees; for as a woman comfort her only son, so will the Lord comfort
Jerusalem; in the sense whereof her Children shall rejoice, and their souls be
right glad, and flourish as an herb, and their spirit shall praise and sing
glory unto him who is Lord and King of Heaven and Earth, who is worthy, worthy
of all glory, praise and honor for ever, and for ever more, Amen says my soul.

The thing which the Lord has purposed must be accomplished in his season, and
the thing that he has determined must be fulfilled in despite of all the
powers of Darkness; Oh that all thy babes and lambs may willingly wait thy
appointed time oh Lord God almighty, oh dear God keep all thy people retire in
thy name, that so what ever thou suffer to befall their bodies, their souls may
be safe bundeled up in the bundle of Life, wrapped therein for ever more, for a
terrible day is like to be upon all flesh, and who can be able to abide it? Oh
dear God increase the patience of thy People, strengthen the faith of thy
Chosen; oh support the weak, and uphold the little ones, which cannot yet go
alone; oh that none of thy flock may faint, nor grow weary; oh that all thine
might stand in the day of trial, and be kept in the hour of temptation, and
borne up under all sufferings, that so in the end they may come forth as gold
seven times refined in the fire, that they may shine as stars in the firmament
of thy power, making mention of thy goodness, graciousness and kindness oh Lord
God Almighty, declaring of thy mighty acts, and sing of thy mercies and
wonderful doings, and glorify, magnify, honor and praise thee, thou mighty
everlasting powerful one, who art from all Eternity to all Eternity, whose
Throne is established of old, whose septer bears sway in Righteousness, whose
Kingdom is Everlasting glory and halleluiah to thee in the highest, for ever
and for ever mo^e, yea praises, praises, pure living praises every minute, be
rendered unto the Lord Almighty, says the soul of

William Bennit.

OH arise, arise, thou holy righteous seed of the Covenant of life eternal;
Arise, arise, thy Light is come, and the glory of thy God is risen upon thee;
Oh thou lovely one, Nations shall come to thy light, and Kings to the
brightness of thy rising; Ah thou beautiful one, thy Sons shall come from far,
and thy Daughters from the ends of the Earth; Arise, arise thou beautiful one,
who art altogether lovely: Oh how sweet is thy Love thou lovely one, oh how
excellent is thy Love thou choice one; oh thy love, thy love is more precious
then Rubies, more sweeter then honey, oh thy love is better then wine; Oh how
has thy love overcome the hearts of many, and wone them unto thee, oh thy love
draws many after thee; oh how does thy love cause many to cast off all their
other lovers to follow thee thou lovely one; oh thou art become unto many souls
(who loves thee thou lovely one) even the chiefest of ten thousands, whose
eyes are opened to see thy beauty, and to behold thy comeliness thou beautiful
one; oh thou art hid from the polluted, neither can the unclean behold thy
excellent beauty, the Vulterous eye cannot perceive thy Comeliness, nor they
who has eyes full of Adultery, and cannot cease from sin, and have hearts
exercised with covetous practices, and are gone a whoring after many Lovers; oh
from these thou art hid thou lovely one, even as a garden enclosed, as a spring
shut up as a fountain sealed from them: Oh arise thou choice one, and let thy
beauty appear unto those who yet has not seen thy beauty; and let them taste of
thy love, that so they may cast off all other Lovers, and follow thee; Cast of
all, and cleave unto thee with their whole hearts. Oh arise, arise thou beloved
one, and shine forth in thy excellent glory, that even the Nations may be
ravished with thy beauty, and Kingdoms overcome with thy love, and be drawn
after thee, that a blessing in thee they may obtain; Oh arise and let thy
fruitfulness appear thou p^ecious one, and let joy and gladness fill thy heart
thou lovely one, for the days of thy rejoicing is come and coming, and the days
of thy mourning is fleeing away; Oh thou beloved one thou has been even as a
woman fo^saken, and grieved in spirit, and few or none of the sons and
daughters of Men has looked upon thee with an eye of pity; Oh thou has been
as the Owl in the desert, and as the alone sparrow upon the house top, and as
the alone quail in the stuble fields, and as a Dove mourning alone without her
Mat; who has set solitary alone as in the Wilderness, and none among the sons
of Men to comfo^t thee, oh thou beloved one; thou has been like unto a man of
sorrow, and very deeply acquainted with grief, often smitten, often grieved
often afflicted, often wounded, often pierced and oppressed, even as a Cart
that is pressed with sheaves, and yet the sons and daughters of Men has
esteemed thee not, although indeed thou patient one thou has been wounded by
their transgressions, and grieved, smitten and p^e^ced, and bruised by their
iniquities, and has born the weight of their sins, and the burden of their
Transgressions, even while they like sheep have gone astray, every one
following his own way, and feasting themselves as for a day of slaughter,
whiles thou has been mourning because of the iniquity of the people; eating
and drinking and rising up to play, whiles thou has been weeping and groaning
in secret, because of the multitude of their transgressions, who has heaped
sin upon sin, and iniquity upon iniquity, and has loaded thee therewith, which
has been as an impress of ten thousands upon thee thou tender one, and unto
thee they had no regard, they took no notice of thy sorrow and burdens: But oh
thou beloved one, thy God, thy tender God, who loves thee with an Everlasting
love, took notice of thy sorrow, and he saw thy grief, and beheld thy sore
weights and burdens, and took cognizance of thy grievous oppressions, and he
heard the voice of thy weeping, and thy tears which thou dropped upon his
altar, laid in the view of the eye of his pitiful soul, and he beheld thy
great travel, and thy sighing and groaning ente^ed into his ears, and his
tender, tender bowels of infinite love, mercy, pity and everlasting compassion
was and is moved toward thee, and he has determined to comfort thee with an
everlasting comfort, thou patient suffering one, and the nights of thy sorrow
shall vanish away for ever, and the days of thy mourning shall be over. Oh thou
beloved one, lift up thy head, lift up thy head, in the st^ength of thy God,
and gird up thy loins with courage in the power of his might, for thy winter
is almost over and gone, and shall no more come, the storms are vanishing away,
and shall no more appear, the nipping frosts are dissolving by the Son of
Righteousness, who is arisen upon thee with healing in his wings; Ah lift up
thy voice like the sound of a Trumpet, and shout like the voice of a King, and
sing for joy thou beloved one, for thy spring is come thou lovely one, thy
summer is come thou lovely one, the singing of birds is come thou beautiful
one, and the voice of the Turtle is heard in thy land thou delicate and choice
one; let thy heart be filled with melody thou blessed one, who art clothed
with chastity, and keeps thy Virginity in the Chamber of Purity; oh thy
beloved is come and into his banqueting house he is bringing thee, where his
banner over thee is love, where he will stay thee with flagons, and comfort
thee with apples, and cause thee to drink of his spiced wine, and of the juice
of his Pomgranets; Oh rejoice thou in his love thou lovely one, for the days of
the glading of thy heart is come, thou tender one who has been tossed with
tempest and not comforted, thou has been termed desolate and forsaken, thou
has been as one barren and unfruitful; But now arise, arise, lengthen thy
cords, and strengthen thy stakes, and enlarge the curtains of thy habitation;
for lo thou fruitful one thou shall break forth on the right hand and on the
left, and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and thy offspring the people;
the North shall give up, and the South shall not keep back; they shall come
from the East, and from the West, and flock unto thee as Doves to the window;
thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters be nursed at thy sides, thou
shall cause many wast places to be builded, and many buildings to fall, and
desolate places to be inhabited, and inhabited places to be laid desolate, and
barren mountains to become fruitful vallys, and fruitful places to become
barren mountains, and the wilderness become a Vinyard of sweet Grapes, the
forest as a City of habitation, the parched ground to become a pool, and dry
heaths springs of water; oh arise, arise, thou beloved one, and let thy
fruitfulness be manifested to the Nations, break forth in thy excellent glory,
shine forth in thy glorious beauty as clear as the morning without clouds, fair
as the Moon, and bright as the Sun, that thou may appear as a royal Diadem in
the hand of the Lord, and as a Crown of glory in the hand of thy God, that far
off Nations may see thy beauty, and remote Kings may see thy excellent glory,
and be wone by thy love unto thee, that they who has hated thee may love thee,
because of thy love which did extend to them, even whilst they hated thee and
rejected the woings of thy love; oh my soul loves thee in thy love thou lovely
one; oh kiss me, kiss me, with the kisses of thy mouth, for thy love is better
then wine; oh thou beautiful one thy love overcomes my heart, thy love draws
me after thee; oh thou art pleasant unto me, thy presence is more desirable
then all things my heart can desire; oh if thou hide thy face thou bountiful
one then am I bowed down, for the smiles of thy comely countenance is the
rejoicing of my heart, and the glading of my soul, the refreshing of my spirit
as marrow to my bones, and st^ength to my reins; oh thou art my joy in sorrow,
my comfort in mourning, my help in need, my strength in weakness, my riches in
poverty, my bread in hunger, my water in thirst, my refuge from storms, my
shelter from heat, and as the shadow of a Rock to me in a weary land; oh how
can I but love thee in thy love thou lovely one, oh thou art my mother who has
traveled in great pain to bring me forth, thou art the womb that bore me, and
the paps that gives me suck, the cradle of my rest, and the bed of my repose;
oh can I forget thee, how can I forget thee who has done so much for me, even
that which no man could do; oh thou loved me first before I loved thee thou
lovely one, and with thy love thou woed me; and by thy love thou overcame my
heart and drew it after thee, and now thou amiable one, the desire of my soul
is unto thee, and unto the remembrance of thy love; oh my soul desires thee in
the night season, and in the morning I will seek thee early; thou art as a
cluster of Camphire, and as a bundle of Mirre unto me, thou shall lie all night
between my breasts; oh thou lovely one let me repose in thy bosom, and fould me
in thy arms; oh thy love, thy love overcomes my heart, thy beauty even makes
me sick of love; oh let me remember thy love more then Wine, it is the upright
loves thee, and it is the pu^e in heart who sees thy beauty, and beholds thy
excellent comel^ness, oh let thy love still draw me after thee, oh let me never
leave thee; oh that I may never forsake thee, nor be unmindful of thy love
which I have known to be st^onger then death, and him who has the power of
death; Oh thou art a tree of l^fe to those who takes hold on thee, and blessed
is every soul that retains thee: Oh thy ways are ways of pleasantness, and
all thy paths are green and delightsome to those who loves thee; oh in thee is
my rest, in thee is my peace, in thee is my joy, in thee is my comfort, in thee
obtain I blessing and happiness thou art my j^y, and the crown of my rejoicing
for ever and ever more; Oh wherefore hold me, hold me with thy love thou lovely
bl^ssed one, and let me never depart from thee, and then I know thou will never
depart from me, but I shall be thine and thou shall be mine in a perpetual
Covenant which never shall be broken; oh thou comely beautiful choice one, thy
riches is durable, for the glory, the glory, the glory of the Lord thy God is
thy dowry for ever more: Unto whom be ascribed all honor and glory, eternal
prais^s and r^nown, and everlasting d^minion for ev^rmore; so be it says my
soul, and Amen says my spirit; Oh come Lord Jesus come quickly and take unto
thy self thy great pow^^ to reign, for thou art worthy, worthy says my Soul;
glory to thee in the highest for ever more, Amen.
