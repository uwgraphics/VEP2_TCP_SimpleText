A Proclamation commanding the repair of Noblemen, Knights, and Gentlemen of
quality, unto their Mansion houses in the Country, there to attend their
services, and keep Hospitality.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, taking into his Royal consideration the
present state of the times, together with the great decay of Hospitality and
good housekeeping, which in former ages was the honor of this Nation, the too
frequent resort, and ordinary residence of Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
Knights and Gentlemen of quality, unto Cities and Towns, especially into, or
near about the Cities of London and Westminster, and the manifold
inconveniences which ensue by the absence of so many persons of quality and
authority from their Countries, whereby those parts are left destitute both of
relief and government, and the Cities and Towns, especially those of London
and Westminster, are ouerburthened with Inhabitants and R^siants, has thought
fit hereby to renew the course formerly begun by His dear Father of blessed
memory, and to publish and declare, and He does hereby publish and declare
His Royal will and pleasure to be, and does by these presents straightly
charge and command, as well His Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as also all
deputy Lieutenants, Justices of the Peace, and Gentlemen of quality, who have
Mansion houses in the Country, wherein they and their families have usually
dwelt, (except such as are of his Highness Privy Counsel, or bear Office
about the Persons or Courts of Himself, or of His dearest Consort the Queen)
that they and every of them, immediately upon the end of his present month of
November, depart from the Cities of London and Westminster, and other Cities
and places, with their families and servants, unto their several Countries to
attend their Service there, and to keep Hospitality, as appertains to their
degree and calling, and that they, nor any of them, make their abode in any
other Cities of Towns, where they shall live privately, but resort to their
Country houses and ordinary places of habitation, and there observe these
directions, upon pain, not only of his Majesty's most heavy indignation and
displeasure, and disablement to hold any such places of trust under his
Majesty, but also of such further censure and punishment, as may be inflicted
upon them for their disobedience, and contempt or neglect of this his Royal
Commandment, whereof, as his Majesty intends to take a strict and severe
account; So He does hereby require and command, as well the Lords, and others
of his Privy Counsel, as also his Attorney general, and all other his
Officers and Ministers, whom it shall any way concern, to take order, that all
such as shall offend, may receive condign punishment, without toleration or
conniuencie.

Given at Our Court at White Hall the eight and twentieth day of November, in
the third year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
