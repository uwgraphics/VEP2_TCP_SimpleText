By the king and the Queen,
WHere as by the Statute made in the second year of king Henry the fourth,
concerning the repressing of here sies, there is ordained and provided a great
punishment, not only for the aucthors, makers, and writers of books,
containing wicked doctrine, and erroneous and heretical opinions, contrary
to the catholyque faith, and determination of the holy church, and likewise
for their fautours and supporters, but also for such as shall have or keep any
such books, or wrytinges, and not make delivery of them to the Ordinary of
the dioces or his ministers within a certain time limited in the said
Statute, as by the said Statute more at lardge it does appear. Which act or
statute being by authority of parliament of late revived, was also openly
proclaimed, to the intent the subjects of the Realm upon such proclamation
should the rather eschew the danger and penaltye of the said Statute, and as

little regarded.

the same heresies and false doctrine, straytly charge, and command, that no
