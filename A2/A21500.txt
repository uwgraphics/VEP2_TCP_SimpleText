FOr as much as by credyble means it has been declared to the kings
majesty, that the french king, omittynge the duty and office of a good
christen prince (which is much to be lamented) has not only by a long time
and season aided the great Turk, common enemy to christendom, and also by
sundry ways and means encouraged procured and incited, and daily procures
the said Turk, to arrayse and assemble great armies and forces of war, to
enter and invade the same, which daily the said Turk attempteth and puts
in execution, to the great trouble perturbation and molestation of all good
christen princes and their subjects, and to the peril and danger of the
state of christen religion, and imminent destruction of the universal weal
and quiet of all christendom, if good and godly kings and princes, with the
aid and assistaunce of all christen people, should not spedily provide for
the defense and relief of the same: But also the said french king,
forgetting the greatte kyndnes gratuitie and manyfolde benefittes, exhibited
and mynistred to him by the kings most royal majesty our soueraygne lord,
by sundry ways and means in his great and extreme necessities, has by a
long season unkindly withholden and withdrawn from the kings hyghnes his
yearly pention, contrary to his leage oath and promise made for the same. The
arrerages whereof, besides the perpetual payment amounts to great sums of
money. And although the kings most royal majesty has been by a long time in
good hope and trust, that the said french king, with gentle and friendly
admonitions (which has not lacked) would not only have desisted from
intelligence with the said Turk: but also paid and satysfied the said
pencion. Yet nevertheless his hyghnes now perceiving, that the said french
king will not be induced by any gentle means, to honesty and reason, but
still persiste and be obstinate against his leage fydelitie oath and honor,
most specially considering the common cause of christendom, and next wayeng his
majesty's just title to the crown of France and other Dukedomes and dominions
unjustly withholden by the said french king, for recompense whereof the
said pencion was granted: Has therefore entered into a most christen and
strayte leage and amity with his good brother and perpetual alie the Emperors
majesty, who jointly together, as well for the causes aforesaid, as for other
good grounds and occasions towchyng their pryuate affairs, have intimate
war to the same french king, he first refusyng to receive their harroldes,
which were sent to him to offer honorable and reasonable conditions of peace,
which conditions have also been declared to the french kings ambassador
here resident, and no conuenyent nor reasonable answer made to the same: by
reason whereof the Emperor and kings maiestyes, being assuredly knytte and
constantly joined together, intend jointly to proceed in the wars against
the said french king, and never to cease the same, until he shall be
enforced, not only to desyste from the Turk and all his factions, but also
yield and render to either of them, all such ryghtes things and recompenses,
as to honor reason honesty and equity shall apperteyne. Wherefore like as the
kings majesty our sovereign lord has thought mete, to notify the premysses
unto al and singular his most loving and obedient subjects: So his hyghnes by
virtue of this his majesty's proclamation, does declare the said french king,
to be his highness ennemie, yeuing license and authority to every of his said
subjects, to use the said french king, and all those which depend upon him,
to their most advantage and commodity, as his majesty's ennemies, as has
in such like case heretofore been used and accustomed.

God save the king.
