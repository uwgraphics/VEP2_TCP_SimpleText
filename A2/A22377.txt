A Proclamation concerning the adiournement of the Parliament.
THe Kings most excellent Majesty, having taken into his Princely
consideration, that the infection of the Plague is at this present so generally
dispersed and spread abroad, in and about the Cities of London and Westminster,
as that the Parliament, late assembled at Westminster, could not without
manifest peril to the Lords Spiritual, and Temporal and Commons there
assembled, be continued there, so long as the necessity of the urgent and
important affairs of his Majesty and the whole Realm did require; Has
therefore caused the same to be adiourned from the City of Westminster, to be
holden at the City of Oxford, the first day of August next* And has thought
fit hereby to publish and declare the same to all such, whom it may in any wise
concern; Straightly charging and commanding hereby, as well all the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, as also all and every the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses, of all and every the Shires, Cities, and Boroughs within this Realm
of England, and all others whom it may concern, That they and every of them
do personally appear at the said City of Oxford, the said first day of
August now next ensuing, then and there to proceed in those weighty and urgent
affairs which shall be there handled, as shall be most expedient for the
general good of his Majesty and his Realms.

Given at Our Court at Oatlands, the twelfth day of July, in the first year of
Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save the King.

most Excellent Majesty. ANNO DOM. M.DC.XXV.
