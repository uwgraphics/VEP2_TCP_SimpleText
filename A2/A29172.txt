THE Great Point OF SUCCESSION DISCUSSED.

With a Full and Particular ANSWER To a late PAMPHLET, Entitled, A Brief
HISTORY OF Succession, etc.

LONDON, Printed for H. Rodes, next door to the Bear Tavern near Bride-Lane in
Fleetstreet, 1681.

THE Great Point OF SUCCESSION DISCUSSED. In a full ANSWER to a late PAMPHLET,
Entitled, A Brief History of the SUCCESSION, etc.
AMONGST all the spurious Brood the Press of late has so numerously spawned,
and wherewith the Town has been so immoderately pestered, perhaps there is
scarce a Pamphlet can pretend to have made a greater noise, or met with a more
general Applause than THE HISTORY OF THE SUCCESSION, etc. Insomuch that having
heard it so much and so often commended, and that some people had so great a
value for it, that they had taken the pains to get it without Book, I grew not
a little desirous of reading what I thought would not have had so welcome a
Reception, if it had not been penned with a great deal of Faithfulness and
Sincerity: for, though I must confess, I have no great opinion of an Argument
drawn from matter of Fact, since if that were once allowed a man of very
indifferent Parts, and as slender Reading, would find it no very difficult Task
to justify the blackest Villainies; yet I assured my self, that if our Author
did not industriously avoid being sincere and impartial, he could not but
conclude the Crown of England to have always gone in the Sacred Channel of
Birthright and proximity of Blood, and that uninterrupted too, unless put
violently out of its Course; either by some manifest Force from without, or
some prevailing Faction from within.

But alas! I soon perceived how mightily I was mistaken in the man; for I found
him in every Page taking so much pains to catch at every thing that might but
any way advance his Design, or seemed but to lean never so little toward his
opinion; and every where so deligedly wresting and mis-representing those
Authors whose Indexes, I doubt not, but have furnished him with all the Reading
he has show'n upon this Occasion: for certainly if he had but taken a little
more pains in reading the Authors themselves, he would not have had the
Confidence to have so grossly imposed upon the World as he has done. When, I
say, I had perceived with what intolerable dis-ingenuity he had all along
managed his Design, I could not but conclude with my self, that if his very
extraordinary Ignorance has not stood in the way of his Preferment, he had
Malice and In pudence enough to entitle him to the honor of a Pillory.

Nor can the man deserve less that goes about to make people believe, that the
Kingdom of England, but a few Ages ago was Elective, that His Majesty, (whom
God long preserve) holds His Crown upon no surer Title than an Act of
Parliament; and that it is lawful for the Three Estates of the Realm to depose
their King, and call him to an Account of his Stewardship, if he behave not
himself to their content and satisfaction: for either this must be the
consequ^^ce of his Discourse, or nothing; for all his Arguments are drawn from
matter of Fact (for the most part falsely represented too); and he tells us of
two Kings that have been deposed: so that if from thence we may conclude, that
because such things have been done they either were then or may now lawfully be
done (which either our Author must prove to be true, or else acknowledge his
whole Discourse an impertinent Scrible. I have not falsely accused the Writer of
this Discourse I amabout to examine.

And although this might be allowed to be a sufficient Answer to this whole
Pamphlet, since every one can tell him a facto ad jus non valere consequentiam;
yet, because there may be a great many people in the World as willing to be
deceived as he is to deceive, for I can believe none to be so ignorant, were
they not violently bent upon it, as to suffer themselves to be imposed upon by
so irrational and illogical a Discourse, I suppose it will not be an unwelcome
performance to those that are Lovers of Truth or Honesty, to see the Mask
pulled off from our Scribler, and his many and unpardonable (because designed)
mistakes in his pretended HISTORY OF THE SUCCESSION laid open.

But before I proceed to examine the particulars, I cannot but take notice of
one thing that may easily impose upon the unwary Reader in turning over our old
Monkish Historians; I mean their very frequent mention of the Election of our
Kings; which expression of theirs has given our Pamphleteer the most colorable
pretense of any, to assert the Monarchy of this Isle to be an Elective One; but
he that has taken the pains to look into the Body of their Writings more
carefully than this Gentleman has done, will, I am sure, conclude that no good
Argument can be drawn from a loose Expression or careless Word let fall from
the Pen of any of our Monks, who must be confessed by every one to be extremely
ignorant of Latinity, and the true propriety of Words, so that both false
Grammar and gross Barbarisms are very frequent amongst them; besides, it will
most evidently appear, that what they called Electing of a King, amounted to no
more than an open acknowledgement or recognition of his Right and Title, since
(as I shall make appear from the ensuing Discourse) they, upon several
occasions, tell us of the right, precedent to all manner of Ceremony, that
Kings of England have to the Crown, and both they and several Parliaments of
different Complexlous and Interests have declared the Kingdom of England to be
Hereditary (as appears from several Rot. Parl. 39 H. 6. n. 10, etc. Rot. Parl.
1 E. 4. n. 8, etc. Rot. Parl. tent' apud Westm' die Veneris 23 die Jan. An.
Regni Regis Rich. 3. primo, etc.
Records) and that the Crown, according to the Laws of God and Nature, does
descend according to Birthright and proximity of Blood; which, how it can do,
and yet be Elective, I cannot for my life understand; so that whatever the
present use, and the propriety of the word (Election) may make it signify, yet
I am assured the meaning of it in our Records and Historians must be what I
have assigned (to wit) A Recognition and Acknowledgement of the Person said to
be elected, to be the true Heir to the Crown, to whom by Birthright it is due.

But to come closer to the point: I agree that nothing certain has come down to
us of the nature of the Government of this Island, before the Romans came
hither, who found them governed by several petty Princes: but if we may give
any credit to what is related of the old Britains, and some Learned Men
Sheringham de Anglorum gentis Origin etc. Hist. Britan. Desensio per J.
Priseum Eq. Aurat.
are persuaded we may, we shall find the Crown to be Hereditary.

But our Pamphleteer, by a strange way of arguing would make us believe, that
during the Heptarchy, because they were governed by diverse Laws, that therefore
their Rule of Succession must be diverse. as if because France, Spain, Moscevia,
Denmark and Sweden are governed by different Laws, that therefore they ought
not to be Hereditary; however it seems he is convinced that some of those
Royalties in the Heptarchy were not Elective, and if he would but please to
read over the History of those times, and not rely too much upon Indexes, he
would be convinced that the Crown in them all did constantly descend to the
next Heir, unless he were unjustly put by either by some potent Neighbor, or
powerful and popular Rebel.

At length seven Kingdoms were united under Egbert and his posterity, who
succeeded him successively by Hereditary Right, and so far are the Historians
from constantly mentioning (as we are with a great deal of confidence told page
1.) that we hear not one word of it in any Historian of Account, till Edgar had
put himself at the Head of his Brother King Edwy's Subjects, and had forced him
to divide the Kingdom with him; and truly I cannot but admire the impudence, or
at least ignorance of our Author, in telling us that Egbert came to the Kingdom
of the West Saxons by Election, and that he was no way related to Brithric the
last King, when I dare confidently affirm, that there is not one M. West. f.
145. -- Rex -- Brithricus -- filiam Offae Regis Merciorum -- in conjugium
accepit, cujas affinitate fultus Egbertum solum regalis prosapiae superstitem,
quem regni sui utilitatibus futurum metuebat hostem, in Franciam fugavit.

Idem f. 155. -- defuncto itaque Rege Brithrico, successit ei Egbertus in
regnum 36 annis, qui ex regali illius gentis prosapia originem ducens, multa
potenter regna suo adjecit imperio. H. Huntingd. lib. 5. Flor. Wigorn. f. 563.
An. 802. R. de Hoveden Annal. p. priore f. 413.


Historian but says he was next Heir, and only remaining Branch of that Royal
Stem, and that upon Brithric's death he succeeded him in his Kingdom, without
the least mention of any Election; and I am sure a man can scarce look into any
of the Monkish Writers, but he shall find a M. Westminster. f. 166. cum multis aliis.
Genealogy of this Egbert, one of whose direct Ancestors was Brother to the
great Ina, King of the West Saxons, who was descended in a direct Line from
Cerdie the first King of that people in England; but these kind of shifts,
whether ignorant or malicious I determine not, are very frequent.

To Egbert succeeded his Eldest Son M. West. f. 155. -- cui (sc. Egberto)
succedens Aethelulphus filius ejus -- 20 annis and 5 mensibus imperavit. --
Ethelwolf, not by Election but Birthright, who, out of a mistaken Devotion,
went to Rome, and carrying his youngest Son M. West. f. 158.
Alfred, whom he loved above any of his Children, with him; and designing, if
possible, to make him his Successor, he prevailed with the Pope to Anoint and
Crown him King; which certainly was a very preposterous way of going about it,
if it had been in the peoples power to choose their King; for then the most
natural way had been to make his Address to them that had the power in their
hands; Ibidem -- exorta est contra Regem praedictum magnatum quorundam
conspiratio, ita quod facta conjuratione ab Aethelbaldo filio regis primogenito
-- quod a Roma repatrians nunquam reciperetur in Regnum, causa -- erat -- quod
filium juniorem Aelfredum, quasi aliis a sort regni exclusis in Regem Romae
secerat Coronari.
but however this Action of the Fathers so much alarmed the Eldest Son
Ethelbald, that rather than he would so unjustly be deprived of his undoubted
Right, he resolved to deprive his Father of his Kingdom; and upon this specious
pretense raised so strong a Faction against him, that the Father to bring him
again to his Duty, was forced to share his Kingdom with him: and this Prince
wisely considering that if he did not contribute toward the avoiding of it, his
death might be the occasion of a great deal of Bloodshed amongst his four
Children, by M. Westminster. f. 159. Aethelulphus -- de suo transitu ad vitam
Universitatis cogitans, ne filii ejus post obitum suum inter se disceptarent
haereditariam scribere imperavit Epistolam, in qua and regni inter filios
Aethelbaldum and Aethelbertum -- divisionem -- procuravit, etc. and paulo
postea; Aethelberto filiorum secundo Regnum Cantiae cum Sussexia concessit,
filius ejus primogenitus Aethelbaldus in West-Saxia pro patre regnavit.
his Will in his lifetime he ordained, That his Lands should be distributed
amongst his two younger Sons and Daughter, but his H. Huntingd. Hist. l. 5. f.
348. Aethelbaldo filio suo reliquit praedictus Rex nobilissimus (sc.
Aethelusphus) Regnum Haereditatium Westsexe; Adelbricto filio suo alii reliquit
Regnum Cantiae and Estsexe and Sudsexe.
Hereditary Kingdom of the West Saxons he bequeathed to his Eldest Son
Ethelbald, and the Kingdoms of Kent, Essex, and Sussex to his Second Son
Ethelbert, to be held in Fee of his Elder Brother; and upon his death his
Eldest Son Ethelbald succeeded him according to his Fathers Will, and he dying
issueless, Ethelbert as next in Blood sat upon the Throne, and so his two
younger Brethren Ethelred and Alfred, by right of Inheritance, and according to
proximity of Blood successively came to the Crown.

Upon the whole matter it may be, I think, reasonably concluded, not insisting
upon the silence of History, from these two particulars, that the Kingdom was
nothing less than Elective; first, because it is irrational to think that
Ethelmolf would have pretended to have appointed and nominated a Successor, if
the Crown had not gone then by Birthright. And in the next place I cannot
conceive why Alfred, who was a kind of Flor. Wigorn. fol. 587. -- Quo (sc.
Aethelred) supra memoratus Aelfredus, qui usque ad id tempus venientibus
fratribus suis fuerat secondarius, totius regni gubernacula divino concedente
nutu cum summa omnium illius regni accolarum voluntate confestim suscepit.
Vicegerent to all his other Brethren, should wait their Death, before he took
upon him the Government; for if the Choice of the people had been sufficient to
entitle him to the Crown, he had never wanted that, since he was their Asser.
Menevens. in vit. Alfred. f. 7. -- Quod (sc. Regnum) etiam vivente fratre suo,
si dignaretur accipere facillime cum omnium illius gentis accolarum potuerat
invenire.
Darling all along, especially if the Unction and Coronation by the Pope be
considered, for that, though of no force or efficacy in it self, yet might have
been easily improved into a most excellent and fair pretense: therefore I
persuade my self, it was only the consideration of his Elder Brothers Right,
according to the Laws of God and Nature, that deterred this Excellent and
Learned Prince from being allured by the inviting and almost irresistible
temptations of a Crown, in prejudice of those that had a greater Right than
himself.

But if such a Rule of Succession, as I am contending for, were in use at that
time, how could Athelstan, Grandchild to Alfred succeed his Father Edward the
Elder, to the dis-inherizon of his Brother Edmund, if he, as this Gentleman
would have us believe, were a Bastard? but what if there be no such thing? for
I for my part cannot find that he was: if our Historiographer have any Author
besides Polydor by him that the World has not yet been blessed with the sight of,
he would do well to produce him for the public good; but till then, since I
have got some Flo. Wigorn. f. 598. M. Westminster. f. 184, W. Malmesb. l. 2. c. 6. f.
76.
good Writers on my side, I may, without any disparagement to the Gentleman's
remarksincerity and faithfulness, hold Athelstan to be as legitimate as himself.

The next instance he gives us to show that the Crown descended not according
to proximity of Blood is Florent. Wigornens. f. 604. M. Westminster. f. 188. Defuncto
itaque Edmundo -- Edredus frater ejus -- regni diadema -- suscepit -- reliquit
quoque duos filios haeredes legitimos Edwinum and Edgarum, qui repugnante
illegitima aetate patri succedere non valebant. R. Hoveden. par. 1. f. 423. W.
Malmesb. l. 2. c. 7. f. 55.
Edreds Succession to his Brother Edmond, though the deceased Prince had left
two Sons behind him: but he forgets to tell us they were Minors, and upon that
account their Uncle (the Office of Protector being not then in use) was Crowned
King; though by this odd Custom, it often happened that the lawful Heirs were
deprived of their Right; for notwithstanding they were under an Obligation to
resign as soon as their Kinsmen came to Age, yet so strong were the
Temptations, and so sweet the Enjoyment of a Crown, to an ambitious Soul, that
rather than they would submit to a just resignation of that which was but
committed to them in Trust for another, they would break through all Laws
Humane and Divine to maintain that by Force, which, contrary to Reason and
Justice, they had usurped.

But however in this case it happened otherwise, for Edred dying very
opportunely, was succeeded by his Nephew Edwy: he after a short, but
troublesome Reign, had his Brother Edgar for Successor; who, having governed
his Subjects in peace and plenty, and to his own Eternal Honor, left the Crown
to his Eldest Son Brompton. f. 872. M. Westminster. f. 193.
Edward (who on the account of his barbarous and cruel Death contrived by his
inhumane Stepmother, was afterward called the Martyr) But his Coronation was
a little obstructed by a Faction of the Nobility, who endeavored to advance
Ethelred to the Throne, being animated thereto by Alfdritha his Mother, that
she, during his minority (for he was but seven years of Age) might satisfy her
Ambition by domineering it over the Kingdom, M. Westminster. ubi supra.
Vt potius sub ejus nomine regnare videretur; for they pretended that Edward
was illegitimate, and therefore ought not to be preferred before his Brother
Ethelred, who was the true Heir to his Father, and to whom therefore the Crown
was dire, so that the dispute was not who should, but who ought to be King; nor
was it carried by Interest in favor of Edward (as our Pamphleteer would
persuade us) but by right; for Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, being fully
satisfied of the justness of his Title, without suffering a thing so clear, any
longer to be debated, according as his Father had commanded ( M. West^^ ubi
supra. Fl. VVigorit. f. 605.
ut pater ejus moriens dictitaverat, are the very words of the Historian)
consecrated Edward King; which he surely durst never have done, if he could
have derived his Right from no other Original than the Choice of the People.

But though none of those Instances alleged by him yet are of force enough to
prove what he produced them for, yet we are not to suppose a man of his
Infinite Reading cannot find out something that, at a dead lift may serve his
turn; and truly I cannot but admire his excellence that way: he has had the
good luck to hit upon the most admirable passage, and so pat for his purpose,
that it is impossible to match it in any of those most incomparable and
delectable Histories of Montelion, Knight of the Oracle, Amadis of Gaul,
Parismus and Parismenus, there is nothing in them either for pleasure or
astonishment, but comes a Mile behind what this Gentleman's Author, the Canting
Abbot of Rievalis can help us to, and to the everlasting credit of his Wit and
Invention be it spoken, his Life of Edward the Confessor, from one end to the
other, is as perfect Romance as any of 'em: and truly amongst all his Romantic
Tales, and I assure you they amount to no sinall number, this of Choosing of
Edward by the Estates, whilst in his Mothers Womb, is one of the most
improbable. For, not to insist upon the universal silence of all our Historians
in this matter, which, if any such thing had been, it would have been a most
unpardonable fault in them not to have mentioned, not, I say, to insist upon
this, No man certainly in his right Wits can think so wise an Assembly, as was
composed of all the Noblemen of England, could be guilty of so much folly and
madness, as to choose a Child, and that unborn too, for their King, and reject
several brave and worthy Princes; since they could not be ignorant how many
inconveniences and Convulsions a People are subject to whose King is a Child;
and they could not rationally expect the Father would live till their future
Monarch was past his Minority; besides, the Kingdom being actually invaded by
the Danes, stood then in need of a Prince that was Active, Prudent and Valiant:
and, as I think, they could not be reasonably supposed guilty of so extremely
foolish an Action, so neither in my mind ought we to be so uncharitable as to
imagine them so prodigiously wicked, as that, contrary to all Equity and
Justice, they should afterward as basely forsake and reject, as they had
rashly, though solemnly, chosen the poor Prince; surely none can believe they can
stand chargeable with two Crimes of so great a magnitude. For my own part I
cannot be persuaded that this Gentleman can be so senseless as to believe so
evident a Forgery, or that he would have had the confidence to have made use of
it, had lie not devoted himself to buoy up an Interest, that is able to support
it self upon no better grounds than a company of specious and plausible, but
for the most part very shallow pretenses.

Ethelred being dead, Fl. VVgorn. f. 616. M. Westminster. f, 203.
Canutus by the terror of his Arms, having the greatest part of the Island at
his devotion, forced them to acknowledge and receive him for their King, which
they being under an apparent Force, could not choose but do, which,
notwithstanding this Gentleman is pleased to call an Election, but how
ridiculously, I leave to every man of sense to judge; but however the City of
Soli Cives Londinenses, and pars Nobilium qui tunc temporis ibidem permanebant,
Edmundum filium Regis, ferreum latus in Regem unanimiter exclamaverunt. M.
Westminster. ubi supra.
London, and that part of the Nobility that was there, stood firm to Edmond
Ironside, Eldest Son and Heir to the deceased King, and received him for their
Sovereign, as they were in Duty bound; but at length these two Princes being
grown weary of the War, after a Duel sought between them, to avoid the effusion
of more Blood, they came to this M. Westminster. f. 205.
Conclusion, That the Kingdom should be divided betwixt them, each peaceably to
enjoy his share.

But upon the Death of Edmund, the M. Westminster. ubi supra. Fl. Wigorniensis. f. 618.
-- Verum illi, restante Deo, falsum perhibuerunt testimonium, and fraudulentes
mentiti sunt, existimantes illum sibi and mitiorem esse propter mendacium
eorum, and se ab eo praemium sumpturos magnum, ex quibus falsis testibus quidam
post non longum tempus ab eodem rege sunt interfecti.
Dane, being resolved to admit of no Co-parter in the Government of this
Island, summons all the Great Men, and very cunningly (as if he had been
ignorant of the matter) demands of them whether or no by the Agreement made
betwixt him and the late King, it was Provided, That the Sons or Brethren of
Edmond should succeed him during his ( Canutus's) Life; but he was answered by
'em, That they were ignorant of any Provision made for his Brethren at any
time; but this they were sure of, That Edmund on his Deathbed had recommended
the Care and Protection of his Children to him, till they came to Age capable
of the Government of his Kingdom: but, says Florence of Worcester, God knows
they bore false Testimony, and ly'd falsely; but they thought by this means to
entitle themselves to some great reward, or at least to a Room in his Favors
and Affections; but after by this means he had obtained the Crown, they found
themselves mistaken; for, he wisely considering that such Time-serving
Politicians as had betrayed their true Master's Interest, would no longer be
true to his than it stood with their convenience, therefore he soon found means
to cut most of 'em off; a true and just reward for their disloyalty.

Canutus being dead, and having appointed his youngest Son Hardicanute for his
Successor by his Will (it seems Princes in those days took upon them the
disposing of their Crowns, without asking the consent of the people) his Second
M. Westminster. f. 209. VV. Malmesb. l. 2. c. 12. f. 76. Flor. Wigorniensis. 622.
Son Harald, as having the advantage by seniority of Birth, laid claim to the
Crown, asserting that he being Elder Brother and Legitimate (which, by the by,
was false, but however it served his turn for the present) it was not in his
Fathers power to rob him of his Birthright; to determine therefore the
justness of his Title, a great Council was assembled, where the business ( viz.
who had the greater Right to the Crown) was very warmly debated on both sides,
and was at length decided in favor of Harald, he having the greatest part of
the Nobility and the City of Qui jam pene in barbarorum mores propter
frequentem convictum transiverant. VV. Malmsb. ubi supra.
London, which was then by the long continuance of the Danes there, degenerated
into barbarism: and though this Gentleman would make us believe this was an
Election; yet I am persuaded it was nothing less, because the point in
Controversy was, who had the most Right and best Title to the Crown: besides,
if we may give Credit to the Brompton f. 932.
Historian, who says, Placitum magnum de regni Successione apud Oxonium factum
est; it was only a bare pleading and arguing the justness of Harald's
pretenses, -- quafi justus haeres (sc. Haraldus) regnare, nec tamen ita
potenter ut Canu'us, quia justior haeres expectabatur Hardicanutus: (which how
it could be, and yet the Kingdom be Elective, I cannot conceive?) F. Wigorniensis.
ubi supra.
who by the corruption and partiality of the Judges got the day,
notwithstanding all the endeavors of Q. Emma and Earl Godwin, who objected
Harald's illegitimacy, and the Will of the deceased King (so far were they from
endeavoring to make any court to the people, for the procuring of theirs, that
they only desired their assent to the justness of his Title, which certainly in
an Elective Monarchy no man can pretend to:) but Harald being sensible how
unjustly he had obtained the Crown, used a great deal of Address and Cunning to
cut off all his Competitors; and it was the hard Fortune of poor Alfred to fall
into his cruel hands by the treachery of Earl Godwin, and was presently after
most barbarously murdered: and yet our Pamphleteer has the impudence to tell
us, That the Nobility, after the expulsion of the Danes proceeded to Elect him,
which is as notoriously false, as a great many more of his Forgeries.

But Harald Harefoot being dead, to make some amends for their former undutiful
carriage, they send to M. VVestm' f. 110 Fl. Wigorn. 623.
Hardicanute, then at Bruges, an offer of the Crown, which he before had been
unjustly deprived of; which he accepts, and comes immediately into England to
be Crowned; so that all this while we find not so much as one pretense of
believing this Kingdom to be Elective.

After his death, the English grown weary of the Danish slavery, at last
resolve to return to their Duty, and restore the Saxon Line to the Crown it had
so long been, contrary to all Law and justice, kept from the possession of; in
order to which they enter into a joint Brompt^^. 934
Association, and resolve to stand by one another (as the modern phrase is)
with their Lives and Fortunes in depriving, for ever, the Danes of that
Government they had no pretense or right to, but what the Sword gave them. Nor
can this be any Argument for the Power of Parliaments in disposing of the
Succession, for what was done by the Great Council then, was but their Duty,
since they were bound in Conscience upon the first opportunity to endeavor the
ejection of an Usurper, and the Restoration of the true Heir to the Throne of
his Fathers.

In pursuance to this Resolution, it not being well known what was become of
Ironside's Children, or if it were, they being at that time in Hungary, and
having few or no Friends to assert their Right, by the Power and Interest of
Earl Godwin, whose Daughter Edward had married, the F. nigorn. f. 624. M.
Westminster. f. 212. VV. Gemiticens. de Ducibus Norman. in vit. Guliel. Conq. c. 9.
Confessor as the lawful and next Heir, was advanced to the Crown; but he, good
Prince, knowing the Right his Nephew had to the Crown, sends for him home, that
after his death he might succeed in that Kingdom, which Jure Haereditario ei
debebatur, says one of our most considerable M. Westminster. f. 221. Fl. Wigorn. f.
633. W. Malms. c. ult. lib. 2. f. 93. ut aut ille aut filii sui succedant regno
Haereditario Angliae.
Historians, was due to him by Hereditary Right: and if so, how could the
Government be Elective? Nor was there any danger like to accrue to Edward by
this, since not only the memory of so great an Obligation as this was, would
keep him from attempting any thing in his Uncles prejudice; but if he had any
such Design, he being so great a Stranger, would want a sufficient Interest to
bear him out. But, he dying presently after his Arrival, his Eldest Son Edgar
was looked upon by every one to be Heir Apparent to the Crown, which all our M.
West. f. 221. M. Paris. f. 2. etc.
Historians with open cry tell us was his due by Birthright; nay, so commonly
was the opinion received, that he was vulgarly called Atheling, which what it
signifies, we shall best be informed by an Old English Poet: speaking of the
endeavors of some Honest and Great Men to have had this Edgar crowned
according to Law, Justice and Equity, in this manner: The good tryewomen of the
land would aabbe ymade King. Rob of Gloucester.

The kind cir, the young child Edgar Atheling.
Who so were next King by kind me cluped him Atheling.
Therefore me cluped him so, vor by kind he was King.


And since this Edgar had no Title to the Crown, upon the Account of any
Election, but by Right or Blood and Inheritance, which are things altogether
incompatable with an Elective Government, I cannot for my Life understand, how
any man can find any thing to favor my Adversarie's Opinion.

And though, his Party not being strong enough to assert his Right, he was put
by, by M. Paris. f. 2. Fl. wigorn. 633.
Harald, Earl Godwin's Son; yet every Body must acknowledge, it was most
unjustly done; since Harald could neither pretend right of Blood, nor Election:
For it was so far from that, that he, contrary to the Rights of Holy Church,
without any Ceremony, and without expecting either the Votes of the Nobility,
or the Assistance of the Prelates, he set the Crown upon his own Head, nor
durst any body gainsay it: W. Gemiticens ubi supra.
For he had a great part of the Land of England in his own Possession; but were
-- Extorta fide a majoribus sibi regnum (ut iujurias suas acumularet ampliores)
diadema sine ecclesiastica authoritate imponendo asseruit. M. P. ubi supra.
forced and compelled for fear, to swear Allegiance to him: But at length, he
met with a just Reward for his Disloyalty, losing both his Crown and Life at
once, to Duke William, who had as little Right as he.

And thus, I hope, I have made it clearly evident, that my Antagonist has been
wretchedly mistaken in all his Instances, during the Saxons Government; and
though he pretend, he picked but a few out of the many he could have produced;
yet without disparagement to his exquisite Discernment, I think I may truly
say, he must have had a great deal better Eyes than my self, to have found
them, and a great deal more Dexterity than I can perceive he is Master of, to
have by wresting and Wire-drawing, the meaning of his Authors, made more.

But though he may have had ill luck hitherto in his Undertaking; yet perhaps he
may succeed better in his Endeavors, after the Normans had made themselves
Masters of this Island; but I am afraid, when we come to examine, How, and in
what manner, and upon what Grounds, the Natural course of the Descent has been
changed? We shall find very little reason, not still to seem astonished at the
boldness of the men, who would persuade us, that a Link of the sacred Chain of
Succession may be broke so often as a Parliament thinks fit: For if we look but
with an impartial Eye upon the History of those times, we shall find, that such
a course of Succession as I am contending for, has been constantly conserved,
unless diverted out of its duc Channel, by some powerful and ambitious Prince,
who by Cunning, Subtilty, Artifice and Address, and by the Assistance of some
Popular Friend, has jugled himself into the Throne; and though we find some of
them debasing their Prerogative, truckling to, and courting the People for
their Approbation, thereby hoping to strengthen a cracked Title, and make up in
Power, and their Favor what it wanted, as to its Legality, I presume, no man,
of even Common Sense, can take that for an Election, since it ought to be a
Solemn, Free, Sedate and deliberate Act; which I am sure, none of my
Adversaries Instances can pretend to be: Besides, it seems very strange to me,
that the Kings of those Times, should Entitle themselves to the Crown, only
from the Consent of the People; and that we should no where find mention of
Vicar Generals, they are styled in the Empire.
Administrators of the Government, betwixt the Death of the preceding King, and
the Election of his Successor; since, without such a Provision (and such a one,
I am sure there never was) the Kingdom must necessarily have run into Anarchy
and Confufion; especially if the Crown were engaged in a War at the Death of
any King, which has above once happened; therefore I think my Lord Coke In the
Preface to his fourth Book of Reports.
had reason for saying, This Kingdom is a Monarchy successive by inherent
Birthright, of all others the most absolute and perfect Form of Government,
excluding Interregnums, and with it infinite Inconveniences.

But proceed we now to examine his Proofs; and first he tells us, King William
himself being illegitimate, yet succeeded his Father in the Duchy of Normandy;
and therefore had no great reason to set any great value upon that sort of
Title, which is derived from Right of Blood. But if he had pleased to have
examined the matter a little more narrowly, he would have found, that M. Westminster.

which subsequent Marriage was according to the then almost univerfally received
Canon Law, not only sufficient to render him Legitimate quoad Sacerdotium; but
quoad Successionem too; though the latter was not allowed of in England, propter

Normandy, I cannot understand, for then William had been excluded.

But to go on, William having conquered this Island, which he pretended to upon
the account of the Confessor's donation: upon his Deathbed bequeathed the
Kingdom of England to his Second Son William, his Eldest Son Robert being then
in actual Rebellion against him; but Rufus being too wise to rely upon his

English, to reduce the rest. And here this Gentleman takes occasion to
observe, that the Conqueror by his absolute Victory, did not so wholly break
the English, that all the Old Laws and Customs were destroyed, because they
wanted not hands to use those Weapons which were put into 'em for the defense
of Rufus: and thence, I suppose, infers that the Conqueror came not to the
Crown, so much by Arms as Consent of the People: but how senseless and
rediculous a pretense this is, I leave to himself to judge, since a sure and
faithful -- Ut commilitonibus Normannis qui in bello Hastingensi patriam secum
subjugaverant, terras Anglorum and possessiones, ipsis expulsis, manu

Historian will inform him, that William having left the English Hostages in
safe Custody in Normandy, returned into England to destribute the Lands of the
English amongst his Norman Soldiers that had assisted him to subjugate that
Country, which he did very liberally, having expelled the owners out of their
possessions, and that little he was pleased to leave to some of 'em, he put
under the slavish Tenure of perpetual Villenage; which certainly he never could
have done, had he not both obtained and governed the Kingdom Jure gladii. But
to return from whence I have digressed; Rufus and his Brother Robert came to
this Agreement, at the length that the latter, -- Propter manifestum jus quod
habuit ad Regnum possidendum, Roberto singulis annis tria millia Marcarum
Argenti daret ab Anglia, and quis little diutius viveret Haeres eslet alterius,
si absque filio moreretur; Hoc autem per duodecem magnates juratum suit
utrinque -- M. Westminster. f. 236.
because of the manifest right he had to enjoy the Crown, should have a yearly
Pension of three thousand Marks out of the Revenue of England; and he that
survived the other, if he died without Children, should be Heir to the deceased
Brother: and so far were they from thinking this Agreement stood in need of the
Ratification of a Great Council, that there was but Twelve of their Principal
friends on each side Sworn to see it duly observed.

But Robert being absent in the Holy Land, at Rufus's death the great men of
the Kingdom were mightily afraid of being long without a King (it seems they
were of opinion that Robert had a right to govern) which Henry his Younger
Brother wisely perceiving, resolved to take time by the Fore-top, and improve
this Opportunity to the Supplanting of his Brother, and Advancement of himself;
therefore to win the Affections of the Great Men, he was very liberal in making
them P. Virg. lib. 11. partim dando, partim grandia pollicendo munera, etc.
Presents, and promising larger Rewards (the usual and most prevailing
Rhetoric of Competitors) representing to 'em his Brother's Cruel Disposition,
and that he himself was their own Countryman, and born after his Fathers
coming to the Crown which gave a reasonable pretense to expect to be preferred
before Robert; and having bound himself by Oath, to make a full Restitution of
all their Ancient Laws, and confirm them by his Charter, and abrogate such
severe ones as his Father had made, they did -- In ipsum consentirent, and in
regem unanimiter consecrarent. -- M. Par. vit. H. 1. in princi pio.
unanimously consent to consecrate him King, and I cannot see how this that was
managed with so much Bribery and Corruption can properly be called an Election;
however, I think we need not wonder to find this King publicly owning the
consent of the people to be the foundation of his Advancement to the Throne:
for he must either acknowledge that, or openly profess himself an unjust
Usurper, since he had no other way to entitle himself to it but that. But what
his thoughts were, as to the justness of that Title, M. Paris, after he has
told us that the Enterview between the King and his Brother Robert, in order to
compose their differences (for the latter had laid claim to the Crown as his
Birthright, and had no inconsiderable Party to back him in it) had proved
ineffectual, and that the breach was thereby rather widened than lessened, Rex
itaque Henricus sentiens Conscienciam suam in obtentu regni cauteriatam, erat
quippe eleganter literatus, utpote a primaeva aetate praecepto Patris addictus
literis, and jam in jure quod audiverat, secreto expeditus, cepit iu semetipso
impetus insurgentium formidare; and Dei justitiam in ipsum fulminare, eo quod
fratri suo primogenito, cui Jus Regni manifest competebat, temere usurpando,
Injuste nimis abstulerat; sed plus timens homines quam Deum, Regni Nobiles
primo subdolis pollicitis inclinando conciliavit, cogitans postea
perfundationem Abbatiae, quam construere proposuerat, de tanta injuria Deo
satisfacere. M. Par. vit. H. 1 Anno 1104.
informs us, that Henry who wasb both lately instructed in the Law concerning
this point, and otherwise very learned, feeling the stings of Conscience for
his unjust obtaining of the Crown in prejudice of his elder Brother, he began
to be afraid of his Adversaries, and to fear the just Judgment of God
Almighty, for depriving him of, and wickedly usurping (it seems the Election of
the People could not render him guiltless of so foul a Crime) that Kingdom
which he had a manifest Right to; (so that the people were very far from having
a power to deprive the one of his Birth right, much less to confer it on
another). But he notwithstanding all this, fearing man rather than God,
endeavored to incline the Nobility to his party by crafty promises, hoping to
satisfy God for the Commission of so great an Injury, by founding a Religious
House. (A strange way, you will say, of attoning for so horrible Impiety.) And
thus you see what a slender Opinion this wise Prince, (who had as much reason
to set a Value upon it, as any one) had of a Title that was built upon no surer
Bottom, than the Choice of the People.

Henry fearing least some body might do as much for his Son William, as he had
done for his Brother; having called a Council, made all his great Men swear
Faith and Allegiance to him ('it is M. P. s 66. Gervas. Chron. 1138.
fecit jurare in the Original; though our Pamphleteer would fain insinuate the
contrary) But William being dead in the 27th. year of his Reign (as we are
informed at large from W. Malmsb. Hist. Novel. l. 1. f. 175.
Malmsbury) Henry calls a Council, and having opened the justness of his
Daughter, the Empress Maud's Title to the Crown, as being descended on one side
from William the Conqueror, and deriving her self on her Mother's Side, from
the Blood Royal of the Saxons, who in a long continued, and uninterrupted
Series, of Kings lineally Succeeding one another, had enjoyed the Crown till
the Arrival of the Conqueror; he commands all there present, of any Moment, to
swear Fealty to his Daughter: And W. Malmsb. Hist. Nov. f. 177. Anno 31 regni
sui Rex Henricus rediit in Angliam, Imperatrix quoque eodem anno natali solo
adventum exhibuit, habitoque non parvo procerum conventu apud Northamptonam,
priscam fidem apud eos, qui dederant, novavit, ab iis qui non dederant accepit.
again, in his 31. year he called another Council, and made all those that had
sworn before, renew their Oath, and took it of those that had neglected it
before. Which to me is clear Evidence, that this was nothing less than Election
of the Empress for their future Sovereign, since it is very unlikely, they
needed have performed that Ceremony more than once, much less twice in four
years: besides, here is no mention of chosing, or any thing like it; but only
of swearing Faith and Allegiance; to which add, that this Council here, and all
along before, spoken of was composed only of such persons as were Tenants in
Capite to the King.

Yet notwithstanding all this care, upon the death of the King her Father, Maud
was most unjustly deprived of her Right, and by him too that always had been
the first man that swear to the contrary: For, Stephen P. Virg. l. 12. M. Par.
vit. Steph. An. 1135.
being a man of great Resolution, and a very good Soldier; whereby he had
acquired no small reputation, and gained a very considerable Interest; and
being assisted by several of his Friends, and more particularly Henry, Bishop
of Winchester, he thought it would prove no hard matter to set the Crown upon
his own Head; but at the first discovery of his Design, a great many of the
Nobility were extremely startled at the Horrid Impiety of the Man; which, he
perceiving, began to soften 'em with fair words and large promises of future
rewards; but that which did him the best service, was ready money, a Golden
Bait that seldom fails of being swallowed by all to whom it is proffered. He
obliged himself moreover, to consent to such good and gentle Laws as they
should devise; and so by these Arts, and the restless endeavors of his Friends,
he made a shift to squeeze himself into the Throne, contrary to his repeated
and solemn Oaths to the contrary, and all Laws Divine and Humane; and yet this
has the good luck to pass, with this Gentleman, for an Election; but certainly,
he must take his Readers for either Fools or Madmen, to think they would be
imposed on by such silly Cheats as this.

Stephen had come to the Government too unjustly, to be like to continue in it
long without Disturbance; for presently the Empress endeavored to recover and
regain that right she was so impiously deprived of; and after various Fortune
of War, she having resigned her right to her Son Henry; Stephen and he, by the
Intercession of several good and Holy Bishops, came to a final Agreement. God
looking down upon the Justice of Henry's Cause, Stephen in an Assembly of a
great many of the Bishops, and other Great Men, Rex Stephanus -- recognovit, in
conventu Episcoporum and aliorum regni optimatum, quod jus Haereditarium Dux
Henricus in regnum habebat: and Dux benign concessit, ut Rex Stephanus tota
vita sua, si vellet, Regnum pacifice possideret, etc. M. Par. vit. Steph. 1153.
f. 86. M. Westminster f. 246.
acknowledged, that Henry had an Hereditary Right to the Kingdom; (and if so, I
would fain know, with what Justice the people can pretend to any power of
disposing of the Crown?) and he was graciously pleased to grant, that Stephen,
as long as he lived, if he were so minded, might still enjoy the Government;
and then those present, were sworn quietly, upon the Death of Stephen, to
receive Duke Henry, as their Natural and Lawful Sovereign.

And accordingly, upon Stephen's Death, Henry being both loved and feared by
every one, came very calmly to the Throne; and he having sufficiently
experienced what an alluring Temptation a Diadem is; and that Men of Pride and
Ambition, make no Conscience of breaking through all Obligations and Ties, that
may obstruct their Advances to so glittering a Bait, thought the only way to
secure the Crown, without Dispute, to his Eldest Son Henry, was to set it upon
his Head before his Death; but before that time came, he had sufficient cause
to repent his Choice of this unfortunate Course. However, this my Antagonist
would have thought an Election of the Young Prince to succeed his Father,
without which he could not pretend to it; but if he do but look upon that very
Author Gervas. H. 2. f. 1412. Ipsa die Henricum filium suum qui eadem septimana
de Normannia, militem fecit. statimque stupentibus cunctis and mirantibus in
Regem ungui Praecepit and coronari -- coronatus itaque novus rex ex praecepto
patris sui, succepit fidelitates.
he has quoted, he will find, if he have any remains of Modesty in him, what
Reason he has to blush at his Disingenuity; for he will there find, that the
great men were afraid they were called to give an account, and suffer the
King's Censure for several unjustifiable Neglects they had been guilty of
(surely either this Council was very far different from what we call a
Parliament now; or the Times are strangely altered with 'em) but when they
found 'twas only to assist at the Coronation of Young Henry, they were right
glad; they all the time being filled with Wonder and Amazement; they being so
far from pretending to any power of Election, that they only looked on, and
then swear Fealty. Besides, M. Paris vit. H. 2. Anno. 1170.
M. Paris tells us, that the King having called his Bishops, commanded them to
set the Crown upon young Henry's head, without taking any notice of any others,
as if there had been none present but they; which he certainly would never have
done, if so solemn a Ceremony as an Election had been necessary.

Henry was succeeded by Richard his Eldest Son, living at his Death; without
any provision made in his Fathers life time, in order thereto from the consent
of the people, unless he will call an Article of Peace between King Henry and
the King of France one: and certainly he must mean that if any thing, when he
says his Father was glad to get the Succession confirmed to him; but by this
it was only Provisum est etiam quod Comes Richardus acciperet Homagia hominum
de omnibus terris Patris sui citra mare and ultra. M. Paris f. 151.
Provided, That Richard should receive Homage from all his Fathers Subjects:
but for all this, he tells us, That he was again Elected after his Fathers
Death; which to me seems very strange, for one would have thought one Election
would have served his turn; but it is like the rest of his incoherent Discourse:
besides, I cannot believe King Richard would afterward have taken upon himself
to declare his Nephew Flor. Hist. Anno 1190. M. Paris vit. R. 1. An. 1190.
(...) his Heir, unless he had known that the Kingdom was Hereditary, for in an
Elective Monarchy there can be no such thing.

But notwithstanding King Richard being killed at Chalize, he was most
unnaturally put by his Right by his Uncle M. Paris. An. 1199. in. vit. Johan.
John, who immediately seized upon his Brothers Treasure, and retaining all his
Servants and Stipendiary Soldiers in their former Condition, he comes into
England after having very generously distributed his Money amongst those, that
he thought were capable of doing him any Service, and having first sent several
of his Principal Friends thither, who made the people swear Allegiance to him;
though at first he met with some rubs in his way, from some Loyal and Brave
Persons who adhered to Arthur, as their Natural Liege Lord (as the M. Paris.
ubi supra.
Historian expresses it) alleging, that, according to the received Custom,
Arthur the Son of the Elder Brother ought to succeed into that Hereditary
Patrimony his Father Geofry should have enjoyed, had he outlived his Brother
King Richard; but having called a Council of all those, M. Paris ubi supra.
Qui ejus Coronationi interesse debuerant, Archbishop Hubert made such a Speech
to 'em, as (he says truly) would have startled the Convocation in 1640; but it
sounded as strangely to those then present, to hear him assert, That no one
could have any Title to the Crown, Nisi ab universitate Regni unanimiter
electus, and to run on at so notoriously false and extravagant a Rate: but he
being a very Potent Man, both the King and the rest were forced to hear him
patiently, but with no small concern, that a man of his incomparable Wisdom,
and so considerable a Pillar of the Commonwealth should openly maintain so
strange a Doctrine; but none were so deeply touched as those good and honest
men, who being fully persuaded of the justness of Arthur's Title, were
extremely surprised to find a Clergyman and Archbishop the principal -- Aut
fraudandi Arthurum optimum Adolescentem, avito regno, aut contra jus fasque
Johannem regem creandi, authorem esse. Pol. Virg. lib. 15. in princ.
Actor in depriving the poor Prince of that Hereditary Kingdom, which by
Birthright was his due, contrary to all Law and Justice, setting the Crown on
John's Head.

But the business being over, the Achbishop was asked why he would, in the face
of the Sun, offer to deliver such false Principles; upon which the Good Man,
not well knowing how to give an handsome Reply, ventures upon defending, or at
least excusing one Lie by another; telling them Respondet se praesaga mente
conjecturare, a quibusdam oraculis edoctum and certificatum fuisse, quod ipse
Johannes Regnum and Coronam aliquando foret corrupturus, and in magnam
Confusionem praecipitaturus, and ne habeat liberas habenas hoc faciendi ipse
Electione non Successione Haereditaria, eligi debere affirmabat.
That his mind did not only forebode it, but he was informed in a Dream from
God, that one day this John would prove a very ill Prince; and therefore he
delivered that Doctrine, though false, that John remembering by what Tenure he
held his Crown, might have a Check upon him, to prevent his running out too far
in his Extravagancies: so that he having acknowledged what he then delivered to
be false; the contrary must needs be true; for there is no medium betwixt them;
and all this considered, you may see how much Reason you have to admire the
Gentleman's Candor and Sincerity in relating this Transaction.

But King John had not enjoyed the Crown long, but he felt the effects of this
popular Doctrine, which the Archbishop had instilled into the peoples heads:
For they growing weary of his Government, that was partly Arbitrary and
Tyrannical, withdrew their Obedience from him, and elected Lewis Son to the
French King (which how they could do, and not be guilty of Rebellion, I am not
able to understand) but however, it was not as my Pamphleteer would have it,
more easily consented to by Philip his Father, because King John had been
condemned and attained for Treason in his Brother Richards time, because he was
pardoned all his Crimes by that King, as Vit. R. 1. f. 176.
M. Paris will inform him; but because he stood attainted for the Murder of M.
Paris. f. 281. M. Westminster. f. 275.
Duke Arthur, for which he had in France been tried by his Peers and condemned.

But King John dying in the midst of these Troubles, his Son Henry the Third
being then under Age, was advanced to the Throne by the Loyal endeavors of the
Earl Marshall and the Legate Walo, with several other Great Men, who,
Westminster the usual place of Coronation being in the hands of Lewis and the
Rebel Lords, before the great Altar in the Conventual Church at Gloucester,
anointed and solemnly crowned him, says the -- Est -- Henricus Johannis
primogenitus, in regem inunctus and solenniter coronatus: M. Westminster. f. 277.
Historian. And though from the Speech which was made to that party of the
Nobility that was there then, by the Earl Marshall, it is pretended that Henry
was Elected; yet I dare say, if any one do but impar^^^ly consider the Tenor of
it, he will find that the Design of it was rather to persuade those present to
return to their Duty, and acknowledge him for their King whom God and Nature
had designed for that great Charge: for he begins his Discourse to 'em thus H.
Knighton. l. 2. c. 15. f. 2426.
Ecce Rex Vester (which he certainly then could not be, if their Election were
necessary to make him such) and amongst the rest of his Arguments, says to 'em
thus -- hunc igitur libeat regem dicere cui ipsum regnum debetur -- You ought
to choose him to whom the Kingdom is due (which surely it can be to none, if it
be not Hereditary) and what puts all out of doubt that the Kingdom was not then
(and if not then, I am sure never since) Elective, is the Answer of Hubert de
Burgh, that great both Statesman and Soldier, to Lewis when he summoned him
to deliver up Dover to him, since his Master for whose use and service he had
so long and valiantly defended it, was dead; Si Dominus meus mortuus est,
habet filios and filias qui ei succedere debent. M Par. vit. H. 3. in prin.
If my old Master, says he, be dead, he has left behind him Sons and Daughters
which ought to succeed him. A thing he never would have asserted, had he not
thought there had been a Divine Right somevvhere else than in the people.

Henry the Third being gone the way of all Flesh, his Eldest son Edward
succeeded him: a Prince of most extraordinary hopes, and whose Life let the
World see it was not deceived in him; this Prince, at his Fathers death, was
absent in the Holy Land, in pursuit of Honor there; yet notvvithstanding, in a
great Council held at London, Edwardum absentem Dominum suum Ligeum
recognoverunt, paternique Successorem honoris ordinaverunt. Tho. Walsingh. vit.
E. 1. f. 43.
he was recognized and acknowledged to be their Natural Liege Lord, and Lawful
Successor to his Fathers Throne. We meet not here with any thing like
Election, which no doubt we should not fail to do, if there were any such
thing practiced.

But because we are told (page 6) that whether Edward were the Eldest Son of
his Father or no, remains a doubt in History, I shall endeavor, notwithstanding
the pretenses of the House of Lancaster to the contrary, whose Interest it was,
(as the Foundation upon which the Justness to their Claim to the Crown was
founded) to have it thought otherwise, assure him from one that had as good an
Opportunity, and great Reason to know as any man, that Edmund was six years
younger than his Brother Edward: For; says M. Paris, who lived in the Time of
Henry the 3 d. and was very great at Court, M. Par. 488.
Edward was born the 15th. day of May, An. 1239. at Westminster. and upon S.
Marcellus's day An. 1245, M. P. f. 654.
Queen Elianor presented the King with another Son, who, by his Command, was
called Edmund; and though it was sometimes said he was put by for his Deformity,
yet it is well known how notoriously false that Scandal is: For he had his Name
Crouch back, not because he was crooked, but by reason of a Cross he used (as
did all those that took upon them the Croisado) to wear upon it.

The next was that Unfortunate Prince Edward 2. who suffering himself to be too
much guided by his Minions, fell at length into some arbitrary and irregular
Courses that brought the hatred and ill will of his Subjects to that degree
upon him, that by the disloyal and ambitious Practices of his lustful and
lascivious Queen, and undutiful and unnatural Son, he was at last deprived both
of his Crown and Life; an Action so inhumane, barbarous and detestable, and
every way so unjustifiable, that I cannot but wonder with what Brow and
Conference, any man can bring that as an Instance of the Power of Parliaments.
At this rate the blackest Villainies that Hell can invent, may be defended, if
it be but as sucessful as it is impious. Besides, should we but once allow it
lawful for Subjects, when they think fit, to depose and murder, or as then it is
called, bring to Justice their Princes, we shall not only undermine the very
Foundations of all Government, but give a fatal Blow even to Christianity it
self: And well might the poor Prince solace himself, in the midst of all his
almost insupportable Afflictions, with the hopes of having his Son (whose
Wickedness he was ignorant of) Reign after: For it would be no doubt, no small
comfort to him, to think that those Men who in Contempt and open Defiance to
the Laws of God and Nature, had proceeded to perpetrate so horrid a Crime, that
a Heathen of the true Roman Stamp, would have blushed at the thoughts of,
should not yet so far forget themselves, as to reject every Branch of that
Tree, at whose Root they had struck so great a Blow. Surely from Times so
disturbed and unsettled as these, Men of either Honesty or Common Sense, will
not offer to bring Presidents to direct themselves by.

After a long and Glorious Reign, Edward the Third, who, after the Death of
Edward the Black Prince, had in Parliament created Richard of Bordeaux, Earl of
Chester, and Prince of Wales, in a short time after, left the Crown to this
Young Prince, another of our unfortunate Kings; P. Virg. lib. 19. and 20.
and so far is it from being true, that his Title to the Crown was questioned
by John of Gaunt, the great Duke of Lancaster, that he was, at the latter end
of his Father's Reign, entrusted with the Lieutenancy of the Realm; and after
his Death, was Protector to the Young King, during his Minority: which
certainly had never been if John of Gaunt, jure propinquitatis, had claimed the
Crown, it being dangerous to put so great a Trust and Power into the hands of a
Competitor: Nor was ever the Succession confirmed to him by Parliament, any
otherwise than I have mentioned. Neither can Polydore's Regem dicunt, if you
leave out this Gentleman's disingenuous Addition of [by their Common Suffrages]
for there is no such thing in the Original, signify any more, than that he was
proclaimed King; But it would be well for this unhappy Prince, if he might but
as quietly quit, as he entered into the Throne; but alas! it fell out quite
otherwise: For King Richard being made Prisoner by his Cousin Henry of
Lancaster, a Parliament was Summoned by him in the King's Name, in the one and
twentieth year of his Reign, to meet at Westminster. An action certainly
illegal in it self; for if the Kings Summons were necessary, as it appears it
was, I would gladly know how it can be pretended, in this Case, that this
Parliament did convene by his Authority? for though the Writs were issued out in
his Name; yet was he so far from consenting to it, that if it had lay'n in his
power he would have prevented it. But this Assembly or Parliament, call it what
you will, being got together, I would fain be informed upon what Law or
Authority (I mean Legal) they grounded their following Proceedings? for if the
Breath of the Kings Nostrils was necessary to give them their Being, it is a
little irrational to suppose, they could thence derive a Lawful Power to
destroy the Author of their Life: besides, how can it be supposed they could
proceed justly to pass a Final Sentence upon Him whose concurrance was
absolutely required to give birth to any Law which might concern his meanest
Subjects, though they thought it never so convenient? and why should we believe
it in the Power of the Estates of the Realm to impose any thing upon the King,
when he could bind them to observe nothing without their consent first
obtained? and yet our Pamphleteer is not ashamed to avouch this as a President
of Parliamentary Power, in the Point of Succession. But if we do but examine
the matter a little more narrowly, we shall find it makes very little for his
purpose, unless it be his Design (and a man must have a great deal of Charity
to believe it is not) to instruct the people how to proceed in case their King
will not do as they would have him; for we shall find, that though they usurped
the exorbitant Power of Deposing Richard; yet did they not pretend to the power
of Electing who they pleased, but thought themselves in duty bound to submit to
him to whom by Right of Blood the Crown did belong. And this evidently appears
from Henry, Duke of Lancaster's manner of laying Claim to the Crown; for no
sooner was the Throne void by the pretended voluntary Resignation of King
Richard, but Henry, first having fortified himself with the sign of the Cross,
stood up and made his demand of the Crown in his Mother Tongue in this form of
Word; (as I have extracted them out of the Rot. Parl. 1 H. 4. memb. 20.
Parliament Roll:)

In the Name of the Fader, Son and Holy Ghost, I Henry of Lancastre challenge
this Rewme of Ynglonde, and the Corone, with all the Members and the
Appurtenances, als I that am descendit by right line of the blood coming fro
the good Lord, King Henry therde, (By this you may see what it was he laid
the stress of his Claim on.) and thorghe that Right that God of his Grace has
sent me, (He it seems acknovvledges God, and not the people for the Author of
his Right.) with the help of my Ryn and of my Friends to recover it; the which
Rewme was in point to be ondone for defaut of Governance and undoyng of the
good Laws.

After which Challenge and Claim (says the Record) as well the Lords Spiritual
as Temporal, all and all the States there present, being severally and all
interrogated what they thought of the aforesaid Challenge and Claim: The
abovenamed States, with all the Commonalty, without any difficulty or delay,
unanimously agreed, that the aforesaid Duke should reign over them. And this
being the Naked Truth of the matter, I cannot imagine with what propriety of
Speech this can be called an Election; or what reason this Gentleman had for to
say, that the abovementioned Title was the least of all insisted on; when it
appears from the Roll (as I have faithfully translated it) that no other was so
much as mentioned.

And thus we have heard how the poor and unfortunate Prince, Richard the Second
(from whose Actions, if they be but examined with an impartial Eye, we cannot
conclude him to have been either very insufficient or evil; if we soberly weigh
the Imputations that were objected against him, we shall find nothing of any
truth, or at least any moment) was, in a tempestuous Rage, deprived of his
Right; and upon what Grounds Henry 4. mounted his Throne.

But how justly, even in the Opinion of some at that time, you will best be
informed from Thomas Merks, Bishop of Carlisle, a wise and Learned man, and of
no less Courage; who, when it was moved in Parliament what should be done with
King Richard? He boldly stood up, and spoke to this Effect (as it is set down
by Bak. Chron. f. 158.
Sir Richard Baker; and since it is so much to the purpose, I hope the reader
will not be displeased with the length of it.)

My Lords, The matter now propounded is of mavelous Weight and Consequence,
wherein there are two points chiefly to be considered. The First, Whether King
Richard be sufficiently put out of his Throne? The Second, whether the Duke of
Lancaster be lawfully taken in? For the First, How can that be sufficiently
done, when there is no Power sufficient to do it? The Parliament cannot; for of
the Parliament, the King is the Head; and can the Body put down the Head? You
will say, the Head may how it self down; and may the King resign? It is true,
but what force is in that which is done by Force? And who knows not that King
Richard's Resignation was no other? But suppose he be sufficiently out, yet how
comes the Duke of Lancaster to be lawfully in? If you say by Conquest, you
speak Treason: For what Conquest without Arms? And can a Subject take up Arms
and not be Treason? If you say, by Election, of the State, you speak not
Reason: For what Power has the State to elect, while any that is living has
Right to succeed? But such a Successor is not the Duke of Lancaster, as
descended from So called from a Cross he used to wear upon his Back.
Edmund Crouchback, the Elder Son of King Henry the Third, though put by the
Crown for Deformity of his Body: For who knows not the Falseness of this
Allegation? Seeing it is a thing notorious, that this Edmund was neither the
Elder Brother, nor yet Crook-back'd; but of a goodly Personage, and without any
Deformity. And your selves cannot forget a thing so lately done, who it was,
that in the Fourth year of King Richard, was declared by Parliament to be Heir
to the Crown, in case King Richard should die without Issue. But, why then is
not that Claim made? because Silent Leges inter Arma, what, disputing of Titles
against the stream of Power? But however it is extreme injustice, that King
Richard should be condemned without being heard, or once allowed to make his
Defense. And now my Lords, I have spoken thus at this time, that you may
consider of it before it be too late, for as yet it is in your Power, to undo
that justly, which you have unjustly done.

Thus spoke that Loyal and Good Prelate, but to little purpose, though there
was neither Protestation nor Exception made against this Speech, which
certainly there would have been, had there not been as much Truth as Boldness
in what he said.

And though Henry the Fourth did afterward get the Inheritance of the Crown and
Realm of England settled upon himself for Life, and the Remainder entailed upon
his four Sons by Name, and the Issue of their Bodies, yet that cannot at all
make for my Adversaries purpose, since it amounted to no more than a
Confirmation of him in the Throne; or if it did, we may well suppose that a
Prince that was conscious to himself how unjustly he had gained his Crown,
would not be very unwilling to take such a way, though in derogation to his
Prerogative, to secure himself, if possible, though not out of an Opinion that
they could give him a better Right than they had; but because it is natural to
suppose they would, upon any occasion, be ready to defend what they so solemnly
had enacted

Come we next to Henry the Fifth, who, this Gentleman says, was Elected: But
how notoriously false that Assertion of his is, will appear from hence, that
first there was no Parliament called till after his Coronation; and in the next
place, that if the Act of Parliament, made in the Seventh Year of Henry the
Fourth, had so great a Force and Virtue as he says it had, it was needless; nor
can he prove any such thing from that careless, and negligent Historian
Polydore: For Concilium Principum, with him, does not always signify a
Parliament; as any one that has read him, which I dare say he never did, will
perceive; nor does his Phrase, creare Regem, import any more than the King's
Coronation; besides, it is most untrue which he affirms, that Allegiance was
never sworn before his Time, till after a King was Crowned: For the contrary
appears from King John and Edward the First: Nay, it is undeniably true, that
the Kings of England have exercised all manner of Royal Jurisdiction, precedent
to all Ceremony, or any Formality whatsoever; and that the Death of one King,
has, in that very Moment, given Livery and Seisin of the Royalty to the next
Heir; and by virtue of that, Richard the First, as a Mark of his Sovereignty,
immediately on his Father's Death, restored the Earl of Leicester to his whole
Estate.

Henry the Fifth being dead, he was without any Opposition, admitted to the
Throne, although but an Infant; but in the Thirty Ninth Year of this King, in
open Parliament, Richard, Duke of York, the true and rightful Heir to the Crown
of England and France, made his Challenge and Demand of it, as being next Heir
to Lionell, Duke of Clarence, Elder Brother to John of Gaunt, from whom
descended the House of Lancaster; but to this Claim of his, it was answered, by
the King's Friends, That the same Crowns, were, by Act of Parliament, Entailed
upon Henry the Fourth, and the Heirs of his Body, from whom King Henry the
Sixth did lineally descend. Rot. Parl. 39 H. 6. n. 10. etc.
The which Act (say they, as it is in the Record) is of Authority to defeat any
manner of Title made to any Person. To which the Duke of York answerably
replies, That if King Henry the Fourth might have obtained and enjoyed the said
Crowns of England and France by title of Inheritance, Descent or Succession, he
neither needed, nor would have desired, or made them to be granted to him in
such wise as they be by the said Act; the which takes no place, nor is of any
Force or Effect; (mind that) against him that is Right Inheritor of the said
Crowns, as it accords with God's Laws and all Natural Laws: And this Claim
and Answer of the Duke of York, is expressly acknowledged and recognized by this
Parliament, to be Good, True, Just, Lawful and Sufficient; and it is agreed that
Henry shall hold the Crown during his Life; and the Duke of York, in the mean
time, to be reputed and proclaimed Heir Apparent.

So that we have here (as much as can be desired) a Parliament, not only
declaring, that a Title to the Crown, ought to derive it self only from the
Laws of God and Nature; and not from any Civil Sanction; and acknowledging in
at the Bargain, that it is beyond the Reach of any Humane, Legislative Power,
to debar and exclude any one that justly claims by such a Right.

But to ^ proceed upon Edward the Fourth's coming to the Crown, a Parliament
convened in the first year of his Reign, does acknowledge and recognize his
Title in these words (as the Rot. Parl. 1 Ed. 4. n. 8. etc.
Record has it) Knowing also certainly without doubt and ambiguity, that by
Gods Law and Law of Nature, He (h. e. Edward the Fourth) and none other is and
ought to be true, right-wise, and natural Liege and Sovereign Lord. And that he
was in Right from the Death of the said Noble and Famous Prince his Father,
very just King of the same Realm of England. So here again we have another
Parliament of the same mind with the last, and I doubt not but we shall meet
with more of 'em e're we have done.

When King Edward the Fourth was droven out of his Kingdom by Henry the Sixth,
it is true the Crown was again entailed (if it may be properly so called) upon
him and his Heirs, etc. but still the proceeding was grounded upon the same
Bottom with the former.

Here our Pamphleteer is pleased to make this drowsy Observation, that both
the Families of York and Lancaster claimed a Title by Act of Parliament: it is
true the latter did, because they had no other that would carry Water, but as
false that the former ever did; for they, as you have seen before, founded
their pretenses upon the sound Bottom of Divine and Natural Law. Besides
Richard, Duke of York challenged the Crown as his just Right before any Act
passed in his favor; nor was it the want of a Parliamentary Title which he
stood in need of that kept him off but because he had not Power and Interest
enough to assert the justness of his Title: and therefore it is no wonder he
deferred the making of his Claim so long; for to have done it sooner, would but
have riveted the Usurper more firmly in his Throne.

But Edward having regained his Kingdom as quickly as he lost it, left it at
his death to his unfortunate Son Edward the Fifth, who was soon deprived both
of that and his Life, by his barbarous, inhumane, and ambitious Uncle Richard,
Duke of Gloucester, who having persuaded some, and forced others to believe, or
at least seem to believe, that all his Brother Edwad's Children were Bastards,
did, by a kind of pretended Election, and at the instance of all the Great Men,
take (or rather usurp) the Crown. But that the mystery of that subtle
Transaction may be fully discovered, I shall transcribe that Petition and
Election, as they call it, out of the Parliament Roll, as much as is necessary,
and opitomize the rest, and then I will leave the Reader to judge how
dis-ingenuously (not to call it worse) though according to his Custom, this
Gentleman would insinuate, as if in the midst of their highest flatteries and
courtship to him, they tell him only of this great and sure Title by Act of
Parliament. An untruth, if he had had the least grain of Modesty, he could not
have had the confidence to assert; but by this time, I suppose, you know what a
man I have to deal with.

But I hope the Roll will convince him, and make him ashamed of his
dis-ingenuity. Rot. Parl. tent apud We^im die Ven. 23 die Jan. 1 R. 3.
In this Petition and Election (but that Election imports not what he would
have it, I hope, will evidently appear from the sequel) they set forth the many
Grievances and Oppressions the Kingdom groaned under, through the dissolute
Government of the late King, Edward the Fourth: they say farther, That the King
was never married to his pretended and reputed Queen, or if he was, that upon
the account of a Precontract to another Lady, that Marriage was unlawful, and,
ipso facto, void: and so either way all his Children were illegitimate. They
say farther, That George, the late Duke of Clarence being attainted of High
Treason, and his Blood corrupted, by reason thereof his issue are debarred or
all Right and Claim to the Crown: (But the reasonableness and lawfulness of
this Position I shall take the Liberty to examine hereafter.) Over this (I give
you the Words of the Record in English.) We consider that you be the undoubted
Son and Heir of Richard late Duke of York, very Inheritor of the said Crown and
Dignity Royal, and, as in Right, King of England by way of Inheritance; (how
then can the Parliament challenge a power of Election in the modern sense of
the words?) and that at this time the premises duly considered, there is none
other person living, but You only, that, by Right, may Claim the said Crown and
Dignity Royal by way of Inheritance -- And then they go on in a most abject way
of Flattery to recount his excellent Parts, and extraordinary Qualifications
for the Government -- Wherefore (say they) these premises by us diligently
considered, we desiring effectually the Peace, Tranquillity, and Weal-publick
of this Land, and the reduction of the same to the ancient honorable Estate
and Presperity; and having in your great Prudence, Justice, Princely Courage
and excellent Virtue, singular Confidence, have chosen in all that in us is,
and by this our Writing choose you High and Mighty Prince our King and
Sovereign Lord -- to whom we know of certain it appertains to be chosen.
(From whence it appears, that what they call Election, amounts to no more than
a Ceremony or formality of acknowledging their Prince,) Therefore they desire
him as his true Inheritance (which it is impossible in an Elective Kingdom the
Royalty can be) to accept of the said Crown and Dignity, according to this
Election of the Three Estates. (Surely then the King was none.) They add soon
after: Albeit that the Right, Title, and Estate which our Sovereign Lord the
King, Richard the Third, has to and in the Crown and Royal Dignity of this
Realm of England -- be just and lawful, as grounded upon the Laws of God and of
Nature, (mind that): and also upon the ancient Laws and landable Customs (and
therefore not upon any Statute, but Common-Lavv) of this said Realm: and so
taken and reputed by all such persons, as be Learned in the abovesaid Laws and
Customs: yet nevertheless, (Here once for all take notice of the true Reason
of the Parliaments meddling with the Succession.) for as much as it is
considered, that the most part of the people is not sufficiently Learned in the
abovesaid Laws and Customs, whereby the Truth and Right in this behalf of
likelihood may be hid, and not clearly known to all the people, and thereupon
put in doubt and question. And over this, how that the Court of Parliament is
of such Authority, and the people of this Land of such a Nature and
Disposition, as experience teaches, that Manifestation and Declaration of any
Truth or Right made by the Three Estates of this Realm Assembled in Parliament
-- makes before all other things most Faith and Certainty, and quieting of
Men's Minds, removes the occasion of all Doubts and Seditious Language: And
therefore at the Request, and by the Assent of the three Estates of this Realm,
(the King cannot be one) that is to say, the Lords Spiritual ('it is they are one
of the Estates) and Temporal, and Commons of this Land Assembled in this
present Parliament, and by Authority of the same, be it pronounced, decreed and
declared, That our said Sovereign Lord the King, was and is the very undoubted
King of this Realm of England, etc. -- as well by right of Consanguinity and
Inheritance, as by lawful Election, Consecration and Coronation. And since the
two latter, as all the World knows, do give no new right, but are only
Ceremonies, and bare Formalities of State; I can see no reason why what they
call Election (which certainly must not be strained to Propriety) should be
reputed any other: because, it not only is joined with the rest, without any
Distinction; but likewise, Election in the usual Sense, is incompatible with an
Hereditary Monarchy, such as this is over and over proved to be.

To all which, the King assented in these words, Et idem Dominus Rex de
assensis dictorum trium Statuum Regni, and Authoritate praedicta, omnia and
singula Praemissa in Billa praedicta contenta concedit, ac ea pro vero and
indubio pronunciat, decernit and declarat.

So here we have as much as can be desired; a Parliament that had assumed a
very extravagant Power; yet declaring that the Kings of England do derive their
Titles from God and Nature only; and that this was consonant to the known
Custom, and Ancient Practice of the Realm.

But the innocent Blood of this barbarous and cruel Tyrant's Nephews, whom he
had caused inhumanely to be murdered, crying to Heaven for Vengeance, God
raised up one to deprive him at once both of his Grown and Life. I mean Henry,
Duke of Richmond, of whom the judicious 7 Book in fine.
Comines says, Qu' il n' avoit Croix, ne Pile, ne null Droit, (come Ico croy) al
a Corone d' Angleterre. Come we now to the Consideration of the Methods he used
to establish himself in his new-gotten Kingdom after the Death of Bacon's Hist.
of H. 7. f. 4. Edit. London. 1622.
Richard; and we shall learn that from the best of our Historians, in his Life,
of that wise Prince, who tell us, that the King, after his Victory at Bosworth
Field, being come to London, was very much distracted in his Choice of a Title
to the Crown, as whether he should claim it by Right of Conquest? but that he
judged a very dangerous and unsatisfactory way, or in Right of the Lady
Elizabeth, Heiress to the House of York, whom he had promised and intended to
marry? But as to this, he considered, that he should be a King only by
Courtesy, and Though he should obtain by Parliament (says my Lord Bacon) to be
continued (for otherwise, he must upon his Queen's Death have resigned) yet he
knew there was a very great difference between a King that holds his Crown by
a Civil Act of the Estates, and one (mind that) that holds it Originally, by
the Law of Nature, and Descent of Blood: So far he. Therefore upon those
Considerations, he resolved to rest upon the Title and Right of the House of
Lancaster, as the Main, as that which would prove his surest Card: For though he
could not be ignorant, that upon several Accounts, that Title could not stand
the Test of a severe and legal Trial; yet he knew very well, that it was not
only very foolish to dispute such things with a man that had thirty Legions at
his Beck; but that there could be no occasion for it, during the Life of his
Queen, who was true Heir to the Kingdom; and after her Death, he might hope the
Sense of Filial Duty, would deter her Children from any Attempt, to disturb
him; yet however his opportune Death was looked upon, by many, as his greatest
Happiness, whereby he was vvithdravvn from any future Blovv of Fortune, which
certainly, (in regard of the great hatred of his People, and the Title of his
Son, being then come to Eighteen years of Age; and being a bold Prince and
liberal, and that gained upon the People by his very Aspect and Presence) had
not been impossible to have come upon him; as the Judicious Bacon Hist. of H.
7. f. 231.
words it.

With this Resolution he was Crowned; and having called a Parliament (you see
he did think an Act of theirs necessary to make him King, though he thought it
convenient to confirm him) where an Act was passed for settling the Crown upon
him Hist. of H. 7. f. 11.
which he did not press to have penned by way of Declaration, or Recognition of
Right; as on the other side, he avoid to have it by new Law or Ordinance; but
chose rather a kind of middle way, by way of Establishment; and that under
covert and indifferent words, That the Inheritance of the Crown, should rest,
remain and abide in the King, etc. which words might equally be applied, that
the Crown should continue to him; but whether, as having former Right to it
(which was doubtful) or having then in Fact or Possession (which no man denied)
was left fair to Interpretation either way. And this Statute he procured to be
confirmed by the Pope's Bull, the year following; which is a plain Proof, he
relied not so much upon the Power of a Parliament, as this Gentleman would
persuade us; nor can there be drawn from this proceeding of King Henry's, any
thing that makes more for the Authority of a Parliament in these matters, than
for the Popes, which I am sure no Sober man, but must allow to be none at all.

Besides, this Prudent King was so conscious of the Weakness of his own Title,
notwithstanding this Act of Parliament, that in the Troubles that happened very
often in his Reign, to prevent the Peoples prying and enquiry into the Justness
of it, he got an an Act to pass Lord Bacon's History of H. 7. f. 144.
in the Eleventh year of his Reign, that no man that assisted him in Wars,
should afterward be deemed or taken for a Traitor; nor should be impeached
therefore, or attainted, either by the Course of the Law, or by Act of
Parliament; and truly it was agreeable to good Conscience, that whatsoever the
Fortune of the War were, the Subject should not suffer for his Obedience.

His Argument drawn from the Oath of Allegiance, and other Public Test and
Securities, after what I have said already, will appear so ill considered a
pretense, that I should but lose time in standing to confute it.

I shall then proceed to Henry the 8th. his Son and Successor, and see if any
thing can be gathered from thence, that may make for our Pamphleteer's purpose.

And I doubt not, but it will appear, that whatever was done in that Great
Prince's Reign, was rather the Effect of his extravagant Capricious Lust, or
Revenge, than founded upon the true Maxims of Justice, Equity, or Lawful
Authority.

For Sir W. R. in his Preface to the History of the World, can tell us, that
his violent Hatred to the Elder House of Scotland, was the cause of most of
those Acts, using, says he, his sharpest Weapons, to cut off, and hew down
those Branches which sprang from the same Root that himself did: but yet that
Blood which the same King affirmed, that the Cold Air of Scotland had frozen up
in the North, God has diffused, by the Sunshine of his Grace; from whence His
Majesty now living, and whom God grant long to live, is descended.

And as for the rest, they were consented to; or rather, to speak Truth, forced
from the Parliament by the King (for he used to make them do what he had a mind
to) to satisfy some wild Humor of his, though to the prejudice of his
Prerogative.

For the legality and unlawfulness of his second Marriage, depending upon the
validity or weakness of the Popes Dispensation, which by the generality of the
World was then thought unexceptionable, it is no wonder if Henry the Eighth,
contrary to the natural greatness of his Soul, called to his Assistance his
Parliament (with which his ipse dixi was a Law) to cut that Gordian Knot
asunder, which he was not able to unty.

But it is time now to examine the palpable contradictions of those several mad
and extravagant Acts that he made, and first in the Stat. 25. H. 8. c. 22.
25th year of his Reign, after he was Divorced from Queen Katherine, and had
married Queen Anne: The Parliament having in the Preamble to the following Act,
declared what great miseries, and how many troubles had befallen this Realm, by
reason of the ambiguity of the several Titles to the Crown, do think themselves
bound in duty, by a Declaration of the true Heir, to avoid the causes of such
Distractions for the future, It is therefore Enacted and Ordained, That the
Kings Marriage with the late Queen Katherine is void, as directly contrary to
the Laws of God, and therefore not dispensable with by the Pope, or any Humane
Power whatsoever. They therefore bastardize Mary, and declare the Marriage
between his Majesty and Queen Anne to be just and lawful; and that the Children
of their two Bodies begotten shall be and are legitimate, and then, in default
of Issue Male, entail the Crown upon the Lady Elizabeth, etc. and every one by
the Sanctimony of an Oath, is bound to the observation and performance of this.
And the next Parliament does Enact a particular Oath for that purpose, whereby
every one is bound to bear Faith; Truth and Obedience only to the King's
Majesty, and to his Heirs of his Body of his most Dear and entirely beloved
lawful Wife Queen Anne, begotten or to be begotten.

But mark what follows; a few years after it is Enacted. St. 28. H. 8. c. 7.
That the people shall forswear themselves, the late Marriage is declared
unlawful, null and void; the Lady Elizabeth is Bastardized (as the Lady Mary
was in the former Parliament) and the King's Marriage with Queen Jane is
acknowledged consonant to the Law of God; the Crown entailed upon their Issue,
and for failure of them, the King is empowered to dispose of the Crown to whom
he please by his Letters Patents, or his last Will: and the whole Nation was
obliged by the Sanctimony of an Oath to the observation of this Law.

So that you have at once not only Swearing backward and forward, but the Crown
made Elective (if Act of Parliament can make it so) which had always hitherto
been Hereditary, which so many unbiassed Parliaments had declared was due to
the next Heir by Inherent Birthright, and by the Laws of God and Nature; a
Title sure unimpeachable by any Civil Power, and all this in open defiance of
all Equity, Justice, and Common Reason, on purpose to dis-inherit the House of
Scotland (which as much as Humane Power could do, it was by this Act done) and
to advance his Bastard Son Henry Fitz-Roy, whom he most entirely loved, to the
Throne.

But not yet content to put a period to his extravagancy, in the 35th year of
his Reign, he caused it to be Enacted, That after his Death, and the Death of
Prince Edward, without Issue, the Crown should be to the Lady Mary, and the
Heirs of her Body; but subject to such Conditions as the King should limit by
his Letters Patents, or by his last Will: and if the Lady Mary performed not
those Conditions, that then the Crown should go to the Lady Elizabeth; and if
the Lady Elizabeth neglected to perform such Conditions, then it should go to
such other person as the King should appoint. And he was again empowered by his
Letters Patents, or last Will, to grant the Remainder or Reversion of the Crown
to what person he should appoint: and the whole Nation is again bound to the
observation thereof By an Oath.

But surely no man will argue from these contradictory and wild Acts, that the
King and Parliament have any power to limit and alter the Succession, since, if
we believe those Parliaments I have before mentioned, 39 H. 6. 1 E. 4.1 R. 3.
we shall find that to be removed beyond the reach of any mortal Arm, and
reserved to the only disposal of Him by whom Kings Reign and Princes Decree
Justice: And certainly we have as much reason to believe them as can be
rationally expected, since it is very natural for those that assume so much
power to themselves as they did, to screw it up, when their hands are in, to
the highest pin; for it is not likely that they, if they could have found the
least shadow of Evidence to the contrary, would, out of a Complement to God
Almighty, have thrown back that Power into his hands, which he had once pleased
to bestow upon, and invest in them.

Nor need we at all wonder to find a Prince of King Henry's Spirit and Native
greatness of mind, fall so beneath his usual Majesty in such things, since
perhaps no Prince can be met withal, in whom there concentered a greater
number of odd and anomalous Circumstances, which did incline him to crave in
Aid of his Parliament; for he being one that would sacrifice every thing to his
Humor, Lust, or Revenge, he was forced to take this course, to remove all the
Letts that stood in his way, as far as Humane Power could carry them.

Therefore I am persuaded these Acts of Parliament ought no more to be urged as
Precedents for us to guide our selves by, than his Arbitrary and Illegal
Methods of bringing those that had the misfortune to fall into his hatred, to
the Block, without being once heard, or suffered to make their defense. And as
these are not permitted to be drawn into practice, though done by the Legislative
Power as well as the other, because of their manifest injustice and illegality,
I cannot for my Life see why the other should, it is a Riddle beyond my skill to
unfold.

I shall pass by some of this Gentleman's Paragraphs, as not worh insisting
upon; and come to his Proofs drawn from Queen Elizabeth's Reign; and indeed
it is in an Act made the 13th of that Princess, that the whole Party place their
main strength: but I hope I shall be able to make it appear, if every
Circumstance be duly considered, that induced that Glorious Queen to do some
things that tended highly to the manifest derogation of her Prerogative, which
at other times she was so tender of, that nothing can be gathered from thence,
which will really do any service to my Adversaries Opinion. For, if as all
Casuists hold, those Oaths and Promises which are extorted by fear or force,
are not Obligatory; I cannot tell why those things which by mere necessity upon
those very accounts she was compelled to, as well for the preservation of her
Body Natural as Politic, should be denied the privilege of being dissolved
upon that very score, that other things of the same Nature are.

And that they were no other things than what I have before mentioned, that
caused this Great Queen to fall beneath her self, and court her people for her
establishment, will clearly appear to any one that considers the state of
Affairs, and the History of those Times, the only true Touchstone to try
matters of this Nature by. For, if we consider how questionable Her Birthright
was then generally esteemed, we cannot at all admire, if for her own Interest
and Security she attributed much more to an Act of Parliament, than otherwise
she would have done. For though in the Act of Recognition it is said that her
Majesty is, and in very deed, and of most mere Right ought to be by the Laws of
God, Queen of this Realm, yet the dubiousness of her Legitimacy, and her being
solemny Bastardiz'd by her own Father by Act of Parliament, might very well
necessitate her to call in the Aid and Assistance of her people for her defense
and establishment; since the greatest part of Europe, did not only look upon
the Title of Mary Queen of Scotland to be much the clearer and juster than
Hers: and therefore since Queen Elizabeth's Title depended so very much upon
Statute Law, the most part of the World allowing her no other, and a great many
too disputing the validity of that, she was necessitated to make that as strong
as possibly she could; and therefore made it Treason for any one during her
Life to affirm, That Our Sovereign Lady the Queen's Majesty that now is, with
and by the Authority of the Parliament of England is not able to make Laws and
Statutes of sufficient Force and Validity to limit and bind the Crown of this
Realm, and the Descent, Limitation, Inheritance and Government thereof -- which
though as we shall afterward endeavor to prove, was not in their power to do;
yet she knew very well, that her people would be very apt to defend what they
had then so solemnly Enacted, and so thereby she should gain her end, viz. her
Preservation, which was the great thing she aimed at, as appears by this, that
the punishment to be inflicted upon them that broke this Law, was to abate very
much of its rigor after her death; for then it was but to be forfeiture of
goods: a certain Argument that it was only Temporary, Enacted pro re nata: for
if the Reason of it did continue the same; so ought surely the Punishment,
since they should always stand and fall with one another; though no doubt
another, though less considerable, reason might be the Malaversions she inherited
from her Father, to the House of Scotland, which thereby she did certainly
endeavor for ever to deprive of the Imperial Crown of England. As evidently
appears from this Clause in it, viz. That every person or persons of what
Degree and Nation soever they he, shall, during the Queens Life, declare or
publish that they have any Right to enjoy the Crown of England, during the
Queen's Life, shall be dis-inabled to enjoy the Crown in Succession,
Inheritance, or otherwise after the Queen's Death. For this was most apparently
contrived against Mary, Queen of Scots, and her Son K. James For since almost
all Europe spoke openly of the greater Right that Mary had to the Crown than
Elizabeth, it might very probably be expected, that not only as she thought so,
so she might upon an occasion offered not only speak but act up to her
Persuasion; and then by this Statute she was as much disabled as Statute could
do it. But, besides all this, I am inclined to believe there was something more
in the bottom of it than this, of the contrivance of that subtle and cunning
Statesman, the Earl of Leicester, which I gather from this Clause, That whoever
shall affirm during the Queens Life, either in Writing or in Print, that any
one is or ought to be the Queens Heir or Successor besides the NATURAL ISSUE OF
HER BODY BEGOTTEN, etc. SHALL, etc. For in Law none are called the Natural
Issue of any one but those that are Illegitimate, Vit: Eliz.
Adeo ut (says Camden) tunc juvenis audiveram dictitantes verbum illud a
Leicestrio in Legem ingestum eo consilio, ut aliquem ipsius filium spurium pro
reginae Sobole naturali Angles tandem aliquando obtruderet. Insomuch that when
I was a young man (says he) I have often heard it said, that Leicester caused
that expression to be foisted in, that thereby he might have a pretense to
impose, one time or other, upon the English one of his own Bastards for the
Queens Natural Issue. A Design truly not unlikely for him to have, who always
measured the Public by his proper Interest, and sacrificed every thing else to
his own ends: and then certainly it will never be denied but such an Act of
Parliament was necessary to give color of breaking so ancient and fundamental
a Law of the Land, as the advancing a Bastard must needs be.

How contrary to all the Obligations of Justice and Humanity the unfortunate
Queen of Scots was treated by her Kinswoman Queen Elizabeth, upon the pretended
breach of a Statute made in the 27th of her Reign, I shall not trouble my
Reader or my Self with the recital of; which rigorous proceeding, as it was
chiefly grounded upon her violent hatred to the House of Scotland, so I could
heartily wish for the Honor of that Great and Glorious Queen, under whose
Reign this Island so long and happily flourished, were razed out the Annals of
Time, so that there might be nothing left to stain the Reputation of that
otherwise unblemishable Princess.

But though the Mother had the misfortune to fall so ignominiously, yet the Son
King James had not the wisdom to strive fruitlesly against the Stream, but
prudently never gave an opportunity of finding a color to resist him, who
never laid Claim to a Crown, till Heaven called him to the Enjoyment of it.

But no sooner was he come into England, but having called a Parliament, his
Title to the Crown is solemnly acknowledged and recognized in these words: 1
Jac. c. 1.
We being bound thereunto, both by the Laws of God and man, do with unspeakable
Joy, recognize and acknowledge, That immediately upon the decease of Elizabeth
late Queen of England, the Imperial Crown of the Realm of England, etc. did, by
inherent Birthright, lawful and undoubted Succession descend and come to your
Majesty, as being lineally, justly and lawfully next and sole Heir of the Blood
Royal of this Realm -- And thereunto we most humbly and faithfully do submit,
and oblige our selves, our Heirs and Posterities for ever. And now if King
James came to the Crown by inherent Birthright and undoubted Succession, I
cannot see any thing that makes more against this Gentleman than this; for it is
plain the old Entail made by Henry the Seventh cannot be pretended, because
that Act was, though not expressly, yet tacitly and effectually repealed by 28. H.
8. c. 7. and 35 H. 8. c. 1. for King Henry could not have a power to appoint
who he would for his Successor, if that Act of Henry the Seventh remained in
force: For then he could not have disinherited the House of Scotland, and
preferred the Younger House of Suffolk to the Remainder of the Crown; which,
it is notoriously known, if he did not, yet he intended, and was sufficiently
(as far as Acts of Parliaments could reach) empowered to do it; and therefore,
the other must necessarily have been revoked and repealed: A thing so clear,
that it were needless to spend more time or words to prove it.

So that King James's Title to the Crown (or else he had none) must owe its
Original to the Laws of God and Nature, and the Ancient and Laudable Customs
of this Realm, ( Rot. Parl. 1 R. 3. ut sup.
as it is elsewhere worded) and then, what madness is it to think, that any
Humane Power upon Earth, can change those immutable Laws (for such they are)
and with what color of Justice, or good Conscience they can pretend to debar
any one of his Right; or give a better Title to another, than the late Usurper
had to the Sovereignty, is beyond the Wit of Man to demonstrate, unless we
impiously deny there is a God in Heaven, or any such thing as Right or Wrong
upon Earth?

And thus I have gone through all the Historical part of this Gentleman's
Discourse, as far as it concerns England; and I doubt not but every one must
make this Conclusion upon the whole Matter, that though he tells us he has done
it faithfully; yet it will appear, by the foregoing Examination, wherein I
have rather endeavored to lay down the Naked Truth, without the least
Disguise, than follovv him through all his impertinent Ramblings, that never
more unpardonable Mistakes and Falsities, never more gross Prevarications, and
malicious Misrepresentations of the plain sense and Meaning of good Authors,
were amassed together, under so solemn and pompous a pretense. For my own
part, I cannot but admire, with what Confidence any man could offer to
obtrude such trash upon the World, and vent such notorious Untruths. Surely a
Man must have bid a final Adieu to all Sincerity and Common Honesty; though
perhaps (for I will be as charitable as I can) his over much Credulity may
have been his greatest Misfortune: For though he would fain insinuate, in
several places, as if every man must needs be a Papist, that should go about to
unmask him; yet good man, he has been beholden, for the most part of his
Discourse, to one of the greatest Villains of that Society; which by their
prodigiously wicked, both Tenets and Practices, deserve to be the horror and
detestation of all Mankind. Nor has he had the Descernment, to distinguish
betvveen what was false, and what was true; but has extracted it (at least
as to the Substance) just as he found it, from a Conference concerning the
Succession, written by Parsons; one of the most pernicious Books, that,
perhaps, ever savv Light; and though he be so ungrateful, as not to own his great
Benefactor, yet he blushes not to maintain and publish the same destructive
Principles; a clear Evidence, that so many of those, that would have us believe
they abhor Popery, yet are content, not only to entertain, but hug and cherish
their most destructive Opinions, disguised under other Names.

But you are not to think this Gentleman less acquainted with the History of
other Nations than our own; and that he is not able to give you many Instances
from thence, that the next of Blood, has been frequently excluded from the
Succession: But really, I cannot but pity his ill Judgment, in pitching upon
one so little for his purpose; when his Author could have furnished him with
such plenty of better Choice.

For since no man can deny, but that it both is, and ever was, a Fundamental
Law of the French Monarchy to be Hereditary, I leave it to any man of Common
Sense, to judge whether those silly Reasons, mentioned in the Letter to Charles
of Lorrain, were a sufficient ground to debar him of that Right which God and
Nature had given, him; and to whom (says De Serres) I say the Fundamental Law
did adjudge the Crown, for want of Heirs Males, Lawful Sons of Kings. But the
French being displeased with Charles, upon some frivolous Accounts, Hugh Capet
embraces so fair an opportunity, and foments their Discontents to that Degree,
and so politickly plays his own Game, that having insinuated himself into the
Affections of most People, without very much difficulty, he first screwed
himself into the Throne; and then, to consolidate and establish himself in his
ill-acquired Greatness, by a pretty kind of Pageantry, he called the Estates to
elect him into that Throne he already had the Possession of; which being met,
they did accordingly: And having thus forfeited their Allegiance and Duty to
Charles, it is no wonder if they squeezed their Brains, to find out a plausible,
though never so shallow a Pretense, to avoid the Imputation of Disloyalty. Not
to take Notice, that most Writers stick not to call this Hugh an Sigeb.
Gemblac. in Chron. ad An. 987.
Usurper. Besides, it is well known, that Lewis the Godly, never enjoyed the
Crown with a quiet Conscience, till it was proved, that he was descended from
the Right Heirs of Charles of Lorrain. So mean an Opinion had that good Prince
of the Power of the States, in altering the Course of Succession.

And after all this, I think, it cannot reasonably be pretended, by any one
that any thing can be drawn from History, which can at all countenance the
Proceedings of those men, who so industriously endeavor, to cry up the Justice
and Advantage of the Bill of Exclusion, as the only Expedient, say they, that
can secure us from Ruin, and prevent our Destruction; unless they will say,
that because such things as filled the Age, they were done in with Shame and
Horror; were done, that therefore they were justly done; and so may as justly
be acted over again. An Opinion of such dismal Consequence, that should it once
prevail in the World, all Mankind would be presently turned into one great Den
of Thieves and Robbers, that might plunder, spoil, murder and ravish, with
Impunity, and without Control; and then we should every day see Hobs's
Senceless Notion of a State of War, proved to us with a Witness: Nay, what
Wickedness is there not, which at this rate we might not justify from
Scripture it self? Which gave occasion to Saint Augustine, excellently to say,
Haec quae in Scripturis sanctis legimus, non ideo quia facta legimus, etiam
facienda credamus: ne violemus praecepta, dum passim sectamur Exempla. The true
State of the Question, either is, or at least ought to be, not what has been
done; but what in Justice and Equity ought to be done in the Case of his R. H.
which is not to be determined by Examples, but Law and Raeason. Non Exemplis,
sed Legibus judicandum, is the Golden Rule of the Great Lib. 13. C. de Sen.
Justinian.

In order therefore to the clearing of this great and so much agitated Point, I
shall endeavor to prove;

First, That not only all Government, but particularly Monarchy does owe its
immediate Foundation and Constitution to God Almighty.

Secondly, That by the Law of God, Nature and Nations the Crown ought to
descend according to Priority of Birth, and Proximity of Blood.

Thirdly, That if an Act of Parliament were obtained to exclude his R. H. would
be unjust, unlawful, and ipso facto void, as contrary both to the Law of God
and Nature; and the known Fundamental Laws of the Land. And in the course of my
Reasoning, I shall not forget any thing this Gentleman has said against any of
these things in the Argumentative part of his Discourse.

I am sensible it will make a great many Smile to see me undertake to prove so
many, in their own Opinion, irrational Tenets. And I doubt not but some too
will be displeased to find me endeavoring to strike at the Root of their
darling Notions; they know very well, should this be admitted, they could find
no pretense to adhere to their Republican Principles, and not become the
scandal and aversion of all Good and Honest Men: but, it is not their frowns or
their railing will trouble me; for it is not that I measure Truth by, but
Reason; and by that I am content the Cause I have espoused, should stand or
fall. I would not be misunderstood, as if I had the Vanity to think it would
receive any Advantage by my Management of it; but I am so confident of the
overbalance of Reason and Truth I have on my side, that I doubt not but it
will even make it self appear, notwithstanding my want of Parts (which no man
is more conscious of than my self) and Ability to set it out to the best
advantage.

In order then to the first Point, it will not be amiss to examine what Reason
can be shown to induce a man that has laid aside Prejudice and Partiality, to
embrace that so commonly received Opinion of a Natural Freedom and Equality:
for my own part I take it to be a Proposition not altogether so clear, and
self-evident, but that it requires a little better Proof than I ever yet saw
offered for it.

I am not at all concerned for those many Sentences the Assertors of this
Doctrine are able to pelt me withal from Poets, Orators, Historians, and God
knows who; for I answer with Lactantius, they ought not to be so understood, as
if there were in those early days no Property, Non ut existimemus nihil omnino
tum suisse privati, sed more Poetico figuratum, ut intelligamus tam liberales
suisse homines ut natas sibi fruges non includerent, ne soli absconditis
incubarent, sed pauperes ad communionem proprii laboris admitterent. Lactant.
de Justit. c. 5.
nothing that Man could call his own; but those expressions are to be looked
upon as Figuratively spoken, after the manner of the Poets, thereby to give us
to understand, that men were then so liberal, that they did not covetously
ingross all their store to themselves, but were generously content to admit
their poor Neighbors to a communication of their proper Labors and Income.
Besides it is very observable, that at the very same time we are told of this
Community and Natural Freedom the whole World is supposed to be under the
Government of Saturn, who was succeeded by his Son Jupiter.

Postquam Saturno, tenebrosa ad Tartara, misso,
Sub Jove mundus erat -- Ovid. Metam. l. 1.
And though the Poets call 'em Gods, yet we are surely to understand, that
Earthly Kings are thereby meant; so that from hence nothing can be gathered to
favor that Original of Government, that those that urge these things are the
great Patrons of.

If indeed a Set of full grown Men had dropped out of the Clouds, or like
Mushrooms sprung out of the Earth; I should not be much averse no the notion of
Natural freedom and equality: and that those being in some great Wind furnished
with a convenient number of Women, had propagated their Species; but I much
fear whether there would not have been many bloody Noses before they could have
come to any Agreement, if it had not been altogether impossible; for, How long
a time, and how great experience would be requisite to put the thoughts of
entering into a settled Society into their Heads? Or having found out the
Convenience and Method of doing it, How easily would such a hopeful project be
dashed in pieces by some surly, ill-natured fellow, or at least a party of
such? For since no such thing could be effected without the joint Consent of
all, How difficult a thing would it prove to bring such a Business about; many
out of Pride being unwilling to submit themselves to this or that Man, they
might perhaps have a particular pique against, and as many resolved not to
admit of any such thing, unless they be advanced to that Supreme Magistracy,
which no doubt others as ambitiously Thirsted after as they; and what could be
the Issue of this, but Blood and Rapine, War and their former Confusion? But
granting that all those Arrived to Maturity, should be grown so sensible of
those many insupportable Miseries, that they were every Minute exposed to,
should be content to submit to any thing, rather than continue in their present
Condition: What must be done with their Children? Must they be enslaved by
their Fathers, that have, according to these Men, no more Power over them, than
any of their Neighbors? Surely by that time, they should become sensible of
that privilege Nature had so bountifully given them, they would be found
unwilling to stand to that blind Bargain, that had been made without their
Knowledge and Consent: And how that could ever be had I am altogether to seek,
unless in those Days, they could have spoke as soon as come out of their
Mothers Womb; which I take to be every whit as likely as the other: And no
doubt from hence a justifiable pretense may be taken at any time to disturst
any Government upon Earth, when the inconstant and giddy-headed Multitude, or
any part of them should in their great Wisdom think fit.

Besides, nothing seems more Derogatory to the Goodness, Wisdom, and Providence
of God Almighty, than to send Man into the World, and expose him to so many
inconveniences for the want of that; without which, it is impossible for
Mankind long to subsist, or answer the Ends of their Creation; to leave them
Destitute of that which was so necessary to their well being: for we cannot
without impiety suppose, but God foresaw the many Ills that would accompany
such a Condition; and if so, how it can be reconciled to his Goodness and
Wisdom, I must profess my self Ignorant.

But to let this Opinion of the Origination of Mankind pass, Calculated rather
according to the Fancy of the Poets, or Notion of some of the old Heathen
Philosophers, than Truth. If we Consult God's Sacred Oracles, it will be found
that He sufficiently provided for the Safety and Happiness of those, upon whom
He has Stamped his own Image, by instituting a particular form of Government
immediately upon the Creation of the First Man, the great Fore-Father of Us
all. I know I shall here be told, that it is granted me, God did institute
Government in General; but as to the distinct Species thereof, He left it to
the choice of Men, as they should think most Convenient for themselves; but Did
not God know better than they, what was most fit and requisite for them? And,
Is it not then very likely that they should be accordingly Provided for? And
not to insist that it is hardly conceivable, how Government could be instituted
by God, and yet none of the particular Forms be at that time existent; not to
insist, I say, how any thing can be in Genere, and not in Specie, I think it is
clear from 1.28.
Genesis, that God gave Adam the Dominion and Empire over all the World, when
he so solemnly blessed him: Be Fruitful, and Multiply, and Replenish the Earth,
and Subdue and have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the
Air, and over ever living thing that moves upon the Earth. A Text so express
and clear, that even the great Mar. Claus. l. 1. c. 4.
Seldom is forced to acknowledge, there could not before the Flood be any such
thing as Community; Genesis c. 4. v. 2.
but that Adam is made hereby sole Proprietor of the World; and by his Donation
or Cession, no doubt it was that we find Abel possessed of Cattle and Pastures,
and Cain Master of his Cornfieldsd; and certainly Cain cannot be supposed so
very Foolish, as to have Built a City, and called it by the Name of his Son
Enoch, Gen 4.17.
unless he could have lest it to his Posterity, which he could not pretend to
do, if there had not been such a thing as Property.

But if Adam thus expressly had not been made Sovereign Lord of the Universe;
yet could not the Government of Mankind be denied him, without offering force
to Reason, and bidding open defiance to Nature; for all the World being sprung
from his Loins, the Tie of Filial duty would bind all to Obedience; for no
doubt as Father, he might claim a Dominion and Regal Power over his Children;
and from hence we may very well derive the Original of Government, and that
particular form of it called Monarchy; nor will it appear at all irrational
upon that account to assert Monarchy to have been founded, and instituted by
God and Nature.

For no Man could be Born free, since all Mankind must owe both their being,
and subjection to their Natural Parents, by the Law of God and Nature: So that
upon this account, Adam being invested with a Patriarchal and uncontrolable
Power, not only over his Children, but those that were Descended from them,
during his Life, which being transmitted to his Eldest Son after his Death, and
so on, there could never be any time when there was no Government, since there
were any to be Governed.

Perhaps it may be Objected, that though Adam might have a Power over his
Children, whilst they continued in his Family; yet when that grew too Narrow
for them, and they were removed, and had formed distinct Ones of their own, he
could not pretend to any Jurisdiction there. But I would fain know of these Men
whether the Obligation to be Obedient to Parents does not continue still in
full force, notwithstanding their removal; and if it does, as I am sure no Man
in his right Wits can deny, why the Father's Power of Commanding, and Governing
them, as he shall see most convenient for the Interest of himself, and the rest
of his Children, should be retrenched, I cannot conceive; nor can it reasonably
be pretended, that he should not have the same Jurisdiction over his
Grandchildren, etc. that he had over their Fathers; for it is very irrational
to suppose them exempt from Obedience to the Commands of that Man, their
Parents were Naturally and Originally subject to.

And if we enquire but into the nature of this Paternal Power, we shall find it
to have been purely Monarchical: We are told how Abraham made Peace and War,
and we shall see Jacob exercising the Power of Life and Death over his
Daughter-in-Law Thamar, or at least pretending to it, without any question made
of his Power: and if these great Prerogatives were in their Hands, it is not to
be doubted, but they were Kings in their Families, which we are not to suppose
to be independent from one another, but subject and subordinate to either the
Father of them all, or him, whoever he be, that is Successor to him, and Lord
of the eldest Family.

And that this is no new Opinion, as some People would have us believe, but at
least Older than Aristotle, appears from hence, that he dates the Original of
all Society from hence. The First Society (says he) made up of many Houses,
for the sake of a lasting and durable Benefit, is a Village, (...) --

Aristot. de Repub. l. 1. c. 2.


which seems most agreeable to Nature; as being a certain Colony of a House,
which some Men call Foster-Brethren, or Children, and Children's Children: And
therefore, at first, Cities were, and now Nations are, under Kings; because
such as came together, were under Kingly Government; for every House is under
the Empire of him that is Eldest: and so, for Kindred sake, it is in Colonies;
that is, in more Families, which Descended from the same House. For which
Reason Homer says, Every Man gives Laws to his Wife and Children: And this, no
doubt, he had from his Master, the Divine Plato, in whose Judgment the True and
Primary Reason of all Authority is, That the Father, A.H. (...).
and the Mother, and generally all those that Engender and Beget, do Command
and Rule over their Offspring. And this, I think, is both sufficient to
vindicate this Doctrine from the Imputation of Novelty, and Recommend it too;
since those Great and Excellent Philosophers were Patrons of it.

And I am sure if that be true which the Roman Orator says: Cicero 3. de Legib.
In re consensio omnium gentium lex Naturae putanda est; That the Consent and
Agreement of all Nations is to be reputed the Law of Nature; every one must
allow Monarchy to have been Founded by virtue of that: For without Vanity, I
dare confidently aver, That there was no other Government seen, unless perhaps
at Sicyon, for the First Three Thousand Years: Nay, the Learned Priest of
Belus, the true and genuine Berosus gives an Account of Ten Kings of Chaldea,
before the Flood, of whom Xisuther (in whose time, they say, the Deluge
happened) was the last: And the Egyptian Records could surnish us with a
Catalogue of Kings, that would reach as high as the Creation. In Baeoticis.
Pausanius tells us, That Greece so Fruitful afterward in Aristocracies and
Democracies, that teeming Africa never bred more Monsters, was Anciently under
Regal Government: (...), are his Words. But Tully goes further, and boldly
asserts if for a certain Truth, That all the Nations of Old were under
Monarchial Regiment: Cicero 3. de Leg.
Certum est (says he) omnes antiquas Gentes regibus paruisse.

And when the Universal Deluge had put a Period to all Mankind, except Noah,
and his Three Sons, by whom the World was to be Re-peopled; I think we may with
Reason enough look upon Noah as the Universal Monarch; notwithstanding the
Learned Seldom would have us believe, that God by his Blessing, recorded Genesis
9.2. made him Tenant in Common with his Children: For besides that, this
Benediction seems most-likely to be rather an Enlargement of the Charter that
was given to Adam, than any thing else. It appears something Unreasonable to
suppose, that God Almighty should Disinherit Noah, whom for his Justness and
Piety, he had Chosen to be the Restaurator of Mankind: Nor do the Words
necessarily imply any such thing, since the Promise of God would no doubt be
fulfilled, if his Sons, after his Death, or in his Life time, by his Consent,
enjoyed and possessed the World, as their Property; which, it is certain, they
did. Genesis 10.9.
By these (says the Divine Historian) were the Isles of the Gentiles divided
in their Lands; every one after his Tongue, after their Families, in their
Nations: Which is not to be understood, as a Mr. Med^.
Learned Man (in his Discourse upon this Place) assures, as if it were a
Scattering and Consusion; but a most distinct and orderly Division, because the
Original Word ((...)) always bears the latter Signification: And that there
was such a Partition, and that made by Noah, we are assured also from Eusebius;
and Cedrenus, who tells us, That Twenty Years before his Death, (...). Cedren.
f. 9.
according to an Oracle Received from Heaven, he Divided the whole World
amongst his Sons, assigning to every one his several Share: And this he
Confirmed by his Last Will; and being about to Dye, he gave it into the Hands
of Sem, and admonished them to Live peaceably, and not to Invade one another
Territories.

I might now proceed to those Texts of Scripture, wherein Monarchy is declared
to have been instituted by God. But they have been so often insisted on by
Others, and those learned Persons, that I shall pass them over, only there is
one which I cannot but take notice of, wherein God by the Royal Prophet says
of Kings, Psalm 82.7.
I have said (...) Ye are Gods, or (more consonant to the Original, and
expressly according to the Chaldee Paraphrase) Angels, by which Phrase is not
only signified the Office of Princes (viz.) That they are God's Vicegerents,
but the manner of their Mission, that is by the immediate Commission and
Constitution of God Almighty; from whom alone, and not from the People they
derive their power. Which origin of theirs I think is further evident from
hence, that the Supreme Governor is invested with such an Authority as does
include in it a Power of Life and Death; for which single Prerogative we must
have recourse to the Fountain and Source of all Power: for seeing we neither
have, nor ever had a power over our own Lives, but on the contrary God has
expressly told us, That he that sheddeth Man's Blood, of Man shall his Blood be
shed; it is impossible that Kings should derive their Power from the People,
for it is an infallible Maxim, Nemo plus Juris in alium transfer potest quam
ipse habet. So that it must necessarily follow from hence. That Kings must have
been instituted by God; for it is He and He only could bestow this great
Privilege upon them; and since we find the Fathers of Families Exercising this
Power, we may assure our selves that originally Patriarchal and Regal
Jurisdiction were all one; as likewise appears from this, that Obedience and
Submission to Magistrates is commanded us by the Fifth Commandment, where it is
only said, Honor thy Father, etc. So that as Paternal Power was from the
Beginning, so must Regal too.

Besides from hence I take it to be plain, that even at that time that God gave
his blessing to Noah, Genesis 9.6.
there was a Regiment established; (which could be no other than Monarchy) for
else that command of putting the murderer to death given at that very time,
could not have been put in Execution, but must needs for a long time have
continued ineffectual: for had any private man assumed that Power, he must
necessarily have been guilty of the same crime; so that either we must allow of
Magistracy at that time, or else make God command a thing, and not appoint
means for the execution of it.

And I cannot see why we should date the original of Government any later than
the Creation; for certainly we cannot persuade our selves that Nature, that so
carefully provides for the preservation and well-being of all Creatures, should
only be defective in her care for the noblest Animal in the universe, since
nothing can be more necessarily required for the happiness of any thing than
Government for mankind: Cicero 3. de Leg.
for, sine imperio nec domus ulla, nec civitas, nec gens, nec hominum universum
genus stare, nec ipse denique mundus potest, without Empire, neither the whole
nor any the least part of the world could be conserved in peace and order, but
all would immediately run into Ruin and Confusion.

And now, if I had a mind to enter into so large a Commonplace, it were very
easy to cloy, even the most greedy of such kind of Pedantry, with sentences
from the Fathers and other Primitive writers, to show with what full Cry they
all assert Monarchy to be sounded by God and Nature; but waving a thing so
obvious to every body, I shall take notice that this opinion is so far from
being a Stranger to our Laws, that it is expressly resolved by all the Judges in
England, in Calvin's case, that subjection is from no Humane Law, Co. 7. Rep. 1.
but from the Law of Nature: and if so, then of necessity must Regal Right be
from the same Law, because no man supposes subjection where he does not
presuppose power. Besides, you cannot but have observed above, Rot. Parl. 39.
H. 6. Rot. Parl. 2. E. 4. Rot. Parl. 1. R. 3.
how many Parliaments of different Interests and Tempers have agreed in this,
that the Kings of England hold their Crowns by the Laws of God and Nature, and
therefore cannot be reputed of Humane Institution, and hence it is that the
King is styled in our Statutes, our Natural Liege Lord, and his People likewise
Natural Liege Subjects, and the fidelity owing to the Crown, Natural Obedience;
which manifestly also appears from all Indictments of Treason, that of all
other things are penned with the greatest niceness, wherein the persons indicted
are charged whith Treason against -- their Supreme and Natural Lord, contra
Dominum Regem Supremum, and Naturalem Dominum suum. Nor will any of their
trifling evasions serve them to evade this: for to an impartial Judge, Herod.
lib. 1.
it will no doubt appear that no other sense ought to be put upon it, but what
was meant and expressed by Commodus, the Son or Marcus, when he closed his
Oration thus, Jure principem colite non datum sed natum.

But if, will some say, Monarchy be Jure Divino, why were not Gods own People
governed according to that sacred Form? and why are we told in the Scripture
that when that Regiment was introduced first, it came in by the Peoples Choice
and Consent? I answer first, that God out of his extraordinary kindness to the
Jewish Nation above any other, was of his goodness pleased to reserve the
immediate Government and peculiar Care of them to himself, whereas he governed
all the rest of the World by his Viceroys: so that properly it was a
Theocracy, wherein God himself did immediately preside, whilst other Countries
were made, as it were, Provinces of. But when the Jews, a people most
inordinately bent upon change and novelty, were grown weary of this excellent
Administration of their affairs, and desirous to be governed after the manner
of the Neighboring Nations, they came to Samuel and said, make us a King to
Judge us, etc. 1 Samuel S. 5.
which it is not likely they would have done if the choice had been in them. And
when God Commanded Samuel to yield to their Importunity, he said, 1 Samuel 8.22.
hearken unto their voice and make them a King, and accordingly he anointed
Saul, without so much as acquainting them. And consonant to this Interpretation
is the sense of their great Rabbis: Vie Schickardi Juris Regi^ Hebraorum. c. 1.
for Aben-Ezra immediately adds upon the mention of -- Whom the Lord shall
Choose? Scilicet per Os Prophetae vel indicio Vrim; adeoque sensus est non quem
tutemet elegeris ipse. 1. e. either by the mouth of a Prophet, or by the
direction of the Vrim; so that the meaning is not, that the people should have
the Choice of him: And as for what followed, it was nothing more than a Solemn
and Ceremonious acknowledgment of Saul, whom God had appointed over them.

But the strongest Objection is drawn from, 1 Pet. 1 Pet. 2.13.14. Submit your
selves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King,
as supreme:

Or unto Governors, as unto them that are sent by Him, etc.


2.13. where Kings are called an Ordinance of Man, for if so, then are they far
from being Jure Divino. But if this be duly considered, I am persuaded that it
will appear of no force at all: because in this Text there is a signal
character which keeps it from concluding the Supreme Power to be Originally in
the People, not only by calling the King Supreme, such as in St. Paul's
Divinity, Romans 13.1. are affirmed to be Ordained of God, (...). Romans 13.1. From
whence the excellent Grotius (what ever his opinion might have been in his
younger days) Concludes, that all Kings do receive their Power from God, and
not the People, as much as if they were immediately nominated and anointed by a
Prophet; and that the Power distinct from the Person of the King, is not here
meant, is clear from hence, that v. 3. it is added, (...), for he (that must
needs be the Person of the Magistrate) is a Minister to thee for Good -- Nor
can the Power abstracted from the Magistrate do what is here attributed to him,
to commend and encourage, v. 3. Avenge or Punish, v. 4. And the Matter is clear
from, v. 3. where (...) being afraid of the Power, is all one with (...) the
Rulers are a Fear or Terror in the beginning of the Verse, and that (...), ought
to be rendered Supreme, and not higher, it is evident from comparing it with, 1
Pet. 2.13. where the King is called (...) as having his Commission from God,
whereas the rest are appointed by him. Certum est (says Grotius) hac voce
(...) designari ab Apostolo summum Magistratum.
and so no Humane Ordinance: but also by distinguishing the Governors, v. 14.
from the Supreme, v. 13. by this that the Governors are sent by, i.e. have
Commission from the King, which might, and doubtless would be said of the King,
that he were commissionated or sent by the People, if he were of their
Creation; but of this there is not to be found the least hint or intimation:
but this is evident beyond contradiction from the signification of the Phrase
(...) (be subject (...)) which according to all analogy ought to be rendered
Humanae Creaturae: Thereby meaning any part of Mankind; not Ordinance of Man,
thereby signifying a thing of Man's Creating; for then the Phrase to express
it, would be (...); because if we compare one place of the New Testament with
another, we shall find that (...), signifies generally Pro humano omnigenere
accipitur, sive pro gentibus omnibus, ut loquuntur Mattheus and Lucas. Theod.
Beza. in loc. citat.
all Mankind, as appears from this, that the Creation and the World are all
one; and all the Creation or every Creature, Mar. 16.15. are the same with the
whole World, in the beginning of the verse, and all Nations in the parallel
places of St. Matthew and St. Luke; and thus Romans 8.19. The expectation of the
Creature or Creation, is the hope which the Heathen World had, that they i. e.
the Gentiles as the manifestation of the gracious Privilege of the Messiah,
should also be freed from the slavery of Corruption unto the Liberty, etc. Now
there is but one colorable Objection to be made to this Explication, as if
this precept were thereby so extended, as to command obedience to every Man.
But to this, I Answer, That the word, Be subject, generally relating to the
Magistrate, will require our Obedience to none but such; and St. Peter, as if
he had foreseen this difficulty, has restrained the general signification of
that Word, by enumerating the particulars to whom Subjection is due, viz. the
King and his Ministers, to whom only, our Obedience is limited and enjoined.

I can scarce think our Pamphleteer's Objection, page 15. worth the
considering, where he says, that since there can be according to the Opinion I
have advanced, but one rightful Monarch in the Universe, viz. he who is the
direct, and lineal Heir of Adam; because no Prince can make out any such Title;
therefore, their Thrones instead of being supported, are hereby very much
shaken: for a Man need but a small stock of Judgment to discern his premises to
be as true as his inference is false; for wherever the Lawful Heirs are
supposed to be dead or unknown, the actual Possessour has the greatest Right,
and can with as little Justice be dispossessed of what he enjoys, as if he were
the rightful owner; for even as Robbers and Thieves, while they are possessed
of Stolen Goods, have a Title in Law, against all others but the true
Proprietors; insomuch, that it is a Sin for any other to deprive them of such
Goods: So Usurpers have a Title in the Government against all Persons, but the
true Heirs; who alone, and those empowered by them, can legally and justly go
about to molest and disturb them: And where the Usurpation has continued so
long, that the knowledge of the right Heir is lost by the People, it is no
longer to be looked upon as such; but every one is obliged to comply with the
Government, and Governors then established; so that no Prince has any reason
to be Alarmed at this Doctrine, unless this Gentleman can produce the Lawful,
and Lineal Heir to Adam, which I am persuaded will be somewhat an hard matter
to do. Nor are either the Properties or Laws of any Countries endangered, since
they have all the Security that Oaths and Promises can give them for them, and
greater Security Subjects cannot have from their Prince, unless they had a
Power to call their Sovereign to an account for the Maladministration of his
Trust; a thing no Men in their right Wits can pretend to. As for the rest of
our Gentleman's impertinent Cavils about this Matter, I shall not give them the
Honor of an Examination: for he may as well undertake to prove Marriage to be
no Institution of God, because not observed by some Nations, where the Men and
Women without any Ceremony accompany one another promiscuously, as from the
Practice of the Venetians, Netherlands, Poland, Germany, and Aragon (where by
the By, the Case is quite altered from what it once was, by the Conquest of
that Country, by Philip the Second) conclude Monarchy to be a humane Invention.
And thus I think I have sufficiently made out my First Proposition, that
Monarchy is a Divine Ordinance, and undoubted Institution of Nature.

The Second thing I undertook to prove, was, that the Crown according to the
Law of God, Nature and Nations, ought to Descend according to Primogeniture,
and Proximity of Blood; which will, I doubt not, very Evidently appear from the
foregoing Discourse: for if Monarchy be of Divine Right, as I think I have made
more than probable, and that Adam was during his Life Universal Monarch, there
is no question to be made, but that Right was by his Death transferred to his
Eldest Son, and Successor Seth (I call him Eldest, tho Born after Cain, because
God, who as He has given, can take away, had disinherited the latter, for the
Murder of his Innocent Brother Abel; so that, being Excommunicated, and made a
Vagabond, driven from his Parents, and turned into the wide World (as we say)
to seek his Fortune: I reckon of him as if he were not in being.) Nor is this
bare Conjecture, for Cedrenus can tell us, that as (...). Cedren. f. 9.
Adam was Emperor of the World during his Life, so was (...). Cedren. ubi
supra.
Seth after his Decease, his Successor in the Dominion over all Mankind. And
that the rest of the Patriarchs Succeeded, and Governed the World by the same
Right, I take to be beyond Dispute, if this be admitted, as I can see no Reason
why it should not. I am sure of Canaan the Son of Enoch, and Grandchild of
Seth, We have a very remarkable and express Testimony; he was Emperor over all
the World, and lies Buried in an Island of the East-Indian Sea; the Memory
whereof remained there in Tables of Stone in Alexander's time, as Alexander
relates in his Letter to Aristotle, Recorded by lib. 2. cap. 11.
Josephus Ben-Gorion. When after the Universal Deluge, Noah remained Master of
the whole Earth: he by that Right which God and Nature had invested in him,
divided the World amongst his Children, to every one he gave their share, but
over and above that, a kind of Supremacy over the whole, as Lord in chief,
after the old Patriarch's Death, was transferred to his Eldest Son Sem, of whom
his younger Brethren held their Kingdoms in Fee, (...); says the Cedren^^ sol.
12.
Historian, speaking of Sem.

Tho perhaps this Notion of an Universal Empire may seem strange to some; yet
it is the Opinion of not a few Learned Men, That Babel was designed for the
Chief Seat of it: And if Melchisedec be, as I think the Learned Dr. Willet, in
his Commentary on Genesis, has made more than probable, no other than Sem; I
think the Scripture will afford us some very considerable Hints of it, from the
great Respect paid, and offering of part of his Substance to him, as an
Acknowledgment of his Supremacy over the Universe.

But tho there be so good Evidence for this Opinion in History; yet I cannot
think, that it stands in need of it; for it is so expressly and clearly laid down
in several Places of Scripture, that he must industriously shut his Eyes
against Truth, that cannot see it: For, Can any thing be more plain, than this
Text, where God Almighty says to Cain of his Younger Brother Abel; Genesis 4.7.
Unto thee shall be his Desire, and thou shall Rule over Him? Unless by the
Divine Law of Nature such a Right had been annexed to Primogeniture, Would God
have put him in mind of such a Prerogative? We cannot suppose, he did then
bestow it upon him, lest he should take Pet, because his Offering was Rejected,
and his Brother's Accepted: Certainly, there is more Reason to believe, God
would at that time have deprived him of that Pre-eminence, which belonged to
him by Birthright; and that, no doubt, he was afraid would be the Consequence,
from whence sprung the Hatred he bare to Abel: But God was graciously pleased
to remove that Distrust from him, by telling him, That tho he had offended, yet
should not that Prerogative be taken, from him; he should still continue to be
Lord over his Brother: Vid. Calvin, in loc. and S. Chry^^st. Homi^. 18.
To thee shall be his Desire, and thou shall Rule over him. A clearer-Proof
than this perhaps cannot be shown, for Honoring and Obeying Parents, or any
other Moral Duty, except that of doing no Murder, before the Promulgation of
the Decalogue. But if this be not sufficient, it will further appear from the
Blessing given to Jacob by Isaac his Father; where he tells him, He shall be
Lord over his Brethren, Genesis 27.29.
and his Mother's Sons shall how down before him: From which Place, all the
Commentators with one Consent conclude, That a Royal Power was due to the
Eldest Son by Birthright; and certainly, there must have been something more
than ordinary due to the Firstborn, or Esau could never have deserved the
Title of Profane, Heb. 12.16.
which is bestowed upon him by the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. I
know, it is generally agreed to be upon the Account of the Priesthood, which,
together with the rest, was due to the Eldest: And since we have so clear
Evidence for this Right, due to the Eldest by Birth, as appears from Numb. 3.
Verse. 12. where God declares, he had made Choice of the Levites, instead of the
Firstborn, to be Priests; I cannot conceive; why that Prerogative of a
Superiority and Dominion over their Brethren, should be denied to belong to
them by the Law of Nature too, since we have such clear Intimation of it: For
when Jacob blessed his Sons, and told 'em what would happen to 'em in the
latter Days, Genesis 49.3.
he calls Reuben his Firstborn, The Excellency of Dignity, and the Excellency
of Power: Whereby is signified the Right he had by Birth to the Priesthood and
Kingdom, and Double Portion; to which Sense the Chaldee Paraphrase exactly
agrees: But because of his Sins and Transgressions, God had deprived him of
'em, the Priesthood was given to Levi, the Kingdom to Judah, and the Double
Portion to Joseph. Nor are we to look upon Jacob, as taking upon him to dispose
of these Things himself; but only foretelling, what would in due time, by God
Almighty, be brought to pass, and of which they were patiently and cheerfully
to expect the Event. But when Moses, by God's Command, delivered the Law to the
Jews, this Precept of Nature, Of giving a Double Portion to the Firstborn, is
there again repeated and enjoined, and so made a Part of the Positive and
Revealed Will of God, who gives this Reason for it; because He is the Beginning
of his Father's Strength, Deuteronomy. 21.17.
and the Right of the Firstborn is his: Which way of Expression is never used,
but when something is commanded, which by the Law of Nature they were obliged
to the Observation of before. And of this Opinion is the Great Seldom; who
says, It Is enjoined in such a manner, Seldom, de Successionibus, etc. cap. 5.
Ac si recepto antea in gentem more subniteretur, as if it had been the
Constant Practice and Custom of the Nation to observe it before. And in this
Precept it is not to be questioned, Succession to the Royalty is included; for
in the Titulo de Regibus.
Talmud, it is said, Qui praecipuum jus habet in Haereditate, is and in
possessione Regni: ideo filius natu major praeferur minori: i. e. Whoever has
the greatest Right to Succeed in any Inheritance, he ought to be Advanced to
the Throne; and therefore, the Eldest Son is always preferred before the
Younger. And accordingly we are told, That Jehoram succeeded Jehosophat; and
the Reason given, 2 Chronicles 21.3.
Because he was the Firstborn: Which would not have been added, if upon that
account the Kingdom had not been his due.

And if we take the pains to look into History, we shall find the Practice of
the World agreeable in preferring the Eldest Son, before his Younger Brethren.
In Polyphm.
Herodotus can tell us; (...); That it was the Custom of all Nations, for the
Firstborn to enjoy the Royalty: And consonant to this, Lib. 2.
is what we are told out of Trogus by Justine; Artabazanes Maximus natu aetatis
privilegio regnum sibi vindicabat, quod and ordo Nascendi and natura ipsa
gentibus dedit: Artabazanes, the Eldest Son, challenged by the Prerogative of
Age, the Kingdom; to which, by Priority of Birth, and the Law of Nature common
to all People, he had an Undoubted Right. I might here produce a great
Multitude of Quotations from these, as well as other Authors, to show how
Universally this Custom prevailed in all Places; how generally it was Received:
But I shall content my self to take notice of the Unanimous Agreement of the
great Doctors of the Civil and Canon Laws, in this Matter: Ex hoc jure. D. de
Justit. and Jure.
Baldus says positively; Semper fuit, and semper erit, ut primogenitus in
Regno succedat: It always was, and ever shall be, that the Firstborn, (and
next of Blood) Succeeds in the Kingdom. And herein he is followed with the
full Cry of all the Best and Choice Interpreters of both Laws; who, with one
Voice, agree, That in Kingdoms, and other Dignities, which are Indivisible
without Dis-membring, the Eldest Son does entirely Succeed: And this, many of
them, do call the Law of all Nations, derived from the Order of Nature, and
from the Institution of God, and Confirmed by the Canon, Civil, and other
Positive Laws.

Now, what has been said of Primogeniture, in Point of Succession to the
Crown, does so evidently, by Consequence, extend it self to Proximity of blood,
that I shall say no more of it, but proceed to Answer an Objection drawn from
the Holy writ; For say some, If this Birthright be so sacred a thing, as I have
asserted it to be; How comes it to pass, that so many have been deprived of it?
How came the tribe of Judah to get the Scepter from Reuben? And, Why was
Solomon advanced to the Throne, to the total disinherison of his elder Brethren?

I answer, That those that make this objection, never consider that this was
all done by the express command of him, who rules in the Kingdom of men, Dan.
4.25.
and gives it to whomsoever he will: it is well known that David of the Tribe of
Judah was immediately chosen by God himself, and appointed to be Ruler of his
own People; and it was by an express warrant from the same God, 1 Chronicles. 28.5.
that Solomon was made his successor, as appears from the mouth of David
himself; 1 Chronicles. 28.5.
And of all my Sons (says he) for the Lord has given me many Sons, 1 Chronicles.
29.1.
he has chosen Solomon my Son, to sit upon the Throne of the Kingdom of the
Lord over Israel. So that these and the like Instances (and none other can be
produced) signify nothing to the purpose.

And if we do but impartially weigh the Recognitions of so many several
Parliaments; as I have taken notice of above, we shall find this great Truth
openly and fully acknowledged; it is unanimously agreed, That the King's of
England come to the Crown, not by any Human Right, but by the Laws of God and
Nature.

And thus, I think, I have effectually proved my Two First Propositions, viz.
That Monarchy, Jure Divino and Naturali, is Founded in Paternity; and, in the
next place, That the Crown of England is, and ought to be inseparably annexed
to the Proximity of Blood, by the Laws of God and Nature, and this Realm, Cons.
Rot. Parl. 1. E. 4. Rot. Parl. 1. R. 3. 1 Jac. c. 1.
(if we may give Credit to the Declarations of so many Parliaments, of
different Humors and Tempers.) So that, it will prove no very hard Matter, to
make good what I undertook in the Third place; to wit, That an Act to Exclude
his R.H. would be utterly Unlawful, and ipsofacto, void; because, contrary to
all Laws, Divine, Natural, and Humane; and so it ought to be adjudged, when
ever it comes to the Question before the Reverend Judges; For the Laws of God
and Nature are the Rays and Emanations of the Divinity, they are Undeniable,
Eternal, and Immutable, and therefore cannot be Altered or Impeached by any
Humane Power or Authority, but only by the God of Nature it self, who did
Originally ordain them; and so many and plentiful are the Instances of Statutes
expounded void, because contrary to the Law of Nature, that it would be loss of
time to take notice of, or enumerate any of them, and no doubt upon this ground
it is, that those two great and learned Dectors of the Law, Jason and Angelus,
do positively aver, that tho the Eldest Son of a King be either a Fool or a
Madman (either of which qualifications are as pernicious to the Government,
every whit as being a Papist) yet can he not be excluded from Succession.

And I doubt not, it may be made evidently appear, that Succession of the Crown
to the next Heir of the Blood Royal, is so Fundamental and Primary a
Constitution of this Realm, so ancient and received a Custom, that against it
There never has been, nor ought to be any dispute: as His Argument of the Case
of the Postnati, page 36.
the Lord Chancellor Egerton will inform us: and if we look into our Ancient
Records we shall find more than one Parliament declaring, that Jura Sanguinis
nullo Jure civili dirimi possunt. And it is held by several great Lawyers, that
a Prerogative in Point of Government, cannot be restrained or bound by Act of
Parliament: And surely then much less can such an Act he of any force in so
high a case as this of Succession; for certainly, if this were once allowed,
the Government would cease to be Hereditary, and degenerate into an Elective
One; And it is not to be questioned, but such a Power as enables the Parliament
to break off one link, may give them a sufficient Authority to shatter in
pieces the whole sacred Chain, and totally exclude the present Line, and
together with that, Monarchy; which, I pray God, may not be the bottom of too
many Men's designs, let them gild over their proceedings with never so specious
and popular Pretenses; and no doubt, out of a provident Foresight of the
Calamity, and dismal consequence of such designs, it was that the Lords, and
Commons did declare, That they could not assent in Parliament to any thing that
tended to the Disinherison of the King, Rot. Parl. 42. E. 3. Number. 7.
and the Crown (which this Bill of Exclusion evidently does) whereunto they
were sworn; no, tho the King himself should desire it. But what comes more home
to the point, is the answer of Richard Duke of York, to the Kings Friends, who
urged an Act of Parliament against him; who told them, That such an Act was to
take no place, Rot. Parl. 39. H. 6. Numb. 10, etc.
nor was of any force or effect against Him, the Right Inheritor of the Crown,
as it accorded with God's Laws, and all Natural Laws. And this Answer of the
Duke's, is, by express Act of Parliament then assembled, recognized and
acknowledged to be Good, True, Just, Lawful, and Sufficient: so that, in
effect, we have an ingenuous and full Declaration as can be, that the Right of
Succession is absolutely unimpeachable by any Humane Power; and that the Kings
of England in possession, their Heirs and Successors in reversion, have an
indefeasible right to the Crown, which they cannot be deprived of by any
Authority, less than that which invested them therewith.

Besides, it is a Maxim of our Law, That as the King never Dies, (which is meant
of that Political Capacity; which, in that very Moment one King Expires, is
Superadded to the Body Natural of the Next Heir, whereby he immediately becomes
King: And this Political Capacity being of that Sublimity, that it is no ways
subject to any Human Imbecilities of Infamy, Crime, or the like, it draws all
Imperfections and Incapacities whatsoever from that Natural Body, where with it
is Consolidate, and (as it were) Consubstantiate; so the Crown, once gained,
takes away all Defects, removes all manner of Bars and Lets laid in the way to
the Succession: For it is impossible to hinder the Descent to the Next Heir;
because that being removed beyond the Reach of a Mortal Arm, must go exactly in
that Course prescribed by God and Nature; and being joined to, and indivisible
in one Royal Person thereby, this later Capacity being added to the former,
purges, eo instante, all Obstructions of what Nature soever: And tho his
Natural Body, before this Union, was subject to the Lash of the Law; yet, upon
the Conjunction of this Political and Immortal Capacity with it, they grow
inseparable: And consequently, by reason of those Divine Perfections inherently
and indubitably annexed to that Coalition, the Prince, what ever Crimes he
might have formerly been guilty of, is now placed above Humane Justice, and
answerable solely to God Almighty; to whom, and none other, he owes Subjection.

And thus it has been expressly resolved by all the Judges of England, in the
Case of Two Princes, who were as much Disabled, as an Act of Parliament could
^o it: The First was, when Henry the Sixth, by the Assistance of the Great Earl
of Warwick, reassumed the Crown; for Edward the Fourth had passed an Act to
disable him from all Regiment, and attaint him of High Treason: But
notwithstanding all this, the Judges were of Opinion, That in the same Moment
that Henry Reassumed the Crown, the said Parliamentary Incapacities were (to
all Intents) discharged and avoided; not because (as our Pamphletier, page 17.
would have us believe) Edward was not Lawful King: For if either Right of
Blood, or an Act of Parliament could give him a Just Title, there is no doubt to
be made, but he had One: But for this very Reason, That the Crown, once gained,
takes away all Defects.

The next Instance is of Henry the Seventh, who being once possessed of the
Throne, the Reversal of his Parliamentary Attainder was unanimously agreed by
the Judges to be unnecessary; for That the Crown takes away all Defects in
Blood, and Incapacities by Parliament: And that from the Time the King did
assume the Crown, 1 H. 7.4. Fitz. Parl. pl. 2. Plowdens Com. 238. Co. 1. In.
stit. 16. a.
the Fountain was cleared, and all the said Attainders and Corruptions of
Blood, and other Impediments absolutely discharged. And this being constantly
received for Law ever since, I cannot but wonder this Gentleman should go about
to call in question the Judgment of so Many, and so Great Lawyers, by his
Impertinent Cavils; for 'twas upon this Precedent, that the Lord Keeper Bacon
did advise Q. Elizabeth, not to Repeal that Statute, wherein she was made
Illegitimate. Nor was it upon the Account of any Attainder, that the House of
York forbore so long time to pursue their Claim to the Crown; but want of
Interest: And when he tells us, The King of France was the more inclined to
send over his Son Lewis, because King John was Attainted of Treason, and so,
incapable of taking the Crown, he must certainly have forgot himself, or he
would not have made use of an Instance (granting it to be true) so contrary to
his Purpose: For it seems, the English, when he came to the Crown, had but a
very slender Opinion of such a Bar, or else they would never have admitted him;
But the King of France was glad of any Pretense, tho never so Ridiculous: So
that, we see the Judges were not without Precedent to direct their Proceedings
by; and such a one (if the Story be true) as had the Approbation of the whole,
or greatest part of the Kingdom.

But that Objection which has most show of Force, is drawn from the Recognition
of Richard the Third's Title, which he takes a great deal of Pains to set off
to the best Advantage: But I think, he might have spared his Pains, if he had
but considered, that those Men that, to Advance an Usurper to the Throne, had
(contrary to their Knowledge) declared all the Late King's Children to be
Bastards, would scarce stick at Declaring (contrary to all Right and Justice,
which they had already so notoriously violated) an Attainder of Treason to be
of sufficient Force to debar the Issue of the Duke of Clarence, who were not in
a Condition to assert their Title for the Crown, without considering the Truth
of it.

And it is considerable, that all those Acts made in Contradiction of one
another, were never heeded or esteemed by either Party, or ever detered, either
the Heads of 'em from pursuing their Claim, or the People from assisting them
in it; and the End of all such Statutes was to vanish into Smoke, and come to
nothing; and, for the most part, never to have the Honor of a Repeal. Besides,
a Thing done in Tempestuous and Turbulent Times, is not to Guide and Direct our
Actions now, especially since we have the Sense of so many several and
different Parliaments; and therefore the more Remarkable, to the contrary;
wherein it is declared, That the Succession of the Crown of England, is
inseparably Annexed to Proximity of Blood; and, That a Title of this Sublimity
and Grandeur, is not at all Impeachable even by Act of Parliament. And besides,
the Parliament of 39. H. 6. does make their Declaration to the manifest
Prejudice of the King in Possession, who was Ordained also by the same Accord
then made, to Reign over them during his Life; and whom, for that Reason, it
must be presumed, they would have favored, if they had found but the least
color so to have done.

And if the Actual Possession of the Throne, as has been so often Recognized by
our Ancient Parliaments, which were neither over-awed by a prevailing Faction,
nor seduced by the plausible Pretenses of designing Demagogues, be by the Law
of God and Nature, invested with the Sovereignty; it does most evidently
follow, that the Heir Apparent, or Next of Blood, is, by the same Laws,
entitled to the Crown; and consequently, the People have no more Right to
Dis-inherit the One, than to Depose the Other; and doubtless, it is the same
Sin: As to cause the Abortion of an Embryo, and to take away the Life of a
Child already Born, are both alike Murder; for both have an equal Right to
Life, tho they differ in the Time of the Enjoyment of it: And so have the
Possessor, and the Heir, to the Throne; only One is actually Master of it, and
the Other in due Time must and ought so to be.

But to affirm, (says this Gentleman) that the King and Parliament have not a
Power to Change the Direct Order of Succession, is to deny the Government a
Power to Defend it self. To this I Answer. It Is much more likely, that altering
the Course of the Legal Descent of the Crown, is the more probable way of
bringing us into Anarchy and Confusion: Besides, acording to his Notion of
Self-preservation, a Prince that Governs not according to the pleasure and good
liking of the People, may be Deposed, or else they would be deprived of a power
of preserving themselves: A very peaceable Notion, I assure you; and such as
would render every Government, where it was admitted, most extremely Happy. But
it ought to be proved, That the admitting of a Popish King would be an
Infallible Cause of the Ruin of us all; or else, I much fear, this adored
principle of Self-preservation, will not Justify the Exclusion of his R.H. For
nothing less than absolute Necessity, will authorize a Man to kill his Enemy,
as when he endeavors by violence to Rob him of his Life: and it is then only he
can lawfully Kill him se Defendendo: But that he should be allowed to destroy
any, that out of a Groundless Jealousy he apprehends may do him a Prejudice,
is the Highest Degree of Madness, and Destructive of all Humane Society: For if
it were allowed for one to Kill all he is afraid of, we could expect nothing
but Murders and Massacres, nothing but unavoydable Confusion and Ruin. It Is
convenient, I grant, to bind such as we have just Ground to be apprehensive of,
to their good Behavior, and tie up their Hands according to the Laws of the
Land: And certainly, one would think, this would be sufficient Security in the
Case of his R.H. if too many of those that so zealously stickle for the Bill,
had not a deeper Design, than that they give out, even to Lay the Axe to the
Root of Monarchy it self: It Is that they aim at, and have such a Thirst to
destroy under this specious pretense, and set up their adored Idol, their
beloved Commonwealth: And if they had not this color for their Proceedings, I
am very much afraid, they would be guilty of some what worse. Nor am I in this
at all Uncharitable, since this Gentleman has page 19. given a very excellent
Hint to Justify such a Design: For he tells us, That the Crown is not a bare
Inheritance, but an Inheritance accompanying an Office of Trust; and that if a
Man's Defects render him incapable of the Trust, he has also Forfeited the
Inheritance. Can any thing be more full and plain? May not, upon this account,
the King (in Possession) be Removed, as well as an Heir secluded? So true is
that Observation, That all the Pamphlets writ upon this Subject; tho they begin
with the Duke, yet constantly End with the King: They would have us believe,
they only aim at the preservation of His Majesty, their Religion, Lives, and
Liberties; when in truth, they are so resolutely bent upon the Destruction of
Monarchy it self, that in spite of all their art, they are not able to
disguise their Intent; but let such things slip from their pens unawares, that
at once makes a perfect Discovery of their Hypocrisy and Villainy. But if this
will not do, he can tell us. That there is a Supreme, Uncontrollable Power
lodged in the King and Parliament; from whence he collects, if he intends to
prove any thing, That they have a power to command, and exact our Obedience to
every thing they enjoin: An Opinion, I assure you, that were there neither
Heaven nor Hell, God nor Devil, would very much conduce to the Peace and good
Government of Mankind; and you know, Mr. Hobbs has done very fair for one,
toward the driving such Scare-Crows out of the World. But you see, by this how
strangely he is put to it, to bouy up his sinking Cause; but he does as well as
he can Drowning Men catch hold of any thing.

But above all things, I cannot sufficiently admire his Confident challenge of
producing any one instance where ever any Nation, not under the immediate force
of a Conqueror, did admit of a Prince, of a Religion contrary to that
established; when Scriptures the History of the Byzantine Empire, and the
Annals of our own Country, could have furnished him with so many examples: for
how many Idolatrous Kings, do we read of its Holy-Writ, that without any
disturbance of opposition succeeded and governed in Israel, though their
inclinations were well known before their coming to the Crown? but we hear not
one word of Disinheriting or Deposing them, (unless by such as are there
bran^ed with the Name of Traitors and Villains,) except by the immediate and
most visible Act and Finger of God himself, who being the Creator of Nature,
can alone (when it pleases him) control her Methods and Operations; and
certainly if any such Power there, had been lodged any where in the Jewish
Government, we should have found it put in Execution, I doubt not, by that
People, whose Religion was much more inconsistent with the I^olatry of the
Heathens, than ours with that of Rome, and so they had the greater Obliga^i^ns
to endeavor to prevent the Succession of an Idolatrous Prince: and if we may
ta^e any measure from the Primitive Christians, we shall not find any thing to
countenance our present proceedings; for after their Religion was become the
established one of the Empire, I cannot hear that they endeavored to seclude
Julian the Apostate (...) the Imperial Diadem, though they were no less
acquainted with his Inclination to these Religion, than his natural Temper. Nor
do I ever find the Orthodox party talking of impeaching the Right of
Succession, when an Arrian (under whom they were som^times as severely
persecuted, as ever their Ancestors were in the time of the Heathens) Was the
Heir Apparent; 'twas a Doctrine unheard and unthought of amongst them. They had
recourse only to the true Christian Arms of Prayers and Tears for their
Defense: For the Church in those days was not so literally Militant, as it has
been of late. And in our own Country, have we not seen a Mary and Elizabeth,
Princesses of a contrary Religion to that established, Succeed to the Throne
without any resistance, or at least such as rather strengthened, than shook
their Throne. Queen Elizabeth met with none, and that against Queen Mary was
rather an Offer, than any thing else.

But here I cannot sufficiently wonder at the disingenuity of this Pamphleteer,
who has in more places than one endeavored to insinuate, that all those who
either oppose or are persuaded of the Injustice and illegality of the Bill of
Exclusion, are Patists, or at least Popishly Affected; and therefore he cites
the Opinion of two great Romanists, hoping thereby to convince them of the
Truth of his Assertion; but he either forgets, or rather maliciously conceals,
that the Doctrine of disinheriting and deposing Kings, and of the Natural
freedom of the People, is rank Popery: first broached and introduced by the
Schoolmen, and since zealously maintained by the Jesuits, and other great Men
of the Papal Faction; and I much fear whether if he would ingenuously confess
the Truth, he must not acknowledge himself beholden to one of them for the
greatest part of his Discourse; So true is it, that tho our Phanaticks (amongst
whom, if I am not misinformed, our Author is or at least once was a leading
man) and the Papists, tho they look contrary ways; yet like Sampsons Foxes,
they are tied together at the tails, they are alike the firebrands and
disturbers of all Countries where they come; So that I think I need not be
concerned at the Sentiments of men so devoted to the Roman See, as Card. Fisher
Sir, Thomas More.
those he mentions. But for Sr. W. Raleigh; whose Testimony, both as a
Protestant and a Judicious, Learned Man, I very highly value, I am not at all
in pain; for if a Man do but look into the Quoted place (to which I refer my
Reader) he will find him of quite another opinion than this Gentleman, who has
strangely misrepresented him, would have us believe; from whence you may take
the measure of this Man's Ingenuity, his Candor and Integrity; but by this time
I think you are well enough acquainted with him.

And thus I have run through this whole Pamphlet, and I hope given a clear
answer to every thing of any moment by him advanced; and as for some few little
trifling passages not worth considering, I have passed them over, without
taking any notice of them. And from a due Consideration of the whole matter,
every man must infer, that the Kingdom of England is an Hereditry Monarchy,
wherein the Succession of the Crown is inseparably by all Laws Divine, Natural
and Humane, annexed to Proximity of Blood, and that all the Humane Acts and
Powers in the World cannot hinder the Descent of it to the next Heir. And that
whoever does but consult and examine impartially the History and Records of
this Nation, must conclude, That nothing can be drawn from thence to savor the
contrary opinion, which was the thing I undertook to prove.

FINIS.
If the Reader will be pleased to take the Pains, He is desired, to Amend this,
and what other Errata's, that have Occurred, by Reason of the Author's absence
from the Press.
