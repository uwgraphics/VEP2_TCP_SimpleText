By the Queen.
A Proclamation inhibiting the sowing of Woad.
WHereas the Queens most excellent Majesty understanding heretofore by
complaint of sundry of her good Subjects using Clothing, Cillage and Dairies,
(things necessary to be maintained in her Realm for the common good of her
loving Subjects above any new devise) that there was an universal attempt of
breaking and tilling of very fertile grounds to so we Woad, upon a private and
inordinate gain practiced, to the manifest griese of her people in diverse
places where the same was then used, without all good order, measure, or
moderation, did by her Highness Proclamation by advice of her Counsel
published, straightly forbid and inhivite upon grievous pains, that no manner
of person should break up, or cause to be broken up, any manner of ground, of
what nature soever it were, for the use or purpose to sow or plant Woad in,
nor that any person should continue any ground already broken up for that
purpose to the use of Woad, but in such sort and orber, as in, and by the said
Proclamation is expressed. Sithence which time it has followed, that partly by
the remissness of the Justices of Peace, to whom the execution of the said
Proclamation was specially committed: and partly by the iniquity of covetous
and disobedient persons, who have not had that due regard thereof which
appertained, the said universal attempt of sowing Woad, has rather increased
then diminished. Her Majesty therefore by advice of her Counsel, straightly
wills and commands, that no manner of person or persons, of what degree
soever the same be, shall directly or indirectly after the publication hereof,
break up, or cause to be broken up any manner of grounds, of what nature soever
it be, within this her Majesty's Realm of England, or any other her
Dominions, for the use or purpose to sow or plant Woad, nor any ground shall
hereafter convert or employ to the sowing or planting of Woad, which heretofore
have been broken up for other purposes, nor that any person do hereafter
continue for that purpose any ground already broken up or plowed for sowing or
planting of Woad, until there may be a further consideration had, how the same
may be tolerated with such moderation and conueniencie, as may be beneficial
for the Common weal, and no ways prejudicial to any of her loving Subjects
(which her Majesty does most specially regard) upon pain that whosoever shall
attempt any thing to the contrary hereof, the persons so doing, and the
workmen that shall be therein employed, shall be committed to the next common
prison by the next Justice of Peace, and there to continue until certificate be
made thereof to her Majesty's privy Counsel by such as shall commit them, so
as order may be taken for further punishment of the persons offending,
according to the quality of their offense.

And further, her Majesty wills and requires all Justices of Peace, to
whose trust and care her Highness has and does chiefly commit to execution
of this her Proclamation, that they and every of them do faithfully,
diligently and effectually, demean and endeavor themselves in the due
performance thereof, according to the confidence which her Highness reposeth
in them: Otherwise her Highness has given express commandment, that every
such Justice of Peace, showing negligence or remissness therein, shall be
called to answer both the same, and his former offense in that behalf, and
shall receive such condign punishment for the same, as to the quality of such
offense and contempt shall appertain.

Given at her Highness Manor of Richmond the eight and twentieth day of
Match 1600. in the two and fourtieth year of her Majesty's most gracious
reign.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Queens most excellent
Majesty.

Anno Dom. 1600.
