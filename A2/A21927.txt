By the Queen.
A Proclamation commanding all persons upon the Borders of England, to keep
Peace toward Scotland, upon the like Proclamation by the King of Scotts
toward England.
WHere we by our Proclamation the Summer last made known to all our loving
Subjects, what we had resolved should be precisely observed, as well by our
principal Officers, as all other persons under them agreeable unto the like
others, published by our good brother the King of Scotts, for staying all
courses of violence or injustice, to be committed by any of either part;
Forasmuch as we are informed daily and hourly, of the continual spoils and
outrages committed in both Realms, even during the time of the late treaty,
as well as since the determination thereof; we do no we by these presents
notify to all our Subjects, that although our meaning is not in any sort to
ouersee the redresses of any injuries, which our Subjects shall or have
received; Yet forasmuch as our good brother the King of Scotts does by his
special letters to us as otherwise, she we himself offended mightily with his
bad Officers upon his frontiers, for the breach of his commandment, and is
desirous to yield us and our Subjects all due satisfaction, according to
honor and Justice, agreeable to all former and late Treaties, having for that
purpose caused order to be taken by the Wardens of his Borders, and for
delivery of Pledges, according to the Indents agreed upon by our late mutual
Commissioners; We have thought it our part at this time, to show our selves no
less conformable to quietness then we find the King of Scotts to be, and
therefore attending the issue of such proceedings, as shall be further agreed on
between us the two Princes, we do straightly charge and command all our
Wardens of the three Marches, and all other our Officers and Subjects within
the said Marches, to live in peace and quietness, without offering any manner
of incursion, stealth or injury, privately or publicly, whereby they may be
reputed authors of any breach or interruption of that good work, which we
have in hand; Wherein of the contrary part, if any offense shall be offered them
by the Opposites, which shall not presently be satissied, according to the
laws of the Frontiers, we will not only leave our Subjects to their liberty
of just revenge, but further will enable them with our own extraordinary
powers, according to the care and love which we have and ever will use toward
them, whom God has committed to our charge. And where our good brother the
King of Scotts has in this kind acquainted us with his purpose, to publish a
Proclamation to the like intent, that the Opposites may take notice of this our
determination, and thereby seriously conform themselves to correspondencie in
all actions, We will and command our Wardens to cause this to be published in
all places publiue within their Offices, and like wise to give knowledge
thereof to the Wardens Opposite in Scotland, and other Officers of Scotland
upon the Frontiers.

Given under our Signet at our Manor of Greenewich the xiii. day of August in
the xxxix. year of our Reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty. 1597.
