By the King.
A Proclamation prohibiting the Importation of Allome, and the Buying, or
Spending thereof in any His Majesty's Dominions.
JAMES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting.
Whereas by two several Proclamations heretofore by Us published, the one in
the seventh year, and the other in the twelfth year of Our Reign, for sundry
causes therein expressed; we signified our express pleasure, and straightly
inhibited, as well the Importation, as the expense of any foreine Allome within
any our Realms or Dominions; thereby charging and commanding all persons
whatsoever, as well Our natural borne Subjects, as Denizens or Strangers, That
none of them should at any time then after attempt or presume to bring, or
cause to be brought into these Our Realms of England, Scotland, or Ireland, or
into any other Our Dominions, or into any the Ports, Havens, Creekes, or places
of any of them, any Allome in greater or lesser quantities, made or to be made
in any foreign part or place whatsoever, or any Allome made here within this
Kingdom, after that the same had been once exported; upon pain of forfeiture
of all and every quantity and quantities of Allomes, so brought, or caused to
be brought into Our said Realms or Dominions, contrary to Our Commandment
signified in that behalf, and also upon pain of Our indignation and
displeasure, and of such further pains, penalties, and punishments, as are
therein more at large expressed.

And whereas by a late Commission awarded by Our Commandment, to diverse persons
to enquire and examine upon Oath, or otherwise, in sundry of the Northern
parts, and places of this Our Realm, of the due observation and performance of
the Premises, it was manifestly proved, and certified by the return of the
said Commission, That Our Royal will and pleasure so often published in that
behalf, has not been accordingly obeyed and observed; but that through the
negligence and conniuence of some officers, and others in the several Ports
and Creekes of this Kingdom, there is as great a Commerce, and Intercourse
maintained between the Importers of foreign Allome, and sundry Tradesmen, the
Buyers and spenders of Allome, as if the same had not at all been by Us
inhibited, and restrained. We therefore being sensible of the neglect of Our
said former Proclamations published in this behalf, have thought good to
revive, and renew the same: And do hereby signify and declare, unto all and
every Our loving Subjects, and others, Our express will and pleasure to be;
That Our said former Proclamations, and every Clause, Inhibition, and
Prohibition, or any other thing therein contained, shall be from henceforth
duly observed and obeyed, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and to incur
such further penalties and punishments, as We, or Our Privy Council, or our
Treasurer of England for the time being, shall think fit to impose upon all
and every the offenders and delinquents in that behalf. And further We will,
That the Buyers, and Traders in Allomes so imported, or to be imported, as
aforesaid, shall incur and sustain the like penalties, punishments and
forfeitures, as the Importers of the same are, or ought to incur by virtue or
tenor of Our said former Proclamations. And that all such Searchers, and
Officers in all and every Our Ports, by whose means, conniuencie, or
negligence, such Allome, as aforesaid, is or shall be suffered, or caused to
be landed, sold or spent within our said Realms or Dominions, after due
proof shall be thereof had, made and certified by Commissioners appointed or
to be appointed in that behalf, or otherwise shall be left to the discretion
of Our high Treasurer of England for the time being, to be by him punished, by
the loss of his or their office or place, or by imprisonment, or otherwise,
for such his or their negligence or offense in the premises.

And whereas by the disbursements and expense of sundry great sums of money,
by Us heretofore made in and about the said Allome works in this Our Realm,
the same are now brought to such perfection, as that they do annually yield,
not only a sufficient quantity of Allome, for the necessary use and service of
Our own Realms and Dominions, but also a surplusage of good quantity to be
transported into foreign parts for supply of their wants: We minding the
maintenance of Our said Allome works, and intending to provide for the same:
Do therefore straightly charge and command, That no foreign Allome, nor any
English Allome, that shall be once transported, and afterward returned from
foreign parts, shall be bought, sold, uttered, or spent within any Our
Realms or Dominions, other then such English Allome, as heretofore has been,
or hereafter shall be made by our Agents, Deputies, or Factors at Our own
Allome works; and which has not been already transported and returned, as is
before forbidden. And We do hereby straightly charge, and command all and
singular person, and persons, as well Our natural borne Subjects, as Denizens
or Strangers, Merchants, Mariners, Artificers, and others; That none of them,
nor any other person whatsoever do attempt hereafter to importe, buy, sell,
or vent, or cause to be imported, bought, sold, or vented, any such foreign,
or English Allome, as is before mentioned or forbidden to be imported, or
sold, as aforesaid, upon pain of forfeiture of all such Allome, to be seized
to Our use; And for want of such seizure, to forfeit the value of all such
Allome, as shall be so imported, or come to their or any of their hands, or
possession, or bought, sold, spent, or vented by them or any of them, and upon
such further penalties, and punishments, as We, or Our Privy Counsel, or Our
Treasurer for the time being shall think fit to inflict upon every such
offender. And for the better finding out and discovery of the said offenders;
We are well pleased, and do hereby require and command, That Our Treasurer,
Chancellor, and Barons of Our Exchequer for the time being, shall and may awarde
such, and so many Commissions, as they shall think meet to be directed to
discreet and fit persons in all, or any Our Ports, or elsewhere, to inquire of
and examine upon oath, or otherwise all such persons, as are or shall be
suspected to have heretofore offended, or which hereafter shall offend
against this or our former Proclamations in this behalf, or any other person
or persons whatsoever for the better finding out, and discovery of the said
offenses, and offenders, as is before mentioned. To the end that as well the
Importers of all such Allome, as the Buyers, Sellers, Spenders, and Receivers
thereof may receive such condign punishment, by fine or otherwise for their
offenses, as by Our said Treasurer of England for the time being, or by Our
Court of Exchequer shall be thought fit. And in case such Allome shall not or
cannot be taken or found to be seized; That then every such offender shall
forfeite and pay to the hands of Our Agent, or Agents in London in this
behalf, the full value of such Allome, as the said offenders heretofore have
or hereafter shall have imported, bought, sold, vented, or received, as
aforesaid: And Our further will, and pleasure is, and We do hereby declare,
that whatsoever Our said Treasurer, or Our said Agent, or Agents have already
done, or shall do hereafter against any offender or offenders in requiring, and
taking the forfeiture of any Allome, or the value thereof so imported, or
uttered, as aforesaid, or in the mitigating and taking any less some then the
value of the same of any such of fender in the Premises or otherwise,
according to ye good discretion of Our said Treasurer, Agent, or Agents, We do,
and will from time to time approve and allow of by these presents, And this
signification of our pleasure, shall be as well unto our said Treasurer, Agent, and
Agents for the time being, as unto all and every such Co^missioner, and
Commissioners, as have heretofore been, or hereafter shall be employed in or
about this Our service, a sufficient warrant, and discharge in that behalf,
without any account to be by them, or any of the^, respectively yielded to Us,
Our Heirs, or Successors, and without incurring any penalty in the doing and
excuting this Our service, and Royal Commandment. And forasmuch as heretofore
diverse great quantities of Allome have been imported into this Realm, under
the name and names of sundry poor Mariners and others, which are not able to
pay the value thereof, nor give satisfaction for the same; Our will and pleasure
is, the better to avoid such frauds, and deceits in the time to come, That in
whatsoever Ship or Vessel any such Allome in greater or lesser quantity shall
be found, or discovered to be so imported, and to be shifted away, that seizure
thereof cannot be made; That then such Mariners, or others, who shall so
import, or color the said Allomes, shall not only be punished as aforesaid,
but that every Master, or Owner of such Ship or Vessel, wherein such Allome
shall be so imported and shifted away, as aforesaid, shall forfeit to Us the
value of the same Allome: And that such Ship or Ships shall be arrested, and
stayed by the officers of every Port respectively, until the said forfeiture
be duly answered, and paid to the hands of Our said Agent or Agents, or such
others as they shall appoint in that behalf. And for the better execution of
the premises, We do straightly charge, and command all Justices of Peace,
Majors, Shiriffes, Constables, Headboroughs, Tithingmen, and all other Our
Officers and Ministers, as well of Our Admiraltie, as otherwise, and all other
Our loving Subjects, to whom it shall, or may appertain, That they and every
of them at all time and times hereafter, and from time to time be ayding, and
assisting to Our said Agent, and Agents, and to such our Commissioners, as
shall be from time to time appointed, for or about this Our service; And also
to be from time to time ayding and assisting to all our Customers, Collectors,
Searchers, Waiters, and to all such other person and persons, as shall be
authorized by Our said Agent, or Agents, for the searching, seizing, taking,
and carrying away of all such Allome imported, or hereafter to be imported,
contrary to this Our Royal Prohibition and Commandment: And if any person or
persons shall be found privily, or secretly to oppose, or animate any others to
contradict, or withstand them, in the due execution of this Our service and
Royal Commandment; That then We do by these presents straightly charge and
command, all and every Our said Officers respectively, That every such person
or persons, shall be apprehended and brought before Our Treasurer for the time
being, to receive such order and condign punishment, as shall be thought meet
to be inflicted upon him or them for the same.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the sixteenth of March, in the fifteenth
year of Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the one
and fifty.
