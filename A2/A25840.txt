THE ARMIES LETANIE, Imploring the Blessing of God on the present proceedings
of the Army.

By the Author of Mercurius Melancholicus.

Printed in the Year 1647.

The Armies Letany.
SInce that no wise man dares to say,
Put the Army if they list they may
Save us or bring us to decay:
Therefore let us pray.
From any Soldier whose intent
Is to ore-awe the Parliament,
And with his pay will not be content.
Libera nos.
From Sutlers wives with faces tallow,
Who with their Trulls the Army follow,
From a Commander in chief, whose wit is shallow.
Libera nos.
From a Soldier that swears, yet dares not fight,
But would plunder London if he might,
From meeting a party late in the night.
Libera nos.
From a Trooper that is mounted on a lean jade,
And of cutting throats has learnt the trade;
From digging with a sword instead of a Spade.
Libera nos.
Frim bed-cord Match and priming Powder,
From hearing the Drum speak louder and louder,
From him that grows poor, and yet waxes prouder.
Libera nos.
From underminings and counterminings,
From Soldiers groans and women's whinings,
From Booker and Lillies false divinings.
Libera nos.
From Mortar Pieces, and Hand Grenades,
From Blockings up, and Barracadoes,
From discontented Reformadoes.
Libera nos.
From Southwark-men, who are but Treachours,
From Country Fools, and City Lechers,
From Sheriffs, Bailiffs, and Counter-catchers,
Libera nos.
From buying of our peace with money,
From a false-hearted knave, whose words are honey,
From a Whores temptations who has a hot --
Libera nos.
From Harunies Pamphlets, and his fine Stories
Of Asses, Mules, and Dromedaries,
From Presbyterian Consistories,
Libera nos.
From a Buffe-coat blade that needs will preach,
From the doctrine the Anabaptists teach,
From a Committee-man, or any such horse-leach,
Libera nos.
From good pretenses, and bad intentions,
From hopes of plunder, and base inventions,
From Peter's, when his dreams he mentions,
Libera nos.
From being persuaded out of our lives,
Our coin, goods, children, and our wives,
By those who for our ruin strives,
Libera nos.
From a Winters Plague, and Summers War,
From sleeping till we ruined are,
From those that do delight to jarre,
Libera nos.
From those that now like Princes sing,
Making themselves, but mar the King,
From an Independent point, and a Presbyters sting,
Libera nos.
From laying claim to more then is ours,
From riding on the backs of the higher Powers,
From a brother that laughs and a sister that lowres,
Libera nos.
From an Agitator that storms and frets,
And goodly Monsters each day begets,
From a Scotch mist that devillishly wets.
Libera nos.
From the Parliaments Climactricall year,
From the Sectaries hopes and the Cities fear,
From being forced against our consciences to swear.
Libera nos.
From 1649.
49. and 1652. If the world last so long.
52.
And those Ills we then are like to view,
From old errors that are revived anew
Libera nos.
From a begging Scholar, or small beer Poet,
Who can scarce write sense yet the world must know it,
From him that's scabby and glories to show it.
Libera nos.
From settling all things by the sword,
From those that hate our Sovereign Lord
Let England say with one accord,
Libera nos Domine.
THat it may please thy omnipotence,
Father of all excellence,
All jarres and strifes to banish hence.
Quaesumus te.
That it may please thee our Sir Thomas
May now at length fulfill his promise
In settling the King, who long has been from us.

Consider what a preposterous way
It is to impeach thus every day.

How hard those Propositions be
Were lately shown His Majesty.

Those Roundheads, whose deeds are not square,

For to dispose the Diadem,

With those that would have Anarchie,
And surely settle Monarchy.
Quaesumus te.
That it may please thee, the Army knowing
To what a height things now are growing,
May stop those floods that in are flowing.

To be contented with his own lot,
For he must lose the footing he got.

Who some years past their lives did lose,
'Twixt us and God mai'nt interpose.

Our present dire confusion,
Caused by the Devils delusion.

Thy justice great and good to be,
And what is the end of treachery.

The King may in his Throne be placed,
And those that hate him down be cast.
Quaesumus te.
That it may please thee to let him be
Assured that Aristocracie
Will ever cause confederacy.

That it may please thee he so may reign,
And his Sons when the Crown they gain,
England may ever in peace remain.
Quaesumus te.
So shall we be as once we were,
The Almighties love, the Nations fear,
And then we in each street shall hear
Benedicamus Domino.
FINIS.
