By the King.
FOrasmuch as the Kings Majesty, in his Princely disposition to Justice,
having ever a special care and regard to have repressed the slaughters,
spoils, robberies, and other enormities which were so frequent and common upon
the Borders of these Realms, and to have reduced and settled the said Borders
unto a perfect obedience, to the comfort of his Highness peaceable Subjects:
The course whereof has been heretofore impeded by the difference of the
Borders, English and Scottish, till it has now pleased Almighty God, in his
great blessing to this whole I stand, by his Majesty's lawful succession to
the Imperial Crown of England, not only to remove this difference, but also
to furnish his Highness with power and force sufficient to prosecute that his
Majesty's Royal and worthy resolution, as his Highness has already begun,
entending that the bounds possessed by those rebellious people, being in
fertilitic and all other benefits nothing inferior to many of the best parts
of the whole I Will, shall be no more the extremities, but the middle, and the
Inhabitants thereof reduced to perfect obedience: Yet notwithstanding, as his
Majesty is informed, certain disordered and wicked persons of both Marches,
Enemies to Peace, Justice, and quietness, pretending ignorance of his
Majesty's resolution for the union of the two Realms, already settled in the
hearts of all his good Subjects, and feeding themselves with a smister conceit
and opinion, that no such union should be established and take effect, still
continue in all hind of robbery and oppression, whereunto they are encouraged
by the receipt and harbor granted unto them, their wives, children, goods and
geir in the Inland and peaceable parts of both the Realms, highly to his
Majesty's contempt, and frustrating of his Highness Commission granted to the
effect aforesaid.

And therefore his Majesty for the better satisfaction of all his good
Subjects, who may stand in any doubt of the said Union, and to take away all
pretense of excuse from wicked and turbulent persons, has hereby thought good
to publish and make known to all those to whose knowledge these presents shall
come, That as his Majesty has found in the hearts of all the best disposed
Subjects of both the Realms of all qualities, a most earnest desire, that the
said happy Union should be perfected, the memory of all preterite
Discontentments abolished, and the Inhabitants of both the Realms to be the
Subjects of one Kingdom: so his Highness will with all convenient diligence
with the advice of the Estates and Parliament of both the Kingdoms make the
same to be perfited. And in the mean time till the said Union be established
with the due solemnity aforesaid, his Majesty does hereby repute, hold, and
esteem, and commands all his Highness Subjects to repute, hold, and esteem
both the two Realms as presently united, and as one Realm and Kingdom, and
the Subjects of both the Realms as one people, brethren and members of one
body: And in regard thereof, that every one of them abstain and forbear to
commit any kind of Robbery, Bloodshed, or any other insolence or disorder, or
to receive and harbor the Persons, Wives, Children or Goods the Fugitives and
Outlawes of either of the Realms, but to contain themselves inpeace and
quietness, and all such dutiful behavior as becomes good and loyal
Subjects, certifying all and every person who shall do, practice, or attempt
any thing to the violating of these Presents, that they shall incur the
punishment due to the said Rebels, and that the same shall be executed against
them with all rigor and extremity to the terror of others.

1603.

Majesty. Anno Dom. 1603.
