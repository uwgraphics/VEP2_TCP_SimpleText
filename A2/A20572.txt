Any thing for a quiet life; Or the Married man's bondage to a cursed Wife. To
the tune of Oh no, no, no, not yet; or I Will never love thee more.


ANy thing for a quiet life a Young man feign would (...):
To serve his Master out his time, and please his Mistress too:
His bondage wished for liberty, that he might have a wife
At his own will, for to do still any thing for a quiet life.
In haste he chose himself then one, and quickly was he wed:
But crooked cares of household charge, molested much his head.
His wedding shoes no sooner off, but his commanding wife
Did make him pray, and often say, Any thing for a quiet life.
His wife (young ^asse) grew wa^ton sick, within a day or two:
And longed, she knew not well for what, as many women do.
The daintiest things that could be got, he gave unto his wife,
And for her sake, did undertake any thing for a quiet life.
With Plums, and Pears, and Cherries ripe, of twenty shillings a pound,
With Pescods newly from the bloome, if any might be found.
All which he must go seek forthwith, to please his longing wife:
Thus married men do now and then, to have a quiet life.
Seurn Holidays in one week, she still desired to make,
And every day to lie till noone, for fear her head should ache.
For want of sleep would trouble sore this his young teeming wife.
That would have dyed, if he denied any thing for a quiet life.
For breakefast in her bed she had a Cawdle of Muskadine:
And then with Woodcocks and with Larks, she must rise up and dine:
Where ^e kind-hearted married man, gives welcome to his wife:
For do but crave, quoth he, and have, any thing for a quiet life.
At last her Childbed time drew on, where money must be spent:
In dainty Lawnes and Cambricks fine, or else no way content.
Her house must be as well set out, as any City wife:
Thus filled with care, he must not spare, any thing for a quiet life.
Her Nurses weekly charge likewise, with many a Gossips feast:
He well perceived, when purse grew light, and emptied was his Chest.
The Sugar Plums, and sweet Conserues to please his Childbed wife:
Both night and day, grieved him to say, Any thing for a quiet life.
The second part. To the same tune.


THese Christning charges ouer-past, the Churching day came on:
Against which time, her Tailor must her guarded Gown bring home.
Her Petti-coat of Stammell red, new given unto his wife:
Which charges paid, this Yong-man said, any thing for a quiet life.
Thus after many a brave Carowse, upon her Churching day,
Her tattling Gossips her persuade, in this her rich array,
To take the comforts of the air, and pleasures of a wife:
While he at home, says like a mome, any thing for a quiet life.
Unto her Nurse-child then must she, in iollity and joy,
Some ten miles distance for to see, the usage of her Boy.
Well mounted on an ambling Nagge, with some kind neighbors wife,
Whilst he poor soul must sing in dole, any thing for a quiet life.
Not any meeting in seven miles, where Gallants do repair:
But she will brave it with the best, and for no charges spare.
If fault her Husband find therewith, she proves a frowning wife,
And tyres him so, till he bestow; any thing for a quiet life.
His old acquaintance must he not at any time go see:
Except she grant, and give him leave, or there in presence be.
And then his purse he must yield up to his commanding wife:
While he must say, Good woman pay any thing for a quiet life.
Thus year by year, he spent his days, in troubles and in cares:
A warning fit for him which thus, himself to marriage snares.
The only hell upon this earth, to have an angry wife:
To make us say both night and day, any thing for a quiet lise.
Let Yong-men all take heed by this, how they do match and marry:
He leads a life of liberty, that does the longest tarry.
It is the foremost step to woe, to wed unto a wife,
That will have still, at her own will, any thing for a quiet life.
FINIS.
