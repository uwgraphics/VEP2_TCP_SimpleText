his rent berr s ob. and so upward as it has been used to be paid by the said
perisshens time out of mind of man And that ye same constitucion was good and
lawful it apperyth by that. that diverse of the predecessors of archbishops of
Cau^tebury by their lr^s patent has it confermed and approuid and wha^ some
evil disposed of the perisshens would labor and study to constrwe this
constitucion to other sensis thanne it was made fore. They made explanacions of
the same and ordained that the Mayre and thaldumen of the said Cite and all
the Inhabitantis that would be rebel thereunto should stond acursyd by the same
deed and many other things than expressed orde^ned our holy fader. And
predecessor I^nocencius vij. rate^^eng and confermyng the lr^es of the said
Thomas Archbi^shop addyng and amendyng defautis if any were as more play^^^
apperyth by the lettres off the said Innocent wherein been contained ^ lettres
of the said Thomas. And after as it has been shewid us of diverse Credyble
persons that thought the Mayr Sherefs Ald^rmen the Citezens and the
Inhabitants aforsayd or the more part of them af^yr the old and laudable
Custume in their offryng^s on sondayes and other solemyne and double festys of
the appostles namly whoos e^yns been fastyd yet within four years or there
about Diverse having little regard to the well of their Souls and unkind to
their modyr of the holy church coveting little. and little to mynyshe and
take away the said offryngis The which if they were desire they should encrese
and freely give refuse to offyr but only on sondayes and on the solemn
festys of the Appostles whoos even been fastyd.

And as for other solemn days which be many they said that yt was not
expressyd in the Lettres off Roger Bishop nor in the said constytucion that
they ought to offyr on them neither in the lettres of Innocent nor Thomas
Bishop there was no parfyght sense wherefore they thought they were but void.
And also where we vnnyrstonde. that iij sentensys have been given ageynste one
Robert wright that is to say one in thoos parties and in the Court of Rome for
as myche as he refused to offer according to the rate aforosayde As on sondayes
festis of thappstles whoos vigils been fastyd. But as for these three
Natiuitees. of Saint Stephen saint Johan and the Innocentis he vterly refused
and as many days in Ester and as many days In wytsontyd and the Circumcision
Epyphanye and Ascencion of our Lord and Corpus christi and four vigyles of our
lady. Philyp and Jacob. and ye translacion of sanit Edmondi.

And for as myche as it were peynfull to all Curatis if they should sue. For
every partyculer cause if their parisshens would be froward. And for as myche
as we vndirstonde that our welbelouyd Herry king of England would that all
stryfs and dewte touching the said offringis should be avoided. we will. And
by our pour appostolyck Conferme the lettres off the said Innocent
predecessor and Thomas Archbishop conteynyng the constitucion of the said
Robert to be observed and kept for ever

And over that by these presentys we will and ordeyne that all inhabitantis
houses hoostryes shoppys four yerys paste and that aftyr this shall inhabyte
pay their offryngis according to the rate before said in ye three Natiuitees.
of Saint Stephen Saint Johan and the Innocentys And as many days in Ester and

Four of our lady and Philip and Jacob. And every dedycacion day and every
sunday and the festis of the appostles whoos vigils ben fastyd and other
double and solemn festis.

And more plainly apperith in the lettres of Innocent and Thmas archbisshop
aforesaid. And in all days they have used to offyr. four years paste too
the parisshe Church. With in the bondys whereof the said houses hostryes or
shoppes been set upon ye pain of exco^unicatio^ contained in the letters of
the said archbishop and of the which he shall not be assoyled but if he
satifye the said offryngis or ellis friendly agree with his Curat but of it be
i^ the point of death So that if it happen hem to live or his heir and make dew
satisfaccion And also we give power to the ordenarijs of the said Chirches
where Such offryngis be not paid that they may witheout cytacion sumnarili

The ordinance for ^ulle^ cloth in (...) london
The time of wyllm^ Edward mayr ye xij. yeyre of the reign of king edward the
iiij For to eschew the untruth falshed and desept in late days begone and
now daily used. in the fullyng tey^teryng or setting and sheryng of wullen
o'oth with in the reame of england and being and sellyng of the same clothes as
well with in the cite of london as ellis where with in the said reame. Of y^
whith clothes many often times ben shorn and not fully wet before. Some of them
also after they ben fully wet and shorme. ben than teyntered set and drawn
out in lengenth and bread the which after ward wha^ they ressayne any wet. of
very necessite must shrynke. in to the great hurt and disceyt as well of ye
ky^ges true lege pepull as of all other strangers whith in other landis and
contreis use to bey of ye same to the great rebuke and dyshonor of this reame of
england. whereupon of very lyklyhod but if rathar a remedi behad and purueid
shall necessary ensue the distrucyon of the drapery of ye said land. Therefore
in the common council holden. the xxi day of ^ully last passid it is
establisshed ordened and enacted. that no wullen cloth from thensforth
beshorne except cancellyng but if it be fully wet opon peine of forfetur of
the said cloth in whoes handis stranger or other so every it shall be found.
The sherar thereof shall lose his sherei^ and pay xx. l for every piece cloth. to
ye use of ye comonaltee as often as he shall shere any cloth or clothes not
before fully wet. Also yt no man put or do to be put any wulle^ cloye after it
beshorne upon ye te^tor to be set or drawn out in lengeth and bread upon
pain of forfectur of the same cloth or clothes and he that shall so set it
shall pay for his great falshed for eueri cloye xl. s^ to ye use aforsayd Also
that no freman foreyn nor od put any clothes to sale within the cite of london
which ben shorn without they by before fully wet and shorn i^ no wise to be
put upon ye tey^t or set upon pain of forfectur of ye same clothes and ye
ownar ye rof to be punyshed by ye discression of the mayr and aldirmen.
acordyng to an act made in the time of adam bury the.xxxix. year of king
Edward the.iij. entered in the book of G the leef C xxxv

Also that no man shall retaile any wullen cloth or clothes lynyng nor od but
it be ^ully wet upon pain of forfectur thereof or the valur of the same to
run upon the sellar.

Also for to esschyewe the great untruth and falshed for fullyng te^tery^g and
sheryng of wulle^ clothes in places without The fraunches of this cite where by
the autorite of the same cite is no coreccion and to then te^t that this cite
might be the bett in habyted. It is establyshid ordained and enacted yt no man
dwelling within the said cite free neforeyn put or cause to be put any wullen
clothe to any persons dwelling out of the fraunches of the same to be teyntred
or shorn. and if they be put to fullyng that they be put to free men of this
cite upon pain of.xl. l. of every clothe so put out

Wherefore the mair and thaldirmen of this cite stratli charge and comaunde that
no manner person in habited with in this cite of london put or cause to be put
any cloth or clothes with in this cite or with out to be shorn tentred or fulled
or put too sale any cloth or clothes other wise than as above ordained v^o^
peine before rehessed. And he yt sh^^ espy any cloth or clothes put to be
shorn tey^tred fullid or to be sold other wise. tha^ is a boue said. and that
dewly proved he shall have for every cloth so be him aspied. vi. l.viij. d

The Articles desired by the come^s of the Cite for reformacion of things
p^iudiciall to the same off the mayer aldirmen and comen council to be enacted.
Plese it my lord the mair and. Aldirmen and comen counsel in consideracion
that the cite is brought to great ruin and decaie by reason that So great nombre
of ferme^ dwell and abide out of the liberties and frau^cheis of the cite that
bear lotte another slotte contribucio^s officis nor other charges with fremen
Reseant wtin the cite as by solemn oath eueri freman is bound to do wheryn
if remedy be not provided the city is like to be brought into desola^ion and
vttirly fordoon. To enacte that all fremen of this cite now being free or
hereafter to be free fromhe^seforthe abide dwell and keep their pri^cipall
resedent enhabitacion and howsold wtin this City. or fraunches thereof beri^g
euerych aftir his abilite all manner charges as other freme^ reseant do bear
upon pain to be diss^aunchised. outake and except all manner lords knights
squeres men of law Aso that all manner persons pretending out of the cite and
frau^chise thereof Shall resort unto the cha^breleyn of london wtin iij.
monyths aftir publicacion of this act and find sufficient sewerte of a C.li.
that they and every of them Shall resort unto the city wtin.xij. monythis
next folowi^g the said proclamacion and there keep their contenuall and
principal dwelling and enhabitacio^ with wife and how sold or else utterly to
be diffraunchised

Provided that this act extend not to any fremen Such as for a season y^ is
to sey for recreacio^ or fere of seknese absent them self out of the City So
that all such freme^ resort with their howsold to the cite ageyn wtin ayere
aftir their departur

Provided also that all manner freemen ocupied a bowie the faite of
mar^chanddise in far contreis. after their by^ynes don may resort unto the
cite and enjoy the liberte thereof all colors offrandes excu^yng their
absence to stand in noon effect.

Also when so any person now fre or her aft to be free by redemption have
forfeited or shall happen to forfaite his recognisaunce by reason of noon
resedence wtin the cytee than that person that aftir the furst dai of may ^^tt
coming presentith the said cause of forfeitour to the chamberleyn of london for
the time being upon dew prouf by the presenter made Shall have and enjoy the
fourthparte of the said forfactur for his labor the chamberleyn too bear the
charge af the Suit /

Also it is thought by the comens of ye ote that' M: recorder has not yeue^
his dew attenau^ce upon the mayers nor has not ben p^se^t at all times
requisite when manners touching the comen well have happenned to be treated.

and thereupon prayed th said Ric. to show for his sake favor unto the said

Also it is of truth that one willm^ seg^e servant of the said I. if he were

of being of the said ship and of vitayling and rigging of her to the sea after
the said being Also your besecher has due knowledge from be yonde the sea as
well be writtyng as other wise that generally the marchauntis there have said
that the ship was warners ship. How be it the town of Andwerp will nothing
certefy ayenste hy^ be cause he is Sworn. The said king of Romans subget
and freman of Andwerpe and has labored for them of Andwerp in Normandy to
get ageyn such goodis as they late lost in the zela^d shippis

Also it is of truth that the said william W. occupied the Said ship and
spent her at Caleys in so much that all the Gables sails. And other takell
that belongyd to the said ship either he sold them at caleis or ellis conveyed
them by water unto deep for to serve a duche ship which the said I ware had
bought there. Item the said R. A. says that if the said W. ware. were
councellyng to the ryggyng or vitalyng of the said ship in to france than the
same ship must apperteyn to the same willm^ for at that seson it was open
war between the frenshe king and the king of romans. And no person of
the Iuridi^ion of the same king of Romans auentured hemself in to france.
Beseching this full honorable and excellent court. that ye persons for
witness before named may becallyd by auctorite of the same court and of the
articles before said duly examyned and thereupon according to truth and good
concience to proceed in Judgment for the love of god and in ye way of charity.

H. G. contrary to there oaths. and to the Lybar^yes of the Cite supposing be
the same wrytt that your said Suppliaunt should owe unto them mare. Where in
truth he owyth thereof no penny. And where your said suppliaunt had ordained
appointed and determined him self to be at lymster to bye w^lles and other
fellis for his occupacion there to do in the said Mydsomer term which is the
seesenable time thereof. Your said Supplyaunt by force of the said writ was
arrestyd and must find suertee to keep his apparaunce in the said commen
place. At such time as he should be at the said market. Wherefore he^
entredyd the said Bridge Masters of Respyte in the matter till he might come
home ageyn.

How be it notwythstondyng many reasonable offirs to them made in that behalue
he might not be easyd. till he had leyde down in pledge for the said mark
in accion Crowns of gold in too the handis of Herry A. To keep as in mean

miche at last they named and chose H.W. to examyn and find ye truth of the
said matter whereto your said besecher was well agreeable and so he laboreth
continually to the said H. W. for his end in this behalue. but the said
brigmastirs referred all there matters to the said Samwell. yt which Samwell upon
examinacio^ made by the said. H.W. was so fer from reason and troth in that
bihalue that the said H.W. would noo^ end make i^ that behalf So that your
said besecher can in no wise hitherto have delyueraunce of the said crowns of
gold out of the hands of ye said H.A. Plese it therefore your god lordship and
discrete wisdoms considering that your said besecher was wro^ged to besued at
co^me^ law in ye names of the said bridgmastirs where he has be^ and is
alwey forth coming within the cite redi to answer to all accions that ca^ be

H.A. to deliver him again the said Crowns of gold and what soever accion that
the said brydgmastirs or ye said Samwell will ley against your said besecher by
the law and custume of the cite or any other direccon that ca^ be had for there
deman^de before your said besecher shall be redi to answer and obey at all

gouernyng the universal clargie of crystendom thou may never avoid from the
trial of truth and the right pathe of goodly arkis as in a manner a god i^
earth and the sacred brethe of christ. we notifye unto the. that oon which is
callid ge^gemyon of the great Turks Sons the which turks now late the dyuine
bur^^nes for his ineffable Justice has taken to his grace where that the said
Ge^gemy as in the last year past happened to com from Cicilia too rhodis how be
it the great mastir off the rhodis and religyon had yeuen be hem before time the
faith of suertee and sauf conduyt. nevertheless against the promise and feith
yeuen the said ge^gemi was taken and to prison mancipate against all office of
humanite and against all right. how be it of times without no^bre it has been
desired that he might be restored unto his furst libartee but that might not be
opteyned Form as might as the forsaid mastir of ye rhodis Did send the said
ge^gemy unto the ferther placys and kingdoms to be kept

Wherefore when the mother and the children of this gengemy be vnd our power
both night and day in our presence for his mysse fortue they weep and wail
and never cease desiri^g to see and enbrace him they deman^de of us with
instant priers that we should treat with thy holiness for his delyberacion
for as much as the foresaid mastir of ye rhodes and a another gretter than he i^

Just and perpetual name of goodness to compelle ye forsayde master to restore
the said gege^^^y to his lybartee so wronfully with holden and deliver him
from so wranfulseruytude Also this deed so declyned from all equity and honest

for the most high god shall we call them that have no feyth they with a bek on
thing will afferme. and the same streit will deny. and that they with other
promise at one time at another time vnfeythfully they will* deney. We must
take heed most holy fader lest when we would be calelyd feythfull that we
lack feyth the which or promysse as well ought to be kept to an enemy or an
Iniust or cruel man. Cert^s if we should break our promise we were not better
than vnfeythful men. But much more dete stable thy Hool^nes knows yt many
devout placys off thy feyth ben ender our commandment as Ih^rm and bedlem

pylgrimagis sawtes ne wrong^ we suf^y^ not to be done but we will yt they
have free coming and going for will not suffer our intemer at and i^violat feyth

O tho most noble bishop it belongs to thy dewte of dignite and thy christian
feith in ye which worthily thou hold the primacie to have remembrance and
cure of thy most clerest name and glory for thou art ye clear light of thy
feyth ^ ye serten of ye christian relygion for thou suffrest no sacrelege of thy

much as this thing is greatly inprea^^d in our heart a lightly all thingis may
not be sent in writting we have put ye charge hereof unto our o^ato^ and

The (...) of the messenger to the pope.
BEariss^ime. Most blessed fader primate and chefedome of Christian men. whom
almighty god by his Ineffable ^uruinnes to the moderacion of rightwysnes. and
to the Rule of good life in earth to be kept has creat and erecte god the
yeuar of all goodness gran^te the prosperau^ce and happy encreses. when my noble
prince the Soudan of babilone had decerned to send me his orator to france
and to Naples he commaundyd me in oni wise in this my iournay that I should
present my self before thyn holiness how be it he has not sent opinly common
orotour and presentis off pleasure as it longyth to thy pontifical dignyte. and
as his great and Inward love toward thyn holiness askyth. for that had he
done if the great Turk with whom my lord has battle and great Enmyte.
should not suppose that the Sondane send an orator or a messanger unto the
grettest bishop of Cristendome for to ask help of him. when that my lord by
him self is able nor only to ^ut done the Malice off the Turk but also to
avenge the Injury as it has been often time seen that has been done to him
Serteynly ye cause chief Hostylyte and Enmyte yt is between my lord the
Soudane and the great turk be namly ij. the which my lord has commau^dyd
the too show to thyn hyghn^s (...) cause as breueli as we may we shall show
thyn hyghnes So it is that while this Turks fader a little before his death
sent a messanger unto the soudane bostyng him self that he had subduwed the
one half of cristendome and showed that he would provide to subdewe the other
half to his Empire wherefore he prayed the Soudane that he oon his part should
destroy the holy land and yt he should prohibyte the passage from all christian
pilgrims promising him se^f feythfully to pay.xxx.M. ducatis yerly to ye
Soudane ye which sum the soudane Ressayueth yerly for tribut of christian men
more over there be above CCM. of men and wymen cristened to whom we mynyster
justice and show our self more favorably to them than we do^ to our other
subgettis people of moris. for in no manner wise he will goo from the
ordenaunce and law stabled by which his great for fadir had ordained and
commanded wha^ the Turk had hard this answer-he dismayed grtly hereof and
ma^e h^^ ready anon with a great army of knights ready to distroy ihr^m. When the
souda^ understood his malice he caused the holy land to be better repared and
more suerly kept for ye more displesur of the turk the which deed the turk
took so grievously in so miche yt wha^ he should dey he co^maundyd his son yt he
should distroye b^ strengeth and mighty power the ho^^ land and make it
desolate.

The second of ^^^^^^yte is this. for when that the Turk had beseged the
Rodes by land and by water. he it oppressyd wy^h a great navy of ships In
this time the Soudane sent to the great master of ye Rodes confortyng him
offering him self to give him aid and help yff he had need of men or money to
defend him against the Turk. The which the turk greuoysly took to h^s her^
wherefore he said why should the Soudane be so ready to give aid or socour to
Christian men I swear by machmetehe shall for ever suffer the Indignacion of my
Sons Than O holy fader these ben the ij. causes grettest that be off Enmyte
between the Soudane and the Turk. Furthermore my most excellent prince
commanded me in his name Incessauntly to pray thyn holiness that thou wylt
vouthsaf to entretee with the great master of the rodes with whoom the one of
the great turk Sons called gengemy the which under color of feyth and
sauf-conduite is wrongfully taken. And wytholden. May be (...) unto his first
lybarte. for which his mother and his children be there own free will has
put them self in to our ward. and so the be Reda^^e under the pour of the
soudane. And they never cease of preyers and teeris humbly to beseech his
hyghnes too procure the delyueraunce of the said gengemy the which he has
granted hem to procure and with all his power it to do S^^rely hi^ holiness in
this behalf might show full great kyndnes unto the said soudan as I shall more
largely show unto the. When it shall the to assign the time day and place
whereby al christian men that will visyt the holy land shall have more favor as it
shall be opynly known

The cra^t of grffyng and plantinge of trees and altering of frutis as well in
colors as in taste.
TO graf fruit that shall have no Core. Take a gra^f and bow it in both en^ded
combyng and ^yt both end^s graf wise and So fasten them in the stoke. And if
it grow so with the tree. kyt away the great end and let the smaller end
grow and his fruit shall have no core.

If thou will make apl^s redd take a graf of an apyll tree and graf it in a
stoke of elm or aller and it shall bear read aplys.

Item another for the same bore an hole in an ap^l tree to the ^ithe and tempir
in wa^er what color tho^ wylt and then put it in the hole and stop it with a
pynne and ye appil shall be of ye same color yt then puttist into the tree.

It is to be noted that every tree yt is planeyd and set on saint lambertes
day in to the earth shall not perish but prove and come to prof^ght

If thou will have a pere tree fulle of fruit or ellis as much as it has been
wo^te to bear before. Tempyr S^amony with water and putt it in to an hole that
is percyd to the pi^he of the tree. and stop the hole with a prune of the same
tree or off an other and it shall bear as it was wont or much more.

If thou will have ye fruit to smell like spyces of rygh other as musk bawme or
other spycis. Make on hole in like wise in the tree and stop it again and the
fruit shall smelle and s^u^our aftere the spycis that thou put in to the
tree.

If an old tree begin to wa^e dry. In this wise quytchen him again. See
that the earth that is about the ro^ns be done away and cleue two or iij of
the grettest roetis with an Axe and put a wedge off tree in to the cliuing
and hele the rotis ageyn with the same earth.

Another for the same perte ye tree thorugh with a percer Cross wise or with a
wymble and ye strengeth of the tree shall begin to wax yo^ge.

If thou will have a fruit tree that is ^our. to be made to be sweet fruit
delf the tree round about. And donge the rootis with pyggis donge and so the
fruit shall be made sweet.

Item another for the same make an hole in the sour tree with a percer to the
pyth and in to the hole put water tempred with honey and stop the hole again
with a pynne of the same tree

If thou wylt plant an Almaunde tree or a walsh not tree or a Chery tree or a
peche tree. put the kyrnels of which thou wylt in water in days and than
put many kyrnels to gyder in the earth or seuerelly and and when the spring
is grown out and has stand so an hole year. than take him out of the
gr^unde and set them where thou wylt And it is to be noted that every tree
the branches must be cut in setting time sauf the peche tree which must
have his dry branches kit only

if the peche tree begin to drunk let him be well moysted at the rote with
drestes of wine and the same monstyng shall keep him from shedyng of his fruit.
and some seyn^ that and the roetes be moysted with water of the decokcien of
benes. it shall quyk the tree greatly and if he cast his fruit or they be ripe.
make holes with a wym^yl in the roetes and make pin^ys of w^lowe and smite them
fast in. and ye fruit shall abide on fast Enough.

If an appyl tree begin to rote^ or if the aplus begin to wex rusty. than
ye bark of him is syke. tha^ kyt it with a knyf and late it be opened and when
the humor thereof is some what flowen out. Let donge him well and stop
dilygently his wound with klep.

The quence tree all the time that he is abill to be tranlatyd. he would be
remeued every iiij year and that shall make him bear great plente of fruit
afterward.

The chery tree loves cold eyer and moist ground. but sum Chery trees ben
full lykyng in hylly places the best setting of chery tres is in ye month of
Nouembre and if need be in the end of Ianiuer. And if a chery tree Root in
any wise make an hole with a great persour under that roteh. that the water
that causes the rottynge may have issue out and it is to suppose this medecin
is good for all manner of tres that begin to rotte.

Also it good for all manner of trees than when a bough is kyt away yt the place
that is cut by heled and covered with clay or some other defensable plaster
for defense of the regne that it make not the tree to rotte*

The plantyng of prunes. in cold and moist placis is best in ^euer^ll and
March. and the stones must be set a hand breed in the earth and when
they have stand so an hole year take up the springis of the^ and set them
depper in the ground. and the stones must lie in water iij. days or they be
set.

The medlar will bear well if he be plantyd. but graf him in a white thorn
called an hawthorne. and they myll bear the more plentuos^y

If thou will have many rooses in arberer. thou must take the hard pepyns of
the same rooses that be right ripe and sow hem in ye earth in seuerell or in
march. And when they spring dew them with water and after the space of a year
thou must Translate them departed further from other. In what od place. thou will

If thou will that (...) bear whit grapes. and on the other side read puruey
that a wh^^ vine and a read be set nigh to gyder. And when they be Rotted
mesur of each both ly^y much. And of ey^her pa^e away half endlang unto the
p^th and Join hem to gyder and bynd the^ so yt either sap mete without

shel bear both read grapes and white not with stondig the oon roete be don a wey
and also then may do with two pere trees or ij. appull tree braunces.

If thu will have grapis grow on A plointeree or on A Cherytree Set a vine
under oon of these trees which thou will and when the vine begins to grow
bore that odir tree thorough with an Awgne according to gretnysse of the vine tha^
draw the thorugh the tree an pare A wey the vppar Rynde of ye same vine as fer
as shall be in the hold and so s^ff^r it grow and when both be Joined to gedir
Cut A wey the roete end of the vine by the tree and Sowde the place weel of
the cuttinge and drawing of ye vine thorugh the hold and the kyttyng A wey of
the Rote of the vine must be don in march and Some men will Say it must be done
or the knottis begin to burgeon. yt for the streit drauing the burgeons be
not huet and tho^ may do ye same with diverse trees and diverse frutis and make
oon tree to bear diverse frutis of diverse colores

Item it is to wet that A vine be i^ good earth. and Sprede it Selff of mykel
in many scourges it is good to kyt hem of with a knyff and if it lache yet over
much delue the stock a boute and fille ye ^it full of grauel of a flode meddled
with ashes Also Some men in to the pit a good qua^t^tee of small stones and Say
that it is good therefore.

Item it is te wet than wan ye moan is in tauro it is good time to pla^te trees
of greynes and pepins and when she is in ca^kro Leone or Libra it is good wurch
in trees that bethe new sprongen. And when the moon is in vrgine it is good
time to sow all manner thingis. And from ye Mids of septembre in to the
mids of Decembre is opene time off plantynge. and right ^oo from the mids
of Ianiuer to the Mids of march but yet in these times it is good to these
when the moon ^^ vi.vij.viij or ix. days before the fall Moan. Also after ye
full Moan wha^ she is xxixxij xxiijxxiiij or xxv. days old for in these
quarters of the Moon is most temperat.

Item every plantyng it is to dyspose it so that the son beams mow come to
the rote or to the earth from the our of terce unto noon. and tha^ ben they
plantyd in the best manner And that thoo trees that be beryng and of great
height that party that stood toward the north he be set ageynste the north
wind. and the north west wind. For the heyghts north wind. and the north
weeste wind have kind to kiele and dry too much trees that be new set for
her unmeasurable gretnesse. ye earth must be ordained so that it be neither
too fat ne to grauelly but proporcionably.

All manner pepius cornellis and and greynes must be set in ye earth in depnes
of iiij. or v. fingers bread Do that each be from odur half a foot. Alwey
keeping this special rule that ye end or greyne of the pepin that stood next
the Roere be northest i^ the settinge and that other end upward. toward heuyn
Tha^ tho^ most moist the^ twyes or thries i^ the day not yeting but dewyng or
springling. this is a preuitee. Among cunnyng men that in vere is most
co^uenable time for seedis greynes and pepius and in autumpne of springis and
plants

When thou will take a setlyng yt spryngeth out of a another trees Roete make a
delf there about aftir qua^tite thereof and so deep ^^l thou com to the great
rote that the spring growt out of than thou most cut it holding the edge of the
knyf toward the tree ground. and kirt it so with a slope draught. and leave as
much of the earth a boute the root and stok of the setlynge as thou may and
Set it in a good ground ordained therefore and in aconuenye^t time as is be
foresaid and so if any spry^g that growt out of any tree ^hese it that growith
right out that be not ouir long but euin with out any small branches holdyng ye
knyf in the cuttynge alwey toward the tree, as is above said.

If thou will remeue a tree that is great or beryng fruit Chese thee a full moon
from the middis of Octobre to the middis of decembre hauy^g up the roens as
hole as thou best may leuyng as myche of his own earth a boute the roetis as
thou may with the same Manner and ordur as thou do with setly^g o^ small
trees and setlyng it is no fors though the moon be not even in the fulle so
she be in the.ij. or iij. quartir the gouernaile of these plantis is dowblyng
of beryng of fruit

If thou will keep late set plantis keep hem from from ^espertyn (...) and from
wyndis nameli in heruest for it is not so great defe^ula in vere. against the
coming of winter sent or steke a boute the setlyng many bows that ye northern
wind of g^etnes of odur wy^dis distro^^t not. do donge medlide with straw
about the stoke toward the roete of a good thiknes that frost and snow
cougeile not on the roete and make a deep valey a boute the roete the Space of
vi. or vij foot that ye water abide not and freese a boute ye roete in harvest
that is between Somer and wy^ter that when wy^ter comes it may be fillid with
donge and so late it stand all the winter and in vere put under the dong new
earth and cut alwey all the vnpr^fitable branches and make it clean a boute
the stok and the roetis from worms s^u^fus. And mosses and evil wyndis goy^g
about the branches all the closse of thy^ orcharde would be set a bout with
other high trees that bear no fruit that the flours might be keep Sauf from
wyndis And be ware that no fruit begadired of no tree before the time for
that is right a great and a privy harmyng to the tree.

The manner of graffing.
The graff stoke must be chosen in a good ground and it must be smothe and
even and cut it without the Earth the lengith of a foot or more if it be as
great as thy thombe or more if it be gret^ and se that the cuttyng be euin over
thwarte the stok and a syden and it must be cloven above in the middis of the
pithe the lengith of i^. finger bread and in the clyfte Set thy graf which must
be choseen of ye best tree the stok is of Chese ye graf yt sto^dith right up
toward he^uy^ that has a knot of the forneyere and an ynche benethe ye said
knott kytte thy graf and thwyte it on both sides euy^ i^ manner of a wedge as
fere as it shall goo into the clyfte of the stokke it must be so even thwete^
that the eyer may not com between the clyfte and the graf and tha^ close it
with good temperat earth a boute ye greffe for defens of rain and wedur.

If thou will greff diverse frutis upon ^e^ stok that has as many brau^chis as
thou will have graffes on and in every branch set a graf in manner and form
as said before and evermore chese thy graf on the son ye side of the tree that
berith it and next the top if tho^ may and tho^ may gref diverse frutis in
oon clyfte but non of them may be thykkar than odur as thy reason will tell
thee in ye workyng

To have fruit without cores look thou have a sufficient graff stok and do
therewith as I. said before. Chese a graf of a good merle tree and cut it on
this manner that the end of the graff that was upward next the firmament must
bethweten like the neder of a common graffe and the nedur end turned upward it
is too be don sleely this rule is true in all trees that have stones and
kyrnels but a vine it behouith too cut yt is downwarde next the Earth with
great cunyng and slight

If tho^ will have a vine grow on a chery tree and have ye taste of cherys
Set a vine by a cherytree till it grow and in ye begyny^g of feuell when
tymeys make an hole thorough ye cherytree in wat heiggt thou will and as often
as tho^ will and draw thorugh the ye hole a branch of ye vine so yt it fille
the hole

And shave awey the old bark off the vine as myche as shall be in the hoole and
shave it in so that the shaven place of the brau^che stopp full ye hole of the
chiritree. and than cut away the Roete end of the vine. and wrapp it well about
with good earth and bind it well with lynne^ clothe and keep it well in all
thing as is said modur graffyng but some men late the roete end of the vine be
vncutt a year til it be Sowded with the chiritee and than cut it a way and yt
is a good manner and asure and so it may be do with diverse trees off diverse
frut^ and the grape and the vine shall have savor of hem. and so of every
tree may be grraffid in other and it is a marvelous graffy^g If thou will have
a tree bear d^u^s frutis and of diverse colors and diverse sauaure. In the furst
year graf in diverse branches of a cheritree diverse aples to thy lykyng and
leave so^ of the branches vngraffed the ij. year make holes through the
chirytree and draw thorught yt hole a vine branches the utter rind shaue^
off as is be foresaid and i^ the same manner through another hole. a red rosar
and do there with as is beforsaid off the vine and this diuersitee thou may do
aftir thyn own lykyng

If thou will have fruit of diverse colors thou shall make an hole in atree up
the roete even to the pithe of the tree and a non do in ye hole good asure of
almayne so that it be ny full and stop the hole well and just with a short
pynne and wrapp it well with tempred earth and bind it well as thou do agraff
and the fruit shall be blew color and this may be do with all colors

BE it right or wrong. these me^ among. on women do complain
Affermyng this. how that it is. a labor spent in vain
To love the^ well. for never a dele. they love a man again
For let a man do. what he can. there fouour to attain
Yet if a new. to them pursue. there furst true lover than
Labors for naught. and from her though. he is a bannisshed man
I Say not nay. bat that all day. it is both writ and said
That woman's faith. is as who says. all utterly decayed
But ne^^theles. right good witness. i^ this case might be lay
That they love true. and co^tynew. record ye N^tbroone maid de
Which from her love. wha^ her to prove. he came to make his mo^e
Would not depart. for in her heart. she louyd but him allone
THan between us. let us discuss. what was all the manner.
Between them too. we will also. tell all they pain in fere
That she was in. now I begin. so tharye me answer.
Wherefore ye. that present be. I pray you give an ear
I am the knight. I cum be night. as secret as I can
Sayng alas. thus slondyth the cause. I am a bannisshed man
ANd I your will. for to fulfylle. in this will not refuse
Trusting to show. in wordis few. yt men have ami^^e use
The Other own shame wyme^. to blame. and causeles the^ accuse.
Therefore to you. I answer now. all wymen to excuse.
^yn own heart dear. with you what chiere. I prey you tell a noon
For in my mind. of all mankind I love but you allon
iT sto^dith so. a deed is do. wherefore much harm shall grow
My desteny. is for to dey. a shamful death I trow
Or ellis to flee. the ton must be. none other wey I know.
But to with draw. as an outlaw. and take me to my (...)
Wherefore ^ dew* my own her ttrewe none other r^d I can
For I must to the grene wode goo alone a bannysshed man
O Lord what is this world is bliss that changes as ye move
My summers day. i^ lusty may. is derked before the none
I here you say farwell nay. nay. we depart not so sone
Why say ye so. wheder will ye goo. alas what have ye done
All my welfare. to sorrow and care. should change if ye were gone.
For in mind. of all mankind. I love but you alone.
I Can believe. it shall you grieve. and shomwhat you distrayne
But aft^rwarde your pains hard with in a day or tweyne
Shall sone a slake* and ye shall take* confort to you again.
Why should ye naught for to make thought your labur were in vain
And thus I do. and pray you ^oo. as hertely as I can.
For I mulle too yt grene wode goo. alone abanysshed man.
NOw sith that ye have showed to me ye secret of your mind
I shall be plain to you again like as y^ shall ^^ne find
Sith it is so. that ye will goo. I wol not leave ^ehu^^de
Shall never be said. the Nutbrowne maid. (...) to her love unkind
Make you ready. for so am I. all though it were anoon
For in my mind of all man kind. I love but you a lone
yEt I you read. take good head when men will think and sey
Of young and old. it shall be told. that ye be gone away
Your wanton will. for to fulfylle. In grene wood you to play
And that ye might. from your delight. no longer make delay.
Rather than ye. should thus for me. be called an ylle woman
Yet would I to. the grenewodde goo. alone abanyshed man
THough it be song. of old and young. that I should be to blame
Theirs be the charge. yt speak so large in hurting of my name.
For I will prove. that feythful love. it is denoyd of shame
In your distress. and heaviness. to part with you the same
And sure all thoo. that do not so. true lovers ar they noon
But in my mind of all man kind. I love but you alone
i Council you. remember how. it is no maidens lawe^
Nothing to dought. but to re^ne out. to wod with an out law.
For ye must there. In your hand bear. a bow to bear and draw
And as a thief. thus must ye lyeue. ever in deed and awe
By which to you. great harm might grow. yet had I lever than
That I had too. the grenewod goo. Alone a banysshyd man
i Think not nay. but as ye say. it is no maidens lore.
but love may make. me for your sake. as ye have said before
To com on foot. to hu^te and shote to get us mete and store
For so that I. your company may have I as^e no more
From which to part. it makith mine heart. as cold as any ston.
For in my mind. of all man kind. I love but you alone.
FOr an out law this is the law. that men him take and bind
Without pytee. hanged to be. and waver with the wind.
If I had need. as god forbid. what rescous could ye find
For sothe I trow you. and your bow. shul draw for fere be kind
And no merueyle. for little avail. were in your council than
wherefore I too. the wood will goo. alone a banysshd man.
fVl well know ye. that wyme^ be. full febyl for to fiyght
No womanhed. is it in deed. to be bold as a knight
Yet in such fere. if that ye were. among enemies day and night
I would wythstonde. with bow in hand* to grieve them as I might.
And you to save. as wymen have. from death many o^e
For in my mind. of all man kind. I love but you alone
yEt take good head. for ever. I dread. that ye could not sustein
The thorney ways. yt deep valeis. the snow ye frost ye reyn
The cold the hete. for dry or wete. we must lodge on the plain
And us a bow. noon other roue. but a brake bussh or twain
Which sone should grieve. you I believe. and ye would gladly than
That I had too. the grenewode goo. alone a banysshyd man
Sith I have here* ben partynere. with you of Joy and bliss
I must also. part of your woo. endure as reason is yet am I sure. of oo

Loo mine heart sweet. this ylle diet. should make you pale and wan
Wherefore I to the wood will goo. alone a banysshid man
Among the wild dear such an archier. as me^ say yt ye be
Ne may not fail. of good vitayle. where is so great ple^^e
And watir clear. of the cyuere shall be full sweet to me
With which in hele. I shall rig it well. endure as ye shall see.
And er we goo abed or two I can provide a noon.
For in my mind. of all man kind. I love but you alone
LOo yet before ye must do more of ye will goo with me
As ^^tte you there. up by your ere. your kirtel by ye knee
With bow in hand. for to with ^o^de. your enmys if need be
And this same night. before day light. to wood ward will I flee.
And ye will all th^s fulfylle do it shortly as ye can
Ellis wi^ I to the grenewode goo. alone a banysshyd man
I Shall as now. do more for you. yt lo^geth to womanhod
To short my here. a bow to bear. to shote in time of need.

All this make ye. now let us flee. the day cum fast upon
For in my mind. of all man kind. I love but you alone.
Day nay not so. ye shall not goo. and I shall tell you why.
Your appetyte. is to be light. of love I well aspie
For right as ye. have said to me. in like wise hardely
Ye would answer. who so ever it were. in way of company.
It is said of old. sone hot sone cold. and so is a moman
wherefore I too. the wood will goo. alone a banysshid man.
yEt ye take heed. yet is no need. such wordis to say be
For often ye preyd. and long assayed. or I you lomd perd.
And though that I of auncestry. a barons daughter be
yet have you proved. how I you loved asquyer of low degree
And ever shall. what so befalle. to dey therefore a noon

A Barons child. to be begyled. it were a curssed deed
To befelow. with an out law. almighty god forbid

Be not dismayed. what soever I said. to you when I began
I will not too. the grene wod go^. I am no banysshyd man
These tidingis be. more glad to me. than to be made a queen.
if I were sure. they should endure. but it is often seen.
When men will break. promise they speak. the wordis on the spleen.
Ye shape some wyle me to begyle. and stele fro me I wene
Then were the case* wurs than it was. and I more* woo begone
For in my mind. of al mankind. I love but you alone.

You god defende^. since you destende. of so great a lynage
Now understand. to westmerlande. which is my heritage.
I will you bring. and with a ring. be wey of marriage
I will you take. and lady make. as shortly as I can
Thus have ye wone. an ^rles son. and not a banysshyd man
hEre may ye see. that wymen be. in love meke kind and stable
Late never man. repreue them than. or call them variable
But rather prey. god that we may. to them be confortable
Which sometime prouyth. such as loves. if they be charitable.
For since men would. that wymen should. be meke to them each on
Much more ought they to god obey. and serve but him alone

The office that belongithe to a bishop or to a pristes
IT is to be noted that the office of a bishop or a priste is i^ v manners. The
first is truly to preche cristis gospel. The second is to prey god
contynually for his chirch. The thread is the sacrame^tis freely to make and
bear to whom it behouythe. The iiij. is only to study in holy scripture The v.
is to preue and give ensample of perfeccyon u^too other liuars and weyfaringme^

Isodorus tercis Priestis shulu^ be dampened For the wykidnes of the people if
they ne teache and learn yt ignorauot and vncunyng.

refusen to be taught

Aplus ignorant shall be ignorant to mow excuse he another ignorant from pain.

Augustius who will not for shame a short time suffir lore and learn i^ al time
in shame and un witty shall he abide. No man for ignorance shall be excused.

Grisous every man cum he to good conversation

Alpus Bethon a feithfull ensample in word co^uersacio^ Charity. feithe and

Aplus a priest ought to be power as to aueryce or couetise freely with voice be
he chastised also a priest ought too be sighyng and wailynge his own sin and
other me^nys A priest ought to be hungry and thirsty A priest ought to be sweet
and sotte more rather to foryeue than to vengy. A priest ought to be merciful
to another Also he ought too be clean off heart and not only to medil him self
a bought wordly bisynes another to think on the world Also him ought to be
ready to desiro^s passioun and not with vain glory.

Zerous the office of a priest diewli to answer him that a rich the law off

otherwise he can not the law of the lord he reproves and vndnymeth himself
to be no priest of his lord.

Most reverend and mine especial good lord
as humbly as I can or may I beseech your grace to have me your true and
feythfull serua^te as recommend^ and that it may please your good lordship to
understand that very necessyte has causes me to writ this Lettre unto your
grace for as much as I know my self so ferdful for defaute of coming. And by
cause I know my self unworthy to have any word is in your presence that though
I have never so good matter I neither dare nor can show it. Wherefore I beseech
your grace to read thise lettre whereby your grace shall understand the very
troth of the matter between me and master foster, yet hanging in Judgment
before your grace to mine Intolerable cost and charge. Unless that by your
grace it be hastily remedyed And if any thing in this lettre be untrue I am
content that your grace give unto me therefore perpetuell prison. First I
delyuerd my clothes engrened to master foster to deliver over to my creditours
at xv l. a yard as apperith by the deposicion of robert Odyam for the part of
master foster where he says yt he saw in master fosters house a lettre of my
hand wherein was contained that he should so delyuere them. And the said foster
sold iij. scarlettes without any assent or will under the prise off vi l. a
yard whereupon my feith they cost me of on John^ peyco^ of cogsale that will
depose the same I do^g it no^ viij s^ every yard white. And I might have had
for the greyne that every yard was grayued with v. l. and the fuller sherman
and the dier had for every yard for there labor xij d. And so they cost me
every yard xiiij s^. in ready money. And master foster will allow but lityl
above v s^ for a yard to mine utter undoing onles that your will according to
good conscience be mine help* and socoure And therefore I humbly I beseech
your grace as I am and ever have been your true servant to my power that ye
suffer me not by the untrue dealing of the said foster to be thus undone.
and as I ever have been ye shall find me your true and feythful servant And
Ihesus keep your grace in prosperity amen

The laws and believe of the Sarasyns.
MAunduyle wryttyth in his book of pilgrimage and travail* of the laws and
believe of the sarasyns After her book that they callen Alcarom and so^me
callend that book Mesaap. So^me of hem be of diverse langage and of diverse
countries* the which book machemet made and gave hem In the which he wrote
among other thingis as I John^ Mande^^^e have often red and seyn. The^ that been good shall goon to perradyse and tho that been evil to hell. and that
trowen all the sarasyns. And if a man ask hem what paradyse beemeneth. they
sayn it is a place of delytis. where a man shall find all manner delytis and
all manner of frutis in all times. and the ^yuer rennyng milk wyn ^ed honey and
fresh water* and they shall have fair houses after that they have deserved ^.
the houses ben made of precious stones of gold and silver and each man shall
have x. wynes and all maids and also they speken and nowen on the virgin mary.
and also of the incarnacion of our lord Ihesu Christ. and how that mary was
lernyd off the angel and that gabryel said to her. that she was chosen beforne
al other fro the begyn^yng of the world. and that witness there book yt told
of her and of the Incarnacion of Ihesu Christ. and that she conceived and bare
child. and yet she was maid. and they said that thu^ christ spac as soon as
he was borne. And he was very god and very prophere. in word and deed meke and
right wis to all with on^^n any vice and they said when the angel cold her of
the i^carnacio^ she had (...) dread she was young and there was (...) that delyd
myche with so^^^y and men callid (...) that with enchauntement ^owde make him
like an angel and he read often and lay be maidens and therefore was our lady
aferd of him for she wend ^haungell had been (...) that went So to mayde^s and
therefore was our lady ferd of hi^ and she (...) him and bad hy^ (...) were
(...) and the angel (...) for he was verry angel and messanger of our lord
(...) criste? And also her book (...) that she had child under (...) and than
was she shamed and wept and (...) she would bendede and ye child (...) her
and said

Nerimeas maria.
That is to say a dread the not mari. and mother in my pla^^s the book sath ^e
spak as soon as he was borne. and the book sa^k that he was sent from our lord
almighty too ye (...) example to all men. and yt god shall deem all good to
heuyn and all evil to hell. and that crist is ye best profight and next to
god and that he was verry prophet and yaf sight to blind and helid me sels and
raised de men and steied all quyk to he^^ and if they may find a book of
gospels and namly of ye gospel

Missus est angelus gabriell
They don great wurship thereto and they fasten vij. months in the year and they
ete^ naught but on nyghtes and then they kepen hem from there wives and that
they ben like they be not co^stryned to that fast and the book spekith often
Jews and says yt they be^ wyked folk for they trow not that ihu^ crist is
oon with good. and they seyn that Iuwes lye^ o^ our lady and on her son ihu^
crist when ye seyne that they dedyn him not on ye cross. and for Sar^ens
trowen so myche our feith they be lightly to co^uere when men p^chen to hem
the ^awe of crist and they sey^ that they we ten well that the law of machemet
shall faylen as does the law of the Jaws and that cristes law shall last in
to the wordis end and if a man ask hem wheryn they trowen yt say^ in god
almaghty maker off heuyn and of earth and off all other things and wythouten
him is nothing done. and at the day of doine all thing shall be rewarid after her
deseruyng and all thing is sothe yt crist said by the mouths of prophetis and
alsoo macheme^ bad in his alcoron that each man should have.ij. wives or.iij.
and now they taken x. or xij. or a^ many lemma^s as they may geten and if any
of her wives doo^ a miss to her husbondis they may driven he^ a way and take
another but he must yeui^ hem of his goodis

Also when men speak of the fader sone and holy ghost. they say that they arne
iij. persons and not one god but they scorne^ it and speak naught there of but
of the trinite. but they sayn yt god spak or ellis he was dom^. and god is a
ghost or he were on live. And they sayn that goddis word has great strenthe.
And so seyne they in scorn. and they seyn that abraham and Machemet weren well
with god for they spaken with him and machemet they seyn was the right messenger
of god. and they have many good articles of our feyth and all they
vndirstondin ye Scripture and the prophetis for they have them written in the
gospels and in the by bill in her langage and so they know much of holy
writ. But they understand it not but after the letter of the gospel and
therefore says saint poule.

Litera occidit spu^s au^t vinificat.

That is to sayn the letter sleithe and the ghost quykeuth. and the Sarasyns
said that Iuwes kepen not ye law that moses took hem. and al so christian men
done evil for they kepen naught the x. commaundementis of the gospel that
ihesu crist said to hem and therefore I shall tell you what the soud an told me
on a day in his chamber. He let void out of his chamber lordis and all other
that were therein for he would speak with me in council. And he asked me how
christian men governed the^ and I said right well blessed be god. and he said
sekirly nay for he said that our priestis said naught her seruyse as they
shulden do. nor yeuen not e^ample of good lyuinge to the people. and the folk
that shulden on the haliday seruen her god. they goo^ to the tavern and lain
there in gloteny all they day and all the night. and cryn and drinken as beestis
that we^en not when they have Enough and also he said that christian men enforced
hem to fyghte^ to gyder and each one too begyle other and they be so proud
that they wo^ not how they may ^^o them, ^e how long ne how short but now
long now short. now short now wide in all manner guyses. and said yt they
should be meke semple and ^oth (...) and done alms as crist ded in who^ they
trowen. and they be so cou^tous that for a lytill silver they self her troth
and her children and her susters and her wives. And one takyth another wife and
few holde^ there troth. and therefore he said. for these sins christian men
have lost all the landis that we holden for through sin has god put ^he^s
la^dis in to our handis and not thorou strengh but thorou your sins. But we
woten well for southe. wha^ you seruen well your god that he will help you.
So that no man shall do against you. And that we known well by our
prophecies yt christian men shall win again these landis when they Seruen well
her god but while they lyuen so foul as they don we have no dread of he^ and
than I asked him how he wist so the state of criste^ and he said that he knew
both of lordis and of como^s By his messangers which he sent through all
contreis as they were marchauntis with pricious stones and other marchaundisis
to know the manner of all contreis. and than he clepid i^ the lordis again
and tha^ he showed me the grettest lordis of ye contray and they spoken frensh
right well and the Sowdan also and tha^ I had great marvel of the disclau^dir
of our feith and so these that shu^den be turned to i^^ crist by good example
they ben drawn a wey thorugh our evil living and therefore they seyn soche but
the sarefins ben true for they kepen well the law off alke^on that god sent
hem by his messanger machemet to whom they say^. saint gabriel sp^^ often with
and said him the will of god and this machemet was borne in arabie and he was
furst a knave and kept horsseis and went after marchuntis So he com ones in to
egipte with a merchant and egipte was that time christian. and there was a
chapel be sides Arabie and there wonned and heremyte and when he entered in too
the chapel yt was a litell house and a low. anon it began to were^ as great as
a palace yate and the sarasins sayn yt it was the furst myrakele that machamet
ded in his youth and aftir ward bygan machamet to ben right wys. and he was a
great astromyar and Sithe^ he was keeper off all the gold off the princes of
corydan and governed in full wisly and when the prince was deed he weddid his
wife the lady that me^ clepe^ quadryge and machemet fell often in too the
falling evil wherefore ye lady was wroth for that she had taken him too her
husband. but he made her to believe that ever when he fell so. that gabriel the
angel spoke with him and for the great bryghtnes of the angel he fell down.
this machemet reigned in arabie the year of our lord vi C.xx. and was of the
kynred of Ismael that was a brahm^ is son and he begat him of agare his
chambirer and therefore ye sare^ons ben clepid Ismaelites and Some agarens of
aga^. and Some there be that be^ clepid moabites and So^me amonytis after ij.
Sons of loath and alsoo machemet loved well and holy man that duellid in
wildirnes a mile fro mount synay in the vale as men goon fro arabie to Caldas
and a days Iurney fro the sea when merchants come^ fro venys machamet went
often into that her mytage. And all his men weren wroth and for sothe he would
gladly here the heremet prieche and made his me^ wake^ all night therefore they
would fayn a have had the heremet deed. and so it be fell on a night that
machemet had well dronken wine and fill on sleep and his me^ took out his swerd
off his shethe why^es he lay and sleep and slought there with this heremet and
the^ put it up age^ in the shethe al blody and on the morrow wha^ he found the
heremyt deed. he was wroth and would have slain his men. but they all with
oo^ accord said that he him self had slain him when he was dronken* and
shewid him his swarde all blody and than he trowed that they had said soth and
this is the second miracle yt machamet deed and than he cursed the wine and
all him that dronke^ the wyne^ and there the sarasens yt ben devout drynken
no wine. but some drynken it preuely for and they dronken opinly they should
be^ reprouid but they drynken good be^age and norishi^g that is made of
camamele and thereof is sugar made Also it be fallith sometime christian men become
sara^ens outhir thorugh pouertee or thorugh some wikidnes and therefore ler^th he
his believe when they ressayuen him he says thus.

A Complaynte made to king herry the vi. by the duke of glou^eter upon the
cardynal of wynchesteri
These ben In party the poyntis and articles which. I. vmfrey duke of
glouceter for my troth and aquytal Said late. I. would give In writing my
right doulted lord unto your highness aduertising your exellence of Such things
in party as have been don in your tendir age in derogacio^ of your noble estate
and hurt of both your reames and yet ben don and used daily

Furst ye cardynal thoo being bishop of winchester took upon him ye state of
cardynal which was naied and denayed hy^ by ye king off most noble memory my
lord your fadir who^ god assoyle. Sayng yt he had as lee^ set his Crown
beside him as to see hi^ were a cardynal hatte he being a cardinal

For he knew full well the pride and thambusyon that was in his parsone thoo
being but a biship should have loo greatly extolled him into more intolerable
pride when that he were cardynal. and also him thought it against his fredom off
the chief church of this reame which that he wursshipped as duly as euyrded
prince. yt blessid be his soul. And how be it that my said lord your fadir
whom god assoyle would have agreed him to have had certain darkes off this
land cardynalles have no bysshoprich in England yet his intent was never to
do so great derogacion to ye chirch of Canturbury to make him that were his
suffraganys to sy^t above there ordynary and metropolitan. But the cause was
that in general and in all matters which might concern the well of him and of
his reame he should have promoters of his nacyon as all odur king christian had
in the court of rome and not to a bide in this land any part of his council
as ben all the sp^^al and temperal at parlementis and other great councels when
you list to call he^ and therefore though it list you to^ do hy^ that worship
to set him in your preuy council after your plesur yett in your parliament
where every lord spi^^al and temperal has his place him ought too ocupie but
his place as bishop

Itm^ the said bishop now being cardynal was assoiled of his bishop rich of
wynchester whereupon he sued to our holy fadir too have a bulle declaratorye
that not with stondi^g^^e was assumpte to and state of cardynal that the sea
was not void where in deed it stood void by a certain time or the said b^lle
were granted and so he was exempte from his ordynary by the taking on him the
state of cardynal and the church bisshoprich of wynchester So stondy^g void.
he took a yen off the pope ye not learned thereof ^e knowing whereby he was fall
in the case of prouicyon So that all his good was la^f^lly and clerly forfeyted
to you my right doulted lord with more as the ^^tute declares play^ly for
your auau^tage.

Ite^ it is not unknown to you dou^ted lord how tho^^gh your landis it is
noysed the said cardynal and tha^chbishop of york had and have the governance
of^^ on and all your land the which noon of your true lie^e men ought to
usurp nor take (...) hem And have also e^straunged me your soole uncle my
cosyn off (...) my cosyn of huntyng do^ and many other lordis of your (...). to
have any knowledge of any great matter yt might touch your high estate or either
of your reames and of lordis spu^al. of right. tharchbisshop of canturbury
should be your cheef cou^cellar the which is also enstraunged and set a side.
and so be many other right sad lordis and well advised as well spu^al as temperal
to great hurt of you my right doulted lord and of yur reames like as
thexperye^ce and works she we^ clerly and euyde^tly more harm is

Itm^ in the tendir age off you nay right doulted lord for the necessite of an
armee the said cardynal leave you iiij.M.li upon certain Iuels preysed at xxij
M. mark with a let off sale that and they were not quyttid at a certain day
ye should lose hem The said cardynal seeing your money ready too have quytt with
your Iuels Caused the tresorer of england at that day being to pay that same
money for part of a another armee. i^ defrandyng you my right doulted lord of
your said Iuells keeping he^ yett alwey stille to his own use. too your right
great loss and his singlar (...) and avayle

Item the said Cardynal thoo being bishop of wynchester and chau^celar of
eng^and delivered the king of scottis upon certain appoyntementis as may be
showed and his presumyng be autoryte of parliament were no deed. I have herd
notable men of the law sey that they never herd of yt among hem which was to
great a defamation to your hyghnes and all to wedde his nece to the said king
whom that my lord off notable memory your fadir whom god assoyle would never
have so delivered And there as he should have paid for his cost xl.M li^. the
said cardynal chauncelar of England caused you to pardon him thereof ^.M. mark
where of the gretter so^me he paid you right a litel what I report me to your
highness.

Item where the said cardinal le^t you my redoulted lord great and notable
so^mes he has had and his assignementis upon the port of hampton where the
custumers ben his seruantis where be lyklynes it is too sopose he sto^ding the
chief merchant of wulles of your land that ye be greatly defrauded. and under
that rule what wulles and other marchaundicis have been shippid and may be from
time too time hard is too esteem to great an hurt and priudyce off you my right
douthted lord and of all your pepul

Itm^ how beit that the said cardinal has diverse times le^t you great So^mes
sith ye time off your regue yet his aloene has be so defferred and delaied
that for ye most part the conuenable seson of themploynge of the good lent was
passed.

So that litel fruit or noon com thereof as by experience both your reames
have sufficiently in knowledge.

Item where there was Iuels and place preysed at xi M. ll in weight of ye said
cardynal forfeited to you my right doulted lord he gat him arestorement thereof
for alone of a litel parcel of the same and so defrauded you holly of them to
your great hurt and his a veil the which good might greatly eased your highness
i^spary^g as myche of your power Commons.

Itm^ the cardynal being feoff of my said lord your fadir whom god assoyle
against his enient yaf Elysabethe be^champe.^.iij. mark of lyuelod where that
his will was that and she were weddid with in a year than, to have it and else
not where indede it was ij. or iij year after to your great hurt and aminyshi^g
of your enheritaunce.

Item not with stonding that the said cardynal has no manner of autoryte nor
interesse in to the crown nor noon may have be any possibylitee yet he
presumes and takes upon hyn in party your estate ryalle in cleping before him
in to geet abusion and of all your land and derogacio^ of your highness which
has not ben seen nor used in no days here before in gretter estate than he is
with out your express ordinance and commandment

Item the said cardynall noothi^g considering the necessite of you mi right.
doulted lord has sued a perdon of dysines that he should pay for the church
of wynchester for term of his lyf^e^ing there by occasion. to all other lordis
spn^al to draw there good will for any necessite to grant any dysine and so to
ley all the charge upon the temperaltee and the power people.

Item be the governance and labor of the said cardynall and archbishop off
york there has be lost and dyspendid to notable and too great a good by diverse
ambassa^^s s^n^ out of this reame. Furst to ar^as for a fe^ned colorable peace
where as by ly^^lynes yt was thought and soposed yt hit should never turn to
effectual avail of you my right doulted lord. nor off your said reames but
under color thereof was made the peace of your aduysary. and of the duke of
Bourgoene for ellis your party adverse and the said duke might not goodly have
found means nor we is to have come^ned to geder to have concluded to oder
they consid^racyons. and consperacyous made and wrought there at that time
against your hyghnes. Whereby ye might right doulted lord the gretter p^r^^^ of
your obeysaunce as well my (...) of france as in your duchy off normandy and
much other thing gone greatly as thorough the said colorable tretee, and other
wise since the de^^e of my brother of bedford whom god assoylle.

Item now late was sent a other ensabassade to caleis by the labor and
counsel of the said cardinal and archbishop of york the cause why of the
beginning to me your sele uncle. and other lordis of your kyn and counsel
unknown to your great charge and against the good publyk of your reme as it
openly apereth the which good if it b^n enployd for the defense of your la^dis
the marchaundyses of the same myghte^ have had other course and your s^yd
landis not too have stonden in so great my chief as they do

Item after that to your great charge and hurt of both your reames the said
Cardynal and archbisshop of york went to your said ^owne of cal^is and diverse
lordis off your kynne and of your counsel i^ there felouship and there as there
was natural war betwix the duke of orlyaunce and the duke of bourgoen for
murdur of there faders and a capital enymyte like to have endured for ever. The
said cardynal and archbisshop of york lycenced and suffered ye said duke of
orlyau^ce to entrete and common aparte with the counsel of your said
adversaries as well as with the duches of burgoene by which mean the peace and
alia^ce was made betwix the ij. dukis to the grettest fortefienge of your said

Item that my said lord the chau^celer considiryng in thingis a boue said and
doub^ing yerfor of perillis that might have swed thereof entendyng to puruey
there against and namely to his own surte and def^te according to law of nature
ordeynyd to let that no force of people should come ouir the brigge of london

And as touard the letter sent by my lord of winchester unto my lord of
Bedford of which the tenure here folowith.

Right hight. and mighty prince and my right noble after one leuest lord I
reco^maunde me vntoyone with all my heart and seruise. And as ye desire ye
welfare of ye king our souereigu^ lord and of his realms of england and of
france and your own well And owris also have you hithir for by my troth and
ye tarry we shall put this land in aue^ture with a field such a brothir ye have
here god make him a good man etces Of the which my lord of glouceter
complayneth off the malice and untrue purpose of my said lord of wi^chester of
touarde assembling of the people and gadering of a field in the kyngis land in
troubeling thereof and against the kyngis pease

My said lord of wynchester ansuerith that of his said letters duly vndirstonde

And in wise as he vndirstode ande mean in the writing off hem it may not
resonably be gadrid or taky^ that my said lord of winchestir ente^did to gadir
any feld or assemble people in troublyng of the kyngis lord and against the
kyngis pease but rar their he purposid to acquit hy^ to the king in his troth
and keep the rest and ye pele in the ky^gis land and to eschew rebellion or
disobeysaunce and all troble

For by that. that in the beginny^g of the said letter he callith my said lord
of bedforde his leuyst lord aft our that is the king. Whom him owes to except
of dute of his trou^ch the which he had ever kept and will keep.

Secundly by y^. in the said letty^ he desires the coming home of my said
lord of bedford for the welfare of the king and of his reins of England and
of france which stand principally in his keeping of rest and pease and praeth
my said lord of bedforth to his coming into eygla^d in eshewing the inpartye
of the land and of a field the which he dred hy^ might have followed if he had
long tar^yd.

And as touarde the^ words. and ye tarry we shall put this land in adventure
with afeled such a broti^r ye have etc.

My said lord off wynchester said. The soth is that be fore that he wrote the
Said lettir by occasion of certain ordinance made by the mayr and aldirmen of
london and against the excessis taky^g of masons carpe^ters tylers dawbers and

sewid of purpose and intent of disobeysaunce And rebellion too redressing of
the which it se me t^ ^ my said lord the chau^celer that mi said lord of
glouceter did not the deuoir nor diligence that he might ha showed for lak of
which diligence they that were disposid to do disobeysau^ce were encoragid and
enboldishide so that it was like that they should have made a gaderyng and that
the king and his true subgettis should have be compellid too have made a feled
to have withsto^de hem ye wlnchefelde making had been auenturyng of the land
and in ^okyunyng that it was ne^^r my sand lord chaunceleris intent to gadir
no feld but as troth most stirid him against such as rioutously would make
(...) assemble against our souereign^ lord and the well of this land. he
desirith so hastily the coming of my said lor of bedforde the which he would in
no wise have so gretely desired if he would have purposid hy^ too any unlawful
maky^g of a field for he wist well that my said lord of bedford would most
sharply have chastisid and punyshid all tho that so would any riorouse assemble
make
