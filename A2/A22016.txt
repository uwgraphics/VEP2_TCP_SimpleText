By the King.
WHereas we have sine it pleased God to establish us in the Imperial Crown
of Great Britain, equally regarded the good of both the late Kingdoms of
Scotland and England, now happily united our Royal person in one Monarchy,
ever minding to maintain and continue the good and lowable customs and Laws
whereby each of them has been these many ages so worthily governed:
nevertheless some malicious spirits, enemies to that common tranquillity so
much desired by us (forgetting the many proofs both public and private,
which we have given of that our gracious affection to that our native and
ancient country of North Britain, of the freedom, liberty and privileges
whereof we have at all occasions taken so special a patrociny, as the solemn
assemblies of the Estates of South Britain, and Commissioners from the Estates
of both Kingdoms have been eye witnesses) have not been ashamed to labor to
pervert the minds of our best affected subjects, That whereas the insolent and
factious carriage of some of them has merited most severe animaduersion, they
would insinuate themselves in the commiseration of the multitude, by assuming
unto them a glorious profession of the maintaining of the Privileges and
auctorized discipline, intended by us (as they affirm) to be utterly
overthrown by a sudden and unseasonable laying upon them at this present the
Rites, Ceremonies, and whole Ecclesiastical order established in the Church of
this part of our Kingdom of Britain. And as we have ever carefully regarded
how convenient it is to maintain every Country in that form of government
which is fittest and can best agree with the constitution thereof, and how
dangerous alterations are without good advice and mature deliberation, and that
even in matters of order of the Church, in some small Islands under our
Dominions, we have abstained from suffering any alteration: So doubt we not,
but our good Subjects will never be that credulous contrary to the known
truth, which has ever appeared clearly in all our Actions, as to be in any
doubt, but as in all our proceedings we have been a Patron of Religion and
Justice, (two inseparable conseruers of all Monarchies,) So has all our study
and care ever been to retrench and reform all courses that carried any
prejudice to that integrity whereat we have ever aimed, and as by so many
good Laws set forth in our government, Justice has attained to another
perfection and splendour, then it had in any our predecessors times, and with
painful and unpleasant business, we have in the discipline of the Church
taken away innumerable abuses and corruptions, which it they had not been
remedied, had brought the purity of Religion in extreme danger. Yet we hope
that none dare be so impudent as to affirm that by our Sovereign power, or
absolute commandment we did the same (although we enjoyed our authority as
freely as any King or Monarch of the world) but as the disease of the Civil
body was ever cured by the advice of our three Estates, So the defects of the
Church by the help and counsel of those who had greatest interest in them, So
as the presumpeion of our bygone actions in our administration, whiles we
were present, the proof of our fatherly care toward this part of our Kingdom
since our residence here, may be sufficient to secure us against all such
malicious calumniations. And how ever in rule of policy we cannot but judge
it convenient that two estates so inseparably conjoined, should be drawn to as
great conformity in all things as the good of both may permit; And that no
Monarchy either in Civil or Ecclesiastical policy has yet attained to that
perfection, that it needs no reformation, or that infinite occasions may not
arise whereupon wise Princes will foresee for the befite of their States, just
cause of alteration: Yet are we and have ever been resolved, not to make any
sudden or hasty change in the government of that part of our Kingdom, either
Civil or Ecclesiastical, but with grave advice and consent of our Estates,
and the wisest and best sort of them whom it most properly concerns, much
less to trouble them with any unnecessary alteration of indifferent and
Ceremonial matters, and that upon such foreseen advantages, and prevention of
confusion and evil to come, as the greatest enemies of all Peace, obedience to
Princes, and order in all governments shall not obtrude any inconvenient to the
contrary. And as by Gods holy assistance, we have drawn that part of our
Kingdom out of infinite troubles, factions, and cruel barbarities, and
reduced the uttermost borders and confines thereof to Gods obedience, and
acknowledging of our Laws; (an Estate never heard of before, since this Island
has been inhabited) So by the same divine providence and our fatherly care
over the whole Island, we intend to transmit the same in good order, happy
quietness, and flourishing policy to that posterity wherewith God has
blessed us, and after them to the worlds end; Like as for the more verification
of our Honorable intention, and to stop the mouths of these unquiet spirits,
raisers of that false scandal of alteration, We have appointed a general
assembly to be holden at Dundee the last Tuesday of July, whereat we excepect
reparation of those disorders in so far as belongs to their censure, and to
be freed in time coming of all such calumnies.

Given at our Honor of Hampton Court the 26. day of September, in the third
year of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. Anno Dom. 1605.
