A Seasonable Warning To such who profess themselves MEMBERS OF Reformed
Churches, INTO What Form soever gathered, or wherever scattered over the
face of the whole earth, but most especially to France, and the parts adjacent.

With a few remarkable QUERIES, etc.

Given forth in love to all souls, a tender visitation of breathing desires of
good to the whole Creation, by a friend thereof. CHARLES BAILY.

LONDON; Printed in the Year, 1663.

(...) try your spirits, and there is no difference between you and those you
seem to deny, for in nature ye are one, in pride and hypocrisy, envy, malice,
and cruelty, drunkenness, swearing, lying, whoredom, deceit, and whatsoever is
evil; and were the power in your hands, ye would be more cruel then those ye
seem to complain of, and in the ground there is no difference between you, for
ye have lost your suffering spirit, which was once amongst you at the first,
and are grown as vain in your Imaginations as any of the heathen of the
Nations? Therefore repent, repent ye also, and think not in your hearts that it
will serve your turns, to say you are reformed, while iniquity and abomination
is in your inward parts, and are not at all reformed from that (to wit)
iniquity; though ye say ye are saved by faith in Christ, ye are found wholly
out of that spirit and doctrine, which leads To do unto all men as ye would
others should do unto you (as your fruits has proved) some of you casting out
of the Synagogues or Temples, as the Jews did, and as is foretold should be
done unto my servants: Therefore be ye warned in time, and remember how the
Jews came under the reproof of the Just, when they said they were Abraham's
children, whilst they were Of their father the Devil, whose works they did;
and do you not think but your evil deeds are as abommable -- as theirs? they
boasted as well as you they were the children of my Covenant, while you and
them trample the Blood thereof under your feet; for which cause a curse came
upon them, and shall also come upon you, if ye repent not, and take not warning
in time, while my hand is stretched out toward you for good, that ye may live,
and not die in your sins, for if you die in your sins, Where I go ye cannot
come, says Christ Jesus the Light of the world, who is the Covenant of God
given for Salvation unto the ends of the earth and until ye come to this
Light, ye are far from being children of the Covenant, as ye pretend, but in
Covenant with Hell, Death, and the Devil, pleading for sin as long as you
live, which is the Devils Kingdom; and for so doing ye give men great sums of
money yearly, which is an abominable thing to the Lord God Almighty. And then
you say you are Christians by Baptism and the like, sprinkling a little water
upon the face or head of a child, and thereby have an entrance into the Church,
and yet will not admit the same to the Roman-Catholicke, though their Water
has as much virtue as yours, and the child of the one believes as much as the
other, and both when they grow up are in one nature; which shows plainly you
are ignorant of the one only true Baptism, which washes away sin and
corruption, and gives a true entrance into the Church which is in God, the
ground and Pillar of truth, into which no unclean thing can have an entrance,
for it is a spiritual House, built with living Stones, elect and precious,
Christ Jesus being the chief corner stone; who gave himself for it, That he
might present it to God without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; And this is
the true Church and Baptism which gives an entrance into it, and the true says
which once came and takes the possession. So read and try, and prove your
selves, If Christ be not in you, ye are reprobates, profess what you will; and
if Christ were in you, The body would be dead because of sin, but the spirit is
life because of righteousness: but how far you are from this, let the Light of
Christ Judge in you; therefore repent that ye may find mercy, and think not
that God will have respect unto your persons, no more then he had respect to
those who said They were Jews and were not, for because of that, he said he
would spue them out of his mouth; and seeing he spared not the natural
branches, but cut them off the root, because of transgression, do you think he
will spare you? Nay, verily The soul that sins shall die, says God; for he
spared not the Angels who kept not their first estate, but has reserved them
under the chains of darkness until the Judgment of the great day.

And let these things be a seasonable warning unto you, for it was so, and is
so, that he which is a Jew outwardly is not the true Jew, neither is he a
Christian who bears the name outwardly, and has not the nature of Christ;
all such are an abomination to the Lord. You are so far from being leavened
into his nature, which only makes a Christian, that if any one come amongst
you, and say he has the Spirit of God, he is had in great derision amongst
you, and is laughed at, to scorn, though the Apostle says, He that has not
the Spirit of Christ is none of his; and all who were Baptized with the true
Baptism, they received the Holy Ghost.

So read, consider, and try your selves, what state you are in, and do not
think that the nature of Christ is changed since the Apostles time, nay it is
all one, though many have the name, and are out of the nature. You fall a
quarelling and killing one another about their words; this was not the nature
of Christians, for they were the sons of God, led by his pure Holy Spirit,
which was Gentle, meek, and easy to be entreated, full of long-suffering, and
mercy, even to enemies, and ready to do good unto all; in which spirit walking,
they did not fulfill the lusts of the flesh, but in it conquered and had
dominion over sin, Hell, and the Devil; though a time of warfare they came to
witness, before they came unto this state, as all the Saints and holy men of
God ever did; witness the travel of the children of Israel through the
wilderness into the land of rest, which is the true Type of all the travel of
the faithful; for they came to witness the true Baptism, as it is written,
They were all Baptized into Moses under the Cloud, who was a true Type of
Christ, and because of unbelief many did not enter, because they received the
false report, and believed they should never overcome their enemies; which
things relate all unto the true spiritual warfare of every true Christian which
did believe and entered, and possessed the land of rest, which is the true
Sabbath; and it is written, He that believes has entered into rest, ceased
from sin, which is the enemy and adversary of all mankind; and to this did the
true Christians attain in this life, even a perfect Redemption from sin, and
did witness the Blood of Christ sufficient to purge them from all
unrighteousness; and says the Apostle, he which has Suffered in the flesh
has ceased from sin, (Mark) such ceased from sin, and witnessed the body of
sin put off; and again the Apostle Paul says unto the Romans, when they were
Servants unto sin they were free from righteousness, being then made free from
sin, they Became the servants of righteousness: So these things did the true
Christians come to witness, though you are not ashamed to take their words to
plead for the Devils Kingdom as long as you live, though the Apostle says,
His servants ye are to whom ye obey; So he which obeys sin, is a servant of
sin; and the Apostle James says, let no man say When he is tempted, that he is
tempted of God, for God tempts not to evil, but when a man is tempted unto
lust he is tempted of the Devil, and lust when it is conceived brings forth
sin, and sin when it is finished brings forth death; so be not deceived with
vain words, For such as you sow, such shall you reap; if you sow to the
Spirit, ye shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting, but if to the flesh, ye
shall of the flesh reap corruption; for the wages of sin is death, but the
gift of God is eternal life. So come all to the gift of God, which is the Light
of Christ Jesus, which he has enlightened you withal, and you will come to
know the free grace of God unto Salvation, which will teach you to deny all
ungodly lusts, and not to plead for them, and to live Soberly and righteously
in this present evil world; (Mark) this is the fruit and effect of the Grace
of God, and is not only given to talk of, and say you are saved by grace,
while you turn from it in wantonness, which the Saints and Christians did not,
but came through the Cross to be saved, even from sin, and being redeemed from
their vain conversation, which they lived in in times past, and so witnessed a
new birth, which was of God, which sinned not, being washed with water by the
word, which word is Christ the Savior of the soul; and all who comes to know
the word abiding in them, they do know and witness this state, even a perfect
state from sin; and that was their boldness in the day of Judgment, that as
Christ was, so were they in this present world, perfect, even as their Father
which is in Heaven is perfect.

So here is a true measuring line for you to measure your selves by, what stock
and lineage ye are of, and who is your Father, and whom ye obey; for the true
Christians Christ was their Example in all things, and left them a perfect
Example, that they should follow his steps, who said Learn of me, for I am
meek and lowly in heart; and the true Christians followed him, and were like
minded in all things.

Friends, my hearts desire is to the Lord for you, that you may be saved and
come to the knowledge of truth, which truth will make you free from sin and
pollution, though this thing stumbled the Jews, when Christ spoke it unto them,
for they looked out at some worldly thing, not considering they were servants
to sin, which was the cause of all their misery. Therefore be ye warned, and
fear pleading for that which will be your utter destruction, if ye live and die
in it; read through the whole Book of Scripture, and see if ever any Covenant
of God stood with any Nation, or people, but as they did forsake their sins;
or, were there ever any people to whom God did so largely manifest himself as
unto the Jews? and yet when they forsook the holy Commandment, which was
delivered unto them, did not the Lord forsake them? yea verily, and will all
who do the like. But if any of you shall say, they were under a Covenant of
works, and we under grace; were they not under the Covenant of grace as well
as any? yea verily, in all their travels did not the spiritual Rock follow
them, which was Christ? And after the Law was administered unto them by Moses,
did not he preach the true and living faith unto them? saying, they were not to
say, Who shall ascend or go beyond the Seas, that they may hear and do it; but
what said he? The word is nigh you, even in your mouth and in your heart, that
ye may do it; and was not this the same word of faith the Apostle Preached, yea
even the living faith, which gives dominion over sin, Hell, Death, and the
Grave, by which all the Saints of old had their glorious dominion, and by which
the Just lives; and they who come to witness this true and living faith, they
know a Shield against all the fiery darts of the Devil, which faith Works by
love, and love fulfilleth the whole law of God, which is to love God with all
thy heart, and thy neighbor as thy self. So here is the true faith, and the
man which is in it does unto all men as he would all should do unto him, which
is the true Christians life, and there is not another. Oh! how does my soul
pity you, to see the blindness and ignorance you are fallen into, though ye
pretend the Scripture to be your rule, which condemns you in all your
practices, as will plainly appear, when you come to be tried by them; does any
thing avail but a new Creature, does not the Scripture say? and also does not
Christ say, Except ye be converted and become as a little child, ye cannot
inherit the Kingdom of Heaven? And again, Except ye be born again, ye cannot
see the Kingdom of God? Is there any true Christians but who witness this
state and birth? nay verily, there is not any but those who follows Christ
through the Regeneration, who comes to sit with him in his Fathers Kingdom;
Is there any who do not suffer with him that shall Reign with him? Consider
these things in the cool of the day, and do not any longer take up a rest and
a security in a bear name, but come to the nature, and then you will witness a
true redemption out of all earthly affections, and not plead for them, but
loath them; for the Saints conversation was in Heaven, which are above you
which plead for beggarly lust, which shuts out of the Kingdom, For no unclean
thing can enter there. These things I speak unto you in great plainness and
singleness of heart, as I am moved of the Lord, that ye may come to the true
Salvation from sin; for who knows Christ and his power, knows him to be in
virtue as he is in name, even A Savior of his people from their sins;
therefore is his name called Jesus: God has sworn that he delights not in
the death of a sinner, for he has prepared a way and a means for the Salvation
of all that they might be saved; For he so loved the world, that he has given
his only begotten Son into the world, that all through him might believe; for
he is the Covenant of God, even a Covenant of Light unto all Nations, that he
might be his Salvation unto the ends of the earth. This testimony John did bear
of him, that he was the true Light which enlightens every man which comes into
the world, and as many as receive him, and believe in his name, even in the
Light, to them he gives power to become the Sons of God, which is another
birth then yours, Which is of the flesh, and will of man. Read and consider,
you that desire Salvation unto your souls, for it is the visitation of Gods
eternal love unto you, for I am truly constrained by his pure Spirit hereunto,
therefore whether you will hear or forbear, I shall be a sweet savor unto
God, Even in them which believe, and in them which perish: But my hearts desire
is that ye may come into the Covenant of God and be saved, even to be taught,
led, and guided by him, for the way is plain, and it is but one in all, even
the Light which reproves for sin, and makes manifest all the deeds of darkness
though never so secret; for says the Apostle, whatsoever makes manifest is
Light: he that comes to that which makes manifest comes to Christ, for says
he I am the Light of the world, I am the way, No man comes to the Father, but
by me; So come to the Light, and then you will come to the Way, the Truth, and
the Life, and this will be more then a bear name unto you, life and truth, even
truth in the inward part, which God only accepts, out of which all
profession is vain; therefore he which comes to the Light, comes to the truth,
and comes to know the teachings of God, as it is written All thy children shall
be taught of me, and great shall be their peace; so in the Light you will
witness the teachings of God, which is his holy Covenant with his people; I
will write my law in their hearts, says God, and put it in their inward parts;
the law is Light, says Solomon, and if you come to turn to the Light, you will
witness the same. I will live in them, and walk in them, says God; (Mark)
this is the holy, true, and everlasting Covenant of God to his people, and this
the true Christians came to witness, even their bodies to be the Temples of God
through the Spirit; and God dwells with no unclean thing, neither dares such
a one plead for sin as long as he lives, for they are sanctified and made fit
for their Masters use, not having only the form of Godliness, but the life and
power, and they who had the form without the power, were to be turned from it;
which power is the Light, which comes from Christ and leads up to God; and
the Saints were Saints in Light, for they were sanctified by it, which was the
will of God: And as says the Apostle, this is the will of God, even your
Sanctification; this is no new Doctrine, but the good Old Way which God has
prepared, even for his Ransomed ones to walk in, in which path, the way faring
men (though fools) shall not err therein, for the way is Light, as says the
Apostle, if ye live in the Light, and walk in the Light, as he is in the Light,
then have, we Fellowship with God, and one with another; (Mark) fellowship with
God, this Light leads unto, in which the Saints fellowship only stood, which
brought them to the knowledge of God; and he which said he knew God, and walked
in darkness was a liar, for the darkness comprehends not the Light, (which is
the only habitation and Covenant of God) so as you come truly to confess your
sins, you will witness the Blood of Christ to cleanse you from all
unrighteousness; but if you say you have not sin, before you come to this, and
say it is done away in Christ, then you are liars, and the truth is not you, no
more then it is in them who say they have not sinned; as you come to witness
the Blood of Christ, and its virtue, you will witness these sayings to be true
and faithful, not only to be talked of, but to be witnessed in you, and
until you come here, you are perfect strangers unto the several states and
growths the true Christians came through in their Warfare; there was little
children, young men, and old men; for says John, I write unto you, little
children, that ye sin not, and if any man sin, we have an advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins,
and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world: (Mark) He
freely offered up himself for all; And by this we know that we know him, if we
keep his Commandments: He that says, I know him, and keeps not his
Commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. (Mark) the true
Christians state is life: And consider what state, and nature you are in, and
whether ye keep Christ's Commandment yea, or nay, for these things are of great
weight and concernment unto you, even you that have taken up the name, but are
out of the nature. And again says the Apostle, Whose keeps his Word, in him
verily in the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him: (Mark)
by this they (the true Christians) knew that they were in Christ, because they
kept his word, and he which dwells in him ought to walk even as he walked;
are you here? nay, your consciences witnesses to your faces the contrary;
therefore forbear the name until you witness the life, else the greater will
be your condemnation; which is the Word of the Lord unto you all; therefore be
ye warned in time. And again says he, A new Commandment I write unto you,
which thing is true, in him, and in you, because the darkness is past, and the
true light now shines: (Mark) again they did witness the darkness past, and
the true Light to shine, which Light gives the Light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; which treasure, says Paul, we have
in Earthen vessels; this treasure, even the Light, they (the true Christians)
witnessed in them, and walking in it, had fellowship with it, and one with
another, For God is Light, and he which lives and walks in the Light, lives
and walks with God, and witnesses a true translation, as Enoch did, and is
not seen, Because his life is hid with Christ in God; and this is a true
translation from death to life, which is the true Christians life, and he which
says he is in the Light, and hates his brother, is a liar, and is in darkness
even until now; he which loves his brother dwells in the Light, and
stumbleth not: (Mark) he who loves and walks in the Light, stumbleth not,
because he walks in that which makes manifest all things, even the hidden
works of darkness, which by the Light is reproved and judged: But he which
hates his brother walks in darkness, and knows not whether he goes, because
the darkness has blinded his eyes; so he which walks in darkness knows not
whether he goes, even because he is from the Covenant of God, (which is Light)
wherein he should walk, as all the ransomed and redeemed of the Lord does: And
this, David did witness, who said, God is my Light, and my Salvation; and all
which comes to the Light and lives in it, witness the same thing, and are not
ashamed to bring their deeds unto the Light, because they are wrought in God;
but he which does evil, Hates the Light, neither comes he to the Light,
because his deeds are evil: Therefore come and try if your deeds are wrought in
God, by bringing them to the Light; and if by the Light they are Justified,
then none can condemn you; but if the Light condemn you, none can justify
you, For all Judgment is committed unto the Son, who is the Light, and
inlightneth every one whith comes into the world, which Light is a sure word
of Prophecy, whereunto if ye take heed, ye do well, (as the true Christians
did) as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawne, and
the day Star arise in your hearts; for it is the light of the righteous, which
lightneth more and more until the perfect day, and gives a discovery of all
things; but the wicked (being from that which makes manifest) walks in
darkness and knows not at what they stumble, which is a woeful state, for
they are from the light of the glorious Gospel; and you to cover your selves,
say the letter is (calling Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) the Gospel, when you
are ignorant of the Gospel of Peace, which is Christ the true light and Savior
of the Soul.

Therefore give care and harden not your hearts ye Protestants in this Nation,
least God smite you with a curse, and leave you to perish in your sins for
ever; therefore come all to the light, that a true regenerate state ye may
witness, as the true Christians did, who witnessed the state of a child, a
young man, and old man; and the Apostle writing unto such, said, I write unto
you little children, because ye have known the Father; I write unto you
fathers, because ye have known him which if from the beginning; I have written
unto you young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you,
and ye have overcome the wicked one. Read and consider, the least in this state
knew God, and as they did grow up in the knowledge of God, they came to
overcome the Devil, who is the father of all sin, which is a true Christians
warfare; therefore come away, And put on the whole Armor of Light, and take
unto you the Shield of Faith, and the fiery darts of the Devil will come to be
quenched by you; and as good Soldiers you will overcome, and witness the evil
one overcome in you, which is the strong man which keeps the house, but coming
to Christ and witnessing him, you will know the stronger come, which will take
the possession in you, and spoil the strong man's goods, who had first the
Dominion and whole possession in you. And this is counsel of life and truth
unto you all, that ye may come to be true children of Gods everlasting
Covenant, and witness the anointing in you, which is the light, which will
teach you all things, and is truth, and is no lie; and as the same teaches
you, if ye obey and follow it, ye shall abide in it, which will be your portion
for ever, and is the true portion of all the redeemed of God, who come to
witness the birth which is of God, Which sins not, neither can they, because
the seed of God abides in them, which seed is Christ the hope of their glory:
And this is the mystery which the Apostle speaks of, which was hid from Ages
and Generations, which was then made manifest unto the true Christians; and
except ye come to witness this, ye are reprobates; for Christ Jesus is that
seed which was promised should Bruise the Serpents head, which became head in
man after transgression, and his head being bruised by the seed of the woman,
came to be perfectly restored into the Image and glory he was first created in,
even into the Image of his Creator, who is God blessed for ever more of all his
redeemed ones, who witnesses this fulfilled in them, as many do at this day;
Immortal and endless praise be rendered to his holy name for ever, for they come
to know that the power of the tempter is not of more force then the Redeemer;
but the redeemed, even by Christ the Light, comes to know his head bruised in
them, who separated them from God; and this is the true and faithful Christians
state and life, even to live and walk in the power of his Creator and Redeemer
all the days of his sojourning in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation, in which pure righteous and holy life they cannot plead for sin,
but stands as living witnesses against all unrighteousness whatsoever; and for
this cause are they hated and reviled, because they are as a City which is set
on a hill, that cannot be hid, and that torments the wicked; and they are the
Salt of the earth, and have Salt in themselves to savor and try all things
withal, and are not afraid of being deceived, (but Tries all things, and
holds fast that which is good) for they only are the elect of God, and
cannot (for it is impossible for them to) be deceived, but on the contrary
stands witnesses against the deceiver and all his works, therefore are hated by
his children, even as they hated Christ, for says Christ, The world cannot
hate you, but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works are evil;
but the world loves its own, And the whole world lies in wickedness, as says
the Scripture: And who comes to be redeemed out of the world, comes to be hated
by the children of the world, even as they did their Lord and Master; the
servant is not greater then his Lord, who suffered the contradiction of
sinners, and laid down his life for his enemies, and prayed for them, which is
the true Christians life.

So as you would prize your eternal happiness, slight not this day, your day of
visitation, but prize it, and you will find mercy, for God of a truth has much
mercy in store for you, if ye reject it not; but if you do, then tribulation
and anguish shall possess your souls for evermore: Therefore while you have a
day and time prize it, before it be too late; and remember Esau, who had a
birthright and despised it, and do you thereby take warning; and read, search,
and see your state, if you are true Christians and redeemed of God, and be no
longer fed with a name, for they were a Royal Priesthood, a holy nation, and
did Reign as Kings upon the earth, even over the World, Sin, Hell, Death, and
the Devil; and though on the earth, yet they loved not the world, neither the
things of the world, but used all those as though they used them not; being in
the Light, which is Christ the wisdom of God, they came to use all creatures
in the same wisdom as they were created, and to the same end, for by Christ
Jesus (the eternal Word of the Father) were all things created; and as ye come
to live and walk in him (who is the wisdom of the Father) ye will come to the
right use and understanding of all things, and know and witness the ends of the
earth upon you, and your conversation will be in Heaven far above all created
things: Therefore come all to the word by which all was created, even the good
word of God, which is quick, powerful, and sharper then any two edged Sword,
dividing between the precious and the vile, the clean and the unclean, for it
is a discerner of the thoughts, and intents of the heart; and this is the true
word which sanctifies and makes clean, which is Christ the Light, the Word of
God, which will be a Light and a Lanthorn unto your path, if you diligently
heed and follow it, as David did witness; and unless you come to witness this
word in you, you can never witness Christ, nor the end of his coming, Who has
given himself for us, to redeem us from this present evil world, according to
the will of God. These things are plain to every single eye, Who desires not to
hold the truth in unrighteousness, nor make Christ a cover for sin, and
uncleanness, by crying they are saved by Christ, and have remission through his
Death, and shed his Blood for their Redemption, and yet witness nothing they
are redeemed or saved from, and are aliens unto the Covenant of promise, which
is That he shall save his people from their sins; and his Blood which purifies,
sanctifies and makes clean, for so the true Christians did witness it, even
through it they had access to God, and were redeemed from their vain lives and
conversations through and by it, even By the Blood of the Lamb, which was
offered up to God Without spot or blemish, who has also given himself for his
Church, that he might present it in like manner unto God, which is a spiritual
building, Built and joined together, a spiritual house, an holy Priesthood, to
offer up sacrifices acceptable to God, Christ being the chief corner stone,
even he who the builders have in all Ages rejected and refused; therefore come
to the living Stone, that ye may be joined and united to it, as the Christians
were; and as you come to be joined here, you will come to be one Spirit in the
Lord, and be covered with it, without which covering, woe unto you, as it is
written, Woe be unto you who are covered, and not with my Spirit, (says the
Lord) for the day is come and coming even upon you, O ye Protestants in France,
as well as in all Nations, that all other coverings will be too short for to
hide you, and will stand you in no stead in the day of trial.

Therefore be awakened, and awake, arise and stand up ye which sleep in the
dust, and the Lord shall give you Light and understanding of the things which
belongs unto your peace, in this the day of your visitation; therefore sleep
not any longer in a false security, least they be hid from your eyes, and you
be left desolate, and without excuse for ever; for of a truth, this is the day
of Gods everlasting love and mercy unto you, which constrains me to warn you,
and woe would be unto me if I did not; but whether you hear or forbear, I shall
be a sweet savor unto God if ye perish, therefore I use great plainness of
speech unto you, and not as man's wisdom teaches, but in the demonstration of
the Spirit I speak, beseeching you to be reconciled unto God, I being one who
truly has known the terrors of the Lord for sin, and has been accepted at
the tribunal seat of God, for Christ sake, in whom and through whom I have had
access unto God, and by his stripes am healed, and purged by his Blood from sin
and corruption, and this has not been of works, but by grace I am saved,
through faith in Christ, by which victory is obtained, through patience and
hope, which purifies even as Christ is pure, Which hope is an Anchor unto the
soul in the time of trial: And this has God done for my soul, not by any works
of my own righteousness, as though I had any thing to boast of above another,
for all boasting is excluded for ever by the Law of Faith, neither have I any
thing but what I have received of God, whose love has been in an unexpressible
manner extended unto me, since I gave up unto him, and believed his report by
his holy servants, and messengers of his holy, new and everlasting Covenant
unto the sons of men, which is Light; and in, and with the same love the Father
has loved me, am I drawn forth to invite you my Contrymen after the flesh,
whom God moved me to visit, even from a far Country, where my outward
habitation was many years, even in Virginia; and truly my soul is often powered
out unto God for you, and sure I am if you do not wilfully reject his love, but
open freely unto him, his love will touch many of your hearts, as it has
touched mine, which if you receive, you will I know with a ready heart and mind
follow him, and forsake all earthly treasure to follow him in the delightful
way of peace, and holiness. And dear Contrymen, remember Moses who chose
Rather to suffer afflictions with the people of God, then to enjoy the
pleasures of sin for a season, refusing to be called the son of Pharaohs
Daughter; and take all the holy Servants and Prophets of God for an example of
patience and suffering, through which, and by which they plainly declared, they
sought not a habitation in this world, but were strangers and Pilgrims therein,
Seeking a City whose builder and maker is God, into which my soul desires that
ye may have an entrance and habitation, even into the new and Heavenly
Jerusalem, which comes down from God, into which nothing that works
abomination, or makes a lie can enter, Though the gates thereof stand open day
and night, but without are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and all uncleanness: And this
the true Christians waited for, even for a new Heaven, and a new earth wherein
dwells righteousness; therefore says the Apostle Peter, Seeing these things,
what manner of persons ought we to be? yea they were to be holy, just in all
their conversation; for of a truth all the true Christians came to witness
this, even all old things to pass away, and all things to become new, without
which the new creature cannot be witnessed, Which is renewed after the Image of
him who has created him. Therefore as an Ambassador from God, I beseech you in
Christ, lay these things to heart, and count it not as a vain thing, or as an
idle tale, but remember that because of sin and iniquity, God did ever send
Plagues and Judgments unto the sons of men, and when they would not be warned
thereby, he swept them away in his wrath, for so has he appointed in his
determined counsel, That the wicked shall not go unpunished, but they shall be
cast into Hell, and all who forget God, for he is no respecter of persons, for
of all Nations he who fears him and works righteousness is accepted of
him, but Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man which does evil, for
his wrath is revealed from Heaven against all ungodlynesse, and
unrighteousness of men, and he is not partial in judgment (as some would
make him) that he will punish one man for sin, and not another, nay it is not
so with him, for Such as every man sows, such shall he reap, and every one
shall receive a just and due reward for the deeds done in the body, whether
they be good, or whether they be evil: The unfaithful servant had a Talent
given him to improve as well as the rest, but his unfaithfulness was the cause
that it was taken from him, and he cast into utter darkness for ever, but the
faithful entered into the joy of his Lord; and this will assuredly be the
portion, and sentence of all the sons of men; the workers of iniquity shall be
tormented with the Devil and his Angels for ever: And it will not suffice to
say Lord, Lord, in thy name we have done many things, yea they came so far as
to cast out Devils, and prophesied in the name of Christ, (and so far as this,
none of you at this day hardly ever came yet,) and notwithstanding Christ said
he know them not, depart from me ye cursed workers of iniquity.

Read and consider, and lay it to heart, that ye may be an holy people, and
come to answer Gods Everlasting love which is tendered unto you, least the
grace of God bestowed upon you be in vain, and loose the entering into the Land
of promise through unbelief, which was the cause why so many fell in the
Wilderness and dyed, though they were come forth out of the Land of darkness,
and had seen the wonders of the Lord, which are set forth as examples for those
who should come after, for the Gospel was preached unto them, as well as unto
you: And truly from a good understanding do I declare it unto you, that if ye
be willing and obedient, a larger possession never had any people then the Lord
will possess you with, and ye shall eat the good thereof in peace; for if ye
accept and embrace his love, and reject not his counsel (which is freely
tendered unto you) he will rebuke Princes and Kings for your sakes; but if ye
harden your necks, ye shall be of many people most miserable: And these are
words of truth, and of a good understanding unto you all, which will stand a
witness for God, either with you, or against you for ever, against you if ye
reject it, and for you if ye receive it; for of a truth Gods Eternal and
Everlasting love is tendered unto you, in and through which if ye receive it,
and be faithful to what the Lord will yet further manifest unto you, ye shall
be blessed with faithful Abraham for ever, who forsaked his Fathers house to
follow the Lord he knew not whether, and stumbled not at the promise of the
Lord, but was faithful, therefore was he called the friend of God, and the
Father of the faithful: I say take him for an example, and God Almighty will
give you Dominion, and honor you before many, if you honor him; but if you
despise him, he will despise you, and if ye refuse to hear him now when he
calls unto you, the day is nigh when ye shall call, and he will not hear, which
is a word of eternal truth unto you* Therefore arise in the Spirit of
meekness, and stand a witness against all superstitions and Idolatry, not
only in word, but in life and practice; and turn to the light of Christ Jesus,
which condemns sin and evil in you, so will ye become children of the light,
and become a living testimony against all sin, so will ye be a sweet savor
unto the Lord in your generation, and happy will the man be who joins to the
Lord in deed and in truth in this work, his name shall be had in everlasting
remembrance for evermore; so let the fear and dread of God Allmighty possess
your hearts, and the wicked shall be dreaded by you, and brought into
subjection within you and without you for ever: And this is the word of the
Lord unto you, and blessed will ye be if ye hear and obey it, for the youth
shall faint, and the young Lion shall suffer hunger, but they which fear the
Lord shall never want any good thing, for the fear of the Lord is clean, and
the beginning of a true Christian* therefore blessed is the man which fears
always, he shall be blessed in his deed, and shall prosper and flourish like a
green Bay tree, which is planted by the rivers of water, bringing forth fruit
in due season, to the praise and glory of his Creator, and the Lord will spread
his table in the sight of his enemies, while they suffer hunger: And this will
the Lord do for the upright in heart, whose hands are not polluted with blood,
nor deceit harbored between his lips, even he shall see the travail of his
soul and be satisfied, and his days shall be prosperous in the land of
promise, and the sons of the aliens shall be his servants; this shall surely be
the heritage of those who confess and forsake their sins, but he which hides
it shall not prosper, even his prayers shall be loathsome unto the Lord, and
all his sacrifices an abominable abomination; but he which purifieth his way by
taking heed unto the Law of the Lord, though he be simple, yet shall he be made
wise, and his soul shall be converted, for the Lord will perfect his glorious
praise in the mouths of babes and sucklings, and this thing shall be marvelous
in the eyes of many.

These are prophesies of things which shall shortly come to pass; therefore
blessed is he which watches, that he may not be found naked, for the day of
the Lord is coming on like a theif in the night upon all the inhabitants of the
Earth, wherein the hearts of all shall be made manifest, and made bare and
naked, of what Nation or profession soever, and it shall prove you who say you
are Jews and are not, and every man's works shall be tried of what sort they
are, and all coverings besides the pure Holy Spirit of the Lord shall be as
Adams Fig Leaves were, and when the Lord shall call them to an account, they
shall fear to appear before him because of their transgressions, and Gods
witness in all shall answer unto his just judgments which shall come upon
them, the hypocrites shall weep and howl, and many shall call to the Hills and
Mountains to hide them from the wrath of the Lamb, whom they have wilfully
despised and rejected: Therefore be ye warned in time, and see and search
diligently what you are built upon, for no other foundation shall be able to
abide the dreadful day of Gods controversy with the sons and daughters of men,
but the Rock of ages, and he which is not built upon this, let him be never so
secure in his own conceit or in the eye of flesh, his building shall utterly
perish and come to naught, and great shall be his ruin: Therefore come all to
the Light, and make no other foundation but that, if ye desire to abide the day
of trial which is near, even at the door; therefore this warning is sent unto
you in an acceptable time, that ye may take warning before it be too late, for
a consummate decree is determined of the Lord, which shall consume and destroy
all the workers of iniquity for ever; therefore blessed will the man be who
has not walked in their way, nor sits in the seat of the scornful after he
is warned, but shall cleave to the Law of God, and meditate therein, his
offspring shall be prosperous in the Earth, and his name shall be written in
the book of life for ever, he shall wash his garments white in the blood of the
Lamb, and follow him, who has a Bow and a Sword, and makes war in
righteousness against the Dragon and his Followers, (even the Man of Sin) who
has long sitten in the Temple of God, and said, He is God, but by the Lamb
shall he be overcome and his followers, and all that are found in resistance of
Gods power shall be cast into the pit of endless torments for ever; and the
day is already dawned wherein this glorious work shall be accomplished:
Therefore beware with whom ye join in battle, for the Lamb makes war in
righteousness against all sin and the appearance thereof, but the Dragon and
his followers shall be to uphold it, and plead for it, and imprison such as bear
testimony against it, so each will be known by their weapons, their fruits, and
their colors; the one's weapons are spiritual, the others carnal; the one is
in unrighteousness, the other in righteousness; the one is in blood and
revenge, the other in suffering and patience, so you may easily distinguish
between them, and will not be able to plead ignorance in the day of account,
for it was ever so from the beginning, the just suffering by the unjust, the
seed of the Bondwoman persecuting the seed of the Freewoman, which never
persecuted any; therefore be ye warned of joining with the persecuting spirit
of Antichrist, for if you do, you shall assuredly as the Lord God of Heaven
and Earth lives partake of his plagues; but rather cast out the Bondwoman and
her son, that ye may be heirs with the seed of the Freewoman which keep the
Commandments of God, so will ye be heirs of the promise, and of the mercy of
God, which is freely tendered unto you, through his simple servant, who is at
present a sufferer in the patience and tribulation of the Lamb, on whom the
Lord has laid a necessity to warn thee O nation of France, that thou may
find mercy in this the day of Gods free love, which is tendered unto thee; and
though this reaches unto the whole Nation, yet in particular it is sent to you
who are called by the name of the Reformed Religion, to the end that ye may not
only be so in name, but also in life and practice, without which your name will
but add unto your condemnation, as has already been told you: God is purposed
to try you and your foundation, and a name will not serve the turn, and except
ye partake of the nature of the sufferance of Gods seed and spirit of truth in
you, and turn to the Lord by putting away the evil of your doings, ye shall
surely partake of her plagues; which is the word of the Lord God of Heaven and
Earth unto you all, for her sins have exceeded the sins of Sodom, and the
measure of her iniquity is even up, and judgment is already prepared for her;
therefore be ye separated from your iniquities in time, for the word is gone
out of the mouth of the Lord, and can never be recalled, but shall surely
accomplish the thing which he has purposed; therefore my bowels are drawn
forth in love toward you, that ye may not perish with the uncircumcised and
unclean, but that rather ye may come to repentance and amendment of life, and
live for ever, which is the true desire of his soul.

Friends, the Lord is about to do a wonderful work in the Earth, which many
cannot believe, though it were told them, but the upright in heart shall see it
and praise him, yea the youth shall rejoice, and the virgins shall be glad, and
the Saints shall admire, and smite upon their breasts in beholding the
wonderful works of the Allmighty, which he purposes to do in this generation:
And therefore give ear unto me, and be not hard of heart nor unbelieving, and I
will through the spirit of the Lord which is upon me, show unto you the
certainty of things which shall shortly come to pass. The Lord will cast down
the haughty and the proud from his throne, and will exalt the humble and the
meek, yea, he will rebuke the proud, and give grace unto the humble: He will
exalt his horn over all that shall rise up against him, he will break the bond
of oppression, and set the Nations at liberty, that his name may be glorified
from one end of the Earth unto the other, though at present his name is not
known amongst the sons of men, and he be more a stranger, and less known
amongst them, then the Ox to his owner, or the Ass to his masters crib, yet
shall the knowledge of him cover the whole earth, even as the waters cover the
Seas: He will overturn all Idolaters, and all Idols for ever, and all who shall
set a hand to uphold them; all Idol Priests shall be turned into confusion for
ever; the haughty seat shall be laid low, and the humble and the meek shall be
exalted, yea, he will by his own arm and Allmighty power arise, and plead the
cause of the innocent, and set the oppressed free, and enlarg the borders of
the innocent, and the meek shall take the possession, and the glorious glory of
his renown shall go over all, which shall strike dread unto his enemies; he
will thresh the mountains to dust before him, and the wicked shall be but as
the stubble which is dried before the fire, and shall be consumed for ever; he
who is mightier then the mightiest will do this; he even he before whom all
Nations are but as the drop of a Bucket, and weighs the hills in a scale, and
the mountains in a balance, and measures the waters in the hollow of his
hand, will accomplish the thing which he has purposed, and the word which is
gone out of his mouth; for as the rain which falls upon the Earth and
returns not again, so is the word of the Lord which is gone out of his mouth,
which shall not return, but shall accomplish his purpose, which is to subdue
all the Kingdoms of this World, into the subjection of his own only anointed
seed, to live and reign over all, and in all, who is blessed for evermore, in
whom all the promises of the father are Yea, and Amen, for the promise was not
unto many, but unto the seed, when he spoke unto Abraham the Father of the
faithful, In thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed, which
Seed is Christ which shall have the Dominion in all, and over all for ever: Let
him which reads understand; The Government shall be put upon his shoulder,
and who will not willingly subject unto it shall be beaten to pieces with his
Iron Rod, with which he shall rule all Nations; and this is the little stone
which is cut out of the mountain without hands, which became a great mountain,
and covered the whole Earth, which hastneth apace to be fulfilled, even so
says my Soul, Amen, and Amen. And for the fulfilling of this his glorious
word, the Lord will not only shake the Earth, but the Heavens also, and will
Overturn, Overturn, Overturn Kings, Princes, and Powers, even all those who
shall rise up against him, and will tear them in pieces, as he has already
apparently done; when the Lord will work who shall let? the Heathen may rage,
and the people imagine a vain thing, and the Judges of the Earth may take
counsel against the Lord and against his Anointed, but all in vain, for he
will exalt him to reign upon his holy hill of Sion for evermore, in the sight
of all his enemies, to their utter overthrow and confusion for ever: Your
Judges shall be restored as at the first, and Counselors as at the beginning,
who will not judge for gift, nor reward, the wicked shall no more be called
good, nor the churl liberal, light shall not be put for darkness, nor
darkness for light, but all shall be judged by him who sees in secret, and
who lives for ever, whose Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, of which there
is no end.

Therefore come to the just in you all in the particular, even to the Seed of
God in you all, which of his infinite mercy he has left in you, else long ere
now had ye been destroyed, and made like unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, but for his
seed sake has he withheld his hand from destroying you until this day; and
consider the end of Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof, and their end, when the
just was taken from amongst them, and even as it was with them, so shall it be
with you; if you harden your hearts, and will not hear, the Lord will take the
just Seed from you, which suffers daily by you, and is oppressed in you, even
as a Cart which is pressed and laden with sheaves, and grieved as the just was
in Sodom by their unrighteous and ungodly conversation; and if it be once taken
away from you, though the faithful may make intercession for you, as Abraham
did for them, yet as sure as the Lord God of Heaven and Earth lives, your end
shall be as theirs, for if once the just in you be taken away, naught but fury
and vengeance will be poured upon you from Heaven, until you be utterly
swallowed up with the eternal flames of Gods fury and vengeance for evermore;
for whose sake I am now moved to warn you from the wrath which is to come, and
if you refuse and reject, and despise his everlasting Messengers, (as they
did,) take them for an example (for God has made them so) of his wrath, to all
who shall reject his loving kindness, mercy and counsel.

Therefore in bowels of mercy and pity am I drawn forth again, and again to
warn you, and advise and beseech you to turn unto the just pure holy principle
of God in you, and give up to be guided by it, and governed by it in all
things, that ye may be leavened into its own nature, even the incorruptible
nature of God, that ye may come to witness the new creature, which is the
first Resurrection, over which the second Death has no power, and as many of
you as come to walk according to this rule, peace will be unto you and with you
for ever, peace which the world can neither give nor take from you, even the
peace of God, which will rule in your hearts, which will keep your hearts and
minds spotless and blameless for ever; and the power of the cross of Christ
you will come to witness to be the power of God unto salvation, as you believe
and are subject unto it, whereby the world will become crucified unto you, and
you unto the world, and nothing else will you desire to glory in, but will come
even to be ashamed of those things which ye now delight in, and have no more
pleasure in them, nor fashion your selves as you did in the former time of
ignorance, as the Heathen did in vain and foolish habit, idle and foolish talk,
such things will be an abomination unto the Lord of your life, by whom ye
breath, and nothing can or will proceed out of your mouth but that which is
good to the use of edifying, and according to the promise of God you will come
to witness, even the pouring out of his Spirit upon you, and your Sons, and
your daughters shall prophecy, your young men shall see visions, and your old
men shall dream dreams; and every one of you shall sit under his own Vine, and
under his own Fig Tree, and none shall make you afraid; and you will not need
to go to men for teaching, nor every one say to his neighbor know the Lord,
for all of you shall know him from the least unto the greatest, and shall say
one to another, come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and he will
teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his light for ever; and the Lord
will make a hedge about you, and set his holy Angels to watch over you, and
prune you, that as ye come to bring forth fruit unto him, ye may bring it forth
more abundantly; to the honor and delight of the Lord will ye be for ever,
which his own right hand has planted, and none shall be able to pluck you up,
for he will keep you in the hollow of his hand, and they which shall touch you
to harm you, shall be as though they touched the apple of his eye; and though
for a time some of you may be suffered to be tried for the trial of others, yet
assuredly, it shall be but for a short season, and a book of remembrance
thereof will be written before the Lord, and you will delight to meet often
together to speak of his goodness, and he will assuredly be in the midst of
you, and ye shall be his Temple Sanctified and made meet for his Use, and he
will delight to take up his habitation with you for ever; and remember Satan
may have power given to kill some of you, and put some of you in prison ten
days.

Read and understand, and be not dismayed at these things when they shall come
upon you, For so did they persecute of old the holy Prophets of God before you;
and if any of you shall go in this cause to save your lives, ye shall assuredly
lose it, but they which shall lay it down for this testimony shall surely save
it; And whosoever shall forsake Father or Mother, for my sake (says Christ)
shall receive in this life an hundred fold, and in the world to come life
everlasting. And as I have said, a day and a time of trial may come over you,
But a short work will the Lord make in the earth for his Seeds sake, And the
Rod of the wicked shall not always rest upon the back of the righteous, says
the Lord God Allmighty: But I have said (in and through the good Spirit of the
Lord, and by the strength of his own Arm which is made bare) he will burst the
bonds of your oppressors asunder, that his oppressed seed may go free, even to
the ends of the uttermost habitations of the earth.

Therefore I say again to the holy Seed in you, even the Seed of the Kingdom,
Which is as a grain of mustard seed, yea the least of all things in you, which
if ye diligently need, prize and follow, it will become a great plant, and
cover the whole earth in you; which if ye do, the good which I have showed you
in faithfulness to God, and which is to all your immortal souls, will come
upon you; but if ye refuse and reject the good council of the Lord unto you,
and join to the power of the oppressor to keep the Seed in bondage, then know
as sure as the Lord lives, the just shall be taken from you, and all the evil
I have been made to Prophecy of shall come upon your heads in a day when ye
looked not for it, even when ye may be eating and drinking, and Marrying and
giving in marriage. Remember the old world, and take ye warning before it be
too late, For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man, which is
the Word of the Lord God unto you all, and woe be unto that man, or Nation, as
the Spirit of the Lord shall cease striving with, better were it that they had
never been born; for a manifestation of his holy Spirit has been given to
every one to profit withal, which is the Lords money, and your talent, and
misery will be the portion of those that hide their Masters money in the earth
(for such have grieved his righteous Spirit) which will be too heavy for them
to bear in the end. Read the parable, and again I say be ye warned, and while
ye have time prize it before it be too late. Remember Esau, who after he had
despised his Birthright, sought it carefully with tears, but there was no
place found for his repentance: And do not think it will be sufficient for you
to deny bowing unto the Images and Idols of the Nation, while ye live openly in
the same abominations of those which went before, for the voice says, Be ye
separated, and touch no unclean thing, and I will accept you, says the Lord,
which the Light of Christ Jesus in you search whether it be not so as I say,
and have said, in every particular, and let Judgment pass upon the head of the
transgressor in you, that the oppressed Seed of God may go free to Reign and
Rule over you and in you for ever; for Sion is to be redeemed by Judgment, and
her Converts with righteousness; and the Prophet said, He would bear the
indignation of the Lord, because he had sinned against him. Therefore give up
freely to the judgment, that ye may reap righteousness, for God has said,
that judgment shall be given for a Light to the people, and truly the
judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether, for by them is thy
servant forewarned. I call Heaven and earth to record this day, That you are
truly and faithfully warned to fly, and escape the evil to come, and life and
death is set before you, and if ye choose the Light ye shall live, for the Light
is the life of men, but if ye refuse to be guided by it, then darkness shall be
your habitation for ever; for a true Jubilee and release is tendered unto you of
the Lord, freedom from bondage and corruption within and and without; and if
ye reject this glorious freedom, even freedom from your old master, which is
sin and Satan, then hear ye the word of the Lord, ye shall be boared through
the ear, and be made to serve your old Master for ever; not one jot or tittle
of this which is here written shall pass away unfulfilled, be it with you or
against you, I shall be clear of your blood before the Lord for ever, and God
will be Justified, and glorified in all, Even in them which believe, and in
them which perish. Think not that going unto the Temple once or twice a week,
and there to hear what a man has studied in his own will and time will serve
turn, nay, nor yet the taking of David's words and singing of them, who was a
man of a true penitent heart before the Lord, who fasted, cried and mourned
because of his transgressions, and watered his Couch with his tears, yea, and
so abhorred all workers of iniquity, that he said, He would not keep a liar in
his house; which is far wide from your state, who take his words, and say you
are not puffed in mind, you have no scornful eye, and you have fasted until one
may number your bones, and you have roared for the disquietnesse of your
hearts; and are you not a company of liars, and offer a sacrifice of lies unto
the Lord? And do you not think the Lord will Judge you for these things? Yea
verily; do you not read, That all liars shall be cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, and no liars can enter into the holy habitation and rest of God?
Consider these things, and lay them to heart, and put away lying out of your
mouths, as you desire to be accepted of God, and no longer say you Sing to the
praise and glory of God, and the comfort of your own souls, when your Singing
is to the dishonor of God, such sacrifices are an abomination unto the Lord:
But whosoever comes before him, though never so simple, Yet if he have clean
hands, and a pure heart, even he who speaks the truth from his heart, shall and
will be accepted of him, for it is truth in the inward part God only delights
in, without which there is no acceptance: Were not they condemned of the Lord
by the Prophet, Who came before him as his people did, and heard his word, and
it was unto them as a very lovely song, yet (their hearts being after their
covetousness) availed them nothing? and you never yet came so far as this, to
wit, to delight to hear the word of the Lord, which is like a fire and a Hammer
as has been said; but instead of it ye call the letter the Word, whereas the
letter says, Christ is the Word, yet if you were come to hear the word of God
and do it not, all would avail you nothing: And you to take Bread and give it
one to another, and call it a Sacrament, which word you have no where in the
Scripture, neither was such a thing ever commanded to Drunkards, Swearers,
Liars and the like, but to those who in faithfulness of heart had forsaken all
to follow Christ; he brake bread amongst them, and gave it them as a sign of
his true Body, and bad them do it in remembrance of him until he came, and
when the substance came again amongst them, there was no more need of any
outward shadow or figure, which thing they did really witness shortly after;
but you are breaking bread all the days of your lives, and never witness him
come, as they did, Even the second time without sin unto Salvation, who are
pleading for sin as long as you live; and Paul in his first Epistle to the
Corinthians, speaks unto them of it, who did also abuse it; and therefore in
his next Epistle he tells them, and bids them, Try and prove themselves, if
Christ were not in them, they were reprobates. So read with moderation and
consider, If all were reprobates who did not witness Christ in them, little
will it avail you to take bread and wine, and eat it in imitation of what
Christ did to his Disciples, which thing was neither commanded them, nor any
who live in sin; but the true followers of the lamb did, and do show forth the
Lords death, in eating and drinking, and in all their actions, and their
moderation appears unto all men, which shows forth both his death and life
in them; So they brake their bread from house to house with singleness of
heart, which is the thing the Lord delights in above all sacrifice
whatsoever; and such came to witness Christ in them to be their life, and all
in all, and this witnessing (in deed and in truth) is a true regenerate state,
and Christians life, which is more then to talk, or taking a little water and
sprinkling it upon the face of a child, and say it is a seal of the Covenant,
and an entrance into the Church; which is but a Popish trick and invention to
deceive the hearts of the simple, feeding them with a name, but not of the
nature, which thing has been sufficiently spoken of already: Neither is there
any one example in the Scripture for such practice. Search, and so read, and
consider what you are a doing, for it is high time, for of a truth the mighty
and terrible day of the Lord is at hand, Wherein all shall be judged according
to the deeds done in the body, whether good or evil: Therefore be ye awakened,
and repent, and think not that a man or Minister, made in the will of men, that
can preach unto you about an hours space by the hour glass once or twice a
week, will serve your turn; which thing is a stink and a shame to all who are
true Christians, and shows plainly that such have not the unlimited Spirit of
God, which cannot be limited to a glass, time, or place, but speaks in whom
he will, where he will, and as long as he will. And this was the true order
amongst the Saints in their assemblies, not to quench the Spirit of God, but
the Spirit of the Prophets were subject unto the Prophets; so that if any thing
was revealed to one that sat by, the first was to hold his peace; and they
might all Prophecy one by one, and were not forbidden, that all might be
edified, and did not maintain an hireling to speak unto them about an hour;
and if any were moved to speak in that time, to call it a disturbance and
insolence, nay, nay, in these your fruits and practices you have not so much as
a form of godliness, much less the power, as you your selves confess; you
have not the Spirit of God, which is the power in all the true Christians, and
was the fruits and effects of the true living Faith, without which they could
not please God, even the Faith which lays hold on the promise of the Father,
which is that the holy Spirit, even the comforter should come unto them, which
should lead them into all truth, and show them things to come. And this does
all come to witness, who come to know the only one and true Baptism, which
is by one Spirit baptized into one body, which does not only serve to the
washing away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience
toward God, even purified from dead works, whereby they come to serve and
worship the living God in Spirit and in truth, and such only does he seek to
worship him.

So come away out of all the beggarly Elements (which are to perish in the
using) to serve the Lord in newness of mind, without which all your profession
and Religion is but in vain, for then, and not till then will ye come to
witness a bridle to your tongue, which bridle ye must come to witness in you,
even the light which condemns you for every idle word and action, and all the
works of the flesh, which are these, envy, pride, malice, covetousness,
whoredom, railing, backbiting, evil speaking, drunkenness, gluttony,
uncleanness, and all uncharitableness; and they who do such things shall not
inherit the Kingdom of God, Gal. 5.19. Therefore go ye not forth, for the
Kingdom of Heaven is in you, says Christ; and as you come to give up to his
pure Light, you will be levened into its own nature, and so be made partakers
of it, which consists not in word, but in power, holiness, peace and joy in
the Holy Ghost; which is the desire of my soul that you (even my Countrymen)
may be made partakers of, that ye may witness your conversation to be in
Heaven, and be no longer sayers, but doers of the pure holy will of God, that
ye may partake of the everlasting blessing, which the Lord has prepared for
all who fear him, even such everlasting happiness as ear has not heard,
neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive the unspeakable glory
which he has in store for such who give and offer their bodies as living
sacrifices, daily to do his will in; For truly the sufferings of this present
world, are not worthy to be compared to the glory, which is, and shall be
revealed in all such: And this I do not speak because another has spoken it,
but by true and daily experience, through sufferings I have found and felt: And
I say, that ye may partake of the same (with me) in this the day of Gods
eternal power, is the simple desire of my heart to God for you, and I know if
ye reject not his loving mercy and counsel which is freely tendered unto you, in
and through me, ye shall not come short of the good things of God, for the Lord
has showed it unto me. Therefore come away and give up to God, and crowned
shall ye be by him for ever, which is a word of eternal truth unto you all; In
his house there are many mansions, and if it were not so, I would not say it,
my soul has richly fed thereon: Therefore I, through the Spirit of my Father,
invite you, that we may all come to feed at one table together, and that ye may
no longer feed at the table of the Devil.

Therefore embrace and accept Gods love, that ye may eat of the banquet which
is prepared, and that God has sent me forth to invite you to; O make not any
excuse, least ye be rejected and not found worthy, there is yet entertainment
and room to spare, and if ye refuse, others shall be constrained to come in,
even those who stand in the high ways and hedges, and ye be shut out for
evermore with the foolish Virgins; but be ye wise and watch, that ye may have
your Lamps trimmed, that when the cry is made at midnight ye may enter in with
the Bride, so will ye be found worthy to eat and drink at his table, of his own
spiritual food, even of his own body, and drink of his own blood, and will
witness life in you, life I say immortal, and will be leavened into his own
nature, even into a new lump, and so you being many will come to be one bread,
and will be built up together, a spiritual house holy and accepted, where the
Lord will take delight to dwell, and make his abode for evermore; and this
only is the true blessed state, which my Soul desires ye may come to witness
in deed, and in truth, who am a true lover of all Souls.

A Word unto you who call your selves the Ministers of Christ.
IS it not a shame unto you who call your selves by the name of the Ministers
of Christ to preach by an hour-glasse, and pray by a book? does not this
clearly and plainly manifest you are not Ministers of Christ, nor of the
Spirit, who do thus? where have you any example in Scripture for these things
done by the Saints? who were Ministers of the Spirit, and not of the Letter,
who said they were not Ministers of the Letter, but you would so have it, and
limit the holy Spirit of God, as your practices are seen to do, that limit it
to an hours time, and place, and so long it should speak, and no longer; O take
shame upon your selves for these things, and Repent, and cease from deceiving
the people with your vain customs and traditions, and taking money of the
people for so doing, which they, or any who can but read may do as well as
you, to take a weeks time or thereabout to study or compact a company of words
together, even as many as you can well speak in an hours time, part you steal
out of the Scriptures, and another part out of other men's writings, and add
your own meanings unto them, and so boast of other men's lines made ready unto
your hands, and have not the word from the Lord, but steal it from your
Neighbor: Therefore the hand and arm of the Almighty is against you, and will
lay your shame, nakedness, and deceit, open unto all people, that they may no
longer be deceived by you: Did not the Apostles (who were true teachers of God)
speak as the Spirit of God gave them utterance, and sung with the Spirit, and
with understanding, and prayed with the Spirit, and with understanding? and can
any be said to be true Ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ but such? Oh!
how has the day of the Lord over taken you as a thief in the night? wherein
your deeds of darkness are made manifest and discovered, and ye found not to
be savers, but deceivers of Souls, being such who teach for Doctrine your own
inventions and traditions, and so the peoples fear toward God is taught by the
traditions of men, as Christ said; and if any one be moved of the Lord to speak
to you or the people, while you are in your high places, you are the first
which will cry to the people to take him away; was this the Apostles example,
who bid, if any thing was revealed unto him which sat by, the first was to
hold his peace? or is it not the example and practice of the persecuting
spirit, whose works and deeds are wrought in the dark, and are afraid that the
light should reprove them? How can ye say unto your hearers and followers as
the Apostles and Ministers of Christ did, Be ye followers of us as we are of
Christ? whose examples condemns yours every way, for he said unto his
Disciples; that they should be hated of all men for his name sake, and
persecuted, and cast out of the Synagogues, and the like; see and try if your
fruit be not like unto those who cast out, and not like unto those who were
cast out: And the Apostle said the man of God should not strike, but be humble,
and should in meekness instruct those which did oppose him; this was the fruit
and practice of the true ministers of Jesus Christ, who in all things walked
for to be good examples to others, bearing their faithful witness against all
sin, and said, that no unclean thing could enter into the kingdom of Heaven,
and bid people walk as they had them for an example; but you instead of bearing
witness against all sin, tell people that they cannot but commit sin as long as
they live, and you your selves being examples of pride to them and
immoderation, maintaining your wives and children in pride and wantonness,
settling your selves in such and such places, as may make best for your
maintenance, and the like, which shows plainly you are not like Christ nor
his Ministers who went about seeking those that were lost, being such that were
cast in prisons, in persecution, in hunger, in cold, in want, and in distress,
and all for the good of others; in these did the true Ministers of Christ
glory, and did not get into a place, and there settle themselves at their own
will to preach to this or that people, but as the Lord did send and direct them
they were to go, whether in life or in death, bond, or prison, yea, woe were to
them if they did not do it; and again, they preached to the people nothing but
what they had seen, tasted, and had handled of the word of life, and that only
did they minister unto others; but if you should preach nothing but what you
did witness in this nature (which every true Minister of Christ ought to do)
and no more, then you might stop your mouths, and indeed until then it would
be a thousand fold better for you so to do; for your condemnation would not be
so great if you did not presume thus to teach the people the knowledge of God
and his holy ways, but did sit down and labor with your own hands for your
livings; for of a truth you do but add to your condemnation in this state you
are in, as your fruits manifest to your faces: Can you look upon your
assemblies and not blush, and be ashamed to see the fruits of your ministry in
pride, lust and ambition? dressed more like antiques, than sober moral men, full
of vain talk, and foolish jesting, swearing, lying, and all manner of vice is
to be found amongst them, even amongst your constant hearers, whom you call
Reformers of Religion; but what they are reformed from (in nature) let the pure
light of Christ Jesus judge in all their consciences, as it does for God
against them and you; and I am sure it shows that they differ nothing in
nature from the common practice of the Nation, but rather through them and
their ungodly practices, cause the good way of God to be evil spoken of.

And this, O ye Priests, is the manifest and evident fruits of your work and
labor; but the free and true ministry of Christ Jesus was for the perfecting
of the Saints, and the edifying of the body, until they all come to a perfect
man, into the measure and stature of the fullness of Christ, who was and is
head of their body, unto which no corrupt nor profane member can be joined;
and thus your ministry differs from the true, yea, even as much as light from
darkness; the one teaches and leads out of all sin, and the other teaches
that there can never be a freedom from sin in this li e, though the Apostle
said, ye being made free from sin became the servants of righteousness, for
while ye were servants unto sin ye were free from righteousness, so there was
the fruits and effects of the true ministry, and the fruits and effects of the
ministry of Satan is so far from this, that they preach up sin for term of
life, as has been spoken of already.

Therefore, O ye Priests, be ye warned of the Lord God of life, and cease thus
from deluding the people, and let him that stole steal no more, but rather let
him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he might have
to give to him that needs.

And this is counsel of life unto you all, O ye Protestant Priests in France, I
say, cease from stealing other men's words and making merchandise of them to
others, but come to the light your selves, that ye may hear and learn of Christ
your selves, and then if he pleases to send any of you forth to open the blind
eyes, and turn the people from darkness to light, and from Satan's power to
God, then obey his voice, and go forth freely, and preach as he has given you
freely, so will ye profit the people, though this manner of call will be
contrary to your own wills, and against men's wills ye come to preach to; and
till you come to witness this only holy and true call, I say again, and again,
as from the Lord God of life, cease and be still, and let the people alone,
until the Lord send laborers amongst them, for the Vineyard is only his to
send into it to labor who he only will appoint thereto, and he which goes and
is not sent, is but a thief and a robber; which is the word of the Lord God
unto all Priests of this Nation.

Therefore cease, cease and repent, that ye may find mercy, for the blood of
one man if it be laid to your charg, will be too heavy for you to bear, which
assuredly ye must for many, if ye refuse to hearken unto the counsel of God,
which he in the infiniteness of his love tendereth unto you, for know the end
of the true Ministry is to bring people unto God, and on him alone to wait for
teaching, which is his Covenant and promise to bring people to be sensible of
the gift of the holy Spirit of God in themselves; and the Apostle said, every
man has a manifestation of the Spirit given to him to profit withal, which
being turned unto to profit, is a sufficient teacher of it self, and such need
not man's teaching any more, and so people come to know their bodies to be the
Temples of God through the Spirit which dwells in them, and so they come to
bring forth the fruits of the Spirit, which are love, meekness, long-suffering,
patience, and the true reconciliation by Christ Jesus between God and man, the
enmity being slain upon the Cross, and of twain one new man is witnessed,
and so peace comes to be witnessed with God, and not before, and until the new
creature be witnessed all avails nothing; but the true and everlasting
Ministry of Christ Jesus brings the creature unto this, and none else, by
which and in which the creature comes to bring forth naturally the fruits of
the Spirit, as he did the fruits of the flesh before, which was nothing else
but lust and uncleanness, and filthiness of life: So give up to be taught by
him in this the day of his Almighty power.

Therefore let this be a warning unto all Priests, Let God alone with his own
work, for he needs no man's wisdom to help him, for the best of your stuff
you have is but compacted with your own natural wisdom, which you must all
loose, before you can come to know God, For man by wisdom knows not God,
neither can the natural man discern the things of the Spirit, for they are
spiritually discerned; therefore ye must all come to the teachings of the
Spirit of God your selves, before you can come to teach others. These things
are plain and manifest unto every one who is not wilfully blind, and drunk
with prejudice; therefore consider, Paul had more to lose of this kind then
most of you have, yet he said he counted it gain to lose it all to gain
Christ; and let him be your example, who reasoned not with flesh and blood, but
immediately obeyed the Heavenly voice. I speak this unto you in love, and some
of you the Lord may make Instruments in his glorious work in this the day of
his power, if ye reject not his loving counsel, and visitation of love, which
to you is tendered in particular, O ye Priests of this Nation, to whom this is
sent: But if ye reject his counsel, and will have none of his reproof, then
hear what the Spirit of the Lord says, the Lord will make you examples of his
wrath above many; and that is a word of truth unto you all, that ye may truly
be warned and repent before it be too late. And I warn you as from the Lord
God of Heaven and earth, that ye be not Instruments of stopping this from
passing amongst the people, by rejecting it or casting an odium upon it,
thereby to incense the peoples minds against the truth of God, and things that
do belong to your peace, which if you do, better were it that a millstone were
hanged about your necks, and you cast into the midst of the Sea, then you
should hinder the least from receiving this testimony, for Gods dreadful and
terrible day is at hand, in which he will render to every one according to the
fruits of his own doings, both Priests and people, for every one shall give an
account of himself to God, and every one shall die for his own iniquity.
Therefore again, and again I say be ye warned; and if ye Priests, or any of
you shall hearden your hearts against this visitation of love from the Lord
which is sent amongst you, by esteeming that you are the true Ministers of
Christ, and the spiritual weaponed men, then come forth openly into the field,
and make it appear, by answering the Queries which are propounded unto you in
this book, that ye may through it come to understand, and the truth may yet be
made further manifest in the eyes of all: And this proffer do not slight least
the people grow jealous of you; but this I say in love to your immortal souls,
happy will ye be if ye receive the love of God in it, and submit unto his holy
will, and receive his counsel, and be advised betimes, for the fruits of your
Ministry does testify to your faces, that it is not of God, for if it were, it
would turn the people from the evil of their ways, and from Satan to God: My
little children, says Paul, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be
formed in you; Mark the words, and consider them, Christ was to be formed in
them; and this was the true Saints and Christians life to witness him to rule
and Reign in them, for says Paul I live, yet not I, but Christ in me; so in
the Saints was the only hope of their glory, and without this, all are without
the true hope, and God in this world, which is the unregenerate state, where
the new birth and creature is not witnessed nor known, but are captives unto
sin, and Satan, lust and uncleanness; but where Christ is witnessed the body
is dead because of sin, and the spirit is life because of righteousness: And
blessed are they who witness this in deed and in truth; such are the true
Israelites in whom there is no guile, which the Lord of glory delights in, but
abhors all fair sayers and not doers, such shall have their portion with
the hypocrites and unbeleevers for ever; but whosoever hears the sayings of
the Lord and does them, he is like unto a wise man which built and founded his
house upon a Rock, which the storms could not move; and they are Heirs of
happiness for evermore, (world without end) Crowned with the faithful for
ever; Many are called, but few are chosen, even only those who are faithful;
therefore I say again (through the Spirit) blessed and happy are they world
without end: And that many of you might come to enjoy this eternal blessed and
happy end, I could lay down my life were it required of me. Consider, will a
call save you? nay: Therefore consider what will it avail you, to gain the
whole world, and lose your own souls for the transitory pleasures of this
fading world: O let it never be, but embrace mercy while it is freely tendered
unto you, and ye will enjoy an incorruptible Crown, which the Lord has in
store for all who forsake all corruptible things for his sake. And these are
words and counsel of life unto you all, which springs from the true fountain
of life and love, which you will come to witness.

And truly friends, there is no life but through death, nor no Crown but
through the Cross, nor no victory but through War and tribulation of the Lamb:
And consider the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world; and the
world is set in man's heart, And the whole world lies in wickedness, says the
Apostle, for it is in you the Lamb is slain, even in spiritual Sodom and
Egypt: Behold a Mystery, read and consider, spiritually called Sodom and
Egypt, even idleness and fulness of bread, and adultery, and the like, and
this crucifieth the just in you daily; and if ever you turn to the Light of
Christ in you, you will witness my words to be true, and will come to mourn
over him whom we have pierced, even as a man mourns over his only begotten
son; for truly until you come here, ye remain guilty of the blood of the Son
of God, and all mankind upon the face of the whole earth.

And these few words was I moved of the Lord to write unto you, that ye may
consider well your state, and read within your selves with the Light, whether
it be so, or no* So God Almighty open and pierce through your understandings,
that ye may perfectly come to see and comprehend with all Saints, what is the
mystery and love of God in Christ Jesus, concerning you and all mankind; which
is the true desire of him who is ready to lay down his life for his vilest
enemies. And seriously consider, whether the world stands not yet whole in you,
which is truly to be destroyed, even by fire, as truly as the old was by water,
and until this be witnessed, the just in you suffers, for it is the just
that suffers by the unjust in the particular, as well as in the general.
Ponder these things well, and truly weigh them, and the just in you will answer
to my words, from whence they come, and to what end they are spoken; and so
will ye find mercy, and not till then, profess what ye will, for except ye
witness Christ risen in you, all Preaching and Profession is in vain
whatsoever. These are perfect and true sayings, and will stand a witness
against you for ever if ye reject them; for if you will or dare come to your
trial, it will be manifestly proved that you are not the true and faithful
Ministers of Jesus Christ, neither by Call, Maintenance, nor manner of
worship, as Preaching, Praying, or Singing, Baptism or any other thing, which
is used or taught by you, or amongst you, neither have you any part of it by
command or example in the Scripture of truth; therefore it lies upon you, to
show who were your first authors and examples for all the customs and
traditions you have amongst you, singing one part of David's Psalms with your
hats off, and reading another part with your hats on, and putting them in
Meeter like Ballads, by which means people come to sing that which they never
came to witness, as has been before spoken of; and your Sacraments, and such
like, which ye have not one word in the Scripture for. Therefore come forth and
show openly who were the first inventers of these things, reading over a
company of Chapters when you come together, and the like; all these things
(when they and you come to be weighed in the Balance of the Sanctuary) will be
found too light, and far short of the true worship of God, who is not to be
worshipped any other way then in Spirit and in Truth; and in that one Spirit,
if any had a Psalm or Hymn, or Prayer, or Praises, he did it, and sung it to
the praise and true glory of God; and this was the true order of the Saints,
and not to take another man's words for Psalm, or Praise, or Prayer, and say it
over, nay these things are an abominable abomination unto the Lord, for it is
the Spirit only which makes intercession for the true children and servants
of God, for it alone knows our wants, and is many times poured forth unto the
Lord with sighs and groans which cannot be uttered, and this only, and such
like Sacrifices does God accept; not for Drunkards, Swearers, Liars, and all
manner of unclean persons to take the Saints words in their mouths, and come
before him with them, Gods soul abhors it. So all that ever is practiced
amongst you will be found to be but in sin, your Apostatizing and falling away
from the true faith, which was prophesied both by Christ and his Apostles
should come, for says Christ, The night comes, wherein no man can work, in
which time (because of iniquity) the love of many shall wax cold: And this is
the fruits and marks of that day, and Paul saw them coming in his time, even
those who should teach things they ought not for filthy lucres sake, yea, and
before his decease so grievous was the falling away, that he said all Asia was
turned from him: and also to Timothy he prophesied of these things plainly,
that men should heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and
should not endure sound Doctrine, and the like, which ye may see in the many
teachers come up, and made by, and in the will of men, according to their own
lust; which answers unto Christ's word, who said many should come and say Lo
here is Christ, or Lo, he is there, believe them not says Christ, for the
Kingdom of Heaven is within you: Mark, and such shall deceive the very Elect
if it were possible, but it is impossible to deceive them, for such are Christ's
sheep, who know his voice, and a stranger they will not follow: But says
Christ, Ye shall know them by their fruits; so by their fruits must we try them
now, for such teachers as men do heap up to themselves are seen in the light,
which tries your Priests, who preach up sin and lust as long as men live; so
here you are tried and found to be such who are chose in men's will; but Christ's
sheep hear his voice, and obey it, and follow him, who leads into all purity
and holiness. And thus are all distinguished and known by their fruits, as
Christ has said* we should therefore consider these things, and lay them to
heart, and repent before it be too late: This word does the Lord often put in
my heart toward you, for dreadful and terrible is the day which is already
dawned over your heads. The voice of the true Shepherd says Come, Come freely,
without money and without price, and let him that hears come, and let him
that is a thirst come, and whosoever will let him take of the water of life
freely; and let him that will, buy Wine and Milk without money and without
price. Why will ye spend your money for that which is not bread, and your
labor for that which satisfies not? Incline your ears, and your Souls shall
live, and your Souls shall delight themselves in fatness. This is the voice of
the true Shepherd to all the inhabitants of the Earth, therefore whilst it is
said to day, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, but away all to the
fountain which is freely set open to wash away sin and transgression, for you
have all forsaken the fountain of living waters, and have hewn out Cisterns,
broken Cisterns that hold no water; says the Lord, every one is gone astray
after the imagination of his own heart; and the Lord has looked down from his
holy habitation, and beheld there is none that seeks after him amongst the
sons of men, who are thus degenerated from him; for though he has created man
upright, yet he has found out many inventions, (one thing being neglected) by
which means he is become more strange to his Creator than the Ox to his owner,
or the Ass to his masters crib.

Sad and deplorable estate miserable man is fallen into, running on greedily in
the way of destruction, and drinking in iniquity as the Ox drinks water, and
yet will seem to lean upon the Lord, and say, is not the Lord amongst us?
though they forsake him, and refuse his tender reproofs, and cast his holy Law
behind their backs, and will none of his reproof, and make unto themselves
Laws, Statutes, and ordinances, which will suit most unto their lusts, and heap
up to themselves teachers, having itching ears, even such as they make in
their own will, who preach for hire, and divine for money, which was always an
abominable thing unto the Lord, who sent his holy servants and Prophets to cry
against such things; yet do the sons of men delight to have it so: And such
teachers as these cry, peace, peace, to the wicked, and say no evil shall come
upon them so long as they put into their mouths, but otherwise suddenly prepare
war against you, as the trial will manifest the same; and they with great
swelling words of vanity promise to others liberty, while they themselves are
servants unto corruption; and such like do people choose unto themselves,
because they prophecy smooth things unto them, and under their teachings they
can live as they list, in pride, covetousness, wantonness, and all manner of
evil all the days of their lives, as their fruits manifest, telling people
they cannot but sin as long as they live; by which means (instead of turning
people from their wickedness) they strengthen their hands in it, which shows
plainly they are such who ran when the Lord never sent them, therefore they do
not profit the people at all, who are ever learning of them but never able to
come unto the knowledge of the truth, which makes free all who come unto it, as
says Christ Jesus, if you know the truth, the truth shall make you free. And
the Apostles were sent to turn people from darkness to light, and from Satan's
power to God, which was the effect of the true and free Ministry of Christ,
even to open the blind eyes, and make blind those which could see. So they who
come to be turned from Satan's power unto God, come to be turned from darkness
to light, which is a turning from sin to righteousness, and here the people
come to be profited; but such hirelings who run and are not sent, they neither
bring the people to the light, nor from sin to righteousness, being Ministers
of darkness themselves, and Preach for filthy lucre sake, and do in no wise
profit the people; as I have said, if one come amongst them and their hearers,
and do but declare, and speak of those things unto them wherewith Christ Jesus
has enlightened him, then presently they fall upon him commonly by the command
of their Priests, and cry out he is a deceiver, away with him, though they have
nothing to be deceived of but sin, and uncleanness; which shows plainly they
are not of the number of the Elect of God, for they need not to fear being
deceived, for it is impossible to deceive them, For Christ's sheep hear his
voice, and knows it, and a stranger will they not follow: But these, like
blind men, instead of trying all things, and holding fast that which is good,
stop their ears, and furiously run themselves upon a poor simple innocent man,
who seeks not theirs, but them: And this their fruits manifests they are not in
the nature of the true Christians, but of the Jews, who persecuted the
Prophets, and stoned them who were sent unto them; and in this nature do they
sing, pray, and the like, which is no more accepted of the Lord, Then if they
cut off a Dogs neck, or offer a sacrifice of blood, for such was Cains
sacrifice, who was of the envious one, who slew his brother. And this is the
fruits and effects of the hirelings Ministry, which is a grief unto the
upright in heart to see: And behold, how poor people are kept in bondage, and
from the knowledge of God by them, hearing and learning from their youth up,
until they go to the grave, and still in sin, and pleading for it as long as
they live.

O people, it is high time to awake and consider these things, and lay them to
heart, for the Ax of the Lord is a laying to the root of every tree, And every
tree that brings not forth good fruit, shall be cut down and cast into the
fire, for the Lord has long born with you, and men have conceived naught but
vanity, and brought forth lies, and every one is striving either by deceit or
policy, to uphold his own way by the arm of flesh, and he that can get the
power into his hand, oppresses all who will not bow unto his manner or form
of worship, as though God were served in man's will, or could or would be
limited by the sons of men, while every one is crying up his own way to be
best, while they are all in the way of sin, pleading for it as long as they
live. The Lords soul abhors these things, for it is only the sacrifice of
clean hands and a pure heart which he accepts, even of such who are of an
humble and contrite spirit, and trembles at his Word, and such he will in no
wise despise: But how far men are from this spirit (which is only accepted of
by the Lord) let the pure Light of Christ Jesus judge in all your consciences;
does not envy reign still in their hearts, and where that reigns there is
strife, and every evil work, which seperateth man from God; and in this state
should they sacrifice thousands of Rams, and ten thousand rivers of Oil, the
fruit of their bodies for the sins of their souls, it would avail them
nothing: But wash you, make you clean, says the Lord; and put away the evil of
your doings; relieve the fatherless and the widow, and I will accept you; and
though your sins are as red as scarlet, yet will I make them as white as snow.
Says Solomon, he which confesses and forsakes his sin shall find mercy, and
it is certain that none else does, or ever shall, for the sacrifices of the
wicked are an abomination unto the pure God: For when the Jews were in the
observation of sacrifices, Sabbaths, New Mons, and the like, the Lord said
they were an abomination, and loathsomness unto him, and his soul did abhor
them, and the reason was because of the evil of their doings, for in such
things the Lord delights not; but a body which is prepared to do his will in,
is only accepted, for there he only takes delight to dwell, which is more then
all sacrifices, offerings and oblations, which David knew right well: But this
thing Satan and his Ministers Preach not to the people, that he may keep his
seat whole within them; profess what they will in words he matters it not, for
he knows if once the creature comes to the Covenant of God, that then he will
come to witness his body to be his Temple, as he has promised, I will dwell
in them and walk in them; therefore Satan strives every way to keep people from
the light which is the Covenant, whereby men would come to know the teachings
of God, and would not need that man should teach them: But this makes not for
the hireling, nor his profit, therefore would he be Master as much as in him
lies, telling people they must not look for God to speak unto men in these
days, and that revelations are ceased, and such like stuff he fills up his
hours time with, which shows he and his hearers know not the Son of God as
the true Christians did: And says Christ, unto those that come unto me I give
eternal life; and none has eternal life but those who know the Father, and
Jesus Christ whom he has sent.

So all Priests and people this is to you, and shows that you are from the
true Faith, and to every good work reprobate, for he that does not witness all
his works done and wrought in him by the virtue and power of God, all his works
are but as filthy rags, which is self righteousness, for if the just do not
work in the creature, it is self, which can never be accepted of the Father,
for the true children of God came to witness that God did all their works for
them and in them, and so did witness in deed and in truth, the Lord to be
their righteousness, and were called by that name. So come and try your works,
and by whom they are wrought in you, if not by Christ, then it is self, and so
it will avail you nothing, For without me (says Christ) ye can do nothing: I
am the Vine (says Christ) and ye are the branches, and my Father is the
husbandman, and every branch which brings not forth fruit, my Father cutteth
it off, and casts it into the fire, but every branch which brings forth
fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more abundantly; so abide in me
(says he) the light of the world, for in him only is their fruit found to be
accepted. So read, try, and consider in whom ye are, and whether ye are in the
true Vine, yea, or nay; if not, your state is miserable, and ye are yet in your
sins.

Therefore cease from your hireling teachers, and learn of Christ the pure
light in you, and you will come to witness a teacher continually with you,
Which will never be removed into a corner any more; but your ear shall hear a
voice behind you, saying, this is the way, walk in it, turn neither to the
right hand, nor to the left; which if once witnessed ye will abhor all hireling
teachers for ever; and being come to know the voice of the true Shepherd of
your souls, ye will witness the pure holy teachings of the holy God, lying
down and rising up, directing you in the pure, holy, and undefiled path of
peace, in which no Lions whelp can tread; and this to witness is the end of
all Ministrations, Types, and shadows whatsoever, the life and substance being
witnessed in you, even Christ Jesus the Light, the Covenant of God, which is
given a Covenant of Light unto all Nations, that he might be his Salvation unto
the ends of the earth; which is the only true Cistern that is able to hold
water for your souls. And John did bear witness in like manner of him, saying,
He was the true light which enlightened every one that came into the world, and
the light is the life of men; and as you come to the light you will witness it
so, and not before ye know his life to abide in you, which light being received
and followed, you will receive power to become the sons of God, even a birth
which is not of man, nor of the will of man, but of God, which only is loved;
so the sons of God you will witness to be, and his holy Spirit you will be
lead by, For as many as are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God, and
they who have not the Spirit of Christ are none of his: Therefore I say again,
and again, try whose ye are, for if you have not the Spirit of Christ, you are
none of the sons of God, but of the Devil. These are true and plain words unto
you all, that ye may not be any longer deceived, nor trust to lying vanities
any longer, and forsake your own mercies, which is freely tendered unto you of
the Lord in this the day of his love, wherein he does invite you freely, to
come unto him, Without money and without pride, that ye may eat and drink, and
be satisfied at the Rivers of his pleasures; and not to spend your labor and
precious time for naught, for your time is but short, and the measure of your
iniquity is even up (amongst the sons of men,) and the Angel of his wrath is
even ready to smite. Therefore be ye separated and touch no unclean thing, and
God Almighty will accept you; for verily I have seen the wrath of the Lord
breaking forth against this Nation, and it was very terrible: Therefore stand
not (as you love your immortal souls) to contend about words, or any outward
thing; but come to the light, that ye may witness life, that so your covering
may only be the pure Spirit of the Lord, thereby to have a hiding place in him,
else the sword of his indignation and wrath you will never be able to escape,
but it will cut you off for ever, with all the unclean and uncircumcised of the
earth. Therefore be ye not mockers nor despisers, least ye perish, for the Lord
is working a work in these days, that such cannot believe, though it were told
them; and this is a true warning, and testimony of Gods everlasting love, in
and through one that is a witness thereof, and a friend to all souls.

And now, that you may read and seriously consider, into what a sad state you
are fallen, (from the Image of him that created you) is the desire of my heart,
and come for to be restored again into the same dominion, for all are
degenerated into the plant of a strange Vine, bringing forth wild fruit,
contrary to the expectation of the good husbandman, and to the grieving of his
righteous soul; for read and consider, He planted a Vineyard, and fenced it
about, and pruned it, and cast the stones out of it, and expected it should
bring forth fruit, (as I have said,) but it brought forth wild fruit; what
could I have done more for my Vineyard? says the Lord. Here all the sons of
men may consider their condition, which is truly sad and miserable; though they
are so settled upon the Lees of iniquity, that they do not consider it; as it is
written, There is none that understands, there is none that seeks God, they
are all gone out of the way, they have been made altogether unprofitable, there
is none that does good, no not one, their throat is an open sepulcher, they
have used their tongues to deceit, the poison of aspes is under their lips,
Romans 3.11. Yea they commit iniquity with greediness, (even as the Ox drinks
in water) their table is full of vomit, and there is no soundness in them,
they conceive mischief in the night upon their bed, and rise early in the
morning to put it in practice, and say in their hearts, the Lord sees us not,
our mouths are our own, who shall us control? they lie in wait privily for
the innocent, and lay a snare in secret for him. O! what a sad and doleful
condition are the sons of men fallen into! yea there is no fear of God before
their eyes, Eating and drinking and rising up to play; marrying and giving in
marriage, and all in the lust and uncleanness; the seed of the evil one being
head in them, naught but pride and oppression is brought forth, envy and
malice, yea the best of men is but a liar every one seeking by fraud and deceit
to exalt his own horn, and seeking to maintain his own carkase in great honor
and dignity, and he which is stronger then his neighbor will take all
advantages against him to bring him under him, and to bow to his will. O woeful
state and hard to be declared is the degeneration of fallen man from his
Creator, who at first created him in his own Image and likeness, in holiness
and purity to reign over all the works of his hands (in the power and wisdom
of his Creator) and had put all things in subjection under him, and knew the
right use of every thing, (he standing in the dominion and wisdom of God) and
to what end they were created, even for them to serve his body, and his body to
serve his soul, and his soul to serve his Creator in the body, and as he thus
stood in the fear, dominion, and wisdom of his Lord, all things were blessed
unto him, and all things were clean and pure; and being guided by the pure holy
Spirit of his maker, is counseled as in the beginning, and has a lawgiver as
at the first; but when once he gave ear unto the voice of the Serpent (who was
more subtle than any beast of the field) consented to eat of that which was
forbidden him (that he should not touch to eat) even of the tree of knowledge
of good and evil; let him which reads understand, he had liberty to eat of
every tree but that, all being good, and that also, for all that which God made
was good and blessed, but for food it was not to be eaten of nor touched: And
as I said, when man once had transgressed the righteous Law of his Creator, he
lost his glorious Dominion he had, and the pure Spirit of the Lord (by which he
was covered) departed from him, so that he was naked without a covering, then
shame entered in upon him, and so he went to make unto himself other coverings
(then those which he had in the beginning) to hide himself, but all in vain: So
all the professors in the world who are not covered with the holy Spirit of the
Lord, may read, and see what they are doing; for this is truly your state and
condition, feeding upon your own knowledge which is forbidden, and feeding
thereon are thereby set on work to make unto your selves other coverings then
that of the holy Spirit of truth and righteousness: So read and consider, when
Adam had once done so, the Lord cast him out of his Garden, and he lost his
dominion which he had, and God placed Cherubins at Eden gate, which turned
every way to keep the way of the tree of life, so that men could never enter
again that way, but through death, even the death of that nature and wisdom
which he fed on, which was of the earth, and is earthly, sensual and devilish:
So read and consider, whether you witness this, yea or nay. And so man being
drove out of the earth, the curse entered, and the Serpent became head in him;
and he that was the son of God before, and was guided by him in all his
actions, became the son and servant of the Devil, and a bondslave unto
corruption; and thus was the Lamb slain, even the just seed of God became
oppressed in him, even as a Cart that is loaded with sheaves, which before bore
rule in him wholly; yet the Lord having regard to the works of his hands, and
his bowels being moved with pity toward them, his mercy being over all the
works of his hands, took not his holy seed from him, but made a Covenant with
man, that the seed of the woman should bruise the Serpents head, which was
become head in man then, which promise was witnessed and fulfilled in Abel, who
was righteous and was accepted, the seed of God bearing rule in him, and the
seed of the envious one was bruised, which reigned in his brother Cain, and so
being one with the holy seed became a sufferer, and suffered by the seed of the
evil one in his brother; and here was the first persecution, and from that day
unto this has the just suffered by the unjust, the seed of the Bondwoman
persecuting the seed of the freewoman, which kept the Commandments of God. So
here all men may read and see what stock and generation they are of, and what
seed is head in them, for one of the two bears rule in every individual man
upon the face of the whole earth; where the seed of the woman is head there is
peace, humility, meekness, long-suffering, patience, temperance, love to all,
bearing, and forbearing, praying for enemies, and suffering and enduring all
things, not having confidence in the arm of flesh, nor yet a helper in the
earth, not seeking revenge, but commits its innocent cause to God, knowing
that vengeance belongs only to him, praying for enemies, doing good to those
that despitefully use them; and this, and this only is the life of the true
christian, for in him alone this holy seed of God bears rule, and has
dominion, for they are the peacemakers; but where the seed of the Serpent
bears rule there lust reigns, from whence comes all war, strife,
contention, and debate; and this was Cains nature, even to kill and murder, who
was a Vagabond drove from God, yet he built him a City, and called it by the
name of his son, and so from this stock has risen oppression and murder, and
getting of possession in the earth; and this was the fruit and effect of that
seed which from him sprung, for which cause the holy Spirit of God was grieved
from day to day, until it had repented him at the heart that he had made man,
which caused Noah to preach unto them righteousness, but they rejected his
counsel, and would not be warned, but they continued eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, all in the lust and unclean nature, which
crucified the just, and so continued until the day of wrathful unresistable
vengeance and flood of Gods indignation brake out upon them: And thus in all
ages have those in whom this seed of enmity has borne rule provoked the holy
God to wrath against them, yet he forbore with them until they had filled up
their measure of iniquity, in which time he sent his holy servants the Prophets
to warn and forewarn them of the wrath which was due unto the transgressors,
and still as they did reject the council of the Lord, and his tender reproofs,
they felt his heavy hand in the end, for he has said, his Spirit shall not
always strive with man; though men may (as they did then) seek by their own
strength, policy and wisdom, to build them a Tower to reach up unto Heaven;
but God confounded their design, for neither by that way nor by that means
could they ever bring their purpose to pass; and from that stock came and
sprung all the divisions upon the face of the earth, one building this thing,
and the other that thing, and all in the confusion, being confounded and
dispersed in their understandings by the wise God; though vain man may think by
such means to build him a Tower to reach up to Heaven, but such are the
thieves and the robbers which climb up another way then Christ spoke of, who
came not in by the door which is the light, the only and alone true way to
God, and there is not another; but men are so hardened, and their
understandings so darkened through the deceitfulness of sin, that though these
things are plainly written and spoken of in the Scriptures, yet they cannot
perceive them, the book being become to them a book that is sealed, which one
took and gave another to read and said, I pray thee read it, and he said, I
cannot, for it is sealed, and he gave it to another, and said, I pray thee read
it, and he said I cannot, for I am unlearned; so to learned and unlearned it is
a mystery: And truly I freely declare unto all the sons of men that there is
none that can open the seals thereof, neither is there any found worthy in
Heaven or in Earth, but Christ Jesus the Lamb of God, the Light of the World,
who has enlightened every one which comes into the World; and till men come to
give up to be led, guided, and directed by this pure Light in all their words
and actions, the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, nor godliness they will
never come to know nor understand, for the vail is over their hearts, and until
it be rent and taken away by the power and virtue of the Light, they run on as
the Jews do in darkness, and know not at what they stumble, for though the
mystery of godliness be great, yet it is but one to all and in all, either Jew
or Gentile, even God manifest in the flesh, the Emanuel, God with us, even with
men and in men, and this is the Mystery of Mysteries which the Apostle said,
has been hid from ages and generations, which was Christ in them the hope of
their glory; and without this be witnessed, there is neither true hope nor true
glory; though men talk of hope, yet it is but the Hypocrites hope, which
perishes, and will never bring them to glory, no farther then the earthly,
which is but grief and vexation of spirit; but he that has, and is truly
possessed with the true and living hope abiding in him, purifieth himself even
as Christ is pure, even from all earthly affections, either of glory, honor,
or riches, wisdom, or any other earthly thing, being given up in all things to
seek the true honor and glory which comes from God only, though for so doing
he may, and is accounted a fool, poor and simple, and rejected by those who
possess only the false hope, who seek the riches, honor and praise of the
Kings and Princes of this world, which are the manifest fruits and effects of
their hope. And thus is Christ become the true riches of the soul, and the
creatures glory, whereby he comes to tread all other things under his feet, and
counts them but as dross and dung in comparison to it.

So here all may prove and try their hope by its manifest and apparent
opperations, in brief, the one hoping this and that power will be the chiefest,
that they may have access unto it to maintain their Church and Religion, and
the other desiring that God only may have, and take the dominion, and that he
alone may rule and reign, because he knows it is in God, and the gates of
Hell can never prevail against it; therefore matters not, nor fears any outward
strength, because his strength and hope is in God alone, who purifies and makes
clean all who hope and put their trust in him, by the power of his own seed in
them, (to rule and reign) which bruiseth the seed and head of the Serpent for
ever, and conquers the last enemy; and such only come to witness the true and
living birth which is of God, which sins not, and comes to be restored into
the same glorious state and condition as Adam was in before he fell.

And this is the substance of all words, and also it is the end of Christ's
ministering, even to bring people unto this, by which they come to know (as I
have said) the promise of God fulfilled, to wit, the seed of the woman to
bruise the Serpents head, and their bodies to be Temples and habitations of God
through the Spirit, and he to live and walk in them, as he has promised; but
the ministry of Satan is to preach up sin as long as men live, by which means
he may keep his Kingdom, for he has no other Kingdom but it. Therefore let
men profess what they will in word, he matters not as long as he has his
Dominion in their hearts, and his head unbruised there, where he sits as
God, even in the Temple of God; and this is the abomination of desolation
amongst the sons of men, which is to be made desolate in this the day of Gods
Almighty power, in which the mystery of the Man of sin shall be fully revealed
and made manifest, and the Kingdom of the most High shall be established with
men and in them: And this great and glorious work shall not be by might, nor by
force of men, but by the arm and Spirit of the Almighty God, whose power shall
be evidently made manifest to free and set at liberty the sons of men from the
bonds of sin and corruption, that they may no longer be Satan's bondslaves; I
say all such shall come to witness this who shall cleave to the Lord with
sincerity of heart, in this the day of his gracious love unto the sons and
daughters of men; but those that reject his love, and will none of his reproof,
shall witness and also feel his power in wrath and dreadful vengeance, who
will assuredly render unto them according to their deeds, and so much the more
as they have slighted the day of their visitation, and rather believed Satan
and his messengers, that his power is greater to keep them in sin and bondage,
than Gods was to deliver them, though the Scripture it self (which they seem to
profess) bears witness against them: And the Apostles Ministry was to open
the blind eyes, and to turn people from darkness to light, and from Satan's
power unto God; and they who believe in this Ministry and receive it in the
love thereof, they come perfectly to know (as they are turned from darkness,
which is the power of Satan, unto light which is the power of God) and witness
in deed and in truth the power of God greater to deliver from sin, than Satan's
power is to keep in sin; therefore the unbeliever and Satan and his Ministers
shall all be taken and cast into the lake of Brimstone and Fire, and be
tormented for ever and ever; and the little stone which is cut out of the
mountain without hands shall become a great mountain, and cover the whole earth
for ever, and shall grind all his enemies to powder, for God Almighty has
determined it, and his Decree is unalterable.

Therefore, O thou Nation of France in particular, I warn thee as one whom God
has warned and constrained so to do, that thou stand not in the stubbornness
of thy heart against the Lord and his Anointed in this the day of his power,
but submit unto him by repentance and forsaking of thy sins, that thou may
find mercy, else he will tear thee in pieces, and none shall be able to
deliver thee out of his hands; which is his eternal word unto you all:
Therefore lay it to heart, and while you have time prize it, before it be too
late. And know ye Protestants, that it is only the true Jew which shall have
acceptance in his presence in that day, even they who are of the circumcision
of the heart, who are covered with his holy Spirit, and not with a name to
live, and are dead, as it is with you at this day: Therefore this visitation of
love is sent amongst you, that you may read and consider your condition, and
how you stand, that ye may not plead ignorance in the dreadful day of account,
which is even at the door; and remember, If God spared not the natural
branches, but cut them off who sinned, he will not spare you, for the soul that
sins shall dye, but he that turns from his sins, and does righteousness,
shall live; and there is no other Covenant or promise of God then this.
Therefore let not your Preachers deceive you any longer, by telling you, it
shall go well with you, though you live in sin and uncleanness; but turn to
the light of Christ which condemns you for all sin, and give up to be guided
by it, and it will lead you to forsake your sins, so will you find mercy, else
you will perish eternally* which is the word of the Lord unto you all;
therefore I say again, and again, prize Gods love which is freely tendered unto
you; For a famine of the word of the Lord has been amongst men, and the vision
has failed, which has been the cause people have perished, even because of
ignorance: Therefore come to Christ the light, the wisdom of God, that you may
learn only of him, and receive wisdom of him, who makes all them truly wise
unto Salvation who come unto him and hear him, so then their souls come to
live, and not before. And take not this as an idle tale or story, for though my
message is not adorned with enticing words of man's wisdom, or as man's wisdom
teaches, yet know assuredly, that if ye reject it, it will be your
condemnation, and you will be left without excuse; as I said, If God spared not
the natural branches (when they sinned) even they who were once truly grafted
into the true Olive Tree, surely he will not spare you, who were never yet
grafted into any thing but sin and corruption, as plainly appears by your
fruits of lightness, vanity, and vain glory, and the deportment both of you and
your women, who go in plaited hair, and in gold and silver, which was never
the ornament of the holy women of God, nor of Sarah, but their ornament was
that of the heart, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is with
the Lord of great price, and is only accepted of God; and your own habit is
nothing differing from all the vain and abominable in your Nation, which the
true Christians were not to do, nor fashion themselves according to the former
time of ignorance, but were to be renewed in their minds, and to be careful in
all things, and to walk answerable according to the holy calling wherewith
Christ Jesus had called them, who had left them a pure example, that they
should follow his steps. And says the Apostle, Be ye followers of me, as I am
of Christ: But how ye do those things, let the pure, just principle of the Lord
Jesus Christ judge in all your consciences: Were you truly what you profess
your selves to be in words, would ye not be a witness against all the vanities
and wickedness of the Nation, and bear your witness for God against it all? and
so would be a sweet savor unto the Lord in your generation, even as lights
which are set on a hill: But instead of this ye are one with them in all manner
of evil whatsoever, only you differ in some external things in your worship,
seeming to cry against Idolatry, and covetousness is in your hearts, which is
as great Idolatry as can be named; and if you should speak against respecting
of persons, you are as much in it as they, and as partial in all your ways,
and any other abomination which is committed in the land, may be as commonly
seen and heard amongst you, as amongst any other people in the Nation, as
swearing, lying, vain talk, and foolish jesting, whoring, and whatsoever that
may be named, pride, and vain custom, and the like, and for a cover for all
this, you say you are saved by grace; for shame, shame, shame, cover your
faces, Are any saved by grace who are taught by it to deny all ungodliness and
worldly lust, and to live soberly and righteously in this present evil world,
and does not? who live in wickeedness, and turn the Grace of God into
wantonness, or rather turn from it; has not the free grace of God appeared
unto all unto Salvation, as well as unto you? as if a bear talk of being saved
by grace would serve turn; why may not all be saved as well as you, seeing your
fruit differs nothing in substance? and then you say you are saved by faith
in Christ Jesus, but vain men show your faith by your works, for if it be the
living Faith, which gives victory over sin, the other may also be brought into
it by good works, which are the effects of the only true and living Faith, and
so be converted unto it and be saved; but your profession without a possession
does but add the more unto your condemnation, as you shall witness except ye
repent; for if only a saying you believe in Christ Jesus will save you, why may
not those you esteem different from you, be saved as well as you, seeing they
will in the particular say it, and affirm it as well as you, and both your
fruits (in respect of life and conversation) vary nothing at all. Read and
consider these things seriously, and repent, knowing that as the body without
the spirit is dead, so is Faith without works also dead.

Again I say in love and pity to your immortal souls, prize, prize Gods eternal
love which is freely tendered unto you all, least you cry when it is too late,
Oh how have I slighted the day of my visitation? and it be said of you as it
was of Israel of old, Oh Israel thou have destroyed thy self; for it is only
the sins of a people or Nation which separateth them from God, and brings
judgments upon them or any Land, that the inhabitants may learn righteousness;
but if they refuse to be warned thereby, and harden their necks, then will the
Lord sweep them away with the Bosom of destruction: Therefore lay it to heart,
for the sins of this land has surpassed the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, who
were made examples of Gods just judgments, that others might take warning.

Therefore my bowels is truly moved in me toward you, that you may not slight
the day of your visitation, but diligently hearken to the Lord, which if you
do, he will soon subdue all your enemies for you, and make you to shine (as his
own elect and chosen people) as the Stars in the Firmament, and many shall
desire to be joined unto you; yea the day hastneth apace, That ten shall lay
hold of h m which is a Jew, and say we will eat our own bread, and drink our
own drink, only let us be called by thy name; yea, this and much more, which is
hard to be uttered either by tongue or Pen, shall be the portion of him who is
of the true circumcision, which is made without hands, who worships God in the
Spirit, a City and habitation is prepared for them, whose builder and maker is
God, wherein the Lamb shall be their Light, and they shall walk in it for ever
and ever. Therefore come all away to the light, which is the true door into the
new and Heavenly Jerusalem, wherein no unclean thing can or ever shall enter
thereby; by the light must ye come to be cleansed, which is the blood of the
Covenant, which is freely shed abroad for the cleansing of all the sons of
Adam, therefore trample it not under your feet, as the blood of a dead man, and
count it not an unholy thing, for by it alone were all the Saints of old
cleansed, and it did not serve them only to talk of, but were truly purged,
purified, and made clean by it, and so witnessed Justification and
Sanctification in this life, without which they never could; for except you
come to witness your souls cleansed from sin, and sanctified with the blood of
the everlasting Covenant, you cannot be justified by God, for God justifies no
unclean thing, and remember it is written, That without holiness, no man shall
see the Lord; and lay it to heart, and there ponder these things in the cool
of the day, which if you do, The grace of God will not be bestowed upon you in
vain, but through its pure teachings and virtue you will come to witness
salvation to your souls, and death swallowed up in victory, and he that has
the power of it, which is the Devil; then will that saying be brought to pass,
O death where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? and will thank God
with your souls, bodies, and spirits, and serve him therewith, as holy vessels
sanctified to his use, who has given you the victory over all; and living
praise will issue out of your mouths, not by constraint, but willingly out of a
pure heart for evermore, to the living praise of him, who has redeemed your
souls out of the horrible pit, and set your feet upon a Rock, even upon Mount
Sion, to live and Reign for ever: And this is the true Salvation of God through
Christ Jesus, which thousands witness at this day in England, and praise the
Lord with one heart, mind and soul continually, which is their only joy and
delight, God only being witnessed to be their Judge, King, and Lawgiver, who
has saved them with everlasting Salvation from sin and uncleanness, and are
translated into the Kingdom of his dear Son, and there live and delight only to
walk to the praise and glory of the glorious God of all grace, who has thus
bestowed his rich grace and mercy upon them; which also is freely and richly
tendered unto you, O ye inhabitants of France, therefore slight it not, but draw
nigh unto God, and he will draw unto you, for he is a God at hand (and not afar
off) even unto them who call upon him with a simple heart, and is a ready help
unto such in time of need; and you will witness him so unto you if ye embrace
the riches of his grace, mercy and goodness, which is freely tendered to every
individual of you without respect of persons; Therefore call upon the Lord
while he is near, least when you call he will not answer, which is counsel of
life unto you all, which if you reject, then hear what the Spirit says, ye
shall have your portions with the wicked, stiff-necked, unbelievers, and
rebellious, and your children shall enjoy the blessing, for God of a truth will
be glorified in many of them, and you also, if ye count not your selves
unworthy of Eternal life, which is richly, and plentifully tendered unto you.
Therefore cease from all your Idol-shepherds and hireling-Priests, which feed
themselves and not the flock, preach up sin as long as men live, which shows
they are imperfect Ministers, and cannot make the comers thereunto perfect;
therefore I say cease from them in time, least while the blind lead the blind
ye both fall into the ditch, for they are truly the Ministers of Satan, and
preach up his power to be greater than the power of God, even to have more
force to keep people in sin, then the power of God has to redeem from sin, (as
has already been said,) and so make the coming of Christ to be of no effect,
which was to redeem people from the Law (which was added because of
transgression) up to God to live in his power, which was before transgression
was; therefore (says the Apostle) in what the Law could not do, in that it
was weak, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, to condemn
sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us,
who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit: Mark, this was the true end
of Christ's coming, not to destroy the Law, because the Law is righteous, and
lays hold on the transgressor; but he came to destroy the transgressions, and
so he redeems all who come unto him, from the curse of the Law, by destroying
the works of the Devil in people, that so the righteousness thereof might be
fulfilled in them by the power of Christ Jesus, and so they come to the Spirits
of just men made perfect, the seed of the Serpent being bruised and wholly
destroyed in them by Christ the seed of God, in whom all the promises are Yea,
and Amen; and they who witness this witness the end of Christ's coming, and
the new birth which is incorruptible of God, which sins not, and they who
come to witness this, know that the power of Satan is not greater then the
power of God in Christ Jesus, who saves his people from their sins; and this is
the only true living Ministry, which is to the salvation of the soul, and all
who preach any other doctrine then this, (though we our selves or an Angel from
heaven) let them be accursed; therefore consider your doctrine who preach
against perfection, and for keeping men in sin as long as they live, and then
the Devil knows he has them sure enough afterward, for the wages of sin is
death, out of which there is no redemption if the creature dye therein, for as
the tree falls so it lies: And this is the truth of God to all the inhabitants
of the Earth; therefore high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, be ye
warned, and while ye have time prize it; and if ye call upon God (who without
respect of persons judges according to every man's work) pass the time of your
sojourning here in fear, and redeem the time for the days are evil, and work
out your salvation with fear and trembling, which if ye do ye shall be
everlastingly blessed in the end, which is the word of the Lord God of Heaven
and Earth unto you all: Therefore while you have time prize it; this word does
the Lord often put into my heart unto you; for the dreadful day of his fierce
unresistable wrath is nigh at hand, in which he will destroy all workers of
iniquity from off the earth, root and branch for ever, and to that man will he
look, who is of a humble and contrite heart, and trembles at his word, and
only such shall obtain favor of him in that his dreadful day, and controversy
with all Nations; therefore is he sending, and has sent his dear and precious
Lambs and Servants forth to warn them, that they may repent and find mercy,
least his vengeance overtake them, and that they may be lest without excuse;
and for this cause is this warning sent unto you, O ye Protestants and
inhabitants in France, that ye may also be warned to fly the wrath which is
even at the door, for your measure of iniquity is even full, and hastneth apace
the finishing: Therefore be awakened and warned, that ye may find favor with
him, who will not judge according to your persons, but in righteous judgment
will he judge you, even from the King that sits upon the Throne, unto the
slave that grindeth at the mill, and neither money nor favor shall be able to
deliver any; therefore that ye may repent and find mercy is the true and
faithful desire of my soul to the Lord for you my Contrymen, whom the Lord
has warned to warn you, and has showed me (his silly worm) the evil and the
good which shall surely come upon you; who in love and faithfulness to God and
your Souls has not concealed it from you (whether you do embrace, or reject
his love and counsel, which is freely tendered unto you) that so in the day of
account, with my Maker I may be found clear of your blood, and the blood of all
men, which if I had, it would be too heavy for me to bear, for the Lord would
require it at my hands, who has called me from a far country, where I was an
inhabitant about fourteen years, until this work was laid on me, to visit you
Protestants in, and about Paris; but ye rejected me and despised me, and would
not permit me to declare my message of love unto you, which was from the Lord,
and not my own, in testimony of which I was ready to seal it with my blood; but
seeing ye would not receive it from the Lord, who called me from the Indians in
America to minister and serve the Indians elsewhere in his truth and gospel, I
shall be clear of your blood for ever; and at my return from Paris, the Lord
laid it upon me to write this testimony unto you, before he would suffer me to
go out of your Nation, and happy will ye be if ye receive it, but if ye
wilfully reject it (as ye did me, and contemned my person) then woe will come
upon you from the Lord God of Heaven and Earth for evermore: Therefore
Contrymen, I beseech you in the bowels of endless and unfeigned love for
ever, in, and with the same the Lord has loved me, to lay it to heart, for my
God is a consuming fire, who will not in any wise condemn the innocent, nor
acquit the guilty, for with him alone dwells equity and justice, which is the
habitation of his Throne for ever, which you shall be made partakers of, who
turn to him, and peace shall never depart out of your habitation. Let this
thing be considered by all who love their souls, for what will it avail you to
win the whole world, and lose your own souls? is there any thing below the Sun
but what is vanity and vexation of Spirit, and must come to an end? nay, verily
there is not; therefore spend not your precious time any longer in taking care
what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, or what you shall put on, for all
these things such seek after who know not God; but cast your care upon God, who
will care for you, if ye come to walk, and live in his holy fear, and seek not
honor one of another, but only that honor which comes from him, so will ye
honor him, and he will make you truly honorable in the midst of a rebellious
and stiffnecked people; and seek not to lay up treasures on earth, but first
seek ye the Kingdom of Heaven, and all things which are needful for you shall
be added unto you, for if the Lord takes care for the birds of the air, how
much more will he take care for those who put their trust and confidence in
him? therefore spend not your time in chambering and wantonness, neither make
provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof, for the lust warreth
against the soul; but be ye sober and watch, for the day of the Lord will come
upon you as a thief in the night, and he will call you to an account of your
stewardship, and how you have spent his money, for every one has a
manifestation of the spirit given him to profit withal, which he must give an
account to his Lord of, for that is the talent, and woe be to him that has not
been faithful to improve it, but the diligent hand makes rich, and he which
has been faithful to a little shall be made ruler over much; so consider
seriously how you spend your time, and whose money you are improving, and to
what use you put it to, for accordingly shall your reward be: Therefore
Friends, as in the sight of the living God in whom I live, and serve with my
Spirit, I am very plain with you, recommending my self to every man's conscience
in the sight of God, that I have not hid the counsel of God from you, so far as
he has made it manifest to me concerning you, neither have I gone to heal your
hurt deceitfully, nor sowed pillars under your arm-holes, nor daubed you with
untempered mortar, as the false prophets do, crying peace, peace to the wicked;
but as the Lord has showed me the sword of his wrath, which is ready to be
sheathed in the bowels of the wicked, I have in faithfulness warned you of it,
that ye might escape it, by turning from the evil of your ways, for by no
other way or means can you possibly escape it; therefore let not me be counted
your enemy for telling you the truth, knowing that the reproof of a friend is
better than the kiss of an enemy, and an open reproof is better than secret
love; therefore says David, Let the righteous smite me, and it shall be as an
ointment upon my head, and you will also witness it so upon yours, if ye come
and submit unto David's humble spirit of prayer and repentance, which was the
cause God did so delight in him above many, for the humble and contrite spirit
(which David was of) God will in no wise despise, for he even confessed his sin
and forsook it, and willingly submitted unto the judgments of the Most High
for it, by which means he had acceptance with God, And thy word (says he) I
have hid in my heart, that I may not sin against thee; for that is the daily
care of the honest heart, least God should take his holy spirit from him, for
he prays continually that God would renew his daily countenance upon him,
which made David's heart more glad than those who had all the increase of the
earth; so all you who take David's words to sing and talk of, deal faithfully
with your own souls, and see whether you are come to his spirit, yea, or nay,
and until then his word and penitent heart is your condemnation, which you
shall eternally witness to be true in the day that by David's spirit ye shall
be judged, who said, depart from me all ye that do wickedly; and was made the
song of the drunkard.

Truly Friends, the Lord has made my bowels as an open fountain toward you,
that you may no longer be of that generation which Solomon speaks of, who are
pure in their own eyes, and yet are not purged from their iniquity: I shall as
being truly moved of the Lord thereunto, lay these following things before you
to consider seriously of, as being things which every one who dare profess the
name of Christ and Christianity, ought truly to mind, to the end they may not
be only Christians in name but in nature, which will only stand you instead in
the dreadful day of judgment, wherein God will appear with flames of fire, to
render vengeance to the wicked, which day hastneth apace.

Therefore read and consider, Whether Christ Jesus, when he spoke unto his
Disciples, saying, Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is
perfect, did not speak really as he meant? And whether he would bid them be
that which was impossible for them to be?

Secondly, Read through the whole Scripture, and see if you can read of any
other Salvation but that which is from sin; And whether or no, that was not the
promise of God unto Adam after he had sinned, to wit, that the seed of the
woman should bruise the Serpents head, which seed was Christ? And whether this
is not to be witnessed in every regenerate man, or woman, yea, or nay? And
whether the Serpent be not head in all until this be witnessed, yea, or nay?
For seeing the Scripture says, we are saved by faith in Christ, whether is
there any true faith which saves, but that which gives true and perfect
dominion over all sin? And whether there be any other true faith which
justifies before God? And whether this faith only be not the true faith of
Gods Elect, seeing the Scripture says, that God justifies not the ungodly,
showing that no unclean thing is justified before God? And can any in truth say
that they are justified, but those who witness this faith, by which the just
lives and obtains victory, yea, or nay?

Whether the free grace of God has not appeared unto all men? And whether all
those who receive it, and are taught by it, are not led and taught to deny all
ungodly lusts? And whether they who are not thus taught by it, are not of those
who turn it into wantonness? And whether it will not be their eternal
condemnation, yea, or nay?

Whether Christ according to John's true and faithful testimony which he bare of
him, has not enlightened every man which comes into the world? And whether
this Light does not judge righteously for God, against all sin in the
consciences of all men? And whether if they reject its reproofs, it will not be
their condemnation, yea, or nay? And whether God has not so promised, that he
would give Christ his only son for a Covenant of Light, that he might be his
salvation even to the ends of the Earth? And whether any ever came to witness
salvation, but those that thus witnessed Christ a Covenant of Light to be their
leader and teacher, yea, or nay?

Whether God has not promised that in his new and everlasting Covenant all his
people shall be taught of him? And whether those who are yet looking at man for
teaching be not out of this pure holy Covenant, yea, or nay?

Whether God has not promised that he will live and walk in his people? And
whether they who do not witness it, even their bodies to be the Temples of
God, be not the Temples of the Devil, yea, or nay?

Whether any are, or can truly be said to be the sons of God, but those who are
led by the Spirit of God? And whether any are true Christians, but those who
have put on Christ, yea, or nay?

Whether any are Christ's, but those who have the Spirit of Christ? And whether
any can witness the true Baptism, but such who have received the Spirit, yea,
or nay?

Whether there be any other Baptism needful unto Salvation but this, to wit,
by one Spirit into one body, by the Holy Ghost, and by fire? And whether all
other sprinklings are nothing but traditions of men, yea, or nay?

Whether the true Christians did not come to witness Christ in this life to be
wisdom, justification, and redemption, yea, or nay?

Whether Christ in the Saints was not the only hope of their glory, even to
live in them as he did in God, and through which they came to have fellowship
with the Father? And whether they who came to witness this were not sanctified
throughout in body, soul, and spirit, yea, or nay?

Whether Christ did not give himself for his Church, that he might purge and
sanctify it, and present it to the Father without spot or wrinkle, or any such
thing? And whether any can come to be true members of this Church, but those
who come to witness a true purging in this life, seeing the Scripture says,
the Church is in God, to whom no unclean thing can be united? And whether all
who say they are members of the Church of Christ, and do not witness this, to
wit, a cleansing, be not liars, yea, or nay?

Whether the true Ministers of Christ Jesus do not preach freely, as they have
received freely? And whether they who preach for hire, gifts and rewards, or
yearly maintenance, are not Ministers of Satan, yea, or nay?

Whether any can be truly said to be the Ministers of Christ Jesus, but who are
sent by him, and called immediately by his voice unto his work? And whether all
others are not of man, and by the will of man, who run and are not sent, yea,
or nay?

Whether such men who say they can never be freed, nor put off the body of sin
as long as they live, be not Ministers of Satan? And whether they in effect do
not prefer the power of Satan to be greater to keep people in sin, than the
power of Christ is to redeem and set at liberty from sin, yea, or nay?

Whether the Cross of Christ be not the power of God unto Salvation to every
one who believes, through which all who live in it come to be crucified to the
world, and the world to them? And whether any be true Disciples of of Christ,
but those who witness it, and bear it daily about with them, and follow
Christ, taking him for their perfect example in all things, yea, or nay?
Whether do not they who are true Ministers of Christ, turn people from
darkness to light, and from Satan's power to God? And whether are not they who
are so turned come to witness that which was before Satan's power was, or sin
either, yea, or nay?

Whether does not all true Ministers of Christ Jesus bring people off from man's
teaching and wisdom, unto Christ the wisdom of God and his teaching? And
whether he does not bring them to the Anointing in them, which is the gift of
God, so that they need not man's teaching, yea, or nay? And whether all they are
not Ministers of Satan who Preach and teach otherwise; whose eyes are full of
Adultery, and cannot cease from sin; while they promise to others liberty, they
themselves are not servants unto corruption, yea, or nay? And whether they be
not such of whom the Apostle speaks, Ever learning, and never able to come to
the knowledge of the truth, teaching things they ought not for filthy lucre
sake, who have not the word they speak from the Lord, but seek it every one of
his neighbor, and against whom the Lord is, yea, or nay?

These things being truly of absolute concernment, for every one who sincerely
desires salvation to their immortal souls, to know and be rightly informed
therein; therefore I propound them unto you, to be answered by the heads and
wise amongst you, who seem to be pillars to the rest, that thereby your Priests
and Teachers may manifest themselves, whether they are true Ministers of
Christ, yea, or nay? which will appear by their answer, if they are the
spiritual weaponed men, Who wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with
principalities, and spiritual wickednesses in high places, which captivates the
creature, and keeps him in bondage and corruption; for to no other end are
these propounded unto them, but that truth may appear, and the simple come to
be instructed, and that they may come to be redeemed from the power of their
adversary the Devil, Who goes about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may
devour, and that righteousness and truth may be set up amongst the sons of
men, for God of a truth will be known to be greater in power to deliver his
creature from sin, then the Devil is to keep them in sin; and this work has
the Lord already begun in the earth, and will hasten to finish it for his own
glory sake; for the glory of his renown shall go over all, and his name shall
be dreadful among the heathen, and greatly feared and honored of all them who
put their trust in him, who are and shall be the only blessed for evermore:
But the wicked shall be turned into hell, and all who forget God. Therefore, O
ye Protestants in France to whom these things are sent, I charge you all in the
power and virtue of the living God (who has created the Heavens and the earth,
and as you shall answer it in the dreadful day of account) not to slight these
things, but receive them as they are given forth to you; and if your Priests
shall withstand it, let them answer those plain demands which are propounded in
it, that so Gods eternal truth may stand over all for ever; and let their
answer be sent to any of the people of the Lord called Quakers in England. And
they your Teachers who say they have the charge of your souls, and receive
wages of you under that pretense, I shall yet add this Query unto them for to
answer: What the soul of man is? And as you prize the salvation of your souls,
mind these things, and cease from man in time, whose breath is in his
nostrills, for whereof is he to be accounted? and come all to God alone for
teaching, who has promised to teach his people himself, which is his true
living and everlasting Covenant with his people for ever, which the people in
England called Quakers do witness; glory and immortal praise be unto him for
ever, who has manifested his name, power and glory amongst them as in the days
of old, by which he has struck dread unto their enemies, and set them as a
Signet on the Crown of his head, and has put a new Song in their mouths, even
the Song of Moses and of the Lamb; for he has manifestly overthrown their
enemies in their sight, and will do the like for you, (O ye Protestants and
inhabitants of this Nation) if ye hear and obey his voice in this the day of
his Almighty power; which if ye do, happy, happy, happy will ye be, and your
posterity for evermore; but if ye refuse, then cursed, cursed, cursed will ye
be from his holy pure presence for evermore; which is his eternal word unto you
all; and thus far I shall be clear of your blood if ye perish: Remember Korah,
Dathan, and Abiram, who perished in their gainsaying; and in love and bowels
of pity, I say be ye warned betimes.

Truly friends, I was a man as ye are, subject unto all manner of vanity which
was under the Sun, passing my time in Singing and Music, foolish talking, and
idle jesting, and so was a captive to sin and Satan, until the Lord out of the
boundless riches of grace and mercy toward me, and many more in those remote
parts of the earth where I dwelt (who had as large a talk of Christ and what he
did and suffered at Jerusalem sixteen hundred years since, as any people as
ever yet I came nigh, and could talk of Faith in Christ, and being saved by
grace and the like, while his pure grace was turned from by us, and we in
wantonness, and the grace of God which was freely bestowed upon us was our
condemnation; and in this lost and undone state the Lord) sent one of his
messengers, who declared the way and path of holiness unto us, whose message
was light, and that Christ Jesus had enlightened every one of us with his true
light, which condemned us for sin and evil in our consciences from our youth
up, and if we heeded this light it would lead us up to God, and we should know
him alone to be our teacher: This was the message of glad tidings unto us, and
their feet were beautiful upon the mountains who brought it, and I may truly
say, blessed be the day of their going out with the message of peace in their
mouth for ever, for the witness of God in me answered thereto, and that their
message was true and faithful, for I had that in me which had never consented
to the evil of my ways from my youth up until that day, but was a witness
against me when I did sin against God, and after had brought sorrow upon me,
for my vain and wicked conversation; and after I had believed their report
concerning the holy pure light of Christ (as they told me it came from him and
would lead to him) I witnessed their words to be true, and at this time am
ready to seal to the truth thereof with my blood, if called thereunto of the
Lord; for through it I came to have access to God, and no other way, yet so as
through judgment which laid hold of the transgressor in me, and all that ever
I had done came to be judged by him who sits upon the throne and lives for
evermore: So I came to witness the promise of God in me, that judgment should
rest for a light to the people, for it was so in me, and I heard a voice
saying, This is the way, walk in it, turn neither to the right hand, nor to the
left; so my teacher came to be near me, even in me, and will never be removed
into a corner any more, if diligently heeded and followed, which teacher is the
light of Christ in the conscience, which shined in the darkness in me, though
the darkness could not comprehend it, but as I came to heed it diligently, it
did comprehend all the darkness in me, and for me, and has given me a clear
discovery of all things pertaining to the Mystery of the Kingdom of God, which
are needful unto salvation; and I came to see Pharaoh and his host overturned
which kept the seed of God in bondage in me, and I passed the Red Sea into the
wilderness, where I came to know a sacrifice offered up, which he did accept,
and not before; and then I came to mount Sinai, to the giving forth of the Law,
which was terrible to the flesh, but it was, and is glorious unto me, and will
be for ever, for it laid hold on nothing but on that part which is estranged
from God, wherein I had seen many wonders, and overturning of enemies, yet many
temptations and provocations I had to return into Egypt again, and that I
should never be able to enter the promised Land, the enemies were so great,
which I know all will come to be tempted in like manner who come truly to
travail toward the Land of rest; but to such an one I say, be of good cheer
and courage, for if thy heart be given to God, he will of a truth be with thee
in all thy travails, even to the end thereof, and thy work will be only to keep
in the Faith, and so thou will find thy strength will be to stand still and see
the Salvation of God: For this testimony I faithfully give and bear for the
Lord, that it is he only who does and will subdue all their enemies in and for
them (be they never so many or mighty) who truly put their whole trust and
confidence in his name alone; who is a strong tower in time of need; I say such
shall possess the gates of their enemies, and shall come to witness with me, as
I do at this day, the elder to serve the younger, which is the true work and
promise of God, and the true travail of the seed into the Lord of rest, and
there is no other salvation to be looked for, even the subduing and casting out
of the seed of the bond woman, that the Seed of the free woman (which is Christ
the Son of the most high God, over all blessed for evermore,) may have the
preheminency in the creature; and thus coming out of Egypts darkness, I came
to see that all the teachers in the world made by the will of man, were but
soul-deceivers, for they had not the word from the Lord, neither were they sent
by him, therefore did not they profit the people at all, and were but Babels
builders, one building and another destroying, and all in the confusion, and
the most refined of them were but Ministers of the letter, and not of the
Spirit, boasting of other men's lines made ready unto their hands, serving and
worshipping the works of their own hands, according to the oldnesse of the
letter, and not according to the newness of the Spirit, and teaching them for
Doctrine the traditions of men: And thus are poor people in an expectation of
deliverance and salvation through their teachings, but all in vain, for when
they have heard them all their life time, they tell them they can never be
freed from sin, and yet tell them they are good Christians, though they be
Drunkards, Swearers, Liars, and wicked persons; and this is the fruits of their
Ministry, which all shall witness with me, who come to the one teacher and
Shepherd of the soul, who saves all to the uttermost that come unto him, who
is the light of the world, and enlightneth every one which comes into the
world, who says, Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, who is the
way, the truth, and the life, and he is the door, even the light, for the way
is but one, the truth is but one, which is the light the only way to God, and
there is not another, And no man comes to the Father but by me, says Christ
the light, the door, the way, the life, so none can ever come to God, nor the
way to God, nor the truth, but who comes to the light, wherewith they are
enlightened, which comes from Christ, and condemns all the evil that is in the
creature, and shows a man all that ever he has done; for says the woman of
Samaria, Is not this the Christ who has told me all that ever I have done? So
all likewise who come unto the light they witness with her, and with me, the
same thing; and all who come into subjection unto it, shall come to witness
the wild Colt tamed upon which never man sat, and then and not till then is
Hosannah sung, nor blessed can he ever be who comes in the name of the Lord by
any, until this be fulfilled and witnessed by them and in them; and this only
is the state of a true convert, and true Christian, and is my testimony for the
Lord, which shall stand for ever, whether ye will hear, or forbear: And thus
far have I cleared my conscience toward you, in obedience toward God, and
love to your immortal souls; therefore prize it while ye have time, least the
things which belong to your peace, be hid from your eyes, and a lamentation be
taken up by the just for you, as was over Jerusalem, saying, O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee, as a Hen gathers her
chickins under her wings, and thou would not? Therefore I say again, and
again, lay it to heart, and prize Gods everlasting love unto you all which is
freely tendered unto you, notwithstanding that your sins have surpassed the
measure of many Nations; and remember Nineveh who repented (at Jonahs
preaching) in Sackcloath and ashes, whose sins and abominations never surpassed
yours, which is a word of truth unto you all; therefore take her for an example
and repent in time, least Gods judgments overtake you, for Gods anger is
kindled against the workers of iniquity, he will destroy them from off the face
of the earth, that nothing but holiness may reign for evermore, And the meek
alone shall inherit the earth for ever and ever. And this is the infallible
Decree and purpose of my God, which can never be recalled, but will stand for
ever, and it hastneth to be fulfilled, and he will overthrow Powers, Princes,
Kings and Dominions, even all such as shall oppose, or withstand him in this
his glorious work, whom he will destroy in his fury, and will break them in
pieces: Therefore O ye powers of the earth, down with your Crowns at the feet
of the Lamb, and ye shall find mercy; but if ye resist him, he will grind you
to powder.

And this is the word of the Lord God unto you all, and I shall be innocent
before the Lord God of my life for ever; therefore be awakned, and beware what
you do now ye are warned, for you will be left without excuse if you perish,
and you shall know that you have been warned in time, by one whom the Lord has
truly required so to do, which if I should not, woe, woe, would be unto me for
ever; so I shall lay down my life here in Peace and Rest, and shall rejoice if
ye take warning more then in the treasures of Egypt; who am called by the name
of

Charles Baily.

THE END.
