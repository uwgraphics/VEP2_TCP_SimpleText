The pityfull Histori^ of two loving Italians, Gaulfrido an^ Barnardo le vain:
which arrived in the country of Greece, in the time of the noble Emperor
Vaspasian.

And Translated out of Italian into English meeter by John Drout, of Thauis
Inn Gentleman.

Anno. 1570.

Imprinted at London by Henry Binneman, dwelling in Knightrider street, at the
sign of the Mermayde.



To the gentle Reader. VV. VV.
FRom fancies fond, from fickle pates,
from wandering wits and wild,
Proceeds such vain and foolish toys
as folly has compilde.
For why? the sound of horned Pan
that Faunus liftes on hye,
Is all the music that they can,
no other notes they plye.
Of Phoebus some they favor seek,
some Pallas grace do crave:
And some the sacred Systers aid
do seek and sue to have.
But this (our Drout) yet most in grace,
not seeking glory vain,
Of freendship for his countries sake
has put him self to pain:
To make it known unto this Land
which Gospel does profess,
What godly love with them did stand
which could not God confess.
Such certain shows of friendship true
alas why should they dye?
Why should they not abroad be known
since friendship dead does lie?
A shame it is for Christians, such
as do Christ's name profess
In word and tongue, to babble much
and follow nothing less:
Therefore let Drout tell forth his tale,
and let his story pass,
Let Heathen make the Christian pale,
in whom true freendship was:
Let Momus freat, let Zoylus rail,
the honest will be glad,
When they shall here what honest truth
each one to other had:
And wish that we would do the like,
in word and deed agree,
That of our faithful friendly acts
some work compilde might be:
To give example unto those
that knowledge ours do want,
To shun the ill, the good to choose,
And faithful friendship plant.
This is thy mind, O Drout I know,
this is good purpose thine,
Of friendship true to make a show
in this unfriendly time.
Pass not therefore though Midas prate,
and Assishe judgment give,
For why^ the years of Nestor thrice
thou and thy work shall live.
Finis.
quod VV. VV.

R. VV. To the Reader.
LEt not the foolish carping sort
of Zoylus freat and fume
At him, which for to sit in seat
he does not once presume,
Where Hayvvood sits, and Googe does pour
their thundering verse amayne,
And Studley to, inferior naught
unto the other twain.
If that our Drout does look for praise
he is not to be blamde,
His work deserves no less: if some
(which might full well be namde
In this my muse) should tickle bare,
as does our Aucthor here:
That it were well and princely done
(though rotten were the geere)
Some man would say: but thus much I
dare boldly here affirm
Him worthy praise, if so I may
my simple sentence term:
Good Reader then, even as he has
with good will wrought the same:
So let him have some recompense
of praise for all his pain.
Finis.
quod R. VV.

T. F. To the Reader.
ALthough commonly al men covet news,
As well the learned, as the vulgar train:
Yet diverse things the common sort refuse,
Which to understand they cannot attain.
They therefore which in such case show their zeal,
Declare their good will to their native soil,
Such strange Histories to reveal,
Nothing regarding their labor and toil.
This translator therefore of mere good will,
According as the History does move,
To good effect has showed his learnde skill,
Declaring ensample of steadfast love:
Whereby we may discern as in a glass,
That love unfeigned can not be broken:
As in these two lovers it came to pass,
Whose deeds portende an evident token:
The like in our age seldom seen or found,
The more of all men to be lamented,
Which desire yt true love might so abound,
That vile flattery might be prevented.
Finis.
quod T. F.

T. Smith to the Reader.
Sith every man endeuereth
to get a crown of fame,
By setting forth fine Tragedies
for to augment their name,
Why should not this our aucthor then
(seek for some part of praise)
Which has set forth this pretty Book
for thee thereon to gayse?
Where thou with ease may read the same
which he with cruel toil,
Has turned volumes huge full often,
all for his country soil:
Wherefore (good reader) give to him
some recompense of pain:
For egall labor (men do say)
deserves egall gain.
If that Translation his be not
accounted good to be,
Mine must be called in again
as far as I can see*
But this (our Drout) he has his done
in every point so well,
That for the changing of this speech
he only hears the bell.
The Italians they them selves do love
and daily praise our Drout,
Who has so aptly turnde to verse,
verbatim through out.
If that of men to us unknown
he can get such a praise,
Then ought not we his countrymen
a greater fame to raise?
We ought in deed, but yet we seek
each one to bear a name:
So that the Students young can have
no praise to ease their pain.
But if this Drout be worthy praise
(and as he is in deed)
Seems not but for to give him praise
to pay him for his meede.
Finis.

The Preface to the Reader.
Behold (gentle Reader) how I have depainted and set forth unto thee this
woeful history of two Italians (al for thine ease as I hope) which by thy
diligente reading thou shall find them nothing at all inferior (concerning
true amity) to the two Turtles Titus and Gisippus, and that thou shalt
think them vvorthie to be received into the troop: or to be committed
amongst the crew which are already rehearsed of master Vnderdonne: also I
have as great admiration (as ever he had) what they should be that do not
rejoice to hear of the unspeakable freindshippe and amity which was
between Orestes and Peliades, Theseus and Perithous, Achilles and Patrocles,
Nisus and Eurialus, Castor and Pollux, Damon and Pithias Achates and Aeneas,
Alexander and Ephestio, Celius and Patronius, C. Lelius and Scipio Affricanus,
Darius and Megabisus, and last of all, that be not glad to hear of our
Gaulfrydo and segnior Bernardo, who for true amity may be annexed and
adjoined with the rest. Wherefore (gentle Reader) I considered with my self
that I was one of the most that could do least, for the which cause, I
vvoulde very gladly have yielded up wholy this story (being but lately come
forth) to some other of my acquaintance which might have done it far better
(than possible I have done at this time.) But being in a manner partly coacted
by a special friend of mine (to bewray this my small skill unto thee) I took
it upon me the boldlyer: In hope when as thou should (at thy leisure)
confer the one with the other, then thou vvoldest judge favorably, and
correct friendly: and to say with Terence, that Nihil est iam dictum, quod
non sit dictum prius. Thus leaving of to trouble thee any further, I commit
it to the correction of the learned. Vale.

Read ere thou judge, then judge thy fill*
But judge the best, and mende the ill.
To the right worshipful sir Frauncis Iobson knight, Lieutenant of the Toure,
John Drout wishes long life, with continual felicity.
WHEN AS I had perused and diligently red over this pitiful history, and
sundry times given my whole endeavor to the well markyng of the same (right
worshipful sir) I considered with my self, first how profitable it would
be to those, which be desirous to learn the Italian speech: again pondring
in my mind, how pleasant a thing it is for to read this hidden history,
(which not without little pain) I have translated out of Italian into
English verse, very plainly, for those which shall mean to give their whole
endeavor and industry to the attaining of so pleasant a language. Wherefore
being wholy bent and purposed to have this my simple translation of so
notable a tragedy published: I thought it good for diverse considerations to
bestow this the first fruits of my travel, upon your worship, rather than
upon any other man, first because of the great affection, and continual good
will, which your worship and my good Lady your bedfelovv (which lately
deceased (have borne to my dear parents, vvho^ I pray God long to continue,
and for many more benefits, the which (for breuities sake) I do pretermitte:
for consideration whereof I have the more boldlyer attempted to dedicate this
my little and simple volume to your worship, having a good hope and trust that
you will have me excused for my rude boldness, and accept my good will
herein signified. Thus leaving you, and all yours to the tuition of almighty
God, who increase you with continual worship, grant you long life, with
eternal felicity, I bid you farevvell.

Your worships to command, John Drout.

Galfrido and Bernar(...) le Vain.
NOw boystrous Boreas has left off
his puffing blastes to blow,
Now have the soming seas their will
to ebb or for to flow:
The troubled sayler he does laugh
to see the waves at rest,
The merchant he triumphs for joy,
and thinks the Gods have blessed
Him careful man: whose careful head
is troubled how to keep
Unruly bark of his, from wrack
of such as daily creep
From shore to shore, still practicing
how they might get the gain
Of such things as the merchant he
has woonne with cruel pain.
Does not the theeuishe rouer sport
when he at anchor lies,
Which lately with outrageous cries
his ending day espyes?
Does he not think that Neptune God
has rid him out of thrall?
Or did not that Aeneas vile,
which Captain was of all
The land and goods that Dido queen
was able for to make:
Was he not glad at sudden calmes
(think you) and so to take
His harbor where he might it find,
or where it was assingde
By mighty Gods above, or else
by mother his so kind?
What fearful nations did invade
Achilles woofull wight,
When hushing waves ten in a row
did ouerrunne him quight?
Did he not cut the waters salt
the foming seas apace,
When as the cruel nipping wind
was wholly in his face?
Were not companions his sore to ylde
upon the raging flood?
But when that they arriude to Troy,
then they did think it good
That they had laborde so in storms,
for then in wether clear
They canuas may their biscuit hard,
and tipple up the beer,
Which lay all hard a sennights space,
(as Ovid he does tell:)
So may they tayre their bakon black,
and feed of it full well,
For Sailors they can feed apace
in weather fair or fogge,
And will not stick (in hunger theirs)
to eat a barking dog.
But now each man they may rejoice
that Lady Ver is nere,
Now may they see with glimmering eyes
once Phoebus to appear:
How Estas he with comely grace
full trimly does display,
And how that Tellus floorisheth
through aid of lusty May:
In pleasant month of this (my friends)
each man does joy by kind,
And every man does practice what
were best to please his mind.
As Gaulfrid here (The Italian Books
do show his name to be)
Does seek and search in rotten boats
strange countries for to see.
And coming to the land of Greece,
where Turrets hye do stand,
Where houses shining all of golds
be plast (as well I scande)
By chance, as fortune would it have,
he entered in at one,
Where he found Barnarde le vain
then sitting all alone:
A kinsman and a friend of his,
whom then he did not know:
The Gods them selves (I think forsooth)
they would it should be so.
Gaulfrydo he whose smirking looks
and lively chere at last,
Bewrayde the one the other then
ere four words they had past.
To see the joy of loving friends
when they together met,
Tho Nestors life twice told I had
I should them not forget.
The one imbrast, the other kissed,
they weep for joy in place:
Gaulfrydo could not speak because
all smyred was his face,
With driueling drops of lukewarm tears
which trickled down a pace
His paled face: his friend in deed
as fast did pour again
His dryry tears: incontinent
then said Barnard le vain,
The day has been, O coosin mine,
that friends we have been both,
As we are now (for ought I know
and that we both were loath
The one the other to displease,
as reason wild us so,
Whilst Babes we were, we went to school
together you do know,
What did I ever in my life
whereby that I your foe
Should counted be: or that I have
not been as true to thee
As ever thou or any man
could ever be to me?
Let women's tears exiled be,
say to them all adewe.
Gal. No, no, my freende, of forged tears
I think I have but few,
I would to God that thou had been
but half so true to me,
As I have been in every thing
a royal friend to thee:
Thou would not have hoysed up
thy sails to every wind,
Not knowing I (poor wretched wight)
in what place thee to find:
Nor yet thou would once have left
me in a country rude,
Among the ravening sort of woolues
which sought for to detrude
Me (seely wretch) from country mine,
whereas my mother bore
And kept me, from my cradle young,
(her grief it was the more,)
Ne yet thou would once have made
thy loytering boy to pull
The vdder which does guide the ship,
or else to hall the skull
The which has beaten foming seas
a thousand times twice told,
In Hyems ragged, gagged frosts
when it was bitter cold,
Thou little thoughtest on thy friend
when thou on hatches low
Did sleep thy fill, all for thine ease
it was, that I do know,
All void of care thou wast in pup,
alone there did thou sit
Like prince on throne, the master he
belike did thee permit,
When mates of thine, each one were feign,
to gather on a flock,
Because that surging Seas did rise,
and took them to their cock:
Their little pretty frysking bote
which tottereth up and down,
In hope to find some ease when as
they should espy the town,
Whereas they might have some refuge,
and succor for to save
Their weeried corpse, which only thing
it was that they did crave.
But when that darkened clouds were gone,
and all things else did clear,
Then mate to mate each other calde,
and said, ho mate what cheer?
And if you be all well, and as
I hope you be, with speed
Set up your sails (thus do you say)
to go we had but need?
Then every man does hale and pull
the Halliards all a row:
Behold thy foresayle it is up,
now Auster do thou blow
A huffing gayle: and by and by
because thou woldst be gone,
The foretop and the main top sail
thou placest even anon:
Yet must thou have thy spirit sail out,
all only to be blown,
Thy Myssen yet must not be left
behind, to well is known.
Thy roaring cannons and thy chens
be laid on every side,
Yea bases, foulers, quarter slings
which often has been tried:
Thy Fakens, Taucknets, minions all
a row thou have them laid,
Caleuer and thy hargabus,
which lately has been made
All only for to keep me from
thy rotten Oyster bote,
Though litile I have said (my friend)
full well I could it note.
But for all that, thou see how good
the Gods have been to me,
To let me once approach the coast
where as I might thee see.

Bar. Alas why do thou me suspect
of such a heinous crime,
It was not long of me (in faith)
that I went at this time,
Full sore against my will it was
that I should leave behind
Me, thee, who as a Pithias
continually I find:
It was not the cruel tyrant Turks
which only did us chase,
From all along the fiery Seas
till we did come in place,
Where as a mate of ours did sound
four hundred fadams deep
In brackishe Seas: so at the last
we chanced for to creep
To this same village town, whereas
you found me all alone:
Whereas I have acquayntance small,
not being known of one.
But every day since I came forth
still thought I on thy name,
I thought upon our country rude,
still praying for the same,
Because I knew thy blessed corpse
had there his lodging place,
In hope again that thou woldst look
my Picture on the face,
Which hangs in chamber thine bedeckt,
then would thou have in mind
(I would suppose) Barnarde le vain,
which unto thee did bind
With faith and truth, a loving friend,
and faithful for to be,
So long as that the gods should grant
Osselly mine to see.
No sooner had Aurora come
but up I would me hye
Into the highest place of ship,
and there I would discrie
The tumbling whales, the Dolphins huge
as I in Bark did stand.
If wishes would have then preuaylde
I would have been on land,
At Brownbread crust with Galfrydo,
then for to have the wine
That lay in ship (which Bacchus brewde)
or else the biskets fine.
Thus would I vewe and daily think
that thou would after hye,
Now would I think unto my self
thy ship for to espy.
But all for naught the longer I
did gaze in open air:
The farther still thou wast from me
so much more was my care,
When as I had in memory
our parents that be dead,
Our mothers kind which pampered us
and long ago had fed
Both thee and me with milk so sweet,
then was I like a stone
Then was my heart even like to burst
my senses they were gone,
My lights, my lungs, so vexed were,
that none had thought that I
Should ever have skapt such trimbling fits
but presently should die,
On salt sea floods they minded all,
and purposely were bent,
To hang a warrant on my neck,
and straight for to have sent
Me to the boat that Caron guides,
the ferry man of hell:
For they supposed that I would not
any longer with them dwell.
And yet for all these miseries
that I have waltered in,
To charge me with ungratefulness
me think you do not lin:
But if thou be a friend to me
as thou do say thou art,
Seem not to lay them to my charge,
but let them all depart
Quite from thy heart: behold, these words
he had no sooner spoke,
But for to work him injury
vile fortune does provoke.
Now does she turn her tottering wheel
she looks crabbed sour,
Now does she bend her cursed brows
now does she pout and loure,
Now may you see this fickle dame
the Camelions part to play.
How she will change in sundry forms
a thousand times a day,
How she does play the wether cock
that turns with every wind,
To some she will be foolish stout,
to other some as kind:
O that she can so flatter men
with granting their desire,
And will not suffer them to cleue
to that they do aspire.
To whom in all their life almost
her friendship does she show:
But when he thinks him best of all,
has then his overthrow?
I pray you did she ever yet
advance a man on earth,
Which wholly put his trust on her
had not untimely death?
Has she not taken many men
on hye from glimmering gleame?
Did she not slay king Priams babes
and spoil him of his realm?
Does she not play such pretty prankes
continually with some?
Yes that she does: When that they think
their blessed state is come.
But see the chance that ha^ned now
even in the self same street
Where they did host, two enemies
at that same time did meet,
Who when they saw each other, began
their shiuering blades to draw:
And to be short, the one did thruste
the other through the mawe,
The guts, the lungs, the intrayls all,
but straight away he went
That did the faete: But messengers
immediately were sent
With bilbow blades, and rusty bills,
to bid him come and dine
In gayle, where as perchance he should
find little store of wine
For to digest the weighty boltes.
Thus came they in a route,
Tom with a clubbe, Dicke with a spitte,
two propre men and stout.
They seek as men should look a hare,
to let the greedy hounde,
Have now a snatche, and then a snatche
to bring her to the ground.
But all for naught, they found him not
which only did the fact:
In no place could they him epsy,
but back again they packt,
Where as they saw in myddest of street
Galfrido looking out
From wyndowe hye (who maruelling
what made them so to shoute
And make a noise (with cries so shryll.)
they did him straight epsy,
That he should be the murderer,
some there began to try:
Upon the which, they entered in,
the host they first espyde,
More bones they made not with him there,
both hand, and foot they tied
Him seely man (without offense)
with halters good and strong,
Which fitter were for these same knaves
that did him open wrong:
Then up they do ascend on hye
where as these two did walk,
They meant no gyle, they thought no hurt,
no such thing did they talk,
They took them both, like seely lambs
in arm in arm they went
To prison strong, whereas their Oste
was fully that way bent.
Such comely persons to behold
as they along did go,
Would make a man as hard as flinte
to melt, my self I know:
But for to think what piteous looks
they showed as they went,
Again to see what smiling cheer
the one the other lent,
To see what wondrous changes was
between these troubled three,
Tho that I liude seven hundred years
the like I should not see.
As Soon as they to prison were
committed one by one,
The multitude diminished,
then were they left alone
Among the rustie iangling chains
where vermin does abound
In dungeon deep (where light as yet
some think they have not found)
Where Todes do keep, and adders dwell,
where as with ugly paw
And greedy corpse, the serpent foul
in fetters he does gnaw
The seely soul which is bewrapt
in many tangled snares,
The simple man, whose troubled head
is fixed with many cares:
I think the foul infernal feends
not half so ill do dwell,
Nor they that dwell in Tartar deep
inhabit such a hell.
I think, not Tantal, Pelops son
so cruelly was paynde,
As these same three, the which my muse
already here has faynde:
Nor Titios (in judgment mine)
did ever feel such pain,
Nor he that brought to mountains top
the stone that fell again,
Ne yet the tired Byllices
that hales the buckets twain
In drawing water, which returns,
as Poets they do feign:
Tho Prometheus stands so still
At cruel pinching rack,
With hand and foot beset so wide
till all his bones do crack.
Though these same troubled souls the^selus
such spiteful pain endure,
Yet may they naught at all compare
with these (that I am sure)
For paynefull pangs: but Fame she has
now sounded far and near
This miserable cursed chance:
but when that they did hear
Which were their mates, the hollow sighs
yea every man did fette,
The trickling drops of many tears
to shead they nothing let:
They houle and cry full piteously,
and evermore they band
That cruel cursed Esterne wind
which brought them to the land.
They tear their herish mantels gray,
they pull in pieces fast,
Their gally breeches all a row,
they were so sore aghast:
Who so had seen the Mariners
their seely flesh to tear,
Himself would think but that they had
been void of every care:
They lost their senses all at once,
their faces all were pale
And wan, to see the fortune that
these men should come in gayle,
Not being yet one hour ago
since that they came on shore:
If by their hearts they might have come
I think they would have tore
In pieces small, they were so vexed
that instant present time,
That none had thought that ever they
the shrowdes again would clime:
Nor yet have sailed away with bark,
they were in such a case:
Some drew no breath, why? they were dead
three hours in that place:
They were as wild as hares that be
ybred in bushes thick,
Or else the Roe which hedges hye
to leap he does not stick.
Thus are the Sea men troubled to
as well as other be,
They feel as bitter pangs, or worse
as any of the three.
Yet reason somewhat takes place,
and calls back again
These troubled souls which lately were
in miserable pain,
Their wits to them be now restorde,
they have their memory,
They do pretend to go and see
this woeful tragidie:
Where when they came in market place
they saw the gallow tree,
The scaffold where the judges seat
appointed was to be,
The bar, where they should plead their cause,
if guilty they were found,
The Sargiants with the yeomens aid
which stood about them round,
Should lead them to the tree a cross
the which the hangman made
The day before, in hope that he
twice double should be paid
For this his work, for he does say
that time does him provoke,
That now the pigge is proffered
to hold up straight the po^e:
For what so ever that they be
that will not when they may,
The Proverb has him told that when
he would he shall have nay.
Now every thing provided was,
the judge him self comes in,
The gayler he commanded was
that he should never lin,
Till that the prisoners were brought,
their judgment for to have
Aright, which they them selves that time
most willingly did crave:
They came full weakly God does know,
the one the other led,
They looked as tho that Atrapos
had cut their fatal thread,
Their faces showed as tho they had
lien in their grave a year,
To look upon them steadfastly
each one did stand in fear,
So ugly was their look when as
they came from dungeon deep,
They were so faint through feebleness
that they could scarsely creep,
But by the stony walls, which would
not suffer them to fall,
Lest that perchance the stubborn bolts
their feeble legs might gall:
There might you see three women, that
were quick with child in sound,
Two men, a boy, a maid, there
stark dead that time was found:
Ye might behold the Mariners
how they did tremble fast,
What fervent faith they suffered
till these same three were past.
Ay me alas (quoth one) that I
should ever see the day,
Woe worth the time that I was borne
an other he can say:
The third he said that he was cursed
the worser was his luck,
When as his nurse she gave to him
her puffed teat to suck:
The fourth he said, I was bewitched,
when first I handled knife,
I think my crooked arms were cursed
it did not rid my life.
What wicked fortune had we when
we escaped in the night,
(What made us all to cry aloude,
now gallows claim thy right)
When we were almost drounde in
deepest Sea by Libia?
What evil chance had we to escape
the straights of Africa?
There houls the ragged boy a main
with open throat a loud,
His voice so shrill ascended straight
unto the highest cloud
That placed was in air, beset
with stars on every side,
Or where the glorious Phoebus runs
his course) so loud he cride,
With cares he was so nipt at heart,
that all things there he cursed.
He liude not long, incontinent
amongst them all he burst.
Gaulfrydo went before the Judge
all feeble as he might,
Barnarde le Vain trudged after fast,
he was not out of sight.
The Iayler led the inholder,
which was in shackle strong,
The quest did quit him by and by,
he tarried there not long.
Of which his careful wife was glad,
of mirth was all her song,
The hangman held his head aside,
he thought they did him wrong.
Barnarde le vain he pleaded hard.
it did upon him lie,
That he was giltlesse of the deed
each one began to cry:
The judge himself could nothing find,
ne could the rest that went
Upon that matter, hard to skanne,
but wholly they were bent
To set him free: And as they did
who tarried for to hear
Galfrydos case, like to a freende
as here it does appear.
Galfrydo he was called out
his judgment for to know,
His heart was gone, he shakes fast,
he trembles as the dow,
To see the cruel looks, the which
the Judge did to him give.
When Jupiter was driven out
of heaven by cruel fear
Of Ziphoon, that giant huge,
which did approach him near:
At that same time, I mean, when as
full secretly he came
To Egypt, where in form and shape,
was like unto a ram:
Juno she was made a Cow,
Appollo was a crow,
They stood not half so much in fear
as Galfryde I do know:
Nor yet Dianas buttocks went
so fast a pit a patte,
When she was driven out of heaven,
and then became a Catte:
Nor Venus, who does daily make
young men her birds to wish,
Was not so feared (as this our friend)
when she was made a fish:
Ne yet the merry Mercury
which often would have playde
On Oten pipe, when Ibis he
a pretty bird was made.
They needed not once to have left
the heavens for such a knave:
No more this wight he needed not
to fear, which will not save
Him self (as it does seem to me)
but grants to the fact:
And said unto the Judge aloude,
I only did the act.
At which his friend all in a maze,
began thus for to say:
Ye Patrons grave and wise, give ears
to me I do you pray:
This man (O noble Senators)
did never do the deed,
It was my self I do confess,
no longer now you need
To toil and moyle in searching forth
this matter, which is plain.

Gal. O hold thy peace thou trusty friend,
thou speak but in vain,
It was even I that did the deed,
if Judges right they be,
Let this my friend go pack away,
the law must go on me:
Offender there must be but one,
all you do know the same*
Before you all, the murderer
my self I do proclayme.

Bar. Not so my friend, but only I
whose craysed corpse with stroke,
In sunder quite, in midst of street,
with bloody sword I broke.

Gal. I did the deed, if that you mean
the fellow for to take.

Bar. Thou did not, whereof leave of
thy forging tales to make.
O constant man that ever was,
thy fame will never dye,
O noble heart that dwells in breast
where such true love does lie.
At sudden sight of this the Judge
was wholly there amazde,
Then hurly burly did begin,
great rumors straight was raysde:
Then every man would be a judge,
and say that it was he
That did the deed: some verdits were
the other for to be.
But God the truest searcher of
the inward parts of man,
The mighty Judge, the Lord of all
that possibly we can
Or may recite, with foultring tongue
for his he does provide.
When they be in their troubles great,
as here it may be tried:
The murderer stood by the stage
whereas the judges sat,
His conscience so pricked him there,
that up aloft he gate
Before them all, where rudely he
did draw his bloody blade,
Where easily it might be seen
how it in blud was laid:
This vile and cankred sword (quoth he)
and I were at the fray,
I am the man (ye Judges) that
did bring him to a bay,
I laid along his laysie corpse,
I do it not deny,
And if it were to do again,
by God that sittes on hye,
I would it do: wherefore these men
have suffered injury,
Abiding for my only deed
such cruel misery.
Upon the which the judges they
began a new assise,
And better for to think upon
the matter they devise:
The quest again begins a fresh
upon these two to go,
The standers by they give good ear
the verdit for to know,
The foreman he does bring it in,
he shows very plain*
The matter whole: but to be sure
they are turnde back again.
Yet once more they do come, where as
they told the judge that he
That last of all did come in place,
the murderer for to be.
The Judge he did condemn him there,
the hangman he did watch,
He thought within him self that he
had caught a goodly catch.
Where when the people heard him say,
go hence the gallows stays,
Their wits in searching forth the truth,
all there began to praise.
The Judges praise does flee abroad,
him every man does name,
In country, town and villages
full rife is known his fame.
The foresaid Mariners rejoice,
their mates each one be glad,
That these their heads had escaped so well:
upon the which they had.
The towns men with their gladsom wives
their households whole and some,
To take their pleasures of the wine
if they would to them come,
Whereas their ship did lie, which brought
the claret, white and red,
Their biscuit good, but moldy cheese,
whereof they daily fed.
Each one attended to their wills,
they granted their desire,
They clothe them selves full sumptuously,
they wear their best attire:
The day is come, the pretty dames
which be so free and frank,
Do go so sagely on the way
by two and two a rank,
Which seemed well, but yet they would
not bid unto the feast
The Murderer which hanged was,
of whom they thought on least,
Which was of them an oversight:
but if they him had bid,
He would have made them answer none,
because that he had rid
But lately here, one winching jade,
which did him leave behind,
So that the right way to his home
he could not after find:
But in his stead one Tibine came,
Amasina his wife,
His daughter fair Charina, whom
they loved as their life,
Who did surmount the virgins all
that ever was in Greece:
I think the gods never made
a fair or trimmer piece:
They could not, why? because the moulde
(which was with them so rare)
Themselves had lost: when first they made
her rosiall color fair,
Her princely corpse, her shoulders twain,
her stature long and tall:
Her little head adorned was,
which ouerlooketh all:
With gorgious knackes of value great
her fingers to depaynt,
Apelles ours, or Xeuxes good,
she would make for to faint,
The better of them both, if that
they were on earth alive,
This to be done in every point
man's wit can not contriue:
What though he took in hand to make
dame Venus in her plight,
Yet durst he not set to his hand
with pensill for to wright
Or paynte at large this sumptuous dame
whom every one does vewe:
Nay, if he should, he might perchance
his hastiness soon rewe,
He would be rapt in amors then
far further with this dame,
Than ever he with Venus was,
if I may tell you plain.
But all this banquet while: Bernard
he cast a glimmering eye,
He was as glad as any man
when her he might epsy.
Now all this while did Venus smyle,
and Cupide crafty knave:
Sreight Bernards heart was stroke with dart,
and such a blow he gave,
As none but that Charina she:
Could help him, I am sure,
No physickes art, but she alone
was able for to cure
His pangs, his pangs, his fretting pangs
which vexed him so sore:
A worser plague has chanced now
than ever did before:
Now is he driven to study hard,
he dares not to her speak,
His bloody heart it was so full
that it was like to break:
But for all that he kept them tacke
what ever that they did.
Till that the night with mantle black
the splendant light had hyd:
For all that Nox was coming on,
and Vesper after hyed,
A little while yet did they stay
because they had espied
The bycornd Moon: who was at hand
to light them on their way,
The minstrell he was called in
some pretty jest to play:
Then Robin hood was called for,
and malkin ere they went:
But Barnard ever to the maid
a loving look he lent,
And he would very feign have daunst
with her, if that he durst:
As he was offering, Galfryd caught
her by the hand at furst,
Who being in as far as one
he was not to be blamde:
But this same dorre his friend abode,
of which he was ashamde,
There naught he said, but laughed as fast
as any of them did:
When they had done, he took the maid,
a galliarde he did bid:
The minstrels play in comely sort,
he led her twice about,
Then her he capt, she cursie made
before the open rout:
He trips about with sincopace,
he capers very quick,
Full trimly there of seven aleuen,
he shows a pretty trick:
Each man they did behold him there,
her father likes it well:
Amasina her mother said
that he should bear the bell.
These words made glad the yongma^s heart,
the minstrels left to play,
He gave to her the courtesy
that dauncers use to pay.
They do depart, they hye them home,
they thank them for their cheer,
The pretty maid she comes on,
to them she draws near,
With cursies two or three she does
give thanks unto them both:
But that she should them shortly see
at home she would be loath.
Now for her gentle courtesy
a hundred thanks they give:
Ere two days past they said they would,
if they so long did live.
Now all the way they have no talk,
but of these loving twain:
Each one they ioyed that these two
were ridden of their pain.
An old said saw it is the which
is spoken of every one,
The lesser grief exiled is,
a greater comes anon.
These troubled two they go to bed,
where they on fancies fed,
The one he thinks upon the maid,
the other thinks in deed
That he was blessed when he might
by any means devise,
Once for to see with rouing sight
that dame before his eyes:
They turn and toss in bed full often,
from side to side again,
Now one would up, the other down,
but naught would ease their pain.
At last the Ravens did discry
Aurora to be near,
Then up they go in comely wise
each one puts on his geere:
They hyed to the wished place
where as the virgin lay,
Galfrydo saw she was not up,
he went him self away,
Barnard le vain he tarried still,
he saw that did him please,
He trudged home full merrily,
his fevers did appease.
Galfrydo whippeth out anon,
he goes to her round:
Barnard he after hyes apace,
where that same time he found
Galfrydo talking soberly
unto the maid alone:
Barnard he thought his part was lost,
his love away was blown,
Of him he thought no count was made
he durst not show his mind
To her, who ever loud him well,
as by due proof we find:
He doubts she will not grant to him
that which he would desire,
He durst not show his inward grief
which burns as the fire:
But to his chamber straight he goes
where up and down he walks
In torments great, in fretting pangs,
unto him self he talks:
O God (quoth he) what makes my head
to be so far at square,
My wits be almost ravished,
such is my grievous care.
But to assuage that dolefulness
that heaviness of mind,
He takes pen in hand to write
to her, some ease to find.
Trudge little letter, thou think none ill,
Go do thy duty, all things to fulfill.

Seignor Bernardo to his mystresse Charina.
MY Lady dear, in whom
my life and death is set,
Refuse me not, (I thee desire)
my grief do not forget:
But read and judge of this,
as you shall think it best,
See how the fyery flame of love
abridgth my quiet rest,
Ilyue, and yet do daily dye,
I vvyther as the flower,
I follovv death: yea death him self,
denies to shevve his power.
Feign vvoulde I speak to thee (my love)
to shevve my pyning vvo,
My silly senses disagree,
each one I should do so,
That they might take their rest,
as they have done before,
For that my sorrovves still begins,
and vex me more and more.
I bathe my breast with doleful tears,
I never cease to moan,
I sigh as does a vvounded dear,
into a place alone,
Where as I do on fancies feed,
thereby to please my mind,
Still fayning that I see thy face,
some ease at length to find.
Or else that I should so become
as one forlorn (alas)
My hands would not forbear a whit
to let my soul out pass.
Turn back now (good mysteresse mine)
regard my suit I say:
Let not a lover young so soon
be brought unto decay:
Flesh me therefore now (I do say)
good lady in this game,
Deny me not at first, I crave,
which never knevve the same.
All this is for thy only love,
that my poor heart does taste:
Thou only art the cause, god knovves,
my piteous parts do waste,
Let now dear dame, some mercy come
consider of my cause,
That am but lately brought in hold
to taste of lovers laws:
That all the world may say
thou damsel haste the knyfe,
Who might have slain me woeful wretch
and yet did save my life:
Hereby thou vvinst the price,
then print this in thy mind,
Behold how pity pleades my cause,
let her some favor find.
In hope hereof my dear adevv,
the treasure of my trust,
The only comfort of my care
till I consume to dust.
Your loyal and afflicted servant Seignor Bernardo.
Read not in spite, but take delight
in this, which once was prose,
Whose watered plants scarce sicate were
till he this same did close.
But as he has with good will vvritte,
whose heart thou haste in hold,
So nothing let to do the like,
vvherof thou might be bold,
To count him as thine own,
Whose heart with thine shall rest alone.
Now it is made, yet does he doubt
that this will not prevail,
Then starts he up in fury great,
and thus begins to rail:
O palefaced, hellish, lumpish sow,
O grisly ghost, I say,
What meant the hills they fell not on
my corpse that present day
When first I saw that Tigresse vile,
that heart of marble stone,
That traytresse rude, with whom I think
my friend is now alone:
O that the heavens might fall on her
which works me this woe:
I hope the earth will swallow her,
or Boreas he will blo
Away with blasts that Lioness,
that no man may her see:
I would the raging foming Seas
they had her for their fee.
Or that the mighty Jupiter
when he is in his ire,
Might throw upon her thunder boltes,
or else consume with fire
Her cursed corpse, which has in it
a poison cankred heart:
Or that the foul infernal feendes
of her might have a part.
His host then being near at hand,
heard him in raging wise,
Who it should be he marueyled,
he could not well devise:
But up he goes, where him he found,
he asked him the cause,
He does not let, but tells all,
at it he does not pause.
Fear not my guest (the good man said)
as yet she is not spead.
Bar. If that she be, the devil gnaw
her beastly carren head.
But ere she be, I look to have
a recompense of pain,
And reason wills it so to be,
unless she list to feign:
But some respect for love (I think)
to have unfeigned part,
And think it but a fit reward
for such a good desert:
But I unhappiest wight of all
have spent my time in vain,
In hope of succor at her hands
Whilst other get the gain.
As thirsty ground does gape for thirst,
and swalloweth in the shoure,
Even so do I poor Arpalus,
whom Cupides pangs devour,
I till my soil with grievous pain,
I lay the seed thereon,
And others come and reap the sheaues,
and laugh when I am gone:
Mine is the troublous winters toil,
and theirs the summers gain,
The harvest falls unto his share
that felt no part of pain.
I fast while he does feed apace,
I thirst while he does drink,
I mourn whilst he triumphs for joy,
he swimmes whilst I do sink:
He gathers in the hoped gain,
whilst I the loss endure,
He whole at heart, whilst I my grief
by no means may recure,
He shroudes him self in pleasant shade,
I sit in open sun,
He leapes as lammes in lusty lays,
I lie as one undone:
I would but her enjoy at will,
I crave that is debarde,
He has (I say) who can have more?
his service is preferde.
Thus I procure my woe (alas)
in framing him his joy,
I seek for to assalue my sore,
I breed my chief annoy.
As sheep with woll be clad full thick,
their masters have the gain,
And birds do build their nests in brakes,
and put them selves to pain,
Yet others have the fruit you see
when that the bird is hatched,
The nest remaynes, the birds are gone,
the chickens be dispatched.
But I think it ordaynde in deed
by gryly gods above,
That I should gape whilst others gain
the guerdon of her love:
But since that woman's wicked will
is forgetful of my woe,
And not the mighty gods ordeinde
my destny to be so,
Then must I needs complain apace,
and curse that cruel kind,
That in requite of my good will
has shewde her self unkind.
But what ever be the cause God knows,
hereafter I intend
To faune on them that faune on me,
to bow when other bend:
This one abuse shall make with speed
me take the better keep,
On whom I fix my fancies fast,
with whom I wake or sleep.

Host. If so you do you do but well,
it will be for your best,
He said no more, but went away,
he left alone his guest.
Bernarde le Vain who when he saw
that no man could discrye
The act which he pretended had,
when no man there was by,
He drew a glistering blade at once,
he set it to his heart:
Tilt he had done that rufull deed,
it did not once depart.
This done, Galfrido he comes home,
a merry man was he,
Charinas smyling smirkyng looks
had made him so to be.
Where when he came in chamber foul
his joys were laid aside,
He saw his friend lie all for dead,
the bloody swoorde he spyde,
Which had bereaved him of breath,
the letter there he found,
He read it out, when he had done
he laid it on the ground,
He took the blade, he after went
in darkness for to lie,
Since that his friend was gone before,
he past not for to die.
When as the host he heard of this,
himself he went and hoong,
An arina she from window hye,
her comely corpse she floong.
Ynd Tibine too, when as he he heard
his daughter to be dead,
De stayed not, but with a knyfe
his hungry throat he fead.
His wife, the mother to the maid,
she ran to river round,
Where as the crew of maryners
that instant time she found:
She tells to them these bloody broils
which she that time did see,
How blood, by blood, and death by turns
in Greece now for to be:
These words once spoke, she leaped in
there she gave up the ghost.
The Maryners they hoysed up
their sail and left the coast.
Not twice two leagues they had not gone,
(as many men did think,)
But that the ship unluckily,
there presently did sink.
In deepest sea* their grave was made
the lovers lie in town,
Where Tibine has a place, besides
Charina has a room.

FINIS
quod John Grout gent.

These will be had in memory
of all that have them seen:
Now they be dead, let all men say,
God save our noble Queen:
That she may vanquishe traitors all,
which seeks her decay:
The good and godly so I know
continually will pray.
FINIS.
OMNIA TEMPVS HABENT.
