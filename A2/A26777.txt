I matter not how I appear to Man,
A Witness in my soul there lives that can
Bear Record to the Father this, that I,
Seek not Mortals praise, but Immortality;
That Crown of rest and peace I may receive,
Which Mortals have not in their power to give,
Which he must do who sets me free from sin;
And being clean, in peace there rules that King,
Who will not join unto Iniquity,
But of a Virgin pure conceived is he.

When I call to mind those precious movings that were stirring in many, I
cannot forget, though you have back-slidden and turned back to Egypt for help,
the Lord pass by your weakness, and lay it not to your charge: But all know the
Call wherewith the Lord our God has called us, is a holy Call, and we know it
is bondage to the uncircumcised nature, yea, verily we have found it so, but
yiedling obedience to the light, we have found that nature crucified in
measure, and the Cross made easy by him that bears it in us, who is come to
purge out the old leaven, and make the lump like unto himself, we having all
sinned after the similitude of Adam, and for sin is the earth cursed, and in
sorrow must we bring forth, and the seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpents
head; but verily friends if it be known no otherwise, than barely by reading
those Words, it is but a sandy foundation, and will not stand, being brought in
by the outward senses, as the eye, or the ear, which all may attain to, that
knowledge; yet none shall know the mystery, but those in whom it is revealed by
the Light; therefore it is in vain to get coverings, they shall not save you,
for God is known as he is obeyed in his light, which is holy as he is holy;
Therefore return to within, and deal plainly as before the Lord, and see if by
your long hearing, are you redeemed from your vain conversation, or witness the
new birth, or what makes you differ from the World? but verily I say unto you
it is not your hearing, or wishing to be as the redeemed of the Lord are, but
you must come to the work, and put your hand to the plow, and look not back to
pleasant Sodom, if you do, the Lord will have no pleasure in you: And this
know, we have known nights of sorrow, before we knew a day of joy, and
assuredly so must you, if ever you come to see the seed spring out of a dry
ground, which is covered over with the earthly, which must be yiedling before
the seed come up, therefore come to the Light which makes manifest your evil
deeds, and see if it will deceive you, or has deceived us for so we are
acco^n^ed of by the dark World, that dares not come to the Light to have their
evil deeds reproved by it, neither can the wicked stand in Judgment, and
therefore have they got themselves an outward covering thinking thereby to
escape; but all know we must stand nakedly bare before God, and all must be
judged according to the works done in the body, whether they be good or evil;
and this we know whom the Lord is redeeming to walk with him in purity and
holiness, knowing we are always before him, and by his Light in us judging and
condemning sin in our works, words, and thoughts; and though all the World
condemn us, yet we know him near that justifies, in us the hope of glory; and
for this end has he set up his light a standard in the earth, to call in any
that is weary and thirsty to come and drink of the water of life freely,
without money and without price, and those that drink thereof, shall have it in
them springing up to eternal life; and this I say unto all* come and see him,
for this is no other, but the Messiah who have told me all that I have done,
and who can declare this but the begotten Son of God, and this is he by whom
the Prophets prophesied, and this is he whom the Apostles saw and bare witness
of, the Lamb slain from the beginning, the first and the last, and those must
know the Son in them who calls God Father, for none knows the Fathe but the
Son, and those in whom he will reveal him, and this is the Bread which came
down from heaven, by which Bread we live, and by it our souls are nourished up
unto eternal life; and as there is nothing of absolute necessity for the body
but bread and water, so there is nothing of absolute necessity for the soul,
but this Bread and Water, without which we cannot live, for it pleased the
Father that in him all fullness should dwell, of whose fullness we partake grace
for grace, love for love, and this is our Light, and life, Jesus, God manifest
in flesh, to destroy the works of the Devil, and then we can truly call him
Savior, for he has saved us from our sins, but he that says he has no sin,
and yet lives in sin, is a liar, and knows not him that sets free from sin,
and those whom the Son makes free, are free indeed; and no new Gospel do we
preach, (as the world do falsely accuse us of) but bears witness to the same
life, whose body suffered at Jerusalem, and was crucified by the unbelieving
Jews, whom God has raised, of whom I bare witness, I never knew him by the
hearing of the outward ear, nor by reading the Letter with the outward eye, but
I knew him by that word of life preached, which word is near in the heart,
which word the Apostle preached, which word you must come to witness to be that
which turns the mind to God, and then search the Scriptures to know whether
these things be so or no, for they are for the perfecting the man of God
through Faith in Jesus Christ.

To any that call themselves the Ministers of Christ, and yet know not that
Christ that was the Word in the beginning, before the Letter was writ. You that
make a likeness of any thing, is but an idolatrous Worship, teaching for
doctrins the Commandments of men, is but imitation, which Moses rod will
destroy, who had not known there had been a Christ, had not the Letter declared
it to you; you never knew the door, but are climed up another way, you must
come down for no Thief must enter his Kingdom, nor buyers nor sellers dwell in
his Temple, but the free gift must be freely given, without money or without
price, neither can any truly preach free grace, but those that witness a
Savior, the Son of God come to fulfill the Law of God, and save his People from
their sins, which is the grace of God which has appeared to all men, teaching
us to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, which war against the spirit, and
being saved we can truly call him Christ, the great power of God to Salvation;
but you have gotten so far into the spelled name of the dead Letter, that you
have lost the life or the interpretation, which is God with us; and though you
have sold Joseph into Egypt, because of his party colored garment of his
Fathers love, yet to him must you all bow, or starve for want of the Bread of
life, for the Famine will be great amongst you, for all shall be committed to
him the chosen seed, to whom the promise is; Therefore build not high, Babel
like, for the Lord comes down to see the Sons of men, and he will confound the
Imaginer, therefore to build sure is to build low that the Rock may raise the
foundation, which Rock is Christ, the express Image of the Father, who dwells
with the low and contrite heart, that fears his word; but they that know him no
nearer than sixteen hundred years ago, they know him not, but whilst they stand
gasing up, a cloud receives him out of their sight, but that same Jesus which
ascended up descended, and is the light of the world, and all that will receive
the light, he gives power to become the sons of God, by that son who came to do
the will of God, the elect, sanctifier, the justifier, the glorifier, the
anointed high Priest for ever, who is come to reconcile God unto man, and man
unto God, by washing and cleansing with his blood of life; some are thereby
made fit Temples for the Holy God to dwell in, whom I bear witness will not
join to iniquity or any unholy thing, but to those whose wills he has
subjected to himself, there he rules and has put all things under him, and it
is they that witness a whole Savior, that everlasting Prince of peace. And
this cannot you witness, who believe you cannot be cleansed here, but in
another world; but take heed that that faith do not fail you in the hour of
death, that you know not, who, nor where, nor what your Savior is, and so go
to the grave where there is no place of repentance; for as ye sow ye shall
reap, and as the tree falls, so it lies, and the Crown of life, the white
stone, the new name is promised but to him that overcomes: Now let the eye of
God, the light which is pure, search you, and see if you rightly know the thing
by which you are called Gospel Ministers; but be not deceived, neither deceive
others, for a Cup of Sufferings you must feel to cut down all pride,
selfishness, before that glad tidings you shall receive from him whose kingdom
is not of this world, but comes contrary to it. Therefore to you tender ones,
who are able to judge somewhat in spiritual things, fear nor to go down to
Joseph, for though he may seem a rough man to those that sold him, yet to
Benjamin does his bowels yern to make himself kuown: but no man was to stand by
while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren, the truth of which you shall
find, that God may be glorified, who sees not as man, but rightly knows the
heart and works all to the good of them that in truth loves him, he will open
to them that knock, and all that truly seek h m shall assuredly find him.
Therefore it is my desire that none of you sit down till you have found him
whom your soul loves. But if you will be high and not come down, it is not many
years but you shall feel a famine, and whether you will believe or no, truth it
is that has been declared.

A warning to all those that are at ease in Sion, and will not come out to help
the Lord against the Mighty in this great day wherein he is dividing the
precious from the vile, the righteous from the urighteous. Woe to all you who
will not come out to help the Lord, for it is his good pleasure to gather to him
a people, and to setup this name among them, Holiness to the Lord. And this is
the word of Truth unto you, What could he have done more to^h^s*people than he
has done? He dug about them, and made a hedge, and looked that they should
have brought forth Grapes, but there came up Briers and Thorns: he looked for
judgment, but behold oppression; for mercy, but behold a cry: therefore will
he let forth his Vineyard to other Husbandmen that shall bring forth fruit to
the Lord thereof. Therefore you literal Jews haste to repentance before the
Decree be sealed, for a sealed number has the Lord said there shall be; and if
the Jews, the first called, will not come, the highway Gentiles shall be
compelled in. O it is lamentable to see how you Jews have evilly requited the
Lord, he has not been lacking unto you in discovering hi^ love to you first:
but many of you have turned like the Dog to his vomit, and like the Sow washed
to the wallowing in the mire; and though the God of the World has blinded your
eyes that you cannot see, but satisfying your selves in saying, we cannot be
clean here; but did you love the good God as you do the God of this world, you
would find his power as able to keep you from sin, as the other to keep you in
sin: but deceive not your selves, the eye of the Lord sees what your heart
lusts after, and all those who are in the light they see you also, how with
fained words and fair speeches you draw near to God, but your hearts are far
from him, and that none but the eye of God the Light, can discover, but you
must join to it, for it is those that receive him to whom he gives power to
become the sons of God. I know it is the will of God Israel should be saved,
herefore join your wills to his, that his word may be accomplished, and sit not
down til the Dove has found rest for the sole of her foot, which will not be
till the waters are abated, which you shall see done by the word of his power,
his Son, the light of the world, and Savior of all those that believe in him.
But if you are so high you will not bow to that little thing, to stoop down to
it, know of a truth you may kindle sparks of your own, but you shall lie down
in sorrow; for a witness for it I am, and I dare not keep silence that there is
no other name given by which you can be saved, but by the name Jesus, the Word
which was in the beginning, which showed Adam he had sinned, and Cain he was
not accepted, because envy was in his heart to his innocent brother, which he
after manifested: which Word was known to Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
Moses and all the Prophets, which was the same which is known by that name
Immanuel or Jesus, God manifest in flesh, born of a pure virgin, which you
literal Jews say you know; but it is but the same knowledge your forefathers
had, they said he was to be born, and of a virgin in Bethlem, of the seed of
David, as the Prophet* of the Lord had said.

Now you say he is born in Bethelem of a Virgin, and of the Seed of David as
the Apostles have said, yet could not the Jews by their learning and works of
the Law, know him when he was born, nor you by your learning, nor imitating the
Apostles know him that is born, and though you were invited to the Feast, you
should have taken the lowest place, till the Master of the Feast had bid you go
up higher, but you boldly went up without his leave, but behold a more
honorable person is come in, and you must go down lower, for it is he that
humbles himself shall be exalted, and he that exalts himself, shall be
brought down, and this I know there is no struggling or striving with him, he
will make you bow, and bend you or break you in pieces.

Let no one envy his Brother but abide in love.
Know you not that every envious man is a murderer, and the Lord hears the
cry of the innocent, why are you envious at your brothers sacrifice, because it
flames, if you do well are you not accepted? if not sin lies at the door, what
if thy brothers do burn and thine does not? would you kill him because God has
accepted him? but cease you rage and know for a truth Israel shall not always
be in bondage under Pharaohs Task masters, though they may command to kill the
man-child, yet lovely Moses is born, but is to be hid in the rushes, and after
nour^shed up in Pharaohs Court, and he not know it, and that is he that shall
deliver poor Israel from his hard bondage, if you know not what this means,
then know that God is not known by wisdom, or humane learning, but he is the
same God that changes not, and as he did formerly he does now he brings to
pass his strange work, which seems to you learned ones a foolish and low thing,
yet he will by this foolish thing confound your wisdom which has puffed you up
with a high confidence that you can say well, but you have gone too far without
your guide, having skipped the Law and the Prophets, and are come as far as
Gospel or Christ, but truly friar as you must come back again to the first
Chapter of Genesis, and there read the first days work which God did, he
divided the light from the darkness, and the light he blessed, because he saw
it was good, and the darkness he called night, and so he went on with every
days work, will the whole Creation was finished. Look not out, for this
creation you must witness wrought in you, before you come to the Sabbath, the
Lord of rest; for our God is a God of Order, and Moses was to do according as
he saw the pattern showed him, and all this is to be seen in the light; but how
Haman, or man's proud will, that is so highly advanced will come down off the
Kings horse, to give poor Mordecai that place, I know it will be death unto
him: but he must down, the king has decreed that honor unto Mordecai, and as
the Lord lives he shall have it, let the heathen rage, and the people imagine a
vain thing, yet shall his Son be set on that holy hill Sion.

Thinks human wisdom I can easily see
The Scripture can this thing declare to me;
But it is not known by pleasure, ease or sleep,
Who finds this Pearl must dig both low and deep
And whosoever finds before it be his own,
He must sell all to purchase that alone,
And cast up all his stock, and look within,
Before to build this house he does begin.
Remember Babel, do not build too high,
Nor make a Tower to reach unto the sky,
Nor look without, but turn thy eye within,
See Christ be laid, then build thy House on Him*
Who builds not on this Rock, shall surely fall,
For he is the Cornerstone uniteth all.
Cease then a while you humane learned men,
And know your wisdom cannot find out him.
Thou willing and obedient, know i^'s thee*
Whose vail is rent to see this mystery:
It Is not the prudent, learned, wise, that shall
Him comprehend, who is the light of all.
Follow the light, for surely 'twill thee bring
Where he is born, then bow and worship him.
No sooner is he born, but thou shall see,
That Herod's nature by its cruelty.
Seeks to destroy that Newborn babe in thee.
Known to many by the name'of Susanna Bateman.
