Here ends the table.


Here begins the first chaptre the which speaks of the discrypcion of the
body of polycye. Capitulo. Primo.
IF it be possible that of vice might grow ver tue / it will please me well in
this party to be passyoned as a woma^^ like as many men h^^ den oppynyon that
nature of woman can (...) keep under scylence the abundance of her(...) rage:
Now come hardely and show out by many clear ryue(...) and crystal sprynges /
and by the vnst auchable countaynes of my courage / which can not hyde for to
cast out the desires of virtue: O virtue a thing noble and deyfyed how dare I
be so bold and auaunte my self to speak of the which I know right well that
mine understanding cannat quyckely comprehendene understand clearly ne
declare: But out thing re comfort me and gives me hardynes that I
understand the so benygne / that thou will not be dylplcasyd though I speak
of the not oonly in thy most subtle things / but only in such things as may
be comprehend in my conceyt^^ where fore I shall make a remembrance of the in
^dyfyeng of good virtues: And first for to speak of the learning and rule for
to live after our betters: That is to know after the princes of the which
thing I beseech most lowly their high mageste that they take no disdeyne of so
symplea wit as mine is / and that so simple a creature dare take upon for to
speak of ye rule of so high estate / but that it would please them to with
hold ye techynge of ye Philosopher which says / have no disdeygne of the
lytclnesse / though thou be never so great / and specially on him that speaks
good words: And so hereafter I trust to speak meanly by the grace of god of
the order of living of noble princes and knights / and in the third part of
all other people / the which three gendres of estate ought to be in polyce and
after the symylytude of one body that is quycke after the sentence of the
honorable man that is named Pl^tarque / which in a pystell that he sent to
Trai^n^ the Emperor as an open thing to a body yt has life / of the which
the prince or the princes holden the higher place of the head / for as much as
they should and ought to be soueraynes / and of them should come the synguler
establysshynges in like wise as out of the understanding of men spryngen and
comen the foreyne wet kes that the members accheuen* The knights and the
nobles holden the place of ye hands and the arms* For like as the arms of a
man ben strong to meyteyne labor and pain / so they ought to have the
charge to defend the right of ye prince and the comen well* And they also ben
comparyd to the hands / for like as the hands put away the things that noyen
such wise they should put away all things that been evil and unprofitable* The
third manner of the people ben lykenyd to the belly / to the fete / and to the
legs. For like as the body receives in him all thing that comfort the head
and the mem bres / in like wise the excercyse of prync^ and nobles ought
return to the comen well like as it shall be more plainly declared
hereafter* And like as the legs and feet bear up the weight of a man's body
in like wise the labors sustain all other estates.

Here after it speaks of virtuous felycyte. Ca. ii.
^Hen now we have for to treat of virtue and profit of the order of living
of ye three estates by yt which said vertuo / The life of man ought to be
received in all manner of works / without which no man may attain to honor
/ for it is the right degree to worship as valere says / And yet he says more
that worship is the most plentuous nor y^^^ynge of virtue / And to this purpose
Arystotyll says / that to honor longs dew renerence in wytnessing of
virtue / yt is to know that worship ought not to be given to none but to them
y^ be virtuous* For he says not yt it should be given to ye mighty folks / ne
to the rich. but to them that be virtuous* For after his oppynyon the good men
should be worshypped always / For there is no thing so much desired in noble
hertes as is worship / like as he says him self in his book of Ethiques in
ye fourth book / that might and riches be not desired but only for worship*
Then it is true that to kings and great prync^ syn gulerly belongs worship
/ and so by consequent virtue* Now we must distynge ye parties that we
understand for virtue / For saint Austen says in his book of the Cite of god
in the xx. chapter / which declares in this manner* And says ye Phy losophers
say yt virtue is ye end of good and evil of man kind* That is to say yt ye
felycite of man kind is for to be virtuous Now it is so than / that in
felyeyte there ought to be great die lectacion / or else it were no felyeyte*
And of this joy and felyeyte the ancient Philosophers made paynt a figure of
an yma ge under this form / it was made in ye lykenes of a fair and an
amyable queen syttyng in a ryall cheyre upon ye earth. And about her were
ye.iiii. virtuous lokyng in her vysage as who says for to obey her
commandments / and for to obey and observe her^ Then she commanded to
prudence yt she should enquere dylyge^t ly how she might reygne long / and to
be ^heele and in sewre estate* Then she commanded to Just ye yt she should do
all thing yt she ought and keep ye laws to ye intent yt the peace were kept /
After that she commanded to strength yt if any sorrow came to her bo die / that
she should modre it in resystynge and virtuous thought Then she commanded to
attempetaunce that she should take wine and meet and other delectable things
so attemprely yt what thing yt she took it should be by reason and not to her
anoyau^ce^ And ^oby this present writing a man may understand that for to be
virtuous is none other thing but to have in him self all manner things that may
draw a man to well / and to with draw all things that sow^eth to evil and
to vices: Then it is necessary for governance of the polycy publyke that the
head be hole / that is to say virtuous: For and the head be sick all the body
shall feel it. Now we will begin to tell of the medycyne for the head / that
is to know of the king or of the princes: And like as our work begins at
ye head. we will take the first head of the age: that is to say the chyldhode of
the prince which is norysshed under the rule of his friends:

Here after is declared how a man should norysshe the children of princes at
their beginning. ^a..iii.
HOr because it is commanded us expressly for to love god: therefore we must
first introduce the sone of the prince at the beginning of his understanding
/ little and little for to serve god with small and light ^risons after the
wit of the child: For tho things that been accustomed in chyldhod* it is
right hard to be left: And for men should understand y^ such thing is
agreeable to god the psalm says that in the mowthe of infauntes and sowkers /
our lord has made his laud / that is to say he is agreeable thereto: And so
furthermore as he wareth in age he should be taught letters and seruyes such
wise as our lord may be preysed like as it is ac customed ^^ France to t^che
the young princes better than in other places for to here mass every day and
say their matyns / Also there must be purueyed for him a master that must be
wise and ready and more in good manners than in seyence / for not withstandyng
that sometime the children of princes were taught by ye Philosophers as it is
written of Philyp king of Macedoyne fader to the great Alysaunder* which worte
(...) Arystotyll that he was glad that he had a sone borne. But y^ he had
gretter joy that he was borne i^ his time to that ente^ ^ that he might teache
him and inform him / which happyd for to fall so afterward. For Arystotyll
was master to the great Alysaunder. Nevertheless for as much now in this
time as the prync, be not so couetouse now a days to be lernyd in the seyens /
which and it pleasyd god. I would that it were used now as it was want to be.
Wherefore me seems that it is best to get them a master that is a good man
and a discre t^ both in wisdom and in nurture and loving to god / though so
^e that he be not most excellent or subt ill Phylosophre. Ne uerthelesse it
were more lowable and a man could find such ^^e so parfyte that were a noble
clerk / And of such men: he princes should enquere dylygently / for the good
condycyons and manners that the child sees in the master* and the wise worcester
^^s and countenance of him. is to the child as a doctrine and ^mperoure. Also
y^ may c^ought to m^^teyne him by great ^^^dence in that office. For
natwithstandyng that nature of (...)ren may not be brought to learning but
oonly by dread (...) the sone of a prince behooves to be brought in by other m^
(...) for to make him dre^^ than by great betynge / for in to har ^^ ^o^ec^yon
of a child that is brought up in delytes might ^^^me many incouenyent* also
when he understands some(...)at of the state of lordshyp by the worship that
men do un(...)may under the manner of such corre^^yon conspyre a(...)his
master great indignacion / which may be great (...) ler^^nge and to the
peril of his master. And als^^^ the health ^^ the child which is softely
and dely(...)* But what ought the wise man for to do (...) use before him
such ensample as is shewde by (...) it is accustomed that about the chil
(...) of princes ben norysshed / other young children that been (...) sons
which ben his dyscyples / he ought to be sharp to them when they mysse take
them self / in such case as the sone of the prince has offended in / and
ought to beete them couenably. ^ut more to chaste yse them by sharp
countenance than by great betynges. And in semblable wise he must use such
manae^s to the sone of the prince if he will not correct him self. And at
sometime he must let him feel his rod. And so by such means he shall make
him sha^efast of such things as he both amysse and right ferefull and
obeysant. And also the wise master ought to keep him self y^ he show him not
to famys^a^e / or to pry^e for his dyscypie shall dread him the last ^^id that
the child also ^e him not play to nyce plays / nor lawghe at nofoly nor folly
she worcester des mor be not to much acqueynted / but like as he were half master
over every man. And his countenance ought to ^e great fair and steadfast / And
his clothing ought to be clean and honorable / and also before his dyscyple
he ought not to speak no vain words / but profitable and of good ensamples.
Yet not for that he should not at all times make a sharp vysage nor sharp
words / but he ought to draw the child unto him with amyable and sweet
words when that he with holds well that he lerneth / or else and he do any
other goodly thing / And also the master ought to do him sometime pleasure
with some manner of things th^^ is pleasant for children. And for to tell him
other while some good chyldrens tale of some tryfull for to make him lawghe.
And all for because that he should love his ^oo^e as well in manner as his own
dysportes / Also the master ought to set a co^ petent hour and a certain
rewle / and a certain sp^ce of time in which the child should conty^e^^ in
his ^^^^. And af ter that give him space to play before his dy^^^^ / (...) ^^
ought to be rewlyd that he ete not to sweet and delycate meets / nor drink to
strong and mighty wynes which causes often times great corrupeyons or else
sykenesses. And when the child comes to his gra^mer / Then the master
must begin to use more subtle words in his doctrine / like as he feleth
the understanding of the child / and that he be able to conceive them. And sol
ytell and little / and more and morely ^ewyse as the nowryce increases the
fedynge of the child after his we^ynge / so I suppose verily that the prince
will that his sone be lernyd in letture so far / as that he might
understand the rewles of gra^mer and to understand latyne which and it
pleased god / I would that it were so by a general custom of all princes that been now / and be for to come. For I suppose that much profit should grow
that of to them and to their subjects. In so much that it should cause the
peo ple to m^rea^e in goodness and great virtue. And the princes children should
be taught so far in letture / as that they might understand their logyke /
and so to contynewe there in* like as the noble and wise prince y^ duke of
Orlyans that now leueth / at the Iustaunce of the right honorable wise and
vertu^use duches my lady his wife. which as she that is the preyser and
worshypper of kunnynge and understanding is dylygent like a prudent mother to
instruct her chyl dren to wisdom in lecture and kunnynge.

And over all this the wise master before said whenne the understanding of
the child begins to increase and to have greatter knowledge. Then he ought
to learn him and fo^de him with wyser d^ceryne / and namely in good manners by
good ensamples or else to make him reed in books of ^esons / and he should
make him to understand to know / and dyscer^e the good from the evil / and
teache him and show him the way for to show good manners and virtue. like as
the worthy princes and well renowned have done before time as his predecessors
and other noble princes. And to she we him all the great goodness that
follows a good man. And in contrary wise to them that been evil or vycious /
and if he se him in any wise enclyned to the subtylte of kunnynge. he ought to
show him pleasant reasons to that intent that he should understand the great
felycyte that is in kunnyng / and open him the ways of Philosophy. That is to
know for to make him feel and understand it. And so for to have such a master
at his beginning the sone of the prince if he contynewe in such doctrine when
he comes to his age. he shall come to great excellence of virtue and to great
renown.

Here after it shows to what manner of men ought to be given the governance
of the children of princes. Capitulo. iiii.
When the sone of the prince is somewhat grown up / Then he ought to be
departed from the woman that have norys^hed him / And put him to the ward pryn
cypally of one of his ancient knights that is of great auctoryte. And it
must be well understand that he be a wise knight ^rewe manly and of good
living. And with him other unlyke wise* Then this knight ought dilygently to
^ake good heed to the manners of the child as much or more then to the
keeping of his body* He ought to be dylygent* also for to make him rise at a
competent hour for to here his mass to say his matens with fair and well
assewryd coun tenau^ce speak fair to y^ people ^al^we them benygnely yield
every man y^ does him worship like as longs to his estate. and the same
knight should show him o^te times what longs to the honor and worship of
knyghthodo / and should tell ^ym of the worshypfull deeds that y^ worthy men have
done before time* Also he should let him know which ben good men and better men
and best men of his faders house / And on the the other part which that ought
most to be worshypped* Also he must show him what is the manner of battle
and the worship in arms how men fyghten* how me^ assaylen. how men defend
them / and for what quarelles men should do arms and fight* what har^es is best
most strong and most sewre^or the most easy* and he should tell him the
causes why* And how a man should have diverse a^mures / after the case requires
of the battle or of the arms that he shall do / how men did sometime / and
how men do now and how he should preyse the good and worshypfull men and to
draw them toward him love them and worship them* And all such goodly things
he should do* And that knight ought to take good head y^ about the princes sone
there be nouther great man ^e small / use no dyshonest tales / nor that they
induce him not to no folly* Also he ought to take good head that the children
which ben about him be well nory^shed and well manered to that intent that they
bring him not for to do lewdely nor folys^hely / And if y^ princes sone do
amysse / he should correct him saying in this wise that it accords not to the
state of a prince for to do so* And if he will not amend him self / it shall
be to his great shame / for a prince without honor is nothing worth* And if
he will not be governed otherwise that he will leave him and go ^ro him / and
thus he should say to him often times* And under this form they should be
governed if they would attain to worship in time to come / And this affermeth
valere in his book which speaks how y^ ancient wise men induced their
children to good manners* And for to take upon them y^ hardness of great empryses
of worship and manhood* For they showed them the great worthynes and deeds of
good knights. And showed them also other good ensamples seyinge how that no
man might come to the degree of worship but by virtue* And at meet times made
sing gestes of the worthy men that we re past out of the world / and of y^
worshypfull deeds of their pre decessours / to that intent that the will of
young folks should be the more couraged / And thus says valere that ye old
aun cyent men taught thus their children* And then were scoles kept of the
worthynes of knyghthode and of good manners / of the which scoles he says come
out the ^esares / and the noble lygnes renomed in prowess and manhood* So it
is no doubt that by good ensamples and by wise steringes / often times to here
and se in chyldhode may be the cause that a man shall come to excellence in all
virtues: And semblably by evil doctrine / they may be brought in to y^ way of
pardycyon* For ^uerroys says in the second book of ^hyseques / that a man may
get him a second nature* that is to know by long custom of good or evil*
And therefore the friends to their power ought to keep their children from
evil customs taking in their youth* For as Orose says the erthen pot will
keep long y^ sweet taste of that lycoure that it is first occupied with. And
for this cause they of Grece^ that governed them sometime by great knowing and
malice. payned them self in such wise y^ these people y^ they hated should
take dylectacyon ineuyll custo mes / and by such means found ways to be
venged upon them

The exhortacyons that men should make to the children of princes. Capitulo. v.
^^so the sone of ye prince he being in chyldhode ought to be at somtymes
brought in to couns^yle where that the wise men ben assembled that determyne
the needs of the land / and y^ causes that fallen therein* And the order to
gouer ne well the polycye to that intent that from his chyldhode he should be
desirous to here and speak of the gouenaunce of the lordshyp which he is borne
unto / and that he is air of* so that he may at all times learn to speak and
to answer* of all such things as belongs unto him / And the knights and
the wise men should say unto him that he should take good head of that he
hereth them speak in counceyle / and that he bear it well away in his mind*
Furthermore they that have him in governance ought to make before him* all
manner of strange things of diverse countrees* And of the customs of men of
werre. of batayles. And of the governance of diverse places. of diverse arms*
Also of the feet of clergy / of the pope and of the church* And the
commandments to be showed unto him by doctoures of Theologye* And all that a
man ought to believe as a good christian man: Also he should here Sermons and
collacions of clerks at somtymes* And at sometime to here speak of y^ como^s.
of merchants. of laborers how they leave and cheuys^he them self. of rich
men / and poor men. And also of all manner things to that intent that in his
understanding he be not ygnorau^t of no manner thing y^ ought to be virtuously
known* For the Philosopher says that man is not wise y^ has not
understanding in all manner thy ges: And also it is right well done y^ his body
be put in excercyse of some manner of labor and travail* as in playng at ye
^ame or at the baase or other like plays / so that it be not over much. but
mesurably to that intent* that he war not to weary nor ^o heavy / nor gowrdy by
to much rest / nor y^ it cause not the superf^ue humors for to gadre in him /
semblably it should be told him of the poor and nedy people and show them him
/ and tell him that he ought to have pity and compassyon upon them. and that he
do them good for the love of god / which shall (...) a mean for to get him
paradyse* And also that he have py(...) up on poor gentylwomen and orphalynes
and socoure them in their needs for the love of god and gentylnesse* And to
a(...) poor women and men to his power* And gentylly here they(...) requests
/ and they should enduce him also to be benygne an(...) humble and true / and
tell him and she we him that not with standing though he / by the grace of god
be chosen to so great estate. yet he is as mortal as another / and shall here
nothing with him out of this world / but the good deeds and y^ evil that he
has done in this world* And for as much as he is gretter than another man /
he shall yield the gr^tter accompt^ Also he ought not to be proud nor feers in
courage though so be that men do him great re^erences and worshyppes / but
ought to yield all y^ graces to god / and should know the great gifts that he
receives of our lord / And all such good ensamples and mocyons would he
showed to y^ sone of the prince / yet not withstanding this he must be
suffered at somtymes for to play and take his dysportes like as it is rehearsed
here tofore* And always among it should not be forgoten to st^r^ him to good
virtues and manners.

^ere it tells what the young prince ought to do when he begins to
govern. Capitulo. vi*
WHen the sone of the prince is full grown and come to his age and to the time
of receyuyng his lordshyp and so s^sed in his heritage by succession / be it of
Realm or other lordshyp / Then like as after the flowers of trees she weth the
fruit / In like wise should appear and ^e showed in him the perfeccyon of
virtue / after the ensample of Charles the fyfte the wise king of France /
which held well the ways of virtue* For after that he was cr^wned / not
withsta^ dynge that it was in the flower of his youth / there was never
person that ever cowde take him with any thing of dis honest nor that he
never occupied time / but in all virtues and commendable things ^lyke as I
have written of him before this time in the book that speaks of his arts and
deeds and of his good manners* And in three thing the virtues of a pryn ce ought
to be showed without which he may not getene ha ue the crown of his good name
nor of his renown and by co^ sequent of worship. The first is / and the most
pryncypall lo ue god and dread him / and serve him without feynyng* And rather
to serve him with good deeds / than be to long lyinge in his orysons / Another
is this* he ought to love syngulerly the encrese of his Realm and of his
people* And in that point he ought to set his study rather than upon his
synguler profit* The third is that soueraygnely he ought to love Iusty ce and
keep it* and hold it without brekyng / And he should do equity to all people /
and by observing of these three points* he shall be crowned with glory both
in heaven and in earth* Now from hensforth we will contynewe in our matter as in
y^ first party which speaks of the heed / That is to wit of the pryn ce or
of princes and we will found us upon these three points / And for to speak of
y^ first point which is for to love god out of the which we should draw
many branches of virtue that hangs there upon / and all to our purpose / And
after this in like wise for to speak of the the other tweyne.

Of the sad auyse that is couenable for a young prince for to have* Capitulo.
vii.
THe good prince that loves god / will be frede to do any thing what someuer
it he against the reverence and commandment of god / and will pain him self
to know all things that him ought to do / And all such thyng^ as him ought
not to do / And by the learning of this he shall perceive and know his
fragylyte and that he is a man mortal. subject to short life passyoned with
mortal things. Naturell and ^^eell as another man without any dyfference /
except the goods of fortune / But when he shall study the law of god to be
well enfourmed therein like as a good christian man ought to be / he will auyse him
self well upon y^ perell of these goods for hurtynge of his scule. That is to
wete if he use them not well he is lost / And that he does by the great
lordshyp that he occupyeth / is not else but an office transytory / and of
little during and that he must needs leave it in short time. That is to know
by way of death / which is derke and a fere full passage / and the count that
he must yield before that Judge that no thing is hyd fro* which will reward
every man after his deseruynge. ^han if the prince remember this (...)he shall
find matter ynought for to preyse but little these worldly worshyppes and
goods. which ben so full of peril and solyt^ll while during / All such
thoughts and remem braunces* every good prince ought to have in his heart /
which shall cause to defend him self against the great arreysynge of Pride
and mysknowynge his person / But yet for all this ^^then that our lord has
chosen them to the office of l^^^shyp / they ought to meynteyne it by worldly
wisdom and discre^syon moral ^^en may he think that he shall rewle and
govern the law like a prince with good and virtuous manners. And also he must
be dylygent in all things that longs to the comen well of his Realm and to
keep them in peace to his power. And also he should use so dyscretely his
honors and magnyficienc^ that be^ given to him / in such wise that his heart
be not empeched nor arreysed on heyght against his god. This good prince as
gods vycary in earth must take heed with a great heart to ye well of the
Church to that intent that his creature ought to be served dewely as far as
his reason may give him. And if there fall any dyscorde by the Instygacyon of
the devil our enemy he ought to make peace what labor that ever he take
therefore. And that he take good head also to the promocyons of his mynysters
that they make no request for none of his servants / nor none other though
he love him never so well / in less than he understand that he be a clerk /
A good man and able to serve god in that prebende that he desires. And of this
he ought to enquere dylygently. or that he give it / or else he charge
greatly his conscience / and is cause of their dampnacion that been promoted by
him to their benefyces / and be not able thet to as it is found in the
decrees. But now a days / there is no such rewle kept / and that is great
pity. For god knows if that suffycyau^ce of clergy / or a good man and of
Just life be now a days the causes of the promocyons of clerks / Certeynly
nay. but often times they ben given by means of flaterynge / by adulacyon. and
other wickedness. and by the prayers of lords. And so it apperyth by the
ruin of the ship with what wind it is smyten. For the false couetyse is the
^^cheson of their promocyons. And this causes them to fall in great and
horrible error and so blinded in the Chur che / that it is marvel without
gods mercy that ever it may be in rest and peace. for the foul Symony and
other inconuenyentes that fall there to / Alas and as our lord Ihesu criste
says in the Euangelye speaking to the Pharysees. The queen of Saba that came
out of far countrees for to understand the wisdom of Salamon. shall
condemn you / that have with you more than Salamon. and will not know it. So
in like wise the paynems which kept their law (...)yme dylygently and
without trespass in great reverence observing all their cerymonyes*
natwithstandyng that they were false and reproved of god may be in reprefe to
christian men / which observe not and keep not their laws that been so holy* Is
it not written of these ancient paynems that they had so great devotion to
their Idols and gods / that they were so dylygent and curyous in all things
/ that all manner ordynaunces and stablysshynges that they made were well kept:
And also the prcestes that did the sacryfyces should be men of feyre and honest
life. And if they were found in the contrary / they were punysshed right
egerly* And they were so streytly taken head upon that they would not suffer
them to fail of their service / nor in no wise to be vycyous / And as valere
says that was right well showed at Rome as it is declared in the first
chaptre of his book / how it happed upon a time that the chaplet fill down of
one of the preest^ he des which did the obseruaunces of their sacryfyce /
which chapelet was a propre raiment that they used at that time* like as we
might say a mytre And for because he was so ne clygent that his chapelet fell
so fro him at the time of their service / they thught he was not worthy to keep
that off ye / and so they deposed him: And in like wise they did by a virgyne
that was yelden in to a temple of one of their goddesses which was called Uest
a and for because that this virgyn that was as men might say a Nun was
neclyge^t to: ache head of a lamp that should at no time be left vn^^ght / and
for by cause that oones it was not attended with oil it happed to be quenched
/ she was to greueusly punysshed therefore and deposed of her office. And many
other ensamples I cowde show you of their sad rewles that were kept among
them and I had any leyser / But now a days among us here there ben many of
our pontyfy^alles and priests in which is seen openly great plente of
horrible diffaut / And there is nopryn ce ne none other man that will ones
repreue them of their defautes / but such there be that excuse them self or
they be accused and say they be men and none aungelles / And that it is y^
nature of man for to sins Alas such ben no men for the body of man is but a
little vessel / which may be filled with a little thing but they be very
deuylles and swolowers of hell For like as the moutne of hell may never be
satisfied nor filled / though it receive never so much. no more may their desy
res be fulf^ylled no stau^chyd for ye great coueryse yt is in them and the
great delyt^ for which cause all evil thing is common to them and the words
of valere may well be veryfyed in them / that says / what manner thing is y^
may it aunche the insa^ya ble man from couetyse / So than y^ good paynce ought
to take heed to al these thing / ^^r though so be that the correccion of people
of the church lies not alloonly in him no lo^geth not to him / yet where is
y^ prelate be he never so gre^^e other p^^est in clerk y^ durst with say or
murmur against ye prince* though he rebuke of his hyghnes the vices and sins
of such people / And over this y^ good prince ought to take good head that the
temple and the house of god be not pollutyd n^ fowlyd by die uers sins done
there in / like as our christian men do now^ a days / as Merchant and other
estat / which have no sha me to hold their Pariymentes of their wo^^dly
matters and god knows they make many false contractes* And yet our lord Ihesu
criste spoke to such folks in the gospel. When he said / will ye make of y^
temple of my fader which is an house of prayer / a house o^ a ca^e of th^u^s or
a place of erthly thing yet more over to our damp^acpon / The order y^ the
payne^s (...) as valere ^^cordeth unto y^ same purpose of y^ (...) that the
Romans had to they: gods / speaks of (...) that is to know of two du^ and
prync^ of Rome which were with a great hooste in strange land / but for by
cause oonly that they hylde the counsel of their ordinance in the temple.
The senatoures of Rome, that is to say ye great counseyle of the soueraygnes
deposed them of their offices / not withstanding that they were passing
worthy and worcester shypfull men / And in like wise they did by another prince y^
was called Fabius maximus which was a^ o^de famous knight in arms / and was
deposed from ye highest office of prince that was in (...) me / that is to say
of ye office that was called dictatour* for from all otther princes men might
after their ordynaunce^ and statute appele to the hight estate of the
dictatour. And further than that* there might no man appele / and he was
deposed for no thing else / but for because that he h^ro^ certain questyons
in the temple of diverse things / and in like wise / they deposed ^ayns ^^myns
from his ryalte^ which was right a great cheuetayne of men of arms / But alas
now a days they be not deposed that make their Parlymentes and assembles in
the church / but makes the church as foul stables for horses.

Of the obseruaunces and the law that a good prince ought to hold. Capitulo.
viii.
^^e good prince y^ leueth god ought to have ye great co^ mau^^ement / in his
mind / and how the high name of god ought not to be taken in vein / And
therefore he should make a cry / in all his land by the which he should
diffende on pain of great punyssyon / that no manner of man should customably
swertue forsake his creator* Alas / it were great need now a days / in
France that such a cry were made* For this horroure is so great and
universal among the people of the inreuerence of their creature / that
vi^^eth there (...) other langage be it in game or ernest but swear horribly at
the affirmacion of every word by the torments of our lords pas syon / which
is our redemptour / and Reyne and forsake god / I believe that the paynems in
old time had been full loathe for to have sworn so by their Idols and gods.
All such manner things the good prince ought to defend. For it is contrary
and reprouable to the Relygyon of all cristenmen. And it may be cause to get
gods wroth and the subversion of ^eames and countries / where that it
reygneth / as it is contained in diverse prophecyes / And thus every good prince
that lo ueth god ought to keep and observe dylygently y^ law dyuyne and the
holy establysshyngs in these thing and ^t all other that been worshypfull and
devout which I leave to declare at this time for lack of leyser and shortness
of time. And for by cause also that much speaking of this matter noyeth some
fol kes* which deyneth not to observe and keep these things before rehearsed.
^ut the good prince that keeps this / the good lord above will dyffende him
and keep him and encreate him in virtue both of body and soul. And why should
not he have the tayth in that almighty and just lord. when y^ paynems had a
trust and an hope that by their gods they were rele^yd and greatly set up as
it apperyth by that / that valere reco^mendeth of ye Cite of Rome in so much as
they had so great will to the service of their gods. And says thus* ou(...)
has set aside all manner things for the service of the gods. And also
these things oonly that kept the worship and the soueraygne mageste / that is
to say of ye Emperors / for they had a very believe that in wynnyng of these
worshyppes to their gods they gate the rewle and governance of all ye world
/ And therefore ye Emperoures of our cite and all other generally have not be
weary nor neclyge^t to serve trewelyth it ^^ddes / So this suffyceth at this
time as for the first point ^^ our first party / which speaks how that y^
virtue of princes ought to be first founded and showed in that / that he should
serve and bread god.

How that a good prince ought to be ressemblyd to a good shepeherde* Capitulo.
ix.
^Nwe we have towched in y^ first point* where upon the bounte of the prince
ought to be pryncypally foun ^ed. And here after we must speak of the second
point / that is to know that the good prince ought to love * yngulery the
common well / and the encreace thereof more than of his own* after the doctrine
of Arystotyle*whiche is declared in his bo ^e of polytykes / that says that
tyra^nye is when a prince gets more goods for his own profit / then for
the common well And that is also against the lordshyp Royal for he ought to be
more dylygent to encreace the well of his commons than his own well* Now it
must be deuyled in what manner he may ^lande and show this love* The good
prince that loves his land must keep his people dylygently after the
ensample of a good Shepeherde / which kepyth well his sheep and makes good
watch by great dilygence for to defend them from the wolf and other evil
beestes / and that they be clenly kept and in health to that intent. that they
may encerace and frutyfye and yield their wolle hoole and sound* and made
fat by the e^the by y^ which they be norysshed and kept / So that the
shepeherde may be well paid of the fleces gadred in season* But the great
rich shepeherde that gives great good to keep his sheep / for because he may
not keep all his flokes him self purueyeth him of help good and couenable /
and takes with him good dylygent. and wise servant / which he knows w^ll
that they ben true and love his profit / Then he ordeyneth that these men
should be well garnysshed of good and mighty hounds well colered with iron.
which hounds ben well wont to chase the wolfes out of y^ feldes / and at night
they leave them untied to keep the sheep / to that intent that the thieves come
not preuely for to stele them / but that anon they be ready to run upon them
/ And in the day time they tie them to their gyrdelles about them while y^
sheep pasturen peasybly in the feldes* But and it happen that the said
servants here any noise of wolves or any other evil beestes coming out of
the woods or from the mountains / Than anon they let lo^ose their hounds
and let them run and comfort them strongly and for to give them the more
hardynes / they run after their hou^des with good staves well pyked with iron
against the wolves or other evil beestes / and if it happen that any of the
sheep go out of the flock / the good hounds which ben well wont thereto
ronneth after and fe cheth him i again without doing him any harm. And by
these means the wise servants diffende them and keep them so well that they
yield a good accounte to the soueraygne she peherde which takes right good
heed to their rewle^ In like wise to our purpose / is the good prince. Which
is always besy and dylygent for the saufgarde and y^ dyffence of his country and
of his people *to the which saufgarde and diffence is not possible that his
own person may be in every place where charges lies in* Therefore he should
puruey to get him good help as well for the feet of knyghthode as other
ways That is to know of worthy cheueteynes y^ he knows for good and true
and such as loves him tenderly* as Counstable / marchall Amyrall* and other
men* to y^ which he gives charge unto / to make prouysyon of good men of arms
well used and learned in the werre / which he byndeth them by their oath to be
about him* and depart not without his leave but be ready always to do his
commandment. to that intent / if it be need that they be ready for to go
against their enemies *so that the country be not dyffowled nor the people
robbyd ne slain.

It is not to understand that the men of arms them self should diffowle and
pyle the country like as they do in Frau^ ce now a days. wherefore as in other
countries they durst not do so* which is a great myschefe and an ouerthwarte
ordynaun ce* that they that been stablysshed and ordained for the defense of the
people. They them self pyle them and rob them full cruelly / such there ben
that without killing or setting their howses a fire y^ enemies might do no
more to them. This is not the ryghtfull means of werre which ought to be
Just and without extorcion / But the men of werre and the princes that send
them to werre / so on the people ben in great peril y^ the wrath of god fall
not upon them and grievously to punysshe them. For it is no doubt that the
cursynge of the people / right fully given by suffrynge of to great oppressynge
/ may cause before god many evil auentures for to fall* like as we find
ensample in holy wryt and in many other places. For every man ought to know
well that god is ^ust and rightful / And this great fault comes but of evil
ordinance. For and the men of werre were well paid* men might charge them in
pain of death that they should take no manes good unpaid for / And by such
means men should find vytayles and all other things enough* that were
necessary and great chepe enough and pleute / me think it is a great
marvel* how the people may live under this ordinance* and of the pity of
their life there is no compassion. Now the holy ghost fader of the poor people
have mercy on them and byset them. ^ow to y^ purpose aforesaid* if a shepeherde
had an hou^de that would run upon his sheep* anon he would give him a great
stroke with his staff Then it is not sitting for a good prince that loves
god and his people / to suffer his people to be robbed and pyled / and like as
the hounds lie vnbounden in ye night to keep the sheep from thieves in like
wise the cheueteynes ought to set watch and espyes upon the Frounteres and to
send far about them to that intent / that the country and the people be
not stolen upon the night with thieves / nor by no manner of cautele. And also
that they may understand the couyne of their enemies: yet there longs
another office to the men of arms. and that is this / like as the good hounde
gets again the sheep that is gone out from the flock / in such wise ought
they to bring in ye poor commons if they would err or fall in evil will of
rebellyon outher by manaces or else yt they take good heed of them. And for
because that it might dysplease / and be marvel to some men / that a man
should lyken ye office of arms to the nature of an hounde Certainly the hounde
has many propretees. which a good man of arms ought to take heed of / and
he like unto ^or the hounde loves his master meruaylously well / and is full
true unto him / And in like wise it is necessary to the good man of arms
dyspose him self to the dyffence of his master for to dye therefore / And when
he is committed to have the keeping of any place / He hereth clearly and
watches anon / and makes him ready for to god upon the evil doers and
robbers / but they will not byte the friends of his master / but smells them
naturally / nor his neighbors / nor them that been of the howseholde which
he is norysshed in ^^ut to his power he will keep them / Also an hou^de is
right hardy and feyghteth with great virtue. Also he is of great understanding
and of great knowledge / and right loving to him that shows him love / And
all these condycyons the good man of arms ought to have.

yet of the same.
BUt for to come again to our first purpose like as it is said of the good
Shepeherde which takes good head that his sheep be kept clean and ^helth. The
good prince may not at all times put the hole rewle unto his mynysters But he
him self like a man that is benygne / ought to here them in all causes as
far as he may. And he should not doubt nor dispreyse t(...)tuous supplycacions
of his people / but he ought benygnely to condissende to their requests /
after mercy and Justice. Also he ought to take heed that they be not diffowled
nor eten by false off years and mynysters / And for to speak clearly of this
purpose / a man must have great leyser and space and it might happen so that if
a man would say the troth of many things. it should displese diverse folks /
But withouten doubt it is great pity / that such truth should be hid and
kept close for any feer or favor of any person / And to this purpose Seneke
speaks well. in the. vi. book of benefyces in the. xxi. chaptre / I will show
the he says. Wherein they be disceyued that be lift up to great estate / And
what lacks to them that men wene have all? No thing else / but they can not
find no man that will tell them truth. And this sentence is true. For the
servants that been about ye princes say not well of them, but oonly for their
own synguler profytes. wherefore they entende no thing but to flatery and
speak to the plesaunce of lords. And so by their teyre langage they blind
their soueraygnes. Therefore it is written in the third book of Polycratyque in
the. xii. chaptre. that the flaterer is enemy to all virtues / and that he is
fastened as a nail in the man's ^ye that he is aqueynted with. And to the
purpose of these officers: that is to know of the evil and except the good
without much speaking of their deeds I will not make to long process thereof.
But would god that ye princes knew them well and understood their deeds and
what people they have about them for mynystracyon of their things* And me
thinks there is nothing that is so foul ne so cor rupte as is the conscyens
of some of them in all peruercytes / but there ben many that can by great
malice / hyde subtelly their vices under feigned symulacyon / and under a fair
color* But and it so be that they can not hyde ye experyence of their deeds /
and of their words / i which as fair as they seem / there is no truth in
them / nor will not she we outward the open peruersyte to them that falls in
their dangers / and in their ho^des* Nor also it can not come to y^ knowledge
of their lords. And also no man dare tell them for fere that the lord would
be dyspleased with them that tells him y^ truth / for lords now a days
will not here evil spoken of their men / for there is a common word that
renneth now in the country for to say* ^y lord has a right good condycyon
with him for he loves no man that will tell him an evil tale of his ser
uaunte* Alas it were a good guyse for the lords for to here and understand ye
rule of their servants. But and it happened that any man for Envy accused
another as it may happen some time to fall / than when the lord had well
inquired the troth and fyndeth his accusacyon false / then he ought to pu
nysshe him and put him out of his house as a false liar / and an ^nuyous man*
And by this mean / their fol^es ^^lde d^ede for to do or say evil* and it
should sease much ang^^ trouble that is done. But the lord should have will
that every of his subjects should do their offices in peace which god has
called them to* The nobles* like as they ought to do. The clargy attend their
science and to their deuyne ser u yer* The marchau^ tes to their marchaundyses.
The men of craft to their occupacyon. The laborers to their labor: And
^^eu^ry man in his degree to live with good polycy without doing on y^r ^^^yon
nor dyshonest charge to that (...) y^ they may live couenably under him / and
that they may love him as they ought to love a good prince. and yt he may have
of them y^ reuenes yt ought reasonably to be gadered in his country without to
great oppressynge of his poor comyns / like as Ualere says. That the
Emperor ^beryus answered ones to them / y^ said to him / why he set no
gretter subsydy on his people for he might well do it / he answered and said /
it longs quod he to a shepeherde to shere his sheep at one season in the year
/ but not to flee him nor teere his skin / in such wise that the blo de come
after.

The love that the good prince ought to have to his subjects. Capitulo. x.
THere we must se a little of the right of the prince after the laws. That is
to were if the good prince may set any new imposycyon or subsydy upon his
people above his de meynes for any cause in ye world. And me seems yt the
laws gives license enough and grants that the prince may do it in some
case. Notwithstanding it should be done as syldome as it might. And for to
know for what cause it should be done / it is to understand / for the defense
of his land against his enemies / if so be that he be assailed by the war /
for ye whi che he must hold men of war under wages for the defense of the
land. Also for maryenge of his children / or for getynge them out of prison /
if they be in that case. and for these causes specially he may set a subsydy
upon his subjects without of fendynge of the law. But yet it ought to be done
with great compassyon and dyscrecyon for y^ leest charge of the people y^ might
be. and that he take no more than is necessary for the same cause that he
set it for. and in this case / the rich ought to supporte the poor. And not
that the rich to be excused nor exempte / Like as it is now a days / and
that the poor folk be so much more charged / for ^dare say who so ever be
dyspleased there with / that is a great marvel saving their reverence yt the
great and rich officers of the king or of other princes which have their
great estate and power of ye king and of the lords / and that may well bear
the charges / that they should be except. And the poor men that have nothing
of the king / he bound to pay. And how may this be by rea son / if I have
given a great good to one of my servants for to maynteyne his life honorably
/ and it happened that a need fell unto me / ought not he to help me sooner in
my dystresse than he that had never nothing of melyt is a strange custo me
now a days that is used in this royalme / In the teate of tails or
imposycyons which ben sette^ for the poor men pay and the rich go free. But
who that would do well should break this and make it to be borne euenly. Not
that some of ye gre te men pay and some not. Nor of such things would arise
enuytees. For it should seem a manner of a bondage and a dyspraysynge to them
that pay it. But and it were brought that every man should pay / then should
there be no reproach / yet notwithstanding I hold not with that / that they
that follow the war for the defense of the land / but that they should be
exempte And this that I say for the poor people / compassyon has moved me
for the great wepynges and syghynges that comes bytterly from their hearts.
^or some of them there be that when they shall make their payment of this
money which they be set unto / they must fast and fare evil afterward /
the poor man and all his household / and feign for to sell their bed and
their other things as good as for nou ght. A would god that the king and the
noble princes of france were well enfourmed of this great myschyefe.

For then I would not doubt / for the great noblesse that is in their blood /
they would not suffer this great hardenes and sorrow among the people* But it
happens often times that there ben such that he receyuours of this y^ is
gadered / which ben great fat and rich / and wheder that all this good y^
is gadered come to the profit for that y^ it is gadered for / god knows /
and so knows other men* And without fail if su che goods be gadered for to
be employed in superfl^yte / and for other causes than for pure necessyte like
as I have said before / it is great sin to them that set it / and a grievous
hurt And now to the purpose that has been said here tofore of the noble
Romans which were paynymes and mysbyleuers yet they governed them so well /
that it ought to be ensample to us / as Ualere says / for he tells y^ the
law of Rome was suche^ That all manner of goods y^ were gadered for y^ war
should not be employed / but only to the use of that same / that it was
ordained to (and in no wise to be dyspended upon super fluyte of estate / for
superfluyte of wynes and meets taken more than is necessary causes the body
more to desire rest / than the travail of the war* Now I wylleue at this
time to speak any more of this purpose / Notwithstondynge I could say much
more / but for because that the sentence of such ma ters please not the evil
mynystres which ben made rich by this means / and will also blame me
therfores I may say to them without boost like as ^ryppydes that was a great
^^^ t^ said unto them of Athenes / which prayed him y^ he wold^ put out a
sentence of a tragedy y^ he had mades Tragedy val^ re says it is a manner of a
dyte that blames things that be^ euylldone in order of polycy of the comontye
or of princes / and said he made not his dytyes to blame ne to be blamed / but
to that entente that it should enduce and styre men to good living And yet
Ualere says more of y^ same poet* that he would not put himself such wise
under / that he would obey the senten ce of the people / and leave his own
sentence. And upon this Ua lere says / for certain says he / feaute is to be
allowed that is drawn and comes out or reason. And says also that he that
has so great reason may Judge the truth of his own w^r ke / so that it be
not done with pride ne boost / but in susteynyn ge the merit of his thing
which he understands is worshypfull and lowable / For he says /
whopray^eth another y^ he sees virtuous / desires to have himself praised /
for both comes of one case and of one like wisdom.

Ensample of ancient deeds to the purpose before said. Capitulo. xi.
^^r to make conclusyon of that is said before. That is to wete that the good
prince should love more the well of his people than his own propre / and that
he sh^lde not set* ^ much by the goods that be gadered for his synguler
profit we will yet call the Romans to our ensample and it be ^he words of
Ualere. The right worthy Romayne princes says he had their hertes somoche in
the love of the common wel^ / and set solytel by their own / that for very
need they might not mary their own daughters / but of the propre dyspen^es of
y^ commons / for they spared not somoche that they had whereof to give them so
largely as accorded for their euate: And ^^ like wise when they were paste out
of this world their d^^tes and their absequyes of the grettest of them* as of
the worcester thy Fabrycyus / and also of Scypys Auffryquant / which were passing
famous men* And also of other solemp^e conqueroures / and other princes of Rome
which had rule of the commons goods paid them / to the which all the
commons were well as^ented / for the merit and contemplacyon ^. the great
honors and worshyppes that they had done unto the cite before time. For the
worshypfull men themself had no thing to make acounte of / but only of
their great and solemn ^ne acts which they did in their days. F^r though so
we re that they were not rich of the goods of fortune / yet were they rich
of the right great and noble honors which they had deserved before time.
^herfore it seems and true it is / y^ the most worthy be not at all times
most tyche nor best fortuned to richesse / but fortune helps them by another
manner which is more worshypfull / when she helps them for to get sovereign
renown and worship / for notwithandynge the ^o uerte of these worthy
couqueroures and noble men / ^et were they dyctatoures or consules that is as
men might say ^m peroures / or the most sovereign princes which received y^
tryumphe gloryously diverse times / which was a meruay ^o^s great worship that
the ^omaynes did to their princes or soueraynes / when they had won great
vyctoryes / as it shall be declared here after what thing the tryumphe shol de
be. For in those days virtue was their richesse. And at To me the courage of
men and women was right vygorous / and who that was most virtuous most had of
dygnyte / for me^ looked not after at that time what every man was worth in
richesse / but how much he was worth in goodness and cun nynge / he was most
auctorysed that surmounted in virtues wherefore Ualere said these fair words.
Such things re consyleth and Joins the affynyte of lords / such things
have power within and without. For by this ordinance eve ry man intended for
the profit of the common welthe / and not for his own synguler welthe / seeing
that the princes had lever be poor in a rich empire tha^ to be rich and
plenteous in a poor country. And therefore such guerdon was granted to them
y^ the noblemen were soceured by y^ goods of the commons. And sith we be entered
in the purpose of these noble Romayne princes how y^ their noble virtues might
and ought to because of ensample and myrroure to all good princes and worcester
shypfull men / yet Ualere says. ^e will speak of another worcester shypfull consule
/ which was called Marcus ^urynus / whi che was a great conqueroure / and gate
many great lordshyppes to the Romans. But on a time when he was at seege
before the cite of ^amary / the spies of y^ same cite reported how^ this Marcus
sat but in right poor estate at the seege / but of men of arms he had
ynowe / Nevertheless of vessel / of richesse / ^ne of vytayle he had no
plente. Than anon they of the cite sent messen ^ers to him with great gifts
for they supposed to overcome him with y^ / and the answer of him Uale re
puts in writing for declaracyon of his great constaun ce and worthynes /
and says Marcus ^urynus which was a cle re morroure by the holy rule of
attemperaunce and polysshed in virtues / would y^ the messengeres of Samary
should se what meet y^ he ete / and how he sat upon a form before y^ fire
and was served with little meases in treene dysshes / yet notwithstondynge y^
he refused the gifts which were great sommes of gold and silver and of rich
vessel. And he answered them and said / y^ he loved better to be master over
riches / tha^ riches should be master over him / than him seemed y^ he was
master over riches / in as much as he refused it. But and he had re ceyued
and taken ^^ he thought himself that he had been ouerco me. And remember you
right quod he / that Marcus will not be overcome with no gifts / nor by battle
if he may. This Marcus ^uryus was so worthy a man that he dyscomfyted the
king Pyrrus which came to the rescowes of the Cite of Tarente against the
Romans / and the said ^yrrus had in his army. xxiiii. thousand men on fot^
/ and. xxvi. thousand then on horse back / of the which was slain. xxx.
thousand. and there was taken. xiii. thousands And Pyrrus himself fled in
to Italy* The first year of his wars the Romay nes wanne much good / but
the worthy prince would never en rich himself / but gave the good and parted
it among his knights and his men of war except that that he sent to^ Rome
/ there to be kept for treasoure of the cite / and as for himself / the
worship suffysed him / and would that other had the profit and the winning. ^
Also among other princes Ua lere commends the great virtue of a worthy
consule called Fabrycyus / which I have spoken of heretofore / which
semblably was of so great virtue that notwithstanding he had no richesse of
fortune / yet he refused tyght great and notable gyf tes y^ the said king
Pyrrus sent him / hoping y^ he should overcome him thereby. And it was y^ same
Fabrycyus of which men speak of the great worship and lawde that the king
Pyrrus his adversary said of him / which was a worshypfull and a fair word
when he said* that the Sone should ra there lose his light than Fabrycyus his
truth / for the physycyan of Pyrrus came to Fabrycyus and said unto him /
that and he would quyte him well his labor* he would enpoyson his master.
But this worshypful man answered / that such manner of conquerynge the Romans
used not. And so took y^ physycyan and sent him to king Pyrrus / for the
which boun te and virtue of his truth he loved him so well that he sent unto
him / and said / that he would for his sake make peace with the Romans / and
would never grieve them more / with that that they would suffer him to have in
peace that land that he had conquered of the Romans* But to that peace this
worcester shypfull man would not consent in less than / Pyrrus would depart from
all the demeynes of the foresaid Romans. Then did this Pyrrus all his power
for to draw Fabrycyus upon his party / and be with hold with him / and when
he saw y^ he might in no wise get him the praised so much his virtue y^ he
said he would never fight against hy^ in a field and yet were y^ batayles ready /
but he went his way unto tarente And yet Ualere speaks more of this Fabrycyus
and says y^ there was told in his presence how there was a Philosopher i
Athenes that sewe a seed upon a manner of leuynge / in such wise that he said
/ that men should do nothing but only for their delight / and for their bodily
ease / and this worthy man dispraysed much this doctrine / and held it for a
folysshe and a dyshonourable conceyte / and said / that all manner of delytes
and they were not labourous in virtue ought to be dyspraysed / not only of the
body / but as well of the soul* But they y^ have the good virtues and delight
in them / ben to commend* And his sentence was true as Ualere says as it
appeared open ly / for the cite of Athenes that was wont to be governed by the
labor and study of wisdom and virtue / as soon as it was wrapped in delytes
and lusts / lost his lordshyp / also the cite of Rome as long as it hau^ted
y^ virtuous exercise overcame and gate and surmounted all other lordshyppes /
and how that Athenes lost his virtue hereafter ye shall know / yet to our
purpose of the good prince which loved the common well of his loud: There was
a king in Athenes that was called Epamymydas which was a man of meruayious
great virtue and held his enemies gretely under him / and at the last as he
was in a battle he happed to be smyten thrughe y^ body with a spear / and when
that he should dye / he had so great Joy that he had overcome his enemies that
his death grieved him not: Then he said to them that were about him / now has
the gods given me such grace / that I may se my cite of ^hebes the chyefe
cite of (...)ce: And the great and coura gyous cite of Lacedemone^is put under
by our worthynes in ^rmes / and I dye not without air / for I leave you. ii.
daughters which I have begoten. And this he mente by two great ^ytees which
he had conquered. For he had no hair of his body but he understood y^ by the
conquest of these two cytees / his na me should be always had in memory / like
as by the children the fader. This Epamymydes loved Just ye meruaylously well.
The lordshyppes that he gate / he gate them not for himself / but for the
encreace of his land / for he was so little covetous upon good / that when he
was deed / men could not find whereof to do his obsequyes. And also he was as
little a boster / as he was a covetous man. And he bare his estate so tem
perately that another of these points was showed in him / bu^ they showed by
him. This is to say that his virtue surmoun ted al other / she wynge outward.
And the reason that he had in his life / he lost it not at his death as Ualere
says. For when he was brought home to his lodging as good as half deed / and
his spyryte was comen a little to him again / he asked of the^^ that were
about him / whether his enemies after y^ he was felled took his shield fro him
or nay. And when he herd that they had it not / he was pas^ynge Joyful / and
made it to be brought unto him. And when he had it / with a manner of myrthe he
killed it. And asked of the manner of the vycto ry. And when it was told him /
he said y^ all things went well. And anon he passyd out of this world / by
the which d^ the / the men of Athenes which often times had proved his
force and virtue / became ydell and were in test / and were occupied but with
vanytees. For which cause they fell in too myschyefe and dystruccyon.

Here after follows the cause why Ualere is so great ly aledged in this book.
Capitulo. xii.
FOr because of the noble book y^ the great Ualere made of the worthy deeds of
Romans gives me matter to prove by ensample ye clean entencyon which I
labor in / as it is showed here tofore / in gyuynge cause to styre coura ges
to virtue and good living / as well to princes / knights and nobles as the
common people. I aledge him more than any other auctoure. For the same Ualere
says / that virtue moves a man more to desire honor and worthynes / and to
here good ensamples / than does y^ simple and feeble words. And this
witnesses ^^ystotle in y^. x. book of Ethyques. And there fore in she wynge the
style of that noble auctoure Ualere for to encreace the courages of them y^
list to here the works of ver tuous doctrine / by the which men get very
worship. I am moved to show here diverse ensamples of things that been fallen
to diverse worthy men in times passed / for their deserts set in mind in the
same book / which gives great plea saunce to y^ noble courages of them y^
should here it / in trustyn ge thereby to get great worshyppes. For which
honors / ver tue is to be desired. For we se that honor belongs to all
solemn and excellent things / as in cunning and virtue. And for as much
as I call these Romayne princes worthy co^querours and other y^ may be like
the^ / though they be no pryn ces / nor may not be / for as much as they have
not so great lo^des and richesse. Nevertheless after the style of Ualere* It is
showed that the Romans reputed the gretnesse of worshyppes and worthynes in
virtue / and not in goods / he calls them not only princes / but calls
them in his book Emperoures / like as it appears in diverse chapytres / as of
Scipre / Affrycan / the great Pompee / ^ylla / and other / and yet were they
never ^^peroures made.

O^ y^ lyberalyte in princes and example of y^ Romans. Ca. xiii.
Athen we will contyne we our matter by approba cyons of ensamples longing to
the samelyer to a virtuous good prince upon the second point of the three
things which ben necessary to him / y^ is to wete y^ he should love y^ common
well* The good prince which y^ loves the universal goods from his ^he ought
to have lyberalyte / for it is to him a thing passing necessary / and by the
having of that he shall be profyted in terryble wise* That is to know for the
wealth of his sou le / if it be dysc^etely done. Secondely to his great honor
and renown* Thyrdely in that y^ he shall draw to him as well the courage of
his own people as of staungers / for it is no doubt that there is nothing
that profyteth more a prince tha^ lyberalyte with dyscrecyon* O how much did
it ones profit to y^ Romans wha^ the legates of them of Cartage were come to
Rome for to bye again their prisoners which were taken in the batayles and
wars among them* For y^ To maynes gave al y^ prisoners again freely to y^
legates y^ were sent for them / without payenge of on y ransom / which we
^^ right worthypfull men in their flowers* And also of great au^to: yte to the
nombre of a thousand seven hundredth and four and forty / wherefore Ualere
magnefyeth gretely this lybera lyte in three things and says: O lord god
says he ^how mer uaylous a lyberalyte was it / that they would let go from
the^ so many great enemies / and l^ue so great goods as they my ^ht have had
for them / I suppose quod he that y^ legates that came for them had great
marvel of their great largess / then he said* O the great magnyfycence of
Romans / egall to y^ benygnyte of gods For that deed was more plenteuous
tha^ your enemies could have desired / wherefore it is no doubt y^ for because
of their great lyberalyte the Romans gatemany lordshyppes and dom ynacyons as
many or mo than they gate by force of arms. For many strange countrees seeing
their great fredome and worshypfull custom yielded them to the Romans / not
trust ynge to be made as servants / but to be made more free. And Ualere
witnesses the same / saying that the Empire of Rome that is to say / the
lordshyp was not so gretely encreaced by the strength of their bodies / as it
was by the might of their courages and yet in more praysynge of lyberalyte
which ought to be in princes / and also of their mekenes / Ualere says word
by word like as Ifynde in his book that for their beauty and substance /
there may not be given to lyberalyte a more couenable company tha^ humany ^e
and mekenes / for they deserve one manner of laud / for lyberalyte is showed to
them that been poor and nedy / and humanyte shows himself to them that be in
sykenes / and in prison / or in mysease of their body. ^^kenes shows himself
to them that been fallen in myserye / in danger / and peril of their bodies /
or of their goods / and over such as he has lord ship and power to punysshe
and to forgive which myleryes for to pardon and as^wage the great greues that
they be unbe under the grace of the prince / wherefore every good prince is
bound if he will use any goodness to heel his poor subjects with great
compassyon / by the virtuous means above said / keeping always the order of
Just ye / not to rygorously / and specially in such things as be not
contrary to nature. And though so be says Ualere that thou know not which
of all these virtues is most to be allowed / yet it seems y^ it is most
sovereign that has taken his name of the godhede / and that he says is
lyberalyte / which is as a virtue deuyne / and streteheth to every man / for by
that virtue men get them most friends* And for because it lies more in y^
puyssaunce of princes than of other men for to be lyberall* and also that
friends and well wyllers is to them a thing passing necessary / wherefore he
says it is to them couenable only for y^ encreasynge of their glory ^yke as
it is written in ^olycratyque / in y^ third book of the same in the.xiiii.
chapter of ^ytus y^ ^mpereure / whi che by his lyberalyte ^ourged the vice of
^uaryce that was in his fader in such manner that he was called of all men /
the love and delytes of all men's lygnage. And ^ullyus says in the second
book of offices. ^here may be no gretter vice in a prince / or in him that
governs the common welthe then ^uetyse / But for because that we say so
much that every good prince ought to be lyberall / It is necessary for to
show in what manner / and in what things he ought to be lyberall where upon
Senecke declares in the second book of beny^yces / and says. The prince or
he that will give / ought too understand and know the puyssaunce and the
auctoryte of himself that is the gyuer. And also the state of him that he will
give unto. To that entente that he should not give a less^ gift than were
according to his honor. Nor all so a gretter gift than were necessary to
him / that should receive it. And the prince / or the gyuer ought to consider
to whom and why he gives that gift. For there is a dyfference in gyuyn ge to
a man that has deserved it / from a man that the pryn ^^ list to give by his
fredome and courteysye. For and a man have deserved it / the prince ought well
to se that the gift be ^uche that he be not blamed in no nygardyse / nor in no
cayty^en^sse / and yet it must be done much upon the largess after ^^ the man
has deserved it. But when the gift is given without merit or deseruynge /
though so be that it long to a prince / or other mighty persons to give
great gifts as lon geth to their estate / yet may they give little small
gifts to the poor and nedy persons. and this lyberalyte ought to be moderate
by deed of dyscrecyon. As ^ullyus has said her^ before. ^or let us suppose
that the prince or any other be lyberall and in will for to give / yet ought be
to be well aduysed how he may contynewe in virtue. ^ot only as they y^ give
their goods folely / and departs yt without any order. For the lyberalyte of
their gifts / ought to be of their own goods / and not of other men's. For
as saint Ambrose says in the first book of offices. That may be called
noolyberalyte says he. when a man gives to one and takes from another ^or
there may nothing belyberall but it be Auste. And also for as much as it is
said / that lyberalyte is a virtue deuyne / which longs to every good prince.

And trewely yt longs to every good prince soueraynely to guerdon every man
that has done him good / and showed him love / and he ought not to take heed
of the ^eblenesse of the person if he have done him good se^uyce / ^ut to the
great nesse of his estate / which may right well reward him for his good
deed. ^yke as yt is written of king ^ary o^ ^^t se^ ^ot y^ same king Dary y^
y^ great Alyxandre dyscomfyted but he that entered in to the lordelhyppe by a
cawtelous mean that he made his horse to ney / for because that the Princes
had made such an ordinance. For when they might not accord among
theymselfe / which should be heir unto the king and to govern the royalme.
^hen they made an ordinance y^ they should go forth together erely in y^
mourning before the temple. And whose horse y^ neyed first should be chosen
for king / and this ^ary the night before made led his hor se with a mare in
to the place where the assemble should be on^y morrow / and there the horse
lepte the mare / and on the morrow wh^ the horse came again in to the same
place / anon he began to ney. And so this ^^rye was chosen king of ^^rse.
That same ^arye being in his little fortune / a man that was call led
^hylomytes gave him without any asking a mantell with his good will* ^^t
withstanding that he was a right great negarde. The which mantell pleased
meruaylous gretely to Dary: Then it happened afterward when Dary was king he
forgate not the great courteysy y^ Phyl^mytes had done to him / but gave him
the cite and all the isle of Samos. which was a plenteuous and a good isle / in
the which the philosopher Pyctogoras was borne. But this king Da ry ^xtemed
not the price of the mantell that was given him but only the lyberalyte of the
gyuer / and the puys^aunce also of himself y^ might goodly reward him for his
kyndnes.

Also Mytrydates the passing rich king / which reigned over. xii. countrees
showed great lyberalyte and guerdon ^o one of his knights / which was named
L^on yeus for the getynge him out of prison from the hands of his enemies /
which had taken him before in battle / gave for him great noumbre of
prisoners. For he loved better for to encreace his enemies than men should
think that he would not reward his men that had worshypfully deserved it.

Of the humayne pity in a prince. Capitulo. xiiii.
W^ have spoken enough of lyberalyte in y^ good pryn ce. And now we must
speak of other virtues longyn ge to the same by like merit and lawde / that is
t^ wete of humanyte and mekenes* which ben necessary to be kno wen with every
good prince / and for to prove y^ it is so / we shall show it by exsa^yle. And
first of y^ great humanyte y^ y^ worthy Romayne prince Lucyus Emylyus Publyus
showed unto the king Par^es wha^ he had dyscomfyted him in plain battle / so
vyctoryou^ly that he was taken and led towar* Lucyus* But when he understood
the bringing of this kyn ge Parses? The worshypful man Lucyus went against him
And when he met him / he would in no wise suffer him to kn^ le before him but
took him benygnely by the hand and took him with him arm in arm / and
comforted him and worshypped him / and made him to sytte with him at his board
and in his counsel. Notwithstanding y^ king Parses was full loathe thereto /
and would not by his will have taken so much upon him* But nevertheless this
worthy Lucyus entreated him as he had been his own brother? A what noble virtue
is it in a prince / or in any worthy man of arms to be pyteous and humayne to
them that they have ouercomen and dyscomfyted / as we may have ensample of
E^tor of Troy of whom me^ say / there was never ^yon more fy^rse / ne more
cruel in battle than he was? But anon as he had overcome his enemies and
meked them to him / in yeldynge and cryenge him mercy* ^here was never lamb
more meke nor debonayre than he was / for he would entreat them as gentylly as
they had been his brethren / by the which he was so gretely profyted that for
his deboneyrete diverse people came and yielded them unto him: And so this
condycyon every good prince and worshypfull man ought to have? But not as the
lords and other men of arms do now a days / when they conquer lands and
fortresses Eytees and other places / as soon as they be entered in them / it
seems as they were dogs that were famysshed for hongre / and without any
pity of mordres and horrible occysyons of christian people / dyshonouryn^e the
women and put all to ruin* Alas what hearts have these people to do so cruelly
to their own lykenes / which is against nature and against the law of god /
whether they be not aferde that the fyers deuylles of hell will ^auysshe them
in to the cite infernal / For it is no doubt but they shall come thereto at
the last end? And certainly such people ought rather to bear the figure and
the chere of an horrible serpente / than humayne and pyteous chere / for under
the lykenes of man they bear the great f^lony and cruelte of a wode be* But
Marcus Marcellus which was a prince of Romans and of great auctoryte did
not ^oo. / For when he by his great manhood had won the cite of Syracuse
which was a noble and a strong ^yte / when he was gotten up to the highest
top of the castle for to se the for tune of the cite / and had
consyderacyon of the great st^^^g the that it was of / and how it had been
governed before time with many worthy kings / and how it was wont for to have
great power both by see and by land / and how it was wont fulfilled with
great sorrow and mys^^ yefe / he had such pity upon the desolacyon of his
enemies / that he wept for sorrow.

^et against them that been so cruel and so ^^naturall against their prisoners
for because of ^ouetyse / and for to constrayne them to pay gretter raunsomes
than they may get which is great horroure to se or here the great tourmentes
that some that been cruel and borryble men done to their prisoners / for
^arasynes may do no worse then they do. ^ut and such handgemen dye on good
deth^ / me seems that god and nature do^he them wrong / Nevertheless I
doubt not but that they shall be sore punysshed therefore / for god is Just. A
lord god / so did not that noble and worthy prince Pomp^e which was an
excellent man of arms / for he conquered almoost all the parties of the
ory^ute. But among all other when he had subdued the king ^^gram of ^rmonye /
and taken. xl. thousand of his men / and king ^ygram was brought before him
also / which took of his crown and set it down a^ the ^eete of this noble
Pomp^e / and thought too have ^n^^^^ down before him ^^pynge full tenderly.
This noble Pomp^e would not suffer him but comforted him with all his pow er and
at the last set him again in his estate / under the obeysaunce of y^
^^maynes / for him thought it was as great worship for to make kings / as for
to put them down / and unmake them.

Of meekness and deboneyryte in a Prince Capitulo. xv*
H^re before we have spoken of the humanyte o^ the good prince. And now we
will speak of y^ mekenes that he ought specially to show un to his subjects /
in confourmynge and drawing to him the love of his people / for without any
doubt there is nothing more swetter ne more favorable to a subject / than
for to se his prince benygne and courtey se unto him / nor the prince may not
so well content the hertes of his men and famylyeres with his good / as he
may by his mekenes and benygny^e wisely and dys^retely done / not that he
should be so famylyer / that men should set the less by him and have him in
the less reverence / but in keeping of his honor which of dewetye ought for
to be showed unto him of his subjects / yet ^e ought benygnely to here and
understand their requests and petycyons / and answer them with fair and
sweet words. And for a little mysse deed he ta ke not over great dysdayne
against none of them / For the grett^r and the higher that a tower is the
less it seems by the cast of a little stone. Also in likewise ye shall
understand of ^hylostratus that was Duke or king of Athenes which ^yde a
worship full deed / as ye may understand here after / He had a trusty
friend which he loved entyrely and he was called ^ranlypus ^oo^t happened on a
time as they sat at their souper / this ^ransypus was greatly amoued with an
gre / and said many great Iniuryes and vy^anyes unto Phy lost^atus his lord /
But his noble lord said never an angry word against him / But prayed him
fast that he should not be angrye. ^or that he should not arise from his
souper with anger and wrath. But this ^ransypus was so greatly moved with Ire /
that he spytted in his lords vysage / but for all that / this worthy prince
would not be moved with anger / in his courage / but withdrewe his children
which would ha ue shayne this Transypus / and to avenge the high mageste of
their fader. On the morrow came one unto this worthy prince and said / that
Transypus was as a man out of his mine de for anger and shame of that he had
done and said over even. And like to slay himself. For the which Phylostratus
had great pity* And anon came unto him and cleped him / and comforted him /
and forgave him / and promised him by his faith that he was and should be as
well in his grace as he was tofore* yet more of the good prince Phylostratus /
he had a fay re young maid to his daughter / and a young man that dwelled in
the town loved her so much that he was almoost deed for her sake* ^oo yt
happened on a time that she went with her mother in the town / and the young
man that loved her so well met her of fortune in the street / and he was so
overcome with love / that he might not restrain himself / but sod^ynly went
to her and kyssed her before all the people: The mo der of this maid / which
was wife to Phylostrate would ne des that this young man should be deed for
that offense / and often times styred her lord thereto* But Phylostratus
answered her again full pyteously and said: And we should ma ke them to be
slain that does love us / what shall we do^^^ them that does hate us* And
this was a worshypfull and a pyteous answer* Also of the worthy Pompee that is
spoken of here tofore / It is written that he was of so great virtue and
courage that he would not be lyghtely moved to anger He suffered pacyentely
many Iniures and wrongs that were done unto him by Enuyous people: For
because that he was so curyous in Cunning for too encreace the common welthe*
But for all that / he would never leave too do well. * wherefore it appears to
be true that Ualere says in his third book / in the first chapter of
Sapyence / where he says yt Sapyence is so like to force / that it seems that
it is borne of her or with her. yet may ye se another ensample of y^ right
debonayre and cheualrous king Pyrrus which we have spoken of diverse times
here tofore / he was a man of great courage / and had many virtues / he
worshypped y^ good and honorable persons / like as he showed often times to y^
Romans during the term of wars that was among them* So it happened upon
a time he dyscomfyted y^ Romans / yet was he never the more proud nor cruel
against them / syke as now a days if men have vyctory of their enemies / they
wexe so proud that they can not know god neman / which is a great folly /
for a man should think that fortune dystrybueth often ty mes after her will /
and gives vyctoryes to a man at one time / and at another time tourneth ye
whele* But this Pyrrus for the worthynes that he knew in the Romans would
not leave his noblesse* Notwithstondynge that he had the vyctory / but went
against their enbassadoures / when he understood yt their coming was for to
desire their prisoners and worshypfully received them.

yet of deboneyryte and how fortune may change. Ca. xvi.
YEt to the purpose of the wise / Mekenes of the prince. And also how fortune
may change in a little while we have ensample in that that befell to the said
king Pyrrus / by the which we may conclude for certain / y^ by pride a man
is not enhaunced to good fortune: This king Pyrrus was a great warryoure and a
vyctoryous man over many other princes and kings* And like as fortune did
help him for to conquer and get royalmes and lordshyppes / in like wise she
^oyed and condyted him for to lose them by grievous dyscomfytures / and finally
by battle brought him to his last term / and that was the death / for as he
maynteyned the war in many lands that he had gotten / they of ^rece were so
adradde and so a ferde of him for the great batayles that he had made against
the Romans / and against the ^artagyences that they wyste not well what for to
do. So it happened y^ he went against a cite of Greece that was called
Lacedemone which was a cite of great renown. But at that time it was better
defended and saved from dystruccyon by women than by men / as Ualere says /
for in defense of the same country / there came so great nombre of women /
that of very force Pyrrus must needs depart thens shamefully / and had one of
his own sons slain / which caused him to take right great so row and
heaviness / and so fortune at that time was not his fren de. And when he was
parted from thens / he went before the cite of Arges / and there he was slain
with the cast of a stone and thus ended the king Pyrrus / which had
tourmented ma ny one upon earth. ^elenus sone of ^^tygone which was kyn ge of
^rges made great Joy for the death of Pyrrus and ma de smite of the head from
the body and with great Joy he brought it to his fader. But ^ntygone like a
wise prince blamed him for y^ he made so great Joy for y^ death of so noble a
knight as he was. And for because also y^ he had no pity / seeing ^ great
^reylte of fortune which is never stable / and forthwith he worshypped y^ head
/ and took away the covering of his own h^ de which was covered after ye
manner of kings of Macydone / and with great honor covered the head of Pyrrus
/ and made take the body worshypfully out of the field to be brought unto him /
and forth withal he let bury him with great reverence / and made for him
worshypfull obsequyes after the use and custom in those days / and as the
sone of Pyrrus which was brought unto him prisoner / made clothe him in royal
clothing and bade him take unto him y^ courage of a king / and gave to him y^
ashes of his faders body in a vessel of gold and bade him go ho me again to
the Empire which was his faders kingdom ^^d so it seems to me truly y^ in
the sentence of this story is well comprehended y^ varyau^ce of fortune like as
it is openly declared by Pyrrus / as for yt great lyberalyte / mekenes / and
humanyte. And also of ye worship and honor of this worthy pryn ce which
ought gretely to be reco^mended among other princes before said.
Notwithstondynge it is written in like wy se of Hanyball the Emperor of Affryke
which was a right famous and a manly knight / and had many vyctoryous batayles
against the Romans / and other while he lost. But this same worthy prince
when he had won the vytory of any battle / as he did of many one / he would
an one make search the field And all worthy princes and knights yt were found
deed in y^ battle / he would an one let take and bury them / as well of his
enemies as of his own with great honor and worship / like as he did with
the worthy Romayne prince that was called ^mulus ^aulus / which was slain in
the battle of ^^nes / where was so great occysyon of Romans / that he filled
threpypes full of rings of them that were slain / and sent them home in to
his country / for at that time it was custom that all noble men should were
rings / and though this seem a great marvel / it is no wonder / yet all
these cronyclers and writers of stories records the same. But yt may well
hap pen that the pypes were not so great in those days as they be now /
orelles it was some other measure that was so called at that time. And after
this battle he let nobly bury the body of the said ^mulus Paulus. And in like
wise he did un to another noble Romayne prince / ^^e which was called
^^yberyus Graccus the which was slain also in another batayles and when he
was burnt took the ashes / and gave the to his knights in a vessel of gold
to bear home in to his own countrees and in like wise also she did to Marcus
Marcellus which was slain in another battle / for anon after y^ battle he
made cast rich clothes upon him and burnt him as y^ custom was at that time
/ and set a crown of ^auryer on his head as for a vyctoryous prince / for not
withstanding that he was slain / yet had he won the field upon hanyball But
yet was the noblesse and y^ courage so great of y^ worthy prince Hanyball y^ he
worshypped as well his enemies when they had ouercomen him / as he would be
worshypped wha^ he had ouercomen them. Wherefore Ualere says / that this huma
nyte gave a gretter voice and lawde to Hanyball / ^han the byctoryes that he
had won* For he says y^ he overcame the^ by the malice of ^^fryke / and
worshypped them by the courteysy and the mekenes of Romans.

How a prince should not be proud though fortune favor him never so much*
Capitulo. * xvii.
^Or because we have touched that no man for no mane^ of fortune that might
fall unto him should be proud. And that it may be exsample to every good
prince for to keep him therfro / I will show you what Ualere says therein / he
says thus* That y^ Romans were conquerours for because that they were not
proud when good fortune fell unto the^ / like as some done that been as half
out of their mind for joy when prosperyte falls unto them. But the Romans
he says gate more in sparynge of them y^ were ouercomen / ^^at is to say in
the goodly demeanynge of them that were taken then by ouercomynge of them / and
for to understand certainly that man's good fortune blyndeth him so by pride
that he can not know himself / nor understands not the course of her pleye
/ and afterward casts them down in his horry ble pytre / It appears among
other ensamples by Hanyball which was prince of Cartage before said / For
notwithstondynge that he had many good virtues in him / he rose in to so great
a pride for because of the vyctorye that he had upon the Romans as has been
declared here before / that he dysdayned for to here any man speak to him / but
made other men spe ke with the people / which brought unto him report again
And he trusted so much in his own wit and in his good fortune and felycyte
/ that him seemed no man could show him nothing but that he knew it well
enough before / wherefore on a time he dyspraysed a wise knight of his which
was call led Maherball that said and affermed / how he had aduysed by what
manner of mean Hanyball should get Rome / ^ how he should soupe in the
Capytole which was ye chyefe fortress of the Cite / but he list not to here
it / nor set not thereby / for him seemed that he was wise enough himself /
for to get it without any fail / but his thought begyled him / for he faylled
thereof / wherefore no prince ought not disprayse to here other men's opynyons /
and specially of such as ben wise men / For there is no thing be it never so
subtle / but man's wit may ymagyne the means for to obtain it* But the
proud man deygne not to inquire / For as Ualere says / felycyte after the
common course will not suffer a proud man for to here y^ voice of a meke man /
though it be never so true and profitable unto him / for because he has no
moderacyon of attempe^aunce / So was the end of this Hanyball as it is
contained in the Romayne stories* For after that he had long trauayled the
Romans by many great batayles / fortune turned so much against him that at
the end he lost all his Empire / his men / and his goods / and was compelled
for to flee and hyde himself. But he could find no prince in y^ world that
would receive him for fere of the Romans for which cause he fell in dyspayre
and slew himself by v^nyme that he drank and so this Hanyball dyed
wretchedly / which was in his time one of the manlyest princes and best
fortuned in y^ world as it is showed in stories. And therefore to our purpose /
y^ words that was sometime said by Salon one of the. vii. sages is veryfyed
here against them that weneth to find and have felycyte by rychesses / honors
/ and delytes / saying that no man ought to call himself vrouse as long as
he lives in this world / for we ben subject to fortune unto our last days /
whi che is chaungeable and doubtefull / by the which chaunges / it happens
often times that the name of felycyte is taken a may f^o^^e many creatures.

How the good prince ought to love Justice. Ca. xviii.
AS me seems we have spoken enough of the matter of two of the first points
and of the brauuches longing to the same / Upon which the natural prince and
not the tyraunte ought to be found / upon the fete of his gouer naunce like as
we have promised to speak of here before. That is to were how he ought to love
and dread god above all things. Also the second point that he shol de love
and keep the common welthe of his land more than his own propre. Now we must
speak of the third point whi che is / that he ought to keep and love Justice
/ where upon we must first se what is Justice / and afterward the manner how
the good prince ought to keep it / and what things be necessa ry for the
keeping thereof. And how the old auncyentes that were well taught kept it.
And upon this we will show some ensamples to y^ purpose like as we have done
here tofore? Ary stotle says / that Justice is a measure that yeldeth to
every man his right. And yet a man might declare more upon this word after the
dyscrypcyon of the said virtue / but for as much as I have before this time
touched this matter and specially in the book of dyscrypcyon / which is made
of the wisdom of man. I pass the more lightly over at this time for by cause
that I will declare you ensamples according to our matter. First the good
prince ought to love Justice in such wise / that for no manner of favor he
break it not? For the aun cyent faders before us loved Justice so well / that
they would not spare their own children? Like as it was showed by an*
Emperor which commanded / that what man that brake a certain commandment
which he had made should ^ose both his eyes / For though his own sone
fell in the case he should not be pardoned of that same pain? So it fortuned
afterward that his sone brake this commandment / and forth withal he would
have done this Justice upon him. But for as much as that he should reygne
after him and he were made blind of both eyes / yt seemed to him that he might
ne uer govern well his subjects / nor the common welthe of his royalme*
wherefore he found a remedy for to satysfye his com maundement* and also that
the lybertye of his governance should not be all taken from him / But that
remedy was right pyteous / for he made to put out the one eye of his sone and
another of his own* Then I say if they kept rygorous Justice at that time*
it is as much released in the time that now is* and more over I have before
this spoken of evil mynystres / wherefore I will as now pass over more
shortly* But yet to the purpose of rygorous Justice / the worthy Romayne
prince / which was named AulusPostunus whi che by his wisdom and great
hardynes dyscomfyted a manner of people that were called Uolques. But before or
the battle telle^he made cry and defend upon pain of does that none were
so hardy to put themself in prees for to fight nor depar te out of their
lodging without y^ license of him. This said Aulus Postumus happened to go out
of his hooste for certain matters that he had to do. So it fortuned that a
sone of his had a knowledge where a cerayne of his enemies were lodged and anon
he took a certain people with him and faught with them and dyscomfyted them.
And when his fader was come home again to his hooste / and herd of this
thing / an one he gave Judgment and said / that it was more harm for to save
that man fro death that breketh the laws and commandments of princes / not
withstondynge that he had the vyctory of his enemies / and also for ensample to
other men / than the dyscomfyture of a few po^ple. And forth withal he made
^myte of his sons heed. Now we will pass over of the rygorous ensamples and
we will speak of y^ good prince how he ought to keep Justice / and what things
be necessary unto him for the same. And first he must be puruayed specially of
ryghtwyse and true counsaylers / and that they love better y^ life and worship
of the prince and the welthe of the commons / than their own synguler profit.
But Ifeere me that there be few such to find now a days. But and a prince
have such dyscrete men about him / he may well keep the rewle of Justice and
other partyculer matters which shall encrea ce and multyply him in power / in
might and in richesse. O where is that prince y^ may thank a true counsayloure
suffy ^yently enough / for the great goodness that he may find in show ynge
of his counsel if he will believe him / It is not showed in the story of
Romans that Scypyon Nasyca the wise man which was of the noble lygne of
these other Scypyons y^ were so worthy men of arms / y^ he notwithstondyng
that he sewed not the wars as these other did / yet was he so wise in
counsel and governance of the common profit / that he did as much by his
wisdom as the others did by their arms For he faught so with his wise
reasons namely against some of y^ mighty men of Rome / that would have put under
the Senate / and also the common welthe / wherefore Uale re says of him that he
deserned no less thank of the people in his koote / then the other warryoures
in their arms / for he kept the cite from any great inconuenyentes and much
good^ nes showed them by his means.

what manner counsaylours a prince should take. Ca. xix.
Owe we must advise / among what people the prince should chose his
counsayloures / for to be well counsayled / shall it not be among the young
men / Nay / for they counsayled sometime evil the king Jeroboam / and so have
they done ma ny another prince ^ But he shall chose them among the old wise
men / which ben good men / and well expert in counsel for they ben more
ready to give good counsel than the young And of necessyte it longs to a
good counsayloure / that he be well aduysed of the matter that he comeneth of^
or he give cou^ sail therein / and that he give not to hasty credence though a
matter appear fair before him / unto the time that he have well proved the
truth therein / for at y^ first apparens a matter may show otherwise than it
is in effect and Arystotle speaks of the manners of the old auncyentes in the
book of Rethoryke* and says that they were not light of believe / for by
cause that they had been often times defrauded / wherefore they will not lightly
determyne a thing in haste that is doubtefull* But they will often times
construe it to the worste / For they have seen it often times fall so in their
time. And therefore they be not ready for to give counsel hastily. Also they
will not give no great trust upon a little foundemente / nor upon a little
encheson / for they have often times seen a thing fall otherwise than they
thought / wherefore they will not give hasty counsel upon great empryses /
without great advise and delyberacyon. and al these things be commonly con
trary to young men. And also all other natural things way eth more in the
old man than in the young. But to say that al old men ben wise. Iwyll not say
so / ^or Arystotle says that there b^n two manner of ages / one is that that
follows after youth / well ordained / and well attempred / and this age
Tullyus aloweth gretely in his book of age. The other age that co meth after
youth / is that / that is indiscreet and wauerynge and this age is subject to
many myseryes / and is not worthy to be reco^mended. And therefore Ihaue said
that the princes should chose his counsaylours of the old wise men. And yet to
speak more of them thought so be that they have not so great bodily strength as
have the young men / yet they may have gretter virtue and dyscrecyon in
counsel / as Ihaue said before / which is more needful and profitable then
the strength of the body / In as much as it is more to be allowed and is more
noble / the virtue of understanding and of dyscrecyon and knowledge / then is
the strength of the body / for after the wise werkynge of cou^ sails of old
wise men ben well sustained and governed y^ roy all magestees / the ^ytees /
and the polycyes / and the common welthe / which often times ben cast down by
the young men / as Tullyus says / as it appears clearly in diverse stories.
The^ though so be that age takes away the. bodily strength / yet it
haboundeth in wisdom and understanding which thyn ges ben most to be
allowed. And therefore aged men that been sorry that their youth is past / it is a
sign that they be another wise nor virtuous / for that man is not wise that
choseth not the more profitable thing / and why that men dysprayse age is for
nothing else / But that it takes away the will and the delectacyons of the
flesh. And therefore age ought not to be blamed / but ought to be gretely
thanked. For in that it takes away the rote of all euylles / For after the
saying of Archyca of ^arence that was right a great phylosophre. There is no
gretter pestylence given to the nature of man / then is the will of the body /
of the which grows treasons / subuersyons of cytees / and of people / and
defoulynge of women / and all evil things / nor there is none unthrifty
thing but it will draw it unto the courage of man at some time / it is she
that destroys the Judgment of reason / and puts out the eye of man's
life. And also she has none affynyte nor communycacyon with virtues / So than
it is more lowable for to chose age then the dylectacyons of ye body / which
young men glad ly will not eschew. Wherefore the old men ben more noble and
set less by contrary things and reproues against themself the^ the young men
done. As Arystotle says in the. viii. book of ^thyques: And Tullyus speaks
too the same purpose and says / that age is stronger and more couragyous tha^
is youth wherefore Salon the great wise man of Athenes answered to the ^yrante
^ytsycratus which asked him how he durst be so bold to answer him so
malepertely / he answered him and said / that it was by y^ force of age / and
this is contained in the translacyon of Ualere which Ihaue gadered out of his
books / somewhat going out of my first process that speaks of Justice / for
to declare what counsayloures longs to a good prince.

^owe a good prince not witstondynge y^ he be debonayre and meke ought to be
dredde and doubted. ^apitulo. xx.
OF Justice and whereof ^^^^^ueth / it is tyght well known that yt longs to a
good prince to punysshe or cause to punysshe y^ evil d^ers / where fore I will
leave speaking of it at this time / for because that I have touched it here
before* And I will proceed upon that that longs to the said good prince after
the truth of Justice / and that he should yield to every man that belongs
unto him after his power* And if he keep this means of Justice / he may not
fail for to do right in every thing / for if he do thus he shall yield to
himself y^ is dew. For it is reason that he use y^ same right that he will do
to every man. That is to know that he would be obeyed and doubted of right and
reason as is according to the mageste of a prince. For in what lord or place
that a prince is not doubted / there may be no good Justice* and how that it
longs to a prince for to be doubted it appears by the worthy man y^ was
named Cleartus that was duke of Lacedemone / which is a great part of Greece
where were sometime passing man ly people* This duke which was a knyghtly man
and a great warryoure to that entente that his people should dread more for to
flee than to deye / said to them in this wise / that men of war ought rather
to dread their prince than y^ death of their enemies. For the which words /
and for the great Justice that he did upon them that were evil and cowardes.
They abondoned themself without sparynge or fere y^ they acheued many
meruayllous empryses / wherefore it is no doubt but y^ y^ prince ought to be
doubted though he be never so mekene so ge^tyl / for y^ mekenes ought to be
taken but as a thing of grace / which every man ought syngulerly to take heed
of / and not to y^ e^tente y^ they should dysprayse their prince for his great
ge^tyl nes. And for this cause y^ old au^eyentes painted ye gods of lordshyp
which was fygured like a lady and set up ^an high royal trone / and in the
one hand she held a branch of Olyfe and in ye other hand she held a naked
sword / which sygnyfyed that in lordshyp ought to be benygnyte and mercy /
and also Justice / and might. Then the good prince as it is said befo re should
be governed by the old wise men / and yield to every man that is his dew. And
also he should will that these good and worshypfull men should be reverenced
for their merytes and their good virtues after the sentence of ye wise man
which says. Arise against the balled man. For in old time men were wont to
do great reverence to the ancient wise men* and namely they of Lacedemone
which made many worship full pleyes. And this came in by the introduce you and
the laws of Lygnegus their honorable and wise king which he had taught
them. For he made many diverse of them / which they maynteyned long time
after. So it happened on a time that an old ancient man went to the Theater
of Athenes for to se the pleyes. This Theater was a place in which all the yon
ge men assembled in / for to prove their might one against another / as in arms
/ or Iustes / or wrastelynges / and all such other things. But none of all
the other cytesyns of Athenes would give no place unto the ancient man for to
sytte in^ So he went so long about that of adventure he came where the
Ambassadors of Lacedemone were set to se these pleyes whi che were come in
message to Athenes goodly young men and lusty / and when they saw this old
man come / they rose up a yenst him after their old custom and did him
reverence and set him in an honest place among them. And when the people saw
this they commended much y^ good custom of the strangers / and said among
themself / we wot well enough that they did right / But we abode for too
understand what the strangers would do.

How the good prince should use the counsel of the wise men. Capitulo. xxi*
WE have said / how the good prince should worsh^yp the old wise men / and
use of their counsel. And for to use the counsel of wise men* A knight that
was Capytayne of the men of arms whose name was calcalled Mynucyus said a
fair word to this purpose / as Ualere resyteth* For when he would go to yield
grace to Fabyus of that that he had saved him and his hooste / he said unto
his knights / fair lyrdes says he / I have often times herd say / that he
is the first in the work that can give good counsel of such matters as ben
for to do / as the case requires. ^ The second is he / that byleueth the good
counsel. But he that another can counsel / ^e understand good coun^ sail /
he is of no manner of profit* And therefore fair lords / we will set aside
the first / that is to say / that we be not wy se enough for to give good
counsel / for we have no suffycyent wit there to / wherefore let us take
the second / that is to say* Let us obey unto Fabyus / which is right a
wise man* and of good counsel / and so they did* For the which cause and
counsel he overcame them in battle / for he was right a wise man: And yet to
the same purpose / that is to say / that Princes should believe and use the
counsel of the wise men* The great Dyaletyque says / that every man ou ght
to believe him that is expert in his craft. That is to kno we that the good
prince ought to take counsel of diverse for kes / after the matters that he
has to do in / For as the gouer naunce of Justice / ^ the diverse things y^
may fall therein of such things as he ought not for to take counsel of his
me^ of arme^ / nor of his knights. But of the Legystres and cler kes / which
ben expert in that science* And as to the ^eete of arms he should not take
his counsel of ye clerks. And in ly ke wise of all other things. Like as
Ualere says of Quin tus Scenola. That not with stondynge he was right a great
Legystre and a shewer of right / yet when men come to ask him counsel of
certain customs of the offices of Rome. / He sent them word that asked him
the questyons to Furnes / or to Chastelanus / which were expert in the same
custo mes. Not with stondynge paraduenture he could as well have told yt
himself. But he would that every man should entremete or meddle of that Science
that he had given him unto without more. For the which feet Ualere says /
he recommended more the auctoryte in that / that he would not take upon him
other men's offices / then for the gretnesse of his wys dome / And this is
against them that would be above all other / and meddle of every thing by E^^ye
and Pride. Now a good prince should use the co^msayle of wise men / for to
keep Justice and do equity to himself / and to all other. First he must take heed that these men that be committed by him in to offices / be not corrupt ne
defouled / nor of evil living / And that his Justices be not favorable unto
one party me re than to another. Like as it has been touched here tofore /
And also that he spare no more the great than he does the small. And for
because that commonly there is showed more favor to the rich / than unto the
poor / which is against God and right / wherefore ^^^rchasus the Phylosophre
lykened the laws unto ^oppe webbes / that the ^pydre makes / and said. that
the ^oppe webbes took not the great Flies / nor the great Hornettes / But it
takes the little Flies / and feeble Butter flies and lets goo the great /
that often times breketh them and flies thrughe / So in like wise it is of
the Laws / For the grate and the mighty breketh them often times and passes
thrughe them without any feere.

But the poor he taken and trapped: And this comes common ly by the false
couetyse of them that should mynystre Justice And therefore the wise man Perycle
said / which was of gre te auctoryte in the cite of Athenes and right
virtuous. As ^ul lus witnesses in his book of offices / that it behooves to
him he says that medeleth of Justice / not only to have his hondes and his
tongue close / but also well his eyes* This is to^ understand that a man
should keep from receyuynge of gifts that corrupts the Iugementes of man*
Also that he keep himself from over much language / and from the incon
uenyence of the flesh. For the common people takes head anon to the life of
Iuges / and of great people / for by them they tak^ ^nsample of their living.

How the good prince ought to take heed upon the rewle of his officers.
Capitulo. xxii.
FOr because we be entered in the purpose how the good prince ought to be
dylygent for to ta ke head upon the rewle of his officers for because that in
officers may be great pr^iudyce to the welfare of the royalme ^or of a lordshyp
and by them is often times given great blame to princes for their
mysgouernaunce / and y^ princes not knowing of their rewle / we will somewhat
hold this matter more at long in showynge good ensamples which ben expedyent
to our pur pose. For because now a days men make no great elec^yon in regard
of virtues and of wisdom for as much as they set men in royal offices and
give them power of Justice / and to govern the people which be not able / but
that they be put in by favor and help of lords / and friends / it were more
necessary that this custom were amended / and y^ we should use the custom of
Remaynes / In such case as here after follows / It is to know as Ualery
resyteth in the. vii. b^ke / which is called Repulses by the. v. chapter /
that the Romay nes which governed soueraynly the common welthe of their Cyte^
And for to accomplysshe all their things in order and reason / they had a
manner that from year to year they changed the most part of their officers*
And they did so for because that they should take heed of them that they
did not amysse while they were therein / lest they should have been punysshed af
terwarde* And also to that entente that they should not ware proud in their
offices / wherefore all the lords of Rome assem bled together ones in the year*
that is to know such as had power to give the offices / in a place that was
called / the field of ^ars. And as it was accustomed th^re came great and ^mal
for to ask offices / such as long^d to his faculte* And every man had a
propre habyte of white / and every man put in the re his requests of y^ office
that he desired. And for because y^ y^ lords would ^e dysc^yued to give
offices to such men as were not worthy to have them / they had ordained a
certain men that were wise and dyscrete for to inquire of the deme^ nynge and
the good living of them that asked the offices. And they should bring in by
writing how they had been governed befor^tyme in their offices / if so were
that they had any before that time* And by this means they received such men
as were able* And they that were not able / they refused them boldly. And would
god y^ men would do so now a day ^s in all countrees / for by such means every
man would pay ne himself for to do well / and for to get him a good name / so
at that time after y^ excercyse of their virtuous works* men were put in to
their offices / and not after the favor of lordeshyp and friends* And so by
this it is showed that for the governance of y^ common welthe / certain men
ought to be chosen and ord^y^ed in every estate after the office y^ he should
meddle in / as it is showed heretofore. That is to know for the f^ate of
knyghthode / the men of arms and such as longs to that faculte. And as for
the clargy studyantes in science speculatyues and in arts lyberall as well as
in other / as ^^llyus says. And in this the prince ought gretely to put
himself in de uoyre for to worship and the glory of the royalme / increases
gretely by the haboundannce of of clerks and of wise men / For by them like
as I have said before the prince may be well counsayled* wherefore Platon said
like as ^oece tells in his first book of consolacyon that the goods of the
common welthe were gracyous when they were under the gouernaun ce of wise men /
or else that the gouernoures of princes would study in wisdom / for by their
means all the comonte should be brought in / to obaye the laws and y^ rewles
of reason. And like as I have often times said. I^ were a couenable thing to
put away the presumptuous men / which would be honored / and be not worthy
thereto / for that entente that the good and worshypfull men might be honored
and received in to offy ces / which should cause them that been presumptuous
for too amend themself / and by such extymacyons the good were deserved
from the badde / like as it was ordained by the studyes of cunning.

The goodness that falls to a prince for to believe the coun sail of wise men.
^apitulo. xxiii.
VEt sewynge to the same matter by good proves that the good prince ought to
love them / we will speak of the great goodness that comes thereof. and may
come to wise men such as ben solemn Phylosophres in speculaty^e / I^ is
wryt^n that Athymonydes the Phylosophre kept the ^yte of Syracuse / that yt
should not be taken by the Romans. And by wisdom and subtylyte he made such
instruments that the strokes of ^ngynes might not noye ne hurt the ^yte / ^
yet at the last the ^yte was won. And when the Prince of the host was
within the town she commanded that no man sholdeslee that Phylosophre / but
as the men of a^mes went about to pylle the town. ^ knight happened for to
co me unto the house of this Athymonydes. And there he found him writing
fygures upon the earth / ^yke as these Geo metryens and Astronomyens done.
^hen this knight asked him what he was / and he gave him no word to answer of
his demand / for because that he was so sore set up on that thing that he
made / ^aue only that he said. I pray the heartily that thou trouble me not /
of this thing that I ma ke / but he forth withal ^lewe him. And for to speak
of this Athymonydes he was a great Mathematyey^n / ^o much that some says
that it was he / that found first the square or the sercle / of which
Arystotle speaks of in his book of predycacyons. Though so be he says /
that it is a thing that may be known and learned / yet not withstondynge y^
was well learned in his time / Also some says that this Phylosophre saw by his
Astrologye how he should dye / and told it before or he dyed. But when men
asked him why he would not depart from that place where he should dye in* He
said that the mouynge of the heaven held him ^o fast that he might not styre
nor depart from that place where he was in.

wherefore yt showed that he was in the same opinion that the Influence of Heaven
dryueth a man to that / that shall fall of him. For the which cause a man
may see / that there is noone so good / nor so great a clerk in the world
/ but in some things he may ^^re and be dysceyued. For this may not be true
as to the operacyon of the soul which may work at his own lyberte and
might / for not withstondynge any manner of inclynacyon of heavenly influence /
she may chose what part that she will* As Arystotle proves in his book of
Ethyques* And in that ye may perceive and understand y^ parfyte reason and
knowledge of Arystotle* For Theologye determyneth plainly upon the feet of our
faith / that the will which is free / may not be constrained by no manner
accyon* For and it were so sin and vice might be somewhat excusable / for as
much as the inclynacyons of man might be con strayned by force: But as to the
body it may be true that in some things man is subject by his birth in
diverse accyo^s of the heuens above / as in the four first qualytees* That is
to know / in heete / in cold / in drynes and in moisture* For it is not in
power of man* but in the somer he must have heete / and in like wise of all
other* But in that that the body is subject unto the soul / That is to know
of the lyberalyte of free will I say y^ heavenly influence has no domynacyon
nor lord ship thought so be that it may be true y^ the heavenly accyons give to
man many inclynacyons* As a man may se* ^olyte / Acche ^y^or other natural
styrynges / yet notwithstanding that a man may cast upon his heed a brydell
of areste / in luche wy se that he shall withstonde the deeds of all such
inclynacyons And to prove that this may be true says Tholome which was a
great astrologyen* the wise man he says has domynacyon over the power of the
sterres And to prove that this sentence is true* it appears by that y^ is
written of Arystotle* that by his nature should have been an evil condycyoned man
but by his great virtue he became a passing wise man and a temperat^ and well
manered* And in this wise he surmou^ ^^d nature.

^owe the old wysemen were governed by Phylosophres Capitulo. xxiiii
SO to our purpose / it is to know that y^ good pryn ce shall be governed by
wysemen. And also that ^^ should not repugne against the seyence of Astro logye
in notable persons / but that they be called to the strayte counsayles of
princes / lykess it is proved here tofore by Athymonydes the Phylosophre which
by long time saved the Cite of Cyracuse / from the hondes of his enemies. And
semblably as it is showed i many other stories. But the good prince ought well
to be ware that he sta blysshe not his partyculer matters by them that seems
wise / and be not / For he may be abused by such men / as under y^ shadow of
cunning makes themself wise / and be not so in deed. And such men often
times be gyleth the princes and the leye people also / by their cautelous
dyscyplyne. But when it is so that this science rests in a good man it may
gretely profit in the keeping of Cytees and of royalmes / and to the
augmentacyon of them* Notwithstondynge that diverse men repugne against such
men / and says that they should not be of the counsel of princes* For as
Arystotle says this world that is here benethe / is governed by the accyon of
heavenly bodies. And Tholome says that the vysages and the fygures of this
world here benethe ben subjects to the vysa ges / and the fyguracyons of the
heuens above: Then and it be true that all these wrytynges speaks of / as
touching the meruaylous things / that the old phylosophres did in their
time / without any fail who that might have many su che men about him / it
would seem that he should be well con^^ayled. For it is not to think that so
many of our auctoures that were of old time would write lesynges.
Nevertheless it is to understand that no prince should take no such
phylosophre that uses the art that is defended by the church. For in that
lies to great peril. And also he should not suffer the^ ne sustain them in
his lond^* for there may fall over many in conuenyentes thereof / For I speak
of none but of such as be parfyte ^stronomyers / which science of Astronomye
though so be that it is right high and pass all other in subtylte yet it is
pure natural. And without evil art / but for the dyf fyculte thereof / that
is to know / for the great subtylte that is therein there ben but few that is
substancyally founded in the said science And for that cause many men blame it
/ For they can not understand / nor comprehend it in their mind* like as it
is said commonly / They that been ygnoraunte in things soonest will blame it.
But for to know that there have been men parfytely expert in that science.
Arystotle tells in the first book of Polytykes of a Phylosophre that was
named Tales / which on a time his fre^des mocked him for because that he
occupied him so gretely in study and was so poor that he had no good. And
when they had argued enough ^yenst him. Then the said Phylosophre thought
that he wol de show them the virtue of his Cunning. For he did so much
with a little money that he had / that by the means of his science he gate
great good on the next year following. For he understood by his Cunning that
the same next year ^lyues should take great worth / where upon he employed
his little money / for at that season they were great chepe / and so for a
small some he bought great quantyte of ^lyues wh^ che he sold the next year
following as dear as he would. -- And so by that mean he gate great good /
wherefore Arystotle says ^^^ showed his cunning to his friends / to that
entente that they should understand that it was but a light thing to a
Ppylosophre to be rich and he would / But he ended not to such matters / But
only to have the good understanding of the blessed governance of above.

And yet to this purpose. There was another Astronomyer that was called
Spyroynya / which by his science showed be fore at Rome of the death of Iulyus
Cezar a good while before or it fell / where upon it happened that when it
drew nyghe the term and time which the said Spyroynya had set that
Iulyus Cezar should not pass. / The said Iulyus sent for Spyroynya and said
unto him / wotest thou not well quod he that the I^es of March ben almoost
paste* He answered him again and said / wotest not thou well enough that it
is not fully paste yet. So it happened that the last day of the thyrty days /
Iulyus Cezar was slain in the Capytole at Rome by the means of Brutus and
^^ssyus / and by diverse other Senatoures that gave him more than two and twenty
deedly wounds. As ^rose witnesses in the. v. book of stories / which death
was meruaylous and pyteous of so^ high and so noble and prince as he was to be
so heuely murdered and slain.

How it longs to a prince for to be wise and prudente in eloquence.
Capitulo. xxv.
LIke as we have said that it is necessary for a prince for to be a good Just
year / And that in like wise also he should draw unto him for to be about
his person the wise Phylosophres. Right so it is expedyent that he himself
be wise and somewhat instruct in Scyences / So that he have an understanding
and knowledge in them. (...)the which purpose before said ^^lere recyteth and
says / that like as the fryence of Astronomye is right profitable for the
common welthe / and specially in batay le for the great study of Suplycyus G^^us
and the great understanding that he had in all manner of letters / he saved his
people from so^ayne fere. For as he led a great hooste against the king of
Perce / it happened upon a fair night / the moon lost her light suddenly /
That is to wete / she fell in a clypse / by the which sight / the great host
that he led fell in a great fere and in dyspayre that they should win the
battle.

But this Suplycyus right wisely showed them the cause and mouynge of heaven /
and assured them sertaynly seeing that it was nothing else but the natural
course of kind.

In like wise it is written in the story of Alysaundre that for such a case his
hooste was gretely abashed and made a manner of stryuynge with him / saying
that it was a punysshyon for the evil deeds that he had done* But the wise
knight that was called Arystanus / which was a great Astronomy^r satysfyed
them by his wisdom / and set them in rest.

And unto this purpose there may be well aledged Charles the wise king of
France the. v. of the name which was soueraynly governed by cunning and
loved syngulerly phylosophres / hat occupied the science of Astronomye. And he
himself for the great love that he had unto that science / he labored so
much that he was right well vnderstonden him self therein. And that it should
be couenable to a prince that he ought to be wise / it appears by the sentence
of Platon. And Ualere recorded the same* For he said that the world was
gracyous at that time* that the wise men began for to reyg ne / or else when
kings begin to were wise.

And like wise as knowledge is one of the members of science / in like wise it
is sitting to a prince that he be expert in fair language set by great
wisdom and ordynary reasons ^^r it is no doubt that the wise and fair word
dyscretely said coming out of the mouth of a Prince / is more praised and
gladlyer herd / than the words that he showed of other men / And also it may
profit him gretely in diverse causes. For there is not gladly so great
hardness of courage / but that fair language shall make it soft and
temperate / Like as it is written of Phylostratus / for he was so eloquent a man
/ that notwithstondynge that the men of Athenes which were governed by wise
phylosophres / and were customed to live in ly berte / and without sovereign /
that same by his fair and swe te language did so mo^^^ / notwithstondynge
that the wise man ^alon / held gretely with lyberte / and against the opyny on
of this Phylostratus / ^et by this fair language was he made prince and
sovereign of Athenes. ^o by diverse ensam ples to the purpose / there may well
be showed how that often times fair eloquence helps gretely / But with
fair eloquence which by their order is called rethoryke* Ualere join th
thereto y^ manner of mouynge of y^ body in vtteraunce of his language / and says
/ when eloquence is condyted with a good order with the ordynate mouynge of the
body / it pleases the herers / by three manners* For it comfort the courages
of some men / and the Eres of other men* And also it tendereth and makes sweet
to the sight of diverse people* And first he say th it pleases the courages
when by couenable mocyon of the body he that speaks represents the things /
and brings again to mind the peryllous fortunes / or the infortunes / the
virtues / the vices / the ensamples of strong and mighty men / or else the
effect of counsayles / by the which things / the courages be brought in / by
the consenting of the speker / Secondely the Eres of the herers ben reioysed
for because of the great pleasure and dylectacyon by his couenable promocyon
goodly modred* The third / it pleases the eyes of them that been the herers
in as much as they consydre and se the goodly countenance and honest be
having of him that speaks / so by this means eloquence is honored and
worshypped. And in like wise in the contrary where (...)loquence is my^^e
condyted / it is of little virtue / and full unsavory to the herers and for
ensample of such things. Ualere speaks of one that was named Quy^tus
^rcentyus / which set his study as much in goodly mouynge of his body when
he spoke as he did in his fair vtteraunce of language* wherefore men wyste not
whether it was more ^oye to them for to here him speak / or else to se his
goodly demeanynge in his countenance.

Therefore Ualere says / the sight shall be to the words to the herer / or of
the speker. And the words serves to the sight of the herers.

How it is a couenable thing to a Prince to behave himself goodly. Capitulo.
xxvi.
WIth the fair speech and honest mouynge of the body it accords well for a
prince to have a fair facon de / worshypful port / and goodly countenance.
And also there is a thing that pleases much y^ people when they ^^ a prince
keep his estate / so that it be not done with great pry de but in goodly wise /
for to maynteyne his estate. For it may profit him gretely that can condyte it
naturally. that is to say by good moderacyon. ^yke as it is said of a wise man
/ that was named ^erycles / which I have spoken of here before* that he was of
a noble faconde and goodly demeanynge. And by his wise language he brought unto
good rewle the ^thenyenses. Notwithstodynge they were right troublous and of
full evil dysposycyon even after his own desire. And sethen that it falls
to the purpose for to speak of the fair faconde that longs to a prince /
forth with the fair port and sad countenance / and goodly demeanynge of his
person / in speaking of pleasant and ordynate language / Like as we find by
ensample of ancient strangers. Then me seems it is right / that we forgete
not to remember our noble princes of France / and namely such as we have seen
/ and sees daily with our eyes / right worshypfull and right excellent in ye
same manner of fair faconde ^^^^e as was the most yllustre wise and dyscrete
king of France Charles the first of that name that has been spoken of
heretofore / which without fail by his great understanding it was a great
pleasaunce to se how goodly he could maynteyne his estate. And also to here
his goodly and eloquence language / And whether it were in counsel or in any
other matter / he would declare so notably his reasons that he would lack no
point to set his premysses in fair and dew order. And would depart his
mattere in diverse points after as the case required. And afterward conclude
to his entente right nobly / like as he full honorably declared before the
Emperor his uncle when he was at Paris / ^here he showed all alonge before
the counsel of the one and the other / the wrongs done unto him by the king
of England / or he would begin the war / like as I have set all alonge /
in the book of his acts / and of his good manners / which I compyled / And it
is declared in the third party of the same book toward the latter end /

And of this right noble eloquence of language without any fail / his right
excellent son ^^wes Duke of Orlyaunce. ^yke as every man knows / It is a
meruayllous thing to here him speak in counsel / or in any other
congregacyon too understand how he will bring about that he will say by so
goodly order / that the solemn Clerks of the university of Paris / which
ben great Rethorycyens when they were before him meruaylled gretely thereof. For
and he purposed first any questyon / or any thing that he will speak of / he
will fail no manner point of no way that longs to his terms. And ^f he
give any answer to any other person though the matter were never so
straungely purposed before him / for diverse conclusyons / he would not fail to
draw un to his mind all the pryncypall points and clauses of the matter: And
so to answer upon every article so properly to the point / that every man
that herd him would bliss himself for the great marvel that they saw in
his retentyfe wit and also of his fair rethoryke forth with his fair faconde
and mouynge of his person so well according to his fair language. wherefore
he might be well comprysed to the old notable auncyentes before rehearsed. Also
the right excellent duke of Burgoyne Phelyp which was brother to king Charles
above said / and uncle of the said ^ewes / Forth with the great wisdom and
understanding that he had was a prince that had fair and dyscrete language
and faconde which was great pleasure to here, wherefore I conclude after mine
advise that such fair faconde and goodly language though so be that it fall
to some men by nature more tha^ to other which ben wise men / yet it is sign
of a good understanding and a ferme thought. And a steadfast courage which
longs too every great prince / and worshypfull man.

How every good prince ought to be dylygent to occupye himself in the
necessytees of his loud or Royalme. Capitulo. xxvii.
REtournynge a good to our matter as touching the.iiii. point before rehearsed.
where upon the good prince that should keep Justice should found himself upon
in pursuynge of the same / we must se what things ben most propre to him for
to styre him to good living seeing all manner of virtues ben dew unto him /
which were to long a rhynge to declare in every point / ^herfore we will
speak more gene rally in such wise that the good prince ought to be occupied
hourly in virtuous works / Notwithstond ynge that such folks as have but
little knowledge seems that a prince should have all rest and no labor / but
live in case / in delytes / and worshyppes / seeing that he has mynystres
ynowe to occupy all manner of off yces* But certainly it is not so / For truly
the re is no man that the charge lies so fore upon as it does upon the
prince. For where our lord has establysshed him in ye office of lordshyp / he
is charged in every point / if he be wise That is to say he ought to have
good knowledge of the governance of his mynystres* For and there be any fault
in them / the fault shall rebounde to the prince and to his neclygence as well to
the soul as to the body* ^hen for as much as there ben many pertyculer
things in his land / or in his royaline / whi che ^en out of noumbre I can
not se in no wise how he may be ydell. ^ how noble a thing is it in a prince
for to be well occupied and flee Slewthe* And in like wise to all manner of
people And this witnesses the saying of a worshyppefull man of Rome which
said that the wars of Rome profyted ^nore to the Cite than did ydelnesse*
For many worshypfull royalmes came to great virtue by good excersyse / And by
gre te rest brought in ydelnesse and myschyete*And to the purpose that the
occupacyon and the dylygence in wars ben necessary and profitable for the
governance of the young people of the londe*^alere says certainly says he /
to be in the labor of the wars which is an horrible name / it acustometh
and susteyneth and keeps in estate the walls of our cite of ^ome And rest /
which is a sweet and a soft name has fulfilled our Cite of many diverse
vices. And to this purpose Iustyne says in his first book that when ^yrus
the king of ^erce had at the last conquered them of the royalme of ^yde.
which always rebelled against him / he considered that by no manner of means
he could not find so good a mean for to bring them under / as to set them in
pleasure and delytes. And by that means he thought to bring them in ydelnesse
and ease of their body / where upon he commanded them that they should use
noone arms / And commanded also that they should use al manner of plays and
dysportes / which was couenable to play for money. And also that they should
use theymselfe to marchaundyse / and all manner of such things as longed not
to the war / but that they should sewe all manner of eases. And so these
people which before time were manly and worshypfull marmes wexed soft and
delycate as women. And so by del ycassy and ydelnesse they were conquered /
where as before they could not be conquered by no means of the war. And to
this purpose a worshypfull Romayne knight which was named ^uyntus ^* tellus
showed a good reason / as Ualere says. For when the Cite of Cartage was
destroy ed by the Romans / which cite and land of Auffryke that some time
was so cheualrous and noble had trauaylled and warred the Romans by long
time / this said knight said before the Senatoures that wist never whether the
conquest of Cartage were more profitable for the welthe of Rome / than and it
had not ben conquered / For that conquest took away Hanyball which was a
worthy knight / by whose coming in to ytaly the Romans put them self to
labor gretely in arms / and to the excersyse thereof which before time were
ydell and full of Slouthe / And now it is to doubt for as much as they be
delivered of so egre an enemy / lest they will lose their virtue again / and
sleep and be ydell as they were tofore. ^^^ Also Uegece says in the third
book of the good duke / that is to know a good cheuetayne should rather desire
the time of war / than the time of peace. For the rest causes the knights
and men of arms to were cold in their deeds / and to be full of Slouthe. And
the excercyse and travail in arms makes them hard and abyle / and full of
courage.

How the good prince ought to love and worship his knights and his gentylles.
Capitulo. xxviii.
FOr because that we may not show all our matters together at ones / we must
delay the^ and tell one after another / wherefore the noble knights and
gentylles may greatly marvel that have read this book hyderto. -- How
the good prince should govern and rewel / like as I ha ue divided this book
in three points as is before rehearsed. And that I have not remembered the estate
of knyghthode like as though I should do it for ygnorau^ce / or else that I
had forgoten the honor / the goodness / and the good love that the good
prince ought syngulerly have to them. But for mine ex cuse hereof saving their
reverence I say certaynely that it was not done another by ygnoraunce / nor by
the forget ynge to show the knowledge nor the dygnyte of their reputacyon / but
it was only for to keep the convey of my book to that entente y^ I might
speak more worshypfully of their auctoryte. And for because also that our
matter and our purpose has condy^^^ us unto the feate of battle / we will
show how the good prince if he will use right and Justice / that is to know*
he must yield unto every man after his power / that is dew unto them /
worship them / and give them goodly rewards. / ^ how ^oble a thing ^howe
worshyp^ull and how profyta ble it is in a royalme Empire / or land / for to
have worthy kny ghtes / that is to say / good men of arms* ^e not they the gar
^e of the princes of the land / and of the people* and also they be the
champyons that spend their blood / their body and their life / for the honor
of the prince / and for the common welthe. who may then suffycyentely reward a
manly knight or a good man of arms well manered and of good condycyons / true
in deed / and in courage wise in gouernynge and dilygent in pursuynge
knyghthode* ^las such people be not rewarded in France after their deseruynge
/ For and they were honored after their dewtye^ and that there were one good
knight so rewarded* it should cause an ho^dred to be good / like as the worcester
thy Romans did sometime / For without any fail the fay re and wise customs
that they of ^ome stablysshed in their rules caused them to be conqueroures
thrughout the world* for it is no doubt forth with the e^cersyse of arms /
and their wisdom together helped them gretely in their conquestes / and for
this encheson men may well think that the Romans were better men and more
worthy then others* And all was for none other cause but that they could know
y^ good and worshypfull men / and reward them more rychely for their good
deeds than did any other people* And all the parfyte study y^ they had was for
to find the means to cause them for to do well* And for to understand the
means how they worshypped the noble men. I will show you like as ^alere
recyteth ^yrst to their princes and soueraynes / and after y^ to other knygh
tes and nobles. In the glorious time of the ^omaynes they used a custom at
^ome when their princes that is to under stand their soueraynes and chyefe
condytou^es of their great hoostes had won the vyctory and conquest of a
(...)* or of a countre^ y^ was strange to be gotten / ^yke as St^^you
Lau^ryquant / which ^ put in subiec^yon all Affryke and the royal cite of
Cartage / which was noble and worshypfull. And also the great Pompye / which
conquered many diverse royal mes / Iulyus Cezar also / and many other that were
notable conquerours / what time that they returned again to Rome after their
great vyctoryes* The Romans had stablyssh ed a certain honor which was
called Tryhomph^* for the worship of them that were princes / and under that
form they entered in to the cite after their great vyctoryes / And I so door
says / that it was a very duty for such princes* Then it is asked a
questyon what manner a thing is a Tryumphe And Ualere says that it was called
a Tryumphe of. Try. which is to say three* And of Ruphon. that is to say his
power / For who that should have the name of Tryumphe* he must ha ue it by
mean of t^^e Iugementes / And the first that should be Iuges in the same /
should be the noble men of arms / which were present at the same vyctory.
For they understood the deeds / wherefore they might best Judge in that matter^
The second was / there was brought in by writing to the Se^^^ toures / that
is to know to the princes of Rome / which were of the great counsel that
gave the Judgment wheder they had deserned the Tryumphe or nay* The third was
the consenting of the common people* And when all these Iugementes were given /
then there was ordained a passing rich chair of gold nobly arrayed* And then
all the people of the Cite should go out against him / that should have y^
tryumphe every man rychely arrayed after his faculte* The chair ^^tokeneth
worship and glory. And when they met with him / the princes salued him with
great reverence / and all other people general ly did y^ same* And it had been
so y^ he had foughten himself / they crowned him then with a crown of Palm /
if so were y^ he had wo^^e the field / for the palm has pryckes in himself.
And he that had wo^ne the field with wisdom and strength also without
gretelosynge of his people*he should be crowned with a crown of ^awryer /
which smells swetely and is ever in virtue / and this was the most propre
^^yumphe and the most Joyful vyctory / For after the opinion of ^^odore. that
vyctory is not ^oyfull where y^ prince lo^eth moch^ of his peo ple. And
therefore Salust says / and commends much these princes that wynneth the
vyctoryes without shedynge much blood of their people / so to our purpose
before y^ chair of him that shall have the tryumphe all the prysoneres that
they had taken should goo before it. Among which often times were great
kings / and mighty princes / And also the great summers charged with gold and
richesse / which they brought to be said* in the treasoury at ^ome. And next
unto the chay re went these men that had borne them most worthily in the
battle / and had most tokens of vyctorye. The tokens o^ vyctory were propre
Iewelles of diverse guyses / which we re given to them after the deeds that
they had done* For he that had foughten in battle and ouercomen his
enemy. there was given him a propre Jewel / which was ordained for the
noones. Also if any man by his manhood entered first in to a castle by the
means of a^^awte / ^y which the place was won / ^e should have another
manner of Jewel. Also if a man had foughten in a mine hand for hand / or
done any other good feate of arms / there were Iewelles or deyned for them.
And so forth for all other deeds of arms. And if so were that one had
won a ^yte / there should be given unto ^ym a crown of gold. And for other
deeds of arms Some should have ^ollers / Some ^appes / Some ^yrdell^^ Some
^arters / ^ome ^^a^^lettes of gold. And so for every feate of arms were
pr^pre Iewelles ordained for the no ^^s. And if they ware them not upon them
/ they should be gretely challenged therefore. And thus the Romans did for
because that other should take ensample. And also that me^ should know that
they that ware them did it not for noone auaunte ne for no pride in as much
as they ware them by commandment of the soueraynes. And also the berynge of
them was a great worship / for every person by that might se the worship and
ye manhood of every man. And he that did best was most worshypped over all
where so ever he went. But there durst no manner of man were no such Ie well
/ nor no deuyselyke unto the same / ^ut only they that had won them by
their manhood. wherefore and it were plesynge to our blessed lord Ihesu I would
that ^nglonde which is one of the noblest royalmes of the world would use
this custom. And the I would think that there would be many moo worshypfull
men than there be* And so those men that were most worcester thy in arms went
next the ^hayre. And the princes of To me went ^^en side by them. And the
people of Rome went all before. And the officers next them after their
estate. And after the ^hayre went all the men of arms which had been at the
vyctorye. And these men were gretely worshypped and feested with the ^ytezynes
of Rome. And under this fourm^ they went all in to the ^yte.

How the good prince ought to flee Lechery. Ca. xxix.
THan like as it is said the good prince and the very Iustycere should not be
yd^ll nor over much in dely tes. And in like wise he should ^le ^echery. For
the auctoures says. Idelnesse is the nourysshe of flessh ly lusts. which is
gretely to be reproved / and specially in princes. and it may be cause of
their putting dow ne from their prospery. ^. And also yt shall sound to
their great dy^^ame / and too many other inconuenyentes / whereof we have
ensample of Sardanapallus which was king of Assyrye and lost his royalme
shamfully / for such causes* Also a king of France was driven out of his
royalme for the same. And thus men may tell of many other: Also Ualere says to
the same purpose / y^ there was a cite in Campaygne that was named Capne*
which habou^ded gretely in delytes and specially in lusts of the flesh / by
the which Hanyball and all his host were corrupt and ^nuenymed* For Tytus
Lyuyus recyteth in the third book of the third decade / after y^ time that
Hanyball had ^^heued diverse and many great ba tails in Italy / he went to
keep his winter at Capne* And in such wise there he was wrapped in delytes and
aquayntaunce with women and cases of his body. what with wynes and meats / and
solaces / which was not so accustomed before time / nor his hooste another /
wherefore after that time they were never so egre for to suffer the great
trauayles / nor hardness as they did before time / wherefore Ualere says / y^
this arroure that he did t^ke away clearly the strength and the courage of
his knights which was wont to conquer and overcome his ^^em yes / to his
great laud and worship* For af ter the time that he kept not y^ old
dyscyplyne of arms whi che he was accustomed to keep before time* he went all
back ward* So Ualere says that he issued out of that Cite / another manner
man than he was at the entering of the Cite / yet Ualere said more that the
gre^^ yersnesse and cruelte of Affry ke and Cartage which might not be
overcome ne conquered by arms / was dresed and put down by y^ means of
delytes / by y^ which Hanyball and his host were put under / For which
Ualere says* O what thing may do more harm says he than the will and the
delytes of y^ flessh(...)y y^ which virtue is put out / and vyctoryes brought
to naught / and as touching the vycroryes of Hanyball* (...)ec thaketh mencyon
in a pystle y^ he sent to his friend that was called Lucyll / saying in this
wise* The nourysshynge of champaygne has made soft the deeds of Hanyball. For
he conquered by arms / But he was overcome by ^echery and to this purpose y^
words that Ualere says of the worthy prince ^ppamynydes may be well un
derstonde to y^ same entente^^^r after the death of y^ said pryn* ce the
Athenyences began to fail of their virtue and of their strength / For Wh(...)
they had lost him yt of ten times brought them for the to y^ wars / and to
many great batayles* A none after they became ydell and slouthful / and spended
not their good upon men of war another by see nor by sonde / as they we re
wont to do* But they bestowed their goods upon feestes and plays / and
turned y^ worthy deeds of their auncytres unto songs / and that suffysed
them enough to record and tal ke of the wars / but they would not occupye
them themself / ^or which cause the great renown of ^rece failed and was
extyncte unto the time of ^helyp fader to Alyxsaundre whithe brought them up
again.

How the good prince should keep himself fro anger. Capitulo. xxx.
FOr because Ire is a natural thing / and draws hate among great and
puyssau^t men* and at some time causes great cruelte / it lyketh me to show
some good ensample y^ the good prince should eschew y^ same vice as a thing
y^ sytteth him full nyghe / and not according to his estate* As Ua lere says
of the same vice / like as though he spoke to pryn ces in this wise / often
times the men / and specially those y^ ben great and mighty does great cruelte
in their fervent anger* And for to give you a clear understanding of y^
qualytes of these two passions / he puts a dyfference between them and says
/ y^ ^^e and hate resemble in as much as they be both vyo lent and full of
trouble in courage of him yt is angry and hateful / and causes him to desire
vengeance / yet he says there ben many dyfferences between them and so
says ^rystocle in his second book of rethoryke. But it suffyseth at this
time for to speak of. ii. of them. ^he first is after y^ time y^ y^ angry man
is avenged upon his anger / he is satysfyed / and well appeased and will
purchase no more evil against him y^ he is venged on. But the ^nuyous man will
y^ vttermoost dystruccyon against him that he hates / for he can never be
satysfyed / but ever increases more and more in his hate. The second is y^
angry man will show himself wroth to him that he is at debate with as who
says I will be avenged / nor he would not y^ the other man had no^ harm
because that he might do it himself. Therefore the angry man shows his anger
openly and not pry u^ly. But the hateful man loves better for to noye another
se cretely than openly / wherefore hate is wors than Ire only. And me thinks
also that Ire may be without hate / but hate may not be without Ire. And for
because that such inconuenyentes styreth a man to cruelte / there is nothing
more to be reproved in a prince than ^^e and hate / yet more for to withdraw
this vice from the good prince / it pleases me for the same purpose* to recyte
after Ualere the dangers and myscheues of y^ same. Though so be that such
things have been accustomed / and yet is in diverse royalmes / thanked be our
lord and the laud and glory be given to him / our princes of France that been of the royal blood ben right clean in such matters. And as me seems
more clean than other that been of lower estate of the same royalme / or of any
other nacyons / which is gretely to be commended in that noble blood. For
Ualere says certain ly that the habyte of cruelte is horrible / all things
that longs thereto ben full of manaces / and cruel commandments. And if a
man would styre him to sease of his cruelte / or to hold his peace / then shall
he be the more chaffed / for cruelte dre death no pain / nor he will not be
refrayned. Also the cruel man will be doubted and dradde / and other men
hates him naturally For he says that cruelte is a dysposycyon that is lykened
too the conuersacyon of hatrede / unto the which vice every man is enclyned
naturally. ^s Arystotle says in the first kooke of Politykes / that al thing
y^ is against natural inclynacyon is by nature hateful. Then I would that all
these things shol de be myrroures to a prince that he should eschew the
daungeres of them. And semblably to all other persons. For let us suppose
that a man be naturally enclyned to these vices / yet and he can not be lord
and master over his courage and overcome it / it is a sign that he is not
virtuous. And a man without virtue is not worthy for to have worship.

How it is lefull that the good prince after his great labor for to take
recreacyon of some dysporte. Capitulo. xxxi
TO that entente that the effect of mine entencyon / may be more clearly
understand and that I should not be found with none error in my present wry
tynge / in that is written here before / y^ at all times y^ good prince should
be occupied / semynge that by my writing y^ prince should be put in to an
extreme charge of occupacyon / which is not mine entente / I say that y^ pryn
ce and semblably all other that be charged with great and no table occupacyons
/ ought at some time sease of their labor and rest in ydelnesse. And for
because that Ualere speaks notably upon this purpose / whose words been
moore of auctoryte and more worthy then mine. I will show you his sayenges
which follows after. He says there be two ma ner of ydelnesses / of the
which the one of them ought to be eschewed at all times ^ That is it by the
which all virtue vanyssheth / and makes folly life and impotent from all good
works / and makes a man enclyne to the lusts of the flesh and sensualyte.
And of this ydelnes ^uyde speaks in his book y^ which is called the remedy
of love / saying in this wise / if y^ put away ydelnes from the / the arts
of the god of love ben perysshed. The other ydelnesse as I understand / it is
without vice. And it is a virtue in itself at some time / and it is at some
time necessary for the recreacyon of noble and excellent persons / for
attemperaunce and ease of their body / to the encen^e that they should be the
more quycke and more strong in their labors afterward* For by moderate
ydelnesse the natural virtues ben refresshed and made the more strong in
their works* Wherefore Ualere says* who that has no rest at ^o time may not
long endure* Where upon Ualere she wesh an ensample of Stypyon / and of one
Lelyus which we re worthy knights in their traueyle* And they were so
famylyer together / and so great love between them / that like as they
felawshypped together in y^ wars and in great trauayles* in like wise they
would always b^togyder in their rest / and ydelnesse / and in their recreacyon*
For in certain times they would play together in honest and goodly plays /
which was to them great comfort after their labor.

How the good prince which understands himself that he does his deuoyre
in all virtues ought reasonably to desire laud and glory. Capitulo. xxxii.
^Owe it is time that I make an end of the first part of my book which
speaks of introduccyon of princes in virtuous living. For I might sooner
stop a great pytte full of derkenesse then to reherce all the good virtues
that longs to a prince. But to speak generally of all virtues / these y^ I
Have showed here tofore ben suffyeyent enough for to esche we prolyryte / as
me seems. For what prince that follows y^ virtues before reherced with all
^perteyneth to the^ / there might be song such a so^ge by hy of laud and
glory / like as was ones of y^ noble and worthy prince Them ^stocles / for as
it hap ned on a time there were brought before hy syngers and sayers of
au^cyent geestes. So one of his knights asked him in dy^ port / what might he
be that could sing a song y^ might be agreeable to him. He answered and said /
that man that co^ de sing truly y^ I were virtuous and that I had done at any
time noble and good deeds. So a prince that is well condycyo ned / is worthy of
laud and glory / but not he that is of evil co^ dycyons and sets not by
virtue. Nevertheless he y^ feleth him self worthy in virtuous and good
condycyons it is no marvel though he would be somewhat worshypped therefore /
For it is well known like as auctours recyteth / and a man may well know by
their worthy deeds that the right excellent princes and worthy men in time past
were right covetous for to have worship. And for to get worship by virtue it
is l^full. For it appears naturally that every thing desires his perfeccyon.
And as the phylosophre says / glory and honor engenders reverence / which
is a showing that man is made for to have dygnyte. And this desire is so
rooted and Joined with nature of man / y^ every man is desirous to have it* But
every man will not do the pain for to get it* And by what means a man ought
to labor for to get lowes and pryse* The phylo sophre says it must be gotten
by virtuous operacyon / For by none other way there may be no right glory.
And thus wy^ nesseth Tullyus in the first book of offices / for what that ever
any man say / every man ought to be worshypped for the cau se of virtue and
good living / for honor / laud / and glory. of this world is not a
suffycyent reward for virtuous lyuyn ge and virtuous deeds. For Arystotle
says / ye virtuous man may lefully delyre a reward for his good deeds. For
because that by the mean of his virtues / other men may be called to
semblable goodnesses. And it is good right Tullyus says. For uneaths there
is any man but after his great labors / and pains that he has suffered / but
he would desire glory and worship / for a part of his reward. And for
because of the honor and glory / Arystotle says in the third book of
^thykes where is found and proved that the strengthes / and the great courages
of the virtuous men for their worshypfull deeds were gretely worshypped / and
the vycyoulnesse of the unworthy men have been dyspraysed and blamed. But Socra
tes said y^ they had chosen the way to come to worship / which were such in
their deeds as every man would behold him self. That is to know for to be
good / wherefore the same Socrates amonyssheth plainly by this predycacyon y^
men shol de keep right and virtue within them / then the se^blaunce or y^
aparence without good deeds / ben like as ypocrytes do. So the good prince
that will get paradyse and glory / and lowes of this world / must love and
dread god above all things. Also he must love the common welthe of his land
more than his own propre. Also he must keep Justice without brekynge the same*
and to yield to every man his after his power / like as Iu styce requires. And
than he does like a lyberal and a meke prince / as it is rehearsed here tofore.
And in doing this wise / he shall not get only the glory of this world and
the life here / but he shall get^ it perpetually / for his good deserts / ^yke
as Ualere says of the right excellent prince Iulyus Cezar / that for the
merytes of his good deeds / was reputed after his death as a god / for the men
of old time which had not the ry ght faith as we have now / when they saw
a person were ^t man or woman that passed another in any soueraynte of gra ce
/ they had opinion that such excellence might not be had / without virtue
dyuyne. and for because that the said Iulyus Cezar had with him many excellent
virtues / and among all / he had with him soueraynely Justice / and meekness.
They said that such virtues might not be perysshed / by the passing away of
man's life / but that he was deyfyed in heaven for the same.

Here ends the first part of this book.
^ere begins the second part of this book which is adressed to the
nobles and worthy men^
And the first chapter speaks how the nobles occupye the place of the arms
and ye hondes of the body of Polycye. Capitulo. xxxiii.


Seeing the matter after the conclusyon of our premysses / which speaks to
princes for the exortacyon too moral living / which we take for the heed of
the image of the body of Polyce / like as Pulcarque writes heretofore / it
behooves us in second party of this present book to speak of the arms and y^
hondes of the said image / by the which after the sentence of Pulcarque be
ordained the nobles and knights and their estate / which we must now
following our style treat of their introduccyon in virtue and good manners /
specially in ye feate of knyghthode / which is taken and deputed for the
saufegarde of the common welthe as auctoures says. And though so be that one
manner of virtue be propre and necessary as well as to nobles / knights / and to
other people / as well as to pryn ces / yet for as much as there is dyfference
and manner of living and co^uersacyon in diverse works / we must some what put a
dyfference in the matter / for diverse things longs to a prince for to do /
which longs not to knights / nor to other noble men. And there be some
things that knights and no bles may do / that the prince may not do! But it
is no doubt as touching all manner of virtues they long as well to knights
and nobles as they do to princes. For it is to know that it longs to the
knights and nobles as well to love god and dread him above all things / and
also to take heed of the common welthe / for the which they be ordained and
establysshed and to keep and maintain Justice after their degree as well as the
prince. And to be lyberall and pyteous / and to love the wy se and good men /
and govern them by good and sad counsay le / and like wise all other virtues /
which for their persons I think not to reduce the^ here against / for it
suffyseth enough the reherce of virtues which I have showed here tofore. For
this that is said before may serve to the purpose of every estate and of every
synguler person touching the soul / and the virtues* wherefore I will not
proceed much more under this form. For it suffyseth me without any more to
show the manner and the form that longs to every man (...) ^he orde as god
has called him to / that is to were / the noble men do as noble men should
do / the common people also such things as longs to the^ in such wise as
may be refe^red in one body of Polycye / to live I understand while good ver
tues follows this body / it may never fail. Now will I fro hens forward
begin my matter. And like as at the begin nynge of the first part of my
book. I spoke of ye mance of introduccyon of princes children. I will show
now how the noble ancient me^ enduced their children / like as it is written
of their deeds.

How the noble auncyentes enduced their children. Capitulo. xxxiiii.
UA lere tells in ye chapytres that speaks of customs how ye noble
auncyentes enduced their children say enge in this wise / y^ as soon as they
were any thing grown that they might suffer any pain / they took them away
ano ne from their moders and made put them in excercyse to suffer pain and
travail according to their ages and strength. And in the same age acustomed
them to bear hatnes of war after their strength / and to put them in
excercyse of labor both their arms and hondes that was not to grievous for
them Also they were not nourysshed with no tryaunte meets* nor they were not
nysely arrayed as some be now a days / but they were fed with groce meets.
And as for their gowns they used a propre facyon of an habyte that the nobles
might were / and none other men. But trust certainly that they were not furred
with martres nor embrowdred another. Also they acustomed them for to lie hard /
and to goo late to bed / and arise erely. And made them to suffer al manner of
other portable pay nes that belonged to the feate of arms. And by such means
y^ noble auncyentes nourysshed their children / which caused them afterward
come to great worship. Like as it appears by their old deeds. Also the manner
and the guyse of the gentylles of Almayne / and of other places also ought well
to be allow ed for because that they put their children for to serve gentyl men
worse then themself / and make them their pages for to follow them for
because they should suffer diverse pains and trauayles / yet I believe when they
come to their age* they were never the less wroth. For gentylmen that been so
nourysshed be more enterprenaunt in the feats of the war then they that been
made mynyouns and fed up dylycately. For as Ue gece says of knyghthode they
be appropred to arms that been acustomed to labor. And ayenste the opinion of
them which holds that delycate and pleasant meets makes more strong the
body / than the great meets / that is to say / who y^ eteth lykerous meets
and drink mighty wynes should have better blood / which should cause a man to
be the more stron ge. I say it is false. For the delycate meets corrupt more
the body then the groce meets / For Arystotle says* the delycatyues
nouryssheth not the members of man / so much as does the great meets And we
find it also by experyence. For the Brytouns and the ^ormaunes / which ben
nourysshed com monly with great meets / and be not delycate in their meets
and drynkes ben more hard and strong then other men. where fore they be more
desired in war then other men* and semblably the bourgonyouns and other
nacyons which acustomed not to live in dylycacy. And also the Romans / as
Ualere say th enduced their children in all good manners / and kept them in
fere and dread / and under obeysaunce / which governance was ordained by
great wisdom and reason. For like as it is written in the book of twelve
abusyons / the third degree of abusyon is the young man that is without
obeysaunce; in whom ought to be / Service / Subieccyon / and humylyte. / For
like as a man can find no fruit in trees that be not flo rysshed in like wise
may no man attain to honor that ha th no labor in his youth / in some
manner of obeysaunce and dyscyplyne / And of this humylyte that the children of
the nobles were sometime acustomed in. Ualere says / that the yon ge men did
as much worship to the old ancient men / as they had been their own faders*
And when the noble auncy(...) tes went to the counsel / or to the princes
court / the yong^ men would wait upon them right humbly and attend upon them
at the court or at y^ counsel stondynge on their feet to y^ time y^ they
returned home again. Thus they were made hard for to suffer pain and
travail / and these old men also did their pain to enduce them and styre
them to all good condycyons and virtues / and showed them many good ensamples /
by the which good amon(...)s and customs they become ver tuous and well
manered / and so by them put for the in to the offy ces of knyghthode after
their customs. And this manner of usage y^ nobles kept among their children.
And so for their pacyence and virtue and who might best endure pain were
reputed for most worthy* And yet Ualere says when a man made any great feast
/ and the young men happened to be there when it should come that men should
sytte down / they would enquere dylygently who should come / to that entente
if any au^ cyent man that were noble and worthy came thither / that they should
be ready anon for to serve him / for they would not sytte ^^ste. And at the
end of the mete they^ table should sonest be ta ke away / for because that
they should present themself befo re the old worshypfull. By the which it
appears says Ualere that they were taught / not to be of much language /
wh^was a sovereign and a fair custom for young men. For as An^^me says in
the book of symylytudes / there be three things which ought to be commended in
a young man that is to know Shame in virtue. Abstynence in his body / and
Scylence in his mouth that is to understand he should be little of language
For after the saying of ye wise man / if ye fool held his peace he might be
taken for a wise man.

Ensamples of that / that follows after of the doctrine that the auncyentes
gave to they children. Capitulo. xxxv.
Owe have we showed how y^ Romans in old^ time enduced their children in
their youth. ^ Now must we show what follows after of this introduccyon y^
is to wete of the effects of their worthynesses when they came to age / where
up on Ualere among all other ensamples of chyldehode speaks to our purpose
and says / that often times in chyldhode a man shall understand by his
inclynacyo^s to what things he shall draw to / where upon he tells of a
noble child of the Cite of Rome that was called Emulyus Lepydyus / which
learned the introduccyon of arms so hertely and delyted him so much therein /
that when men went to battle he would needs be ar med / which was against
nature of children / for y^ great horroure and fere in battle. Nevertheless he
did so much arms at that battle that the princes of the counsel of Rome
put him in their regystres / and noble memoryes of the Cite for a great
marvel / ^lso the young men by the styrynge and exor tacyon of the noble
auncyentes were more apt to natural pity to good condycyon / and to steadfast
courage* Also Ualere speak th of another noble chyld^ that his master led
toward scole And as he passed by one of the princes of Rome which was ^
cruel man whose name was called ^ylla / which had made smite of the heedes of
many men of Rome by his great cru^ltye* ^he child asked of his master how
such a tyraun^ might be suff^^d and not slain. (...) master answered saying
in this wise / that there were men ynowe y^ would sle him and they might. But
he was so fortyfyed with me^ of arms y^ the re could no mean be found
therefore. Then said the child / if so were that I had a knyfe I would right
soon bring y^ mat ter to a point ^or every day I am in his presence /
wherefore I would not fail to sle him / where upon the master consyde ring
the great courage of the child would suffer him to come no more in the
presence of Sylla / but he serched him well before that he had no knyfe upon
him. Also to y^ purpose of the great courage of a child well manered / Ualere
tells of a no ble man of ^ome which kept a child that he had in great ry
gour and without measure / in so much y^ the child was greatly anoyed with his
rudeness / and durst not well come in his pre sense / It happened that another
mighty man of Rome hated much that chyldes fader / so I wot never what cause
he foun de to the chyldes fader / but y^ he would needs trouble him / and did
so much therein y^ he caused y^ man to spend great goods and abated gretely
of his richesse. Then the good child which took no head of the rudeness /
nor the injury that his fader did unto him / but only to the natural love y^
he ought him might no longer suffer the tourment that was done to his fader /
but took a knyfe pryuely and went thither as his faders adversary was / and
said unto him that he would feign speak with him in counsel. The other which
was a wise man of counsel / like as we might say a learned man / supposed y^
y^ child would ask him some advise of counsel against his fader / and was
full glad of him / and led him secretly unto a chamber. And when the child
saw that he had his faders enemy all alone / an one he shytte fast the door
and ran to the old man / and cast him under him / and forth withal to ke
him by the throat / and swear a great oath that he would sle^ him without that
he would ^ette his fader he in peace / and that he would also make him amends
of the great charges that he had put him to. And so at few words he made
him so aferde that he made a promise for to restore his fader all his costs /
and so he did.

How the old anncyent knights auaunced the young men that they had taught
and learned. Capitulo. xxxvi.
LIke as ye have herd here tofore the children of the Romans profyted
gretely in old time by y^ good ensamples that was showed them by the old
auncyentes which did as they should do. And these ancient men ben gretely
to be reproved that give cause to young men of evil ensamples / Like as some
old foo les done / which ben hardened in evil manners / and fylthy cu stomes
which will not spare to use them among the young men / but makes them their
messyngers / for to bring them nyce rydynges / wherefore it is gretely to be
reproved when it happens that they which ought to be techers of good doctry
ne / ben ensample of fyl the / and myschyefe. For there is not a more
unsitting thing in this world / than to se an old man without virtues and
wisdom. And as it is said of the old worcester thy Romans that governed them so
wisely in all things they had so great delight in the good deeds of young men
that they let not for their youth to set them in high dygnytes of offices
and for though they were young in age / they were old in virtues and wisdom
/ like as they did by Stypyo Lau frycan / which was but. xxiiii. year of age
/ when they made hy^ capytayne of a great host which was not acustomed to be
do ne under y^ age of xxx. year at y^ lest / nevertheless they were not de^ey^^d
therein / for he bare him so worship fully and so much profyted the Romans
that by his manhood and wisdom / he gate them all Affryke / Cartage / and y^
gretest part of Spain where he did many meruaylous acts / In likewise also
it was of Pomp the great / which in the age of chyldehode was so gretely
proved in all virtue and worthynes that in age of xxii. year the Romans made
him a Consule* that is to say / a prince of a right great hooste. And he bare
him so well in his office and dygnyte / that he won the Tryumphe diverse ty
mes / which was a sovereign honor / like as has been reher ced before in the
first part of this book* First he had the tryumphe of Mytrydates y^ king of
Pontus / which subdued xxii. countrees of diverse languages / which by the
space of xi years had troubled the Romans by diverse bataylles. Also he had
the tryumphe for king ^ygram of Armony like as it is said before / And for
other diverse kings and Cytees / and lands / which he put under the
obeysaunce of Rome to y^ nom bre of.xxii. royalmes / And shortly all the
regyons that been by twene the mount ^ancasus and the reed see / Also he
cleansed the sea of a great multitude of robboures which occupied the parties
of Europe and ^yse after the sea coost ^ And so out of these worshypfull
scoles came such dyscyples as ye may here and of the feate of these good
scolers and dyscyples for the ensample of knyghthode I will tell you more next
after following.

How among all other things sire good condycyons ben necessary to the nobles
and knights. Capitulo. xxxvii.
Of the first.
Now as me seems I find in the wrytynges of auctoures which have treated of
the manners and condycyons of noble men / that.vi. condycyons ben necessary to
knights and nobles if they will have the worship that is due to ma^hode. And
without the^ there is no noblesse worth / but as a mockery / The first of
these condycyons is / they ought to lo ue parfytely arms / and keep y^
ryghtwysnes thereof / and they ought to put them in excercyse of that labor.
The second co^ dycyon is that they ought to be hardy / and that hardynes ought
to be so ferme and so constaunte that they ought not to fl^e ne part from
battle for fere of death / ne for losing of blood ne life / for the welthe of
their prince and saufegarde of the lon de / and for the common welthe / for and
they do / they run in the pain of losing of their heedes / by sentence of
the law / and also shamed for ever. The third is / they should give courage
and hardynes one to another / and styre their felawes for to do well to that
entente that they should surely abide: The fourth is y^ they ought in any wyle
to be true / and keep their faith and pro myse. The fyfth is / that they ought
to love and desire worship above all things worldely: And the syxte is / they
should be wise and subtle against their enemies in all manner of fears of
arms. And if these six condycyons be weli kept / they y^ observe them may
never fail of honor. But certainly there is more dyffyculte in the
perfourmynge of these condycyos then in the speaking of them* and therefore
Arystotle says / where is most dyffyculte / there is the grettest worship*
^owe for to speak of the first condycyon that the noble man ought to have /
that is to know he should love and put hymsel fe ^^excercyse of arms / and
keep y^ right of the same / we may give ensample of many worthy knights: But
for as much as we be entered in y^ stories of ^omaynes / we will contyne we in
them which as me seems we may take generally / for the special lovers of
arms / and by consequent they were right noble / y^ is to know of the good
knights of whom mencyon is made in y^ wrytynges of old auctours which make
mencyon of their deeds and though they loved well arms / they kept the
obseruaunces of y^ same by their cheualrous dyscyplyne / that is to say / by
their good rules to keep right in all things couenable / so that they failed
in no thing For in ca se y^ on y man had done against their ordinance which
was stablysshed among them they were right sharply punyssh ed. wherefore
^alere says / dyscyplyne o^ knyghthode / that is to know rule and order kept
which long to the same / was the sovereign honor and steadfast foundement of
the Empire of Rome. And more over he says / by the well keeping of y^
dylcyplyne they gate the great vyctoryes and the sure estate of peace and
tranquylyte. And of the manner how ^alere gives diverse ensamples upon y^ same
dyscyplyne / it is to were that among all other he speaks of a rebellyon
which was in ^ylyle against the ^^maynes. There was a consule that is to say
one of their princes / or else a soucrayne capytayne / and he was sent forth
with a great host whose name was called ^alpurynus Pyso So it happened that he
had sent one of his the actaynes with a company of his men of arms to keep a
passa ge against his enemies / nevertheless he was supprysed with so great
multitude of his enemies / that he and his host was so ^o^st rayned y^ they
were feign to yield their arms unto them and when y^ the consule ^alpurynus
understood this adue^ ture / he supposed y^ it fell so for lack of good
watch. ^o when he was come again to this ^alpurynus he did him such
^ylanyes as here after follows / for he made him were such clothing as the
nobles did / which was called ^ogue / and in token that he had dishonored
his noblesse for because y^ he had so symply yield him to his enemies / he made
take away the freuge y^ was set above on his garment and set it benethe at ^ is
feet / which was taken for a great vylany and the frenge was let still
there all long as that arm endured / and was defended him that he should not
company with the knygl tes that is to say / he should not come on horsbacke
among y^ men of arms / where as before he was a capytayne / so he and these
men that were yielded with him were let among y^ foot men and boys / which
were of no price nor reputacyon.

Of the first good condycyon. Capitulo. xxxviii.
_^^t to this purpose Ualere tells how y^ Romay nes in keeping of this
dyscyplyne spared no man that did amysse / though he were never so good and
not able / and speaks of a worthy knight y^ was called Fabyus ^ustylanus. And
was master and capytayne of a great host of Romans. But for as much as he
fought with a great host of his enemies without y^ license of ye dyctatour or
consule which was ye sovereign / not with stondynge y^ he dyscomfyted them /
yet he was dyspoyled and made naked / and sore beten / and yet it was a great
grace y^ he had no more harm / but for because that he was a worth y knight
they saved his life / wherefore Ualere speaks of him pyteonsly and says / that
Fabyus ^ustylanus gave his vyctoryous body and full of prowess to be torn
with rods by the hang man in renuynge the blood of his wounds / which he
had gotten in his glorious vyctoryes. But the Romans kept this Iu styce to y^
entente y^ they should be doubted and dradde / yet Uale re tells to y^ same
purpose of a worshypful co^sule y^ was slay ne in a battle / yet
notwtstondynge y^ his party had y^ better and wan y^ field / for because y^
Romans were enfourmed y^ for lack of me^ of arms which had not socoured
hy^ / and so by their neclyge^ce took no head to their duke but let hy^ be
slain / and by cause y^ they p^eed not before to save hy^ fro y^ shot of his
enmyes The senatoures of Rome / as Ualere says ordained that all y^ year after
these same people had no wages* Also the Carta gyences which were right noble
men of arms put their capytaynes to dyspyteous death when they made evil
ordynau^ ce in their batayles / let us suppose yet that they had the vyctory
/ but their opinion was that no man ought to have glory ne lowes of no thing
that he does in less that it be done by reason / but ought to be punysshed
therefore* Thus Ualere concludes when he has spoken enough of ye dyscyplyne
of kny ghthode which sewed the Romans for keeping of the same that is to say
in conquerynge of the mighty kingdoms and lords hyppes of ye high hills of
Alps and accheued the met uayllous adventures of the same without which
dyscyplyne it could never have been brought about.

The second good condycyon. Capitulo. xxxix.
TO speak of hardynesse which is the second good co^ dycyon that is necessary
to a good knight / or a good man of arms. The auctours say which have trea
ted thereof / that it is a virtue y^ comes of great courage which clerks
calls Magnanymyte without which no strength of man may not accheue great
deeds. And by hardynes is enterprysed all the high and great things / and
often times accheued rather than by strength / like as a (...) may se often
times that a little man feeble and small of (...) may be so hardy of courage
that he dare take upon himself to do arms against a much man and a strong /
and often times dyscomfyteth him* And of this we have ensample of ^lyrsaundre /
which was one of the leest persons y^ men knew / yet he fought hand for
hand with king ^ortus of ynde which was a more mighty man than other / yet
he dyscomfy ted hy^ / and through his great hardynes he was bold to take upon
hy^ to co^quere al ye world which he acheued / and yt was a great marvel /
and many other have acheued by their hardynes so many great meruayles which
seemed impossyble to be done / wherefore Guide says yt ye gods help y^ hardy
me^ / where as he speaks in his poetry yt ye god which is called Mars hell pe
a knight in his hardynes when he fought with a man yt was my ghtyer tha^ he / and
cast a stone against ye stronger man / and hythy^ in ye vysage which caused hy^
to be astonyed / and by yt means ye feeble man overcame y^ strong / so this
might be true / some man paraduenture cast a stone yt smotehi in ye vysage /
and y^ folysshe people at yt time because y^ noma^ wist fro whe^sy cast came /
demed y^ y^ god Mars had cast it i helpyng of ye feeble person / and i likewise
valere says yt ye god Mars helped a romayne knyzt y^ faught against another
which sent hi^ a Rauon yt with his beck and his talouns smote his enemy so sore
i ye vysage y^ it was cause of his dysco^fyture / and these is said herefore
because y^ often times it hap peth fortune is so ready to the^ y^ be hardy and
gives the^ so many good adue^tures y^ it seems verily as it came by miracle /
but for to speak proprely of hardynes y^ pure and honorable hardynes which
ought to be allowed is y^ y^ is founded upon reason and such things as ben
possible to be done without presu^pcyo^ and folysshe hardynes / as who says one
man alone against many me^ / or else with a few me^ to assail a great host of
their enmyes / or yt a man do great outrages and weneth no ma^dare aue^ge it /
such hardynes may not long endure / and though it hap at sometime y^ it
proves well with hi^ / at last it destroys hi^ utterly and al y^ believe in ye
same / and there abides no worship i the^ / but is holde^ tor presu^p cyo^ and
folly / for as it is said here tofore of dyscyplyne of knight hode in all
things where is no measure is not to be allowed / though so be yt at some time
by adventure may hap to fall some good thing / yet it may not fail but ye
end shall be evil.

Yet more of ye same and ensamples of the Romans.
Because we have said here before and true it is y^ hardynes comes of a great
courage / we must therefore show ensample after y^ order of our process
contained i this book here tofore and yet so^ what of our purpose of yt y^ is
reherced before of y^ dyscy plyne of knyzthode / yt is to say / Iulyus cezar ye
noble co^querour had by his right wise dyscyplyne enduced his knights and his
men of arms i such lessons as here after follows to our pur pose of hardynes
and courage which ought to be i a good man of arms y^ should not fle from
battle for fere of death / nor be found as a cowarde. Ualery tells of a
worthy knight y^ was with In lyus cezar / called Marcus cesius / where as he
happened to be i a ba tail where he did many great dydes of arms yt was
marvel to se / wherefore there were sent a great people for to take y^ knight
/ but as many as came nygh hy^ he slew the^ / and yet he she wed gretely his
hardynes and courage i another thing / for one happened to faste^ a stroke
upon hy^ and smote one of his eyes clean out of his heed / but for all y^ he
made no se^blau^t y^ he suffered any pain nor left no more his fyghtyng
therefore tha^ he had not be hurt / yet not wt^tondyng yt he had many grievous
wou^des be side / buthe never seized fightyng till even y^ he fell down deed
upon y^ hepe of men y^ he had slain hy^ self / and it was found yt his
shield was perced i. xxvi. places / so for ye worship of hi^ Ualere says y^ y^
disciplyne of Iulyus cezar nourysshed and brought forth such knyztes y^ is to
know by his cxortacyo^s and excercyses of good ensa^ples y^ he showed the^. ^et
more to ye same purpose valere speaks of another knight y^ was with Iuluus cezar
called ^ltilius / which happened on a time to be i great battle upon ye see
against the^ of Marcell / in ye which his right ho^de was cut of / but for all
y^ he abashed never his cou^tenau^ce nor chere / but took up his sword with his
lift ho^de and faught as ^grcly with y^ as he had had both his ho^des. And to
ye purpose y^ we have spo ken of before yt good fortune helps often times to
the^ y^ be har die / valere tells of another knight y^ was with Iulyus cezar
called Scenola / this Scenola hapened of adventure to go aloin to an ylonde
from his felawes and in ye same ylonde were passyn ge many of his enemies / and
as soon as ever they saw hi^ they assailed him egrcly on every part / but he
quyt him so ma^ly y^. v. knights could not have done so much in half a day
as he did in an hour / and when his darts were failed him he pull led out his
sword and can heedlynge upon the^ and did so great deeds of arms yt it was
marvel to se of his felawes which stood on ye other side of ye water and
beheld him how he faught but they might not come i no wise to help him / and
it was a sore thing for his enemies to suffer ye strokes y^ he gave the^ / for
it was a thing y^ might not have be^ well byleued y^ by one per sone so great
meruayles of arms might have be wrought with out they had seen it / for he did
so much with his great strokes y^ he made al y^ meynea little to draw abacke /
tha^ so hurt as he was yt is to know he was smyte^ with a spear through both
thyes and his vysage al to brysed with a great stone / and wounded i many other
places / yet notwtsto^dyng yt he suddenly ran to ye water ar med and hurt as
he was swam over making y^ water al blody as he swam / and thus he escaped and
went to his lord Iulyus cezar which honored him gretely and gave him a
right great reco^ me^dacyo^ as he had well deserved / and rewarded him notably
for he could well know a worshypful man / and reward him after his deserts /
which caused other to take great ensample to do well / and forth wtal he made
him lord and master over a great company of knights. ^et again of ye same
purpose yt fortune helps often times y^ ma^ly and couragyous knyztes for to
escape from ma ny great peryls and to do many meruaylous deeds of arms / vale
re speaks of a knyzt of Rome called Oracyus crocles which on a time me^ of
tuskan came to take a bridge against y^ host of ye to mayns / these oracius saw
y^ and went not over y^ bridge to defend passage and fight with them hand for
hand till the bryoge was broke behind hi^ / he wist well they should have lost
y^ passage / and wha^ y^ was done he spored his horse and made hi^ lepe i to y^
water and escaped safe and sou^de i despyte of al his enmyes / notwtsto^dynge
they cast many a darte after hi^ / yet to y^ purpose of hardynes and courage
valere speaks of a romayne knyzt which i a battle had done many meruaylous
deeds of arms and endured long theri / and at last was so sore wounded y^ he
might not help hiself with his ho^des / and when he felt his life was but
short / he did so much y^ with his fete he smote down one of hes enmyes / and
wha^ he was down he fell upon hi^ and bote of his nose and al to tare his vysa
ge / yet valere speaks of a worthy price of rome named Poulus crasusly same
poulus after y^ he had tought worshypfully i a batayl against arystonyeus king
of dayse / ha^^ed y^ evil fortune ^^^ against this poulus / i^o much y^ he was
take alive in y^ batayl wha^ he ^aw y^ hi^ thought he had lever dye honorably
the^ live ^ bondage like as it was at y^ time y^ custom i diverse places y^
whosoever were take i battle should be holde^ afterward as a bode man and
suffer great pain and labors and namly at rome for they used y^ custom
against such me^ as rebelled or brake their conantes / so this noble price
after y^ he was dysarmed and put a ly^el small yerde i^ his hode / he with y^ same
yerde took him y^ stood next hi^ and threst y^ rod eve i^ his eye and smote it
out / these man y^ was so hurt field the great pain of y^ stroke and anon
took out his sword and ^lue y^ price / wherefore valere ^medeth this price sayn
ge y^ Crassus showed to fortune y^ it was not i their puystau^c^ though y^ body
were overcome / for to overcome y^ courage / yet of another meruaylous knight
of rome / valere and other diverse auctours as varo^tytus lynyus / lolyn and
other which tell of hi^ and of his deeds / and semes as it were a thing ^
possible y^ it might be true* but y^ auctoryte of these notable witnesses
makes me to give faith and crede^ce to think it should be true / this worthy
knight was call sci^imnus de^tatus / shortly to speak this knyzt did ^ his
time so great arms y^ he was i. vi. score batayls for y^ romans where he had
ever y^ victory he being so courag yous y^ thrughe his might and courage the
most part of the batay les were accheued / and he brought to Rome. xxx. men
dyspoyled which he had ouercomen by his manhood / that is to say he wanne
their armures by noblesse / or their sheldes / or koote ar mures / like as
parauenture their custom was such at y^ time in sign of vyctory / whereof.
viii. of the same that were dys poyled were knights / which had challenged to
fight with him hand for hand between both hoostes / in presence of both
parties* Also he rescowed and saved* xxxiii. knights in ba tail / and in the
breast he was hurt with. xlv. wounds and not one in the back behind / and
thus the customs of Rome were at that time full notable like as I have said
here tofore. That would god there were now in France which is the flower of
all the lands of the world / as in noblesse / would keep such ru le and
governance as did the Romans in those days / for when the princes of Rome
co^^ home vyctoryously from any great conquest / they were received with great
honor which was called / ^ryumphe And these knights that bare them best in
the field went next to the chair. And had propre deuyses of Iewelles /
which they ware upon them after y^ deeds of arms that they had done* And they
were called vyctoures This right worshypfull and manly knight Scysymyus brou
ght many such vyctoryes to Rome next to y^ chair. And eve ry day his honor
encreaced more and more. and the nombre of worthy deeds that he did / like as
Solyn says they were nombred to. CCC. and xii. And Ualere sets in his
book. CCCC. and. xii. and when he entered in to the ^yte men took more head of
him for his meruaylous deeds / then they took to the richesse that went about
the chair / where y^ tryumphe was in / and Solyn says of this Scysymyus /
that he was y^ the hardyest and most excellent of all the Romans.

Of the third good co^dycyon that knights and cheuetaynes ought to have in
arms. Capitulo. xl.
IT happens often times and commonly is seen y^ every person which is learned
in a craft and customed in the same / trauayleth and puts himself in pain
to instruct and learn other men such as ben enclyned to the same / wherefore
the wise men says / and thou haunte an follow the good men / thou shalt be
like unto them And if thou haunte the cyull / thou shalt be as they be /
wherefore he that will be master of a craft it is necessary that he follow and
haunte the master workman of that craft that he will medell in / for as it
shall be said here after in the last part of this book / every man that is
expert in his craft ought to be byleued. Now for to come again to our
purpose of this mat ter / that is to know of the third condycyon that y^ good
knight or good man of arms ought dylygently to follow and haun to the noble
and worthy men which ben experyente in the same. And for because I call it a
science it should seem to soome man that I failed of my language. But for to
speak clearly with out sechynge of other subtle reasons / which shall be proved
that it may so be called / as seems that all thing in which good measure
and rules ought to be kept may well be called a science. And me seems there
is no craft more necessary to have good rule in than the feate of arms. For
where as there is no ord^^ / ^e rule in battle / all gothe to confusyon / like
as we may se daily by experyence / wherefore Uegece made a propre bo ke wherein
he speaks of the rules that ought to be kept in arms / which book is called
the science and art of knyghthode and that it may be proved true that there
is no art more necessary to have good rule kept in / than the art of arms
/ / Stypyo Lastryean the right worshypfull knight / as Ualere tells said to
this same purpose / that there could not be a gretter shame in a knight than to
say / I had went it should not have been so / for he said if a man would do a
thing and execu te it / he should do it by so good advise and counsel / and
by so great reason that he should not need to say I wyste not that it would
have been so. For the error that is to say when the re is any fault in good
ordinance of a battle / the vyolence is so great thereof / that it may
never be amended. And the fore said auctoure which is called Uegece / speaks
of the same in his first book of knyghthode / And he says also / if men
err in other things / the error may be corrected and amen ded. But the
dyshordynaunce of bataylles and mysco^duyte in arms may never be amended /
for the pain pays incontynente the mysdede. For he must needs perysshe
shortly / or ^l les shamefully flee / or at the leest way he must fall in
seruage that is to say he must be taken and comberously entreated / / which
things is more grefe to couragyous men then is the death. And for because that
we be entered in the chapter when* we hoope to treat how the good men of arms
ought to styre one another to be manly and good / and the manners that ought to
be kept in the same / which longs syngulerly / and pryncypally to the
introduceyon of knights / and capytaynes * of hoostes / and of batayles. We
will speak of a worthy prince called Stypyo / which has been rehearsed here
^ofore saying in this wise to his knights that no man ought to fight with his
enemies that is to know to go and assail them without a just cause. But and
he had a Just cause he should not ^ary and abide till they come upon him / for
a Just cause gives a great hardynesse in such a case for to set freely
upon / and to fight surely* and otherwise a man ought not for too fight without
that necessyte constrayne him. But and the case be y a man be assailed / if he
defend him not / (...) great cowardyse and an evil trust of good fortune /
which were a shamfull thing. yet to the purpose of good cheuetaynes of an ho
ste. Uegece speaks and says that above al other men they ou ght to be wise
and best aduysed in their office / For it is a gre te thing he says for to
puruaye for so much people that is for to wete for to be well aduysed in his
thought how he may do against him that is his enemy. Another is how he may
govern such a quantyte of people to the pleasure of every man and to keep
them in good order and rule to his honor and profit of his sovereign /
wherefore the old auncyentes sometime which were princes and gouernoures of
batayles feigned them self that they were of the lygnage of gods / to that
entente y^ they^ subjects and they that were under their governance should
dread them the more* and put gretter faith in their ordinance and rule. and
such manner of cautelles they used at that time in techynge of their people.
Like as Ualere tell th of the great wisdom* valyaunce / and hardynesse of
the no ble prince of battle that was called Sertoryus / which for to give
heart and trust in his people / feigned and said that the gods showed him by
reuelacyo^ what he should do by a why ^e hynde which he led with him in the
hills of Lucytanye which is a party of Spain / and in all other places
where he went in his Iournaye* And in the same wise did king Mynos of Great
which was a man of great wisdom in the keeping of Justice and likewise in
batayles. For he subdued and put in seruage them of Athenes / which ^heseus
their duke made free afterward. This said king Mynos went customably every
new year ones in to a cave which by old time was consecrate to their god
that was called Iupyter say enge that he was his sone / like as poets say.
And in y^ place he said that his fader Iupyter gave him the laws / and the
ordynaunces that he stablysshed among them. And he feigned thus for because
that they should doubt to break his ordynau^ces and commandments. But these
things be not to understand that ye good capytayne or the good man of arms
should use this / for such faynynge were evil done and might give cause of
evil ensample: But if ye wise capytayne or guyder of men of arms could wisely
feign that he had a gretter wit than he has / or that he could more than he
does. And ye that he does be done by reason / and for a reasonable cause /
and upon that fyndeth any good Iapes or cautayles / I suppose it were right
wisely done / like as here after shall be declared when it falls in the
process.

yet more of the same / and ensample of the Romans.
TO treat of the purpose of good amonycyons that the good cheuetayne ought to
do to his people in all Just wise that he can think / by the which he might
give them gretely courage and will to do well / and to be the more hardy. And
also that one and other ought to say in comfortynge of their courages / Ualery
says that Gayus Marcyus a consule of Rome / a duke and condytoure of a great
host happened on a time to be in a battle gretely oppressed with his enemies
wherefore he had a great doubt leest it should myscary with his host. So he had
with him strange sowdyoures to the nombre of. iii. cohortes. A cohorte is a
nombre of. CCCCC. men of whom he had great doubt that they would not be true
to him: Then for to make a remedy for that doubt / seeing that the thing was
hasty and peryllous / went unto the same men and amonysshed them gretely to do
well their deuoyre / and promised the^ that and so were yt the field were
won by their manhood yt he would reward them so gretely yt he would make
every man of them Cytezyns of Rome / and that was not a little thing in those
days that he promised them. For it was ye grettest honor and profit that
could be done to any man for the noble fraunchyses and lybertees that was in ye
cite. And also it was not acustome to make such grant to any strangers.
Then the se sowdyours were right well apayde of that great offer. And payned
themself so lore that by their manhood their enemies were sore put abacke / by
the which vyctoryously the battle was won / where upon the consule kept
them couenaunte of that he promised them / notwithstondynge yt it was ayenste
the ordinance of the Cite. For there ought no consule without license and
ordinance of the Senatoures that is to say of all the hole counsel to make
no grant of such thing. But as for trespass that he did in that case he
excused him right notably before the Senatoures saying that where as a battle
^^ode in great Ieopardy it were right necessary to ^^uruay for an hasty remedy.
And by this advise at that time he could not find a better remedy than for to
grant them great rewards suddenly for as for than he had no sayloure to se^e
ye laws which at that time had more need to be offended than kept. ^ ^^t to
the purpose of the sad advise of the cheuetayne yt amonyssheth well his
people. Tytus ^ynyus says in the first foundacyon of Rome / it happened that
the Romans had need of help of men of arms for a great battle that they
had to do: Therefore they hyered the^ strange sowdyours so these same sowdyours
which were not good ne true seemed by their Judgment that the battle was
doubtefull and peryllous on the Romans side / they fair departed out of the
host / and went to the pendaunte of an hylle / to the entente that after the
battle who so ever had the field they would have fall unto them / when the duke
and prince of the host saw yt these people were abashed for because that
they saw these meyne yt should have holped them departen from the field ^none
like a wise cheuetayne found a remedy for that fere / For he took an horse
forth withal and rode thrughe his battle saying that all thing was in good
ordinance / and that he had sent out the capytayne of the sowdyoures and his
people with him by his advise to the pendaunt of that hill / to that entente yt
they should come on the back half of his enemies after the battle was Joined
/ and said he had given them a certain toke^ when they should set on. And thus
this wise and worthy cheuetayne by his great wisdom and advise changed the
hertes of his people and put them in great hoope and hardynesse and by that
mean he wanne ye vyctory of his enmyes / which was a notable deed.

yet ensamples of the same.
YEt to the purpose that good amonysshynge is much worth in the feate of
battle / I may draw out that is written of three worshypfull knights of the
which one of them was of ^acyde^one / which is a part of ^rece / that by
his words and his deeds showed his worshypful courage / it happened* on a ty
me y^ he was with a great to wte of me^ of arms of his own country y^ went to
a war and he with them / and for because y^ he was halte and somewhat same /
his felawes rebuked him and said that they had marvel what he would do at the
battle. Then he answered the^ again full courteysely saying y^ he went
thither for to smite / and not for to fle / and y^ the strength of his ar mes
was so bounden with the constaunce of his courage / by y^ which he hooped the
battle should be the more strengthed by his person / or else he would dye in
the pain / and hooped too have as great vyctorye as any that was there. And
also he said that it should be a great shame unto them that presumed so much
upon themself and had all their lymmes hole and sou^de that such one as he
should here a way the worship before them that were mighty and sound in their
persons* And this good knight said thus for because y^ they should put them in
their deuoyre by the means of that strife to fight the better when they came
to the battle / And so it happened that they did / for y^ strife ran so
far among themself / that they put them in the Judgment of their
cheuetayne / that who so ever did best in the battle should have a certain
thing of worship given him / that men might know by that his notable and
manly deeds. And for because of this debate every man put himself gretely in
his deuoyre for envy that the one had to the other / by the which they gate
the vyctorye of a great and a strange battle* Another Romayne knight that was
a cheuetayne of men of arms which had sent the Romans with a company of
knights to y^ socoure of one of their princes which held the war in the
land of Perce* So it happened that he inette with an host of their own
people that returned home again saying unto him y^ the men of Perce shot
arowes so thycke that it took a way the light of the son* This good ca
pytayne when he saw y^ the people was thus aferde / answered them with a manly
chere / saying y^ they had brought hy^ good tidings for then he said they
should fight much y^ bet ^^^ / for because of the shadow / and by his hardy
and manly worcester ^es and the good amony^yons y^ he showed them caused them to
return again with him and faught rygorously and wan y^ field with great worship.
The. iii. knight was of ^rece ^ and was sent forth to y^ socours of a Cite with
a felawshyp of men of arms / and when he was come in to y^ fortress / y^
cytez^^s which durst not issue out of their walls for fere of their enemies
they she(...) him the great hyghte of their walls / and the great depen^sse of
their dyches / ^hiche they rejoiced them gretely in. ^hen he answered them in
this wise / if so be that ye have made them for women it is good* But and ye
have made them for men ^it is a great shame and a lewd thing / y^ ye tryst
more to be enclosed within your walls / and your dyches / than in the might
and stre^^ the of your own persons* And thus by his good amonysshynges / and
wise reasons gave them such comfort that they were bold for to assail their
enmyes which before time they durst in no wise do. And by the good amonyeyon
of this worcester thy knight they dyscomfyted their enemies and caused them to break
the syege.

Ensample of worthy knights. Capitulo. xli.
OF great vygoure was that worthy knight whi che was well nourysshed with Iulyus
Cezar whose name was called Scenola to whom was given and to other knights a
passage for to keep and a tower against the host of Pomp ye while y^ wars
endured between them / So it happened that y^ host of Pomp ye thought to give
them a great assa^^telin so mythe that this knight had much pain to defend
himself from his enemies / for they charged him passing sore / so the batay
^e was passing strong and cruel. For there were many worcester thy men on both
parties. But this Scenola which was as hardy as a lion did so great deeds of
arms that it was mer uayle to tell / and suffered so much pain in defense of
his place* that he was passing sore hurt / and in his fighting he said to
his knights / now for the gentle knights and felowes^ break the darts of
your enemies with your feet and receive their ^^owe hedes in your throtes / and
we shall overcome them* For in the mean time y^ we dye / he shall come y^
shall rescowe this for ^^esse / and too speak in few words his language and
his deeds were so mothe that he ought to be put in memory / for he by his good
amonycyons and ensamples of his deeds increased so y^ cou rages of his
felawshyp y^ they dred no death but fought meruaylously. Then he went up to
the tower and cast the deed men upon the quycke / and drove them down fro the
walls y^ were entering up / he cut of the hondes of them that touched y^ wall
les above / and cast stones and other things y^ he might get without
ceasing. But to speak shortly he^lue so many that the hepe of the deed men
was as high as the top of the wall as the old auctours witnesses / which
wrote the noble acts and deeds of y^ Romans. And then he lepte out among
his enemies / then anon they ran upon him on every side and he faught so
sore that his sword was so grecy of the blood / and so blunted with strokes
that it might cut no more. And his enemies cast so fast the dattes at him
that often times the darts met together and took away y^ stroke. And thus he
en dured long / like as ^ucan witnesses of him and of his mer uaylous deeds /
seeing also y^ there was so great preese about him that he might uneath dure
noolenger. And among all other strokes he was smyten with an arowe in y^ lift
eye / but anon he raced out the arowe of his heed*and the eye withal / and
trade upon it. And when he saw that he was so ^ore hurt y^ he might not well
endure no longer / he feigned himself that he was repentaunte that ever he
faught against the Cytezyns of Rome. And he said also that they ought to have
py^e on him / for as much as he was of their blood / and prayed them that one
of them might bring him before ^ompye for to cry hy^ mercy and there he would
dye. Then there was one in the place that byleued well his words / and came to
him for to have led him to Pompye and anon as he came nygh^ this Scena gave
him so great a stroke that he slew him stoone deed. And than anon they fell
upon him and slew him / and thus ended Scena one of the good knights of the
world.

^^ the foureth good condycyon y^ the worthy man of arms ^ught to have.
Capitulo. xlii.
^Ike as y^ state of noblesse / that is to know y^ the noble men be most set
on hight in the honors and worship pes of this world / In like wise it is
good reason that they be adourned with virtues / which for to say proprely is
the most noblesse / for without virtue nothing is noble / and this witnesses
Iuenall / which says / there is nothing that makes man noble but virtue /
and this sentence appears well. Boece in his book of consolacyon which
saythe*that the name of noblesse is but a vain thing / but it be lyghtened
with virtue and to this accords all the ancient auctours generally. Then
after all these sentences it is a necessary thing to all them y^ call
themself noble / to be virtuous / that is to say well manered / and also that
they hate all vice and flee from all unsitting things / which ben contrary
to noblesse / and that they love and to low all goodness / and good
condycyons. And for because y^ I have declared here tofore some of these
virtues concerning to the same / I will no more speak of them at this time.
But I will pass over and speak of the fourth good condycyon y^ I have showed
here tofore / which is necessary to all good knights and nobles / and that is
this / he ought to be true / in worde*in suit / and in his other and now I had
purposed me to speak hereof in this chapter. ^ut for as much as other times I
have charged myself in some of mine other volumes to speak of the blaming of
the right lewd vice of lyenge / which is contrary to truth and may not
suffycyentely enough be reproved by me / nor by none other / ^ will pass the
moore lyghtely over. ^ But in as much as it touches the noble men without fay
le I may some what say now that yt is a thing that is evil sitting unto
any noble man / and full dyshonourable. That is to wete / of them than ben so
tought as some ben y^ no true word comes out of their mouth / nor in their
promyses / nor in their faith may no man trust no more than the sym plest boy
of the world / I speak of some such as call themself noble* And truly if
such people consydred well what noblesse were / and how that they deserve
evil for to have the dygnyte thereof / they ought to be ^hamed and confounded /
and have little cause to be proud for the noblesse of their kynne / which is
failed in their own persons* And for to speak of the goodness of truth Iam
not worthy to speak suffycyently thereof / nor no man else can say enough
thereof. O how it is gretely allow ed and commended in holy scripture that god
is truth / and so he calls himself / And all the foundacyon of our faith
and believe is set upon that / all the feate of the Phylosophres and their
study was no thing elies but for to attain and search out the truth / And
this witnesses Arysto. le in his Metaphysyke / which he founded upon truth
/ in which book he speaks notably thereof / for he says that all moral
Philosophy is founded upon truth / and without that ^ll that ever we may do
in this moral life may not profit us. Alas these noble auncyentes which had
at that time no knowledge in the deuyne law / loved rather to dye than be
false of their faith / o^ to lie le^ynges* Than what shame should it be to
them that been crystened / that for a little thing or naught will ye and ^ors
were themself / that is pity to here: And of this we may show diverse
ensamples / as of a duke of Athenes which was up fortune taken in a battle /
notwithstondynge that his pertye had the better* Than his aduersarye which had
him in his prison / would have constrained him that he and his Cite should have
granted a truage payable yearly to y^ men of Athe nes, so upon y^ condycyo^ he
should be delivered free and quyte / and ^f he would not graut thereto / he
should dye a myscheuous death But the worthy duke answered and said that he had
promised and swore to them of Rome to maynteyne them and keep them in their
^^rysdyccyon and Fraunch yses / ^^o that by him they should not be am y^ysshed
nor brought in worse case And also it should not turn the^ to so great
p^^iudyce y^ loss of one man as y^ loss of their possessyo^* ^^r of as good a
prince / or a better tha^ he was they should sooner find / tha^ recouerynge of
their frau^ chyse / and it were ones lost* And th^s he had such faith and lo
ue to his subjects for to hold that he promised them y^ he cha se rather for
to dye tha^ to be against his promise. ^ There was a great feate and kept well
his truth / the noble Romayne prince which ^alere speaks of y^ was named
Actylyus Regulus / which after that he had dyscomfyted a battle and a great
host of the ^artagyences / they of ^artage for toauenye themself sent for*
antyperus king of Lacedemone and fau ght a new battle / which battle
fortuned to be against the consule Actylyus / so that he was dyscomfyted and
himself taken. So when it came to the end of five year / Orose says that the
^artagyences sent their embassadoures to Rome and with them this noble man
Actylyus / but they made him swear upon his gods that if case were that they
could not acco^ ^^ that he should return again to prison / and this was
their message to the Romans that they should yield again all y^ prisoners
that were taken in the syrst battle / and they would ^^lde them again this
noble knight Actylyus / And when the ^enatours of Rome had well understand
this message / they besought this noble man ^ctylyus that he would give them
counsel in the said matter / as far as his wisdom would give him ^^ut this
noble knight set not so much by h^^ person that he would counsel them nor
advise them / y^ for his person only they should deliver so great a quantyte
of enemies for him* ^^r he said it was not for the common profit that so many
men should be given for one man. And thus this noble man went home again to
^artage where that he ^n^ we well he should have great tourmentes / for he
knew full well y^ great cruelte of the ^artagyences. But he loved rather to dye
tha^ to live and be forsworn of that he had promised to y^ Romans. ^ And
sith it comes to the purpose that we speak of prysoneres for to show more of
the customs of Rome. That is to wete / when the prysoneres of ^ome were yielded
in as much as any prince of Rome had gotten the plain vyctory of the abuers
party which held them in prison / when the consule / that is to say the
prince was returned home again to Rome / and y^ he should enter in to y^
town / in his tryumphe like as it is said before / y^ prysoneres should go
before y^ chair with chapelettes of sylke on their heedes / which were made
of ^elued / and some of B^uers / as ^alere says / and ^^tus ^ynyus says that
their hedes was shaven in token y^ they were out of seruage / and both might
happen well to be / for they said than that the Chapelettes betokened lordshyp
and fredome ^ ^^t to the purpose that a man should keep his truth / and y^ it
will do harm and a man break it / It happened that Hanyball the Emperor of
Cartage was dyscomfyted by the Romans in the second battle / as ^ytus
^^nyus recyteth in the ^nde of his.x. book. The ^artagyences were constrained
to require the ^omaynes of peace / for the which they sen te their
embassadoures to Rome. and when they had purpo sed before the ^enatoures the
effect of their matter and the cause of their coming. ^hen for because that
they of ^artage had quytte them untruly in their promyses before time to the
Romans in their couenauntes and oaths / which they had made before / was
said unto them these words. ^y what ma nere of gods d^o ye swear the peace
now to us / sith ye have deceived and be for sworn by them that ye were
sworn upon before time. ^hen one of the embassadoures which was called
^^sdruball answered and said / we swear now by them that we swear before time
/ and them ye ought gretely to thank and owe them good will / for as much as
they have venged you well upon us for brekynge of our oath.

The first good condycyon that a worthy man shield have. Capitulo. xliii.*
I Have said here before that the first good condycyon that he which is a good
man of arms should desire to have is that he should love worship above all
thyn ges. And for because that it is an open thing that he should so desire /
it shall suffyse me to prove my rea sons by good ensamples of the worthy
auncyentes without sechynge of any other arguments. The worthy ^hemy^chocles
/ and noble knights / which I have spoken of before time in this book loved
and coueted so much the worship of knyghthode / that it was in his heart /
like as a sharp nedyl^^ which burnt so sore in desires of worship / that it
would let him have no peace. Then it was asked him of other knights why he
occupied himself so gretely without rest. Than he answered and said / for
because y^ the fair and high knyghtho des of mine auncetryes and their great
vyctoryes enflambeth my courage to follow their traces / so y^ I might attain
to ge te part of their excellent renownes / ^y my travail and excercy se in
arm. ^ut for because y^ I se myself so far from their great acts / it
makes me busy and full of thought / which will not lightly leave me. ^his good
knight was none of them y^ for one little good deed / thought that he had done
many excellent deeds / and was in y^ time of ^ulcyades y^ duke of Athenes and
was in the battle that was called the battle of ^araton against the percyens /
like as Iustyne recordet^ in the second book of his stories which commends
gretely his virtue and his great knyghthode / which battle was meruaylous
great and fyers and by the manhood and worthynes of this knight they of Athenes
gate the vyctory \ And yet he thought that he had done but right a little
thing. \ So for because that some maynteyne and say that there is no honor
but in richesse / and without richesse honor might not be had. \ I say
saving the reverence / that opinion is false and untrue. For let us sup pose
that honor be not given at this day as the auncyentes did of old time to
them that were virtuous / but begy^en to them that be rich / ^et there can no
man take away from him that is virtuous / but that he ought to be commended in
the same / and gretely allowed in his virtue. And also every man says more good
of him / and more reverence longs unto him than men show or do unto him /
which laud and praysynge as me seems is more to commend than the other /
though so be y^ he ^e poor and the other rich / to whom before his vysage
men will give a great recommendacyon / and behind his back will curse him
for his vices. And so to y^ purpose in old time their virtues was their
worship / and not richesse / wherefore men did gretter pain in those days for
to get virtues / the rychesses or any other treasures And of this we have in
the stories of Rome by the will of all the Senators / that is to say of all the princes of the counsel / was ordained that this noble knight Cyronatus
for his great virtues and manhood was cho sen to be made a dyctatoure / which
was the greatest estate of Rome / like as a man might say an emperor / which
story is right profitable to be herd / as ^ytus ^yuyus says / to the^ that
desire manhood and worship / more tha^ richesse* for he was a passing famous
man / and yet he was right poore^ and for his great manhood and worthynes / he
was the man in the world y^ the Romans had most the trust i^* And for
because that he was so gretely trusted among the Romans / it happened y^ a
great host of them of Rome which were sent against their enemies / were so
sore constrained by their enemies that they were feign to take a relde and
dyche it \ And pale it about too save them from their enemies* And when they
of Rome her de thereof they took out a no^bre of knights with a great multitude
of people for to send to the rescowes ot their people that were besyeged /
than were they dystytute of a good cheuetayne* where upon they sent unto the
house of this worthy man which dwelled without Rome and there they found him
in ry ght simple manner considering the great estate of his person /
nevertheless as soon as he herd of the great daungere of the people that
were besyeged / forth withal he took these knights and the people which was
assygned by the Cite and went to the field* And to speak shortly of this
matter what by his wisdom and his manhood dyscomfyted them y^ had besyeged y^
Romans / and when they were dyscomfyted he departed the good y^ was gotten in
the field among his people which were causers of the dyscomfyture of the
field / and not to them that were besyeged for he blamed them gretely / and he
deposed y^ co^sule ye led them of his office / for because he would ^ustre him
self to be besyeged in his lodging / which lodging he had enforced with
dyches and a great pale: Than he said that man was not worthy to have an office
of so great a dygnyte and worship as to be a consule to suffer himself to be
closed about / he having such a people with him / but trusted moore in his
pa^e and his dyches than in the manhood of his people / and also the arms of
y^ Romans were not acustomed to be worn in pla ces closed. ^et of the same
y^ the ancient men praised more the virtues than riches / Ualere tells in
the third chapter of his fourth book of a noble knight y^ was of a
worshypfull lygnage that after the time that he had done many notable deeds
of high and mighty hatyles a yenste the Uolques / and in other places also /
and taken one of their castelles ^ which was passing mighty and strong that
was called ^onolon for which cause afterward he was named ^onolannus in his
sure name / which was a great reward for his demerytes and a great worship in
those days and that worship he refused not. But as for other great rewards of
good he set not by it / for it was offered him after y^ customs of Rome
which was ordained for worshypful men y^ had deserved an hundred Iour nays of
land / y^ is to know as much land as a ploughe might ere in an hundred
days. Also he should have. x. prisoners of the best that he would chose of
them that were taken at that time / and. x. rich horses well armed and ordained
for ye war and. x. great oxen / and as much silver as he might bear / but of
all this would he none but a prisoner that had been his host that had done him
great favor before time / which he thought to quyte / for his goodness / and
so he did / for he pardoned him of his prison / and gave him a good courser
for to here him in to battle and need were ^^ ^r which virtue Ualere says
that men wist never of which he gate more worship / of that y^ he chase / or
else of that y^ he refused / that is to know of taking so little / or
refusing of to great a gift.

pet of the same / and how men worshypped in old time the worshypfull
knights after their. deserts.
COntynuynge our purpose that in old time the auncyentes loved better worship
than riches like as every worshypful man ought to do / Ualere speaks of y^
last Sypyon Auffrycan. I say y^ last for because there were two Sypyons which
were both so worthy y^ no man could well deserne the one from the other in
worthynes. And for bocause that both of them conquered Affryke by great
travail and many batayles whereof the first conquered it for the Romans / and
after that it was rebelled. The other conquered it again with great dyf
fyculte / Nevertheless they were both called Affrykans / But this last
destroyed the Cite of Cartage / and the cite also of Mu nya^^ce / and held
war against the gauls which ben called now Frensshe men. And he warred also
against the Lumbar des and had the vyctory of them. So after all these vyctoryes
he would depart the honors and the goods to the knights whi che had been at
ye conquestes. Then he commanded like as was the usage at y^ time yt men
should bring unto the cheuetayne or to ye prince of the battle all ye
worshypfull acts that ye worcester shypful knights and men of war did / for
there were certay ne men like as we may say herawdes now a days / which were
ordained to do such things / and they had great charge for to take good head
which me^ did their deuoyre to y^ enten te y^ they might be well rewarded
after their del^rtes / and such as did not their part should be rebuked / so
among all other there was one knight y^ quyt himself so well in y^ field yt
some said he had well deserved a certain Jewel of gold y^ was ordained to be
worn upon y^ arm of such folks as had done such semblable prowesses as he
had done / and this Jewel was called Armel^es. Tha^ Sypyon made inquire of
this knight whyder he had done on y great prowess before y^ time / or else y^
such adventure happened fall to hy^ at y^ season / tha^ it was found y^ it
was ye first great prowess yt ever he did before / but they said y^ him seemed
to be of good will and of manly courage. Sypyon thought he would assay him / and
let call him unto his ^lence and made to give him a some of gold / like as we
might say of Florynts / right largely and plenteously / and said to him y^
shalt ^e paid lryches for thy good deed / but not in worship when this knight
which had received ye gold herd him say so / he was shamefast and passing
sorry. And anon he took ye gold and cast it down at ye fete of Stypyon* ^hen
it was asked him whyther he had lever to be rewarded and worshyped by the
signs of manhood and prowess / or else to be rewarded in money for his noble
deeds / he said he had lever have worship than the reward of money* ^hen
Stypyon praised him gre tely and loved him better than he did before* And for
because that he should be constaunt and persevering in arms ma de give him y^
sign of silver which was ordained for them y^ had done semblable acts of the
prowess y^ he had done himself at y^ ^ournay / and had him that he should
contynewe and get another y^ was made of gold / and other signs also y^ was
ordained for them y^ were worshypfull. And Stypyon showed this / for because y^
honor ought not to be given entyerly for one good deed / which by adventure
comes at some one time but he would y^ it should parseuer in ma^ly deeds and
good works

^ How Lechery and delytes ben often times cause to dystrow ble a man that he
may not get worship and valyaunce Capitulo. xliiii.
^ Or to get worship he that desires to obtain it in ar mes / in which
matter we be in this party of the book and semblably in all manners that worship
may be found in like as a man ought to pursue all things that been couenable
to come to worship / in like wise he should eschew al things that may let
him from it / or trouble him of his entente* And for because that I find in
writing y^ among all other vices the vice of delight and Lechery is that most
draws a way the good deeds of them which had begone of long time before to
profit in worship / notwtstondynge like as I have treated here tofore in
speaking to princes / and now is necessary to proced of all other y^ occupy
the ^eate of arms. And that it is necessary also to show how they should
eschew these vices before rehearsed / we will bring to mind diverse ensamples
whi che ben found in stories ^t auncyentes. The host of ye great Anth y^cus
king of Perce and Dayse / happened by diverse times ^o overcome ye Romans /
and often times put them in great affraye* And after y^ they had by diverse
times ouerco me them in the parties of Greece* they went to rest them al y^
winter in ^alcedy / in which land the vices above rehereto were gretely used
/ that is to say* ^^ delytes / in lechery / in play es and dysportes as long
as winter lasted / in so much that the people of this host before said were
made passing soft in their deeds* Then it happened as Macrobe says / when
Anthyocus the prince would have gone again unto the war upon the Romans /
took the mustres to ^e the strength and the noblesse of his host / and asked
of Hanyball which was at that time with him whether he had people ynowe with
him for to fight with the Romans / to whom Hanyball answered saying that he
had people ynowe / notwithstondynge that he was right a covetous man. But this
answer was not suffycyent to the entente of Anthyocus / For he would have
asked wheder he had puyssaunce enough to overcome the Romans. And hanybal
which had by diverse times proved their strenst the and virtue and law that
the knights of Anthyocus were fallen in to great delytes and pleasaunces / and
more full of boostynge than of good deeds of knyghthode answered and said / The
Romans ought to hold them content with the richesse that was in the host /
notwithstondynge that they were right covetous people / and it happened even to
be so as he extemed. For notwithstondynge that this prince which in stories is
called the great Anthyocus was so rich and of so great might that he sent in
a battle against y^ Romans an hundred and nine olyfauntes which bare every
of them a tower ^^ his back made of tymbre in which was great multitude o^
men of arms* and his host was so great that it covered most tay^les and
valayes / yet was he at the last ouercomen with ye Romans. yet to this
purpose that delytes and ^uer great ca^^^ makes less and febleth the courages
of men / some say that the Cite of Uolques was right rich and well enuyron
ned with walls / and as in goods it was the rychest ^^te of all the land of
^ crussye / but by the great mordynate richesse it was enclyned all to delytes
and Lechery / for the which as soon as these vices had domynacyon it felt in
de^^yne / by the which it wexed feeble in defense of it self / for which
cause it was subdued by bond men / wherefore it is to be noted that by the
inconuenyentes of this vice follows many great mysche ues / for the which
every man that is worshypfull ought to ta ke head to eschew that evil vice /
which may be cause of taking away of great honor of pryuces / and in like
wise of all other persons.

How the old auncyentes guerdoned ye good deeds of worthy men after their
deserts / and not after tauoure. And also ^^ the honors that they did unto
him. Capitulo. xlv.
Now to come again to our first purpose that ye good men of arms ought
rather to love worship than any other things / we have proved right enough /
and have showed by diverse ensamples how the old worshypfull men were courtyse
for to get worship / and also how they were rewarded for their good deeds:
And yet we will show one ensample how these rewards were given without
favor. Ualere says y^ wha^ a noble man of Rome y^ was called ^alpurynus ^yse
/ was ma de consule and prince of a great host / and by his manhood and prow
esse had delivered ^^cyle by diverse great batayles / and should come to give y^
rewards to his people after y^ Romayne custo mes every man after his
deseruynge. This said ^alpurynus had a sone which was right a worthy knight /
and for the good deeds y^ he had done in the battle / they y^ were reportours
of y^ worshypfull acts y^ men did / Iuged him a crown of gold and said that
he had right well deserved it. But the fader die de long debate against it / and
said that the other had deserved* it better than he / notwithstondynge at the
last though the fader were never so sore against it / yet of very right was
Iuged, him to be rewarded with the crown by the common voice / and* trust
truly he had lever have worn that crown as they used to were them in those
days than to have been rewarded with a great some of gold. yet more of the
honor that men did in that time to such as were worshypfull warryoures /
which worship was more desired than any other thing in the world at that
time. Ualere tells when y^ any man had done any deed in arms passing any
other men in valyaunce and worthynesse. The Romans caused to make his image
right nobly and set it in a certain place of worship which was ordained for
the nones / and under them made write their na mes and their sure names and the
great pryncypall deeds y^ they had done / and thus they did for because they
should always be had in mind / and y^ other men should take ensample of their
worthynesse / to that entente that they should pain themself for to get
worshyppes and honors / and in like wise they did by ye clerks. For and
there were any solemn phylosophre or any man or woman that passed other
soueraynely in shotynge or in any science like as y^ sage sybyle / or else a
work man y^ cou ^e ^arue images yt never was seen none such before they had*
certain things ordained for the nones / which was gret^ worship to them and
caused them to set their attendaunce more ententyfely upon their occupacyon.
And thus as ye here they were set in those days all in couetyse of worship /
which coue tyse Ualere preueth by ensample that the virtuous man will certainly
that honour^ lawde / and reverence be given to him like as we may say by Sypyon
Affrycan y^ right virtuous man which made set the image and the figure of
Enn^us the poet among the images of the noble men of his lygnage for because
that he had commended in his dytees the noble ac tes of this Sypyon Affrycan.
And for because that some men might say against this opinion arguing that
honor and glory ought not to be desired in this world / but be holde^ as for
naught. Ualere shows how they which in their books techeth / that glory
and honor (...)de be set at naught / desire it themself and would have it
as other have / and says in this wise that glory is not despised of them that
enforce themself to teache the dyspysynge o^ the same / for they set the names
of them dylygently in their volumes and books whi che they have drawn out and
written and commends the dyspysynge of glory, in lowynge them that set not
thereby / yet notwithstondynge they would have glory / for because yt they would
draw to mind their names by writing in their books* And so to conclude this
chapter we say that the good and worshypfull men ought and may desire glory /
and in deed they will have it and they may / notwithsto^dynge y^ ^oece in y^
third book of co^solacyon / in y^. ^^^ prose holds against and dysco^mende th
the^ y^ to inordynately secheth worldely glory / and not without cau se as to y^
spyrytuall life. But for to live morally after y^ actyfe living it is no vice
who that desires it for a Just cause.

Here it speaks of the syxte good condycyon that the worthy man of arms ought
to have. Capitulo. xlvi.
THe syxte good condycyon y^ the good man of* arms ought to have as I have
said here tofore is that h^ should be wise / well aduysed / and cautelous in
deeds* that may fall in arms / and in all manner feats of knyghthode / And
for because that we will bring to mind by ensample the cautelous deeds of
knyghthode / and worthy men that did y^ great conquestes and great things in
their time / which may be causers to bring such things again to mind /
to that entente that they in time y^ now is may use such feats and not to
be deceived in them / we will show you here after following like as auctoures
recyteth / and also Ualere that names such subtyltees to overcome and noye
his enemy Stratagones. But the first ensample we will spe ke of ^hylostratus
that was duke of Athenes / which as sto ryes says was right subtell and well
aduysed in all things / and specially in the feate of war* ^or true it was
that they of a Cite of Greece that was called ^egara / bare it forth under
dys^y^ulacyo^* But in the time of this ^hylostratus they of Megera thought by a
certain wyle to find a mean to be avenged upon them of Athenes / for they
had not forgoten y^ gre te hurtes and greues that they had done them before
time / so they remembered them that the people of Athenes were yearly acustomed
to go in to the isle of ^uletre / where the lady of Athenes went on pilgrimage
at a certain day in the year / where upon they of Megera let ordain their
nauye of ships and / thought they would avenge them on their enemies semynge
to the^ that y^ Athenyences would take no head of such thyn ges* But this
Phylostrates duke of Athenes which had a knowledge of this thing ordained
that y^ ladies should hold their purpose like as they had acustomed before
time / and that they should make gretter array and gretter feast tha^ they used
be fore time to y^ purpose that they of Megera should not think they were
escaped. So this ^hylostratus took to him a good felawshyp of men of arms and
went before in to the (...)* and put him in a busshement / and anon as the
men of Megera were come to land he brake his busshement and fell upon his
enemies and slew them euerychone. And when this was done ^hylostratus entered in
to their ships / and took with him many of the ladies that were best besene
and rychest arrayed and took his course toward Megera / to that entente yt they
of Megera should understand that it was their own people for because they
saw so many ladies come with them / and supposed also that they had gotten
great goods withal. For they knew well their own nauye and their tokens /
and for y^ gre te Joy that they had of this deed every man drew to the port
and they went hastily to land and killed and slew the most party of the
people. And anon after took the cite. ^aryus that was chosen king of Perce
and Mede for the n^y^nge of his horse / assembled six hundred thousand men /
as Iustyne says in his second book for to destroy the Athenyences and their
land. They of Athenes herd thereof sent for socours to Lacedemone and to
other lands but they tarried passing lon ge. Then ^yl^yades that was at that
time duke of Athenes which made to nomble his people and found that he had
but x. thousand of his own men / and a thousand of strangers yet this
worshypfull man had more trust to run upon his enemies then to tarry for the
help of them that were coming notwithstondynge many of his men held a yenst
it incuerthelesse he went so hastily upon them that or they could beware or
make themself ready they were among them and took them out of ara ye in such
wise that they were dyscomfyted / so by this good wyle and manhood. xi.
thousand dyscomfyted six hundred thousand of the Percyens. Ualere says that
Ha nyball the Emperor of Cartage hated gretely the right no ble Romayne
prince that was named Fabyus ^aximus for because that he had done him many
grievous hurtes in ba tail / and at all times made great resystence against his
great host. And ^ytus ^ynyus says also that he was the prince in Rome that
Hanyball most hated. This said Fabyus was a dyctatour which was the
soueraynest office of Rome and led with him a great host where so ever he
went. Then this ha nyball bethought him on a wyle and labored sore for to
noye Fabyus / so that he took his host and went in to ytaly / and destroyed
all the low country what with sword and fire except y^ lands and manners of
y^ dyctatour Fabyus Marymus / to that entente that they of Rome should have a
suspeccyon that there were made some alyaunce among them / and yet he did mo
re for he found a way to send to Rome a letter closed which came to the
hondes of the counsaylours of Rome and was dyrected to Fabyus from Hanyball
which was not at that ty in the ^yte / and it seemed by the contynewe of the
letters that there had been between them great famylyaryte and promyses / by the
which it seemed that Hanyball was come to his intent But and the Romans had
not known the great truth of Fabyus / and the great malice of Hanyball it
might have been cause of the destruccyon of this noble prince.

Of the wise connsayle in arms that knights should use. Capitulo. xlvii.
^Owe that al good princes and knyghtly men ought to be well aduysed and well
understand of the condycyons of the wisdom / and the malice of his adversary
/ and inquire if he acustomed to use in his werkynges cautelous and couerte way
es / it appears that he ought to do it by such ensamples as to loweth /
which ought for to give a man cause for to keep him self from such malycyous
persons / like as ye wise man cou^ sayleth and says / keep the from that
person that governs himself by malice / For when he speaks fairest to the
/ take best head to thyselfe / For the malycyous man fares as a catte that
lies long in a wait for ye mo^^se / and as soon as he is ware of the mo^^se
and cast for to take her / he will wagge his tail as it were for love / In
like wise ye frawdelent man wat cheth his point and his time by long space /
but when he sethe his season and his hour than will he laughe upon him that he
casts to deceive / and suddenly he will run upon him / like as it is written
of a king y^ was lord of a great party of Greece y^ was meruaylously full of
frawde and passing cautelous* This king hated much the Romans and had
passing great envy to them. But for because y^ he durst not plainly defye
them for their great power which he doubted gretely* used a wyle and feigned
himself gretely to be their friend for y^ great reputacyon that he herd of
them* For he knew well that there was nothing that so much ouercometh the
heart of a man as does fair gifts fro whens that ever they come / wherefore he
sent them often times great presents and fair language withal to the
pryncypall counsaylours of Rome. And by this mean he understood much of their
werkynge / and after this he found many diverse means for to anoye and hurt
the To maynes* But when y^ Romans would have gone upon him for to have
chastysed him his good friends y^ he had gotten be fore at Rome were always ready
for to answer for him and made his peace* And under this four me he was often
times saved y^ the Romans made no war upon him* ^et this cautelous king
did more / for he feigned himself that he had great desire to go to Rome to se
the great magnyfycence of the ^y^e / and offered himself to the princes to do
them what service that he could / where upon he was well received and gretely
worship ^ed / and as long as he was there he showed so great frendeshyp to the
princes that no man might show more* But wha^ th^^ come to him for to make him
any disporte / anon he would ma ke dyscorde among them / and feigned to every
man / y^ he said it for their great profit / and prayed them to keep it
secretly / till they saw their time / in so much that he made hate amon ge
them / and wha^ he ^awe that* he had set hate enough amon ge* them and that he
had well aduysed and understand the ordy dance and the rule of the Cite he
took his leave and departed out of the town* And as he went out of the gates
of Rome he spoke so loud that many men herd him / saying that y^ cite of
Rome was passing strong / but it was light for to win who that had money
enough for to give: This ensample is to be noted and understand that of him
that is known an enemy and fraudelent withal. And also that he will be ready
to give evil counsel / man beware of him. For ^^yde say th / that the gods
only will be apeased only by force of gyf tes. ^et to the same purpose.
Tarquynyus the king of To me had holden a syege long time before the cite of
Galbyne / and might in no wise get it. This Tarquyne had a sone which was
right subtle and thought to find a subtylte for too get this cite / and took
a knyfe and hurt himself / and when he had so done he sent pryuely in to the
cite / and showed them how y^ his fader the king had beten him / and farde
foul with him / where upon he would be avenged if he might / and if it lyked
them he would be their friend with all his power / and prayde them y^ they
would receive him in to their cite / Then they of the cite supposed y^ he had
said truth received him with great Ioy^ / Then he made a grievous complaynte
upon his fader* and he flatered them so well that within a little space they
made him as a master of the Cite / and a sovereign. and when he understood
that he was master of all he sent a messyngere pryuely to his fader saying /
that cautele ouercometh all thing* The king answered nothing again but
seemed that he was al pen syfe / and took this messyngere with him in to a
garden where that he found many popyes / then he took a little rod and as he
came by them he with the rod smote or their hedes / and he went so long
about that at the last he smote of all the great popy heedes and left never
one. Then the messyngere asked of ye king wheder he would any thing else to
his sone / he said y^ he would send noone other thing. Then the messyngere
came again to his sone and said that his fader sent him no answer again /
but it seemed by his countenance that he was wroth / for as he came by many
popyes in a gardyne he would always smite of all the great hedes that he
found of the popyes. ^he son understood well all his words and anon he
found a mean to make a surmyse upon the grettest men of the Cite saying that
they had co^^^^red against him / and would deliver the Cite and him also to the
king his fader / and anon he made smite of their hedes. And when there were
no cheuetaynes left that durst say nay against him / he fair delivered the
Cite unto his fader. And of this story diverse auctours makes mencyon / and
namely ^y tus Lynyus. Also in the time that the Cite of Rome was taken by the
Gauls / which now ben called Frensshe men / and had besyeged the Capytoll
which was imprenable save only by ^am yne / and supposed for to do so in
deed. But the Romans that were wyly people for to put them that were without
in dyspayre they took such goods as they had and made gre te rely^te / of
gold / of bread / and flesh / and of al manner of gray ues / and cast it out
over the walls in a fair place where the Frensshe men might find it. ^^d
when the frensshemen saw this / they were gretely abashed / and demed that
they had gre te plente of vytayles within them / which in deed they had not
^hen drew they anon to treat of peace Also Ualere says y^ Hanyball before or
he fought with ye Romans in ye grete^ fyers battle which was called y^
battle of ye ^ance which was a dolorous and a heavy day for y^ Romans / he
used three ma ner of wyles. For y^ first he aduysed y^ he would have y^ sone on
his back / and y^ duste also which was passing great for y^ gre te wind y^
blewe. Another wyle he ordained y^ as soon as ye battle began to Join a
part of his people should make a se^blaunce for to fle / and so it was / for
he had laid a busshement y^ and any man followed them they should run upon
them y^ lay in the busshement / and so it happneed to fall / for certain of
the Romans followed y^ chase and came there as the busshement lay / and there
they fell on the Romans and slew them euerychone. Also he ordained y^ a party
of his people should yield them anon in goodly wise to ye Romans / and so
they did. ^hen as the manner was at y^ time they were unarmed and set behind
y^ batay le / and these me^ had couertely next their skin short swords and
well cuttynge / and when ye Romans were on ho^de in y^ battle they fair drew
out their swords and fell behind them and cut their legs and slew much
people / and by this mean says Uale re was y^ strength of Rome overcome by ye
malice of Affryke.

yet ensample of the wise cauteles in arms.
PErycles that was duke of Athenes was of very force driven by them of
^oloponense in to a place that was closed about with many great mountayns /
where there were but two yssues for to go in or out / and when he saw that he
was thus enclosed / anon he let make against the one of the yssues a strenge
deep dytche semynge that it was made for because that his enemies should not
enter in at that place. and at the other yssewe he was himself with his people
as they would yssewe out when them list by force. The enemies which supposed
that he would not yssewe out at the other place / for because the dytche was
made so meruaylous strong / went all to the other ys^e we for to keep that /
and there they made watch that they should not come out. Then anon Perycles
made lay over brydges of Tymbre that he had / let make and issued out saufe
/ he and all his people. Also the host of Rome should pass by the forest of
Latyne for to go upon them of Uoyens And when they of Uoyens saw that / they
went in to ye said forest and sawed many of the trees as good as in two and
put themself in a busshement fast by / And anon as the host of y^ Romans
was entered in to the forest y^ Uoyens assailed out on every side and put down
the trees that were next them upon the Romans / and by that means they
dyscomfyted and slew all the Romayne host. Also Alyxsaunder the king of Epyre
had great war with the Elyryens* And upon a time he bethought him on a
cautele and ordained him a great many of garments such as y^ Elyryens used to
were upon they^ harneys*and anon let cast them upon his own meyne / and when
he understood that his enemies were come nyghe unto him / he commanded his men
which were arrayed in these garments / and commanded them to set fire in
the houses about them / which was in his own land / and when the Elyry ens
saw that the houses were set on fire they supposed that it had been done by
their own felawshyp / for because they we re arrayed in such garments as they
used / and ran fast to help them / and passed thrughe a strayte passage for
to come to them / And there this said Alysau^dre had laid a great busshe meant*
and when they were in y^ strayte the busshement brake upon them* and ^lue them
euerychone. Also they that fought against ^ people y^ were called Heryceres /
took a spy of their enemies and slew him / and took all his clothes and cast
them upon one of their own men that was like to his bygnes / and made him go^
up to an high hill where he might se the host of his enemies / and anon he
made a sign that they should come forth in all that they might / and so they
did. For they want t^ had been their own spy which they sent forth / and
so by this mean they were ouerth* own / for they came among y^ busshe meant
of their enemies / where they were all slain and taken. Also Leutulus had need
of sowdyours and so he waged a certain nombre of men of Macydone / And when
this Leutu lus was somewhat approached nyghe his enemyes*they of Ma cedone which
doubted to have the worse of the battle depar ted out of the host for to go
to the other party / And when Leu tulus saw this myschete / anon he made all
the host follow them in ordinance of battle / when the enemies saw them
come on / under such form / they supposed that they of Ma cedone came upon
them to begin y^ battle for because y^ they came so before the other / and
forth withal they shot and can their darts in all that ever they might /
where as they thought for to have yielded them before / and with y^ Leutulus
came on with his people / and by y^ mean he had y^ field and dyscomfyted his
enemies

yet of the same.
AUlyus Nobylyus happened on a time to be so sore oppressed with his enemies y^
of necessyte he was compel led to fight with them of Samyte / which had a
passing great host / and he had but right a small felawshyp which were right
sore aferde for because they saw themself so few and their memyes so many /
when Aulyus saw y^ gretefer^ of his people remembered himself upon a wyle and
said unto them / ^yrs quod he yonder people yt ye se ben half ours / for I
have so cor rupte them with good that within a while they will turn to our
part ye when y^ battle is ones begone / and for to make his opy nyon good he
borrowed all y^ money yt he could of his people / as who says / to pay all y^
leg yon of people ^ he had gotten to be on his party. ^legyon is in nombre. vi
(...)vi. ^. lxvii. and in trust of this they took them such wise to fight
that by the mea nes of their great courage / and the wisdom of Aulyus they had
the vyctory of their enemies. Also ^anymedas the du ke of Thebes should fight
against them of Lacedemone / and for because that he would encreace the courage
and ye hardynesse of his people made them for to assemble before him in a
certain place. And there he showed unto them how y^ for very truth the
Lacedemones had ordained if so were that they had ye vyctory that they would
s^e all the men women / and children of the Cite of Thebes / for which cause
they of Thebes when they understood this they were so moved with anger that
they fought like wode men / and so by that wyle they overcame their enemies.
And yet to the purpose that it longs to a cheuetayne or to a condytoure of an
host specially that he should be wy^e and well aduysed as well in deed as in
word / follows y^ ensample as ye shall here afterward / when the last
Affrycan ^hyppyon led his host by see in to Affryke happened as he went out
of his ship for to go to land / he tell down flat on the Earth / for which
cause his people were strongly abashed and thought they should not speed well.
Then this wise prince when he saw his knights and his people were so sad
and half mated in their opinion / anon he thought to ease their hertes and
laid with a merry spyryte when he was up. ^oo felawes quod he / here is a sign
of possessyon / now go we hens my good knights / for I have now won Affryke
/ and thus he recomforted them / and even as he said it fell. Sertoryus was
gone with a great host of Romans a yenst a people that were enemies to ^ome
/ and suddenly there appeared to them a meruaylous sign. For all the ^he^des of
the men of arms / and all y^ breasts of their horses seemed as it had been al
blood. This Sertoryus which was a wise cheuetayne saw that his peo ple were
sore aferde / and had great marvel of this strange sign / said unto them
with a glad countenance* ^ow blessed be god quod he / for I understand by
this that we shall have y^ vyctory of our enemies. For now I know well that
this is ^ party that must be made read with the blood of their enemies ^et for
to speak of such folks that been so well aduysed that by their good wisdom
and pretty cau^^les can put away evil suspeccyon of the people / Ualere says /
when Hanyball y^ Em peroure of Auffryke and Cartage was fled for socoure to
y^ king of ^rete for fere of the Romans after that y^ good for tune was
turned to the evil / he perceived that they of the sa me country had envy at
him for because of the great vyctory es which were fortuned him before time /
and held him the re in manner for suspecte / and fered him lest he would take
any enterprise upon them. Anon therefore he bethought him upon a wyle to put
them in a suretye that they should have nosu^pec cyou upon him. And also that
he might save that little good that he had brought with him from spoylynge he
let take ^^ fers and certain ves^elles and filled them full of leede as
though it had been his treasoure / his Iewelles / and his vessel / and brought
it unto y^ Temple of ^yane y^ gods / like as it shol de seem that he was
rich enough to withstonde his evil for tune / for which cause they of ^rete
held them evil content^ and were well appeased without any suspeccyon.

Thus ends the second part of this book.
Here begins the third party of this book / which is re dressed to y^
universal people*
The first chapter speaks how y^ all manner of states ought to be gadred as
one. ^^. xlviii.


AFter the matter that we have spoken of here tofore which touched y^
introduceyon of pryn ces like as it is contained in the first party of this
book. The which said prince or princes we have taken for the heed of the body
of Polycye / as it has been showed here tofore. / and following after that /
in the second party is showed to the ensygnement of the nobles / and knights
/ which we take for the hondes* and the arms / we will now sewe after this /
with the grace of god to show in the third part of this book such matters
as we can find in the auctorytes of the ol de auncyentes / for the welfare and
profit of such things as longs to y^ remenaunt of y^ body of Polycye. That
is to know of the universal people that we take for the Belly / ^or y^ leg ges
/ and for the fete / to that entente that all may be refered / and Joined in
one quycke body parfyte and hole. For like as y^ bo die of a man is dyffectyfe
and dyffourmed when he lacks any of his members. In like wise the body of
Polycye may not be parfyte ne entyre if these estates that we have spoken of
here tofore be not well Joined and assembled all in one / so that every of them
may help other / and echone of them to excercyse that office that they be
called to / which diverse offices ben or deyned for the conseruacyon of all ye
hole body / like as ye members of a man's body helps to govern and
nourysshe all ye body / and as soon as any of them fails / of every
necessyte all the body shall feel it / and shall be dyseased thereby* Now we must
show the manner how the last parties of the said body may be maynteyned in
health and prosperyte* For as me seems they be the susteynours and bear the
charge of all y^ surplus of ye said body / wherefore they have need of strength
and might for too bear the weight of the other parties* For the which cause as
we have said here tofore for the love and the charge y^ the good prince ought
to have to his subjects and his people / and also of the office of the nobles
which ben stablysshed for the gar^e and defense of the said people / we must
now speak of the love of the reverence / and obeysannce y^ the good people
ought have to their prince / wherefore we will speak universally of all / in as
much as this matter touches to all estates in one love / in one reverence /
and one obeysaunce. But afterward in speaking somethynge touching y^
augmentacyon of virtue* in their living / and the manner of their conuersacyon
may happen I will touch three manner of states dyfferenced / that been in
special as none in the said universal people. and for because y^ at some time
there fall murmuracyons among the three estates before said / That is to know
the Prince / the knyghthode / and the people. For because that it seems to the
one that ye other do not well their part in their offices / for which cause
debate might fall among them which is a thing right preiudycyable wha^ it
so falls. There is a moralyte fourmed ^maner of a ^able to the same purpose.
On a time there arose a great murmuracyon between ye body of man and his
members. ^he belly playned sore of the members and said y^ they thought harm
unto him and that they kept him not in ease as they should do. The members on
the other side playned on the belly and said that they were very weary for
labor. and yet all y^ ever they might labor / in going / in coming / and
trauaylynge was to little for to ^ynoe the belly / for he would have all / and
yet they might not fyl it / wherefore they said yt they would no more suffer
such pain ne^uche labor as they had done before / ^or all that ever they
might do could not fill the belly* wherefore they would seal of their work and
let the belly govern himself as he would. Then ye members seized of their
labou re / and the belly was no longer nourysshed. And anon the belly began to
were seen / and ye members failed and wexed feeble. And thus for despyte that
the one had to the other all perysshed togy de. In likewise it must fall when a
prince asks more of his people than they may bear / which shall cause ye
people to murmr against their prince / and rebel by dysobeysauce. So for
such manner of dyscorde all peryssheth together / wherefore I con clude y^ vnyo^
of accord is y^ co^seruacyo^ of al y^ hole body of Po lycy / and thus
witnesses* Salust which says y^ by co^cordelyte / things encreas and by
dyscorde great things perysshe and fall to naught.

Of the dyfference of diverse people* Ca. xlix.
^^r because y^ the babytacyon where we be resydent in as in the parties of
France / notwithstondynge that writing of books and specially such books
as touches ma ners and doctrynes which ought to be general to ye dwellers in all countries / for as much as books be profitable and borne in to diverse
countrees and regyons / it shall suffyse us to adresse our word and doctrine
to* ye people of France / which word and doctry ne may semblably serve to al
other regyons generally yt they will understand it after ye entente of ye
making for y^ showing of good ensample / for ye lands y^ be governed by me^
thru ghout all y^ world ben subject to diverse establysshynges after ye old
customs of countries. Some be governed by ^^^^^yo^ of Emperors / Other be
governed by succession of kings* and some by one mean and some by other. Also
there be ^ytees and lon des y^ have possessyon in lord^hyp and be governed by
princes su che as they will chose among themself / and some lo^des there be ye
govern themself more by will tha^ by reason / wherefore it hap th often*
times y^ like as they chose themself by will / likewise by will they will
depose them again / and this governance is not good ne profitable for ye
wealth of ye country y^ it is used in / like as i yealy* and many other places.
Other there be also y^ be go^^^ ned by certain lygnages of ye ^yte y^ is
called nobles / and they will suffer none other among the^ but of ye lygnage of
these nobles for to enter into their cou^sayles / nor to have y^ rule of their
ordynau^ces / like as (...) do at Uenyse which cite from y^ first fou^dacyo^
hyder to was never governed otherwise / other there be y^ be governed by their
old au^cyentes which be called ^^* chcuy^s / and in some places the small
people govern and * ben esta blysshed every year a certain of every craft /
and I believe y^ such governance is not al y^ ^^st profitable / and also it is
not seen y^ it (...) long where it is begon^^e ye lord where such rule is ^^
^ay (...) ^e greatly encrese and y^ reason is good ^ut now I will leave the
speaking hereof for because of shortness of time / and in this wise was governed
Boloyne de gra ce / nevertheless I should have to much to do for to speak
party culerly of every people. But for to chose the most couenable
establyshynge of the goueruaunce of Polycye / is only y^ unity of the people /
as Arystotle says in the third book of polycy kes^ For he says y^ y^ polycye
of one is good / y^ is to say y^ gouer naunce and lordshyp of one / and yet he
says it is but little good but of many it is full hard to be good / for
because of diverse opynyons and wylles that they have \ Than to our purpose I
hold the people of France right well blessed / for sith the time y^ it began
first which comes of the ys^ewe of Troya^s / it was never governed by
strange princes / but of them y^ they came first of from heir to heir / for
they have always reigned over them and governed them / like as it appears in y^
old stories and as chronicles makes m^ncyon of the same / which lordshyp of
these noble princes of ^raunce ben to y^ people as a thing very natural and
for that cause with the grace of god it is so y^ among all the royalmes or
lands of the world the people of France ben most natural and best love
their prince and most of obeysaunce / which is right a synguler and specyal
virtue and great laud unto them / and in that they deserve great m^ryte and
grace.

The obeysaunce that people on (...) ^aue to their prince. Capitulo. l.
IT pleases every good man that men pr^yse him in his goodness / and though he
be praised i^^ makes no matter to them y^ be wise men / what soever on y man
say / like as I have said before / for it causeth^ man to delight himself y^
moore in goodness / for ly^t as the wise men which ben euryous of their heel
will have the counsel of physycyans though so be y^ they feel no grefe of no
malady / but yet to y^ entente y^ they may live in welfare and health / like
them to have a regemen for preserving of y^ same^^hen by this ensample we will
comfort y^ true people of France for to parseuer in y^ good and faithful
love y^ they have customably at all times to their right noble and worthy and
above all other most redoubted princes / and to y^ entente y^ they shol de
understand and know y^ in so doing to their princes, they do as virtuous and
good people / shall be showed here a declaracy on of holy scypture and other
ensamples in like wise according to y^ same. For it is to know y^ holy
scripture in diverse places shows y^ the subjects should meke themself and
be ready to obey their princes and soueraynes / and saint Poule speaks of y^
same in a pystle y^ he sent to ye Romans in y^. xiii. chapter where he
says y^ every creature living ought to be subject to y^ mighty soueraynes /
for y^ puyssau^ce y^ princes have / they have it by y^ ordinance of
god^wherfore who y^ resysteth against their power he stombleth or mysguydeth
himself against y^ o^ dynau^ce of god. and yet saint Poule in y^ pystle ad
titum in y^ third chapter amonyssheth and connsayleth y^ common people to be
subject to their princes and to the great and mighty men / And to this same
sentence accords saint Peter in his first pystle^ in y^ second chapter
which says / be ye subjects to your lords in all ferefull dread* ^ut to y^
entente y^ no man should excu se himself in saying y^ this should not be
done but to such princes as ben good* Saint Peter declares plainly saying in
this wise / let us suppose says he y^ the princes ben evil unto you and
cruel / yet yield you subjects to him for y^ love of god / and specially to
the king as y^ most excellent / and to the dukes as people sent by god / for
y^ vengeance of evil doers / and to y^ laud of them y^ be good and do good
deeds / and for because y^ some people might murmr of the trewages and tails
which they ought pay to princes / it is to understood y^ it is a thing ordey
ned and accepted of god / and of this saint Peter gives ensample ^ holy
scripture and shows how y^ subjects ought not refuse to pay y^ is ordained
by y^ princes / and of this same speaks saint Mathewe in y^ euangyle in y^.
xxi^. chapter / how y^ pharysees made ask of our lord wheder they ought to
pay their imposy cyon to ^ezar y^ emperor or nay. Our lord answered them
again and said / yield to ^ezar y^ is his / and to god y^ longs to hy^ ^o
this is to understand y^ good is dew to princes. The same saint Mathewe says
in his euangyle / in y^. xvii. chapter to the same purpose how our lord sent
saint Peter to the set / and said unto him y^ in y^ mouth of y^ first fysshe
y^ he took he should look within and he should find a piece of money / and that
he shol ^e take y^ same piece to them y^ gadred the trewage of y^ Emperor in
payment for the^ both / and thus our lord himself gave ensample to all manner
of subjects both in deed and in word to do reverence and obeysaunce to their
lords and princes. And yet to y^ purpose of y^ true people of France to their
prince / for which goodness and merit I trust y^ our lord has saved them
from many perils / and in like wise every subject ought to do y^ same wise
to their princes / and who y^ does y^ contrary hurt and trouble shall fall
unto him. And yet we will bring to mind Ualere and other auctours to our
purpose. For this valere say th in the. vi. book / in y^. vi^i. chapter of y^
loyalte and faith y^ one the which was called Papynyon / had to his lord /
he vndersto de y^ his lord was espied of certain folks y^ hated him to y^
death / and that he might not escape in no wise and he were take / and for
because y^ he would save his lord from y^ danger he took his lords gow^e and
gave him his / and took him his ring and he took his / and secretly y^ lord
went out of the palace / and his man abode still for him / and when his
enemies came upon him he suffered himself to be slain for his lords sake /
and saving of his life wherefore ^alere says though so be that this narracyon
be but little and short yet at long going it is no little matter / and for
to touch of the euylles that comes to the people namely of ^^bellynge against
their prince to y^ entente y^ a man may find matter to keep himself therfro.
^rogus Ponpeyns tells in his. xviii. book how y^ people of a cite in Greece
rebelled against their lord in so much y^ they would have slain him / and for
the withal they slew his wife and his children / and all that were of his
lygnage / yet as it appears always y^ among y^ people there be some of les^e
evil than other. ^here was one o^ y^ Cytezyns y^ was named Traton / which
when he found his lord chased a way and driven in to hydeles for the fere
that he had / yet would not he slay him / but had great pity on him and thought
y^ he would save him from y^ death and hyde him in a place where he might he
saved / and the people went y^ he had be fled. So when they had made an end
of this myschyefe they thought too chose a ^ynge among themself. But for
because y^ they were in dyuy ^yon among the^ which should be their king /
they ordained y^ one on y^ morrow before y^ sone rysynge al y^ people should
ass^ ble in a field and which of them could se y^ sone shine first should b^
their king. This Traton which had saved the king from death came to him in y^
night and asked him counsel by what mean he might se y^ sone first in y^
morning / to that en tente y^ he might be king / his lord which thought to
quyee him the goodness that he had done unto him for saving of his life /
counsayled him / that when all other men looked in ^^^ the ^est / that he
should look toward the weste / and upon the ^y^^. So it happened when all
the people were assembled on the morrow / and looked ententyfely toward the
rysynge of ^^^ son / This Traton which looked even contrary saw the son
beemes / the which smote against the top of an high tower ^^forth withal he
showed it to y^ other pleople which cou de not se y^ sone that way as they
looked. ^hen every man was abashed and asked him who had given him y^ counsel
/ and he told the^ all together / and how he had saved his lord. ^o it hap
pened long after in the time y^ great ^lysaundre reigned / y^ he herd men
speak of the great treason y^ these people had done to their lords / ^he
thought to avenge y^ unthrifty deed / and went to assail y^ cite and took it
by force* ^ did upon them a great p^^ nycyon / and for because yt the king y^
reigned over them before was deed / he co^fermed this (...)aton to be king in
y^ same roy alme / and ordained y^ his children should reygne after him for y^
goodness y^ he had done to his lord.

Here we begin to speak of the three estates of the people / an^ first of the
clerks and studyentes in scyences. Capitulo. li.
ANd to the co^monte of the people be comprysed three estates / y^ is to know
in y^ ^yte of Parysel^ also in other cytees* First the clargy / y^ ^ourgeyses /
and the merchants / and then y^ comynyon of y^ people / like as we may say
men of craft and laborers* Now we must advise what things we may say y^
ben profitable i gyuynge ensample to euerychone of these estates to live well
and truly after his order / ^for because y^ y^ state of y^ clargy is among
all other / hyghenoble and worthy in honor. I cast to adresse my matter / and
speak first of them y^ is to say of y^ studyentes as in the university of
Paryse / or in other parties. People well counsayled / or people y^ ^e ^ron^ I
say to you y^ dyscyples of study and of wisdom / which by y^ grace of god
and of good fortune / or of good nature / ben applied to search out the hyghnes
of the clear re^oysynge sterre / y^ is to know y^ sterre of science taking
dylygently y^ good treaso^^ of y^ clear and helthfull fountain / fulfill
yourselfe of y^ plesaunt ^^f^^^yon y^ may so m^^he avail you and bring you to
worst y^ for what thing is more worthy to man tha science and the highness of
co^nynge. Certainly thou y^ desyrest it and employest thy self thereto has
chosen a glorious life* For by y^ thou may co^ prehende y^ ele^cyon of virtue
/ and y^ e^chewynge of vice / like as it styreth the to y^ ene / and defends
y^ fro the other / for th^re is no thing more parfyte than y^ truth and
cl^renes*for to vndersta^ de and know y^ par^ytenes o^ things which can not
be understand without conning and science* For a wise man would ta ke pain
to get y^ leest sauoure of y^ re^ykes of wisdom / and certainly I dare well
say what so ever any man says / y^ there is ^oy ne treasoure semblable / to y^
treasoure of understanding wherefore ye champyons of sapyence if ye will do any
labor or pain I counsel you y^ ye labor to get science / for and ye ha
ue it and use it well / ye be noble*ye ^e rich / ye be al parfyte / and this is
plainly showed in y^ doctrine o^ phylosophres which show eth and techeth y^
way to come by wisdom to y^ treasoure of pure and parfyte suffycyan^ce*
^^pruoent phylosophre y^ was called ^lea^tes had such a desire to taste of y^
great goodness of sapy^nce and loved it so well / notwithstondynge y^ he was so
poor y^ he could not find y^ means to come thereto but by great labor y^ he
had in y^ night / and y^ was this / he drew water al y^ night which was
necessary to y^ vle of y^ skolers / and so by y^ mean^ he gate his living /
and in y^ day he intended to ^is ^^udy and to y ^essons of ^rysypus / which
was a sol^mpne phylosophre to y^ enten^e y^ he might be fulfilled of y^
conning of this wise man and by y^ techynge and long contynuaunce became
^yght a sovereign man / wherefore me seems truly y^ this man was worthy to
have great laud as well for y^ constaunce of his labor as for y^ great
science y^ he gate / wherefore ^ence says in a py stle y^ ^^^a^tes by his great
labor help himself to come to y perfe^cyon of science* ^et to y^ purpose to
love science and to he dylygent to learn it for y^ great goodness y^ may fall to
him y^ list to labor therefore / we will speak a little of other phylosophres
for to sharpen y^ appetyte of them y^ study for to learn. The phylosophre
Platon loved so much science y^ thrughe y^ dylygence y^ he made for to get
it*he filled himself with wisdom and doc tryne. This Platon was master to
Arystotle and was in y^ time of Socrates y^ phylosophre / and he profyted so
gretely in doctrine y^ for the noblesse of his wit was counted y^ wysest man
living / and that he loved science he showed it well / for he went al about
to search out all y^ doctrine of books namely in ytaly wherefore valere speaks
of his great dylyge^ce and desire y^ he had to know and vnderstonde*y^ the
great thought y^ he took for to ge ^^ books together was for nothing else but
y^ science and co^nyn ge might be cast a broad by him thrughe all y^ world.
This so ^empne phylosophre dyed in y^ age of. lxxx. and. v^ii. years / and it
happened well at his death y^ great love y^ he had to all manner of ^^ kes / for
they fon^de lyenge by him y^ books of a woman y^ was a poet which was named
^^pho / and wrote of love in pleasau^ re and goodly verses*as ^rose says /
and paraduenture he looked upon them for taking of his pleasure in his plesaunt
sayenges. ^ And yet there is contained in y^ book of ^alere of y^ phy losophre
Democratus which was a famous man in natural philosophy / and as Arystotle
tells in y^ first book of generacyo^ ^ of corrupcyon and charge of al
things / y^ is to say he would give co^mendacyo^ to y^ saying of Democratus /
and therefore Ary stotle commends him greatly in diverse places for his natural
philosophy and allowed greatly his opynyons. Also valere common death much the
said phylosophre for because he dyspraysed ry ches gretely which often times
has done many men much hurt and lettynge in getyng of philosophy / and says
y^ this demo cratus might have greatly habou^ded in riches if he had would for
his fader was so passyngly rich y^ he f^d al y^ host of kyn ge zerces / yet
notwtsto^dynge al y^ riches he drwe him to study and when y^ goods fell to him
he dystrybued the^ to his friends and to y^ poor people and uneaths left
himself any thing to live upon Secondly valere commends him in as much as
he never desired worldely honors which empessheth gretely to co^quere
sapyence / and as he dwelled long in Athenes he employed all his time in
excersyse of doctrine and lived there long time vnkno wen in y^ said cite like
as himself witnesses in one of his vo lumes *for he chase to live soletarily
for to be out of noise and stry ^e which lets greatly speculacyo^ / then it
appeared y^ he had gre te desire of co^nynge for he eschewed to his power al
manner the ges y^ might let him fro y^ getynge of science. yet to y^ same
purpose y^ men should love science and study* valere speaks of y^ phylosophre
^arneades saying y^ he was y^ very knight y^ la boured scye^ce / for. lxxx.
years he lived in philosophy / and he was meruaylously co^ioyned to y^ works
of doctrine y^ it seemed of* ten times as he sat at mete y^ he took his
refeccyo^ in studyen ge of doctrine / so y^ Meleysa his servant was feign
often times to take hy^ by y^ ho^de and put it to his mete s^ynge y^ great stu
die y^ he was i / this said phylosophre set by no thing in y^ worl de but only
by virtue. Of many other phylosopres and shewe^s of wisdom a man might speak
of / but for shortyng of this mat ter I will pass over / and these matters here
tofore I have brought to mind to y^ entente y^ I may reduce and bring to
knowledge o^ y^ good studye^tes such as desire to learn scye^ce and virtue /
for it is no doubt but y^ scyences make a man to be gracyous and well governed
but if it be such one as is indiscreet and weneth hy^ self y^ he knows al
scyences / but in themself they show it not but teache it to other / and such
manner of me^ as techeth sapyence and ^o nothing themself of y^ same / ^en
lykened to such as dye for ho^ger and their good lyenge by the^ / and other
men help themself with y^ good / and such me^ be more blame worthy when they
do amysse than other.

yet of the same.
^Or because y^ this fair matter is right couenable to be known / and also y^
every man has not y^ book of valere for togader out to their pleasaunce al y^
matters y^ he speaks of^^e lyketh me yet to speak of y^ good purpose y^
longs to study / for because y^ I have said here tofore y^ y^ studyentes
ought to do great d^l py^ce in y^ getynge of scye^ce / as valere recyteth and
she ^^ eth how y^ dylyge^ce well modred without to great exce^le shall bryn ge a
man in great excersyse of co^nynge and alsygneth y^ cause why he says so.
Scenola which was an excellent legystre at Rome ^o^posed certain laws which
other legystres uses yet / and after his great occupacyo^ and study would take
recreacyo^ of diverse plays / and y^ a man should so do / valere theweth y^ it
is reason a says y^ y^ nature of things will not suffer a ma co^tynuelly to be
in labor / y^ is to say he must needs at sometime have re^t in ydlenes / but
this ydlenes should not be y^ a man should scase fro al bodily labors / but it
is to understood y^ a man should be occupied in some Joyful dysporte by y^
which his understanding may be y^ fressher / for by long studyenge al y^
sensytyfe virtues of man ^e made weary and dull / and also they be not brought
again to their rest and tra^quylyte by ceasing all manner works / for they y^
be trauayled in study if they be not occupied with some gladness they should be
full of malancoly for y^ spyryte whi che has been in so great labors of study
before / and if they go to bed so they shall suffer pain in their sleep as in
dremynge and otherwise / and therefore y^ remedy of y^ travail is / for to
rejoice his spyryte with some goodly play and dysporte / and in like wise as y^
pleasant metes please more at some time when they be entr^ meddled with groce
metes^ like wise y^ work of study is y^ better nourysshed wha^ a man at some
time applied him self to play and ^ysporto / and therefore ^ato^ says /
entremedle thy works amo^ ge with dysportrd / also Arystotle says in y^. iii.
book of Ethyques A man in his labor should use virtuously as welplay as la
bour / to which thing s^ne^ accords ^ his b^ke of tra^qu^^^^ of courage^^
says y^ the lusty and well berynge feldes be soon hurt by co^tynuel
fertylyte / without they be otherwhyle refressh ed / likewise co^tynuel labor ^
any seyence hurts ye courage of any person and engenders frenesy / and
therefore nature gives men inclynaeyon of dysporte and play otherwhyles / and
for y^ cause also they yt stablysshed ye laws in old time ordained certain
feestes to y^ entente y^ all manner of people should assemble for to dysporte
and play and leave their labor / and this purpose is said of Socrates /
which no part of scye^ce was hyd fro / yt he was not ashamed when he was
mocked of ^chypyades for because y^ he found him playenge with little children /
but he did so for because yt the recreacyo^ which he had among the^ should
shar pe and refresshe his wit and make it more quycke to ye study / and for
that cause as old as he was he learned to play on the harp.

Of the second estate of the people that is to know of bour geyses and of
merchants. Capitulo. lii.
I Have said here before yt the second estate of y^ people be y^ bourgeyses
and the merchants of cytees. The bourgeyses ben they y^ be of ye ancient
kynredes in cytees / and they have a propre sure name and ancient arms / ^
they be y^ pryncy pall dwellers and inhabytauntes in y^ cytees and towns and
of e^ he cytaunce in how sing / in manners and possessions / where upon they
live honestly and worshypfully / and as y^ books makes mencyon yt speaks to
the^ calls them cytezyns / and such manner of people ought to be honorable /
wise / and of fair port clothed in honest array without dysguysynge / or
nycete^^ it longs to them to be good and true / and also of great faith and
dyscrete language / and y^ state of cytezyns is right fair and honorable for
in some pla ces they ben called ye ancient lygnages wha^ they have kept of
longetyme their estate worshypfully / ^herfore in all places every man ought to
praise and commend the good bourgeyses and Cytezyns of every town and cite /
and yet it is a fair thing and a worshypfull when there is a notable bourgeys
in a cite and great worship to ye country and great richesse to ye prince.
These people should entremete of the governance of Cytees and to se what
longs to the merchants and to ye common people so that every thing might be
well ruled and governed to their profit / and for because that ye propre
people have not commonly great prudence in word / ne also in deed / that
touches polycye / which they ought not to meddle as of such things yt ben
establysshed by the princes. The burgeyses therefore ought to take good head yt
for any thing yt is made / the poor people be not hurt / nor yt they have
cause to make any evil conspyracyon ayenste their prince or his counsel /
and this is ye cause why / for such conspyracyons and ymagynacyons of common /
it tourneth all day to the preiudyce of them yt have good for to leese. For it
was never other nor never shall be / but ye end thereof shall be evil and full
of preiudyce / wherefore they ought and any such case fall at any time yt the
commons feel themself grieved by any great charge. The wise burgeyses should
assemble themself together such as be wise and dyscrete both in word and
deed / and go to ye princes or to ye counsel and there make their
supplycacyon with all humylyte and show their matter debonayrely to ye entente
that the common people be not hurt / For it is the dystruccyon of Cytees / of
towns / and lands and therefore they should appeal ye murmuracyons of ye
people as ferforthe as they might for ye great hurtes and myscheues yt may
fall thereof by many means. For they that been great stand most in danger /
and thought so be yt at some time they seem ye ordynaunces of ye prince and of
his counsel be not duly made in some things / yet the wise men ought not to
construe it to ye worste entente / but think yt they do it of good entente yt
they have done. For the causes be not apparent to every man / and also there
may be peril in murmuring of the people. Ualere says yt the word of
Socrates yt worshypfull phylosophre were right noble and good when he said it
was a great wisdom for a man to hold his peace / For on a time he was in a
place where were many men that spoke of the ordinance of princes and spoke
shreoodely thereof / so one of these evil spekers came to Socrates and asked
him why he spoke no word and all other men said their advise: he answered
them again and said. I hold my peace quod he for because that I have spoken
such words at some time that I have repented after / but I was never shente
for holding my peace.

Therefore it is right a good thing for a man to hold his peace and speak no
such words as harm may come of and no profit and by yt a man may know a
wise man / and therefore Caton says ye first virtue is to keep well his tongue
for he is nyghe to god yt in way of reason can hold his tongue. And Sense
says in the first book of ye last proose / who that will be one of the
dyscyples of Pyctogoras must keep his tongue. v. year. For he said unto them
that they must first learn a thing or they spoke it and whether it were
necessary to be spoken or not.

How the wise burgeyses should counsel the simple people in that they should
do. Capitulo. liii.
ANd as it is said before ye wise men should teache ye simple and ygnorannt
people to hold their peace and speak not of such things yt longs not to
the^ to speak of / for there may great peril fall thereof and no profit / and
this is wytnessed i^ ye book of ^^odi in ye.xii. chapitre saying yt ye law
defends such murmuracyo^ and byddeth yt no man should murmr against ye
great lords / and they should not curse ye princes of ye people / and Salomo^
confermeth the same in the book called Ecclesiastes in the.x. chapter and
says betray not the king in thy truth / yt is to say ye subject should
make no co^spyracyon against his lord And also that is great peril to murmr
or to withstonde the ordinance of princes / Just yne says in the. xii. book
of Alysaundre for the great vyctoryes y^ he had when he had won the lordeshyp
of Perce he thought than that he would be worshypped after y^ manner of the
country which was a manner of worshyppynge / as we might say a man to kncle
down on his knees when he spoke to his sovereign which was not customed i
Macedone ne mother regyo^s at y^ time / but for because y^ men murmured and
also that castylenes y^ phylosophre which Arystotle had committed to
Alysaundre for as much as he might no longer endure the labor that he had
for to follow him about repreued Alysaudre right egrely for the same / for
which thing Alysaundre made him to be slain / It is to know Ualere says
when Arystotle left Alysaundre he set to way to upon him in his stead this
noble Phylosophre Castylenes whche was his dyscyple and was right a wise man /
nevertheless Arystotle taught this said Castylenes that he should never speak
of vices of princes behind their back / for he told him it should not be
done for two things / One is that it longs not to a subject to say shame
of his lord / The other is that as soon as the words ben passed out of his
mouth y^ flatterers ben ready anon to report them unto the sovereign* And yet
he warned him that he should speak but little to Aly saundre and yet before or
he spoke / he should understand that he were some what merry / too that entente
that his language should not turn him to no peril / nor also he should not
flatter him / but the words that he said might be acceptable. / But this
dyscyple held not well the doctrine of his master / wherefore he repented it
afterward. yet to the same purpose that a man should not strive against the
ordinance of y^ prince And to the purpose also of the phylosophre that
Alysaundre let slay for because that he again said his ordinance. Ualere
says and tells of the Phylosophre of Mades / what he said to them of
Athenes. For when Alysaundre would be worshypped as it is said here tofore / he
sent unto them of Athenes and said that he would in any wise be so worshypped
/ Than the Athenyences which were accustomed more than other people to keep
sermounes and right wise ordynaunces assembled their counsel to know what
they might best do therein* So the common oppynyon of them was that they ^olde
not do him that worship which longed not but only to gods / Then this wife
phylosophre of Mades / the which knew well enough what might fall for the
dyshobe ysaunce of princes / said un to them / now syrs quod he keep you well
that ye meddle not so^ far with the heaviness that ye shall loose the earth*
These things said here tofore may turn too ensamples in some lands / but
thanked be god we have no cruel princes in Frau^ ce / nor hateful against
their people* For of all y^ nacyons in the world I dare well say without any
flattering* and true it is / that there be none so natural ne so benygne as
they ben in France / wherefore they ought more lowely to be obeyed / and
though at some time peradventure the people seem that they be sorer charged
than other Royalmes and Lands / and that other lands ben less grieved than
France. And let us suppose that it may be so by reason in some things as
by means of their fraunchyse / yet by other customs and seruages / which be
more preiudycyable as great crueltees that been done unto them / or else that
they slay and murdre each other for lack of Justice and many other strange
means which we re to long for to tell / and what so ever any man say /
saving the grace of them that would withsaye this / for any thing that men
complain on in France / I hold oppynyon that of all the lands in
crystendome it is it where best is to dwell in / as well for the beginning of
princes without cruelte / as for the courteysy / ano the louyngnesse of the
people of the same na cyon. And yet I say not thus for because that I was
borne therein. But as god help me at the day of dome I says as I think / For
I have enquered much of the governance of other lands. And also I wot well
this earth is not Paradyse For I will that every man know / that in all
royalmes ben trybulacyons ynowe. And of these cruel princes in times paste I
will speak of. And namely of the newest / for I may ^ynde ynowe. But for
because that I may not turn too no good ensample I will the more lightly
pass over / But for as much as we have treated of the great charges of people
done by lords. There was a meruaylous and a false and untrue cautell found
by Denis the tyraunte / for to have good of his people. For as this Denis
tyraunte was dyscomfyted in a battle went and aduysed him by great malice and
sleyght how he might recover again that he had lost and spended he made
cryea noise over all among his people / and made the^ to believe that ye cause
of his dyscomfyture was for his sin / where as he had made avowe to Uenus
for to have sought her and was not fulfilled. And this was his avowe if so were
that ^he would help him in a battle for to have the vyctory of his enemies
that the day of lempnyte of her feast all the ladies and vyrgynes of the land
to honor and worship of y^ same gods should that day do al y^ pleasure
that any man would require them* And for because that he had not accomplysshed
his avowe after the vyctory of the battle that he had won* Therefore the
goddess Uenus for the frawde and untruth that he had done unto her in
brekynge of his avowe was against him at the last battle / which caused him
to be dyscomfyted and overcome. And to accomplysshe and satysfy He gods of
his avowe. He made ordeyne that all the ladies and maidens at the day of
solempnyte of her feast should array themself in the most rychest garments
that they might ge te with all the Iewelles that they had. And who that had
no Iewelles of their own they should borowe. And when they were thus arrayed
they should goostreyght to the temple. And from thens they should be brought
unto a common place. But every man should be made swear before / that they shol
de not touch none of all the women in the way of vylanye. And for because of
this oath the folysshe mysbyleuynge peo ple without law of the land byleued
certaynely that all was true that the king had showed them / wherefore every
man consented that their wives and their daughters should be brought to that
place / for they went that the goddess Uenus would have been peased and this
thing had been thus done with out empeyrynge the chastyte of their wives and
their dough ters / where upon this was ordained / like as is reherced here
tofore. And so all the ladies went in the best arayment that they might get
to the temple. But Denis their king thou ghte another manner thing / which
dyssembled and tayned this thing to be done / for as much as he durst set
no subs^dy upon them / he thought for to get good by another mean* wherefore
he let ordain a certain people for to go to the tem ple and let dyspoyle
all ye ladies and other women of all their richesse* And they that were old
matrones and rich compelle them by betynge and other duresse for to tell where
their rychesses were and the treasours of their husbondes. Of this Denis that
was king of ^esyle men may well say y^ he was an evil prince. But for because
y^ no man should have envy to follow their deeds / it is to be known like as
it falls com monly y^ the evil life draws a man to evil end. For y^ end
of him was right naught / for after y^ he had done this cursed deed with other
moo / he was slain vylaynously of his own people / his son which succeeded
after him / whose name also was called Denyse / was in his last end right
unhappy / for he was deposed of his lordeshyppe / and after that he went too
^orynthe / and there he was feign to teache children for his living. Thus the
child suffered pain for the trespass of his fader / and other while it
happens so* for holy scripture say th / the faders eteth the bitter grape /
and the children have ye forenesse in the tethe / And in like wise it is written
in other pla ces / our faders sinned and we should suffer their inyquytees yet
to the purpose of evil princes / which I pray god save us fro. There was a
king in Egypt that was called Tholomeus Pheton. And among all other vices he
was Lecherous and full of delycasye. And Ualere says he was called Pheton /
for as much as an exposytoure says that Pheton is as much to say / as
encreasynge and augmentacyon of vice. For by his Lechery he put upon men
diverse crimes / and made them have an evil end / for which cause he dyed a
vylaynous death* and after his death in great defame of his good name.

Here it speaks of merchants. Capitulo. liiii.
OF such people as we have spoken of here tofore / that been named merchants
/ which state of people is right necessary / and without that same / the state
of kings and princes / and namely the polycye of cytees / and of countrees
might not be without ^^ / for by the means of their wisdom and labor all
manner of people ben puruayed of such things / as is to them necessary /
which is brought in by the marchau^ tes out of far countries if they have
money* wherefore it was a well found thing for to find among worldely
things, such an inuencyon that people might be labored and put to diverse
offices / For and this were not / every man should have enough to do for to
get his living without taking he de of any other science / wherefore god and
reason has well pur uayed* And for the good that they do to every man / that
ma ner state of people / that is to know ^ true merchants in by enge and
selling for money / or other manner of true means as by entrechaungynge one
thing for another / ought gretely for to be commended as for a thing that is
right necessary and in many countrees they be much set by* And there is not
so great a Cytezyne in some Cite but they meddle them with marchaundyse / yet
ben they never the less set by / nor called the more vnworshypfull. Like as
at Uenyse / Ieene / and othed places where much rychesses is / and mighty
merchants which gothe thrughe every lord too seche things of every sort
which they dysperpule all about the world / and thus is the world served of
al manner of diverse things. And with out any fail they that practyse trewely
in doing these works / I suppose that they do right a merytoryous office and
is accept of god and of the laws premysse and approved / The se manner of
people ought too be well aduysed in their deeds true in their labor / and
faithful in their mouth / too that entente that they may by their
marchaundyse at such payce that they loose not in selling again of the same
/ And that they understand well also that there ben plente of such stuff as
they will bye in the country where he gothe to. And on the other side that
there be no plente in that country that he will vttre his marchaundyse in* And
without this y^ feate of their practyse shall be as naught / and fail of their
purpose / Also they ought too be true in their labor / that is too say /
they ought not under the pain of dampnacyon / and shameful ^^^ nyssyon of
their body make fayrer their marchau^dyse by any manner of sleyght for to make
them show better than they be / in deceyuynge of the people to that entente
that they might be y^ rather sold / for every craft is gretely reproved where
frau de is in / and they that use such falshede ought not to be called
merchants / but very false and begylers of the people for the merchants
ought to be true of their word / and souerayn ly of their promyses / wherefore
in some countrees and places / they be so acustome to hold and keep truth
that a simple pro myse or a word of a merchant shall be trusted as much and
taken for as great a Suretye / as in other places men's oblygacyon / and these
people rather than they should be found un true of their promyses / had lever
suffer great hurt than fay ^^ony thing of their couenauntes the which thing
is fair and good and a worshypfull custom. And if it pleased god I would that
our merchants of France and in all other lands would do in like wise / and
though so be that there be some which do not all well / yet I tryst to god
there be many that be good and true / rich / honorable / and faythefull in
their ^^^yse / and such I pray almighty god save and mayntey ne in their
goodness For it is a great goodness to a country and great richesse to a prince /
and namely to the common welthe when ^^ town is substancyally grounded in
marchaundyse and ma ny merchants dwelling therein. ^herfore these Cytees yt
ben set upon the great ryuers be commonly rich and full of peo ple / for
because of the great marchaundyses y^ be brought thither out of far countrees
by the sea. Also these said marchau^ tes ought to be of honest and clean life
without any pomp or p^y de and serve god encourage and dread / and to give
fair alms of the goods y^ god has sent them / like as men may find of ma
ny diverse that have given the. x. part of their winning / and some y^ have
founded many chapelles / and diverse places of prayer / and hospytalles for
poor people. And yet there be such y^ by the grace of god for their good
merytes deserve to be rewar ded in heaven / and worshypped in this world.

Of the third estate of the people. Capitulo. lv.
HEre follows the third estate of y^ people which ben the men of craft and
the laborers of the earth that we take for the last party of the body of
polycye which is lykened to y^ legs / and the feet / and of the feet
Pulcarque speaks yet and that they should be so soueraynely taken head too
and, keep them so well that they be not hurt in no manner of wise. ^ For the
hurt of them may hurt the body right peryllously wherefore the body has
the more need too take heed thereto for hurtynge of himself / for they sease
not to labor by the earth that is to understand for the diverse labors y^
men of ^^a^te uses and do which ben necessary to the body of man / and may
in no wise be without them / like as man's body may not pass but that he
should go lewdely and he had lost his fete but treynynge on his hondes with
^^^^e pain and on his body also. In like wise he says it is of the common
things / for put away the laborers and them that use the crafts and it may
not be sustained but all shall fall. For the office of men of craft which
clerks calls artyfycers that some men settel ytell by / yet it is a fair
thing and a good / and right necessary / as it is said before. And among all
other things that been i^ ought most to be allowed for because that among al
world ly things it is the thing that appocheth next y^ scyences / for they
put in ure y^ the scyences have showed before as Arystotle says in his
Methaphysyke / for he tells y^ their works ben the effect of scyences /
like as geometry which is the science of measures and of proporcyons without
which no craft may pass / and so of other: And thus witnesses an
exposytoure whi che says that they of Athenes would have made a meruayllous
auctoure too the goddess of ^apyence / that was called ^ynerue. and for
because they would make it notably and of curyous entayle they took counsel
of the most excellent masters / so they went to Platon as for the most
soueray ne Phylosophre at that time in all scyences. ^ut he sent them again
to one that was called ^^clydes as for the most soue ^ayne master in the
craft of measures. For he composed geo metry / the which is read every day
in the general studyes and by this a man may know that the crafts follows
scyences ^^r masouns ^arpenters / and all other of what craft that ever they
be of works after the techynge of science and to the worship of art / It
is to know Ualere says that are te will follow nature as when a werkeman
country fayteth proprely a thing that nature has made Like as a paynter that
shall be so conning a man in his craft that he will ma ke a figure so like
a man that every man may know the man by y^ same figure. ^^so they will make a
bird or another be y^ every man may well know it is like unto another. In
like wise a Caruer of images will do the same / and thus of all other crafts.
And therefore some say that art is lykened to an Ape in nature. For like as an
Ape counterfayteth many diverse manners of man / so art follows great plentye
of the works of nature. ^euerthelesse he says after ward that are te may not
follow nature in all things. ^lso we should praise every subtle man in his
craft and believe him for because of the great experyence that he has in y^
same. For it is no doub te that there is no man so properly may speak of a
thing as he that knows it. And among these men of craft / there ben many
subtyltees learned and more commonly among them than among other people /
which is right notable and fair* But for to speak now of their maneres and
condycyons I would and it pleased god that their manner of living might be
such as god would be pleased with. For our lord would that their ly^e should
be commonly sobre / and not more delycate than longs ^n to them which may
cause them to leave their labor* For the lechery of taruernes and the
pleasaunces that been v^^d at Paris may bring them to many inconuenyentes and
my^cheues. And of the voluptuous life of such people and other ly ke to them
Arystotle speaks and says that much people sen^e to be as beestes for
because they chose lechery before al other o^ lytes / and of this false opinion
speaks holy scripture in the ^e conde chapter of the book of Sapyence / and
says that the ry me of our life is short and full of great ^nuye and in the
end we have no rest / wherefore these foul glottons in Lechery say we will
use our young life in following of our lusts / and we will till our belyes
with wives and metes / and we will show over all the traces of our gladness /
and without fail such folysshe and vain words men may often times here not
one ly of the simple people / but as well of other people that for because of
their estate be holden for wise men: Therefore the common people for because that
they be not for the most party learned in holy scripture / they should follow
the predycacyons and the words of god showed by worthy doctors and noble
^latkes / which ben profitable to all christian people. Al^o Iusty ne recyteth
in the. xx. book de ^rogue Pompee / that in the Cy te of ^raton wherein were
paynymes and myscreauntes Pie togoras the Phylosophye which was a paynyme
withdrewe them from their evil living by his exhortacyons. For wh^^^ as the
people were vycyously dysposed to ^lotony / to vices / and to Lechery / by y^
introduceyon of Pyetogoras they were brought again to contynence and to clean
living / This phyloso phre blamed gretely the vice of Lechery / and showed
how by that vice diverse Cytees were fellen in to ruin ^he taught y^ ^adyes
and other men tolyue chastely / and that they should be sobre in their metes
and drynkes. And the said Pyctogoras did so much by his wise amonycyons that
the ladies left their ^yce arayes. And the men to leave their glotonyes / for
as long as he was among them and that was the space of twenty year they
contynewed in good living by the good means of his techynge / and this good
deed Iu^tyne says of him. For in the town of Methapontus / which is in
Puyle / where as Pyctogoras was borne the people had him in so great
reverence that of the house where he dyed in* they made a temple and Worshypped
the said Pyctogoras as a god / so it were great need to have such a man now
a days in many places with that there were people that would work after his
counsel.

Of simple laborers. Capitulo. lvi.
Of the state of simple laborers of the Earth / and what shall I say of them
/ for because that many men dysprayse and greueth them soore / and yet ^e they
of the states before rehearsed most ne cessary and namely such as be tyllers
of the earth whereby every creature living is nourysshed up / and f^d^d^ /
and without the same this deedly world should fail in right short time / and
certainly they that do them so much harm take no head whereof they serve /
For who takes head thereto every reasonable creature is bound ^^ them / and
therfo re it is pity that any man should be unkind to them seyuge y^ notable
service that they do to every creature / and certainly these may will be called
the fe^^^ that sustain the body of Polycy for by their labor they sustain y^
body of every person / where fore such manner of people ought not too be
dyspraysed / and that this office is acceptable to god ^yrst it appears for
because y^ two of the first heedes of y^ world of whom al manner of lygna ges
ben ben dyscended they were laborers of the earth / and the first heed was
Adam the tyrst fader of whom is written in these conde chapter of ^^nesis /
how our lord took y^ first man and put him in paradyse of delytes for to
work and till and keep / and out of this scripture a man may draw two manner
of arguments for to preue the honest of labor. The first is for ^ycause our
lord ordained it himself and it was the first of all crafts. And the
second is this / for because it was made in y^ state of innocencye. The
second heed of the world was ^^e of whom after the deluge is dyscended all
the world / and of him is written in ^enesis in the. ix. chapter / that ^^e
which was a labourynge man after y^ great flodde took him to labou re the
earth and planted a vine / and in like wise of our other faders as auncyente
Patryarkes which were earth tyllers* and kepers of beestes / whereof at this
time ^^eue the stories* for because of shortenes of time / notwithstondynge in
old^ time it was no foul office but an office gretely praised / and ^^lo^us
tells in the story of the Romans how Dyocl^sya^ the ^mperoure of ^ome after
that he had gotten many vyctoryes and bataylles of his own propre will* He
went and (...) his life in a vyllage that was named Salon, and his occupa cyon
was only in labourynge of the ^rthe. And long ryme after as the lordeshyppe
of ^ome fell in great defaute for lack of good governance of so worthy a
man as he was. ^ They sent unto him Lentulyus and ^leryus / besechynge him
that he would return again unto ^ome and too take upon him the governance
of the Empire. ^o whom he answered and said. ^a quod he if ye had seen the
fair wortes that I have planted with my hand ye would not require me to
return again to the Empire And this is as much to say as that he was more
appeased in his conscience in that poor offy ce and better took hit a worth /
than for too have the charge of so great and so peryllous a thing as the
governance of the Empire. And to this purpose Ualere says in his four th
book / in the third chapter of Actylyus the right worship full and noble
Romayne that was taken from the labourage to be made Emperor / and as he
went at the ploughe in the ^elde / the knights found him and made him chief
conduysoure and rewler of all the Romayne host. And he which had his hondes
all hard for holding of the ploughe after that he left the governance of
the hoostes of ^ome establysshed by his noble courage and with his hondes the
common welthe whi^he was fallen in great myschyefe before his coming / wherefore
Ualere says / the hondes that governed the coupled oren at the ploughe*toke
upon them for to govern the ploughe of ba tails. And after y^ he had gote^
many great vyctoryes he was no^ ashamed to leave the dygnyte of the Emperor
and retour ne again to the same labor which he came from before. -- By this
saying may a man understand that the state of simple laborers or other of
simple estate ought not to be dyspraysed as some will say / when so
worshypfull men as they were would chose for their last rest so poor a life
and so simple estate^y for the most sure both for the body and soul / for
they have sure richesse that been wylfull poor / For they be not afer de of no
treasons / empryson ynges* nor robbynges / ne to be gre tely enuyed / and their
richesse is suffycyente* For there is no^ man rich without suffycyent / and
also there is none other ry chesse. And for the affyrmacyon of this thing I
may call to purpose that Ualere says of a rich man in suffycyaunce as is
declared in a story: There was a king he says in ^yde that was named ^yges /
he held hymselfes o mighty and so^ great that he went to the god Appolo / to
ask him wheder the re was any man more vrouse than he was / the god Appolo
answered him and said that Aganyus Sophydyus was more brouse than he* This
Aganyus was the poorest man of all Arthadye and was right an aged man / and yet
he passed never his little ^eclde / but he was content with little fruytes /
whereby he lived. Thus may a manse how Appolo took pouerte for suffycyaunce /
and not richesse / for as much also as in richesse may be no suffycyent rest
/ ne surete / but great hertes full of feere and trouble / And thus the king
Gyges which went that the god should have affermed y^ there was none so
vrouse as he was / happened to be deceived of his vain opy nyon and learned by
Appolo where was ferme richesse and bles sydnesse This felycyte that is as
much to say as suffyoy aunce. An asagoras / and also Tholomee proves in the
prologue of the almageste where he says / he is vrouse that car^th never in
whose hondes the world be / And too prove that this sentence is trewe*lyke as
all the wise men / the poets / and namely they that have chosen the clean and
pure life of perfecty o^ take pouerte for their great surete* For though so be
that in all states a man may^^e saved / yet it is an hard thing too pass
thrughe the flambes of fire without brennynge* For it is no doubt that in the
state of pouerte which every man dysprayseth ben many good and solemn
parsones in clenness^ of life.

Here Xp^ine cocludeth her book. Capitulo. lvii.
Now Iam come blessed be our lord to the end that I intended / that is to
say it has lyked our lord to give me power to make an end of this present
book which I began at the heed of the body after the writing of Pultarque
that is to know of the polycye which is understand by the princes to whom I
most humbly require / and first to the chief of all / the most noble king
of france / And afterward the princes and all other of his royal blood /
that the dylygent labor of wrytynges of their humble creature ^p^ine / as well
in this present deed as in her other deeds such as they be or may be / that
it might be to them agreeable. And if so happen that by ygnoraunce as a woman of
little knowledge make fau te in any of these things before reherced / that of
their grace she might be pardoned. And that the entente of her good will which
ente^^eth not but to all goodness and to ye end of her work may be pardoned.
And yet I may for a reward of them that been living and their noble
success^^res the king / and other princes of France that for remembrance of
my sayen ges in time to come when the soul is out of my body to have me in
mind in their devout prayers / and devout orylo^s / offered up by them. That
they will require of god for me to have ^^dulgence and remyss^on of my
defautes. And in like wy se I require knights and noble men and all other
generally of what part that ever they be of*that hereth or sees these little
wrytynges that they will have me in their memory. And for my reward that it
would like them to say a / ^ater nostc^ And in the same wise I desire of all y^
universal people / whi che three es^ates and all in one / our lord for his
holy mercy will maynteyne and encreace from better to better in all perfecyon of
soul and body.

Thus ends the book of the body of Polycye.
