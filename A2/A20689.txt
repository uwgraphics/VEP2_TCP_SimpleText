So made that all the parts together, or either of them severally may be song
to the Lute, Orpherian or Viol de gambo.

Composed by John Dowland Lutenist and Batcheler of music in both the
Universities.

Also an invention by the said Author for two to play upon one Lute.

COMME IE TRUE


TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR GEORGE CAREY, OF THE MOST HONORABLE ORDER OF THE
GARTER KNIGHT: Baron of Hunsdon, Captain of her Majesty's gentlemen
Pensioners, Governor of the Isle of Wight, Lieutenants of the county of
Southt. Lord Chamberlain of her Majesty's most Royal house, and of her
Highness most honorable privy Counsel.
THAT harmony (Right honorable) which is skilfullie expressed by Instruments,
albeit, by reason of the variety of number and proportion, of it self it
easily stirs up the minds of the hearers to admiration and delight, yet far
higher authority and power has been ever worthily attributed to that kind of
Music, which to the sweetness of instrument applies the lively voice of man,
expressing some worthy sentence or excellent Poem. Hence (as al antiquity can
witness) first grew the heavenly Art of music: for Linus, Orpheus, and the
rest, according to the number and time of their Poemes, first framed the
numbers and times of music: So that Plato defines melody to consist of
harmony, number, and words; harmony naked of it self, words the ornament of
harmony, number the common friend and uniter of them both. This small book
containing the consent of speaking harmony, joined with the most musical
instrument, the Lute, being my first labor, I have presumed to dedicate to
your Lordship, who for your virtue and nobility are best able to protect it,
and for your honorable favors toward me best deserving my duty and service.
Besides your noble inclination and love to all good Arts, and namely the
divine science of music does challenge the patronage of all learning, then
which no greater title can be added to Nobility. Neither in these your
honors may I let pass the dutiful remembrance of your virtuous Lady my
honorable mistress, whose singular graces toward me have added spirit to my
unfortunate labors. What time and diligence I have bestowed in the search of
Music, what travel in foreign countries, what success and estimation even
among strangers I have found, I leave to the report of others. Yet all this in
vain, were it not that your honorable hands have vouchsaft to uphold my poor
fortunes, which I now wholly recommend to your gracious protection, with these
my first endeavors, humbly beseeching you to accept, and cherish the^ with your
continued favors.

Your Lordships most humble servant, John Dowland.

To the courteous Reader.
HOW hard an enterprise it is in this skillful and curious age to commit our
private labors to the public view, mine own disabilitie, and others hard
success do too well assure me: and were it not for that love I bear to the
true lovers of music, I had concealde these my first fruits, which how they
will thrive with your taste I know not, howsoever the greater part of them
might have been ripe enough by their age. The Courtly judgment I hope will not
be severe against them, being it self a party, and those sweet springs of
humanity (I mean our two famous Universities) will entertain them for his sake,
whom they have already graced, and as it were enfranchisd in the ingenuous
profession of Music, which from my childhoode I have ever aimed at, sundry
times leaving my native country, the better to attain so excellent a science.
About sixteen years past, I traveled the chiefest parts of France, a nation
furnished with great variety of Music: But lately, being of a more confirmed
judgment, I bent my course toward the famous provinces of Germany, where I
found both excellent masters, and most honorable Patrons of Music: Namely,
those two miracles of this age for virtue and magnificence, Henry Iulio Duke of
Brunswick, and learned Maritius Lantzgraue of Hessen, of whose princely virtues
and favors toward me I can never speak sufficiently. Neither can I forget
the kindness of Alexandro Horologio, a right learned master of Music, servant
to the royal Prince the Lantzgraue of Hessen, and Gregorio Howet Lutenist to
the magnificent Duke of Brunswick, both whom I name as well for their love to
me, as also for their excellency in their faculties. Thus having spent some
months in Germany, to my great admiration of that worthy country, I past over
the Alps into Italy, where I found the Cities furnished with all good Arts
but especially Music. What favor and estimation I had in Venice, Padua,
Genoa, Ferrara, Florence, and diverse other places I willingly suppress, least
I should any way seem partial in mine own endeavors. Yet can I not dissemble
the great content I found in the proferd amity of the most famous Luca
Marenzio, whose sundry letters I received from Rome, and one of them, because
it is but short, I have thought good to set down, not thinking it any disgrace
to be proud of the judgment of so excellent a man.

Molto Magnifico Signior mio osseruandissimo.
PEr una lettera del Signior Alberigo Malueziho inteso quanto con cortese
affetto simostri desideroso di essermi congionto a'amicitia, dove infinitamente
la ringratio di questo suo buon' animo, offerendomegli all incontro se in
alcuna cosa la posso seruire, poi che gli meriti delle sue infinite uirtu, and
qualita meritano che ogni vno and me l'ammirino and osseruino, and per fine di
questo le bascio le mani. Di Roma a' 13. di Luglio. 1595.

D. V. S. Affettionatissimo seruitore, Luca Marenzio.

Not to stand to long upon my travels, I will only name that worthy master
Giouanni Crochio Vicemaster of the chapel of S. Marks in Venice, with whom I
had familiar conference. And thus what experience I could gather abroad, I am
now ready to practice at home, if I may but find encouragement in my first
assaies. There haubin diverse Lute lessons of mine lately printed without my
knowledge, falce and imperfect, but I purpose shortly my self to set forth the
choicest of all my Lessons in print, and also an introduction for fingering,
with other books of Songs, whereof this is the first: and as this finds favor
with you, so shall I be affected to labor in the rest. Farewell.

John Dowland.

The goulden morning wastes,
While the son from his sphere,
His fiery arrows casts:
Making all the shadows fly,
Playing, staying in the grove,
To entertain the stealth of love,
Thither sweet love let us hie,
Flying, dying, in desire,
Wingd with sweet hopes and heavenly fire.
Come away, come sweet love,
Do not in vain adorn,
Beauties grace that should rise,
Like to the naked morn:
Lillies on the rivers side,
And fair Cyprian flowers new blown,
Desire no beauties but their own,
Ornament is nurce of pride,
Pleasure, measure, loves delight,
Have then sweet love our wished flight.

To all save me is free to live or die,

Since Fortune still directs my hap a slope,
Wherefore to neither hap nor hope I trust,
But to my thralles I yield, for so I must.

Yet will she never rue,
Nor yield me any grace:
Her eyes of fire, her heart of flint is made,
Whom tears nor truth may once invade.

If doubt do darken things held dear,
