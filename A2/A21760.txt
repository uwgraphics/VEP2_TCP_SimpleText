By the Queen.
FOrasmuch as the Queens Majesty our sovereign Lady, is credibly informed,
that the infection of the plague is at this present in sundry places in and
about the City of London, and in other places near adjoining to the same,
whereby the continuance thereof, through the greater repair and resort of her
loving Subjects, great peril and danger might not only ensue unto her most
royal person, but also unto her most loving subjects, repairing thither for
their suites and causes, and thereby also give occasion of dispersing of the
same in other parts of the Realm: Her Majesty for the said necessary
considerations, and hoping that the same will by the goodness of Almighty God,
with the coolness of the year, and such wholesome orders as are taken in her
said City, the rather cease by the adiournement of part of this next term of
Saint Michael now at hand, from the vtas of the same, until after the feast of
all Saints next coming, of her special favor and clemency, is pleased and
contented, to adiourne the said term of saint Michael, that is to say, from
the vtas thereof, unto Crastino a^imarum, next coming. Which her Majesty
signifies to all and singular her loving subjects of this her Realm, to the
intent, that they, and every of them, which has cause of commandment to
appear in any of her highness courts at Westminster, in or at any day or
time, from, and after the said vtas of Saint Michael, may tarry at their
dwellings, or where their business otherwise shall lie, without resorting to
any of the said Courts for that cause, before Crastino animarum, next coming,
and that without danger of forfeiture, penalty, or contempt, to incur
toward her Highness in that behalf. And nevertheless her Majesty's pleasure
is, that two of her Justices, that is to say, of either bench one, shall the
first day of Michaelmas Term, called Octabis Michaelis, according to the
ancient order of her Laws, keep the essoines of the said Octabis Michaelis,
at which vtas of Saint Michael, writtes of adiournement shall be directed to the
said Justices, giving them authority to adiourne the said Term of Saint
Michael, that is to say, from the vtas thereof, until Crastino animarum, as
before is said: And the same adiournement shall be made in the first day of the
said vtas, commonly called the day of the essoines. And further her Majesty's
pleasure is, that all matters, causes and suites, depending in any of her other
Courts between party and party, as in her Highness Courts of Chauncerie,
Star chamber, and Exchequer, Courts of wards and liueries, and Duchy of
Lancaster, shall have coutinuance, and the parties shall have day from the date
of these presents unto Crastino animarum, as before is said.

Provided always, and her Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, that all
Collectors, Receivers, Sheriffs, and other accomptants, and all other persons
that ought or should account or pay any sum or sums of money in any of her
Majesty's court of Exchequer, courts of wards and liueries, or of her Duchy
of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter into any account in any of the
same courts, shall repair unto the accustomed places at Westminster, where her
Highness has appointed such officers and ministers, as for that purpose her
Majesty has thought expedient, and there to pay, and do in every behalf, as
though no such Proclamation of adiournement had been had or made: any thing
mentioned in this present proclamation, or in any writ of adiournement to the
contrary, notwithstanding. Willing and commanding all and every of her
Majesty's officers, ministers and subjects, to whom it does or shall
appertain, to observe and keep their assemblies and apparances, with all their
returns and certificats in her Highness said Courts at Westminster in Crastino
animarum next coming, then and there to be holden and kept, and there to do
their offices and duties in every behalf, in like manner and form as they
should or ought to have done, if this present Proclamation had not been had or
made, as they will answer to the contrary at their perils.

Given at her Majesty's Honor of Hampton Court the first day of October, in the
sixtenth year of her Majesty's Reign.
Imprinted at London by Newgate Market, next unto Christ's Church, by Richard
Judge, Printer to the Queens Majesty,
