A Proclamation declaring His Majesty's pleasure touching Orders to be observed
for prevention of dispersing the Plague.
THe Kings Majesty, finding that the infection of the Plague at this present
has begun to break forth in some places near unto the City of London, and
some other parts of the Kingdom, Out of His Princely and provident care of the
common good and safety of His Dominions and people, by a timely use of good
means (accompanied with the blessing of Almighty God) to prevent the
increasing and dispersing thereof, Has thought fit, with the advice of His
Privy Council, to declare His Royal Pleasure therein: And whereas in the
time of the last Plague, there were diverse good Orders thought meet by His
Majesty and His Privy Council to be published with sundry good Rules,
Preservatives, and Directions against the Infection, His Majesty is pleased
that the same Orders, Rules, and Medicines shall be again now publised and
renewed, together with some additions.

And does therefore require and command all Justices of the Peace in every
County, as well within Liberties as without, and all Majors, Sheriffs,
Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and other His Officers, Ministers, and
Subjects whatsoever, to take knowledge of His Majesty's Royal Will and
Pleasure therein; And that every one of them in their several places where the
Infection is, or shall happen to be, do use all care and utmost endeavor for
the due and effectual execution of the same: And to that end, His Majesty's
express charge and command is, That all the said Justices of the Peace, as well
within their several Jurisdictions as (if cause be) in places adjacent
thereunto, do assemble together in some safe and meet places, to treat and
consult amongst themselves, or with the Justices of neighboring Counties or
Liberties, where there shall be cause, how the said Orders and Directions may
be duly observed, for the better preventing the dispersion and increasing of
the Sickness, and for the Relief and well ordering of such, as are or shall
be infected with the Plague, and to take account how the said Orders and
Directions are from time to time performed, and the Offenders punished; So as
no Neglect, Remissness, or Offense in that behalf be suffered to pass without
due correction and chastisement. And His Majesty does hereby further declare,
that whosoever in this business (so much importing Himself, His Kingdom, and
People) shall be found Remiss or Negligent, whether they be Majors, Sheriffs,
Justices of Peace, Bailiffes, Constables, or other Officers, or persons of what
degree, quality, or condition soever, must expect to receive such condigue
punishment as by the strictest Laws or Statutes of the Realm, or otherwise
may be inflicted upon them.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster, the two and twentieth day of April, in
the twelfth year of Our Reign.
