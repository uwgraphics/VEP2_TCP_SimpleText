A Proclamation against selling of Ships.
WHereas We have been informed that sundry of Our Subjects, Masters and
Owners of Ships, respecting more their private gain and advantage, then the
public good and safety of Us and Our Dominions, do daily sell, or otherwise
dispose to Strangers and Forreiners their Ships and other Vessels, to the great
disseruice of Us and the State, in weakening the Navigations of this Kingdom;
We taking the same into Our Princely consideration and foreseeing the many
inconveniences which will ensue, if the same be not prevented, or the offenders
(if any such shall hereafter be found) be not severely punished, by the advice
of Our Privy Counsel do hereby straightly charge and command, that none of Our
Subjects, or others, living within Our obeisance, of what degree, quality, or
condition soever, do at any time hereafter presume, directly or indirectly, to
sell or alien, or by any ways or means, to dispose of any Ship or other
Vessel, of what burden soever the same shall be, and either made or built
within Our Dominions or without, being fit, or which may be made fit to sail
upon the Seas, to any manner of person either borne or resident out of Our
Dominions, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and of the seuerest penalties
and punishments, which by the Laws and Statutes of this Our Realm, or by Our
Prerogative Royal can be inflicted upon them.

And Our further will and pleasure is, that if any of Our Subjects, either
natural borne, or made Denizens, knowing any such offense to be committed,
shall not with all convenient speed reveal the same, to the body of Our Privy
Counsel, that every such person so concealing his knowledge, of or in the
Premises, shall for such his offense, be proceeded against, and punished as
the principal offenders. And further because We understand too well, what
great destruction has of late years been made of Timber fit for Shipping,
and how little care and providence has been used to preserve the same
according to Our Laws: We do further strictly charge and command, that all
and every Our loving Subjects in their several places, do preserve all such
Timber as shall be fit for Shipping with their best endeavors, as they tender
Our favor, and the danger of Our Laws, and would avoid the contrary at their
uttermost perils.

Given at Our Court at Nonsuch, the twelfth day of July, in the fifth year of
Our Reign, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
