TO THE COURTEOUS READER.
REader, before thou peruse my Book give me leave to advertise thee, that in
this ensuing Discourse, I do neither seek to defame any person of any degree
whatsoever, nor intend I to aim at the credit of any; but if any man find
himself touched with any thing herein mentioned, let him make his best use of
it for my part I shall only desire to reveal and discover such abuses as have
crept into this Kingdom, which all his Majesty's Subjects with a longing
desire do expect a reformation of, and God be thanked have already seen some
satisfactory events. Moreover, I shall desire thy favorable censure of this my
Book, wherein thou shall not find any refined language, or eloquent style (for
indeed the subject deserved it not) but a plain way fitted as near as I could
for every man's understanding, else would they want the sport and content which
I hope they will hereby reap, wherein they shall find nothing but what I have
found my self by experience; And for the maintaining of the credit hereof, I
must tell you that the copy lying by me this many years (not with any intent
ever to print it) did yield occasion to diverse of my friends to extract copies
for themselves; and moreover, the absence of it from my hands for almost two
years has yielded the like opportunity to diverse others unknown to me,
whereby many copies (only altered in some few words, have been lately by
earnest endeavors sought to be published for their own Works; This is all I
can desire, which if granted will strongly oblige me to consecrate my labors
to thy content, and my self thy professed servant.

T.B.

To the most Illustrious the lusticke Lansgrave of Latmos the man in the Moon.
TO thee (the most imaginary Sire)
Of each transcendent wit, and Engine maker,
The Ixion that first filcht Aethaeriall fire,
And every new Inventions chief creator,
The Moons Surveyor of her Works, or rather
Her Instructor, and our Projectors Father.
J give thee here to know what er'st befell,
The child whom heretofore thou did beget,
He that by Lines and Screwes would needs compel
The Sun to mend his pace when he was set,
Vouchsafe to read this lamentable story,
Whose wit can gallop faster then John Dory.
With the next Rundlet of his highness Claret,
Be this conveyed, and I Will be thankful for it.
THE PROIECTOR, and his PROIECTS.
WHen I first happened upon this Subject, I scarce durst venture the publishing
of any thing concerning it, lest I might be thought to touch at the credit and
reputation of some persons, whose worths are sufficiently known unto the World,
that although (by reason of the large pretenses and fawning flatteries of
Projectors) they have been importuned in some sort to countenance them, yet
never have they been confirmed in their good opinions and commendations. Let
this therefore be apology sufficient for my self, that I intend not herein to
touch the credit or reputation of any particular man, knowing, that Saepe a
Principibus magna ruina venit. Neither by Libelling will I seek to disparage
Arts or Artists (which ever were commendable in themselves.) Neither will I
dispute what kind of government might seem most fit and convenient in general:
nor presume to distinguish what regularity and order is most compliable with
any particular kingdom, I perceive my self happy in being ignorant of such
transcendent learning: but I will only aim at, and denote certain abuses
inserted into this peaceable and (in government) unparalleld Commonwealth.

My subject therefore which I have found out, is so far unworthy to be
employment for any solid capacity, that I had rather (if Hipponax (that never
did any thing but what procured much laughter) were alive) to take this in
hand, that he might be painted forth in his right colors.

This Projector, as far as I can find, never had generation, unless it were
that he was begot on a fair Faggot pile, between the man in the Moon, and
Tom Lancasters Laundresse; some call him business, but his most received name
is Projector, a creature that never stayed his full time of hatching, but got
out with the shell on his head, and so run to Court, where he has most
seriously employed his time in Court suits, as in the sequel of this story I
shall more at large decipher him.

First, therefore I shall tell you what a Projector is.

Secondly, how he did become a Projector.

Thirdly, how many professions he left to become a Projector.

Fourthly, what success attended his newfound mysteries to the singular good
and benefit of the Commonwealth of this Realm, and the everlasting memory of
so profitable a Profession.

Fifthly, his death and free disposal of all his goods and chattels, by his
last Will and Testament to his successors, and lastly his Epitaph.

What a Projector is.
A Projector is derived from the Latin, and signifies a man of a good
forecast, he is also said to be a creator of Court suites, an Inventor and
devisor of new things, and a pretended reformer of the old, which go commonly
by the name of Projects, provided that they had no other beginning or former
Invention; for if they be received, renewed, or reported upon any record, they
cannot come truly within the compass of Projects.

But verily he is the very Corne-cutter of the age wherein he lives, and has
a notable fault in the unsteadinesse of his hand, by reason whereof he does
often thrust his knife into the tender parts of a Commonwealth, to the very
quick, and never leaves until he have brought out the very Coare of their
purses: he imployes all his time, labor, study, and experience only to search
out the abuses of every Place, Profession, and Mystery whatsoever, next his
greatest study is to propose the fair outside of a reformation, and this he
begins with a Petition to his Majesty, with such mighty pretenses of enriching
the Kingdom, that he dares most impudently to affirm that it shall bring to
his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors for ever many thousands yearly; yea,
and employment for all the poor people of the Realm (which how well all these
late Projects have effected, I leave to judicious censure;) next comes a
reference where he still averres what he in his Petition proposed, and thus by
his large offers, and mediation of friends to the Referrees he obtaines a
slight approbation enough only to procure a Patent, then he thinks the worlds
his own, and then must there be an Office erected, whereby his Majesty, his
Heirs and Successors shall receive wonderfll benefts, by augmenting his yearly
Revenues, customs, and imposts, and the Commonwealth exceeding great good and
profit, and many thousands of poor people at the least shall find sufficient
employment.

Now the issues proceeding of these his pains and labor (which he pretends to
be only for the good of his Country, himself not getting by it one farthing)
are commonly called or known by the name of Projects, in respect of the Author
that invented and devise them, to which he gives diverse names, such as their
fancies best served; the better to gull the ignorant, one whereof is called
Heuretica, and that is an Art or Invention teaching how to devise new, and to
reform old, and is the first and chiefest of all, and as the primum mobile;
Likewise they give them other terms of Art as litterall Inventions, and
Mechanic Inventions, a litterall Invention is of Logic, Rhethoricke,
Grammar, the Mathematical Sciences, and writing all which they say were only
Projects; A Mechanic Invention is the art of the Projector which by effectual
Instruments and means brings forth, some new visible Work, pretended good
and profitable to the Commonwealth.

And hitherto they add the Mystery of Printing, Shipping, the Art of Grinding,
Building, making of Salt, Allomes, Coppers, Saltpeter, Felt-making, Sadlers,
Carts, Ploughes, Harrowes, and consequently they dare most impudently to
affirm that all Arts, Trades, Crafts, Sciences, Mysteries, Occupations,
Professions, Devises, and slights whatsoever, were merely Projects, in respect
of the Authors that devised them, whom they will needs have (to uphold their
own credits) to be Projectors, and yet they pretend to mend all these, and to
make them both more beneficial, and more serviceable; likewise they will tell
you that the first Discoveries of the West Indies, by Columbus, Magellane, and
Drake, were Projects, seeking thereby to bring into their rank of Projectors,
three such Ingenious, Noble, and Venturous persons, And thus they gull the
Commonwealth, by making many fair promises of wealth to fall upon them on a
sudden, telling them that the Pestle and Mortar were good Primitive
inventions, but the Water-Mill, Hand-mill, and Windmill, were derivative from
them by a Projector, and much better, yet he will have another shall far
pass all these, and that he calls a Plegnicke Engine, which shall not only
grind Corn as the Mills, but shall also serve to blow the Bellows to any
Furnace, and never stand still as the Milles do, but be in perpetual motion.

Also the Smithes ordinary Bellows are naught, a scurvie Primitive Invention,
he has a Derivative Invention worth a hundred of them, more handsomely and
strongly made, which shall blow forth not only cold wind, but also flames of
fire, water, and dust, at the same time, and at the same hole. And these are
the chief heads of Projecting. Next I will show you what they pretend the
nature of every Project (of their devising) to be: to which I will add the
faults liable, and never wanting in them.

First therefore, they make every Project to be of two degrees, the lesser and
the greater; and each degree is threefold. The lesser virtues of every Project
are, Equi-sufficiency, Equi-cheapnesse, Equi-excellency; but the greater are,
more sufficient, more cheap, more excellent: This is the chief Axel-tree that
upholds and carries all Projects; for all Projectors do pretend the three last
in every new invention.

But now let us come to the faults, which although they are but three, yet I
believe they will be found more frequently than the three Virtues; and these
are less sufficiency, less cheapnesse, and less excellency. The greater
faults are also three, that is, insufficiency, exceeding dearnesse, and
exceeding baseness, ugliness, or ilfavourednesse: and of these I must
confess I never saw any Project that had not the most part, if not all. These
faults shall be compared to the virtues, when we come to speak of the success
that attended these new found Mysteries.

Those that are willing to deal in any these new Businesses, either by being
Patentees, Clerks of the Patent, Surveyors of the Works, by buying Shares,
Half Shares, or Quarter parts, etc. must be sure to have their purse well
lined, for they shall be at continual expense, and it may be never receive
farthing profit. As first, their share may cost a hundred or two hundred
pounds, the use of the money is lost, and yet they shall be assessed to pay for
every Full Part that costs an hundred pounds, ten or 12 pounds once or twice a
year, toward the erecting the Works, and propagating the business. And thus
they live in expectation about fourteen years (the usual limit for Patents
in that kind) and if it chance to hold out so long, in any likelihood then it
comes to his Majesty. But they seldom last to that, for the State perceiving
their fooleries, and that they can never accomplish the thousand part of their
pretenses, and the commonwealths expectation, calls in their Patents, leaving
the Projector far engaged to his friends, by bringing them into such a deal of
trouble and expense to no purpose, by his fair promises and persuasions,
insomuch that some have all their estate (which though perhaps but mean, yet
might have honestly maintained them) laid at the stake, relying only on the
Projectors vain promises; who deals much like the Turkish Alcharon, that if
they will obey the Laws and Decrees of their great Prophet Mahomet, they shall
have after their deaths brave gardens, pleasant fountains, and Wenches with
great eyes. Even thus they play their part, promising thousands yearly to them
that will lay down any money to propagate a new invention: and the more to
delude their Creditors, they will upon the least objection or mislike, be
presently ready (like some sects of Heretics) to prove their profession by
Scripture to be right and straight, and call all Artificers Projectors, and all
arts and sciences Projects, which are nothing in effect but the vain issues of
idle brains. Those (as I told you) that would deal in any Projects, must be
sure to have in readiness good bags of money: for all your Projectors hold
this as a general maxim, That it is the wisest, safest, and most credible
course for a Projector, not to ask under hand, whereby he shall be driven to
repair to them again the second time, but rather at the first let him agree
for more money, and not for less then will serve the turn toward his
expenses in trials, and hereof every Sharer must bear pay, defray and
discharge his part equally with the parties individent. And therefore they tell
their Undertakers, that they must expect some loss in the trial of new
businesses, be the Projector never so perfect in his Theoricke, for though he
endeavors never so much to give his Workmen true and perfect directions, and
instruct his Artificers never so carefully, yet they will often fail, and err
in their Work, by which means the Instrument being experimented, and put to
trial, becomes insufficient for the appointed use, and many times (says he)
the Projector may fail himself in some one point, for which there is no
help, but only to redress and amend the fault in the Instrument, or else to
make a new Instrument in the others stead, neither of which can be done without
further charge; and this must the Sharers disburse, and yet there must be (as
they call it) an annual charge, which is an assessing of every Sharer from
time to time upon occasion, for moneys to maintain, repair, and continue the
said primary Instruments belonging to the said new business, after the first
Plantation.

For the errors, some the Projector (to save himself) lays on the Workmen,
the Creditors on the Projector, so that after much trouble, pains, vexation,
and charges, and daily expectation of the great sums which would arise and
acrew thereby, doing their utmost endeavors both by money and friends, to set
forward, further and advance this admirable Work, have in the end, just their
labor for their pains, and are glad to sit down by the loss, because either
the Projector has showed them a fair pair of heels (as most of them do) or
else not worth one groat whereby to give them the least satisfaction.

How he became a Projector.
HE became a Projector in this sort, and upon this very occasion following.
Feeling a consumptive weakness in his Shop and Warehouse, and continual most
terrible Convulsions in his Counterbox, he began most grievously to complain,
and cry out of the Colic, suddenly expecting an Eruption; hereupon he day by
day imployes himself in making a most strict scrutiny and review into his
Shopbooks, as well for debtors solvent, as insolvent, he most diligently
compares his Registers together, and vows to spare no man whom the Law puts
into his hand, at length to his comfort he fortunately lights upon a debt of
his Cozen at Court, For such a piece of Stuff, so much: this makes him; and
although he once thought it a very desperate debt, yet now he will spend some
time in adventuring his fortune in the trial of procuring it; whereupon he
makes many visits at Court, thinking with himself that perhaps his kinsman may
have so much good nature remain in him, as to take some occasion to speak of
it himself: but his Cousine was crafty enough to work best for his own
advantage, and so from time to time put him off with other discourse. But at
last mistrusting what the matter was, and that all his cunning could not rid
him of this Hinchman, that neither the showing of the Privy lodgings, nor a
place for his she cousin at a Masque, nor the sending of Venison twice in a
season, nor the bottle of the Kings wine, nor the Court tart, nor all the Court
complements and protestations could once procure him to grant longer day; that
neither the Winter journies, nor the Summer progress could induce him to
forget it, or at least to leave his opportunity, he resolved the next time he
came to give him some satisfaction, and therefore upon his accustomed time of
visitation, knowing his place and posture, found him waiting his coming out,
and there with a most court nod he beckned him to come forward, and thus he
accosted him.

Cousin, I have considered of your more than ordinary frequent visitations,
which I conceive to arise from that little matter of debt that is betwixt us.
You know we are seldom counted monied men, and I protest I have not
wherewithal to satisfy your expectation for the present; but I had thought
that so many courtesies might have countervailed so small a matter, and have
made you a little more respective. Yet that I may in some sort satisfy you I
will put you in the way that shall make you for ever, and be worth no less
than thousands yearly into your purse.

This made the Citisen start, with such a kind of alteration, as if joy and
fear had strove together within him: the only naming of riches increased joy,
when on the sudden a fear possessed him, lest it might not be true which he
heard. But expelling this ecstasy, he attended the sequel of the story in this
manner,) The business I have already very well considered and make no
question, but I shall suddenly procure a Patent of Privilege from his Majesty
to engrosse it solely to my self for I think it will scarce come to more then
a Copyhold Project, which must not exceed ten thousand pounds per annum; for
if it should exceed that, then it were a royal Invention, and due only to his
Majesty. And I can assure you, if ever there were an ingenuous Art consisting
of heat without the sight of fire and smoke, for all men's uses invented
questionless this is the same, or else it is not to be found upon the earth:
but surely (Cozen) till our Times Wars, and Barbarity have never suffered so
noble an Invention to appear; or if at any time there has been any such
Invention, it lies antiquated, and now is revived; and this is a kind of new
devised Furnace or Kilne, which shall Roast, bake, and Boil, and starch
Clothes, dry Malt, Hoppes, Wheat, Oats, Felts, or any other thing, witbout
sight of fire or touch of smoke.

First, and that without danger of fiering, for they are so perfectly made and
framed, that they cannot take fire.

Secondly, they are made to divert smoke, the chief enemy to man's health,
and particularly to his eyes, his head, his heart, and lungs.

Thirdly, they do neatly and sweetly roast our meat, that no vapor or fume
can come near unto it, which is both a neatness, and a singular safety; no
Sout falls here into the Pottage, nor fat into the fire.

Fourthly these Kilnes and Furnaces shall dry Malt more constantly in every
part of the Kilne, because the sweet heat without smoke is dispersed
proportionably into all parts at once, so that all the Malt shall be dried
alike, and so your Six shillings Bear shall be as strong as ten shillings
Bear made of ordinary dried Malt, and the reason is partly beoause the old
smoaky kilnes leave many corns undryed, and partly, because the smoke
piercing through the wet Malt, and there finding resistance makes an
exceeding deep and strong impression into the very body and center of the
Malt, and there dries, infecteth, and consumes the very spirit (which is a
kind of Balsamicall salt) and radical moisture, juice, and substance of the
Malt.

Fifthly, they dry Hoppes sweetly without smoke, and conserve the Flower in its
own nature, which the smoaky Kilnes do destroy, so Hoppes which are but a
Flower and of tender parts by the smoaky drying Kilnes do loose the best of
their radical moisture, and most of their Balsamicall spirit, and retain in a
manner only their fixed Salt together with their excrementitious dead substance,
and the Salt infection of the smoke.

Sixthly, they dry black or smotty Wheat, Oats, or any other grain, or fish.

Seventhly, they shall save much fuel as one fourth part.

Eighthly, they will dry any thing that needs drying without the least touch of
smoke, so that it may be termed an Invention, or rather a new and marveilous
Art, to all men admirably useful, injurious to none: moreover man's health
(without which Honor, Fame, Riches, Friends, and Life it self seems but
troublesome and noisome) cannot be long conserved in perfect estate, or once
lost be well recovered without this invention, as the properties thereof do
clearly, and Philosophically, and Experimentally from our own very senses
demonstrate. Of this rare invention I had obtained a grant for the sole use of
our late Sovereign King James, but before his Letters could be made Patents,
and pass the ordinary Offices of this Kingdom our peaceable King departed
this life, and so by the disturbance of cruel fortune I was hindered from
prosecuting my good designs, but notwithstanding all these my misfortunes,
crosses, and losses in this world, I have again adventured to publish my
Works, and petition his Majesty for his Letters Patents of Privilege for the
sole using, and licensing of this said Invention, of the goodness and
singularity thereof I will speak no more, for the works themselves will be
Vocal, and I shall make it appear to be so beneficial, and profitable to my
country and commonwealth, that it shall bring to the Kings Majesty his Heirs
and Successors yearly, many thousands, with the employment of many thousands of
poor people; And Cousen if you can but procure one thing, you make your self
and me for ever, that is, I would have you to take up some store of money,
because you knew there must be some few Fees scattered amongst servants and
Clerks, and that we may be able to make our trialls for one part of the
Organicke means of a Mechanicke is procuring, now the procuring means is
money to be impended and disbursed in charges, for it is the instrument of
instruments and mean of Means, procuring all other instruments and means
merely operative, and when once they are procured, and provided by it, it
measures their worth and valuation, and these moneys I call primary and
annual; the primary moneys are such as I would have you procure to be
disbursed about the first foundation, erection, and setting up my new
business, in some one convenient place, whereby my workhouse may be furnished
with all Permanent and Transient Tools, and Instruments; Transient Tools are
all kind of Fuel, and Oar, which serve but once, but Permanent Tools are
such as serve diverse times as are the several solid hand Tools or other
Instruments used by any kind of trade, likewise it will be requisite to build
Models both Saperficiall, Real, Directionall, and Motionall, which cannot be
done but with great charge; as for the annual disbursments the sharers shall
expend equally, and that you may have such satisfaction as you expect by my
discourse I shall not think it sufficient to offer you a share, but am willing
to join you Patentee with me; and thus you may be sure, that by this means we
shall both increase our estates, and advance our names. He tells him moreover,
that such and so potent are his friends, that he should take it as a great
trespass to his reputation, once to question the obtaining of his suit; but
because of some urgent occasion, he could not spend so much time in this
Discourse, as he desired, nor utter his mind so fully to him, as he could wish
he might, but if his occasions would permit him to give him a meeting, any day
in the long Gallery that reaches over the middle Temple toward the water side,
or under the Temple trees, he would most willingly embrace that opportunity,
where he would borrow more time to spend about this business, to his greater
and more fuller satisfaction.

Solemn leave is taken on both sides, the Citizen goes home almost extasied,
scarce feeling the ground he went on, he was so taken with his Cozens Project:
well, he immediately goes home, takes up all the money he possibly can, and
seeks all that he can by friends and otherwise to get into some Parish
Office, whereby he may come to have the stock thereof in his custody: his
Countrey-house is redeemed, and because it seems too little, and has no good
forefront, nor prospect from his Balcone, therefore there must be laid out in
building thrice as much as the Fee-simple of all when it is finished will
afford; and last of all he vows to forsake the plain pathway of all Trades,
Professions, and Mysteries whatsoever, and places more faith in a Project, then
in all the probabilities of his own Trading, for by this he thinks to raise his
fortunes on a sudden: but take it for a general rule, when a Citizen turns
Projector, he has the very Tokens of the wonderful crack upon him, and so
out of all hope of recovery although he may linger on.

After he had long beat his brains about this business, he calls to mind a
cunning crafty Scriviner, the very Noverint of his age, and one who had lived
long in the City, and knew all their tricks to a hair; this man had also a
great desire to become rich on a sudden; him he meets at the Ship behind the
Old Exchange, and there prepares him for his purpose, and the next morning he
appointed to come to the Scriveners house, to know his opinion upon
consideration of the business; which accordingly he did, and sound him in his
Chamber chopping up a few prayers (as one that was unwilling to trouble God
Almighty too much) and withal (being a man that could rather do two things at
once, then lose any minute of time) he was crosse-gartering himself, where
without the least disturbance of his devotion, he prays and discourses of the
business all at a breath, and commends much the course he intended, seriously
vowing to further and aid him all he could or might, which he delivered with
a kind of familiar wringing him by the hand, thereby to insinuate his meaning,
as unto his Share. Hereupon they walk along to the Tavern to drink their
mornings draught, good compliance is on both sides, and the Scrivener (as the
common use and practice of them is) was ever more ready in promising, then the
other in propounding, insomuch that an unspeakeable and inseparable amity was
concluded between them, and so for that time they parted.

Next he remembers a grave Counselor, one whom few Clients gave leisure
enough to think on the form of drawing the conveyances and assignments of the
shares, half parts, and deputations of Shires, besides an intimate friend of
his, a learned man both in Philosophy and Divinity; he was further assured of
some friends in the West Country, most Pragmaticall for new Inventions, who
were busied in their Patents for extractions, and separations of Minerals, and
Mettalls, by new invented means, some others also from the Allome Works, who
played the like tricks of Leger-de-Maine, with their Undertakers, that if they
and their Clearks can agree in their accounts they are like to make their
dealers scarce able to retain their Urine, if they fall not into uncurable
strangury.

Then he goes to an old Usurer, one whom he knew always to be stored with
plenty of Plutoes Corn, and tells him that he is likely to obtain a Patent of
Privilege from his Majesty, to erect certain new Projects in his Highness
Realms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and Dominion of Wales: and because
he wants some small matter to expend in trials, he desires him to let him have
so much, and he will morgage him a full part of the clear Profits arising and
acrewing thereby. The Usurer seeing him gravely clad, and withal, having
known him before for a man sufficient (as he imagined) was content, so as he
had his desire, and the other thought he could not better place his money,

Next he goes to a rich Widow of his familiar acquaintance, and shows her
whole bags of Silver, and tells her that if she would join in a bargain with
him, that he could now have, it would make them both for ever; the Widow, when
she had heard on his tale, began almost to leap for joy, and her fingers
itched to be telling out the money, that she should get yearly by her share,
and therefore with much dexterity dispatched him, and thus he was througly
provided toward his fundamental expenses.

How many Professions he left to become a Projector.
NExt let me show you how many Trades, Functions, and Occupations he left to
become a Projector, for if he be a decayed Merchant, this Profession may put
him in hope of procuring a Protection, if an unpractised Lawyer, it may be a
means to draw good store of Clients to his Chamber, if an old cast Auditor, it
may find him employment enough to cast and calculate how many thousands
yearly every Sharers part comes to in the conception of any these new Projects.

1 First, the Lawyers were found exceeding forward, and and because some of
them had few Clients, and less takings, they would mend the matter by getting
the grant of a fifth Term.

2 The Merchant had too long trusted to Byling sleyes Books, and finding small
profit thereby, he hastens to the Court to present his suite, and expect the
success of new Inventions.

Thirdly, the Fishmongers if it were not for a poor Lent, now almost lost for
want of custom, had but an ill year made up of Frydayes and Saturdayes,
(which scarce would be neither, if it were not for some, who being weary with
glutting themselves with Flesh, did not desire Fish for varieties sake)
therefore they all agreed to go to the Western Seas, where a certain
Projector will find employment for them, and bring to this Kingdom forty
Millions of pounds yearly.

Fourthly, the Baker mislikes his Oven utterly, and seeks to reform it, which
done, he gets a Patent of Privilege, that none may do it but himsefe; but
because he found not employment sufficient to maintain himself in this
Kingdom, therefore they report he is gone into Holland.

Fifthly, the Brewer, poor melancholy man, cannot tell what to say to the
business, but he finds Malt very dear, and never worse, which he conceives
to proceed from the new Kilnes, and his customers cry out on him for hopping
too much: whereupon he is resolved to Petition his Majesty, that the new
Project of Kilnes may be suppressed, and likewise the Patent of incorporating
Maulsters, and then he is verily persuaded he shall afford us better Beer,
and at an easier rate.

Sixthly, the Mettle-men, Brasiers, Cutlers, Smithes, Plummers, and the Mystery
of Alchimists, perceiving Trading begin to be very scarce in London, are all
resolved very speedily to repair to the Forest a Deane.

Seventhly, next came the whole Rabble of poor Atturneyes Clerks, who were the
chief upholders (and had for the most part been there bred up) of the
three-peny Ordinary in Warwicke-lane, where they ascend their dining room with
a Ladder, which (their diet being once served in) was most ceremoniously taken
away.

And these kind of people having left their aforesaid Professions, had a great
mind to become rich on a sudden, and therefore they quickly sought out our
former Cozen, who as I showed you before was already become a most excellent
proficient as any of his time; here he makes them begin (as he had formerly
done) first with their accidence, which is Topliffes notes, then to their
Grammar which is Pheltons Books, and thus they have good method for what they
undertake. These are they who respect not the breadth of the Church door, but
bend all their endeavors, and employ all their wits to be sounding the
profundity, and measuring the circumference of other men's purses, nay, there
shall not a trade, profession, mystery, place, or office have a jadish trick
more than ordnary, but they will whip the bawd, and presently procure a
general reformation. Moreover, these poor decayed Tradesmen, and the
aforesaid ragged regiment of discontented Clerks, will open the whole secrets
of every profession; they will tell you what a quantity of Gum and Coperas the
whole office spends in a year, and what store of calve-skins pass through
their hands every term.

8 I had almost forgot those that were to have had the first place in regard of
their priority in Projects, and these are your eminent Citizens of Blackfryers,
English Feathermakers, Dutch Iewellers, Scotch Tailors, and French Shoemakers,
with all their foreign forces, who are like to enjoy their ancient privileges
without molestation or interruption of any kind.

9 The Miller likewise had almost been slipped over, yet he cannot fadge with
his old Mill, it grindes not well, nor fast enough he cannot grow rich with it
quickly enough, therefore he will have a horse-wind-water-mill, and engrosse it
to himself. These and many more might be rehearsed, but I will give but a
touch upon every one of them, whereby you may judge of the whole.

What success attended his new found Mysteries, to the singular comfort of the
Commonwealth, and the everlasting memory of so profitable a Profession.
THis Cozen of ours being so plentifully furnished, set them all on Work,
every one in his several Function and Profession, wherein they labored with
much willingness and dexterity, that every one brought him so great variety of
Art and Workmanship, that he took upon him to supply all manner of Courtiers
with these kind of commodities.

Then he calls all his Associates (being bold Britains) to a public assembly,
drils them in the Garden, and they make their set battles under the Trees in
the new Walks, which piece of ground was listed in, and levelled for the same
purpose; and here he began to show them how easy a matter it was for them to
strip themselves of their mean estate and condition, whereto they were
collapsed, and on a sudden become mighty Projectors, some should be Officers
of superintendency, some general Commissioners of reformation, others
Dispensers of Law terrifying penalties, and in general all most dear and
natural Patrons and Patricions of their mother country, telling them also how
easy these ways would seem to them if the ingenuous reasons were once looked
into, that there will accrue much joy and comfort unto them when they shall see
the reasons of so Philosophical profit, or profitable Philosophy; as on the
other side (said he) I hold these most miserable men, or rather images, or
Ciphers of men, then very men indeed, who employ their busy time and care in
idleness, vain Pastimes, long sleeps, etc. as though they had no more time
then might be well spent in the exalting of virtue, supplanting of vice, and
profiting their country, friends, and consanguinity, but you only are to be
esteemed, and accounted happy, who use your time (being so great a treasure) in
perfecting such good Works, and rare Inventions as are both honest and
profitable to whole Nations, and in particular to our own Kingdom, who keep
war against ignorance that knows no virtue, honesty nor duty, and therefore
means no truth; for our parts (let malicious envy detract never so much) yet
after Ages shall say, that we meant really and heartily, and our endeavors
aimed at such substantial marks as contain the honor, fame, and perpetual
memory of our Gracious Sovereign, and his Subjects health, profit, and
pleasure.

These men thus tickled in the head thought that they had certainly now, and
never till now found out the true way of thriving, protection, and good
forecast, whereupon they all agreed, that this was the only way to become
suddenly rich, that ever was or could be discovered; and so from thenceforth
(after the manner of their master) they took upon them the name of Projectors,
men of the best forecast, utterly disclaiming all their former Trades,
Professions, Arts, Sciences, Mysteries, Crafts, and Occupations, to all intents
and purposes whatsoever.

It would do you good to hear the whole pack of these together, they are so
excellent both for sent and cry, and because you shall see what varieties of
Projects they daily brought in, I will endeavor to relate some of them to you,
whereof some have failed long since, and are utterly abolished, others make a
fair show for the present, but are very likely to come to the same pass the
former have done; and by these that I will describe you may judge what the rest
are like to be.

Projects.
1 THe good old Scriviner he would needs have a Monopoly, were it but the sole
engrossing of all Loveletters in Prose and Verse in these his Majesty's
Dominions of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales.

2 The Lawyers had a great mind to have foysted in a fifth Term, and have
increased the multiplication of Officers according to the augmentation of
suites of this present age above the former.

3 The officer on the Bank side, beside certain small impositions devised how
to entitle the chief Butler to the sole Licensing of all Liters and small
Vessels for carrying and recarrying of all Merchandises whatsoever within the
River of Thames.

4 The Engineer would drive back the Ocean, and make firm land, not doubting
but by that and certain hidden Treasure, or Treasure Trover elsewhere whereof
he had notice, the world should take more notice of him very shortly.

5 The Miller had invented a new Milne to grind Corn, and because the old
Windmill had not only his Sails mounted in the Wind, but also all the whole
Fabric of the Milne, by which means it is subject to be blown down with
storms; he therefore will have a Plegnicke Windmill to stand firm on the
ground without any hazard or danger of blowing down; and as the old Milne
has his cross Sails to be haled, and turned to the Wind, this Milne shall
have Sails lie round on the top of the house, always ready for all Winds; it
shall grind with three or four pair of Stones at once, and three or four
times as much Meal in one hour; and of these he would have five sorts; the
first was called a Horsewin, because it moved with the Horse and Wind; the
second was a Horsewater, because it went by Horse, and Water; the third a
Windwater, because it went by Wind and Water; the fourth a Horswinwater, moved
with Horse, wind, and Water together; the fifth a Water Plegnicke which should
move invisibly under the water by the Water.

6 There is a new Art and Invention Metalorganicke, which chiefly by the means
of Plegnicke Instruments makes another new kind of Water Milnes, Windmilnes,
Horse Milnes, and hand Milns for the grinding of Corn, Tanners Bark, Brazill,
for the sawing of Woods, making of Oils, battering of Irons, and Coppers, and
for Tuckeage and Fullage of Woollen cloth, or Yellow oyled Leathers, or for any
other use or purpose whatsoever, that other Milnes serve for, and these are
less chargeable to make, set up, keep, and repair, and yet more necessary,
and convenient then any other sort of Milnes which be now in use.

7 There is a new Art and Invention of making an artificial kind of
Water-Work for the abundant raising, and mounting of Water after an easier
order then those that are already used in the Commonwealth.

8 There is another new Art and Invention for the making of very effectual and
beneficial Instruments of Fishing, as new kind of Burces, new kind of
Nettage, and Bateage, by which new devised means, great abundance of Fish
might be caught with far less charges, and in shorter time then by the
ordinary Arts of Fishing.

9 There is another new Art and Invention of making diverse kinds of Household
movables, as artificial Doors, Windows, Curtains, Presses, Tables,
Stools, Bedsteads, Hangings, Chests, and diverse other things, handsommer, and
more convenient then heretofore is done by the ordinary way of other stuff.

10 There is another new Art and Invention by diverse new exact Mechanike Arts,
Mysteries, Ways and Secrets, to melt, make and work Irons, Steeles, Leads,
Tinnes, Coppers, Brasses, and such like; also all kind of Metalick
concoctions, as Sandmettals, Ashemettals Ammels, and such like; also all kind
of burnt Earthes, as Tyles, Pavingstones, Brickes, and such like, with
Seacoale, Pitcoale, Earthcoale, and Brush Fuel, and this ways he could save
in this Kingdom, three hundred and thirty thousand pounds yearly.

11 Another new Art and Invention is for the breeding of Foul and Pullen,
which he would have sold, but at the rate of eight pence a couple, one with
another, and would be worth (as he says) in this Kingdom, yearly four
hundred thousand pounds.

12 Another new Art and Invention is to plant great store of Fruit trees in
this Kingdom, which would arise to twelve hundred thousand pounds per annum.

13 Another new Art and Invention is to suppress half the Pigeon houses, and
Pigeons kept over Gates, Chambers, and other places for that purpose, whereby
he would yearly save in this Kingdom, so much Corn as is worth two Millions
of pounds at the least, which they destroy and spoil.

14 Another by destroying all feathered Fowls, would save yearly in this
Realm as much Corn as is worth three Millions of pounds.

15 Another by destroying of Vermin, would save yearly the worth of five
thousand pound at the least, besides young Fawnes, Hawks, and Rabbets.

16 Another by a general destroying of Rats, and Mice, would save yearly, in
Bread, Cheese, Corn, and other things, four hundred thousand pounds at the
least.

So that in these six last Projects, he would save yearly in this Kingdom
nine Millions, two hundred thousand pounds, besides the good that should grow
thereby to the Commonwealth.

17 Another new Art and Invention was devised and erected for the Institution
of Noblemen and Gentlemen, and all ingenuous men who will strive to deserve,
called an Academy, but that was not the Inventors aim, for he cared not how
they profited, so his purse might have some feeling.

18 Another rare Art and Invention was put in execution for the making of
excellent good Bar Iron from the Iron Stone or Mine to the Bar without the
help of a Furnace, and that with Small Coal; and in every Tun of Iron, whereas
the old way of melting spent at the least six loads and a half of Charcoale,
this way would spend in every Tun but five loades of Small Coal.

19 Another new Art and Invention was to make and erect certain new Kilnes or
Furnaces to dry Malt, Hops, washed Wheat, Oats, Flax, Hemp, Bark, Felt,
Fish, Wool, and such like without the touch of smoke, also with the
selfsame fire, and at the same time, will in a most perfect form and
equality of dispersion of heat, roast, bake, boil, or brew, dry linen,
stove, bathe, distill, and such like things without the sight of fire or
annoyance of smoke.

20 Another new Art and Invention is devised by the Fulling Milner, which was a
Wooden Horse, that with Scrues and Devises should travel further in a day by
much then the Dromedaries, carry a far greater burden and I warrant you fast
much longer, and for profit he is very reasonable, for he craves but one of
the new Farthings for every pound that all Brewers, Bakers, Carriers, Kidders,
Maulsters, and others shall carry, or transport thereon from place to place
through the Realms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and Dominion of Wales,
toward the repairing of the cracked perricranion much decayed in the study of
this rariety, which for Art and Workmanship surpasses any that ever was
Invented of that sort.

21 Another seeing Grain grow very dear, and mouths daily increase, for a
remedy Invented how to make good and perfect nutrimentall bread of Pompeons,
Mellons and Cucumbers, and intended presently to profess the Mystery, unless
the Company of Bakers would make composition with him for the suppression of
the secret.

22 Another most rare and new Intendion was to preserve life by removing of any
man from the cold into the warm, and from the warm into a more warmer
climate, exceeding in heat as Nature shall more and more decay, and old age
draw on, whereby to supply that with Art, wherein Nature fails. A brave
Project to make the life of man (by observing of this order, and following the
Sun as he goes forward in age) to continue five times as long. An excellent
Invention, certainly to fool the Fates, and a stratageme to overthrow the
Universe Fabric of the Pharmacopea.

23 This puts me in mind of another, a very notable one, who pretended to
lengthen life also by removing ill savours; And to this end his ingenuous
Projecting brain devised that every man, and woman within the City of London
should employ two boxes made very close of Wood to keep in the smell, and
these must be removed with Carts every two days, and then brought again being
discharged, and cleansed; and for these his extraordinary pains, and charges,
he would have but a penny a Week of every house, only the chiefest gain he
expected was out of that which he carried away, whereof he intended to make
Saltpeter, and so furnish the Realm extraordinarily with Gunpowder; this was
not very well liked by the Goldfinders, for had it gone on, they must of
necessity have turned Saltpetermen, because they know no other trade but what
concerned such stinking business.

24 Another new Invention was the engrossing of Soapemaking, which when all the
Undertakers were almost beggered, they were glad to sell to the Old Soapemakers
again.

25 Another new Invention was to seal all the Butter that came into the Cities
of London, Bristow, or Newcastle, pretending none but what was very good, and
for every Firkin he engrossed two pence.

26 Another most rare Invention was that because Usury is held unlawful by the
laws of God and Man, and only connived at for tradings sake, therefore he would
have all Usurers pay to the King twelve pence in every pound of money taken for
Interest, so that out of the years use of one hundred pounds, his Majesty
should have eight shillings.

27 Another would have an halfepeny a joint for every joint of Meat dressed by
any common Cook, on a Friday or Saturday.

28 Another considering the great inconvenience to the City of London by the
smoke of the Brickilns, would have a Patent to make them pay sixepence in
every thousand of Brickes.

I could increase my book to a greater Volume, if I should name all the
Projects which I have known, but because I intend this book for an hours
recreation I will conclude with one more.

29 The next therefore comes the whole rabble of thredbare Clerks, and
bankerupt Tradesmen, who having already discovered and laid open the abuses,
deciets, and slights of all Offices, and Occupations fit for reformation, would
now in all the haste have an Office erected to procure Assigners, create
Registers, Surveyors, deputy Surveyors, Clerks of the Patent, Masters of the
Works, and the like, together with Clerks of every several Shire the better
to attend and see to the reformation, and to gather up the yearly revenues,
and return them into the Office, and all this should be for the ease and
releife of the poor subject, and great revenues to his Majesty, his Heirs,
and Successors.

32 Of this ragged regiment, the one had stolen an Invention of making an
Engine with a Plegnicke Screw, for this service of purpose, ten whereof being
plied with three able men a piece should beat an Army of thirty thousand armed
men out of the field; but says he, when it has killed a whole Army of men,
and they very thick on heaps, how shall the Engine go.

33 Another of them had got a fine device to make Vessels row themselves
against Wind and Tide, also he would have a most curious Dinner served by
invisible hands out of the water, on a Table, and be set into a Barge; and a
Dragon should fly all the while over the Barge, and spit out of his mouth
Bottles of most rich Wine; this should have been showed upon the Thames, but
when it came to the serving up of the Dinner, it would not do; whereupon he
had no other excuse, But a pox on it, some body had cut his Cable: Now you must
understand that none of these famous fellows, but either had or sought most
earnestly to have a Patent of Privilege to engrosse these Projects solely to
themselves, pretending no benefit at all to them, but only so far forth as
to defray their necessary expenses, but all the profit to acrew only to his
Majesty, and the good of the Commonwealth, which how false they are, the
success of these several Projects in this Age will show to every one. These
Projects had very ill success, because as I have showed you, they had every
one of them some great faults, as insufficiency, exceeding dearnesse, exceeding
baseness or ugliness.

The new Waterworkes to raise Waters being less sufficient for the purpose
then the old way, and more chargeable to be erected, and in regard of
excellency more imperfect, became a worthless Project.

The new Invention of melting Iron from the Oar with Seacoale, had one of the
before recited faults; for though it may be melted that way, yet the good
Mettalicall quality of the Iron is destroyed, or at least the greatest part of
it; for there is a certain Arsenicall, or Antimoniall quality in all
subterraneall substances combustible, both which are poisons to Iron, and make
it altogether insufficient.

The Engine to sow Wheat was less excellent then the old ordinary way of
sowing.

The Invention of making Windowing of pure Venice Glass, the sale Mechanicke
was exceeding dear, and costly, and therefore although it be more excellent or
more sufficient then the ordinary kind of Windowing by green Glass, yet the
Projector can do no good of it, because it has the fault of exceeding
dearness.

The great Imperial Engine before spoken of was to be tried amongst the whole
Company of Projectors but when the fire was given, it being overtaken by
mistake of measure, and moderation (a matter which Projectors seldom regard,
and spends so much money in fundamental trials as they call them) it suddenly
recoyled and breaking in the discharge took Pompeon Bread such a blow on the
bosom, that he was presently carried off, and is never likely to repair to
the Court again, until a dear year repair his reputation.

The Fulling Milners famous wooden Horse not like the Trojan Horse used to
War, started at the mighty crack, cast his burden, and before he came to
Islington, brake one of his hinder legs, by which he became utterly
unserviceable, and not long after also gave up his unparaleld life, bequeathing
his vaste body (like Tom Lankfords Gelding) to his Master for Winter fuel to
comfort his melancholy soul.

These things and many others falling out very contrary to this brave
courageous mind, cast him into an incurable consumption of Conceit, although
he was a while palliated by some letters from others his fellows, of a better
success upon another trial, but all would not serve turn; his Physicians
found that he was much troubled with a Reference, but was a little lightened by
a cordial Certificate, yet in the end no Physic could be administered that
could work with him, but of an extraordinary obstruction, and stopping at the
Great Seal, he shortly after dyed.

Since whose death I find that in the time of his sickness, be made his last
Will and Testament in writing, desiring that there might be an Office erected
of purpose for the enroling of the same, and of others his successors, wherein
he showed himself a true Projector both in life and death.

The Projectors last Will and Testament.
IN the name of the great Egerian Nympha, propitious Patroness of all
Projectors, since she first inspired her Pomphilius the most Potent that ever
was of that Profession. J that was before busied in making, and framing of
Commonwealths, as my least Employment, am now become no more then an ordinary
mortal man, making my last Will and Testament in manner and form following:

Imprimis, I will that my tenth part in the running Lottery be bestowed in the
building of an Hospital, to which the maimed Projectors that have miscarried
shall be conveyed to be there well provided for, recovered, and made
serviceable.

Item, My will is, that if any Courtier after my decease prove so miraculously
honest as to perform to mine Executors what he contracted with me in my life
time, it be disbursed in the erecting of certain Almes-houses for the receite
only of such as have consumed their estates in attending for great Preferments,
Offices, Clerkships, and Surveyors places, upon the deceitful proof and
success of Projects; and one of these Almeshouses I think fit to be built in
Ram Alley, where they may have the benefit of the Temple Garden, and Gallery
to free them from the lest suspicion of danger, for of all Spices the very
sight of the Mace frights them almost into a quotidian Ague; another I would
have to be in Milford Lane, where I have found good refuge my self at a pinch;
the third to be in Fulwoods Rents in Holborne, for the benefit of Grayes Inn,
and Purpoole Lane for their outlet, and the fourth to be in Mountague Close for
their Summer house.

Item, I give and bequeath all that piece of ground lying between the trees in
the Inner Temple on the East side to be a Summer walk for Gentlemen of that
Profession for ever.

Item, I give and bequeath unto the said Professors, the long Wooden Gallery
extending over the Middle Temple Lane going toward the Water side, to be their
Winter retyring place for ever.

Item, I likewise bequeath my whole share of the Moytie of the late Project,
for pickling of Pilchers Westward toward the repairing of the said Gallery now
much decayed, and for the glasing of the said Windows there, that the
Sisiphonian heads of our Projectors be not endammaged by reason of the cold,
and so their Designs become ayrie and unprofitable.

Provided always, that if any of them shall be heard to talk of any less
some of money then thousands in either of the said places, they forthwith lose
the benefit of this present Legacy.

Item, I further bequeath unto the said Professors, and their successors the
whole profit that shall arise and acrew in and by the late invention of the sole
making and erecting certain profitable Stoves for roasting, baking, boiling of
all meats, and drying of Malt without sight of fire, or touch of smoke,
whereby the food is not corrupted, and the liquor so much more subtle for and
toward the staying of their sharp stomachs before dinner time, upon this
condition, that their morning meeting for this purpose shall be at the Welsh
Ordinary in Chancery Lane, and their diet no other then what shall be cooked,
and dressed by the said invention that their wits may be refined, and so exceed
ordinary capacities.

Item, I give and bequeath unto the Saltpeter men aforesaid my little Tenement
by the Ducking Ponds to be their Worke-house for ever.

Item, I give and bequeath unto the Professors aforesaid all my Instruments and
Tools Permanent, and Transient, both Plegnicke, Lenicke, and Caminicke, as
Presses, Vices, Screwes, Bellows, Tongues, Moulds, Dryers, Rammers, and all my
Instruments, whatsoever, with their and every of their appurtnances which are
at my Workehouse at Isllington Highbury, or elsewhere within these his
Majesty's Realms and Dominions of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales.

Item, I give and bequeath unto my brethren the Brokers of London my whole
standing Wardrobe, in hope that they will Register this deed, and for the
Donators sake for ever observe the Vigils of Saint Hugh.

His Funeral I will pass over as not worth speaking of, only I will bestow
an Epitaph on him, which is the last point of service that I can do him.

And may this Story many Ages after,
For loss of our Projector move much laughter.
FINIS.
EPITAPH.
REader if thou feign would know
who lies here entombed below,
Know it is one who in his time
the Commonwealth strived to refine:
All Trades now used seemed to him toys
as if they had been devised by boys;
He had such ways to mend the same
That got him an admired name
With many friends and riches store
yet for all this he died poor.
All you therefore that this way pass
and cast your eye upon these lines
Lament our brave Projectors loss,
who has not left his like behind;
For here he lies got wealth and lands
that now wants strength to stir his hands.
And here believe it he has found,
after many a weary look
A parcel of concealed ground,
never came in Tippers Book,
Let him have this little quillet,
for his Worms, and he will fill it.
T. B.
