News from Ireland the twelfth of March.
LOving Brother I have sent you what I now received from Tredath from a worthy
Minister, Deane Barnard, and need to doubt of the truth of it, and indeed you
need truth to be sent to you, for such a multitude of lying Pamphlets you have
daily Printed of our proceedings in Ireland as it is a shame to see, and much
spoken against such vile untruths; which is to be wondered at that are untrue,
in neither place nor time, nor men. Our Dublin Army is still abroad, but we
hear well of them.

An Abstract of such News as has falen out from Feb. 26 to March the 5, being
the day the siege ended.
NO sooner were the vessels that came from Dublin to relieve us unlanded, but a
fair North-west wind served them for their return, where Feb. 26 as they
passed over our Bar in the sight, but beyond the reach of our envious enemy,
our Governor the same afternoon issued out with 220 foot and a 120 horse,
and having pilaged a certain village of the Rebels called Beauly, about a mile
of us, and burnt up their lodgings, he proceeded farther to Smithstowne, where
being informed by his Scouts, of 5 Companies there ready to receive him, he had
the more mind to them and his men by their former good success, needing little
invitation, he drew up to them, who no sooner felt the smart of our shot, but
they instantly broke, and by the prosecution of our horse every man cast away
their Arms to save their lives, nay, their very clothes for their greater
speed of flight, so there were slain about 300 of them, 2 Colors taken, and
about a 100 Cowes brought in, so many were slain in the river of Iellingstowne
that the water was dyed with their blood, wherein a part of Divine justice was
observed, that this slaughter should be in the same place they had formerly so
fraudulently defeated some of ours, in which it is conceived and even repaired,
and wherein some of the same Captains of ours that were formerly rooted had
their hands in this revenge in Epshall, Sir Patrick Weismes. Here Colonel
Preston was hard put to it, who for have lost his rich military Belt and a
Portmantle of his best clothes left behind, which fell out to be the booty of
Horsbey, in the pocket of whose breaches were found 3 Letters of more worth
then his head, whereby 2 Lords with others not far from us, were by these
found as deep in his rebellion as himself.

The next morning it was thought good to prosecute this unexpected victory as
probability of raising the siege on that side, before these could gather any
head again, and so very early by the break of day 600 foot and a Troop of
horse, after we had by prayers commend them to Gods protection, which in the
greatest expedition was sildome omited, marched out under my Lord Moors
command, but the first Castle viz. Stranine, which beyond their former
resolution, they thought to visit, but in the way within half a mile of us,
was so entrenched and fortified, that it proved more difficult then was
expected, yet our men drew up and bestowed about 1000 shots on them, to the
death of many of them, but by the fall of a mighty rain whereby their matches
were near wasted out, they were compelled to return; yet some were sent to the
next village called Colpe, pilaged the Corn remaining, and burnt their
Cabbins, and so came well in by Church time, to give God thanks for his great
preservation, that in all that eminent dangers, we had not a man lost, and
indeed, all this our siege not above 12 men have we lost by the enemy, the rest
that dyed were by famine and other diseases, besides some unarmed men or women
and children, that going out to pilage were killed by the enemy basely; but
this foren^med Castle, was for prevention of our taking of it, maned by the
enemy, with 400 men more then what was yet, hearing of our resolution and
preparation against it, they abandoned it of themselves, and left it to our
possession.

After one days rest, March the first, my Lord Moore and the Governor went out
again the same way, a convenient number of horse and foot; when after securing
of at least 200 worth of Corn, and the burning of what had remained of the
former days work at Colpe, these advanced further, their first resistants was
2 Companies of the Rebels, who abode something without shot, but came in and
shot, and then betook themselves to flight, and one Captain and 60 others
were slain, and another Captain Neal O Neale taken prisoner, and the Castle
of Colpei after much hazard of such as first entered it by the pikes and stones
by them within, whereby our men were 3 or 4 times beaten back down the narrow
stairs, yet at last were all slain, and all that day without the loss of one
of ours, there was a Captain taken prisoner, with whom were found many Letters,
and a Petition subscribed to Sir Phil. O Neal, with the Title of Earl of
Tirons, and General of Ireland, but yet the foundation upon which all these
ayrie honors were built, was the condition of taking this our City, but that
day his Excellency was much humbled, who unknown to us was stolen over the
river, and by our unexpected approach being in fear of taking, crept into a
^ur-bush, and so lay like a trembling Hare in his form till the evening not
far from us.

March the 3. some other sorces marched out in the morning, as far as
Marlingstowne, about three miles from us, whereby the former fights, they found
the Town abandoned, so that their whole work that day was to reap what was
left, for which all Soldiers were that day permitted to go out for Pilage; by
which means the Spring seemed to be Harvest, and the vernall Aequinoctiall to
have been mistaken for the natural Autumnall, such a world of Corn like
mowing Haggards came into our City, the greatest scarcity we had was of Malt,
for which we had for seven days before drunk water, but now such was Gods
goodness, that on a sudden, from the extremity of want was turned to as
plenty; such a plenty, not to be thought, which caused our Enemies to begin to
be so sick, that they for envy left their houses in the midst of this our
joy, but we had like to have had a rule by a Gabard of Powder, that run a
ground on the river, but by our men's watching till ten a clock at night, that
was prevented in the evening tide.

But March the 5. was a Memorable day with us indeed, when 400. Foot and 80.
Horse marched out under the command of the Lord Moore, on the the north side
among his own tenants to Talloglland, where Colonel Mac Byan, with his
companies have been billetted and were unknown to us, the night before upon
some mischiefvous counsel, the whole fraturnity of the Rebels had cropped Sir
Phi. O Neale being President, there appeared 80. Coullers, and in view 3. for
one of ours they had entrenched and fortyfied in a place of the Town, but our
men declined them not, but with as much alacrity as there commands could wish,
drew up boldly and gave fire so thick and sure, that after the Rebels had
replied to three or four files of shot, and finding so many droopping among
them, they betook themselves to their fast refuge their heels, about 300. of
the common soldiers, and not less then 30. Officers slain in the place, and
a great man made by themselves, Baron of Monghun, Art Rore Mac Maughan by name,
whose head is voted in the Proclamation Printed in Dublin and is taken
prisoner; who being wounded to show his invitable end, politickly stripped
himself starkenaked, and lay as dead among the slain; but by the viewing of
the body by Captain Berone, and tumbling the body about was discovered, and
promised upon his faith given, that he would cause the redemption of my Lady
Blainy and her children, and we think is accordingly done. Which happy
exchange, we daily seek for a 115. Muskquets were taken by us, and all the
ground was covered with their Pikes, chaste away in their flight, in the mean
time our Governor Sir Henry, issued out toward Beauly, to provoake Sir Phi. O
Neale, whom we supposed had kept that lodging still, burnt New-Towne under his
nose, drew two companies to fight in the Castle, and returning, intending the
assistance to the Lord Moore if there were need, but by firing all the Towns
thereabouts, they soon perceived a victory on the Lord Moors side, in this
the Lord Moore behaved himself most valiently, beyond all expression, and to
so great a hazard of his person, more then pleased his Friends: had his Boot
cut through his stocking with a Sword, and another hurt his Horse with a Pike,
in the midst of all the danger of shot on every side, it came off without other
harm; and which has been Gods wonderful preservation, nay all this hosts
flight and prosecution for two miles about, not one man of ours so much as
hurt, Sir Phi. O Neale, with the rest of there great commanders, having thus
paid their way, fled very meanly attended, leaving such other Gentlemen behind
to their miserable condition, which they did deservedly approve, and all their
army hopes spoiled which they by him persuaded to, in this hour lighted my
Lord Moore, who was the first that gave us assistance at first, so he was the
last that chased them away in their troops, dispersing the first of which he
gave to appear that evening, when some of the English escaping from them,
brought news, that the two Castles Beauly and Strainus, being wholly forsaken
by them, into which our Governor presently sent some Companies who entered
peaceably, and with some horse, roved the Country toward Termonsecking, but
found not a man of them, only a world of Corn, which the Enemy could not fire
for fear, so that now our gates are now opening, and City silling with
provision and other boot, all the Country a far off desiring to be admitted to
our Market, all hearts rejoicing, every street ringing with praises to God, the
Donor to whom only it does belong, and that not only patiently, but publicly
and solemnly, we fail not thankefully to acknowledge.

LOving Brother, my last to you was by a Friend Doctor Jones, in which I
declared to you what befell us since my last Letter by the Post; which was,
that out of Munster we had news, that the Lord President joining with some
150. English for us, arrived there lately, and that they had battle with the
Enemy being a great number, led by the Lord Mongarret, our men killed 1000. and
put the rest to flight, the Lord Mongarret hardly escaping. We had news that
Galway is out, but there is a fort by us commanded, which stands greatly to the
disadvantage of the Town; some hot blows have been between the Town and
Fort, but with much damage to the Town, on the 7 of this month went out some
of our Army, about 3000 foot and 600 horse^, and went to many places where the
enemy was reported to have been, but the enemy still run away before them,
what their intent is for it is not known, but our Army is still out, and
yesterday they sent in one Lieut. Colonel Read that they took of the enemy,
and Captain Burfoot we had yesterday captives, some three come from Tredath
who confirm the news which we heard before, that they had given the enemy a
great defeat, killed about 300 and 40 Officers of the enemy, the rest fled
being a great number, curs but 700, they no less then 3000, upon this the
enemy has quite raised the siege about the City, and they have an indiferent
Market again, the much comfort of the distressed Soldiers: the enemy is very
dog-hearted, every day more then other, or appear so to be, and many are
reported to desire to come in, now they have done what mischief they can
already: we have news here, that many under write to give so much money with
you to the war, and to receive it in land, at a rate set down, which if it be
true, as it is in Print, none can lay out money at better rate, it will be to
great and shortly, and the land is as good as in England, and the seats as
excellent, if you have a 100 or 200 of pounds, to under writ in this cause, and
that you can be sure of land, as it is here declared, it would be much profit;
the Irish are mad to see their lands so proffered. There is news come in this
morning to us from our Army, that the Lords of the Pale some of them offer
themselves to come in now.

FINIS.
