A brief description of the particular things contained in this Almanac
examplary.
IN this Almanac, the twelve months are contained in 12 pages, each page is
divided into 8 Columns.

In the First is placed the days of the month. The second, the days of the
week. The third contains the fixed and movable spheres: the beginnings and
endings of the Terms: the Aspects of the Planets with the Moon, and mutually
with themselves and the Moon in her Apogaeon Perigaeon. The fourth, shows the
place of the Moon in signs, degrees, and minutes. The fifth, shows the place
of the Sun in signs, degrees, and minutes. The sixth, shows the places of the
Planets every fifth day at noon. The seventh, shows the time of Sun rising
every day in the month. The eighth, shows the time of Sun setting every day
in the month. Example.

The 19 day of Jan. being Wednesday, Saturn is in Biquintile of Venus, or an
aspect of distance 4 signs, 24 degrees: on the 15 day Jupiter is Semisextile to
Venus, in the 9 day the Moon is in her Apogaeon, and the 31 of Jan. Saturn is
in Conjunction with the Moon; the Moons place is 2 degr. 18. min. in Leo: place
of the Sun is 22 degr. 23 min. in Aquarius: Saturn is that day 8 degrees 28
min. in Leo.

How to find the true place of any of the Planets for any day that be
intermediated by taking the difference betwixt the two days before and after
the time assigned. Example.

I would know the true place of Jupiter the 6 day of Jan. I find Jupiter on the
2 day to be 24 day 14 min. of and on the 7 day I find him in 25 day 24 m. of
direct, the difference is 1 day 10 min. to find his true place on the 6 day,
then say by the rule of 3. if 4 days motion give 70 min. what shall 3 days
motion give, multiply and divide, and you shall find 52 min. 30 sec. the which
add to 24 d. 14 min. and it will be 25 d. 6 min. 30 sec. the true place of
Jupiter on the 6 day of Jan. The like may be said for any other time, and for
any other Planet. Behold the work, ^

IACKSON. 1653.

A Prognostication gathered from the Suns Ingresses, together with
Astronomicall Solar propositions wherein is 28. operations Illustrated by
examples.

Whereunto is annexed the manner how to calculate an Eclipse of Sun or Moon
for any place assigned for any time past, present, or to come.

And finished with the Proportional bodies of the Spheres one to another, and
the distance of the Planets among themselves and with the firmament.

By THOMAS JACKSON, Mathematician.

Printed at London by W. Wilson for the Company of Stationers. 1653.

The Month, Day, Hour, and Minute of the Suns Ingress, or the Suns Entrance
into the four Cardinal Signs this present year 1653.
THe Cardinal Signs are, Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capriorn; being as it were the
hinges on which the year bangeth. The first Quarter is the Spring, enters with
the Sign of Aries, to whose first minute the Sun comes this year on the 10 day
of March 5 min. past 2 a clock in the morning.

The next Quarter is Summer, the Cardinal Sign is Cancer, the beginning of
Summer is the 11 day of June, 10 min. past 5 a clock in the morning.

Autumn, or Harvest, begins Libra the 12 day of September at 8 a clock at
night.

Winter takes his beginning Capricorn the 11 day of December, half an hour
past 7 in the morning.

Of the Eclipses happening this year 1653.
THis year there will be four Eclipses, two of the Sun, and two of the Moon, of
which there will be but one visible in our horizon, and it will happen the 4
day of March, 49 minutes past 1 in the morning, and ends 57 minutes past 5 in
the morning; so that the total duration will be 4 hours 8 minutes: The digits
eclipsed is 18.43 minutes.

I here omit the other three Eclipses, of which the effects will not happen in
and about England; as for our Eclipse the 4 of March before mentioned, the
effects will happen in June ensuing; on which time is the height of the effects
of that Eclipse happened on the 29 day of March 1652. And for which time to
portend the contingencies, or more plainly to foretell what accidents may
happen to sublunary bodies, I must have recourse to the Solar Eclipse happened
March 29 day 1652, for that Eclipse will oversway, predominate, and have
dominion over this Lunar Eclipse, so the portendation^; there will be much
arrogancy about the Eastern parts from London, pestilent fevers, the death of
great men, men of power, much rapine, theft, plundring, house burnings, death
of cattle, etc.

A short discovery of this present year 1653, gathered from the position of
the Heavens at the Suns ingress of the four Cardinal Signs.
NOt using* novilunium postventionale vel perventionale in vernum aestivum and
autumni hibernium, but the vernall Ingress of the Sun with the other
ingressions of the Cardinal Signs.

Haly says, Major tamen potentia, etc. The greatest power in signification of
the accidents of the year is over given unto the Lord of the Ascende^^, etc.
For confirmation of my judgment herein, in this Revolution is, as, viz.

astrological chart in Martii 9 die. 14. hora. 5. min. die hora ad ad ad ad ad
ad




Jupiter is Lord of the ascendent posited in the second house, the cusp of the
ascendent is possessed with common sign the Lord thereof in a fixed sign, and
in a succedent house, and he being a weighty Planet these testimonies do
signify that this Suns vernal Ingress that predictions may be portended
throughout the Revolution Furthermore consider, that the next Quarter the Sun
enters the 11 of June 5 a clock, and 10 minutes past noon, then is Jupiter Lord
of the Ascendent as he is in this Quarter; and in Autumn he has his triplicity
in the Ascendent; and when the Sun enters the Winter Quarter Jupiter is Lord of
the Ascendent; to which I conclude, Jupiter is Almutan of the year, and makes
Venus Cosignificator.

Si ascendit Sagitarius, solicitabitur circae aedificationes: I say, Sagitarius
being the Sign ascending, signifies men will much delight to build, etc.

Jupiter Lord of the Ascendent signifies, as, viz. Si Jupiter ascendentis
Dominus eum intueatur felici radio, bonam fortunam, sanitatem, gaudium, and
lucra, hominibus inprimis religiosis and honoratis, and extruentur Ecclesiae
and oratoria, appetuntque homines studia sapientiae and legum. That is to say,
If Jupiter be Lord of the Ascendent (as now he is) he denotes much prosperity
and happiness, good fortune, health, soundness, good state of wit and memory,
many glad tidings and riches, men and women subject to humanity, religion, for
reputation and honor, to magnify our Redeemer in many private assemblies, men
much desire to read, and study after wisdom.

The Lord of the Ascendent being posited in the second house signifies, as viz.
Felix promittit, lucra multa, vitam speciosam: Here is promise of much riches
and happiness, and to live a godly life. Venus being in the second house
signifies, Fertilitatem and uberem proventum frugura, item affluentem and
liberalem vitem. Yet I see more happiness portended by the Moon her application
to the two fortunes* to wit the Lord of the Ascendent* and his Lady, which is
Venus by name* for the Moon is in conjunction with Jupiter on March 15 day at 2
a clock in the morning, Venus with the Moon on the 17 day at 5 in the morning;
so that the first Planet the Moon applies to, after the Suns vernal ingress, is
Jupiter the Lord of the Ascendent, next Venus, then Mercury; see what Origanus
says in such a matter; In anni and quarturum revolutionibus, aut thematibus
lunationum, si luna sive firma, etc. potens, sit in angulo, vel succedente domo
dignitatibus, sive debilis and cadens extra dignitates, applicuerit benefico
alicui planeti Jovi vel Veneri, significabitur status populi fortunatus, quo
lucra eidem accrescent, and abundabunt necessariae; vigebitque, si applicuerit
Jovi, justitia, pax, libertas; si Veneri erit hilaritas, gaudium, frequentia
connubiorum: In the Revolutions of the year, and of the quarterly Ingresses, or
in the Theams of the several Lunations, if the Moon, whether she be strong and
potent in an Angle or succedent house, and in her own dignities, or if she be
in weak and cadent without her dignities, and shall apply to any benevolent
Planet, viz. Jupiter or Venus, it signifies the state and condition of the
people to be fortunate, whereby they shall get wealth, and have abundance of
all necessaries; and if this application be to Jupiter, justice, peace, and
liberty, shall flourish; If to Venus, there shall be mirth, joy, and many
marriages; these are significations of double joys, but the Eclipse of the Sun
happening in the year 1652. 29 day of March will single the joys.

Jupiter with Venus does signify, Agunt quidem juxta naturam fortioris in
themate, in genere vero serenitatem afferunt; in aqueis vero locis mites and
lenes pluvias, and hoc certius si lunae testimonium radio vel accesserit.

You may behold in this Table, that when the Suns place is in the first point
of Cancer, his Meridian height will be 62 degrees, in Gemini is 58 degrees. 28 min.
in Leo is the same degrees and minutes.

Suppose that when the Sun is in the first point of Aries or Libra, and you
find the height of the Sun taken by the quadrant to be 38 degrees. 30 min. and you
would desire to know what a clock it is at that time, look in the foregoing
Table under the Signs Aries and Libra, and you will find in the column under
the title before and after noon to be 12. then you may conclude it is high noon.

Had it been that the Sun was but 36 degrees. 56 min. high that day, then you may
conclude to be a 11 of the clock, if it be in the aforenoon; if it be in the
afternoon it is 1 a clock.

Suppose you had observed the Sun to be 26 degrees, and 8 min. high in the same
day, then it is 9 of the clock, if your observation be in the morning, but if
it be in the afternoon, then it is 3 a clock, and so with the rest. At any time
when the Sun is far remote from the first point of any Sign, take the
proportional part, and the like for your altitude taken, when it will not
concur with the altitude in the Table, so you will find the Suns altitude above
the horizon at any time.

The use of this Table.
This Table consists of 5 Columns, the first and last contain the degrees of
the Signs that are placed in the head or foot thereof, that if you find the
sign that the Sun is in at the head or foot of the Table, and the degrees in
the first or last Column thereof, then at the intersection you will have the
Suns declination.

Example.
Let the Suns place be 20 degrees in Taurus or Scorpio, to find the Suns
declination, you must find Taurus or Scorpio in the head of the Table, and 20
degrees on the first Column, then guide your eye from til you come against 20
degr. there you shall find 17 degr. and 48 m. the Suns declination when he is
20 degrees. in or.

Note if you find the Sign in the foot of the Table, you must find the degrees
in the last Column.

This Table is of much excellency for the calculating of diverse propositions
Astronomical; for it being one of the three terms given in most Solar
propositions, as viz.

Let the declination of the Sun, elevation of the Pole, and Suns almicanter be
given, by which you shall find viz. The Suns meridian height. The Suns place
in the ecliptique. The length of the day and night. The hour of East and West.
The Azimuth of 6 a clock. The Suns Azimuth. The right Ascension. The oblique
Ascension. The oblique Descension The Ascensional difference. The Amplitude.
The Semidiurnal arch.


Example with Illustrations.

Let there be given the Suns declination 20 degrees, and 14 m. then the suns
place will be the first point of Gemini.

Let there be given the elevation of the Pole 51 degrees 32 min.

Let there be given the Suns Almicanter 49 degrees. which will stand as viz. North
Declination 20 degrees 14 min. given. North Elevation 51 degrees. 51 min given. North
Almicanter 49 degrees 00 min. given.


The first operation to find the Suns amplitude say, As the complment of the
elevation of Pole 38 degrees. 28 m. 9.79383 To the Suns declination 20 d. 14 m.
9.53888 So is the Radius 50 d. 10.00000 To the amplitude 33 d. 47 m. 9.74505


The second operation to find the ascensional difference say, As Radius 90 d.
10.00000 to the amplitude 33 d. 47 9.74511 so is the elevation of the Pole 51
d. 32 m. 9.89383 25 d. 48 m. to the ascensional difference upon a great circle
9.63885 Then substract the declination from 90 and the remainder will be 69 d.
46 m.
then say If 69 d. 46 m. upon a great circle 9 97233 will become 90 d. upon a
little circle 10.00000 what will 25 d. 48 m. upon a great circle 9.63871 it
will give the ascensional difference 27 d. 38 m. a little circle 966668
this 27 d. 38 m. converted into time will be 1 hour 50 min. so long time the
Sun has been above the horizon before 6 a clok.

The fourth operation is to find the Suns almic^nter at 6 a clock, say As
Radius 90 d. 10.00000 to the Suns declination 20 d. 14 m. 953888 so is the
elevation of the Pole 51 d. 32 m. 989374 to the almicanter at 6 a clock 15 d.
43 m. 943262


The fifth operation is to find when the Sun will be East and West, say then, As
the elevation of the Pole 51 d. 32 m. 9.89374 to the suns declination 20 d 14
m. 9.53888 so is the complement of the elevation of Pole 9.79383 to the
distance of the suns way from 6 a clock to East in a great circle 15. d. 56 m.
9.43897
then substract the declination from Radius, and the remainder will be 69 d. 46
m. then say, As 69 d. 46 m. upon a great circle 9.97233 will give 90 d. upon a
little circle 10.00000 what will 15 d. 56 m. upon a great circle 943857 it will
give 17 d. 1 m. upon a little circle 946624
this 17 d. 1 m. being converted into time will be 1 hour 8 m. so long time
will the sun be after 6 a clock before he come to be full East, and at night he
will be full West 1 hour 8 m before 6 a clock

The seventh operation is to find the difference of the Almicant^r given 49 d.
and almicanter found at 6 a clock. which difference is found by the natural
signs, as viz. The sign of the almicanter given 49 d. 754790 The sign of the
almicanter of 6 a clock 15.43. 270880 The difference of the almicanters 28.56.
483829


The eighth operation is to find how far the sun has swerved from 6 a clock,
whereby to know the hour of the day, say then As the difference of the
almicanters 28 d. 56 m. 9.86374 to the complement of the elevation of the Pole
38 d. 28 m. 9.79383 so is the Radius 90 d. 10.00000 to the distance the sun
swerved from 6 a clock upon a great circle 50 d. 55 m. 898991
then substract the suns declination from radius, then say in the ninth
operation If 69 d. 46 m. upon a great circle 997233 will become 90 d. upon a
little circle 10 00000 what will 50 d. 55 m. great circle become? 988999 which
is 55 d. 49 m. a little circle 991766
this 55 d. 49 m. being converted into time will be 3 hours 43 m. which being
added to 6 a clock, it will be 9.43* that is to say, 9 a clock 43 m. after when
the suns almic^^. was 49. degrees.

The tenth operation is to find the Suns almicanter when he is East or West,
say As the elevation of the Pole 51 d. 32 m. to the Suns amplitude 33 d. 47 m.
so is the complement of the elevation 38 d. 28 m. to the suns almicanter at
Last or West 26 d. 13 m. which take from the almicanter given 49 d. by the
natural signs, as viz. The almicanter of 49 d. 00 m. 75470 The almicanter of 26
d. 13 m. 441766 The remainder is 18.14. 312943



Which is the almicanter made since the sun came from East.

The twelfth operation is to find the suns azimuth, say As the complement of
the elevation of the Pole 38 d. 28 m. is to the almicanter since the sun came
from East 18 d. 14 m. so is the elevation of the Pole 51 d. 32 m, to the suns
azimuth upon a great circle 23 d. 11 m. then substract 49 the almicanter given
from radius, the remainder will be 41 degrees.

In the thirteen^h operation say, If 41 d. upon a great circle 9.81694 will
become 90 d. upon a little circle 10.00000 what will 23 d. 11 m. upon a great
circle 9.59513 it will be the suns azimuth 36 d. 52 m. 9.77819


The fourteenth operation to find the suns place, as viz. As the suns greatest
declination 23 d 31 m. 960099 to the declination in the point of the ecliptique
20 d. 1 m. 953880 so is radius 90 d. 10.000000 to the suns place 60 d* or 993789


The fifteenth operation, find the Suns right ascension, as viz. As Radius 90
d. 10.00000 to the tangent of the suns place 60 d. 10.23856 so the cosign of
the suns greatest declination 23 d. 31 m. 9.96234 to the tangent of the suns
right ascension 57 d. 48 m. 10.20090


To find the suns oblique ascension being he is in the Northern signs,
substract the ascensional difference 27 d. 38 m. which is found in the second
operation from the suns right ascension 57 d. 48 m. and the remainder is 30 d.
10 m. which is the suns oblique ascension.

If the sun be in Southern signs add.

To find the suns oblique descension the sun being in the Northern signs add
the ascensional difference to the right ascension, and it will give 85 d. 26 m.
the suns oblique descension.

If the suns declination had been South you must then substract.

To find the sun rising and setting, the length of the day and night.

To know the sun rising look in the second operation, where is the ascensional
difference converted into time, which is 1 hour 50 m. that take from 6 a clock
which will be the remainder 4.10. that is to say, at 4 a clock ten min. after
the sun will rise, which double will be 8 h. 20 m. the length of the night.

To find the sun setting add 1 h. 50 m. to 6 a clock, and it will be 7 a clock
50 m. after; which being doubled, is 15 h. 40 m. the length of the day.

The Illustrated operations stands thus.

How to calculate the Eclipse both Solar and Lunar for any place assigned, for
any time past, present, or to come.
IT is required to know if the Moon will be Eclipsed in February 1663: and if
she be, the quantity and duration.

Place assigned.

Calculated for the Town of Litterworth in Leicestershire, whose Latitude is 52
degrees. 36 min. and the Meridian differs from London 4 minutes.

To know if the Moon will be Eclipsed that month and year, first I find the
opposition of the Sun and Moon that time as thus.

The middle motion of

This distance reduced into time, will be the true opposition of the Sun and
Moon according to there middle motion, as, viz.

The distance of the Moon from opposition of the Sun is ^

So that the mean opposition of the Sun and Moon in that year and month will
happen 11 day, 21 hours, 26 min. 13 seconds p.m.

To find the true opposition of the Sun and Moon, I calculate to the time of
the mean opposition the true place of the Sun and Moon, as, viz.

The Moons place 5.7.6.26

The difference of Sun and Moons places I divide by the hourly motion of the
Moon from the Sun, and remainder will be the intervall of time, that is to say,
the time between the mean and true opposition of the Sun and Moon 6 hours, 27
min. 13 sec. and in regard the Moons place exceeds the Suns place in
opposition, I substract the interval of time from the mean opposition* as, viz.

The mean opposition in Anno 1663 in Febr. is 11 days, 2 hours, 30 min. 13
seconds, out of which substract the interval of time 6 hours, 27 min. 13 sec.
and remainder is, 11 days, 15 hours, 3 minutes, 00 sec. with which corrected
time I compute and examine the Sun and Moons places for the true opposition,

I conclude, in the aforesaid year, month, day, hour, minute, The Sun and Moon
will be in opposition; for the Suns true place will be Pisces, 3 degrees. 39 min. 1
sec. and the Moons true place will be Virgo 13 degrees. 39 min. 1 sec.

To find if the Moon will be eclipsed or not.

If at any time the mean full Moon her place be distant from either of her nodes
less than 15 degrees 12 minutes, either according, or contrary to the
Succession of the Signs, that full Moon will suffer an eclipse.

Example, at the time of the middle of the full Moon before mentioned, in Febr.
1663. the 11 day 21 hour, 30 min. 13 sec. the middle place of the Moon is 5 s*
7 d. 6 m. 26 se. and her node ascending is 5.1.26.22. So that between the Moons
place and her node, is but 5 degrees. 40 min. 4 sec. So I conclude that full Moon
will be eclipsed.

The apparent time to be found.

I substract the Aequation of civil days 11 hours, 11 min. from the true
opposition, the residue will be the apparent time 14 hours, 52 min. The
horizontal parallex of the 2 m. 21 se. The horizontal parallex of the 57.53.
The hourly motion of the 2.31 The hourly motion of the 33.15 The semidiameter
of the 16.38 The semidiameter of the 16.11 The appatent semidiameter of the
Earths shadow is 43.36 The hourly motion of the from the 30 44
To find how many digits the Moon will be eclipsed.
The semidiameter of the Moon 16.11 And semidiameter of the Earths shadow 43.39
Both added together is 59.47 From which take the latitude 34.56 And the
remainder will be 24.51
the parts deficient.

Then I make my proportional terms, as, viz.

If the Moons diameter 32 min. 22 se. will give 12 dig* What will the parts
deficient give 24 min. 51 se. and the work will be thus Diameter 1942 se.
3288249 Digits 720 m. 2859332 Parts deficient 1491 3173477 Agregate 6030809
2742560

Digits eclipsed is 9 13/60

So I conclude in Anno 1663, Feb. 11 day. 14 hours* 52 min. the quantity of
the Moon will be eclipsed 9 digits, and 13/60 parts of a digit.

To find the minutes and time of incidence, and the half ^^rriance or
continuance of the Moon in the earths shadow, as viz. The sum of the
semidiameters of the Moon and earths shadow being reduced into sec. 3587 m.
The latitude of the Moon 2093 Agregate 5680 difference 1494


Or thus.

The aggregate 5680 3754348 The difference 1494 3174390 Sum 6928738 Minutes of
incidence 48 m. 33 se. half Sum 3464369
Having found 48 m. 33 se. the minutes of incidence and half tarriance together.

Now find only the minutes of half tarriance, as viz. The difference of the
semidiameter of the Moon and earths shadow is 1645 se. The Moons latitude is
2093 The same being added together the sum is 3738 The sum 3738 3.572639 The
difference 448 2.651278 The aggregate 6223917 The sem a^gregate 3131558


Which gives 1294 se. or 21 min. 34 se. the min. of the Moon^ hal tarriance.

To find the time of incidence and half tarriance together.

I divide the minutes of incidence and half tarriance together 48 m. 33 se^ by
the hourly motion of the Moon, for the Sun 30 min. and 44 sec. and the quotient
gives the time of incidence and half tarriance together to be 1 hour, 11 min.
30 sec.

Then I say, that the total duration of the foresaid eclipse will be 2 hours
12 min.

To find how long time the Moon continues in the earths shadow.

In the performance hereof I divide the minutes of the half tarriance* 21 m. 34
se. by the hourly motion, and the quotient will be 31 min. 45 sec. the time of
her half continuance in the shadow.

If you would know the latitude of the Moon at the beginning and end of the
eclipse.

You must take the minutes of incidence and half tarriance together, and add
thereto the middle motion of the Sun agreeing to the time of incidence and half
tarriance, the sum whereof take from the true motion of the Moons latitude at
the time of the middle of the eclipse, and the remainder will be her latitude
at the beginning of the eclipse.

Then do but add the same to the true motion of her latitude at the time of
the middle of the eclipse, and the aggregate will be the true latitude at the
end of the eclipse. This done, you may describe the eclipse in a figure in
plano.
