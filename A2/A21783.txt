An Exemplification of her Majesty's Letters Patent, concerning her Highness
Town and Port of Hasting, in the County of Sussex.
ELizabeth, by the grace of God, Queen of England, France and Ireland,
defender of the faith etc.
To all people to whom these our letters patent shall come, greeting.
Where of our own knowledge and certain science we do understand, that our
Town and Port of Hasting, in our County of Sussex, being the ancient Town
of our Cinque Ports, is situated upon the maine Sea, very near the midst
of a great Bay or open place, lying between two points of the land, which
stretche forth far into the Sea, called the Beachy and the Nasse, distant
each from the other thirty miles, right opposite to the Realm of France,
the ancient enemy of our Country: as we are credibly enfourmed, the same
Town has of long time been a place not only very well inhabited with
warlike people, and greatly replenished with good Mariners and other men meet
and serviceable for our Navy, well stored with Ships, Barks, Crayers, and
Boats, but also sufficiently furnished with Armor, and Artillery of all
sorts, both for Sea and Land: also very meet and commodious for Fishing, and
the Bay plenteously abounding with all sorts of Fish, according to the several
seasons of the year: by reason whereof the same Town has of long time been by
the inhabitants thereof, in time of wars, manfully defended against the
sundry invasions and attempts of the French Nation, our coaste therabouts lying
very open against the French, by them often kept from spoilc. Our Merchants and
loving Subjects, and other Travelers sailing along that coast, have often
times by their Ships, and often times by their harborough, been saved and
rescued from the fury of the enemies, and the tyranny of Pirates: our Navy,
and the Navy of sundry our noble Progenitors. Kings of this Realm, the better
appoimed by reason of their skillful Mariners, and cunning Seamen: Also our
household, our Citizens of London, and our Countries to the said Port
adjoining, greatly benefited by their fishing. And where our said Town has of
long time had a Peer or Harborough made of Timber, and other things set and
placed in the Sea, for the succor of the Seamen, and defense of their Ships,
Barks, Crayers and Boats, against the great rage and fury of the Sea, which
has bin always mainteyned at the great and importable charges of the
inhabitants of our said Town of Hasting, until of late time the same Peer
or Harborough was at a sudden, by the great violence and extreme rage of the
Sea, broken down and carried away: sithence which time the Town is much
decayed, the traffic of Merchants thither forsaken, the fisshing, by reason
of the dangerous landing* little used, the rich and wealthy men gone thence,
and the poor men yet remaining would gladly do the like, if without offense
of our laws they might be elsewhere received, whereby our people are likely to
perish, and our said Port likely to be subverted and become desolate, or else
the people there by necessity driven to commit great and heinous offenses, to
the great hinderance of the public weal, unless some speedy remedy be for
them provided. And where we be informed by diverse of our privy Counsel and
Nobility, and by diverse Artificers very cunning and skilful in that kind of
faculty, that a very good Haven or Rhoade, for the arriving and sauegard of
Ships, Barks, Crayers and Boats, may nere unto the said Port with no great
charge be made, to the great relief of the inhabitants, and of all Merchants
and travelers sailing along the narrow Seas, and to the strength of our said
Coaste: and that the Inhabitants of our said Port be ready and willing to
bestow their lands, goods, and labors, to the uttermost of their power, to
accomplish the same: notwithstanding of themselves very unable to finish so
great a work, likely as it is thought to amou^t unto the sum of four
thousand pounds. We therefore considering the premises, and minding to
provide for the preservation of our people, the maintenance of our Navy and
Town, for the defense of our Coaste, and of Merchants and travelers, and that
the provision of our householde, our City and Country be not diminished, at
the humble suit of our Bailife, Iurates, and Comminaltie of our said Town of
Hasting, do by these our letters Patents not only give and grant unto our
said Bailife, Iurates, and Comminaltie, full power and authority, to make
new, and finishe one Haven, in such place or places nere unto our said Town
and Port, as to them shall seem most convenient, and to the finishing and
accomplishing thereof, yield our Royal assent and consent: but also for the
furtherance and better helping forth of the same, we do commed the same good
and laudable intent and purpose, to the charitable and liberal contribucion
and benevolence of all and singular our loving subjects dwelling within any our
Realms and Dominions, that the rather for our recommendation, the more
liberal contribucion by our said Subjects may be yielded to the finishing of
the said Haven, a work te^ding much to the defense of our Realms, and to the
profit of the common wealth of the same, and which will be cause to avoid many
great inconveniences that may ensue by the neglecting thereof: and also be au
evident declaration of the forward and willing minds of all our loving
Subjects, to augment the prosperity of our Realms and Countries. We of our
special grace, certain knowledge, and mere mocion, have given and granted,
and by these our letters Patent, do give and grant full license, permission,

Gentleman, and to every of them, and to all and every other person or persons
that shall be thereunto deputed and assigned by them, or by any two of them, by

collect, and take of all manner of persons whatsoever, Spiritual or Temporal,
English borne or Strangers, in all places, as well within liberties as
