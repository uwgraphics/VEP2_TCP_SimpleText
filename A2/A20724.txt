AN APOSTOLICAL Injunction for Unity and Peace.

Or, a Sermon Preached by George Downame Master of Arts of Christ's College in
Cambridge, to the Parishioners of Saint Stephens in Walbrooke, at his departure
from them.

1 Cor. 1. Verse 10. I beseech you Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no division among
you: but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the
same judgment.

LONDON: Printed by I. Oaks dwelling in little S. Bartholmews. 1639.

TO THE RIGHT Honorable, my very good Lord and Patron, Edward Lord Newburgh,
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, one of his Majesty's most Honorable
Privy Counsel. And to his Religious and Virtuous Lady, all Peace and
Happiness.
Right Honorable:
PArdon (I beseech You) my boldness, in presuming to present your Lordship
with such a mite, as not being a brag of my ability, but a Testimony of my
loyalty and gratefulness to your Honor, to whom I owe my self. And if your
Lordship shall be pleased to accept these first Fruits of my labors in this
kind, as a testimony, how much I deservedly honor You; let the World
Paraphrase upon me what it will: for where I owe a just Service, I had rather
undergo the Censure of vainglory, by being too forward in hasting to the
Press; than unthankfulness to Your Honor, to whom I am so deeply obliged by
Your noble Favors. My Lord, this is a Sermon Preached at my departure from the
Parish of St. Stephens Wall-brooke, where I lived and labored in another man's
field, for the Inning of his Harvest, till it pleased your Lordship out of your
most undeserved Grace and Favor, to Present me to a Living of greater value,
and more certainty, in respect of my own Propriety and independent Interest;
whither now (by Gods assistance) I am hasting: Only I make bold, before I go,
humbly to entreat your Lordships Patronage of this weak Work; hoping that
the Time will come, when I may present unto your Lordships view, some Thing of
greater weight and worth. In the mean while, humbly desiring pardon for this
my bold intrusion on your Honor, I commend your Lordship with your virtuous
Consort to the Lord of Lords, wishing you the Glory of both Ages: which shall be
the daily Prayer, of

Your most Humble Servant and most Thankful Beneficiary George Downame.

AN Apostolical Injunction for Unity and Peace.
2 CORINTHIANS. 13.11. Finally, Brethren, farewell; be perfect, be of good comfort,
be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you.


IN these words the Apostle St. Paul takes his leave of the Corinthians, The
division.
whom he intitles Brethren: finally, Brethren farewell; yet ere he leaves them,
he admonishes them of certain duties to be performed, which are in number
four: First, Be perfect. Secondly, be of good comfort. Thirdly, be of one
mind. Fourthly, live in peace.
Upon the performance whereof, he annexeth a promise of Gods blessing upon
them, in those words; And the God of love and peace shall be with you.

First, in taking of his leave, he uses his usual word, Finally, the word in
the original is, (...), which is expounded two ways,

First, postremo, lastly. Secondly, quod superest, or quod reliquum est, for
that which remains.

Finally.
First, it is taken for lastly, and so it may be taken here. Saint Paul
concluding his Epistle, says Finally, lastly, to conclude. But I will rather
follow Oecumenius, Oecum. i^ locum.
who takes it the second way, for quod superest, or that which yet remains:
quasi diceret, (says he) as if he should say, postquam ego quod meum est,
feci, hoc est, consilium dedi ac minatus sum, reliquum est, ut and vos, quae
vestra sunt, confera^is: After that I have performed my duty, in admonishing
and threatening you, it remaynes that you also do your duty in obeying that
doctrine that I have delivered you.

In vain do the Ministers of Gods Word cry aloud, and lift up their voices
like trumpets in preaching to you, except you also do conform your selves in
obedience to what is taught you. God requires of you knowledge and
sanctification, according to the measure of means, that He has afforded you:
much, where he has given much, more of those that have means, than, of those
that have none, and more of those where the Gospel of Christ is openly and
freely preached, than of those, who living in times of persecution, have it
only by stealth, and with many difficulties and dangers.

Lord what a measure then of knowledge and sanctification does he require of
us, who live in such a flourishing Church as ours is! where He has planted
the most faithful Ministry; where we have praying without ceasing (some
think too much;) where we have reading the Scriptures without interruption (a
privilege denied unto our neighbors) and where we have preaching without
contradiction. God has planted us like a tree by the rivers of waters. Psalm.
1.3. Luke 13.8.
He has dig'd about us and doung'd us, He has used fair means, and foul
means, and all means possible, to make us fruitful: but what is the end of all
this labor? I am afraid God fails of his expectation, I am afraid that he
looks for more fruit from us, than he is like to find: and I have cause to
fear it, seeing the poor success of all our labor in your practice: for
which of you have attained more knowledge and sanctification than you had ten,
twenty years ago? Which of you have mortified and subdued any sinful
corruption since that time? which of you were covetous then, and are not
covetous still? which of you were slanderers then, and are not slanderers
still? which of you were liars then, and are not liars still? which of you were
swearers then, and are not swearers still? which of you were unchaste,
untemperate, uncharitable, ungodly then, and do not remain so to this very
hour?

Thus, thus is that excellent and honorable calling of the Ministry made most
miserable; whilst we play labor in vain, preaching again and again, this
week and the next, and all the year long, and all to no purpose.

I remember a story of Tyresias the Southsayer. whom, when Juno, (for the
giving his verdict against her) had stricken blind, Jupiter to make him
recompense, gave him the eyes of his mind, and made him a Prophet; then Juno,
inveterately malicious (the fault of most of that sex where they once fall out
with any) being not able to undo, what Jove had done, gave him this curse
withal, that, although he prophesied the truth, yet whatsoever he should say,
it should not be believed. This is just our case: after that we have spent all
our time in the University, in studying the Arts and Sciences, in learning the
tongues, in turning over the Fathers, in searching the Scriptures; in comparing
places together, after all this pains and industry, we may cry out with the
Prophet, Quis credit praedicationi nostrae? Esaias 53.1.
Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

What a partial age is this we live in? men care not what burdens they lay
upon the Ministers backs; they must preach and preach, once, twice a week, or
else they plainly tell them, as Pharaoh told the Israelites, Exodus 5.17. 1 Cor.
9.16.
Desides est is, desides, ye are idle, ye are idle and Woe be to you if you
preach not the Gospel, but what is the end of all this preaching? that is
nothing to them; when we have done, all is done. Thus like Scribes and
Pharisees, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, Matthew. 23.4.
and lay them on our shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one
of their fingers, they teach us our duty, when to preach and how to preach too,
but they will not learn their own to practice what is taught them; they care
not for a quod superest, for a Finally, for any thing to come, they have enough
already.

We Will leave them therefore in their plenty, and proceed to the next thing
considerable, which is the title by which the courteous Apostle salutes the
Corinthians: Brethren.
Brethren, quod superest fratres; Finally, my brethren.

It was well noted by Saint Hierome against Helvidius, that Brethren in
Scripture, were so named four manner of ways.

First, ab utero, from the womb as Cain and Abel. Genesis 4.9.
Where is Abel thy brother, says the Lord, Genesis 4. Secondly, A
consanguinitate, from the kindred. As Abraham and Lot: Let their be no strife I
pray thee between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen, for
we be brethren, Genesis 13. Thirdly, Genesis 13.8.
A Patria, from the Country, so Saint Paul called the Jews Brethren, because
they were his Countrymen I could wish (says he, that my self were accursed
from Christ for my brethren, Rom 9.3.
Romans 9. Fourthly, A professione, from the profession of the same Religion. So
all Christians are Brethren, all Turks, Brethren; all Papists, Brethren; all
Protestants Brethren. Now Saint Paul called the Corinthians Brethren, not the
first way from the womb; nor the second from the Kindred: nor the third, from
the Country, but the fourth and last from their profession, because they with
him did profess the same Religion, and did believe the same Gospel of Jesus
Christ. Whereby we are taught, to hold none so near and dear unto us, as
those that profess the true Religion.
I say not, but that we are to love, and to do good to all, we must love our
brethren, love our Kindred, love our Country, we are bound by the laws of God
and Nature, to observe all these;

First, you must love your natural brethren, for you are sprigs of the same
stock, you are branches of the same root; you are rivolets of the same
fountain; and Charity to each particular is the preservation of the whole.

Very Heathens by the instinct of nature have felt the strength of this bond:
for so I read of two brothers in the Roman Civil Wars, and one of them having
slain the other, and perceiving by taking off his Helmet that it was his
brother, cried out, Victor victo infoelicior, The Conqueror is more wretched
then the conquered, [ Atque illi^o pectus suum gladio transverberans, Live. and
Flor.
simulque lachrymas and sanguinem fundens, super fraternum sese cadaver
abjecit. and forthwith running himself through with his sword, shedding tears
and blood together, he cast himself upon his brothers carcass. And, no
doubt, but the sin of Cain was hereby greatly aggravated, in that he slew not
a man only, especially they being then so scarce that he was the fourth part
of the world whom he killed, but because he was his brother, and part of his
own flesh.

Yet you must go further, and do good to those of your own house, your kindred
according to the flesh. Genesis 13.
This was the bond that bound Abraham to Lot, because he was his brothers
son, Genesis 13. And, for this cause Saint Paul counseled the widows by
Timothy first, 1 Timothy 5.4.
to show piety at home to nephews and kindred, 1 Timothy 5.4.

And no question to this our Savior had regard, in choosing so many of his
kinsmen to be his Apostles.

Go further yet; you must do good to those of your own Country: which we may
learn likewise from the very heathen: for Plato said, and Tully after him,
Plato. Cicero.
Non nobis solum sumus nati, ortusque nostri partem patria vindicat, partem
parents, partem amici we are not borne for our selves alone; our Country will
challenge one share with us, our parents a second, our friends a third: and
very rare examples have been showed by Heathens, of their love to their
Country: as that, of Innius Brutus, Livius.
in putting to death his own sons for the love of his Country: and of
Manlius Torquatus, who, when it was told him, that that Army should win which
should have the Captain slain; rushed furiously into the midst of his
enemies, and so gained victory to his Country by his own overthrow. And of
Marcus Curtius who when there was a great gulf opened in Rome, that sent forth
most noisome and unwholesome vapors, that destroyed the Country; when he
heard, that nothing could stop it, but that only wherein the Romans most
gloried in; armed himself Cap-a-pe, and leapt in horse and man, and so the
gulf became shutup.

That I may not speak of Codrus, Camillus, Regulus, Cicero, and infinite
others, who shall all rise up in judgment at the last day, against our Faux'es,
Digbies, Catesbies, Garners, and the whole brood of English Jesuits; who most
unnaturally seek the Death of that which gave them Life, and the destruction
of them, that gave them Education.

Yet although we are bound (as you see) to love our Brethren, our Kinsmen, our
Country, both by the Law of God and Nature: Yet especially we must love and
do all the good we can to those that are of the household of faith: to the
true professors of Religion: all others are strangers in comparison, they
chiefly are your Brethren. The carnal fraternity is strong, but the Spiritual
fraternity is a great deal stronger: St. Aug. de diverse. Ser. 9.
Sanguinis enim fraternitas similitudinem tantum corporis refert, Christi autem
fraternitas unanimitatem cordis animaeque demonstrat. The fraternity or
brotherhood of blood only represents the likeness of the body, but the
fraternity of Christ, (as we are knit together in him) does demonstrate the
unanimity of the heart and soul.

Therefore our blessed Savior preferred his Disciples, that did the will of
his Father, before his mother and his brethren; Who is my Mother (says he) and
who are my Brethren, behold who they be, Whosoever does the will of my Father
which is in Heaven, Matthew. 12. ult.
the same is my mother, my sister and brother, Matthew. 12.

Est enim sanctior copula cordium, quam corporum; the bond of hearts is more
holy than the bond of bodies: even, Mary herself was better accepted, S.
August.
Profitendo fidem Christi, quam concipiendo carnem Christi; For conceiving the
faith of Christ in her heart, rather then for conceiving the flesh of Christ in
her womb.

Let the same mind therefore be in you which was in Christ Jesus our Lord:
Phil. 2*5.
And love them best, that come nearest unto him.

Love your Brethren, love your Kindred, love your Country, Gal. 6.10.
but especially love those that are of the household of Faith. Love your
Friends, but those especially that are friends with God, choose them not for
profit, but for piety: Illa vera and perfect a amicitia in Christi Gratia
sundata. That is true friendship that is grounded, upon the grace of Christ.
Many a man uses his friends, as Dionysius did his bottles, suck them out when
they are full, and hang them up when they are empty; this comes to pass,
because we love not in verity, that is, in the truth of the Christian
profession.

So, for your children, love them most that deserve best; not like some fond
parents, that affect one above another, not regarding their goodness, but
their handsomeness, or some outward toy: bedecking one, as if he were Jove's
Ganimede, and neglecting another, as if he belonged to Tryphons den. If any
difference be made, let it be in respect of their quality and condition; and
this will beget in them a holy emulation, and they will all strive to outstrip
one another in goodness, seeing you prefer those that deserve best. To
contract this Quos Deus conjunxit, nemo separet, Those whom God has joined
together, let no man put asunder: those whom the Spirit of Christ has made
one, let no man separate; but as the wicked multitude run in a knot to hell;
so, let us go hand in hand to Heaven: for we are all branches of the same
stock, we are all links of the same chain, we are all members of the same
body: we are all subjects under the same Sovereign, servants under the same
Master, Brethren under the same Father. Quod superest fratres, Finally,
brethren. And when I have said that word, I have said all I can; for I know no
nearer relation, as the Etymology of the word will tell us. The word is (...)
which comes from (...), uterus a womb, and (...) significante, (...), simul,
together, together in one belly; or from the word (...), which in the ancient
Greek tongue signifies unum, one, so near is the relation between Brethren.
I am loath to leave this sweet subject of love to Brethren, but because I shall
meet with it anon again, I will here leave it, and come to the next thing
considerable, which is the Apostles valediction to his brethren, Finally,
Brethren, Farewell. Farewell.


The word in the original is (...); which signifies three things, salvere,
valere, and gaudere. First, salvere, God save you, a word of greeting or
salutation at a meeting: Thus the Angel saluted Mary by that word, Luke 1.28.
(...), Hail Mary, Luke 1.

So Croesus in Xenophon saluted Cyrus, (...), Save you my Lord, whom Cyrus
answered, (...), and you also o Croesus: but that is not here meant, for the
Apostle is not now coming to them, but taking his leave of them; therefore the
second is more probable, as it is taken for valere to bid farewell, as (...),
Homer. Od.
Farewell youngmen, so Erasmus. yet Iunius and Tremelius, and generally all the
Greek Interpreters do expound it, Gaudete, rejoice, which seems to contradict
the former, for at a farewell-taking we do not use to rejoice but mourn, yet
if we consider is rightly, we shall find, that they signify the same thing,
for what else do I say when I say, Fare you well, but rejoice, I wish you good
health, Or, as our English Proverb has it, in our taking leave of friends,
Sit you merry, valete, gaudete, the very same. Whereby we are taught to pray
for the welfare of our brethren.

Thus Rebecca's Family blessed her before her departure from them; Gen, 24.60.
Genesis 24. And they blessed Rebecca, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be
thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of
those which hate them. Thus Isaac blessed Jacob, Genesis 28.3.
Gen 28. God Almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful* and multiply thee,
that thou may be a multitude of people, etc. Thus Aaron and his sons were
commanded to bless the people; Numb. 6.24, 25, 26.
Numb. 6. The Lord bless thee and keep thee: The Lord make his face to shine
upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: The Lord lift up his countenance upon
thee, and give thee peace. Thus Jacob blessed all his sons, Genesis 42. Deuteronomy.
32. Ruth. 2.4.
Genesis 49. Thus Moses blessed all the ten Tribes, Deuteronomy. 33. Thus Boaz blessed
the reapers, Ruth. 2. The Lord be with you, and they answered him, The Lord
bless thee. Thus the Apostles concluded their Epistles, always with a
blessing; Ephesians. 6.23.
Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith from God the Father, and the
Lord Jesus Christ. 1 These. 4. ult.
Grace be with you, Amen. The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. 2 Timothy 4.
ult. 1 Pet. 5. ult. Jude 3.
Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Mercy peace and love be
multiplied.

How much unlike these men are the Goliah's and the Shimeies of these times,
that are continually belching out curses against their brethren? Their mouths
are full of cursing, Psalm. 10.7.
and deceit, and fraud; under their tongues is mischief and vanity: as the
Psalmist speaks. Romans 3.14.
So the Apostle, The poison of Aspes is under their lips, and their mouth is
full of cursing and bitterness.

Every child has learned to vomit out his intoxicate poison of anger and
discontent against his fellow in bitter cursing: This is not to observe the
Apostles charge, Benedicite, and ne imprecamini, Bless and curse not, Romans
12.14.
Romans 12. For as thou love cursing, so shall it come unto thee, and as thou
delightest not in blessing, so shall it be far from thee. Psalm. 109.17.


But you will object against it, the examples of the Prophets, that did often
denounce woes, curses, and judgments against the people. To which I answer,
that it is not the same, to rail or curse, out of one's private corrupt
affection, as Shimei did David, 2 Samuel 16.
as to pronounce a curse in the name of the Lord; for this is no imprecation of
evil, as the other is, but only a prediction of their just punishment: Saint
Ambrose yields one reason for this, In Psalm. 119.
Non maledicit Propheta (says he) sed quasi medicus vult illos sanare, ut de
propriis flagitiis erubescant: The Prophet does not curse the people, but as a
Physician he would heal them, that they may be ashamed of their sins.

And St. Ierom renders another, S. Hieron. ad Demetriada.
answering unto a cavil of wicked Porphyrie, who objected that S. Peter did
curse Ananias and Saphira to death, not so (says he) Sed Dei judicium spiritu
annunciat, ut paenaduorum hominum sit doctrina multorum. But with a
Prophetical spirit he declares Gods judgment, that the punishment of two,
might be a warning to many.

But may we do as much now? no: but we are bound in Charity and Piety to wish
well to all, and to curse none: the reason is because now, that gift, (...),
the discerning of spirits, whereof the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 12.10.
2. Cor. 12. is ceased: by the which Saint Peter could say to Simon Magus, Act.
8.20.
Pecunia tua tecum pereat, Thy money perish with thee. And unless we did see a
man sin a sin unto death, that is, to sin a sin against the Holy Ghost,
for which we are forbid to pray, 1 John 5.16.
1. John 5. which case is very rare, and hard it is to say, who is guilty of
that sin: Otherwise then in these cases, we in Christian Charity (which
thinks not evil, but hops the best of all) must pray for all men: yet
making a difference, preferring always the Church of Christ, as the Apostle
prays here for the Corinthians, valete, fare you well.

Secunda pars.
And so we pass the valediction, and come to speak of those Dutiea which he
injoyneth the Corinthians, which are in number four. First, Be perfect.
Second, Be of good comfort. Third, Be of one mind. Fourth, Live in peace.

Be perfect.
First, Be perfect. The word is (...), which signifies two things, Compingere
vel componere, and complere, proficere, absolutum reddere; either to compound
or put together, or to make a thing absolute and complete. I will let go the
first here, because I shall meet with it again, and I will here fasten upon
the latter, as Saint Chrysostom and Oecumenius, Aquin. in Matthew* 5. ult.
and diverse others do expound it: And this Aquinas divides again, there is
(says he) perfectio gloriae, and perfectio viae, the one absolute and
perfect, the other imperfect: of both which the Apostle speaks evidently: of
the absolute perfection he says; not as though I had already attained, either
were already perfect, Phil. 3.12. Phil. 3.12.
and of the other immediately after, Let us therefore as many as be perfect be
thus minded. Verse 5.
Saint Paul denied that he had the one kind of perfection: and well he might,
since there was never any that have attained it in this state of imperfection.

For the whole law is required of every one, in so much that, Jam. 2.10. Jam.
3.2.
Whosoever offends in any one point is guilty of all, but in many things we
offend all: though many things we know, yet many more we do not know: Psalm.
19.12. Deuteronomy. 6.5.
Who can tell how often he offends? O cleanse thou me from my secret sins.
The Law requires the whole man, all his heart, all his mind, all his soul,
all his strength, but we, Legem implere, id est, non concupiscere; quorsu^ ergo
hoc qui vivit, etc. S. Aug. de tempore sermon. 49.
as we know but in part, so we love but in part, we do but in part, yea and the
least part too of what we ought. We may happily delight in the law of God
after the inner man, but still there is another law of our members warring
against the law of our mind, which often brings us into captivity to the law
of sin.

The Law is spiritual and perfect, Romans 7.14. but we are partly carnal, and
therefore imperfect: We have the heavenly treasure in earthen vessels, 2 Cor.
4.7.
2 Cor. 4.7. Whereby we fail in our best actions; we are corrupt in our best
works, all our goodness is as the morning dew, Hos. 6.4.
All our righteousness as polluted rags, Esaias. 64, 6. Job 1.1.
If I wash my self, says righteous Job (whom God himself proclaimed perfect
and upright) with snow water, Job 9.30.31.
and make my hands never so clean, yet shall thou plunge me in the ditch, and
mine own clothes shall make me filthy.

Ipsa iustitia* ^ostra ad examen diuinae iustitiae deducta in iusticia est: and
sordet in rar^bus Iudicis quod in aestimatione fulg^t opera^tis. Greg, mor. l.
5. cap. 8.
What is this Ditch but Natures corruption, drawn by a perpetual trench
through all mankind, from the loins of our first Parents? and what are those
filthy clothes, but the carnal motions, which being fashioned to our corrupt
hearts, do, like our garments, Easily beset us, and can never be clean put
off, until Nature it self be dissolved? This, this was that which made the
blessed Apostle to cry out, Aerum nosus ego homo, O wretched man that I am,
who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Romans 7.24.
The wise man puts the question to all men living, Quis dicere possit, who can
say, I have made my heart clean, Prove. 20.9*
I am pure from sin? The best that are, have Levia breviaque peccata, little
and small sins, At quamvis parva, quamvis pauca, non tamen nulla: St. August.
though they be little, though they be few, yet, they are not none at all.
There was (I think) as much said of Zachary and Elizabeth, as could be said of
any, that, They were both righteous before God, Luke 1.6.
walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord, blamlesse: Yet
all this while they were but walking. The Spouse in the Canticles was fair
among women, Cant. 1.5.
and yet her beauty was not such, but that the justly complains of her
Blackness. In one word, There is not a just man upon Earth, that does good and
sins not. Eccles. 7.20.


Sed cur praecipitur homini ista perfectio, cum in hac vita eam nemo habeat?
Pet. Lomb. l. 3. sent. did. 27.
Peter Lombard asks the question, why are we commanded in the Scripture to be
perfect, if no man in this life can attain unto it? Matthew. 5. ult. Aquin. in
locum
Be ye perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect. Aquinas answers
him; That same, Sieut, As, imitationem notat, non aequalitatem, it notes
imitation and not equality: though it be impossible for us to be absolutely
perfect as our heavenly Father is, yet we must all imitate Him as near as we
can, always striving and laboring after more perfection, and this is that
second perfection, which is here intended, called by Aquinas, In locum.
Perfectio viae.

Saint Chrysostom and Oecumenius jumpe upon the same words, Be perfect, that
is, (...): make up that which is wanting, and Ministerio and Ministro: both to
the Ministry and to the Minister.

First, Complete quae desunt Ministerio; Complete quae desunt ministerio.
Make up that which is wanting in the Ministry.

He that is righteous, let him be righteous still, and he that is holy, Apoc.
22.11.
let him be holy still: not standing at a stay, but increasing more and more in
righteousness and holiness. 1 These. 4.10.
So Saint Paul exhorts the Thessalonians, I beseech you, Brethren, that ye
increase more and more, and verbum (...), non tam est abundare, quam excellere,
and se ipsum quotidie in been operando superare, Sal in 1 These. cap. 4.
says Salmeron. The word signifies not only to abound, but also to excel, and
go beyond ones self every day in well doing. There is no standing still in
the way to Heaven, but with Saint Paul we must be always pressing forwards
toward the mark, Phil. 3.14.
for the price of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ. Non progredi, est
regredi; Not to go forwards, Sicut navis in flumen posita per aquae motum
descendit, nisi remigetur in contrarium: sic anima ex corruptione carnis and
pravitate ad malum cont^nuo descendit a profectione, nisi conetur in
contrartum, Nich. Lyra in locum.
is to go backward; like a Vessel upon the water, if it go not up, it must
needs fall down; there is no standing in the midst between Heaven and Hell.
Never forget then the words of the Apostle: Perfecti estote, Be ye perfect,
never stand at a stay, contenting your selves with what you have already; much
less go backward, but be always bettering, be always increasing in grace and
godliness, till you come unto perfection.

God says unto us now, as he said at first unto his creatures* foetificate
and augescite, be fruitful and multiply. Genesis 1.28. 2 Pet. 3.18.
Increase and grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. My
dearly beloved Brethren, be ye steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the
work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor shall not be in
vain in the Lord. 1. Cor. 15.58.
Content not your selves with small beginnings; think not your selves well
enough, if you have out-stript the heinous and enormous sinner, but labor to
excel the best of men. To this end, call your souls into question every day,
that you may know, how they have profited in grace: say with that young man in
the Gospel, Matthew. 19.20.
What lack I yet? What corruptions have I already abolished? and what yet
remain in me unmortified and unsubdued? What graces of the Spirit have I
already attained, and what do I yet stand in need of? So, the longer we live,
the more we shall learn; the more years upon our heads, the more grace in
our hearts: so shall we increase and multiply every day more and more in grace
and goodness, and like the trees of the Sanctuary, shall bring forth most
fruit in our age: so shall we add unto our faith virtue, 2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7.
unto our virtue knowledge, unto our knowledge temperance; unto our temperance,
patience; unto our patience, godliness: unto our godliness brotherly
kindness, unto our brotherly kindness charity, that so continually going
forwards from one degree of grace and godliness to another, we may at length
come to the unity of the faith, Ephesians. 4.13.
and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
of the stature of the fullness of Christ.

Again, Complet. quae desunt ministro.
if you would be perfect, you must complere ea quae desunt Ministro, make up
that which is wanting to the Minister. So the Apostle, Let him that is taught
in the Word, Gal. 6.6.
communicate unto him that teaches in all good things, Gal. 6. and be not
deceived, God is not mocked, but whatsoever a man sows, Verse 7.
that shall he also reap: Mark, God will not be mocked; the injury is not done
to man, but unto God himself: He will not be mocked: if you wrong us, you
wrong Him; if you rob us of our Tithes, which are our due by the laws of God
and Man, you rob God himself: He that despises you, Luke 10.16.
despises me, says Christ, and therefore the Hebrews called the Priests,
because they were anointed, Christ's; they bear the name of Christ himself,
and Christ does bear the name of them: They are Christ's under Him, and He is
High Priest over Them.

If you did but see the fat cheeks of the Jesuits, and the sowlne sides of the
Mass Priests, you would be ashamed to see, the Ministers of the Gospel of
Christ, to want their daily bread: The Priests of Baal sit at Ahabs table, but
the Priests of the Lord, are put into a Cave or Den, fed pane arido, with bread
and water. So that we may truly invert that saying of our Savior: The harvest
is plenteous (said He) but the laborers are but few; Matthew. 9.37.
but the laborers are plenteous (say we) and the harvest is but small. Happy
were many Ministers if they had but the gleaning of the Vintage, if they had
but one handful of every heap, one ear of every sheafe, one grain of every
ear.

But lest it should seem unseemly for us to plead our own causes, let me
refer you to Saint Paul, who spends a whole Chapter in defending the cause of
the Minister, which he does by diverse strong and undeniable arguments:
although he himself, was as little beholding to them, to whom he preached as
any man; for rather then be burdensome, you may read, how he labored with
his own hands.

Be of good comfort.
And so much for the first admonition, be perfect, we come now to the second, be
of good comfort, Graeca vox adhortationem and consolationem comprehendit.
Gualther in locum.
The word in the original comprehends two things, exhortation and
consolation. Vbi nota, where note (says he) utroque opus esse, that there is
need of both: first of exhortation: Multa enim remo^antur jam ingressos viam,
Idem.
opus est igitur stimulo tum public, tum privatim. There be many things that
stop and hinder us, when we are entered the way to Heaven, therefore we have
need to spur on one another both in public and private, by zealous
exhortations and admonitions. So the Apostle counsels the Hebrews, Heb. 3.13.
Take heed, brethren, left there be in any of you an evil heart, of unbelief
in departing from the living God; but exhort one another daily, while it is
called to day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
So shall we uphold those that are ready to fall, and such as are through
frailty and infirmity already fallen, we shall raise up again. So the Apostle
admonishes the Galathians, Brethren, if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye
which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness* Gal. 6.1.
considering thy self, lest thou also be tempted. But I rather cleave to the
latter interpretation of the word, as Iunius and Tremelius and our English
Translation renders it, consolationi fruimini, be of good comfort. As if the
Apostle should have said to them, notwithstanding you have been faulty in many
kinds, and have been threatened and chastised for your faults diverse and
sundry ways, yet comfort yourselves in the mercies of God; for though ye be
troubled on every side, yet ye are not distressed; though perplexed, yet not
in despair, 2 Cor..4.9.
though persecuted, yet not forsaken; though cast down, yet not destroyed;
therefore, consolatione fruimini, be of good comfort.

Thus is God wont to send fair weather after foul, the Sun after rain, the
day after night, Summer after Winter, comfort after sorrow; according to the
Psalmist: Weeping may endure for a night, Psalm. 30.5.
at mane adest cantus, but joy comes in the morning. Deuteronomy. 3^.13.
Thus does he make us suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty
rock. Thus are we made whole by being wounded and healed by our stripes; thus
(...) become (...), nocumenta, documenta, our cross becomes our crown, our
destructions, our instructions, our corrections, our directions. God would not
always have his Prophets to be like Boanerges, sons of Thunder, but
sometimes like Barnabas, sons of consolation. Esaias 40.1*
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, says your God, speak ye comfortably to
Jerusalem and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity
is pardoned, for she has received double of the Lords hands for all her sins.
Esaias 42.3.
A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench,
He shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

It is true indeed, the wound must be launched before we can expect a cure,
Aretius.
At qui vulnus sauciat and non obligat, carnifex and latro potius est quam
medicus. He that opens a wound and binds it not up again, is a hangman and
a robber, liker then a Physician. There must be the oil of comfort, as well as
the wine of terror powered into our wounded souls. There was a great and
strong wind, which rent the Mountains, and brake in pieces the Rocks before
the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an Earthquake,
1 King. 19.11, 12.
and after the Earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire, and after
the fire a still small voice: and there was the Lord. They that are continually
thundering out threatenings, preaching nothing else but hell and damnation, do
preach without the Lord, and without his Spirit, 2 Cor. 1.3. ^ Cor. 4.21. Heb.
10.29. Revel. 11.11. Gal. 5.22.
for the Lord is the God of mercy, and the Father of all consolation: and his
Spirit is the Spirit of meekness, the Spirit of Grace, the Spirit of Life, and
the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
goodness, meekness, etc. Thus the Saints of God have been always wont, in
converting sinners to God, wisely and discreetly to temper and mingle mercies
with judgments, promises with threatenings; as being like the Sun and the
light, like the fire and the heat, unseperable. Thus Nathan the Prophet did to
David, first, he strikes terror into his soul, by laying his heinous and
crying sins unto his charge, with a Tu es homo, Thou art the man, but he leaves
him not long troubled, but immediately upon his confession, 2 Samuel 12.7, 13.
peccavi, I have sinned, he administered comfort, the Lord also has put away
thy sin. So Saint Peter when he had terrified the people, Act. 2.37, 38.
until they were pricked in their hearts, and cried out, men and brethren what
shall we do? he tells them presently, Repent, and be baptized every one of you
in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive
the gift of the Holy Ghost. Thus when Saint Paul had brought the Keeper of the
prison into a strait, so that he came in trembling and cried out, Sirs, what
shall I do to be saved? he straitway eased his mind, Act. 16.30.31
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved, and thy house. And
so did he here with the Corinthians, after that he had wounded them with many
menaces and threatenings, and laying many grievous things unto their charge, he
here applies the plaster for the cure, Consolatione fruimini, be of good
comfort.

Be of one mind.
Yet he would have them go upon good grounds too, they must amend their
faults, which he formerly had told them of, they must lay aside all discord
and dissension, and live in Unity and Peace: and so might they comfort
themselves with the expectation of Gods blessing upon them, that the God of
love and peace should be with them.

Idem sapite, in pace agite: be of one mind, live in peace.

Erasmus in ocum.
Vt a pace exorsus, in pacem desinit, vir vere Apostolicus. As he began with
peace, so he ends with peace, a man truly Apostolical: for you may observe,
how aptly do agree, those things that are spoken in the end of this second
Epistle, with those that are spoken in the beginning of the first: There he
faith, I beseech you, brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye
all speak the same things, and that there be no divisions among you, but that
you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment:
which is here repeated in fewer words, Be of one mind, live in peace. These
are two distinct things to be of one mind, and to live in peace, and so I will
handle them. Benedict. Justinian. in locum.
Id ipsum sapite, de fidei dogmatibus accipiendum est, pax vero seditiones toll
it; to be of one mind, is to be understood in matters of faith, or in those
things which concern Religion, but Peace is opposed to discord and dissension.
Gualther. in locum.
Sunt enim qui quoad fidem, idem sentiunt, tumultuantur autem aliis de causis:
there be some that are of the same mind, Vnanimit as fidei induobus
attenditur; in intellectu and affectu; Cor unum in intelligendis and credendis,
and Anima una in affectibus, id est, in volendis and operandis. Hugo Card. in
locum.
in matters of Religion, yet are together by the ears for other things: we
will take them therefore severally.

First, the Apostle wishes them to be all of one mind, that is in matters of
Religion: which is opposed to two things, Heresy and Schism, Haeresis errorem
fundamentalem in fide tuetur. Heresy mayntaineth some fundamental error in
the Faith: Schisma unitatem Ecclesiae ob minuta discindit. Schism does cut in
sunder the unity of the Church for small and trivial matters.

First, Heretics against unity.
for Heretics that do mayntaine some fundamental error in the Faith: of
whom St. Peter prophecieth, 2 Pet. 2.1.
saying, There shall be false teachers among you, which privily shall bring in
damnable Heresies, 2 Pet. 2. And of such Saint Paul charge the Romans to
beware, Romans 16.17. Romans 16.17.
I beseech you Brethren, mark them diligently which cause divisions and
offenses, contrary to the doctrine, which ye have received, and avoid them;
for they that are such, serve not the Lord, but their own bellies, and with
fair speech and flattering deceive the hearts of the simple. This is the
malice that Satan bears the Church of God, by suborning Heretics and false
Teachers to bring in damnable Doctrine to seduce men from the true Religion,
this his practice from the beginning; for no sooner had God finished his work
and perfected man, but Satan sets himself incontinent to pervert him: In the
two first Chapters of Genesis, you shall find God always speaking; Deus
dixit, God said, thus and thus: but in the beginning of the Third there comes
in, and Serpens dixit, and the Serpent said; The Devil will have a word for
evil, for every word that God shall have for good: yet it is to be marked,
that howsoever error be old, yet truth is elder; for first, Deus dixit, and
then Serpens dixit, first, God said, and then the Devil said.

If then the Devil were so malicious at the beginning, Then how much more now,
since his time is so short? like the birds of Norway, that because the days
there are so short, make the more haste in flying: even so does Satan, because
his time draws on, Jude 6.
when he shall be bound in everlasting chains under darkness; he does
therefore with the more rage and fury seek to work our destruction. Therefore
since Satan is so busy* to raise up his wicked instruments, that hold not the
doctrine of Christ in truth, but mayntain errors against the tenor of holy
Scripture, and the profession of the Church, how should we labor to mayntain
faith and a good conscience, and not suffer our selves to be withdwrawn there
from. And if thou find thy judgment weak, that thou art not able to answer the
cavils of these Seducers, these Brownists, Familists, Anabaptists, Papists, and
the like, take my counsel, and give no ear at all unto them, lest thou* be
perverted and brought to believe lies; and if thou would increase in
knowledge, and be bettered in thy judgment, that thou may not be seduced,
let me advise thee, to search the Scriptures diligently, and compare one place
with another, not in private study only, but by conferring with the Godly. With
all, pray unto Almighty God in true humility of heart, for the illumination of
his holy Spirit, whereby thou may in mind rightly conceive of the truth, by
Faith embrace it in thy heart, and by obedience honor it in thy life. If thou
shall thus do constantly and faithfully, thou shall be sure to be preserved
from error both fundamental and final, and in due time shall know the truth:
for the promise is, Ask and you shall have, Matthew. 757. Jam. 1.5.
seek and you shall find, and, If any man want wisdom, let him ask it of
God, and it shall be given him.

And so much for the first sort of men, Schismatics against unity.
that do infringe the Apostles charge, to be of one mind, and they are
Heretics. We come now to the second, and they are Schismatics; that do cut in
sunder the unity of the Church for small and trifling matters: because,
forsooth, there are imperfections and blemishes in the Church; because Holy
Discipline is not restored to the manner of the Apostles: because the
Eldership, the Presbytry, the Brotherhood, or Seniory is not re-established:
which when it shall be done after their desire, look for a mass of mischief,
a Chaos of confusion presently to follow. These are the newfangled
fantastical fashionists of these times, who for the most part illiterate and
unlearned, take upon them to censure the Scripture, and perversely defend and
hold their own judgments, rejecting all other interpretations. These are they,
that leave the Society of the Saints, and the appointed places of Gods Worship
and Service, and call assemblies themselves, in private houses, in secret
corners, in solitary places, in fields, in woods, in barns, and other unseemly
places, as unholy as themselves. Surely these people are not of Jerusalem,
Psalm. 122.3.
that is, a City that is at unity in it self. They seem rather to come from
Babylon, they are so confounded among themselves: they are not such as keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, Ephesians. 4 3.
but they follow the directions of a turbulent and fiery spirit in strife and
discord. They may brag of the Spirit what they will, but this I know, that
the holy Spirit did not descend upon the Disciples, Acts 2.1. and 4.32.
till they were all with one accord in one place: till the whole multitude of
them that believed, had all but one heart, and one soul. And St. Jude says
plainly, Jude 19.
that They that thus separate themselves, have not the Spirit. No, no, it is
the spirit of error, it is the spirit of ignorance, it is the spirit of
rebellion: It is the spirit of the Devil, I was going to say, but then I had
wronged him, for he is wiser than so, he knows full well, that if his kingdom
were divided within it self, it could not stand. Matthew. 12.26.
The barbarous Soldiers themselves had this wit with them, Mat. 27.35.
Not to divide Christ's seamelesse coat, but rather to cast lots for the whole:
None, but a jadish Harlot will say, 1. Kings 3.26
Scindite puerum, Divide the Child: None but an enemy to the Church, will seek
the division of the Church, for that is one. In Judah the hand of God was to
give them one heart, to do the commandment of the King and of the Princes, 2.
Chron. 30.12. Ezekiel. 11.19.
by the word of the Lord: and I will give them one heart, and I will put a new
spirit within them: And We being many, are one body in Christ, Romans 12.5.
and every one members one of another: And the multitude of them that went
before, and that followed after, Matthew. 21.9.
cried, saying: Hosanna to the son of David, blessed is he that comes in
the Name of the Lord, Hosanna in the Highest. They that went before, and they
that followed after, sang the same Tune: would to God that we were of that mind
once, that there were no divisions amongst us, but that we all spoke the same
things. The Ministers that go before, and the people that follow after, would
we were all of the same mind, would we were but one body, Ephesians. 4.4.
and one spirit, even as we are called in one hope of our calling: For what
becomes of the member that is cut off from the body? What becomes of the branch
that is cut off from the Vine? What becomes of the River that is cut off from
the head? you all know, that the member dies, that the branch withers, that
the River dries up: even so shall they that separate themselves from the
Church of Christ, perish, and come to a fearful end.

Herodotus.
I remember a Story of Cyrus, who going to fight against Scythia, and coming to
a broad River, and not able to pass over it, he bethought himself, and cut
and divided it into diverse arms and sluices, and so made it passable for all
his Army. This is the Devils policy; coming to invade us, and finding his
passage stopped by the overflowing streams of Love, Unity, and Concord, he
then labors to divide and separate us into diverse Sects and Factions, and so
he will easily overcome us. Would to God therefore that we were but as wise as
those barbarous people, Quintus Curtius.
of whom Quintus Curtius reports, who though they were continually jarring
and falling out, and banding in Arms amongst themselves, yet when Alexander
the great came among them, the equality of the danger wherein they all were,
joined their hearts and forces together against their common enemy. When Moab
was against Ammon, and Ammon against Moab, and Edom against both, sheathing
their swords each into others sides, Iehosaphat and the Jews need not strike a
stroke. To this St. Paul alludes, Gal. 5.15.
when he says, If you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not
consumed of one another. How have the Kingdoms of Israel and of Judah been
weakened, but through divisions among themselves? How could the Turk have ever
made such inrodes into Christendom as he has, if Christians had not been
divided among themselves? I have read of a Stone called Tyrhenus, which, being
whole, swimmeth above water; but being broken, every part thereof sinketh to
the bottom: In like manner will it be with us; if we remain whole and
undivided, having but one heart, and one soul, and one mind, we shall swim
above water; all the boisterous surges and raging billows that our enemies can
raise up against us, shall not be able to overwhelme us; but if we be once
broken and divided in our opinions, if we have diverse hearts, and diverse
souls, and diverse minds, we shall incontinent sink, perish, and come to
naught. I Will conclude this with that prayer of the Apostle St. Paul for the
Romans: Now the God of Patience and Consolation, grant you to be like-minded
one toward another, according to Christ Jesus; that ye may with one mind,
Romans 15.5, 6.
and with one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Id
ipsum sapite, Be of one mind.

And so much for that unity and unanimity in matters of Faith: Live in peace.
we come now to that external Peace and Concord, which is required of all
Christians, in those words, In pace agite, Live in peace: where the Apostle
gives us to understand, that there had been divisions and contentions among
the Corinthians, as may appear in diverse places: as 1. Cor. 1.11. 1. Cor. 1.11.
It has been declared to me of you my brethren, by them which are of the
house of Cloe, that there are contentions among you. 1 Cor. 3.3, 4.
So, Chap. 3. verse 3, 4. For ye are yet carnal; for whereas there is amongst
you envying, strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? For
while one says I am of Paul, and another I am of Apollo, are ye not carnal?
Once more, 1. Cor. 11.18.
1. Cor. 11.18. When you come together in the Church, I hear that there be
divisions among you, and I partly believe it. Now, the blessed Apostle, to cure
this Intemperancy, brings this as a sovereign Antidote, In pace agite, Live in
peace. O quam bonum and jucundum, etc. Psalm. 133.1.
O how good and pleasant a thing it is for Brethren to live together in Unity!
There be some things that be Bona, sed non jucunda; Good, but not pleasant, as
Patience in Adversity; there be other things that be Iucunda, sed non bona;
Pleasant, but not good, as voluptuousness in prosperity; there be other things
that be Nec bona, nec jucunda; Neither good, nor pleasant, as envy and worldly
sorrow: and there be some things that be Et bona, and jucunda, Both good, and
pleasant; and such is that Peace that is here commended, O how good and
pleasant a thing it is! Verse 2.
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard,
even Aarons beard, and went down to the skirts of his garments. This Ointment
is Peace, and it is upon the Head of Aaron, that is, Christ, who is the the
Head of the Body, Col. 1.18.
the Church; and from thence it ran down to the Beard, that is, to his
Apostles; the Beard being a sign of Virility, and near the Head, as They were
to Christ. And it went down to the Skirts of his garments; His garments, Esaias
49.18.
that is, the Church, As I live, says the Lord, thou shall surely clothe thee
with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them to thee as a Bride does. And
by the skirts of this garment is meant every inferior Saint. Such is the large
extent of this precious ointment, Unity and Peace.

What then shall we think of the wrangling and brawling spirits of these
days, that are of such a salt fiery humor, that they can live peaceably with
no man? like flax or gunpowder, the the least spark will catch them: that
will strive and contend in law like the Frog and the Mouse for the marish
ground, till the Kite sweep them both away, I mean, till the Lawyer has eaten
them both up: Surely, these must needs be the last days, since Love and
Charity is grown so cold, for you shall scarcely find a Parish which is not
divided; you shall hardly come into a family, that is not disjoynted, rare are
the friends whom we dare put trust in: but we are all in pieces, all divided,
like Jacobs troop, into diverse companies, like Labans sheep, of diverse colors;
some white, some black, some speckled, some of this mind, some of that, some
of one opinion, some of another; we are a Chaos of confusion; a Tohu and Bohu,
like the people scattered over the land of Egypt to gather stubble, and to pick
up straws. You may read, Judge. 5.15.
Judge. 5. That for the divisions of Reuben, their were great thoughts of heart:
That was but for one Tribe scattered from the rest; what thoughts of heart then
may there be for the division of a whole Kingdom, nay, of Kingdoms? What
thoughts of heart, when Nation shall rise up against Nation, Matthew. 24.7.
and Kingdom against Kingdom? The Heathen were wont to say of the Christians
of the Primitive Church, Ecce, ut se invicem diligunt: See, how they love one
another, Love was then the badge and cognizance of a true Christian; but now it
may be trulier said, Ecce, ut se invicem oderunt: see how they hate one
another, see how they malice, and envy, and contend with one another. I wonder
where we may now find a David and a Jonathan, an Eusebius, and a Pamphilus, a
Ruth and a Naomi, where shall we now seek, Vnam animam in duobus corporibus
inclusam, one soul shut up in two bodies? where shall we look for such as
where the Apostles, that had but one heart and one soul? No, no, those golden
days are past, and now are dog-dayes come, every one biting and barking at his
Neighbor, not like Christians, not like Brethren, not like Saints, but like
Bears and Tygres we tear one another, like Scythians and Canibals we eat up
one another, as void of all natural affection.

O my beloved, is this Christianity? Is this to be members of the same body?
Is this to be sons of the same Father? Mal. 2.10.
Have we not all one Father, has not one God created us? Why then do we deal
treacherously every man against his brother?

But I hope better things of you, and let not I beseech you, my hopes be
frustrate, but follow you peace with all men, especially with those that are of
the household of Faith, 1 Pet. 3.9.
Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as Brethren, be
pitiful, be courteus, not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing,
but contrariwise blessing, knowing that you are thereunto called that you
should inherit a blessing. John 9.50.
Have salt then within your selves, and have peace one with another: remembering
that God is the God of Peace, Christ is the Prince of Peace, the Angels are the
Messengers of Peace, the Ministers are Preachers of Peace, the Magistrates are
Defenders of Peace. This, This was Christ's legacy that he left his Desciples.
Pacem relinquo vobis, My Peace I leave with you. John 14.27.
It was bequeathed from Christ to his Apostles, and from his Apostles to us,
for so commonly they conclude their Epistles, Grace be unto you and Peace from
God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ. Peace, it is the language of
Heaven; the Angels speak no other, then, Glory be to God on High, Luke 2.14.
on Earth Peace. The second thing in the World is Peace; one only thing before
it, the Glory of God; yet Glory and Peace must be sung together, no Glory on
High will be admitted without peace upon earth: no Gift on His Altar will be
accepted, before Peace be made in the earth: first go your way and make peace
on earth, and that done, come again, and you shall be accepted to give glory
to Heaven, and not before. Have Peace therefore with all men, especially with
those that are of the household of Faith: with all men? not absolutely, but upon
these conditions. The Apostle tells us the first, Heb. 12.14.
Follow peace (says he) and holiness, they must go still together; never
purchase peace with the loss of holiness* If I must by keeping peace with
men, war with my God, and offend my Conscience, and betray the Truth, I will
resolve to be contentious still, and so far from following of peace, that I
will proclaim open war, and hang out my flags of defiance against all the
world; I will refuse and defy that peace, that cannot be had but upon such
hard terms. I am sure I have a good warrant for it: the Prophet David was of
this mind: he accounted Peace a good and a comely thing, but it must be among
Brethren, those that hate God, he will hate; they that are Gods enemies, shall
be his Enemies. Do I not hate them, O God, that hate thee, Psalm. 139.21, 22.
and am I not grieved with those that rise up against thee? Yea, I hate them
with a perfect hatred, I account them my enemies, Psalm. 139.21, 22 And yet cum
odio habemus vitia, Pet. Mart.
personas prosequimur charitate, says Peter Martyr, Though we hate their
Vices, we must love their Persons; otherwise it will prove a devilish malice,
and not a Godly hatred, hate therefore the Sin, but love the Man.

Secondly, Harken to the Apostle, Romans 12.18. If it be possible, and as much as
in you lies, live peaceably with all men. Romans 12.18. Theodoret.
Fac qaod tuum est, ostende alacritatem, and animi promptitudinem. Do what lies
in you, show your cheerfulness and readiness of mind to entertain Peace: It Is
true, it is not in you to put into other men a peaceable disposition, but see
that there be no stand on your behalf, and then your duty is discharged.

Lastly, This must be understood as meant in a private or personal cause, that
we are thus eagerly to follow and pursue after peace. Otherwise if the cause be
public, or do concern others, if it tend to the undoing or betraying of our
neighbor, in such cases as these, a man has a Sanctuary provided him, even
the Law, which he may lawfully fly unto: yet so as he still remember to
ensue Peace, and be as ready upon any reasonable terms to lay hold on it.

This is a Doctrine never out of season, but especially at this time, when
Kingdoms half disjoynted are united (I pray God continue it) especially at
this time, when all the World are together by the ears, and we in safety;
especially at this time, when you are to receive the communion of the body and
blood of our Savior Christ; which is the Sacrament of Peace, and a Seal of
our union and communion with Christ our Head, and with one another; where you
are all to eat of the same spiritual meat, where you are all to drink of the
same spiritual drink: when then should you be friends and at peace among your
selves, if not now? I require and charge you before him that knows the hearts
and tries the reins of all men, that if any of you have a grudging against me
against him, against anyone, that you do not dare to approach that holy Table,
before you disgorge your stomachs, Matthew. 5.24.
lay down your malice and be friends, First, go and be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come and offer thy Gift.

Tertia pars. And the God of love, etc.
Thus if you perform the Apostles precept, you shall not fail of his promise:
Be of one mind and live in peace, and the God of Love and Peace shall be with
you. Some take this for a blessing, others for a promise: it may be either, or
both: for first not only the power to Pray, to Preach, to give the Sacraments,
but also the power to bless you that are Gods people, is annexed and is a
branch of Ours, Numb. 6.23, 24, 25, 26.
of the Priests office. Thus God commanded Aaron and his sons to bless the
people, Numb. 6. Thus our blessed Savior, blessed his Disciples at his
departure from them. Luke 24. Luke 24.50.
He lift up his hands and blessed them, and this was the custom in the
Primitive Church, B. Andrews.
at the end of the Liturgy ever to dismiss the assembly with a blessing:
before which was pronounced, not a man of them would stir: like good Jacob,
Genesis 32.26.
Non demittam te nisi benedixeris mihi, I will not let thee go till thou have
blessed me: Esau himself lift up his voice, and wept for a blessing; Genesis
27.34.
yea, He cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his Father,
bless me, even me also, O my Father. Such a virtue held they in it; but an
evil custom has prevailed with our people, away they go without blessing, as
if it were not worth the taking with them. I marvel how they will be
inheritors of the blessing hereafter, that seem to set so little by it now: if
they ever intend to hear, Come ye blessed, me thinks, they should not now
run from the blessing: none of the Apostles did so but one, and that was
Judas, and you know what followed, he went out and hanged himself.

But as this is a wish or blessing of the Apostle, so it is likewise a promise
upon the performance of those duties: where you may observe, that as God is
wont to proportionate men's punishments to their sins, so does he here, their
rewards to their virtues, if we live in love and peace, the God of Love and
Peace will live with us. I would we were but truly possessed of the greatness of
this blessing, I would we did but know what it were to have God to be with us:
not as he was with Moses in a fiery Bush, not as he was with the Israelites
upon Mount Sinai in Thunder and Lightning, but as he was with Elias in a still
small voice; in Love and Peace. And, contrariorum eadem est ratio; If it, be so
great a blessing to the godly to have God with them, then what an ineffable
curse is it, to the wicked, to have God from them: and so have all they that
live in strife and discord; they are without God in the world here, and they
shall be without him hereafter, if you will credit Saint Paul, who says, that
they that live in hatred, Gal. 5.21.
variance, emulations, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, etc. shall not
inherit the Kingdom of God.

If it be possible therefore, and as much as in you lies, live peaceably with
all men; yea, seek peace and ensue it, what ever it cost you, whither whether
pleasure or profit, or credit, or whatever else, slack not, nor give over till
thou have achieved it. So will I make bold to make good the promise of the
Apostle to you, and it shall be my final Benediction, Deus Charitatis, the God
of Love and Peace shall be with you. He shall be with your bodies, they shall
be satisfied; He shall be with your souls, they shall be in peace; He shall be
with your estates, they shall be secure; He shall be with your good name, that
shall be inviolable, He shall be with you in this life, you shall live in
Peace, and you shall die in Peace, and He shall be with you in the life to
come, where you shall eternally enjoy the beatificall Vision of the Prince of
Peace. Grant this O Father, thou God of Love and Peace, for thy Sons sake
Jesus Christ the Righteous, to whom with the Father and the holy Spirit, three
persons, and one God, be ascribed all Honor and Glory, Praise and Thanksginow
and for ever. Amen.
