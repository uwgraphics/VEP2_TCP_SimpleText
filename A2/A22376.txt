A Proclamation for a public, general, and solemn Fast.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, upon the humble Petition of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in the present Parliament assembled,
taking into his Princely consideration the many important causes, and
extraordinary occasions calling upon him, and his people for a joint and
general humiliation of all Estates of His Kingdom, before Almighty God in
Prayer and Fasting, as well for auerting this heavy Uisitation of Plague and
Pestilence, already begun, and dangerously dispersed in many parts of this
Kingdom, as also for drawing down his Blessing upon his Majesty and His
people, and Armies both by Sea and Land, has therefore (according to the
Royal and laudable example of other godly Kings) by the advice and assistance
of His Prelates and Bishops, caused an Order or Direction for public Prayer
and Fasting, to be conceived and published in Print, in a Book for this
special purpose, to be generally observed and solemnized, in humble hope and
confidence, that when both Prince and People together through the whole Land,
shall join in one common, and solemn Devotion, of sending up their faithful
and repentant Prayers to Almighty God at one instant of time, the same shall
be more available to obtain that mercy, help and comfort from him, which
in the present important occasions this Church and Commonwealth do stand in
need of.

His Majesty does therefore by this present Proclamation straightly charge and
command, That a general, public, and solemn Fast be kept and holden, as well
by abstinence from food, as by public Prayers, Preaching, and hearing of the
Word of God, and other sacred duties, according to the direction of the said
Book, in all collegiate and parish-Churches and Chapels within this Kingdom
of England, and Dominion of Wales, upon Wednesday, the twentieth day of this
instant month of July, and from thencefoorth continued upon the Wednesday of
every week following, by the reverend, religious, and devout Assembly of the
whole Congregation of such of the Inhabitants in each several place, as are

several Provinces, and Diocesses, and all Parsons, Uicars and Curats, within
their several Parishes and Charges, as also all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of
Peace, and other Officers in their several places, limits, and jurisdictions,
respectively to take especial care, that this His Majesty's Royal
commandment be duly executed and observed: And that they themselves be lights

diligently and deuoutlyfollow and perform the same, as they tender their
duties to Almighty God, and to their Prince and Country, and will answer for
their profane, or contemptuous neglect hereof at their uttermost perils.

his Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save the King.
