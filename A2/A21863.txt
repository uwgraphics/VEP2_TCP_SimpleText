By the Queen.
A Proclamation commanding the execution of an Act of Parliament provided for
avoiding of dangerous annoyances about Cities, Burroughes and Towns within the
Realm.
THe Queens Majesty understanding, that by a Statute made in the twelfth
year of the reign of King Richard the second, it was enacted that, for that
so much doung, and other filth of the issues and intralles, as well of beasts
killed, as of other corruptions, were cast and put in Ditches, Rivers, and
other waters, and also within many other places within about, and nigh unto
diverse Cities, Burroughes and Towns of the Realm, and the Suburbs of them,
that the Air there was greatly corrupt and infect, and many maladies, and
other intolerable diseases did daily happen, as well to the inhabitants, and
also dwellers in the same Cities, Burroughes, Towns and Suburbs, as to other
thither repairing and passing, to the great annoyance, damage, and peril of
the inhabitants, dwellers, repairers, and passers aforesaid: It was accorded
and assented, that Proclamation should be made as well in the City of London,
as in other Cities, Burroughes and Towns, through the Realm of England, where
it should be needful, as well within the Franchises as without: That all they
which did cast and put annoyances, doung, issues, intralles, and other ordure
in Ditches, Rivers, Waters, and other places aforesaid, should cause them
utterly to be removed, avoided and carried away, betwixt that and the feast of
S. Michael then next ensuing, after the end of the said Parliament: every one
upon pain to loose and to forfeite unto the said King xx.li. And that the
Majors and Bailiffes of every such City, Borough or Town, and also the
Bailiffes of the Franchises should compel the same to be done upon like pain,
And that if any did feel him self grieved, that it were not done in the
manner aforesaid, and would there upon complain him to the Chauncellor, after
the said feast of S. Michael, he should have a writ to make him (of whom he
would so complain) to come in the Chauncerie, there to she we why the said
pain should not be levied of him. And moreover, that Proclamation should be
made as well in the City of London, as in other Cittes, Burroughes and Towns,
as before: That none of what condition so ever he were, should do to be set, or
thrown from thenceforth, any such annoyances, issues, doung, intralles, nor
none other ordure in the Ditches, Rivers, Waters, and other places aforesaid,
And if any did, he should be called by writ before the Chauncellor, at his suit
that would complain: and if he were found guilty, he should be punished after
the discretion of the Chauncellor, as by the same Act appears: And finding
how necessary it shall be to have the said Act duly executed within the
Cities of London, and Westminster, and the Suburbs thereof, and other places
near thereunto adjoining, and foreseeing what benefit may grow by the due
execution thereof in the places aforesaid, as well to the Inhabitants of these
her Highness Cities of London, and Westminster, as also to al Noblemen,
Gentlemen and others, which for sundry respects have occasion to remain in, or
to repair unto the same Cities, and the Suburbs thereof. And for the avoiding
of such dangerous infections, as otherwise by means of these noisome
annoyances might grow within the said Cities, and the Suburbs thereof, does
hereby will the said Act to be proclaimed within the Cities of London, and
Westminster, and the Counties thereunto adjoining. And does hereby signify,
declare and publish, her Highness good will and pleasure to be, that the said
Statute shall be from henceforth put in due execution, according to the tenor,
effect and true meaning of the same, within the same Cities, and the Suburbs
thereof, and in all other places near adjoining to the same: And does hereby
straightly charge and command all and every person and persons, to abstain
and forbear to cast or put forth any intralles of beasts, or other filthy
or noisome thing whatsoever, into any Ditch, River or Water, or into any Field
or high way, in or near unto the said Cities of London, and Westminster, or
the Suburbs of them, or of either of them. And her Highness does further
charge and straightly command, that all such noisome corrupt infections and
filthy substance, as have been heretofore thrown or cast forth into any place
or places, in or near unto the same Cities, or either of them, or the Suburbs
of the same, by any person or persons whatsoever, whereby the Air is or may be
corrupted or infected, shall before the xxv. day of August next coming, be
removed and carried away, upon pain of the punishment and penalty contained in
the said Statute. And her Majesty does hereby straightly charge, command and
require all and singular Justices of Peace, Majors Sheriffs, Bailiffes,
Constables, and all other Officers and Ministers, to whom it shall apperteine,
that they and every of them, do carefully and duly see to the execution of
the said Act, and of this her Majesty's good will and pleasure, in this her
Highness Proclamation, published and declared upon pain of her Highness
indignation and displeasure.

Given at our Manor of Greenewiche the sixth day of June, in the xxxii. year
of our reign.
