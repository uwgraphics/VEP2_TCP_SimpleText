A Proclamation to reform the disorder in access of greater number of persons
to the Court, then have just cause so to do.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty being informed of the resort of a greater
number of persons to her Town and Castle of Windsor, and other places
adioining, then are convenient, and that are not ordinary servants to attend
on her Majesty in the Court, nor do belong to her Counsailors or other her
principal officers attending on her Majesty's person, whereof by late view
taken both by the officers of the Town, and by her Harbingers, there appears
great disorder, in that a great number of owners of houses do lodge a
multitude of persons that are not allowed by any Harbinger, and many of the
same so lodged, are persons that with their wives, children, and servants, are
come from London and Westminster, and other infected places, whereby great
danger must needs follow, if remedy be not provided very speedily: And
therefore her Majesty has commanded the Knight Harbinger, with other her
Harbingers, and with the assistance of the servants of the Knight Marshall, and
with the Mayor of Windsor and other officers in the Towns adjoining, that they
do cause a search to be newly made, according as they are ordered and directed
by her Majesty's privy Counsel, and that all persons do obey them in the
execution of those orders. And especially her Majesty charge all owners of
houses in the said Towns of Windsor, Eaton, and the Towns adjoining within
five miles of her Castle, that within two days after publication thereof at
the Market cross in Windsor, they do exclude all persons that shall not be
allowed by the said Harbinger to have lodging, upon pain of imprisonment, and
shutting up of their houses, and such fine as shall be imposed upon them for the
breach of this her Majesty's commandment. Finally, her Majesty charge all
persons that shall not be warranted by the Harbingers Billets to have lodging,
that they do depart from the Court, and from five miles near the Court, within
two days after the publication hereof, upon pain of imprisonment and fine
also for their contempt. And that none which are not allowed to come within the
Castle, but shall come upon pretense of any suites, shall not enter until they
shall first declare their names and places from whence they do come, to some
of her Majesty's porters, and upon report to be made by them to some one of her
Majesty's privy Counsel, and upon receipt of a Billet from any of the
Counsel, or from any one of the Masters of the Requests in writing, to
license such suter to come into the Castle, in such manner, and with such
servants as the necessity of the suite, and the condition of the suitor shall
require, or otherwise not to be permitted to enter within the gates of the
Court, nor after his suite ended to continue in the Court, upon pain of
imprisonment, and of her Majesty's indignation. Given at the Castle of Windsor,
the fifteen day of September in the xxxv. year of her Majesty's reign.

God save the Queen.
Imprinted by the Deputies of Christopher BARKER, Printer to the Queens most
excellent Majesty.
