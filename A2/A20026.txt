TO THE HONORABLE Assembly of the COMMONS in the present Parliament.
THe Honor, due unto you all,
And reverence, to you each one,
I do first yield most special;
Grant me this time, to hear my moan.
NOW, (if you will) full well you may,
Foul sclaundrous tongues for ever tame;
And help the truth, to bear some sway,
In just defense of a good Name:
Half hundred years, which has had wrong,
By false light tongues, and devilish hate:
O help tryde Truth, to become strong,
So God of Truth, will bless your State.
In sundry sorts, this Sclaunder great,
(Of Coniurer) I have sore blamde:
But wilful, rash, and spiteful heat,
Does nothing cease, to be enflamde.
Your help, therefore, by Wisdoms lore,
And by your Power, so great and sure,
I humbly crave, that never more,
This hellish wound, I shall endure.
And so your An Act general against Sclaunder, and a special penal Order for
John Dee his cas^.
Act, with Honor great,
All Ages will hereafter praise:
And Truth, that sitts in Heavenly seat,
Will, in like case, your Comforts raise.
Most dutifully in all humility at your commandment. John Dee, Servant and
Mathematician to his most royal Majesty.
An. 1604. Iunij 8.
