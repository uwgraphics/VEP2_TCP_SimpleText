By the Queen.
WHere in the Parliament holden at Westminster, the second day of April, in
the xiii. year of the reign of our soueraign Lady the Queen, there was for the
relief of diverse poor decayed towns, and of great multitudes of her poor
subjects, who otherwise were likely to perish, or to become unprofitable and
dangerous to the common weal, among other provided and established, one good
and beneficial statute, entitled, An act for the continuance of making of
cappes. By mean of which statute, great numbers of idle, poor, and impotent
persons were for a season set on work, while the awe of the said statute, and
fear of due execution thereof continued, to the marvelous great commodity of
this Realm, and help of the needy, and redress of ill occupied persons, as
by the experience thereof has been manifestly proved. And whereas nevertheless
by little and little, the disobedience and wanton disorder of evil disposed and
light persons, more regarding private fancy and vanity, then public
commodity or respect of duty, has increased by want of execution of the
said law, whereby those good and honest subjects that have by means of the
said statute, set to work a great number of poor people, are like to be
driven to give over their said trade of making caps, and to send abroad again
into idleness and misery, those multitudes that have been by them relieved:
whereby is likely to grow great enormity and inconvenience, if speedy remedy
therefore be not in time provided. The Queens most excellent Majesty therefore
tenderly considering the premises, straightly charge and commands all
Justices of Assizes, Justices of peace, Majors, Shirifes, Bailiffes, and other
head officers of Cities, Boroughs, and Towns corporate, and the Lord,
Stewards, Bailiffes, and other officers of Leetes, Lawdayes, and liberties, and
all and singular Constables, Third boroughs, Tithingmen, Churchwardens, and all
other her highness subjects, to whom the executing or putting in ure of the
same stature any way may appertayn, that every one of them according to his
office, place, and calling, do their uttermost endeavor for the due execution
of the said statute: and that they the said Bayliffes, Constables,
Thirdboroughs, Tithingmen, Churchwardens, and all other inferior officers, and
every of them, do every Sunday, and festival day, make diligent view and
search in all Churches, Chapels, and al other places within the circuites and
compasses of their offices and authorities, for all and singular breakers and
offenders of the said statute, and without delay cause the names of al such
offenders, and of the parents, gardians, governors, and masters of every
child, servant, and ward, so offending, together with the day and place of the
offense committed, to be then written, and to be lawfully and orderly
presented, at such Assizes, Sessions, or Courts (next after such offenses) as
have authority to enquire or determine the said offenses: And that all Majors,
Shirifes, and Bailifes of Cities, Boroughs and Towns corporate, and all lords
of Leetes, Lawdayes, and Liberties, do immediately upon the proclamation
hereof, call before them all the said Constables, Third boroughs, Tithingmen,
Churchwardens, inferior Bailifs, and all other the abouesaid inferior
officers, that shall be under their charge of government, and them and every of
them forthwith in our names do straightly charge and command, that they, and
every of them, to the uttermost of their powers, do every Sunday and festival
day, make such diligent view and search, and such note also of the names of al
such offenders, and such presentment of all such offenses as is abouesaid: And
that all Justices of Assizes, and Justices of peace in their Circuits and
Sessions, and al Stewards in their Leetes, upon pain of her Majesty's high
displeasure, omit not in any wise from time to time, specially to give in
charge, and cause to be inquired of all offenses against the said statute
committed or to be committed within their several precincts or jurisdictions,
and also do duly hear and determine the same, punishing every of the said
offenders according to the said statute: And that all the said lords and owners
of Leets and Lawdayes do as much as in every of them shall lie, to cause their
stewards thoroughly to execute their office and authority, according to the
same statute, and that upon every such offense found, both the said owners of
Leets, and also the rulers and chief governors of every City, Borough,
Town, or Hamlet, where any such of fence shall be tried and found, shall do
their uttermost endeavor by the Law to recover, have, and obtain of every such
offender, all the penalties to them or any of them, by the said statute
forfeited, or to be forfeited.

God save the Queen.

Queens most excellent Majesty. 1597.
