SEVEN THUNDERS Uttering their Voices, and the Seven LAST TRVMPETS Preparing to
sound in the Spirit of Jealousies, (which is jealous for Sion,) Proclaiming the
great, and notable, and terrible day, of Jehovah the Mighty God of trembling
Isreal's Camp, in which no Flesh shall be saved but for the Elects Sake.
Being an Alarm to all the Inhabitants of the Earth especially to the dwellers
in Sodom and Egypt, and all Inhabiters of Babylon, whose perpetual downfall is
nigh at hand.
THe great and Mighty day of God is appeared, wherein every man's works and
ways, Worships and Religion, Professions and practices, words and actions shall
be declared and made manifest, and tried of what sort soever they be, and none
shall be able to hide himself from the bright Splender of its Glory for God who
is a Consuming fire, is arisen and coming to pass through all, and to try all
with his grounded Staff, and with Battles of Shakings, and woe be to him that
is covered with a Covering, and not of my Spirit says the Lord, For I the
Mighty God am come to judge the World with Equity, and the people with Truth,
and no Weapon formed against my work shall prosper, for I have looked down from
heaven over all the ways, worships, and great professions of Religions amongst
the children of men, and have found the greatest part in falsehood, Hipocrisy,
and Idolatry, and the abomination stands where it ought not in the inward
parts, where I have required Truth and uprightness, and they are bending their
tongues like their bow for lies, and are not valiant for the truth upon Earth,
for which cause my out-streached Arm is Revealed, which shall break in pieces
Nations, even for my seeds sake, and that man or people that will not serve me,
shall utterly perish, I the Lord have spoken it, for I am arisen in my dreadful
power and great Glory, to lay wast all high Mountains, and strong Towers, and
to bring down every fenced Wall and the tall Ceaders, strong Oaks, and
pleasant pictures shall fall down at the shaking of my hand, and I will s^^in
the pride of the Glory of all Flesh, and bring the Honorable into contempt,
and spoil the beauty of the great Whore, which has sat upon Nations, and the
Beast and false Prophet, with all her Merchants, I will plague and torment her;
and they shall know that I am the Lord that searches the heart and tries the
Reins, who will reward every man according to his works.

Therefore all Peoples Kindreds and Nations throughout the whole world (that
lies in wickedness) Awake awake to Righteousness, and stand up in fear and
dread, and tremble yea before the Almighty God, and come out of Babylon, come
out of Babylon, flee, have, and run, for the day of Vengeance is come upon the
Inhabitants of Babylon, it is come as a Snare, as a snare is the day of the
Lord come, and you will not believe it; Arise, arise, stand up yea Armies of
the Alians Gog and Magog, Gomer and his bands, and all the Hosts of the
Philistines, and all you Sodomites, and Ismaelites, that belong to the Coasts
of Egypt and Babylon; The Trumpet of the Almighty God is sounded out of Sion
his holy Mountain; Alarm, alarm, prepare, prepare to the Battle of the great
God, all ye hosts of the Heathen, the standard of his zeal and fury and
Indignation is lifted up against you, and you shall be beaten, and broken, and
scattered and trampled down to dust says the Lord God Almighty: And all you
Bulls of Bashan, you are for the Slaughter, and all you tall Ceaders and strong
Oaks, you are fuel for the fire, and all you senced Walls, you shall be
broaken down, and all you pleasant Pictures you shall be defaced; for a spoiler
is come into all your dwellings and you perceive it not, a fire is kindled, and
you know it not, an Ax is hewing and you hear it not, a sword is drawn and a
bow is bent by the Arms of the Almighty and you see it not, Awake awake you
heathen out of your sleep, and come up to the Valley of Jehosaphat, for the
Almighty God will plead with you there, for he is coming from Bozrah with dyed
garments, and he will trample you in his fury as one that treads upon mortar,
and you shall be as chafe before the whirlewind, all ye Inhabitants of Babylon
Egypt, and Ethiopia, and all you Sodomites, and Edomites; Cry and howl ye
Mountains, tremble ye Oaks and Ceaders, fall down ye fenced Walls, Roar ye
Bulls of Bashan, for the great and dreadful day of the Eternal mighty God is at
hand, which shall be upon every one that is proud and upon every one that is
high and lifted up, and they shall be abased; Therefore hear, hear ye that lie
upon your beds of Ivory, and streach your selves upon your Couches, that chant
at the sound of the Viol, and drink wine in bowls, and are not greived for the
afflictions of Joseph: Even all you that are at ease in unrighteousness, if you
have an ear hear, and if you have an eye, see what you are doing.

For thus says the Lord God, you who are at ease in the ways of ungodliness,
and wickedness, are the afflictors of Joseph, and the opressors of Israel (for
it is written I will lead Joseph like a flock, and I will s^ the Solitary in
families) look ye to it, for I have determined to break in ^^ices the
oppressor, and to bring my Son out of Egypt, what will ye now do ye potsheards?
will ye venture in battle against your maker? shall ye not then be broken to
pieces? am not I a consuming fire and you as brambles, and thorns, and stuble,
before me? (...) what you do, ye ungodly men if you fight against Israel you
shall surely fall* I the Lord have spoken it, for I am arisen as an Eagle that
fluttereth over her young, to defend my people, and my seed shall grow and
prosper and replenish the Earth, and all that strive against them shall be
confounded, would you make void my decree and determinations, and the words
that I have spoken by my prophets since the world began that the seed of the
Woman should bruise the Serpents head (the Dragons power which makes war with
the Lamb, the harmless suffering seed) and did I not say, that the seed of
Abraham, should be as the stars of Heaven, and as the sand of the sea shore for
multitude, and that the Earth should be filled with my knowledge as the waters
cover the Sea; And would you strive to hinder this my unalterable decree? is it
not written, why do the Heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing, the
Kings of the Earth set themselves, and the Rulers take Counsel together against
the Lord, and against his anonited (make that) saying, let us break their bands
assunder, and cast away their Cords from us: Hear ye deaf, and see ye blind,
who are mine anointed, but them who have received the unction from me the Holy
One, which teaches them all things, even my spirit which leads them into all
truth, in which I am coming in ten thousands of my Saints, to reprove and
convince all that are ungodly, of all their ungodly deeds which they have
committed and of their hard speeches which thy have spoken against me: And I
will break in pieces Nations, and give people for their life, therefore touch
not my Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm, but be still ye heathen and know
that I am God, I will be exalted in the earth and my name shall be great in all
Nations, and fears and terrors, misery, and destruction, shall come as a flood
upon all the workers of Iniquity, and my fury as a whirlewinde shall sweep them
away; and Joseph's bough shall spread over the wall, like a fruitful vine; for I
will cast out the Heathen, and plant him for ever, for I am unchangeable, he
that has an ear to hear, let him hear; As I live says the Lord God, I have
sworn by myself, and I will perform it, Jacob shall grow, and Israel shall
increase, and Joseph shall flourish, and they shall fill the face of the whole
Earth, but I will destroy the workers of Iniquity out of it, and root out the
memorial of the ungodly, the seed of the evil doers shall never be renowned;
for I am risen, I am risen as a consuming fire, to make a full end, and my
flame burns even to the top of the Mountains, and my coals in the
foundations of the Hills, and the unfruitful earth shall be devoured with the
fire of my jealousy; I am arisen in the greatness of my strength, to lay wast
to consume and to destroy, the sinners out of it; yea, I am arisen, I am arisen
as a Giant to run his race, refresht with new Wine, and as a mighty man of War,
that shouteth to the Battle, yea I am arisen as the noise of many Thunders, and
as the fierceness of Lightning, and I am crying like a woman in travel, to be
eased of mine Adversaries; yea and my voice shall be terrible to the Nations; I
am arisen, I am arisen, like a Lion out of his thicket, and like an old Lion
that is greedy for the prey.

And like a Lyoness that is bereaved of her whelps, and I will utter my voice,
I will roar, and the earth shall be shaken at the sound thereof: and the
pillars of heaven shall tremble, and the sea shall roar, and be troubled at the
noise of my dreadful thunders, with which I will thunder upon the wicked, yea,
I am arisen to take vengeance, to avenge, to give a recompense, to render
judgments and indignation, plague upon plague, torment upon torment, thunders
upon thunders, vialls upon vials, wrath upon wrath, earthquake, upon
earthquake, trumpet after trumpet, war upon war, blood upon blood, slain upon
slain, heap upon heaps. Therefore, hear, fear, quake and tremble, all ye
workers of iniquity, houl, lament, and roar, and be ye horribly astonished, ye
heathen that are at ease for behold I am risen to plead with all flesh, yea I
will plead with you all from the highest to the lowest for I have remembered my
seed which you have long oppressed, yea their cry is come into mine ears and
has moved my bowels toward them, which burns against you ye hard-hearted and
rebellious for my determination is to make a full end of iniquity,
transgression and sin, and no flesh shall stand in opposition against me, who
am a consuming fire.

For behold I am coming in ten thousands of my saints, yea in thousands of
thousands, of those poor people which have been long as trodden down, peeled,
robbed and spoiled, even of those (whom the scorners of this world, have termed
Quakers) that trembles at my word, they are them with whom I will fill the
world with Cities, when the transgressors are destroyed out of it; therefore
hear O my peole that tremble at my word, thus says your eternal mighty God,
JEHOVAH is my name, fear ye not the fury of the Adversary and the Oppressor,
though death and hell, the sea and the grave pursue you; they must arise and
will arise against you, (O my people (that are poor and contrite in spirit) but
fear them not, for the day hastens (as the woman that is near the time of her
delivery) in which death, hell, the sea and the grave, must give up all that in
them is, and death and hell shall be cast into the lake that burns for ever
and ever, and all this ungodliness, Idolatry, and darkness that is now arisen,
or can yet arise, I will trample in mine anger, yea I will tread it down down,
down, into the pit, into the bottomless pit, whence it shall no more rise up
for ever, yea I will set them down with the great Dragon, I will set them all
down that rise up against you (O my poor and despised people) therefore fear
them not neither be afraid of their snares, gins, or traps, which they have, or
shall set, or make to catch the sheep of my pasture (which are men) for I have
determined to break them and their snares with them, and they shall know that
ye are my people, and that I the mighty Jehovah of Israel am your God, that is
my name amongst you this day, for I will plead with all flesh, and it shall
fall before me: Therefore fear not their Kings nor their Princes, their
Parliaments nor their Rulers, for I will trample upon Kings and Princes as upon
Mortar in this the day of my fury. But trust in my name and in it dwell for
ever, for in my name is everlasting strength, and take you no thought how all
this dark power of superstition, Idolatry, and madness shall be subdued, for I
the mighty Jehovah, the God of trembling Isreal's Camp, will break their
Idolatrous worship and dash their Idols, (on which they are made*) to pieces,
and none of their Kings, nor their Princes, their Bishops, nor their Rulers,
shall deliver them, nor themselves from the stroke of my hand.

Therefore be still O my people, in the clift of the Rock of my power and dwell
quietly in my everlasting strength (O my despised) for the Harvest of the glory
of my Seed is very near, for I am now dividing of Wheat from the Tares and the
Chafe, the Sheep from the Goats, the clean from the unclean, throughout all
the Nations o^ the Earth, And my mighty Angels stands ready with their Golden
Trumpets to give the last sound through the whole Creation for the Resurrection
of the dead; And I have prepared another Angel which stands ready after them to
cry with a loud voice, he that is Holy let him be holy still, and he that is
Filthy let him be filthy still, for time shall be no longer, but all that live
and abide shall dwell in Eternity, Amen Halelujah, even so come, O Lord Jesus
says the bride, and him that is a thirst says come quickly Amen Halelujah,
Glory in the highest Amen.

Because thy time is short O Satan do thou rage
As if the Ocean deep, thy malice could not swage,
But be it known to thee Leviathan,
My hook shall bring thee down, within a span,
For with my hand, in the Pit I will the seal,
Thy rage on Earth no more shall thou reveal;
This is my purpose, and my just decree,
To raise my Holy seed, and make an end of thee.
Which from the Serpent came, the Dragon and the Beast,
That all my whole Creation, for ever be at rest.
ALL people who have any honest desires toward the living God, his Truth and
Righteousness, make have and flee out of Babylon, and come into the Light of
the Lord, that you may see his Controversy with her, and be Redeemed from all
Iniquity, and declare in Sion the vengeance of the Lord against her, for his
plagues and vials of wrath, are coming on Babylon like hail, and the swift
Arrows of the Almighty are entered into her bowels, Therefore, woe, woe to the
Inhabitants of the Earth (that will not come unto the name of the Lord) because
of the Plagues and judgments which are yet to come, some woes are past, but
there are many other to come suddenly, Blessings, and Honor, and Glory, unto
him who lives and Reigns for ever and for ever more Amen.

The stout hearted are spoiled, they slept their Sleep,
