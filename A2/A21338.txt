Maid Emlyn and one of her cuckolded husbands

Will ye here of meruaylles
Drawn out of gospelles
Of maid Emlynne
That had husbands five
And all did never thryue
She could so well spynne
Loving to go gaye
And seldom for to pray
For she was borne in Lynne
Often would she seek
The tauernes in the weke
Till her wit was thynne
Full swetely would she kys
With galauntes ywys
And say it was no sin
Thus collynge in arms
Some men caught harms
Full little did they win
And if her husband said ought
Look what she sonest cought
At his heed she would it flynge
She would lay lorell thou
I will teache the I trow
Of thy language to blynne
It is pity that a knave
A pretty woman should have
That knows not gold from tynne
I trow thou Ialouse be
Between my cosyn and me
That is called sir Sym
Though I go often thither
We do naught together
But prycked balades sing
And I so cunning be
The more worship is to the
Gyuynge thank to him
For he me first taught
So I my cunning caught
When I went a brosshynge
With such words douse
This little pretty mouse
The young lusty prymme
She could byte and whyne
When she fawe her time
And with a pretty gynne
Give her husband an horn
To blow with on the morn
Beshrowe her white skin
And often would she sleke
To make smothe her cheke
With red roses therein
Than would she mete
With her lemman sweet
And cut with him
Talking for their pleasure
That cock with the fether
Is gone an hunting
Himself all alone
To the wode he is gone
To here the kockowe sing
Thus with her playfere
Makes she merry chere
The husband knows nothing
She gives money plente
Because new love is daynte
Unto her swetynge
And prays often to come
To play there as shyneth no son
So at the next metynge
She gives her husband a prycke
That made him double quycke
So good was the gretynge
Kocke called of the bone
That never was master at home
But as an vnderlynge
His wife made him so wise
That he would turn a penny twyse
And than he called it a ferthynge
Nothing byleued he
But that he did with his eyes se
Full true was his meaning
She cherysshed him with bread and chese
That his life he did lose
Than made she mourning
And drank devoutly for his soul
The handbell often did she colle
Full great sorrow making
This sorry wydowe
But a while I trow
Mourning did make
When he was gone
A young lusty one
She did than take
Long would she not tarry
Lest she did myscary
But full often spoke
To have the wedding
And all for beddynge
Some sport to make
Her heart to ease
And the flesh to please
Sorrows to aslake
In it out Ioyenge
That wanton playenge
For the old husbands sake
yet by your leave
A friar did she give
Of her love a flake
And said in her oven
At any manner of season
That he should bake
There is rome ynowe
For other and for you
And space to set a cake
The second husband Nycoll
That pore sely sonle
Might not escape
A kockolde to dye
It was his destenye
As man unfortunate
His wife undevout
Often would go about
And step over many a lake
Making bost in her mode
That her husband can no more good
Than can an untaught ape
Thus by her scole
Made him a fool
And called him dodypate
So from his thryfte
She did him lift
And thereof creste the date
She made him sad
And said he was badde
Crooked legged like a stake
She lyked not his face
And fayd he mouthed was
Most like an hawke
This good man case
Was loathe to dysplease
But yet thought somewhat
Thinking in his mind
That a man can find
A wife never to late
For of their properte
Shrewes all they be
And slyle can they prate
All women be such
Though the man here the breche
They will be ever checkemate
Faced like an angel
Tonged like a devil of hell
Great causers of debate
They look full smothe
And be false of love
Venymous as a snake
Desiring to be praised
A lofte to be raised
As an high estate
And these wanton dames
Often changes their names
As An / Jane / Besse and Kate.
Thus thinks he
In his mind pryuely
And naught dare say
For he that is maysterfast
Full often is aghast
And dare not run and play
If she be glad
Than is he sad
And fere of a sudden fraye
For woman's pride
Is to laughe and chyde
Every hour in a day
When she does loure
And begins to snowre
Pyteously does he say
What do ye lack
Any thing sweet heart
That I to you give may
She answered him
With words grotchynge
Wysshynge her self in claye
And says that she lackes
Many pretty knackes
As bedes and gyrdels gaye
And the best sport
That should me comfort
Which is a sweet play
I can it not have
For so god me save
Thy power is not to pay
There is naught
Naught may be cought
I can no more say
Many men now here
Can not women chere
But makes often delay
The wife does moan
It is not at home
And boroweth till a day
What it is I trow
Well enough ye know
It is no need to say
Thus say the wives
If their husbands thryues
That they the causers be
They get two ways
Both with work and plays
By their huswyuery
With their sweet lyppes
And lusty hyppes
They work so plesauntly
Some will fall anon
For they be not strong
They be weyke in the kne
Be they pore or be they rich
I beshrewe all such
A men now say ye
They think it is as great alms
As to say the seven psalms
And does it for charity
To get gowns and furs
These nysebeceturs
Of men she weth their pity
Sometime for their lust
Have it they must
Or seek will they be
If it do stycke
And she feel it quycke
Full slyle does she
Begin for to groan
And wyssheth she had line alone
What ayleth you than says he
She says sir I am with child
It is yours by Mary mylde
And so he weneth it be
When played is the play
Jack the husband must pay
This daily may ye se
He was glad ywys
Of that that is not his
And does it up keep
She that does mock him
A another man's concubyne
And his child eke
Lo thus does lands
Fall in wrong airs hands
The causers may well weep
And worse does happen truly
The brother the sister does mary
And in bed together sleep
To sin syghtely will the child draw
That is bekoten without law
Wedlock is very sweet
But ones for all
The day come shall
The cry shall be welawaye
Of all wedlock brekers
Thus says great prechers
Their dettes shall they truly pay
All they that does offend
Goo grant them to amend
And therefore let us pray.
But now of Emlyne to speak
And more of her to treat
Truly for to say
When the second husband was deed
The third husband did she wedde
In full goodly array
But as the devil would
Or the pyes were cold
Fell a sudden fraye
Moses had a new brother
It would be none other
And all came thorughe play
But maid maydenhode missing
Knows what longs to kissing
It is no need to say
She loved well I trow
And gave him sorrow ynowe
But ones on the day
With him would she chyde
He durst not look aside
The bound must ever okaye
This man was old
And of compleccyon cold
Nothing lusty to play
She was full rank
And of condycyons cranke
And ready was always
In Venus toys
Was all her Joys
Seldom said she nay
At the last she thought
That her husband was naught
And purposed on a day
To shorten his life
And as a true wife
She would it not delay
Maid Emlyn.
To fulfill her lust
In a well she him thrust
Without any fraye
And made countenance sad
As though she be sorry had
Also in good faye
A reed onyon would she keep
To make her eyes weep
In her kerchers I say
She was than steadfast and strong
And kept her a wydowe veraye long
In faith almoost two days
Because she made great moan
She would not lie long alone
For fere of sudden frayes
Lest her housbande deed
Would come to her bed
Thus in her mind she says.
The fourth housbande she cought
That was like her next naught
For he used his plays
With maidens wives and nonnes
None amysse to him commes
Like they be of lays
Him she lyked ill
She prayed the fend him kill
Because he used her ways
This man's name was harry
He could full clean carry
He loved pretty gayes
So it happened at the last
An halfepeny halter made him fast
And therein he swayes
Than she took great thought
As a woman that cares naught
So for his soul she prays
And because she was seek
She wedded the same weke
For very pure pity and woe
yet or she was wedded
Chryse had she bedded
And great have made thereto
The husband had sone ynowe
But Emlyn bended her browe
And thought she had not so
But to ease her lover
She took another
That lustely could do
One that young was
That could often her basse
Which she had fantesy to
He could well away
With her lusty play
And never would have do
Because he could clepe her
She called him a whypper
And as they were together
They both swetely played
A sergeaunt them afraid
And said they were full queuer
They were than full woe
The friar would ben a go
He cursed that he came thither
Whether they were leave or loathe
He set them in the stocks both
He would none dysceyuer
In mids of the market
Full well was set
In full fair wether
For it did hayle and thunder
On them many men did wonder
But Emlyne laughed ever
She thought it but a Iape
To se men at her gape
Thereof she shamed never
And said for her sporting
It is but for Iapynge
That we be brought hyder
It is another treason nor felony
But a knacke of company
And dye had I lever
Than it forsake
For I will merry make
While youth has fair wether
When her husband it knew
Sore did he it rewe
And was so heavy and woe
He took a surfeit with a cup
That made him turn his heles up
And than was he a go
And when she was at large
Care she did dyscharge
And in her mind thought tho
Now will I have my lust
With all them that will Just
In spyte of them that says so
And because she loved riding
At the stews was her abiding
Without words mo
And all that would enter
She durst on them ventre
Very gentle she was lo
And long or she were deed
She went to beg her bread
Such fortune had she tho
God did beat her surely
With the rod of pouerte
Or she did hens go
Than she dyed as ye shall
But what of her did befall
Nay there do I ho
But they that read this erly or late
I pray Jesus their souls take
Amen say ye also.
