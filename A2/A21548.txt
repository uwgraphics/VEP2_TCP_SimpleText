By the Queen,
WHere the Queen's most excellent Majesty has lately concluded a marriage to
the honor of almighty God, and the weal and benefire of her graces realms
and subjects, with the most high and mighty Prince, the Prince of Spain:
Her highness considering the lightness and evil disposition of diverse lewd and
sediciouse persons, who sekyng always novelties, and being seldom
contented with their present state, might per adventure at this time by their
naughty and disordred behavior attempt to stir discord, and give occasion
to break the good and friendly agreament, that ought to be nourished and
continued between the subjects of this realm, and such as shall come in with
the said most noble Prince, has thought good to signify unto all her
faithful and loving subjects, that like as already order is taken, on the
behalf of the said most noble Prince, that all such, either of his own, or
of any other nation, as shall attend upon him self, or any of his train, at
their coming hither, shall in their behavior use themselfes honestlyfrendely,
and quietly toward her highness subjects, of all sorts and degrees, without
giuynge any manner just occasion of trouble or discontentation to any person
for their parts: even so does her hyghnes streyghtly charge and command al
and singular her loving subjects, of what estate, degree, or condition soever
they be, that they and every of them do semblablye, for their parts, use all
such strangers, as shall repair hither, with, or to the said most noble
Prince, or any of his train, with curtoyse, frendely, and gentle
enterteynement, without ministryng toward them any manner cause of strife or
contention, either by outward deeds, tauntyng, words, unseemly countenance,
or by any other ways or means, whereby lack of frendeshyppe or good will
might be conceived.

And further streyghtly charge and commands all and singular noble men and
gentlemen, within this her graces said realm, that they and every of them do
each one for his part take such order with their servants and others,
attendyng upon them, and do give unto them such straight warnyng and charge,
as neither by themselfes, nor by any other means they do presume to attempt
either directly or indirectly, to break this her highness order and
commandment, or any ways to trouble, disquiete, or give occasion of quarrel
to any of the said most noble Princes train, upon pain, that whosoever shall
by word or deed neglecte this her graces pleasure, or do contrary to the same,
shall not only incur her Majesty's high displeasure and indignation, but
also be committed to prison without bail or maynprise, to abide there such
further punishment, either by fine or otherwise, as shall be thought agreeable
to the quality of his or their offenses, and may serve for an example to
other like disordred persons.

God save the Queen.
