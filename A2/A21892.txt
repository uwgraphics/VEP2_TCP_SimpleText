By the Queen.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty being certainly informed of diverse great
spo^^es made of the goods lade^ in a Spanish Carraque lately brought to
P^rtmouth in Devonshire, and the same conveyed secretly on land to certain
parts of the Realm, as well in Devonshire, as to the City of London, and
other Ports and Creekes, and there dispersed and unlawfully bought by sundry
Merchants and Brokers, to the maniseft breach of her Majesty's laws, and to
the robbing of her Majesty of her royal Customs and Subsidies: has thought
it most necessary to cause reformation hereof to be made with speed, and the
offenders to understand what punishment is due to them, if they shall not
speedily discover and restore the said goods. And therefore her Majesty
straightly charge and commands all manner of persons that have taken out or
received any manner of goods of any value out of the said Carraque, either while
she was on the Seas, or since her coming into the haven of Dertmouth, though
the same been taken in the name of pillage, (which was not lawful to be done
by the laws of the Realm, and the laws of the Sea, until the whole lading
were brough into the Port) that they do within ten days after this
Proclamation published in any City, Port, Town or County, discover and make
known to they principal Officer of the place where they shall reside, and
diliuer the same to the said Officer to be certified to her Maiestice orher
Counsel, or to show where, and to whom they have sold, given, or delivered the
same. And in such case her Majesty charge all Merchants, Goldsmiths,
Iewellers, Seamen, and all other persons that have bought or received any of
the said goods in like sort, within the said time, to discover and deliver the
same, and to declare of whom, and by what means they have received the same
without any respect of any money paid, or bonds given for payment thereof. And
like wise her Majesty charge all In-keepers or other Householders, or Owners
of any vessels upon the Sea, where any person shall come with any carriage,
wherein there may be suspicion, that any portion of the commodities taken in
the said Carraque shall be bestowed, that the same Householder or Master of any
vessel, shall forth with give notice to the next public Officer thereof, to
cause the same to be stayed and certisied to any person appointed as a
Commissioner about the charge of the said Carraque, or to any of the privy
Counsel. And all these her Majesty's several commandments she wills to be
observed upon pain of imprisonment without batle of the offender, and further
pimisdment against such so have robbed the said Carraque, and their abbetters
and accessaries, as in cases of Felonies. And furthermore her Majesty wills
it to be known to all persons, who by reason of their Consort of Adventure in
this late service wherein the Carraque was taken, shall claim any portion out
of ye goods of the said Carraque, that if it may be proved yt they have taken
or bought any thing out of the said Carraque before the bringing and the view
of her by her Majesty's Commissioners at Dertmouth, without revealing the same
to her Majesty or to her Commissioners, they are by the law to lose all the
benefit that they might claim for their adventure. And to ye intent that no
Mariner or Soldier, or other that have adventured themselves about taking of
the same Carraque should be discouraged in withdrawing from him that which
lawfully is to be accounted pillage, her Majesty minds upon first
discovering to her Commissioners of that which any has taken by name of
pillage, the same shall be considered how far forth it is to be indged
pillage, and thereof shall have allo wance besides their due wages, with all
lawful favor: but without the discovery thereof to the Officers of the Port
where they do first arrive, they neither ought to enjoy any thing by name of
pillage, nor yet to have allo wance of wages, or thirds, or such like, but by
the laws of the Sea are punishable for concealing of every thing so taken. And
as her Majesty has thought meet at this time to publish these her
commandments, especially upon ye notorious spoils presently made out of this
Carraque, so does she command the like prohibitions and commandments to be
observed, upon like pains for all manner of spoils committed upon any other
prises taken on the Stas this Summer past, and for time to come does also
command the same to be observed in the taking of any ship of any ship of any
Enemy as a prise, to forbear from all spoils, and not to take any thing out
of any prise, until the same be brought, viewed, and searched by the Officers
of the Ports, whereby her Majesty may have her due Customs, and other persons
their duties, and the takers of the prises their portions due to them.

Given at the City of Oxenford the 23. day of September 1592. in the 34. year
of her Majesty's reign.

Queens most excellent Majesty. 1591.
