By the King.
THe Solemnities of our Coronation being now performed according to the vsages
and customs of this our Realm of England, and with mutual contentment,
as well of Us in the zeal and love of our people at the performance thereof
expressed, as of them in the expectation of our government; We have entered into
consideration of the state of the several parts of the body of our Realm, And
therein do find, that the absence of the Noblemen and Gentlemen which are used
to reside there in several quarters, is accompanied with great inconvenience,
as well in the want of relief which the poorer sort did receive by their
ordinary Hospitality, as also chiefly in the defect of Government, whereby
besides other inconveniences, through lack of order, the infection of the
Plague spreads and scatters it self into diverse places of the Realm, and
is like further to increase, if by the presence and care of such as are in
authority and creadit amongst our people, they be not contained in some good
course, for the preventing of that contagion.

Wherefore having taken order for the returning home into their Countries of
diverse of the Nobility of our Nation of Scotland, and others also, who to do
us honor at our Coronation, have attended here since the entering of Us and the
Queen our dear wise into this Kingdom: We have thought good also to publish
to all other good Subjects of this Realm, that our Pleasure is, and we command
that all such as are not our Servants in Ordinary, or be not bound to
attendance about our Court by express commandment of Us, or our Council,
shall immediately depart home into their Countries; Specially all Deputy
Lieutenants, and all such as are in Commission of the Peace, there to attend
their several charges, and chiefly to prevent by all good means the spreading
of this Contagion of the Plague. For seeing now there is no necessary cause why
any man should abide either about our City of London, or about our Court, who
is not our ordinary Servant, We shall have just cause to be offended with such,
as shall contrary to this our Pleasure, voluntarily absent themselves from the
places where their duties do require they should abide.

And whereas We are given to understand, That notwithstanding our former
Proclamation, there do continually hang upon our Court, a great number of idle
and masterlesse persons, as well Scottissh as English, who can give no account
of their abode here: For preventing hereof our Pleasure is, That all Noblemen
and Gentlemen our ordinary servants or attendants in Court, shall presently
within three days after the publishing hereof, deliver in to our Chamberlain,
to the Officers of our Greencloth, and to our Knight Marshal, to each of them a
Roll of the names of such as be their servants in ordinary, wherein We require
them to have care to receine no more then they must needs be served with: With
which Roll We have given charge, that the said Knight Marshall shall
continually ride, both in the day time and in the night about our Court, and
whomsoever they shall sinde not centeined in the said Roll, they shall punish
according to the Laws of our Realm, or otherwise as shall be thought meet
for such contempts. And for that our pleasure also is, during the time of this
Infection, That our Court be not followed with unnecessary multitudes under
pretense of Suites, We do charge all Suitors to abstain from following of us
for this time, saving only such as have Suits, or cause of attendance of our
Council for necessary services. For the discerning whereof, We have appointed,
that the Masters of our Requests, or one of them, with one of the Clearkes of
our Council, or of our Signet, shall reside at Kingston till Wednesday next, of
purpose to receive the Petitions of all such as suppose they have any necessary
cause to attend for the service at the Court, and shall allow such as they
shall see cause why for our service they should be pursued, and all others
defer till the Winter: And after that day passed no Suitor shall be allowed
to follow the Court, upon what pretense soever, during this Contagion.

Given at our Honor of Hampton the nine and twentieth day of July 1603, in the
first year of our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the
seven and thirtieth.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
