(...) There hearts ware so toted in the popes laws
They begane the last year when they slew body
All England reioysethe at there over throwse
For only the Lord is our Kings victory
They had falce prophets which brought thiges to pass
Clean contrary to there own expectacion
There hope was for help in there popish mass
They would needs have hanged up a reseruacion
The vicare of pon wdstoke with his cou^geracio^
Commaned them to stick to there Idolatry
They had much provision and great preperacion
Yet God has given our King the victory
They did tobe and spoule all the Kings friends
They called them heritekes with spite and disdain
They roffled a space like titante? and Finds
They put some in preson and sum to great pain
And sum fled a way or else they had been slain
As was Wyllam hilling that marcer truly
Which they killed at sandford mowre in the plain
Where yet god has given our King the victory
They Came to plu^mo with the Kings trnstty town
