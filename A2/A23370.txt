An excellent History both pithy and pleasant, Discoursing On the life and
death of Charles and Iulia, two British, or rather Welshe lovers. No less
delightful for variety, then tragical in their misery, not hurtful to
youth, nor unprofitable to age, but commodious to both. By W. A.

Imprinted at London for Edward White, dwelling at the little North door of S.
Paul's Church, at the sign of the Gun. 1581.

To the worshipful and his most approved friend, Master Henry Campyon: W.
A. wishes health and wealth of body, quietness and contentation of mind, in
this life fullness of felicity, and in the life eternal true tranquillity.
Having taken some pains (Woorshipfull Sir) to reduce this History into
sauorie verse, and taking Pen in hand to present you with the simple Dedication
of the same, the gravity of your person, suddenly encountered my rash attempt,
with such a hot assault of misdoubte, that I was forced to make a hasty retire
into the Castle of deeper consyderation, and having pondered with my self that
the wise and painful Be, sucketh Honny sometimes out of the wastefull weed,
I gathered your Worship to have the like discresio^ in reading, that the Be
has in choosing, and therefore I thought it not amiss, imitating the
Physician, to mingle sometimes poison amidde the pure Treackle, thereby to
drive out one Nail with another, so that notwithstanding, my young brain do
yield green fruit, to the taste of your mellowed years: yet being used
well, it may redound both to your pleasure and profit. Though the green Apple
being (...), breeds crude and rotten (...) well roasted, it hurts not the
stomach, your Worship having now passed the fiery heat of youth, may in the
happy state, of your luckie age, sit and smile at the vain baight of
affections, which over rules the sway of youthful minds, and sighe at the
sins which you were subject to, in the unsteadfast state of that unconstant
age, which you shall aptly behold in these two lovers, by reading the contents
of this my simple verse. Esteem the some I beseech you not as a requital of
your deserts (which are many;) but as a remembrance of my good will (which is
great) though my abillity be small, who being so deeply and diversely indetted
to your worship, thought every day a year, till some fruit of thankfulness did
appear to spring, from the ground of my well willing mind. Thus committing
you to the taste of these my simple Cates, which I wish as much to please your
appetite in reading, as they did disease me in writing, I leave you to the
tuition of the almighty, who grant to you and yours, more joys then I can
wish, and yet my wishes more then I can perform.

Yours in all freendely sort to command. W. Auerell.

To the courteous and freendly Reader.
GEntle reader, I shall not need with superfluous praises to commend unto
thee, either the pleasure or profit thou may take in perusing this strange
and lamentable History, let the meat be seen in the man, the Tree in his
fruit, the Flower in his sent, the cloth in his wool, and the Wine in his
taste, Nam vino vendibili nihill opus est suspensa haedera, which being
saleable, needs no Iuie Garlande, yet herein may thou see the vanity of
youth, the corruption of nature, the unsteadfastness of Fortune, the
faithfulness of freendship: but especially the punishment, that God shows
upon those wanton children, which without consent of their Parents minds, from
whom they had their bodies, do stubernely, or at least wise foolishly knit
that knot, which the advice of their Parents should most fyrmelye fasten,
running rashlye upon the Rocks of their own ruin, and sinking in the Sands
of their own seeking, to the auoydinge of which inconveniences I have penned
for thy delight this Historye, of two British or rather Welsh loouers, whose
amorous affections I have somewhat lover like depaynted, not that I bring Oil
to maintain the light of Venus lamp, but with the saciety thereof quight to
extinguish her flame, that Loouers perusing the wanton contracts of these two
Venus darlings, may by the fulsomenesse of their strange events, be driven
into disliking of so vain a pastime, or rather a madness, which alters the
mind, changes the body, peruerteth reason, subuerteth wisdom, expels
joy, and brings with it more pounds of pain, then drams of delight, these
affections, or otherwise infections, may thou (courteous Reader) perceive
both one and other in the sequel of this discourse, which may peradventure in
the eyes of some, seem ouerwanton, and more worthy a Faggot to burn it, then
a Candell to read it, but the garment is not to be cast away, that is fretted
with some Mothes, the Rose is not to be rejected for his sharp prickelles: nor
the Tree to be rooted up, whose fruit is somewhat wormeaten, seeing they all
may serve both for pleasure and commodity, neither is this discourse to be
discommended, either for the grosenesse of the Theme being love, or for the
effeminacy of the persons being lovers, seeing both the one and the other
are esteemed and practiced among those whose heaires are not so graye with age,
but their hearts are as green in lust, that drawing even again to their
former Childehood, yet can spell A. M. O. when they have one foot on the
ground, and the other in their grave. But wishing unto such more grace, and to
the younger sort more gravity: I conclude, referring thy judgment to the view
of this my rude description, craving thee to suspend thy verdyt, till thou have
considered the end, and then not despise my labor, which I have attempted for
thy only pleasure, least I may say justly of thee. Ego volens laboraui, et tu
improbe sycophantaris, and thus desiring thee to bear both with the Printers
faults and mine, which he has committed by unwariness, and I by weariness, I
end, excusing my self with that old Verse of the Poet, In opere longo fas est
obrepere somnum, and so I commit this treatise to thy learned correction, and
thy self to the almighties protection, whom I beseech to guide thee.

Farewell.
The Argument.
HOw Lord Aeneas did depart from Troy,
and wandering long, ariu'de on Itaile cost:
And won Lauinia to his spoused joy,
though Fortune fell, his mind in turmoiles tossed.
How Brutus did within this I Will ariue,
and dying did divide the same in three:
How Lovers twain, in boiling flames did strive,
to join their hearts in linckes of amytie.
How fates did frown, before they could possess,
their wished wills, which they did long desire:
And yet obtainde, their sorrows were no less,
then when they fried in flames of Cupids fire
How rufully they both did end their days,
to the distress of Parents doleful minds:
These things at large, this Story plain displaies,
as who so reads, full strange in sequel finds.
The tragical History of Charles and Iulia.
WHen glorious Greeks by conquest got,
had spoiled Phrigian feeldes:
And vaunting home with victory,
upon their shining Sheeldes.
When flashing flames of flakie fire,
had Pryames pride oppressed:
And Troyan Towers by greedy Greeks,
of pride were dispossessed.
The prick of praise, the stagge of Fame,
that hight Aeneas he:
(Whom Poets feign Anchises son,
and Venus Boy to be.)
Preparde his Ship to seek the soil,
which he by fate should find:
Yet being galde with gripes of grief,
he thus lamentes in mind.
O frowning froward Fortune fell,
that kingdoms do subuart:
Whose whyrling wheel of fickle force,
does hate the hawtie heart.
Thou bendst thy brows with lowering looks,
to hear of men's good hap:
He suppes the sauce of sower relief,
that lulles him in thy lap.
Thy fawning face, thy fleering smyles,
thy traynes intyste our trust:
To think no feats of forrayne force,
could drown our deeds in dust.
Our Ilon brave was once the flower,
and chief of Asia soil:
But lawless lust of Paris life,
has brought thy spiteful spoil.
O Letcher lewd we may lament,
O Helen we may rewe:
For Paris prankes, and thine untruth,
our sorrows do ensewe.
O would the Woolues with gaping jaws,
as soon as thou wast borne:
With tearing teeth and clasping claws,
had thee in pieces forne.
Then Troyan Towers had safely stood,
and Infantes life preseru'de:
Then hautie Hectors head had not,
with traitors knife been caru'de.
Dephobus, Trouetus, Polites,
with Fame had yet remaynd:
Nor Polixenas blood the grave,
of Achillus had been staynd.
Then Pirhus had not wrought his will,
with Priams aged bones:
To blotte with blood and ashes fine,
hye Jove his Alter stones.
Thy Princely Palace finely framde,
and glazde with glittering gold:
Had escaped the scathe of furious foes,
which force of fire did fold.
Our Armors had not been berayd,
with blood of gushing veins:
Nor strouting streams had smeard ye streets,
with heaps of dead men's brains.
Our Temples and our sturdy gates,
had not with toil been torn:
Ne should the Soil which sucked up blood,
have made such sprouting Corn.
These greefes and groans had we escapt,
had Paris lost his life:
As Sages sad by learned lore
did will, to stint our strife.
But Pryam oh, I rue thy case,
and Troy I thee lament:
Whose ripe renown and rife report,
was through the world Isprent.
By chippes of chance thou chosen wast,
to fifty children Sire:
And yet ere death decreed thy doom,
they did their ends aspyre.
Thy sons thus slain, thy self alas,
wast halde by hoarie hair:
To sacred Temple, where thy corpse
was crasde with spytefull spear.
Thy Queen, and daughter Cassandra.
as Captives both were taken:
And for the gain of greedy gold,
thy seely son was slain.
O wretched King, whose banefull Boy,
has thus destroyde us all:
And on our Regions, Realms, and Towns,
has forste this fatal fall.
O Tenedos, that lent our loss,
whose sturdie Oaks were squarde:
To work our wrong by wicked wyles,
which guilefull Greeks preparde.
Whose hautie Horse procurde our harms,
that did no danger doubt:
Till outward show of Sacrifice,
had brought our bane about.
Yea, through thy groans did grow our grief
whose shade did shroude their sight:
That when we thought their Nauies gone,
they straight returned with might.
Cassandras sawes, we small esteemde,
who Prophesied our shame:
And said, the cause of all our care,
should be a Grecian Dame.
When Paris went to Greece she said.
O Brother do retire:
You little know you go to fetch,
great flames of flashing fire.
Laacons words eke warnde our woe,
his Spear against Horse he thrust:
And said, you Troyans take good heed,
how you this timber trust.
Much canckred craft contriu'de there is,
within this wily work:
For in the compass of this Cave,
the guilefull Greeks do lurk.
O that the ground had been my grave,
when vytall breath I took:
Or that before this doleful day,
my life had me forsook.
Then should not I have seen our Towers,
consumde with fiery flames:
Nor Infantes slain at Mothers breasts,
with spoil of modest Danies.
Then should not I have seen the blood,
like Rivers read to run:
Nor wretched Fathers loose their lives,
each by his murdered son.
The hoarie heads with silver hairs,
were pearst with Grecians darts:
That flowing floods of luke warm blood,
did gushe from out their hearts.
There might be seen, both head and arms,
with many a lusty lym:
Being borne above the bloody brooks,
in swelling streams to swym.
I saw, I saw, that grieved me most,
my Coosin Hectors corse:
Whose bloody corpse amyd the streets,
did move me to remorse.
To aged Pryam being alive,
his body then I gave:
That he might have the right renown,
and honor of his grave.
What heart so hard but must lament,
to view this great annoy:
Alas, I can no longer stay,
I must depart from Troy:
O Troy adieu, I wayle thy woes,
I mourn thy heavy plight:
Thou wast not wun by manly force,
but by Ulysses slight.
My Country, Kinsmen, and my friends,
though tears like Seas do swell:
Yet dead, or living, now at last,
I bid you all farewell.
Farewell, thou fertile Phrigian soil,
where Troy sometime did stand:
Thy walls are waste, thy wealth is worn.
adieu my native Land.
WHen sighs and sobs had sokte his heart,
and tears were wasted well:
With moving mind he seeks the soil,
which fates to him did tell.
To sea ward then with Son and Sire,
he frames with journey fast:
With Country goods, and Relics brave*
he hyes in all the haste.
His Navy ready lay at road,
the Troyans to convey:
In dreadful doubt, and dangers deep,
they took their weary way.
Charibdis gulf, and Scillas sands,
with safety they did pass
Yet seven years space the foming floods,
their let of harbor was.
As houering thus in hope they lay,
at last Aeneas spies:
A Haven for to shrowde their Ship,
from hoarie Hyems eyes:
And lyghting now on luckie land,
he found it Carthage new:
Whose Princely Ports so finely framde,
did glad his eyes to view.
Where dainty Dido was addressed,
the Prince to entertayne:
Beseeching of this Troyan Knight,
with her for to remain.
He waying not of her good will,
preparde him self with speed:
To look this Land, the which by lot,
the fates for him decreede.
When sturdy storms, and striving streams,
when tossing tides were spent:
At last on Lauyne coast he lands,
though Iunos brows were bent.
And in Italia he remaynes,
Lauinia was his Wife:
Of whom he got a worthy son,
and then departed life.
Which Julius Siluius had to name,
that Alba Longa built:
Of whom Siluius Brutus came,
that Fathers life has spylt.
For which mischaunce he banished was,
and in this I Will aryu'de:
Wherein he got three worthy sons,
or death his life depryu'de.
Yet or the Sisters did agree,
his twist for to untwine:
He made division of this Land,
and then was laid in Shrine.
To Locrins lot, the East part fell,
the other Albanact had:
And Camber gouernde worthy Wales,
whereof he was full glad.
These Princes each possessed their place,
and did this Land defend:
Till Atropos with caruing knife,
her Sisters web did end.
Then Cambria was two Lordships large,
two Lords possessed the same:
Of whom, as Stories make record,
they were of worthy fame.
In Anglesie the one did reign,
sir Gaulfride stout he hight:
The other Owen had to name,
in Flint he ruled by right.
This Gaulfride had one son calde Charles,
a Lad of lusty lym:
And Owen had a Daughter dear,
in beauty like to him.
This Charles Dame Nature had bedeckt,
with goodly gifts of grace:
That all the Art which she could use,
she planted in his face.
His flowing tongue Apollo taught,
such sugared speech to frame:
(His stature was so seemly set)
as none can tell the same.
Full twenty years he was of age,
his Beard began to grow:
Then time in him by rare aspectes,
great wisdom seemd to show.
Her name was gentle Iulia,
whose blazing beauty bright:
Like splendaunt Phoebus rays did shine,
in every peoples sight.
I know Apelles could not paint,
her seemly shape and show:
Though every Painter should with him,
their perfect skyll bestow.
Dame Nature seeing her picture brave,
did heave her praise so hye:
That in the same she breathed life:
when she did it espy.
Her curled crine did far surpass,
the glorious glistering gold:
My skill is scant, my wit does want,
her favor to unfold.
In years she was nineteen I read,
yet was her gestures grave:
And modest was she in her talk,
but few her virtues have.
Why should I stand to paynt her praise,
I want the Muses aid:
Ne have I clym'de Parnassus clyffe,
by ceaselesse toil assayde.
I never yet did wash my wits,
at wise Libethres Well:
Nor scalde the roughe and ragged rock,
where learned Ladies dwell.
Wherefore come Clio, me assist,
good Ladies lend your skyll:
That I may show those Loouers lives,
with this my barraine quyll.
A Fountain fair there is in Flint,
a River rare to see:
Where ancient Britains did suppose,
some power divine to be.
And daily yet they do adore,
this ancient sacred Spring:
Whose Virtues of a troth are rare,
and do much profit bring.
And calde it is Saint Winefredes Well,
for whom their yearly Feast:
With reverence they yet observe,
from greatest to the least.
The Lame, the Blind, the Lunatike,
the Deaf, and eke the Dome:
Unto this clear celestial spring,
for succor still do come.
Amongst the route, young Charles does ride,
this pleasant plat to view:
And to suruay each seemly shape,
among this comely crewe.
On the other side Dame Iulia comes,
her offringes to bestow:
That unto VVinefred she may,
her due obeysaunce show.
To Temple now these gallaunts go,
with Iulia and her train:
Where solemn Service they did hear,
and so returnde again.
Then unto dancing they do fall,
as ancient custom is:
They spend their time in pleasant sport,
no want of joy they mysse.
But Charles amyd the thickest throng,
does lend his launcing looks:
To feed his eyes with beauties baytes,
yet fearde no force of hooks.
Their beauty he in ballaunce binds,
and ways them all alyke:
He thought no dynt of Cupids darte,
her sturdie heart could strike.
At last his eyes he firmly fixed,
on Iulias shape beside:
Whose favor fresh, and face so fair,
Dame Nature had bedyde.
He found such sparks within her face,
as did inflame his heart:
Which boylde his breast, with burning bra^ds,
and bred his smoking smart.
For crabbed Cupid by his craft,
did hyde himself unseen:
And gorde the breast of Charles unawares,
which made his wounds full green.
Sir Charles who lyu'de at liberty,
as captive now is caught:
And where he wist not how to woo,
now Love his tongue has taught.
He knew her not that bred his bane,
or wrapped his wits in woe:
His senses now were rockt a sleep,
her Love had lulde him so.
Yet bashful shame, (the foe of Love,)
withholdes his tongue to speak:
And faynting fear, had wrought his force,
his mind he durst not break.
Three things there be that hinder Love,
that is Absence, Fear, and Shame:
And where that these be resident,
there things can never frame.
Yet he requests with diligence.
a Tenant of her Sire:
What hight her name, who was her Kin,
that kindled thus his fire.
Mean space fair Iulia looks about,
her wandering eyes do gaze:
Till she by Fortune found the face,
which made her mind to maze.
On Charles by chance, her eyes made choice,
whose feature she did find:
(Above each show of human shape)
the best to please her mind.
She deemed his beams of beauty bright,
did pass each wight as far:
As Titans glystering rays excelles,
the clearenes of a Star.
By doom divine it was decreede,
he should enjoy her heart:
Yet knew not she what wight it was,
that did procure her smart.
Thus both by lot in love were lynckt,
there Passions were alike:
One direful darte by Cupids craft,
their stroke of strife did strike:
They strangers were to each unknown,
both languishe for relief:
And fear did force them to be faint,
to show their gripes of grief.
Yet she demaundes what Knight it was,
whose Princely port did shine:
Who answered her, he was the chief,
and heir of Gaulfrides line.
Which was the Earl of Anglesie,
these words did glad her heart:
And yet the privy pricks of love,
encreast her ceaselesse smart.
On Venus then she does exclaim,
and of her cruel child:
Because that through his shiuering shafte,
her pleasures were exylde.
Yet does she thank Dame Venus grace,
that she in heart did serve:
A worthy Wight, whose virtues rare,
did well her love deserve.
Wherefore O Lady, grant (quoth he)
that for my loyal heart:
I may rewarded be with love,
to cease my secret smart.
Thus both attentive were to view,
to mark each others eye:
If by the sight, some signs might seem,
the flames for to descrie.
At last their dancing finished was,
they leave their lyked sport:
And to a Garden gay and green,
they all forthwith resort.
Wherein an Arbor they are set,
each one to his degree:
First Charles, then Iulia next to him,
as duty wyld to be.
The common crewe with merry notes,
of silver sound do sing:
That with the Echo of their voice,
they make the Garden ring.
But Charles thus placed in this plat,
with joy his tongue is tide:
And shifts of shame, do shrowde his speech,
which should have love descryde.
He freendly grypes her tender hand,
his heart does leap for joy:
And change of h^we bewrayes the flames,
that did his mind annoye.
For as a glass presents each show,
and makes the Picture plain:
Even so the eyes and face bewrayes,
what does in mind remain.
When cullor vades and comes again,
when wandering eyes do raunge:
These are the certain signs of Love,
or of some Passion strange.
He feign would speak, but fear bad stay,
and shame retaynd her tongue:
And thus with pricks of Cupids flames,
they both alyke were stong.
Till Love at last surpassed shame,
and forced fear to fly:
The blazing brandes that burnd within,
burst out with flames on hye.
Then Charles declarde what grypes of grief
did hold his heavy heart:
What flames of Fancy burnd his breast,
through dint of Cupids dart.
O Iulia, would to God (quoth he)
you knew my privy pain:
What secret sighs and soking sobs,
I for your sake sustain.
Your heavenly hew has wun my will,
and pearst my heart so deep:
That lest you deygne to grant me grace,
my wayling mind must weep.
For when I saw your seemly sight,
there flewe from out your eyes,
A spiteful spark into my heart,
whereof great flames did rise.
That least you grant me wished grace,
to ease my groaning grief:
The greedy ground will be my grave,
for want of your relief.
O Lady dear in you remaynes,
to save or else to spyll:
My life or death, my weal and woe,
dependes upon your will.
With Mercy heal my moning mind,
since beauty does abound:
Let Pity be the plaster pure,
to cure my inward wound.
Else cruel care, with caruing knife,
my vytall twist untwine:
And dreadful death dispatch my days,
to shrowde my shape in shrine.
Here with the trickling tears did train,
a long his cherry cheeks:
And sobs to silence him provoked,
his tongue to talk mysteekes.
When she had heard this trembling tale,
she would have feign replyde:
But faultring tongue was glewd so fast,
that it to roof was tide.
At last as one from slothful sleep,
which newly does awake:
Recovering of her former force,
with trembling tongue she spoke,
O worthy Sir, whom lucky lot,
through destinies decree:
Assigned have unto this place,
to thrall my heart so free.
Is loyal Love do burn your breast,
as you by speech profess:
Much more the kindled coals do blaze,
in me whose force is less.
O that Dame Fortune did agree,
if that it pleased your mind:
That lasting lynkes of loyal Love,
did knit the knot of kind.
Though death should deal his dyrefull dint,
and daunt me with his Dart:
No pinching pricks of pyning pain,
should stir my mind to start.
Each greef were gain, each sour were sweet,
each pain shall pleasure seem:
All deadly dolors for your sake,
I deep delyght would deem*
And least you think I falsely feign,
my heart and hand I give:
To rest your own in weal or woe,
while I on earth do live.
You Loouers well may judge what joys,
inflamde his moning minds:
When calm content prouok^ her will,
the Brydely bands to bind.
He cries, O Fortune stay thy wheel,
I have my hoped hyre:
My will has wun his only wish,
thou fedst me with desire.
Heerwith their solemn sacred oaths,
confirms their faithful hearts:
And hearts and hands do knyt the knot,
which naught but death departs.
Both Juno then, and Himen heyghe,
to witness they do call:
How freely they did join the band,
which thrust them both in thrall.
By this time Phoebus lost his light,
and Westwarde did decline:
And Vesper now the evening Star,
begins for to shine.
O Charles (quoth she) we must depart,
which grindes my groaning grief:
Till tracte of time do yield the lot,
to lend us like relief.
(Quoth he) O Iulia point the time,
that we may meet again:
And if I break the fixed hour,
let me the blame sustain.
Naught else but death, shall keep my corpse,
from out they seemly sight:
Or if I dye, my wandering Ghost,
shall come to thee by night.
Said Iulia then, when Phoebus has,
three times his light renewde:
Let not your absence cause my cares,
least pleasures be subdewde.
O Iulia dear, if I (quoth he)
do swerve from your desire:
Let mighty Jove consume my corpse,
with flashing flames of fire.
With clasping arms they then embrace,
their kisses show their kind:
A hundredth times their lyppes do meet,
to glad each others mind.
Then floods of tears do flow full fast,
their parting was a pain:
Yet hope was honey to their hearts,
that they should meet again.
And thus they had each others heart,
which did them both content:
He hyeth then to Anglesie,
and homeward straight she went.
Where being come, they both lament,
the force of Cupids fist:
Whose hapless hand did shoot the shafte,
to wound them ere they wist.
He cries, O Cupid crafty elfe,
the worker of my woe:
What have I done, that moves thy mind,
on me thy force to show.
And she exclaymes on Venus vile,
which lapt her heart in Love:
And bound her in such bands of bale,
from which she could not move.
Their eyes do now forget to sleep,
through care and dyrefull dread:
They wallowe still their weary bones,
upon their restless bead.
Now do they deem each day a month,
and every month a year:
Till each of them by plighted vow,
in poynted place appear.
Each pleasure now procures pain,
all Music seems moan:
All wealth is woe, their heavy hearts,
are gnawde with gripes of groan.
The wished time they still attend,
to view each others sight:
That they might spend their time in sport,
and live in deep delight.
Three times has Phoebus now repay'de,
his wasted horns a new:
The wished day is now attaynd,
they should each other view.
Then Charles with cheerful heart is pressed,
when Phoebus force was spent:
To hye with haste, least Parents should,
perceive his close intent.
Now Sol was settled in the West,
and Luna began to shine:
When Charles pretendes to view her face,
whom he in heart did shrine.
By travail he attaynes the place,
(when Nox was wasted well:)
Where first he found the harmefull heat,
which forced his heart to swell.
But when Aurora in the East,
had cleerde the morning tide:
Then Iulia longing for this light,
to Wynefride she hyde.
By fayning of due Sacrifice,
they both with joy embrace:
That each of them through free consent,
had wun this wished place.
What joys they had, let Loouers judge,
when both at suddayne sight:
Possessed the fruits of their desires,
unto their deep delyght.
Even as the Vine enuyroneth,
the pole which makes them grow:
So they embrace each others neck,
with arms as white as snow.
When sugared toys of Loouers guise,
between them end did take*
Then Charles to Iulia framde his tale,
and thus to her he spoke.
O Iulia, would my soil were set,
within thy native land:
That I each night might shape my course.
to kiss thy tender hand.
So might I homewarde hye with haste,
ere morning lent his light:
So might we both frequent our joys,
unseen of any wight.
But seeing the stronde withholdes our hearts,
being lynckt by lots of love:
Let us to win our wished wylles,
some privy practice prove.
To bind us both in Bridely bands,
this is the meetest way:
That we by some devise allure,
some Priest with hoped pray.
Him to corrupt with heaps of Coin,
yet close it must be wrought:
That ripe report run not abroad,
ere it to pass be brought.
But when by Law we lynked are,
if then our Parents know:
They waying want of remedy,
will grant it shall be so.
And though my Parents and my friends,
disdain my secret deed:
In steed of their good will, I shall,
obtain a greater meede.
My Fathers wealth, and eke my kin,
I do accoumpt them small:
So I enjoy thy hydden heart,
I reap reward for all.
Wherefore let not our Fathers wrath,
or care for worldly wealth:
Once move thy steadfast mind from me,
whereon dependes my health.
For why, ere Luna lose her light,
by only course of kind:
I will provide a privy Priest,
our bands of bliss to bind.
Therefore declare if my devise,
content your worthy will:
Or that you know a better way,
our joys for to fulfill.
When as he thus had told his mind,
she spoke with trembling voice:
O Sir (quoth she) my wits are weak,
I put it to your choice.
The great good will I bear to you,
my hews bewrayes the same:
And though that Women weaker be,
my heat exceedes your flame.
Where Femine do prefixe their Love,
no measure they observe:
They fasten then their faith so sure,
that they do never swerve.
Assure your self what I have said,
my deeds shall plain express:
For time shall try that trusty truth,
shall not from words degresse.
For why, the gifts of Natures grace,
which I in you do find:
Your Verues, and your form so fine,
have wun my inward mind.
No marueyle it is that I am caught,
in Cupids subtle snare:
Since that the Wight that holds my heart,
in beauty is so rare.
My Love is such, that least through lot,
we lyncked are by Law:
Fell Atropos will cut the threde,
which Lachesis does draw.
Since I have vowde to be thine own,
thy purpose do dispatch:
For none bears breath, but only thou,
with whom I wish to match.
Ere that a month therefore be past,
I will attentive be:
According unto promise plight,
your quick return to see.
My Iulia dear doubt not (says he)
full soon I will retire:
For to content your freendly mind,
with fruits of your desire.
And in mean space as Loouers use,
on hope we still will feed:
Till poynted time be fully run,
whereon we have decreede.
By this time Phoebus sturdy steedes,
do lodge in Occident:
When these two Loouers now must leave,
the sport which thus they spent.
With heavy cheer they then embrace,
their clasped arms they close:
What heavy sighs and sobbes they spent,
my pen cannot disclose.
With greedy grypes he culles her corpse,
full loathe for to depart:
Farewell my Iulia dear (quoth he)
I leave with thee my heart.
Sir Charles (quoth she) although my corpse,
be hyd from out your sight:
I yield also my heart to you,
your goodness to requight.
And thus they both prepare to pack,
he spares no spurs to speed:
She backward throws her lingering looks,
her fancyde eyes to feed.
But when she lost his sight at last,
her tears began gushe a main:
Her heavy heart was then oppressed,
with pynching pricks of pain.
She cursed the time that Nature first,
did lend her lucklesse life:
She wished her Nurse, had reft her breath,
by dint of bloody knyfe.
She cursed her mouth that took the food,
which did her corpse sustain:
And wished some poison in her pappe,
that might have been her bayne.
At last retaynd by reasons rule,
her self she homeward sped:
Where being come, she wylles her maid,
for to prepare her bed.
Whereon she thought to take her rest,
and fall to quiet sleep:
But carking care, and groaning grief,
provoked her eyes to weep.
That down the tears like drops do rain,
on bed whereas she lay:
And to her self in whyspering sort:
at last she began to say.
If I should marie secretly,
ere Parents know the same?
What should I purchase to my self,
but only lasting shame?
What? should I match my self with him,
whom thrice I never saw?
Tush Iulia, tush thou art to rash,
therefore thy mind withdraw,
Least it be said, thou art a Child,
that lyu'ste deuoyde of awe?
Shall I my Mothers curse deserve?
whereat I ought to quake?
Shall I lose Parents, Kithe and Kin?
all for one Strangers sake?
Or shall I put my honesty,
into a Strangers hand:
Who would perhaps misuse me then,
when as I were in band?
To whom then might I make my moan,
or gape for hope of grace?
Who would assist me having wrong,
or plead my careful case?
No, no, my will shall cease to wade,
to work my Parents woe:
My hasty head shall leave his hope,
to frame my ruin so.
This said, she pausde, and straight ways does,
her tatling tongue reprove:
For spytting out such words of spite,
against him whom she did love.
Should I (quoth she) ungrateful seem,
to such a worthy Knight?
Who on the gain of my good will,
does fix his whole delight?
Within whose faithful heart so true,
does lodge such loyal love?
Whose Virtue rare, and seemly shape,
the stonyst heart might move?
Should I then have a flinty heart,
like to my Countries name?
Or should I to a courteous Knight,
be found a thanklesse Dame?
No, no, in wealth, or else in woe,
in mirth, or else in moan:
In pleasure, or in pinching pain,
till death I am his own.
Till whose return (I live in tears,)
expecting wished joys:
When Marriage lock, shall linck our hearts,
to drive out dark annoyes.
When tears and swelling sighs were slakte,
Morpheus does appear:
Sir Somnus with his sleeping slights,
does close her eyes so clear.
Her mind is then deuoyde of care,
(For sleep does ease the heart:
Whom greedy gripes of groaning grief,
does sink in Seas of sinart.)
At last Aurora with his light,
the cloudy Skies does clear:
And blazing Tytan with his beams,
in East does straight appear.
Then does she rise from careful coutche,
she takes her Book in hand:
Wherein she reads her private Prayers,
as did with custom stand.
But still her rolling eye does raunge,
in thousands thriftlesse thoughts:
To think on Charles, does change her cheer,
thereby her grief is wrought.
But leave we Iulia now a time,
for why my quaking quyll:
Shall now reuert, to paynt his grief,
whom cutting cares did kill.
When he had past her Fathers Port,
and parted was her sight:
In ryding he espyes a Hill,
whereat he did alight.
Such dollors deep did him distress,
such sudden sorrows swell.
As mazde his mind, that flat on ground,
in pytteous plightes he fell.
And thus with cries he cleaues the clouds,
Oh gentle Death (quoth he:)
Come shut these wyndowes of my mind,
this loathsome light to see.
O Heavens, where are your thunder boltes,
and flakes of flashing fire:
For to consume my careful coarse,
which burns in hot desire.
O Earth* do gape with mighty mawe,
and swallowe up my coarse:
Some hasty hand, dispatch my days,
and rue me with remorse.
As thus he powrde his pittious plaints,
his was^lesse woes to weep:
His sooking sighs, and wearyed tears,
provoked his eyes to sleep.
Dame Venus then to him appears,
thus sleeping as he lay:
And thus she spoke (O Charles quoth she)
awake with speed I say.
Why do thou so with troublous thoughts,
and storms of sturdy strife:
Torment thy self for her, which shall
remain thy wedded Wife?
The noisome night is nearly spent,
stand up therefore with speed:
For why, to hye the home in haste,
the time requires need.
This faynting fear that frayes thy heart,
denies thou art a man:
And yet thy shape does show full well,
the art that Nature can.
Vngyrde thy mind of inward grief,
let wisdom welde thy will:
Thy love is thine (do not dismay)
and so she shall be still.
With that he starteth up amazde,
releast of inward pain:
And hopte assuredly of help,
through this his vision vain.
And being perfectly awakte,
he took his prime prospect:
Unto the coast where she was lodgd,
that did his heart protect.
O luckie Land, O Flint (quoth he)
thrice happy be the hour:
That I to fix my feebel feet,
in thee did find the power.
Thou harborest her that has my heart,
and shall till death agree:
To shryne me in my shyuering sheet,
what so betyde of me.
With that a cloud of smoking sighs,
he sendes to her amayne:
To signify her loyal love,
did so procure his pain.
Then to his man he calls for Horse*
he hyes him home apace:
That he may win his Fathers Court,
ere Phoebus show his face.
And by that time he had aspyrde,
unto his hasted home:
Bright Lucifer the morning Star,
about the Skies does rome.
He wylles his man to make his bed,
whom he does chardge full straight:
Not to disclose his secret walks,
which was a thing of weight.
And there in bed he does devise,
where he a Priest may find:
That may procure his wished will,
and ease his careful mind.
At last, suppressed with sluggish sleep,
he takes a nappe or twain:
And then he starts from stately bed,
to cloathe him self again.
And ere he had him self addressed,
the Sun does South declyne,
The clock strykes twelve, the board is laid,
and it is dynner time.
It were too long for to express,
the change of costly cates:
For seru'de they were as does become,
the stay of noble States.
Let it suffice that they were set,
and into talk they fell:
Of this and that, I know not what,
nor did not mark it well.
But well I wot, Charles lyked not,
to hear their tedious talk:
For all that while his wandering wits,
a thousand ways does walk.
He sat so sadly in his dumpes,
with arms enclosde to breast:
That men might think some cause there was
that bread his great unrest.
His Father and his Mother both,
do fix their eyes on him:
They muzd what clouds had clipst his mirth
or made his joys so dym.
And thus his Father began to speak,
my Son, I maruayle much:
What mooues thy mind to myrthlesse cheer
or makes thy gestures such?
Has lynkes of Love, by Cupids craft,
inchaynde thy heart by chance?
Has Venus vain inuolu'de thy mind,
in her delyghts to dance?
Has fancy fettered thee so fast,
that thou can not rejoice?
Then tell me who, and what she is,
whereon thou makste thy choice.
His Mother eke, whose tender care,
was over him not small:
Desires him tell, what chyppe of chance,
by sorry hap does fall.
That ere the wound be waxen stale,
she may a salve prepare:
To heal the harms that holds his heart,
and for to cure his care.
Their words do much amaze his mind,
the blood does stayne his face:
A sign of seemly shamefastness,
and token of good grace.
And thus to them with reverence due,
he does replye again:
My Parents both, you guess amysse,
your judgments are but vain.
No shiuering shafte of Cupids craft,
nor force of Fancies fume:
Has any force to crushe my coarse,
my pleasures to consume.
I coumpt but vile of Venus vaunts,
her beauty is but black:
It cannot dym my crystal sight,
nor pluck my pleasures back.
I have my health I thank the Heavens,
with cares ne am I clad:
My mind is stuffed with inward mirth,
although I seem so sad.
And then he throws a forced smyle,
to drive their minds from dout:
Least they might else surmyse the truth,
which made him seem so stout.
By that they thus had spent the time,
the dynner came to end:
All rise with course of courtesy,
with shortness to extend.
The Lords and Ladies do delyght,
at Chesse to spend the time:
And some reuolue the ancient books,
was writ in British ryme.
Some Dice, some Card, some Hunt, some Hawke,
as best content their mind:
And every one to pass the time,
some pleasant play do find.
But Charles enchaynd by thrystles thoughts
the day in care consumes:
And wishes Nox for to approach,
that sleep may ease his sumes.
Which being come, his former woes,
withholdes his eyes from rest:
He turns and tosseth too and fro,
to ease his careful breast.
At last Aurora lendes her light,
and Titan does display:
His gladsome beams to each man's eyes,
that couets for the day.
Sir Charles that longed for the light,
from careful couch does rise:
And then how he might find a Priest,
he does all means deuyse.
By hap it came into his mind,
of one whom he did know:
Which was his freende, and unto whom,
he straight for help did go.
Requesting him to yield supply,
for to relieve his case:
Because in him did only rest,
his hope of wished grace.
Protesting then if he would grant,
to comfort him in need:
He would requight his great good will,
with fruits of treble meede.
In you (quoth he) remaynes my help,
and lengthning of my life:
And you alone can ease my grief,
and stint my inward strife.
Wherefore as I may rest your friend,
in after time to come:
So lend relief to aid my lack,
then shall you hear the some.
The Priest replied with reverence dew,
good Sir, what lies in me:
My life and death is ready pressed,
at your command to be.
If I may pleasure you in ought,
express the same with speed:
And here I vow in what I can,
I will support your need.
And if it do concern such things,
as must be needs conceald:
Though death should danger me with doubt,
it shall not be reueald.
Wherefore detract no longer time,
here is both heart and hand:
In weal or woe, I will not stick,
your helper for to stand.
Charles lyked well his faithful heart,
and thought him self thryse blessed:
That Fortune stood so much his friend,
to grant him wished rest.
With thousand thanks for his good will,
which he had not deseru'de:
Protesting then his kindness great,
his lothed life preseru'de.
Wherefore (quoth he) with lystning ear,
attend unto my tale:
So shall thou hear my lyngering joys,
which breeds my bitter bale.
It was my lot to light in place,
where Ladies did resort:
Amongst the which I spyed out one,
of most surpassing port.
Whom Natures art so finely framde,
with such excelling glee:
As would intrappe the stoutest heart,
her featured form to see.
The shyning shape that Venus shewde,
on top of Ida Mount:
Was nothing to her Princely port,
of whom I make account.
In whom such virtue does remain,
to match her heavenly face:
As makes me judge she does excel,
Pandora for her grace.
Whose seemly show, with manners mild
when I had marked well:
Withdrewe the freedom of my mind,
to bondage straight I fell.
The bands of beauty which she bare,
with words of courteous talk:
Within the walls of her good will,
inclosde me for to walk.
Wherein I sought to plead my case,
but shame my tongue did stay:
Yet burning Love quight vanquished shame,
and forced fear away.
So that my tears did tell my troth,
when words might wade no more:
What should I say, I wun her will,
the salve of all my sore.
She plighted faith, I gave my troth,
to rest her own in life:
Now naught remaynes but Marriage state,
to make us man and wife.
Wherefore dear friend, here is contaynd
the sum of my request:
(Since with your function it does stand,)
that you would do your best.
To link us both in outward law,
which inwardly remain:
One heart within two bodies now,
so shall you ease our pain.
Sir, said the Priest, though your request,
may well procure my blame:
If lucklesse lot, should give such cause,
your Parents know the same.
Yet for the comfort of your heart,
as for my promise sake:
I will fulfill your hearts desire,
your secret bands to make.
But if she be no equal match,
nor fit for your degree:
I would be loathe to work your will,
for why, we daily see:
That where unequals coupled are,
is great debate and strife:
And seeds of such dissencion stroyes,
the graftes of quiet life.
My friend (quoth Charles) you need not dout.
she is of noble state:
Her Parents and her Kin descend,
(the truth for to relate.)
From out the best of British blood,
and Owen is her Sire:
In Flint he rules, and raygnes as Earl,
whom I alone desire.
If she be such as you declare,
Sir Charles I am content:
To ioygne you both in Nuptial bands,
if each of you assent.
Wherefore let dread of froward hap,
no whyt dismay your mind:
What I have said I will perform,
though death were me assignde.
I need not here express what meede,
the Priest did then obtain:
His rich rewards might well suffice,
for to requight his pain.
They both depart when this was done,
each to his several home:
But Charles being clad with calm content,
in pleasant thoughts does rome.
And nothing else does vex his mind,
but tediousness of time:
(For every day does seem a year,
when love remaynes in pryme.)
He blames the son of ceaselesse sloth,
that lendes so long his light:
And would the Moon were wasted clean,
that does prolong the night.
O Titan, Titan, (he exclaymes,)
when wylt thou run thy race:
I loathe the bryghtnesse of thy beams,
which do annoy my face.
Now does he wish some sudden trance,
each joint for to benome:
And by some Charm to lose his sprites,
till fixed day do come.
Sometime he hopes of luckie hap,
then danger byds him doubt:
And thus twixt hope and faynting fear,
his time he wears out.
Such is the trape of Venus thralles,
where loathsome Love remains:
To hope the best, and fear the worst,
(lo, such is Loouers games.)
Between his hope and furious fear,
his pleasant cheer decays:
His sprites are duld with careful thoughts*
his flesh consumes away.
His countenance declares his grief,
his strength begins to waste:
His joints wax stiff, his lymmes are sore,
such turmoyles he does taste*
His comely carcass waxes faint,
with greefes and daily groans:
His seemly shape is now become,
a heap of shackling bones.
The heart whom cutting cares does crushe,
and thyrling thoughts does thrall:
Is subject unto sickness sore,
but Fevers most of all.
For care does waste the heart of man,
and bringes the body low:
As they that feel the force thereof,
full perfectly do know.
So Charles his grief to Fever grows,
his fittes procures his pain:
The percing pricks of Agues panges,
torments him every vain.
Whereby he forced is to tell,
his dollors deep disease:
That thereby he might find redress,
his sickness for to raze.
Now lies he tossing on his bed,
sometime with cares oppressed:
And sometimes shakte with Fevers fits,
which makes him sore distressed.
His Parents mourn his present state,
they seek for Phisickes art:
They spare no charges to suppress,
the terror of his smarte.
No Potions, Ointments, Salues, or cures,
no Simples, nor Compounds:
Nor Medicines made, by Phisickes skyll,
his furious fittes confounds.
His Father tendering of his state,
bewayles his careful case:
And says, my Son I do perceive,
your sorrows by your face.
I wist of late you were not well,
when I your face did view:
Your mind that time declarde your grief,
by sudden change of hew.
You are attatcht with loathsome love,
and subject to his law:
Whose furious force subdueth those,
whose years are green and raw.
Declare therefore what so she be,
thou shall have my consent:
And do not thus with troublous thoughts,
thy careful heart torment.
His Mother likewise does lament,
her sore diseased son:
Her trickling tears along the bed,
like rushing Rivers run.
She does desire to know his grief,
but all their talk is vain:
Their wasted words do more increase,
his dollor and his pain.
(For many words does grieve the sick,
which peevish are by kind:
As small occasions soon provoke,
an discontented mind.)
Therefore Sir Charles requests his Sire,
and Mother in like case:
(Least that his presence move their grief)
for to depart the place.
Persuading them they vex his mind,
with their continual moan:
And that he should obtain some sleep,
if that they once were gone.
His woeful Parents leave him then,
as loathe him to molest:
Whom ceaselesse smart of sickness sharp,
had now so sore oppressed.
When they were gone, he sighs, he sobs,
and rayles on Fortune blind:
Dispayring least that sickness should,
his poynted knot vntwinde.
Now does he wish that Iulia knew,
his sickness and his pain:
So would she not misdoubt his love,
nor think that he did feign.
For sickness seldom covenant keeps,
men's honesty to save:
He pulles a man from mirth and joy,
and rowles him to his grave.
Thus Charles amid his noisome nyppes,
does welter all in woe:
And does desire the winged Time,
with lyngering steps to go.
That he might have his former health,
his plighted vow to save:
Before the time prefixed paste,
his full concourse should have.
But Time regardes no state of man,
he slily slippes by stealth:
And tedious is to patients greeu'de,
yet seems but short in health.
The year does waste, his course runs on,
Dame Phoebae does again:
Remove her former wasted horns,
and shines full bright and plain.
Now Iulia does with watching eye,
for Charles return attend:
Persuaded that this wished time,
should former sorrows end.
Now she prouides such needful things,
as does to her pertain:
And thus each day she stood in hope,
of his return again.
But when she saw that trustlesse hope,
did naught at all prevail:
Then she misdoubts that Charles his fraud
has caus'de his faith to fail.
A thousand thoughts do thrall her mind,
some times she hopes the best:
Then blames him straight, with breach of faith,
and calls him guilefull guest.
Some times she thinks some other Dame,
had wun his will to change:
Again, she deemes some other let,
does hinder him to raunge.
But when she saw the poynted time,
to be so far I spent:
And that her hope was frustrate now,
contrary to consent.
She writes to him these following words,
and wills him to beware:
Least VVynefrides plague for his untroth,
does breed his ceaseles care.
The Letter of Iulia to Charles.
THough lyngering long I trusted to thy love,
in hope thy deeds should firm thy wasted words
Yet now I deem thy wavering mind does move,
I beat the bush, an other gets the byrds.
The plighted time thou dydst appoint to meet*
is now expirde, and thou have broke thy vow:
Ne have thou sent, by writings me to greet,
whereby the less, I do thy deeds allow.
The mighty Gods vouchsafe that Wynefride.
do not requite thy falsehood with desert:
For stayning so her Temple with a deed,
whose false effect, does merit treble smart,
Yet nay the less though thou be false of faith:
my heart shall still remain thine own for aye,
Hap weal or woe, hap life or direful death:
I will no whit from fixed promise straye.
And so adieu, the Gods do thee forgive,
though thou by fraud have bred my hearts anoy:
Yet do I vow, while I on earth do live,
to pray the powers to grant thee lasting joy.
Thy sorrowful Lady Iulia.


THis done, she closde it up with speed,
and secretly she sendes:
A messenger to Anglesie,
who straight his voyadge bendes.
Who being come to Gaulfrides Court,
to Charles he does present:
(Who lay full sick upon his bed)
this Letter which she sent.
When as he knew the same to come,
from Iulia his (so dear)
He felt his Fever fits to faint,
through new revived cheer.
When he had read her Letter through,
which did his tariaunce blame:
He calde for pen and ynke to write,
an answer to the same.
Wherein he shows his cause of stay,
and that he means likewise:
To firm his vow, when to his state
of health he shall arise.
The reply of Charles to Iulia her Letter.
WIth treble thanks I greet thee here again,
whose willi^g heart does wish my lasti^g wealth
Soregreu'd in mind, that chance does me retain,
and heavy hap does so withholde my health.
Whereby the cause of thy conceit does rise,
though no desert may drive thy mind to dout:
Yet my distress apparaunt to thine eyes,
shall drive the cause of such suspicion out.
The trust that thou reposedst in my love,
shall not be void, nor frustrate in effect:
For why, my deeds shall plighted promise prove
if mighty God my lyngering life protect.
Thou beatest the bush, and shall the birds obtain,
none other wight shall have my heart in hold:
Though time be past, yet time will come again,
for to fulfill the vowed tale I told.
I am no Paris, nor of Theseus brood,
ne yet am like to Jason most unjust:
But Pyramus to spend my dearest blood,
or I to Thisbe would be false of trust.
I trust that Wynefride will no hate conceive,
since by the powers my let alone proceeds:
Let her the guilty from their joys bereave,
and not the faultlesse suffer for their deeds.
It is not I, but Fortunes froward fate,
that filde my heart with fits of Fevers force:
That if thou should but view my present state,
thou would pronounce, I am some se^celes corse.
But if the Gods vouchsafe my health to render,
I will fulfill my former faythed vow:
Then shall thou know how I thy love do tender,
though false suspect retains thy senses now.
And thus adieu in hope of health at hand,
time shall at last, inchayne our bodies fast:
Though absence thus do cause our greefes to stand,
yet lyngering joy will dubble be at last.
Thine own for ever, Charles.


THis Letter made, the messenger
of Iulia he does lend:
Desiring him unto his Dame,
with heart him to commend.
Who straight to Flint does hye apace,
his message to discharge:
Who being gone, Charles feels his fittes,
of Fevers to enlarge.
This night he takes no rest at all,
such grief his entrayles tear:
His heavy heart thus long oppressed,
with wastfull woe does wear.
The messenger by this came home,
whom Iulia longd to vewe:
Saluting her with Charles his lines,
which does her joys renew.
She shut the door, least some should spy,
the Letter which was sent:
Which done, she hasted it to read,
and straight the seal she rent.
With fingers fine as white as snow,
she rippes, and reads the same
With watchful eyes, as houering Hawke,
does pray upon her game.
But when she finds how Agues fittes,
has shakte his heart so sore:
And how his corpse consumed is,
with sickness more and more.
The brynish tears does wet her cheeks,
her sight to read they stop:
The Crystal streams in trickling wise,
like silver dew does drop.
But when the spring of watrie drops,
was dried up through want:
To read his deep lamenting lines,
her tender heart does pant.
Perusing them* she sighs and sobbes,
to ponder his estate:
Her Isie cares and brandes of love,
do breed in breast debate.
Alas (she said) what does it need,
to add unto my smart:
The least of these my cutting cares,
may kill a woman's heart.
I thought that I had past the pykes,
and feelde of fighting groans:
But now I see I have to run,
a camp of ceaseles mones.
And where I thought that marriage Rytes,
should yield me gain for grief:
I see the darts of Death at hand,
which breeds my sorrows chief.
My freende in pain (oh furious fates)
now fie on Fortunes wheel:
Since I a wretch and simple soul,
her pinching pains shall feel.
But since what destinies decree,
of force must be fulfilde:
My patient mind shall bear each brunt^,
as Princely powers have wild.
And thus as she lamenting was,
her grief, and careful case:
Her sorrows now began to swadge,
she wypte her watrie face.
And forth she comes with feigned cheer,
in countenance full glad:
Although the thoughts of Charles his grief,
did make her heart full sad.
Thus carefully she drives the time,
with secret sorrows painde:
Now this, now that torments her mind,
as Fancies humors raynde.
But ere seven nights space were spent,
she longes to know again:
Of Charles his state, and how his grief
of Agues do remain.
She took her pen as ready pressed,
to him again to write:
For whom in panges of endless pain,
she languisht day and night.
But ere she had fulfilde her mind,
in writing of her byll:
Such careful news does cut it off,
as made her want her will.
Wherefore perpend her wavering state,
how Fortunes wheel does raunge:
But first peruse her careful lines,
then mark their story strange.
Iulia her Letter to Charles.
I Have received your doleful lines,
which unto me you sent:
Which grievous news when I perusde,
did much my mind torment.
Within your Letter lapped was,
a frosen clod of care:
Which freesde my heart with chylling cold,
to read your sickness rare.
And though I doubted your deceyt,
to like an other Dame:
Yet pardon me. Love has no law,
for Fancy moude the same.
For heaps of care, in those abounds,
which coupled are with fear:
And ielous Love doubts more then needs,
as truth can witness bear.
But since my Fortune is so hard,
I would some other wight:
Had reapt your love, so should you not,
with Fevers fittes be fright.
Or else I would I might sustain,
the half of all your grief:
So should I ease you of some cares,
and heal my sorrows chief.
But if that death by direful dint,
should lose your lew of life:
Or sisters three should cut your twist,
by fatal sharpened knife.
My gastlie goast shall follow fast,
to the Elisian feeldes:
Unto the sight of seemly Saints,
which endless pleasure yeeldes.
Yea, though it were in Charons boat,
down Stigian stream to slide:
My sprite shall be thy walking mate,
what so of me betide.
And when the ground shall be my grave,
I will have graued thereon.
This mornefull vearse, in doleful wise,
upon my marble stone.
Under this stone does Iulia lie.
to Charles a faithful freende:
Who willingly to show her truth,
her careful life did end.
The Ladies that hereafter live,
shall know by Iulias love:
How faithful she to Charles remaind,
and never did remove.

WHen she thus far had past her pen,
in came Alecto fell:
Some grym Maegaera, stoong with lies,
a fearful tale to tell.
He rushing came into the Hall,
and said that Gaulfrides son,
Had yielded up his mortal life,
his final race was run*
He did not only say the same,
but swear by sollem oath:
The brute thereof once thoroughly spread,
it was beleeu'de for troth.
The cause wherefore this lie was spread,
was this as I have read:
That Charles into a trance did fall,
and was reputed dead.
His face was cold, his breath was gone,
no life in him appears:
They wrong his joints, they bowde his breast,
they thumpe him on the ears.
They pour warm licquor down his throat
his jaws they open wide:
And so reduced him to life,
through that he did abide.
And yet the rumor rashly ran,
his life was past all cure:
So swiftly lying Fame does fly,
as tatling tongues procure.
Hereof arose this loathsome lie,
but (oh) you Ladies mourn:
For now unto a doleful tale,
my style I must return.
For now as Iulia was applied,
to pen her inward pain:
In came her Maid with gasly looks,
and cried out amain.
O Madame (quoth she) heavy news,
I have to you to show:
To think whereon, my faynting heart
does melt through wastfull woe.
What news (quoth Iulia) lifting up
her sight (from paper straight)
Have thou to show, express the same,
and let me hear them straight.
The Maid replied, Sir Gaulfrides son,
that Charles has to name:
By death is now departed life,
as bruted is by fame.
This pearst her heart with deadly smart,
this agrauates her pain:
Now does she loathe her lyngering life,
and does the same disdain.
Her quiuering quyll, from quaking hand,
in faynting sort does fall:
She floong away both incke and pen,
and paper therewithal.
And forthwith does command her Maid,
for to avoid the place:
Who being gone, she scryketh out,
in most lamentfull case*
She rentes her hair, she beats her breast,
her blood from face is gone:
Her hollow looks declarde her grief,
that made her mind to moan.
She does devise which way to dye,
for life she lotheth still:
Despair byds her make no delay,
but seek her self to spyll.
Yet faynting fear of femine heart,
does fray her from the fact:
And dread of Gods, wylles her withholde,
from such a wicked act.
At last she does exclame one fate,
and Fortunes waywarde wheel:
That forced her in steed of joy,
such nypping cares to feel.
O Heavens (quoth she) what lowering lot,
of most unlucky hap:
Has moved such fury to my chance,
to train me in this trappe?
O mighty God, vouchsafe (quoth she)
thine ears for to incline:
Let dreadful Death thy messenger,
shut up my corpse in shrine.
Let me not live, since he is gone,
that should my life support:
For Death is sweet, and Life is sour,
where care is chief comfort.
It were too long to write her plaintes,
and careful scriching cries:
Or to express what floods of tears,
did flow from out her eyes.
But straight amyd these passions strange,
from Chamber she does part:
And walks the feeldes adjoining near,
for to refreshe her heart.
Where being come, in mornefull wise
she does her grief relate:
That hyls and dales, with woods and groves
may know her ruthful state.
Her wasted words, like Echo does,
amyd the Trees resound:
And with her tears like morning dew,
she wets the grassie ground.
And thus she walks, till Phoebus lamp,
had lost his loouely light:
Then to her Chamber she returns,
to waste the weary night.
Upon her Princely bed forthwith,
she throws her careful corse:
Where black despair assaylde her straight,
with fittes of treble force.
A thousand means she does devise,
to sheare her line of life:
Some times with coarde, some times with drinks,
some times with caruing knife.
At last she staide her staggering mind,
with purpose full decreede:
Ere Sol above the Horizon,
did cast his glauncing gleede.
To VVynefrides Temple for to go,
her prayers for to make:
And ere that she came home again,
her life there to forsake.
Even there she did determine sure,
where first she found the flame:
The water of her wicked deeds,
should quickly quench the same.
As Phillis ended up her days,
with twyne of silken cord:
So would she leave her loathsome life,
which she so much abhorde.
Thus raging in these restless thoughts,
till lyghtsome morning tide:
She straight vpstart, and goes about,
her offerings to provide.
With Incense and such needful things,
to VVynefride she hyes:
To execute her fancied fact,
which she did late devise.
The way was short, not past a mile,
she hasted thither straight:
And into Church she roundly goes,
her matters were of weight.
She kneeling down in humble wise,
within that wonted place:
Where all such sat as did discende,
of worthy Owens race.
Her prayers done, she gins to pawse,
upon her lewd pretense:
And how the same to Parents hers,
might breed a foul offense.
Besides the blotte of black defame,
that on her kin should light:
With loss of honor to her self,
and Ladies foul despite.
Considering this, her mind does change,
unto an other way:
And now she finds an other pathe,
to frame her own decay.
And thus perplexed with thousand thoughts,
to VVynefride she cries:
O Virgin thou, whose flyttering fame,
does pearce the azurde Skies.
Whose glory glaunceth like the gleames,
of golden Tytans rays:
Whose Dyans deeds deserve the prick.
of sempiternall praise.
Bow down thy ears to thy handmaide,
that does not life desire:
But that the sisters three vouchsafe,
my death for to conspire.
My twist they have drawn forth too long,
which should have taken end:
when direful destinies decreede,
to spoil me of my freende.
But since the fates so furiously,
have refte him from my sight:
In whom consisted all my hope,
of solace and delight.
Should I desire to feed my corpse,
with faynting breath perdie:
And he ingrupled in his grave,
on whom my life does lie?
How should I waste my weary time,
in joy or wonted mirth:
When wrauling woorms do crase his corpse,
within the massy earth?
O would I were some senseless beast,
deuoyde of reasons kind:
So should I feel no fittes of pain,
for to torment my mind.
I would Diana would decree,
to grant me Acteons state:
So Sorrows Hounds should hale my heart,
out of this dire debate.
Vouchsafe O Jove that guidst the Sphaeres,
to reaue from me my life:
That I may end this careful course,
which breeds my guiltless strife.
And grant the gasping earth that gapes,
for all things that she gave:
May lodge my coarse that feign would rest,
within her swallowing cave.
Let me for Courtly garments gay,
possess a winding sheet:
And let my cyndred moulde in earth,
be trodden down with feet.
O let my doleful Dirge be song,
in steed of Marriage feast:
And for my costly spowsall Cowtch,
lay me in grave to reast.
And where that Hymaen should us knitte,
in Iunos bands for aye:
Alecto and Maegaera both,
let them in presence stay.
And where Lucina should obtain,
a place by room of right:
Their Tisiphone shall remain,
with looks of foul despite.
O grant the same you heavens I crave,
my prayers hear with speed:
For I by death will lose my life,
since fates have so decreede.
WHen she had uttered forth her plaints,
then homewarde straight she went:
Withhelde by some celestial power,
from former foul intent.
To Chamber back she does return,
ere any rose from rest:
And round about her Chamber runs,
with careful thoughts oppressed.
And when the householde ready were,
she wills her Maid go call
One of her Fathers men forthwith,
whom she must speak withal.
To whom she says, you know where dwells
the Ioyner not far hence:
Request him for to come to me,
for I must needs comence
With him about a certain thing,
The servant goes straight way:
And brought the Ioyner unto her,
that did his coming stay.
Who being come, to him she says,
my freende I you request:
Such cunning as you have to show,
and do for me your best.
For I would have a Chest so made,
that neither air nor shower:
No rain nor waters flood it should,
in any place deuowre.
But being shut, to keep all forth,
by means of pitche and tar:
This would I have you do with speed,
no time for to defarre.
And I will recompense your pains,
unto the utmost part:
That your requital shall exceed,
the full of your desert.
The Ioyner aunsweres her again,
with reverence due likewise:
O Madame mine, my skyll herein,
your purpose shall suffice.
I will so frame your Chest, that rain,
nor waters washing wane:
Nor mistes of foggie air shall come,
in this contrived cave.
So sone as homewarde I return,
to work thereon I mean:
So that or three days be expyrde,
it shall be finished clean.
And so he took his leave of her,
and homewarde does return:
And she being galde with former greefes,
begins a fresh to mourn.
The ceaselesse tears along her cheeks,
a printed pathe have made:
Her inward cares has forced quite,
her outward hew to vade.
Tormented thus with grisly grief,
her Chamber she does keep:
And solytarilie she sittes,
her wayling woes to weep.
And when that weariness constraines,
abroad her to soiorne:
Her woes do make her walks but short,
she makes a quick return.
But when before her Parents face,
she does appearaunce make:
She noynts her face with fine perfumes,
her sorrowing signs to break.
But least I should too tedious seem,
the Ioyner comes at last:
With pitched Chest, most closely framde,
the water for to cast.
And Iulia pays him doubble hyre,
his pains for to requight:
He takes the same with treble thanks,
and so departes her sight.
But when that Phoebe spread her light,
within the Welkin hye:
Her Maid and she conuayes the same,
(when none could it epsy)
Unto the shore, the Sea being near,
this secretly was wrought:
As for the Maid, of her deceyt,
God knows but little thought.
But she pretendes a farther fetch,
when midnight flood draws near:
A desperate deed, she has decreede,
as you forthwith shall hear.
When man and beast, and each thing else,
their natural rest does take:
When as her Maid with all the house,
Sir Somnus fleepes do shake.
When whistling winds do cease to blow,
when waters rage are still:
When wavering leaves, on shaking Trees,
do stay and cease to spyll.
When twinkling Stars amyd the skies,
most glysteringly do shine:
And every thing declares the night,
has wun his middle time.
Then desperate Iulia does arise,
and ventreth forth of door:
Where she her cursed Coffin found,
hard by the salt Sea shore.
But oh, draw near you Virgins all,
you Ladies here behold:
A trusty Dame, the faythfulst heart,
yframde of woman's moulde.
She stood upright within the Chest,
which waves yet moved not:
And casting often her eyes to land.
she thus lamentes her lot.
O God that gouernst heaven and hell,
the Sea and the dry land:
Vouchsafe for to receive my soul,
into thy gracious hand.
Which soul I first to thee bequeathe,
that long has lodgde in moude:
And durtie dross of clottered clay,
my body to the floode.
And since the soul of my dear freende,
has run his mortal race:
I hope our shapeles ghostes in Skies,
with joy shall both embrace.
And for the solemn sacred oath,
that we on earth have made:
Though direful death by destiny,
has causde our promise fade.
Yet do I trust amyd the heavens,
we shall the same fulfill:
Where jointly we may both enjoy,
thy Princely presence still.
You Parents, and my friends adieu,
I bid you both farewell:
Bewail not you, nor weep my want,
that needs no passing bell.
Keep not my funerals with wayles,
nor moist my death with tears:
For why, my coarse shall want no wet,
seeing Seas such moisture bears.
Though Fishes shall feed on my flesh,
my Dirge shall Sirens sing:
The friendly fish that Dolphin hight,
me to my grave shall bring.
BY this her barge on wallowing waves,
does swym in ruthful wise:
And she aloof in Seas alas,
to heaven does lift her eyes.
Desiring God in mercy great,
for to behold her case:
When as the byllowes against her boat,
does bounce and beat apace.
The waters drive her to the deep,
and floods sometime flash in:
Whose Isie cold to her full strange,
does wet her tender skin.
But she alas does lie along,
within this hollow womb:
And fastened sure the upper part,
of her vntymelie Tomb*
At last sir Boreas with his breath,
does drive her Ship from shore:
Which swifter slides upon the Seas,
then Boat by force of Ore.
Her body thus inclosde therein,
in quiuering sort does quake:
Like as the wavering Aspen leaf,
by Notus blaste does shake.
And when Titonia does appear,
to drive away the night:
Her tossed Bardge in midst of Seas,
is seen in open sight.
This day to Flint was day of doom,
this black day had no light.
This troublous time encreast their cares,
and made their day like night.
This was beginner of their greefes,
and ender of their joys:
This day did hold their heavy hearts,
in heaps of deep annoyes.
But when that Iulias Maid began,
from sluggishe sleep to rise:
And could not find her Misteresse there,
great fear does her supprise.
She runs up and down the house,
enquiring of each wight:
If they did not her Misterisse see,
since morning lent his light.
But when no word of her she heard,
she rent and tare her hair:
And to her Parents ran forthwith,
these ruthful news to bear.
She told them of the pitched Chest,
that she to shore had brought:
And how that of her meaning then,
no whit at all she thought.
These news did so amaze their minds,
their color ginnes to vade:
Such quaking fear within their hearts,
these tydinges true have made.
Their loathsome looks declares their grief,
and does express their pain:
His grief was such as could not weep,
she spent her tears amain.
Their household folks, and neighbors by,
bewayles their heavy hap:
And do lament their lucklesse loss,
at such a sudden clappe.
They all forthwith in mornefull wise,
to sea ward do repair:
Whose yelling cries and scriching soundes,
does fill the empty air.
The wambling waves, the crooked creekes,
their sorrowing cries resounde:
The belowing breath yt breaks their breasts,
does make the banks rebounde.
The Mother when she saw the print,
of Chest engrau'de in sands:
Did fall down straight into a sown,
and stretched forth her hands.
And when she was reuokte again,
unto her former state:
With faynting voice, she thus began speak,
why hindered you my fate?
Why suffered you not me to rest,
here dead upon this shore:
That washing waves might carry me,
to her that is my store?
But Fortune pitying of their playntes,
sendes Mercury with speed:
To Neptune God of swelling Seas,
to stay his force with speed.
For she would send a luckie Ship,
of Albanie to save:
The seely Maid that thus was toste,
within her careful cave.
This Hulke from foreign lands did come,
yfraught with traffikes trade:
And toward Albanie with haste,
his speedy passadge made.
The Seas were calm, ye winds blow still,
the lusty Mariners sing:
To think upon their pleasant gale,
they made the Seas to ring.
Thus Neptune was their trusty freende,
and Phoebus spread his light:
Which on the smoothe and waters calm,
does glyster fair and bright.
The Sun does shine upon the sails,
ystufte with wished blast:
And as they thus did cut the tide,
they spide the Chest at last.
Wherein Dame Iulia was enclosde,
and musde what it should be*
The Masters Mate did launche a Cock,
and quickly went to see.
What booty it was that they from bourde,
aloof in Seas espied:
He rows apace till he oretooke,
it tombling with the tide.
With grapling hooks, he forthwith hales,
this new found pray to Ship:
The Mariners help, through hope thereof,
on hatches fast they skip.
But when they had disclosde the same,
and found therein a Maid:
Of Princely favor, fresh and fair,
their hearts were sore afraid.
They mused how this chance should come,
and took her carkase weak:
Whose legs could not support her corpse,
nor yet her tongue could speak.
But being reuiu'de with vital drinks,
her joints retain their strength:
Her dazeled eyes received their sight,
her tongue did speak at length.
Then they demanded of her straight,
what chance had brought her thither:
Or who committed her to Seas,
to feel both wind and weather.
Whose seemly sight did so surpass,
and rather did deserve:
Amyd the troop of Courtly trains,
some Princely peer to serve.
Then she with heavy cheer (God knows)
began for to relate:
The whole discourse of all her grief,
and of her froward fate.
Desiring them of pity pure,
to grant her small request:
And of two things to grant her one,
which may procure her rest.
Either to throw her into Seas,
or carry her, where she
May lead a sole Religious life,
from cares to set her free.
Declaring then that when at first,
she closde her self in Chest:
She thought the waters from her woes,
would bring her days to rest.
But since that Fortune so was found,
to be her freendly foe:
Some foreign coast should her retain,
to extenuate her woe.
They did recomfort her again,
and bade her not dismay:
For that they were no Pirates pressed,
her body to betray.
Ne were they any letchers lewd,
of brutishe sauadge kind:
To spoil her chaste Uirginitie,
or mar her Maidens mind.
But bad her thank the heavenly powers,
that had ordained so:
That they amyd the surging waves,
her Chest by chance did know.
For they would so provide for her,
that she should have a place:
To spend her time in matelesse mirth,
and run a quiet race.
This said, they hoysted up their sails,
and forward fast did hye:
No froward winds did let their course,
their wished land to spy.
But puffing sails, with gladsome gales,
in wished wise did swell:
And swiftlyer did their Ship slide forth,
then any tongue can tell.
The caruing keele does cut the waves,
the maynsayle, topsayle, and
The Myssen spreete sail further course,
alofte the flagge does stand.
The Pylote marks his compass well,
and Card with tentiue eye:
The Masters mate does guide the Stern,
or Rudder rightfullie.
The Mariners on the Hatches close,
to dice do fall apace:
In token of a pleasant gale,
to further forth their race.
Thus sundring of the byllowes small,
(the coast being fair and clear)
At last the tops of haughty hills,
within their sight appear.
They pass the main Sea at the length,
and straight one does adresse
To sound, and cries alowde (my mates)
two fadomes quarter less.
Approaching nearer to the land,
each one his tackling plyes:
They stryke down sails, the Bark rode on,
with stealing steps likewise.
At Haven mouth they do discharge,
a fair tryumphant peale:
That to the Town they plainly may,
their voyage safe reveal.
The Cannons, Culuerings, Sakers, and
the Fawcons breathed fire:
The Demi pieces, Bassyliskes,
foul stynking flames did spyre.
The thundering shot did rore in The Air,
and Echo like does sound:
The banckes and craggie creekes like case,
do make the noise redound.
The flaunting Flagge does flourish forth,
that stood aloft on Mast:
The Anckors crookt with cables strong,
out of the Ship are cast.
And when they entered were on land,
within the Haven Town:
Th'inhabitaunts do welcome them,
with mirth and hye renown.
Each one makes merry with his friend,
they pass the time in joy.
But Iulia has no freendly mate,
to comfort her annoye.
You Maidens all, and Ladies both,
mark Iulias heavy state:
And take ensample by her love,
which sorrows could not bate,
Though once she had the world at will,
if she had kept her so:
Yet Love and Fortune many times,
do breed men mickle woe.
And though she passing panges did feel,
and all for Charles his sake:
She does no whit repent her greefes,
which she for him did take.
But to be brief, within this Town,
was kept a Monastery:
Where were a sort of nusled Nuns,
that lyu'de there solemnlie.
Wherein by suit she does obtain,
a Vestal Uirgins trade:
And there Religiously to live,
till vital breath did vade.
But now my wearied pen must pass,
from Iulias life a while:
(Who in Albania solie lives,)
to Charles I Will frame my style.
Who by this time recovered health,
and left his sickly bead:
And heard not yet of Iulias chance,
that thought him to be dead.
Now he pretendes to lincke with her,
his former vow to save:
Providing him such needful things,
as his affairs does crave.
And sent forthwith a Messenger,
his freende the Priest to pray:
To come to him, as promise was,
who came without delay*
They only two, their voyage framde,
this Marriage knot to tie:
Which they before, by solemn oath,
had sworn, but secretly.
Charles rode on toward Flint apace,
and thought him self well blessed:
That time was come for him to match,
with her he lyked best.
The nearer unto Flint he came,
the greater was his joy:
But when as he was thither come,
he felt as great annoye.
He deemde this time would make amends,
for all his former woes:
But it did more increase his cares,
then pen can well disclose.
When he was come to Wynefrides Church,
where as he longde to be:
He lyghted down where he was wont,
his Lady for to see.
There does he mean for to abide,
till Phoebus lost his light:
And that his sister Phoebe shynde,
who rules the clowdy night.
Then does he mean to send for her,
to finishe up the oath:
That each of them to others made,
by former plighted troth.
He little thought that she was gone,
to lead a Nunlyke life:
Or that in Albanie she was,
whom he should take to wife.
But as he walked in the yard,
with countenance full glad:
One comes and does declare the chance,
his doleful Iulia had.
And how she laid the Chest at shore,
and closde her self therein:
And how her death was sore bewaylde,
not only by her kin.
But also by all those that dwelt,
within the course of Flint:
Whose love of all to her was such,
their plaints they could not slint.
And how the flowing waters did,
orewhelme her Chest in Seas:
Whose body drenched so in floods,
does Parents grief increase.
You Loouers that unto your Dames,
are faithful just and true:
May note what sorrows touched Charles.
and made his heart to rue.
The frosen sound of which cold words,
did sterue his heavy heart:
Whose trickling tears did stay his tongue,
for to express his smart.
His present hue both wan and pale,
declard his inward grief:
His ruddy color now is gone,
he hopes of no relief.
His hollow eyes and staring looks,
his sighs and sobs extreme:
Are witness of his woeful state,
as did full plainly seem.
All mirth and pleasure now is gone,
converted soon to pain:
And where before he wished to live,
now does he life disdain.
Now deep despair has wun the place,
where hope before was fixed:
Affections lewd, and fancies fond,
amyd his thoughts are mixed.
In desperate wise he runs about,
devising every way:
How he might ease his corpse of cares,
that thus in strife does stay.
One while he means to run to shore,
to pearce his tender heart:
Where as his Iulia shipping took,
from Flint for to depart.
An other while he thought in Church,
his own decay to frame:
Where he at first infected was,
with Cupids fiery flame.
Again he thought to drown him self,
within the salt Sea flood:
Whereas his Iulia cast her self,
when on the shore she stood.
That by that means his carkase might,
be buried in that grave:
Which she in steed of Marble stone,
had chosen for her cave.
Or if the waters had by force,
cast up her corpse on sand:
He thought that Fortune would conduct,
him to that plot of land.
Thus tossed long with diverse thoughts,
these fancies pass away:
Then he begins to curse his lettes,
that did his promise stay.
He bannes his sickness which was cause,
of all his care and grief:
And wishes medcines had been bane,
which lent him late relief.
He cries on fates that have prolongd,
his lucklesse line of life.
And does desire his twiste to cut,
by dyrefull caruing knife.
But when the force of furies rage,
by fancies flaming fire:
Was quighte extinct, and reasons rule,
had coolde his hot desire.
With wisdom then he wisely ways,
his former fancies past:
And is decreede to stay bis mind,
by reasons rain at last.
This way to lead a wandering life,
the faithful youth can choose:
In forrayne lands to waste his days,
and mourn these noisome news.
But change of place cannot transform,
nor alter any mind:
Though air and soil he do exchange,
his grief does stay by kind.
He thought if in his country he,
should longer time abide:
The fresh remembrance of his love,
from him would never slide.
And that by traueyling long he should,
shake from his troubled mind:
These cutting cares and ceaselesse greefes,
which destenies assignde.
And being thus determined,
to take his unknown flight:
He does return unto the Priest,
that lodgde at Inn that night.
There unto him he tells his case,
and how he does pretend:
For to forsake his country straight,
with Father and each friend.
And that he will no more return,
till Fortune send some chance:
To banish all his present cares,
and passed joys t'aduaunce.
The Presbiter with good advise,
does counsel him again:
His fancies fond, and raging thoughts,
by reason to refrain.
Persuading him that though he change,
his country and his kin:
His mind shall mask in matelesse moan,
his sorrows will not lin.
And says good Sir, leave of your playnts,
let wisdom guide your will:
And let not youthful fancies fond,
oppress dame Reasons skyll*
Know this, that sorrow hurtful is,
to them that take the same:
And naught auayles them that be dead,
but is to men great shame.
Your mourning can not call the dead,
to former state of life:
Nor all the tears that you can shed,
cannot redeem your wife.
Your peregrines, your sighs and sobs,
your travail and your pain:
May not reduce your Iulia,
unto her life again.
You show therefore great want of wit,
as every man may see:
That do so vainly go about*
to will that may not be.
You know what destenies decree,
we must of force obey:
And what the fates ordain to yield,
with wylling mind always.
Consider that a wise man ought,
with patient mind to bear:
What so the Princely powers decree,
and neither hope nor fear.
In vain he seeks that goes about,
against the Heavens to strive:
Wherefore with reason rule your mind,
for Ladies are a live,
That are as comely as she was,
to whom you lent your love:
Whose favor you may eke obtain,
if you your mind remove.
Though Fortune now have causd your loss,
in breeding of your care:
Yet tarying time, she will again,
your former joys repair.
For as the pleasures that she lendes,
do not continue sure:
Even so the trouble that she sendes,
can not always endure.
Though she with frowning frosen face,
do lowre on you a while:
Yet does her favor come as fast,
when as she list to smyle.
A wise man in the mydst of cares,
with wit him self does arm:
So that no storms of sturdy strife,
can ought procure his harm.
For as the Poet Homer faynes,
that Aten barefoote goes:
She can not touch no hard thing sure,
but lightly treades on those
That armed are with constancy,
and patiently abide:
Each sturdy storm that Fortune sendes,
at every time and tide.
Whereby is meant calamity,
whereof she Goddess is:
Can not bereave a wise man's heart,
from quiet patient bliss.
But such as are of simple mind,
effemynate and base:
Whose tender hearts can not abide,
Dame Fortunes hye disgrace.
Wherefore good Sir, content your self,
with reason rule your mind:
Embrace Dame Patience in your breast,
so shall you comfort find.
Bestow your love within your stronde,
where are such store of Dames:
As you may largely take your choice,
and so quight quench your flames.
Consider if you do forsake,
your Parents and your friends:
And go into a place unknown,
then all your pleasures ends.
Ne dare I back return again,
for fear of future hap:
Your Parents both will wayle your loss,
wherefore prevent the trappe.
That may entangle them in grief,
and shorten not their days:
That have been careful for your life,
in all your passed ways.
Wherefore I crave, abolish will,
let wisdom you retain:
Let Prudence eke by due foresight,
prevent all future pain.
And take my counsel in good part,
that wylles you to be wise:
Nor let no greefes nor sorrows past,
your presents thought supprise.
When he had spent such words (as these)
Sir Charles did straight reply:
You have but wasted thus much wind,
I like it not perdie.
Not all the world can me persuade,
my Iulia to forget:
So steadfastly upon her love,
my constant heart is set.
I can not blot out of my mind,
her freendship and good will:
Which hitherto I have retaynd,
and so I will do still.
Her feature I do still behold,
within my careful mind:
Though she by death departed is,
and I am left behind.
Yet while I live her monument,
within my mind shall rest:
Which was her true and trusty heart,
within her constant breast.
Should I go seek to live in mirth,
or yet to have mine ease:
And she to lodge among the waves,
in mydst of surging Seas.
No no, no dangers shall prevail,
to make my heart to shrink:
Although it were in honest wise,
in saltishe Seas to sink.
I would upon my self revenge,
her death were yet no shame:
But that the law of God and man,
does quite forbid the same.
Yet do I hope as Fortune brought,
me to bestow good will:
So will she send some kind of means,
by chance my life to spyll.
But as the peryls of the Seas,
She did for me long take:
Even so the dangers of the land,
I Will suffer for her sake.
She reft of life, does ride on waves,
that here and there does raunge:
And I in wandering sort will pass,
through Countries far and strange.
No dangers shall affright my mind,
yea, were it for to pass:
Even down to hell for her sweet sake,
where Orpheus sometime was.
Therefore leave off your wastfull words,
for what I have decreede:
My purpose is not to delay,
but put in proof with speed.
When as the Priest perceived him,
his follyes to pursue:
And that he could not him persuade,
he does his rashness rue.
And began him self for to debate,
if he should back retire:
His Parents would suspect that he,
their sons death did conspyre.
He therefore thought it better way,
then to reuert again:
To go with him, though of his greefes,
he took some part of pain.
And thus being both determined,
not backwarde to return:
Sir Charles laments his love, the Priest
his Countries loss does mourn.
But Charles (God knows) had tryple cause,
for to lament in mind:
Who lost his love, and left both kin,
and Countries sight behind.
When they had ended all their plaints,
to Couche apace they hyde:
Where soking sorrows, for to sleep,
them utterly denyde.
Yet Nox by course, does run her race,
their cares thoe did not cease:
But as the night did wax away,
even so their greefes increase.
When Lucifer Dame Venus star,
does glister in the Sky:
In Eastern coast, denoting plain,
that Titans spowse is nie.
These woeful mates, arose forthwith,
from out their restless bed:
And to the I Will that Brittons callde,
I Will Mona, both they fled.
Where they like faithful friends do live,
but yet in mornefull wise:
As Orestes, and Pilades,
whose sorrows, books comprise.
Thus Charles still tossed, with crushing cares,
which vexed his secret heart:
To wayle his wastlesse woes often times,
would draw him self a part.
And to the Sun would thus complain,
O Titan it may be:
That thou this time by far reached looks,
my Iulias corpse do see.
I would thou had such uttering words,
as thou have shining beams:
Then would thou show, if now her bardge,
do floote on striving streams.
Or if the same on shore be cast,
by means of tossing tide:
O that thou would express to me,
where Iulia does abide.
Where so her coarse does rest, I would*
what danger so befell:
Remain with her, if thou to me,
her byding place would tell.
But since thou want the use of speech,
to bring me to her sight:
Yet for my sake bestow on her
(then wont) a freendlyer light.
When obscure clouds do dym thy beams,
and dark thy shining rays:
Let not her corpse yet want thy light,
that in the Seas decays.
Thus unto Fowls, to Trees and Beasts,
and stones he would complain:
As though they wit and senses had,
his meaning to retain.
The land of Ladies breed his grief,
and Music causde his moan:
Their sugared words, myrthes, silver tunes,
in grief would make him groan.
The Priest also laments his lot,
as he alone does trace:
And often to his Countries soil,
his staring eyes would gaze.
He wishes still her carkase there,
where as his heart does rest:
Such troubled thoughts he carries aye,
within his beating breast.
But few affection fond can tame,
or Cupids force withstand:
For grief and love, are void of rest,
both bound in sorrows band.
If body might fly where the mind
is oftentimes retaind:
Full many would not use that place,
where else they are constraind.
Thus though they use t'acquaint themselves
with states, and of the best:
Yet could no pleasures purchase place,
within their careful breast.
Incessaunt cares thus pyning them,
redoubling daily woes:
They thought to seek their deaths forthwith
amyd their blooddy foes.
They gin therefore t'enquire for wars,
Where often death is found,
Before the time: where bloody blows,
in boisterous sort abound.
That using feats of manly Mars,
they may cut of their care:
And rather shorten up their lives,
then live still in despair.
When Lady Ver had thinly clothed,
Sir Tellus gay with green:
Since their arrival there where now,
nine quarters they have been.
The men of Albanie that time,
were at a civil war:
As Fortune sends sometimes luck,
for Regions nie and far.
The King was feign to send for aid,
to Mona, where he had:
Well furnished men, whereof the Priest,
and Charles were very glad.
The courtesy that Charles this while,
used in this Island Town:
Did draw the hearts of many men,
that were of hye renown.
He therefore joyful at these news,
did move his suit as then:
To Chyrall of the I Will to have,
the chardge of hundredth men.
Such freendship he therein obtaynde,
that though a stranger borne:
Yet did they grant to him his suit,
and thought thereof no scorn.
Thus Virtue makes a stranger often,
full natural to grow:
Within a forrayne country strange,
where no man does him know.
The Governor of the I Will that time,
did here report of right:
Of Charles his skyll in Martial feats,
who was a valiant Knight.
Whose courage stout (yet mylde and meek)
with forward actiuenesse:
Declarde although his years were raw,
his prowess and worthiness.
For wisdom had bestowed on him,
her precious gifts at large:
Which rather furthred his request,
to have a Cheeftaynes charge.
The Soldiers lyked so of him,
that they do all agree:
With frank consent, that he on them,
a Governor should be.
He being chosen Captain now,
to go to Alban land.
Selected him an expert man,
Lieutenaunt of his band.
The Ancient bearer he did choose,
his Ensign to display:
The Sergeant Corporal to keep,
his Soldiers in array.
A Trumpeter with mighty breath,
to sound the feats of war:
The Phife and Drumster with his sticks,
to make the Drum to jar.
The Priest he also does appoint,
in Office for to stand:
As fit for him to keep his book,
as Clarke of all his band.
A gallant Galley was ordaind,
the Soldiers to transport:
Wherein they went, and quickly came,
to king of Albans Court.
Of whom they were well entertaynd,
the Tents forthwith prepared:
And strongly pitched, the Trenches delued,
the regal Camp to guard.
The light Horsemen, with Jack and Spear,
and steelly cappes forth went:
To scoute abroad, the Lances straight,
to rescue them were sent.
In prison paths, least enemies,
should passage have that way:
Old sturdy Stagers, wise in wars,
in secret ambush lay.
Munitions, Rampyres, forth were framde,
them from their foes to sheeld:
The brazen pieces carried were,
that fittest were for feeld.
The Rebels likewise had prepared,
a power huge and tall:
The Varlets meant (but God would not)
to give their Prince a fall.
The Wings, ye Fronts, the Battle main,
were ordered on each side:
The Ensigns noted how the one,
the others force defide.
The Hoastes now marched in Battle ray,
till both sides were in view:
And eke in reach, then Trumpetters,
an eger Onset blew.
Round boisterous balls of sturdy steel,
the Cannons breathes about:
The Curriers and Calliuers then,
their leaden pellets shoute.
The prauncing Coursers with this noise,
to wrekefull wrath were mou'de:
The worthy wights, on trampling Steeds,
their passing prowess prou'de.
Their Horsemen pearst, with Lance do lie,
of Helmets quite bereau'de:
Their Pikemen in like sort do lie,
their woeful wounds receau'de.
The Pikemen, losing Burkonet,
and Spear likewise ybroke:
With manly force of stubborn strength,
does stryke full many a stroke.
His Arming swoorde, then forth he draws,
him self for to defend:
Wherewith he maymes his enemies fearce,
that seek his life to end.
The wounded men to Cabin hyes,
to staunche their wasting blood:
The maimed men, and dead men flote,
aloft in crimsone flood.
When thus a while the armies fought,
the Princess party wun:
By tracing ground, they got of them,
both wind and shining Sun.
Sir Phoebus blerde the Rebels eyes,
his glistering beams so shinde:
Their sight obscured was with smoke,
that flewe with blaste of wind.
Thus wind and sun assyst the King,
and God would have it so:
The Rebels Camp, no order kept,
but scattered too and fro.
Some here, some there, for succor fled,
some backwardes run apace:
The ventrous victors Prince his side,
with speed pursues the chase.
Retyring now they are struck down,
the Trumpets gladly sound:
Their back retraite, with joyful tunes,
does Echo like rebound.
Such evil happes prepared are,
for them that do assay:
Against their regal Prince to rise,
with swoorde in hand to slay.
If any Captain there wun Fame,
then Charles did purchase praise:
Who did excel each Soldier there,
in all his warlyke ways.
He ventred more, his cares compeld,
he desperate was in deed:
And Fortune furthred his attempts,
and sent him freendly speed.
The victor King, when foes were foylde,
assigned Cheeftaines than:
To guard the Holds that Rebels kept,
before the broyle began.
Each one was poynted to his place,
and Charles as Fortune lent:
Unto the Town, where Iulia lives,
with Garrison was sent.
Though froward Fortune at the first,
does show her envious guile:
Yet at the last she turns her wheel,
and then does smoothly smile.
He naught surmisde such blisfull lot,
unawares was him assygnde:
Or that he should his Iulia see,
for whom he mournde in mind.
But Fortune lo, unlooked for,
to Iulias sight him brought:
Whose carkase long ago consumde,
amyd the Seas he thought.
Thus Charles with courage took his course,
and does his voyage bend:
With those his men unto the Town,
which he should now defend.
As soon as to the Town he came,
he walked the walls about:
To spy if any breach were there,
to enter in or out.
And walking thus when as the Sun,
had almost run his race:
He did epsy a troop of Dames,
that came with solemn pace.
Which were the Lady Prioresse,
with Nuns that came behind:
Who walking were about the walls,
to recreate their mind.
He marched forward toward them,
and they to him likewise:
And Charles upon these modest Dames,
does fix his gazing eyes.
Both began each other to salute,
with such a modest cheer:
That what in words twixt them did want,
in gesture did appear.
This holy route, by two in rank,
did orderly pass by:
And as they went, Sir Charles on them,
does cast attentive eye.
Among the which Dame Iulia was,
who had of him a sight:
And he again surueyde her shape,
and took therein delyght.
Two sorts of folk the eye will first,
be sure for to behold:
Either a freende that's well beloved,
or else an enemy old.
Her feature better pleased his mind,
as Nature wild it so:
Then all the beauty of the rest,
that were within the row.
And she again did fancy him,
whom she in mind did guess:
The featured form of Charles his face,
in countenance to express.
Her wayling weeds and vestall robes,
which she that time did wear:
Disguised her, that scarce her face,
could in his sight appear.
His headpeece likewise which he wore,
with cewrates clasped one:
His sleeves of Mayle, with other things,
made him to her unknown.
But though apparel seemed strange,
and made them to surmise:
Yet they each other did suspect,
by only view of eyes.
The mind sometimes will guess and judge,
that which the eye knows not:
As their two minds, each other knew,
the sight their forms forgot.
Thus both suspended in suspect,
away they both do go:
The one not knowing the others name,
as chance appointed so.
The doubtless Fame of both their deaths,
with strangeness of attire:
Made them to hang in ceaselesse doubts*
and slack for to inquire.
By this the Stars in Firmament,
like twinkling sparckes arise:
And night compels each one depart,
to rest their weary eyes.
Charles went to bed, but took small rest,
her shape renewde his thought:
And made his musing mind to mask,
where fancies fond him brought.
The morning now appears bright,
Charles and the Priest with speed:
Do rise, and to the Church to pray,
to go they are decreede.
But Charles his mind was chiefly bent,
his fancied face to see:
And to behold his Iulia,
yet thought it was not she.
When into Church they entered were,
they might behold in sight:
A Table hang over the head,
of every Nun aright.
Wherein insculped were their names,
according to their place:
Thus after Charles had said his prayers,
he lyfted up his face.
And began to read these written names,
there present to their sight:
Until they came unto the name,
that Charles did most delight.
At last within a Table fair,
in Roman letters fine:
Iulia Brittania written was,
there open to their eyne:
This name reuiu'de his dulled sprites,
this comforted his heart:
This brought his passed pleasant joys,
and ended present smart.
Now he records within his mind,
that Iulia is the Maid:
Which he at his arrival viewde,
while he their passage stayde.
Yet faynting fear does make him dout,
least one of them there were:
Among the Nuns to him unknown,
that did this name eke bear.
Again, he hopes that Fortune might,
convey her to that place:
From greedy jaws of fishfull floods,
thus doubted he the case.
That virtue is rare and seldom,
his stay eke very strange:
Whose state (tho it be good or ill)
Dame Fortune cannot change.
He took his pen and ynke in hand,
and wrote under the same:
In his own speech and Brittishe tongue,
his right and proper name.
So under Iulia Brittania there,
he Charles Brittania writ:
That she might read the same, when she
came there again to sit.
He also wrote where he abode,
and in what street or Inn:
The chardge also that he did hold,
he writ likewise therein.
Now his affairs constrains him,
for to depart away:
For to provide the Towns defense,
as much as in him lay.
They thence depart with gladsome minds,
in hope of future joy:
These gladsome news that he has seen,
drives out all dark annoye.
Within a while the Prioresse,
with all her Nuns drew nigh:
And into Church they roundly came,
when Charles was gone perdye.
The Vestall Virgins, two and two,
toward their seats resort:
And set them down each in her seat,
as was their usual sort.
Iulia, likewise approaching near,
by sudden chance did see:
In pendent Table over her place,
more written then should be.
When morning prayers were finished,
no time before she found:
She read these lines, the view whereof,
does make her joys abound.
Her pleasures banished all care,
she knew that Charles was he:
Which she by tracing near the walls,
before her face did see.
The Prioresse when all is done,
does homeward hye again:
The Sun had compassed the South,
and shows his heat amain.
The dinner time was now at hand,
to dinner straight they went:
Charles all this while did long to hear.
how he his writing spent.
When as the Prioresse dyned had,
then Iulia goes with speed:
Desiring of her Mistrisse then,
to grant her leave in need.
For she a Brother had that was,
but lately come to Town:
Who was a Cheeftayne of a band,
appointed by the Crown.
For to defend that City there,
and that she saw him not:
Those three years space, the Prioresse,
her leave did then alot.
Assygning one to go with her,
a Vestall Virgin eke:
She takes her way with speedy space,
with Charles forthwith to speak.
They both unto their Chamber came,
and found the Priest and he:
Conferring closely twixt them selves,
who should that Iulia be.
There Iulia viewed her Charles a space,
with freendly greeting shown:
His Head piece then was laid aside,
which made him better known.
His heart did give him it was she,
whom he in mind did love:
Thus both as strangers stood a space,
and could no whit remove.
But when they did each other know,
their tears ran down like rain:
These sudden joys, that then they felt,
their speech did quite restrain.
He claspes her hard within his Arms,
his tears like Fountains flow:
And she her Arms about his neck,
does strongly close also.
The one the other so embraste,
She clang as close to him:
As Hero to Leander did,
when he to Sest did swim.
Ulysses and Penelope,
conceau'd no greater joy:
When after spoil he hasted home,
from ten years siedge of Troy.
At length these words to her he spoke,
O Iulia this thy sight:
Has causde my passing pleasures great,
and put my cares to flight.
And art thou her whom I supposde,
by death to be destroyde?
Have these mine eyes once more of thee,
their present joys enioyde?
Come Death now when thou will to me,
for I have lyu'de to view:
Her only sight, whom I always,
have found my friend most true.
Now do I not desire to live,
but only for thy sake:
That dydst the peryls of the Seas,
for me so undertake.
And art thou she which fell report,
did brute the tide had torn?
Art thou the wight that have for me,
those passed peryls borne?
O Fortune now thou fauourest me,
though long time thou did frown:
Thou have conducted us both safe,
to cast our sorrows down.
Now may we knit that faithful knot,
which we before had sworn:
Now I accoumpt me happy thrice,
that once was thought forlorn.
I never thought to view thy face,
but that the Dolphin fearce:
Should in the steed of funerals,
have made her corpse thy hearce.
But since once more I have thy sight,
ere thou do part me froe:
Where I have naught but Parents left,
I will my life forgo.
Now will we back reuert with speed,
to view our friends again:
Who for our loss have long bewaylde,
in bitter grief and pain.
When he made mention of their friends,
her tears she could not hold:
And unto Charles with weeping words,
this heavy tale she told.
O my dear Charles, how have the heavens
thus raised up our joys:
That once were plunged in the pit,
of deadly deep annoyes?
I never thought to view thy face,
when Fame did blaze thy death:
Or that we should perform the vow,
that we had sworn by faith.
The loss of thee did grieve me more,
then any tongue can tell:
No freende but thee I did accoumpt*
as thou may find right well.
My Parents think, their Daughter dead,
but Fortune suffered not:
And since thou lyu'ste, I may accoumpt,
right luckie was my lot.
The dangers that I have abode,
all only for thy love:
Not my report, but present state,
most perfectly can prove.
Yet do I coumpt them all but light,
ne did I mean while life:
Since thou wast gone, whylst I did live,
to be a wedded wife.
But for thy sake to spend my days,
within that sacred place:
Where I might waste my weary time,
for to lament my case.
But since the fates have us preseru'de,
contrary to our thought:
I yield me now unto thy will,
to use thy mind in ought.
I know thou will not swerue from bounds,
of Virtues sacred lore:
But wylt regard my Maidens mind,
as thou have done tofore.
Until we knit the nuptial knot,
which yeeldes us lasting leave:
To join in fruits of Marriage Rytes,
till death do us bereave.
If it be so your mind reuert,
contrary to your vow:
Then grant that in the steed of wife,
your servant me t'allowe.
When she these words had uttered,
his crystal tears distylde:
From out the fountain of his eyes,
which at that time were fylde.
He said, O Iulia leave those words,
you do me double wrong:
To think that I should now recant,
and loouing you so long.
Why should you so submit your self,
to me that am unmeet:
To match with you in Marriage state,
you show your humble spreete.
I had a heart more hard then flint,
or any sturdy steel:
If I should scorn your love that did,
for me such sorrows feel.
If you had been of basest blood,
that ever could be found:
Your Virtue would persuade my mind,
in Marriage to be bound.
I think my self well recompest,
for all my hurtful harms:
That Fortune once has given me leave.
to claspe thee in mine arms.
Wherefore rejoice, for ere long time,
we will depart this land:
To rue our Parents and our friends,
with in our native strand.
Who will be glad of our return,
and pardon our offense:
That have thus long in unknown land,
as exyles been from thence.
Now Phoebus steedes do lodge in West,
and night with darksome shade:
Begins to ouerspreade the earth,
when Iulia and the Maid,
Departed home, and Charles likewise*
to Coutch does now return:
Where as he rests in gladsome glee,
that erst in cares did mourn.
When Eous dame Phoebus steed,
discovered had the light:
And Sol amyd the Hemisphaere,
Dame Nox had banished quight.
Then Charles repaired to the King,
desiring a discharge:
Of Captains room: the Prince did grant,
rewarding him at large.
And frankly paid him for his pain,
appointing him t'assigne:
Whom he thought meet, as Captain over,
his Garrison to reygne.
Then he to Iulia back returns,
appointing out of hand:
His Lieutenant that had the charge,
for to conduct the band.
He also got for Iulia leave,
of Prioresle with speed:
To go with him, who thought she was,
his Sister borne in deed.
Charles, of the Soldiers takes his leave,
and of his friends also:
Who sorry are, that he from them,
in such a sort should go.
And she of Lady Prioresse,
does take her last adieu:
Her parture was bewailed sore,
of all the Vestall crew.
Thus Charles and Iulia with the Priest,
and Iulias Maid went down,
Unto the Rhode, where then did ride,
the Navy of the Town.
There Charles does hyre a Ship forthwith,
him and the rest to frayght:
They enter in, they hoyse up Sails,
and take their passage straight.
The Ordinance are then dischargde,
the Trumpets sound amayne:
The Soldiers byds their Captain then,
farewell, though to their pain.
The wind is calm, the tide does serve,
the Fishes finely play:
A gentle gale of pleasant blaste,
does drive them swift away.
They still continewed on their course,
good Fortune was their guide:
Until their Ship in Cambria soil,
at wished Rhode does ride.
From thence with speed, to Flint they hide,
where they no sooner came:
But tydinges of these luckie news,
to Parents came by Fame.
Sir Gaulfride with his wife repayrde,
in haste their Son to meet:
And Owen with his Lady came,
their Iulia for to greet.
When Charles and Iulia saw their Sires,
and Mothers in like case:
They fell down flat upon their knees,
desiring them of grace.
And pardon for their great offense,
which love, not they had wrought:
And that the affection that they bare,
this trespass past had brought.
Their Parents pearst with pity then,
and melting into tears:
Forgave them this so great offense,
of their unbridled years.
Each side agrees to Marry them,
or they away depart:
That had by proof a trial true,
of eythers faithful heart.
The wedding day appointed was,
to Owens Court they go:
For to provide the Nuptial feast,
great charges they bestow.
The fixed time is now at hand,
the gladsome Loouers rise:
And put on them their wedding ray,
preparde in sumptuous wise.
The Mother deckes her Daughter then,
in Vesture ritche and fine:
Charles wantes no costly garments gay,
that may content the eyne.
Her Tresses trymde on shoulders hang,
ybound with silver lace:
As custom was, and is this day,
in England in some place.
Her curled Crine, were frizled fine,
her fingers small beset:
With Rings most rich, and Diamonds brave,
the best that they could get.
Her forehead fine, with Byllamont,
beset with Pearls she ware:
Her seemly hair, like golden wyre,
hung down both fresh and fair.
Her Partlet with the sleeves agreede,
wrought all with silver fine:
The glistering spangs that hung thereby,
like twinkling Stars did shine.
Her Gown was made of Velvet black,
with silver fringe about:
Her Kyrtle on white Tynsell cut,
which through the cuts shines out.
Her Chain five fold about her neck,
with precious stones bedight:
As Diamonds, Emralds, Saphires fine,
which glistred fair and bright.
Her Tablet rich, had also a
Quadrangle Diamond brave:
Besmearde within with Ciuet fine,
the best that man might have.
A Chain also about her waste,
in steed of Bridely belt:
And thus bedect, she quite forgets,
the sorrows that she felt.
To Church they go, and Charles between,
two Chinals on each side:
Two ancient Knights, of spotless fame,
to Church do lead the Bride.
The true Love knot that time was knit,
and fyrmde between them two:
Which naught within the world can loose,
till death do them undo.
Gaulfride and Owen with their wives,
and all their noble train:
With speed return from out the Church,
and homewarde hye again.
To dinner now, they all do go,
where daynties do abound:
They want no solemn silver tunes,
that Musickes Art can sound.
The Sun did seem to leap for joy,
the Birds delyghted more:
In densed groves about the Court,
then they were wont before.
The feast being now solemnized,
Dame Nox does Tellus clad:
Which mantell made of pitchie clouds,
and with her darksome shade:
The Supper being ended then,
they spend the time in play:
With Maskes, and other pastimes brave,
as fittest for that day.
A Princely bed ordained was,
the Ladies all a roe:
Brought Iulia to her spowsefull Coutche,
as custom is also.
Such Delycates prepared was,
as for that time was fit:
A Posset sweet, besprent with Spice,
for Iulia then they get.
She drinks then to the Maidens all,
and byds them all adieu:
And says to them, thus long I have,
remaynd a Virgin true.
But now farewell Virginity,
the flower of Virtues praise:
God grant you to be Virgins pure,
until your Marriage days:
The Ladies then from Chamber went,
and Charles does come to bed:
Where usual sportes frequented were,
till fancy waxed dead.
And when the force of Venus fire,
was quenched for a space:
These Loouers then to lose no time,
each other do embrace.
To kissing then, they kindly fall,
their minds for to content:
But how should I express their joys,
that lack experiment.
Let it suffice what Nature wild,
in such a kind of case:
They both fulfilde, and God has wild,
for man to tread that trace.
You Loouers that have tried like tricks,
with them you looued best:
May judge by your forepassed joys,
they took but little rest.
As for my part, I am but green,
my years unripe and raw:
That never yet assayde the force,
of Cupids wanton law.
But let us leave these Loouers thus,
a myd their sweet delight:
That in the fruits of wedlock bands,
do waste the weary night.
The feast continewed long, whereat
men had no need to fast:
But as each thing serves for a time,
so end all things at last.
The feast being done, the couenaunts made,
such bands that time were framde:
As touching lands and Marriage goods,
that needs not here be namde.
Let it suffice, they had enough,
their state for to maintain:
Which done, Sir Gaulfride with his wife,
returned home again.
Sir Charles then with his Sire in law,
does mean in Flint to dwell:
And resting thus, with Iulia*
he lykes his tarying well.
He had not there soiorned long,
not past two months or more:
But that such heavy news did come,
as made his heart full sore.
For Letters came, his aged Sire,
was now departing life:
And very sick, his charge lay then,
to leave his loouing wife.
Whom he alas, had thought to see,
when he came back again:
But Fortune gave him his farewell,
which put them both to pain.
Behold her false and flattering face,
that fleeres with feigned cheer:
Whose whyrling wheel does turn each hour,
as now it may appear.
My Muse alas does fail me now,
my senses serve me not:
My quaking quyll in quiuering hand,
does make my pen to blot.
My tears does so bedew my style,
that I ne scarce can wright:
My staring hair, upon my head,
through fear does stand upright.
Wherefore you furies me assist,
Alecto be mine aid:
Maegaera grym, and Tisiphon,
come help me now dismayde.
These woeful Letters being read,
then Charles does haste anon:
He posting rydes, but ere he came,
his sorrowful Sire was gone.
Who royally possessed his grave,
with funerals most fit:
But Fortune now disposed was,
her poisoned spite to spit.
Charles does in Anglesie abide,
in order to dispose:
His fathers goods that lately dyed,
whereof the greefes arose.
This Anglesie an Island is,
enuironde on each side:
With surging Seas, an arm whereof,
from Wales does it divide,
Whereto they go in passage Boats,
that at the floods does rise:
And Ferie men transport them over,
as Passengers likewise.
Iulia, mysliking that her Spowse,
does use such long delay:
To Anglesie does mean to go,
to know his cause of stay.
And also for to view the lands,
that there she did possess:
Her coming thither was the cause,
of all her deep distress.
In purple Wagon she does ride,
with all her comely row:
Until she came unto the flood,
that parts the Countries so.
Then to a wherrie Boat she goes,
but mark what did ensew:
The waltring waves do roughly rise,
and boisterous tempests blew.
The whyrling winds do raise the waves,
the floods in Boat do flash:
And sturdy storms of tempests strange,
against their faces dash.
The Boat with sturdy storms does stand,
in staggring state alas:
And neither back nor forward could,
from present perryll pass.
The waters still increasing thus,
the Boat was fylde to brim:
And Iulia then amyd her woes,
in washing waves does swim.
At last over laden with the weight,
of waters to the brinke:
The stely Iulia, more the rueth,
in surging deep does sink.
The woeful wights that strive with waves,
on God for mercy call:
Their pitteous plaints, and shriking cries,
does pearce the Air withal.
And Iulia while her Fardingale,
held up her careful corse:
O Savior (cries) on thy handmayde,
with mercy take remorse.
Lose me not whom thou have redeemde,
with blood of thy dear heart:
O Charles take now my last farewell,
for now I must depart.
By this her clothes being throwly wet,
does cause her carkase sink:
Which makes my quaking heart to quayle,
when on her state I think*
The churlish Channel drowned her corpse,
whose Virtue aye did shine:
The loss of her lamentfull was,
that had the Seas for shrine.
Yea whom the floods on maynest Seas,
did suffer for to escape:
A broken branch, or arm thereof,
deuowres her seemly shape.
The ruethfull rumor of this chance,
was scattred here and there:
(When harms begin, they fall by heaps)
and came to Charles his ear.
Alas this chance might well be sparde,
for Charles already had:
A heavy hap, the death of Sire,
which made his heart full sad.
When as he heard this ripe report,
he lost his senses quight:
In madding mood, now here, now there,
he runs with troubled spright.
If that I had ten thousand pens,
I could not write his pain:
Which for the loss of his dear love,
he did that time sustain.
Whose churlish chance so chose by fate,
does wash my cheeks with tears:
That such a virtuous worthy wight,
should thus cut off his years.
But to be brief, he forthwith does,
a poisoned drink provide:
Of Hemlocke, Henbaine, and like herbs,
none knew, but one beside.
Then two days thence, with merry cheer,
he calls for Horse in haste:
And bade his friends and men to come,
to search where she was cast.
With blown Bealts, with Boats and Hooks,
with Drags and Ropes they go:
To fish for her, whose lothed loss,
did breed this wastlesse woe.
But Charles unto a Barge ascendes,
and byds the Boats man tell:
Where as his Iulias corpse did sink,
when surging waves did swell.
The Boat man said, Sir Charles eue^ here,
your Iulias body sunk:
With that he drew him forth a glass,
and up this poison drunk.
All they had thought how that it was,
a drink to swage his thurst:
They naught supposde the force thereof,
would make his bowels burst.
With that he suddenly does leap,
into the waters deep:
That men might know his constant heart,
from danger could not creep.
And there he sinkes, no help preuayles,
the fates decreede his time:
No dread he had, thus fancy fond,
procurde his sinful crime.
The cause wherefore he drunk this drink,
was least that nature should,
Provoke him for to save him self,
by swimming as he could.
Or if the sweetness of his life,
should make him faint through fear:
And so he should prolong his days,
those bitter brunts to bear.
The Story says, that they were found,
embracing both together:
And nothing strange, who once were saved,
in spite of wind and weather.
And no great marueyle can it be,
since they in life liu'de so:
As neither Seas nor lands preuaylde,
to part each other fro.
This shows as well the force of love,
as did the envious state.
Of Etocles, and Polynices,
express the force of hate.
They both were buried in one Tumbe,
and had one solemn shrine:
Their Funerals did force the tears,
of many weeping eyne.
And being closde within the vaulte,
both in one careful cave:
This Epitathe which long remaynd,
was graven on their grave.
In ancient Brittishe ryme it was,
with Letters all of gold:
That every one that passed by,
might their estate behold.
Upon our Tumbe pour forth your plaints,
you friends that pass this way:
And on our Grave, behold the state,
of our unsteadfast stay.
TWo faithful hearts of noble blood,
sometimes we did express:
Though destenies have thus decreede,
our ends without redress.
And though amyd our greenest years,
where life has highest power:
The heau^nly powers decreede by death,
our corpse for to deuowre.
And that our steadfast love alas,
has (...) our own decay:
Yet that our souls in heav^^ (...)
O Passengers do (...)
You Loouers that do (...)
ere you go by vou^^saue:
With lyfted hands and moysted tears,
to wet our freendly grave.
We have been Loouers as you be,
you shall be as we are:
We now have past the panges of love,
you yet must suffer care.
If you do love, we did the like,
and living looued aye:
And now under this stone we lie,
closde up in slymie claye.
Our pomp is past, our pride is gone,
so is our vain delight:
We are returned to that we were.
and so must every wight.
Our careful minds that could not rest,
are now extinct by dust:
And as we two are gone before,
so follow needs ye^ must.
Remember therefore as you love,
hereafter you shall live:
Take heed least to affection fond,
your mind you wholly give.
(...) in beauties beams,
(...) and clay:
And know that flesh at last shall vade,
and beauties flower decay.
Let Virtue be your guide in all,
so shall you love aright:
And fix no fancy on the face,
wherein is vain delight.
THis long continewed on their grave,
till time did it deface:
And so likewise did tract of time,
their careful grave disgrace.
I would all Loouers so to love,
as Iulia and her Pheare:
Yet would I wish them not to be,
so desperate as they were.
That Love may have that Love requires,
(excep't be sin) God send:
And let all Loouers pray, that Love
may have a better end.
Thus ends the Tragical history of Charles and Iulia.
FINIS.
