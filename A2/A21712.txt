By the Queen. A Proclamation against the maintenance of Pirates.
THE Queens Majesty understands, that although by her former
commandments notified by proclamation to all her subjects, and namely to
her officers in her Ports, for the staying, ceassing, and suppressing of all
occasions of piracies: yet some numbers of vessels armed with certain
disordered persons mixed of sundry nations, do still haunt the narowe seas, and
resort secretly into small Creekes and obscure places of this Realm for
relief of vitayles, and such like: And for their better defense to escape
apprehension, do colourably pretend that they be licenced to serve on the
seas, and are not to be accounted culpable as pirates. For remedy whereof, and
to the intent no manner of pretext shall serve either such persons to commit
piracies, or any other that shall relieve them for private gain or favor by
feigned colors or pretense of ignorance: Her Majesty straightly charge and
commands all manner officers and ministers, having rule and charge within any
Port town, or having authority to make deputies under them in any Creek or
landing place whersoeuer the same be, that from henceforth no manner of person
coming from the sea, be suffered to have any vittayle, munition, or any other
relief for him self, his company, or vessel, except it be such as are
notoriously known to apparteyne to merchants ships, passengers, or
fishermen, having need thereof. Neither that any person do bye or receive any
wares or goods of any person directly or indirectly coming from the seas,
until the same wares or goods be brought and landed openly according to the
laws of the Realm in places accustomed, with consent of the officers of the
customs, and that all duties be first paid for the same, according to the
usage of merchants, upon pain that whosoever shall do the contrary, or be
consentyng thereto, shall be upon due information committed to prison, there to
remain without bail, until inquisition be made (according to the laws of
this Realm) of them and their factes, as in cases of piracies, and to be
adjudged and executed as pirates, as by law shall be ordered. And whosoever
shall give information hereof against any officer of the customs, or any their
deputies, and shall be able to prove the same, if any wise the Infourmer be meet
to exercise the same office, they shall enjoy the same, or otherwise shall be
duly and liberally recompensed according to their demerites.

Furthermore her Majesty wylleth and commands all manner her officers, and
specially Wardens of Ports, Uiceadmiralles, Constables, or Capitaynes of
Castles upon the seas, and al other having any office in Port towns or places
of landyng, that they shall forth with, as they will answer at their
uttermost peril, to do their uttermost in their jurisdictions to enquire, lay
wait, and thereby apprehende al manner of persons that do haunt the seas with
any kind of vessels armed, being not an apparaunt merchant, and utterly to
stay all others making preparation thereto, and their vessels, other then such
only as shall be openly known to be ordinary merchants, passengers, or usual
fisshermen: And not from henceforth to allow or admit any allegation of
license to sail upon the seas with any vessel armed, but such as are
notoriously belongyng to her Majesty, and may be sent to the seas for keeping
the same free from pirates. And if any manner of person shall herein be found
culpable, or manyfestly negligent: her Majesty lets them certaynely to
understand, that their punishment shall be pursued against them with such
severity, as the example thereof shall hereafter remain for others to beware
how in such cases to offend.

Given at Otelande the third day of August, 1569. in the eleventh year of her
Majesty's reign. God save the Queen.
