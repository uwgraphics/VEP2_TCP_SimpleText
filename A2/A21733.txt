By the Queen.
FOr as much as the Queens Majesty our Sovereign Lady, is credibly informed
that the infection of the plague is at this present in sundry places in and
about the City of London, and in other places near adjoining to the same,
whereas by the continuance thereof, through the greater repair and resort of
her loving subjects, great peril and danger might not only ensue unto her
most royal person, but also to her most loving Subjects, repairing thither
for their suites and causes, and thereby also give occasion of dispersing of
the same in other parts of the Realm. Her Majesty for the said necessary
consyderations, and hoping that the same will by the goodness of almighty
God, with the coldness of the year, and such wholesome orders as are taken in
her said City, the rather cease by the adiornement of part of this next
Term of Saint Michael now at hand, from the vtas of the same, until the
fourth return of the said Term, called Mensis Michaelis next coming. Her
Majesty therefore of her especial favor and clemency, is pleased and
contented to adiourne the said Term of Saint Michael, that is to say, from
the vtas thereof, unto the said fourth return of the said Term, called
Mensis Michaelis next coming, which her Majesty signifies to all and
singular her loving subjects of this her Realm, to the intent that they and
every of them which has cause or commandment to appear in any of her
highness Courts at Westminster, in or at any day or time from and after the
said vtas of Saint Michael, may tarry at their dwellings, or where their
business otherwise shall lie, without resorting to any of the said Courts for
that cause, before Mensis Michaelis next coming, and that without danger of
forfaiture, penalty, or contempt to incur toward her highness in that
behalf. And nevertheless her Majesty's pleasure is, that two of her Justices,
that is to say of either Benche one, shall the first day of Michaelmas Term,
called Octabis Michaelis, according to the ancient order of her laws keep the
Essoynes of the said Octabis Michaelis: at which vtas of Saint Michael,
writtes of adiournement shall be directed to the said Justices, giving them
authority to adiourne the said Term of Saint Michael, that is to say, from
the vtas thereof, until Mensis Michaelis, as before is said: And the said
adiournment shall be made in the first day of the said vtas, commonly called the
day of the Essoynes. And further her Majesty's pleasure is, that all matters,
causes, and suites depending in any of her other Courts between party and
party, as in her highness Courts of Chauncerie, Star chamber, and
Exchequer, Courts of wards and Liueries, Duchy of Lancaster, and Court of
requests, shall have continuance, and the parties shall have day from the
date of these presents unto Mensis Michaelis, as before is said.

Provided always, and her Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, that all
Collectours, Receauers, Sheriffs, and other accomptauntes, and all other
persons that should or ought to account or pay any sum or sums of money in
any of her Majesty's Court of Exchequer, Courts of wards and Liueries, or of
her Duchy of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter into any account in any
of the same Courts, shall repair unto the accustomed places at Westminster,
where her highness has appointed such officers and ministers, as for that
purpose her Majesty has thought expedient, and there to pay and do in every
behalf, as though no such Proclamation of adiournement had been had or made.

And her highness further pleasure and commandment is, that all Sheriffs
shall return their wrytes and process, against all such accomptauntes and
debtors at the days therein appointed. And if any person or persons, who ought
to account or pay any sum or sums of money to her Majesty in any the
Courts and places aforesaid, do make default therein: that then her highness
wryttes and process shall be awarded and sent forth against every such person
and persons, and the same to be duly and orderlye served and returned by the
Sheriffs and officers thereunto appointed, in such like manner and form, as
the same should have been if this present Proclamation had not ben made. And if
any Sheriff or other Officer shall make defaulte, or be negligent in seruyng,
executyng, and returnyng of any the wryttes and process aforesaid: that then
every such Sheriff and other Officer shall incur such pains and penalties,
(...) by the said Courts or any of them shall be taxed and assessed: Willing
and commaundyng all and every of her Majesty's Sheriffs, officers, ministers,
and subjects, to whom it does or shall appertain, to observe and keep their
assemblies, and apparaunces, with all their Returns and Certificates in her
highness said Courts at Westminster in Mensis Michaelis next coming, then
and there to be holden and kept, and there to do their offices and duties in
every behalf, in like manner and form, as they should or ought to have done
if this present Proclamation had not ben had or made, as they will answer to
the contrary at their peryls.

Given at our manor of Reading, the xxiiii. day of September, in the twelth
year of her Majesty's reign. God save the Queen.
