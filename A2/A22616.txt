A Proclamation for calling in a Book, entitled, An Jntroduction to a Devout
life; and that the same be publicly burnt.
WHereas a Book, entitled, An Jntroduction to a Devout life, was lately
printed by Nicholas Oaks of London, and many of them published and dispersed
throughout the Realm, the Copy of which Book being brought to the Chaplain of
the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, for License and allowance, was by him, upon
diligent perusal, in sundry places expunged and purged of diverse passages
therein tending to Popery: Nevertheless the same Book, after it was so amended
and allowed to be printed, was corrupted and falsified by the Translator and
Stationer, who between them inserted again the same Popish and unsound
passages: And the Stationer is now apprehended, and the Translator sought for
to be proceeded against according to Justice.

His Majesty, out of His pious and constant care, to uphold and maintain the
Religion professed in the Church of England in its purity, without Error or
Corruption, Does therefore hereby declare His Royal Will and Pleasure to be,
and does straightly Charge and Command all persons, of what degree, quality, or
condition soever, to whose hands any of the said Books are, or shall come, that
without delay they deliver or send them to the Bishop, or Chancellor of the
Diocese, whom His Majesty requires to cause the same to be publicly burnt,
as such of them as have been already seized on, have been by His Majesty's
express Command: And to this His Majesty's Royal Pleasure, he requires all
His loving Subjects to yield all due Conformity and Obedience, as they will
avoid the censure of high Contempt.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the fourteenth day of May, in the thirteenth
year of Our Reign.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1637.
