To all and singular Mayors, Recorders, Customers, Comptrollers, Surueyors,
Searchers, all Farmers, Deputies of and within all and singular the Port
Towns, Ports, Havens, and Creekes, within this our Realm of England, and the
Dominion of Wales, now being, and that hereafter shall be. And to all and
singular our Justice of the peace, having or which shall have authority within
the said port Towns, Ports, Havens, and Creekes, and every and any of them,
for the time being, Greeting.
Whereas, our late dread and Royal Father, King James, of happy memory by his
Proclamation dated at Westminster, the ninth of July, in the fifth year of his
Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland, did straightly prohibit, and
forbid all manner of persons being natural borne Subjects of this our Realm,
or any of the Dominions of the same, of what estate or degree soever they were,
that they or any of them (other then such persons as were excepted, in and by
an act of Parliament made in the fifth year of the Reign of King Richard the
Second, in the said Proclamation mentioned, and other, then Soldiers,
Merchants, Marryners, and their Factors, and Apprentices should not at any time
thereafter, without special license of our said Father, or of any four or
more of his privy Council whereof his principal Secretary for the time being
to be one, pass or departed out of our Realm of England, or any the Dom^nions
of the same Into the Kingdoms, Countries, Territories, or Dominions of any
foreign King Prince of State or Potentate, upon corporal and their great and
heavy pains and penalties, as by the Laws of this our Realm, might be
inflicted upon such as shall offend therein, for their so heinous, and
unnatural offenses, against their natural Liege Lord, and Country, in that
behalf, As by the said Proclamation, amongst other things morefully and
plainly appears And our said Father, taking into his consideration, that
there were diverse persons, as well Women and Children under the age of one and
twenty years as others, besides the persons not restrained by his said
proclamation, whereof some had good and necessary occasions to pass beyond
the Seas, who nevertheless could not lawfully pass out of the same without
such License as in his said Proclamation was appointed in that behalf. In
which cases for every such of his said Subjects, to obtain License from our
said Father, or four of his Council whereof his principal Secretary to be
one, was very inconvenient. And that diverse of his Subjects being persons
unknown, and evil affected to the State of this Kingdom, did oftentimes
convey themselves out of this Realm, into the Ports beyond the Seas, and
combine themselves with f^raigne Enemies, thereby to make trouble, and
disturbance, to our said Father and his people, did by several Commissions
under his great Seal of England, give power and authority to the Chief
officers within the Ports of this Kingdom, to administer an Oath unto such
persons as should desire, to go over beyond the Seas, and to examine them, and
such as they shall find to go over, upon any good or lawful occasion to
allow and s^ffer to pass with diverse provisions therein. Nevertheless for the
restraint of such as should be suspected, or discovered to be persons,
dangerous or fit to be made instruments of desperate attemps, which Commissions
have taken good effect to the purpose to which they were intended. Know yet
therefore that we having well weighed the premises, and for the exp^dition of
such our Subjects, as shall have good and necessary occasion to pass into our
Realm of Ireland, or into any other place or places elsewhere beyond the Seas
And to quit and ease ourselves, and our Privy Council, of that continuell
suite and trouble, which thereby would happen unto us, and them to the
hinderance of other our weighty affairs, and also to prevent (as much as we
may) all danger that may happen to us, or our Estate in the cases aforesaid.
And reposing trust and confidence in your fidelities, w^sdomes, and
circumspections, having assigned and appointed, and by these presents do
assign and appoint you to be our Comissioners And we do hereby give unto
you, or any two or more of you, full power and authority within the several
Jurisdictions, Ports, Creekes and Places respectively, where you and every of

being of convenient age to take an Oath, as other Person and Persons, other
then the persons not restrained as aforesaid, as shall offer or d^si^e to go
over the Seas, to our said Realm of Ireland, or into any other place or places
elsewhere beyond the Seas, at any of the said Ports, Havens or Creekes,
respectively as aforesaid (except before excepted) to answer truly to such
questions, as you or any two or more of you shall ask of them. And upon such

their birth and abode, their state, degree, vocation, trade, mystery or
occupation, and the true cause or causes of their going over, toge^^er with the
place or places, whether they intend or are to go, and the time that they
intend, and are lik^ to stay and tarry before they return, all other questions
that your discretions, accordin^ to the o^^asio^s ^ou shall think fit All

Book, by such Clarke or Clerks, as we have nominated and appointed, or shall
nomina^e and appoi^te thereunto under our great Seal of England or his or

we do also by these presents give full power and aut^oritie unto yo^ or any
