JAMES By the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deanes, and their
Officials, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all spiritual persons. And also to
all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, Churchwardens
and Headboroughes: And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughes, and Towns
corporate: And to all other our Officers, Ministers and Subjects whatsoever
they be, as well within Liberties, as without, to whom these presents shall
come, greeting:
WHEREAS by our Letters Patents bearing date the seven and Twentieth day of
March, in the Sixteenth year of our Reign of England, etc. upon a Certificate
under the hands of our trusty and well-beloved Subjects Sir Edmond Bowyer, Sir
Nicholas Carew, Sir Thomas Grimes, Sir Thomas Muschampe, Sir Francis Clarke,
Sir George Paul, and Sir John Howland Knights, Justices of the Peace within
our County of Surrey, we did give and grant unto our poor distressed Subject
Abraham Lambart of Woodside us the Parish of Croydon in our foresaid County,
full power, license and Authority, to ask, gather, receive and take the Alms
and charitable benevolence of all our loving Sobiects within our County of
Surrey and certain other Counties, for and in respect of his great losses
sustained by Fire amounting to the value of Three hundred pounds, to the utter
undoing of our said poor Subject, his Wife and six small Children, which
Letters Patents are now determined and out of Date. Now forasmuch as it has
since appeared unto us by the humble supplication and petition of our said
poor Subject Abraham Lambart being also confirmed by Affidauit, that our said
poor Subject by reason of the hurt and lamenesse which happened unto him by
the said Fire, whereby be could not travel himself about his Collection, as
also by the negligence and deceit of such as he put in trust he received
little benefit by the said collection (as we graciously intended he should)
whereby he is fallen into greater misery then before, being impotent and not
able to labor for his living, nor to sustain his charge of Wife and Children,
and also much indebted and behind hand, and in daily danger of imprisonment, in
consideration whereof he has most humbly besought us that we would be further
pleased to renew our said Letters Patents for some other places, for him to
seek some relief to preserve him and his from perishing, whose miserable and
poor estate we much pity* and have thought good to commend the same unto the
charitable consideration of all our loving and weldisposed Subjects within
certain Counties hereafter mentioned, not doubting but that all good
Christians well weighing the uncertainty of man's estate through these
inevitable accidents, will be ready and willing as feeling members one of
another misery, to extend their charitable contributions toward the relief
and Comfort of their distressed brother in this his great necessity, none
knowing how soon nor whose chance may next happen into the like Calamity.

KNOW ye therefore, that of Our especial Grace and Princely compassion, We
have given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents do give and grant,
unto our said poor Subject Abraham Lambart, and to his Deputy and Deputies,
the bearers or bearers hereof, full power, license, and Authority, to ask,
gather, receive and take the Alms and charitable benevolence of all our loving
Subjects whatsoever, Inhabiting within our Counties of Oxford, Buckingham,
Hartford, Essex, Cambridge, Lincoln, Northampton, and Warwick, with our City
and University of Oxford, and in our Cities of Lincoln, Peterborough and
Couentrey, with our University of Cambridge, and Isle of Ely, And in all other
Cities, Towns Corporate, Privileged places, Parishes, Villages, and in all
other places whatsoever within our said Counties and not else where, for and
toward the speedy relief and maintenance of our said po0re Subject his Wife
and Children.

WHEREFORE We will and Command you and every of you, that at such time and
times as the said Abraham Lambart, or his Deputy or Deputies, the bearer or
bearers hereof, shall come and repair to any your Churches, Chapels, or other
places, to ask and receive the gratuities and charitable benenolence of our
said Subjects, quietly to permit and suffer them so to do, without any manner
your lets or contradictions. And you the said Parsons, Vicars, and Curats, for
the better stirring up of a charitable devotion, deliberately to publish and
declare the Tenor of these our Letters Patents unto our said Subjects upon some
Sabbath day, when as the same shall be tendered unto you. Exhorting and
persuading them to extend their liberal contributions in so good and
charitable a deed. And you the Churchwardens of every Parish, where such
Collection is to be made (as aforesaid) to Collect and gather the Alms and
charitable benevolence of all our loving Subjects, as well Strangers as others,
And what shall be by you so gathered, to deliver it to the bearer or bearers of
these our Letters Patents, and to no other person, when as thereunto you shall
be required. And lastly, whereas we are informed of the great abuse which is
now crept in amongst these poor people, who sell their Lycences unto some
other person, whereby men's charity goes not the right way but unto such as
deserve it least. That from henceforth our will and pleasure is, that if it may
appear unto (...) or any of you that the said Abraham Lambart has contracted
any bargain, or made or shall make sale of these our Letters Patents, whereby
the benefit should pass from him to any other person, That thereupon these our
Letters Patents shall be void and of none effect. Any Statute, Law, Ordinance,
or Provision heretofore made to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

IN witness whereof, We have caused these our Letters to be made Patents for
the space of One whole year next after the date hereof to endure.

Witness our self at Westminster, the nineteenth day of January, in the
Eighteenth year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland: And of Scotland
they four and Fiftieth. 1620. Steward.
