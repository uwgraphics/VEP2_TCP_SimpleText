ONE BLOW AT BABEL In those of the PEPOLE CALLED BEHMENITES. Whose Foundation
is not upon that of the Prophets and Apostles, which shall stand sure and firm
for ever; but upon their own Carnal Conceptions, begotten in their Imaginations
upon Jacob Behmen's Writings, etc. They not knowing the better part, the
Teachings of that Spirit that sometimes opened some Mysteries of God's Kingdom
in Jacob, have chosen the worser part with Esau, according to the predominancy
of that Spirit which ruled in them when they made choice of their Religion, as
it does in other the hearts of the Children of disobedience. By JOHN ANDERDON.

LONDON, Printed in the year 1662.

One blow at Babel, in those of the People called Behminites, whose Foundation
is not upon that of the Prophets and Apostles, which shall stand sure and firm
for ever, etc.
KNow ye not, that the stone cut out of the Mountains without hands, is laid to
the foot of all the Images set up in all the earth? Before whom Dagon shall
fall, and Bell shall be confounded, and all the gods of the Heathen shall be
dashed in pieces, and none shall stand though never so excellent and glorious in
the sight of men, for God has determined, that the Image of his Son Christ
Jesus the Light of the world, the fairest of ten thousands (though hitherto
more marred than any man's) shall be set up, made manifest and brought forth in
this the day of God 's power, by the operation of his Eternal Spirit in the
hearts of men, which changes them into the likeness of his glorious Body,
prepared to do the will of God, and brings forth fruit to the praise and
glory of his Grace for ever. And whither wander you in your imaginations,
inventing and setting up strange gods in your minds, according to your own
hearts lusts, and fall down and worship the works of your own hands, the Image
that ye have set up, that can neither go nor speak, but are altogether dead,
and without life, being formed out of the dust of the earth, with your Mediums
and borrowed instruments, not according to the lively pattern and workmanship
of God in Christ Jesus the hope of glory, but according to your carnal
inventions, the Masterpiece of your Form and Image that ye have created to
your selves, grounded upon some mis-understood expressions, or imaginary
conceptions of Jacob Behmen's writings, the tendencie of whose spirit ye can
never fathom, nor see rightly to judge of, until ye come to the Light (that
thing so despicable in your eyes also) which gives the true understanding of
the things of God, and through Judgment brings men to sound and pure reason,
and discretion to judge and discern between the operation of spirits, and shows
what is imaginary, and what is true; which lets us see and fathom the ground
and bottom of your errors and delusions, and from whence your rise is, and what
your end is, though you may propose great things to your selves, as if ye were
a people more exce^lent then others, because there sometime appeared an
excellent spirit in Jacob Behmen in some things, and ye are of his Judgment:
But alas! alas! the Conclusions that you have drawn to your selves from his
Writings, will not profit you; neither does it make you any jot the more
excellent, that ye can talk much of him, and his Books and Writings, being not
come to the right Spirit in which is life, which brings men out of dead forms,
and vain imaginations, and by its immediate teachings and power leads them up
to God, and teaches them how to worship in spirit and truth. What advantage
would it be to us if we were able to speak with the tongue of men and Angels,
if we through the strength of memory were able to dispute and talk of all the
lives of the holy men of God, and say that we are of such a man 's judgment,
and knew not that unerring, infallible Spirit of God to lead us thereto? What
is all else that is done by way of imitation of others, but traditional, and
such knowledge as puffs up, and makes men Pharisaical, as if they knew much,
when in truth they know nothing yet as they ought to know; and such a people
may pay tithe of Cummin and Anniseed, be strict and zealous in formalities, and
neglect Judgment, Righteousness and Mercy, the weightier matters of the Law.
And friends, this I must tell you, That until ye have felt and known the Spirit
of Judgment and Burning to pass upon you as Fullers Soap, and as a Refiners
fire, to cleanse your earthen Vessels, ye are not fit for the Lord's use,
neither do you serve him in your Ordinances (as you call them) with acceptance,
but toil and labor in your vain minds to bring forth nothing but abominations:
It Is no better, whatever your conceits are yea, and your ways are as grievous
and burdensome to the Lord's Spirit, as the way of profaneness, for
Hypocrisy is a most hateful thing unto the Lord, and to profess Religion by
way of tradition, without the Spirit of Life to lead and guide men therein, is
no better than to Sacrifice Swines blood, and the cutting off a Dogs neck in
this the Day of the Lord. Therefore deceive not your own souls by your
imaginary righteousness, and self-separation, which exceeds not that of the
Scribes and Pharisees, which enter not God's Kingdom, but will be shut out as
an unclean and unholy thing, amongst the dogs that are without the Gate of that
City wherein dwells that righteousness which God has chosen and appointed,
and is wrought by his own Eternal Spirit: But the ground of your Image is from
that root which is evil, of the Enemies planting, and can never bring forth
fruit unto God. There is a right seed sown by God in the hearts of men, but
some falls on the highways side, and Satan immediately comes and catches
away the Word out of their hearts, and so becomes their Head, and leads them
to do that which is evil, yet many times under a pretense of Religion,
Righteousness, and Zeal for God: And here the Devil works in a Mystery.

And thus friends, I may deal plainly with you, there was sometime in you (I
believe) a hungering and thirsting after righteousness, and from that desire,
as not knowing the way to attain thereunto, you separated, and searched holy
Writings, as ye judged, to find out this way, and not keeping to the Light in
your own Consciences, down to that which begat the desire, which also shows the
way, (and ye should have taken heed unto it, as to a Light shining in a dark
place, until the day had dawned and the day star had arisen in your hearts,
which would have given you the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of
Jesus Christ) ye wandered in your imaginations to find out this way without a
Guide, and so erred and went astray from that which would have manifested the
way to you, and in you, and laid hold on that which seemed most suitable to
your judgments and understandings, which were darkened; and by how much the more
zealous and real ye were in your intentions, by so much the more firmlie ye
stand united and joined to that way which in your ignorance ye have chosen,
and it may be somewhat the more fastened to it, because it may challenge a
prioritie of images set up in these latter days wherein the Mystery of
Iniquity has wrought under so many diverse color, and forms of Heavens and
Heavenly things. And do ye think that when ye made choice of this your
Religion which ye now hold, that the Spirit of this world, the Prince of the
power of the air, had not the greatest interest and overruling power in you?
Or were ye come to know the voice of the true Shepherd in you, from the voice
of that false prophet which sat in God's Judgment Seat in your hearts, and
perverts the right ways of the Lord; if ye are not through God's righteous
Judgments upon the Prince of this World in you, come to discern and know the
true voice of God's Eternal Spirit, from the Spirit of Error and Delusion in
you, which presents it self (when God's work is to be done) to draw the mind
after it, to follow after shadows instead of substance; how can ye have
confidence that ye are in the right way, and are not deluded and drawn away
with the error of the wicked? And being built upon that foundation, the more
abominable your profession is, it being a branch also of Mystery Babylon the
Mother of Harlots, who sometimes appears in the dress of the true and chaste
Spouse, but all to this very end, to hide her Hypocrisy and Deceit, the
filthiness of her hearts Fornications and Whoredoms.

And what is all the talk and profession of Religion in the world without the
present teachings and motion of God's Spirit, but dead works, and the covering
of Antichrist? And all your talking of God's Kingdom, of Salvation and
Redemption by the Blood of Christ, while sin and iniquity lodges in your
hearts, is no better than to account the blood of Christ an unholy thing to
cover the Serpent's Head in you: And the Devil can say, that Christ is the Son
of God, and this hurts not his Kingdom; but when the Ax comes to be laid to the
root of that tree in man which brings forth evil fruit, then all the world is
an uproar, and the Devil rages against this Work with all his strength and
subtilties, for this strikes at the root of his Kingdom; and whosoever knows
the destruction thereof in them by the power of God, which is Christ Jesus the
Light of the world, they must know many sore combats and bitter conflicts, and
the righteous judgments of the Lord God must be poured out upon the man of sin
in them; that through the Cross of Christ, the power of God, man may be made
willing to forsake the Devil and all his works, and so being brought from under
Satan's power into the power of God, they may come to know that Seed raised in
them which brings forth fruit unto God, it being that which redeems out of
the fall, from under the curse, and is blessed for evermore.

Verily Friends, the work of Regeneration is not an easy work to flesh and
blood, but is to be known through much sore travel of soul, yea such pains and
pangs does truly accompany that Birth, as the pangs of a woman in travel; and
this is not a notional thing only, but truly and really to be felt in the
creature, and through death life is to be known: Therefore deceive not your
selves to think that ye are the people of the Lord, and in a good state and
condition, when it is otherwise with you; think not I say that ye are come to
the substance, but are catching after shadows which will not profit your souls.
And this is my testimony to you from the Lord, That ye are not in the truth of
God, but out of the way of his salvation, yea in that which grieves his Spirit,
under Death's power ye are, what images or likenesses soever ye frame to your
selves, and bring forth, and what services soever ye perform, and not from the
present teachings of God's Spirit, are but abomination in the sight of the
Lord. And the more ye do struggle and strive in your unregenerate nature, and
utter words without knowledge, the more are your understandings darkened, and
alienated from the life of God, and the Commonwealth of Israel, and are
enemies to God in your minds by reason of wicked works, and the spirit of
bondage is over you, which crucifies the just. Therefore repent and return from
the evil of your ways, that you may be redeemed from the vanity of your minds,
and know a change wrought in your hearts by the Word of God, which is quick and
powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing
asunder between the soul and the spirit, the joints and the marrow, and is a
discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, which Word lives and
abides for ever.

And think not I say, that your imaginations from Jacob Behmen's Writings about
baptizing of Infants, have any more authority or ground from the Scriptures of
truth given forth by the Spirit of God, neither is it of more advantage to you,
than the Crosses set up by Papists in the Highways, and on the top of
Steeple Houses, are to destroy sin, and save your souls, which were set up in
the days of Apostacy from the truth; for here is the rise and ground of
Images, when men went from the truth of God within, then the Devil which draws
the mind into visible things of this world where he works) persuades them to
set up some likenesses without, which may please the carnal and sensual part,
to feed that Birth which is of the flesh, and stands at enmity against God, and
so in the apostacy, when people forsook the Cross of Christ the power of God,
that destroys sin in the flesh, then instead of that, up comes all sorts of
Crosses without, and so the like of other pictures and images set up and
worshipped by men of corrupt minds; and instead of the new birth spoken of in
the Scriptures, which is of Water and the Spirit, without which none can be
saved, which is irksome and grievous to such as are grown old in sin and
iniquity; therefore a more easy invention is found out, to make children
Christians by sprinkling a little water upon them, before they know the right
hand from the left; and so under the Name of Christians, live in the
abomination of Heathens all the days of their lives, which profits them so
much as the talking of God's salvation does profit him that lives in sin and
iniquity, which is only so much as for a man to have a name that he lives,
while he is dead.

And as for your Mediums that you work by, they are little less then new
Saviors which ye have begotten in your carnal imaginations and reasonings
about the things of God, not knowing him who is the way, the truth and the
life, who is that Bread which came down from God out of Heaven, upon which he
that is born of God feeds, and is nourished up unto eternal life; but that
which is born of the flesh, savours the things of the flesh, and feeds upon
that which must die and come to an end, and comes not to know the body and
blood of Christ to be meat and drink indeed; and except ye eat his flesh and
drink his blood, ye have not life in you: But this is too hard a saying it may
be, for you who have sed so long on Husks, upon that food which perishes, that
ye cannot relish that food which lives and abides for ever: And have you that
life in you, or else ye are dead in sins and trespasses: And is that Fountain
of water opened in you, that springs up unto everlasting life? Or else ye are
dry and barren, and without fruits unto God. And do ye eat his flesh? and do
ye drink his blood? and are ye lead by his spirit? Or else ye are none of his.
And where then is the Man Christ, the Body prepared to do the will of God? Or
else you are using your Mediums as dead works, to attain this new and living
way, and so seek the living amongst the dead, to get qualifications into your
souls, as Simon Magus would give money for the gift of the Holy Ghost, a
corrupt price for a heavenly purchase. And is the Body and Blood of Christ
too hard for you, and unsuitable to that birth which ye are of, and therefore
is most agreeable to that ye feed upon, Bread and Wine, and plead for Bread and
Wine as those that know no better food, but that which feeds that birth which
is after the flesh, and must die, and lives upon shadows after the substance is
come? And what birth do you feed with your bread and wine, is it not that which
lusts, and ought not to be satisfied? For that birth which is of God, hungers
and thirsts after the living presence of the Lord, and is therewith only
satisfied. Therefore try and examine well this matter, whether ye are in the
Faith of God, and elect in that nature which pleases God, or else your eating
and drinking, and sacrificing, is no better than the plowing of the wicked,
which is sin.

And as for your Mediums and working-Instruments that ye use as necessary for
the conveyance of God 's Grace and virtue into your souls, introduced by way
of example from the Miracles done by Moses and the old Prophets, by Christ and
the Apostles, by outward means, ye being not in the same power of God by which
the noble acts of the Lord were done: In you it tends to no other end but to
set or keep up somewhat of men 's inventions above the present teachings and
power of God, which is the beginning of false worships, and leads to set up the
Creature above the Creator, and to exalt that birth which is after the flesh,
above that which is of the Spirit; for whence comes all the worshipping of
Saints, and the Heavenly Host (as they call it) amongst the Church of Rome, as
the means and way to get into God's favor, but from him who first taught
people to worship strange gods, and to set up the traditions of men above the
Commands of Jesus Christ, who says, Come unto me all ye that are weary and
heavy laden, and I will refresh you; he who faith, I am the way, the truth and
the life, appointed of God unto salvation; and there is not another Name under
Heaven whereby men can be saved. But in days of old there was a people that
disigently searched the Scriptures which testified of him, and thought therein
to find life, but would not come unto him who has the words of eternal life,
that they might receive life from him; but would have it in their own way from
the Scriptures as their Mediums: And what is the end of all their seize,
but only this, they grew wise to do evil, and crucified the Lord of life.

And what can ye with all your Mediums do, as to the destroying of sin, and
saving your souls, more than the sons of Sceva, the Vagabond Jews, the
Exorcists could do to cast out Devils by way of imitation, in the name of that
Jesus whom Paul preached, whom they knew not to be the power of God unto
salvation to every one that believes; and there is not another Mediator between
God and Man, but Christ Jesus the Light of the world, unto whom ye must all
come, as to that Original Fountain of Life from whence all good does flow; and
wait to know his voice in you, which will teach you the way of God more
perfectly, and not to boast of other men's lines, but to come down out of all
your imaginations, in the silence of flesh to wait to hear his voice, who is
able to instruct you in the way of life, and teach you to do the will of God in
earth as it is in Heaven; and whatever ye do without him, it is no better than
Cain's Sacrifice, which finds not acceptance with God: And all your treasuring
up of wisdom and knowledge in your unregenerate nature, which is not from the
present teachings of God 's Spirit, (who knows what is fit for you will profit
you no more than the Israelites gathering of Manna beyond God 's command, did
profit them, and it is no better than the treasuring up of wrath against the
day of wrath and revelation of God 's just Judgments upon all ungodly men, who
hold the truth in unrighteousness. Therefore come down to him who is meek and
lowly in the heart, unto the appearance of Christ Jesus in you, who is come a
Light into the world, and follow him who reproves the world of sin, that by it
ye may be lead into all truth. And know assuredly, that until ye come to the
Light, to walk in the Light, ye are not the children of God, but abide in
darkness, and the Prince of this world rules in your hearts, as in other the
children of disobedience. And let not the shame of the Cross affright you also
from the Crown of the Kingdom, which comes not by observation, but is within
you; and the Word nigh, in the heart and in the mouth, which discovers to man
his thoughts, will only show you the way; and unless ye come to know Christ in
you the hope of glory, all other hopes are but as the hope of the hypocrite,
that shall perish.

And as to the necessity that ye seem to place in your Mediums of Water, Bread
and Wine, as if a man could not be saved without them, by way of Query
something farther proposed.

1. Whether ye own Transubstantiation, and judge it to be the body and blood of
Christ, which cleanses from all sin, and so set up the Creature above the
Creator?

2. Or whether ye use them as signs and figures of good things to come, as not
knowing him come who is the Substance?

3. Or whether ye use them as helps to salvation, accounting the blood of
Christ the Light of the world, insufficient to destroy sin, and to save your
souls?

4. Or whether ye have notset up an imagination in your minds about the way of
God's Salvation, and resolve to have salvation in your own way, and to oppose
that which is contrary to it, as men do that know not the present teachings of
Gods Spirit?

5. Or whether do you think that Christ has left the work of God's salvation
to any Creature, and is not the same yesterday, to day and for ever, the alone
Savior of the world?

6. Or whether the Mystery of Gods Kingdom be hid from you, and so its beyond
your Capacities, and therefore with them that perish, you will feed upon mortals,
upon that which must dye, and reject him who is the Word of God, that lives
and abides for ever, that Bread which came down from God out of Heaven, Christ
Jesus the Light of the World, the only way to the Father?

Try and examine well these things, and let the witness of God in your own
consciences be answered in every particular, that so you may no longer live
under Death's power, but repent and be converted unto the power of God, which
is only able to destroy sin, and save your souls, as witnessed by

your Friend in truth, John Anderdon.
