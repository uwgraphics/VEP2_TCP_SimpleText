A Proclamation prohibiting the Exportation of Corn and Grain.
WHereas We have taken into Our Princely consideration, that, by reason of the
late unseasonable weather, the hopefulnesse of the next ensuing Harvest is much
endangered, by which, and by the former exportations the Stores of Corn for
the provision of this Kingdom will be much shortened, and the prices may in
all probability be much enhanced; And forasmuch as we are informed, that the
scarcity of Corn and Grain in the neighboring Kingdoms and parts, from
whence Our Dominions in times of dearth or scarcity, have formerly been
furnished, is such, as little hope of relief is to be expected from them: We
therefore, desiring, as much as in us lies, by Our timely providence, to take
care for the prevention of the many inconveniences, which otherwise may ensue,
have thought fit by the advice of the Lords, and others of Our Privy Counsel,
to declare and publish Our Royal will and pleasure therein.

And We do hereby straightly charge, prohibit, and command, that no person or
persons whatsoever, shall from henceforth attempt, presume, or go about to
transport, export, or send away, any Corn or Grain whatsoever, out of this
Our Realm of England, or from any the Ports, Havens or Creekes of the same,
into any the parts beyond the Sea, until Our Royal pleasure be further
declared to the contrary, although the prices of such Corn or grain shall
fall out to be under the rate limited by the Statute for Transportation of
Corn and Grain in that behalf; Any former License, or other command
whatsoever to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

And for the better execution of Our pleasure herein, We do hereby will and
command, as well all Mayors, Justices of Peace, and other Ministers, as all the
Officers and Farmers of Our Customs within this Our Realm of England, to take
notice of this Our Royal Command, and to see the same duly observed, as they
tender Our pleasure, and will anoyd Our indignation and displeasure for the
contrary.

Given at Our Court at Greenwich, the second day of May, in the fifth year of
Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty.
