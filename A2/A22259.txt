A Proclamation for restraint of the transportation of Corn.
THE Kings most Excellent Majesty, taking into his gracious and princely
consideration, that by reason of the cold and unseasonable weather, which has
been of late, specially this summer time, the fruits of the earth, and chiefly
corn and grain, are not either for plenty or goodness answerable to former
years, and that the price thereof is already much raised in many parts of this
Realm, and that in former years there has been a free transportation
thereof without restraint (his Highness inclining thereto, for the comfort and
encouragement of the Farmor in those times of plenty) so as neither the
increase of the present year, nor the old store remaining, can afford that
liberty of exporting, without danger of dearth and scarcity speedily to ensue:
And therefore his Majesty prudently foreseeing so general an inconvenience,
and desiring timely to prevent and eschew the same, Has upon mature
deliberation and aduisement, found it expedient, to make stay of all
transportation of corn and grain, until upon consideration of the store and
increase thereof in all parts of this Realm, His Highness may receive more
assured and certain hope that there will be sufficient for the sustentation of
this kingdom and country, with an overplus fit to be carried into foreign
parts. And therefore his Majesty does hereby expressly prohibit and forbid all
manner of persons whatsoever, That they, or any of them, do not from
henceforth, until his Majesty's pleasurr shall be declared to the contrary,
by any ways or means, directly or indirectly attempt or presume to carry,
convey or transport, or cause to be carried, conveyed or transported, nor do
ship or lade, or cause to be shipped or laded to the intent to be carried,
conveyed, or transported out of this Realm of England, or the Dominions of
Wales, or either of them, or out of any port, haven, treeke, or place of lading
or vnlading within them, or either of them, Any corn or grain of what kind or
sort soever, upon pain of his highness heavy indignation and displeasure,
and such pains and penalties as may be inflicted upon the contemners of his
Royal commandment. And likewise his Majesty does by these presents straightly
charge and command all Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Surueyors, and other
Officers of all and singular ports, havens, and other places of lading, that
they do not only forbear to permit or suffer any entries to be made, or to
give any warrant for transportation of any corn or grain into any the parts
beyond the seas, but also to be watchful to prevent all sleights, practices,
and devices that shall or may be practiced, attempted, or put in ure, to the
defrauding of the due performance of this his Majesty's Proclamation, as they
and every of them will answer the contrary at their perils.

Given at Our Court of Theobalds, the sixteenth day of September, in the
nineteenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
