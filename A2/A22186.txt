royal blazon or coat of arms
WHEREAS THE KINGS most Excellent Majesty has taken knowledge that Hard-waxe
being useful and delightful among his subjects, is become more frequent in
these His Kingdoms then heretofore, and that it is for most part privately
imported from foreign places beyond the seaes, without custom or benifite to
His Majesty, and some time with much deceit to the subject thereby, and that
some small quantity thereof by two or three unskillful persons only, has been
of late time made in this His Kingdom. So as the Forrayner, or one or two
strangers, make use hereof, whereby it is sold at a dearer rate to the
subjects, then otherwise it may, be if it were made and used as known
manufacture in this kingdom, by persons brought up and taught therein, as in
other sciences and Trades, which are necessary for setting people to work, and
for breeding Commerce, which is the aim of the civil Countries and for supply
of themselves if possible as well as other kingdoms, in like manner with all
necessary and useful things by their own industrey, as good and better cheap
then from forrayne countries, as for most part it is, which his Majesty
gracitiouslly intending and always tendering and affecting the good of His
Subjects, and having taken knowledge, upon due consideration and examination
hereof by His Counsel learned, and finding the making of Hard-waxe, not to be
of any particular Company, Trade or Science now used or established, nor
hurtful but useful to his subjects in general, to erect a Manufacture
thereof being a matter of delight and conveniencie rather then of necessity, so
as for reteyning the same in a moderate price and rate, least the forraynnet
from whence it is brought, finding it more useful here, shall inhaunce the
price thereof, if it shall come only from him, and it being under taken by his
Pattentes, or his Deputies or Assigns, to be as well or better made here, and
that his kingdoms shall be sufficiently scerued. Has thought fit, for there and
like considerations by His Highness Letters Pattents under his great Seal of
England, dated the Third of February last past, to grant and declare that it
shall become and be made a manufacture within this Kingdom, by sussicient
workmen well skilled therein, that hereafter servants or apprentice under
them, being taught and practiced in that Art, may come the true knowledge
thereof, and from tune to time, be set on work therein, as the use thereof
shall increase, and thereby these his Kingdoms the better cheap served and
furnished. To which end, His Majesty has also in and by his said letters
Pattents, among other thungs declared and signified His express will and
pleasure to be, that no Hard-wax hereafter shall be imported into these his
kingdoms by Merchants or others, Aiiens or naturals, under the penalty of
Forfeiture and seizing thereof, and undergoing the laws and penalties to be
incurred, for contempt of his royal pleasure herein and also that no man
within this his Kingdom otherwise then the Pattenties their Deputies or
Assigns under like penalties and under pain of incuring his heavy
displeasure and sensure by the Laws for disobeying thereof shall presume to
make and utter or cause to be made and uttered any Hard-waxe so privately made
but such as shall be made or allowed by the Pattenties his Deputies and
assigns. And that it shall be lawefull for the Pattentee and his Assigns from
time to time for distinction of their Wax by them made from others so privately
made or imported, to impose any mark or marks, and to seiz and take that which
shall not be so marked. Giving hereby further notice, that all Shopkeepers,
who have usually or shall usually sell the same, shall be served by the pound or
weight, with as good and better Wax, without want and better cheap, then for
the most part the like is, or has been sold heretofore, whereof all those
shopkeepers whom this may concern, shall have further knowledge by a
declaration in Print whether to repair for the same, to be furnished, by or
before the (...) day of (...) next coming, and in the mean time, These
presents shall be sufficient to give knowledge of His Majesty's pleasure herein,
to all whom this shall concern, whereof it they doubt, they may repair to the
house of Sir Henry Breton Knight, in Drurie Lane. to see His Majesty's letters
Pattents to this purpose, if they desire to be further satisfied herein.
