HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE
royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
A Proclamation containing his Majesty's Royal pleasure, concerning the
project of Dying and Dressing of Broad Clothes within the Kingdom, before
they be exported.
IT was the work of one of Our noble Progenitors King Edward the third, to
convert the Woolls of this Kingdom formerly vented raw, into Cloth, thereby
to purchase unto Our loving Subjects the profit, arising as well upon the
Manufacture, as upon the Material, and to set Our own people on work for
their better sustentation and comfort; And it is likewise Our desire, That it
should be the work of Our times, to ordain and provide, that all Broad
Clothes may be Died and Dressed within Our Kingdom before they be Exported;
whereby as well the second gain of Manufacture, as the first, with all the
incidents thereof, may come wholly to the benefit of Our loving Subjects, in
whose riches and good estate We shall always think Ourselves rich and happy.
Neither is the increase of profit upon this great Staple commodity only in
Our Princely eye and cogitation; But We foresee likewise, that when Our
Clothes shall be Transported and dispersed by Our Subjects immediately into all
the Markets of the world, where they are worn and used, it must increase
exceedingly Our Navigations and Navy, so that not only wealth, but honor,
strength and industry will evidently follow upon that which We propound to Our
selves; That as the Kings Our Progenitors, have had the wisdom and Judgment
to see and discern the good that might come thereof; So nevertheless, either
through difficulty or misinformation, they have not perfected, nor thoroughly
pursued the work intended, as may appear by the good and politic Laws that
have been Enacted concerning the same on the one part, and the ancient and
Inueterate Toleration and Dispensation with the said Laws, which have been
from time to time put in ure on the other part: We therefore being desirous to
advance and perfect so excellent a work, have resolved to leave no means
unperformed, either by advise of Parliament or otherwise of Our selves, which
may conduce thereunto, by those safe degrees which in so great a work are
requisite; Wherein though We find no small difficulties, as it uses to come
to pass in the best works, specially in their beginnings, yet We doubt not
but to overcome the same without hazard or inconvenience unto the present, for
hope or desire of the future.

And because opinion is sometime more harmefull then truth, and that it may
be doubted by some, that there may ensue some stand of Clothes, whereby so
many families of Our loving Subjects are maintained, or at least, some fall of
Prices, to the prejudice, both of the Cloathier, and owner of Woolles in the
mean time, between the diuerting of the old course, and settling of the new:
We do therefore publish unto all Our loving Subjects, by these presents, that
they shall not need to fear any such consequence, either in such stand of
Cloth, or abatement of Prices, as may be to their prejudice. And therefore,
they may (...) on in the courses of their former Trading, leaving it to Our
care and providence to int^^^uce this great and happy alteration to the better,
without any interruption of Trade, or pulling down of Price in the mean time.
Furthermore although we are settled in Our resolution to effect this work, yet
would We not have it construed that We have any other opinion of the Company
of Merchants Adventurers, which have long managed the Trade of Clothes
undressed, then as of those that have well deserved of Our state; neither of any
Our neighbors, who have had correspondencie with them, and bought the Cloth
from them to serve the Markets abroad, then as of men, that were affected unto
the good of their own people, as it is natural for men to be. Neither are We
ignorant that the state of Clothing is at this time as flourishing and
valuable as has been known; but only We are willing to advance the Dowry
and Stock of Our Kingdom: And where We see apparent means of doing Our
people further good, not to tie Our selves to the simple and positive degree of
their welfare, but to proceed from good to better, and to make posterity
beholding to Our times, for going through with that, whereof Our Ancestors
have only sown the seeds, and not hitherto reaped the fruits.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the five and twentieth day of May in the
twelfth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save
the King.

Majesty. Anno Dom. 1614.
