By the Queen. The Queens Majesty's proclamation, declaring her Princely
intention to inhibit her subjects upon most extreme pains, from offending on
the Seas: any persons in their ships or goods, being the subjects of any
Prince, Potentate, or State, in amity with her Majesty.
THe Queens Majesty understanding of some general complaints made against
certain of her subjects, that have been this last Summer on the Spanish seas,
to recover of the Spaniards recompense for the notable injuries by arrests and
barbarous cruelties committed in Spain and Portingall, against a great number
of her subjects, (whereof no remedy could ever be had by order of justice) as
that they in seeking to recover the proper goods of the Spaniards, should there
with or by color thereof, take the ships and goods of diverse subjects of other
Princes and States being in amity with her Majesty: Thereupon her Highness,
as before time she had always done, commanded not only her Council, but
namely such principal officers, as by their office had charge of her Ports,
and her high Admiral, and the officers of all marine causes, to cause the
truth of these general complaints to be heard and examined: And if they were
found true, to see both restitution and full recompense to be made to her
friends subjects dam^^^^ed, and the offenders to be punished as far forth as
the nature of their offense might deserve. And since that her Majesty's former
commandment given, and due restitution made to as many as could be found
justly grieved, though a great number of the complainants were found to have
had no just cause of their complaints, for that colourably many taking upon
them without warrant to be common factors, pretended title to the goods that
were proved merely Spaniards: her Majesty did lately understand, that one
ship, belonging to the Uenetians, and one other ship, claimed to belong to some
of the subjects of the grand duke of Tuscane, with which Seignorie and Duke her
Majesty professes to be in perfect good amity, and does repute them as her
most loving friends, should be taken on the seas, upon the coast of Portingal,
and brought into some of her Ports, in the West part of her realm. Thereupon
her Majesty being inwardly moved in affection of her amity to those States,
gave order to have these latter causes not only speedily to be examined, and
redressed, if the same were true, but also did give commandment, before
examination could be had, in respect the parties complaining had not then any
good proofs of the property of the goods, to have the said vessels preserved
with all their goods and ladings: for which purpose there was choice made of
such commissioners nere the Ports as the complainants did name, whereby may
appear to the world, but specially to the Seignory of Uenice, and the grand
Duke of Tuscan, what regard was had by her Majesty to show all favors to
their subjects.

And for further proof of her Majesty's honorable and friendly meaning in this
case, and of the diligence used by her Council for the execution of her
commandment, it is certain that the ship of Uenice with her lading is in
safety. So as whatsoever can any wise be proved to belong to the Uenetians, is
speedily and without charge to be delivered: and the other ship clamed by the
Florentines, though in very truth the same is known to be English, and lately
taken by Spaniards, is also in safety to be delivered to the Owners, as by the
law shall be judged, and the goods also, as far forth as they be extant: and
such as were before the complaint made, taken away, are either to be recovered,
or recompense to be made by any that have therein offended, contrary to
special order provided upon bonds, that no person licenced to go to the seas,
should at his return with any prise, break any bulk, before the title to the
goods were first examined in the Court of the Admiralty, and proved to belong
to the Spaniard. And for that purpose her Majesty has straightly charged, that
the offenders in dispersing any of the said goods of the Florentines, shall be
apprehended, severely punished, and compelled to make full restitution to the
Owners. And so her Majesty now commands, that whosoever shall hereafter
break any bulk of the goods of any prise, (though the prise be lawful)
before the title thereto be allowed in the Court of the Admiraltie, such
offendour shall be imprisoned, and his ship with the prise also to be forfeited
to her Majesty, whereby justice may be done to all persons that have just cause
of complaint. And like wise her Majesty declares her intention to be, and so
commands it to be executed, that if any person whatsoever, shall upon the
seas take any ships that do belong to any subjects of her friends and allies
(with whom she is in amity) and after knowledge had that the said ships do
belong to her friends, do not forbear to keep them, or shall take out of them
any goods belonging to her said friends, the said persons so offending shall be
reputed and tried as pirates, and shall receive the due punishment for piracy.
And to the intent that all persons may understand with what conditions all
persons serving on the seas against the Spaniard, are licenced: her Majesty
has commanded that the very condition of the parties bonds that are licensed,
should be annexed to this Proclamation, the which being duly observed, as her
meaning is it should be, her Majesty doubts not but her actions shall be
thought consonant to honor, to justice, and to the allowance of her friends and
allies, leaving the false calumniations of her enemies, and the avenge of their
wilful disturbance of the common peace of Christendom, for satisfying of
their ambition, to the judgment of Almighty God, to whose wisdom and power
only belongs the chastisement of such as seek for their own ambition to
confound the state of Christendom with bloody wars and depopulations of
Christian countries, wherein they have no interest. Given at her Majesty's manor
of Richmond, the third day of February in the three and thirtieth year of her
reign. 1590.

The form of the Conditions limited to be observed by all such as are
licensed to go to the Seas against the Spaniardes.
THe condition of this Obligation is such, That where there is Commission of
reprisall granted unto A. B. to send to the Seas the good ship called the P.
of B. of the burden of Tons, or thereaboutes, whereof I. N. goes captain
and master, with men, ordinance, and victuals sufficient for the same service,
for the apprehending and taking of the ships, goods, and marchandises of the
king of Spain, or any of his subjects, as by the tenor of the said Commission
more at large appears: If therefore the said I. N. with the said ship the
P. of B. and her company, do presently after their putting to Seas, with all
possible speed repair to the coasts of Spain, Portingall, the Islands, and
other remote places where the Spaniards and Portingals do most use their
traffic and trade of Marchandises, and do not attempt any thing against any
of her Majesty's loving subjects, or the subjects of the French king, or of the
kings of Scotland, Denmark, or any princes of Italy being in league with her
Majesty, the inhabitants of the united provinces of the Low countries, and
Haunce towns, or any other Prince or Potentate being in good league and amity
with her Majesty, but only against the said king of Spain and his subjects,
and his and their ships, goods and marchandises, and do bring, or cause to be
brought all such ships, goods and Marchandises as they shall happen to take and
apprehend by virtue of the said Commission, together with two or three of the
chiefest persons of every ship which they shall take (whereof the Master and
Pilot to be two) to some port of this her Majesty's Realm of England, as
shall be most convenient for them, and do not break bulk, waste, spoil,
sell, embezill, or diminish any part or parcel thereof, until they shall be
adjudged in her Majesty's high court of the Admiraltie to be good and lawful
prise, and thereupon an Inventory to be taken by the viceadmirall of the place
and port where they shall so ariue, or his deputy, or other public officers
of the same, and an appraisement be made of the said ships and goods by some
six honest men inhabitants of the said port, and that the said Inventory and
appraisement be returned into the said high court of the Admiraltie, within
six weeks then next after ensuing: That then etc.

God save the Queen.

Queens most excellent Majesty.
