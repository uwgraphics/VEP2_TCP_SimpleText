ENDIMION and Phoebe. IDEAS LATMVS. Phoebus erit nostri princeps, et carminis
Author.

AT LONDON, Printed by James Roberts, for John Bushie.

TO THE EXCELLENT and most accomplished Lady: Lucie Countess of Bedford.
Great Lady, essence of my cheifest good,
Of the most pure and finest tempred spirit
Adornd with gifts, enobled by thy blood,
Which by descent true virtue do inherit;
That virtue which no fortune can deprive,
Which thou by birth take from thy gracious mother,
Whose royal minds with equal motion strive
Which most in honor shall excel the other;
Unto thy fame my Muse her felse shall task
Which rain'st upon me thy sweet golden showers,
And but thy self, no subject will I ask,
Upon whose praise my soul shall spend her powers.
Sweet Lady then, grace this poor Muse of mine,
Whose faith, whose zeal, whose life, whose all is thine.
Your Honors humbly diuoted Michael Drayton.
Rouland when first I red thy stately rymes
In Sheepheards weeds, when yet thou liu'dst unknown,
Not seen in public in those former times,
But unto Ankor tund'st thy Pype alone.
I then beheld thy chaste Ideas fame.
Put on the wings of thine immortal style,
Whose rarest virtues, and deserved name
Thy Muse renowns throughout this glorious I Will,
Thy lines, like to the Lawrells pleasant shade,
In after ages shall adorn her Hearse,
Nor can her beauties glory fade
Decked in the colors of thy happy verse
Thy fiery spirit mounts up to the sky,
And what thou writ'st lives to Eternitye.
E. P.
To Idea.
A Midst those shades wherein the Muses sit,
Thus to Idea, my Idea sings,
Support of wisdom, better force of Wit:
Which by desert, desert to honor brings,
Borne to create good thoughts by thy rare worth,
Whom Nature with her bounteous store does bless,
More excellent then Art can set thee forth;
Happy in more, then praises can express:
Which by thy self shall make thy self continue,
When all worlds glory shall be clean forgot,
Thus I the least of skillful Arts retinue:
Write in thy praise which time shall never blot;
Heaven made thee what thou art, till worlds be done,
Thy fame shall flourish like the rising Sun.

Endimion and Phoebe. Ideas Latmus.
IN I-onia whence sprang old Poets fame,
From whom that Sea did first derive her name,
The blessed bed whereon the Muses lay,
Beauty of Greece, the pride of Asia,
Whence Archelaus whom times historifie,
First unto Athens brought Phylosophie.
In this fair Region on a goodly Plain,
Stretching her bounds unto the bordring Maine,
The Mountain Latmus ouer-lookes the Sea,
Smiling to see the Ocean billows play:
Latmus, where young Endimion vsd to keep
His fairest flock of siluer-fleeced sheep.
To whom Siluanus often would resort,
At barly-breake to see the Satyrs sport;
And when rude Pan his Tabret list to sound,
To see the fair Nymphs foot it in a round,
Under the trees which on this Mountain grew,
As yet the like Arabia never knew:
For all the pleasures Nature could devise,
Within this plot she did imparadize;
And great Diana of her special grace,
With Vestall rytes had hallowed all the place:
Upon this Mount there stood a stately Grove,
Whose reaching arms, to clip the Welkin strove,
Of tufted Cedars, and the branching Pine,
Whose bushy tops themselves do so intwine,
As seemed when Nature first this work begun,
She then conspired against the piercing Sun;
Under whose covert (thus divinely made)
Pboebus green Laurel flonsht in the shade:
Fair Venus Mirtile, Mars his warlike Fyrre,
Mineruas Olive, and the weeping Myrhe,
The patient Palm, which thriues in spite of hate,
The Popler, to Alcides consecrate;
Which Nature in such order had disposed,
And there-withall these goodly walks enclosed,
As served for hangings and rich Tapestry,
To beautify this stately Gallery:
Imbraudring these in curious trailes along,
The clustred Grapes, the golden Citrons hung,
More glorious the the precious fruit were these,
Kept by the Dragon in Hesperides;
Or gorgious Arras in rich colors wrought,
With silk from Afric, or from Indie brought:
Out of this soil sweet bubling Fountains crept,
As though for joy the senseless stones had wept;
With straying channels dancing sundry ways,
With often turns, like to a curious Maze:
Which breaking forth, the tender grass bedewed
Whose silver sand with orient Pearl was strewed,
Shadowed with Roses and sweet Eglantine,
Dipping their sprayes into this christalline:
From which the byrds the purple berries pruned,
And to their loves their small recorders tuned.
The Nightingale, woods Herald of the Spring,
The whistling Woosell, Mauis carroling,
Tuning their trebbles to the waters fall,
Which made the musicque more angelical:
Whilst gentle Zephyre murmuring among,
Kept time, and bare the burden to the song.
About whose brims, renfresht with dainty showers,
Grew Amaranthus, and sweet Gilliflowers,
The Marigold, Phoebus beloved friend,
The Moly, which from sorcery does defend:
Violet, Carnation, Balm and Cassia,
Ideas Primrose, coronet of May.
Above this Grove a gentle fair ascent,
Which by degrees of Milk-white Marble went:
Upon the top, a Paradise was found,
With which, Nature this miracle had crowned;
Empald with Rocks of rarest precious stone,
Which like the flames of Aetna brightly shone;
And served as Lanthornes furnished with light,
To guide the wandering passengers by night:
For which fair Phoebe sliding from her Sphere,
Used often times to come and sport her there.
And from the Azure starry-painted Sky,
Embalmd the bancks with precious lunary:
That now her Menalus she quite forsook,
And unto Latmus wholly her betook,
And in this place her pleasure used to take,
And all was for her sweet Endimions sake:
Endimion, the lovely Shepherds boy,
Endimion, great Phoebes only joy,
Endimion, in whose pure-shining eyes,
The naked Faries daunst the hey degies.
The shag-haird Satyrs Mountain-climing race,
Have been made tame by gazing in his face.
For this boys love, the water-Nymphs have wept
Stealing often times to kiss him whilst he slept:
And tasting once the Nectar of his breath,
Surfeit with sweet, and languish unto death;
And Jove oft-times bent to lascivious sport,
And coming where Endimion did resort,
Has courted him, inflamed with desire,
Thinking some Nymph was clothed in boys attire.
And oftentimes the simple rural Swains,
Beholding him in crossing over the Plains,
Imagined, Apollo from above
Put on this shape, to win some Maidens love.
This Shepherd, Phoebe ever did behold,
Whose love already had her thoughts controld;
From Latmus top (her stately throne) she rose,
And to Endimion down beneath she goes.
Her Brothers beams now had she laid aside,
Her horned cressent, and her full-fac'd pride:
For had she come adorned with her light,
No mortal eye could have endured the sight;
But like a Nymph, crowned with a flowrie twine,
And not like Phoebe, as herself divine.
An Azur'd Mantle purfled with a veil,
Which in the Air puffed like a swelling sail,
Embosted Rayne-bowes did appear in silk,
With wauie streams as white as mornings Milk:
Which ever as the gentle Air did blow,
Still with the motion seemed to ebb and flow:
About her neck a chain twice twenty fold,
Of Rubyes, set in lozenges of gold;
Trust up in trammels, and in curious pleats,
With spheary circles falling on her teats.
A dainty smock of Cipresse, fine and thin,
Over cast with curls next to her Lilly skin:
Through which the pureness of the same did show
Like Damaske-roses strewn with flakes of snow.
Discovering all her stomach to the waste,
With branches of sweet circling veins enchaste.
A Coronet she ware of Myrtle bows,
Which gave a shadow to her Iuory brows.
No smother beauty mask did beauty smother
"Great lights dim less yet burn not one another,
Nature abhorrs to borrow from the Mart,
"Simples fit beauty, fie on drugs and Art.
Thus came she where her love Endimion lay,
Who with sweet Carrols sang the night away;
And as it is the Shepherds usual trade,
Often on his pype a Roundelay he played.
As meek he was as any Lamb might be,
Nor never lyu'd a fayrer youth then he:
His dainty hand, the snow it self did stayne,
Or her to whom Jove showered in golden rain:
From whose sweet palm the liquid Pearl did swell,
Pure as the drops of Aganippas Well:
Clear as the liquor which fair Hebe spylt;
His sheephooke silver, damask'd all with gilt.
The staff it self, of snowie Iuory,
Studded with Currall, tipped with Ebony;
His tresses, of the Ravens shyning black,
Straggling in curles along his manly back.
The balls which nature in his eyes had set,
Like Diamonds enclosing Globes of Iet:
Which sparkled from their milky lids outright,
Like fair Orions heauen-adorning light.
The stars on which her heavenly eyes were bent,
And fixed still with lovely blandishment,
For whom so often disguised she was seen,
As she Celestial Phoebe had not been:
Her dainty Buskins laced unto the knee,
Her pleyted Frock, truck'd up accordingly:
A Nymph-like huntresse, armed with bow and dart
About the woods she scoures the long-hu'd Heart.
She climes the mou^tains with the light-foot Fauns
And with the Satyrs scuds it over the Launes.
In Musicks sweet delight she shows her skill,
Quauering the Cithron nimbly with her quill,
Upon each tree she carues Endimions name
In Gordian knots, with Phoebe to the same:
To kill him venson now she pitched her toils,
And to this lovely Raunger brings the spoils;
And thus whilst she by chaste desire is led
Unto the Downs where he his fair Flocks fed,
Near to a Grove she had Endimion spide,
Where he was fishing by a River side
Under a Popler, shadowed from the Sun,
Where merrily to court him she begun:
Sweet boy (quoth.she) take what thy heart can wish,
When thou do angle would I were a fish,
When thou art sporting by the silver Brooks,
Put in thy hand thou need'st no other hooks;
Hard hearted boy Endimion look on me,
Nothing on earth I hold too dear for thee:
I am a Nymph and not of human blood,
Begot by Pan on Isis sacred flood:
When I was borne upon that very day,
Phoebus was seen the Reueller to play:
In Jove's hye house the Gods assembled all,
And Juno held her sumptuous Festival,
Oceanus that hour was dancing spy'de,
And Tython seen to frolic with his Bride,
The Halcions that season sweetly sang,
And all the shores, with shouting Sea-Nymphes rang,
And on that day, my birth to memorize,
The Shepherds hold a solemn sacrifice:
The chaste Diana nursed me in her lap,
And I sucked Nectar from her Downe-soft pap.
The Well wherein this body bathed first,
Who drinks thereof, shall never after thirst;
The water has the Lunacie appeased,
And by the virtue, cures all diseased;
The place wherein my bare feet touch the mold,
Made up in balls, for Pomander is sold.
See, see, these hands have robbed the Snow of white,
These dainty singers, organs of delight:
Behold these lyps, the Load-stones of desire,
Whose words inchant, like Amphyons well-tuned lyre,
This foot, Arts just proportion does reveal,
Signing the earth with heavens own manuel seal.
Go, play the wanton, I will tend thy flock,
And wait the hours as duly as a clock;
I Will deck thy Ram with bells, an I wreathes of Bay,
And gild his horns upon the sheering day;
And with a garlond crown thee Shepherds king,
And thou shall lead the gay Gyrles in a ring;
Birds with their wings shall fan thee in the Sun,
And all the fountaynes with pure Wine shall run,
I have a Quier of dainty Turtle-doues,
And they shall fit and sweetly sing our loves:
I Will lay thee on the Swans soft downy plume,
And all the Wind shall gently breath perfume,
I Will plat thy locks with many a curious pleate,
And chafe thy temples with a sacred heat;
The Muses still shall keep thee company,
And lull thee with inchaunting harmony;
If not all these, yet let my virtues move thee,
A chaster Nymph Endimion cannot love thee.
But he imagined she some Nymph had been,
Because she was apparrelled in green;
Or happily, some of fair Floras train,
Which often did use to sport upon the Plain:
He tells her, he was Phoebes servant sworn,
And often in hunting had her Quiver borne,
And that to her virginity he vowed,
Which in no hand by Venus was allowed;
Then unto her a Catalogue recites
Of Phoebes Statutes, and her hallowed Rites,
And of the grievous penalty inflicted,
On such as her chaste laws had interdicted:
Now, he requests, that she would stand aside,
Because the fish her shadow had espide;
Then he entreats her that she would be gone,
And at this time to let him be alone;
Then turns him from her in an angry sort,
And frowns and chafes that she had spoiled his sport.
And then he threatens her, if she did stay,
And told her, great Diana came this way.
But for all this, this Nymph would not forbear,
But now she smoothes his crispy-curled hair,
And when he (rudely) willed her to refrain,
Yet scarcely ended, she begins again:
Thy Ewes (quoth. she) with Milk shall daily spring,
And to thy profit yearly Twins shall bring,
And thy fair flock, (a wonder to behold)
Shall have their fleeces turned to burnisht gold;
Thy batefull pasture to thy wanton Thewes,
Shall be refresht with Nectar-dropping dewes,
The Oaks smooth leaves, sirropt with honey fall,
Trickle down drops to quench thy thirst withal:
The cruel Tygar will I tame for thee,
And gently lay his head upon thy knee;
And by my spells, the Wolves jaws will I lock,
And (as good Sheepheards) make them guard thy flock,
I Will mount thee bravely on a Lions back,
To drive the fomy-tusked Bore to wrack:
The brazen-hoofed yelling Bulls I Will yoke,
And with my herbs, the scaly Dragon choke.
Thou in great Phoebes Iuory Coche shall ride,
Which drawn by Eagles, in the air shall glide:
I Will stay the time, it shall not steal away,
And twenty Moons as seeming but one day.
Behold (fond boy) this Rozen-weeping Pine,
This mournful Larix, dropping Turpentine,
This mounting Teda, thus with tempests torn,
With incky tears continually to mourn;
Look on this tree, which blubbereth Amber gum
which seems to speak to thee, though it be dumb,
Which being senceles blocks, as thou do see,
Weep at my woes, that thou might pity me:
O thou art young, and fit for loves profession,
Like wax which warmed quickly takes impressio^,
Sorrow in time, with floods those eyes shall wear,
Whence pity now cannot extort a tear.
Fond boy, with words thou might be overcome,
"But love surpised the heart, the tongue is dumb,
But as I can, I Will strive to conquer thee;
Yet tears, and sighs, my weapons needs must be.
My sighs move trees, rocks melting with my tears,
But thou art blind; and cruel stop'st thine ears:
Look in this Well, (if beauty men allow)
Though thou be fair, yet I as fair as thou;
I am a Vestall, and a spotles Maid,
Although by love to thee I am betrayed:
But since (unkind) thou do my love disdain,
To rocks and hills my self I will complain.
Thus with a sigh, her speeches of she broke,
The ilst her eyes to him in silence spoke;
And from the place this wanton Nymph arose,
And up to Latmus all in have she goes;
Like to a Nymph on shady Citberon,
The swift Ismoenos, or Thirmodoon,
Gliding like Thetis, on the fleet waves borne,
Or she which trips upon the ears of Corn;
Like Swallows when in open air they strive,
Or like the Foul which towering Falcons drive.
But whilst the wanton thus pursued his sport,
Deceitful Love had vndermin'd the Fort,
And by a breach (in spite of all deniance,)
Entered the Fort which lately made defiance:
And with strong siedge had now begirt about
The maiden Skonce which held the soldier out.
"Love wants his eyes, yet shoots he passing right,
His shafts our thoughts, his bow he makes our sight.
His deadly piles are tempred by such Art,
As still directs the Arrowe to the heart:
He cannot love, and yet forsooth he will,
He sees her not, and yet he sees her still,
He goes unto the place she stood upon,
And asks the poor soil whether she was gone;
Feign would he follow her, yet makes delay,
Feign would he go, and yet feign would he stay,
He kissed the flowers depressed with her feet,
And swears from her they borrowed all their sweet.
Feign would he cast aside this troublous thought,
But still like poison, more and more it wrought,
And to himself thus often would he say,
Here my Love sat, in this place did she play,
Here in this Fountain has my Goddess been,
And with her presence has she graced this green.
Now black-brow'd Night placed in her chair of Iet,
Sat wrapped in clouds within her Cabinet,
And with her dusky mantle ouer-spred,
The path the Sunny Palfrayes used to tred;
And Cynthia sitting in her Crystal chair,
In all her pomp now rid along her Sphere,
The honnied dew descended in soft showers,
Drizled in Pearl upon the tender flowers;
And Zephyre hushed, and with a whispering gale,
Seemed to harken to the Nightingale,
Which in the thorny brakes with her sweet song,
Unto the silent Night bewrayd her wrong.
Now fast by Latmus near unto a Grove,
Which by the mount was shadowed from above,
Upon a banck Endimion sat by night,
To whom fair Phoebe lent her friendly light:
And fith his flocks were laid them down to rest,
Thus gives his sorrows passage from his breast;
Sweet leaves (quoth.he) which with the air do tremble,
Oh how your motions do my thoughts resemble,
With that mild breath, by which only move,
Whisper my words in silence to my Love:
Convey my sighs sweet Ciuet-breathing air,
In doleful accents to my heavenly fair;
You murmuring Springs, like doleful Instruments
Upon your gravel sound my sad laments,
And in your silent bubling as you go,
Consort your selves like Music to my woe.
And lifting now his sad and heavy eyes
Up, toward the beauty of the burnisht skies,
Bright Lamps (quoth.he) the glorious Welkin bears,
Which clip about the Plannets wandering Spears,
And in your circled Maze do ever role,
Dancing about the neuer-moouing Pole:
Sweet Nymph, which in fair Elice do shine,
Whom thy surpassing beauty made divine,
Now in the Artick constellation,
Smyle sweet Calisto on Endimion:
And thou brave Perseus in the Northern air, The constellations near the Pole
Artick

Holding Medusa by the snaky hair,
Jove's showre-begotten Son, whose valor tried,
In seauenteene glorious lights art stellified;
Which won'st thy love, left as a Monsters pray;
And thou the lovely fair Andromida,
Borne of the famous Etheopianlyne,
Darting these rays from thy transpiercing eyne,
To thee the bright Cassiopey, with these,
Whose beauty strove with the Neriedes,
With all the troop of the celestial band,
Which on Olimpus in your glory stand;
And you great wandering lights, if from your Spears
You have regard unto a Sheepeheards tears,
Or as men say, if over earthly things
You only rule as Potentates and Kings,
Unto my loves event sweet Stars direct,
Your kindest revolution and aspect,
And bend your clear eyes from your Thrones above
Upon Endimion pyning thus in love.
Now, ere the purple dauning yet did spring,
The joyful Lark began to stretch her wing,
And now the Cock the mornings Trumpeter,
Played hunts-vp for the day star to appear,
Down slydeth Phoebe from her Crystal chair,
Sdayning to lend her light unto the air,
But unto Latmus all in haste is gone,
Longing to see her sweet Endimion;
At whose departure all the Plannets gazed,
As at some seld-seene accident amazed,
Till reasoning of the same, they fell at ods,
So that a question grew amongst the Gods,
Whether without a general consent
She might depart their sacred Parliament?
But what they could do was but all in vain,
Of liberty they could her not restrain:
For of the seven since she the lowest was,
Unto the earth she might the easiest pass;
Since only by her moysty influence,
Of earthly things she has preliminence,
And under her, man's mutable estate,
As with her changes does participate;
And from the working of her waning source,
The uncertain waters held a certain course,
Throughout her kingdom she might walk at large
Whereof as Empress she had care and charge,
And as the Sun unto the Day gives light, guide,
So is she only Mistress of the Night;
Which whilst she in her oblique course does
The glittering stars apeare in all their pride,
Which to her light their friendly Lamps do lend;
And on her train as Hand-maydes do attend,
And thirteen times she through her Sphere does run,
Ere Phoebus full his yearly course have don:
And unto her of women is assigned,
Predominance of body and of mind,
That as of Plannets she most variable,
So of all creatures they most mutable,
But her sweet Latmus which she loved so much,
No sooner once her dainty foot does touch,
But that the Mountain with her brightness shone
And gave a light to all the Horizone:
Even as the Sun which darkness long did shroud,
Breaks suddenly from underneath a clowd,
So that the Nimphs which on her still attended,
Knew certainly great Phoebe was descended;
And all aproched to this sacred hill,
There to awayt their sovereign Goddess will,
And now the little Birds whom Nature taught,
To honor great Diana as they ought,
Because she is the Goddess of the woods,
And sole preserver of their hallowed floods,
Set to their consort in their lower springs,
That with the Music all the mountain rings;
So that it seemd the Birds of every Grove
Which should excel and pass each other strove,
That in the higher woods and hollow grounds,
The murmuring Echo every where resounds,
The trembling brooks their slyding courses stayed,
The whilst the waves one with another played,
And all the flocks in this rejoicing mood,
As though in chaunted do forbear their food:
The herds of Dear down from the mountains flew,
As loath to come within Dianas view,
Whose piercing arrows from her Iuory bow,
Had often taught her powerful hand to know;
And now from latmus looking toward the plains
Casting her eyes upon the Sheepheards swains,
Perceived her dear Endimions flock were strayed
And he himself upon the ground was laid;
Who late recald from melancholy deep,
The chaunting Birds had lulled now asleep:
For why the Music in this humble kind,
As it first found, so does it leave the mind;
And melancholy from the Spleen begun,
By passion moved, into the veins does run;
Which when this humor as a swelling Flood
By vig or is infused in the blood;
The vital spirits does mightily apall;
And weakeneth so the parts organicall, The effect of Melansholic

And when the senses are disturbd and tierd,
With what the heart incessantly desierd,
Like Travelers with labor long oppressed,
Finding release, eft-soones they fall to rest.
And coming now to her Endimion,
Whom heavy sleep had lately ceased upon,
Kneeling her down, him in her arms she clips, showrs
And with sweet kisses seals up his lips,
Whilst from her eyes, tears streaming down in
Fell on his cheeks like dew upon the flowrs,
In globy circles like pure drops of Milk,
Sprinkled on Roses, or fine crimson silk:
Touching his brow, this is the seat (quoth she)
Where Beauty sits in all her Majesty,
She calls his eyelids those pure Crystal couers
Which do include the looking Glass of Lovers,
She calls his lips the sweet delicious folds
Which rare perfume and precious in cense holds,
She calls his soft smooth Allablaster skin,
The Lawne which Angels are attyred in,
Sweet face (quoth. she) but wanting words I spare thee
Except to heaven alone I should compare thee:
And whilst her words she wastes thus in vain,
Sporting herself the time to entertayne,
The frolic Nymphs with Musicks facred sound,
Entered the Meddowes daunding in a round:
And unto Phoebe straight their course direct,
Which now their joyful coming did expect,
Before whose feet their flowrie spoils they lay,
And with svveet Balm his body do imbay.
And on the Laurels growing there along,
Their wreathed garlonds all about they hung:
And all the ground within the compass load,
With sweet est flowers, whereon they lightly troad.
With Nectar then his temples they be dew,
And kneeling softly kiss him all arew;
Then in brave galiards they themselves advance,
And in the Tryas Baccbus stately dance;
Then following on fair Floras gilded train,
Into the Groves they thus depart again,
And now to show her powerful deity,
Her sweet Endimion more to beautify,
Into his soul the Goddess, does infuse,
The fiery nature of a heavenly Muse,
Which in the spyrit laboring by the mind
Pertaketh of celestial things by kind: The excellency of the soul

For why the soul being divine alone,
Exempt from vile and gross corruption,
Of heavenly secrets comprehensible,
Of which the dull flesh is not sensible,
And by one only powerful faculty,
Yet governs a multiplicity,
Being effentiall, uniform in all;
Not to be seuer'd nor diuiduall,
But in her function hold eth her estate,
By powers divine in her ingenerate,
And so by inspiration condeaueth
What heaven to her by divination breaths;
But they no sooner to the shades were gone,
Leaving their Goddess by Endimion,
But by the hand the lovely boy she takes,
And from his sweet sleep softly him awakes,
Who being struck into a sodaynefeare,
Beholding thus his glorious Goddess there,
His heart transpiersed with this sudden glance,
Became as one late cast into a trance:
Wiping his eyes not yet of perfect sight,
Scarcely awaked amazed at the light,
His cheeks now pale then lovely blushing red,
Which often increasd, and quickly vanished,
And as on him her fixed eyes were bent,
So to and fro his color came and went;
Like to a Crystal near the fire set,
Against the brightness rightly opposet, The causes of the external signs of
passioa.

Now does reteyne the color of the flame,
And lightly moved again, reflects the same;
For our affection quickened by her heat,
Alayd and strengthened by a strong conceit,
The mind disturbed, forth with does conuart,
To an internal passion of the heart
By motion of that sudden joy or fear,
Which we receive either by the eye or ear,
For by retraction of the spirit and blood,
From those exterior parts where first they stood,
Into the center of the body sent,
Returns again more strong and vehement:
And in the like extreamitie made cold,
About the same, themselves do closely hold,
And though the cause be like in this respect,
Works by this means a contrary effect.
Thus whilst this passion hotely held his course,
Ebbing and flowing from his springing source,
With the strong fit of this sweet Fever moved,
At sight of her which he entirely loved,
Not knowing yet great Phoebe this should be,
His sovereign Goddess, Queen of Chastity,
Now like a man whom Love had learned Art,
Resolved at once his secrets to impart:
But first repeats the torments he had past,
The woes endured since time he saw her laft,
Now he reports he noted whilst she spoke,
The bustling winds their murmr often brake,
And being silent, seemd to pause and stay,
To listen to her what she meant to say:
Be kind (quoth he) sweet Nymph unto thy lover,
My souls sole effence, and my senses mouer,
Life of my life, pure Image of my heart,
Impressure of Conceit, Invention, Art,
My vital spirit, receues his spirit from thee,
Thou art that all which rules all in me,
Thou art the sap, and life whereby I live,
Which powerful vigor do receive and give;
Thou nourishest the flame wherein I burn,
The North whereto my hearts true tuch does turn.
Pity my poor flock, see their woeful plight,
Their Master perished living from thy sight,
Their fleeces rent, my tresses all forlorn,
I pyne, whilst they their pasture have forborne;
Behold (quoth he) this little flower below,
Which here within this Fountain brim does grow;
With that, a solemn tale begins to tell
Of this fair flower, and of this holy Well,
A goodly legend, many Winters old,
Learned by the Sheepheards fitting by their fold,
How once this Fountain was a youthful swain,
A frolic boy and kept upon the plain,
Unfortunate it hapt to him (quoth he)
To love a fair Nymph as I now love thee,
To her his love and sorrow he imparts,
Which might dissolve a rock of flinty hearts;
To her he sues, to her he makes his moan,
But she more deaf and hard then steel or stone;
And thus one day with grief of mind oppressed,
As in this place he laid him down to rest,
The Gods at length upon his sorrows look,
Transforming him into this pirrling Brook,
Whose murmuring bubles softly as they creep,
Falling in drops, the Channel seems to weep,
But she thus careless of his misery.
Still spends her days in mirth and iollity;
And coming one day to the River side,
Laughing for joy when she the same espyde,
This wanton Nymph in that unhappy hour,
Was here transformd into this purple flower,
Which toward the water turns it self again,
To pity him by her unkindness slain.
She, as it seemd, who all this time attended,
Longing to hear that once his tale were ended,
Now like a jealous woman she repeats,
Men's subtilties, and natural deceyts;
And by example strives to verify,
Their ficklenes and vain inconstancy:
Their hard obdurate hearts, and wilful blindness,
Telling a story wholly of unkindness;
But he, who well perceived her intent,
And to remove her from this argument,
Now by the sacred Fount he vows and swears,
By Lovers sighs, and by her hallowed tears,
By holy Latmus now he takes his oath,
That all he spoke was in good faith and troth;
And for no frail uncertain doubt should move her,
Vows secrecy, the crown of a true Lover.
She hearing this, thought time that she reueald,
That kind affection which she long conceald,
Determines to make her true Love known,
Which she had borne unto Endimion;
I am no Huntresse, nor no Nymph(quoth she)
As thou perhaps imagin'st me to be,
I am great Phoebe, Latmus sacred Queen,
Who from the skies have hither past unseen,
And by thy chaste love hither was I led,
Where full three years thy fair flock have I fed,
Upon these Mountains and these firtile plains,
And crowned thee King of all the Sheepheards, swains:
Nor wanton, nor laciuious is my love,
nor never lust my chaste thoughts once could move
But since thou thus have offered at my Shrine,
And of the Gods have held me most divine,
Mine Altars thou with sacrifice have stord,
And in my Temples have my name adored,
And of all other, most have honored me,
Great Phoebes glory thou alone shall see.
This spoke, she puts on her brave attire,
As being burnisht in her Brothers fire,
Purer then that Celestial shining flame
Wherein great Jove unto his Lemmon came,
Which quickly had his pale cheeks ouer-spred,
And tincted with a lovely blushing red.
Which whilst her Brother Titan for a space,
Withdrew himself, to give his sister place,
She now is darkened to all creatures eyes,
Whilst in the shadow of the earth she lies,
For that the earth of nature cold and dry,
A very Chaos of obscurity,
Whose Globe exceeds her compass by degrees,
Fixed upon her Superficies;
When in his shadow she does hap to fall,
Does cause her darkness to be general.
Thus whilst he laid his head upon her lap,
She in a fiery Mantle does him wrap,
And carries him up form this lumpish mould,
Into the skies, whereas he might behold,
The earth in perfect roundnes of a ball
Exceeding globes most artificial:
Which in a fixed point Nature disposed,
And with the sundry Elements enclosed,
Which as the Center permanent does stay,
When as the skiesin their diurnall sway,
Strongly maintain the euer-turning course,
Forced alone by their first moouer sourse,
Where he beholds the ayery Regions,
Whereas the clouds and strange impressions,
Maintaynd by coldness often do appear,
And by the highest Region of the air,
Unto the cleerest Element of fire,
Which to her silver footstool does aspire,
Then does she mount him up into her Sphere,
Imparting heavenly secrets to him there,
Where lightened by her shining beams he sees,
The powerful Plannets, all in their degrees,
Their sundry reuolutions in the skies,
And by their working how they simpathize;
All in their circles severally prefixed,
And in due distance each with other mixed:
The mantions which they hold in their estate,
Of which by nature they participate;
And how those signs their several places take,
Within the compass of the Zodiac:
And in their several triplicities consent, The signs in their triplicities,
participate with the Elements.

Unto the nature of an Element,
To which the Plannets do themselves disperce,
Having the guidance of this universe,
And do from thence extend their several powers,
Unto this little fleshly world of ours:
Wherein her Makers workmanship is found,
As in contriuing of this mighty round,
In such strange manner and such fashion wrought,
As does exceed man's dull and feeble thought,
Guiding us still by their directions;
And that our fleshly frail complections,
Of Elementall natures grounded be,
With which our dispositions most agree,
Some of the fire and air participate,
And some of watery and of earthy state,
As hot and moist, with chilly cold and dry,
And unto these the other contrary;
And by their influence powerful on the earth,
Predominant in man's frail mortal bearth,
And that our lives effects and fortunes are,
As is that happy or unlucky Star,
Which reigning in our frail nativity,
Seals up the secrets of our destiny,
With friendly Plannets in conjunction set,
Or else with other merely opposet:
And now to him her greatest power she lent,
To lift him to the starry Firmament,
Where he beheld that milky stained place,
By which the Twynns and heavenly Archers trace,
The dog which does the furious Lion beat,
Whose flaming breath increases Titans heat,
The teare-distilling mournful Pliades,
Which on the earth the storms and tempests raise,
And all the course the constellations run,
When in conjunction with the Moon or Sun,
When toward the fixed Articke they arise,
When toward the Antaricke, falling from our eyes;
And having impt the wings of his desire,
And kindled him, with this celestial fire,
She sets him down, and vanishing his sight,
Leaves him inwrapped in this true delight:
Now wheresoever he his fair flock fed,
The Muses still Endimion followed;
His sheep as white as Swans or driven snow,
Which beautified the soil with such a show,
As where he folded in the darkest Night,
There never needed any other light;
If that he hungered and desired meat,
The Bees would bring him Honny for to eat,
Yet from his lyps would not depart away,
Till they were laden with Ambrosia;
And if he thirsted, often there was seen
A bubling Fountain spring out of the green,
With Crystal liquor filled unto the brim,
Which did present her liquid store to him.
If he would hunt, the fair Nymphs at his will,
With Bows and Quiuers, would attend him still:
And what-soeuer he desierd to have,
That he obtained if he the same would crave.
And now at length, the joyful time drew on,
She meant to honor her Endimion,
And glorify him on that stately Mount
Whereof the Goddess made so great account.
She sends Jove's winged Herald to the woods,
The neighbor Fountains, and the bordring floods,
Charging the Nymphs which did inhabit there,
upon a day appointed to appear,
And to attend her sacred Majesty
In all their pomp and great solemnity.
Having obtaynd great Phoebus free consent,
To further her divine and chaste intent,
Which thus imposed as a thing of weight,
In stately troops appear before her straight,
The Fannes and Satyrs from the tufted Brakes,
Their brisly arms wreathed al about with snakes;
Their sturdy loins with ropes of Iuie bound,
Their horned heads with Woodbine Chaplets crowned,
With Cipresse Iauelens. and about their thyes,
The flaggy hair disordered loosely flies:
The Oriades like to the Spartan Maid,
In Murrie-scyndall gorgiously arayd:
With gallant green Scarfes girded in the wast,
Their flaxen hair with silken fillets laced,
Woue^ with flowers in sweet lascivious wreathes,
Moving like feathers as the light air breathes,
With crowns of Myrtle, glorious to behold,
whose leaves are painted with pure drops of gold:
With trains of fine Bisse checkered al with frets
Of dainty Pincks and precious Violets,
In branched Buskins of fine Cordiwin,
With spangled garters down unto the shin,
Fringed with fine silk, of many a sundry kind,
Which like to pennons waued with the wind.
The Hamadriads from their shady Bowers,
Decked up in Garlonds of the rarest flowers,
Upon the backs of milke-white Bulls were set,
With horn and hoof as black as any let,
Whose collers were great massy golden rings,
Led by their swaynes in twisted silken strings;
Then did the lovely Driades appear,
On dapled Staggs, which bravely mounted were,
Whose velvet palms with nosegaies rarely dight,
To all the rest bred wonderful delight;
And in this sort accompaned with these,
In triumph rid the watery Niades,
Upon Sea-horses, trapt with shining finns,
Armed with their male impenitrable skinns,
Whose scaly crests like Raine-bowes bended hye;
Seem to control proud Iris in the sky;
Upon a Chariot was Endimion laid,
In snowy Tissue gorgiously arayd,
Of precious Iuory covered over with Lawne,
Which by four stately Unicorns was drawn.
Of ropes of Orient pearl their traces were,
Pure as the path which does in heaven appear,
With rarest flowers in chaste and ouer-spred,
Which served as Curtaynes to this glorious bed,
Whose seat of Crystal in the Sunbeams shone,
Like thunder-breathing Jove's celestial Throne,
Upon his head a Coronet instald,
Of one entire and mighty Emerald,
With richest Bracelets on his lilly wrists,
Of Hellitropium, linckt with golden twists;
A beuy of fair Swans, which flying over,
With their large wings him from the Sun do cover,
And easily wafting as he went along,
Do lull him still with their inchaunting song,
Whilst all the Nymphs on solemn Instruments,
Sound dainty Music to their sweet laments.
And now great Phoebe in her triumph came,
With all the tytles of her glorious name,
Diana, Delia, Luna, Cynthia,
Virago, Hecate, and Elythia,
Prothiria, Dictinna, Proserpine,
Latona, and Lucina, most divine;
And in her pomp began now to approach,
Mounted aloft upon her Crystal Coach,
Drawn over the playnes by four pure milk-white Hinds,
Whose nimble feet seemed winged with the winds,
Her rarest beauty being now begun,
But newly borrowed from the golden Sun,
Her lovely cressant with a decent space,
By due proportion beautified her face,
Till having fully filled her circled side,
Her glorious fulness now appeard in pride;
which long her changing brow could not retain,
But fully waxt, began again to wane;
Upon her brow (like meteors in the air)
Twenty and eight great gorgious lamps she bare;
Some, as the VVelkin, shining passing bright,
Some not so sumptuous, others lesser light,
Some burn, some other, let their fair lights fall,
Compofd in order Geometrical;
And to adorn her with a greater grace,
And ad more beauty to her lovely face,
Her richest Globe she gloriously displayes,
Now that the Sun had hid his golden rays:
Least that his radiencie should her suppress,
And so might make her beauty seem the less;
Her stately train laid out in azur'd bars,
Poudred all thick with troops of silver stars:
Her ayrie vesture yet so rare and strange,
As every hour the color seemed to change,
Yet still the former beauty does retain,
And ever came unto the same again.
Then fair Astrea, of the Titans line,
Whom equity and justice made divine,
Was seated here upon the silver beam,
And with the raines guides on this goodly teame,
To whom the Charites led on the way,
Aglaia, Thalia, and Euphrozine,
with princely crowns they in the triumph came,
Imbellished with Phoebes glorious name:
These forth before the mighty Goddess went,
As Princes Heralds in a Parliament.
And in their true consorted symphony,
Record sweet songs of Phoebes chastity;
Then followed on the Muses, sacred nine,
With the first number equally divine,
In Virgins white, whose lovely maiden brows,
Were crowned with tryumphant Laurel bows;
And on their garments painted out in glory,
Their offices and functions in a story,
Imblazoning the fury and conceit
Which on their sacred company awaite;
For none but these were suffered to aproch,
Or once come near to this celestial Coach,
But these two of the numbers, nine and three,
Which being od include an unity,
Into which number all things fitly fall,
And therefore named Theological:
And first composing of this number nine,
Which of all numbers is the most divine,
From orders of the Angels does arise,
Which be contained in three Hirarchies,
And each of these three Hirarchies in three,
The perfect form of true triplicity;
And of the Hirarchies I spoke of erst,
The glorious Epiphania is the first,
In which the hie celestial orders been,
Of Thrones, Chirrup, and the Ciraphin;
The second holds the mighty Principates,
The Dominations and the Potestates,
The Ephionia, the third Hirarchie,
Which Virtues Angels and Archangels be;
And thus by threes we aptly do define,
And do compose this sacred number nine,
Yet each of these nine orders grounded be,
Upon some one particularity,
Then as a Poet I might so infer,
An other order when I spoke of her.
From these the Muses only are derived,
Which of the Angels were in nine contrived;
These heauen-inspired Babes of memory,
Which by a like attracting Sympathy,
Apollos Prophets in their furies wrought,
And in their spirit inchaunting numbers taught,
To teach such as at Poesy repine,
That it is only heavenly and divine,
And manifest her intellectual parts,
Sucking the purest of the purest Arts;
And unto these as by a sweet consent,
The Sphery circles are equivalent,
From the first Moouer, and the starry heaven,
To glorious Phoebe lowest of the seven,
Which Jove in tunefull Diapazons framed,
Of heavenly Music of the Muses named,
To which the soul in her divinity,
By her Creator made of harmony,
Whilst she in frail and mortal flesh does live,
To her nine sundry offices do give,
Which offices united are in three,
Which like the orders of the Angels be,
Prefiguring thus by the number nine,
The soul, like to the Angels is divine:
And from these nines those Conquerers renowned,
Which with the wreaths of triumph often were crowned.
Which by their virtues gained the worthies name
First had this number added to their fame,
Not that the worthiest men were only nine,
But that the number of it self divine,
And as a perfect pattern of the rest,
Which by this holy number are expressed;
Nor Chivalry this title only gaynd;
But might as well by wisdom be obtaynd,
Nor in this number men alone included,
But unto women well might be aluded,
Could wit, could worlds, could times, could ages find,
This number of Elizas heavenly kind;
And those rare men which learning highly prized
By whom the Constellations were devised,
And by their favors learning highly graced,
For Orpheus harp nine stars in heaven placed:
This sacred number to declare thereby,
Her sweet consent and solid harmony,
And man's heroique voice, which does impart,
The thought conceived in the inward heart,
Her sweetness on nine Instruments does ground,
Else does she fail in true and perfect sound.
Now of this three in order to dispose,
Whose trynarie does justly nine compose.
First in the form of this triplicitie
Is shadowed that mighty Trinity,
Which still in steadfast unity remain,
And yet of three one Godhead do contain;
From this eternal living deity,
As by a heauen-inspired prophecy,
Diuinest Poets first derived these,
The fairest Graces Ioue-borne Charites;
And in this number Music first began,
The Lydian, Dorian, and the Phrigian,
Which rauishing in their soule-pleasing vain,
They made up seven in a higher strain;
And all those signs which Phoebus does ascend,
Before he bring his yearly course to end,
Their several natures mutually agree,
And do concur in this triplicitie;
And those interior senses with the rest,
Which properly pertain to man and Beast,
Nature herself in working so devised,
That in this number they should be comprised.
But to my tale I must return again,
Phoebe to Latmus thus conuayde her swayne,
Under a bushie Lawrells pleasing shade,
Amongst whose boughs the Birds sweet Music made,
Whose fragrant branch-imbosted Cannapy,
Was never pierst with Phoebus burning eye;
Yet never could this Paradise want light,
Elumin'd still with Phoebes glorious sight:
She laid Endimion on a grassy bed,
With summers Arras ritchly ouer-spred,
Where from her sacred Mantion next above,
She might descend and sport her with her love,
Which thirty years the Sheepheards safely kept,
Who in her bosom soft and soundly slept;
Yet as a dream he thought the time not long,
Remaining ever beautiful and young,
And what in vision there to him be fell,
My weary Muse some other time shall tell.
DEeare Collin, let my Muse excused be,
Which reudely thus presumes to sing by thee,
Although her strains be harsh untuned and ill,
Nor can attain to thy diuinest skill
And thou the sweet Museus of these times,
Pardon my rugged and vnfiled rymes,
Whose scarce invention is too mean and base,
When Delias glorious Muse does come in place.
And thou my Goldey which in Summer days,
Have feasted us with merry roundelayes,
And when my Muse scarce able was to fly,
Did imp her wings with thy sweet Poesy.
And you the heirs of everliving fame,
The worthy titles of a Poets name,
Whose skill and rarest excellence is such,
As spiteful Envy never yet durst tuch,
To your protection I this Poem send,
Which from proud Momus may my lines defend,
And if sweet maid thou deign'st to read this story,
Wherein thine eyes may view thy virtues glory,
Thou purest spark of Vesta's kindled fire,
Sweet Nymph of Ankor, crown of my desire,
The plot which for their pleasure heaven devised,
Where all the Muses be imparadis'd,
Where thou do live, there let all graces be,
Which want their grace if only wanting thee,
Let stormy winter never touch the Clyme,
But let it flourish as in Aprils prime,
Let sullen night, that soil nere ouer-cloud,
But in thy presence let the earth be proud,
If ever Nature of her work might boast,
Of thy perfection she may glory most,
To whom fair Phoebe has her how resigned,
Whose excellence does live in thee refined,
And that thy praise Time never should impair,
Has made my heart thy never moving Sphere.
Then if my Muse give life unto thy fame,
Thy virtues be the causers of the same.
And from thy Tomb some Oracle shall rise,
To whom all pens shall yearly sacrifice.
FINIS.
