A further Proclamation prohibiting the Exportation of Corn and Grain.
WHereas in pursuance of the many good Laws and Statutes heretofore made and
established, prohibiting the Exportation of Corn and Grain, We did by Our
Proclamation bearing date the thirteenth day of June now last past, for the
reasons therein expressed, prohibit and forbid the same. Nevertheless, We
are informed that notwithstanding Our former Proclamation, and the Orders since
made to that purpose, and all the care and strict courses which have been taken
by the Lords of Our Privy Council by Our special Command, to prevent the
Exportation of Corn into foreign parts in this time of Dearth, diverse
persons for their own private lucre and gain, have, and do presume to Export
the same: Wherefore We have thought fit once more, by, and with the advice of
the Lords and others of Our Privy Council, to publish and declare Our Royal
Will, Pleasure, and Command herein.

And We do hereby straightly charge, prohibit and command, That no person or
persons whatsoever, shall, or do from henceforth attempt, presume, or go
about to Transport, Export, or send away any Corn or Grain whatsoever, out of
this Our Realm of England, or Dommion of Wales, or from any the Ports, Havens,
or Creekes of the same, into any the parts beyond the Seas, until Our Royal
pleasure be further declared to the contrary, although the prices of such Corn
or Grain shall fall out to be under the rate limited by the Statute for
Transportation of Corn and Grain in that behalf, any former License, or
other Command whatsoever to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding, upon
pain of forfeiture of all such Corn and Grain so to be shipped to be
exported or transported contrary to Our Royal commandment herein expressed,
and also upon such further Pains, Penalties, Punishments, and Imprisonments,
as by any the Laws and Statutes of this Our Realm, or by Our Prerogative
Royal can or may be inflicted upon the offenders in this behalf.

And for the better execution of Our will and pleasure herein, We do hereby
straightly charge, will, require and command, all and singular Our Customers,
Comptrollers, Collectors, Searchers, Waiters, and all other the Officers and
ministers of all and every Our Custom-houses and Ports of this Our Kingdom,
that they and every of them, do not, upon pain of Our high indignation and
displeasure, and loss of their places and Offices, permit or suffer any Corn
or Grain to be shipped to be exported or transported as aforesaid, but shall
and will forthwith seize the same as forfeited to Us.

And for the better encouragement of all such as shall take care and pains to
make such discoueries, Our will and pleasure is, that every such person that
shall be the first discouerer of such offender, shall be rewarded with the
moitie, or one half of such Corn, or sums of money as shall come unto Us by
virtue of any forfeiture incurred upon this Our Proclamation. And We do
further hereby will and command, All Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and
other Officers and ministers within this Our Realm of England, and all other
person and persons, of what degree, quality or place soever, to whom it shall
appertain, to take notice of this Our Royal Command, and to see the same duly
observed, as they tender Our pleasure, and will avoid Our heavy indignation and
displeasure for the contrary.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the five and twentieth day of March, in the
sixth year of Our Reign.
