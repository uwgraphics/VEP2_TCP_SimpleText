To the Right Honorable CHARLES Earl of Derby, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties
Palatines of Cheshire and Lancashire, Chamberlain of CHESTER' And Lord of MAN
and the Isles.
MY LORD,
SInce I had the Honor to know your Lordship I have not been in Pain to Whom I
should Dedicate this Treatise, no Person being more Eminent to Whom I might
with less solicitation, or more Humanity approach than to your Lordship, Who
has that Felicity in your Nature as not to make Retiredness One of the
Essentials of your Greatness, but being clothed with Virtue dare own her
Natives as Allies and Acquaintance.

Hence I have presumed to Entrust (under your Auspicious Name) These eminent
Persons to Posterity, that They (being warmed by your Aspect) may survive the
Assaults and Injuries of Time and Oblivion.

Nor will it be otherwise than Justice in You to own Them; for besides their
Heroickness and Virtue, ( Qualities inherent to the Birth) the Catalogue
affords some from whose Loins you are immediately descended, so as in your own
Person to fulfill what They were but Types and Shadows of.

Besides the Interest of England much appears in the series of this Discourse;
and I know none to whom it is dearer, or more entire than your self, having
made Religion and Allegiance the Pillars of your Family, though your Repose
keeps you from the Fume as the Envy of the Court.

But that I may not wander from the great Motive, I must yet say my Obligations
to your Lordship, enjoins this Address, that amongst those Testimonies which
the grateful pay, This may remain an acknowledgment of his Devoir, who is

My Lord Your Lordships most obliged devoted humble Servant. Ed. Borlase.

To the Right Honorable DOROTHEA-HELLENA de Ruppaw COUNTESS DOWAGER OF DERBY.
MADAM,
SOme years since casting my Eye on a Catalogue of the Ministers of State, I
thought it a defect in History, that such Persons as had immediately born the
Supreme Office under their Sovereign, as the Governors of Ireland (than whom
none comes in State and Dignity, nearer the Confines of Majesty) should want
their just Register, imperfect ones (adulterated with other circumstances) I
have seen many. And there upon (though conscious of much Tenuity) I applied my
leisure to reduce their Succession to the present Age. But not being satisfied
with my endeavors (no more than with the late crude Efforts of others in this
kind) I suspended the Work till MDCLXXII. that the excellent Charles Earl of
Derby (your illustrious Lord) vouchsafed his Mecoenacie, on which I resumed
strength. But He being (that Year) unseasonably hewed down by many complicate
distempers (better born than evicted) I languished in the Combat, yet (after
some pause) having nothing to offer at his Shrine (to whom so much is due) but
what (before his death) was the oblation, I thought it ingratitude to withdraw
it, whilst I might presume on your countenance, ever ready to secure his
Indulgence and extend Yours, though after all ^ fear I have, with most Painters
drawn an excellent face to its disadvantage, the work being much maimed of what
I intended, some things in this Age being not safe to think of, much less to
publish. However (having traced the Succession of the Empire to the present) I
know not (on the score of having designed it for my Lord) whom to entitle it
more proper to, than to your self (his Relic) descended from a Noble
Progeny, clear in its Original, more by its sufferings in a Cause the State
and Supreme Council of this Kingdom once owned with all imaginable Zeal, it
being thought Infidelity and Cruelty, yea Improvidence and folly not to succor
it: and therefore you are the likelier, by a Sympathy, to countenance those,
who, by a series of Troubles, have waded through the Affronts of an unsettled
and subtle Nation, at whose Helm many of my Lords Ancestors have long sat. As
also those, and their Ancestors too, with whom your illustrious Son has
contracted the nearest and most honorable Alliance: so as this leads you to
their Merits, whose Effigies you have often reverenced in your Gallery, than
which I had nothing more solemn to offer, though this intrusion summons all
your Virtues to absolve

Madam, Your Ladyships most obliged humble Servant Ed. Borlase.

TO THE READER.
REader I have in this Treatise (of the Governors of Ireland) endeavored to
bring down their Succession to this present year, that you may see through how
many Channels the ticklish Government of that Kingdom has passed since the
first Conquest of it by Henry II. more then five hundred years: In a less
Circuit than which, the greatest Monarchs have felt a Change; so that if a
circumstance about a Name, the Title of a Person, the Day of his Admittance, or
the Year (in such variety of Alterations as that poor Kingdom has suffered) be
mistook, the Error may easily be excused. And yet my diligence (to avoid these
exceptions) has been such, that I have not omitted the best Counsel I could
consult with, ransacking the known and most approved Authors, though I have not
always Quoted them, conceiving that the distinguishing of their sense by the
change of Characters, the naming them a little before, or the mentioning at
first on what Subject this or that man writ tacitly implies where the Proof
may be had, accounting nothing more disingenious than not to own whence the
Treasure has been dug. Wherein my Task (indeed) might have been much
facilitated, would such (as long since promised an account of the Progress of
the whole War of Ireland) have contributed a Record to the Building. But they
(having passed over their time) bury their Talent. And had I (hereupon)
desisted, I might happily have consulted more my own Quietness, nothing (of
this nature) being ever exposed without Censure or Misapprehension sufficient
to deterr me: but so Hippolitus his scattered Pieces may be collected, I shall
hope some more fortunate Genius may hereafter infuse a life worthy their Merits
and Virtue.

Where the Chronicles and private Records failed me, the Irish Statutes (in
part) supplied the Defect; yet so as they only named such as have been
Governors under which Parliaments were holden, never reciting those to whom
(at other times) the Imperial Ensigns were committed; nor do they record the
Date of their Inauguration or Removal of those they mention. Yet the Irish
Statutes (as to many circumstances) afford much light, and I have not omitted
their Testimony, Records of Parliament being the best History; and though some
of them are exoluted in respect of the time for which they were calculated, yet
the Judicious may (as the Lord In his Dedicatory Epistle before the Statutes of
Ireland.
Bolton truly observes) Historically discern both the State of the Church and
Commonwealth therein: In as much as few Presidents of a well Modelled and
excellent Government can be found more rational and advantageous to the
Natives, or less partial (allowing the soverainty of England heretofore
somewhat jealous of a Conquered People) than those Laws are in their
Constitution and Sanctity, whereby the English as well as the Irish, the Lord
as the Kern is amesnable to the Law, and may be punished for any offense
whatsoever by the ordinary course of Common Justice.

All that I aim at herein, is to make good the Title which (in respect of the
Governors, who bear the Image of their Master, and every true English man's
Interest in the Conquest) deserves not less Registring than the Chancellors,
Bishops, Judges, Sheriffs, and other Officers of England, of which there are
particular Catalogues generally well accepted.

Some I confess (as Geraldus Cambrensis, Hoved. Mat. Par. Walsingham,
Holinshead, Hanmer, Campion, and others) have, as their matter lay made an
Essay at this Work. So, Reverend Camden crediting the Lord William Howard of
Nayworths MS. too easily, has attempted the same in his Annals of Ireland; yet
so scatteringly and confused, as if it were no great concern whether it were
reduced ad Vmbilicum. However I must own these in many things, though a direct
series of the Governors was never in a Body traced to the Present till now.
Nor did those (who aimed at this Work) ere touch on the Families from whence
they came, or (excepting a few) take notice of their Decease. In which
circumstances I have been a little curious, though the length of time since the
Conquest, the unacquaintedness with some Families lost in their Original, or
confused in their Branches; and the backwardness of others (as if there were an
obligation in it to inform one) has made me less certain than otherwise I
would have been: though generally most of these pass not without some Remark,
which I rather offer than impose.

And here I cannot well pass by this Epithet Chief, which some accustomarily
annex to the Governors of Ireland, if Justices or Justice, as if it were an
honorable or necessary distinguishment of them from others usually so called;
whereas Chief is properly applied to the Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, the
Common Pleas, or to the Chief Baron of the Exchequer, (others of the same Rank
being in competition with their Power) but not to these, they being Justices or
Justice not only in the Concreet but Abstract. So Philip Basset was said to be
Justitia Angliae. In whom the Sovereign Power (for the time) is lodged, without
need of additional Epithites to amplify or discriminate their Title. In
pursuance of which all Letters or Writs are directed to them from the King,
Justiciariis nostris, vel Justiciario suo Hiberniae. And in that Act the 33 of
Hen. VIII. which Authorizes the State of Ireland (at the Avoidance or Death of
the Kings Governor there) to choose an other in his room, it is Enacted that
they shall elect a Justice, but speaks nothing that he should be styled Chief
Justice, the superlativeness of his Power being in the Title Justice.

The vicissitude of Governors has been observed (by some) to be exceeding
prejudicial to the Public; private Respects often introducing notable change
in the State, according to their Interests (who governed) not the Publicks,
Diversi Imperatoribus C. Vel. Patere. p. 11.
mores, Diversa fuere studia. Sometimes to the Degenerating of the Old English
into the Irish Customs through their negligence and indulgence. Othertimes to
the alienating of the Irish by their severity, from the benefit of a well
tempered and orderly Government; both equally destructive to the Princes
service: And yet too long a Residence (in so eminent a Place) may over-heat a
great spirit, if not bounded with excellent Principles. Whence the Romans
(those great Masters of Government) rarely admitted their Vicegerents to brood
on a Province, that their continuance there might not create Self-Interest.

The longest time any continued in this Government (how honorable soever) was
never made up with happiness suitable to the anxiety of their Mind and Body.
Sir Henry Sidney (who left as clear a Fame as any man that enjoyed the place)
parted with it with the words of the Psalmist, When Israel came out of Egypt,
and the house of Jacob from a People of a strange language, Judah was his
Sanctuary and Israel his Dominion; intimating how little satisfaction could be
took in so slippery a Place amongst such a People whose Language he knew not,
and such variety of Interests, though the most (who have miscarried there) have
fallen through other men's Interests rather than their own failing.

What touches on the Person or Government of any, is not writ as a History of
their Times (this Work was no such attempt) only as a brief and honorable
mention of such as deserve the fairest Character. What is more, being rather to
difference this from a mere Catalogue, than to engage any in a History.

As to the late Insurrection in Ireland (touching which in the first Sessions
of Parliament after it brake forth there was hot disputes whether it should be
termed a Rebellion, or qualified more mildly, such Catilines were within the
House) I have revived nothing in Reproach, no, I wish the Inhumanity of that
Age may be forgot, as well as pardoned, though such as have had a deliverance
thence, and have the least sense (of what the Protestants and British suffered
in that sad and miserable time) cannot stifle their silence without Passion,
since some bold Pens have avowed that there were not above xvij. killed in the
beginning of that horrid Massacre: whereas such as will read Sir John Temples
History of the Beginnings and first Progress of the General Rebellion in
Ireland, Printed MDCXLVI. (a Book writ without Passion, on unquestionable
Proofs, by an honorable Person no ways interessed further than Truth and
Conscience engaged him) may there discover the Motion, Cruelties, and
Surprizals of that unhappy Insurrection dislodging (in few Weeks) one hundred
and forty thousand souls, which I glance at only Historically, that the
Serenity of the Present Times might be illustrated by the Ruggedness of those.
To which I should add something of the Cessation scarce by any (save his
Excellency) inviolably observed, but I am obliged to contract.

At first I intended not to have exceeded a Catalogue, but matter flowing in,
my Omer has filled an Ephah. Yet I have been abridged too, of what I thought
the Age might have born; however I do not much regret these Parings, it being
safer, Vt veritas quamquam Veter. Epist. 50. Hiber. Sylloge p. 118.
perutilis and desiderabilis, aliquamdiu suppressa lateat quam in lucem cum
majorum offensa praepropere pariter and Periculose prorumpat, all (as this)
writ without Periods or Cadences, that Truth, not Rhetoric, might be most
prevalent. In pursuit of which (that Time might pass over with some
cheerfulness) I have (with other things) interwoven the Original of the
University of Dublin, that that might not altogether sit neglected as a Sister
that had no Breasts.

Whatever this is, it was collected at Spare Hours, and so it may not be
thought writ in the Dark, the Reader will do Justice to allow it gathered under
the shadow of the Candle.

Farewell.

To his worthy and much honored Friend Upon his History, entitled, The
Reduction of IRELAND To the Crown of ENGLAND. A Pindarique Ode.
I.
IReland has long in darkness layn,
With Time and Ignorance o'rcast:
Time, like a swelling Flood, had past
O'r all the Land, and laid it waste:
The Deluge every day new ground did gain:
Scarce any Track or Footstep there,
Scarce could the Mountains tops appear.
From hence the Monster Ignorance arose,
Of such a dreadful shape, and Birth, as those,
Which Nilus leaves when it o'rflows.
Times sacred Relics its blind malice rent;
And its devouring rage o'r all the Kingdom went*
But you, Sir, like the God of your own Art,
Have slain this Monster with an happy Dart:
And now with undisturbed peace you go
Through all the Realm, and unto others show,
What former Ages never did know.
Ireland no longer barbarous seems, and rude;
Your fluent Pen ber Glory has renewed.
What strong Disease can now your Art withstand;
Since you have given new Life to an expiring Land?
II.
Her growing flame from the first Rise you trace,
When she did English manners first embrace;
And her old barbarous Customs leave.
When with her Chains she did good Laws receive.
And thus by being conquered gained more,
Then all her Victories did before.
Thus where the Roman conquered, 'twas his ^^re
To plant good Laws and Manners there;
That even his vanquished Foes might Laurels wear*
From hence with wondrous Art and Diligence you
Guide us through unknown Paths, and there display
What ere's remarkable in the way.
And in your Book we at one Prospect may
What was performed in many Ages view.
As Saints above (if Schoolmen tell us true)
In the Glass of the Trinity may see
The Affairs of the whole World to all Eternity.
III.
What a brave throng of Heroes you revive?
To whom a lasting Fame You give,
Which will the rage of Time out live.
They all the Irish Glory did increase,
Some by the Arts of War, and some of Peace,
Lo! how they all in triumph stand,
Upholding with their Arms the sinking Land?
They now, like Ghosts, in greater forms appear,
Then ere they had in all their grandeur here.
Now in more glorious Ornaments they shine;
And from you higher Honors have,
Then ere their Princes gave.
The narrow Bounds which did confine
Their former Glories, You out-go;
And to posterity their buried Trophi^s show.
Though Princes claim a faint Divinity;
Yet all they give must mortal be.
But to Your Heroes You a Pyramid raise,
By which they get immortal praise:
The Base so broad, the Top so high,
That all the Land o'rspreads, this reaches to the sky.
IV.
What a large share of Fame is won
By Sidney, Chichester, and Grandison?
Lo! How brave Mountjoy marches through the field,
And makes the astonished Rebels yield;
Covering the Kingdom with his shield?
With chained Foes his Chariot's compassed round,
And his exalted head with Laurel crowned.
But who can mention calmly Strafford's name,
The Nations Glory, and Her shame?
Lo! how he falls a sacrifice to assuage
The Peoples insolent Rage?
His Death his Princes Tragoedy does presage.
And for his Funeral fire the Kingdom's on a flame.
So when great Caesar fell, the People thought,
They could no more to slavery be brought.
But soon the Empire feels an heavier weight,
Crushed by the proud Trium-virate:
Till a young Caesar saved the expiring State.
How enviously the incensed Rout
Still pick the fairest Victims out?
Like thunder the low Cottage they pass by,
But strike down Towers and Trees, which touch the sky:
And even the Laurel cannot escape, if that be raised too high.
V.
Long did these Noble Persons bless
The stubborn Realm with peace and happiness:
When lo! new storms compass the Kingdom round,
And after a long calm an Earthquake rose;
Which Towns and Castles soon o'rthrows,
And with vast ruins covers all the ground.
Ireland now lost* her old Renown,
And poisonous Creatures raged in every Town:
Vipers in dreadful crowds did stand:
Which their own Mothers Bowels tore,
And wallowed in her gore.
Our Heroes soon rescued the perishing Land:
Their Conduct, Valor, and success
Their Enemies proud fury did repress.
Methinks amongst the rest I see
Your Noble Father crowned with Victory.
Lo! how he stops the rising flood,
And with his mighty Arms throws back the waves?
His Counsel and wise care the Kingdom saves,
Which else had been o'rwhelm'd with blood.
Where ever the loyal Troops were led,
With speed the trembling Rebel's fled:
Thus were their Ancestors the old Giants chac't,
When Jove did on their heads his thunder cast;
They threm their Mountains down, and ran away with haste.
VI.
What dismal clouds, what dreadful vengeance hovered
O'r this unhappy Realm, and covered
Her body o'r with blood and tears?
When her Sons armed with swords and spears,
Devoutly made Religion the pretense
To shake off all Obedience,
And even natural Innocence.
The Devil assumes the Prophets shape again,
And in a pious Garb deludes weak men.
His lying spirits through the Country went;
And with this new Divinity are sent.
Rebellion's but a name Fools to affright;
An Heretic to a Kingdom has no right:
They now for God against their King must fight.
Thus are the People armed with Zeal,
Whose edge is keener than the sharpest steel.
And first Plots and Conspiracies they contrive;
And then with open force for their Diana strive.
Their Zeal like Hell, was dark and hot;
And did as much torment the prey they got.
With thunder and with lightning they proclaim
Their Gospel, as the Jews received their Laws:
With Mahomet's zeal they advance their Cause,
And to convert the Land, they set it on a flame.
Your Father soon to stop their fury came:
Lest all the Land should be to ashes turned:
But whilst he quenched the fire, himself almost was burned.
VII.
Now the blessed smiles of Peace and Love,
All frowns and animosities remove.
Nothing is left behind of War,
But here and there an ugly skar.
Great Ormond was the Augustus, whose command
To perfect Loyalty and Peace reduced the Land.
Ormond, our great Apollo whose Renown
Did best deserve the Muses Crown.
Who rules in War and Peace with equal fame:
And all his faithful services justly claim
A loyal Subject's and true Patriot's Name.
Brave Essex in his Power succeeds,
Famed for his own and his great Fathers deeds.
Whose gallant Death and Actions do inspire
His soul with such Heroic fire,
As flamed in the young Graecian's breast when he
Did a famed Generals Statue see.
So well this Hero fills his Princes Throne,
That he deserves to rule a Kingdom of his own.
VIII.
Here, Sir, you stop, and now we may look back
On all the various Scenes you track:
Here we the Historians Art may justly praise;
And there the History may our wonder raise.
With truth, and eloquence you write:
Of Truth the strong Materials are made,
And the Foundation firmly laid:
On which a solid structure you erect,
Which is with Language aptly decked.
You neither are with fear nor flattery led;
But in the paths of truth severely tread.
Truth, which we often hate, and will not find,
Because with Interest and Envy we are blind.
As the damned spirits of Eternal Night
Dread the least Glimpse of Light.
And often Truth so hides her face,
That Errors we for Truth embrace,
And Truth in the dark seat of Error place.
So when a glorious Comet here
Does after various turns of Heaven appear;
The Wise know it is an harmless Star, but all
The long mistaken Vulgar call
This Star a Meteor, and its influence fear.
But when a flaming Meteor from a far
Falls down, the People then call it a Falling-star.

A DISCOURSE Introductive to the CATALOGUE of the Governors of IRELAND.
THe Rise and Growth of Kingdoms have been no less the Subject then the
Industry of the ablest Pens, yet their Original (after the strictest Inquiries)
have in most things been found so obscure, as if the dark side of the Cloud
were still toward us; no Nation being so meanly descended, but that they
something in their Temper which vaunts to be more ancient and noble then
others, thereby (as Sir Walter Rawleigh observes) thinking to glorify their
own Nations; hence their innate affections to their Country leaves Truths too
often dark and sullied to Posterity. Of which Spirit the Irish Chronicles
participate too much, yielding few Tracts of their Original (before the
Conquest by Henry the second) but what seems fabulous and vain: most of the
History of the Ancients, as well as their Philosophy, which (indeed) was their
Theology, being delivered to Posterity by no better then Bards

Sic honor and Nomen Divinis vatibus atque
Carminibus venit.
Hor. de Art. Poet. in as much as when I read their Chronicles, so many
absurdities appear, as I am in doubt whether I should take them for a Legend or
an History; to avoid which, I shall impose nothing but the plain Story on the
Reader.

It seems strange (scarce credible) that after so many years possession of
Ireland, any should dare question the right of England to that part of its just
Empire. And yet such have been the insinuations of some, whose spirits (like
the foaming Sea) are unwilling to be confined, that I have of late seen many
Queries started to enfeeble (if possible) this Right. And Walsh in his
Vindication of the Loyal Formulary, will tell you of one Mahony, a Jesuit, his
Apologetical Fol. 737.
Disputation, De jure regni Hiberniae pro Catholicis Hybernis adversos
Haereticos Anglos, maintains, that no King of England, nor Crown, nor People,
nor State of that Kingdom, had at any time any kind of right to the Kingdom of
Ireland, or any part thereof: with many other damnable positions, condemned to
be burnt by order of the National Congregation at Kilkenny: which if he had not
mentioned, might (happily) have been unknown to the Natives at this day, who
(forsooth) conceive themselves descended from a Progeny much injured by being
imposed on by the Laws and Customs of England; whereas nothing is more evident
then that Ireland was at first inhabited by the Britains, the Scythians, Goths,
Spaniards, Danes, and other Easterlings falling in afterward, as the
vicissitude of time administered opportunity; though if there had not been this
Title to the Dominion of Ireland, yet Conquest had been a sufficient one;
especially since it was at first undertook against a Nation merely Pirates,
Barbarous, and Inhumane against the Laws of Nature and Nations, which the Lord
Verulam (in his Considerations touching a War with Spain) as Grotius (in his
excellent Piece, De jure Belli and Pacis) notably well argues.

But Jephtes Plea to the Ammonites ^ustifies England (at this day,) the Bishop
of Romes own Proctors having not more to produce then Prescription, for their
Masters right to Rome it self; of which I should saymore, but though some
cherish other thoughts, ^ew (as the Scene now lies) have the Temerity to
enforce them.

No sooner was Ireland subjugated to the Imperial Crown of England (by a Colony
of Welsh under the conduct of Fitz-Stephen with Maurice Fitz-Gerard, Maurice de
Prendergast, principally commanded by Strongbow Earl of Pembroke, permitted by
King Henry the second, then in Aquitain, to adventure their fortunes but, they
succeeding, King Henry the Second (the third Year after the Invasion, viz. Anno
1172.) armed with Pope Adrians and Alexanders Bulls, lands on St. Luke^ Eve at
Croch near Waterford, marching by easy steps to Dublin (oppidu^ super Crates)
so obtains a Kingdom; though it has since appeared, that the Popes donation,
and the Irish submissions were but weak and fickle assurances to establish his
Dominions* Where having took the fealty o^ the Subject Kings, of the Country
and Clergy (who bear no little sway in most mutations) he there evidenced the
greatness of his mind in several Entertainments, and gracious condescentions;
and having settled the Peace of the Kingdom and the Order of the Church
according to England in a Synod at Cassel, he on Easter Day following, leaves
Ireland under a Constituted Government, which to this day continues in such an
esteem, as no Viceroy in Christendom ( Naples not excepted) ever arrived at so
signal a Grandeur, little of the Power (committed to the Governors) being
abated of their Sovereigns, unless in the conferring of some Offices, which (if
they be not at their bestowing) are frequently consented to on their
commending; nay, some of the Governors (as the Earl of Essex and others) had
it in their Commissions to pardon even Treason it self. That at this day we may
look on the Governors of Ireland, as armed with as ample Power as any Subject
is capable of. Parliaments being held under their Precedence with Statutes,
Ordinances and Acts passed, Coram Justitiario Deputato, or Locum tenente, such
or such an one, as they were entitled by the King, whom Camden in his Annals
1565. toward the end, says (until the time of Ed. 3.) they were called
Justices of Ireland, and their Lieutenant Deputies, though (by his good leave)
I find they were sometimes called Custodes, othertimes Generales Hiberniae
Procuratores, though when the King would seem to honor any with the greatest
Titles, he styles them Lieutenants; who have generally power to depute their
Deputy ( Venia a Rege prius impetrata) and yet then he that is so deputed, is
styled the Kings Deputy, as in the Irish Statutes the 28 of H. 8. Coram dilecto
and fideli suo Domino Leonardo Gray milite Domino GRAY DEPUTATO IPSIUS DOMINI
REGIS ac praecharissimi and dilectissimi consanguinei sui Henrici Ducis
Richmond and Somerset, de prosapia sua orti, Locum tenentis suae terrae and
Dominii sui Hiberniae. And in elder Ages we do find that the same Condescension
was also indulged, Justiciario Regis, as Prynn in his Fol. 353*
History of Edw. 1. where (writing to the Bishop of Waterford) he directs his
Letters to him, vel ejus Locum tenenti; as also fol. 382. and many other
places; but whether the one or the other, their power was for the most part of
like authority: and say others, Synonima. Magna certe Spel. Gloss. fol. 336.

carried, the service at the Table being sometimes on the Knee, they have power
also of Knighthood, and the very Liturgy is not without a particular Collect
(answerable to their Titles) for their Government and safety; their Council is
the Privy Council made up of some Bishops, more Lords, the principal Judges,
the Presidents of Connaught and Munster, the Master of the Rolls, the
Vice-Treasurer, Master of the Ordnance, the Secretary of State, and others as
the King is pleased to summon them to the Board.

In emergencies, or cases of more Fol. 346.
difficult nature, Dr. Heylyn in his Cosmography writes, they proceeded
sometimes in an Arbitrary way without formalities of Law; which has been much
decried by the Parliament begun at Dublin, 1639. and complained of as a
grievance; in as much as an honorable person (an eminent Instrument of State)
writing an History of the beginnings of the late Rebellion in Ireland (worthy
to be had in every man's eye) there takes occasion to tell, with what lenity the
present Governors addressed themselves to the abrogating of exorbitances of
Paper Petitions, or Bills in civil Causes exhibited at the Council Board, or
before any other by their Authority sufficient to evidence its dislike. And by
the 13. Article of the Peace agreed on at the Castle of Kilkenny, the 17 of
January 1648. it was concluded that the Council Table should contain it self
within its proper bounds, etc. and not intermeddle with common business that is
within the cognizance of the ordinary Courts; so sensible have all Times been
of what might entrench on the known Laws and Privileges. But leaving this, the
Authority of the Governors (without assuming Irregularities) is great; and
that they may be known, we shall here entrust their memory to Posterity.

1185. The King gave Ireland to his younger Son John (afterward King of
England, by the name of King John) and made him King of Ireland (writes Hoved.)
which as it Fol. 77.
is well observed by Sr. Peter Leceister in his Description of Ireland, I take
to be no more then constituit ^um Dominum Hiberniae; which is King in effect,
the Supreme Power being thereby employed, and from thence we see he assumed the
Title of Dominus Hiberniae afterward, which was declared to be as much as in
the future was comprehended in the Title of King, 33 H. 8. Whence Stat. Irel.

the Kings of Ireland (until the Statute before cited) were styled by the name
of Lords of Ireland, yet were they supreme and absolute Domini, and had a Royal
dominion and authority, else their Consorts could not have had Aurum Reginae.
And albeit there was such a grant to the Kings Son, yet by the Law the King by
his Letters Patents could not grant so Royal a Member of his Imperial style,
which happily the King being sensible of, takes with him into Normandy

whom Pope Urban commisit Legatiam in Hiberniam Hoved. Annals, Anno 1187.

absolute command of the Realm; and he continued his Government Hanmer out of
the Book of Hoth. p. 169.
to the second Year of Richard the First, if not so long afterward as Hanmer
would have him. Curcy, after having endeavored fifteen times to go for
Ireland, was still beaten back (as a judgment say the Historians, for his
impiety to Ardmagh Church) and then went into France and there died. He claimed
a privilege, after Fuller in his Worthies, p. 25.
his first obeisance to be forthwith covered in the Kings presence. The like I
find in Fullers Church P. 167.
History, granted by H. 8. and confirmed by Act of Parliament to Francis Brown
of Tollethorp in Rutlandshire Esquire, Ancestor of Robert Brown Head of the
Brownists, giving him leave to put on his Cap in the presence of the King or

fled into France, yet afterward the King was reconciled to him, and in process
of time he became (after the decease of Curcy) Earl of Vlster, where at Knock

The same Year (probably) William de Ross Prior of Kilmainam, was instituted
his Lieutenant.

1302. John Wogan (the second time) was made Lord Justice; during whose
Government the King issued out Letters to the Prelates and Clergy of Ireland
for a Subsidy pro salvatione Coronae nostrae regiae communique utilitate Cleri

The said John Wogan continued Justice til in August.

1308. The Lord William Bourk was made Lord Justice, or Custos, or Warden of
Ireland; from whom proceeded the Baron of Castle Conel and Letrim, besides
others of that Family, since eminently serviceable in the Wars of Ireland.

Eodem Anno Pierce de Gaveston (being banished out of England) was made Lord
Lieutenant, that his Exile might be the more sufferable, to whom the King
assigned the Commodities Royal of that Realm. He Davies of Ireland, fol. 85.
returned into England in June 1309. and afterward was beheaded by the Nobles
at Scarborough.

The same year Sir John Wogan was made Lord Justice again.

1312. Sir Edmund le Butler (who was made Deputy to Sir John Wogan:) He died
1321. So also did Sir John Wogan.

1314. Sir Theobald Lord de Verdon was made Lord Justice, who in die Sancti
Sylvestri venit in Hiberniam: of whose name Camd. in his History of Ireland,
writes that John Fol. 97. *
Lord Verdon was Constable of Ireland. Prynn in his History of Edw. 1. Fol. 366.
mentions one Theobald de Verdon Constable of Ireland, who constituted the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, then Chancellor, to present to all his Churches in
England, during his absence in Ireland. An Office (of late years) I do not find
bestowed on any, formerly of ample Jurisdiction in all concerns of Arms, both
as to what had been done abroad and at home, with whom often the Marshal (as
being of Affinity in Power) was joined. Of which you may see more in Stanlies
Case in the year 1557.

1314. Sir Edmund le Butler Lord Justice, created by Edw. 2. in the 9. year of
his Reign Earl of Carrick. Camd. Irel. fol. 82.
He received his Commission on Friday after St. Matthews day; whilst he was
Governor ( ann scil. 1316.) Edward Bruce, brother of Robert King of Scots, so
prevailed, as that he was Crowned King of Ireland, reigning a year, England at
that time (says Davies) not being able P. 85*
to send either men or money to save the Kingdom, only Sir Roger de Mortimer
made Justice, arrived at Youghal in Easter Week cum 38. milit. and

1317. The said Robert Mortimer Lord Justice fencing with what prudence he
could, at last the Lord John Burmingham was sent over General, who with Vernon,
Stapleton, and the Commons of Mead, etc. encountering him near Dundalk,
overthrew Spencer of Irel. fol. 13.

The same year, (to wit) October. 7. Alexander Bicknor Archbishop of Dublin, Lord
Justice.

1319. Sir Roger Mortimer returns out of England Lord Justice, who

1320. Going into England, Thomas Fitz John Earl of Kildare, is substituted in
his room. This Year Dublin is made an University, Papae Johannis XXII.
authoritate Alexander Bicknor Archbishop of Dublin, much furthering so
excellent a Design, the public place for whose exercise was St. Patricks
Church, allowed of to this day in their more solemn Commencements, caeterum
deficientibus facultatibus quibus alumni alerentur Academia ipsa paulatim
defecit; as others at Armagh, and Ross-Carbery, or Ross-Alithry had done
before, as since at Tradagh, Anno 5 Edw. 4. graced with the same Privileges as
Oxford, so Sir James De Antiq. Hib. p. 82.
Ware. Though in the reign of H. 7. there remained some Tracts of this
excellent Work, an Annual Salary to several Lecturers in Divinity, being duly
paid by virtue of what had been ordered in a Provincial Council held at Dublin
in Trinity Church, before Walter Fitz Simons Archbishop of Dublin. Since the
University of Dublin (of which in its own place we shall speak more) has been
favorably restored by Queen Elizabeth, March 3. anno MDXCI. from whence there
has shot forth many useful Lights in the Common Firmament; besides Dr. James
Usher Archbishop of Ardmagh, one of the greatest magnitude (for general
Learning and Piety) the last Ages can truly boast of; who was the first of the
Scholars admitted into the Queens Foundation, gradually proceeding according to
his years.

Yet though Ireland (for the succession of some Ages) was esteemed the School
of Literature, and the Mart of excellent manners. It is observable that very
few, if any, of the Natives ever flourished in England, either in the
Ecclesiastic or Civil State, though many English increased in much honor and
wealth there; which Fuller (in his Worthies, p. 67.) attributes to this, That
we love to live there where we may command, and they care not to live where
they must obey. Certainly the defect rests much in themselves, having been at
all times indulged on their Addresses, and are men of parts and capacities deep
as others. It Is true, There were some Acts made in Henry the 6. reign against
Irish men inhabiting here in England in the Universities, or being Heads or
Governors of any Hall or House, or to live in England without some previous
considerations. As it was decreed at a Council held at Cleonard in Ireland,
1163. Gelacius Archbishop of Ardmagh being President, Vt nullus deinceps ad
Theologiam public praelegendum Ware de Antiq. Hiber. lib. 15.
admitteretur, nisi qui Academiae Armachanae fuerit alumnus. Yet I believe this
was not the cause of those Statutes, but some more pressing occasion since,
which Time and a friendlier Education has long worn out; so as by an Act in
Ireland the 13 of King James, there is a Repeal of diverse Statutes concerning
the Natives, for as much as they and the Inhabitants, without difference and
distinction, were taken into his Majesty's gracious protection, and do now live
under one Law, as dutiful Subjects of our Sovereign Lord and Monarch, that
nothing now incapacitates them to be as growing and acceptable here as we are
there, but a deficiency in their application.

1321. John Birmingham Earl of Louth, (so created for his excellent service
against Bruce near Dundalk) Lord of Authenry was made Lord Justice. He was
treacherously murdered Marleb. fol. 211
by Macgohegan and other Irish men, 1329. with several of his Family at
Balybragan.

of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, and Chancellor of Ireland.

1329. Sir John Darcy, second time Lord Justice, who going for England deputes

1330. Prior Roger Outlaw hi^ Lieutenant Justice.

1331. Sir Anthony Lucy, not unlikely of Charle-cot in Warwick shire* a person
of great Authority in England, was sent over Lord Justice June 3. who
endeavored by a severe course (the Times requiring it) to reduce the
degenerate Nation to a more ready obedience. But staying not long (which some
impute as a principal cause of the unhappiness of that Kingdom) effected
little, as too frequent change o^ Governors often subjects forme^ Councils and
proceedings to a disadvantage.

1332. Sir John Darcy, the third time Lord Justice, arrived at Dubli^ February
13. He went into Scotland out of Ireland with an Army.

1333. And left in his stead as Lord Justice, Thomas de Burgh, a Clergy man,
then Treasurer of Ireland.

1337. Sir John Charleton Miles ^^ Baro, came Lord Justice in Festo ^alixti
Papae; but not behaving himself as it was expected, he was complained of by his
Brother Tho^as Charleton Chancellor of Ireland, and Bishop of Hereford, who

1338. Was made Justice, Custos, or Guardian of the Realm. He had been for a
time Treasurer of England, anno (sci.) 1329. He died Godw. de Praes. P 541.

cross Isle over against the Clock in Hereford Cathedral.

1340. Roger Outlaw Prior of Kilmainam, succeeded Charleton in the Government.
He died February 13. at Any in Comitatu Leinster; a^^ then the King by his
Letters Pate^^ in the 14 Year of his Reign, ma^^ John Darcy Justice for life.

1341. Sir John Morris (Dav^^^ calls him Sir William, oth^^^ Sir John) came

aliorum in Hiber^^, and was sworn, April 10. the ^^y following Vffords death.

1346. Sir John Morris came Lord Justice May 25. He summoned a Parliament at
Dublin, to which the ^arl of Desmond refused to come, ^^senting some
privileges newly ^^ken away, formerly granted to ^^m and his Ancestors,
raising there^^on such a dissension between the English of Blood and the
English of ^^rth, as he and the Earl of Kildare, ^ith the Citizens and
Burgesses of ^^e principal Towns, summoned a ^ouncil at Kilkenny, in opposition
^o the Parliament; but effected nothing more then some Articles against Maurice
the Justice, which vanished. He was put out by the King and

Sir Walter Birmingham was insttuted Lord Justice, and came into Ireland in
June, and was sworn Lord Justice the 19. of the same Month who going for
England

1348. Made John Archer Pri^^ of Kilmainam, his Deputy Justice.

1356. Sir Thomas Rokesby was again Lord Justice. He died the same year in the
Castle of Kilka. H^ was an excellent Governor: h^ held a Parliament at
Kilkenny, acting therein many Laws for reducing the English Colonies to their
Obedience. It is recorded of him, that he would eat in Wooden dishes, but pay
for his meat silver and gold.

1357. Sir Almarick de Sancta Amando (of which name and (for ought I can yet
read) of whose Family the Barons de Sancto Amand^ of Widehay in Berkshire are
probably Camd. Brit. fol. 283.
descended) Lord Justice; he returned into England, anno 1358 or 1359. when

1359. James Butler Earl of Ormond, son of Edmund Earl of Carrick was made Lord
Justice. He was Camd. Irel. fol. 82.

styled, The Noble Earl.

1360. The Earl of Ormond going into England, Maurice Fitz Thomas Earl of
Kildare was made Lord Justice, ut sequitur:

1361. Lionel Duke of Clarence (surnamed Antwerp, the place of his birth) third
son of Edw. 3. Earl of Vlster, and Lord of Connaght in right of his Wife
Elizabeth, daughter and heir of William de Burgo, came Lord Lieutenant into
Ireland, in octav. Nativitatis Mariae, with about 1500 men by the Pole,
accompanied with persons of great quality; whose pay for himself and them (
Davies in his P. 32.
Discourse of Ireland particularly expresses) too circumstantial for us to
insist on. His principal service was manifested in the well governing of his
Army, and in holding that famous Parliament at Kilkenny; wherein the extortion
of the Soldier, and the degenerate manner of the English, were by strict Laws
reformed. He died October 17. 1368. not at Venice, but at Langavil in Italy,
soon after he had married Violenta the Duke of Millains daughter; where they
feasted him so, as Dan. Hist. fol. 25^ Vinc. on Brook fol. 125.
shortly after he died, and was buried at Clare in Suffolk.

1364. Lionel Duke of Clarence went into England April 22. and left James Earl
of Ormond his Deputy Justice of Ireland, and December. 8. returned Lord
Lieutenant.

1365. The Duke of Clarence going into England, Sir Thomas Dal^ was left
Governor and Justice o^ Ireland.

1372. Sir Robert de Ashton o^ Ashton under Line in the County o^ Lancaster,
was made Lord Justice; a person of great account in this Kings reign, as being
Constable o^ Dover Castle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Admiral of the
Fleet from Thames mouth Westward, Lord Treasurer of England Annis 50 and 51

propitietur Deus. Amen. In the 44. of this Kings Reign (says my Lord Coke) in
the 46. (writes Rushw.) 1371/2. Sir Richard Fol. 523.
Pembridge alias Pembrugh, a Baron, was appointed Deputy of Ireland, but he
refused to go; whereupon his Offices, Fees, and Lands, which he held of the
King for life, being his Servant (as Warden of the Cinque Ports, etc.) were all
seized on pro servitio impendendo; yet he was no^ upon that resolution
committed t^ Prison; for that he being unwilling to go, the Employment was
adjudged an Exile, and no man by the Common Law is perdere patriam, but by
Authority of Parliament, Coke Instit. Part 2. fol. 47.

1374. Sir William de Windsor arrived at Waterford Lord Lieutenant April 18.
and took his Oath for the execution of his Place at Kilkenny May 4. following;
undertaking the Custody of Ireland for 11213l. 6s. 8a* but did no wonders. He
descende^ of Sir James de Windsor, Lord o^ Stanwel in Middlesex, as I
understand from the present Lord Windsor.

1376. James Butler Earl of Ormond, succeeded in the Government.

Sub RICHARDO II.
James Butler Earl of Ormond continued Lord Governor till that 1379. John de
Bromwich was made Lord Justice, to whom succeeded Edmund Mortimer, Lord
Lieutenant. He died at Cork 1381. on St Stephens day, in the Abbey of
Dominicans, York Title March, fol. 197.
and was buried at Wigmore.

1381. John Colton, Dean of S. Patricks by Dublin, Lord Chancellor of Ireland,
afterward Archbishop of Ardmagh, was made Lord Justice: He took his Oath at
Cork in the Covent of the Preaching Friars, December. 27. He died the 5. of the
Calends of May 1404. and was buried in Droghedagh in Saint Peter's Church, where
sometime before his death, he renounced his Prelacy.

1383. Philip de Courtney, Lord Lieutenant, and then

1385. Robert Vere, the ninth Earl of Oxford, a great Favorite of the Kings,
was made Lord Lieutenant, having been created Marquess of Dublin and Duke of
Ireland the 10 of Richard 2. in which year the King furnished him with a great
sum of Money, that he might go into Ireland to get Dominium quod sibi Rex
donaverat. So Walsingham. Sed novus iste insolitus and umbratilis Coke of

refer you. He died in Lovania, 1392. in great anguish of mind and penury;
leaving (says Camd.) nothing but to his Tomb Titles, and to the World matter
of Talk. He was buried at Colne in Essex, in great Funeral State, the King a
Mourner. After all his preparations and full Charter even to pass all things
with his own Test. He (as some others) bore only the Title of Lieutenant,
never going into Ireland, but deputed

1385. Sir John Stanley, his Lieutenant.

1387. Alexander de Balscot, alias Petit, Bishop of Mead, (who had been
Treasurer and Chancellor of Ireland,) Lord Justice. He died at Ardbracan (a
Village in Mead) the 10 of November 1400. and was buried Ware de Praes. Hib.
fol. 36.
at Trim in St. Mary's Monastery.

1389. Sir John Stanley (returning into Ireland) took his Oath of Lord Justice,
October. 25. the Earl of Oxford ( nomine) being Lord Lieutenant.

1392. James Earl of Ormond, Lord Justice; during whose Government the Earl of
Oxford (under whom he was Justice) died (as we have said) in Lovania; yet he
continued his Government, his Patent being from the King, not determining with
the Earl of Oxfords death.

1394. Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, (who afterward was
treacherously strangled) going with an Army for Ireland ( cujus Insulae judum
Rex creaverat eum Ducem) was suddenly recalled; and the same Walsing. Hypod.

year,

King Richard 2. (having been slighted by the Princes of Germany, to whom by
his Ambassadors he addressed himself to have been made Emperor) arrived at
Waterford October 2. with an Army of 4000 men at Arms, and 30000 Archers, the
better to convince them of his Manhood. But returned at Shrovetide, being
cheated by a feigned submission of the Irish. And Davies, p. 42. and forwards.
at his return he left

Roger Mortimer, Earl of March and Vlster, Lord of Wigmore, Trim, Clare, and
Connaght, Lord Lieutenant. He was afterward slain by O. Brien, etc. at Kenlis
in Ossory July 20. 1398. on whose death

1398. Roger Gray was chosen Lord Justice in his stead.

The same year Thomas Holland, Duke of Surrey, Earl of Kent, and Lord Wake,
half Brother to King R. 2. came to Dublin Lord Lieutenant October 7. He was in
1400. beheaded Vincent on Brook, fol. 528
for conspiring to set up King Richard 2. after King Henry 4. had been
established.

1399. King Richard the second time came into Ireland to revenge Mortimers
death, and arrived at Waterford June 1. upon whose arrival all things succeeded
prosperously; for the Irish being divided into many Factions, and they not
being united, the whole was sooner overcome. But in the height of these
proceedings, Tidings came of Henry Duke of Lancasters preparations and
proceedings in England. Upon which the King quieted all things (at a great
uncertainty) in Ireland, and having there imprisoned (in Trim Castle) the sons
of the Duke of Gloucester and Lancaster, he arrived (in three nights) at
Milford-haven in Wales, and thence marched forwards to his Ruin, yielding
himself up at Flint. At his disserting of Ireland we find not who was left
Governor. But the time not being long betwixt Duke Henry's being settled in the
Throne, and King Richard 2. coming out of Ireland, we may probably conjecture,
who commanded the Army, had also the Government of the Realm.

Sub HENRICO IV.
1399. Sir John Stanley was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland December. 10. Whilst
he thus possessed the Government, I find in Ware, De Fol. 271.
Praes. Hib. a Writ from H. 4. anno 1400. directed to Sir Thomas de Burgo
Knight, Justiciario suo in partibus Conaciae, ordering him to restore the
Temporalities to Thomas Bishop Alladensis. And here that it might not be
supposed that this Sir Thomas, entitled Justice, had thereby any other power
then a Justiceship of Peace, or at most (as we now call it) the Presidentship
of Connaght I could not but take notice hereof, not having met with the like
president; the usual Writs (for the restoring of Temporalities) being to the
chief Governor only, as Justiciario Regis, of which in Prynns History of King
John, H. 3. Ed. 1. are many Presidents.

1401. In May Sir John Stanley goes for England, and leaves Sir William Stanley
of Holton in Werral in Cheshire, in his place.

1401. August 23. Stephen Scroop, of which Family there was the Lord Scroop of
Bolton Castle in Richmondshire, arrived in Ireland, Deputy to Thomas of
Lancaster (the Kings Son.)

He came into Ireland November 13. the same year; who going for England about
November. 11.

1403. Left Stephen Scroop his Deputy; and he going for England the first day
of Lent, the Noblemen of Ireland chose

James Earl of Ormond Lord Justice, who died at Gauran (or Raligauran) 1405.
September 6. to whom succeeded

1405. Gerald Earl of Kildare.

1406. After Michaelmass Stephen Scroop returned into Ireland Deputy to Thomas
of Lancaster, Lord Lieutenant. He died at Tristle-Dermot, Jan. 16. 1408.

1407. Scroop going this Year into England, James Butler Earl of Ormond, son of
the former Earl, was elected by the Country, Lord Justice.

1408. Thomas of Lancaster the Kings Son, lands at Carlingford in Ireland
August 2. Lord Lieutenant. The third of the Ides of March following he returned
for England. Afterward ( viz.) March 22. 1421. S^^w.
he was slain at the Battle of Bangy by the Duke of Alanson. On his remove he
left

Thomas Butler Prior of Kilmainam his Deputy. During his Government ( viz. in
the tenth year of the King) Hen. 4. gave the Sword to the City of Dublin,
formerly governed by a Provost, as appears by their ancient Seal, called Signum
Praepositurae, which in the 14 of Hen. 3. was governed by a Major with two
Bailiffs, which Bailiffs were changed into Sheriffs by Charter of Ed. 6. Camp.
Hist. fol. 96.

Lieutenant. He died Jan. 6. following at Ardee. He was the Son of John the
Ancestor of the illustrious Family of the Stanleys, first created Earl of
Derby, Anno 1 H. 7. The transactions of whose Affairs in Ireland, were
preserved (with other evidences) in the Eagle Tower at Lathum in Lancashire,
till the Ruins of that magnificent Seat fell a Sacrifice to the Insolences of
the late Times, which the last Lord CHARLES (a person of exemplary worth and
humanity, who died December. 1. 1672.) has since raised up (with advantage) from
its Loyal Rubbish, 1671.

Upon Sir John Stanleys death the 11. of February following, Thomas Cranley
Archbishop of Dublin, twice Chancellor of Ireland, was elected Lord Justice.
Of whom Ware writes De Praes. Hib. 12. fol. 115.
that Vir fuit qui non modo ingenio verum etiam Calamo (utpote bonis instructus
Artibus) plurimum valuit; with which Elogie I may very well take up, but being
that he was buried in New College Chapel in Oxford, of which he had been the
first Warden, I may injure their Antiquities not to insert his Epitaph, which
so long they have admitted in their Sanctuary, though truly it neither bespeaks
his worth, or the least ingenuity of those Times. He was sometimes Chancellor
of Oxford. He died May 25. 1417. at Faringdon, and on a fair Stone in New
College Chapel inlaid with Brass, there is a Portraicture of a Bishop clothed
in his sacred Vestments, over whom there is placed the Arms of the Sea of
Dublin and his own, and under all this Inscription,

Clarence. One of the most learned and eloquent men in Christendom. Of whom I
may say what Pliny writes of Aristonis, Vt mihi non unus homo, Pliny Epist. p.
65.

videantur. So that in him more learning was struck off at one blow, than was

Sub HENRICO VII.
1485. Gerald Earl of Kildare was continued Deputy to the said Earl of Lincoln,
Lord Lieutenant. Whilst the Government was thus committed to Kildare, Lambert
Simnel (a Youth that carried a kind of fascination in his Countenance) was sent
thither out of the Burgundian Forge with a considerable Force under Martin
Swarth, a German, accompanied with the Earl of Lincoln, the Lord Lovel, and
other persons of Quality; who so smoothly carried their Design, as the Deputy,
the Chancellor, Treasurer of Ireland, and some of the Bishops (all friends to
the White Rose) conceived this Pretender to be the true Earl of Warwick, son of
George Duke of Clarence, rightful Heir to the Crown of England; and thereupon
had him solemnly Crowned in Christ Church Dublin, with a Crown taken off the
head of the Statue of the blessed Virgin Mary, who (on such occasions it seems)
takes it not ill to be divested of her Attire. Afterward that Idol, with its
accomplices, were defeated at Stokefield, and (which some account a notable
subtilty in H. 7.) our Deputy the Earl of Kildare, with all the Council were
not only pardoned, but continued in the same Government with Instructions Ware,

Suffragiis suis annuatim pendendum; an Argument the University formerly
established by Archbishop Bicknor 1320. was not wholly neglected. He died at

April, 1541. He held a Parliament at Drogedagh, which was repealed the 10 of H.
7. Stat. Irel. fol. 67.
because he had no power by his Commission to keep a Parliament; other causes
are alleged also. The Duke of Bedford died December. 21. Vincent on Brook, fol.

Council in England, designed Deputy, December. 13. and was sworn at Dublin not
long after. He held a Parliament at Drogedagh in the 10 of the King; wherein
(besides many Acts of notable importance) he passed an Act, That no Parliament
should be holden in Ireland until the Acts were first certified into England,
and thence returned with the Royal Assent under the Great Seal; which has been
the grand security of what the English has since enjoyed. Then also it was
enacted, That all the Statutes made in England to that time, should also be in
force in Ireland. So making (says my Lord Bacon) some compensation for the
meagreness of his Service in the War. Also there past an Act that the Lords of
Ireland should appear in the like Parliament Robes in the Parliament of
Ireland, as the English Lords are wont to wear in the Parliament of England.
Which some of them put on not with less regret than ours would their Trowses;

About Christmas following he went into England, where having discharged the
weightiest employment of his King with much integrity and honor, as he had
done here and in France, Scotland, and elsewhere, being a great Master of
Wisdom through long experience: he fell at last into this Kings displeasure,
his son ( ingenio florenti and eruditione magna traeditus) being accused, and
afterward beheaded for quartering King Idward the Confessors Arms with his,
though ex sententia faecialium; for which our Lieutenant (now Duke of Norfolk)
was also committed Prisoner to the Tower, though he had (says the Lord
Cherbury) eis much merit of ancient Service to plead for him, as any Subject of
his time could pretend to. He laya long time Prisoner there, at last was sent
against Wiat with an inconsiderable handful (made up for the greatest part) of
the Kings Guards; but not succeeding (having been ever before prosperous) laid
it much to heart, and being tossed to and fro betwixt the reciprocal Ebbs and
Fluxes of Fortune, died in Sept. Vincent on Brook, fol. 357

Cardinal Wolseys subtle means, ordered to be beheaded in the Tower, and the
Execution had certainly been done, had not the Lieutenant of the Tower
favoring Kildare, acquainted the King therewith; who not only respited his
death, but returned him with honor into Ireland, Cherb. H. 8. fol. 208.

1547. The said Sir Anthony St. Ledger continued Governor first under the title
of Lord Justice, the Deputy. He overcame the OBirns, etc. To him was sent from
England Sir Edward Billingham unus e nobilibus Secretioris Camer^ Regis, titulo

the Deputy: for which Service he was Knighted and made Marshal o^ Ireland.

1548. Sir Edward Billingham landed at Dalkie in the Vigils o^ Whitsontide, and
the second day after received the Sword in Trinity Church Dublin. Brian
O-Connar and Patrick O-More great Lords of ^^ix and Offaly, whom he had
formerly subdued, St. Ledger takes with him into England, to whom the King gives
a yearly Pension of 100l. ^ piece. O-More dies at London within the year, the
ensuing year Billingham being maligned by some ^f the Council, is called into
England, at whose departure the Council of Ireland offered him Commendatory
Letters; to which he replied, that Credo Resurrectionem ^^rtuorum, if my
innocence cannot protect me, subterfugies shall not do it; my Enemies may kill
me, but not conquer me. He died in England the year following, more of grief
than a disease, after that he had cleared himself of the accusation, and it was
resolved to have sent him again Deputy into Ireland. He was a fervent
Protestant and an excellent Governor, spending his whole allowance in
Hospitality, calling the So Camp. and the Writers of the last Ages.

Marshal of the Army, the King Favorite, Lord Justice during the Kings
pleasure, who in Christ Church Dublin was sworn December. 29. An^ Febr. 2. he
died at Clonmel, advancing against O-Carol, and was buried in the Cathedral
Church i^ Waterford in great State.

1549. February 2. Sir William Brabazon Vice Treasurer, was made Lord Justice
the third time; who effectually pursued Charles (Macart) Cavenach who of late
had flown again into Rebellion. Brabazon died the 7. of the Ides of July, in
the Tents in Vlster, and was buried in Trinity Church Dublin, and his Heart
carried into England.

1550. Sir Anthony St. Ledger, about September 10. arrived at Dub^^n the fourth
time Lord Deputy; ^^ whom Charles ( Mac-art) Cave^^ch submitted himself,
solemnly renouncing before him, the Council, ^^d many Lords, the name
Mac^urrogh. On the surrender of Bul^in to the French, they paid a considerable
sum, 8000 l. of which ^ame for Ireland, with 400 men, with a charge that the
Laws of England should be there administered, and the Mutinous severely
suppressed; Sir John Hayw. in the life of Edw. 6. p. 280.
and (says my Author) it may seem strange that among all the horrible Hurries
in England, Ireland was then almost quiet; which must be imputed either to the
Kings withdrawing much People thence, which otherwise would have disquieted
affairs at home; or else to his choice of Governors, whom neither the Nobility
disdained, nor the Inferiors were pressed to supply by violent courses.

1551. Sir James Crofts of Cro^^ Castle in Herefordshire, whose he (Herbert
Crofts) is the present Bishop of Hereford, 1673. unus Nob^lium Secretioris
Camerae Regis, Apr^ 29. was designed Deputy, but coming to Dublin whilst St.
Ledger wa^ in Munster, he received not the Sword till May 23. at Cork, when St.
Ledger then was. During his tim^ even this year, a King of Arms, Herald named
Vlster, was first instituted for Ireland, his Provinc^ was all Ireland; and the
first tha^ had it was Nicholas Narbon. The Liturgy in English was also this
yea^ printed in Dublin and injoined b^ Authority. Many memorable Act^ he did in
Ireland. He repaired the Castle of Belfast, and placed there ^ Garrison. Coming
for England h^ was certified by Sir Henry Knowls, that Mary Dowager of Scotland
had ^ent O-Connors son into Ireland to give encouragement to a new
Insurrection, which, by his prudence, deferring his Journey, he prevented
without noise, and took Ship for England at Houth, December. 4. 1552. He was in
the second year of Queen Mary, accused of Wiats Conspiracy, ^ut by the favor
of the King and Queen set at liberty from the Tower, and in Queen Eliz. Reign
made a Privy Counselor, Governor of Berwick, and Controller of the Queens
Court, and a Delegate at the Treaty of Bourbourg. He died at Whitehall, Camd.
writes about the year 1590. His heir that now is, says in the year 1595. or the
year following, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

1552. Sir Thomas Cusack of Cofington in Mead, Lord Chancellor, and Sir Gerald
Ailmere, Chief Justice, of the Kings Bench, December. 4^ were in Trinity Church

1557. Hugh Curwin of Westmoreland, Doctor of the Civil Law, Archbishop of
Dublin, Lord Chancellor, and Sir Henry Sidney Treasurer, December. 5. a Stanleio
Marescallo received the Sword as Justices. On which occasion it may not be
unseasonable to take notice of the eminent and honorable Office of Marshal, as
well as of this noble person to whom (of all others) this trust (of delivering
the Sword unto the Supreme Officers) was committed, properly it is a Military
office restraining as well the insolences of Soldiers as of Rebels, yet it
has power to try or determine all appeals made of things done out of the
Realm, as Piracy, the justice of Generals to Soldiers, etc. also it has
conuzance of contracts of Deeds of Arms, which cannot be determined by the
Common Law but the Civil only, secundum legem armorum, of which after sentence,
there lies no forfeiture of Lands, or corruption of Blood. By inheritance it
was seated in the Barons of Morley, anno 9. Reg. Joh. but how alienated I am
not certain, nor am I convinced that it is invested (though it be great) in
Ireland, as the Earls Marshals are honored with in England; a Title never
given to that Officer till the 20 of R. 2. that Thomas Maubrey Duke of Norfolk
had Earl affixed to his Title of Marshal. Though we find the use of it of great
consequence in Ireland, never committed but to Persons of Honor, under whom
(according to the occasions) there is one or two Provost Marshals limited by
instructions under the Great Seal of Ireland. Archbishop Curwin was afterward
translated to Oxford, where after one year he died at Swinbroch near Burford,
and there in the Parochial Church was buried, November. 1. 1568.

and so continued till that

1558. Thomas Radcliff Earl of Sussex, Viscount Fitz Walter, April 27. returned
out of England with 500 men, and was sworn Lord Deputy on Sunday May 1. in
Christ Church Dublin; doing that Year excellent Service against the Scots in
Vlster, and Donald O-Brien in Thoomond in September. He took Ship at Dalkie
with the Forces he brought out of England, and others raised at Dublin, and
went against Island Rachlin and the Islanders, and left

1558. Sir Henry Sidney his Deputy, who took the Oath of Lord Justice in Christ
Church Dublin on Sunday September 18. the same year

1558. Thomas Radcliff Earl of Sussex returning from his Scottish Expedition,
was again sworn Lord Deputy in Trinity Church Dublin, November. 10. where he gave
to the Chancellor Curwin a new Great Seal of Ireland, as also particular new
Seals to the principal Judges of other Courts.

absence in Ireland, Dr. John Whitgift Bishop of Worcester, afterward
Archbishop of Canterbury, was for two years and an half, Quamdiu nimirum

by the way we may take notice (of an Honor incident to the Clergy) that
besides this Reverend Prelate, several others of his Function have been in this
Office; and the first President of Wales was William Smith Bishop of Lincoln,
who continued in the Government from the 17 of H. 7. to the 4 of H. 8. at which
time he Godw. de Praes. Angl. p. 360.
died.

1559. Thomas Earl of Sussex, Knight. of the Garter, arrived at Bullock, August 27.
Lord Lieutenant, and Camd. Eliz. p. 43.
was sworn in Christ Church Dublin, August 30. having in charge strictly to
look to the Irish, who being a superstitious Nation, may easily be seduced to
Rebellion through the practices of the French (then at difference with England)
under praetext of Religion; before whom a Parliament was held at Dublin, Jan.
12. 2. Eliz. wherein Acts of great consequences were past; as the restoring to
the Crown the ancient Jurisdiction of the State Ecclesiastical and Spiritual,
and abolishing all foreign Power, repugnant to the same; also for the
Uniformity of the Common Prayer, for Consecrating of Bishops, and the Queens
Title to the Imperial Crown of Ireland, with Stat. Irel. fol. 259.
many others. After which he went for England, and

1559. Sir William Fitz Williams, Febr. 15. was sworn in Christ Church Dublin
Lord Justice; during whose Government ( viz. anno 1560.) Q. Elizabeth (amongst
the most commendable Actions of her Government) reduced Coin to its full value,
much debased through her Fathers excessive expense, and stamped for Ireland
Coin called Sterling, of which the shilling in Ireland passed for 12 d. and in
England 9 d. Yet (though affairs were carried thus honorably to her advantage)
in the Year 1601. the Lord Buckhurst (very skilful in Money matters) got her to
mingle Brass with the Money that she sent into Ireland, by reason that the War
in Ireland stood her Majesty yearly in 160000l sterling. which the Soldiers
suffered without mutiny, having a true Reverence for that Lady, though not
without loss, and in effect not much to her service, the Reputation of a Prince
being in nothing preserved more entire than in the just value of their Coin.
Hence it was that when the Earl of Leicester, Anno 1585. was sent into Holland,
one of this excellent Princesses charges to him was, to know by what Art they
enhanced or put down the value of their Money, (in which Art they excelled all
others) lest the Soldier should receive that at a higher rate than they could
put it off for. And to this effect Sir George Carew in his Letter to the
Council of England, mentioned in Pacata Hibernia, writes that it was impossible
to prevent a confusion in the State, if the People might not be put in some
certain hope that upon the end of the War the now Standard should be abolished
or eased.

1561. Thomas Earl of Sussex, Lord Lieutenant, arrived at Dublin, and was sworn
in Christ Church Dublin, June 25.

1561. Sir William Fitz Williams, Lord Justice, was sworn in Christ Church,
Jan. 22.

1562. Thomas Earl of Sussex, July 24. Lord Lieutenant; who amongst other
things did excellent Service in reducing the Irish Countries into Shires, and
placing therein Sheriffs and other Ministers of the Law, as Annaly in Leinster
he made a Shire, calling it the County of Longford, and the Province of
Connaght he divided into 6 Counties, viz. Clare (which contains all Thoomond)
Gallaway, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, and Leitrim. He died at his house at
Bermondsey in Southwark, June 9. 1583* and was honorably buried at New-Hall in
Essex July 9. following. At his departure from Ireland, having settled things in
excellent order,

1565. Sir Nicholas Arnold of the County of Gloucester Knight, May 25. was made
Lord Justice; to whom was assigned only a Garrison of 1596 Soldiers, with
which he kept peace, but gained nothing. Being recalled into England,
surrenders his Government

1565. To Sir Henry Sidney; who in the time of Queen Mary had been Judge and
Treasurer of Ireland, now President of Wales, Jan. 20. Lord Deputy; before whom
a Parliament was held at Dublin, Jan. 17. in the 11 of Eliz. many things being
acted therein greatly to the advantage of the State; and a Subsidy granted
considering the infinite masses of Treasure able to purchase a Kingdom, that
her most noble Progenitors, the famous Princes of England had exhausted for the
Governments Defense, and Preservation of them and her Majesty's Realm of
Ireland, largely Fol. 297.

Prorogations) Shane O-Neal was attainted, and the name extinguished. Fol. 309.
In which Act also the Kings ancient Fol. 315.
Titles to Ireland are recited. Thus having settled Affairs, he took Ship
toward England at Houth, October. 9. having with good success discomfited Shane
O-Neal, who after his return from England, where the Queen 1563. had graciously
received him into favor, he most treacherously went into Rebellion, and
affected the Title of King of Vlster. In the year of this Governors
admittance, he institutes Wareham St. Ledger first President of Mounster, with
an Assessor, two Lawyers and a Clerk; the same Government he also constituted
in Connaght.

1567. Dr. Weston, Lord Chancellor, and Sir Will. Fitz-Williams Treasurer at
War, October. 14. Lord Justices. Weston was thought a prudent and upright man,
for whom I find this Epitaph in St. Patricks Church Dublin on a Monument very
stately erected, principally in memory of the Relations of Richard Earl of
Cork; upon the uppermost seat of which, ^s Dr. Westons Effigies with this
Inscription:

Here lies interred the Body of that Reverend and Honorable Gentleman, Robert
Weston Esquire Doctor of the Civil and Canon Laws, Grandfather to the Lady
Katherine Countess of Cork, ^^ing sometimes one ^f the Lord Justices ^^
Ireland, and for ^^x years Lord Chancellor of the Realm. A small Coat of ARMS

having pacified several Rebellions, and that not with so much Rigor as
excellent Conduct having (at several times) been 1^ years Justice and Deputy of
Ireland so as that Kingdom is much indebted to him for his Wisdom and Valor*
He September. 12. 1578. took Boat a^ the Wood Key in Dublin for England; he died
at Worcester May 5. 1586. and was buried amongst his Ancestors at Penshurst: of
whom Dr. Powel in his Epistle to the Reader in his History of Wales, writes
that his Disposition was rather to seek after the Antiquities and the Weal
public of those Countries. He governed then to obtain Lands and Revenues
within the same, for I know not one foot of Land that he had either in Wales or
Ireland, cujus potentiam nemo sentit, nisi aut Levatione periculi aut
accessione Dignitatis, justly applicable to him, Vel. Pater. f. 109. He caused
the Irish Statutes to his time to be printed, Ware de Script. Hib. p. 136.
and sic ex umbra in solemn eduxit. And besides many other Monuments yet
surviving his equal and just Government, we must not let pass the Great Expense
and Care which he bestowed upon the Castle of Dublin, at first built, Anno
1213. by John Comin Archbishop of Dublin, a learned facetious and solid Person,
afterward beautified and enlarged by Sir Henry Sidney, in memory of whom,
Stanihurst (that Venerable Historian) has left these to Posterity:

Gesta libri referunt multorum clara virorum,
Laudis and in chartis stigmata fixa manent:
Verum Sidnaei lauds haec saxa loquuntur,
Nec jacet in Solis gloria tanta libris.
Si libri pereant, homines remanere valebunt,
Si pereant homines ligna manner queant;
Ligna si pereant, non ergo saxa peribunt,
Saxa si pereant tempore, tempus erit,
Si pereat tempus, minime consumitur aevum,
Quod cum principio, sed sine fine manet.
Dum libri florent, homines dum vivere possunt
Dum quoque cum lignis saxa manner valent,
Dum remanet tempus; dum denique remanet aevum,
Laus tua Sidnaei, digna perire nequit.
1578. Sir William Drury born at Bausted in Suffolk, of a Worshipful Family,
late Governor of Berwick, a man of great experience and integrity, who
September. 14. was sworn Lord Justice in Christ Church Dublin. He advanced
afterward against Desmond, but at Waterford 1579. he died. A man of approved
worth, having been trained up from his Youth in the exercise of War in France,
Scotland, and Ireland. After whose decease

1579. Sir Will. Pelham of Laughton in Sussex was made Lord Justice the 11 of
October; during whose short Government he constrained the Baron of Lixnaw to
yield, and besieged Carrigfoil in Kerry, kept by Jules an Italian, and some
Spaniards, entering at length by force the Castle, 1580.
atchieving besides many other things to his honor. He was afterward General
of the English Camd. Eliz. in this year 1586
Horse in the Low Countries, under whom, besides his own Countrymen, there were
Scots and Irish; and that the manner of their fighting may be clear, I shall
not think to impose much on the Reader, what incomparable Strada has registered

1580. Arthur Lord Gray Baron of Wilton, Knight of the Garter, arrived August
12. at Houth, and took the Oath of Lord Deputy in St. Patricks Church,
September 14. till then William Pelham Lord Justice, being not come up out of
Munster to Dublin to surrender the Sword to his Successor. Through the whole
course of his Actions he manifested himself a famous Warrior. In the Winter
this year about 700 Italians and Spaniards landed (through the favor of the
Season) at Smerwick in Kerry in Ireland unresisted, commanded by San-Joseph an
Italian, authorized by the Pope and the King of Spain to propagate the Roman
Religion; where they erected a Fort at Smerwick, naming it the Fort DEL-OR, but
were soon (even in four days) forced to cry for mercy, through the vigilance
and conduct of the Deputy, who put the Strangers to the Sword, the Irish he
hanged, Commanders of each side excepted, for that there were no^ in the
English Army, enough to keep every man a Prisoner, and that the Deputy expected
instantly to be assailed by the Rebels, and that there were no Barques ready to
Ship them immediately for Sea. In this doing as Henry 5. was forced to, after
he would have saved the Bourbon Battalion at Agincourt, for fear les^ the King
of Scicils appearing with new strength (even more then the Conquerors had to
guard their Prisoners) he should have been surprised without remedy. Which
extremity the Deputy was sorry to use, nor did his excuse easily please the
Queen, the Enemy having yielded on mercy. He died 1593 in much honor and
repute.

1582. Adam Loftus Lord Archbishop of Dublin, Lord Chancellor, and Sir Henry
Wallop alias Well-hop, Treasurer of the Army September 1. Lords Justices;
during whose Government Gerald Fitz Gerald, the In 1583.
^^ of that Family, Earl of Desmond, ^ho had raised frequent Rebellions, after
two years sculking in obscure ^laces, was by a Common Soldier ^^rprized, and
his head sent into England, where it was hung on a ^ole on London Bridge. Sir
Henry Camd. Anno citato.
^allop died in Dublin, and was buried in St. Patricks Church in an ^bscure
place under the Galleries; upon the late removing of which, on a plate of
Brass, was this Inscription found.

Near unto this place lies that worthy Knight, Sir HENRY WALLOP of Farly
Wallop in the County of Southampton in the Realm of England, who faithfully
served Queen ELIZABETH in this Kingdom as Vice Treasurer and Treasurer ^^ War,
by the space of 18 years and months, and was Lord Justice with in this Realm
jointly with the Lord Chancellor of this Realm almost by the space of two
years, in the years of our Lord God 1582, 1583* 1584. in which time the Wars ^^
Desmond were ended, and his hea^^ sent into England; besides many other weighty
causes committed to hi^ charge during his said service. H^ departed this life
the 14 day of April 1599. He was Son and Heir ^^ Sir Oliv. Wallop, Brother and
Hei^ of Sir John Wallop Knight of the most Honorable Order of Garter and
Lieutenant of the Castle and County Gujienes in France, Nephew and Heir of Sir
Robert Wallop Knight.

1584. Sir John Perrot Lord Deputy, arrived at Dalkie, June 9. and ^ook his
Oath in St. Patricks Church June 21. He held a Parliament at Dublin April 26.
in the 27. of Eliz. Stat. Irel. fol. 373.
He advanced the Reformation in establishing the great Compositi^^n of
Connaght, in reducing Vlster unto 7 Shires, viz. Ardmagh, Mona^an, Tyrone,
Colerain, Devegal, Fer^annagh, Davies., p. 256.
and Cavan. And by vesting in the Crown the Lands of Desmond and his Adherents
in Mun^^er, which he that has writ of his life thus comprehends, Pacificavit
Connaciam, Relaxavit Mediam, Subjugavit Vltoniam, Fregit Lageniam, Ligavit
Mononiam, Extirpavit Scotos, Refraenavit Anglos. Et his omnibus peraeque
Vectigal acquisivit Reginae. And after his Service in Ireland he was made a
Privy Counselor in England; yet being (it seems of somewhat too Resentive a
nature, was said to speak something dishonorable of the Queen, and thereupon
was tried, and by a Jury of 12 men pronounced guilty of Treason; yet being sick
died in the Tower of London, September. 1592. when the Queens anger being
qualified, there was great hopes of his pardon; though his Adversaries were of
the subtilest as well as the most honorable. He left the Character of a good
Governor, yet it is somewhat sharply imputed to him and his Successor Sir
William Fitz Williams, that they suffered the Irish to be trained up in the
knowledge of Arms, few (before their attaining that Science) being much more
able to subdue thousands of the Irish than afterward thrice the number of so
many English were able to encounter.

1588. Sir Willam Fitz Williams, June 30. Lord Deputy, was sworn in Christ
Church Dublin. Many excellent things he did, as raising a Composition in
Munster, and then in settling the Possessions both of the Lords and Tenants in
Monahan. Yet that Venus might not be without her Mole, he is accused of too
much rigor in enquiring after the Spoils and Wrecks at Sea, which happened on
some of the Invincible Navy being split in Ireland, and the ensuing War is laid
to his charge. Nor do I find that the Histories of those Times much acquit him,
the Irish though they have not Cloaks, will have Mantles for their coverings.
He carried it somewhat austerely, not accepting of his Commission till a
particular clause was inserted, that Walter Devoreux Earl of Essex should be
subject to his command; which (considering the illustrious quality of that
person) some thought might have been left indifferent. In his time the Queen
founded a College at Dublin, Anno 1591. a Concern which in Sir Henry Sidneys

now. She dedicated it to the Holy and Individual TRINITY, under this Title,

Which in the year 1320. was granted to the City by Pope John 22. at the
request of Alexander Bicknor alias Bignor, Archbishop of Dublin, mentioned in
the year 1320. failing for want of support till this B. Queen enlivened the
ashes. To which I must profess I owe a filial Reverence (not as one of the
Foundation, but of the Society) and in memory of her Prosperity reaching to
this Age. I must crave liberty to annex the Provosts though amongst Princes and
Great men. By these they live.

though One (for his Languages not the least in the Quire) has, since this
Prince of Learning's Decease, left out part of what he first published Vir
doctrina multifaria, modestia, omnibusque virtutibus conspicuus.
in acknowledgment of his assistance: whilst the unanimous Vote of the
incomparable and famous University of Oxford, (sufficient to rival Eterniry)
has left this on record:

Antiquitatis Primaevae peritissimus, Orthodoxae Religionis vindex (...),

Some years before his death, he was unwillingly put on an old Controversy
touching the Precedence of his See of Armagh and Dublin. A Controversy
entailed (as it seems) on the Successors of that See of Ware de Praes. Hib. f.
111.
Dublin, prosecuted in Archbishop Leches time, Almoner to Edw. 2. 1310. with
some animosity, but now argued only as to Right, not emulation, which (after
the effusion of much Learning) was desided on the Archbishop of Armagh's side.
And by an especial Letter from the King in the year 1634. he had (afterward
also given him the Precedence of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, with all which
he was nothing elated.

The Provosts, Presidents, of the COLLEGE OF DUBLIN.
THe first Provost of which College was Adam Lord Archbishop of Dublin,
formerly mentioned; whose Dimensions ^e cannot better take than from ^ir* James
Ware, and the Monuments De Praes. Hib.
^e le^t of his Mind and Grandeur, sufficiently expressed in the stately
Edifice he built at Rafarnham, leaving behind an ample Estate and a numerous
Progeny well provided for, of whom I shall say no more (having occasion to
speak of him amongst the Governors) than tha^ though he was a Prelate in
height and spirit agreeable enough to the dignity of his place, yet he esteemed
i^ no descention to be ushered by a Beadles Staff, that had a Crosier a^ his
service.

II. The second Provost upon the Archbishops resigning up of the Provostship
June 5. 1594. was by him and the Fellows, in whom the Election was seated by
the first Charter bearing date Mar. 11. 1591. placed on Mr. Walter Travers; who
too^ not his Oath till December. 6. 1595 He was bred up in Trinity College i^
Cambridge, a person of great abilities, betwixt whom and Mr. Hooke^ Minister of
the Temple, and he their Lecturer, there arose such animosities as engaged the
Court and others into strong Parties; so as (one writes) Travers was struck
dumb in the Temple, not for Infidelity but Indiscretion, both very learned. Mr.
Travers (on what account is uncertain, unless suspecting a Rebellion) returned
(after some years stay) unexpectedly into England; where he lived many years
obscurely, though in himself a shining light. He bequeathed ^at his death his
Books of the Oriental Tongues (in which he was singularly knowing) and 50 l.
worth of Plate to Sion College in London. After his departure

III. Mr. Henry Alvey of St. John's College in Cambridge, was chosen the third
Provost October. 8. to whom succeeded

IV. Mr. William Temple the fourth Provost, afterward Knighted, and made one
of the Masters of the Chancery in Ireland. A person of great Piety and
Learning, bred up in Kings College in Cambridge, from whence he was made
choice of by Sir Philip Sidney, (the Glory of the English Nobility) to attend
him in the Low Countries during his Government there. De quo quid and quantum
sibi augurabatur Britannia non facile dixerem, says Camd. After whose
unfortunate decease, a Noble Person engaged him in his service in England and
Ireland; which proving a rough and unhappy Scene, he retired to his private
Lair, till by the importunate solicitations of Doctor Usher late Lord Primate,
one who well knew how to judge of the merits of others, by the immensity of
worth in himself, prevailed with him to accept of the Provostship; which he did
1609. as an easy retreat out of the Noise and Troubles of the World. He lived
17 years in the Provostship, and finished his days there, in the 72 year of his
Age, and lies buried under a fair Stone in the Chapel belonging to the
College immediately before the Provosts Seat, leaving behind him many
Children, One at present an eminent person in the State of Ireland, who has
diverse Sons, some that have happily discharged (lately) the most active and
honorable employment in the greatest and weighty affairs of State with the
neighboring Allies, though he writes of himself, that at present he is wholly
useless to the Public, which may be his Repose not his Shame; and others that
attend his Majesty's Service at home, with singular reputation and advantage.
After his death

V. The fifth Provost was Mr. William Bedel, bred in Emanuel College in
Cambridge; so designed May 29. 1627. on a Letter writ by Sir Henry Wotton to
King Charles I. informing his Majesty that he hardly thought a fitter man for
that charge could have been propounded in his whole Kingdom, for singular
Erudition, Piety, and Conformity to the Rites of the Church of England, and
zeal to advance the Cause of God, wherein all his Travels abroad were not
obscure in the time of the Venetians Excommunication: no more then by his
Letter of Controversy afterward (in the highest Points betwixt us and Rome)
with Wadsworth the Jesuit, which shows him profoundly versed in the Fathers
and Schoolmen. Yet he was not sworn nor admitted till Aug. 16. following. He
was afterward Bishop of Kilmore. A person of very great worth and learning in
the Latin, Greek and Hebrew; witness his intimacy with Padre Paulo, whom he
took into his very soul, as well for his courage and constancy (both signal) in
defense of the English and that interest during the late Rebellion; when after
he was fallen into the hands of the Irish, and imprisoned at Claughouter Castle
in the County of Caven near Kilmore, where he died about the midst of March,
1641. ob funesta ea tempora and miserias quas pertulerat, and (according to his
Opinion against burial in Churches, being an admirer of Sir Henry Spelman, de
non temerandis Ecclesiis) he was interred in the Churchyard at Kilmore. There
succeeded him (on his Promotion to the Bishopric of Kilmore)

VI. The sixth Provost, Dr. Robert Usher, who was chosen in October 16. 29. and
admitted Provost January 4. following; on whom (dying at Pantabirsley in
Shropshire) in Dudelstons Church Chancel, there is this Epitaph,

Here lies the Body of that constant and faithful Preacher of Gods Word, the
Right Reverend Father in God ROBERT Lord Bishop of Kildare, Son of HENRY Lord
Primate of all Ireland, who died at Pantabirsley, September 7. Anno Dom. 1642.
On whose Promotion to the Bishopric of Kildare, the Provostship was void May
11. 1634. so as in the Register Book of the College there was a wide Hiatus
through the variety of subservient Governors, till

VII. Master William Chapel, B. D. bred up in Christ College in Cambridge,
afterward Dean of Cassels, had the care of the College committed to him by
his Majesty, but he was not actually sworn nor admitted till June 5. 1637. at
which time new Statutes were introduced by the then Archbishop of Canterbury
their Chancellor; not so favorable (as some thought) to the Natives as the
Piety of the first Founders intended them; or so indulgent to the Fellows and
former Visitors, as at first was allowed, the Provostship being made more
Sovereign, which some thought he made a sinister use of; in as much as upon the
Consequences thereon, Mr. Robert Bysse, an ingenious and solid Lawyer June 11.
1641. made an excellent Speech in the Upper House of Parliament at the delivery
of diverse Articles exhibited against him then Bishop of Cork and Ross, by the
Commons of the House of Parliament in Ireland; to which our Provost made a
Reply, which some thought not satisfactory, as the Scene then stood, yet
certainly the Exercises of the University were never stricter looked to, or
Discipline (if it were not too Ceremonious) better observed than in his time.
Only the Lecture which was set up for teaching Irish (whether through
Indulgence merely, or enjoined by Statute, I am uncertain) was after his
admission wholly waved; to which (whilst it was kept up) some diligently
resorted, the better to improve themselves for their future Employment in the
Country, that the Irish (finding men speak in their own Tongue, (...)) might be
the sooner won over to the Truth, no Nation being more tenacious or better
affected to their Language than themselves. And this Design had a good issue,
in as much as some of the English (preaching constantly in Irish) gained first
an acceptance of their Persons, then of their Doctrine. Truly a pious fraud!
For though by an Act in the 28 of H. 8. it was Ordered, That all who would
knowledge themselves his Highness true and faithful Subjects, should speak the
English Tongue. A policy commendable enough; yet considering how stiffly the
Natives were espoused to their own Speech, it could not seem otherwise than
Mercy to find an Expedient which might inform them of the Truth. Nor indeed was
it below the Majesty of an University ( licet rumpantur Momi) to cherish such a
condescension, since the communicating of Knowledge is the intent of Science.
Our Provost was a close Ramist, a notable Disputant, and one (who in his middle
Age) favored Mr. Perkins and that side. He was once (riding to Cork) overtook
by Sir William St. Ledger President of Munster, who had in his company the
Pseudo-Dean of Cork, with whom the President would needs have had Chapel to
have disputed, but as he was not forward, so he would not deny the
entertainment; which the Pseudo-Dean (understanding who Chapel was) refused,
for that the said Chapel had been accustomed to kill his Respondent; which he
spoke on an accident long before, happening at a Commencement in Cambridge
solemnized in the presence of King James, where Doctor Roberts of Trinity
College, being Respondent in St. Mary's, this Mr. Chapel opposed him so close
and subtilely that the Doctor (not being able to unloose the Arguments) fell
into a swounding in the Pulpit, so as the King (to hold up the Commencement)
undertook to maintain the Thesis: which Mr. Chapel (by his Syllogisms) pressed
so home, ut REX palam gratias ageret Deo, quod Opponens E I fuisset ^^bditus,
non alteri, alias potuisset in ^^spicionem adduci ne perinde Throno ^^^, atque
Cathedra submoveri debuis^^. In the beginning of the late Rebellion in Ireland,
he came for England, confining himself to a most retired life, which he
finished at Derby on Whitsunday 1649. not 1648. as Sir James Ware Registers it.
And at his Death meritted this Epitaph engraven on his Marble in Bilthorp in
Nottinghamshire.

He voluntarily resigned his Provost^^ip July 20. 1640. and on the first of
August following,

VIII. Mr. Richard Washington B. D. of University College in Oxford, was sworn
and admitted the eighth Provost; who soon after the Rebellion broke forth
retired into England, of whom I can give no farther account.

IX. Afterward Dr. Teate, a Native, educated in the College, one that had
been barbarously used by the Rebels, was licensed to live in the Provosts
Lodgings, and oversee the Scholars that were left; who so continued till, that
his Majesty's providence (in the darkness of those Times) committed the care of
the College on

X. Dr. Anthony Martin Bishop o^ Mead, educated in Emanuel College in
Cambridge, of whom Eyr in an Epistle to Dr. Usher 1607. p* 27. gives a just
account, both as to his Philosophy, and more polished Learning, being then to
be admitted into a Fellowship in the College, ut intra fines Hiberniae
generos^ juventus contineatur, neque extr^ Athenas vestras Romae, aut alibi
instituantur, etc. Is est qualis alii pl^rique videri tantum volunt and in
humaniori literatura and vitae integritat germanissimus certe Nathaneel sin^
fraud. He died Provost in Jun^ 1650. the Plague then raging, and was buried in
the Chapel belonging to the College. After his death Affairs being carried on
by another current,

XI. Mr. Samuel Winter, afterward Doctor (by a fair Diploma testified by
Doctor Henry Jones Vicechancellor, now Bishop of Mead and others) was thrust
into the Government by virtue of a Thing they called an Act of Parliament, anno
1649. giving the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland power thereby to place Governors,
Masters, etc. in the College of Dublin. How satisfactory, I will not say being
there are many rumors yet unreconciled. But in that stream he swame till the
King was most happily restored, and then (which we may account the IX.
legitimate Provost)

XII. Dr. Thomas Seel bred in the College, and born in Dublin, was chosen and
admitted Provost. A person in Morals and true Literature signally eminent, Dean
of St. Patricks, yet living, and may he long live to the benefit and honor of
that College! for many years the University was confined to this College;
since it has been enlarged by some adjacent Tenements, whereof (of late) one
is converted to a College of Physicians graced by his Majesty with many
Privileges, and the Mass-house in Back-lane, a fair Collegiate building, was
disposed of to the University of Dublin, a Rector and Scholars being placed in
it in the time of Chancellor Loftus and the Earl of Corkes being Justices; but
whether it so continues I am not certain, I hear it is alienated; certain I am
that the buildings of the College it self are of late much enlarged and
beautified. On this College King JAMES (besides a yearly Pension of 388 l. 15
s. English money out of the Exchequer) bestowed large Possessions in Vlster,
and by an Act for the settlement of the Kingdom of Ireland, Anno 1662. ^^is
provided, Fol. 71. That the provost of Trinity College near Dublin shall have
out of the forfeited Lands in the Archbishopric of Dublin, and his Successors
for ever, the sum of 300 l. per annum. Nor does the design for the propagating
of the extent of this University determine here, but in the same Act, Fol. 122.
It is further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Lord Lieutenant, or
other Chief Governor or Governors of this kingdom, for the time being, by,
and with the consent of the Privy Council, shall have full Power and Authority
to erect another College to be of the University of Dublin, to be called by
the Name of the KING'S College, and out of all and every the Lands, Tenements,
and Hereditamts, vested by this Act in his Majesty, and which shall be settled or
restored by virtue thereof, to raise a yearly allowance for ever, not exceeding
2000l. per annum, by an equal charge upon every thousand Acres, or lesser
Quantities proportionably, and therewith to endow the said College. Which said
College so as aforesaid to be erected, shall be settled, regulated, and
governed by such Laws and Statutes, Ordinances and Constitutions as his
Majesty, his Heirs, or Successors shall under his or their Great Seal of
England or Ireland declare or appoint.

After the inhumane and most execrable Rebellion had stopped all relief and
supply from the College, through the seizing on their Rents in Vlster, where
the chiefest of their Revenues lay, and that the Treasure of the College (all
but the sacred Utensils secured by a most Reverend hand) had been expended for
the Societies support, his Excellency the Marquess of Ormond then Lord
Lieutenant, truly commiserating the exigencies of the College, and having no
way else left possibly to succor them, Ordered the Remnant yet surviving,
being few and miserable, some relief out of the Common Stores, That whilst
Moses fought Aarons hands might be lifted up.

And here I must not omit that at the same time Sir Thomas Bodley Anno 1598.
bought Books for his Library at Oxford, one of the greatest Treasures in the
World, a stupendous work; Dr. Challoner and Mr. Usher his Son-in-Law,
afterward Lord Primate, were then in England, bestowing 1800 l. given by the
Officers of the Army for their Library to the College of Dublin; so that
though they had not the like Patrons, they were Coequal. Since, there has been
a fair addition by the access of Bishop Vshers Library bestowed on the
University, as the other was by the late Army. Quos Deputatus docuit (says
Caesar Williamson) primum Armorum usum, deinde Librorum; and much more very
elegantly he speaks in that Oration, concluding with Ptolomaeus Philadelphus's
Library in Alexandria, to which, Numero Lib^orum cedimus, virtute superamus.
Since, Sir Jerome Alexander, second Justice in the Common Pleas in Ireland, by
his last Testament has bestowed his Library of Law Books and others, upon the
College, with 100 l. for fitting a place for his Library. Also he bequeathed
500 l. in Money to be laid out in an additional Building to the same College,
to be called Alexanders Buildings. He also gave 24 l. real Estate per annum,
thus to be disposed of viz. 7 l. per annum to the Library Keeper, 20 s. yearly
for a Sermon on Christmas day, to be preached in the College in memory of
Gods mercy in sending his Son then to save Sinners, and the remainder to be
disposed of monthly, to such poor persons as the Provost and Seniour Fellows
shall think fit. The residue of his Estate he gave unto his Daughter Elizabeth
Alexander, provided she married no Irish man, or any related to that Interest;
if she did, or died without Issue, the whole Estate he settled on the College
of Dublin: that at this day many things conspire to advance that Foundation.

But to return to Sir William Fitz Williams Deputy, in whose time this happy
Work was effected; in memory of whom, his Arms on the Gate are left to
posterity. He descended from the Fitz Williams of Sprotsburg Knights, an
ancient Family Camd. Brit. fol. 690.
in Yorkshire, who in his own person had been long experienced in the Wars, he
was of an high and elated spirit, in as much as Walter Earl of Essex, 1573.
desiring to go into Vlster against the Rebels, was by this Governor much
opposed, lest the splendour of so great a man should eclipse his Honor. But the
Queen (constant to her own Election) would by no means gratify Fitz-Williams
in diverting the Earls Voyage, yet ordered he should take the Commission of his
Government from the Deputy; which (to testify the eminency of his Power) he
granted; by which he was Governor of Vlster, but after such Attendance, as the
reflection of it has made some Remarks very observable in our Deputies
Government. At length the Earl (discontented with those perfidious passages
which he found encouraged against him in Ireland) retired into England; where
Leicester (the better to overthrow him with Honor) got him sent back with the
vain Title of Earl Marshal of Ireland, where pining away with Grief and
Dysentery, (some write Poison) he died at Dublin, and was buried at Caermarden
in Wales, where he was born. A most excellent man (says Camd.) Vir certe
praecellens, in quo morum probitas cum natalium claritate certavit, quae tamen
Invidiae obsistere non poterant. Camd. Annal. Eliz. fol. 264.
in whom sweetness of manners contended with his Nobleness of Birth.

This Dysentery or Flux (so fatal to this worthy Person) is commonly termed the
Country Disease; and well it may, for it reigns no where so Epidemically as in
Ireland; tainting Strangers as well as Natives. But whether it proceeds from
the peculiar Disposition of the Air, Error in Diet, the laxity, and
waterishness of the Meat, or some Occult cause, no venomous Creature living
there to suck that which may be thought (in other Countries) well distributed
amongst reptitious Animals, I shall not determine, though each of these
circumstances may well conduce to its strength and vigor. Certain it is that
Regular Diet preserves most from the violence* and many from the Infection of
this Disease; yet as that which is thought very sovereign (besides those
particular applications due to several symptoms arising thence, viz. Gripings,
Tenesmus's, etc. which have their particular Cures, obvious to every knowing
Physician) I must say that the stronger Cordial Liquors, ( viz. Brandy,
Vsquebah, Treacle, and Mithridate Waters) are very proper; or the Electuaries
themselves, and the like; quorum particulae sum* activae, dum vasorum
splanchnicorum oscula facile subierint, humores exundaturos repellerent.
Judicially observed by Dr. Willis in his Pharmaceutice P. 122.
Rationalis; for that besides their Energie to make the Blood more lively, they
may also strengthen it to a Diaphoretick motion, whereby what is offensive to
the Blood (as ichorous and acid humors often irritating such extitial
expulsions) may thence be thrown off into the habit of the Body, so by a
Diaphoresis happily evert the Humor. Of late in extremity great use has been
made of Swines dung drank in a convenient vehicle. Nor is it a Medicine merely
Emperical, it having (from the nature of the Creature to eject it always moist)
an Anodine quality, highly conducing to dulcorate the Humor apt to ferment
with so much virulency, not to enlarge on other qualities wherewith it may be
thought to be endued. At his departure

1594. Sir William Russel, Youngest Son of Francis Earl of Bedford, August 11.
was made Lord Deputy; to whom Tir-Oen submitted himself, but as all submissions
of the Irish generally proved prejudicial to the ^^^te; it being observed by
Caesar Williamson, in the Epistle to his Oration on the Kings Coronation day,
that ex omnibus gentibus vix ullam ^^perias cui peccare and flere magis
na^^rale est. He soon fell into Rebel^ion, and the Deputy to strengthen his
ability in the management of the War, besought the Queen to assist him with
some able Soldiers. upon which Sir John Norris excellently skilled in Martial
Discipline, (contrary to the Deputies expectation) was sent over 1595. who much
wished for Baskervile. Tir-Oen upon Norris's arrival, fell to his old Artifice
of Complying, but was detected, and proclaimed Traitor, under the name of Hugh
O-Neal Son of Matthew Fathereugh, that is an Iron-Smith, the base born Son of
Con-O-Neal; at which time the Rebels Forces amounted to 1000 Horse, and 6280
Foot in Vlster and 2300 in Connaght, all at Tir-Oens beck; whereas before 80^
Foot and 300 Horse were esteemed on our side an invincible Army such mischief
arose by teaching them the use of Arms. Norris with what he brought over, and
those he took out of Dublin and other places, had fully as potent an Army yet
did little against Tir-Oen more then reduced him to a submission One Article of
Norris's Commission being to have the whole charge of the War, and Treat with
Tir-Oen as he pleased; which kindled ill Fires with the Deputy, that another
should be superinducted to so great a Charge; who leaving Norris to Vlster,
took care of the Affairs of the other Provinces, and happily managed them,
whilst no good effect came of the Truce with Tir-Oen. Which in the end so much
redounded to Norris's discontent, that Tir-Oen by his dissembling had nocked
him, that shortly after he died. A man certainly of great courage, 1597.
Nobly born, and had born ^reat Offices, as Colonel General of the English
under the States of the Low Countries, Marshal of the Army under the Earl of
Hohenlo, President of Munster, General of the Auxilia^y English in Britain in
France. Affairs through all Ireland, especially in the North, and Connaght
growing turbulent, Russel was recalled. and

1597. The Lord Buroughs, a man of a sharp wit and great courage, but scarce
initiated into the very Elements of War, was made Lord Deputy. He soon yet
marched into Vlster, and without any great resistance took Blakewater, but in
his full pathway to Victory he died in that Province, leaving the great desires
of him to the good and to the bad longer security. Up on his death

1597. Sir Thomas Norris Pres^dent of Munster, Son of Hen. Lord Norris of
Ricot, and Brother to Si^ John Norris, was October 30. chose^ Lord Justice; and
upon further Instructions from the Queen, confirmed therein. He died through
the neglect of a small wound.

1597. Adam Loftus Archbisho^ of Dublin, Lord Chancellor, an^ Sir Robert
Gardener Chief Justice were appointed Justices of Ireland and the Army was
committed to the Earl of Ormond, under the Title o^ Lieutenant General, in
whose tim^ the Fort of Blakewater was yielded up to the Rebels. After that
Marshal Bagnal and others were slai^ in the thickest of the Crowd. A Victory,
the like the Irish never gained since the English first set foot i^ Ireland.

1598. Robert Earl ROBERT DEVOREUX Earl of Essex, Earl Marshal of England, and
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Viscount Hereford, Baron Ferrars of Chartley, Lord
Bourchier and Lovain, Master of the Horse and Ordnance to Queen Elizabeth,
Knight of the Garter, one of her Majesty's Privy Council, and Chancellor of the
Universities of Cambridge and Dublin. XV. April, MDXCVIII.
of Essex, April 15. was made L. Lieutenant, Son of Walter Devoreux Earl of
Essex, that excellent and worthy person, who (for the Honor of his Country)
had freely spent much of his Estate in Ireland, formerly mentioned, but never
to be reflected on too often, whose Virtues streaming in his Son, the Queen
settled in this place. His Commission (with a plausible Policy) was dispatched
to prosecute or conclude the War, to pardon any offense of Treason, or any
thing against the Queen, even Tir-Oen himself; so that being furnished with
16000 Foot, and 1300 Horse, accompanied with many of the Prime Gentlemen of
England, he came into Ireland, but effected little; meeting much strange and
contrary advice in Council, so returned on the Queens resentment, and in the
year 1601. February 25. was beheaded within the Tower of London. Amongst others
that came to observe the Tragoedy, one (more eminent than the rest) got as near
to him as he could, well enough (as it was thought) satisfied in the Spectacle,
which escaped not a general Censure, He himself being being beheaded in the 16
of King James 1618. though a Person of great Parts and Abilities. The Earl was
a person singularly obliging, especially to Scholars and Soldiers; and if we
may believe Sir Henry Wotton, in his solemn Purposes of a firm and unshaken
Allegiance, Religion, and Fidelity, being inherent to his Nature, whose Actions
(says the Lord Bacon, were faults which the Law might term Contempts, yet they
might have deserved a Dispensation; his last inconsiderate Action deserving
^ather (in Charity) the Title of a Riot than of a Treason, he having ever aimed
at the Honor and Security of his Country. But what can be Camd. Eliz. Part 2.
p. 210.
sufficient against Envy managed by the subtilty of such as had charmed the
Ears of a jealous Princess? At his quitting the Government

1599. Adam Loftus Archbishop of Dublin, Lord Chancellor, and Sir George Carey
Treasurer at War, September 24. were left Lords Justices, Archbishop Loftus of
Swinshead in Yorkshire, died in his Palace of St. Sepulchers Dublin, April 5.
1605. and was buried in St. Patricks, after that he had sat 37 years, and
almost 8 months in the Bishopric. He was (as is formerly expressed) a
profitable Agent in procuring the Foundation of the College of Dublin, and
though a Bishop the first Honorary Master thereof.

1599. Sir Charles Blount Lord Mountjoy, Knight of the Garter (afterward by
King James made Earl of Devonshire, as descended from an Heir of Humphrey
Staffords Earl of Devonshire) was October 28. made Lord Lieutenant, but arrived
not in Ireland till Feb. 24. following, lodging that night at the Lord of
Houths, the next day he received the Sword at the Council Board; who so
effectually prosecuted the War against Tir-Oen, after the notable defeat given
to the Spanish Forces under Don Juan de Aquila, at Kinsale, Dec. 14. 1601.
where (says the Lord Bacon in his Treatise of a War with Spain) there appeared
no other difference between the Valor of the Irish Rebels and the Spaniards,
but that the one ran away before they were charged, and the other straight
after; that he brought Tir-Oen to a submission at Mellifont, and in him ended
that War which had cost the Crown of England so vast a sum 1198717 l. In which
service Camd. Append. to Eliz.
Sir George Carey (President of Munster, afterward Earl of Totness) was very
active; betwixt whom and the Lord Lieutenant (generally) there was a good
agreement, though once the Contest grew so high, as that the Lord Lieutenant
writ to the President that he would rather serve the Queen in Prison than in
Ireland, where any Soldiers should not march at his command. A difference
afterward well composed, though such as read Pacata Hibernia may soon find, at
whose Honor it most aims.

Sub JACOBO Rege.
1603. The said Lord Mountjoy continued for some time Lord Lieutenant; who
going for England, carried Tir-Oen with him; who was graciously received by the
King, and returned with Honors. Not long after he complotted however fresh
Rebellions; which being detected, and he proclaimed Traitor, he fled privately
into Normandy, 1607. thence to Flanders, then to Rome, where he lived on the
Popes allowance, became blind and died, 1616. His son was some years after
found strangled in his Bed at Brussels, Fowlis in his Hist. of Romish Treason.
and so ended this Race. The Earl of Devonshire (to whom so much is owing for
his excellent Service Vincent on Brook.
in Ireland) died October. 6. 1606. at the Savoy in the Strand, and was buried
(in great Pomp) in Westminster Abbey.

will stay
To all Posterities, and keep in mind
That glorious Art, which did a Kingdom save;
Kept the Crown whole, and made the Peace we have.
1603. Sir George Carey Treasurer at War, June 1. was made Lord Deputy; he in
the first year of his Majesty's Reign, made the first Sheriffs that ever served
in Tirone and Tirconnel, and shortly after sent Sir Edmund Relham Chief Baron,
and Sir John Davies Attorney General of Ireland, the first Justices of Assize
in those Countries, which were welcome to the Commons, though distasteful to the
Irish Davies of Irel. p. 264.
Lords.

1604. Sir Arthur Chichester, (a Gentleman who had done excellent Service in
the Wars of Ireland, giving therein frequent proofs of his Valor and Conduct)
was Febr. 3. made Lord Deputy. He established two new Circuits for Justices of
Assize, the one in Connaght; and the other in Munster; not but that formerly
there had been some established, but not for 200 years executed. Davies, p. 265.


1613. Dr. Thomas Jones Archbishop of Dublin, Lord Chancellor, and Sir Richard
Wingfield Marshal of Ireland, March 4. were constituted Lords Justices.

1614. Sir Arthur Chichester, now Lord of Belfast, July 27. was made Lord
Deputy. Who in the 11, 12, and 13. year of this King held a Parliament at
Dublin by several Prorogations, passing therein a Recognition of his Majesty's
Title to Ireland. An Act against Pirates, another for the Attaindor of Tir-Oen,
and an Act of Repeal of diverse Statutes concerning the Natives of Ireland; as
another of Oblivion, which more really subdued the Irish than all the Forces
formerly sent, for the Irish finding themselves thereby Subjects not Enemies,
as formerly they were distinguished, the whole Nation grew more in Love with
their Subjection to the Crown of England and the English Laws, than ever any
Force had reduced them to before; they being a Nation (says Sir John Davies)
that love equal and indifferent Justice, much contented with the Benefit and
Protection of the Law. Which (in that it was the Masterpiece and most excellent
part of the Work of Reformation, securing the Crown of England, by allowing the
British and Irish to grow up together into one Nation) I conceive it not
impertinent to give you a touch of; that it may be evident with what singular
affection (as well as prudence) the State of England aimed at the Interest of
the Natives, as well as the British. By which Act Ireland was indeed Reduced,
and not before, to the Imperial Crown of England; Union of Laws being the best
Cement of Affections; as farther may appear by the Act it self, Anno XI JACOBI,
Cap. V. Fol. 428.

Declaring, That the Natives of Irish blood (for their Hostility against the
English) were in several Statutes and Records, called Irish Enemies; and
accordingly abridged of the benefit of the Laws. Bot being now taken into his
Majesty's gracious Protection under One Law, as dutiful Subjects, to match and
freely commerce together, Those Laws of Difference and Distinction, were
wholely abrogated, and from that Session of Parliament utterly repealed.

At which time the Harp was first marshalled by King James with the Royal Arms
of Great Britain. Soon after (even in the 9 year of his Reign) he instituted
the Order of Baronets, upon which Sir Henry Spelman in his Glossary, has these
Brit. p. 76. *
Verses;

Ecce Baronettos florentis nomen Honoris
Indicat in Clypei front Cruenta Manus,
Non quod s^vi aliquid, aut strict^ fortiter Ense
Hostibus occisis gesserit ista Cohors*
Ne^ genus, aut virtus, meritum ve^ gratia Claros
Efficit, at Nummi O male sana fames!
Quinque notent digiti centenas quinque ferenda^
Mercandi pertium nominis esse libras.
Vilius at multi, dum cauponare R^^usant.
morantu^
Ex vera Geniti Nobilitate Vir^
Interea e caulis hic prorepit: Ille tabernis,
Et modo ^it Dominus, Qni modo servus erat.
And to keep the Order from swarming, the King confined it to the number of
200, and as their Issue should fail; their Order to cease; engaging for himself
and his Heirs, not to superinduct a New Order under another Name. But he that
will look how well the End of the Institution, and the Laws of it have been
observed, shall (to use Sir Richard In his Ch^^^. fol. 439.
Bakers words) perhaps find it to be here, as it was in the Order of St.
Michael in France; into which, at first, there were none admitted but Princes,
and eminent Persons, but afterward, all sorts of Men without any difference;
that it came almost to be doubted, whether the Dignity of the Order did more
grace the Persons, or the Meanness of the Persons disgrace the Order. In so
much, as with Camd. (in his Eliz. An. 1594.) I shall conclude with what a noble
French man said, The Chain of St. Michael was once a badge of Noble men, but
now a Collar for all Creatures. After his quitting Ireland he was sent
Ambassador to the Emperor of Germany, which he discharged with singular
Integrity and Honor. He died near the time that King James died, and was
buried at Belfast in Ireland. For whom some Friend (in a Table hung over his
Tomb) has expressed his Passion, but not our Deputies merit; for which we shall
omit the Poem, only give you what is inscribed on the Table.

Sacred to GOD and eternal MEMORY.
Sir Arthur Chichester Knight, Baron of Belfast, Lord High Treasurer of
Ireland, Governor of Carrigfergus, and of the Countries adjoining; descended
of the ancient and noble House of the Chichesters in the County of Devon, Son
of Sir John Chichester of Raleigh Knight, and of his Wife Gertrude Courtney*
Grandchild of Edward Chichester and of his Wife Elizabeth, Daughter of
Bourchier Earl of Bath, after the flight of the Earls of Tirone and Ter-Connel,
and other Arch Traitors their Accomplices, having suppressed Odoughertie, and
other Northern Rebels, and settled the Plantation of this Province of Ulster,
and well and happily governed this Kingdom in flourishing estate under JAMES
our King the space of xj years and more, whilst he was Lord Deputy and
Governor General thereof, retired himself into his Private Government, and
being mindful of his Mortality, represented unto him by the untimely death of
Arthur his Son, the only hope of his House; who lived not full two Months
after his Birth; as also of his Noble and Valiant Brother Sir John Chichester
Knight, late Sergeant Major of the Army in this Kingdom of Ireland, and the
Precedent Governor of this Town, has caused this Chapel to be repaired, and
this Vaul^ and Monument to be made and erected, as well in remembrance of them
whose Statues are expressed, and their Bodies interred, as also a resting place
for the Body of himself and his most dear and best beloved Wif^ the Noble and
Virtuous Lady Lettice, Eldest Daughter of Sir John Perrot Knight, sometime the
Worthy Deputy of this Kingdom; Which they hope shall rest here in peace until
the second coming of their crucified Redeemer, whom they mos^ constantly
believed then to behold with their bodily eyes, to their endless Blessedness
and everlasting Comfort.

Under the Crest,

En me triumphantem. Under the Arms,

Honor sequitur fugientem. Over the Quire Door in Christ Church Dublin there is
this erected to his Memory, at the repairing of the place;

The Right Honorable Arthur Chichester Baron of Belfast, and Lord High
Treasurer of Ireland, who took the Sword of State and Government of this
Kingdom the third of February 1604. and when he had been Lord Deputy and
governed with Justice 11 Years and odd Days, surrendered the Sword the 11 of
February 1616. to the then Lords Justices to his now great Honor and his
Majesty's approbation of his worth and merit.

1615. Doctor Thomas Jones Archbishop of Dublin, Lord Chancellor, and Sir John
Denham Knight, Lord Chief Justice of his Majesty's Chief Place, Febr. 11. were
constituted Lords Justices. Jones died at his Palace of S. Sepulchers Dublin,
April 10. 1619. when he had been Bishop W^r^ de Praes. Hib. fol. 121.
13 Years, 5 Months, and 2 Days* and was buried in St. Patricks; over whom I
find this Inscription;

Denham died, January* 6. 1638. anno aetatis 80. and lies buried in a noble
Monument in Egham in Surrey. Where is his Effigies rising out of his Coffin
with his Winding Sheet falling off, holding up his left hand, and his right
hand straight down. Over his left hand in the Tomb are these words, Futura
spero ut a peccatis in vita, sic a morte post vitam ut secund^ redeat primam
and ultimam in Christo resurrectionem ex omni part perfectam. Under his right
hand upon the side of the Coffin pointing to his Robes, only two words,
Praeterita Sperno, contemning the World and the glory of it. Further under his
Coffin he lies at length in his Judges Robes, and upon the edge of which
Compartment (under which the Dead are rising, with his own Effigies among the
rest) there is writ Ex Ossibus armati.

The Tomb is supported by two Pillars upon which stand two Angels, one on the
right hand with a Sith and Trumpet; and the other on the left, with a Book and
Trumpet, under either of which Pedestals there is Surge a Somnis. And then
round about the edge of the Tomb over his head is writ in Golden Letters (as
all the rest) Via, vita and resurrectio mea est per Jesum Christum ad aeternam
Beatitudinem cum sanctis. Over his Tomb are his Arms.

Over the Quire Door in Christ Church Dublin, likewise is this for Sir John
Denham.

The Honorable Sir John Denham Knight, Lord Chief Justice of his Majesty's
Chief Place, and one of the Lords Justices in this Kingdom in the Year 1616.
And in one of the Chapel Windows in Lincolns Inn, illustrated by the
indefatigable Antiquary Mr. Dugdale, I find this Registered;

Johannes Denham Miles, unus Baronum Curiae Scaccarii in Anglia, and quondam
Capitalis Baro Scaccarii in Hibernia, and unus Dominorum Justiciariorum in
Hibernia. Sir John Denham was the first that ever set up Customs in Ireland,
(not but that there were Laws for the same before) of which the first year was
made 500 l. but before his death which was about 22 years after, they were let
for 54000 l. per annum.

1616. Sir Oliver St. John, afterward Viscount Grandeson, who had done very
memorable Service at Kinsale, and other places, August 30. Lord Deputy. In
memory of whom, over the Quire Door in Christ Church Dublin, it is thus written;

The Right Honorable Sir Oliver St. John Knight, descended of the noble House
of the Lord St. John's of Bletso, Deputy General of Ireland, who took the Sword
of State and Government of this Kingdom into his hands August 30. 1616.

During his Government, Affairs were not carried on so happily in Ireland, but
several discontents arose daily in the Parliament assembled at Westminster,
especially in the House of Commons, who brake up with a Protestation much
resented by King James, 1621. in as much as several Members of Parliament were
committed, and Sir Dudley Diggs, Sir Tho. Crew, Sir Nath. Rich, and Sir James
Perrot, all active Commoners (for Punishment) were sent into Ireland, joined in
Commission with others under the Great Seal of England, for the Enquiry of
sundry matters concerning his Majesty's Service, as well in the Government
Ecclesiastical as Civil, as in point of his Revenue, and otherwise within that
Rushw. Hist. Collect. Fol. 55.
Kingdom, of whose account the Times were silent; nor do I find but by the Acts
that passed in this Governors time, and the Character that he left behind
Little, was justly to be inspected into. He lived afterward in great repute in
England, and died at Battersey, Anno Aetatis 70. December 29. 1630. for whom on
the North side of the Quire in Battersey Church, is this Inscription on a fair
Marble;

1622. Henry Carry Lord Viscount of Falkland in Scotland, born at Aldernam in
Hartfordshire, September 8. Lord Deputy.

Sub CAROLO I.
1625. The said Henry Viscount Falkland Lord Deputy; in whose time that
memorable Protestation made by the Bishops, published by Doctor Downham Bishop
of Londonderry in Christ Church Dublin, against Popery (every where extant) was
grateful; he carried himself very circumspect, and was in his own person mighty
obliging; but as a late Author observes, that an unruly Colt will fume and
chafe (though never switched nor spurred) merely because backed. In vindication
of whose equal and just Government, the Council of Ireland, Apr. 28. 1629.
assured his Majesty, that for the Insolence and Excrescence of the Popish
Clergy, and the outrageous Presumption of the unsettled Irish it was less curbed
by reason the Deputy and Council were somewhat limited concerning them, by late
Instructions, Letters, and Directions out of England; and that they did dare
affirm that the rest of the great Body (as to the Civil part thereof) was in
better order at that time then ever it was in the memory of man, as to the
execution of Justice and the freedom of Men's Persons and Estates (the present
charge of the Army excepted) and the advancement of the Revenues of the Crown,
the competent number of Bishops and other able and learned Ministers of the
Church of England, and that for 200 years last past, England had never been so
free of the charge of Ireland, as under this Government. Scrinia Sacra, p. 236.
After his quitting of Ireland, he lived very honorable in England, until by a
casualty he brake his Leg on a Stand in Theobalds Park, and soon after died
thereof, Anno 163.

1629. Sir Adam Loftus Lord Viscount Ely, Lord Chancellor, and Sir Richard
Boil Earl of Cork, Lord Treasurer, October 26. were sworn Lords Justices. In
their time the Fiction of St. Patricks Purgatory in Lough-Dirg was discovered
to be a mere Illusion, a little Cell hewed out of a Rock, no Confines of
Purgatory or Hell, though Priests made use of it to ensnare Pilgrims. In whose
time also (though none were less Favorers of the Papists then they) the Roman
Catholics ( viz. In his Reign of K. Charles I. fol. 116.
1633.) writes Hamond L' Estrange, began to rant it in Ireland, and to exercise
their Fancies (called Religion) so publicly as if they had gained a
Toleration; in as much as they said Mass frequently, till they were suppressed by
the Lords Justices, and 15 Houses (by direction of the Lords of the Council
from England) were seized on to the Kings use, and the Friars and Priests so
persecuted, as two hanged themselves in their own defense. Their principle
House in Backlane was disposed of to the University of Dublin, (formerly took
notice of) who placed a Rector and Scholars in it, maintaining a Weekly Lecture
there, which the Justices countenanced with their presence, though afterward
the House was otherwise disposed of. Yet Affairs of this nature, as well as
others, growing still irregular, the Romish Clergy too increasing to near
double the number of Reformed Believers, in as much as their Insolency aspired
to that height, as openly to erect an University in Dublin, in emulation, or
rather in defiance of the Kings College there. Of which the House of Commons
in England (ever tender of the Affairs of Ireland) took especial notice in
their first Ephemeris Parliamentar. fol. 210.
Remonstrance to the King 1628. that without control the Popish Religion in
Ireland, was openly professed and practiced in every part thereof, Popish
Jurisdiction being there generally exercised and avowed, Monasteries,
Nunneries, and other superstitious Houses newly erected, reedified and
replenished with men and women of several Orders, and in a plentiful manner
maintained in Dublin, and most of the great Towns, etc. Upon which Thomas Lord
Viscount Wentworth President of the North, was thought of as the fittest person
to balance those Differences. Sir Richard Boil Earl of Cork died at Youghal,
and was there buried, Anno 1643. near the Date, (if not on the Day) of the
Cessation concluded at Siggins-town, September 15. unwilling to survive what he
suspected might not be auspicious to the English, or conducible to the end for
which it was designed; wherein he prophesied not ill. He was a person for his
Abilities and Knowledge in the Affairs of the World eminently observable; in as
much as (though he was no Peer of England, yet) he was admitted to sit in the
Lords House upon the Woolsacks ut Consiliarius. And for all the Estate he
arrived at (which was the greatest in the memory of the last Age) none ever
taxed him with exorbitancies, but such as thought Princes had too little, and
Religious men not enough. In St. Patricks Church Dublin, there is a fair
Monument for him and his Relations. What concerns him is this,

Gods Providence is our Inheritance.
This Monument was erected for the Right Honorable Sir Richard Boil Knight,
Lord Boil, Baron of Youghal, Viscount of Dungarvan, Earl of Cork, A Title
rather of honor than Profit, having but 30 l. Fee from the Exchequer, the Vice
Treasurer or Treasurer at War having the chief emoluments of the Place, though
the Lord Treasurer carries the Staff and bears the dignity.
Lord High Treasurer of Ireland, of the Kings Privy Council of this Realm, and
one of the two Lords Justices for the Government of this Kingdom, in memory of
his most dear, virtuous and Religious Wife, the Lady Katherine, Countess of
Cork, and their Posterity; as also of her Grandfather Dr. Robert Weston
sometime Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and one of the Lords Justices for the
Government thereof: whose Daughter Alice Weston was married to Sir Geoffery
Fenton Knight. Principal Secretary of State in this Realm; and they had issue the
said Lady Katherine Countess of Cork, who lies here interred with her said
Father and Grandfather, whose Virtues she inherited on the Earth, and lies
here entombed with them. All expecting a joyful Resurrection. Obiit 10. die
Februarii, Anno 1629.

Just under the above, are diverse of their Children with the following
Inscription, The Issue of the Right Honorable Richard Lord Boil, Earl of
Cork, and the Lady Katherine his Wife, with the Arms of such of their Daughters
Husbands as are married.

Anno Dom. 1631

1633. Thomas Lord Viscount Wentworth, President of the North, was sworn Lord
Deputy July 25. One whose vast abilities the King had had due experience of,
therefore constitutes him in this Place. The year following he summoned a
Parliament at Dublin, who granted three Subsidies; by Virtue of which, and his
prudent management thereof, he paid an Arrear of 80000 l. due before his
Arrival, than which nothing (of his Masters Justice) could be more honorable
and obliging. No kind of Expense being more worthy a Prince, or like to
eternize him surer than what is paid to Posterity in right of their Ancestors.
And besides this, all Salaries, Civil and Military, were (through his prudent
management of those Subsidies and his Majesty's Revenue) paid without charge to
England, beyond what else he advanced to his Majesty's Purse. Who going for
England,

1636. Sir Adam Loftus Viscount Ely, Lord Chancellor, and Christopher Wansford
Master of the Rolls, July 3. were sworn Lords Justices. Viscount Ely died about
the beginning of the late Troubles in England, in Yorkshire, as I take it,
where he was born, and there was buried. He was a Person of a grave Presence,
and one that had long managed the Chancellorship in Ireland without offense,
till some private Interest made an Inspection into his carriage; yet (when a
very remarkable business came on the Stage) he waved making public Clamor the
subject of his Revenge.

1636. Thomas Lord Viscount Wentworth, etc. Nov. 23. Lord Deputy. During whose
time the notable Case of Tenures upon the Commission of Defective Titles came
to be argued by the Judges of Ireland; five of which were of opinion, that the
Letters Patents granted by King James in the IV year of his Reign, March 2.
were void in the whole, the Subject having contrary to the Authority given by
the Commission, obtained Letters Patents in fraud and deceit of the Crown, to
defeat the King of his Tenures in Capite, a principle Flower of his Crown, as
is fullyargued by Sir James Barry (Baron Barry) in the Case Printed at Dublin,
1637.
drawn up by him. Contrary to which, two Judges ( viz. Justice Mayart and
Justice Cressey) held that the Letters Patents were only void as to the Tenure,
which Opinion (amongst the generality) begat a reverence of the later Judges
almost incredible; especially after it was decreed at the Council Board July
13. 1637. that all Tenures (other than by Knights Service in Capite) were void
in the whole, and therefore disannulled whatever Estates had otherwise past in
the Counties of Roscomman, Slygo, Mayo, Galloway, or the County of the Town of
Gallway; yet after all (when it had cost his Majesty much in fining Offices)
none of these Lands were ever alienated from the pretenders to them. Afterward
the Lord Deputy going for England, the North of Ireland being sufficiently
secured against the Scots, at that time somewhat suspected.

1639. Robert Lord Dillon of Kilkenney West, and Christopher Wansford Master of
the Rolls, September 12. were sworn Lords Justices; In whose time a Parliament
was summoned at Dublin, but more than meet did little, in expectation of

1639. Thomas Ld Viscount Wentworth, some Months before made Earl of
Strafford, then constituted Lord Lieutenant, for that as his Patent runs,
Obsequium suum and industriam nobis aegregie probaverit dum Officium Deputatus
nostri in Regno nostro Hiberniae, and Praefecturam generalem exercitus nostri
ibidem conscripti fide summa administravit, resque nostras illius regni ea
Prudentia ordinaverit ut nostro honori, saluti, Ecclesiae populoque universo,
optime Consulerit. He arrived at Dublin March 18. and the next day received the
Sword at the Council Table. After which he appeared in Parliament, who granted
four entire Subsidies for that (as it is in the Preamble of the Statute) being
moved Anno 16 Car. Reg.
thereunto by sundry great causes of joy and comfort; particularly in providing
and placing over us so just, wise, vigilant, and profitable a Governor as the
Right Honorable Sir Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, Lord Lieutenant of
this your said Kingdom of Ireland, President of your Majesty's Council,
established in the North parts of your said Kingdom of England, One of your
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council of the said Kingdom. Who by his great
care and travel of body and mind, sincere and upright Administration of Justice
without Partiality, increase of your Majesty's Revenues without the least hurt
or grievance to any of your wel-disposed and loving Subjects: And our great
comforts and security by the large and ample benefits which we have received,
and hope to receive from your Majesty's Commission of Grace for remedy of
Defective Titles, procured hither by his Lordship from your Sacred Majesty. His
Lordships great care and pains in Restoration of the Church, the Reinforcement
of your Army within this Kingdom, and ordering the same with such singular and
good Discipline, as that it is now become a great comfort, stay and security to
this your whole Kingdom, which before had an Army rather in name than
substance: His support of your Majesty's wholesome Laws here established; his
encouragement to your Judges, and other good Officers, Ministers, and
Dispensers of your Laws in the due and sincere Administration of Justice: his
necessary and just strictness for the execution thereof, his due punishment of
the contemners of the same, and his care to relieve and redress the Poor and
oppressed. For this your tender care over us, showed by the deputing and
supporting of so good a Governor, etc. We in free Recognition of your great
goodness toward us, do for the Alleviation of some part of your Majesty's said
inestimable charges, most humbly and freely offer to your Majesty, etc. four
entire Subsidies, etc. Upon the reputation of which, the Earl of Strafford
raised 8000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, additional to the Veterane Forces. And so
having expedited his Majesty's Affairs there, he hasted into England; where
after a Trial before his Peers in Westminster Hall, (a Scene more magnificent
than History can Parallel) he was on the pretended hate of the whole Empire,
condemned by Bill of Attaindor. Et si accusatus non minus acriter quam
fideliter Defensus, varias sententias habuit plures tamen quasi mitiores. Since
which, that Act, with all the circumstances of it, was repealed, Anno 14 Caroli
secundi, worthy often perusal, having in it the state of the whole business;
and the same act that condemned him also secured, that his Death should not be
a president for the like. He was beheaded on Tower Hill, May 12. 1641. Quem
Ille (as it was said of Momoransis) supremum casum fortiter juxta and Religiose
tulit. For whom there are several Epitaphs, but that of his Majesty in his
incomparable Meditations will survive Brass or Marble:

I look (says his Majesty) upon my Lord of Strafford, as a Gentleman whose
abilities might make a Prince rather afraid than ashamed in the greatest
Affairs of State. Some few days after the Earl of Strafford was beheaded,
Robert Earl of Leicester (Grandson of Sir Henry Sidney that excellent
Governor) was nominated Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. A Person acceptable on all
accounts, having never been engaged in the public Current of the Times, a
virtue very remarkable, but often employed on the noblest Embassies abroad and
at home, whereby he was a fit Instrument to serve his Prince in so eminent an
employment on the loss of such a Minister of State as the Earl of Strafford,
who by his knowledge in Martial Affairs, and other his great Abilities, would
have been no doubt (as Sir Benjamin Rudyard observed) Diurnal Occurrences, p.
355.
abundantly capable to have reduced the Irish to a due Obedience. But though he
had sent over Servants and much Furniture into Ireland, and lay a long time at
Chester for a dispatch, he yet never came into Ireland, much to the Regret of
many that wished well to that Service; though part of the Arrears of his
Entertainment there, are of late secured by the Act of Settlement in Ireland.

1640. Christopher Wansford, Master of the Rolls, took the Oath of Lord Deputy
April 3. and died suddenly December. 3. following, passionately (as it was
thought) affected with the imprisonment of the Earl of Strafford, whose
intimacy had been of ancient date. Nor were his apprehensions the less, for
that not long before (the Parliament sitting at Dublin) some Instructions were
agreed on by the House of Commons, (for a Committee to be sent into England)
which reflecting on the Earl of Strafford, he caused (as it was generally
reported) to be razed out of the Journal Book. An example of which he had
observed in the 19 year of King James, Anno 1621. when the Protestation of the
House of Commons was defaced by the Kings own hand, and enjoined the Agents
(then appointed) not to repair to the Court without the Kings License; which
(notwithstanding) they did, some from one Port some from another. He was buried
in Christ Church Dublin. A Gentleman certainly of excellent Parts, a clear
Orator, and One regained from the Popular Party of the House of Commons in
England, to serve his Prince in the Secrets of State. On his death

1640. Robert Lord Dillon of Kilkenny-West, and Sir William Parsons Knight and
Baronnet, Master of the Court of Wards, December. 30. were sworn Lords Justices.
But the Lord Dillon, a person of great abilities and a shrewd reach, well
esteemed of by the Earl of Strafford, being excepted against by some of the
Irish Committee of Parliament then in England, he was displaced. Yet that no
business for the advantage of Ireland might be delayed through the
misdirections of Orders from his Majesty; he was pleased by his Letters January
4. in the 16 year of his Reign, directed to his Privy Council in Ireland, and
to Sir William Parsons and Sir John Borlase Knights, then designed to be his
Justices of that his Kingdom, to grant (amongst other things) that his
Subsidies there should be reduced to a lesser rate than formerly; and that all
Letters directed to the Lieutenant, Deputy, Justices, Chief Governor or
Governors, or to any other Officers or Ministers of that Realm, either
concerning the Public Affairs or private Interests of any Subject there, might
be entered into his Signet Office in England, to the end that they may be (upon
occasion) found to take Copies of for the Subjects better Information in such
public things as may concern them; as also that all Dispatches from Ireland
should safely be kept apart, that like recourse may be had to them for the
better satisfaction of the Subject who shall be concerned therein. And whereas
in the former Governors time there were endeavors to hinder some Agents of
Parliament to have recourse into England, his Majesty takes notice that for as
much as the Committee of the Parliament of Ireland, John Bellew Esquire, and
Oliver Cassel, with others employed thence, have repaired into his Kingdom of
England to represent their Grievances, he has manifested his gracious
condescentions to them, admitting them into his Royal Presence, forbidding his
Counselors in Ireland, or any other Officers or Ministers of that State to
proceed any wise against them or any of them for the same; and that any of his
Subjects shall have Copies of Records, Certificates, Orders of Council, public
Letters, or other Entries for the Declaration of their* Grievances made, so
open was his breast to the Complaints presented to him from the Parliament in
Ireland, that if there had not been a general Defection long anvilled in the
minds of that People, the event of so horrid a Rebellion (as few Months after
happened) could not have been the Issue of such Remarkable condescentions. At
the Lord Dillons going off,

1640. Sir William Parsons Master of the Court of Wards, long experienced in
the Affairs of Ireland, and Sir John Borlase Knight, Master of the Ordnance,
well known to his Majesty by several Employments at home and abroad, as
Colonel in the Low Countries, and Lieutenant General under the Lord Vere, one
of the most expert and fortunate Captains in the World, were the 10 (not the 9
as some write) of February, sworn at the Council Board Lords Justices: who
jointly endeavored to smooth the rugged Passages of those Times, obtaining
from his Majesty more Graces than was thought would have been indulged the
Irish, in as much as a most Honorable person a noble Peer in the House of
Lords, avouched that the Lords Justices had always cheerfully received their
Requests and Messages, and were ready to comply with them, desiring that it
might be entered in their Journal, to the end that the memory of so even a
Government might remain to Posterity. Yet such then were the contrivance of the
Irish to Rebellion, that though as one says, the Design was many times
discontinued, yet it bore an ancient date, and was subtlely pursued in
Parliament the Session before it brake forth; when they pretended (by a
Committee of both Houses) to search his Majesty's Stores, as if some Plot had
been framed there to destroy the Parliament (the House of Parliament being then
over part of the Store) and on that pretense they would fain have seen all his
Majesty's Store of Ammunition and Arms. But the Lord Borlase (Master of the
Ordnance, under whose charge those were) boldly denied their Requests as his
Majesty's choicest Jewels, not to be discovered without his especial Orders,
which they took ill, and October. 23. 1641. the Rebellion sadly broke out in its
vigor and extremity, raised for the Restoration of the public Profession of
the Romish Religion, the Restitution of all the Plantation Lands unto the
Natives, and settlement of the present Government into their hands. On which
pretensions it went on currantly, though the night before Owen O-Canally (a
mere Irish man, but trained up in the Protestant Religion, who out of a sense
of his The Anniversary Act of Thanksgiving, fol. 5.
Duty and Loyalty to his Majesty, and for the preservation of his good People,
and as an Effect of that Religion he was trained up in) had discovered it first
to the Lord Parsons, and then (not accounting himself to be sufficiently
credited) to the Lord Borlase, at whose House the Council (such as could be
raised from their Beds) met; and securing the Castle and City with such
strength as they had, the Lord MacGuire, Colonel Hugh Oge-Mac-Ma^one, (some of
them afterward hanged at Tiburn) and others, were convened before them; who
yet made so slight a business of their Plot (being discovered and their persons
apprehended) as the Relator saw Mac-Mahon and others draw Gibbets (in Chalk)
with men hanging on them in several places in the Lord Borlases Hall, as the
best death the English could expect from them. In the Interim Dublin (by a
strange Providence) was secured, though afterward infested with so many
inconveniences, such streights, as these Justices Government was under a
perpetual trouble and anxiety, being at the best but uncertainly supplied out
of England; though such was the Resentment that the Parliament (then sitting)
had of Ireland, and the outrages committed against the English, as they
forthwith Ordered 20000 l. for the present supply; as also 6000 Foot and 2000
Horse to be raised with all convenient speed, Voting other things necessary
thereunto, passing an Act afterward for Subscriptions, which were very free
and liberal, besides a general Collection through all his Majesty's Dominion of
England and Wales toward the necessities of the poor distressed Christians and
Protestants barbarously suffering in Ireland. Which later Act arose to a very
considerable sum, so much were the People generally affected with the
afflictions of their Brethren, and for the most part the Contribution was
circumspectly and well disposed of, though I am not ignorant that some laid it
out in vanity, when afterward their necessities wished a supply for food. That
hence such was the success (that waited on the War prosecuted by the English)
that till the Exigencies of the Time brought on a Cessation, they never
received (the Defeat near Julians Town excepted, happening not without much
ignorance) any Scorn or Defeats; and what was very remarkable, without any
assistance either from the mere Irish or English-Irish, such a Unity was in the
Conspirators, (the Irish Catholics) that the Insurrection diffusing it self
over the whole Kingdom, settled into, and became a formed and almost a National
Rebellion of the Irish Papists against his late Royal Majesty of blessed
Memory; as more at large appears in an Act entitled, An Act for the better
Execution of his Majesty's gracious Declaration for the settlement of his
Kingdom of Ireland, fol. 1. As also in an Act for the Anniversary Thanksgiving
for the Deliverance, October 23. showing the Conspiracy so generally inhumane,
barbarous, and cruel, as the like was never before heard of in any Age or
Kingdom, etc. Nihil illa caede per paludes, per plateas, per viam Regiam perque
Sylvas cruentius, nihil insultatione barbarorum intolerantius praecipue tamen
in Causarum Patronos, to use Floras's expression in his Chapter, De Bello
adversus gentes P: 115.
exteras: to which I need add no more, those Acts being of Authority to
continue and outface such as would lay a finer Varnish on so horrid a Design.
So as these Governors were encompassed with a thousand difficulties, (maugre
the Imputation of very unjust Designs some would charge them with) and Money
coming in very slow; all People were encouraged by Orders from the Council
Board, Dated at the Castle of Dublin, (one on the 5, the later on the 14 of
January, 1642.) to bring in their Plate to be coined, which many did; some who
in respect of their Employment had least reason to do it, whilst others
secured theirs. At first the Stamp was in this Form, merely with the value of
the Silver upon it.



Afterward by the Kings Approbation, all kinds of pieces from 1 d. to 5 s.
were in this manner stamped.



And now some exceptions being taken against Sir William Parsons, (which in the
Scene of Affairs was no difficult thing to do) he was removed, yet without any
other disrespect or reflections, that now being free, he retired (with much
ease) to his own Privacies, with which he was much satisfied, till Dublin being
on all sides (but the Sea) obstructed, he went for England; where (not finding
his expectations answered) he grew less composed, and died at Westminster,
MDCXLIX, and was buried the II of March in St. Margerets Church near the Abbey.
A Gentleman of long and happy experience, one of a considerable Allie in
Ireland, having many Children fortunately bestowed on thriving Families, in
which himself was an excellent Example, a knowing Judge, and a Civil Magistrate.

1643. Sir John Borlase Knight, Master of the Ordnance, and Sir Henry Tichborn
Governor of Tredath, (who deserves a noble Memory for his Service there) were
May 1. sworn Lords Justices at the Council Board: who upon the Consummation of
the Cessation wholely concluded by the Marquess of Ormond, and the settlement
of the Army, resigned. Nor indeed did they it without much Repose, great
difficulties arising upon the Cessation, not possible for them to satisfy, the
Exchequer being quite exhausted, and the Money agreed to be brought in by the
Cessation being very negligently paid; besides the Cessation was not by all the
British and Protestant Forces received with equal compliance, through which
complaints daily multiplied. Monro in the North grew so much incensed at the
Cessation that in his Letters to the Lords Justices, dated September 29. 1643.
after that he had acknowledged the States Command to obey it, he writ to the
Lords Justices and Council, That that kind of usage and contempt of making a
Cessation without security for their Pay, etc. would constrain good servants
(though his Majesty's Loyal Subjects) to think upon some course which might be
satisfactory to them, being driven almost to despair, and threatened to be
persecuted by the Roman Catholic Subjects, as they were termed. Upon which the
Confederate Council at Kilkenny, October. 15. following, writ to the Lords
Justices and Council at Dublin to join with them the Power of all his Majesty's
good Subjects within this Kingdom, to secure the Cessation inviolable, and that
(whilst their Succors were in preparation) their Proceedings might no ways be
thought to violate the Cessation. The Consequence of which may hereafter be
enlarged on. Sir John Borlase (truly sensible of the times) died in great St.
Bartholomews London, March 15. 1647. Anno Aetatis suae, 72. and lies there
buried in the East end of the North side of the Chancel, near the Communion
Table; for whom I find Edward Bisse Esquire, now Sir Edward Clarentieux, in his
Notes on Sir Henry Spelmans Aspilogia, has left this Character, writing (after
that he had taken notice of his descent from Borlase in Cornwall) that

Cum ab Imperatoriis muneribus, quibus, cum in Hollandia, tum in Germania and
Dania defunctus est, requievisset, postmodum cum provinciae socio Guilielmo
Parsono Equite Aurato, vices Proregis in Hibernia amoto Straffordiae Comite
obivit, sub titulo Hiberniae Justiciarii, majori virtutis fama, quam sibi and

quam fortitudinis and verae Pietatis Cultor. Isque pari famae integritate ad

Per Maternam Ishamiorum in Northamptonia originem sanguine annexus erat
vetustissimae and nobilissimae familiae Comitum Oxoniensium quos Heroicarum
virtutum and sanguinis juxta Cognatione contingebat. Sir Henry Tichburn died at
Beauly his House near Drogheda, Anno 1667. and was buried in St. Mary's Church
in Drogheda, that owed a Rite to his Ashes, who (with so much vigilance and
excellent Conduct) had preserved It and the Town; the Defense of which was the
security of Dublin, for had the Irish took Drogheda, or deserted it (so as to
have laid the like Siege to Dublin) so many poor souls as escaped thither,
could never have been relieved; nor could the State have been in any capacity
to have subsisted till Forces arrived from England, the first of which was on
the last of December 1641. under the Conduct of Sir Simon Harcourt, Colonel of
a Regiment of Foot designed Governor of the City of Dublin, that long
experienced and excellent Officer, worthy the memory of the best Prince, and
most grateful People; who afterward was by an especial Order admitted into the
Privy Council. But Providence (whose eyes are in the Wheels) so ordered the
business, that the whole force of the Irish (united in Fury and Vilany) were
most miraculously there defeated, and that merely through Gods mercy, by the
Courage and Valor of the Besieged, bearing out against the uttermost of
Extremity and Treachery, faithfully set down by Dean Bernard in his Treatise
entitled, The Siege of Drogheda, the complete freeing of which was upon the
taking of Dundalk, March 26. 1642. Sir Henry Tichbourn entered Drogheda, November.
4. 1641. so early had the Vigilance of the State (through the experience of
One, who well knew the hazards of delay in War) provided for its Defense,
sending thither with Sir Henry Tichbourn Governor, Sir John Borlase jun.
afterward Colonel, and Lieutenant of the Ordnance, Lieutenant Colonel Robert
Byron, since Knight, and late Master of the Ordnance, and Lieutenant Colonel
Philip Wainmond, all formerly Field-Officers, to join with the most excellent
and truly Noble Henry Lord Viscount Moore, afterward Lieutenant General of the
Horse, deservedly registered amongst the first of the Nobility and Officers; who
was unfortunately slain at the beginning of the Treaty of the first Ceslation,
through the grazing of a Cannon bullet, which he foresaw, yet took not warning
enough to evade. These all served cheerfully under his Command, though the
change of Fortune (to whom none is indebted for her constancy) has
sufficiently evidenced in Some, how little is to be trusted to Ones Merits, if
Favor be not also put into the Balance.

Sir Henry Tichbourn, descended from an ancient Family in Hampshire, from whom,
though he received much, his Virtue added more, he was early educated in the
Wars; some years before his death he was made Marshal of Ireland.

1643. James Marquess of Ormond, Jan. 21. in Christ Church Dublin, was with
great solemnity and general acceptance, sworn L. Lieutenant; a person
likeliest, by his Interests and Concerns, to manage the troublesome Affairs then
in agitation. Not long after his access to the Government, the Lord Inchequin
(instigated by the Parliament of England) violated the Cessation in Munster, as
the Scots had done before in Vlster, whilst the Irish under the Command of the
Popes Nuncio, and Owen Row (a most inveterate Enemy to the English) equally
impatient of the Name as of the Government, withdrew their Soldiers from their
Fidelity and Colors; though in the interim Preston and Taff endeavored to
make up a Peace with the King. In opposition to which the Lord Inchequin and
the Prime Officers in Munster, had before interposed their sense, That no Peace
The Lord Inchequin and the Officers Letter from Cork July 17.
could be concluded with the Irish which would not bring unto his Majesty and
the Kingdom (in general) a far greater prejudice than show of a Peace there
will bring them an advantage etc. adding in the close, that the true sense of
the aspersion the Irish had cast upon his Majesty (with all those other Reasons
which they had set down in their Declaration) made them resolve to die a
thousand deaths rather than to condescend to any Peace with the perfidious
Rebels, vowing never to desert the Cause that was so visibly God Almighties.

Notwithstanding which and many more difficulties, his Excellency bore up with
an equal heat, till that through the impetuousness of the Times, the English
Monarchy was discemented, that the King being retired to New Castle, writes
from thence to the Marquess of Ormond, June 11. 1646. That for many Reasons,
too long for a Letter, we think it fit to require you to proceed no further in
Treaty with the Rebels, nor to engage Us upon any Conditions with them after
sight hereof, etc. Our Service and the good of our Protestant Subjects being
herein much concerned. After which the Rebels laying Siege to Dublin, and the
Lord Lieutenant not being able to sustain a longer Encounter, the Scots too
infesting at a distance, surrendered Dublin, June 18. 1647. and what the King
held in Ireland to the Parliaments Commissioners, Arthur Ansloe Esquire;, Sir
Robert King, Sir Robert Meredith, Colonel John More, Colonel Michael Jones
(to whom Cheshire gives a Character that he never charged the Enemy till he
came to the Head of their Troops) rather then to suffer the Interest of the
English and Protestants to fall into the Power of the Irish. And so retires for
England soon after. But before that he left the Kingdom, Philip Lord Lisle was
by the Parliament of England, 1646. Jan. 28. ordered to go into Ireland as
their Lieutenant personally well furnished, though otherwise with no
considerable Force; being made to believe that that part of the Army in England
(which had then nothing to do, the King being brought to Holmby) should be sent
after him, upon which Febr. 19. he set sail from Minhead and arrived at Cork
the 22. yet the Army (from whence he expected great matters) then growing
mutinous, would not be commanded by the Parliament; amongst which there were,
besides a Party in the House, that did not further his Design, with whom some
in Ireland showed (at his landing) to have an intimacy or correspondence; so
that though (for the little time he was there) it could not be said but that
Affairs were prudently carried, yet finding the Scene so contrary to his
expectation, he furnished the Marquess of of Ormond the 10 of March, with 20
Barrels of Powder, and the first of April 1647. he returned for England, being
out of hopes of more than those small Forces he carried with him.

1648. The said James Marquess of Ormond (furnished with new Instructions)
returns (on the Votes of Non-Addresses) anew into Ireland Lord Lieutenant; but
so writes Elenchus, as to Act nothing in the P. 223.
execution of that Power as long as the Treaty with the King, or any hopes of
Peace lasted. Which Injunction he very solemnly observed, retiring himself to
the Castle of Kilkenny, his proper Inheritance; but finding (at length) how the
King was abused in that Treaty, he then vigorously endeavored to improve his
Interests for his Majesty's Service, though with that Caution, so vigilant an
Eye, such a wary Foot, as if the concerns of Posterity, more than his own, was
deposited in the weightiest Scale: and thereupon, being forced in the midst of
great streights, to conclude a Peace with the Confederate Irish, he proclaimed
it, Jan. 17. 1648. which yet so little endeared him to them (though such Terms
could never have been gained but at such an extremity) as August 12. 1650. the
titulary Archbishops of Ireland and others of the Clergy, convened at James
Town, left no stone unturned to have hit him if it had been possible;
excommunicating all that adhered to him, though at his departure they testified
(by an Act made at their General Assembly at Loghreough, December. 7. 1650.) that
they were fully satisfied that his Excellency had faithful Intentions and
hearty Affections to advance his Majesty's Interests and Service in that
Kingdom. Soon after which he quitted Ireland, having born (with incredible
patience) the Affronts and Insolences of the most considerable part of the
Irish against his Majesty's Authority lodged in him; and so, at length, that he
might gratify their Expectations, he left the Government in the Marquess of
Clanrickard; a person, say they, faithful to his Majesty, and acceptable to the
Nation. And now being loose from an ungrateful People, whom all his
Condescentions, Travels and Sufferings made more Insolent, he at length reached
France; where he had not been long, but he was summoned to an employment
answerable to his Fidelity. The Duke of Gloucester being sent out of England,
the Jesuits (who were ready to improve the sufferings of that poor Prince to
the advantage of their own Interests) got him into their Clutches, which the
King hearing of, immediately imploys the Marquess of Ormond to recover him from
their Insinuations and Allurements; the which he did with singular prudence and
sincerity, though the Duke of Gloucester had before given such evidence of his
satisfaction and proof of his Religion, that the Jesuits subtilties could work
nothing on him, but a closer adherence to the true Faith; which (that this
History may be more evident) I shall here insert what Monsieur De L' Angle (in
his Letter, p. 30. touching the Religion of the King) has evidenced to the
World, from Monsieur Durel the Princes Governor.

Voicy donc ce que j'enscay. C'est que les Jesuittes entreprirent de porter
cejeune Prince a la revolte, pour cela ils trouverent le moyen d'oster son
Gouverneur d' aupres de luy. En suitte dequoy ils livrerent diverse assauts a sa
Religion. On luy faisoit reluire mill belles esperances, on luy promettoit de
luy fair pluvoir dans le sein les plus importantes dignitez Ecclesiastiques du
Royaume, on l' asseuroit de l' Abaye de Saint Denis, and de l' Archevesche de
Rheims, and d'un Chappeau de Cardinal. Bref ces Messieurs luy donnoient parole
que l' on le rendroit si rich qu'il seroit assez puissant pour restablir le
Roy son friar dans son throne. Mais Dieu assista extraordinairement ce Prince,
and pour l' opprobre de Christ, qu'il prist pour sa part, il meprisa
genereusement ces Richesses d' Aegypte. Surquoy les Jesuittes le transporterent
de lieu en lieu, comme l' Esprit fit autrefois nostre Seigneur pour le tenter.
Ils le menerent premierement a Pontoise, au Seminaire des Jesuittes, ou Dieu
luy fit la grace de soustenir de grands combats, mais par la force de son
esprit don't il accompagna cet excellent Prince, qui en ce temps la n' avoit pas
plus de dix ou douze ans, il resta victorieux de tous ses puissans ennemis, qui
resolurent encor de changer de place and de revenir a Paris, faisan, comme
Balaam qui miroit de tous costez le peuple de Dieu pour donner quelque prise a
ses charms. Mais tout cela ne leur reussit point, par tout Dieu benit cet
illustre Enfant, and Dieu luy donna cette sapience d'enhaut a laquelle le monde
ne scauroit resister. Et Dieu qui ne souffre point que les siens soient tentez
par dessus leur force, le delivra de tentation. Car le Roy d' Angleterre qui
apprist par son Gouverneur exile l'estat de son friar; envoya promptement a son
secours le Marquis d' Ormont qui le tira de ce mauvais pas par l' order de la
Reyne, qui eut la bonte de deferer a la volonte du Roy d' Angleterre son fills,
and de fair remittre le Duc de Gloucester enter les mains de ce Marquis, qui le
ramena aupres de ce Roy, qui depuis ce temps la a veille sur son education and
l'affirmi en la cognoissance de la verite. 1650. Vlike Burgh Marquess of
Clanrickard, Earl of St. Albons, in December, (upon the departure of the
Marquess of Ormond) was left Lord Deputy. He lived sometimes at Loghreough,
sometimes at Port Tumney, and at Tirrillen, continuing (by virtue of his
Commission) the Assembly at Loghreough, begun by the Marquess of Ormond, which
(in respect of the three States, Lords, Bishops, and Commons, assembled in that
Body) the Irish entitled a Parliament. He entered the 7. of March into
Galloway with all the Nobility and Gentry in great splendor, much to the
content of that ^^^^y; yet behaved himself with so even a temper, as the Kings
business was carried on, and the English every where countenanced: Till the
Torrent proving too strong by the Parliaments Forces daily succeeding, he (on
the best terms he could make) quitted all to their Mercy about the Year 1652.
and returned for England, where not long after he died at London, and was
buried at Summerhil by Tunbridge in Kent. The English Interest being now wholly
under the Government of the Parliaments Forces (managed sometimes by Cromwell,
sometimes by Ireton, then by Fleetwood, at last by Henry Cromwell) victoriously
succeeding through the whole Nation, Victory (as the Lord Chancellor observes
in his Speech in Parliament, September. 13. 1660.) being entailed on the Army,
which humanely speaking, could hardly fail of Conquest, etc. Whose Order and
Discipline, whose sobriety and manners, whose courage and success has made it
famous and terrible over the whole World: In as much as some of the Rebels
themselves (in their Queries to the Bishop of Limerick) say, that such a Winter
success in War, by so inconsiderable a Party, against so considerable a
Kingdom, was never read or heard of; considering especially, that to the
support of the Irish Interests from* January 1649. to January 1650. there was
raised 533564 l. 10 s. 11 d. besides Meal, Beefs, Wheat, Winter Quarter, Kings
Customs, Excise, and Enemies Estates, if we may credit the Relation of
Mercurius Politicus. P. 347. Anno 1650.
So as the Confederacy of the Irish being thereupon broken, September 26.
1653. notwithstanding the Popes Cement, there insued thereupon a distribution
of the Rebels Estates, which since (by a Supreme Power) is more orderly
invested in the Possessors; and those (whose Loyalty valued not the Nuncio's
Excommunication) have their Lands secured by the Act of Settlement. And what is
more, their Names, their Honors, and Themselves perpetuated to Posterity,
having eminently suffered for their adhering to the Authority of his Majesty,
or his late Father of Blessed Memory, against the Nuncio and The Act of
Settlement, fol. 124.
his Party.

The Year before his Majesty's happy return into England, Interesses of all
sorts bandying one against another, Ireland (amongst the rest) thought how best
to secure its Stake. Upon which Sir Charles Coote Barronet, and other Officers
of the Army in Ireland (much in Vouge with the People) set forth a Declaration
at Dublin, February 16. 1659. taking notice how the Authority o^ the Parliament
in England was openly violated, and that it was but Reason to secure the Grand
Interest, having been poured forth from Vessel to Vessel, etc. with much more
to the same effect, worthy of a Record, in as much as not long after in a
General Convention (not without the subtlety of some contrived to effect the
Kings Restoration) was summoned at Dublin, in which there was Orders taken for
the satisfying the Soldiers, who had been long behind in their Pay, and the
effecting of other things conducible to the Grand Design. And now having notice
of the Kings Letter from Breda, they (accounting themselves not less concerned
than others) laid hold on his Clemency in this Declaration.

A Declaration of the General Convention of Ireland.
ALthough the Deluge of Blood spilt in these his Majesty's Kingdoms of England,
Ireland, and Scotland, might by the cry thereof awaken us; and the observation
how God has from time to time blasted all the attempts of rasing our ancient
Foundations, speaks plainly unto all, that we must return to, and repose in the
proper Center of that Government under which these Kingdoms for many hundreds
of years flourished: Yet we cannot but acknowledge, and we do hereby Declare,
That we receive additional encouragement to hope and endeavor for his
Majesty's return and resettlement, (the only basis to support our Liberties
and Freedom) from perusal of his Majesty's late gracious Declaration dated at
his Court at Breda the 4/14 day of April in the twelfth Year of his Reign,
directed to all his loving Subjects, under which title we are comprehended,
which we justly esteem our glory and happiness.

And we cannot pass by our acknowledgment of the undeserved Mercies of our God,
who by inclining his Majesty's heart to the entertaining of the thoughts of
Clemency, Justice, and Peace; and by bowing the hearts of all his Majesty's
faithful Subjects in these three Kingdoms, to embrace resolutions of duty and
loyalty due to his sacred Person; has in a great part removed those
obstructions which to humane appearance seemed insuperable by Treasure and
Blood, without the expense of the one, or effusion of the other.

And we do hereby declare our humble, hearty and joyful sense of those gracious
offers held forth by his Majesty in his said Declaration, and confirmed by the
word of a KING, which are like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver, and the
lively expressions of an indulgent King, that prevents the desires of his
People by free Concessions.

And we further declare, That with all submissive thankfulness we receive, and
do lay hold of those condescensions of favor and grace, as the fittest
expedients to cement the divided Interests in these three Kingdoms; for which
we shall always pay a constant Tribute of Duty and Loyalty to his Majesty, as
the undoubted* Heir of these three Kingdoms, and our just and lawful Sovereign,
so that as we may with full satisfaction say we live under the best of Kings:
^^ his Majesty may be pleased to repute us amongst the best of Subjects.

God save the KING.
Dated the 14 of May, 1660.
May 14. 1660.
ORdered by the General Convention of Ireland, That this Declaration be
forthwith Printed and Published.

Ma. Barry Clerk of the General Convention of Ireland.

Dublin, Printed by William Bladen, by special Order, Anno Dom. 1660.

The Convention (which in all things had manifested its Loyalty, and the first
fruits of obedience) continued after the Kings Return with his permission;
having expressed their Loyalty to Him, his Royal Highness, and the Duke of
Gloucester, in a sum considerable for that poor Nation. And, on the promise of a
Parliament, dissolved.

Sub CAROLO II.
His Majesty was no sooner settled in his Throne, but he reflected on the
miserable and languishing State of Ireland, whose Harp had long hung on the
Willows solitary and unstrung; and thereupon named some to whom the Affairs of
Ireland were particularly addressed, yet till that he had pitched on such as he
thought fittest for the continuance in that Government, I find by a
Proclamation dated at Dublin Sept. 24. 1660. Sir Charles Coote Knight Barronet,
and Major * William Bury, styled Commissioners of Government and Management of
Affairs in Ireland; which I could not pass over, though these had not the
Regalia signa puniendi, Sword and Mace committed to their trust; the first of
that nature were

1660. Sir Maurice Eustace, Lord Chancellor, Roger Boil Earl of Orrerey, Baron
Braughil President of Munster, and Sir Charles Coote Earl of Montrath, Lords
Justices; the Chancellor and Montrath were sworn December. 31. Orrerey the 17 of
January; before whom a Parliament was summoned the 8 of May 1661. of which Dr.
Bramhal Lord Primate of Ardmagh was by the Kings appointment made Speaker of
the House of Lords, the Chancellor being then one of the Lords Justices
substituted (with his Colleagues) to present the Kings person in that Senate.
Of whom Dr. Dud. Loftus in his Funeral Oration of this Bishop, p. 30. writes
very worthily Praeter quotidiana munia sua praestita perquam laudabiliter hisce
Comitiis, habuit in eorundem auspiciis orationem gravibus verbis cultam, and
sapientissimis sententiis politam, alias vero effudit Orationes Succulentas,
etc. ut nemo fide prestantior, nemo certe in officio constantior atque
perseverantior, etc. Ejusdemque Consilio, decretum est, unanimi consensu
suffragante, omnia sua Membra, coenae salutaris Dominicae fieri participantia,
sacra manu hujus Praesulis administrante. Which I the rather observe, it being
(for what I ever heard) the first Order of that Nature, the Composition of the
Lords House consisting most of Papists.
And Sir Audley Mervin his Majesty's Prime Sergeant at Law, was made Speaker of
the House of Commons; which he discharged with equal Faith and Integrity.

The House of Commons gave the Duke of Ormond 30000 l. as a Present from their
House, without relation to any satisfaction which should be provided for him by
his Majesty, or otherwise in recompense of his great losses and sufferings;
such a value was placed on his Merits, such an estimate on his sufferings. And
as soon as the King had declared at Court ( viz. the 4 of November 1661.) that
he had made the Duke of Ormond Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Irish Committee
of Parliament then attending the King, returned him solemn thanks for so
excellent a Choice, and the Lords Justices and Council of Ireland, upon the
notice thereof, published this Order.

By the Lords Justices and Council. M^ur. Eustace Canc. Orrerey, Montrath
WHereas his Majesty has in his Highness Wisdom adjudged it fit to declare
our very good Lord his Grace the Duke of Ormond Lord Lieutenant of this
Kingdom, who had the honor to be so eminently instrumental in laying such firm
Foundations for the future strengthening of this Kingdom, the propagation of
the Protestant Religion, and securing the English Interest therein: We
therefore think fit, and so do Order, That the Major of the City of Dublin do
take Order that there be this Evening such Public Demonstrations of Joy, upon
so happy an occasion, in and throughout the* City and Suburbs, as well by the
Militia of the City as otherwise, as may testify the joined and unanimous
gladness of all men for that happy choice made by his Majesty, tending, by the
blessing of God, in an high degree, to the honor and service of his Majesty,
and to the happiness of this his Kingdom and People.

The Earl of Montrath dying the 18 of December 1661. of the Small Pox in Dublin,
was privately buried in Christ Church the next night, but his Obsequies were
there solemnly performed the 6 of February following in great State. After
whose death

1661. Sir Maurice Eustace Lord Chancellor, and Roger Earl of Orrerey, etc.
January 14. were sworn Lords Justices at the Council Board. Sir Maurice Eustace
died in Dublin the 22 of June, in the 71 year of his Age of a Palsy, 1665. and
was buried at Castle Martin early the next morning; his Funeral was solemnized
in St. Patricks Church in Dublin that day three Weeks after he died.

The most noble Prince James, Duke, Marquess, and Earl of Ormond, Earl of
Ossory and Brecknock, Viscount ^hurles, Lord Baron of Arclo and Lanthony, Lord
of the Regalities and Liberties of the County of Tiperary, Chancellor of the
University of Dublin, Lord Lieutenant General and General Governor of his
Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland, one of the Lords of his Majesty's most honorable
Privy Council of his Majesty's Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, Lord
Steward of his Majesty's Household, Lord Lieutenant of the County of Somerset,
Gentleman of his Majesty's Bedchamber, and Knight of the most noble Order of
the Garter. MDCLXII.


1662. James Duke of Ormond, etc. who had (as the Act for the Settlement of the
Kingdom of Ireland says, fol. 99.) upon the most abstracted considerations of
Honor and Conscience, faithfully adhered to his Majesty, and to the Crown of
England, without any regard to his own Estate or Fortune, was the 28 of July
sworn in Cork-House Lord Lieutenant, and the 27 of September following, he gave
the Royal Assent to several Acts of Parliament. At that time delivering himself
in so significant a Speech as (besides those Elegances which beautified the
Oration) he discovered, with singular humanity, how far men (further than
their* first intention) may proceed to Villainies, Policy and Power (in
conclusion) could not restrain. All delivered with that Vigor, that nothing
could have made equal Impression, or indeed have been spoken, but from one that
had lain in his Masters breast, known his thoughts, uttered his sense; which
being registered amongst the Records of Parliament, is there to be sought for
with Reverence.

Then (as I have said) he past many Acts of Parliament, amongst the rest, one
for the Settlement of the Kingdom of Ireland was the chief; which afterward
(through the proceedings of the Commissioners authorized by Virtue of that Act
to judge betwixt Party and Party) came again to be considered: In as much as
Sir Audley Mervin (Speaker of the House of Commons) in his excellent Speech to
his Grace the Duke of Ormond, February 13. 1662. styles it the Magna Charta
Hiberniae; P. 3.
and in maintenance of the true sense thereof, presents an Instrument to his
Grace, with Rules and Directions for the Commissioners proceedings thereupon,
that discerning a Cloud (through the Interposition of some malevolent Planet)
it might remain (whether pursued or no) as a Record of their endeavors, that
the hard fate and ruin of an English Interest P. 1.
in Ireland, might not bear date under the best of Kings, under so vigilant a
Lord Lieutenant, under the first, if not prevented, like to be the last
Protestant Parliament there; which with fuller circumstances, were so lively
presented by him, that with one Voice it was Ordered to be Printed, and so it
was by William Bladen at Dublin, and reprinted at London by J. Streater soon
after; which for its length I omit, though (as to the English Interest, the
Adventurers security, and the Soldiers Arrears) nothing deserves more solemnly
to be commended to Posterity. All afterward duly considered of by his Grace
the Duke of Ormond, who in the timely composure of this business, struggled
under no mean or short Encumbrances, and so having laid the Storm (the better
to reduce all Interests into a Settlement) he repaired into England, the 31 of
May, 1663. And his Son

1663. Thomas Earl of Ossory the same day was sworn Lord Deputy in the Council
Chamber, the Sword (till then deposited in the Dukes Closet) being with usual
Ceremonies committed to his Trust. And well it might, for never any (unless his
Father) received it with more general applause, or bore it with a more equal
and obliging temper. Since he has (in several capacities at Sea) gallantly
acted beyond the Fiction of a Romance.

1665. In the beginning of September his Grace the Duke of Ormond landed at
Waterford and came to Kilkenney, having the Sword delivered to him again upon
his landing, the Earl of Ossory's Commission then being determined. And now his
Excellency being returned (on whose Indulgence Father Walsh with his Party much
relied) the Glossing Design of some Papists (to demonstrate their Allegiance to
the King against all pretenses of the Roman Court) daily gathered fire, in as
much as the Irish Clergy (Archbishops, Bishops, etc. with two Divines of each
Regular Order, to the number of 70) obtained the freedom to meet at Dublin in
the Residence of the Parish Priest of St. Owens Church the 11 of June 1666. in
a National Synod, to sign the Remonstrance and Protestation subscribed and
presented to his Majesty in January and February, 1661. by diverse of the
Nobility, Gentry, and Romish Clergy; the like whereof, nay Walsh Loyal
Remonstrance fol. 674.
nor any way near it, had ever been permitted (says my Author, others thought
so too) since Queen Mary's Reign; that rational men expected (from so gracious
a connivance) some notable and grateful Act would have proceeded; but in stead
of such, first they clash amongst themselves, then the Primate coming in, bids
the Bishop of Kilfinuragh their Speaker to quit the Chair; who refusing, the
Primate with most of the Assembly depart the House; upon which the Remnant cry
hard for a Dissolution. But Father Walshes Arguments (after some heats on all
sides) prevailed to continue the Assembly, and the Primate returns thither of
himself, the House declaring that the Chair was no Seat of Dignity, but of
Ministry and Office. And so the Assembly proceeded, but with such animosities
in their Debates, as the Result was wholly insignificant, granting little more
(if any thing) then when their Confederates, in the late Rebellion, coined
Moneys, slew his Majesty's innocent naked Subjects, surprised his Castles,
vilified his Governor, yet verbally professed Allegiance to the King: so as
the 25 of June (the 15 day of their meeting) the National Synod was dissolved,
his Grace signifying to them that he found no satisfaction in any of their
Addresses. In all which Father Walsh is very particular in his History and
Vindication of the Loyal Formulary. A Piece (bating his exuberances) worthy
perusal; for which, and his integrity, he bears the Papal Frown; having
manifested only that the Vicar of the Church has no Sovereignty over Sovereign
Princes in their own Dominions in Civil and Temporal Affairs. A Tenent so
necessary, that the contrary in History is marked with a black Coal. Nor can it
be otherwise, no Pope willingly allowing Subjects any other Obedience to their
Prince, than what is in subordination to their See, upon which the greatest
dissentions in the World have ensued; so that indeed to talk of Obedience in
Civil and Temporal Affairs only, is in truth nothing; the Ecclesiastic
Authority wiping off at pleasure the other Cobweb pretended Subjection.

The 26 of October following his Graces arrival at Kilkenny, the Parliament
(which had been long put off by many necessary Prorogations) fell into
consideration of the Explanatory Bill of Setlement, which took up much time, as
it had long before exercised his Graces Solicitations, Interest and Studies in
England: At length it passed (though not without some doubts) by the Commons in
Parliament; which his Grace, with the advice of the Council the 15 of December,
1665.) having The State of which business was Printed at Dublin, with his
Graces Speech, and the House of Commons Considerations on the Bill of
Settlement, by John Crook, 1665.
satisfied, he past into an Act; which I am the willinger to mention, that what
Niceties soever one may raise thence, the Faith of this Illustrious person,
given in its defense, may bear up its honor and validity; though some thought
(notwithstanding the utmost extent of the Investing Clause) the whole was short
of what might be expected for Money See the State of the Adventurers Case, fol.
7.
so long subscribed; the charge the Soldiers and Adventurers had been at for
surveying, maintaining, and defending their Lots, the passing of Patents, and
the great Rents payable thence; which considering the State of Affairs, could
hardly be avoided: As it may well be concluded by this, that after five years
pains taken by the King, by his Councils, and by his two Houses of Parliament,
the State was got no farther than into the Prospect of a Settlement.

All which and more you will find in his Graces Speech to both Houses of
Parliament, at his giving the Royal Assent to the Grand Act of Settlement,
1665. to which I must refer you, as being the support of his Graces confidence
in the Settlement; and may well be others, whoever is most concerned in the
Adventure.

At his Return for England (near three years after) he was chosen Chancellor of
Oxford, on Dr. Sheldon Lord Archbishop of Canterburie's rie's Resignation,
August 4. 1669. as one best able to protect that place, and the Theatrum
Sheldonianum, a Piece (if not exceeding) emulating the stateliest Monuments of
Antiquity; yet he was not sworn till August the 26. at Worcester-House London,
in a Convocation there held by Dr. Fell Vice Chancellor; a most obliging and
vigilant Governor, and others of the University in their Formalities At which
Solemnity there was also present his Grace of canterbury, the Bishops of
London, Worcester, Oxford, and Rochester, the Earls of Bedford, Aylsbury,
Dumferlin, and Carlingford, with innumerable other persons of Quality, whom
(after the Convocation was ended) he there entertained at a most sumptuous
Banquet, with a Mind more obliging.


1668. April the 25. the Earl of Ossory was again sworn Lord Deputy in the
absence of the Duke his Father, who embarked the day before for England, he
(having passed over his Government with general satisfaction) resigned.

1669. To John Lord Roberts, Baron of Thruro, Lord Privy Seal, the 18 of
September, who landed at Houth, and was that day honorably conducted to
Dublin, and sworn at the Council Board Lord Lieutenant: who (on the access of
the Lord Barkley to the Government) gave up his Power with this short Speech,

My Lord,
I will not detain you long from the great Charge now placed upon you, Action
is the life of all Government. I have no more to say. But I received this Sword
in Peace, and will deliver it so to your Excellency.

For whom I have seen this Inscription, written by one who knows as well what
Men are, as the Language (wherein he is excellent) to express them in:

1670. May the 21. John Lord Barkley, Baron of Stratton, landed privately at
Rings End by Dublin (scarce then expected) and was that day sworn Lord
Lieutenant at the Council Board. Who going for England

1671. June the 12. Dr. Richard Boil Archbishop of Dublin, and Lord
Chancellor, and Sir Arthur Forbes Barronet, a Member of the Privy Council, and
Captain of a Troop of Horse, were sworn Lords Justices: Archbishop Boil was

designed, entitled, Quam de^^o exaltavit Dominus Coronam, Composed by the then
Dean of S. Patricks Dr. William Fuller, since Bishop of Limerick, now of
Lincoln; and (that no question might be raised as to the Legitimacy of this
