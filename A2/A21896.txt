Orders conceived by the Lords of her Majesty's privy Council, and by her
Highness special direction, commanded to be put in execution for the
restraint of killing and eating of flesh this next Lent, and to be executed as
well by the Lord Mayor within the City and Suburbs of London, and by the
Officers of the liberties and exempt places in and about the same, as by order
to be prescribed by the Lords Lieutenants of all the Counties of the Realm to
the Justices of peace, Lords of liberties, and Officers of corporate Towns.
In the xxxv year of the Queens Majesty's reign.
FIrst Maisties pleasure is, upon her understanding of the great disorders
heretofore and especially the Last Lent committed in killing and eating flesh
in the time of Lent, especially in the City of London, and the liberties
thereto adjoining, that the statute made in the fist year of her Majesty's
reign for the restraint thereof, be put in due execution by the way of
inquisition, and charge of Iuries, and by any other good means, both within
the City and all other places requsite within the Realm.

And for the better knowledge of the truth of these disorders, and redress of
the inconueniencess, the said Iuries shall call before them, and send for any
of the servants of any Inholders, Victuallers, Tauernrrs, and keepers of
ordinary tables, and such other that utter victuals, to examine them upon
their corporal oaths, what flesh shall be, or is any day during the Lent
season dressed, killed, uttered, or eaten in their houses: which if they shall
refuse to do, then they shall commit to prison the said servants, so refusing
upon their oaths to declare the truth.

And Because a great part of this disorder grows by the Butchers of the City
of London, and also of the Country, that secretly kill and bring flesh to the
City: there shall be only six Butchers licenced by the Lord Mayor to kill
flesh within the said City and liberties thereof, yielding for the relief of
maimed Soldiers and Mariners such sums as shall he limited for that purpose
by order of the privy Counsel.

And every of these Butchers to be so licenced, shall be first bound in the
sum of two hundredth pounds to her Majesty's use, (and the bonds to the
certified to the Queens Remembrancer in the Exchequer) to sell no flesh in the
time of Lent, but to such persons as shall show them special warrant from the
Lord Mayor, under his hand, and that the Butchers do truly keep particular
books of their daily sales, and of the names of those to whom they shall so
sell, with the quantities and the times thereof.

That the Lord Mayor give order to these Butchers, not to sell any flesh but at
reasonable prices, and for that purpose the prices shall be set down by the
said L. Mayor, such as may be reasonable both for the buyer and seller: and if
the Butcher shall break that order, then to be forthwith discharged, and
committed to prison, and an other put into his place, and his bond to be
certified into the exchequer to the Queens benefice.

That the Lord Mayor himself shall grant no warrant for buying of flesh in
Lent, but to such as shall have and show to him license in good writing
according to the laws of the Realm to eat flesh, and the said license to be
viewed and registered, first by some two meet persons to be appointed for this
purpose by the Lord Mayor, and Books to be kept thereof, to be showed further
when the same shall be required, unless it be to Ambassadors and Agents of
foreign Princes, to whom notwithstanding no further quantity shall be
allowed, then ratably for their own housbold, and that such Ambassadors and
Agents shall give to the Lord Mayor a Certificate weekly, what they shall
require to be for their own tables.

That the L. Mayor shall now presently before Lent cause all Inholders, Table
keepers, Victualers, Alehousekeepers, and Tauerners within the City, and
liberties thereof, to appear before him, or such persons as he shall appoint
meet for that purpose: and shall take bonds of every of them in good sums of
money not under one hundred pound a piece to her Majesty's use, not to dress
any flesh in their houses this Lent time for any respect, except, it be for
some such person that lies in their house, and that also has license through
sickness, or other necessary cause, to eat flesh. Bonds shall be taken also
of the Poulters, not to utter any Poultrie ware, but to such as shall be like
wise licenced to eat flesh, and that such as will not give such bonds, that
they be secluded from all utterance of victual during the Lent season.

And for the Butchers and others that come with victuals of flesh out of the
Country the City, the L. Mayor shall cause certain persons, whereof some to
be named to the L. Mayor by the Wardens of the Fishmongers, to watch at the
gates and other like places in the Suburbs, where flesh may be brought in, to
view and search, and to intercept the same. And in case the same shall be found
to be brought to any person not warranted nor licenced to eat it, as is
aforesaid, then the same to be forfeited and sold at the discretion of the L.
Mayor, for the use of the poor in the Hospitals and prisons in the City, and
the bringers to be imprisonned. And otherwise the Carriers of the said
victuals of flesh to be guided to the persons houses that have license, with
regard therein not to be abused, And this watch to be continued daily during
the whole time of Lent: and if any of these watch men be found negligent and
corupt in his charge, then he to be committed to prison, there to continue
during the whole Lent.

And to the end the said Orders may be duly executed, it is thought convenient,
that the L. Mayor should send for the chief Heads of the company of the
Fishmongers, and shall cause them to make choice of four or more wise and
discreet persons of the said company, and men of good wealth and ability,
to whom they shall commit the charge to make inquiry after such as shall be
found transgressors of the said Orders: who in respect of their travel
bestowed in that behalf, shall have y^ one moitie of such bonds as shall be
forfeited by transgressing of the said Orders, and the other moitie to be
converted unto godly uses, by the discretion of the Queens Majesty's High
Almner, specially upon poor and lame soldiers, with the priuitie of some of
the Privy Council.

And that there may be due execution of the said Orders, as well without as
within the Liberties of the City, it is thought convenient, that they that
have the chief charge over the places priuileged and exempt, where any Leets
or Law days are kept, shall authorize under their hand and seal four persons
as are above mentioned, to make search within the said priuileged and exempt
places for such as shall transgress the said Orders, and shall for their
travel therein employed, receive the moitie of the Bonds forfeited, as is
above mentioned. And for the avoiding of corruption and partiality in the said
persons, it shall be necessary to take their oaths, and give bond in some good
and large sums, to see (as much as in them lies,) a due observation of the
said Orders.

And for that it is to be doubted, that the said Fishmongers, upon the
observation of the said Orders, will take occasion thereby to inhaunce the
prises, as well of Fresh as of Sea fish: It is thought meet, that the Lord
Mayor shall take order with the said Fishmongers, that as well the Salt as
Fresh fish shall uttered at reasonable prises.

And it is ordered that no Butcher shall kill any Beeues, but such as shall be
specially licenced thereunto, without any fraud, for the furnishing of such
ships as shall be lawfully employed by Sea, either in the way of traffic,
or otherwise. And that such Butchers, as shall be licenced within the Liberties
by the head officers of the Liberties of kill any flesh, shall every fourteen
days at the least, give a true certificate unto the Lord Mayor and head
officers of the places exempt, of such numbers of Veales, Lambs, and Muttons,
as shall be by them weekly killed: to the end, there may be a true certificate
made every fifteen days unto the Lords and others of her Majesty's Privy
council, what numbers of the several kinds above mentioned shall be killed,
either within the City, or places exempt.

Lastly, where any Butchers shall be licenced in any exempt place without the
City of London and the Liberties thereof, before the said Butchers shall be
suffered to kill or sell any Flesh, they shall make payment to the hands of the
officers that shall give them license, for the relief of maimed Soldiers,
Mariners, and other lame and impotent persons such sums of money as shall be
limited by letters, either of the Privy council, or of the Lieutenant of the
Shires.

And as these Orders are expressly devised to be executed in the City of
London, and places near to the same, so her Majesty's pleasure and
commandment is, that the execution of these like Orders be performed by the
commandment of her Majesty's Lieutenants to be sent to the Justices of the
peace, in all Shires within their rule, and to all other in Towns corporate,
or in any Liberties, with like order for bonds to be taken to her Majesty's
use: the benefit of the forfeiture of which bonds, her Majesty may at the
intercession of the said Lieutenants cause to be distributed amongst lame and
poor soldiers.

Imprinted at London by the Deputies of CHRISTOPHER BARKER, Printer the Queens
most excellent Majesty.
