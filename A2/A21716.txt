By the Queen.
FOrasmuch as it can not be but dangerous to the Queens most excellent
Majesty, and her court now residyng in the Castle of Windsor, if any common
resort should be suffered from or to the City of London, or the Suburbs of the
same, where (by Gods sufferaunce) many places are infected with the plague:
Therefore her Majesty wills and straightly commands that no manner of
persons shall come from the said City or Suburbs to Windsor, or to the Town
of Eton, or shall cause to be brought any apparel, stuff, or wares from thence
directly or indirectly, mediatly or immediately: neither that any person
attendant or following her Majesty's Court ordinaryly or extraordinaryly, or
dwelling or any wise belonging to the Towns of Windsor or Eton or any part
thereof, shall repair by land or by water to London or the Suburbs of the
same, or to any parish near London where any persons have been known to have been lately sick of the plague, with any intent to return again from thence
within one month, otherwise then is hereafter specially mentioned and
provided, upon pain to be imprisoned without bail for the same by the space
of one month: or (if the quality of the party shall so require to be also
whipped and punished like a common vacabonde. And because it can not presently
be so provided for, but that some persons shall of very necessity have cause
to come from the said City or Suburbs to the Court or to the Towns of
Windsor and Eton, and likewise some others to repair to some parts of the
said City or Suburbs not being infected: it is by her Majesty thus provided,
That if any shall have any such necessary cause to come from the City of
London or Suburbs to the Court, the same person shall not enter into any manner
house in Windsor or Eton, nor shall come within the utter gates of the Court,
until he has first resorted to the Mayor of Windsor, or to the principal
officers in Eton, and to him or them declared to whom he has necessary cause
to repair in the Court. And thereupon the said Mayor or officers shall cause the
party to stay abroad without entering into any house or company of any person,
and shall certify the lord Steward, the lord Chamberlain, the
Uizechamberlayne, or one of them, or some of the principal officers of the
Greenecloth (if the matter appertain to the Queens Majesty's household) or to
some other of the lords or others of her Majesty's privy counsel, according
to the quality of the matter, and of the persons with whom the party has to
do in the Court. And by a warrant in writing signed with the hands of any of
the said lords, counselors, or officers, certified to the said Mayor or
officers, the said person shall be permitted to enter into some house, and
afterward shall or may come to the Court with the said warrant to be first
showed to the Queens Majesty's Porters, or otherwise without such warrant and
allowaunce the said person shall be commanded to return without any longer
abiding, upon pain above mentioned. And if the cause of the coming of the
said persons to the Town, shall be for any matter belonging to any inhabitaunt
of the Town: in such case the said Mayor and officers shall not in like manner
suffer any such person to come into any house, nor to bring any stuff until
the name of the party and his cause be declared by the said Mayor or officers
to the Constable of the Castle of Windsor, or to his Leefetenaunt, or to some
of her Majesty's privy counsel, or to the knight Marshall, or chief Porter
of the Castle, and by them or some of them allowed by warrant in writing,
without which order and such allowaunce, no person shall be suffered to remain in
any of the said Towns, but shall return immediately. And if any person shall
have necessary cause to depart from the said Towns or Court by land or by
water to London or the Suburbs, with any mind to return within one month,
the same shall sue to have, and shall first obtain special license and
warrant in writing for every time of his departure fromsome of the foresaid
principal officers of her Majesty's house, chamber, or some of her privy
counsel above mentioned: or else if the party belong to the said Towns, then
from the said Mayor of Windsor, or the head officers of Eton: so as also the
same persons have the consent in writing of some of the officers and ministers
above mentioned. And as for any Courriors, Posts, or messengers coming from
London with letters to the Queens Majesty, or to any of the counsel: they
shall not enter into the Court without knowledge first given by the Porters to
some of the counsel, and thereupon the party to enter, tarry, or depart, as
they shall be specially commanded, and not otherwise. And for the better
execution hereof, her Majesty wills and requires all the foresaid officers
and ministers above mentioned to confer together, and to instruct the said
Mayor of Windsor and officers of Eton, how and by what manner and form of
warrantes (without fraud or couen) such only as have necessary causes
belonging to the Queens Majesty, her lords, counselors, and others
attending on her person or on her court, may be permitted to come from London
or resort thither, and no other: using therein all circumspection convenient
and necessary for such a cause of importance.

And further her Majesty charge her knight Marshall and his ministers, to
wait daily upon the passages in and to these Towns of Windsor and Eton
leadyng to and from the said City with all diligence: and whomsoever they
shall suppose to be going or ridyng with intention to resort to London, or
coming from thence, the same to arrest and stay, and examine whether they have
such warraunt, or have observed such orders as above is mentioned. And if any
person shall be able to prove, that either the said Mayor, principal officers
in Eton, or that the knight Marshall or any of his ministers, shall neglect to
do their duties in the premises, the same being thereof convicted before her
Majesty's privy Counsel, or such as they shall appoint to examine the default,
shall be committed to prison for their offense, and there remain the space of
forty days, or for redemption of some part of their imprisonment, shall pay
to the infourmer such fine as shall be set by them before whom they shall be
convicted, besides such further punishment as upon the greatness of the
offense shall be thought meet by her Majesty's privy Counsel, or the Lord
Steward, or Lord Chaumberlayne and Vize Chaumberlayne to be ordered. And this
order her Majesty will have observed until the same shall be revoked by open
Proclamation. For the speedy occasion whereof to be given by the ceassyng of the
plague, Almighty God is to be with daily prayers called upon.

Given at our Castle of Windsor the third day of October, the eleventh year of
our reign. 1569. God save the Queen.

Printers to the Queens Majesty.
