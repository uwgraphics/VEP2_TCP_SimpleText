A Proclamation inhibiting all persons to repair to His Majesty for cure of
the Disease called, The Kings Evil, until Michaelmas next.
WHereas His Majesty by his Proclamation in July last, did prescribe the times
of Michaelmas and Easter, for presenting to Him for cure such persons as were
affected with the Disease called, The Kings Evil: which His Majesty out of
His gracious and pious disposition to relieve their distresses, was wi^ling now
at Easter accordingly to have done; Yet foreseeing the danger that may arise as
well to His sacred Person, as otherwise, by the concurse of diseased people
from all parts of the Realm to His Majesty's Court, especially at this present
time, when as the infection of the Plague is discovered and broken out in some
places of the Kingdom; His Majesty therefore timely to prevent the dangers
thereof, as well to his own Person, as to his people, does hereby publish His
Royal Pleasure to be, And also straightly charge and commands, That no
person or persons whatsoever, do presume to repair to His Majesty's Court to
be healed of that Disease at Easter now next coming; But do wholly forbear
the same, until the Feast to Saint Michael the Archangel next following,
(unless His Majesty shall hereafter declare any shorter time for that
purpose) upon pain of His Majesty's high Indignation, and to be punished with
all severity as Offenders in so high a nature. And His Majesty does straightly
charge and command all Justices of Prace, Majors, Bailiffes, Constables,
Headboroughs, and other His Officers and Ministers whatsoever whom it may
concern, That they make stay of as many as they find traveling or preparing
themselves to His Majesty for Cure, and that they suffer no persons whatsoever
to make their resort to His Majesty's Court now at Easter next for that end, As
they tender His Majesty's pleasure, and will answer the contrary at their
uttermost perils.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster, the seventh day of April, in the twelfth
year of Our Reign.
