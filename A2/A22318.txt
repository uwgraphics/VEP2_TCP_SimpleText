A Proclamation for the restraint of serving of Fee Dear.
FOrasmuch as We take notice from all parts of this Kingdom, that this last
hard winter has caused a great destruction of great numbers of Our Dear, both
of Read and Fallow, in all Our Parkes, Forests, and Chaces, and that it is to
be doubted, those which have escaped the extremity of the weather, are so
weakened and surfeyted by the same, as they will hardly hold out the next
winter; Soas, if there be not some course taken how they may be restored
again, and preserved, Our grounds will not be supplied a long time: We, for
remedy thereof, have thought fit to make stay of the serving of all Fee Dear,
and all Dear by warrants, as well to Our Justices in Air of Our Forests, both
on this side, and beyond Trent, and to all other Our Officers great and small,
as also Leiutenants, Rangers, Verdurers and Keepers, that, either by Custom,
by pretense of their Offices, or by any other warrant whatsoever, do claim to
have any Fee Dear, either within the survey of Our Exthequer, or of Our Duchy
of Lancaster. And to the end that Our said Justices in Air, and all other Our
Officers, clayming right of Fee Dear, and all Our Leiutenants, Rangers,
Verdurers, Keepers, and all other Our Officers of any Our Forests, Parkes, or
Chaces, may the more speedily take knowledge of this Our pleasure, We have
likewise thought good to make the same known unto them by this public
signification; Whereby We do straightly charge and command, as well Our Justices
in Air beyond, and on this side Trent, and all Officers and Ministers, as well
within the survey of Our Exchequer, as of Our Duchy of Lancaster, of what
degree soever, and all Leiutenants, Rangers, Verdurers, Forresters, Keepers,
and Officers, in any Our Forests, Chaces, or Parkes, That they do forbear to
give out their Warrants for any Dear, Read or Fallowe, claimed by them as
Fees incident to their Offices and places; And do likewise will and command all
Keepers and Vnder-keepers, to whom the serving of such Warrants do appertain,
either of Red Dear, or Fallowe, That they shall not serve this year any Fee
Dear to any of the Officers before mentioned, or to any other, demanding
Dear, by what Warrant soever, except only by Warrant under Our own hand or
Signet, as they will answer to us upon peril of our displeasure.

Given at Our Court at Theobalds, the second day of May, in the two and
twentieth yeereof Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
