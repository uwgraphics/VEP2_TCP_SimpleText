A Proclamation concerning Fee Dear.
WHereas We are informed, that there are sundry that under pretense of their
Offices do challenge to have Fee Dear both in Summer and Winter out of Our
Forests, Chaces and Parkes, and upon that pretext not grounded in Law, they
send their Warrants, as if Dear were due to them; For that We are satisfied by
Our learned Counsel and otherwise, that there is no such right belonging to
any Subject, but only to our who Justices of Oyer and Terminer of Our
Forests, the one on this side Trent, and the other beyond: Therefore We do
straightly charge and command, as well that no person do presume to send any
Warrant unto any Our Forests, Chaces and Parkes, upon pretense of any such
right, as all Lieutenants, Wardens or other Officers of Our Forests, Chaces
and Parkes, that they serve no Warrants of any, but only of Our said Justices
of Our Forests, Chaces and Parkes, and of such as have right by being
Lieutenants or either principal Officers of the Forests, which of right have
it by the allowance of the Justices of Our Forests, according to the Law of
the Forest. And if any shall either send or serve contrary to this Our
Declaration of Our pleasure, We shall, as We have cause, make them feel Our
displeasure.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the eighteenth day of January, in the
fourteenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
