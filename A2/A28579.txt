LONDON, Printed for Henry Brom, at the Gun in Ivy-lane, 1664.

To the Honorable Colonel Henry Wallop OF Farl^y-wallop in the County of
Southampton.
SIR,
THough I may appear too like one of Those, Who (belying their own
Inclinations, and Friends impor^unities) are Livery'd abroad in Black and White
(and not their proper Colors) Yet Sr, give me leave to tell You, That mine
only inducement and design herein) was and is, to let the World know, There is
no One does more Glory in his Title of Devout Honourer of your Excellencies,
than

SIR, Your for ever humble Servant, H.B.

To the INGENIOUS --
IF thou will read so; if not so: it is so, so, and so Farewell.

Thine upon liking H. B.

To mine Ingenious FRIEND Mr. Henry Bold, etc.
MY drooping Muse awak^n'd by your Pen
And noble Fancy,'s raised to life again.
And thus regenerate, presents as Due,
The First Fruits, of her second Birth to You.
The Graces usher, Fair Example, brings
Virtue with Courage, and all Noble Things
A generous Mind can wish if I improve,
It is by imitating You, I love.
Your serious Muse and your Joc^se c^mbine
To complement each other in each line
Audacem Deus ipse juvat's very well,
Made true in Thee, where all the Muses dwell.
Henry Sanderson Esquire

To my dear BROTHER Mr. H.B. on his Poems.
Harry,
SInce Soldier, called thy Brother, Captain
My fmancy has not so much Air been wrapped in,
As when the amorous couch and lovelick't Bolster
Have made me among the Muses keep an old stir;
Since Bilbo-Blade has put fist out of order
I nere approached Parnassus, (scarce the Border)
So then thou must not look that I should praise
In that Emphatick strein we now-adays see (thee
Yet I have read thy Lines, can judge and know 'em
That few or none) have writ so quaint a Poem.
And he that has Design the like to write now,
Listen to mine Advice, I Will set him right how:
Let him be so much Merchant (cause I doubt it)
TO ensure his Paper 'ere he go about it.
And if the Cargo of his Wit be lost
He Will have it again, (the Liquour's in the Toast)
Thou therefore may be sure none can abuse
The generous fancy of thy frolique Muse;
For he that writes to imitate thy Vein
May write, and keep the paper for his Pain.
As He that thought to write like Princely Spencer,
Proved in his Faculty, a very Fencer:
No more to be compared then Trigg to Frazier
O^ Turvy-Tinker to an Acon-Brazier.
In their own sphere, thou writ'st to King and Court too:
The next Page makes the Amorous Ladies sport too.
If soldier throw off sword and fall to drink,
Here Is that will match his Humor too, I think.
The willow'd Lover apt to howl and whimper
At reading thee begins to smile and simper.
And every Humour's fancied so completely
I cannot say it is boldly done but neatly.
William Bold Esquire

To my dear Brother Mr. H. B.
REading thine unstrained Verse, oh how it rue'th,
That I^ue followed Crambo from my youth!
And that I never consorted much with Those
Who use what ever's spoke, to clink in the Close:
Had I done so, by this, I Would had the honor Sir,
TO have Rhym'd like him that nickt Nebuchadonosor
And then I wiss, I had not thus been puzzeld
To make Verse chyme, as if Dame Muse were muzzled;
Did so me tooth and nail ( Hall) foot and leg,
Thou Would swear my Worship were at mumble peg,
It comes so hard -- Why sure 'twill vex ones Gizzard
To hunt for Rhyme like me, from A to izzard,
When started too, and I think brought about,
It Is ten to One there wants a foot --
And then to inch it out, and make it go,
I Am fain to say (Pox out!) Dear Hall) or so.
Sometime my Brain's asleep, and words will not troul
Longer (forsooth) then I do claw my Poul:
And prithee (Hall) what Muse can set a stitch,
When I am forced to scratch where't does not itch?
Yet since rich Masks their Whifflers have who come
Not to set off the Show, but make it Room:
So since the attir'st thy self, and putt'st on Sandal
To walk abroad in the World, I Will hold the Candle,
And like a Whiffler too, if any come,
And ask what are thy Virtues, answer- Mum;
As being conscious I should do thee wrong
More by my Talk than holding of my Tongue.
Yet if to Court or Droll in Tune and Mode
The Gallant, would be (fain) put in a rode,
Let him bestow (let us see) for the device on it
Look! I was going to tell him what is the Price on it;
But He (in time) as well as Setter forth,
Will find thy Book can never be sold to the worth.
Norton Bold C.C.C. Oxon. S.

(...) Upon the Author and his Poems.
NOt that I do, (as Vulgar Scriblers can)
Dictate a squint, or to s^t forth the Man
To the best, (as Common Painters use to do,)
Strive to m^k^ handsome, though they do not true,
No; General Applause does plainly show it,
No Age, e're gloried in so quaint a Poet:
For whom, the Muses, and the Graces strove,
Which should deserve him best, to be their Love:
At length they drew the match, (yet left it fair:)
And each compounded in him, for a share:
So that He Is wholly theirs; (and let him be!)
Nor do I envy them their Destiny;
But, this I Will tell the World, their choice is such;
All, may admire, but cannot praise too much.
Here, Jupiter his Mastresses may kiss,
And win without a Metamorphosis.
Cupid, the sole Commander of our Hearts,
Complies with thee, to make his golden Darts:
But let him try his skill, how'ere it prove,
That he wounds Hearts, it is thou must make them love.
J. Moyle of the Inner Temple Esquire

To his ingenious FRIEND Mr. Henry Bold on his Poems.
MY praise is insignificant, for I
Am not grown old enough in poetry;
Nor is my name yet up enough to engage
The opinion of this super^^itious age.
But if I say, I like what you have writ,
Some other, that believes himself a Wit,
May differ from me in Opinion. So
To find the truth, we must to poling go.
Now in this envy'ous and ill-natured time,
Verse is a scandal, and to print a crime.
In this half-witted and ungrateful Town
The most (that is the worst) will cry thee down
For those three heinous crimes, Truth, Wit, and Verse;
And swear it is thy Vice to meddle with theirs.
So I Will suspend Encomiums, and transmit
Those to thy book, which praises thee and it.
For Poets to praise Poets is as bad,
As if one madman said anothe'rs mad,
And (to say truth) men did the Muse suborn,
To cl^w a friend, or else to serve a turn;
Good Verse and bad were praised with equal wit
Just as the praiser on the humor hit.
Encomiums like (...) Sermons grew,
All cared how well to speak, but none how true.
The Knave and Dunce with both of us did speed
As the Poets humor'd, or the Levite fee'd.
This made wise Readers all our votes despise,
And their contempt made future writers wise.
To praise friends wits is out of fashion grown,
We only now break jests to show our own.
ALEX. BROM.

To the ingenious Mr. Henry Bold on his publishing his Poems.
THE Press (of late) became as common
As Barbers-Chair or naughty Woman,
When all fanatique Humors were,
Frequently broached, as Ale or Beer:
But safe in neither, such a Crowd
Of Ale and History being allowed;
A Fresh-man or an elder Brother
Was poisoned straight by one or the other.
Had these been extant then, they had thought
Thy Nectar of the common Draught,
Like those who little skilled in Wine,
Applaud a Tavern for the Sign.
And hang their gross Opinions there
That Sack with Lime to them is rare:
Just as the Drunken Common Sewer
Does with an even throat devour
All that is sent to it, so did They
Erst swallow Books, a greedy way!
But 'twas as Mariott when he feasted,
Neither half chewed nor half-digested.
Kind Providence which thought that Fate
Unfit for thee, ordained thy date
From this blessed Age grown now so clear
That stead of Glowworms Stars appear,
And glorious too, but when all is done,
It Is thou that art Apollo's Son.
But 'cause I Love, I write, and not to praise,
He must deserve, is fit to give thee Bays.
V. Oldis.

POEMS.
SONG I.
1.
THou Glorious Envy, of the Nation,
Whose renowned Graces,
Far transcend the Fancies,
Of a Lovers Brain.
Whose blooming Cheeks out-vy Carnation,
While thy Look surpasses,
Those resplendent Glances,
A^ High-noon do reign.
Thy Curious Locks, so nicely curled;
Their Every Hair,
Our Souls ensnare.
And by a sweet Surprisal,
Captive all the World.
The Melting Corals of thy Lips,
Distill such Balm,
That in the quame.
Of a Heart breaking Mistress,
He revives that Sipps.
2.
Thy Graceful Motion, and Behavior,
Might excuse a Beauty,
Less in debt to Nature,
Then thy fayrer Face.
Where Lovely Airs, and Comely Favor
Do Conjure a Duty,
To Adore your Feature,
Dwells upon your Place.
The flowery sweets thy Breasts do wear,
Shall never consume,
Their rich perfume.
But make a lasting Summer,
Flourish all your Year.
Between whose Hills the Boy does lie,
And exercise,
His Tyrannies.
Yet joys us, that he does his
Murders handsomely.
3.
He Is blessed who climbs that swelling Mountain,
In whose gloomy Valley,
Sits the Queen of Pleasure,
In her Royal Fort!
Bathed, in the streams oth' Odorous Fountain,
Whence full joys do sally,
In over flowing Measure,
For the Amorous Sport.
Where circling in a Genial Kiss,
I would control,
Disputes of the School:
And thence maintain a real,
Metempsychosis:
But naught can her Affection move,
Though Jove to boot,
Should Court her to it,
Florilla wants nothing,
To be Love but Love.
SONG II.
1.
LOve, let me have my Mistress such,
(If I must needs have One,)
Whose Metal will endure the Touch,
Whose Touch will try the Stone!
Let her have sense I ask no more,
A Woman's Reason I abhor!
2.
Her noon like Eyes should shine so Clear,
And be so fixed on Mine,
The Salamander Babies there,
Should Kindle and Entwine,
Then Look me Dead, that Men may swea^
There is no Basilick but Her,
3.
If the upper Manna-Lips distill,
The Sweets of Every food,
To Sauce the Appetite (not fill)
The Lover Limbeck's good:
To relish which, let Love invent,
A way to Crane his Instrument.
4.
The Thrilloes of her Siren Noice,
Should Charm an Adders Ear;
And were she Echoed all to Voice,
I Would be in Love with Her:
To be Chamaeleon'd who would care,
So he might juncate on such Air.
5.
I Would have her Panther in her Breath;
And Phaenix in her Breast,
The Valleys that are Underneath,
The Spicery of the East:
I Would have Her without much a do,
But Lo! I Would have her Naked too:
In spite of Fates, thus would I lie
Mandrackt to all Eternity.
SONG III.
1.
MIne own Basina come a long,
The Subject of my Song.
For thee I long:
And know my Pretty sweetness: know
Since thou love me,
I welcome nothing in the World but Thee.
2.
Unveyle those Damask Cheeks of Thine,
Where every graceful Line,
Is so Divine,
That were, I to receive my Death,
By thy Fair Eye,
I Would Court it, buried in your Pits to lie.
3.
Yet cloud thy Face, thy Veil keep on!
If all should gaze thereon,
They were undone:
For it may chance thy random Darts
Will kill them too.
Whom I Would not Wish so Good a Death unto.
4.
Display thine Arms: thy Wealth, unfold!
While like to Jove of old,
In Liquid Gold.
I do Carouse it in Lov's Bowl
To such a Bliss,
Our Souls shall mingle while our bodies Kiss.
5.
Thus will we Live, thus will we Love,
Till even the gods above,
Shall Envious prove:
And after Death we will Joy as They
Till that appear,
We Will have Elysium here, as they have there.
SONG IV.
1.
CHloris forbear a While,
Do not over joy me,
Urge not another Smile
Lest it Destroy me.
That Beauty pleases most,
And is Best taking
Which soon is Won, soon lost
Kind, yet forsaking.
I Love a Coming Lady faith! I do!
But now and then, I Would have her scornful too.
2.
Ore cloud those Eyes of thine,
Bo-peepe thy Features
Warm with an April shine,
Scorch not thy Creatures:
Still to display thy Ware
Still to be fooling,
Argues how rude you are
In Cupides Schooling
Disdain begets a Suit, Scorn draws us nigh,
It Is cause I would, and cannot, makes me Try.
3.
Fairest, I Would have the^ Wise,
When Gallants view thee.
And Court, do thou despise;
Fly, they will pursue thee,
Fasts move an Appetite,
Make Hunger greater
Who Is stinted of Delight,
Falls to it the better.
Be Kind and Coy by turns, be calm and rough!
And buckle now and then, and that is enough.
SONG V.
1.
I Will Swear they Lie, who say they Love,
One only Beauteous Face,
He Is Mad (or Honest) does not prove
A Score in three days space.
I Am a la mode My self; pretend that I
Am here all-over Love and there could Dye.
When Faith! there is no such matter seriously!
2.
Most earnest Love is but in jest,
I Ladys are cheated all:
I Have now a hundred Girls, at least,
That do me Servant call:
I Have Courted them ali^e, have vowed and sworn
My flames of Love a like, for All did ^urn:
When it is for Her, who best will serve my Turn.
3.
And yet, I think my Love's as True,
As Constant every way,
As their's, who color for it in Blew,
And Cupid's prizes play.
Show me the Lad, who best Loves Feat ca^ D^
I Will Do as much as He (perhaps More too)
Yet never could Love, above an hour, or so.
SONG VI.
1.
WHat though thy Feature,
Fairest Creature,
Passes curious fancy far.
And colored Roses,
(Cupids Posees,)
Do denounce a second War.
Though never so rare,
Thy Beauties are,
They shall not mine Affection win,
Let her I woe,
Be willing too,
And Love me, I Will Love Her again!
2.
Black Eyes are loathing,
Red Lips nothing,
Nor can busy Toying Do It;
Or fill the Measure,
Of Love's Pleasure
Lest the give her mind unto't.
^et Her I Court,
Be mad oth' sport,
And Love, and want on freedom show,
I hate a Maid;
That seems afraid,
And cares not where she Does or No.
SONG VII.
1.
FAith do but say the Word and I am gone,
I can as soon forego,
Mine easy suit,
As thou would have it so!
It Is but a vain persuite,
And little fruit:
In Lovers Games, when if the best be Won,
We come but Loosers off, when all is done.
2.
Pox on'^! I Have Loved thee, now, this hour or two.
And shall I nothing get:
Still fast and Pray,
Then would w'had never met!
Never blush! but come away!
Love, Lov's no stay:
I Love, it is true; but let me tell thee too
I do not Love to make so much a do.
SONG VIII.
1.
MAdam, You Are not the first I Have Loved
Nor shall you be the last,
It Is ten to one, but I have proved
As fair (perhaps as chaste.)
2.
And yet, to tell the pains I Have lost,
Their humor still was such,
It Is true, a little time they would cost;
But faith, it was not much!
3.
I never remember that I spent
Above a month, or so,
To Win a Girl with Complement,
And there is the most a do.
4.
No! I have got the trick on it now,
And troth! I dare a verre,
I could do her as well as you,
And you as soon as her.
5.
Then pry'thee! Love! be coy no more!
Smooth off, and be not rough,
Say but thou never did before,
And then it is well enough.
6.
None e're shall know what we have done,
I Will pass my promise for it,
Only be quick, and let us be gone
And there is and end oth' sport.
SONG IX.
1.
THe Suns of Beauty never had shone
But to give light to more then one.
Or if to Love me, were a Sin
I Am Damned to Love thee, thus again:
But Love and thoughts, are free.
Neither may they be enclosed, or confined
To any special object, but unto the General kind:
So after single dainties,
If our Appetite be good we may cal^,
And, (so we do not surfeit) fit and taste and eat of all.
2.
Since thy bright eyes have such an art
With every glance to win a Heart,
You wrong your Beauties and your Loves
If what you get you do not prove.
Your winnings thus are losses,
And your Forces but in vain you employ
If, when you gain a conquest you do not the same enjoy,
And no Commander ever,
When, the Rebel foes were slain, or did yield,
But, to reward the Soldiers, gave the plunder of the field.
3.
Love is no Pidler at his Meat,
The more he feasts, the more he will eat!
Then spend not, all that Beauty's store,
On one, might serve a thousand more:
While thy Virgin springs are running,
What matter, who comes there, or who first,
With your cooling Waters, does allay his eager thirst.
Then Dearest, since thou Love me,
Let us reap the fruits of Love, and enjoy:
It Is treason to our Natures, for to Love, and to be Coy.
SONG X.
1.
SInce it is the pleasure, of thine Eyes,
To Kill me, with Love's Ty^annize,
Faith use me kindly! let me dye,
The fairest death! Thy smiling Eye
Shall give the Wound, and all true Lovers shall
Triumph at such a blessed Funeral.
2.
And yet alas! who'd think that she,
Should sin so high, to Murder me!
But Heaven will quit her and disguise
The Fact, with name of sacrifice.
This only of the gods I will implore,
That dead, I may but Love her, as before.
SONG XI,
1.
ANd pry'thee why ( Florella) do thou move
My forward Heart, not to proceed in Love?
Alas! it cannot be
My Love to thee
Divinest she,
Burns with a fire
Cannot breath high.
Nor shall expire:
For should I once this high blown flame let fall,
My warned Heart,
Being taught the Smart
Would learn the Art
Never to love at all
2.
Perhaps 'twas pity moved thee to Complain,
And thou might think, so, to redress my pain,
But oh! good faith not I!
I Will never try
That Remedy;
But will Endure,
Love's Calenture,
And not thy Cure:
For know; my Love soars with so high a wing,
It Is pride in me,
Rather to be
A slave to thee
Then be Another's King.
3.
Then chide not (dearest Fair) my passions heat?
Soldiers in Love, must never make retreat:
What though the fates decree,
Thou must not be,
A mate for me:
And Love conspire,
To cheat desire,
With Single fire.
Yet let me burn and dye; that I may see,
What Joys they prove,
In The Elyzian Grove,
That Over-love.
And dye for such, as thee.
SONG XII.
1.
STay small Sinner,
Cease thy suite!
If thy fair Words, cannot win her,
Thou will never bring her to it:
It Is not all thy wiles can Do It.
Lest of her own Accord she will Loving be,
Faith! let her go! she is not a Wench for thee.
2.
E'ne let her go!
There are more,
That now, perhaps, would gladly do:
Thou may choose of half a score,
Whilst confined in midst of store:
It Is merely Dotage, and will Madness prove,
Pox! Where she cannot like, she will not love.
SONG XIII,
1.
PRoud (Venus now at last) resign,
Thy long usurped Place,
And seat Florilla on that shrine,
Who claims the chiefer grace;
Whilst quickened with the hallowed fire,
Of chaste desire,
All, toward thine Altar, move
And each man dies
A Sacrifice
To thee, the Queen of Love.
2.
Venus! alas poor silly Queen!
One god of love brought forth,
Which never could see, nor e're was seen,
Yet much extolled her Worth:
But thousand real Cupids lie,
In my Faire's Eye,
And aim, at every Heart,
Whose Hairs do grow,
To string your Bow,
And every Beame's a Dart.
3.
Apelles (once) to pourtract out
That Dame, did, for her sake,
Go ransack half the world throughout,
And plundered features take,
But my sweet love is more Divine,
Each graceful Line,
Her nobler Parts do bear,
And should you seek,
Upon her Cheek
There Is never a Mole grows there.
4.
Yet ( Mother Venus) with your Son,
If you can, One thing do,
You shall again ascend the Throne,
And I will homage you:
Go whip your Boy, and let him try
His Archery,
If my Dear, wounded prove,
You shall redeem
Your self the Queen
And Him, the god of Love.
SONG XIV.
1.
IDle Sinner,
Sigh no more!
And I Will inform thee,
Of an Easier way to win her,
Then thou try'dst before:
Sullen Beauty
Must not move
Thee, in a whining
Over weening piece of Duty
To express thy Love:
But if,
E're thou mean, to have her,
At thy fancies suit,
Presume upon her favor,
Kiss, and put her to it,
And (trust me) that will Do It.
Or else,
Tope a Glass of Claret,
Love, and hug thy friend,
For^ Mistre^s, care not for it!
Till thou see it mend,
(If never) there is an End.
SONG XV.
1.
RAre Creature! Since thy Graces have,
The power to Kill, and Art to Save,
(Sweet!) let thy Beauties make my Heart
A Patient, to your Mystic Art!
Thine Instruments, I will Endure.
Since, that, which makes the wound, can Cure.
2.
Come! let thy locks (whose every Hair
A willing Lover does ensnare)
Fetter my Soul, in those soft Chains,
Where Beauty linked with Love, remains!
And keep me bound, that I may be
Thy Prisoner, yet at Liberty.
3.
Thy sprightful Eyes (whose every Dart)
Has force, to Kill (or Save a Heart)
If they shoot frowns on me (my fair)
I can but languish in despair,
Second them, with a smile, 'twill move
A faith in me, 'twas but in Love.
4.
Or should thou, suffer me to sip,
The flowing Nectar, from thy Lip,
Whose sovereign drops, derived from thence
(Can quicken, both the Soul, and sense)
That bliss, would soon, revive again,
Him, (whom before) thine Fyes, had slain
5.
Thy Curious Breasts, those pretty things
Whiter, then Down of Cupids wings;
If through, thy Winter Heart, they be
Frozen, ^o joy- chains, for me,
Let love, but Touch them, you shall see,
Those fetters melt, while I am free.
6.
Or might I, lulled by love's sweet charms,
Lodge, within thy folded Arms,
Where I might find, and taste, and prove,
The Joys, the sweets, the sports of Love;
Locked, in those bands, I there should be
Proud, of my sweet captivity.
7.
Then ( Dearest) since it is Cupids will,
That you should heal, with what you kill;
Say! how can thou cure, my smart,
That have robbed me, of my heart!
This is the best way, I can tell,
Give thine in Change, and all is well.
SONG XVI.
1.
BE not Distrustful (Precious love)
Of my true Zeal and Constancy!
Nor think, another Saint, can move,
My settled faith, from thine Idolatry!
2.
^overaign of Souls! do not repay
Protested Love, with Jealousy!
To thee mine Oraisons I pay,
And am become, Love's constant V^tary.
3.
^hile Cupid and his Priests attend,
At this same holy Exercise,
And to your Glorious beauties send,
My Heart, a Flaming sacrifice.
SONG XVII,
1.
I Had a Love, a month a go,
I Wooed, as I were madd,
And, to say truth, as handsome too,
As you would wish, to have had:
But how it comes about,
I cannot tell,
I Have e'ne forgot the face,
And know not well,
Where was the Place,
Her Beauty, or her Grace,
Did ever dwell.
2.
And yet; I Have had a scurvy kind
Of fancy, to this Love,
Which some Girls, call, a constant mind
And say, I faithful prove:
Sure I Am too hot to hold,
Yet, when I spy,
A high and stately brow,
Whose Majesty,
Commands us bow,
To Homage, Oh! even now
(Me thinks) I Would Dye.
3.
But out upon it! I Have found the cause,
And know the reason, why
I cannot obey femal Laws,
Nor quit my Liberty:
^here Honor keeps the Gate,
And does deny
To such, as me, or you,
The Courtesy,
To come and go,
And the other Knickknack too
Farewell! say I!
SONG XVIII.
1.
FAir, give me leave, to Love,
Or Love to Leave,
^he suit, my gentle hopes, promove
Your wilder scorns deceive,
I swear, by those bright Eyes,
(Love's Heavenly Mysteries)
And by those Downs of Snow,
I Am still Resolved to Love.
What shall I do?
Shall not my Prayers, your pity move
To Love me too?
Or must thine Eyes,
Still exercise,
Their Tyranise,
And I, (sad I) neglected go?
2.
They must, they must; I would
Not have her Love
Upon such terms, now, though she could
My high Desires approve,
It Is more then happiness
To have the fair success
To Love, and only so.
I hate a mutual heat?
It spoils the sport,
And so disrellishes the feat
We care not for it.
If my desire,
Can but aspire,
Her, to Admire,
I care not wher'e she will Love, or not.
SONG XIX.
1.
WEll! go thy ways!
If e're, I Love again,
As I have Loved before,
To Woe a Yoke of Days,
Yet never know what nor when,
I Will give thee leave, to hate me then,
And never Love no more.
2.
I could make shift,
To sit, an hour, and sport;
(But not to increase that score)
Or sigh, at a dead lift,
But, if I longer Court
Then, I shall see good reason, for it,
Faith! never trust me more.
Yet still be nice!
Usurp the power thou have!
Deny, as heretofore!
Vpho'd thy former price!
The art Dear, because thou art chaste:
For should thou now, prove, cheap at last,
I Would never Love thee, more.
SONG XX,
1.
COme, come, away!
No Delay
To our wished delight!
Sweet quickly have, unto thy greedy Lover!
Throw, throw aside
What may hide,
The inquisitive sight!
I Will be the only Veil that shall thee Cover:
And We,
Will both agree,
And thou shall see,
How we the time abuse,
To trifle it away, with empty wishes,
Fond Dreams,
Are Childish theams,
Wherein the creams
Oth' sport, we always loose,
And do Neglect the sweeter after blisses.
2.
Come! do not Frown!
Lay thee down!
It Is a thing must be done!
Take off thy hand-good faith! it is wondrous pretty?
Oh! what a coil!
And a spoil!
E're this Fort could be Won!
Nay, though thou cry, or bleed I dare not pity:
And now,
I Will show thee how
Thy Dad, did Do,
And score up, wealthy Sums
Of Kisses, on thy Lips, to heighten pleasure:
Again!
I cannot refrain,
I fear no pain,
Oh! now, it comes, it comes!
It Is all, thine own, thou shall have standing measure.
SONG XXI.
1.
WHy (Fair one) do thou ask of me,
The Cause I burn in Love, for thee,
From fire (we know) the Flames arise,
So, if thine Eyes,
Can kindle, with your beam,
The flames possessed,
Within my Breast,
Sweet! ask not me but them.
2.
Unriddle all the Mysteries,
The secret Arts and Trecheries,
Which practiced are, in the Paphian Cell,
And when you tell
Me, what your cause, may be,
I then may show,
Some reason too,
Why it is, I burn for thee.
3.
Unteach thy Lips, unlearn thine Eyes
Their fair Deluding Sorceries,
And if thy Beauties, this can do,
And blind, me too,
My living flame soon dies,
If not, my Fire,
Can never Expire,
Whilst Nature lends us Eyes.
SONG XXII. On the first sight of the Lady M.W. in St. Mary's Church Oxon.
1.
POx take this learning! burn these books
There Is a Ladies powerful looks
Draw, my Thoughts to fix upon,
Her Divine perfection:
Whose bright Eyes do guild the day
Whilst enlightened, by your Ray
Love can fly no other way.
2.
When from the Temple's sacred sh^ine
She did glance her Eyes, on mine,
Cupid there, did light his Dart,
To inflame my Tender heart:
Pulpit Thunder could not move,
Eyes, or thoughts, resolved to prove,
No Religion sweet, but Love.
3.
While my senses here do Jarre,
Love contrives a double War,
Through mine Eyes, he throws his Dart,
Through mine Ears, assaults my Heart
So this Angel, charmed mine Ear,
With her Singing, that I swear,
Those above might rival her.
4.
But alas! Those Suns are gone!
And that Heavenly musi^k done!
Yet return those murdering Eyes,
To behold your Sacrifice!
Nor, think I, thou joy'st to see
Love- sick-Souls should die for thee:
But, to Sweeten death for me.
5.
Or if that Lady, in whose Breast,
My fled Heart, is lodged a Guest,
Will Exchange (but Oh! I fear
Here Is, is strayed, some other where)
I may Live; if not; I dye,
Martyr, to her Diety,
To increase, her Victory.
6.
Her a brown Hair, a snare might prove,
To entangle captive Jove:
In the Circles of her Eye,
Cupids fettered Rebels lie:
Would thou know, who th^s might be
That has stolen, my Heart, from me?
These few marks will say, it is she.
SONG XXIII.
1.
FAith! tell me, Chloris pry'thee do!
(I Will do as much, for thee,)
Why? when I would, thou, still, say No?
Thou will, and yet, thou will not too.
Thou Love the sport, I Am sure, if thou wilt be
Forward, as I, thou art like to have none, for me.
2.
Consider't (little Fool!) be wise!
I know the subtilty:
That which you, now so highly prize,
When, out oth' humor, I despise.
It Is merely dullness? and vain foppery?
If, thou have a mind to it speak or faith not I.
3.
And, why not, this, at first, as last?
I knew thy mind was to it:
No reason, still, to pray, and fast:
Pined Love, must feast, when that is past.
Come! Come! be wiser against another suit!
And never make many words! but pry'thee Do It!
SONG XXIV.
1.
COme Kiss me (sweet) let us banquet on delight!
And teach Love, how to surfeit! Kiss again!
You must spend free, to sat his Appetite
Nay be no niggard! what is nine or ten?
Love soon digests these (should you thousands score)
And only, whets his stomach, still, for more.
2.
I Will taste those Apples in thine Autumn cheek,
The cherries, of thy Lips, suffice not me:
Those are not single Dainties, Love does seek
I mean to ravish all the sweets of thee:
The Taste, to other senses cannot dispense;
I must have sweets, for every sweet of sense.
3.
I Will Tou^h, those downy hills, where Love with his Bow,
Lies, in the valley on a bed of spice,
Over which my busy band, shall wandering go,
And search out Cupit, lurkt in's Paradise:
Thence, to thy ^ower of Honey suckles where,
Venus, shall Court, my stay, to bath with Her.
4.
Then shall I smell, sent from those Lips of thine,
A scent more sweet, then sallied from the Trees.
Of Balm, in Eden; kindlier breathed, on mine,
Then winds, which whistle Phaenix Exequies:
Or Frankincense for Jove, that is gently sweat,
From all your Beauties, through a virtual heat.
5.
Now, will I hear, by thine harmonious voice
Such moving accents, as might teach the Spears,
A choicer Music and whose powerful noice
Perforce, acts Raps, on Hearts and Charms all Ears:
Which, when it has turned us stones, it then can do,
As Orpheus did, and make us Dancers, too.
6.
Then will I fix mine Eyes, on thee (my dear)
And nail them, to thy Beauties; let thine Eye,
Dart all the shafts of Cupid, I Will not fear,
But stand thy mark: 'twere happy so to Dye!
Whereon, could I but gaze, my death, to see
I Would be Enamored, of Mortality.
7.
But say ( Dear Heart!) can Love, be sated so
It Is true, the senses, thus, are singly pleas^d,
But to feast him, alas! 'twill nothing do!
A greedy Lovers hunger never is eased:
Since then, for all sweets, Love, at once, dot^ call
Give me not these alone, but give me all.
SONG XXV.
1.
AWay! Chloris give over,
Insult on me, no more!
But let thine Fie,
Now, bid a Kingdom dye
And in their funeral flames, thy powers adore.
And when
Thou can not find,
A nobler mind,
Then mine,
Love's deaths, to prove,
Let pity move
Thee, to retire,
And quench desire
With mutual flames, to Crown my Love.
2.
Alas! no Triumph lies,
In taking single prize,
Thine Honor's staind,
Though thou have the Baggage gained,
And let'st an Army escape thy victories:
To thee,
The thing's the same
An Host to have taken
As me
Thine only Slave,
When thou can have
Artillery,
^n either Eye
Enough, to make the World a Grave.
SONG XXVI.
1.
It Is since thine Eyes,
Did mine, surprise
(Time vainly lent
And idly spent)
groce of hours and more;
And now grown kind,
Thou hop'st to find,
My giddy mind,
Inclined
As 'twas before!
It Is true: thy Beauties, once did take,
And for their sake,
I could have Loved thee too,
But, e'ne Adieu!
Give me the new!
For such, as you,
I Am not in the humor, now.
2.
Had thou been wise,
And not so nice.
The rich Treasures
Of Lov's pleasures
Thou might have called thine Own;
But, now, thou have lost,
What thou lov'd'st most,
And Fa^e, as just
Has crossed
Thy poor design:
For had thou taken me, in the Nick
For praise, or prick,
None, could have done, like me,
But fallen from that,
As thou know what,
I would be at,
I Have, naught to do with thee.
SONG XXVII.
1.
KNow (dearest beauty) those your Eyes,
Whose beams, you so like lightning, dart,
Have found, a passage, to my heart,
Which flaming, at Loves Altar, lies,
And (if not quenched with pity) dies.
2.
I Burn, yet you (hard Heart!) restrain
The Remedy, should cool my heat:
Oh do not, thus, my passion cheat!
Starve with a Frown, or heal my pain,
Or grant me, Love, or force, disdain!
3.
Torment not, thus insultingly,
A martyred, and a kneeling Soul!
Whose fault, you may with love control!
Through your preserving murdering Fie,
(Although it let me live) I dye.
4.
Yet see, Lov's deeper Mystery!
For, though these beams do scorch my heart
I glory, in the pleasing smart,
And in the flames, of your bright Eye,
Dying, to Live, I Would living, Dye.
SONG XXVIII.
1.
TUsh! Love or say thou will not
I Am content!
It Is, but an hour, idley spent,
And e'ne that is all,
Whatever Chance befall:
Mine Eager Love,
Admits, no lingering stay,
Nor will I vainly
Talk the Time away:
Tell me thou can not Love, and I Will be gon^
I Have other Mistresses, to wait upon.
2.
Give me the Buxom lass, whose
Warmer spright,
Likes, and Loves, at the first sight!
My mind requires
The Freedom, of desires,
Like busy Bees,
That Court, the youthful Field,
And ravish all
The sweets, the Virgins yield,
So Giddy Love, (soothed in his Wanton pla^
Takes, here, and there, a Touch, but the aw^^
SONG XXIX.
1.
I Have seen thy Face, and now can swear,
Nature has puzzled Art,
For Tongue, nor Pen, can never declare,
How sweet, how Fair thou art:
Whose high Divinity,
And awful Majesty,
All Gazers, so enthral,
That the Wild fire
Of my desire,
Dares not aspire,
To flame, to Love, unless thou say, It shall.
2.
How forcing are those Looks of thine!
How Charming are thine Eyes!
A thousand hearts kneel at thy shrine,
A ready sacrifice.
Each one painting with pain,
And longing, to be slain
By a smile from thy Brow:
No Sword or Shield,
Used in that Field,
Where all must yield
Or Dye, for Love, whether they will or no.
SONG XXX.
1.
FAir sinner cloud thine Eyes!
And shade, those hills of Snow!
Such proud, and open Enemies,
A world, may overthrow:
Those Eyes of thine (though never so Fair)
But Engines are,
To work, the Gazers smart,
And in thy Breasts (that sacred Land)
My wandering Hand,
Could never find thy Heart.
2.
Sweet Lips! forbear! no more!
I Court not for a Kiss;
Nay pry'thee (little Fool!) give over!
I Love thee, not, for this:
No, though my busy hand, the while,
In The Fortunate I'sle
Of pleasure, franchiz'd be,
Pox on it! or let my fancy have,
The thing I crave,
Or take it, who is will, for me.
SONG XXXI.
1.
MElina, dew'd the Roses of her Face,
With liquild Pearl, distlling from her Eye.
Which gave, such Orient luster, to the place
As does the milkie path, in starry Sky,
But when her Eyelids, let their Suns arise,
She made her sorrows, smile, then sigh't alas!
And often doubled, in her mournful Cries,
Fidelio! Dear Fidelio! it is for thee Melina Dies.
2.
Who (now my joy is budled up in dust)
Shall chide the follies of the nicer dames
Would he but have them yield, they must! they must!
It Was he, gave love and Beauty, all their flames:
His Hand, did whisper Love, his fluent Eyes,
Spoke, such fine Amors and so void of lust,
That now He Is gone, all ocher I despise
Fidelio! etc.
3.
Now may I sigh and count the times are past,
Suming up, every pleasure, with a Tear,
Which could they have a date that would but last,
None, e're had been so happy, as we were.
But Envious death, untimely, did surprise,
That sweet, which if a goddess, had imbrac'^
Sh'ad drowned the world, with Tears, at's obsequies.
Fidelio, Dear, etc.
4.
Was there a dearth, in the Elysian shade,
Of those rare Souls, that Courteous are and True
Or were their Ways of Love, so Common made,
That, they, must snatch thee hence, to learn them new?
'Twas so: but (sure) his spirit sullen lies,
Till I come thither, when (with triumph clad
We Will Teach, the gods, Loves holier mysteries,
Till then, I sigh Fidelio, etc.
5.
Break Heart! to let my Soul ascend!
And inquisition make, in the Air,
Amongst all the spirits, there attend,
To cull out, that is most white and Fair,
What was our Glory, now, their Pride,
And that is mine own, mine only friend,
There is no heaven, without him! so she cried
Fidelio! dear Fidelio! sigh't her last and died.
SONG XXXII.
1.
I Came, and Locked, and Liked, and Loved
And frolickt, in her Eye;
While, fair Florilla, well approved
The harmeless courtesy:
When, though my hopes were drowned, Love blazed,
And set on fire, my heart,
While I still gazed
On that, which caused my smart,
Nor could my Tongue,
declare the wrong
Whereby, I sadly know,
No pains above,
The griefs, they prove,
Who fall in Love,
And dare not say, they do.
2.
What Privilege takes the nicer she?
To me, the thing's all one
Whether of softer Wax she be,
Or of the Parian stone:
The sport's the same: then tell me, why
Fancy, should be so rude,
For to deny.
What i^, perhaps, as good*
From her that lends,
And freely spends
What, Nature, to her sent;
As from that Dame,
That counts it shame,
To play the game,
Which lost, she may repent.
SONG XXXIII, King Charles I. in Prison.
1.
A Dieu! (fair Love) Adieu!
And yet, farewell!
I never yet could tell,
How much, I honor You,
Nor You, never knew,
But yet Adieu!
A fairer Aim, invites me, now,
To rescue Majesty,
From Treachery,
Though well You know,
I Would ever do,
As much, for You,
Then, pry'thee let me go!
The sanguine sword a happy triumph brings
Avenging Ladies wrongs, but more a Kings
One Kiss! and then I Am gone!
Farewell Dear Heart!
Yet though I now depart,
When (once) the field, is won,
The War being done,
And Charles at home:
When we may freely sit, and tell
The harmless injuries,
Of Cupid's Tyrannies
What present Hell
The absent feel:
When all is well,
And we have no foes to quell,
But Cavaleers, secured, from lowed Alarmes,
^'le come and Quarter in thy peaceful Arms
SONG XXXIV,
1.
WHen first, I drove a Trade of Love,
(Learnt, before half my time, was out)
I thought, if, once I could remove
The sad Engagements thereabout,
The Hopes, Despaires and Jealousies,
(By some, nick-nam'd Love's Tyrannies)
^ soon, might ease, my miseries.
2.
Then strictly I besieged a Face,
(which I had summond long go)
And had design, to storm the place,
Or to surprise, the Female foe:
Prepared, Granado'd Oaths to do it,
Hayl shot, of Vows and Prayers (to boot)
But, see how soon, the Fool came to it!
3.
Without a parley to Compound,
Herself, and all, she did up yield,
I razed the fortress, to the Ground,
And became, master of the Field:
Fell to the spoil: purchased the Best
Of all the Jewels there possessed,
Restoring some, reserved the Rest.
4.
When I had done, what I could do,
And once, Love's fiery Try all over,
I Tamed my self, in the conquest too,
Repented, what was done before:
Thus thought I, when I this did see.
If in Love's Triumphs, no more pleasure be,
I Will still Beseige take in, who is well, for me.
SONG XXXV.
1.
LOw, as my fair Florilla's feet, I lie,
Raped, in an Ecstasy,
Till I am doomed, either to live or dye:
But oh! her curtain'd Eye, she does display
Whose every single Ray,
Makes me, a lasting everlasting day.
2.
Quickened by that enlivening Beam, I move
As when Antaeus strove,
From the Earth she treads, more vigorus I prove:
Although her Look, such virtual heat, had thrown
As might excuse the Sun,
From's Clubb, to the Act of Generation.
3.
Touched and Kissed my dearest fair, then stood good:
Resolved all to Blood,
That Passion, might have made it is action,
^ut Over loving turned to sin, for I
seemed, as designed thereby,
^eerly for to Increase and Multiply.
4.
^ill, from her Front, (Beaut'ys Majestique throne.
Fell something, like a Frown,
^Vhich bold desire, has checked and over-thrown.
Hence I like one, inspired, from above)
Will (spite of Cupid) prove,
Venus, the Queen, Florilla, Queen of Love.
SONG XXXVI.
1.
OH! stifle not longer, mine Eager desire!
Which in it is own flames Phaenix like, would expire!
And closer, then cockles, when, we shall entwine
(My dearest) I Will breath out, my Soul, into thine.
2.
Thy beauty, shall nourish, as well, as delight,
Our senses, to feast, and a longing invite;
VVhilest thou, in our dally^nce persumest the Air,
With thy Breath, that is as sweet, as thy Beauties are fair.
3.
Thy hand, at whose touch, I do melt, into bl^od,
Shall busily range, in an amorous mood,
Till, at length, being entranced by Lov's mystical charms.
Thou, boldly, resign'st thy self, into mine Arms.
4.
Where, having given over thy self, for a while,
That I may discover, thy for^unat Isle,
Whilst in Admiration, my Passions, are hurld,
In Embrasing, of thee, I do Compass, the world.
5.
Nor (sweetest) be pearl not, thy Diamond-eyes!
For the Treasure thou have lost, in becoming my prize!
Since Helena, she, as Immortal shall be
In the Records of Fame, as dull Penelope.
6.
Nor do thou Florilla, as Lucrece has done
Lay hands, on thy self! cause thy Tarquin is gone!
For when with rich Wines, I have heightened my Vein
Full fraught, I Will return to my dearest again,
And Lucrece, never died, for her being a Whore,
But, for thought, she should see her young Gallant no more.
SONG XXXVII.
1.
AWay (you Fool!) will thou Love less*
Now, thou know, I Love more?
And tax me, with unfaithfulness,
'Cause I was sure before!
Love, like all other goods, diffused, is best:
Nor can One claim, an interest,
But others may, as much (at least)
I Loved her, Love you, and will Love the re^^
2.
The next, that has my Fancy Wo^ne,
I Will serve as I served you;
Why should thou grudg another boon!
I Would give, the Devil his due.
What though thy Body, pleasure find!
Will thou, therefore, ingross my mind!
When Heaven (surely) never assigned
Man, to one Woman, but to Woman kin^
3.
Who marry, do live single; and who have
A Union made, of two
Do, of that Nature, make a slave,
That, never made, them so:
Variety (as some do hold)
The gods delight in, and (of old)
Women, that were, for Saints, enrolled
Coupled at will, and shall Man be control
SONG XXXVIII.
1.
YOu! that can dye some thirteen times, a day
At every paltry Ladies Frown!
Deny your selves, when she says Nay,
And be more hers, then You Are your Own;
I will inform you, of a way,
More safe (although less common known)
Shall bring the work about, for half a Crown.
2.
Would have a colored Beauty, died in grain
In-laid with Art's and Nature's store,
Fresh, as a Summers Evening Rain,
Soft, as the Down that Leda bore
Thy wish (unwoo'd) thou shall obtain,
What matter, though she be a Whore!
She Will do, thy do, as well, what would thou more!
3.
Try this, and Trust me for a Trick of Love,
There comes no Woe, where Women Woe
Here, presently, You Are Hand and Glove:
She Is handsome that will handsome Do.
Will not this more, then Coyness move?
The nicest, is but Woman too
Perhaps unchaste, or faith! I Would make her so.
4.
Then, who would lacquey at a woman's will
Dogging her close,
Kyb'd to her heels, yet jealous, still as she went proved
His services, are dis-allow'd!
Vexing his thoughts, here is to fulfill
With Heart, e'ne broke, Knees, ever bow^
To one, that cannot shine, but through ^ Cloud
5.
It Is solly, to besiege, an intrencht Dame,
Wood- stockt with Honor, Conscience, Fear
When thousands render up the same,
(On easier terms) thou seekst for there
The thing's all one, but for the Name,
Then, which is best a Prize, bought Dear
Or what, is freely purchased every where?
SONG XXXIX.
1.
WHy such a Do
To Win thee!
What Is in thee
Should tempt me, to woe,
Or quarrel for a Kiss!
I could have store,
Of Creatures,
Whose Features,
Are far thine before,
Would Covet, such a Bliss:
Then take it kindly,
With a full Consent,
And I Will use the friendly,
To thy best Content:
Hands off! give thy mind to it!
And, then, thou shall see
If thou, but incline to it
How pleasant, twill be.
2.
Throw of thy Gown!
Vn-lace thee
Embrace me,
And, close, lay thee down,
And let me Do, my Do*
Put out the Light!
I Will dandle,
And handle,
Thy Mint, of Delight,
And will new mould thee, too.
Lulled, then, in pleasure,
And thy wanton Bed,
I Will unfold, the Treasure,
Of thy Maidenhead:
Come to it, do not dally!
But let us agree!
Never stand shall I! shall I!
But, at it, let us be.
SONG XL. The Second Part.
1.
NAy pish! go to
Never proffer,
This offer
Why what is it you would do!
Don't you believe that!
Sweet, now forbear!
Nay pry'thee!
They Will see thee!
They cannot choose but hear,
Say! what would you be at!
Oh Sir, you mistake me!
I am, no such one,
As you seem, to make me,
Pray let me alone!
I promise you, truly,
Had I known before,
You Had been so unruly,
I Would kept fast the Door!
2.
You're such a Man,
S' unluckie
Nay! look ye!
Do all, that I can,
I see, you will have, your way:
Take off your Hands!
Nay hear me!
Forbear me!
The Door open stands,
What will my Mother say!
Thou see how I Love thee,
And why I am Wone,
No never yet could move me,
To what, thou have Done:
Delays, they are lothing;
Then quickly have done,
And pry'thee say nothing!
But let us be gone!
SONG XLI.
1.
WHen Love and Beauty, does combine
To prove a conquest, and conjoyn
Their Powers in One,
They seldom yield,
Or quit, the Field,
Until, their forces do
Make Rebels stand,
To their Command,
And bend, to such, as you.
2.
Thy comely Airs, and hidden Grace,
Besides the Magic, of thy face,
With cunning, and
Enchanting Arts,
Can charm all Hearts
Into that Round of Love,
Which Circle is,
Of all the Bliss
Wherein true joys, do move.
SONG XLII. By Sir, A.G. Mocked by the Author.
G. 1.
POx take you Mristress! I Will begone!
I have Friends to wayt upon;
Think you, I Will my self confine,
To your Humors! (Lady mine!)
No, your lowering, seems to say,
It Is a rayny Drinking day,
To the Tavern I Will away.
B. 1.
Pox take this Drinking? what is to pay!
I have Lasses for me stay:
Think you I Will my self besot
To the Quar't, or Pottle-pot;
No, They only heighten one,
For this after Action.
To the Whors-house I Will begone:
G. 2.
There have I, a mristress got
Cloysterd in a Pottle pot
Bri^k and sparkling, as thine Eye,
When those riches glances fly,
^lump and bounding, soft and fair,
Buxom, blithe, and debonaire,
And she is called Sack my Dear.
B. 2.
There a mistress won have I,
Cloistered, in no Nunnery;
Neat, and brisk, as Spanish Wine,
Or the Juice in Carnadine.
Plump and Gallant, and has store,
To suffice, me over, and Over,
And she is Caelia called, my Who^e.
G. 3.
Sack is my better mistress far,
Sack's mine only Beauty-stare;
Whose Divine and sprightful rays,
Twinckle in each Nose and Face:
Should I all her Beauties show,
Thou thy self, would Lovesick grow,
And she would prove, thy mistress too.
B. 3.
She is my holy whole delight!
Whose Beauty stars, make day of night:
Whose lovely Aires, and comely Grace,
Never adorned Another Face,
Did they all thy features see,
Drinkers, would my Rivals be,
And be Top't, with none, but thee.
G. 4.
She with no ^art scorn, will blast me!
Yet upon the Bed, she will cast me:
And never blush her self to red,
Nor fear, the loss of Mayden-head:
Yet she can, I dare to say,
Spirits, into me convey,
More, then, thou, can take away.
B. 4.
What thought she scorn, or sometimes frown,
On the Bed, I Will lay her down;
Where she blushes not, like one,
That Is ashamed, of what sh' as done:
Yet I gain, I dare to swear,
In an hour, more spirit, from her,
Then Sack yields thee, in a year.
G 5.
Getting Kisses, here is, no coil,
Here Is no Handkercheifes, to spoil!
Yet, I, better Nector sipp,
Then e're dwelt, upon thy Lip
And though still, and mute she be,
Quicker wit, she brings to me,
Then, e're^, could find in thee.
B. 5.
Though for a Kiss, we strive a while,
Pay tears, to purchase half a smile,
We scorn, when hence, such bliss, is got,
The Kissing cupp, or Smiling pot:
Though we talk not, as before,
Blame us not, to think the more
Fancying Kingdoms over, and over.
G. 6.
If I go, never look, to see
Any more, a fool of me!
I Will no liberty up give,
Nor a maudlin Lover live;
Thou shall, never, bring me to it,
No not all thy smiles shall do it,
Nor thy Maidenhead to boot.
B. 6.
When I come, I Am sure to find,
A brave Gallant, to my mind.
Where I Will, my Liberty, give over,
And be maudlin Drunk no more:
I shall soon, be, thither led,
Each smile, shall win me, to her Bed,
And all, for her Maidenhead.
G. 7.
But if thou will take the pain,
To be good, but once again,
And if one smile, call me back,
Thou shall be that Lady Sack:
Faith! but try, and thou shall see,
What a Loving Soul I Will be,
When I Am Drunk, with none, but thee.
B. 7.
But, when all my pains, are spent,
If thou yeildst no fresh content,
And let'st Sack, me, re-invite,
She shall be my whole delight:
Faith! never try, for then you will see,
What a Ranter, I shall be
When I Am drunk, with her, not thee.
Never try! for, then, you will know,
What brave feats, this Sack, can show,
When I Am drunk, as driven Snow.
SONG XLIII.
1.
COme my sure drinking Blades!
Whose never known Trades,
Are excused, from the Curse of the women,
From Plot or design,
But for money or Wine,
While priviledg'd draughts,
Are loose, as your thoughts,
And drink, makes you, only, Freemen,
Be brisk, as a lowse
Oth' Body or mouse,
When the Puss, does Catlin a Fiddle,
For, the Drawer, shall bring
Ague like, in the Spring,
A Cure, for a King,
Oh! it is Sack! that is the thing^s
It Is an All in all,
That will come, at the call!
The Sick-man's health,
And the poor man's wealth
It Is a kind of a Riddle-me-riddle:
Then Oh! my brave bully!
Why sit'st thou so dully,
And dreyn'st up thy gully
With spung'd Melancholy!
It Is a Fiefor-shame, to thy breeding
To sit, like those
Make Children shoes,
And tamper thy chapps,
Like a Clark, in's Clapps,
Or on Brawn, an old Go^sip, a feeding
Cho. It is Wine,
That Is divine,
Must refine,
Our dull Souls:
There Is no mirth,
In the Earth,
Where Is a Dearth,
Of the Bowls.
2.
Come! a Health to a Mis'!
A brimmer it is;
To the first Letter this,
Then syllable all together!
Oh! a Name, of an Ell.
That Is beyond our spell,
Would do, rarely well,
To multiply Cups on either:
We Will Drink, not fight,
For a Ladies right,
He Is no Draught's man, that will wrong one,
And, hence, maintain,
By the Drink we have taken,
There Is no good Name,
But a Long one.
Thus our mistrisses live,
And fates servive,
While others are perished, and rotten,
We Saint, each Lass,
Canonized, in a Glass,
And their beauties, are never forgotten,
Cho. It is Wine, etc.
3.
Well! how goes the Glass!
Let Us see! has he done it!
So so; let it pass!
He Is next who begun it!
It Was I, that swallowd the first, I
Let Us not Drink to halves,
Like Waltham's Calves,
And home, again, turn, a thirsty.
Ralph! prime him a bowl
Happy man! be his dole!
Here Is sovereign Sack,
For the brains, and the back,
It Is good, for the gentle and simple,
It Is not, for naught,
(As, the Wiser, have thought)
That the Devil's, so near the Temple:
It Was this (in a word)
Made, the Cobbler, a Lord
Till, relapsed, to bewitched water,
In an ill time (then)
Recobl^r'd again,
Was, never, his own man, after:
Our Soul, is a Salt,
(As Philosopher's called,)
But given, to keep us, from stinking,
But Nature had (sure)
Other end, to procure
A Thirst, for to furt^er, our Drinking!
Then, why does this Blade,
Drink, so like a Maid!
While he thinks, no body does mind him
Yet, daily he Views
The Danger, accrew',
By leaving the Liquour behind him:
This youth, suites me best,
Who, would, never, let it rest,
Ill Conscience like, were the Bowl his,
But sucks like a Man,
With a Throat, like a Crane,
And wracks down his Body, a whole Piece.
Say! what pleasure is it,
For to supply the Twist
Of a Queen? he is Fool, that will ask it.
The Plowman, is sound,
While he is Tearing the Ground,
And busi'd, in Pinning the Basket.
Cho. It is Wine
That Is Divine
Must refine
Our dull Souls,
There Is no Mirth,
^n the Earth,
Where Is a Dearth!
Of the Bowl^.
SONG XLIV.
1.
FOrtune is blind,
And Beauty unkind,
The Devil take 'um both!
One is a Witch,
And to other's a Bitch,
In neither's, Faith, or Troth:
There Is hazard, in Hap,
Deceit, in a Lap,
But no fraud in a Brimmer;
If Truth, in the bottom, lie,
Thence to redeem her,
We Will drain a whole Ocean dry.
2.
Honor's, a Toy!
For Fools, a Decoy!
Beset, with Care and Fear;
And that (I wusse)
Kills, many a Pusse,
Before her Clymacht year:
But Freedom, and Mir^h,
Create, a new birth;
while, Sack's, the Aqua-vitae
That vigor, and spirit gives:
Liquour Almighty!
Whereby, the poor mortal lives.
3.
Let us be Blithe
In spite, of death's sithe!
And with a heart and half
Drink to our Friends,
And think of no ends
But keep us sound, and safe!
While healths, do go round,
No malady's found,
The maw sick, in the morning,
For want, of it is wonted straive,
Is as a warning,
To double it, over again.
4.
Let us maintain
Our Traffic with Spain
And both the Indies, sleight^
Give us their Wines!
Let them keep their mines!
We Will pardon Eighty eight!
There Is more certain wealth
Secured, from stealth,
In one Pipe of Canary,
Then, in an Unfortunate Isle;
Let us be wary
^e do not Our selves beguile!
SONG XLV. Latin'd thus by the Author.
1.
SOrs sine Visu,
Formaque Risu,
Sint pro Daemone!
Haec Malefica,
Ista Venefica,
Fallax utraque:
Sors, mera est Fors,
Sinusque vecors,
Sed ^raus nulla; in Toto
In Fundo si Veritas sit
Potu Epoto,
Oceanus Siccus fit.
2.
Honor est Lusus,
Stultis illusus
Cura catenata;
Hacque (ut fatur)
Catus necatur,
Morte non parata:
Dum vero Graecamur,
Nos Renovamur
Nam, Aqua vitae, vinum,
Vires spiritusque dat,
Idque Divinum,
A morte, nos Elevat.
3.
Jam simus laeti,
Spreta vi Lethi,
Cordati^sime!
Vt Combibones
(Non ut Gnathones)
Sarti-tectique:
Dum Pocula spument,
Morbi absument:
Ac, mane, Corpus Onustum,
Prae alienatione,
Acuit gustum,
Pro iteratione.
4.
Perstet, quotannis,
Merx, cum Hispanis
India sit Sola!
Vinum praebeant!
Aurum teneant!
Absit Spinola!
Sunt Opes, pro Certo,
Magis a furto,
In Vini Potione,
Quam Terra Incognita
Pro Cautione
Ne nobis sit Subdola.
SONG XLVI. At the Surrender of Oxon.
1.
THou Man of Men, who e're thou art,
That have a Loyal, Royal Heart,
Despair not! though thy Fortune frown
Our Cause, is Gods, and not our Own;
'Twere sin, to harbor Jealous fears,
The World laments, for Cavaleers, Cavaleers
2.
Those Things (like Men) that swa^m, ^ith Town
Like Motions, wander up, and down;
And were the Rogues, not full of blood,
You Would swear, they men were, made of wood
The Fellow-feeling-wanton swears,
There are no Men, but Cavaleers, etc.
3.
Ladies, be pearl, their Diamond Eyes,
And curse, Dame Shipton's Prophecyes
Fearing they never shall be sped,
To wrestle, for a Maidenhead:
But feelingly, with doleful tears,
They sigh, and mourn for Cavaleers, etc.
4.
Our grave Divines, are silenced quite.
Ecclipsing thus, our Churches Light:
Religion's made a mock, and all
Good ways, as Works, Apocryphal:
Our Gallants baffel'd, slaves made Peers,
While Oxford, weeps for Cavaleers, etc.
5.
Townsmen complain, they are undone,
Their Fortunes fail, and all is gone,
Rope makers, only live in hopes,
To have good trading, for their Ropes,
And Glovers thrive, by Roundheads Ears,
When Charles returns, with his Cavaleers, Cavaleers.
SONG XLVII. At General Monks coming to London.
1
NOw Lambert's sunk,
And mighty Monk
Succeeds, the Tyrannous Cromwell,
And Arthur's Court.
'Cause, time is short
Do Rage, like Devils, from Hell:
Let Us mark the Fate,
And course of State
Who rises, while to other, is sinking,
And believe, when this is past,
'Twill be, our turn, at last;
By the good old cause of Drinking.
2.
First Sa' fleum Noll,
He swallowed all,
His smeller, showed he Loved it:
But Dick his Son,
As he were none,
Gave't off! and had reproved it:
But that his Foes,
Made Bridge, on's Nose,
And cried him down, for a Protector,
Proving him, to be a Fool
That would, undertake to Rule,
And not fight, and drink, like Hector.
3.
The Grecian Lad*
He Drank like mad.
Minding no Work above it;
And ( San's question)
Killed Ephestion,
Cause, he would not approve it:
He got Command,
Where, God had Land,
And, like a right Maudlin Yonker,
When he Tippled all, and Wept,
He laid him down, and Slept,
Having no more Worlds to Conquer.
4.
Rump Parliament,
Would needs invent
An Oath, of Abjuration,
But Obedience,
And Allegiance,
Now, are all in fashion:
Then here is a Bowl,
With Heart, and Soul,
To Charles, and let All, say Amen to it.
Though, they brought the Father down,
From a triple Kingdom Crown,
We Will Drink the Son, up again to it.
SONG XLVIII.
1.
NOw the State's brains, are addle,
With a new fiddle f^ddle,
And Politic Body Disordered,
And reeles too and fro,
(As Good fellows do)
In reason, that cannot be bordered:
While, Drunk with their Wealth,
(Made Sweeter by Stealth)
They, Coop't in their Own,
Seek Kingdoms to come*
And fancy, beyond-sea-Vagaries;
We, sit Close at Home,
Content, with Lipp Room;
In the Infinite Space,
Of an Ocean Glass,
Nere Sail to, but Drink the Canaries:
And in our Opinion,
Have greater Dominion,
Then They, when their Conquests besot u'm;
We Discover in the Cup,
That is, Well dried up,
A New New Foundland, in the bottom;
Then highten our Souls,
With aspiring Bowls,
For Crosses, and Cares we have forgot u'm.
2.
Pox on Cupid, and's Whimseyes,
That makes a Man dimn's Eyes,
With Playnts to an Idle-fekt-Mistresse;
And, Spaniel-li^e, Whimper,
And ^^hine, till the Simper,
Or Laugh, at his Woe, and his Distress:
Let Mongrels that are
Betwixt hope, and fear,
Their Fortunes bemoan,
With a Grievous- Groan,
While we, merry Lads, that have drank hard
In our Geers, well warm,
Nere Think, nor Catch harm;
Nor Sensible are,
Of Sorrows, or Care,
Nor of Tears, but those of the Tankard:
That Spare-Rib (called Woman)
Or proper, or common,
Shall, never, take us off from our freedom;
We Will Drink deep, and draw,
With a hungry Maw,
As Spunges were there, for to feed 'um;
And for a recruit,
Fresh Bottles shall do it
Or ^ottles, I Am sure, we shall need 'um.
3.
Let Us curse that dull Miser
That will Club, but his ^iser,
And suck out his gill, with the Bulkers;
While Taverns, they bugger,
Trunk in Hugger mugger;
Our throats a^e like Open Sepulchers:
Each Man, with is ^owle,
Like a Good dry soul,
And a Managed Quart,
To solace the Heart,
The Word Have at all, so we fall on,
And hugg, his Design,
Who, at close oth' Wine,
Entitles, by Stealth,
A Requiring Health,
Till, the pint, turn Pimp to the Gallon.
Thus wash away Sorrow,
With thoughts of to Morrow,
Or any past thing that befell ye;
For, Sack is a sure,
And a Sovereign Cure,
Of any Disease, it will heal ye,
What would a Man more,
Out of Nature's store,
Then Women and Wine by the belly?
SONG XLIX.
1.
NOw, w' are high flown,
Let Us laugh* and lie down,
And revel, in the pride of our blood,
For Melancholy,
'S an idle folly
That, never brought any to Good:
Since Mirth, enlivens our Souls,
And hightens, our Spirits, with Comforting bowls;
Which, when with Courage over grown,
A Well manag'd-Woman, shall soon take them down.
2.
We Will ransack Nature,
TO Enjoy the Creature,
And cull out the prime of her Store;
For Wine, and Women,
Shall make us the men,
In plenty, what need we be poor?
Then drink! and more drink! let us call,
Cause, that does afford us, our Meat, Cloth, and All:
It Is that, must keep us Alive
While, Duck-like, all weathers, we Tipple, and --
3.
I like that man well,
That strikes me handsel,
In The Morning, with a fresh fasting-Groat*
And when we enter't,
Cries, hanged! let us venture't!
Then doubles it, to Mend our Draught,
And when our Hands are well in,
Until, the hard Midnight repeats it agin;
Then sleep a while for recrute,
And let the dry Morning, afresh, call us to it.
4.
Thus, free from Thinking,
Perpetual Drinking
Be- Lethe's the Cares of the World;
Our Dose, a Gallon,
The Quart's, a small one;
Then, see, that it down stayres be hurled:
And with It, ply us all Day
And, make it Your Work, for to keep us in Play;
But if, unfill'd to the Brim,
The devil take drawer, or Dunstan take him.
SONG L. At the Request of Sr. John Kyrle.
1.
LEt half God Bacchus, now resign,
His Demi- ships, usurped Place!
Pomona's Juice, is more Divine,
More Sovereign, her Grace;
Queen Apple! She,
My Love shall be,
There Is none, I admire, beside Her,
Dame Barley's sap,
And Blood oth' Grape,
Must yield to puissant Cider.
2.
This, was the Nectar, warmed the Gods,
While Adam Wight, in Eden, Delves:
Nor must the Mortal, know the ods,
Reserved for themselves,
Till Meddling Eve,
Laughed in her sleeve,
And was resolved, what e're be^yde her,
To have a Taste,
Of the Fruit (at last)
That affords, Everlasting Cider.
3.
This done, the Old Boy, she did call
To Taste, and Eat; had He bin Wise,
To squeeze, and drink, Flesh could not Fall,
'T had, rather made it Rise:
The Trojan Youth,
Had never (in truth)
Got Venus Boon, had he denied Her,
That Thing, on I Would,
Which pressed, and try'de,
Made Potable Gold, for a Cider.
4.
A Dragon watched the Hesperides,
King Pippin's ^ody to secure,
And daunt atchieving Hercules,
Who never was Friend to Brewer,
For with the Thought,
Of this he fought,
Had the Jaws of the Beast, bin Wider,
He would have dared,
To pass the Guard,
For a powerful Rummer of Cider.
5.
Sherbet, Coffee, and Chocolate,
Are Heathenish Drinks, compared to this,
That Water (too) Vnchristen'd, late
Sirnam'd Mirabilis:
Let Spain and France,
Their Wines Advance,
Our Herefordshire, they say, that tried her,
Does now produce
A Nobler Juice,
The Muses, and the Mortals Cider.
6.
Those of this Isle,
Are blessed the while,
Whom Nature be friends with her bounty
If this Song fail,
It Is long of Ale,
Being Shire of Another County.
SONG LI. After Worcester Fight.
1.
THe Kings gone!
W' are All undone!
Ore' powered, by the Sword!
The Crown's lost!
Our Fortunes crossed!
While Cromwell's their Good Lord!
Our Hopes, to see
A Hierarchy
^mall Comforts, now afford,
When Bulkers Teach,
And Troopers preach
^f God, the Devil a Word.
2.
Yet never pine!
^or season Wine!
With Tears of Misery!
The Glass Crown!
^et Fortune drown!
Or Hang, no whit care I!
The Thousandth Cup,
Shall, puff us up
^o Fancy Monarchy:
^eligion
'Sans King, is None,
But Drinking Loyalty.
SONG LII. On the Act against Titles of Honor
1.
DRaw the Wine!
Fill the Bowl!
Never repine!
Or Condole!
At the Usage, the States, lay upon us
Though they Trample us down,
Under foot, from a Crown,
If we, but hold up
For a plentiful Cup,
We Will forgive, all the mischief, they have done
Let our Honors,
And our Mannours,
Be confiscate, to their Powers;
If we Sack,
May not Lack,
The whole World shall be Ours:
And while their kindness, this fair Boon, afford
Though we cannot spend, we will be as dru^ as Lord
2.
Then about
Give the Glass!
Suck it out!
Let it pass!
And who Tipples, as long, as He Is able,
Though He Is shrunk, from Sr. John,
To Poor Jack, all is One;
Let Us Lady, take snuff,
If he drink, but Enough,
We Will install him Knight. of the Round Table:
Other Titles,
Are but Trifles,
Not deserving our Thinking,
Hence we will make,
Laws, to take
Our Degrees, from Good Drinking:
Honor's a Pageant, we disclaim the Thing,
^ho'd be a Knight, where Charles is not a King?
3.
Drink away!
Have at all!
While we stay,
Let us call,
and, as Lilburn would have us, be freemen,
And who Tope out their Time,
Till the Midnight shall Chyme,
Their Mistresses, They
Shall be Ladies of the May,
And Themselves, of the Bottles, the Yeome^
The Commanders,
That were Ranters,
Shall Commence, now, to be Hector
And be still
As Gentile
As the Kingdom's Protector's
And bear, (dispight of States, or Hera^^ Rules
In The Pockets, Argent, in their Faces, Gules.
SONG LIII. When the Parliament would ha^^ Crowned Cromwell.
1.
THe Parliament,
Had a shrewd Intent,
To make their Lord a King,
But He ( Good man)
Do, what they can,
Will yield, to no such thing:
He sought to God,
And fought abroad,
Our Freedoms, home to bring,
Nor dares He make
For Charles his sake,
Himself a Glorious King.
2.
Then in a Word,
Let Us praise our Lord;
Who, did so well, Project!
His Kingdome's not,
Of this World, but
Another he will Protect,
And, spite of Those,,
Who might oppose
The Wardship, of the Throne,
Till the King comes,
The three Kingdoms,
He Will keep still, as his Own.
3.
What need he care
To be styled O. R.
When O. P. does as well?
The Things, the same,
But, for the Name,
Kingdom, or Common Weal*
It, only, Mads,
Us bonny Ladds,
Who, while we Qua^se, and Sing,
What e're we think
We fear, to Drink
A Health, unto the King.
SONG LIVE. On the Act for Marriages.
1.
LAst Parliament Sat,
And the Speaker did prate,
A Jury of Years, to no purpose;
For Acts, and for Law,
To keep us, in awe,
They baffled, the Rules of Lycurgus.
For, when seven Years,
They had Sat Sans Peers,
(Without Wit, or Fears)
And, we looked, when Geers, should go trimmer
They gave us, at last,
Of their Office a Cast,
And what d' ye think was it?
A Put off with a Pittyfull Primmer.
2.
And, once in a Mood,
When sitting was Good,
And their Wives, they had put them, upon it
They thought, of a Knack,
To silence, the Clack,
That Men, might not tell, when th'a^ done it
When, this passed, they had,
They sat still, like Mad,
Till the fiery faced Lad
In Zeal and Uprightness, had told 'um
If they left not the House,
Without any Excuse,
To a better use,
He Would make it too hot, for to hold 'um.
3.
So in came, of late,
the Devil would ha'te
For seldom (they say) comes a better
Such Hebrew Jews,
you pick, and choose,
Not, one, of the Law knows a Letter.
And, now they have begun,
Such an Act they have Done,
And a Pattern shown,
To marry, or Hang, take you whether,
For next trick they shows
Will be, for to Choose,
A New-way, to Noose,
Since both, do by fate, go together.
4.
When woe, ^omes to woe
^o the Justice we go,
And those (who have hands) are to shake 'um,
And, he that can, speaks
A. B. C. D. takes,
But Justices, the Devil take 'um!
Girls, that are Sporting,
Must stay, till fourteen,
'Ere they be Courting,
Who, would have begun at Eleven,
And Men, till Sixteen
(Was e're such trick seen?)
Stomach, it sticks in,
When They Would have fallen to it e're, twi^ seve^
5.
Those Youths that are Kind,
And have now a Months mind,
I Would wish, e're the Close of September
To make a^ Cock sure*
And firm, to Endure,
That, Each, take his Love by the member
Who Wivings adjourn,
And now slip their Turn,
Were better, to Burn:
The Word, it is hard, but a True One
If I were, well-rid,
Of the Wife, that I did
(...) the Old way-wed,
I Would hang e're, I Would Vent^^^ the new one
Cho. Oh Parliament! Parliament! pittyful Clown
What would You be at?
It puzzles the Rules
Of the Laws, and the Schools,
This Question to state
Whether they were more Knaves, then you are Fools.
SONG LV. A Round.
1.
COme smoo^h off your Liquor!
It makes the Wit quicker,
And he, that his Water refuses,
Whilst we Laugh and Sing
And quaff healths, to the King,
Shall never have a Bout with the Muses.
2.
The next to Queen Mary:
Fill it up! we will not spare ye;
We came hither, to wash ou^ Gully:
How now! what is a clock?
Give the Drawer a Knock
We loose time, while he fills it, so dully.
3.
To the Duke swallow franker,
Since we have the Spanker
We Will every man Drink out, an od-peice.
He, that fails, of his whole one,
Were he graver, then Solon.
Shall have all the rest, in his Cod-peice*
SONG LVI. A Round.
1.
A Pox on those Od-mates!
And half witted Clode-pates!
That never knew the price, of a Pottle!
Nor ever took part,
Of a tedious Quart,
But tamper their Chaps,
On the dow-back't Sops.
Of pittyful Aristotle!
Cho. Blaze up to the King, say I,
Fill the Cup,
Tope it up,
Let it pass, it is the vote of the Commons,
To Sing, Drink and Fight,
In the world's despite.
That the Crown may be Charles his, or no man's.
2.
A fig for Jandunus!
Here 's Sack that can tune us,
In our mirth, to a note above Ela.
While the Roundhead Rogues,
Like Birds (called Hogs)
In damnable qualms,
Howl out Wisdoms psalms
To a Presbyterian Selah
Cho. Blaze up, etc.

Since we know what our Company are,
We Will be as Honest, and we will Drink as fair,
2.
Give us the Bow'e!
Fuddle it all!
What Honest Soul,
Will not call
For a Whole one,
And send about a Mistresses health,
If, all refuse it, I Will begin't my self.
3.
Here Is to the best,
In Christendom!
Pox send the rest,
All and some,
To the Devil!
We Will ply the Pots, and the Wenches too
But 't must be, when, w' have nothing else, to do
4.
I will have Nan,
You shall have Besse,
Do what you can,
I Will no less,

A Blow oth' Navel, so have at it all.

And when we shall entwine,

That for a little, I Will teach thee much,
My Hand shall rovingly,

And we will Lovingly
Take a Touch.

Let Us chase away, mad Malancholly!
Hang pinching*
(Spite of Wenching!)
Curse States!
Damn Fates!
Here Is a jolly
Cup, to the Bully!
Tope thy Liquor, and see this health go round.
And He that swallows a Beer-bowle,
Leaves Thinking,
Minds his Drinking,
And shall,
Quaff all,
May that Dear-soul,
Ever be Cheerful,
And his sorrows, as his soul, be drowned
Then here is to Mall, with the Scallop smock
Let Us fancy the time, she all up took,
And to Betty-fair,
That does it, to a Hair,
Were it a Mile to the bottom
I Would take every jot down,
And not a spoonful to Jone,
I Love a hayry Bush well,
But Pox on things like a Bushel,
As for little Nan,
I Will Touch her, if I can,
Or silken sim'pring Sarah
I Am sure she carries good Ware-a,
And I Will Trade with her Anon.
SONG LX. A Round, at the Request of Sir W.S.
1.
OF all things!
We call things,
For my part, I Would have but one
For fair things
As Rare things,
I do not care a Button:
Of all the feeling Gear,
That ever I came near
Were it a brown, Red, or Yellow
For Praises, or for Prick,
To the principle I Will stricke
That a Black thing has no fellow.
2.
Girls in the Dark
When they stark,
Are naked, as the Truth is;
And with care,
Trim their Ware,
As flippant, as their youth, is,
And do the best they can
To fit themselves, for Man,
I Would have, at last, they should well know,
The chiefest Grace they Lack,
If their Tackle be not Black,
For a Black thing, etc.
3.
If you will feel,
One Gentle
She Is Argent 'bout the Navel
When she bears
Right her Gears
Her Honor point is sable:
The Damo'sels that are Fair
But for an outside are
They Are rotten e're they are Mellow,
But Oh! The Black! The Black!
It Is she will hold you tack
For a Black thing, etc.
4.
The choice Grace,
Of a Face,
By a black Patch, out-set is:
The best Stone,
Fairest she'wn,
Within a foil of Jet is:
If e're it be my Doom,
To Cover and to Come,
At the nodding of the Pillow
Of all the pleasant Pack,
Commend me to the Black;
For a Black thing, etc.

They care not what they Do,
They will not let you have a Bout,
Under a Crown, or two:
They Dawb their Chaps, and Curle their (...)
Their Breaths perfume they do,
They Are Tails are peppered with the Po^^
And that you are welcome too.
2.
But give me the Buxome Country Lass!
Hot-piping, from the Cow,
She Will take a Touch, upon the Grass,
Yea! Marry! and thank you too.
Her Colour's fresh as Rose in june,
Her Skin's as soft, as Silk,
She Will do her Business to some Tune
And freely spend her Milk.
SONG LXIII. A Mock.
1.
LAy that Sullen Garland by thee!
Keep it forth' Elizian, shade!
Take my Wreath of Lusty Ivy
Not of that faint Myrtle made!
When I see thy Soul descending,
To that cool, and fertile plain,
Of sad Fo^les that lack attending
Thou shall have the Crown again,
Now drink Wine, and know the odds
'Twixt that Lethe, and the gods!
B. 1.
Cast that Ivy Garland from thee!
Leave it for some Wilder-Blade!
Venus wreath would best become thee,
Not for Blasing Bacchus made:
When my high flown Soul's ascended,
^o Love's bright and warmer Sphere,
Where with Chaplets I Am attended,
Thou an Ivy Bush shall wear:
Now be Sober! and you will prove!
Mortals Tipple, gods do Love.
2.
Rouse thy dull, and drowsy Spirits!
See these Soul Reviving-streams!
Stupid Lovers Brain inherits
Naught, but vain, and empty Dreams:
Think not then thy dismal Trances
With our Raptures can contend;
The Lad that Laughs, and Sings and Dances,
May come sooner to his End:
Sadness may, some pity move,
Mirth, and Courage Ravish Love.
B. 2.
Welcome merry Melancholy*
Fancying Beavtie's quickening Beams!
Boon Companions Wits, are folly
Shrunk in over wetting streams:
Think not, then thy Ranting Humor,
May with Modesty contend,
Lesser Talkers often Do more
When they come unto their End:
Rudness, Easy Girls may move,
Civil Carriage, Charms a Love.
3.
Fie then on that Cloudy Forehead!
Open those Vein-like crossed Arms!
You may as well call back the buried
As raise Love, with such dull Charms:
Sacrifice a Glass of Claret
To each Letter of her Name;
The gods have often descended for it,
Mortals should much more, the same,
If She come not at that Flood
Sleep will come, and that is as Good.
B. 3.
Cloudy Brows do presage Weeping;
And who would not hear our Cries?
Who the Grave, has had in Keeping,
Would to pity Love arise:
Offer up a Yoke of Kisses,
To the Damo'sell you adore!
Jove for such a Bliss as this is,
Would come, now though never before:
If this way, she cannot be had,
Drinking comes, and that is as Bad.
SONG LXIV. A Mock.
1.
FEar not (my Genius) to unfold
My silent Thoughts by these*
Let Women, born, to be contrould,
Receive them, as they please,
Their long Usurped Monarchy,
Has made me, hate, their Tyranny.
B. 1.
Tremble ( Ill Nature!) to betray,
In idle Words, thy thought,
That Women* who, our Passions, sway
Should be Contrould, as Naught:
Their long continued Hierarchy
Has made me Love, their Sovereignty.
2.
Let them, and their Magnetique Charms,
As Harbingers before 'um,
Possess themselves of Cupits Arms,
As Baytes, for to Adore 'um.
I Will never commit Idolatry,
To Subjects, born, as well as I.
B. 2.
Let some one, whose detracting Tongue
Is Usher, to his Wit,
Their Beauties and his Judgment wrong
Whilst I, admireing sit.
It cannot be Idolatry,
To Worship, such Divinity.
3.
Their Diety, with them, must fade,
It cannot be denied,
Then since, the Pretty things, were made;
Out of Old Adams side:
Lets Love them still, but know it it is thus
We Will Do It, because They Are part of Us.
And let this then, Suffice the Elves
To say, we Love them, as our selves.
B. 3.
Their Diety can never Decay,
'Twere Sin to say, it should,
Then since they are Forms not Cast in Clay
But of a siner Mould:
We Will Love them still, with all our Hearts,
Because, they are our Better parts:
And let this satisfy poor Men,
To pu^chase thus their Ribb again.
SONG LXV. A Mock.
1:
NOw, I confess, I am in Love,
Although I thought, I never should:
But, it is with one, dropped from above,
Whom Nature made, of better Mould:
So Fair, so Good, so all Divine,
I Would quit the World, to make her Mine.
B. 1.
I Will never, Confess yet dare be hanged,
(Although I hope 'twill never be so,)
If the best Girl, that ever Twang'd
Do make me Buckle, to her Bow:
Or Fair, or Foul, what e're she be,
Of all the World, she is not for me.
2.
Have you not seen, the Stars retreat,
When Sol salutes our Hemisphere,
So shrink those Beauties, called Great,
When, sweet Rosella, does appear:
Were she, as other Women, are,
I should not Love her, nor Despair.
B. 2.
Have you not seen Ecclipsed Sol,
When spangle Stars, supply the Day,
So shine those Beauties, thought but small,
When Fair Florella's gone away
But all alike, I must refuse,
Nor e're will pick, if I may choose.
3.
For I could, never, bear a mind,
Willing to stoop, to common faces,
Nor Confidence enough, could find,
To aim at one, so full of Graces:
Fortune, and Nature did Decree,
No Woman should be fit for me.
B. 3.
For I was, never, so given to it,
With every Common Lass, to Trade,
Nor e're had the Impudence, to Do It,
With any Modest graceful Maid.
Nor Fate nor Art could ever move,
My sullen Heart, to thoughts of Love.
SONG LXVI. A Mock.
1.
BE gone! Thou Fatal Fever! from me, now be gone!
Let Love alone!
Let his Aetherial flames, possess my Breast!
The fires, of thy consuming heat, no aid requires,
But swift Desires,
Transport my passions, to a Throne of Rest
Where I, who in the pride of health, could never feel,
Such warmth to move.
By Sickness tamed,
A'm so Enflamed,
I fee'le, noe joy, but Love.
And he, who trifled many tedious hours away
My Love to try.
In little space,
Has gained the Grace,
To have more power, then I.
B. 1.
Away! you Grevious Things, called Mistresse^ away
Yield Sack the Day!
Let her Diviner sparks, in flame my Breast
The heat, of whose Enlivening Virtue's so Complea^
That for the feat,
My fancy's carried, here to seat it is rest:
Where I, who in the height of Love, could never, find
Such warmth, to stir.
By Sack in spird,
Am now, so fired,
I joy in None, but Her:
And I, who have been Occupy'd, an hour sometimes
A Love, to Win,
In lesser space,
Have gained the Grace,
To care not for it, a Pin*
2.
Depart! Thou fatal Fever from me, no^ Depar^
Think not my Heart
To thy dull flames, shall be a Sacrifice*
A Maid ( Dread Cupid) now has on the A^tar lai^
By thee betrayed,
A Rich Oblation, to restore thine Eyes:
But yet, my fore acknowledgment, sha^^ testif^^
Thou have no Craft,
To bend thy Bow,
Against a Foe,
That aimed, to catch the shaft;
^or did I fear, though at my Bosom, all at once,
Such Darts did move;
She that receives,
A thousand Sheaves,
She can no more, but Love.
B. 2.
^F -- for all you Femal Creatures, now a F-
Never think my Heart,
In your Weak flames, shall burn a Sacrifice,
^ Blade (god Bacchus!) here, has at the Tavern had
Now by thee made,
A stronger Fire, to Blaze out his Fyes:
^ut yet, my late acknowledgment shall Justify,
Thou have no Craft,
My flames, to Drown,
When once, high flown,
With never so great a Draught:
^or would I care, though for an Ocean, all at once,
My Guts had space,
He that Topes up,
The thousandth Cup!
He can no more but Blaze.
3.
No more Physicians, let me try your Brains!
Pray give me over!
I have a Cure, in Physic, never read; no more!
Though you, as skillfull Doctors, all the world do know,
In Learning flow,
You may as well go practice on the Dead:
But, if my Gerard daigne, to view me, wit^
His Glorious Looks
I make no doubt,
To Live without
Physicians, and their Books:
It Is he, who with his balmy Kisses, can resto^^
My latest breath,
What bliss is This!
To Gain a Kiss,
And save, a Maid, from Death!
B. 3.
No more; You Physickt Ladies! I Will you helps implore
But give you over!
I have a Cure, your Beauties, never did pro^^^
Though you, have saving Virtues, Love (...) Lovers know
And tell you so,
Practice on those, that swear they will dye for Love
But if I view, Canaries sparkling Beauties,
In a Glass,
I Question not
The Going to pott,
'Spight of a Ladies Face:
It Is she, who with her Sugard Kisses, ca^ Preserv^^
My failing Breath;
What bliss like this,
A Cup, to Kiss,
And save, a man from Death!
(...) you ( Divine ones of another world I bow,
And will allow,
^our sacred precepts, if you will grant me this,
^at He, whom I adore, even next your Diety,
May go with me,
without his presence, there can be no bliss:
teach your Tenants of Eternity, to those,
That aged be,
^o not persuade,
Love sick Maid
There Is any Heaven, but He:
^ stay! methinks an Icy slumber does possess
My wearied Brain,
^ay bid him Dye,
you think, I
shall never Wake again.
B. 4.
(...) you (Divines Beauties of the World!) I vow
^ will allow,
^our sacred Titles, if you will one thing prove!
^at Sack whom I before you all, my Mistress make,
^ may not Lack,
without her, there can be small sport in Love
^ read your Lectures, of Sobriety, to those,
That Punyes be,
^o not persuade,
Topeing Blade,
^uch Drink's in Heaven, as She.
But stay! Methinks a giddy whimsey tox^cat^
my warmed Brain;
E'ne let me Dye,
If you think I,
Shall never Blaze up again.
Mock SONG LXVII. To Dr. Smith's Ballad -- Will Women's and
1.
HAve Men there idle tricks begun
Pox out! what means their cou^^
Shall Poets prate, till Breath be gone,
Yet men still worse and worse?
Bob Wisdom's Psalms, are never the near
To the Lad, that is proud of his Cod-(...)
Which makes the Vicious, fret and swea^
And me, to Bann and Curse.
2.
I once was minded, to be Du^^b
And never to make a Word;
Although that Mankind, all and some
Were hanged who'd care a T --?
But now my Tongues at no Command,
I cannot hold it, with my Hand,
As easily, as Cocks can stand,
My Reasons R'yme afford.
3.
And first, I Will violent hands lay on,
There Puffs, and perfumed Ware;
Their pride, so with a powder shown,
Does go against the Hair.
For though, their Clothes, are out at Elbow
The are Captains, straight, with their Blades of Bilboe,
With them six pence, and the devil in hell go!
'T would make one stamp and stare.
4.
Their down right thoughts, never mind their ^ooks
They Have e'ne almost forgot 'um;
For since Old And, fell of oth' hooks,
Men's Fingers, never itcht less at 'um.
And if they can but the Scriptures abuse,
They Laugh (as if they could not choose,)
At Moses, Hopkins, and Sternolds Muse,
'T would make all Women hate 'um.
5.
Their Faces, are rubbed in such sort,
With pieces, of brass kettle;
As if they were Old Dogs oth' sport,
And Metal bear, on Metal:
They with their antic Mops, and Mowes,
Will Face down Truth, how e're the world goes,
Lilly has no such signs as those,
Will times, and things never settle?
6.
With these, they are imbolden'd so,
And look so tow'rdly on 'um,
That Others wives (forsooth) they will know,
When little thanks they con 'um:
And every night they feast their Cullies,
With bowl of sack never think it full is,
As easily, as Whores get Cullies,
Never think what has undone 'um.
7.
Oftimes you would think 'twere all their Own
They take so much, upon 'um;
When presently, they are struck Dumb
You Would wonder, what is come on 'um.
They are so sullen, and stout God mend 'um!
We Maids can never tell wher'e to send 'um
I would the Whores (with a Pox) would end 'um
Or Heaven keep us from 'um.
8.
Their rude Demeanor, is a scare Crow,
For Women, for to fear 'um;
Their bitter Oaths do so far go,
That surely, I Will beware 'um:
And when with many a Jeggam-bobb
They Have got you, into the Pound of ^obb
They Will leave you, as Bobabill, left Cobb
The Devil will (once) not spare 'um.
9.
Sometimes, they are all in the fire of Love,
And live, like Salamander,
And then I wish some queans, would prove
And each of these, a Pauder:
But (the plain truth, for to illustrate)
They are such Creatures Women must hate,
And if their Wills, you cannot frustrate,
They Will bring your Souls, in Danger.
10.
Two Mere maids (once) had got an Ecle,
Whose body they had a plot on;
Dear love (quoth they) we are true as steel
But Geers, they would not Cotton:
For thinking him sure, as Louse in Bosom,
He wriggles his Tail and strair, out goes 'um
So quickly slipped a way, to loose 'um
Him saw they never a jot on.
11.
Or if some men to good be brough't
And purpose, what they have spoken;
It Is ten to one, they have never a groat,
Then Silver, cannot be broken:
Who else is Sped, is Matched with a Stalion
He Will have her, soon at the Lock Itallian,
She Is Fool and Ass, and Tatter-de-mallian;
That Wedds, for never a Token.
12.
The holy Sisters, often pray,
And Scriptures, Eke unfold,
Yet men, as though 'twere out oth'way,
Never hark, to what is told:
You may speak, as well, to an Image of dough,
Not one, cares whether, you Teach, or no,
Their Hearts are as hard, as Iron too,
As tough, but not so cold.
13.
When will (do you think) this Geer go tri^
And e're, be brought to good?
Good faith! I think 'twill never begin:
What never? No! would it would!
They have so many conceits and whimsei^;
That one may scribble, until he dimn's eye
Their souls are black as stocks, of Chimneyes
It Is pity by the Rood!
14.
Troth! Queans would serve 'um well ^ nough
When (once) to work they get 'um:
(One finding Tools, and to other Stuff
And they their Task to set 'um:
Where ( nak't, as Truth, they should work their fill,
And every Jack, should have his Gill,
And lay it on, take 't off who is will,
Good faith! Who would not let 'um?
15.
And now we have brought 'um in by Troops,
To Girls oth' lewder sort,
We Will keep 'um close, as Cocks in Coops,
For the Trappanning sport
Nay now, we have 'um within their Carcass
We Will neither favor Earl or Marquess,
I Have made this staff too short.
16.
Now God a bless, our Noble Queen!
Who gives Examples many,
But men (as if they never had been)
Will not be ruled by any:
Nay here is the thing mortality grieve would
That men should go to Hell, thick and three fold
To save them, I Would not set foot, over threshold
They Will never be worth a penny.
Mock SONG LXVIII, To I pry'thee don't Fly me, etc.
1.
POx on thee! get from me,
This does not become thee,
I cannot abide,
One un-frenchefi'd,
A Curse on your Gaffers and John's!
Your mopps, and your mowes!
With your half legged shell'd Shoes,
Your Gammers and Dames
With such rustical Names!
And a full mouthed Oath,
As a Cifre, to both,
You may keep for the Clownes, and their Sons;
For aspiring (at first) to have been all as one
The Devil's foot was Cleft for a destinction.
2.
Abatements Degrading,
Are for men of Trading,
Who since have forgon
By Birth, what is their own
And their souls are disposed there after:
What pleasures in that
To be called God knows what,
Sir, Richard's of Fame,
Above any Nickname,
That sounds halt or lame
And is like a May Game
To provoke all the hearers, to laughter,
He that bears a base mind, or Mechaniquely lives
Reverts, his own Arms, or a Batoun he gives,
3.
I Love those Contrivements,
Of noble Atcheivements,
Where Argent, and Or
Prefer men before
The Vulgar, for Wisdom and breeding;
For why should a Fool,
The Wiser, over Rule
Who Is Lord of the Soil
But untilled, the while,
As to Manners or Arts,
Though a Giant in Parts
And is better worth hanging, then feeding
Clounisme is dross, and course flesh, but rust is,
It Is common (though unclean) to be both Clark and Justice.
4.
For why should we be,
Of the new Paritye,
'Cause there are a few,
Of the Levelling Crew,
Who would have us all equal and brothers
Such turbulent Spirits,
May they have their Demerits
Loose health, wealth and blood
With their Countries good
And be condemned fit,
To pay, for their Wit,
And hang out oth' reach of all others:
Pesantry's base, and who is born to it must wear it,
But Honor is the Merit of the Persons, that bear it.
5.
Were I Prince, for my part,
Let others, go try for it,
I Would soberly Rule,
And small ones befool,
Who squander their times, out in Drinking,
I Will not Intoxicate,
With Canaries, my Pate;
The Scout, I Will assure ye,
And every Mercury,
With each book of News,
I will so far use,
To Furnish Discourse after Thinking:
All the Name I desire, is a Person of honor
And he is but a Fool, that relies not upon her.
Mock SONG LXIX. Full Forty times over, etc.
1.
JUst twenty times over, and twenty to that,
I musing, have wondered, what 'twas you would be at,
Whilst you pine, and look pale, like your Liquor that is flat;
For he is a cold Drinker,
Who now becomes Thinker,
Since thus runs the play
If you sit up all night, you are Ready next Day.
2.
There Is a pipe, lately Broacht, which would not be shut,
With Legions of Bottles prepared, for the Gut.
If you give but your mind to it, you will swallow a Butt:
Then stand not so dully,
But laver your Gully
With Beer Bowl in fist.
If you charge it but Well you may hit whom you list.
3.
Some idle Companions, when with them, you sit.
Will talk and fly high, as if the had all the Wit,
When (alas!) it appears, the have the Devil a bit,
Their biscuit Jests after
The are steept in their Laughter,
And pipes, being broke,
With Tobacco (once) out, they will vanish in the Smoke.
4.
Some stately proud High Boys, do rant it, and call
As if they could Tipple, the Devil and all;
But stand to them stiffly, they will, easily fall;
Then to it! never fear 'um,
Set Foot, and come near 'um
By Toping about,
Be their Heads never so empty, they cannot hold it out,
5.
Some pu'nys, whose Cheeks, are with blushes, over laid:
To fuddle a Gallon, will not be afraid,
Put them to it, and but tell them, They Drink like a Maid.
Then cry but have at it!
Box on them that hate it*
If e're, they refuse.
To Water, as thou do, or I, let them choose.
Mock SONG LXX.
1.
LOve is a Fable,
No man, is able,
To say it is this, or it is That;
And idle passion,
Of such a fashion,
It Is like, I cannot tell what.
B. 1.
Love is a True thing,
It is no new thing,
To called by good name, or bad;
A busi'd Action,
Of such a faction,
It Is like, to make a Man Mad.
2.
Fair in the Cradle,
Foul in the Sadle,
Always too cold, or too hot.
An arrant Liar,
Fedd by desire,
It is, and yet, it is not.
B. 2.
Fair in the Whittle,
Foul in the Spittle,
Always too moist, or too dry:
A very Tell-troth,
Papp't up with Hell Broth,
One knows not wherefore, nor why
3.
Love is a Fellow,
Clad all in Yellow,
The Canker-worme of mind:
A privy mischif,
And such a sly Theif,
No man, knows where, him to find.
B. 3.
Love is a Dam'sell,
Clad to the Hams well,
That wears a worm, in the tail
A mere pick-pocket
Yet, when we smoke it,
To find it out, we never fail.
4.
Love is a wonder
It Is here, and it is yonder,
It Is common, to all men we know;
A very chearer,
Evere one's better,
Then hang him, and so let him go:
B. 4.
Love is no wonder,
Over or under,
It Is common, as pissing a bed;
'Twill Cheat and Cozen
Folk by the Dozen
It Is better to hang, then be fed.
SONG LXXI. A Mock.
1.
TO Love thee, without flattery, were a Sin,
Since thou art, all Inconstancy, within;
My heart, is only governed by mine Eyes,
The newest object, is the greatest prize:
Then Love me just, as I Love thee
Until a fairer, I can see.
B. 1.
To Love thee, and to Flatter, were a Sin,
Since thou have, ever to me, constant been
My heart and eyes, are governed by thy will,
The principle is she, I Will stick to it still:
Then Love me just, and Love no more,
But just, as I Loved thee before.
2.
My heart, is now at liberty, and can
Know all that is fair, as you know, all that is man
Then why should you, so fondly think it strange?
Since that, I know, thine Appetite to change:
Then Love me, just, as I Love thee,
Until a fairer I can see.
B. 2.
My heart, is only yours, and can find,
By knowing thee, all that is Woman kind!
Then why should you (or any) think it strange
That I should like my choice too well to Change
But Love me, just and Love no more,
Variety I do abhore.
3.
I hate this constant doteing, on a Face,
Content never dwelt a week in any place;
Then why should you, or I Love one another
Longer, then we, can be content together?
Then Love me, just as I Love thee
Until a fairer I can see.
B. 3.
I like a real fondness, every where,
Where true Love dwells, content, last all the year:
Then let us like, and Love and live together
Since, if a part, there is no content in either:
Do thou Love me, and thou shall be,
The only fair and fairest she.
For Fruition, In Answer to Sir, John Suckling.
POx on those hearts that singly freeze with cold
I Love two minds, that one opinion hold:
Were I to bless the better sort of men.
I Would wish them Loving, to be Loved again.
Love Cormorant-like, on every pray does fall:
And's hunger starved, where there is none at all
It Is the Grand confidence, and mighty hope,
Unsheathed of fear, with winter tears dried up,
That Love, takes pleasure in; That can be none,
That only dwells, in Contemplation:
Like drowsy Dreams at midnight, when all day,
Our Bodies have been wearied, some strange way.
Oh! how 'twould irke me! sure I madd should go
Did I but hear my mistress, twice say no!
No thought our Expectation screw's so high,
But single! Woman soon can satisfy.
And what low-spirit, w'ont aspire, to that,
Which may be purchased, at so cheap a rate?
She Is honest, that does yield although Poor Fooll.
She be as hot as Summer, warm as Wool.
He that has mist her, has to say, at last,
'Ene pray who is will, if I must ever fast,
Then (fairest Ladies) use what nature gave
Never denying, what we ever, Crave
Confirming us that that is not strange at all,
Our Fathers did, we do, and Children shall.
Another for Fruition, In Answer to Sir, John Suckling.
GO on! Bold Boy! and put her to it be wise!
Not knowing how to keep lost paradise
The wicked plagues thou have, would never have cease?
But reign, at height! and would it not thee please
If, gently from night frights, for real joy,
Thou were awakt? who sleeps, can never en^oy
Not to enjoy, is worse, then not to have:
And that never cloyd, for which we still do crave
Who holds himself less happy, by that mean
Might hope, with as much reason, to wax lean
By feeding to the full; they purchased, once,
Oh how we relish it! and kiss for the nonce!
It Is more then requisite, upon this score
The choicest thing that man does, is not more
The world is wide; of blessings it is one
To Multiply Come! Come! it must be done!
As sure as Drink! Each one's obliged unto't
"He that never Occupyes, will never have fruit.
Women enjoyed (for they are none before)
Are like a fine Romance, read over and over:
Fruitions sprightful, and the play's not known,
What it is or is not till that act, be done:
To save our longing, that a blessing is,
" Heaven unknown, is a Fools Paradise.
And as in prospects, where the scrutimous eye
Unrandom'd can it self never satisfy,
And will not be confined, so Liberty.
Quickens that pleasure, which restrained would dye
He that has store to tell must needs be rich,
He Is only poor, that know's not, which is which.
Answer to Sir, I. S.
1.
GIve me ( dear Lad!) the pure white and red
When I court Meaden-bead,
Such even (unequalled) Grace,
Of Aires and other, you know what is in face.
Enough to make one mad! let me but have
A Beauty, that will move,
It Is all I crave;
Unhandsome dulls the Edge of Love.
2.
We know there are such things, as foul and fair
They no impostures are;
For though some youth (of late)
Liked certain color, at uncertain rate,
That does not warrant me, from choosing right,
If Black and Blew Ivy
With Red and White
That Fancy, is mere Fantasy.
3.
What boots an Appetite, if there is no meat,
That we can Love or Eat;
But if I view a Dish,
Well garnisht, and set forth, it is as I Would wish
As with our Watches, where the insid's made
Perhaps af Steel or Bras^,
Our Value's laid,
Upon the Gold or Silver Case.
THE Adventure August, 26. 1645.
'TWas in that Month (as in old Writ I find
Wherein the female, must be served in kind,
And more precisely, if the time you seek,
It was about the very wast oth' week,
Inclining toward the Navel of the day.
'Ene betwixt Hawk and Buzzard (as they say)
In Holbourn hight whence Gray's Inn Gate not far is,
Whom should I meet with, but my Friend Jack Harris?
The unluckyest wag e're Mothers smock was wrapped in,
'Twas that same Jack, whose Christen name, is Captain.
With single eye, he quickly me espied,
For why? indeed I was oth' surer side.
Oh! School-fellow quoth he, well met! and by trips,
I Am sure, we seldom use to part, with dry Lips,
So back he comes again, a good luck on ye!
Thou wile have drink, no matter who has Money.
Well! go thy ways! march on! I Will follow you,
On toward the Fair of St. Bartholomew!
But in the rode, near to the Wall of Hatton,
We happend upon Woman. It Was a fat one
And if Descriptions may not be distrustful,
She was full-ful in the wast, or very wastful.
For persons of her calling, you may ask all,
If amongst twenty, you shall find one Rascal.
She ducks it home, I speak it to her laud,
The Epithet, unto her House, was Baudy
Where though the Plying place, was then in Smith-field,
Was Wench enough as long as back could pith yield
To hold us tack -- indeed, of creature comfor^
One might have had our's Belly, full, butmum for it!
Jack profferd once, but what? quoth he by G -- I,
Will make exchange, with thee, body for body,
And I dare swear 't, had been no robery,
'Twas such a Pockie piece of Mobery
But that which made my Worship, laugh in the close,
She still was hitting Jack in the Teeth, with his Nose,
And that is much, you will say, whoever shall see it,
To think his Nose and Teeth should ever meet
But in as dead a time, as e're was thought on
In comes Su. Cox, of yore, but now Su. Broughton
With Whores as fast as hops and thick as fly-blows,
But could not hope for knocking here, but -- dry blows.
As when our Tails new sucked by Leech, are dry;
So are they now, as Kix, from Lechery
For were it upon pain of mickle worth,
I could not hint, much less have held it forth.
So, having pawnd our credit, there for eight pence,
We kiss, kind Mris. Laws, and so go straight thence
Indeed it was that mere necessity,
That has none moved us to it, I press it to ye,
Because we would not of the laws be guilty
The business was (like Norton's) base and filthy.
So now we bend our cause towr'd, Well of Clarke^
Unlike to Aristotle's, of you marken
Coming through Lane of Mutton street of Turnbe^
Where that Jone lives, whose plackets rent and torn all
Above the Rising of the Hill, there is one
The left hand, as you go a House of prison
Where Jack had been, upon a business,
I guessed by his wry look, and that a true sign
So passing by John of Jerusalem,
Whom we call St too what e're you call him
To the Red-bull-Widow we were one time wheeling;
Where some folk say, I Have had a fellow-feling*
But let it pass away Jack Harris rambles,
Down by the place where lofty Turk shows Gamble
Which we had seen too, but for dearth of six pence,
But they, who did, have never seen such tricks since.
Well! Jack drives on amain, a pox forsake him!
He made me sweat like grains, to over take him
I called out friend! look here! by Wiecham's Crosyer,
Here lies a pretty Girl in the lane of Hofyer,
Here at a Barbers House; I think it the man,
That kept Queen Madasina as his Leman.
I say (quoth Jack) come on! by Jove! I score her!
So never stops, nor stays, till at Pie Corner,
Where, in he turn's at house ye leped Castle.
For worse, full many a Giant often did wrestle
Here were the Beeves, the Muttons, and the pigs hot
A rare Encounter for man Chegan Quixot.
(He was a plaguey Mutton-man, ^ousavez,
But here is the Devil and all for the sowes Babyes.
For at this time it is (true, as I do tell ye)
You may have pigs, and wenches by the belly.
Then strait appears, do but observe the hap, Sir,
One Jack called Name sake, there concerned as Tapster,
As good a Lad, as ever handled spigget
Of powerful Sack and Ale (he is not for Swigget)
To whom our John (knowing no money stirred)
How do thou chuck (quoth he) my honey bird*
Replied he ( Capt. Dear) at all adventures
We Will wet our selves together. So Jack enters:
And trips up stairs, as quick, as come penny,
Where we find, what is before good company
Three female idle feaks, who longed for pigs head*
(For near this place, there is many a hundr'd ligs dead)
Three strapping Queans, much like, for hanch and butteress
Toboso's Dull, Mal, Tornes and Joan Gutterez*
One ^ accosted thus, wilt please you (Madam
TO accept of Gloves, for Fairings (would you had 'um!)
But quoth the Man of Ale, what is it do you lack ho!
Some Canns (cries Jack) an ounce oth' best Tobacco.
Which we sucked off, until our colors, rose high,
And knocked in peales, like to the Bells of Osney
Drink and more Drink still as for Gold, cried Midas,
Let Us drink out Thursday, never take care for Fridays!
When up there comes two Demi Lads oth' catling,
Whom I rebuk't (quoth Jack) Hall! hold your prattling!
But oh! 'twas such a charming dose of Music,
Would cure the Tarrantula were you sick,
Like to a Coffin, strung with guts of screech Owl,
And sung, as when sometimes you have heard a Bich howl
Comparison, I know, no fitter one,
Then your hoars Whooping in a Reed of Bitteron,
And made more Mouths, in quarter of an hour,
Then ever God Almighty did four.
Their Trebles (too) were both High base, beside one
Oth' sticks, was like to that the Devil rides on.
But up they strike (and so does Jack) a plain Dance:
That Cratchet, never comes into's head, oth' Main-chance.
But he is rare for Friscols nay what is worse
He treads a measure, like a Millers Horse.
But in the Close of all, I beckoning,
Unto him, said how goes the Reckoning?
How shall this Nag be curry'd? it is a short one
And soon enough (quoth He) you Fiddlers! sport on:
Play off your Canns (you Rogues) your Case I Will warrant,
If Fidle's goodand inded, Jack, had a care on it.
For why! when Head was light as Cork or Feather,
And they had been, some thrice by the Ears together
And were as drunk as ere, were Sowes of David!
(For while there is any Liquor moves they will have it)
And busi'd were 'bove stairs, with bonny Bess
H' had left them Fidle (yea and money less.
Jack urged me to it, I made not any word,
Disliking Bardolph's Edge of penny, Cord,
And vile reproach: for had there trial been
'Twould grieve o^e, suffer, for a Vyallin
And ( Oxford Organist, like Meredeth)
Live merry life and dye a merry death.
But 'twould not fadge -- Jack calling then his name sake
Did suffer what I could not do, for shame sak^*
He did but proffer, in his Far to Whisper,
To know how the Case stood, aut par, aut despair,
But fancying (as it seems) Jacks way of payment,
Cries Welcome Gentlemen! never seizd on Royment.
I proud it was no worse, as erst with Pordage
Rejoyc't at heart to be excused oth' Mortgage,
But clear of that (as after calm comes Tempest!
Ensures Sir Henryes woe, where you have him dressed
In a sweet prickle sweeter sure, was never heard
Lest when at Divil, Iteby -- pawned Everard.
Or else, that morn, at sign of Oxford, Beaton
For two and ten pence (faith! that was a n^at one.)
Well! from the Castle, as before I told ye)
We went to the sign, of (what the Devil would ye?)
'Twas (as I take it) to the sign oth' White Heart,
Or Sign that he was Drunk, for then he is right for it:
But thither 'twas we went, where God shall sa'me)
I thought the Drawers, or the Divil, would ha'me,
For honest Jack had called, for Drink and more Drink,
Then goes for money (which trick some but poor think)
But you may hope, as quick return, from Phlegeton,
As from Jack Harris, if once he be gone.
And is he gone? the Devil go with him! I swear,
I felt him going, whilst he stayed there
For Jack (although he seldom goes to Church)
Never comes to Tavern but he leaves in the lurch.
With Quart of Sack into a Box the wedge me,
Where who (the Devil!) did they think should pledge me?
The old Soldier's safe enough, and even as well is,
As heart, could wish, in the smoke with Peter Ellis,
Or else good man (though I) being now past hope,
He Is bayling Richardson, or Boiling Soap.
Then fancied I Jack's way of pay, by whisper,
The mark was fair enough, but faith! I mist her.
The Mistress liking no such trick in ten,
Would hear no more, then did Brickenden
His Fathers Lectures -- matter sure not much is,
I Will e'ne adventure, to escape your clutches,
When going, fairly off, in mine opinion;
(Drunk as the driven-snow or Leek or Onyon)
A fellow, tall of hand and foul of Finger,
Hardy of Toe (indeed he was a Swinger)
Begins to fall to's work, aboard he claps me,
(Or rather under board) whatever behaps me,
I must Endure, flings me, from Post to Pillar,
In troth I bore that time, like any Thiller.
Then did he quit me, in length, thirteen paces,
Takes up again,) A pox' on such Embraces!
Hold thy dead doing hand (quoth I) set Iron side,
But harder he, then was that Iron-side
Who managed Corbett, while yet lived my Grand Sir
Had no remorse, was like the Country Answer
To what is Clock! Iron Steel and brass upon it.
H' had made a puny, of Gines Passamont
(My story, sure may pass, in the rank, of woe
Yanguesian Carryers! never used Sancho so.
He Chucks me, too and fro, like Doit or farthing,
But could not get a penny, by the bargin.
Until there came to me, as best became her,
One of a great House, was Sir, name to Chamber
With Money, thick and thick, without ambages
It was the gross Remainder of her Wages.
Some seven whole Groats, and half reserved (sans mockings)
Out of her vast revenews to buy-stockings.
Which she did drop, peice-meal, since with her 'twas hard
And gave, by fits and girds as some get Bastard,
Or Devil Horse colts: finding her hardhearted,
We like a fooll and's money, were soon parted
And with dry thanks, to my redeemrest Betty
I e'ne go home, and there is an end -- that is pity!
Marston, Alehouse; April, 13th 1648.
I And two friends of mine; who never had been there
Did take a walk to Marston, after dinner.
And here is the truth (whatever praters say)
'Twas of all days, upon a Satursday.
And (if I do not much mistake the Chorus)
Pembroke his Exit had the day before us.
But w' had no Vollyet when we went hence
To send us packing with a Vengeance.
But fair and softly, out oth' East-port,
We march a long. But here is the best sport.
One of us three, whether he be sick,
I cannot tell well, but he took Physic;
And in a word (for nothing swerve^)
It was a Mornings draught of Scurvy
(Or else Sage) Ale (for you may have both)
And now to had broke the Jewish-Sabboth,
And Workt like mad, As for a Privy,
There was none, but where the Ox in Livy.
Might do his business -- It no scoff is,
He needed much a House of Office.
As for a Bush, be could not choose one,
Or any Ditch, but Madge or Susan
Had seen him do his need (for hark it pray)
Those passages are full, each market day)
At length he spies a Hedge, and we must line't.
He had no stool, but often untrussed a point.
With that one cried slid I could spurn ye (friend)
When think we shall come to our journey's end --
Hold! time enough says he- Indeed 'twas scarce one
(I think) oth' Clock, but we arrived, at Marston.
Where when we came (to tell the manner fully)
We went up toward the House, of the Ruff Cully:
Which, being near the Church, (as is my Custom)
I asked for the Wat'ring-house, thinking there must some
Be sold in the Town well knowing Thief to Gallows
Is not so proper; as near Church, an Alehouse
But faith! here is none! at last, a good luck on ye!
They show us where we may have Ale for Money:
Then longer there to stay 'twas folly for,
So strait we trade to the House of Oliver,
For so mine Host was named, whose sign was little,
Of none at all, only Childrens Whittle.
And Pissing Clouts of all sorts, there were in place,
And eke the Mothers Wastcoat with a greenlace.
And the old Boys Breeches too, which were not slovenly
For they were right true blue (by the Mass 'twas Coventry)
The Devil had been here, for (I Will be sworn)
What e're the Cry and Wool was, the Hoggs were shorn^.
But comeing near the Door, the Child beseeches One,
Having bewrayed himself, to help is breeches on
When strait (a sight which one much ^touter-fears)
In comes mine Hostess with hair 'bout her Ears.
For (truth to stain) the cause, of this her frowsing,
Was at her Neighbors house sh' had been a Lowsing.
But in good time she came (as it did fall out)
And having farmed his Linings clapped on Tayl-clout.
She prays us draw near house, we tripping than,
Gloss after found oth' Board, a dripping-pan.
But hark ye, friends! it is well, if they a crust eat,
The dripping-pan, was no such sign of Roast-meat.
For I believe (it is worth your listenning.)
Spit never went there since Nanties Christning.
But now 'twas used (with Comb, halterd with pack thread,)
To fetch the Nits out of young Alces blackhead.
Well having taken away the spoons and platter,
We sat us down (to make short of the matter)
Where ten to one, but that a body shall
Meet, with the stories of the Prodigal.
I mean in the ball but you may called a kitchen
For it was all their Room! when comes the Witch in,
Ugly as Pluto's dam, whom strait we call to's
To show a Room -- she lead us through the Malt-house
Thence to the Hay-born, but (I cannot tell how then)
At length, we crowded are, into the Cow-pen.
Which being unthatcht, the busy Sun, would scarce let us
Stay long, but thence, to the Garden, sown with harsle^s*
We drive away where, by chance, at a Barns end,
(Whither for many years God did no Cor^ send.)
We found a shady place, where, like to fin^ fools*
One on the Grass sat down, and two, on Joynt-stooles.
And for a Table, where to set the Water;
She brings the Washing block -- the legs came after.
Then like to Mother Gubbins mode in Chauce^
Sends out the Flagon coverd with a Saucer
And was (indeed) well filled (to the brin^ e'ne up)
Hostess (says one) go fetch a Drinking-cup*
Which spying ask, let us see! what pot d'y^ carry*
What Is in it! Medicines from the Apothecary
One swore it was, the others said sure 'ti^ not*
But furred it was, like old wifes Earthen piss-p^
The Ale, which sets one, soon one's wits on side
Was brewed (indeed) for the Bumps at Whitsontide.
Or Friday night, against Sunday, thinking then some,
Would come and sting their Noses, after En'som.
And was as muddy, to our senses outward,
As is a standing pool, whose cream is, Cowturd.
Well! here is to the King? all knowing then it down must,
One for a Gully-soaker, calls a brown crust!
But oh! how brown it was good faith! I cannot se't!
Hopkins affliction bread to this, was Manchet.
And was as sower, to the taste, I swear,
As if all Isreal's Leven had been there,
When they were feeding, on their Eastere Vittle.
They never marked, what St. Paul says of a Little.
But this I Will say (which not the least disgrace is)
I Am sure it made us make ill favored faces:
I pr'y the show me friend (if e're thou see one)
That looks but half so sower as did H. Beeston
Now having done, and all things t'ane away,
We call mine Hostess, ask her what is to pay;
A Groat (quoth she) for which we give her six pence.
Then she beseeches us to come, some weeks thence,
And none should be more welcome: urges reason,
Says Beans and Harslets, then would be in season,
But if I come where I Would not wish with Pug Jipp
I Will give you leave, to Kiss my Tail, wi^h Dog-whipp
Hence, this shall bear part, in my Letanie,
From Marston Alehouse, Lord deliver me!
To W. M. Esquire I being in a Course of Physic and newly recoverd of a Squinancy,
February, 1659.
FOr Burr of Ear, and Burr in Throat,
It Is better with me, then in the Moat-
Ed- Chamber, when for fear of Squincy.
Tongue was worm'd, and Woolsie Lincy.
Hooded Head like Hawke with Muzzle,
(A Sight, would put one, to the Puzzle)
Not unlike Ben. Johnsons Morose,
That was wrapped and wrapped before us.
Those thousand things (if I could speak 'um
As Hampshire-hony, Album Graecum,
Flack Wool, with Drop of Aqua-vitae,
Ears of Jew (a Dose would fright ye)
For the Vunla, the seeds of Cummin
With Roasted Egg and Dog's T -- some in.
All these are laid aside, but worse!
I'^e Medicines, now, ^or any Horse.
Potions and Vomits, with a Glyster,
Bolus and Mass of Pills, for Mister
Bold, diseased with St^ne oth' Kidney,
Or Bladder (not like Kester Sidney
Who was wont, with knitting Needle
'E^e he pissed, with Tool to meddle
To make passage, for his Urine.)
No! I am sound, as Roach: but curing,
Among other Griefs, (for nothing swerve I)
The Downright Dropsy, and the Scurvey,
For I am not, so full of Mocks,
Or Riches, to nick name the Pocks,
Or see the searchers, of the City,
To cry, when I am Dead -- It Is pity.
This man e'ne pined away with Grief,
He Is e'ne Consumed to naught -- in brief,
Let him make One amongst this Weeks
Account -- Consumption - Eighty six.
But hark you Friend, though I am still,
At Death's Door, will I fear none ill,
And therefore, send this, as a warning,
To tell you, I will come in the morning,
And Drink your Health, however fare I,
Till then, and ever;
Your, Bold Harry.

A Journey from Oxon, 1656.
HALL,)
WHen I lately came from Oxford,
Unlike that Lad, that under knocks board
When he does cry -- White -- I Love thee,
For, friend! I think you cannot disprove me
I never yet, was known to flinch,
From any Moisture, (less from Wench)
But being now, with foot in stirrup,
To take my leave, oth' City Syrup.
(E'ne at the Sign of Babe and Eagle,
Hight Billy shawes) they did inveagle
Mine easy Swallow, to a full Can,
(Whereat some think, I shrewdly pull can)
Though ways (I wot) were never more dirty,
In all my years (and they are thirty)
I was resolved (hap what hap will)
Upon the fourteenth day of April,
To take my Journey, toward London,
So spirr'd my Mare, and straight she run'd on.
But what said slipper, to his Bitch,
Soft swift! for neither Spurr, nor switch,
Could ever make her mend her p^ce,
She was no kin, to those, oth' race.
But fair and softly (thou know) far goes,
For all our ha^ps and so my Mare does.
Step stately, e're she trespass Shotover,
I once thought I should never have got over
But being near arrived at Wheatly,
(Believe't or not, I care not greatly)
My Palfrey (Hall) that then I rod on,
Moved, as at heel, sh'ad had a todd on:
And while Indentures, here she is drawing,
Like one that humming stands, and hawing,
When she was e'ne gone past recover
As though she would assign me over.
To Mother Earth, just, in the nick on it,
(For London Hackneyes have the trick on it)
Behold a wight, with Jade e'ne tired!
Like Duck, or worryed Cat! bemyr'd!
Whom after turmoyle, that would toil (man)
I found to be, a City Oyl-man;
Whom others some, do term a Salster,
Supposed son, of Oxford Maltster,
but by his Look, seemed half a Scholar:
(And faith! he proved a pretty Droller!)
Who having his sad tale recounted,
Took horse, (I do not say he mounted)
For why? (I Have seen a Tinker Mastiff
With Budgett on; to travel as stiff)
As did this Tit, less high, then some Ass,
Nor yet that Tit, that is Christened Thomas.
But of that race, that is so British,
And Gentle too, poor thing! not Skittish.
Whose Height, we reckon not by the hand,
But by the inch, ('it is quickly scanned.)
To curry's coat, would not much wrong one,
'Twould soon be done, he is not a long one.
Yet with this I'ade, whose Sirnam's spittle,
We came, by little, and by little.
(And that goes far, to the Inn at Tetsworth,
Whence (Friend I Will tell thee (he that sets
With Palfrey, that is but indifferent, (forth
(But his (I think) the worst that ever went)
E're he shall elymbe the Hill of Stoken --
I cannot say to's praise be it spoken
But to my Greef (I Will tell thee no lie,
For if I should, 'twere but a folly)
'Twould anger one, that is more then stoic,
And make him swear (perhaps curse) so thik
Though it did half provoke, my laughter,
To see the Beast draw hind Legs after
(As we did once, at Marston, view,
When after Table, Legs they drew.)
But up we got with much a do,
When lo! his Jade had dropped a Shoe.
But Shoe! what is that! worse luck! his Boot heel
Was torn away, then thought I's foot he will
Run (if he could) Stark mad, but 't will not do
He wanted Heel, and Palfrey Shoe,
And now my sleve was full with Laughter,
He drives on Beast, himself drives after.
'T had joy'd thee (Hall) as Babe does nipple,
To Have seen the Lame, halt, before the Criple.
But all was well, when come to Stoken
Church, in the next verse, or I Am broken.
Whence going off, who do think over
Took us, but one clep'd, Western Drover?
Not he, who furnished out, in the Leaguer,
Sir William Davenant's, Pert, and Meager.
I speak't not favor for, nor Malice,
He Is Christened John, Sir named Wallice.
Not he, whom Gill did notch, like Tallies
Nor he, who when he was beside.
In The Straw of Bed, cried out, I Am wi^e.
Nor be that drew out T -- so Stayward,
Though like, as ^obbin, to blind Bayard.
And half his Countrymen, a Jockie
And plangy Rogue, at Whore so Pockie;
For why? Quoth he, in every Town,
Upon the Rode, for half a Crown.
I Am furnished out, with trim Baggages,
(And who sets work, must pay the wages)
Nay! he would un^ertake for five pound,
From mount, to the peer, the wives, to S-round
But now, w' are come to Town with Church
Where Vick is often left, in the lurch,
For why! the Crew, of Country fellows,
Would hardly climb that hill for Alehouse
Much less, for Even-song, or Mattens,
They never pleased High-shoe yet, ne Pattens
(For Sickness green* or for the Pthisick
They needed had, none other Physic)
Now (truth to sain, for lies I cannot forge)
W' had mighty Ale, at sign oth' St. George,
Thou Have seen the Apes of Cherry lickum,
^o drunk I made the Wights, at Wiccham.
Where like Alvarez, in L^uellen,
(I fear, I shall not bring it well in)
Penny in pouch I gave to Begar,
Whose Coat never Blazoned was by Segar,
'Twas Verrey, of a thousand pieces.
Or like to Joseph's, who e're sees his,
And for this slender Ragg of Money,
His Motto was a goodluck on ye!
But did not after, throw old Shoon,
For why? I trow the man had none.
So on we ride, as mortal reckons,
Some seven miles more, to Town of Becons.
Field, where Horses up being put,
I went to rove, the rest to Host of the Crown.
Rut.
But knowing Wife, was Coacht by Jasper,
I made return to the Inn, in the Vesper:
Where was the Drolling Dr Wilson,
(Whose jest with mirth and laughter fills one)
With Scholars three, and Towns-man Zouch
Who, while we drank, did sleep on Couch.
But Sucking well, and keeping coil,
In Drover comes, and man of Oil,
Their Brains, with Mutton broth, half-setled
(For Wiccham-Ale, them shrewdly netled.)
At whom we laugh till after midnight,
When us to Kennel, Drawers did light.
But they, being drinkers, but for need,
And not for Custom, mark their speed!
They were as sick, as Dogs, next mo^ning
As who would take it, for a warning.
With that I take mine Host to task,
March to the Cellar, broach a Cask
Where, Vessel large I bid them fill't,
Till Tongue, and Liquor ran at tilt
Then does he, r^commend his Tapster,
(Who was his Eldest Son, by hap Sir)
Unto me for a man of Learning,
Indeed, 'twas beyond my Discerning,
But I was to believe't, the rather,
Because his Tutor, was his Father:
And they were so alike (God bless 'em!
For schollership (I speak to please 'em!)
Vt Canibus catuli -- Lad! (to try ye.)
Go on (quoth I) with your Qui mihi.-
But he would have it haec ades, though
I cried, 'twas then, huc animo.
Then 'bout we drink (for I would have it in)
Till not two words of (but all) Latin,
Was spoke in the Room: mine Host could talk never
A word of English, like the Falkner.
Oth' Marquess, but next drawing deep
Put him to silence, and to sleep.
Well! Parents head, being laid full law,
In The Cellars bottom, on I go
To the son, and he goes on to the Tap,
Then begs, that I would verses cap.
But one great Bowl and murdering X
Did so his Pericranium Vex.
That down, he fell on Father, Captus
Aebri^tate, minus Aptus
(As I thought) for to bring't about
When sober, since if there, 'twould out.
Like Hawk he casts, and there lies Yexing,
But not a sylable of X ing.
Where in this pickle (Precious Nose-gayes*)
I lodged 'um, like the sign oth' Cross-Keyes.
And taking Horse, from thence I packt on,
Nor stopped, nor stayed till come to Acton.
From thence, I posted strait to London,
And thither got before the Sun down,
Where lighting, at the Bore so blew,
With Cod so yellow, soon I threw
My willing body, to the Devil --
Where Wine being good, and Drawer civil.
I fixed my self with Quart and Friend,
To Drink thy Health, and there is an End.
An Allusion to Doctor Lluellin's Shon Price. Occasioned by some Scholars
beating the Soldiers, Nov. 6. 1646. Oxon.
Jack,
I Had wrote before, but's best, as 'twas,
For Ugly Cromwell -- Let that pass!
Thou know, one dared, as well, to have went in Hell,
As for to pass, the Soldiers Centinell,
No Letter, now (I Will hold a styver)
Goes without Bristol or Calyver.
And though surpised they are used, like sole on heel,
May be exchanged, for a Broom-man Colonel.
But mine once snapt (as it is hap hazard)
Is prizon'd -- 'slid they will slit her Mazard!
And faith! thou know, 't would come but odd in,
To tear the sheets of Joseph Goodin.
But now it comes (pry'thee be more sweet
And stay here Jack and wipe thy forefeet.)
Now if belief, where faith and love is,
I Have fed on nothing, but Anchoves.
And sirrah Jack! I think no body puts
In's belly better, then at Body cuts:
Come friend, 'twould make your Pallat water,
To dine on these, with sallat after,
I would the King (but Pox why wish I one)
Would give such Topers a Commission,
A Friend of yours, I Will hold a wager,
Would not be long, from being Major.
But yet (methinks) my Guts be lank yte,
I long for such another Banquet.
Our Food was sweet (believe you that too)
But sower sance came with the Tattoo.
And yet the Rogues (if I may speak one thing)
Cannot boast them Scot free, from our Reckoning,
Faith! I Would consent (if they would tarry)
That they should rent the Ordinary
We paid 'um well (yes ready down)
For every Pint, a good cracked Crown:
And (e're a Baker could have bolted)
The Po^tle-pot, was 'bout their Iolt-head:
As for the Quart (e're we could end it)
One at the Captains head did send it.
Oth' Chamber-floor (how e're disgusted)
The Blood say, thicker then the Dust did,
And now I think on it ( Jack) my muse is
About to tell what more the news is.
The youth oth' guard (but small friends) lift ho^
Came not to suck the Milk of Bristo'
But oh! his scarf, his scarf! God bless us.
'Twas neither Red, nor Blew by J --
But such (although we cared not for it all)
As often has frighted Bumpkin mortal.
View all the Colors, of Dame Iris,
View Pedlars Pack, what that same tire is
And if there be an odd piece, joyn't
See Shoe-strings, or see Cod-piece point;
I say, this Pedlar, nor that Rainbow,
Did nere such Color, died in grain, show.
It Was Orange Tawny (Jack) yellow as safferu,
As who should say, no color for a Tavern^
And this must fright us sure we are all undone,
As Mortal feared, when Bul-Calf came from London,
Or else when Cromwell, riding Dun Mare's Colt on,
Displayed his Tawny Colors, with --
Well! something comes to Door, with that, we cry all,
Curtis! Lay Kester down! unstring the Vial!
One bids the guard give fire, then blow their Matches,
Which we never thought to meet while we Sung Catches;
After some pause, (for this thou know would tire one)
He draws his Pistol out, his huge Cold-iron.
You Rogues (said he) I will revenge these crimes,
For I am sent from the Guard by Good Man Grimes:
Your Countenances shall look dully,
For want of Sack, to wash your Gully,
Your Carcases (without all Scoffin,)
Shall wish a Sack* But for their Coffin;
From your Anchores I Will you wean thus,
(Which fit you, for the Sports of Venus)
Your Oysters bought (I make no quarrel)
Sometimes in the (Peck, sometimes in the Barrel*
I Will send, to those well- minded Sisters,
That want provokers, more then Clysters.
Then't shall be said ('it is worth two shilling^ tha^
They are my Coolers, I their Billings-gat.
At this one night (brave Father Lasher,)
Our Major he, the Hober-dasher;
But to the Wise, one word's enough,
They swore Vdz niggs, we swore Vdz bluff^
And, e're a zealous eye could twinckle,
Their Hands they shake, their Hams they crinckl^
In what a shitten- Case, I wisse now,
Was that same suivelling Coward Biscow,
Which faster ran, Spectator Poses,
Either their Heels or else their Noses:
Who escaped, to the Main Guard went
Which was of Grimes his Regiment.
Knocked to the Guard they come, and faith that was hard,
Not one of them, without a Broken Mazard,
And all away, in such post have are gone,
As 'twere from Blincow, yes and Rowlandson.
On Oxford Visitors, setting up their Commissions on the College Gates, etc.
1648.
In The name of Father Abraham, what are ye,
Disturb our Peace it is time for to beware Ye --
But oh the Devils! here they come, they come!
The Children, run and cry out there is the Mumme.
Look here again! thus fly they to, and fro,
That Sucklings, Goblings never did fright Men so
Why what is the matter Friends? I hope that all is safe!
Do You run away, b' instinct like Sir John Falstaff,
And stare, and buffe, and puff, as if y' had been
Mauld, by the unluckie Rogues in Kendall Green;
The Women, in such tirrits, and frights do go,
Dame Quickly, near feared swagg'ring-Pistol so.
Why what should daunt 'em thus? with that, we turn us,
(For 'twas a thing, that might, in time, concern us)
When, half amazed, they cry out God save all!
The White thing yonder up against the wall --
Then -- Lord have mercy on us! well! we will see,
What in the Name of God, these Devils be.
So, on we go; where appears (at first sight)
Ten Misbegotten-Slaves, in black and white,
Incarnate Devils, who (forsooth) are sent
From far, by the Infernal Parliament
To greet us here (but it is untowardly this)
Not (as St. Paul says) with a Holy Kiss.
But here, these cursed Embassaders of Hell,
Must sit and Judge the Tribes of Israel;
And such a Jury, none could e'ere devise,
Since first the Devil held his Grand Assize.
Say what these Monsters are? who can describe,
The several Species, of this Roundhead Tribe --
But how comes Cheynel in amongst the rest,
Oth' Holy Sect? it is true, the Man's possessed;
He Will make mad work, and sniv'ling Wilkinson
Why who? (the Devil) should send him for one?
But why should Harris be excluded thus?
He looks, for all the World, like Aeacus,
Or bearded Moses in an Ale Wifes Hall,
Joined to the stories, of the Prodigal:
But 'twas opposed by the Lower houses sense,
Who thought, his Years, might use some Conscience.
Thus our blessed Reformation comes from Them,
As Christ did, once, into Jerusalem,
Riding on Asses-Colts: Conspirators
Of Hellish- Mischiefs! Oxford's Visitors!
Pox on such Visits! could we but dispense
With this, we would Court the Plague, or Pestilence.
All Souls looked to it, y' are Damned, and oh! God bless us!
They Will dare, to lay their Violent hands on Jesus;
Christ Church (cause Militant they will scourge with dread,
And Brazen Nose, though 'twere a Brazen-Head.
But oh! New College, double Woe to You,
Their Zeal puts all down, yea the Sisters too,
And why? you Traitors hated, and the Oath,
To Covenant with Baal, and Ashtoroth
The Gods oth' Nations, and your better sense
Distinguished Treason from Obedience.
Baliol shall fare the better being a Scot,
The Devil, look over Lincoln! Hood shall not!
Gods body! Corpus Christi do n't it please us,
Oriel shall down and Exceter by Jesus;
And let the Fellows know of Trinity,
We will reduce them to a Unity.
Cursed Generation! wretched viperous Crew!
Mischief to All! oh! to your Mother too!
Ere such be our Reformers we will be Damnn'd?
So many Knaves, and shall not some be flamn'd?
Gown-Men are privildg'd in such Causes; thus
Saint Paul did fight, with Beasts, at Ephesus.
So will the Paul's at Oxford, e're they will be
Enslaved, to Presbyterian Tyranny.
This is their rest, they suffer can no more,
Then Royal Martyr Charles has done before:
He that lives best, a tedious life prorogue,
Ere I Will comply, I Will see you hanged you Rogu^s!

To Mr. I. Gamble on his Setting and Publishing the Lyrick Poems, of T.S. Esquire
(Jack)
IN this Age when there is scarcely One
That Offers, at a Composition,
Save those sad Souls, within the verge go fall
Of Worcester-house, or Haberdashers Hall,
That thou should set thyself to setting lays
Does challenge, both our wonder, and our praise.
Nor is it in such a Mood, as't may be se'd,
That Gamble, had a Cratchet in his Head.
For (to be brief) it will be long enough,
'Ere any other, will enlarge the stuff
That Nature lent him to so blessed a use,
As is the setting forth of stanley's muse.
And to some Tune th'st done it! not by rote
Here Is nere a tittle, but is worth the note.
All is so humor'd, both the strong and weak,
Me thinks the very note, does seem to speak
And Emphase every phrase: so kindly done,
Stanley inspired the Words, and thou the Tone.
Here Is such variety, so seasoned too,
'Twill please the Women (that I Am sure 'twill do.)
Counter to the Tenor, of Tom Sternhold's psalm
That Is Mongrell'd, with Another, to the sam^
Thy Fancy, Trebles others and thy scene
Still changing, shows, thy base was never mean
Oh! how 'twill go against the hair of thos^
Who drink, in Rhyme! and exercise in Prose
Seeing thine idle hours, in their own way,
Have out done all their work, (and that their play.
The Song was Stanley's and has gain'^ the Baye^
Thine is the Prick, and thine shall be the praise
On the hopeful R. Baron of Grayes Inn Esquire 1647.
BAron of wit! 'twere sin to blazon forth
Under a meaner style, thy mighty worth:
^Twere but a trick of state, if we should bring
The Muses Lower House to Vote thee King,
Thou highly do deserve it, and the Bays
should crown thy brows to thine Eternal prays.
Whilst ushered by the graces thou are sent,
^o sit as King, in the Poets Parliament.
The famous Sidney's soul (I think) had gone
Relict till the Resurrection,
and never been espoused, now had not she
Round out her match, and wedded been to thee.
We have some things called Poets who although
They never were versed beyond the Christ-cross Row
And never swallowed possum, think the are able
To be partakers at the Muses-Table
Who never inspired were by the Nine Sisters
But took their L^arning as folks do their Glysters
And should you come to tell them what you lack
Their wits (like ware ill-plac't in Pedlars pack)
They have, but know not where; perhaps their bundle
May yield a ballad for the Widow Trundle
Or some such business wherein is shown
A mournful Ditty, to the pleasant tune
Fortune my Foe: or else-pox what do you call it
When they have no more concei^ then has ^ Mallet
But from their spungy Brains may squees^ a sonnet
When they have a sortnight chewed their Cu^ upon it
And shall such clumsi'd humors ever be
Renowned with the Name of Poetry!
No, 'twere a sin beyond a pardon, you
Deserve the Poets Name, and Laureat to
Thy Book swells high, thy Line's well wrought! not weak!
Thy words might teach Apollo how to speak
In better Phrase, which had he done like thee,
Daphne had never been turned into a Tree.
Thy twisted Plot so nice a hand has spun
You Would think, it were not only made but done
And you would not believe me, should I tell
How soon this work was done when it is so well.
Go on ( Dear friend) enlarge thy spreading Fame,
And let thy Pen mortallize thy Name.
To Mris. M. M. Delivered of a Daughter, after the Death of two Sons March, 1.
1659.
The Eastern Sages, guided by their Star
^rought less Devotion (though they came from far
To greet their new born Man-child God, then I
To Gratulate your safe Delivery,
Hence as a guerdon for your single-worth
May you need no deliverer, but bring forth
And let your num'erous offspring grow to be
The Hope and Pride of all Posterity!
Sure God considered it, and in this one
For two be took, made Restitution.
Thrice blessed be that Womb! whose plenteous Birth
Can furnish heaven, and yet people Earth.
An Epitaph Written on the Tomb of Mary, Wife of Tho. Ingram, of Temple
Newsham, in the County of York Esquire dying in the Birth of two Children, Oct. 2.
1656.
Reader,
WIth reverence approach this Tomb
Here lies, a Pattern for the Times (...) com^
The Glorious envy of her Sex, where all
Graces and virtues were habitual.
A Wife as one would wish! be this her Pride!
She never displeased her husband till she died.
To show her Womb uncurst a double-birth
Gave fruit at once to heaven, and to earth,
But heaven was their center, deeming meet
The swathing linen for their Winding Sheet,
The Mother, loath to stay behin^, but knew
Her infants parted, and departed too.
Triumphs, and Halelujahs! heaven's possessed
By Mary, with a Babe at either Breast!
They were too good for this World --
Here they lie.
Children and Heirs to all Eternity.
The Morning Visit on his Mistress.
IT had been morn, but fairer Celia lay
With Curt^ind-eyes, and so contrould the day
When to her sacred shrine, in lovely guise
I came to pay my Morning-sacrifice,
She lay like Danae when (blessed hap!)
Jove in a storm of Gold assailed her Lap:
But had he Celia seen, h^ had confessed,
She had best welcome, for so great a Guest.
Whose single Entertainment was such cheer,
As all the gods might come and ^anquet there.
Her Locks (or I might better say) her R^yes
Might from the Delphick Poets purchase prais
Rather then Phoebus beams, they do but light
The night of day, but these mak^ day of night.
A purer red, her Damask Che^ks disclose,
Then when the Sun salutes the bashful Rose:
Or when the morn in crimson Robes arraid
Blushes to think, her night sports were betrayed.
Her Lips (but here I want expression,)
For nothing, e're could make comparison
Were sealed, as if they pleasure took in this,
That modestly they could each other Kiss.
On which such balmy drops of dew arise,
As never distilled, from Trees in Paradise;
Whereat mine easy G^nius, prompted me,
To taste the Fruit, of this Forbidden Tree.
Twixt Eve's, and this sort, here the difference lies,
By that, Flesh fell, but this does make it rise.
Now, mine encouraged hand, presumes to Touch,
Her downy Breasts, whose rising hills, are such,
That every Grace might court them for her Sphere,
And all the Muses joy, to inhabit there.
In whose blessed ^allyes, Love and Beauty lie,
And there decree, the Murders, of her Eye,
Where, now, my willing hand (in fond amaze,)
Would seem to dwell* and circle in this maze,
But curious Fancy, will not be confined;
How well Love finds the way, though he be blind!
From thence, I wander ore the neighbring Hill,
Whose bottom sounts such odorous streams distill,
As Cupid, tired, with chasing Lovers hearts
Comes there, to bath, himself, and cool his Darts:
And Venus, when her Doves unharness'd were,
Has whipped 'em thither, for to Water there.
Here Is the Elysian Fields! the happy Grove,
Where beauty banquets, with the god of love!
Whose shade, with violets strewn, and Lillies spread,
Do seem a Chaplet, for her Maidenhead:
Where, after feasting, Venus, with her Son,
Sports, on the banks, of this same Helicon*
And Love-knots tie, (what pretty sport they have found?)
With grass, that grows upon this holy ground*
Which, curling round Loves fingers (prett^ Plot!)
He shows his Mother, what fine rings h'as got,
And kissing, did entreat her, to bestow.
One single thread to make a string for's bow
And ask't, (as if the Lad could something do)
W^ether, he might not have that quiver, too
But Venus frowned, and with the Flowers by
She whipped the Boy, for's waggish Knavery,
And sharply told him, with Majestic Grace
'Twas Sacrilege, to take, from such a Place
And though to see or touch, she did approve
Ye* for such tricks she would banish him tha^ Grove
So, took him by the hand, and thence they go
And wanton on the melting Field of Snow:
And when, they had kissed each other, and were Friends,
Venus (to make the Little Rogue amends)
Tol'd him, that, for his Bow she would allow,
The half bent Circle, in my Celia's Brow;
And, when he was resolved, to slay tame Hearts,
The Glances, of her eyes, should serve, for Darts:
And for his string (if he must needs have two)
Her locks would yield him strings, and fetters too.
Who, being thus provided needs would try,
To wound her, with her own Artillery
For well he knew, she did defy, and scorn,
The Shafts, which were, within his Quiver, worn:
(For, being baffeld, by her, on a Day,
He, angry, threw his Bow, and all away:)
But, since he is better furnished, dares defy,
His former Foes, and sue for Victory:
But wary Venus, did the Fight defer,
And caused her Son, to m^ke a Truce, with Her:
Which, being entered, Love and She Combine
To Conquer All, and therefore do conjoyn,
Their single Forces, and their Power in One,
Wherefore -- take heed! -for All the world's undone.
To the Lady, M. W.
SO does the Body, when the Soul has gone,
And pawned him, till the Resurrection,
Re-greet each other, as I salute You,
Who art my Life, my Light and Glory too.
But oh! what torments do those Lovers prove,
That find their Service, ill repai'd with love?
And must I be oth' Number? can there be,
A Loving Soul that more can Honor Thee?
Thou art my Fancy's Idol, and have won
My Soul, unto a Superstition,
That never needs Repentance; I dare dye,
A ready Martyr, to thy Diety:
And was there ever Saint so Tyraniz'd
To fire that Altar, where She Is Idolized?
But I Am a Younger Brother, not born high,
I would be Nothing, so I were no^ I:
Ah! shall not well-stampt Love go current, where
Unlucky Fortune, has denied a share?
But when two Souls together Match we do,
Must there be made a Match of money too?
^et not our Friends control our Loves, we will prove
Dead, to Obedience, so we live to love;
Though it is acknowledged that your worth alone,
Might make a Kingdom proud of such a one
None can dislike our Loves, for here is the odds
When Men make Others Lovers, Us the Gods.
Then be as Kind* as Beauteous and turn all
My former Plagues, into a Cordial
And may thy Body, nere my Purchase be
^f ere my Soul prevaricate from thee! moved,
Then (Dearest) speak my Life, with Pity
Or bid me Dye, because I over-Lov'd.
Epitaph, D. Arth: Ingram, E. A. Eborac. P. M. S.
REquiescite Magni Manes!
Illud jam ex morte consecuti, quod in vita meriti:
Quantu^ Bonum Mortalitas!
Incertum
Magnis ne Triste quia Potuit,
An Felix, quia Debuit mori:
D. Arthurus Ingramius E. A.
Claritudine Titulorum, Nobilitate Sanguinis, Amplitudine Fortunae,
Grande Nomen:
Sed
Rara Animi indole, and
Pietate, inter paucos eximia
Vt Reliquis omnibus, ita and se ipso Major.
Quotumquemque sc. videris
In Excelso humilem
In re lauta sobrium,
In inconsta^ti Constantem?
Iste Vir Maxumus
Fortunae bona primus, inter Virtutes, consecravit
Fuitque probus, and prae omnibus, and per omnia.
Ecclesia Filius, and Pater,
Pupillus and Patronus:
Suis Copiis, illi Militanti, Militabat:
Adeo Catholice Ben^ficus,
Adeo ingratiis Liberalis,
Vt se omnium faceret, atque omnes suos.
Charitatis in lectissimam conjugem, supramodum Egregiae
Cujus ipsa, quantumvis h^c erexerit marmoreum
Firmius adhuc monumentum s^cum gestat in Pectore:
Omnia in h^c Hero Immortalia,
Praeterquam una Mortalitas.
Quid fles Viator?
Non est iste, quem vides, virtutis Tumulus,
Sed Delubrum.
Englished, and Engraven, Thus.
REst ye in peace, Great Souls! who purchased have
What You deserved in Life, now, by the Grave
How great a Good's Mortality!
It Is an uncertainty,
Whether more sad or happy thing it be,
For that he could, or that he ought to dye:
Sir Arthur Ingram Knight
By Title, Noble Blood, and fortune's height,
A Name of Weight:
But,
For the rare endowments of the mind,
And piety, which amongst few has shined
As every other one he did outdo,
He, then himself, was also greater too.
Say, amongst thousands, one where shall thou see
In High Things, Low
In Plenty Sober too
And Constant in Inconstancy?
This Best of men was He
Who Fortune Goods amongst virtues, first, did sacred make to be:
Through (and beyond) all, was his honesty.
The Churches Son and Father, so
A Pupil, and a Patron too.
With his supplies he did supply her want
When militant
So Catholiquely Beneficial,
Whether men would or no, so liberal,
As he would make all men his, and himself all.
Of Love, to's choice Wise, not to be expressed
Whereof she bears (though here the marble rest)
A monument more lasting in her breast.
All things Immortal in this Hero were
But mere Mortality: --
Why Weepest thou here?
That which thou see within this vaulted Room
The Temple is of virtue not the Tomb.
Epitaph on R. Webb, hanged for Ravishing a Child of five years old May, 19.
1651.
HEre lies cursed Webb! who living, spun though short,
So fair a thread, a Halter choakt him fort,
^or Bardolph's like 'twas cut with vile reproaches
and Edge of Penny-Cord-so Bonas noches!
The Visit on Mris. S. L.
FAir Suaviana having made it day,
Before the Lazy Sun began to stir
And caused the Delphick Priests mistaking lay
Their offerings at her Shrine and worship her;
Guided by the influence of her Starry eyes,
I came to pay my morning sacrifice
A Yoke of Kisses, and a shower of Tears
Made up of sighs and prayers 'twixt hopes and fears.
Oh when she issued from her bed (Lov's Sphere)
Such sudden flashes lightened here and there
That as one Planet-struck Amazed I stood
To see such brightness sally, through a cloud.
Then over her world-like head, she gently threw,
A flaming petty Coat, which to the view,
Appeared by the reflection of her Eyes,
As the Sun sets e're winds and storms arise
But (as small Love would have it) on her Hips
It tenter'd was, as loath for so Eclips
So fair a prospect, underneath which place
Her scallop'd smock was pretty. Faith! it was.
And now the height of mine Ambition is
The hem of such a Garment but to kiss,
As on a velvet Couch she seated was
To sheath her Legs within a silken Case
Her Thighs were laid a cross, as who should say
A good luck on ye! blessed for all the day!
Which as she did untwine, you might have seen
^he place where Love and Beauty frolic in;
^he Port was to the view, half open set,
^he folding doors were Coral, hing'd in jet.
^ithin a Court, with Crimson Velvet lyn'd
which Love for his own Lodgings had assigned;
^here ^everal Chambers were, and beside these,
^here were no other Rooms, but Room to Ghuess.
Caetera desiderantur.
Translation, Eleg. 4. Lib, 2. Ovid: Amorum.
There Is no one certain in beauty* can me move,
There are a hundred causes why* love
If one behold me, with a modest Eye,
I Am fired: ensuar'd even by that modesty
Is she no Clown? I Am pleased with on well-bred
And gives me hope, she is Active in a Bed
If like the Sabine dames, she Coy, does fit,
I think she would, but she dissembles it.
If Learned; I Am pleased with Ingenuity
If Rude, she is pleasing by simplicity:
There Is one, who says Callimac^us to m^
Writs ill, whom I please, she will soon pleasi^^ (...)
Another, does me, and my Verses blam^
With her, I Would have a little of that same
Does she step stately, motion takes me a
Hard-hearted Girls, prove kinder, wh^ well man
This cause she sings, and can command her Voice,
To Kiss her, as she sings, should be my choice.
This over the murmuring chords runs swiftly and
Who can refrain, to Love so queint a hand?
This, to a measure, can herself advance
And bend her tender Body in a Dance:
To say naught of my self, whom, all sake^ move
Hippolytus would there Priapus prove.
Thou cause thou art tall, equall'st the Heroes dead,
And lie a mighty Body in a bed,
This short one's sweet, All comes to Net, is Fish
Both long and short, are even as I Would wish.
(...) she not bred; I ghess what if she were;
(...) she well dressed, she shows her good gifts there.
(...) taken with a fair maid, or a yellow,
^ay lust, even in a Black thing has no fellow.
Black locks dangle on her snowy Neck
(...) with such, was seen her self to Deck:
(...) yellow, such Aurora flow from thee:
(...) Love, fits me, for every History.
Youth me provokes, old Age provokes me too
For manners; that, this better to the view
Nay all the City Girls, one can approve
For all of these, I Have an Ambitious Love.
To R. B. Esquire having Read his Mirza.
THy scene was Persia, but too like our own,
Only our Soffie has not got the Crown,
Methinks it so concerns us, as it were
A Romance there, but a true story here.
Had Johnson lived to have seen this work h'ad sed
Thou Had been his bravest Boy! strok't the oth' head
Given thee his blessing in a bowl of Win^
Made thee's Administrator, or Assign.
But father Ben. I think was too much Poe^
To have much wealth (one need not ca^ who owe i^
Besides had Elder Sons, yet, where there is merit,
Or custom, Younger brothers ost inherit.
What though of's Gold thou have got the Devil a bit,
I'ne sure thou art heir apparent to his Wit
Which thou have in that vigor, and high shine
As when he wrote his Strenuous Cateline.
Hence be it observed amongst our Chronologers,
Since Johnson inspired Baron -- Years.
You are so much each other (no dispraise)
Robin and Ben are now synonoma's
Nor can time blast a Wit: thine's ripe as His
That Age, a Johnson crowned, a Baron this.
Elegy at the Funerals of W. Moyle Esquire May 28. 1660.
SAd, as forsaken Lovers! black as night light!
When yet un-chaos'd to be christend
Heavy as Laden consciences! and Pale,
As childish fears! Why mourn ye? What do you ayle?
You, that were wont for to out dare the Sun
In's Glory, now, as if your souls were gone
And left your bodies pawnd until they come;
Grief and disaster (only fill the Room.)
But Oh! --
I Have met the Cause! Behold! and see
The subject (once) of your Idolatry!
Moyle that was (late) the glory and the prize
Of Arts and Natures mysteries, here lies
Cold as the hand of fate, as breathless grown
As winds were in the first confusion:
Here sigh and weep! whilst in a sacred boast
I tell what you and all the world have lost.
Moyle! the loved Moyle! whom it is as hard to praise
As 'twas to imitate his works and ways.
He was (believe me Reader for it is rare?)
Que in whom all choice Gifts implanted were.
Man Miracle! who when alive possessed,
All ingrost virtue, in his Catholic Preast,
Where all the graces dwelt as 'twere their Sphere
And every muse, took up her Lodging there.
And sadly, now, to Celebrate his Hearse,
Burden their Eyes, with tears, their hands with verse.
His Countries Joy! and Grief! None was more free
Hearted, or handed, to the Poor, then He;
If good works prove short-lived here you may read
The sad (but certain) cause, It Is he is dead.
No truth in Proverbs! April showers (they say)
Bring forth the fragrant flowers of following May.
April has cropped our Prim-rose there it lies,
From hence transplanted, into Paradise.
Thus do we sow our seed, to rot in the Earth
That it may quicken to a second Birth;
Thus is he laid in Ground, never to Dye,
But to spring up, to all Eternity.
New Years Day, to my Dear Friend, W. M. Esquire
NOw Janus bids the world a good New-year
Faces about, then sets us as we were.
When (by your means) I Am cleared of that great doubt,
And care I had to bring the year about.
Now custom summons me, with every man
(As springs pay Tribute to the Ocean)
To make Returns, and offer at that shrine
Whence I derive, that all I dare call mine.
And (as in duty bound, should thither come
Not with a single gift, but Hecatombe.
See the Stenography of Dearth and Scant.
Some want no store, and I no store of want.
And can but this advantage gain thereby
To privilege my down right Poetry.
Oh could rhyme pay my scores! or make amends,
I Would have such verses at my Fingers Ends:
As without biting, Knuckles should distill,
H^d I steadily my Wit at will,
Till mounted ^n the spreading wings of Fam^
You should triumphant ride, and your vast name
Be Echoed, till it had reached either Pole,
And so become immortal as your Soul
Or were I rich! but this age will not yield
More Argent, to me, then my Griffon's Field,
Or could he with his displayed Sable Wing,
As Pegasus did once, create a Spring,
Which like Pec^olus with it is silver streams,
Should still bring fresh supplies to mine extrems;
Had I this wish, my Chief should never view
A Moyle but Argent, and imbordur'd too.
But oh! this will not do! no stock can serve
To Pay, or Praise you, so as you Deserve.
A Frolic to W. M. Esquire Returned from France,
1.
OH for a Bowl, whose wide cap^cious fraught
Was never fathomed by a Poets draught!
To welcome Moyles return, I Would drink it up
Of thanks, the day should be, of grace the cup.
2.
I Would court the driery, Sea-gods now to send,
Their Ocean in a frolic while each friend
Of Moyles shall suck it to an Ebb and they
With tears of joy augment it is flow again.
3.
Moyle whom so often we fancied it our bowls
Thy very name revived our duller Souls,
And lent so kind a flavor to the wine,
It relish't good or bad, as the health was thine.
4.
Thou travelst not like those, who only know
To spit at wine, to beat a drawer, or so,
To ruffle Boot-hose-tops, or pleat a Cuff
Or set a Circumcised, Cod-piece off.
5.
No, thou art better bred, thou went to view
Strange manners like the best, and learnd'st them too.
Our glorious envy, though we cannot tell
How much thou improv'dst thy parts, we know how well
6.
Hence at my noble Moyles, return from France
The winds did whistle, to the waves to dance
The sea-nymphs sung, and seemed to wanton more
Then when the courtly floods Leander bore
7.
But had they known, as I, how fair a shrine
Thou came to adore ( Hero's, being dull to) ^hine;
They Had snatched thee from her while each rival she
Had in her calm embraces swallowed thee.
8.
Now happy pair! where every mutual kiss,
Informs what pain it is to want that bliss:
The graces guard her! while each muse shall be
Or drunk in fancy, or in Love with thee.
The Hang-mans Motto upon Burning the Covenant.
BEhold the Covenant and Kingdom quit!
That, first set this on fire, now this sets it.
Rebellion, to the sin of Witchcraft, turned
The Covenant, doing thus, was, therefore Burned:
The Covenant (God bless us!) was an Oath
Like a god-dam'-me, to a Faith and Troth.
TO His Sacred Majesty Charles the II. At His happy Return.
SO comes the Sun after a half-years night,
To the Be-numb'd, and Frozen Muscovite,
As we ( great Britain's Influence!) welcome you
Who are our Light, our Life, and Glory too.
Your Presence is so Sovereign, counter Fate,
It makes, alone, our Island Fortunate:
Whilst we (like Eastern Priests) the night being done,
Fall down, and Worship You, our Rising Sun.
But! --
As Devotes (of old) did use to stay
Below the Font, nor durst approach to lay
Their Duties on the Sacred ^hrine, so I
(Not q^alifi'd for the Solemnity
Of Offering at Your Altar) stand at door,
And wish as much as they, who give you more.
May You live long and happy, to improve
In Strangers, Envy; in Your Subjects Love!
And married may Your Computation run
Even, as Time for every year a Son!
Until Your Royal Offspring grow to be
The Hope, and Pride of all Posterity!
May every Joy, and every choice Content,
Be trebled on You! and what e're was meant,
My Sovereign's care and trouble, may it prove
Quiet and Calm, as are the Effects of Love!
Last, having lived a Pattern of such worth,
As never any Age did yet bring forth,
Ascend to Heaven; where the Eternal Throne
Crown You with Grace, shall Grace You with a Crown.
St. George's Day, Sacred to the Coronation of his Most Excellent Majesty
Charles the II. By the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and
Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
Triumphs! and Halelujahs! let us Sing!
Hallowing the Day to our three Kingdom'd King!
Thus Vpper-Jove (once) when secured, and free
From Heaven-assayling- Gigantomachie,
Convened the gods, at his commanding call,
Like Charles and's Peers, at George's Festival.
'Twixt Those, and These, there is but one Remove:
Lievetenants here, to the Supreme above.
St. George for England! Andrew! Dennis. They
Are, but as Vigils, to our Holy Day.
A Roman Triumph is, Compared to This,
A Whitson Ale: A mere Parenthesis.
Scarce has the lazy Sun his Circuit gone,
But! Revolution! Revolution!
Our King Proclaimed! Restored! and Crowned! A Year
Like Plato's, sets us Even as we Were.
Blessed be the Time! oh may it henceforth be,
Calendar'd Englands Year of Jubilie!
For ever Sacred, to the Crown of Charles,
And early Fame, oth' ( Arch) Duke's Albemarles.
He that does claim, the Ends oth' Earth his Own,
May boast more Kingdoms, but not such a Crown.
A Crown which over your fairer Temples, hurled
As Drake did once, encircles all the World.
Thanks to the Eternal Powers! who preserved
For You, so Long, what You so soon deserved.
Shame on the Vile-Vsurpers! what their Source
Of violence swayed, your patience won perforce.
When, they were died in grain with Royal-Blood,
And nothing was, but as they made it good.
When Hell had so enhanc'd Rebellion,
To Kill the Heir and take Possession.
(Oh it is Forgiven! may it be Forgot!
He came to's own, and they received him not.)
When we oth' Loyal, in despair were hurled,
As if your Kingdoms, were not of this World,
When doubts and horror, as at Day of Doom Come!,
Had seized us all, then! lo! Your Kingdoms
See! where He Is Crowned! A King of Kings! like Saul!
As Proper too, it may be not so Tall.
As Glorious, as the Sun, on Easter Day,
^^rke, like the Morning Star, does gild the Way
Glocester's translated to another Sphere,
To Celebrate a Coronation, There.
^ sacred Treason to His Brother Prince!
^eizing His Birthright, and Pre-eminence!
^e took Possession first, received a Crown,
^o^-like-to-fade, an Everlasting One.
^s if the Grand Disposer, had assigned,
^ternity to Heirs by Gavel-kinde.
But -- He that Wished Himself and Heir were gods,
The next Son King of France, (as no great odds)
Had he but known, the Wealths your Nations bear,
TO had been his Wish, to have Lived a Subject Here
When the Great Lord of Light, with his fiery Horse,
Does, Gyant-like, rejoice to run his Course.
The Beasaunts of the Sky are Sabled quite,
Suffering Eclipse, from such redundant Light.
But Charles his Starry Peers, about Him Shon^
As if They meant, to rival with the Sun
(Yet had an Eagle-Eye been Scrutinous,
Sol in's full-Glory, was less Glorious)
Oh may Those Planets, that so Stately move
In The Lower Orb, be lately fixed above!
The Exalted Heads, oth' Higher minded Crew
Had they their Lights again, to take a Vie^
Of this fair Prospect, where Divinity,
Is so well tempered, with Humanity.
Graces, and Virtue, throned alike in You:
'Twould e'ne Convince them, Their Conceits were True.
Had they kenn'd Likeness, they had never grudged You room,
On Earth, as His Vicegerent till He Come.
Their King, and Our's are Name-sakes: for-'It Is true,
You Have been our Savior, and Redeemer too.
Safty was, erst, ill-sorted with Committee,
And Liberty, with Keepers, (more's the Pity!)
You are Anointed too, and so was Christ,
And to the King, must be annexed the Priest,
And Prophet too, for till You came, the Elves
Did serve God worser then they served themselves.
He that refused the Host, because it came,
As Christ did once, into Jerusalem)
Upon an Ass, had he seen What ours do,
He had Received it and been Thankful too.
The Devil's a Saint! Both Prester-John and Joan
Handle the Word, without a Mitten on.
Works are Apocripha'd, as little worth,
Every She- Hinter, would be holding forth,
The Surplice, Table, Rails, are raild upon
As the Appurtenance of Babylon.
But You Undiffering Sect, and Protestant,
The Church will cease, from being Militant.
Here Lord increase our Faith! for he that tells
Your Worth, and Gests, must needs write Miracles
At fatal Worcester, when Your Arms were grown
Wearied and faint with Execution,
By Multitudes oppressed, which still pursue,
(though utter Ruin could not injure You.)
^ust as the Soul is from the Body flown,
Unseen, You escape their Inquisition;
Like Bird from Snare: But -- like You there was None
'Twas like Your self: Without Comparison.
Wonders are not yet ceased: here is Divine Care
Kings have their Angels truly- Tutelar.
But! have! my Muse, unto the Muses King,
And low, present Him, with this Offering*
Know! and advance Your Friends! Your Foe^ keep down*
And may no Argyle-hand come near your Crown
And when the Princes of the World shall dare,
In an ambitious-strife, to Cull the Rare
Accomplished Lady, of such eminent Worth,
As Romance never feigned, nor Age brought forth,
To serve You as a Queen oh! may She prove
One, that shall still a^chieve Your Princely love!
Let the continuing pleasures of the Bed
Be iterations of a Maidenhead!
And as in years, so in Affection grow,
That when She Is Old, You may not Think her so!
Peace be forever here! no Disputes rise,
But which awes Most, Your Armies, or her Eyes.
May from Your Royal Loins an Issue come,
To Govern all the Tribes of Christendom!
And let that Race supply this Scepter's sway
While Stars shall rule the Night, or Sun the Day:
May al Your Sons be like You in the Extreme!
And ('it is presumed) None ere shall be like Them.
Else we despair when Fate shall lead You home,
Of One, like You, lest Jove himself should come.
Go late to Heaven! (though too soon I fear
They Will spoil us Here, to be enriched There)
Where (Course being finished) take (as St. Paul has
A Crown of Glory! -- You have kept the Faith.
This Day's Commemoration still remain!
But -- May I never see the Like again.
Anniversary, To the Kings Most Excellent Majesty CHARLES the II. On His Birth
and-Restauration-Day, May 29. Having Resolved to Marry with the Infanta of
Portugal, May 8th. 1661.
Connubio jungam Stabili, Propriamque dicabo.
LEt us fall down! and Worship Charles His Ray!
A Sun that Summer's all our Year to May!
Had Phoebus ever shone so fair as This,
Daphne had scraped her Metamorphosis.
The Priest oth' East, by the influence of your Worth,
Mistaking Shrines, shall now Adore the North.
The Guiding- Star, oth' Man-child God, did gain
Less Seekers there, than does our Charles His Wain.
Sol in Aspect with Luna! Lo! a Queen
Coming from far! famed Beauties Magazin!
The Wealth oth' World! the Glory of the Earth!
Fair as the Star that Blazed at Charles His ^irth!
A Queen of Beauty, Love, and Innocence!
Sweet as the Smoke persum'd with Frankincence!
A Feature made up of such Harmony,
As Nature had her nicest Symmetry
Reserved till Now Her more then Glorious Eye,
Shines like a Diamond set in Ebonye.
Whereat, the God of Love, does Light His Darts
When He resolves the spoil of sullen Hearts.
Her World-like Head, tress'd with such lovely Brown,
That every single Hair deserves a Crown.
Whose All, and Every Part, do so excel,
Plutarch could never have found Her Parallel.
For sure as Heavens have designed Her Queen,
'Twas only Charles could Match with Katherine
Thus like the Southern Queen She Is drawing on
To Commune with our Wiser Solomon
We Will 'bate the Spice and Camells (Gifts too small
Bringing Her single Self, She gives. Us All.
When two such Planets in Conjunction are
At every Birth, how Great will be the Sta^r!
Twice did Our Edward win the Peoples Love
By Mien, and Person -- Oh how Charles would move!
'Twixt their two Fates the only difference is
That gained it for a Time, for ever, This.
As erst to Caesar, Nations now agree
To yield to One that is more August than He.
How timely did the Grecian fall a sleep!
Had He now Lived, there were no cause to Weep
He little thought the Sea had ever hid
A World, where You should outdo what He did.
How timely did the Swedish Charles retreat!
And quit the Earth in dread of Charles the Great!
It Is one Excuse for Atheists, that they view
A Deity, and think there is None, but You.
When two such Planets in Conjunction are,
At Every Birth, how Great will be the Star!
Blessed be this Month for ever! Natures Pride!
Worth all the Seasons of the Year beside!
A month that such a flower has brought forth,
As decks the South, and perfumes all the North!
What York and Lancaster could never have done,
Till they were well Contracted into One.
This month scarce ownes a day that has not shown
More Triumph in it, then in Annalls known.
For un-beholden to his Vshers Shower,
He (of himself) affords Another Flower,
So rare, that, amongst Natures Glories seen
'Twill be unquestioned, which is King and Queen.
May from this precious Plant an Offspring rise
To make all Christendom a Paradise!
That every Son may be AUGUST, we pray
And every Daughter Lady of the May!
-- Tecum Sociales impleat annos
Quae nisi Te, nullo Conjuge, Digna fuit:
Ovid. On the Thunder, Happening after the Solemnity of the Coronation of
CHARLES the II. On Saint GEORGE'S Day, 1661.
Exhilarant ipsos gaudia nostra Deos. Mart. HEavens! we thank you, hat you
Thundered so!
As We did here, you Cannonado'd too.
A brave Report! as if you would outvie
Volleys, discharged by Charles His Cavalrie.
'Twas still in Clouds and Tempests your voice came!
For less than That could not have spoke His Name.
Thus Mighty Jove, Co partner in our Joy,
Out- sounded, what we cried, Vive le Roy!
A sacred kind of Rival-ship! for here,
We gladly Feign, what they are doing there
It Is a bold Challenge (but I Will make it good)
Whether our Flames were lesser than their Flood?
As if St. George's Bon-fires would have done
More, than They could, by Inundation.
Avaunt Philosophy, we plainly prove,
The World must burn, but -- It Is with Charles his love.
Well! let us think upon it! who ere did view
The Sun in's Glory, but 'twas cloudy too?
Great Lights Eclipse the ^ess: nor were you made
To shine so clear, as not to admit a shade.
You are Our Light, Our Comfort, and Our Hope;
Every good Subjects is, your Heli^trope.
Two Suns, at once, within our Horizon!
Whilst we dispute, which was the fairer one!
A pretty Emulation! Both did strive
Who should receive most beams, who most should Give:
'Til the upper-Lamp shrunk in his useless ray,
And left, the Conquering Charles, to rule the Day.
'Twas his Discretion, for had Both shone Bright,
Heat had surpassed the comfort of the Light;
Then did he weep for joy, -- A lovely weather!
It Rained as Heaven and Earth would come together:
And yet -- these April-tears, would have us know,
They grieved above, at Male Contents bel^w.
To see, that Heaven, should design a Court
For Us, like Theirs, and some -- not Thank them for it.
RITES on the Famous and Renowned, Sir CHARLES LVCAS, and Sir CHARLES LISLE:
Murdered at Colchester, Aug. 28. 1648. Their Funeral Solemnized, June 7. 1661.
ARe Lisle and Lucas Dead, and not Day done?
Nor a perpetual darkness mask the Sun?
Is Nature still alive? No Signs sore-run,
To presage general- Confusion?
Methinks their Fall should have unhinged the Spears
And the whole World bin made a Grave with Theirs!
Heavens! was Jove asleep? or's Thunder spent?
To put up this Uncivil Complement,
Without Revenge? -- Rebels will hardn'd be,
( Great God!) e're long, to make a Shot at Thee.
Ye Powers look to it! Attempts never swelled so high,
To threat a Surer Gigantomachy:
This only may prevent their rage, for fear,
Lest Charles and George should lead an Army There.
They Are in Commission still, but here is the odds,
Princes employed them then, but now, the Gods.
But Death was sudden to call either hence,
E're he could summon him -- His Excellence.
Fate might have spared Them longer, till They Had done
That Service thoroughly they so well begun.
England has dearly mist them, We had seen
Charles in his Throne e're this, and never been
Acquainted, with an Armye's Government,
Or what is meant, by Power of Parliament.
Black Tom had slept long since, with Essex-Calfe,
Lucas his other Blow had laid him safe.
Or Loyal Lisle (after his Noble wont)
Had fought, the other time in's Shirt, to have Done't.
Religion might have flourisht, learning flown,
When Now We have so Much (God help's) W' have None.
But Heaven for-stall'd Them; Saw, a Work so Great,
Inferior Mortals never could Complete,
So took't upon Themselves, to let us know,
The Gods above, must have a hand below,
As if Great Charles could not be placed in's Sphere,
Unless the Finger of Heaven Throned Him there.
Only the Eternal-Council did Decree
These Famous Soldiers, should oth' party be
And when the Gods had mustered all their Force,
George should Command the Foot, and Charles the Horse
But oh! the World must still lament the Falls
And Deaths of these Renowned Generals.
Valors! so awed by Circumspection,
Jove might have bin secured in the Garrison,
(As sure as Gloucester) Mars locked down and swore
Had he bin there himself he could no more;
For having ( past belief) maintained the town,
To save their Lives, they sacrificed their own.
Whose blessed Souls to the skies ascended are,
To raise for the King, Auxiliaries There,
To Garrison a Heavenly Colchester,
Where Jove, made mighty Lucas Governor,
That Royal Charles, and all his Loyal Peers,
Might Rule for ever, amongst his Cavaliers.
This only was Olympic Lisle his Care
To see that none oth' Rebels should come There.
Here lies their Prince's hopes, the Rebels rods,
Who living fought like Men, and died like Gods.
A POEM, to the King's and Queen's most Excellent Majesty's at Hampton Court.
1.
IN Rapture carried up above,
I found the Gods were All in Love:
And a Question started, -- Whether
Heaven, and Earth should come Together?
So Strongly were the Dieties
Affected with Our Paradise.
2.
But in CHARLES and CATHARINE,
Such Divinity was seen,
As their Pattern make the Odds
Little, betwixt Men, and Gods:
So They Vowed, We should have Here,
A Heaven, on Earth, as They have There.
3.
Juno need Jealous be no more,
(Though Cause be Greater than before)
That Her Brother-Husband Jove,
Should Descend, to Filch a Love,
Since, if He chance to quit His Sphere,
He would not leave a Godhead There.
4.
For when His Leivetenants know,
The Blessings, that are Here below,
And have once but understood,
That Woman can be Great and Good,
They Will Vn-people soon the Place,
And plant Their Heaven in Her Face.
5.
The half-ashamed God of Day,
Saw Her, and did Court Her Ray,
Wishing, that Her Glorious Eye,
Might excuse Him from the Sky;
Only He grudged His Sister Moon
A Share, in the Light, of such a Noon.
6.
Beautie's Great Queen, would have come Down,
In quest, of What surpassed Her Own,
And with Her brought the God of Fight,
As Gallant, to maintain Their right:
But subscribed, to Our Blessed Pair,
As Queen of Beau^y, God of War.
7.
The Dieties of Wisdom (too)
Had set their Station up, Below:
Mercy, and Justice fled from Earth,
Had made amends for Our late Dearth:
But wary Jove bespake Them thus,
There Is God King CHARLES will outdo Us.
8.
The Power of Love (as Mortals know)
Was Commissioned Down Below,
To Complement, that Sovereign Choice,
To speak which, Wonder wants a Voice:
Who, Proud of stay, does Heaven refuse,
'Cause Here, was such a one, to Choose.
9.
His Mother, seeing the pretty El^e,
Designing thus to Advance Himself,
Rebuked Him, not, (as erst) for fear
Of's Random-shooting Here and There;
But Charged Him to take up His Rest,
In CATHARINE's and CHARLES his breast.
10.
Thus has Our King and Queen of Love,
Endeared Themselves to Those Above,
Who'd quit Their Immortality,
If to Come hither, were, to Dye:
Wherefore to make Their Loves all Even,
They shall Dye late, and Go to Heaven.
In Hampton Court.
SI quis opes nescit, (sed quis tamen Ille? Britannas
Hampton Curta, tuos, Consulat, Ille, Lares.
Contulerit, toto, cum sparsa Palatia, mundo,
Dicet ibi Reges, hic, habitare, Deos.
On Hampton Court.
WHo knows not Englands Wealth (but who is He?)
Let him O Hampton Court repair to thee.
When he has scanned, the whole worlds, vast Abodes,
He Will say, that Kings dwell there, but here, the Gods.
On Bold-Hall in Lancashire, the Ancient Seat of our Family, now too like to
become Extinct.
THat Hall from Bold, did take it is Name,
And Bold, his Name again, from Hall,
Has told us, long, from whence we Came;
But, Lord knows, whither it is, we shall --
To Sir W. L. Of the Parliament at Oxon, Kal. Jan.
THou man of Worth! as free as Air to Friends,
Advancing Public not your Private Ends.
Your Countries Wealth whose loud desert does call,
To bring for New Years gifts, our hearts and All;
For now the duller sense has understood;
Though God makes years new, yet you make them good.
I therefore to your crowded Altar bring,
My little Self, and all an Offering:
But All this All is nothing, yet although,
In power I ebb, in will I Will overflow.
When if so mean a Present may suffice,
You have the offerers heart, your sacrifice.
And so you have my New years gift: but you
Must give me leave, ^o give one prayer too.
Live blessed in the lower house, till mighty Jove,
Shall make you Peer in the upper house above.
Satyr, on the Adulterate Coin Inscribed, ^he Commonwealth, etc.
THat Commonwealth which was our Common-woe
Did Stamp for Current, That, which must not Go
Yet it was well to Pass, till Heaven thought meet
To show both This and That were Counterfeit.
Our Crosses were their Coin! Their God our Hell!
Till Savior Charles became Emanuel.
But now -- the Devil take their God! Avaunt
Thou molten Image of the Covenant!
Thou lewd Impostor! State's, and Traffique's Sin
A Brazen Bulk, faced with a Silver Skin!
Badge of Their Saints-Pretences, without doubt!
A Wolf within, and Innocence without!
Like to Their Masqu'd Designs! Rebellion
Film'd with the Tinsell of Religion!
Metal on Metal, here, we may disclose;
Like Sear-cloth stripped from Cromwell's Copper Nose
Thou Bastard Relic of the Traiterous crew!
A mere Invent, to give the Devil's Due!
Or (as a Learned Modern Author says)
In their own Coin, to pay the Public Faith!
Heavens! I thank you! that, in mine extrem
I never loved their Money more than Them!
Cursed be those Wights! whose Godliness was Gain,
Spoiling Gods Image in Their Sovereign!
They made our Angels evil! and it is known,
Their Cross and Harp were Scandal to the CROWN.
Had, amongst the Jews, Their Thirty Pence been used
When Judas truckt for's Lord, 't had been refused
Worse than that Coin which our Boys, Fibbs do call!
A Scottish Twenty-pence is worth them All!
To their eternal shame, be it brought toth' Mint!
Cast into Medals: and their Names stamped in it!
That Charon (when they come for Waftage Ore,
May doubt his Fare, and make them wait on shore:
For, if Repentance ransom any thence,
Know! -- Charles his Coin must pay their Peter Pence.
Prima peregrinos obscaena Pecunia mores Intulit. Juv. To the Lady, F. C.
FAir Beauteous-Eys! why do you longer give
My hopes that life, to tell me that I live;
Since if ( Dear Fair! You with a smiling eye,
Do throw a Dart, thousands would gladly dye.
So wished a Death, and in the pleasing fire,
Of those blessed flames, give up their Souls to Expire.
But when a frown shall cloud those shining Eyes,
Which yet consume their Martyred Sacrifice,
And ch^ck a lively-hope with dead despair,
Making a careful life, a lively Care.
When this effect your mystic Beauties prove,
To make Love Conquer, and yet conquer love.
Eyes! tell me not I live, since you bequeath
At best, a dying-life, or living death.
Sweet lips forbear! no more a treacherous kiss
Shall never tempt my credulous heat to wish.
Those sugared baits, betraying Souls to smart,
With flattering smiles, to slay a lovers heart.
Though this you thought, too mild a death would prove,
To kill a Servant, with a Dart of Love.
And found a nearer way to Antedate.
My latter day, with a disdainful Fate;
Causing those lips which made me for to know,
You loved me once, now to procure my woe.
And to be once deposed from love, is more
A death to lovers, then was life before;
Lips say not then I live, since that your breath,
Can speak my doom, or kisses melt to Death.
On the Death of Mary Princess Dowager of AURANGE.
HAyle Graceful Mary! summoned up, to be
A Member Saint in the heavenly Hierarchy!
For, since your Virgin Name-sake's, peer'd with You,
Our Ave-Maryes, must be doubled too.
What Zeal of Glory did your highness move,
To rob low countries, to enrich the Above?
Or was it in a Complement you fell?
To leave, Henrietta 'thou a Parallel?
Was It not enough that Gloucesters shining Star
Shrunk the Pair-Royal to a Royal Pair?
And, as Ambassador, to fit, your State,
Prepared the ways, knowing the Path was Strait
But must ( Oh Times!) more Royal Blood be Spilt
To make atonement for the Subjects Guilt?
Thus the Lamb suffers, while the Fox still thrives,
Heaven's Kingdome's near! it is time t'amend our lives
Cursed be that Bane of Greatness! a Disease,
That scandals Galen and Hippocrates!
So loathsome (too) the Soul would hardly, own
The Body, at the Resurrection!
Here let our souls, flow from our eyes in Tears!
Like those whose hopes, are stifled, by their fears!
Another Branch, lopt from the Royal Tree!
And shall the Shrubs, remain secure, and free?
Oh! if our Earthly gods, like men, must lie,
How like the Beasts that perish, shall Vassals dye?
It Is, for the Nation sins, a Punishment
On Princes falls, they would live, if we would Repent.
All things immortal in this Lady are,
But mere mortality, and that lies here;
Whose goodness needs no gloss to set it off,
Say but -- 'twas Charles his Daughter, that is enough.
Oh! may her son, like her, live to Inherit,
The Mothers Virtue, and the Fathers Spirit!
When heaven, will bless, it is blessing, with that good
Which cannot be expressed, (less understood)
The Ages Joy, and Grief! Envy, and Pride!
You could not think her Mortal, 'till she died.
The wonder of her sex! less great than good!
Honoring her Name, Eno^led by her Blood!
But --
Cease to Mourn!
A Princess never dies,
But only as the sun does set to rise.
In brief, be this inscribed upon her Tomb,
Here lies the Miracle of Christendom.
O he! Jam satis est! O he Libelle! Mar.

Quo pergis Audax? -- Sen.
