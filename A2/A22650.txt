A Proclamation for a general Fast to be kept through out the Realm of England.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, observing the correcting hand of God upon
the Kingdom in many years Pestilence, the present interruptions of that long
continued blessing of Peace, and other signs of his anger for the sins of the
Land; and seriously considering the weighty affairs of State now in agitation
in the high Court of Parliament, out of His truly Religious heart to God, and
His tender care of His Kingdom and peoples welfare (according to the practice
of pious Kings and Princes in former ages, in times of common calamities, which
concern both Prince and people) has resolved (with the humble advice of the
Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament) by a solemn and public Fast, in
the first place to have recourse to the Divine Majesty, to implore his merry
and favor to Him and His people, as well for removing the present Judgments,
as for a blessing upon the great Affairs and businesses in hand concerning His
Majesty and the Public. And therefore His Majesty does hereby straightly
charge and command that a general and public Fast be kept and holden, as well
by abstinence from Food, as by public Prayers and hearing the Word of God, and
other sacred Duties, in all Cathedral, Collegiate, and Parish Churches and
Chapels within the City of London, the Suburbs thereof, and the adjoining
Parishes of Saint Clement Danes, Saint Giles in the fields, Saint James at
Clarkenwell, Saint Katharine Tower, Saint Leonard Shoreditch, Saint Martins in
the fields, Saint Mary Whitechappell, Saint Magdalene Bermond, and Savoy
Parish, upon Tuesday the seventeenth day of this instant November: And in all
other Cathedral, Collegiate, and Parish Churches and Chapels within the
Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales, upon Tuesday the eighth day of
December next ensuing the date hereof: All which His Majesty does expressly
charge and command shall be Reverendly and Devoutly performed by all His loving
Subjects, as they tender the favor of Almighty God, and would avoid his just
indignation against this Land, and upon pain of such punishments as His Majesty
may justly inflict upon all such as shall contemn or neglect so religious a
work.

Given at the Court at Whitehall the eleventh day of November in the sixteenth
year of His Majesty's Reign.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of ^OHN B^^^ (...)
