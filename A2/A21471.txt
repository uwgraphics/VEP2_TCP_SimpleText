The proclamacion / made and (...) kings highness our soueraygne lord and
his most honorable counsel / not only (...) exercisyng of long bows and
maintayninge of archery / within this his realm / but also for puttyng down
and distroyeng of Crosbowes and hand Gonnes / and other unlawful games / used
within this his said realm / contrary to his laws and laudable statutes in
that behalf made / ordained and provided.
THe King our soueraygne lord / of his high prudence and wisdom. Considering
/ how that as well in the times of his noble progenitors / kings of this his
realm of England / as also in the time of his most noble reygne / by the
exercisyng and vsyng of his and their subjects in shotyng in long bows /
there did insurge / encreace and grow within the same realm / great nombre
and multitude of frank Archers / which not only thereby defended this his
said realm and subjects thereof / against the malice and dangers of their
enemies / but also with a mean and small nombre and puissaunce / in regard
and comparison of their enemies / has done many notable exploites and acts of
war / to the discomfiture of their said enemies. By reason whereof / as well
our said souer^ygne lord the king / as also his noble progenitors / have had
and optayned great and tryumphant victories / against their enemies / to the
great honor / fame / renown / and suretye of his and their noble persons /
and of this his said realm of England / and subjects of the same / as also
to the terryble fear and dread of all outward and strange nations /
attemptyng any thing by the way of hostilyte / to the hurt or danger of this
his said realm. In consideracyon whereof / and for the better maynteynau^ce and
good contynuance of the said Archerye and shotynge in long Bows / diverse good
and politic statutes have been made / establysshed and devised / as well in the
time of our soueraygne lord the king that now is / as also in the days of
his said noble progenitors kings of this realm. yet that not withstanding /
for lack of good and effectuell execucion of the said laws and statutes / the
said Archerye and shotynge in long Bows / is sore and marueyloussy decayed /
and in manner utterly extyncte: And specially by the newefanglenesse and wanton
pleasure that men now have / in vsyng of Crosbowes and hand Go^nes / whereby
also great nombre of people be given to ydelnesse / and to the unlawful
destruction of dear / and other breasts and fowls / within warrens / forrestes
/ chaces and parkes / to the great loss and detriment / as well of the king our
soueraygne lord / as also of other his noble men and subjects. And it is
thought by the kings highness and his most honorable counsel / that the
Archerye and shotyng in long Bows / is like for evermore to be decayed and
distroyed by the vsyng hereof / and of diverse and many other unlawful games /
as playenge at Tennes / Boules / Closshe / Tables / Dyce / Cards / and other
unlawful games / contrary to the kings laws and honorable statutes made in
that behalf.

For the remedyeng and eschewynge whereof / and for setting up again of long
Bows / and auaunsyng and encreasynge of the said Archerye. The king our
soueraygne lord / straytly charge and commands / that no manner of person
or persons from hensforth / after this present Proclamacion and publycacion
thereof had and made / shote in or use any Crosbowe or hand Gonne / nor have /

shall be lefull for such person or persons to take and sease / or cause to be

And in case the said person or persons do refuse to deliver the said Crosbowes
or handgo^nes / to such person or persons as shall atte^pte to sease or
demand the said Crosbowes or hand Gonnes: than and in that case / the kings
pleasure and commandment is / that his good and loving subjects being nere

chargynge them in the kings name to go with him to the same house / for his

for great and urgent causes mouyng his highness and counsel / concerning the

commands that no manner of person / of what degree or condicyon he be / from
hensforth / after this present Proclamacion and publycacion thereof had and made
/ shall make any Crosbowe within this realm of England / except it be to and

And also in case any person or persons shall here after make the said Crosbowes

thought by the same rulers and governors conuenyent / upon condicyon that they
shall not make any Crosbowe or Crosbowes / but for such persons as may
laufully use the same. And furthermore / our soueraygne lord the king /
charge and commands that no manner of person or persons / shall bring into

shall not only eschew all manner unlawful games to be used in their houses:
but also shall without contradiction / suffer such persons as be and shall be

soueraygne lord / considering that there is great habundaunce and plentye of
all manner of graynes / within this his realm of England (our lord god be
thanked). yet ^^^erthelesse / by the inordinate iniquite and covetousness of
certain yuell disposed persons / more regardyng their own pertyculer (...) /
than the due order of charity and common welthe of this his realm / do sell
the same graynes at great and excessyue prices / throughout this his realm /
to the great hurt and impouerysshing of his subjects of ye same. Wherefore the
king our said soueraygne lord / by thaduyce of his said counsel / charge
and commands / that every person and persons within the Countyes and places
where their abidynge shall be / do show and detecte unto one or some of the said
Justices of Peace / within the said Counties or place aforesaid / as nere as
they can ymagen or coniecte / what should be the occasion or cause why that
graynes should be at so great and excessyue prices / and wheder the same do
insurge and arise by forstallynge / regratyng / or engrosyng of graynes (as it
is thought to his highness and his honorable counsel / that it so should be)
which is contrary to his laws. And to detecte and show (all favor and
dread put a part) the name and names of such persons / as they shall think
to be regratours / forstallers / or engrosers of graynes / or wheder there be
used any undue mean / by reason whereof the said price of graynes should be so
excessyuely enhaunsed. And furthermore the kings pleasure is / that all and
singular Justices of Peace through this his realm of England: do deligently
enquire and search for reformacion of the premysses / and punisshe the
malefactors and offenders / in that case offendynge. Not faylyng thus to do /
as they will answer unto the kings highness / at their uttermost parylles:
co^maundynge and straytely chargyng / all and singular Mayres / Sheriffs /
Justices of Peace / Bayliffes / Constables / Hedborowes / and other his
officers and minysters of Justice / as well within libertyes and places
priueleged / as without / that from hensforth and from time to time / they
shall se this the kings Proclamacion / commandment and pleasure / to be put
in due and effectuell execucion (all favor / dread / malice and mede utterly
set a part) as they will deserve his graces special thanks / and by doing
the contrary / to be in his high indignacion and displeasure.

God save the king.
