MOst indered and right virtuous Lady, and you the rest of the right
Worshipful these kind Cheshiere Knights; After my long being at Chester, in
the time of this reported trouble. I in my mellancholie walks be thought me of
the strange invasion of Satan, lately on the persons of Elizabeth Caldwell,
and her bloody lover Iefferie Bownd, together with that untimely actor Isabell
Hall widow, how that ugly fiende (ever man's fatal opposite) had made
practice, but I hope not purchase, of their corruptible lives, and brought them
to the last step of mortal misery. And then revoluing with my self, the
great goodness of God, in calling sinners to repentance, and withal, admiring
his gifts in the penitent, I could no less then write my hearts trouble, as
well to partake the world with my meditation, as to make them vvonder at this
Cheshiere chance; and thereby to plant or to engraft a kind of fear by this
way of example, how murder should hereafter bear any brain in sensible
creatures, considering how the very stones shall bewray the inward thoughts of
massaker. All these considered, when I had coted this wonder, thinking how
incredulous our Nation is in things true, and how uncertain they are to
believe fopperies feigned, I could no less for the certainty hereof, but call
you to witness of the proof, because since such an example was preferred unto
us, that others, not eye witness thereunto, might the rather assure themselves
of the same. First, I knowing your general griefs for the fall of so good a
Gentlewoman, and when no remedy could be, to comfort such a godly soul, as well
in her time of imprisonment as at the hour of her death, my own occasions
also for that time considered, and being your true and natural Countryman, I
could do no less but ostend my dutious love to you all in this kind,
desiring you to accept my poor mite, only considering this, the poor man's
plenty is prayer to regrate your worthy loves, and as truly as I live, that
shall be no niggard; for that night wherein I lie me down, and pray not for
you all, let my rest be broad-waking slumbers, and my quiet, waking dreams;
and that will be punishment more then I would enjoy for so regardlesse a good
as I so late and so happily received. True it is that diverse reports passed up
and down the streets of Loudon as touching this act of murder, but how
scandelously, as five murdered, three murdered by the means of six persons,
which your Worships know is false, only three murdered one; marry the intent
was to him that now lives. Therefore being an eare-witnes to this false alarm,
it made me more diligent in the setting forth the truth, whereby GOD in his
power might be known, satan in his meaning no doubt overthrown, and the
worlds idle fabling by a contrary meaning known. For as it was, it was, and no
otherwise, and thus it was, as your presences both at the examination,
arraignement, and execution can justify; and how odious it is to hear any
truth rackt by slaundering tongues, judge or imagine; only this, pardon my
boldness, witness the right, accept my good will in the publishing; and so I
commit you to Gods protection.

Your poor Countryman, ever yours, Gilbert Dugdale.

The practice of Elizabeth Caldwell, against the life of her own husband.
I purpose God willing to discribe in brief, the life and death of Elizabeth
Caldwell, late wife of Thomas Caldwell in the county of Chester, and daughter
to one Master Duncalffe of the said county; A gentleman of very good sort,
who fatherly and carefully trained up his daughter from her infancy, she being
framed and adorned withal the gifts that nature could challenge, and wanting
no good education, did in her tender infant years bestow her in marriage; to
the said Thomas Caldwell, giving her a good dower to her better preferring in
the said marriage; with a yearly newety of ten pounds, to extend to her said
husband, and his heirs for ever: and as the like matches do not often prove
well, so this Caldwell being young, and not experienced in the world, gave his
mind to travel, and see foreign countries, which tended rather to his loss
then profit, as also to the great coffeehouse of his wife, and other his
friends, leaving her often times very bare, without provision of such means
as was fitting for her, yt by these courses he did withdraw her affection
from him, so yt in the continuance of his absence; a young man, named Iefferey
Bownd, a neighbor unto the said Elizabeth Caldwell, and she as I said before,
inioying all the excellent gifts of nature, set his affections abroch, and
being a man of good wealth, spared nether cost nor industry both by himself
and others, to withdraw her to his unlawful desire, and omittnig no
opportunity in this suit; though she along time withstood their allurements,
insomuch that he feed an old woman named Isabell Hall, late wife of John
Hall, and preferred as an instrument to work her to an unlawful reformation,
so that in process of time, with many earnest persuasions, they wone this
silly soul, to their will; and having so done, the said Bownds insatiable
desire could not be so satisfied, but persuaded her of himself, and also by
the said Isabell Hall, to yield her consent by some means to murder her said
husband, the which she was though drawn to the other, yet very unwilling to
agree unto that. But by many and often assaults and encouragements, their
persuasions did work with her, and took effect; the which being obtained,
then were they as busy as before, devising which way, to set their deuillish
and most hellish practices aworke, preferring many devises for the
accomplishment thereof. And she often times entering into consideration with
her self, what a damnable part it was, first to abuse her husbands bed, and
then in seeking to deprive him of his life, was greatly tormented in her
conscience, and diverse times, earnestly entreated them to surcease in this
practice, laying before them the great and heavy punishments, provided for
such offenders both in this world, and in the world to come: but their hearts
being so deeply possessed by that filthy enemy to all goodness, that there was
nothing to them more odious then such persuasions, still perseuered in there
former wicked inuensions, and drew her to associate them in this villainy,
laying many plots for the performing of it, amongst which Isabell Hall as she
was very expert in such like actions, being an ancient motherly woman, and to
all men's judgments in her outward habit, was far from harboring such a
thought, yet as I was about to say, she advised Bownd to give to a brother of
hers, namely, George Fernley, five pounds, and she would persuade him, that he
should use some means to murder Caldwell, the which Bownd agreed unto, being
that to him all her motions were medicines, and for that her house was the
place, that Bownd and Elizabeth Caldwell did resort for there meeting place,
and he having an intent to further this matter, caused this Fernley to be sent
for, and conferred with him: and he being a man slenderly furnished with
means, agreed to this there motion, affirming, that he would delay no time
till he had effected their desire, though in my conscience he pretended
nothing less, but only to sooth them with fair words, for lucre of the
money, made a show to Bownd as if he were very dilligent about the execution
thereof, but still was prevented, in so much that Bownd entered into a great
rage with the poor fellow, and swore most terribly, if he did not dispatch
his business withal expedition, he would lay him by the heels for his five
pounds.

Notwithstanding, he made delays so many, that the old for, I mean Halls
wife devised with her self of another course, and willed Bownd to buy some
Ratsbane, and she would minister it in Oaten-cakes for that she knew Caldwell
much affected them, and they being made, his wife should give them unto him,
and so procure his speedy dispatch. Which devise he very willingly consented
unto, and used no delay in the matter, but presently repared to a town in
Cheshiere called Knutsforth, there bought the poison, and brought it to
Elizabeth Caldwell, and wished her to send it to Isabell Hall with all speed,
whereupon she received it, and instantly upon the receite thereof, Halls wife
sent her maid to Elizabeth, and willed her to send the spice she spoke to her
for: so the maid innocently went as her dame commanded her, and received the
poison, and brought it to the said Isabell Hall her dame, who presently did
take it, and minister it, (as I said before) in oaten-cakes: the which being
done, she sent them to Elizabeth Caldwell, where she and her husband did
soiourne; whereupon, being in the evening, she laid them in her chamber
window. In the morning next ensuing, Caldwell, as his accustomed manner was,
rose very early, and his wife still keeping her bed, he spied the cakes lie
in the window, and demanded of her if he might take any of them, she
answered, yea, all if he would, and thereupon he took some three or four of
them, and went into the house, and called for some butter to eat them with,
the which was brought him.

But let me tell you by the way, so soon as he was departed the chamber with
the cakes, fear drove such a terror to her heart as she lay in bed, as she even
trembled with remorse of conscience, yet wanted she power to call to him to
refrain them, insomuch as he himself did not only eat of them, but the most
part of the folks in the house, children and all, yet God bestowed his
blessing so bountifully on them, as they were all preserved from danger,
saving one little girl which could not so well digest them, which was a
neighbors child of sixth or seven years old, and coming in by chance for
fire: to the which master Caldwell gave a piece of acake, and she eat it, and
by reason she had been long before visited with sickness, she went home and
died presently, while the rest by way of vomit were saved. But that which
maistar Caldwell did vomit up again, two dogs and a cat did eat, and they
died presently also. Whether upon the force of that poison or no the child
died I cannot say, but well I know, they were all three brought within the
compass of murder for the death of it, and were all executed at Chester for
the same fact, as you shall heareafter understand.

Upon the death of this child, Elizabeth Caldwell was apprehended, and brought
before three Justices of the peace; namely, Sir John Savage, Sir Thomas Aston,
and master Brook of Norton, where before them she truly confessed all their
practices and proceedings from the beginning, even till that day. Upon which
confession, Bownd and Isabell Hall were apprehended, and brought before the
same Justices, and examined as touching the murder, and they very stoutly
denied all, afferming that they were not guilty to any such action, although
her confession in her Examination did manifest against them, being laid to
their charge: all which would not move them to acknowledge their fault, the
devil having so great a command over them. Notwithstanding, they were all
committed to the Castle of Chester, there to remain with out Baill or
Maineprise, till they should be delivered by due course of Law, according to
the tenure of warrants directed in such a case.

So the Assise approaching within few days after their commitment, their causes
and trial for that time was reiourned, till the next great Assizes holden
there. And whether it was by special means of Bownd made to the Judge, or for
that Elizabeth Caldwell was with child, I cannot truly say, but there they
continued from that time, being a senight after Easter, till Michelmas
following: during which time they were not admitted one to speak to another.
And for Elizabeth Caldwell, from her first entrance into prison, till the time
of her death, there was never heard by any, so much as an idle word to proceed
out of her mouth, neither did she omit any time, during her imprisonment, in
serving of GOD, and seeking pardon for her sins, with great zeal and
industry, continually meditating on the Bible, excluding her self from all
company, saving such as might yield her spiritual comforts, as learned
Divines, and such, the faithful servant of God. There was many of all sorts
resorted to see her, as no fewer some days then three hundred persons: and
such as she thought were viciously given, she gave them good admonitions,
wishing that her fall might be an example unto them.

Thus the deceitful devil, who has sometime permission from GOD to attempt
the very righteous, (as lob) was now an instrument to her sorrow, but her
feeling faith the more increased, and no doubt ^o her comfort, though in our
eyes terrible: for indeed so it ought, being sent from God as an example to
thousands. For where so many live, one or two picked out by the hand of God,
must serve as an example to the rest, to keep thousands in fear of Gods
wrath, and the worlds terror. But see her constancy. All the time of her
imprisonment, she used all possible means, both of herself, and by those good
members that did visit her, to convert all the rest of the prisoners, which
good work begun in her did take good effect, for she sent some days a dozen
Letters to several Preachers to be resolved as touching her faith, and the
want of a sound resolution that GOD had parsoned her offenses. Where the Lady
Mary Cholmsly of Cholmsly amongst others, together with the comfortable relief
of one Master John Battie, (no doubt both Gods Children) so relieved, as want
never grieved her conscience, but that she continued in zeal, without grief
of the worlds offenses both in soul and body: nay, not only her, but also to
the rest of the prisoners. For note, that death never feared or daunted her,
but only fearing she was not fully purged from her sins, till at the end,
as by her words at her execution appears.

This foresaid Master Battie well deserves a due remembrance for his
clemency and charity showed to that distressed and deceased poor soul, by
whose good means, which in mere compassion by him extended, did not only
receive comforts for her bodily relief, but also great satisfaction for her
soul, he often employed such industry to the Learned, both to repare unto her
themselves, as likewise daily in sending unto her good and learned
instructions: Surely, he deserves to be registered in the hearts of all well
disposed persons, and his demerits (no doubt) will find restitution at the
hands of him, who is the Pay-Maister for all such charitable deserts.

It is also to be noted, that after these three aforenamed persons had remained
in prison all the whole Summer, at Michelmas then ensuing the Assizes were
holden, and Elizabeth Caldwell had her trial, where she openly before the
Judges, and the rest of the Worshipful Audience, acknowledged her offense: for
the which she first demanded pardon at the hands of God, then of her husband,
lastly of all the world: and desiring, as it was ever her prayer, that she
might be as a Looking-glass to all that either did see or hear of her fall,
that by her they might see into their own frailines, and the infirmities which
are subject to the flesh. And having, as I said, acknowledged her guiltines,
was condemned. And by reason she was not then delivered of child, still
repriued: and at ye same Assise Bownd was indicted: and whether by evil
counsel given him, or for his own obstinacy, I cannot truly report, but he
would not answer to the Articles obieced against him, nor refer his cause to
GOD and the Country, but stood mute, though the Judges very earnestly moved
him to put his cause to trial: all which would not persuade him, and
therefore, according to the Law, he was adjudged to be pressed, receiving his
judgment on the Saturday, to be executed on Monday following. And for Isabell
Hall, her matter that Assise was not called in question, which yielded her such
encouragement, that she was altogether regardlesse of the good of her soul.

But Bownd, ever before he perceived how he should speed, pleaded to every
one whom he had any communion with, of his innocence, till he saw no hope of
life: then he, before two or three Preachers, and others, did manifest the
whole truth, and affirmed that flesh and blood was not able to endure the often
assaults that Elizabeth Caldwell had of him, and Isabell Hall: and upon the
Monday about nine of the clock, was pressed: where to every man's judgment there
present, he made a very penitent end, being heartily sorrowful for his
offenses, and very devoutly craved pardon of GOD and all the world, and so died
(I trust) the true servant of Jesus Christ.

Then that night next after his death, Elizabeth Caldwell was delivered of a
boy, which child is yet as I take it, still living with another boy she had
before her impresonment, the which are at the keeping of Caldwell their father,
and as it was generally reported, he made suit to the Judge to procure a
warrant to have his wife executed, within a certain time after her delivery;
but how true it was that he made such means, I cannot truly affirm, but sure
I am, a warrant was granted and sent the keeper for to have her executed,
within 13 days or thereabouts after she was delivered, the which was conuented
by reason the Cunstable of the castle, did mistake the delivery of the warrant
to the Sheriff till the date was out. Though she a senight before the time,
had prepared her self, only to receive the mercy of God, and terror of death,
yet it pleased God otherwise a while to prolong her days, which time given
her, she did not vainly spend, but employ her uttermost endeavors to obtain
mercy, and forgiveness in such rare sort, as if I should discribe the
perticulers thereof, it would not only be endless, and tedious, but I doubt,
to the hearers and readers, it would be though incredable, for in her might be
seen the true image of a penitent sinner, as the like has not often in these
days been seen, God showing his glory so abundantly, working her
penitency, as to me, and many more, was most admirable. For if she espied in
any one, of what calling or degree soever, that they wilfully or carelessly
abused Gods holy ordinances, she would reprove them for it, and curtiously
entreat them to amend such and such abuses; though some disdained she should
seem so to do, in regard of her own former offense, though indeed none
might better do it then she, having smarted even at her soul for her sins.
This is the frailnes of our flesh, we only disdain not our afflicted
brethren, but also there good admonitions: God of his mercy I beseech him give
us grace, that we may see into our fickle estates, and receive willingly any
reprofe that may tend to the good of our poor souls.

So by this means, as I showed you before, this Elizabeth Caldwell was still
detained in prison till the next Assise following, at what time Isabell Hall
was indicted, as an actor in this murder, and found guilty by the Jury,
condemned and executed. And Elizabeth Caldwell also received the death of
execution at the same instant, though my Lady Cholmsley very worshipful and
lovingly made earnest suit, unto the Judge for her deprive till the Assise
following: y^ which by no means would be granted. And she seeing her suit
would not take effert, being very sorrowful, like a kind Lady, went unto
Elizabeth Caldwell her self, and showed her she could not therein prevail for
her.

Indeed my Lady and others had an intent, if they could have got her repriue,
to have used means to the King for a petition, but seeing it would not be,
Elizabeth dutifully yielded thanks unto her Ladyship; and said she was very
well content to receive the death ordained for her. My Lady departed, and she
practicing her former exercises, I mean prayer, until such time as the Keeper
came and told her the Shrieffe was come to the Glouersstone, to receive her and
the rest of the prisoners appointed for death: and she very cheerfully
answered, I trust in my God I am ready, and farewell to the Law, too long
have I been in thy subjection: and so departing the castle, taking leave with
every one, and from hence to the place of execution, she some times sung
Psalms, and used other godly meditations, as was thought fitting for her, by
those Divines and godly Preachers, which accompanied her even to her death.

A Letter written by Elizabeth Caldwell to her Husband, during the time of her
imprisonment.
ALthough the greatness of my offense deserves neither pity nor regard, yet
give leave unto your poor sorrowful wife to speak unto you, what out of her
own woeful experience, with abundance of grief and tears, she has learned
in the School of affliction, it is the last favor that I shall ever beg at
your hands, and the last office that ever I shall perform unto you. And
therefore dear Husband, if you have, any hope or desire, to be partaker of the
joys of heaven, let my speeches find acceptance, and do not slightly esteem
what I write unto you, but read these lines again, and again, and lay them
up in your heart, where I beseech Almighty God they may take deep root, and
impression. For my witness is in heaven, that my hearts desire and earnest
prayer to GOD is, that your soul may be saved. And if the loss of my blood,
or life, or to endure any torments that the world can inflict upon me, might
procure your true conversion, I should esteem it purchased at an easy rate:
but since none can have salvation without true Reformation, both inward, and
outward, amendment, in changing the affection, words, and works, from evil to
good, which till you feel in your soul and conscience to be effectually
wrought, you have not repented, defer not time, but call to God for grace of
true Repentance, which may be sound even in this accepted time, when the doors
of Gods mercy are open, that so he may have mercy on you, least he give you
over to hardness of heart, that you cannot repent: and so you knock with the
foolish virgins, when the date of Gods mercies are out, and then nothing but
woe, woe, and vengeance: therefore the longer you defer, the harder it will
be for you to repent: and delays are most dangerous, for what know you how
suddenly, death may strike you, and then, as the tree falls, so it lies, that
is, as you die, so shall you have, if in true repentance, joy, if in your
sins, sorrow. Therefore says Solomon, All that thy hand shall find to do,
do it withal thy power, for there is neither work, nor knowledge, invention,
nor wisdom in the grave whether thou go.

O husband, be not deceived with the world, and think that it is in your power
to repent when you will, or that to say a few prayers from the mouth outward a
little before death, or to cry God mercy for fashion sake, is true repentance.
No, no, not every one that says Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
heaven, but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven, says our
Savior, Late repentance is sildome true, and true repentance is not so easy a
matter to come by, as the word does judge. Do not presume on it, and so run
on in your sinful course of life, and think to repent when you list, you can
not do it, for repentance is the rare gift of GOD, which is given but to a
very few, even to those that seek it, with many tears, and very earnestly
with fervent prayers. None can better speak of it, for none better knows it
then my self, my sorrowful heart has smarted for it, and my soul has been
sick to the gates of hell, and of death to find it: and to have it, is more
precious then all the world, therefore cease not to pray day and night with the
prophet, Turn thou us unto thee, o Lord, and we shall be turned, and with
Ephraim, convert thou me, o Lord, and I shall be converted: for except you be
converted, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

And because none can be converted, nor come unto Christ except the Father
draw him, never leave to solicit the Father of mercy to create a new heart,
and renew a right spirit within you, and call to remembrance the desolutenesse
of your life, I speak it not to lay any thing to your charge, for I do love
you more dearly, then I do my self, but remember in what a case you have
lived, how poor you have many times left me, how long you have been absent
from me, all which advantage the devil took to subvert me. And to further
his purpose, he set his hellish instruments a work, even the practice of wicked
people, who continually wrought upon my weakness, my poverty, and your
absence, until they made me yield to conspire with them the destruction of
your body, by a violent and sudden death; which God in his great mercy
prevented, and on the knees of my heart, in the abundance of his compassion, I
beseech him to forgive us all, and wash our souls in the blood of his Christ,
and to open the eyes of your understanding, that you may see by my example,
which the providence of God, for some secret cause best known to him self,
has appointed to come to pass. How weak and wretched we are, and how unable
to stand of our selves, when it shall please him to take his grace from us, and
to leave us to our selves. Therefore good husband, as you tender the welfare of
your soul, go no further on in your sinful race, but turn unto the Lord,
and so shall you save your soul alive. If you continue in your abominations,
and shut your ears against the word of Exhortation, you cannot have any hope
of salvation, for the book of God is full of judgments against wilful
sinners, and mercy is to them that repent and turn.

Therefore I beseech you use no delay, defer no time, but presently be
acquainted with the Scriptures, for they will lead you to eternal life: make
have, even before your hands part with this paper to search therein, that so
you may truly understand the wretched estate, and condition of those, who
following the lusts of there eyes, wallow in all sensuality, and so heap up
vengance against the day of wrath: even heavy Judgments, no less then
condemnation both of soul and body. As Solomon says, Rejoice O young man in
thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee, in the days of thy youth, and walk
in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes, but know that for
all things God will bring thee to Judgment. Remember he spared not the Angels
when they sinned; but cast them down into hell, nor of the old world but eight
only escaped, the rest were drowned in their sins because they would not be
warned. Baltasar, says Daniell, expounding the fearful vision of the hands
writing, when he was banqueting with his Concubines, thou art wayed in the
Balance, and are found light.

These and many more are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
world are come, search for them, and I pray God you may be warned by them, and
that you may seek the Lord now while he may be found, and call upon him
while he is near. Behold now the day of salvation, even now, when he in mercy
offers himself unto us, by preaching of his word, receive not these graces
in vain, but redeem your time, and run unto the house of God, and there in
the great congregation, power forth your plaint, with obedience hear the word
of God, and endeavor to practice what you hear in your conversation, for the
doors only shall be justified at the last day, the word must judge us, in
this life it works effect, for which it was sent: it either conuerts or
hardens, it is the savor of life, unto life, or of death, unto death, it is
offered to all: to those that embrace it, it brings life, to those that will
not be reformed by it, it brings death, to those that love and desire it, it is
the quicking spirit, to those that refuse it, it is the killing Letter, it is
no special argument of God his favor unto any, unless they feel the power
thereof working reformation in them, then it is the power of his spirit, the
pledge of his blessing. Ignorance must not excuse you, for the Prophet says,
my people languish for want of knowledge, and knowledge without practice,
leaves al men without excuse, for he that knows his masters will, and does
it not, shall be beaten with many strips: therefore make more conscience of the
word of God, then you have done, and love his Messengers, the Preachers that
brings that glad tidings, for to love them is to love Christ, and to hate them,
is to hate Christ, as our Savior says, he that dispiseth you, dispiseth me,
and it is hard to kick against the prick. And love the children of God that
profess Christ Jesus, for hereby shall men known, that you are my Disciples,
if you love one another says our Savior. And for the Saboth day, be ye
assured, that the Lord of heaven, has not in vain chosen it to himself,
commanding us to Sanctify it unto his holy name, no, no, if ever we desire to
be pe^takers of the spiritual Saboth in heaven, whereof ours on earth is but a
tipe, and a figure, then must we strive to keep the same Saboth on earth as
much as in us lies, which the Saints keep in heaven: they are at rest from
those labors that mortality is subject unto, and incessantly sing praises unto
the Lamb, so should we rest that day from the labors of our calling, and spend
the whole day in hearing of the word preached, praising the Lord publicly in
the great congregation, privately at home with our families, preferring such
other holy exercises, as may tend to the glory of God, the comfort of our
souls, and the good of others, which we are bound to perform so straightly,
as that we may not that day, be allowed to speak such words, as concern of
vocations. And how soever it please the world, to think of the great God of
heaven, and of the sanctifying of the Saboths, yet be you assured he is a
iealious God, and will visit sinners, and one seed of his word, shall not be
lost, but he will be glorified by it either in the salvation of those, who in a
good conscience willingly endeavor to sanctify them, or in the condemnation of
those who wilfully oppose themselves against his blessed ordinance, to
profane them: which is one of the crying sins of this land, wherewith the
whole Kingdom is infected: and if there were not some few to stand in the
gap, for whose sake the Lord does spear the rest, it had not been possible,
we should so long have escaped his heavy judgments.

O dear husband, the Lord has long since taken his sword in his hand, to
execute his vengance against all disobedient wretched, who turn the Saboth of
the Lord, into a day of wantonness, liberty, and licentiousnes, and although in
his great mercy he does yet forbear to proceed to judgment, as it were in
great mercy, waiting our repentance, yet there will suddenly come a day of
reckoning, all together: and the wicked make the patience of our God an
occasion to commit sin, and prophanes, yet let them know, the Lord will take
vengance of his adversaries, and reserve wrath for his enemies, and though he
be slow to anger, yet is he great in power, and will not surely clear the
wicked: though he defer the Sessions, yet they will come, and though he have
Leaden feet, yet has he Iron hands, though the fire light not upon Sodom
all the evening, yet it came. Do not therefore provoke the Lord any longer by
your prophanes, for he is strong, ready to punnish, and has promised, that
the person that dispiseth his word, shall be cut of. Did he not command a
man to be stoned to death, for gathering a few sticks* on the Saboth day, and
is he not still the same God? yes certain, his arm is not shortened if we
wilfully persist in our disobedience.

Six market days he has given us, to provide us necessaries for our bodies,
and but one has he chosen for himself to be a day of holiness, which is the
market day for the soul, wherein we should provide us of comforts for the
whole week. The excellency and worth of this day is unspeakable to those
that sanctify it. It is the badge and liuerie whereby they are known to be
the servant of God: to those that profane it, in spending the day in worldly
pleasures, drunkenness and filthiness, it is the certain badge and liuerie,
whereby they are known to be the servants of the devil, according to the
sayings of the Apostle, know you not unto whomsoever ye give your selves as
servants to obey, his servants ye are, to whom yea obey, whether it be of
sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness.

If my people will sanctify my Saboth, says the Lord, it shall be a sign
between me and them, that they may know that I am the Lord there God; and
blessed are they who have the Lord for their God. So that to those that
profane the Saboth, the Lord is not their God, but the devil: and cursed are
the people that are in such a case, therefore dear husband, defer no time,
put not of from day, to day, to turn unto the Lord, nether be you deceived,
for God is not mocked, the longer you run on, the more you set on the score,
and such as you sow, such shall you reap: for the Lord has said, He that
hears my words, and does bless himself in heart, saying, I shall have peace,
although. I walk according to the stubbernes of my heart, thus adding
drunkenness to thirst, the Lord will not be merciful unto him, but the wrath
of the Lord, and his iealosie, shall smooke against that man, and every curse
that is written in this book shall light upon him, and the Lord shall put out
his name from under heaven: but unto them that repent, the Lord has said, when
the wicked turns away from his wickedness, that he has committed, and does
that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. You see the
judgments of God are begun already in your house, happy shall you be if
you make a holy use of them, otherwise heauior may be expected, especially, if
you persist. In his mercy he has spared you, and does yet wait for your
repentance, do not you abuse his patience any longer, lest thereby you provoke
him to proceed to execution against you, but embrace his mercy which is yet a
offered unto you: for which, that you may so do, I shall not cease, to pray
whilst I live, to him who only is able to effect it, even the Lord of heaven,
who send us joyful meetting at the day of our Resurrection.

Your poor wife Elizabeth Caldwell.

The words of Elizabeth Caldwell at the time of her death.
FIrst she desired, that the Lord would give a blessing unto the speeches that
she delivered, yt they might tend to the converting of many of the hearers, and
also she said, that the word of God did not give her any privilege, and
authority to sin, but that it was her own filthy flesh, the illutions of the
devil, and those hellish instruments which he set on work: yet
notwithstanding, she ever had a detestation to those sins that she lived in,
but she affirmed that she wanted grace to avoid them, therefore as she had
given a great scandal to the word of God, by professing, and not practicing
the same, even so she desired the great mercy of God, to forgive her that
sin, acknowledging that she stood to presumptiously upon her own conceit,
and grew too proud, vowing and swearing, that she would never do such and such
things, but suddenly fell into the like again.

Therefore she gave Saint Paul's admonition unto every one, Let him that
thinks he stands, take heed of a present fall: likewise she exhorted all to
the dilligent observation of the Saboth day, saying, that one of her chief and
capital sins was, the neglect thereof, and although the world did recon and
esteem it a small matter, yet she knew it to be one of her greatest sins,
wishing all people in the fear of God, to make a reverent account of the Lords
glorious Saboth, she complained much of adultery, and said it was that filthy
sin which was the cause of her death, and was persuaded in her conscience,
that her afflictions was rather for that, then any murder she ever committed:
notwithstanding, she yielded her self culpable in concealing of it,
manifesting that in regard of her sins, and iniquities, she deserved a
thousand deaths, praying most earnestly unto God, that her self might be a
warning and example unto all there present, wishing them most earnestly to
serve the Lord, of what degree soever they were, if they were never so poor,
but were forced to crave there living from door to door, which done, then were
they happy creatures.

Then again, she admonished all to keep the Saboth, to go to the church, and
hear the word of God preached, for that was the only truth, and able to save
their souls. But as touching Papistrie, she ever hated it, knowing it contrary
and flatly opposite against the truth of the great God of heaven, and his holy
word, praying for the confution and desolution of the great whore of Babylon,
but most devoutly and sencerely, praying for the current passage of the Gospel
of Christ Jesus throughout the whole world, to the converting of thousands,
desiring that the very stones of the street might set forth the glory of God:
and withal, most religiously she prayed for the Kings most excellent Majesty,
and said she might call him her King while she lived, that his sacred and
royal Person, might be a bright shining lamp of Gods glory in the advancement
of the Gospel of Christ, and the overthrow of popery and superstition, in
these his Kingdoms and dominions. Then made known that she could teach as the
Preachers, for they taught as they found it in the word, and she was able to
speak from a feeling heart, very confidently affirming, that her sins were
the greatest reason of the dulnes and hardness of her heart, and the separation
of Gods mercies from her: and therefore she carefully advised all to beware of
sin, because it was hateful and odious in the sight of God, and all
reasonable creatures.

Concerning repentance, she spoke thus, that it was not in the power of man to
repent when he list, but the only gift of God, protesting before the Lord of
heaven and earth, that during the time of her imprisonment, being a full year
and a quarter, she had sought the Lord with many bitter tears, with broken and
contrite heart, to see if his Majesty would be entreated, and yet she found not
such assurance as she desired: but avouched what she did, was done in
simplicity of heart, whatsoever the world did other was censure. Moreover,
saying that in the mercies and merits of Christ Jesus, she hoped her sins
were pardoned, and said I believe Lord, help my unbelief. Also she said, that
in the time of her imprisonment, the Lord had been very gracious and merciful
unto her, for many the faithful ministers, and dear servants of Jesus Christ,
had recourse unto her, by whose means she had recovered great comfoorth,
praising the Lord for the same: yet notwithstanding, the world most injuriously
did deride, scofe, and mock them, which was most wicked and abominable:
saying, that if there were forty and two children devoured for mocking the
Prophet Eliza, what then shall befall of them that do blaspheme the name of
the great God of heaven, profane his holy Saboth, speak evil of his word,
and abuse his faithful Ministers. Therefore she desired all to turn from
their sins, and to turn to the Lord by true and unfeigned repentance,
praising very earnestly for her husbands conversion, and that her two children
might have the fear of God before their eyes, and that the glory of God might
appear in the conversion of prisoners, though it were with the loss of her
own life, so infinite was her zeal.

Then she prayed the Lord, that he would pardon all her grievous and heinous
sins in the bloodshed of Christ Jesus, beseeching him to cleanse her from her
secret sins: praying that she might be a Doore-keeper in the house of God,
and receive the meanest place of glory. Then said she, that if the great and
tall Ceaders of the Church of God have fallen, as David, Solomon, and Manasses,
how then could she stand, being but a bramble, and weak wretched woman.
Therefore she exhorted every one to depend only upon the Lord, and not to
stand upon their own strength as she had done. And greatly then desiring all
the people to pray unto GOD for her, she called for her Prayer book, reading
and praying zealouslie and deuotly to Almighty GOD, with her eyes lift up
toward heaven; which done, she requested that they would sing a Psalm,
reading it her self, and singing with a good spirit, that afterward she
uttered that she felt the mercies of GOD, and her soul was much comforted:
and hoped, that in the blood of Christ Jesus her sins were pardoned: and
said she could not amend that which was past: but was most heartily
sorrowful for her former sins: saying, that if she should live yet many
years, her desire would be in serving the Lord: therefore she desired him upon
the knees of her heart, that he would respect the will for the deed, and
accept her poor desires: saying, O suffer me yet once to recover my strength,
before I go hence and be seen no more. Praying likewise for all those that
ministered comforts unto her in her misery and distresses, that the Lord would
bless them, and continue them faithful unto the end.

Then forgiving, and asking forgiveness of all, making her self ready, saying
her bodily death did not dismay her, concluding with these her last words, Lord
Jesus receive my spirit: and so she left this miserable world, and dyed the
true servant of Jesus Christ, the xviij. day of June, 1603.

Now yet again remember our old beldame aforenamed, that uncharitable
creature Isabell Hall, widow, being the only instrument of this timelesse
action: who standing on the Ladder, and ready to suffer for her fact, did
notwithstanding very stoutly deny every thing that had been done in their
late proceedings, nay and abiurd it, had not Elizabeth Caldwell with
affirmation of all inserted her confession in that behalf: Who with an easy
repentance to the worlds eye, ended her life. Whereby may be seen how strong
the devil in some actions is, that she by whose instigation all was done,
both in the adultery and murder, would so impudently deny every particular,
notwithstanding the trial of the cause both manifested by Judge and Jury. But
thus we see the boldness of sin, and the coldness of the truth, till God in
mercy makes plain the truth of the one, and the wonder of the other. All
which tending to the example of others, may move us to lively repentance, which
not done, salvation cannot come, but truly effected, breeds both the comfort
of the soul and body. To which comfort, God in mercy bring us for his son
Jesus Christ his sake.

FINIS.
To the right honorable, and his singular good Lady, the Lady Mary Chandois,
R. A. wishes health and everlasting happiness.
MY honorable and very good Lady, considering my duty to your kind Ladyship,
and remembering the virtues of your prepared mind, I could do no less but
dedicate this strange work to your view, being both matter of moment and
truth. And to the whole world it may seem strange, that a Gentlewoman so well
brought up in Gods fear, so well married, so virtuous ever, so suddenly
wrought to this act of murder; that when your Ladyship does read as well the
Letter as the Book, of her own indighting, you will the more wonder that her
virtues could so aptly taste the follies of vice and villainy. But so it was,
and for the better proof that it was so, I have placed my kinsmans name to it,
who was present at all her troubles, at her coming to prison, her being in
prison, and her going out of prison to execution. That those Gentlemen to whom
he dedicates his work witnessed, may also be pertakers in that kind, for the
proof thereof, that your Ladyship and the world so satisfied, may admire the
deed, and hold it as strange as it is true.

We have many giddie pated Poets, that could have published this Report with
more eloquence, but truth in plain attire is the easier known: let fixion
mask in Kendall green. It is my quality, to add to the truth, truth, and
not leasings to lies. Your good Honor knows Pincks poor heart, who in all my
services to your Late deceased kind Lord, never sauoured of flattery, or
fixion: and therefore am now the bolder to present to your virtues, the view of
this late truth, desiring you to so think of it, that you may be an honorable
mourner at these obsequies, and you shall no more do, then many more have
done. So with my tendered duty, my true ensuing story, and my ever wishing
well, I do humbly commit your Ladyship to the prison of heaven, wherein is
perfect freedom.

Your Ladyships ever in duty and service, Robert Armin.
