By the King.
FOrasmuch as it cannot be doubted, but as the Kings most excellent Majesty
has taken great contentment in the mosts dutiful and devoted affection of his
Subjects of this Realm, testified by the universal and joyful consent in
publishing his Right, and acknowledgement of his Highness for their Sovereign;
so on the other side, his Majesty's Subjects will find much joy and comfort by
receiving knowledge of his gracious and loving acceptance of their said most
humble and most affectionate service and duty: It is therefore very meet, That
(his Majesty having of late, by his several Letters of the eight and
twentieth, and of the last of March, unto such of us the Nobility of this
Realm, and others that were of the late Queens Privy Counsel, as are here at
his Highness Palace of Whitehall assembled for the service of his Majesty
and the State, signified his Gracious acceptance, and Princely thankfulness
unto all his Subjects, of whatsoever degree or condition, for such and so
extraordinary demonstration of their good will, and commanding the same to be
further notified to all parts) we should publish and declare the same, by this
Proclamation, in his name. And withal, that we should declare and make known
his Majesty's pleasure delivered likewise in the said Letters, touching the
necessary continuation (during his absence, or until it shall please his
Highness to give other commandment and direction) of such orders and
proceedings for the preservation of Peace, administration of Justice, and
government of the State, as were formerly established, and stood in force
immediately before the late Queens deceasse, which chiefly, and in effect is
this: That whereas upon the deceasse of the late Queens Majesty, the
authority of the most part of the Offices and places of Jurisdiction and
government within this Realm, and in the Realm of Ireland, did cease and
fail, the Sovereign person failing from whom the same were derived, and
thereupon through doubtfulnesse, and want of authority for execution, in such
persons as were invested in the said Offices and places, the settled and
ordinary course of the affairs of the State (if remedy were not provided)
might receive disturbance and prejudice by discontinuance and interruption: His
Majesty in his Princely wisdom, and care of the State (reserving unto his
own judgment hereafter the reformation and redress of any abuses in
misgouernement upon better knowledge taken thereof, in his due time) is
pleased, and has so expressly signified, That all persons, that at the time of
the late Queens Majesty's deceasse, were duly and lawfully possessed of any
place or Office of authority, jurisdiction, or government, either Civil or
Martial within this Realm, or in the Realm of Ireland, And namely, all
Lieutenants, Sheriffs, deputy Lieutenants, Commissioners of Musters, Justices
of the Peace, and all others in place of Government, either meaner or
superior, (as aforesaid) shall be, and shall so hold themselves continued in
the said places and Offices, as formerly they held and enjoyed the same,
until his Majesty's pleasure be further known. And that in the mean while
(for the preservation of Peace, and necessary proceeding in matters of
Justice, and for safety of the State) all the said persons, of whatsoever
degree or condition, may not fail, every one severally according to his place,
office, or charge, to proceed in the performance and execution of all duties
thereto belonging, as formerly appertained to them and every of them, while the
late Queens Majesty was living.

And albeit the earnest and longing desire in all his Majesty's Subjects, to
enjoy the sight of his Royal person and presence (which has moved very many of
good degree and quality, and some of them having place of charge in the
Country where they dwell, to hasten and take their iourneys at this time unto
his Highness) be, for it self, commendable in them, and acceptable to his
Majesty, being an Argument of their abundant joy and gladness: Nevertheless,
because the overmuch, and too frequent resort and concourse of people into
those parts where his Majesty as yet remains, or which are far distant
from the heart of this Realm, is at this present inconvenient, and may prove
more dangerous, both in respect that the Country whither such extraordinary
resort is made, shall be ouercharged with multitude, and thereof scarcity and
dearth is like enough to proceed, and also because these more inward parts of
the Realm shall in the mean while be impaired in hospitality, and being
destitute of such assistance as is needful, it may be doubted to what danger
or disturbance, foreign or domestical, they may be exposed: His Majesty
therefore in his wisdom both graciously accepting the good will of his
Subjects, and withal regarding what is convenient for his service, and for the
security of the State at this time, it pleased, and does require, That such
concourse and resort into those parts be forborne, and above al others, of
those persons that have any place of charge or office, either on the Seacoast
or the Inland, or are of good degree and quality in their Country: And that
such orderly course be hereafter holden (in the discretion of all such persons
as aforesaid) for repair and resort to his Highness presence at his coming
into this Realm, as may conveniently stand and agree with the care and service
necessarily belonging* and to be performed in all parts of the Realm, to
his Highness and the State, His Majesty being no less graciously disposed,
and willing (in all convenient sort) to give contentment and pleasure to his
own eyes and mind, by the sight of his most Loyal and loving Subjects, then
they are infinitely desirous to enjoy the happiness of his Majesty's person
and presence, who (we doubt not) long before this time is already safe in this
his Realm of England, though his Majesty forbeareth to come presently to his
City of London, until those things can be set in readiness, which are fit
and honorable for the reception of so great and mighty a King.

Given at his Majesty's Palace of Whitehall, the fifth of April, in the first
year of his Majesty's Reign.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
