WHEREIN 1. Gods mercifulness. 2. Satan's maliciousness. 3. And man's
weakness Is made manifest.

TO HIS RENOWNED excellency, Henry Prince of Wales, Son and Heir apparent to
our most gracious Sovereign, increase of all Royal gifts and graces.
IF my means come in question, with the greatness of your Person, (O most Noble
young Prince) it may be denied intolerable boldness, for me to present unto
your highness so simple a Book in so plain a verse but, if the matter and
manner be equally balanced: The former, entreating of three most excellent
fundamental points of sacred profession, Viz:) first the creation, 2. the
Subversion and restoration of mankind. I hope no Christian will take exception,
but the patronage thereof, may well become your person.

As for the manner, composed in verse, If that seem too base for so grave
points of skill (which ought rather to be handled in prose,) I say with all
humility, that GOD is Author of both as well verse as prose) and that in the
chiefest secrets of Diuinty, for (next the holy Trinity) what points can be
named of greater importance, then mercy and Judgment:) And yet the most
princely Prophet David said: His Song should be of mercy and Judgment) If his
example will not stand my warrant: yet, all his Psalms with Athanasius Creed
of the highest Mysteries published in verse, (with our Soueraigns privilege)
will approve the manner (against all detractors. But some may yet replye; The
style of my verse is to low and simple to preasse into a Princes presence,
unless it were of an higher pitch, etc. I confess no less, and yet avouch
thus much, that the simpler my skill is, the more it shall commend your
Christian disposition (most Noble Prince) to accept of the same. In assurance
whereof, I have thus far presumed to publish these verses so familiarly (after
David's psalms) for the more easy apprehention and remembrance of the meaner
sort of people, to use at al times for their edification, that God may be
gloryfied in their salvation, which is the end of my poor endeavors, committing
the success unto his good blessing, with your most Noble person, long to
prolong many good years in health, with much increase of honor: Amen.

Your high excellencyes Devoted Suppliant. Henry Arthington.

Upon every letter of our Sovereigns Heyre-apparant, his most honorable Style.
(Viz:) HENRY, PRINCE OF WALES.
H HIgh heir apparent to our supreme King,
E Eternal God enrich thee with his grace,
N Now in thy Prime of age, with virtues spring,
R Resplendant still to shine, and grow apace,
Y Young years shall then, (with honors high renown)
P Prince Henry's fame imblazon in each town.
R Regard each day, to worship God aright,
I In all attempts, set him him before thine eyes,
N No danger then, Thy person shall afright,
C Christ Jesus evermore will send supplies.
E Extol his praises then with heart and voice,
O O Noble Prince, make him thy chief of choice.
F Forsake all by ways, leading unto vice,
W With such as learning love, always consort,
A Abhore them most, to lewdness that entyce,
L Let no such Roysters once with thee make sport.
E Esteem them best. That most in virtue shine,
S. So shall Gods love increase, to thee and thine.
The Author to the Reader of this Book.
1.
I Do not seek to feed their fickle brain,
In filed phraze, that set there sole delight,
Nor how to descant brave on things most vain,
Men's minds to lewdness thereby to excite.
Because the time so spent, as lost (or worse)
And brings repentance, (if no greater curse.)
2.
But: He that would be glad to hear and know,
The three estates of mankind in this life,
What love to his, the Lord does always show,
And how the Devil does sow debate and strife.
The former still dehorting all from sin,
The latter, luring to delight therein.
3.
And how Man's state unstable here does stand,
Subject to sundry hard conditions,
And still how God vpholds us with his hand,
From all extremes in our tentations,
If thou desire to find release in need,
Mark what is writ, The better shall thou speed.
4.
If any ask, why such grave points of skill,
Are put in verse (which should in prose remain)
Tell them again, it stands with Gods will,
Both means to use, To make the same more plain.
As David's Psalms, and Saloms songs declare,
Which, (for our learning) safe recorded are.

The goodness of God toward all Mankind, manifold ways.
THE FIRST POINT. In Creating all things for our use, and us for his glory.
1
O Glorious God, how much is Man,
For ever bound to praise thy Name, Genesis Chap. 1.

No mortal wight can rightly scan,
As all thy works express the same.
2.
If man look up with fixed eyes,
How wonderfully does appear,
Thy workmanship in azure skies,
Withal thy creatures planted there. Gene. 1.

3.
The Sun and Moon above the rest,
To guide and rule each day and night,
With listering Stars all ready pressed,
To pleasure us by shining bright.
4.
The Clouds that hang above our heads,
(As times and seasons do require)
Their fruitful shewers abroad do spread, Gene. 1.

To satisfy our hearts desire.
5.
If Man cast down his eyes below,
Genesis 1.
To view Gods Creatures hear on earth,
How do they all his love foreshew,
Still to preserve Man's vital breath.
6.
The Fowls that fly in firmament,
And all kind Fishes in the Sea,
Genesis 1.
To take and use, for his content,
With Beasts on the earth to rule always.
7.
And, for man's meat, God did provide,
All fruitful trees (save only one)
Genesis 1.
With every Herb that bears seed,
For man all times to feed upon.
8.
A pleasant place called Parradice,
God planted mankind first therein,
Genesis 2.
To have all times what heart could wish,
So long as he avoided sin.
9.
And that man might live in this state,
And never dye (unless he would)
Genesis 2.
The tree of life, thereon to eat,
God planted in that sacred mould.
10.
How truly then, might mankind say,
Psalm. 8.
How much are we (Lord) bound to thee,
For all thy favors every way,
Enlarged so abundantly.
11.
Much more. If thou lift up thy mind, Gods love to man.

To meditate Gods love to thee,
A thousand fould thou shall it find,
Exceeding others in degree.
12.
For, In creating all things else, Genesis 1.

God only said, (Let it be so?)
And so they were, (as Scripture tells)
His mighty power, (by word to shoe.)
13.
But, In creating Man, God said, Genesis 1, 26

Let us make Man: where by we see,
His perfect person to be made,
Even by the blessed Trinity.
14.
Which proves, man did far excel,
All former works, it is most plain: Genesis 1, 26 27.

As that which follows (mark it well)
In our own Image does contain.
15.
For ( by Gods Image) in this place, Genesis 2.20 Col. 3.10.

Is meant these special qualities,
(His Knowledge, Truth, and Holiness)
All which in Man, were pure likewise.
16.
For Knowledge, Adam first did name, Ephesians. 4.24.

(All living Creatures in their kind)
His Life also, was without blame,
And all the graces of his mind.
17.
So that in these was no dissent,
Genesis 3
Twixt God and Man, (for gifts most clear)
Save (all in God, were permanent)
But man might change, (as did appear)
18.
Behold Gods love to man, yet more,
Man's prerog. Gene. 1.
In placing him the supreme Lord,
Of all his Creatures made before,
To guide and govern by his word.
19.
And that, which most did show Gods love,
There was but one excepted Tree,
Which he forbad that man should prove,
Genesis 2.
On pain of death eternally.
20.
What could God, more have done for man,
Or, how much is man to him bound,
Psalm. 8
No earthly wight can rightly scan,
Then be not slack, his praise to sound.
THE SECOND POINT, Describing the malice of Satan toward Mankind, in
overthrowing their happy estate in Parradise.
1.
Satan's malice. 1 Pet. 5
Satan the Devil, our deadly foe,
(Envying our first happiness)
Did forthwith seek to breed our woe,
And bring us into wretchedness.
2.
Who, knowing Adam and his wife,
To be most wise (of Creatures)
He chose the next, to work their strife, Genesis 3.

And so the Serpent, he allures.
3.
Directing him, first to begin,
(With Eve, the weaker, as he know) Genesis 3.

And (if he could) to make her sin,
That afterward they both might rue.
4.
The Serpent then, (upon her speech)
(They might not eat of every Tree)
Did seek thereby to ouerreach Gene. 3.

Her unconstant simplicity.
5.
And thereupon, He answered,
Has God forbidden to eat of all, Genesis 3

(As who should say be not afraid)
Small sign of love, you may it call.
6.
The woman heareunto replies, Genesis 3 For then ye shall dye.

God gives us both free liberty,
To eat all fruit before our eyes,
(Save only one) Least then we dye.
7.
And hear behold, her weakness great, Genesis 2, 17 In soul.

To doubt of that, (which God said plain)
At what time thereon ye shall eat,
(Ye shall not doubt) but dead remain.
8.
The Serpent seeing her made doubt,
Genesis 3
To eat thereof for fear of death,
Does answer (like a Champion stout)
(You shall not dye) fear not his breath.
9.
For, Well God knows, the very day,
Genesis 3
That you shall eat thereon your fill,
You shall be like to him always,
In knowledge of both good and evil.
10.
The woman then distrusting God,
And trusting Serpents subtiltyes,
Genesis 3
Did yield to eat the fruit forbad,
(In hope his words would prove no lies.)
11.
But, That she should soon reap thereby,
Both honor, profit, and pleasure,
Genesis 3
And having taste thereof, did bye,
Her Husband likewise to allure.
12.
Genesis 3
Who, (by her smooth and flattering tongue)
Did eat thereof, with her also,
And thereby did himself great wrong,
To wrap them both in endless woe.
13.
Whereby, they lose that Image pure,
Genesis 3
In which God did them first create,
Both them, and theirs, still to incure,
Most extreme thrall, and cursed state.
MAnkinds lamentation,
Of their miserable condition,
By natural corruption,
Through Adams inclination,
Unto his wives persuasion,
By Serpents first suggestion,
Through Satan's instigation.
1.
ALL Adams heirs in him once blessed,
(Before his fearful fall by sin)
But since, accursed with the rest,
To wail our woes, let us begin,
Through Serpents first suggestion, The foot.

And mankinds first presumption.
2.
Once, were our souls the Image pure
Of Gods eternal majesty, Genesis 1 and 2.

Now, are they filthy and obscure,
Like Satan, in all villainy.
Through Serpents, etc.
3.
Once, was our wit and will most clear,
To know, and do the will of God,
Now, are they void of all such care,
And after sin, do range abroad.
Through Serpents, etc.
4.
Once, was our heart, sincere and sound,
Genesis 6
In love, joy, zeal, and constantnesse,
Now, are they quite contrary found,
Full fraught, with all deceitfulness.
Through Serpents, etc.
5.
Once were we holy, just, and right,
Romans 7.
In life, and in Religion,
Now are we stripped of all such might,
Profane of disposition.
Through Serpents. etc.
6.
Once, were our bodies rightly called,
The Temples of the Holy ghost,
Now are we all by sin inthrald,
With sundry kinds of Satan's host.
Through Serpents, etc.
7.
Once, were our members ready pressed.
All times to please the living Lord,
Now are they all, with sin possessed,
And follow it with one accord.
Through Serpents, etc.
8.
Once, were our souls and bodies both,
Planted in pleasant Parradise,
Now banish thence, (though most vnloath,)
To live in toil and miseries.
Through Serpents, etc.
9.
Once, had we health, and hearts desire,
Exempted from all kinds of woe, Leuit. 26

Now are we forced, (as wood in fire) Deu. 28.

All maladies to undergo.
Through Serpents, etc.
10.
Once, were we all Gods Servants free,
To live with him in blessedness, Of our selves.

Now, are we bound, (by death) to lie,
In hellish pain, without release.
Through Serpents, etc.
11.
Through Serpent chiefly, was the means,
(To wrap us in this wretchedness)
And Woman next (in hope of gains)
By yielding unto wickedness.
Yet Adams fact was worthy blame,
In trusting of his lying dame.
12.
Thus; Satan, Father of all lies, Ioh. 8.44

Abusd the Serpents tongue to lie,
And he, the woman's tongue likewise,
And she her Husband craftily,
Thus by their lies, and trust therein,
All were accursed for that sin.
Whether (by the works of the Law) any of Adams heirs may be restored into
Gods favor.
1
SOme Men suppose, that though man's fall
Did bring his of spring into pain,
Objection
Yet God his Law gave unto all,
To reconcile mankind again.
2.
Else they allege, it must needs check,
God of Injustice, sundry ways,
To give a Law for to correct,
Man's sinful courses all his days.
3.
And yet to grant no grace at all,
For mortal Man to keep the same,
But, to condemn both great and small,
That live not well, without all blame.
4.
Answered
I Will thus answer (by demand)
What master will they charge with wrong,
For asking stock at Servants hand,
That does unto himself belong.
5.
Or, if the Servant wast the same,
In pride and prodigality,
Will any man the master blame,
To pack him, for his treachery, Answered

6.
Even so it stands, twixt God and us,
(When he requires obedience)
For want thereof, he may us curse,
And yet none charge him with offense.
7.
Because, when first God gave his law, It was then graft in man's nature, etc.

(Whilst mankind was in Paradise)
He made them able for to show,
Obedience due in perfect wise.
8.
Now, seeing Adam and his seed,
Have broke the bonds that once God made,
Shall not he justify his deed,
To see the forfaytures be paid.
9.
Then will they last of all demand,
(If Gods Law do not justify)
Why did he Moses then command, Objection

(To write it for posterity.)
10.
I answer, with the Apostle Paul, Answer.

If Gods Law any man could save, Gal. 2.

Then Christ his death was vain (for all,)
For Saviors two, we need not have.
11.
And yet no want in Gods law found.
No default in the law.
For why? It is his holy will)
But sin, man's nature has so bound,
That we cannot the same fulfill.
12.
So that; none can Gods Law accuse,
To be unjust, or sent in vain,
Several uses in the law.
For why? It serves to good use,

13.
The first: It lets us see the state
Of our created holiness,
That we thereon might contemplate,
With praise to God, for his kindness.
14.

Our woeful state (by Adams fall)
That we to Christ, for help might flee,
To save our souls from endless thrall.
15.

And Gods just judgment for the same,
That we might all avoid those grins,
And so to keep our souls from shame.
16

How we should walk to please the Lord,
That for his grace, we still might pray:
To line according to his word.
How Gods Justice and mercy join both together in mankinds restoration.
1.
ALmighty God, beholding Man,
(Depryued of his blessedness,)
To look with visage pale and wan,
(By reason of his wretchedness.)
2.
And knowing him in least default,
No Tempter (as the others were)
But sore abusd (by their assault)
And utter spoyld (as did appear.)
3.
Then, In his great compassion,
Of mankinds extreme misery,
God entered consultation,
Their rewfull state to remedy,
4.
That, Where their sins deserved death,
(Even by just doom for evermore)
Mercy alone, (as Scripture says)
Could not man's happy state restore,
5.
Unless Gods Justice therewithal,
(By suffering death, were satisfied,)
Then God to counsel did both call,
And (by consent) has thus decreed.
6.
That: Where Man's nature did offend,
And so deserved for to dye,
Man's nature, should that fault amend
And suffer death accordingly.
7.
Hebr. 9.
Yet so: (as he should overcome)
Both Death and Satan, Prince of Hell,
And so restore mankinds freedom,
In everlasting joys to dwell.
8.
And, for that Angels were to weak,
(To conquer these great enemies,)
The Son of God did undertake,
This high most worthy enterprise.
9.
Whereto, his Father gave consent,
He should descend from Heaven so high,
On earth for to be resident,
Till he had got the victory.
10.
And to that end, it was his will,
Of blessed Virgin to be borne,
The holy Scripture to fulfill,
And us to help that were forlorn.
11.
By his two natures united,
Col. 2.
(Both God and Man, one person pure)
He might be always furnished,
Our former freedom to procure.
12.
In Man's Nature (as capable,
To undergo all kind of pain)
In Gods Nature, (as always able)
To help himself and us again.
13.
First, with our nature to begin,
(Where that was stained in Gods sight,) Christ's pure conception.

Christ took our Nature (without sin)
Conceived, (through Holy Ghost his might)
14.
And of the Virgin Mary borne, Lu. 1. and 2 A savior.

(As Th'angel did fore-prophesie)
Else had all mankind been forlorn,
Without all hope of remedy.
15.
And that all people then might know,
He was of power to save us all, Mat. 1.21. Luke 1, 30 36.

His very name, the same did show,
As Th'angell (Jesus) did him call.
16.
Likewise, (because he undertook, Heb.9.14. 1 John 2.22.

To be our Prophet, King, and Priest,)
It is recorded in Gods Book,
That he was also called Christ.
17.
Which is, ( Anointed of the Lord,) Anointed. Psalm.45.7 Hebr. 1.9.

To execute those offices,
That (by his saving work and word)
He might our freedom accomplish.
18.
Thus, Jesus Christ, (He being borne)
And growing up to Man's degree,
Does think on us, that were forlorn,
In former state to set us free.
19.
For, Well he knew, our sinful fall,
Did spoil us all of blessedness,
Ephesians. 2. Col. 3.
And brought us likewise to be thrall,
To everlasting cursednesse.
20.
Because we neither could fulfill,
The law of God, that leads to bliss,
Nor bear his wrathful vengeance still,
Till we had quited his justice.
21.
Without both which, Christ knew right well,
That we were left remediless,
From ever scaping out of Hell,
Or getting former happiness.
22.
Both which Christ did, in our Nature,
Well undertake for to supply,
And so from time to time made sure,
His Fathers wrath to pacify.
23.
For, whereas without righteousness,
We could not come to blessed rest,
Christ lived in upright holiness,
(As in the Scripture is expressed.)
24.
Not only in avoiding,
But ever doing good withal,
His Fathers will for to fulfill,
For us (through sin) still kept in thrall.
25.
That so our nature full of sin,
Before Gods throne of grace in Christ,
Might be presented pure in him,
In whom our comfort does consist*
What Christ suffered in his body, for the sins of our bodies.
1
IMmanuell Jesus Christ our Lord,
Having fulfild his Fathers Law,
Did likewise willingly accord,
The penalty to undergo.
2.
That where we all deserved shame,
In body and Soul eternally,
He would needs suffer for the same,
In both respects to set us free,
3.
His blessed body did begin,
To suffer grief in every part,
Sore whipped and scourged for our sin.
Which needs must vex his inward heart.
4.
His head was crowned with sharp Thorns,
His eyes and ears, endured pain,
His tongue with taunts the bad did scorn,
Who still accursed do remain.
5.
His Arms, his Legs, his hands, his feet,
Was nay led fast upon the Tree,
As sacrifice for sin most meet,
For our offenses so to be.
6.
His harmless side with pearcing spear,
Was wounded deeply for our sake,
From whence blood ran and water clear,
Our full atonement for to make.
7.
And last of all, his guiltles death,
Upon the cross, and put in grave,
Shall sanctify our mortal breath,
Eternal rest with Christ to have.
8.
O blessed Jesus, King of Kings,
How much is mankind bound to thee,
We must confess in all these things,
And ever praise thy majesty.
That Christ suffered in his Soul, for the sins of our Souls.
IF Saloman the wisest King,
That ever reigned on this earth,
Could not describe the fearful sting,
Of wounded conscience during breath. Pro. 18.14

No mortal wight can then express, The foot

Of Christ his soul the pensiveness.
2.
Some sin we see does press man's heart,
So very sore each day by day,
As causes comfort to depart,
And sorrow vex them every way.
No mortal wight, etc.
3.
If wounded conscience for one sin,
Do bring some men to woeful thrall, As Judas.

What extreme torments was Christ in,
Who bore that burden for us all.
No mortal wight, etc.
4.
We all confess, (in whom is grace)
Our sinful souls, (by Gods just doom)
Deserve with Devils to have a place,
In everlasting woes to come. Ephe. 3

No mortal wight can then express,
Of Christ his soul the pensiveness.
5.
Since then, our Souls do far exceed,
The bodies constitution,
There sin, the greater pain must breed,
In horrible confusion.
No mortal wight, etc.
6.
Gods Justice then must needs impose,
Most extreme pain, on Christ his Son,
Since, he would answer for all those,
That rest on his compassion.
No mortal wight, etc.
7.
How great those torments in Christ's soul,
Were felt of him, does well appear,
Mat. 26 and 27.
In that his spirit they did control,
To utter words, (as seemed of fear.)
No mortal wight, etc.
8.
What was the cause that made Christ say,
(My soul is heavy unto Death,)
Luke. 22. verse 44.
And for to sweat (as he did pray)
That drops like blood fell down to the earth*
No mortal wight, etc.
9.
Yea, when his Father would not hear,
What made him then so loud to cry,
Mat. 27
(My God, my God, O Father dear)
Why have thou thus forsaken me.
No mortal wight, etc.
10.
It was not pain of body then,
That made Christ Jesus thus complain,
But wrath of God, for sins of men,
Which he in soul did then sustain.
No mortal wight, etc.
12
Oh? Who will take delight to sin,
In soul or body night or day,
Since our sins pad, on Christ did bring,
So extreme torments every way:
No mortal wight, that can express,
Of Christ his soul the pensiveness.
Upon the sufferings of our Savior Jesus, two questions discussed.
1
THe former, Since we all confess,
Our selves still sinners for to be,
And that (as Scripture does express)
We ought to die eternally.
2.
How comes it then to pass? declare, The first question:

That Christ (for us) got victory,
And death with Devils, all conquered are,
So, as we escape their Tyrany.
3.
The answer hereunto is plain,
(If we eonsider Death and Devil,
On whom, their power did remain:
Those that delight in sin and evil.
4.
For only such, God gave them leave,
To cut off, when their sins were ripe,
And them (as Iaylors to receive,)
Of joy and comfort, quite to stripe.
5.
And in the room thereof, for aye,
(As their most just deserved hyre,)
To vex their souls both night and day,
In everlasting hellish fire.
6.
Now, whereas further they made bold,
To lay hands on the Innocent,
So were they both to be contrould,
(By Gods Justice omnipotent.)
7.
But, (by your leave) will some reply,
Did not Christ come, to save us all,
Reply.
And so to suffer willingly,
To ransom us, from endless thrall.
8.
It is most true (we all confess)
In which respect, it may be said,
Repulsed.
If Death, and Satan's craftiness,
Their heads together then had laid.
9.
To punish Christ (as one that would,
Needs undertake for others sins,)
They could not then, have been contrould,
For holding him, within their grins.
10.
But, since they durst put him to death,
(As guilty in his own person) As a Blasphemer. Naturally

For telling truth (as Scripture says)
He was of God (the only Son)
11.
Herein (presuming without cause,
(To punish Christ most Innocent,)
He rid himself out of their claws,
(Through power Divine) incontinent.
12.
And rose again out of the grave,
(As just tryumphing Conqueror)
Our souls and bodies for to save,
From Satan's power for evermore.
13.
For right and Justice did agree,
(According to Gods holy law)
A tooth, for tooth, an eye, for eye, Exodus 21.24.

From guilty persons for to draw.
14.
Then must it stand with Gods just doom,
(Since Death and Satan did conspyre)
To do Injustice to his son,
Of Heaven and Earth the only heir.)
15.
That they should forfeit all their right,
(Which they on Sinners had before)
To Jesus Christ, the Lord of might,
(Even whom he please, for to restore.)
16.
By Justice therefore, now we see,
Reu. 3, 7 Mat. 28.
Christ is both Lord, of life and death,
To save or spill eternally,
As holy Writ concluded has.
17.
Col. 2. Hebr. 2.
Thus see we Satan, Death and Hell,
(All Captive now, to Christ our Lord:
And that all his, with him shall dwell,
To praise his name, with one accord.
18.
The second question, stands thus,
2 Question.
(Since we deserve eternal woe)
How comes it then, that Christ Jesus,
The same should fully undergo?
19.
And suffer but so small a space,
His Fathers wrath to pacify,
And us again restore to grace,
Gods justice satisfied thereby.
20.
The answer stands on two parts,
(And both of them performd in Christ)
To cheer and comfort all our hearts,
And please our God in heaven the highest.
21.
The former is, (if we respect,)
Col. 2
Christ's Godhead, joined with our nature,
Then will it presently detect,
That plain, (which seem before obscure.)
22.
For Christ ( By his Divinity,)
Could suffer more within one hour,
(Assisting his humanity)
Then we should suffer evermore.
23.
The latter makes it more plain, Hos. 13, 14. 1 Cor. 15 Hebr. 2.

When Christ (by death) had vanquished death,
What force in him could then remain,
To hold us subject to his wrath.
24.
Methinkes I hear yet, some reply,
If Death have lost his force indeed,
How comes it then, that all men dye, A Reply Repulsed.

(According to our common Creed.)
25.
I do reioynd, and still auow,
Death has no power to hurt at all,
(But where our Christ does him allow,)
All such, as to his wrath are thrall.
26.
As for Christ's chosen Servants dear,
Death is their friend (against his will,)
By ridding them of sorrows here,
To live in joy and pleasure still.
27.
Thus do we more and more behold,
The love of Christ our Savior,
To Adams heirs, on earthly mould,
That we might praise him evermore.
1.
One doubt remains yet bebynd,
The last doubt.
Dissolved for to be,
Which dearest Saints of God, most find,
To vex their souls daily.
2.
That is, The sight of present sins,
Whereby Gods wrath they move,
To hold them still in Satan's grins,
(As banished from his love.)
3.
Which makes them weep both day and night,
For grieuing him so sore,
To shut them quite out of his sight,
To see his face no more.
4.
O ye the blessed of the Lord,
Mat. 5,
That thus do sigh and groan,
Give ear unto his holy word,
And cease to make your moan.
5.
On whom does God cast down his eye,
Esa. 66, 2 Psa, 51.17
But on the wounded heart,
That for his mercies call and cry,
To ease them of their smart.
6.
Or whom does Christ unto him call,
(But such as he oppressed,)
Ma, 11, 28
That he (in time) might ease them all,
And bring them to his rest.
7.
What he has said you must believe,
(You can it not deny,)
Oh then, do not his spirit grieve,
But to his mercy fly.
8.
You know Gods mercy (through his love,)
Sent down his Son Jesus, John. 3

You know Christ's mercy did him move,
To become man for us.
9.
That in our nature he might pay
The debt that we did owe, John 10.

And so his Fathers justice stay,
His mercy for to show.
10.
To this end, when accursed we were,
(By reason of our sin)
Christ Jesus then our curse did bear, Deuteronomy. 21.23. Gal. 3.13

(When he on Tree did hang.)
11.
And that he might for evermore,
From Vengeance set us free,
The wrath of God (on Cross) he bore, Col. 2

That we might saved be.
12.
And to that end, when he did rise,
From death to life again,
And did assend in glorious wise, Act. 1

With troops of Angels train.
13.
Ephesians. 4, 8 Hebr. 3
Then led he captive all our foes,
The Devil, with all the rest,
And reconcild to God all those,
That are, or shall be blessed.
14.
Who sits now on Gods right hand,
1 Timothy 2, 5
Our advocate to be,
And does our causes understand,
From foes to set us free.
15.
If sin therefore, thy soul oppress,
Then sue to him for grace,
Mat. 11.28.
And he will soon procure release,
To ease thee in that case.
16.
For why, (in him) the Father is
Mat. 17 John 17
Well pleased for evermore,
To give all those eternal bliss,
That do his name adore.
A glimpse of that glory, which the redeemed shall have with Christ in his
kingdom.
1
THough eye may see, and tongue can tell
The state of greatest Princes here,
And such as in their courts do dwell,
Or chiefest rule and office bear.
2 Cor. 2, 9 The foot
No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
No tongue of mortal man can tell,
The high estate in heaven prepared,
Wherein the Saints of God shall dwell.
2.
No Princes Court, so stately hear,
But mortal men the same did frame, 2 Cor. 5, 1 He. 11, 10

But, Heavenly palace is so fair,
As God (not man) did build the same.
No eye has seen, etc.
3.
In Princes Court, no subject may,
Wear any Crown (save Prince alone)
In heaven, the Saints of God always, 2 Timothy 4, 8

Wear Crowns of glory every one.
No eye has seen, etc.
4.
In Princes Court, with Prince to sit,
But few, so highly honored be,
In Heaven all Saints Christ does admit, Ephesians. 3, 6, 2 Timothy 3.

To sit and reign with him daily.
No eye has seen, etc.
5.
In Princes Courts, some loosely live,
And grieve the Godly day by day,
In Heaven: None there offenses give, Reu. 21

Nor once can sin no kind of way.
No eye has seen, etc.
6.
In Princes Courts, some men do want
(Though others have enough and more,
In Heaven, none there feel any scant, Reu. 21 and 22.

Nor any person can be poor.
No eye has seen, etc.
7.
In Princes Courts, some live in pain,
By sores and grieves of sundry kinds,
Reu. 21
In Heaven all men in health remain,
For nothing there can vex their minds.
No eye has seen, etc.
8.
In Princes Courts, some do lament,
Reu, 7, 17
(By sundry kinds of casualities,)
In Heaven, their time in mirth is spent,
(For tears are wyped from their eyes.)
No eye has seen, etc.
9.
In Princes Courts, some sing Gods praise,
(But soon are weary of the same,)
Re, 4, and 5
In Heaven they laud the Lord always,
And still rejoice to praise his name.
No eye has seen, etc.
10.
In Princes Courts, whom Prince does love,
May (by occasion) loath as sore,
Ren. 7
In Heaven; All there, in Christ above,
Do live and love for evermore.
No eye has seen, etc.
11.
In Princes Courts, though men should have,
What heart could think, it would decay,
Reu. 21. and 23. Psalm. 16
In Heaven such joys all there receive
As by no change, can wear away.
No eye has seen, etc.
12
Thus may we see, by that is said,
How much we all are bound to Christ,
When Princes Courts are but a shade,
Compard with his, in Heaven the highest.
No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
Nor tongue of mortal man can tell,
The high estate in Heaven prepared,
Wherein the Saints of God shall dwell.
All professors shall not be inheritors of Christ's kingdom (but true
believers only.)
1
THough Christ his merits be of power,
To save mankind from Hell,
And Adams heirs for to restore,
With him in joys to dwell.
2.
But few yet (in comparison,)
Reap benefit thereby,
The want thereof (not in Gods Son)
But in themselves does lie.
3.
For (if all persons could believe,)
Then all should saved be,
For Christ to such his grace does give, John 3.

From Hell to set them free.
4.
Strive then to show the true effect,
Lu. 13, 24 Iam. 2
And fruits of lively faith,
Else Christ (as dead) will thee reject.
(As holy Scripture says.)
5.
For why? The gate is very strait,
That leads unto bliss,
Mat. 7, 13 14.
And few do enter in thereat,
So hard to find it is.
6.
Do thou believe within thine heart,
Christ dyed for thy sin?
Then from the same thou must depart,
2 Timothy, 2, 19.
And come no more therein.
7.
Do thou believe Christ rose again,
Col. 3 Romans 6.
Thy freedom to restore?
Then must thou holiness retain,
To please him evermore.
8.
The joys of Heaven they do belong,
(To only such indeed,)
Who do refrain from doing wrong,
And follow right with speed.
9.
But if thou do delight in sin,
And after it still range,
So that thou will not once begin,
Thy wicked ways to change.
10.
It is most true, (as thou shall find) Iam. 2.

Thy faith is dead and vain,
And fearful woes shall vex thy mind,
In everlasting pain.
11.
Oh then, whilst God does grant thee space,
Cry hard both day and night,
That he will give to thee his grace,
To lead thy life upright.
12.
Then shall thy works, thy faith approve,
To be alive and sound, Iam. 2. Reu. 2, 10

Then art thou dear to God above,
And shall (in Christ) be crowned.
A fervent supplication,
Tending to mortification,
And new regeneration,
That leads to salvation.

1
MOst loving Lord, and Father dear,
I humbly sue unto thy grace, The sinners complaint.

That thou (in Christ) my suite wilt hear,
Which now I make before thy face.
2.
And first whereas my sinful soul,
Has much offended many ways, Of his foul.

O Lord do thou her lusts control,
To live according to thy laws.
3.
Of his heart
My heart, the harbor of all sin,
That in my body does remain,
Reform a new, for to begin,
From wickedness for to refrain.
4.
Of his thoughts.
My thoughts that were Impure before,
To range from sin to sin each day,
O sanctify them more and more,
To please thy goodness every way.
5.
Of his wit and will.
My wit and will, withal the rest,
Of inward gifts of soul and mind,
That have to sin been ready pressed,
Let now to goodness be enclinde.
6.
Of his affections.
My hearts affections fully fraught,
With sundry sinful passions,
From hence forth, let them all be taught,
To leave such detestations.
7.
Of his senses.
My senses seeming in their kind,
With fading pleasures to abound,
Heareafter (Lord) their lusts fast bind,
In moderation to be found.
8.
Of his bodily members.
The members of my body frail,
Which have been bent to all kind evil,
Let them (O Lord) no more prevail,
To diplease thee, and please the Devil.
9.
My wandering eyes in worldly lust, Of his eyes

Which took their pleasure night and day,
Translate their sight to objects just
Thereby to please thee all they may.
10.
Mine ears, that chiefly took delight, Of his ears.

In foolish, vain, and fruitles sounds,
Make them heareafter to despyght,
All such unsure, deceitful grounds.
11.
My tongue, that I could seldom baulke, Of his tongue.

From discoursing of vanities,
Restrain henceforth: And now to taulke,
Of thy just laws and mysteries
12.
My hands so nimble, ready bent, Of his hands.

To wanton sports and idle play,
Heareafter let their time be spent,
In doing good each kind of way.
13.
My Arms and Legs that have been strong, Of his arms and Legs.

To prosecute my wicked will,
Keep henceforth (Lord) from offering wrong,
And thy mind always to fulfill.
14.
My feet, that have been often pressed, Of his feet

To follow sin and vain excess,
Make them heareafter with the rest,
To haunt the ways of Godliness.
15.
And to conclude (Lord) mortify,
Of soul and body.
All sin in Soul and body to,
That henceforth they may both agree,
Thy will in all things for to do.
16.
Of both their delights.
O let them make their chiefest joy,
To hear and read thy holy word,
Which shall keep them from all annoy,
When faith and life thereto accord.
17.
The conclusion.
Then shall I be thy Servant dear,
When all my powers aright do frame,
Then shall I reign with thee elsewhere,
And ever bless thy holy name.
A recapitulation of all before spoken, with humble thankfulness for God
exceeding goodness, to his redeemed.
1.
O Blessed God omnipotent,
How much is mankind bound to thee,
For all thy works so excellent,
The soote
As thou have set them in degree.
Let Heaven, let Earth, and all therein,
Sound out thy worthy praise,
Let Saints and Angels first begin,
To laud thy name always.
2.
Thou (blessed Lord) the Heavens did frame,
Most glorious in our mortal oyes,
The Sun, the Moon, the Stars by name,
That shine so bright in azure skies.
Let Heaven, etc.
4.
Thou (blessed Lord) the earth did make,
And all that therein does abound,
The Sea with Fish, (all for our sake,)
With flying Fowls above the ground.
Let Heaven, etc.
4.
Thou (blessed Lord) above all these,
Did mankind make most excellent,
That they might seek thee still to please,
And with their gifts to be content.
Let Heaven, etc.
5.
Thou (blessed Lord) when man had lost,
His happy state (through sinful fall)
Did send thy Son, (whose might is most,)
That he should reconcile us all.
Let Heaven, etc.
6.
Thou (blessed Lord) when Devils and Death,
Did seek to bring us all to Hell,
Then sentest thou (as Scripture says,)
Thine only Son their force to quell,
Let Heaven, etc.

Thou (blessed Lord) when sin us held,
That we could never come to thee,
Did send thy Son, who has expeld,
His force that we might freed be.
Let heaven, etc.
8.
That we feel the^ faintly.
Thou (blessed Lord) when we lack faith,
Or works the same for to express,
Both these, thy grace supplied has,
That we might come to blessedness.
Let heaven, etc.
9.
For all these favors in thy word,
Whereby thy kindness is expressed,
We magnify thy name (O Lord)
Who ever was and shall be blessed.
Let heaven, let earth, and all therein,
Sound out thy worthy praise,
Let Saints and Angels first begin,
To laud thy name always.
Infallible tokens of predestation unto Salvation.
1
HE that does look to reign with Christ,
In everlasting blessedness,
Must take great care that he persist,
In these degrees of holiness.
2.
The first, He must lament his sin,
Whereby he has offended God,
And seek to come no more therein,
Least he correct him with his rod,
3. The second, He must love Gods house,
To learn his duty willingly,
And thither often take his course,
To worship God unfeignedly.
4.
The third, He must set his delight,
To hear and read Gods holy word,
And often meditate on it,
His goodness daily to record.
5.
The fourth, He must remember well,
What is contrary to Gods will,
To shun that way which leads to Hell,
And pray for grace against all ill.
6.
The fifth, He must the truth profess,
And practice it accordingly,
That words and works may both express,
He holds with the verity.
7.
The sixth, He must do no man wrong,
For no respect in any case,
Nor any that to him belong,
But make amends (if he trespass)
8.
The seventh: He must be ready pressed,
To put up wrongs at others hands,
And pray for them, (as for the rest)
To rid them out of Satan's bands.
9.
The eight, He must be doing good,
Yea rich in good works day by day,
To help the hungry unto food,
And further learning all he may.
10. The ninth: He must dispose himself,
To leave the pleasures of this life,
And greedy seeking worthy pelf,
Which works woe and endless strife.
11.
The tenth: He must with patience,
Prepare himself to bear Christ's Cross,
Or any scourge for his offense,
Which in the end will gain the loss.
12.
The eleventh; He must provide for death,
(As if his bed should be his grave.)
To live in peace, whilst he has breath,
That after Christ his soul may save.
13.
The twelft, He must in all distress,
Of sickness, pain, or punishment,
Then, hope for Christ his blessedness,
Which aye shall last, when life is spent.
14.
The thirteenth, He must often pray.
That Satan's Kingdom may surcease,
And Christ his glory every way,
May daily more and more increase.
15.
The fourteenth, He must ever long,
To be with Christ in his sweet bliss,
To sing that endless joyful song,
All praise to him, whose right it is.
16.
The more that any mortal wight,
With these good graces does abound,
The deerer he is in Gods sight,
And so for ever shall be found.
FINIS.
