By the Queen.
THE Queens Majesty understanding that there be certain persons having in
times past the Office of Ministry to the Church, which now do purpose to use
their former office of preaching and Ministry, and partly have attempted the
same, assembling specially in the City of London in sundry places, great
number of people, whereupon rises among the common sort not only
unfruitful dispute in matters of Religion but also contention and occasion to
break common quiet: Has therefore according to thauthoritie committed to her
highness for the quiet governance of all manner her subjects, thought it
necessary to charge and command, like as hereby her highness does charge and
command, all manner of her Subjects, as well those that be called to Ministry
in the Church as all others, that they do forbear to preach, or teach, or to
give audience to any manner of doctrine or preaching other then the Gospells
and Epistels commonly called the Gospel and Epistel of the day, and to the Ten
Commandments in the vulgar tongue, without exposition or addition of any
manner sense or meaning to be applied or added, or to use any other manner of
Public prayer, Rite, or Ceremony in the Church but that which is already
used and by law received, or the common Letany used at this present in her
Majesty's own Chapel, and the Lords prayer and the Creed in English until
Consultation may be had by Parliament, by her Majesty and her three estates of
this Realm for the better conciliation and accord of such causes as at this
present are moved in matters and Ceremonies of Religion.

THE true advancement whereof to the due honor of almighty God, the increase
of virtue and godliness with universal charity and concord among her
people, her Majesty most desires, and means effectually by all manner of
means possible to procure, and to restore to this her Realm. WHEREUNTO as her
Majesty instantly requires all her good faithful and loving Subjects to be
assenting and ayding with due obedience, So, if any shall disobediently use
themselves to the breach hereof, her Majesty both must and will see the same
duly punished both for the quality of thoffence, and for example to all
others neglecting her Majesty's so reasonable Commandment.

YEVEN at her highness Palais of Westminster, the xxvii. day of December, the
first year of her Majesty's Reign. God save the Queen.
