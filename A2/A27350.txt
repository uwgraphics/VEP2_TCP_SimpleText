LONDON: Printed and are to be sold by E. Cotes living in Aldersgate street,
Printer to the Company of Parish Clerks, 1665.

To the Right Honorable Sir JOHN LAWRENCE Knight. Lord Major of the City of LONDON.
MY LORD,
SInce it has pleased Almighty God, so to order it, that this present
Visitation should happen under your Lordships Government of this great and
populous City of London, I have taken the boldness to Dedicate this Treatise to
your Lordship, as a Person to whose Care and Piety it seems but a fair respect
and duty. It is, my Lord, a short Extract, and just Account of every Weeks
Christnings and Burials in all the Years of PESTILENCE within the cognizance of
the Bills of Mortality; being faithfully drawn from the Registers kept in the
Common Hall of the Company of Parish Clerks: Which I hope will redound first to
your Lordships satisfaction, and also all the Curious that desire to know the
certainty and number of all those that died when Gods hand was upon us, by the
most deplorable PESTILENCE. By which the World will have the means and benefit
of correcting the Errors of diverse Papers which have been lately Published by
many confident and inconsiderate Writers upon that Subject. So having made this
humble tender of my self and my weak Labors to your Honors exceptance, I
shall be no farther troublesome, but with my Prayers for your Lordships
welfare, and the protection of this famous City, I most dutifully subscribe my
self

Your Honors humbly devoted Servant JOHN BELL.

To the READER.
Courteous Reader,
HAving observed with some trouble, the many and gross mistakes which have been
imposed upon the World, by diverse Ignorant Scriblers about the weekly Accounts
of former Visitations; I thought it some part of my duty to rectify those
Errors, out of the undeniable Records of those times; and I have accordingly
drawn from the Register of the Company of Parish Clerks an exact Computation
since the year 1592. to this present year, to satisfy their curiosity that
desire to be better informed, and to prevent the inconvenience of false Papers
for the future. There have been several Pamphlets Printed upon this Argument,
which have been all faulty more or less, and would not be worth the while to
Descant upon; but there is one amongst the rest, which I cannot let pass
without a mark, in regard that it bears the face of a Sober Discourse, and is
Entitled, Reflections on the Bills of Mortality: In this Pamphlet the Reader
will find a greater number set down in some years to die of the Plague, than
the Clerks Register took notice of to die in all. I therefore have put this
small Treatise to view for publick-satisfaction, and prevention of false
Papers; which is the only intention of.

JOHN BELL.

Some Objections against the BILLS of MORTALITY Answered: As also a view of the
Original and continued Bills of Mortality; Showing by what ascents and steps
they came to their present perfection. Together with an Account of 18. Years
PESTILENCE.
SInce I have undertaken to say somewhat of the Bills of Mortality, I think it
necessary to give an answer to those so generally reported Objections against
it:

Obj. 1. That the Bill of Mortality is little worth, by reason the Searchers
are generally old and simple women, and are not able to judge of, and
distinguish between Diseases, and therefore cannot make a true Report to the
Parist Clerk.

Obj. 2. Admit the Searchers were discreet and knowing persons, yet the Parish
Clerks neglect their duty, and do not at all return them; or not according to
the Report of the Searchers.

To these I answer, that the Bill of Mortality is of very great use and
necessity, and therefore not to be slighted, since it so much conduces to the
Health of the City, and Preservation of the Members thereof, in that it gives
a general notice of the Plague, and a particular Account of the places which
are therewith infected, to the end such places may be shunned and avoided.

True and undeniable it is, That the Searchers are generally ancient women, and
I think are therefore most fit for that Office: But sure I am they are chosen
by some of the eminentest men of the Parish to which they stand related; and if
any of their Choosers should speak against their abilities, they would much
disparage their own Judgments. And after such Choice they are examined touching
their sufficiency, and sworn to that Office by the Dean of the Arches, or some
Justices of the Peace, as the cause shall require.

As for the Clerks Returns, I dare affirm they never were more punctual in the
Discharge of this their Duty then at this day. And truly both they and the
Searchers have a great deal of reason to be very careful of what they make
Report; they being both bound by their Oaths for the performance thereof; The
Searchers to view and search the bodies of all persons Deceasing within their
Parish; and to give a true Account to the Clerk of what Diseases the Parties
Die. And the Clerk to return a just account (according to the Report of the
Searchers) to the Common Hall of the Company of Parish Clerks, for the true
making up of the Weekly Bill of Mortality. And I presume there cannot be a
stricter Obligation then a sacred Oath to bind any person.

But to proceed, my purpose is to give you a just and brief Account of all the
Weekly Christnings and Mortality in all the Years of Pestilence since the
beginning of the Bills of Mortality, accounting such for Plague Years, wherein
the number of that Disease amounted to One Thousand or thereabouts: Together
with some Observations on the Bills for the said Years, and their precedent and
subsequent Years.

I shall begin with the year 1593. being the first year in which any Account of
the Chirstnings and Burials was kept. I cannot find any Record of more
antiquity then that of this Year in the Company of Parish Clerks Hall; nor can
I give you a particular Account of the Christnings and Burials therein. But the
General or whole Years Account I find Recorded in these Words, viz.

A Brief Report of all the Christnings and Burials within the City of London
and the Liberties thereof, for one whole Year past; (that is to say) from
Thursday at Noon the xxj of December, Anno 1592. unto the xx day of December
being Thursday at Noon, Anno 1593. has been buried in all 17844 Whereof has
died of the Plague 10662 Christened this whole Year, is 4021 Parishes Clear of
the Plague 00
I shall now proceed to treat of the subsequent Year 1594. In which Year I find
not only the General or whole Years Account, but also the Particular or Weekly
Account, both of Christnings and Burials to be on Record. I shall not give you
an Account of the Particulars in this Year; It (according to my Account) not
coming within the compass of a Plague Year.

But I shall note unto you, That the Bill of Mortality now in its Infancy,
consisted but of 109 Parishes; which Parishes then were only Alphabetically set
down, without making any distinction of the Out-Parishes from those within the
Walls: whereas now it comprehends 130. and distinguishes the Parishes by the
four Divisions of the 97. 16. 12. and 5. Parishes, as by the present Bills may
appear. I shall next name unto you the Parishes then wanting.

In the now 97 Parishes within the Walls, wanted the Parish of St. James at
Dukes-place. In the now 16 Parishes, being part within the Liberties and part
without, wanted St. Bartholomew the Great, Bridewell Precinct, and Trinity in
the Minories. Which four Parishes, I conceive, being all Precincts, came not
into the Bill. The now 12 and 5 Parishes were then quite exempt. I shall now
show by what ascents and steps the Bills came to what they now are.

In the Year 1604 were added to the 109 Parishes, these here-under named, To
the then 13 Parishes the 3 Parishes said to be wanting of the 16 Parishes, and
these 8. viz.

St. Clement Danes St. Giles in the Fields St. James at Clarkenwell St.
Katherine Tower St. Leonard in Shoreditch St. Mary in Whitechappel St. Martin
in the Fields, and St. Magdalen Bermondsey.
In the Year 1606 was added to these 8, St. Mary at the Savoy: and in the Year
1647 to them likewise was added St. Paul in Covent Garden, making their number
the 10 Out-parishes. In the Year 1626, the Parish or Precinct of St. James at
Dukes-place was added to the then 96 now 97 Parishes within the Walls: All
which Parishes ever since their several additions, and the other ever since the
Year 1604, brought to the Company of Parish Clerks Hall, not only the number of
all the Christnings and Burials, but also an account of all the Diseases and
Casualties, although no such account was published to the World until the Year
1629. In this Year also was added the City of Westminster, which brought in
only the number of the Christnings, Burials, and Plague, without taking notice
of, or specifying any other the Diseases or Casualties. And in the Year 1636,
the Parishes of Hackney, Islington, Lam-beth, Newington, Rothorith, and
Stepney, likewise brought in their Reports of the Christnings, Burials, and
Plague, in like manner and form as the City of Westminster before is said to do.

In the Year 1660 the Bills were new modelled, and the account of all the
Diseases and Casualties in the whole 130 Parishes, was brought in, and the 12
Parishes lying in Middlesex and Surrey, were made a Division in the fore-side
Bill by themselves, and the 5 Parishes within the City and Liberties of
Westminster were made a Division by themselves; whereas before they were
intermixed with each other.

In the Year 1665 the Totalls of the Christnings were distinctly set down in
the foreside Bill under each of the 4 Divisions of the 97. 16. 12, and 5.
Parishes respectively.

Thus have I given you a Brief account of the Additions of the several Parishes
to the Weekly Bills: It now remains that I should show you the several shapes
or forms in which the Bills of Mortality have since their Original been
presented to the World. And likewise for what reason the account of Burials
were kept. I think I need not trouble my self herein, since that worthy and
ingenious Gentleman, Captain John Grant, in his Book of Natural and Political
Observations on the Bills of Mortality, has already so well described them:
Wherein also he shows that the Bills of Mortality had their beginning in the
Year 1592. it being a very Pestilential Year: and that the occasion of keeping
the account of Burials arose first from the Plague in that Year.

I shall now return to speak of the Year 1603. And shall first observe unto
you, that most of the Pamphlets and Papers yet extant concerning the Bills of
Mortality, make mention of this Year for a very great Plague Year. But their
Writers are either very ignorant, and set down their accounts at random, or
else have lost a year; for they all make their Papers bear date March 17. 1603.
and conclude that from thence to December following, which must necessarily be
in the Year 1604. there died of all Diseases 37294. whereof of the Plague
30561. I shall now make the falsities of their Papers appear, by giving you the
General, or whole Years account for that Year, as I find it Recorded in the
form following; which will somewhat antidate their Papers, and yet not amount
to the 33 part of the number they account the Plague to be therien Anno 1603.
Anno 1604.


The whole Years Collection of all the Burials and Christnings, as well within
the City of London and the Liberties thereof, as in the eight Out-Parishes
adjoining to the City, and out of the Freedom: together with all at the
Pesthouse belonging to London, from Thursday the 21 of December, Anno Dom.
1603. to Thursday the 20 of December 1604. according to the Report made to the
Kings most excellent Majesty, by the Company of Parish Clerks as follows:
Buried this Year in the fourscore and 16 Parishes of London within the Walls
1798 Whereof of the Plague 280
Buried this Year in the 16 Parishes of London within the Liberties and without
the Walls 2465 Whereof of the Plague 368
The whole sum of all the Burials in London and the Liberties thereof this
year is 4263 Whereof of the Plague 648
Buried this Year in the eight Out-Parishes, and the Pesthouse adjoining to
London, and cut of the Freedom 956 Whereof of the Plague 248
The Total of all the Burials in all the places aforesaid is 5219 Whereof of
the Plague 896
Christened in all the aforesaid Places this Year 5458 Parishes that have been
clear this Year 24 Parishes that have been infected this Year 96


I had likewise given you the particulars for this Year, but that according to
my account it comes not within the compass of a Plague Year.

I deny not, but that there might be, and I believe was, a very grievous
Pestilence which raged here in some part of the Year 1603. and that which
confirms me most in this belief, is a Sermon preached by Bishop Andrews before
King James at Cheswick the 20 day of August 1603. being said to be preached in
the time of Pestilence: But I deny, and have already made it appear, that it
continued not till March 1603. much less began then.

Having now given you an account of the Errors of others Papers, by putting
them in Competition with the Company of Parish Clerks Register, you may ask me,
Why then I do not give you a better account of that Pestilential Year?

I answer, That in that Year the Parish-Clerks gave not in any account thereof;
and although I think it not impossible, yet it is very improbable, that any
particular man should give a just account thereof.

For the Bills of Mortality took their Original 21 December. 1592. being part of
the year in which raged the Great Plague, and continued until 18 December. 1595.
In which Year (the Plague ceasing) they were discontinued and laid aside as
useless until the 21. day of December, Anno 1603. at which time they were again
resumed and continued unto this Day.

Captain Grant observes likewise, that the Bills were not resumed till after
the Great Plague 1603.

I now proceed to give you a particular account of 18 Years of Pestilence, and
shall first begin with the Year 1605 part, and 1606. being the first Year which
I find the Particular or Weekly account of the Plague to amount to above 1000
in our Books, as in the Table following.

The 18 Years of Pestilence, of which I give you a Weekly account, are these
hereunder written; Anno Anno 1605 part, and 1606 1639 part, and 1640 1606 1607
1640 1641 1607 1608 1641 1642 1608 1609 1642 1643 1609 1610 1643 1644 1624 1625

Instructions for the better understanding of the following TABLES.
THe 1 Column intimates to you the number of the Weeks, as the 1, 2, or 3. Week
of the Year, beginning always in December.

The 2. the several Days of the Month in which each Week expired.

The 3. the Totalls of the Christnings in each of the said Weeks.

The 4. the Totalls of the Burials.

The 5. the Totalls of the Plague.

And the 6. the Number of the Parishes infected.

I might also have added another Column to show the Weekly Increase or Decrease
of the Burials, but that is easily known by the number in the precedent Week,
therefore I think it needless.

I shall here also Note unto you, that what Observations I shall make in this
small Treatise shall follow the Tables for the 18 Years.

OBSERVATIONS On the BILLS of MORTALITY For the 18 Years: And on some of their
Precedent and Subsequent Years.
HAving now finished the Tables for the 18 Years, and given you a just and
faithful account of all the Christnings and Burials in every particular Week, I
shall make some few short Observations on the Weekly and General Bills therein,
and on such other years, on which they have dependency; I mean some of their
precedent and subsequent Years.

Observe. 1.
That the Weekly and General Bills in the year 1593. did bear date from
Thursday to Thursday, as by the General Bill for that year (which I have herein
before inserted, may appear,) and that they continued that course until the
year 1629. In which year, and ever since, they bare date from Tuesday to
Tuesday: But both then and now, the Weekly Collections or accounts of
Christnings and Burials, began the Bill in December, and the whole years
account, or General Bill, concluded the year in the same Month following;
whereas all the Papers that make mention of the Great Plagues in the years
1592. 1593. 1603. and 1625. bear date the 17 of March in all the said years,
and account from thence; still making that day Epidemical, as well as the Year
Pestilential. But I think it very strange, nor do I believe that the 17 of
March in all the said years did fall out to be on a Thursday: but I conceive,
that what is contained in them, was gleaned from some false scattered Papers,
printed in some of those years, and I presume it will not be strange to such
who shall live to see another year of Pestilence, to see the same poison
extracted from the many false Papers printed in this year.

Observe. 2.
That in all the years of Pestilence I ever read of, there died of that
Distemper both Males and Females, except in the Plague in the time of King
David, and in that of Senacheribs Camp; in both which there died none but Men,
as I shall show you hereafter.

Observe. 3.
That in all the years of Contagion or Plague, the numbers of other Diseases
increased much, notwithstanding many of them turned to the Plague.

For although the Plague be a great Receptacle for other Diseases, yet the
contagion of the Air introduces many more than the Plague receives. And
Captain Grant observes, That a disposition in the Air toward the Plague, does
also dispose Women to Abortions.

Observe. 4.
That in the year 1625. there died in all 54265. whereof of the Plague 35417.
of which number of the Plague 20455. died in the Month of August. I am of
opinion that this year was not only the greatest year of Pestilence, but also
the most sickly year that ever the Bill of Mortality took notice of. And I
think I need give you no other reason therefore, than what I have already given
in my 3. Observation. This great Mortality and Pestilence continued only this
year, whereas it is seldom known, but that other, either precedent or
subsequent, accompany years of Pestilence with the like Contagion; which to
this happened nothing so: For in 1624. its precedent, there died but 11. which
number of the Plague for one whole year is no more than there have usually died
of that Distemper in healthful years. Nor was the subsequent year 1626. so
Pestilential as to be termed a Plague year, there dying but 134 of the Plague
therein.

Observe. 5.
That the greatest number of the Plague in the year 1636. happened to be in
September; and so likewise in most of the 18 years: in the precedent year to
this, there died none of the Plague, although both it, and the subsequent year
were Plague years.

Observe. 6.
In the year 1664 part, and 1665. the Plague began with the first Weeks Bill
for the year, in December, at St. Giles in the fields, when as but one had died
of the Plague in 24 weeks before, and but 6 in the whole year: it increased nor
until the 9 day of May. From which time it continued and increased, so that in
16 weeks it run up from 9 to 6102 in one week: which number of the Plague much
exceeded the total number of any one week in any year of Pestilence whatsoever,
which I ever read to have happened within this City.

I come next to show you the Cause of the coming of the Plague, which I shall
briefly do in the words of our famous English Orator, Bishop Andrews.

The Plague (says he) is caused by Gods wrath against Sin, There is wrath gone
out from the Lord, and the Plague is begun (says Moses) Numb. 16.46. So it is
said, God was displeased with David, and he smote Israel with the Plague. So
that if there be a Plague, God is angry; and if there be a great Plague, God is
very angry, etc. Ask the Physician the cause of it, and he will tell you the
cause is in the air; the air is infected, the humors corrupted, the Contagion
of the sick, coming to and conversing with the sound, and they be all true
causes.

But as we acknowledge these to be true, That in all Diseases, and even in this
also there is a natural cause, so we say there is somewhat more, somewhat
Divine and above Nature; as somewhat for the Physician, so some work for the
Priest, and more too (it may be) for whosoever does not acknowledge the finger
of God in this sickness, over and above all causes Natural, looks not deeply
enough into the cause thereof.

That the Plague is a thing causal and not casual, may appear by the Latin
word Plaga, which properly signifies a stroke; which necessarily infers a
cause; for where there is a stroke, there must be one that strikes. Thus much
of Bishop Andrews.

Now if there be a cause we shall do well to consider what that cause may be.
In the Plague in Aarons time, the peoples Rebellion was the cause. In that in
Phineas his time, Fornication was the cause. In that in King David's time, Pride
was the cause; his heart was lifted up to number the people. And in that in
Senacheribs Camp, his Blasphemy by the mouth of his servant Rabshakeh was the
cause. Thus we see four Plagues and their Causes; Now I shall say somewhat of
their causers. The two first of these were caused by the people, the other two
by Kings. In the two first I observe that the Scripture makes mention only of
the number of the people, without particularising what they were that died,
whether Men, Women, or Children, or all of them. In the two latter it makes
mention of Men only; first in King David's time of Threescore and Ten Thousand
men; and in Senacheribs Camp of One Hundred Fourscore and Five Thousand men:
and I believe that in the two last none but men died, for King David's sin was
numbering the men, the women were not numbered. And in Senacheribs Camp, the
Scripture says plainly, that those that died were mighty men of valor,
Leaders and Captains in the Camp of the King of Assyria, 2 Chronicles. 32.21. And I
believe that few or no women followed the Camp so far. And although frequently
in Scripture where men are spoken of, women are included, yet I presume that in
both these they were wholly exempt.

From hence I observe, that all the Plagues wherewith it has pleased God to
visit this Nation, were drawn down upon it by the sins of the people, and not
by any particular act or crime of any the Kings thereof; for I cannot find, nor
do I believe, that any one has read of a Plague within this Nation which
spared either Sex or Age.

Now to look home to our selves: Let us consider for which of these four
causes, or whether for all of them, God is pleased to afflict us with the
present raging Pestilence.

Although I am confident this Nation is sufficiently guilty of all of them, yet
I am of opinion that more particularly this Judgment is laid on us for the
first of them, the sin of Rebellion; which extended much farther than that of
the Israelites against Moses and Anton; for they only murmured, they touched
not the life of either of them, and yet God plagued them for it. Our Rebellion
extended to the height of Rebellion, even to the taking away the life of the
best of Kings, his late Majesty of ever blessed Memory, whose blood doubtless
does uncessantly cry to the Lord for Vengeance.

For if the Lord punished the sin of Saul a King so severely, for shedding the
blood of the Gibeonites, who were his Vassals and Slaves, Hewers of Wood, and
Drawers of Water, that neither the lives of himself and his three sons, who
fell all in one Battle, in one day; nor the three years of Famine in the Land,
could appease Gods wrath therefore, but that the blood of seven more of Saul's
sons must do it.

May not then this Nation justly expect Gods greatest judgments to fall on the
people of it, for shedding the blood of their lawful Sovereign? For their sin
herein was as much greater than Saul's, by how much a lawful and good King (over
three so fair, large, and populous Kingdoms) is greater than a Vassal or Slave.

And because Murder of all sins is the most heinous in the sight of the
Almighty, but especially the Murdering of Kings and Nobles, therefore God
punishes it with one of his severest punishments, I mean with the Plague: for
God himself accounted three days Pestilence equal to three Months flying
before the Enemy, or three years of Famine.

Some may Object, and say, That it is a vain and ridiculous thing to imagine
this present Plague to be inflicted upon us for a thing so long past.

I answer in the words of the Psalmist, Psalm. 9.12. When God makes inquisition
for blood, he remembers them. When God will make inquisition for blood, there
is none can tell; but when he does, then he will not fail to remember them that
shed it.

This When, has not at any time since the death of our late Martyred
Sovereign, come so near as now; and therefore I cannot choose but take
particular notice of it. For God does not always make inquisition for blood so
soon as it is spilt, but many times a great while after: as may appear by the
Gibeonites, for Saul slew them in his life time, in favor of the men of Israel
and Judah; and yet God sent a Famine of three years in the time of King David,
after Saul's death; for that a full satisfaction for their blood was not then
made by the blood of Saul's Family. And when David asked them, what he should do
for them to make an atonement to the Lord: they (though slaves) asked neither
silver, nor gold, nor Liberty, but seven of Saul's sons, whom they hanged to
cease the Famine.

Thus much then for supernatural causes: I shall now proceed to give you some
Causes natural.

The first and great Cause natural, is the infection of the Air, and the Rule
and Reigning of the Plannets over men's bodies: from which proceeds the
Contagion of Converse. And I conceive that the contagion of the Air does arise
from the unseasonableness of the weather; for the weather has been very
seldom, since the beginning of the Plague, suitable to the season of the year,
but the Air has been close and obnubulated, insomuch that the Sun has not had
the full power to do its Office; which is, to exhale all Foggs and malign
Vapors, etc. arising from terrene bodies, which corrupt and infect the Air.

The second is the inclination of men's bodies to receive and retain the
suppressions of the Air.

And men's bodies are most inclineable to it when they are disordered by
immoderate eating or drinking, by heats or colds, etc. And it is thought by
some, that things eaten long since may in some measure be introductory to it.
For some Physicians are of opinion, that the unwholsom meat (by reason of the
great Rot among Sheep) eaten by the Poor last Year, may now cause so great a
Malignity, as to prove contagious.

Now the first and great Antidote and Preservative against the Plague, is
hearty Repentance and fervent Prayer. For Prayer upon Repentance is of all
things most powerful with God; the many and mighty effects whereof, the Holy
Scriptures do abundantly declare.

I shall give one instance of the excellency of it briefly, as I had it related
to me by a worthy Gentleman, my very good Friend, as follows.

Many years since, it pleased God to afflict the Kingdom of France with a
Contagious sneezing, that might justly be termed epidemical: for in a short
space it swept away many thousands of people. And the King then Regnant took
all possible care to abate it, by convening all the learned Doctors in his own
Nation, together with the assistance of some from Neighboring Nations: and all
to small purpose, for all Philosophy Physical could by no means abate it. At
length they fell to their Devotions, and in a very short space it pleased God
to cease it; which has procreated a good Ceremony amongst them ever since
used, that when any man sneezes, all the Company put off their Hats and pray,
Dieu vous assiste, which is, God help you, the Lord bless you.

The second, or mean Antidote and Preservative against Infection, is to take
the advice of some learned Physician, whether Galienical or Chemical, and to do
thereafter.

FINIS.
