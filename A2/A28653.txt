TO HIS Most Excellent MAJESTY Charles II. King of England, Scotland, France,
and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
Dread Sovereign,
I Humbly beseech Your Gracious Majesty, that you would be pleased to pardon my
boldness in presuming to present any thing to Your Majesty: But understanding
that Your Clemency is very great; and besides, knowing that the thing that I
here humbly present unto You is that which has not been known to former Ages,
here in our Nation, nor to Foreign Nations is not yet known to this day: That
has Imboldened me to presume humbly to present it to Your Majesty.

And that as Almighty God was pleased that the beginning of it should be in
this Kingdom, so now he is pleased that the Conclusion and chiefest use of it
(which is to find the Longitude) is made known in the time of Your Reign, for
the Honor of Your Majesty and Your Kingdoms: And You have given Command for
the Publishing of it, that it may be, not only for the benefit of Your own
Subjects, but also for the benefit of all the Christian Nations in the World;
for which Your Majesty will be acknowledged by the present Generation, and
recorded to after Generations, to be the Rectifier and Setler of the Geography,
and Hydrography of the whole World. The Lord God Almighty bless and prosper
Your Majesty with a long and prosperous Reign here, and an everlasting Reign in
Glory hereafter. So prays

Your Majesty's most Humble and Loyal Subject Henry Bond, Sen.

HENRY BOND TO THE COURTEOUS READER.
Courteous Reader,
HEre is presented unto thee a Mystery of a Motion, that out of all Question
has been ever since the Creation of the World, which Almighty God has been
pleased to conceal until this time: And now be is pleased that it shall be made
known for his own Glory and the benefit of men in the World; and has been
pleased to make me an Instrument in his hand to declare it to the World: And
Our Gracious Kings Most Excellent Majesty, has commanded the Publishing of it,
that it may be, not only for the benefit of his own Subjects, but for an
Universal benefit to all the Christian Nations in the World. I shall not
enlarge my self in many words to commend its rare and excellent Use for the
easy and speedy finding of the Longitude, as well by night as by day, having
the Latitude of the place, which is sufficiently manifested and demonstrated in
the Treatise it self. By which means the Geography and Hydrography of the whole
World will be rectified and settled; for which they are all beholding to Our
Gracious King's Majesty. So Courteous Reader farewell.

Charles

THere are several malicious, unworthy Ignorant persons, to the number of
Fourteen; who scandalize the Almighty Jehovah, and give him the lie to his
face, and do much dishonor our Gracious Kings Most Excellent MAJESTY, their
Ignorance so much superseding their understanding as to speak against the truth
of this Treatise, thereby bringing a disrepute upon our English Nation, and
unworthily abusing those Six Honorable and Learned Men who were appointed by
the Kings MAJESTY to Examine the truth of the same; some of whom gave the Report
thereof to His MAJESTY a year and a quarter e're this Treatise was made public.

Eighth day of June, in the Eight and Twentieth year of Our Reign, 1676. By His
MAJESTY'S Command. [Vera Copia.] Joseph Williamson.

The LONGITVDE Found.
WHereas of late days there has been pretending for Longitude, I shall not
trouble my self with contradicting any of their ways, but show a way which
Almighty God has made known to me, and has been proved by Observation in
remote parts of the World.

There has been some in former days, that have thought they could find the
Latitude of any place by the Inclination of the Inclinatory Magnetical Needle
under the Horizon; wherein they were much deceived, because the Magnetical
Needle respects its own Poles (I mean, the Inclinatory Needle) and not the
Poles of the World, except it be in one Meridian in two opposite points.

Yet I honor their Names and Memories, viz. Dr. Gilbert, Physician in ordinary
to Queen Elizabeth, and Mr. Barlow of Winchester, because they made known to
the World their Opinions of that which they knew in their time.

And although the Inclinatory Needle cannot show the Latitude (because there is
one and the same Inclination in a hundred several Latitudes) yet it shows
something else, which is a means to find the Longitude, which I shall show and
prove in my further Discourse.

In the mean time, I am sorry that any one should be so impudent in our days,
to put it out in Print, the Latitude may be found by the Inclination of the
Inclinatory Needle; and Mr. Edward Wright's Table of Inclinations, in his Book
of the Correction of Errors in Navigation, if that had been for that use, it
had been made use of many years before he was born that has put it out in
Print.

Mr. Edward Wright, in the latter end of his Book of the Correction of Errors
in Navigation, sets down several Reasons, as he thought, against Magnetical
Poles; but I shall make it manifest from Eighty five years Observations, that
there are two Magnetical Poles; the one North, and the other South.

I wrote in the Sea-mans Calendar, above Thirty years since, that there were;
and that I knew their Latitude, their Longitude, and their Annual Motion, which
Motion of theirs is the cause of the Variating of the Variation of the
Magnetical Needle or Compass, and the cause of the Alteration of the
Inclinatory Needle. I did in that Calendar foretell Twenty Years before it came
to pass, that in the Year 1657, there would be no variation at all at London;
which was found to be so; and since it has been Westerly, and will be Three
hundred Years after 1657.

Mr. William Burrowes, in his Tract of the Variation of the Compass, had some
thoughts of Magnetical Poles, and has some Calculations to find their Distance
from the Poles of the World; but his mind was, that they were, or rather the
North Magnetic Pole was farther from the Zenith of London, than the Pole of
the World, and makes the North Magnetic Pole to be 25 d. 44 m. from the Pole
of the World.

Besides, he had some thoughts of a Point respective in the Bowels of the Earth.

But when I had read him, and considered of it, I thought the Magnetic Pole
might be nearer to the Zenith of London, than the Pole of the World; and that
by the Latitudes of London and Vaygats, and their Difference of Longitude 58 d.
00 m. and the Variation at London 11 d. 15 m. East, and the Variation at
Vaygats 7 d. 00 m. West, I might find out the Magnetical Pole at M, as in the
following Scheme.

But here we must take notice that Mr. Burrowes Observations of the Variation
at Vaygats, was not the same year that he observed at Lymehouse in October
1580. but four years before, as it plainly appears to me by the motion of the
Magnetical Poles; for he was one that Sailed much into those Northern Parts.

His Observation of the Variation at Vaygats, was in the year 1576, and then
the Variation at London was 11 d. 34 m. but in the year 1580, when it was 11 d.
15 m. at London, it was 8 d. 38 m. at Vaygats; as it appears in the following
Scheme: For finding the Latitude of the Poles, we have in the Triangle L P V,
the co-latitude of London L P 38 d. 28 m. and P V, the co-latitude of Vaygats,
20 d. 00 m. and the Angle L P V, fere 58 d. 00 m. the Difference of Longitude
between London and Vaygats. To find the Side L V, the Distance between London
and Vaygats, and the Angles P L V, and P V L, from P L V Substract 11 d. 15 m.
and there remains the Angle V L M. And substract 8 d. 38 m. from P V L, and
there will remain the Angle L V M. Then in the Triangle L M V, we have the Side
L V, and the Angles L M V, and M V L, to find the Sides L M and V M, the
Distances of the Magnetical Pole from the Zenith of London, and the Zenith of
Vaygats: And lastly, we have in two Triangles, viz. PLM and P V M, two Sides
and one Angle included, to find P M, the Distance of the Magnetical Pole from
the Pole of the Earth, 8 d. 30 m.

The finding of the motion of these Magnetical Poles, was by the decreasing of
the Variation.

Which was first found to decrease by Mr. John Mair. Secondly, By Mr. Edmund
Gunter, Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College in London. Thirdly, By Mr.
Henry Gellibrand, the next Professor of Astronomy after Mr. Gunter. Fourthly,
By my self, in 1640. And lastly, By Mr. Robert Hook, and others, in 1665. The
increase of it Westerly, as it shall hereafter be declared, it cost me much
time in Calculation before I could satisfy my self in it.

Before I come to declare the motion of these Magnetic Poles, I shall make two
Queries.

First, Where these Poles are? Secondly, The Cause of their motion.

For Answer to the first: Out of doubt they are in the Magnetic Sphere, that
environeth or compasses the whole Earth.

For Answer to the Second; Their motion is caused or proceeds, or may be
caused from the motion of the Earth, and may be as great an Argument of the
Earths motion, as any yet known (if not a greater) the Earths motion being from
West to East, and a solid Body; and the Magnetic Sphere Schematic displaying
method of locating magnetic poles Fig. I
that compasses the Earth, being a Substance that has not solidity to keep
pace with the motion of the Earth, but loses in its motion; and that may be
the cause of the motion of the Magnetic Poles from East to West; and their
motion is the cause of the variating of the variation of the Magnetical Needle,
and the cause of the Alteration of the Inclination of the Inclinatory Needle.
FIG. I.


Although we have found out that which Mr. William Burrowes did not think of,
yet we must not forget him for that which he did; because by his Observations,
we come to find out the places of the Magnetic Poles, as it appears in the
Scheme above.

Their Period or Revolution is Six Hundred years; which is Two Hundred and
Thirty years more than Henry Philips does allow them in the Sea-mans Calendar;
Their yearly motion is six Tenths of a Degree, that is, Thirty six Minutes;
which I thus prove: Substract 1580 out of 1657, the remainer is 77 Years; which
multiply by six Tenths, the Product will be 46 2/10; which was the Angle at the
Pole of the World, M P L, in June 1580. From June to October, when Mr. Burrowes
did Observe, was Four Months, which took away the Twelve Minutes.

Mr. John Kepler that was Mathematician to the Emperor of Germany, by his
Chronology of Time, accounts it from the Creation of the World, to the Year of
our Lord, 1657, to be 5650 years; and this motion of the Magnetic Poles
(notwithstanding it be many times swifter than that motion he accounts upon,
yet) gives the same time with his, which makes me much to admire it.

I doubt not but the Learned in Astronomy, will in time collect something more
from it (than I have done) or than has been formerly known.

Their motion is by Sixes, Six Tenths of a Degree in one year, Six Degrees in
Ten years, Sixty Degrees in a Hundred years, and Six times Sixty Degrees in Six
Hundred years.

I have heard that some Divines in former Days have been of opinion, That as
the World and all the Creatures were Created in Six Days, so the World would
continue Six Thousand Years; but I will not meddle with that. These Magnetic
Poles are now in their Tenth Revolution, and as I said before, agree in Time
with Kepler's Motion.

They will be in June 1674. Ten Degrees and Twelve Minutes to the Westwards of
the Meridian of London, and Four Degrees and Forty Eight Minutes to the
Westwards of the Meridian of the Lizard.

The use of the Horizontal Needle is admirable; yet the motion of it is a
forced motion, and not natural; as it appears very plain by Robert Norman a
Compass-maker in Ratcliffe, above Ninety Years past, in his New Attractive, who
was the first that ever we read or heard of, that found out the Inclinatory
motion of the Magnetic Needle, whose Name ought to be remembered for this
thing; and Mr. William Burrowes for the Variation of the Compass.

Almighty God was pleased by these two men so to honor our Nation, that the
Variation and the Inclination of the Magnetic Needle, should be first found in
this Nation, above all the Christian Nations in the World.

And now Almighty God is pleased, above Ninety years after them, to make me an
Instrument in his Hand, to put it to an use not formerly thought of; that is,
to find the Longitude, that as the beginning of it was in this Kingdom, so the
conclusion of it should be here, for the Honor of our Gracious King's Majesty,
and his Kingdoms, unto whom I humbly beseech Almighty God to grant a long, a
prosperous, a happy Reign, and Victory over all His Enemies, Amen.

Robert Norman, in his New Attractive^, mentions one Petro de Medina, that in a
Book of his concerning Navigation, did hold it for an Absurdity for men to say
that the Magnetic Needle had any Variation at all; He said it was an Error in
the misplacing of the Wires: But leaving him and his Error, I shall show how
Mr. Norman came to find the Inclination of the Inclinatory Needle, as he
himself writes, and how he came to think of such a Needle; he had made a large
Horizontal Needle, and bestowed much time and pains in fitting and polishing of
it, and had equally poized it on its Pin, and when he had touched it with the
Loadstone, and put it on its Pin again, the North end of it inclined so low,
that it was not fit for use; he thought to mend it by cutting off some of the
end of it, and cut off so much that he spoiled the Needle; which brought him
into a Passion with himself. After his Passion was over, he considered with
himself, whether there might not be such a motion of the Needle, and then made
one, and found it so; from whence it appears plainly, that the Inclinatory
motion of the Needle is the Natural motion; and that the Horizontal motion,
although it be of admirable use in the world, yet it is a forced motion.

Some years since I saw an Inclinatory Needle of one Doctor Meret's, of the
Physicians College in London, which was made by Robert Norman, in 1578, it
being out of order, I fitted it for him. The use of the Inclinatory Needle I
shall hereafter show to find the Longitude, which is a use that our former
Learned Magnetic Philosophers did not think of in their time, because they
knew not the Variating of the Variation.

We are to take notice, that as there is a Magnetic Sphere that has two
Poles, so there are other Circles belonging to it, as to the other Spheres, an
Equator, two Colures, and Parallel Circles to the Equator. The Equator, for
distinctions sake, I call the Magnequator; the Colure wherein the Poles are,
the Magnestical Colure; the other, the Magnoctial Colure; the Magnequator does
in a manner represent the Moons Difference, because the Magnoctial
Intersections with the Equator of the Earth, have a Retrograde motion, as the
Head and Tail of the Dragon has.

Also the Magnequator does in a manner represent the Ecliptic, having a form
of situation to the Equator of the Earth, that the Ecliptic has to the
Equator of the Heavens; the greatest obliquity being but 8 d. 30. m. as
appears in the first Scheme. As by the Latitude and Declination of a Star in
the Heavens; and knowing on which side of the Solstitial Colure it is, the
Right Ascension may be exactly Calculated.

So in this, if the Latitude of any Place be given with the Inclination of the
Needle, and on which side of the Magnetical Solstitial Colure it is, the
Longitude of the Place may be found from the Magnetical Colure, and from that
the Longitude from any place in the world; as I shall make it appear by
Examples following.

But before I go further, I shall say something of the Decrease of our
Variation here at London, since the time of Mr. William Burrowes's Observations
in October 1580, and shall set down, what the Variations have been found then
and since, by Observations, and by my Calculation according to the motion of
the Magnetical Poles.

d. d. In 1580, M. W. Burrowes, 11-15-00 Bond, 11-15-00 East. In 1622, M. Edm.
Gunter, 05-55-37. Bond, 05-57-00 In 1634, M. H. Gellibrand, 4-03-00. Bond,
4-01-00 In 1640, Bond and others, 3-06-40. Bond. 2-59-00

In 1665, Mr. Robert Hook, the Professor of Geometry in Gresham College in
London, with Mr. William Mar, Mr. Richard Shortgrave, and a Gentleman since
Deceased, and Henry Bond, Sen. on the 8th. of June, in the King's Majesty's
Private Garden at White Hall, observed the Variation, and found it to be 1 d.
22 m. 30 sec. West.

By Bond's Calculation, it was then 1 d. 25 m. 00 sec.

I have set down these both by Observations, and also by my Calculations, to
give the World satisfaction that I do not delude them, to make them think that
I know such things, and cannot prove them.

When any that understand themselves, have made trial by exact Observations,
and my Calculations, they will acknowledge me to be honest in that which I have
written.

There is one that puts it out in Print, that in 1666, he did Observe at the
Hermitage in Wapping, with a large Quadrant, and found the Variation to be
forty one minutes. How large soever his Quadrant was, his Understanding in this
Business was very little, and I fear, something else less.

The Variation here at London in June 1666, was 1 d. 35 m. and 36 sec. I know
not what Title to give to that forty one Minutes Observer, except it be, Mr.
Impudent Ignoramus.

I am sorry that out Nation is so much dishonored, to have things of this
Nature Schematic showing methods of calculating relation between Earth and
various magnetic spheres Fig. II.
put out in Print, that we are derided by other Nations for them.

As the Horizontal Needle has a double motion about the Round Loadstone, or
Terrula, so also the Inclinatory Needle has a double motion about the Earth,
as it plainly appears in the Diagram following.

Wherein, let A be the Center of the Earth, and B C D the one half of the
Magnetical Sphere, B A D the Axis of it; B the North Pole of it, and D the
South Pole; A C the Equator of it, or the Magnoctial, or rather a
Representation of the one half of it; E F the Inclinatroy Needle, in his Ring;
F the North End of it, and E the South End.

The Needle on the Magnequator at C, is parallel to the Magnetical Axis B A D;
but being moved forwards toward B, unto G, the North End F inclines downwards,
and so would the South End E, if it were moved toward D. So there are two
motions, one of the Instrument, and another of the Needle; and so it will be at
I, and at K, until you come to B, the North Magnetical Pole, FIG. II.
there will be continually one motion of the Instrument, a Quadrant from C to B
on the Center of the Earth, and a motion of the Needle a Quadrant from V to F,
at the North Magnetical Pole of the Earth, and then the South End of the
Inclinatory Needle will be upwards to the Zenith, and the South Point of the
Horizontal Needle will be to the North Pole of the Earth.

One of late was questioning in what part or what Distance these Magnetical
Poles were from the Earth? I answer, They are very near to the Body of the
Earth; because the nearer the Magnet, the greater the strength. Something is to
be considered concerning those Variations of the Horizontal Needle, that are
not according to the situation of the place from the Magnetical Poles, but are
contrary, as all the West Indies, according to the Poles, they should be
Easterly, and they are Westerly, which is by some accidental Cause in the
Earth; and their Motion, as I have formerly said, a forced Motion, and not
Natural. These Variations must be always the same, except we will say one
piece of the Earth moves from another, which were very absurd.

If the Inclinatory Needle be fitted as it ought to be, to turn Horizontally as
the Horizontal Needle does, it will find an amplitude or an Azimuth, as well as
the Azimuth-Compass, and has been so used by Capt. John Wood, now Captain of
His Majesty's good Ship Bone-Adventure. If the Inclinatory Needle be not fitted
to do the same that the Horizontal Needle does, it is not worth a straw to be
made use of for the Inclination; and therefore it is an Instrument of that
curiosity in the making, that it is not for such an one that will run headlong
to make any thing, although he neither understand nor know whether it be right
or wrong, nor cares not so he may get Money by it.

In the Year 1665. my Son Henry Bond sailed to the East Indies in the good
Ship, the Greyhound of London, I sent by him an Inclinatory Needle of five
inches long, in a Brass Ring, fitted as it ought to be, to observe with it on
the Land; and in the Year 1667, I wrote to him that the Inclination of the
Needle at Ballasore, the place where they were, was 32 d. 10 m. and that the
Variation was 7 d. 32 m. West. When he came home, he did acknowledge the
Inclination was 32 d. 15 m. and the Variation 7 d. 30 m. by their
Azimuth-Compass.

Now by this it is plainly evident that if by the Longitude of any place from
the Magnestical Colure, the Inclination may be found, then the Longitude of any
place from the Magnestical Colure, may be found by the Inclination, and by that
the Difference of Longitude between any two places on the Earth.

I did write in the Sea-mans Calendar above Thirty Years since, that without
doubt the Longitude would be found by the Observation of something below the
Moon. I have an Observation that was made by Mr. James Moorcock, above Thirty
Years since at Cape Charles, on the Coast of Virginia, which Observation of his
does very near agree to my Calculation now, notwithstanding it be so long
since, and I have forgotten the Year when the Observation was made; and
therefore in finding of the Longitude, I shall make use of my Inclination.

But to give the better satisfaction to the World I shall set down his
Observation and my Calculation for this present time.

Mr. Moorcock's Observation of the Inclination, somewhat above 60 d. 00 m.
Bond's, 59 d. 50 m.

Here we may take notice, that although the Alteration of the Inclination be
but slow when it has been at the greatest or least at any place, as here at,
London, since it was at the greatest in 1657, it is altered not full six
Minutes to this Year 1673; yet in process of time it alters in some places more
than the Variation, and in some places near as much as the Variation. The
Alteration of the Inclination here at London, is above Twelve Degrees, and
therefore very unlikely to find the Latitude by it.

A Question may be made, Whether the Longitude may be found at Sea by the
Inclinatory Needle?

I Answer, It may, if it be fitted and kept as it ought to be, it will do its
office as well as the Azimuth-Compass does to find the Variation.

Now I shall set down Demonstration of my Son Henry Bond's Observation at
Ballasore in East India, in 1667, which I have before mentioned.

In which Demonstration let the Circle S E P W represent the Meridian of
London, and let the Circle S M L P N O represent the Magnestical Colure, and M
the South Magnepole, and N the North Magnepole, and O R L the Magnequator, and
let P B S represent the Meridian of Ballasore, and N B M the Magnimeridian of
Ballasore, and P the North Pole of the Earth, and S the South-Pole, and let the
Angle W P N be 6 d. 00 m. that the Magnepole is gone from the Meridian of
London, from 1657, unto 1667, and the Angle B P V 119 d. 12 m. the difference
of Longitude between London and Ballasore, unto which if we add the Angle W P N
6 d. 00 m, we have the Angle B P N 125 d. 12 m. the difference of Longitude
between Ballasore and the Magnestical Colure. In the Triangle B P N, we have
the Side B P, the Co-latitude of Ballasore, 67 d. 30 m. and the Angle B P N 125
d. 12 m. and the Side P N 8 d. 30 m. the distance between the Magnepole and the
Pole of the Earth; by which we Schematic locating various magnetic and
longitudinal calculations pertaining to Ballafore in East India. Fig. III.
find the Side B N, the distance between the Zenith of Ballasore and the
Magnepole, 72 d. 33 m. which I look in the Caroline Tables or Inclinations, and
find the Inclination of the Needle to be right against it, 32 d. 10 m. By this
we may see that if we have the Inclination of the Needle at any place, and know
on which side of the Magnestical Colure it is, we may find the Longitude of the
place from the Magnestical Colure, and then knowing the motion of the
Magnepole, we may find the Longitude of the Magnepole from the Meridian of
London, or the Lizard, or from any other Meridian; and so by that find the
Difference of Longitude between any two places in the world; as I shall make it
appear by the Examples following; and first Ballasore, as in the following
Scheme. FIG. III


Example I.
At Ballasore (forementioned) in East India, North Latitude, 22 d. 30 m. the
Complement P B 67 d. 30 m. and N B 72 d. 33 m. the Distance between the Zenith
of Ballasore, and the Magnepole, and N P 8 d. 30 m. the Distance between the
Magnepole and the Pole of the Earth.

Here we have always three Sides of a Spherical Triangle given to find an
Angle; which is not hard to do: it is no difficult thing to find the Angle at
P, which is the difference of Longitude between the Magnestical Colure and the
Meridian of the place where the Observation is made.


We add the three Sides together, B N, 72 d. 33 m. and the Side B P 67 d. 30 m.
and the Side P N 8 d. 30 m. their Sum is 148 d. 33 m. their half Sum 74 d. 16
m; from which Substract 8 d. 30 m. one containing Side of the Angle sought, the
first Difference is 65 d. 46 m.; and Substract the co-latitude of the place, 67
d. 30 m. the other containing Side of the Angle sought, from the half Sum, and
the second Difference is 6 d. 46 m..

Then add the Sine of the first Difference, 65 d. 46 m., which Sine is 995996,
the Sine of the second Difference, 6 d. 46 m.; which Sine is 907177, and the
residuum of the Sine of 67 d. 30 m. which is 083030, and the residum of the
Sine of 67 d. 30 m. which is 003438. The whole Sum of the two Sines, and the
two Residuums is 1989664, the half whereof is 994832, which is the Sine of 62
d. 36 m. half the Difference of Longitude between Ballasore and the Magnestical
Colure, which being doubled, makes 125 d. 12 m. for the whole Difference of
Longitude; from which substract 6 d. 00 m. the Difference of Longitude between
London and the Magnestical Colure, in the year 1667. and the Remainer is 119 d.
12 m. the Angle B P V. the Difference of Longitude between London and
Ballasore: The like is to be done for any place that is on the North side of
the Magnequator.

In the Year 1666, in June, the Magnepole was in the Meridian of the Lizard.

Our Second Example shall be at the Cape of Good Hope, in the Year 1666.
Which is in South-Latitude 35 d. 30 m. The Inclination of the South end of the
Inclinatory Needle at that place, is 47 d. 5 m. to which there answers in the
Carolina Tables 61 d. 44 m. the Complement of the Magne-latitude, or the
Distance between the Earth-Zenith of the Cape, and the South Magnepole, as it
appears in the Second Demonstration.

Wherein, let the Circle S L E P O W, represent the Magnestical Colure, and the
Meridian of the Lizard, P the North Pole, and S the South Pole of the Earth, P
C S the Meridian of the Cape at C, and let N represent the North Magnepole, and
M the South Magnepole, and let the Arch N C M represent the Magnemeridian of
the Cape, and O R L, the Equator of the Earth, and W R E the Magnequator.

In the Triangle C S M, we have the three Sides given, C S 54 d. 30 m. the
co-latitude of the Cape, and S M 8 d. 30 m. the Distance of the Pole of the
Earth and the Magnepole, and C M 61 d. 44 m. the Distance between the
Earth-Zenith of the Cape, and the South Magnepole; the Sum of all the tree
Sides is 124 d. 44 m. the half Sum is 62 d. 22 m. From which each containing
Side of the Angle required at S, being subtracted, the first Difference is 53
d. 52 m. the second Difference is 7 d. 52 m. the Schematic representing the
magnestical colure and the meridian of the Lizard, relating to the Cape of Good
Hope in 1666. Fig. IIII
Sine of the first Difference, 990722. The Sine of the second Difference,
913630. The Residuum of 8 d. 30 m. is 083053. The Residuum of 54 d. 30 m.
008931. The whole Sum of them is 1996336; the half Sum is 998168, which is the
Sine of 73 d. 29 m. which being doubled, is 146 d. 58 m. for the Angle C S M;
which being subtracted from 180 d. 00 m. leaves the Angle V S C, the Longitude
of the Cape of Good Hope from the Lizard, whose Meridian was the same with the
Magnesticial Color in the Year 1666, and their Difference of Longitude is 33
d. 02 m. FIG. IV.


Our Third Example shall be in 1673, between the Lizard and Cape Charles on the
Coast of Virginia.
In the Demonstration, let the Circle S L E P O W represent the Magnesticial
Colure; N the North Magnepole, and M the South, P the North Pole of the Earth,
and S the South, W R E the Equator of the Earth, O R L the Magnequator, P V S
the Meridian of Virginia, viz. of Cape Charles; N V M the Magnimeridian of Cape
Charles, and V represent Cape Charles, and let the Circle S K Q P F, represent
the Meridian of the Lizard, which is 4 d. 12 m. to the Eastwards of the
Magnesticial Colure, as it appears in the Demonstration; the Inclination of the
Needle, as is before mentioned, is 59 d. 50 m. to which answers in the Caroline
Tables 49 d. 18 m. the Distance of the Earths-Zenith of Cape Charles from the
North Magnepole, the Side N V, the co-latitude of Cape Charles 52 d. 20 m. and
P N the Distance of the two Poles, 8 d. 30 m. The Sum of the three Sides 110 d.
8 m. the half Sum 55 d. 4 m. the first Difference between 8 d. 30 m. and the
half Sum, is 46 d. 34 m. the second Difference between the co-latitude of Cape
Charles and the half Sum, is 2 d. 44. m. the Sine of the first Difference
986223. the Sine of the second Difference 867840, the Residuum of 8 d. 30 m. is
083029, the Residuum of the Sine of 52 d. 20 m. 010150. the Sum of them all is
1947244, the half Sum is 97^622, which is the Sine of ^^ d. 00 m. which being
doubled, is 66 d. 20 m. unto which, if we add 4 d. 12 m. the Difference
Schematic displaying various magnetic and longitudinal calculations relating to
the Lizard and the Streights of Magellan in 1673. Fig. V
of Longitude that the Magnepole is gone to the Westwards of the Meridian of
the Lizard in June 1673, the whole Sum is 70 d. 12 m. the Difference of
Longitude between Cape Charles and the Lizard; which is according to the
Account of Capt. John Whittee, who found it in several Voyages to be 70 d. 00
m. little more or less. FIG. V.


Our Fourth Example shall be between the Lizard and the Streights of Magellan
in 1673. by Supposition, because we have no Observation there, but do it
according to that which we find to be the truest Longitude; and also to show a
Demonstration to know the Longitude of such Places as are to the Westwards, and
in South-Latitude may be found.
In the Demonstration let the Circle S E P W, represent the Magnesticial
Colure, S K Q P F represents the Meridian of the Lizard, and P B S the North
Pole of the Earth, and S the South Pole; P B S, the Meridian of the Streights
of Magellan, B Ma the Latitude of it 52 d. 20 m. and let N represent the North
Magnepole, and M the South Magnepole, N Ma the Ma M the Magnemeridian of the
Streights, and Ma the Straight it self.

The Inclination of the South end of the Inclinatory Needle there, 65 d. 26 m.
to which answers in the Caroline Tables 42 d. 26 m. the Distance between the
Earth-Zenith of the Streights, and the South Magnepole, viz. Ma M, in the
Demonstration,

Here we have three Sides of a Spherical Triangle, FIG. VI.
Ma S the co-latitude of the Streights, 37 d. 40 m. and Ma M the
Magne-co-latitude of the Streights, 42 d. 26 m. and S M the Distance of the two
Poles, 8 d. 30 m. the Sum of the three sides 88 d. 36 m. the half sum, 44 d. 18
m. the first Difference between 8 d. 30 m. and the half sum 35 d. 48 m. the
second Difference 6 d. 38 m. between the co-latitude of the Streights and the
half sum.

The sine of the first Difference, 976712, the sine of the second Difference,
906263, the Residuum of the sine of the co-latitude of the Streights, 021392,
the Residuum of the sine of 8 d. 30 m. is 083029, the sum of the four is
1987396, the half sum 993698, which is the sine of 59 d. 52 m. which being
doubled, is 119 d. 44 m. the Angle Ma, Schematic relating to various magnetic
and longitudinal calculations around the Streights of Magellan. Fig. VI.
Schematic displaying difference of longitude between the magnesticial colure
and the Meridian of London in June 1576 Fig. VII.
S M, which being subtracted from 180 d. 00 m, leaves the Angle Ma, S L, the
Longitude of the Streights from the Magnesticial Colure 60 d. 16 m. unto which,
if we add the Angle N P Q, the Difference of Longitude that the Magnesticial
Colure is to the Westward of the Lizard in June 1673, the sum is 64 d. 28 m.
the Longitude of the Streights of Magellan from the Lizard.

For a further Demonstration of this business of Longitude, we will find by our
Calculation Robert Norman's Inclination that he found in the Year 1576, or else
one Year after, which Inclination he writes of in the end of the Fourth Chapter
of his New Attractive, and says it was about 71 d. 50 m. so are his words; now
if we go backwards, accounting Thirty Six Minutes a Year for the procession of
the Magnesticial Colure from the Year 1576, unto the Year 1657, the time will
be 81 years; which multiplied by 6/10, product will be 48 d. 63 m. the
Difference of Longitude between the Magnesticial Colure and the Meridian of
London, in June 1576, FIG. VII.
I begin the Year in this business when the Sun is in the North Tropic.

In the Triangle L P M, we have the colatitude of London, L P 38 d. 28 m. and
the Distance the Magnepole from the Pole of the Earth, M P, 8 d. 30 m. and the
Angle at P, 48 d. 36 m. the Difference of Longitude between the Magnesticial
Colure and the Meridian of London; by which we find the side L M (the Distance
between the Earths-Zenith of London, and the Magnepole) to be 33 d. 19 m. to
which the Inclination against it in the Caroline Tables, is 71 d. 48 m. which
differs but two Minutes from tnat which Robert Norman said it was about, viz.
71 d. 50 m.

If Robert Norman had set down the Year, and the time of the Year, when his
Observation of the Inclination was made (as Mr. Burrowes did of the Variation)
we should not have differed any thing at all from him; the Inclination was then
increasing, but now it is decreasing, aind will be until the Year 1957, and
then the Variation will be nothing at London, as it was nothing in 1657, being
300 years distant.

If we divide the Year into Thirty Six parts, we shall find in what time the
procession of the Magnesticial Colure goes forwards one Minute, or one Mile of
the Equator of the Earth, which time will be Ten Days, Three Hours, and Thirty
Minutes; which being multiplied by 36, tne Product will be 365 Days, and 6
Hours.

Having gone thus far to find in what time the Magnesticial Colure goes
forwards one Mile of the Equator of the Earth, if we examine how much it goes
forward in 24 hours, it will be 591.37 Foot, and in one hour 24.64 Foot; here
we account one Mile according to Mr. Richard Norwood's Experiment set down in
his Sea-man's Practice, which is 6000 English Feet to one Mile or Minute of the
Equator or Meridian, according to the French 26.39 in one hour, and in one
Minute 5.278 inches.

The last thing shall be to find the least and the greatest Inclination of the
Inclinatory Needle in any Latitude.
Substract 8 d. 30 m. from the Complement of the Latitude, and look the
remainer in the Tables, and right against it is the greatest Inclination in
that Latitude, and add 8 d. 30 m. to the Complement of the Latitude, and look
the sum in the Tables, and right against it is the least Inclination.

Example 1.
Here at London the Complement of the Latitude 38 d. 28 m. and 8 d. 30 m. added
together, the sum is 46 d. 58. m. against which, there is in the Table 61 d. 50
m. the least Inclination.

And substract 8 d. 30 m. from 38 d. 28 m. and the Remainer is 29 d. 58 m.
against which in the Table is 73 d. 55 m. the greatest Inclination here at
London, which was in the Year 1657.

If the Complement of the Latitude and 8 d. 30 m. added together, exceed 90 d.
00 m. Substract it out of 180 d. 00 m. and look the remainer in the Table; then
if the Latitude given be North, the least Inclination is of the South end of
the Needle: But if the Latitude given be South, the least Inclination is of the
North end of the Needle.

Example II.
In North Latitude 7 d. 00 m. the Complement, 83 d. 00 m. unto which, 8 d. 30
m. added makes 91 d. 30 m. the remainer to 180 d. 00 m. is 88 d. 30 m. against
which in the Table, is 3 d. 00 m. the least Inclination of the South end of the
Needle, the greatest Inclination will be of the North end.

Then Subtract 8 d. 30 m. from 83 d. 00 m. the complement of the Latitude; the
remainer is 74 d. 30 m. against which in the Table is 29 d. 00 m. for the
greatest Inclination of the North end of the Needle in that Latitude.

Here is the Conclusion of Thirty Eight Years Magnetic Study and Observations.
I know when this Mystery comes to be publicly and foreignly known, it will be
the admiration of all the Christian Nations in the world; What then shall any
man have high thoughts of himself for it? God forbid: Far be it from him; let
him look upon himself as an Instrument in the Hand of Almighty God, to declare
that which he has concealed, until his own Time came that he was pleased to
make it known, for his own Glory, and the Benefit of Men in the World.

Therefore unto Almighty God be all the Praise and Glory of This, and all the
rest of his Wonderful Works.
Here follow the CAROLINE TABLES of the Complements of the Magnilatitudes to
every Five Minutes of Inclination of the Inclinatory Needle from the
Magnequator unto 84 d. 01 m. of Magnilatitude, and 87 d. 00 m. of Inclination.
