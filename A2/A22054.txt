By the King.
WHereas heretofore sundry ways have been devised to redress the disorders
among the Posts of our Realm in general, and particularly to prevent the
inconveniences both to our owneseruice, and the lawful trade of the honest
Merchants, by prohibiting that no Persons whatsoever, should take upon them
publicly or privately to procure, gather up, receive, bring in or carry out
any Pacquets, or Letters to or from any Port, City or Town, by foot or no
horseback within the Realm, and to or from the Countries beyond the Seas,
except such our ordinary Foot-postes, Posts and Messengers for those uses, as
either by our Master of the Posts, or the Masters of the Posts general of
those Countries reciproquely, should be found nominated for that kind of
service, or otherwise be able to show sufficient warrant for their voyages and
dispatches, under the hands of our principal Secretaries, any Ambassadors, or
others sufficiently authorized; Which notwithstanding diverse disauowed persons
have used to intrude themselves, contrary to all good order: In consideration
of which inconveniences past, We do hereby straightly prohibit and forbid all
persons whatsoever, directly or indirectly, to gather up, receive, bring in or
carry out of this Realm, any Letters, or pacquets, without the allowance or
ordinary address and dispach of the said Masters and Comptrollers of the
Posts reciproquely, or their Deputies, or shall be sufficiently authorized as is
aforesaid. And therefore Our will and pleasure is, That you the Lord Treasourer
of England, and Lord Warden of Our Master and Comptroller general of all Our
Posts, cause public knowledge to be given thereof unto all Merchants, both
Strangers and others, of Our City of London, and all others whom it may or
ought to concern, that neither they nor any for them, do hereafter take upon
them openly, nor underhand, to employ and disauowed person in the carrying of
their Letters, but to use such only as shall be found lawfully appointed for
that service. To which effect also We do expressly will and command by these
presents all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Bailiffe; and all special
Commissioners, And more specially all Searchers of Our Ports, and all other Our
Officers; and Ministers wheresoever in their several Jurisdictions and Office,
to make diligent search of all Males, Bougets, and other carriages, of all such
disauowed Curriers, Messengers or suspected persons, coming in, or going out
of the Realm with Pacquets or Letters, and all such so discovered, to
apprehend and stay, keeping them in safe custody until by the view of their
wrighting sent up to Our Privy Counsel, it be seen and advised what shall be
further done with them.

Given at Our Manor of Greenwich the xv. day of May, in the seventh year of
Our Reign of great Britain, France and Ireland.

Majesty. ANNO. 1609.
