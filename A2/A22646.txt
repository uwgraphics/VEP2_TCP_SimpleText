A Proclamation for the levying and payment of the Ship-Moneys in Arreare.
WHereas His Majesty, out of His Princely care of the defense of this Realm,
and safety of His Subjects: Understanding of the great prepartations of
Shipping beyond the Seas, as well this present year, as in diverse years
preceding, and the imminent perils thereby appearing on every side in these
dangerous and Warlike times: For the speedy defense of His Kingdom and people,
guarding of the Seas, and secure conduct of Shipping and Merchandise, (wherein
all His Subjects were concerned) Did as well for diverse years past, as in
November last, direct His several Writs to several Sheriffis, Majors,
Bailiffs, and other His Officers and Subjects, of the several Counties of
England and Wales, Thereby commanding the providing and getting in readiness
certain Ships furnished with Ordnance and Arms, and manned and victualled at
the charges of the said Counties, in such sort as by the same Writs were
appointed. But His Majesty finding, that the said Ships were not provided
according to the Tenor of the said Writs, nor the moneys Levied (according to
Estimates yearly given by the Lords, and others of His Majesty's Privy
Council) for setting forth those Ships; His majesty, for the common defense
and safety of His Kingdom and people, was constrained at His own great charges,
yearly to make out, and maintain that Shipping which he expected from His
Subjects.

And therefore His Majesty, as He cannot but censure the most of His Sheriffs
and other His Ministers, of great neglects in the execution of that Service,
according to their Oaths, and the duty of their places: So He will now expect
from them an undelayed and faithful performance of the same, without favor or
connivence. And to that end, His Majesty does hereby straightly charge and
command, all His present Sheriffs, Majors, Bailiffs, and other His Officers and
Ministers to whom it appertains, forthwith not only to raise and levy the
said Moneys appointed to be collected and raised for the providing and
furnishing the said Ships for this present year, But also to give forth their
Warrants to the preceding Sheriffs, Majors, and other Officers respectively,
for the raising and levying of those Arrears which happened in their times: And
that as well the Sheriffs, Majors, and other Officers for this present year, as
those for the year past, who are in Arrear to His Majesty, shall make their
payments respectively, to the Treasurers of His Majesty's Navy, at or before
the first day of October next, without further respite or delay; upon pain of
High contempt against His Majesty, and to be further proceeded with, and
punished according to the quality of their offenses, in that which so much
imports the public good and safety of the Kingdom.

Given at the Court at Whitehall the twentieth day of August, in the sixteenth
year of His Majesty's Reign.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1640.
