by the high Constables or Tything men aforesaid: In which suite, no essoigne,
protection, nor wager of law shall be allowed or admitted to the party
defendaunt. And if the said high Constables, shall be remiss or negligent to
sue, or shall refuse to sue the said Collectours and every of them within two
months next after such refusal, or negligence in or by the said Collectour:
that then the said high Constables or Tything men, shall forfayt and lose five
pounds of lawful money of England, to those of the poor of the same place, to
be sued for, by and in the name of two of the next Justices to the said place
or places, being out of Cities, Boroughes, and Towns corporate: if within,
then by the Mayor, Baylifes, or other head officers of the said Cities,
Boroughes, or Towns corporate, in any Court of record or Lords Court, by
action of debt, bill, playnt, or information, in which no essoigne, protection,
