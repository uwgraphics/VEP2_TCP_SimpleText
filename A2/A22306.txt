A Proclamation concerning Felts.
WHereas We are credibly informed, That the workers and makers of Felts within
this our Realm of England, have heretofore daily employed and set on work
many thousands of our poor subjects, both men, women, and children, in
carding, basening, felting, dressing, pouncing, blocking, and dying, with
certain other feats concerning the working and making of Felts, made and
wrought within and near our City of London, and in diverse and many other
Cities, Boroughs, and Lownes, within this Our Realm of England, and
Principality of Wales, whereby Our said poor Subjects have gotten their
living time out of mind, until of late year past, that very great abundance
of Felts, ready wrought and made in the parts beyond the Seas, have been, and
now daily are brought from foreign parts into this Our Realm, and here have
been, and daily are uttered and sold, to the utter undoing of great multitudes
of our loving Subjects, Who for want of employment, as heretofore, in making
of Felts, are now destitute of means how to live, and thereby fall to
idleness, begging, and other inconveniences: We therefore tendering the
welface of Our loving Subjects, do hereby straightly prohibit and forbid all
and every person and persons whatsoever, as well Our natural borne Subjects, as
Denizens, or Strangers, either directly or indirectly from henceforth to
vnshep, discharge, or lay on land any Felts, Hats, or Cappes, wrought, or half
wrought in any parts beyond the Seas, or in any Port, Haven, Creek, or other
place, within this Our Realm of England, or Principality of Wales, upon pain
of forfeiture of all and every such Felts, Hats, and Cappes, as shall be so
unshipped, discharged, or laid on land contrary to this Our present
Commandment; The one moytie thereof to be to Us, Our Heirs and Successors,
and the other moytie to such person or persons as shall find and make seizure
of the same, and also upon pain of our high displeasure, and such penalties,
as by the Laws of this Our Realm of England may be inflicted upon such
person so offending.

And for the better execution hereof, we do hereby further charge and command
all Customers, Comptrollers, and other Officers of Our Ports, to whom it shall
appertain, and all Farmors of Our Customs and Imposts now and for the time
being, their Clerks and substitutes, That they, and every of them do forbear
to take any entries of any Felts, Hattes, or Cappes made beyond the Seas, that
shall be brought into this Realm by any person or persons whatsoever, and
likewise all Justices of peace, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables,
headboroughs, and other Our officers and ministers whatsoever, That they and
every of them be from time to time, and at all times, and in all places
convenient, ayding and assisting unto such of Our loving Subjects as shall
desire their aid and assistance in and about the searching for, and seizing,
and carrying away of all or any such Hats, Felts, and Caps, as shall be
unshipped, discharges, or laid on land, contrary to the true meaning of this
Our Proclamation, as they and every of them will answer the contrary at their
perils.

Given at Our Court at Theobalds, the seventeenth day of September, in the one
and twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXIII.
