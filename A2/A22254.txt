HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT royal blazon of the House of
Stuart
By the King. A Proclamation for suppressing insolent abuses committed by base
people against persons of quality, as well Strangers as others, in the Streets
of the City and Suburbs of London, with the parts adjacent.
AS We have ever esteemed it a happiness to meet with any occasion, that
might justly move Us to take notice of the careful and discreet Government
of such as were trusted in high places of Authority and Magistracy under Us,
In which cases (as the world can well bear Us witness) We have ever been
ready to express the gladness of Our heart, by Our gracious thankfulness unto
them in one kind or other: So on the other side, do We hold it as necessary
a duty belonging unto Us, to whom God has committed the chief and sovereign
care of all, not only sharply to reprove where We find supine and
inexcusable negligence, but when through improuidence, and weakness of
Government, the mischief grows strong and pernicious, to take the Reformation
into our own supreme power, unless otherwise We find a speedy amendment.
Our City of London, the Prime and chief City of all others within Our
Realms and Dominions, the place that We, and Our Predecessors in this
Kingdom, have always thought worthiest to be honored with the Residence of
our Persons, and of Our supreme Courts of Justice, and which Our Self in
particular have ever since Our coming unto the Crown, favored and therished
by all the means We might, to testify Our Princely and extraordinary
affection toward them, whereof We shall never repent Us, having found in them
a like retribution of Love and duty toward Us; Yet must we needs say, to
Our grief, that in so famous a City as that is, and wherein of all others, if
any where, ciuility and humanity is to be expected, there is as just cause at
this time to charge their chief Magistrates for negligent suffering, as to
condemn the inferior and baser sort of people for acting many Insolences of
rude and savage barbarism, which daily are committed in the Streets, not only
toward Ambassadors and public Ministers of foreigne Princes and States,
whose persons ought to be sacred and privileged, by the Laws of God and
Nations, from all violence or wrong, but even toward other Strangers also, to
whom all courteous respect and hospitality is due, and generally to the whole
Nobility and Gentry of our own Realms, both men and women, having occasion at
any time to abide, or repair unto this City, insomuch as the Complaints hereof
do continually come unto Our ears, and make Us ashamed, that notwithstanding
the often and straight Commandments that We have laid heretofore upon the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen, for suppressing this wicked and deuilish humor of those
base people by severity of Justice and punishment, the same does nevertheless
continue more and more in a higher degree, to the great scandal of Our
Government, both at home and abroad, and to the dishonor of our Nation. Being
therefore resolved to endure these Insolences no longer, We have now thought
fit to declare unto the world the true sense and feeling We have of Our own
Honor, which cannot but suffer much, if by Our longer sufferance the
subordinate Magistrates and Governors, to whom the ordinary Reformation of
these Abuses does appertain, neglect their duties; And do for that cause
hereby straightly charge and command the Mayor and Aldermen of Our said City
of London, as they will answer the same hereafter unto Us, upon pain of Our
highest displeasure, and such further peril as may ensue thereupon, that they
do presently enter into some serious consultation and conference amongst
themselves, how these Affronts to Strangers, and others Our own Subjects may
be carefully prevented hereafter, that no such lewd person shall dare, either
by word or deed, to offer any injury or violence, directly or indirectly, or
so much as, by his gesture or countenance, to scoff at, or abuse any Stranger,
especially Ambassadors and public Ministers, their Servants and Followers, or
other Noblemen and Gentlemen, Ladies or Gentlewomen, Our own Subjects or
others, but to behave themselves toward them with all respect and courtesy,
meeting them in the Streets or elsewhere soever.

And although We hold it not so proper for us to prescribe a particular way
unto the said Mayor and Aldermen, how this may be effected with that good
success, which We may well expect, if they be vigilant and diligent, as
becomes them, who should best understand the means how to deal with those
inferior members of their own Body; yet hereof let them be assured, that if
it fall out any such abuses be committed again, and come to Our knowledge, We
will not only exact a strict account of the same from the whole City, but even
from that particular Alderman in whose Ward it shall happen to be done, and he
not punish it according to the fault; who if he perform his duty in time, by
admonishing all householders and other within his Ward, to be watchful over such
offenses when they happen, needs not to plead ignorance of the fact, nor in
this case will We take it for a sufficient excuse: As, on the other side, We do
hereby also expressly and straightly charge and command all Householders,
Citizens, and Inhabitants within Our said City, not only themselves to
abstain from all such violences and injuries, as before are mentioned, but in
case any rude and audacious person shall, notwithstanding so many warnings given
heretofore, and examples of Justice lately executed upon some, presume
nevertheless to commit the like offense again; That then they do with their
uttermost power and endeavor apprehend such Offender or Offenders, if the
Constable or immediate Officer be not at that instant present, or at hand, and
if he be, then to assist him the best they may, for putting the said
Offenders into the hands of Justice: And this upon peril of Our high
indignation, and of such severe punishment, as may be inflicted upon any person
that shall look on, and be known through his wilful negligence to suffer the
Malefactor to escape, now that We have declared Our Royal pleasure so expressly
on that behalf. And as We have hitherto applied this charge particularly unto
the City of London and the Liberties thereof, because there these insolences
have been for the most part committed, for any thing We have heard: Yet least
the same boldness and impudency may spread to the other parts and skirts
bordering upon the City, or the Countries adjoining thereunto, where the worser
sort of people may be alike corrupted by example of those others within the
City: We do hereby impose the like strict charge and commandment upon all
Justices of Peace, Sheriffs, Constables, and other Our Officers; As also upon
all Lords of Leetes and Liberties, and other Inhabitants whatsoever, within the
neighboring parts of the Counties of Middlesex and Surrey, near unto the City
of London, that they take the like care presently within their several
Jurisdictions and places of authority, or habitation respectively, to contain
the people within the bounds of their duty toward Us, and of respect and
ciuility unto all such persons and Strangers especially, as are before
mentioned, and have heretofore had just cause to be grieved at such barbarous
usage, as they will answer for their neglect and want of due care on that
behalf, if any complaint come unto Us of that nature hereafter.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the eighth day of April, in the nineteenth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty. ANNO DOM. M.DC.XXI*
