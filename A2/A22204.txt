By the King.
A Proclamation for the annihilating of a former Proclamation, entitled, A
Proclamation prohibiting the untimely bringing in of Wines.
Whereas by Our Proclamation given at Wansted the eleventh day of September, in
the eleventh year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland, We did
(for diverse causes therein expressed) prohibit and forbid all persons
whatsoever, as well Our natural borne Subjects as Denizens, either directly or
indirectly, from thencefoorth to vnship, discharge or lay on land any new Wines
of the growth of France, at or in any Port, Haven, Creek, or other place of
Our Realm of England, and Principality of Wales, or to buy or receive any new
Wines of the growth of France, being brought in by any others, until the first
day of December next after the date of the same Proclamation, and so until the
first day of December yearly, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such
penalties as by the Laws of this our Realm might be inflicted on offenders in
that behalf. And whereas for the more due execution thereof, We did further
charge and command all Customers, Comptrollers, and other Officers of Our
Ports, to forbear to take any Entries of such new Wines of the growth of
France, that should be brought into this Realm by any person or persons
whatsoever, until the said first day of December yearly: Now, for that We
have found by experience, that Our said Proclamation (which aimed only at the
reformation of certain abuses and inconveniences in the bringing in of Wines
from France (untimely as We supposed) has not taken that good effect We
thereby expected, but that the Wines of the said growth of France imported into
this Realm, have not only since that time (for the most part) proved worse
then before, but also Our Customs, Subsidies, and Impostes for the same by
means thereof have been much lessened and impaired: We have therefore thought
fit, that the said Proclamation should be no longer continued in force, but
that the same, and every clause and inhibition therein contained, be from
henceforth discontinued and fully determined, to all intents and purposes. And
We do hereby notify the same to all Our Subjects and others whatsoever. And
We do further hereby publish and declare, that it shall and may be lawful to
and for all and every person and persons whatsoever, as well Our natural borne
Subjects as Denizens, from henceforth yearly and every year, to vnship,
discharge or lay on land, any new Wines of the growth of France, at or in any
Port, Haven, Creek, or other place within our Realm of England, and
Principality of Wales, or to buy or receive any new Wines of the growth of
France, being brought in by any others, as well before the first day of December
now next coming, as at all and every other time or times hereafter, without
incurring any pain or penalty for, or by reason of Our said Proclamation, The
same Proclamation, or any inhibition, restraint or matter therein contained to
the contrary notwithstanding; And that all Customers, Comptrollers, and other
Officers of Our Ports to whom it shall appertain, and all Farmers of the
Customs, Subsidies and Imposts now being, and that hereafter shall be, and
their Clerks and Substitutes, shall and may lawfully make and take Entries of
and for any such Wines of the growth of France, as at any time or times,
hereafter shall be brought into this Realm by any person or persons; Our said
Proclamation or any inhibition therein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Given at Bagshot the second day of September, in the seventeenth year of Our
Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the three and fiftieth.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty.
