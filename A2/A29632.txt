The Beggars Chorus IN THE JOVIAL CREW,
THere was a jovial Beggar
And had a wooden Leg
He was lame from his Cradle
And forced for to beg
And a begging we will go will go will go
And a begging I will go.
A bag for my Oatmeal
Another for my Rye,
A little bottle by my side
To drink when I am a dry,
And a begging etc.
A Bag for my wheat
And another for my Salt,
A little pair of Crutches
To the how I can halt,
and a begging etc.
A bag for my bread
Another for my Cheese
A little Dog to follow me
To gather what I leese
and a begging etc.
To Pimlicoe we will go
Where merry we shall be
And every man with a Can in's hand
And a Wench upon his knee,
And a etc
And when that we are disposed
We tumble on the grass
With long patched Coats
For to hide a pretty Lass
And a begging we will go will go will go
And a begging we will go.
Seven years I served
My old Master Wild
Seven years I begged
Whilst I was but a child,
And a begging we will go will go, will go,
And a begging we will go.
I had the pretty knack
For to wheedle and to cry
By young and by old
Much pittyed e're was I,
And a etc.
Fatherless and motherless
Still was my complaint
And none that ever saw me
But took me for a Saint,
And a etc.
I begged for my Master
And got him store of Pelf
But Jove now be praised
I do beg for my self
And etc.
Within a hollow Tree
I live and pay no Rent,
Providence provides for me
And I am well content.
And etc.
I fear no Plots against me
But live in open Cell
Why who would be a King
When a Beggar lives so well,
And a begging we will go will go will go
and a begging we will go.
Printed for J. Clerk at the Horshooe in West-Smithfield.
