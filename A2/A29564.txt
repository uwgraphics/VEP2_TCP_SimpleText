A TRUE AND IMPARTIAL Relation of the BATTLE BETWIXT, HIS MAJESTY'S ARMY and
that of the REBELS, near Newbury in Berk-shire, Sept. 20. 1643.

WITH The several Actions of the KINGS Army since HIS MAJESTY'S removing it
from before Gloucester.

Sent in a Letter from the Army to a Noble LORD.

Printed, 1643.

My Lord,
I Have omitted all this last Week to give your Lordship an account of the
condition of His Majesty's affairs here; every day (till these three last)
having produced little in effect, but much in expectation. But now that the
long looked for Crisis of a Battle is over, I have thought in fit to inform
your Lordship, not only of the success and circumstances of that, but also of
the steps and progress to it, being doubly obliged so to do, in relation to
His Majesty's service, as well as in what I owe to your Lordships satisfaction,
both which I find in as much danger of suffering by some of our own parties,
charging the conduct of His Majesty's designs with rashness and imprudence,
as in the Rebels perverting the truth of the success of His Armies, by their
usual arts of falsity by which they have hitherto still appeared able to make
better use of Defeates, then we of Victories.

Your Lordship may be pleased to understand, that the Earl of Essex having
descended with his Army into the Vale of Gloucester, before the King could well
draw His from the Siege up to the hills to fight with him, it was not thought
fit to follow him into the enclosed Country, where the King should loose the
great advantage he had above him in strength of horse, but rather to make
choice of such a place to incamp his Army as might be aptest for these three
ends: to accommodate his Quarters; to strengthen him in Provisions; and equally
to intercept his flight a fair Country; whether he should take it by the way
of Worcester to wards Warwick, or by the way of Cyrencester toward Reading,
and to these purposes, the Town of Winchcombe and Sudely Castle were made
choice of as the most appropriate. But after two days lodging there, (the
Queens Regiment having in their coming to that Quarter defeated one of the
Earls best Regiments of Horse of Dutchmen, commanded by one Blaire) upon
intelligence that the Earl was advanced as far as Teuxbury and Vpton bridge,
(whereby it was made probable unto us, that he intended Warwick way) the King
removed his Army to Evesham; from whence (having beaten up a Quarter of theirs)
we were quickly hurried by the news that Essex had faced about, and had in the
night, with great silence, secrecy, and strange diligence, almost gained
Cirencester, and surprised two new raised Regiments of ours there, before we
could get any certain notice of his motions: having left (as it seems) most of
his great Ordnance and baggage behind him, and amusing us with a show of Forces
still in Teuxbury and Vpton, which were (as I conceive) those now remaining in
Garrison at Gloucester. Upon certainty of his remove on the Thursday, our whole
Army on the Saturday morning marched after him, our Horse with such diligence,
that on the Sunday night they Quartered within six miles of him, he at
Suningdon, we about Farringdon. Upon the Monday morning Colonel Vrrey, with a
partee of a Thousand commanded men, was sent to follow them in the Rear from
their Quarters, whilst Prince Rupert with the body of the Cavalry drew over
the directest way to meet him, and it was our good luck to cross his Army just
as our party had overtaken it upon the open Down, two miles on the Northwest
side of Aubourne, the Rebels discrying us, drew up in Battalia, leaving only a
body of some two hundred Horse upon a hill somewhat distant from the gross of
their Army, which we found means so to steal upon with Vrries party, as to
charge and rout them, and taking two Coronets and killing Forty or Fifty men,
without any loss on our part; we beat them into their Foot and Cannon, upon
which occasion we discovered such evident symptoms of fear and distraction in
their whole Army, as that the Prince was well nigh tempted from his temper, and
was once resolved to have charged (with 3000 horse alone,) their whole Army,
consisting of 2000 horse and 5000 Foot at least, and store of Cannon: But news
arriving at the instant that our Foot was, beyond expectation, advanced within
6 or 7 miles of us, it imposed upon his Highness prudence this caution, not to
adve^ture upon half our strength that rest, which the next day he might be
sure to fight for with double power: upon which consideration he made a stand,
resolving that night only to attend them and hinder their March. We had not
stood long when we discovered that the Enemy prepared for a retreat, and by
degrees drew away there baggage first, then their Foot leaving their horse at a
good distance from them. The Prince his Design hereupon was to have charged
them, when half their Forces should have been drawn off the field into those
Lanes, whereinto their baggage was already advanced, but their motions being so
very slow, and the night drawing on, upon second thoughts his Highness judged
it the best course to try, if (by a small partee) be could engage their horse,
which was then grown to be at a good distance from their Foot: this Partee he
committed to the care of Vrrey, with two Regiments only near at hand to second
him, keeping the Body of his Horse at such a distance, as might encourage the
Enemy to venture on that severed part, which they did, with a little too much
encouragement, for (to say the truth) the Regiments that should have seconded
Vrrey, not doing their parts so well as they ought, forced his Partee also to
make somewhat a disorderly retreat, and the Prince to send hasty succors to
them, which the Queens Regiment (Commanded by my Lord Iermyn) was ordered to
do, which his Lordship performed with much gallantry, being received very
steadily, by a strong body of the Enemies horse, and with a composedness in
the Officer that commanded them very remarkably. For his Lordship advancing
before his Regiment, with the Marquess de la Vieuville on the one hand, and
the Ld Digby on the other (the Enemies Volley of Carabines given them smartly
at less them 10. yards) being past, the Co^mander somewhat forwarder then the
rest, was plainly seen to prye into their countenances, and removing his
leavell from one to another to discharge his Pistol as it were by election at
the Ld Digbyes head, but without any more hurt, (saving only the burning of his
face) than he himself received by my Ld Jermyn's sword, who (upon the Lord
Digbyes Pistol missing fire) ran him with it in to the back, but he was as
much beholding to his Arms there, as the Lord Digby to his head-peece.
Immediately upon this shocke, the Queens Regiment was so charged in the rear
by a fresh body of theirs, that the greatest part of it, shifting for
themselves, the Lord Iermyn, accompanied with the French Marquess, and the
Officers only of his Regiment, thought it as safe a way as well as the most
honorable, to venture forwards through their whole Army, rather then to Charge
back through those that had environed him, and so with admirable success (the
unhappy loss of that gallant Marquess excepted) he brought 4 Colors and all
his Officers off safe, having made their way round, through the gross of the
Enemies Foot. The Lord Digby being stonn'd, and for the present blinded with
his shot, was fortunately rescued out of the middle of a Regiment of the
Enemies by a brave Charge, which Prince Rupert in Person made upon them with
his own Troop, wherein his Highness Horse was shot in the head under him, but
yet, by Gods blessing, brought him off; and so the Enemies horse being beaten
quite up to their Foot and Cannon, the night coming upon us, gave a period to
that action. That night we quartered in the Field, some 2 miles distant from
the Enemy, who by the next morning was stolen away as far as Hungerford:
whereupon, the Prince conjecturing rightly the course they would hold, drew his
Horse the directest way toward Newbury, assigning the Foot also their
Rendezvous there that night, where, luckily, they met in the Evening, at the
same instant that the Earl of Essex his Army appeared within a mile of the
Town with little thought (as I conceive) of finding his intended quarter so
prepossest: upon sight of our Army they retreated into certain hedges and
fastnesses, a mile and half distant from Newbury westward. The Rebels thus
happily overtaken in their flight, co^sultation was held of the way to prevent
their farther evading us, and it was resolved on for the best, to draw all the
Kings Army that night into a large field on the other side of Newbury,
adjoining to those closes where the Enemy had made this hault, to the end that
we might be in readiness to press upon the first motions of theirs. The night
was past in much uncertainty, but with opinion on our part, that they were
marched away. The next morning being Wednesday the 20. of Sept. by break of day;
(in stead of the flight which upon all their former proceedings we had reason
to expect) we discovered them settled in the most advantageous way imaginable of
receiving us, whether invited to it by the extraordinary advantages of the
place, or engaged to it by the despair of escaping us by a Retreat, I know
not, but there we found them, their Foot, their Horse, and their Cannon planted
with much skill, not only for molesting us and preserving themselves, but even
for temptation to us to assail them upon those disadvantages. For having
lodged their Baggage and Principal Reserve both of Horse and Foot upon a
hillside under a Wood near Hampsted, fenced by Hedges and Ditches inaccessable,
but by such and such passes, and having disposed another principal part of
their strength betwixt that and a place called Enbourne, in strong hedges, and
houses, with apt Batteries on both sides, for bravado sake, or to invite us,
they had drawn out into Battalia into little Heath on the South Side of
Enbourne three bodies of foot, both lined and flanked with strong bodies of
Horse, and under favor of Cannon, so as that upon all occasions they might
conveniently power out thither from their holds what new strength they pleased,
or, if beaten, might have a safe retreat into the adjoining fastnesses, which
nature and they had both so well secured, they being so advantagiously placed
for fight, and so disadvantagiously for subsistence, we having Newbury at our
backs to sustain us, and so many more Horse then they to cut off provisions.
It may well occur to your Lordship, to question why (since it does to so many
more to censure that) we did not endeavor to combat them so by their
necessityes as to oblige them for want of sustenance to retreat over some more
equal country, rather then to assail them upon such dangerous odds of
situation. The answer to this objection by way of excuse, that we were in some
sort to lead on, and engaged by the tempting prospect of that little Battalia I
mentioned upon the Heath; and by way of justification I am to tell you, that
there was within the Enemies dominion a round hill not suspected nor observed
by us the night before, from whence a battery would command all the plain
before Newbury, where the Kings Army stood, insomuch that unless we possessed
our selves of that hill, there was no holding of that Field, but the King must
have retreated with his Army thence, the dishonor of which, I believe you will
easily consent ought to outweigh the hazard of attempting them, and (to say the
truth) even without their having that hill, the Kings Person was exposed all
day to much more hazard of the Cannon them was fitting, the Rebels employing
it very freely where ever by any signs they could discover his presence. This
hill and that heath I mentioned, were the two eminent scenes of all that days
action, from 7 a clock in the morning till 7 at night, except only one attempt
made by them from their grand Reserve upon a pass on our right hand near the
River possessed by the Kings Life-guards, in which they were repulsed. The issue
of the Battle on the heath (first begun, and quickly ended) was a total
routing of their horse, the possessing of five pieces of Cannon there, though
able to bring off but one of them, the forcing the Foot to retreat into their
strength, though unbroken, for (give them their due) they showed themselves
like good men, and lastly the gaining and holding the place.

This action was done merely by our Horse, for (to say truth) our Foot having
found a hillocke in the heath that sheltered them from the Enemies Cannon,
would not be drawn a foot from thence. The General and Prince Ruperts
personal presence and conduct, contributed much to this good success, as also
the Lieutenant general Willmots. Chief Officers of horse, that bore a
principal part in the action it self, were my Lord of Carnarvon, Colonel
Gerard, Sir Charles Lucas, the Earl of Northampton, the Lord Chandois, and
Daniell Oneale. To name them all that did eminently there, were to give you a
Catalogue of all our Gentlemen of quality there present: for there is scarcely
any that did not behave himself remarkably. Persons of note killd there, were,
the Earl of Carnarvon, the Earl of Sunderland, Colonel Morgan, Lieutenant
Colonel Feilding, and some more Volunteeres, whose name I cannot collect,
amongst the rest, Sir George Strodes eldest Son, a Valiant and an ingenuous
young man; Persons of note hurt, of prime Officers, the Lord Andover, Sr
Charles Lucas, Colonel Charles Gerard, and Colonel Ivers. Of lower Officers,
abundance, but none that I hear either of them or these dangerously. Of
Volunteeres, the Earl of Peterborough, and Mr John Russell, Mr Edward
Sackvile, Mr Henry Howard, George Porter, with many more.

The action of the hill was carried with as much bravery both by our Horse and
Foot as on the Heath by the Horse alone, the Foot Commanded by Sir Nicholas
Byron, the Horse by Sir John Byron, who after six hours (the hottest dispute
that has been seen) gained it from my Lord of Essex his own guards that had
possessed it, enjoyed it quietly many hours, and in the end (the Enemy setting
up his rest to regaine it, after as hot a fight as at their taking it) repulsed
him, and kept it still.

Officers of note hurt there, were Colonel Darcy, George Lisle, and Ned
Villiers, and the Lord Viscount Falkland (volunteering it with too much
bravery) unfortunately killed, I may have omitted many persons as eminent in
their actions that day, as some of these I have named, but it being so endless
a task to nominate all, I have only particularized such as I conceive to be of
your Lordships acquaintance.

Your Lordship does not expect that I should tell you of noble men killed on
the other side, nor much of Gentry, but of such things as they call Officers,
their Prisoners assure us concurringly, that the most and principal of them
are slain. The night coming upon us soon after the Enemies final repulse
from that hill, the King drew all his Army up to the top of the heath, keeping
possession both of that, and of the hill till toward night; at which time, His
Horse and Foot, being extremely tired, and being probably informed that the
Enemy had retreated with their carriages, and a principal part of their Army,
it was thought sit to draw his Horse into Quarters on the other side of the
River, and His foot into the Town, principally to refresh them, and to enable
them for the next days pursuit, but in part (for J will conceal nothing from
your Lordship) to make a Bridge to a flying Enemy, least indeed too great a
despair of retreat, might have made them opiniate a second fight in that
disadvantagious place, where having not (to tell you the truth) Powder enough
left for half such another day, having spent four score barrells in it,
threescore more then had served the turn at Edgehill, nor could we be assured
that the supply from Oxford of 100. Barrells more could come to us till the
next day at noon.

Thus my Lord have I given your Lordship as true an account as I can, of Gods
blessing upon the justice of His Majesty's Armies that day, which (considering
the disadvantages we fought upon) may well be counted in it self a happy
success, but in the effects it has since had in our pursuit of my Lord of
Essex, our defeating, in that pursuit, his two best remaining Regiments of
Horse, our dissipating in so great a measure his Army, and sending the Rebels
back with so much terror, to their nest (London,) may well be reputed a great
victory; and yet I am confident that our having gained the Field, Colors,
Cannon, store of Prisoners, from them, beaten them from all places, that we
under took, repulsed them from all that they attempted, our having execution on
them in their flight', and all this with the loss of half their numbers, and
the confessed ensigns of a battle gained; will not have kindled lighter
bonefires with us in joy and thankesgiving, then with the remaining Rebels in
hopes yet farther to abuse the people, by passing still upon them deliverancies
for Victories.

From NEWBURY this 22. of Sept. 1643. Your Lordships most humble Servant.
