THE MARROW OF SACRED DIVINITY, DRAWN OUT OF THE holy Scriptures, and the
Interpreters thereof, and brought into Method.

BY WILLIAM AMES, sometime Doctor and Professor of Divinity in the famous
University at Francken in Friesland.

Translated out of the Latin, for the benefit of such who are not acquainted
with strange Tongues. Whereunto are annexed certain Tables representing the
substance and heads of all in a short view, directing to the Chapters where
they are handled. As also a table opening the hard words therein contained.

A Work useful for this Season.

1. COR. 14. 26. When ye come together, every one has a Psalm, has a
Doctrine, has a Tongue, has a Revelation, has an Interpretation. Let all
things be done unto edifying.

LONDON, Printed by Edward Griffin for Henry Overton in Popes-Head-ally next
Lumbard street. 1642.

A Brief Premonition, or forewarning of the Author, touching the reason of his
purpose.
ALthough I do not assume this to my self, to comprehend in my mind all the
thoughts of evil speakers, yet I foresee diverse exceptions which this my
endeavor (proceeding certainly from a very good intent) Proseculi genio
according to the disposition of the world, will fall into; the chief of which
I purpose briefly to meet withal.

Some, and those indeed not unlearned, dislike this whole manner of writing,
that the sum of Divinity should be brought into a short compend. They desire
great Volumes, wherein they may loosely either dwell, or wander. Whom I desire
to consider, that all have not so great leisure, or so vast a wit, as to hunt
the Partrich in the Mountains, and Woods: but that the condition of many does
rather require, that the nest it self, or the seat of the matter which they
pursue, be showed without any more ado.

Some do not dislike this way, if the chief heads be handled in a Rhetorical
way, but they think that every particle is not so punctually to be insisted
on. But indeed, when the speech is carried on like a swift stream, although it
catch many things of all sorts, yet you can hold fast but a little, you can
catch but a little, you cannot find where you may constantly rest: but when
certain rules are delivered, the Reader has always, as it were at every
pace, the place marked where he may set this foot.

Some also there will be, who will condemn the care of Method, and Logical
form as curious and troublesome. But to them a sounder judgment is to be
wished, because they remove the art of understanding, judgment, and memory
from those things, which do almost only deserve to be understood, known, and
committed to memory.

On the otherside there will not be wanting some who will require more
exactness of the art of Logic, whom I could not fully satisfy if I would,
through my own imperfection, neither indeed would I so much as I could, because
of the weakness of others. I imagine there will not be few who will think
that to set forth such institutions as these, after so many labors of learned
men in the same kind, is superfluous, and but to do that which has been done
before. Of whose opinion I should readily be, if any thing of this kind were
extant, which did please all in every respect.

Which notwithstanding, I would not have so taken, as if it ever came into my
mind to hope any such thing of this writing; but because I am not out of hope,
that it may come to pass that two, or three or so, may fall upon this of ours,
who may here find something more fit to instruct, and stir them up to piety,
then they have observed in the more learned writings of others; which
conjecture if it do not fail me, I shall think I have done a work worth the
labor.

I cannot but expect to be blamed of obscurity of those that are not so
skillful, whom I desire that they would learn of Cyrus, Radiorum (...), latis
luminibus non tam esse suaves, that is, The diffused brightness of the beams
of the Sun is not so pleasant in large windows; certainly a contracted light,
although it may seem small, yet it does more enlighten (if a man come near and
observe) then that which is, as it were dispersed, by too much enlargement.

The dryness of the style, and harshnesse of some words will be much blamed by
the same persons. But I do profer to exercise my self ^n that heresy, that
when it is my purpose to Teach, I think I should not say that in two words
which may be said in one; and that that key is to be chosen which does open
best, although it be of wood, if there be not a golden key of the same efficacy.

Lastly, if there be any who desire to have some practical things, especially
here following, more largly explained, we shall endeavor to satisfy them
hereafter (if God give leave) in a particular Treatise, which at this time we
have an affection to, touching questions which are usually called cases of
conscience.

If there be any who do yet find fault with, or desire other things, I would
entreat them, that they would vouchsafe heartily to impart to me their
thoughts, which may afford desired matter for a just apology, or due amendment.

To the Reader.
These words explained are not intended for the learned, but for the unlearned,
whereby they may come to the understanding of this book and others of the same
nature, and the rather because many sentences may depend on the opening of a
word.

THE FIRST BOOK OF DIVINITY.
The first Chapter.
Of the Definition, or Nature of Divinity.

DIvinity is the doctrine of living to God, John 6. 68. The words of eternal
life, Acts 5. 20. The words of this life, Romans 6. 11. Reckon your selves to be
alive unto God.

2. It is called a doctrine, not as if the name of Intelligence, Science,
Sapience, Art, or Prudence were not hereto belonging; for all these are in
every accurate Discipline, and especially in Divinity: but because this
discipline is not from Nature and humane invention, (as others are) but from
divine revelation and institution. Isay 51. 4. Doctrine shall proceed from me,
Matthew. 21. 25. From Heaven: why did you not then believe him? John 9. 29. we
know that God spoke to Moses, Gal. 1. 11. 12. The Gospel is not according to
man: for neither did I receive it from man, neither was I taught it, but by
Revelation, John 6. 45.

3. The principles of other Arts being inbred in us may be polished and brought
to perfection, by sense, observation, experience, and induction: but the solid
principles of Divinity how ever they may be brought to perfection by study and
industry, yet they are not in us from Nature. Matthew. 16. 17. flesh and blood
has not revealed this unto thee.

4. But seeing every Art consists of rules, whereby some Act of the Creature is
directed, and seeing life is the most noble of all acts, it (that is Divinity)
cannot properly be conversant about any other thing then about life.

5. And seeing, that, that life of the Creature is most perfect, which comes
nearest to the living, and life-giving God, therefore the nature of Divinity
life is to live to God.

6. Men live to God when they live, according to the will of God, to the glory
of God, God inwardly working in them, 1. Pet. 4. 2. 6. that he might live after
the will of God; according to God. Gal. 2. 19. 20. That I may live to God:
Christ lives in me. 2. Cor. 4. 10. that that life of Jesus might be manifest in
our bodies. Phil. 1. 20. Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life
or death.

7. This life, as touching its essence remains one and the same, from its
beginning unto eternity. John 3. 36. and 5. 24. He that believes in the Son
has eternal life, 1. John (...). 15. Life eternal remaining in him.

8. But although in this life there is contained as well to live happily as to
live well, yet (...), to live well, is more excellent then (...), to live
happily; and that which ought chiefly and finally to be respected is not
blessedness, which respects our profit, but goodness, which is referred to
Gods glory. Therefore Divinity is better defined by that good life whereby we
live to God, then by a blessed life whereby we live to our selves; as it is
called of the Apostle by a Synecdoche. The doctrine according to God lives, 1.
Tim. 6. 3.

9. Moreover seeing this life is a spiritual act of the whole man, whereby he
is carried on to enjoy God, and to do according to his will, and it is manifest
that those things are proper to the will, it follows that the prime and proper
subject of Divinity is the will. Pro. 4. 23. From the heart comes actions of
life. And 23. 26. Give me thy heart.

10. But seeing this life and will is truly and properly our most perfect
practice, It is of it self manifest, that Divinity is practical, and not a
speculative discipline, not only in that common respect, whereby other
disciplines have their (...), well doing for their end, but it is practical in
a peculiar and special manner and above all other.

11. Neither indeed is there any thing in Divinity which is not referred to the
last end, or to the means pertaining to that end: all of which kind do
directly tend to Practice.

12. This practice of life is so perfectly contained in Divinity, that there is
no precept universally true pertaining to living well, contained in the
disciplines of household government, morality, political government or making
Laws, which does not properly pertain to Divinity.

13. Divinity therefore is of all Arts, the supreme, most noble, and the
masterpiece, proceeding in a special manner from God, treating of God, and
divine matters, and tending and leading man to God, in which respect it may be
not unfitly called (...), or (...), as well as (...), that is a living to God,
or a working to God, as well as a speaking of God.

CHAPTER II.
Of the Distribution or parts of Divinity.

1. THere are two parts of Divinity, Faith and observance. 2. Tim. 1. 13. Hold
the express form of wholesome words, which thou have heard of me with faith
and love. 1. Tim. 1. 19. Having faith and a good conscience. Psalm. 37. 3. Trust
in the Lord and do good. Of those parts did the Divinity of Paul consist, Acts
24. 14, 15, 16. I believe all things that are written, and have hope in God: I
exercise myself to have a conscience void of offense: the same were the parts
of Abraham's divinity, Genesis 15. 6. and 17. 1. Abraham believed Iehova: walk
before me continually and be perfect. The same does Christ require of his
Disciples, when besides faith he requires that they observe all things that he
has commanded, Mat. 28. 20. The same does Paul handle, in the Epist. to the
Romans wherein it is manifest that the sum of Divinity is contained. Finally, he
would that the same should be taught in the Churches, Tit. 3. 8. these things I
will that thou affirm, that they that have believed God, might be careful to
go before in well doing.

2. A property of this distribution (which is required in a genuine
distribution of every art) is, that it flouwes from the nature of the object.
For seeing the beginning and first act of spiritual life, (which is the proper
object of Divinity) is faith, and the second act or operation flowing from that
principle is observance, it necessarily follows that those two are the genuine
parts of Divinity, neither is there any other to be sought for.

3. In the old Testament (fitly for that legal and servile estate) Divinity
seems sometime to be divided into the fear of God and observing of his
Commandments, according to that Eccles. 12. 15. The sum of all is, fear
God, and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. But by a
metonymie faith is included on the former part, as appears out of Pro. 3. 5.
7. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart: fear the Lord, and depart from
evil.

4. These two parts in use indeed and exercise are always joined together, yet
in nature and precepts then are distinguished.

5. They are also so distinguished in order of nature, that faith holds the
first place, and spiritual obedience the latter: for there can be no vital
actions brought forth, unless a principle of life be first begotten within.

CHAPTER III.
Of Faith.

1. FAith is a resting of the heart on God; as on the author of life and
eternal salvation: that is to say, that by him we may be freed from all evil,
and obtain all good, Esa. 10. 20. Let him lean upon Iehova the holy one of
Israel in Faith. Psalm. 37. 5. Roll thy way upon Iehova, and trust in him,
Ierem. 17. 7. Blessed is the man who trusts in Iehova, and whose confidence
Iehova is.

2. To believe commonly signifies an act of the understanding yielding assent
to testimony: but because the will is wont to be moved thereupon, and to
stretch forth it self to embrace the good. so allowed, therefore Faith does
aptly enough set forth this act of the will also, in which manner it is
necessarily understood in this place. For it is a receiving, John 1. 12. As
many as received him -- who believe.

3. Hence Faith is carried unto that good which by it is made ours, is an act of
election, an act of the whole man, which things do in no wise agree to an act
of the understanding. John 6. 35. He that comes to me, he that believes in
me.

4. Therefore although Faith always presuppose a knowledge of the Gospel, yet
there is no saving knowledge in any, (and which differs from that which is
found in some that shall not be saved) but what follows this act of the will,
and depends upon it. John 7. 17. and 8. 31. 32. 1. John 2. 3.

5. That truly Christian Faith which has place in the understanding does
always lean upon a Divine testimony, as it in Divine: yet this testimony
cannot be received without a pious affection of the will toward God. John 3.
33. He that receives his testimony, has sealed that God is true, Romans 4. 20.
He was strengthened in Faith, giving glory to God.

6. Neither yet because it is grounded only upon a testimony, is it the more
uncertain and doubtful: but more certain in its own nature then any humane
science, because it is carried to its object under a formal respect of
infallibility: although by reason of the imperfection of the habit whence Faith
flows, the assent of Faith in this or that subject oft-times appears, weaker
then the assent of science.

7. Now God is the object of Faith, not as he is considered in himself, but as
we by him do live well. 1. Tim 4. 10. We hope in the living God, who is the
preserver of all men, especially of those that believe.

8. Christ as Redeemer is the mediate object of Faith, but not the highest, for
we believe in God through Christ. Romans 6. 11: to live to God by Christ. 2. Cor.
3. 4. we have trust through Christ to Godward, 1. Pet. 1. 21. Through him
believing in God.

9. The sentences in the Scriptures or promises, do contain and present an
object of Faith, and they are called the object of Faith by a Metonimy of the
adjunct^ The good which is propounded to be obtained, as it is such, is the end
and effect of Faith, not properly the object it self.

But that, upon whose power we rest, in the obtaining of that good, is the
proper object of Faith. 1. Cor. 1. 23. We preach Christ, and 2. 2. I determined
to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ, 2. Cor. 5. 19. God in Christ.

10. With this Divine Faith, which looks to the will of Cod and our own
salvation, we must not simply believe any man, but God above, Romans 3. 4. Every
man is a liar, 1. Cor. 2, 5. that your faith consist not in the wisdom of men.

11. Therefore the Authority of God is the proper and immediate ground of all
truth in this manner to be believed: whence is that solemn speech of the
Prophets every where, the Word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord.

12. Hence, the last resolution of Faith as it sets forth a thing to be
believed, is into the authority of God, or Divine revelation. 2. Pet. 1. 20,
21. If ye first know this, that no prophety of Scripture is of private
interpretation, etc. John 2. 29. We know that God spoke to Moses; As the last
resolution of it as it notes the act of believing, is into the operation, and
inward persuasion of the Holy Spirit, 1. Cor. 12. 3. 11. That none can call
Jesus Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.

13. This Faith whereby we believe not only a God, or give credit to God, but
believe in God, is true and proper confidence: not as by this word is set forth
a certain and absolute persuasion of good to come, but as it signifies choosing
and apprehending of a sufficient, and fit means, and such wherein such a
persuasion, and expectation is founded. In which sense men are said to put
confidence in their wisdom, power, friends and riches. Psa. 78. 2. They
believed not in God nor trusted in his salvation.

14. This is every where declared in those phrases of Scripture, wherein the
true nature of solid Faith is unfolded, (...) To lean upon, as Isay 10. 20. and
(...) Pro. 3. 5. and (...) Isa. 50. 10. (...) Pro. 3. 5. Isa. 50. 10. (...)
Psalm. 71. 6. (...). Romans 10. 11.

15. Therefore to believe in God, is in believing to cleave to God, to lean on
God, to rest in God as in our all-sufficient life and salvation. Deuteronomy. 30, 20.
by cleaving to him, for he is thy life.

16. Hence that general assent, which the Papists make to be Faith, is not
Faith, because by their own consession, it may be without any life, James 2, 17.

17. But that special assent whereby we resolve that God is our God in Christ,
is not the first act of Faith, but an act flowing from Faith: for there is no
greater certainty of this truth in thee then in another, nor a truer
apprehension of it in thee then another, before thou have specially applied thy
self to God by Faith, Romans 5. 1, 2. Being justified by Faith, we have peace
toward God, we glory in God.

18. Seeing also that Faith is the first act of life, whereby we live to God,
in Christ it must needs consist in union with God, which an assent given to the
truth concerning God can in no wise do.

19. Further also, seeing he that is about to believe out of a sense of his
misery, and defect of any deliverance, either in himself, or in others, must
needs cast himself upon God in Christ, as a sufficient, and faithful Savior,
he cannot in any measure so cast himself by an assent of the understanding,
but by a consent of the will.

20. Although in Scriptures sometimes an assent to the truth which is touching
God and Christ, John 1. 50. is accounted for true Faith, yet there is a
special confidence always included: and so in all places where there is
speech of saving faith, either a confidence in the Messiah is presupposed, and
there is only declared a determination, or application of it to the person of
Christ: or by that assent confidence is set forth as an effect by its cause,
John 11. 25, 26. He that believes in me shall live: believe thou this? He
says, yea Lord, I believe that thou art that Christ, that Son of God who
should come into the world.

21. But whereas confidence is said to be a fruit of Faith, it is true of
confidence, as it respects God, for that that is to come, and it is a firm
hope: but as it respects God in Christ, offering himself in present, it is
Faith it self; Hence arise those titles which the Scripture gives to saving
Faith, that it is (...), Persuasion, boldness. 2. Cor. 3, 4. and 5, 6, 7, 8.
Ephesians. 3, 12. 1. Pct. 1. 13. 1. John 5. 13, 14. (...) a full persuasion. Romans
4. 21. Col. 2. 2. (...) the substance, Heb. 11. 1.

22. Now whereas true Faith is of some placed partly in the understanding, and
partly in the will, that is not so accurately spoken, because it is one single
virtue, and does bring forth acts of the same kind, not partly of Science, and
partly of affections. 1. Cor. 13, 13. But that solid assent yielded to the
promises of the Gospel is called Faith; and confidence, partly because it
begets Faith as it is a general assent: partly because it flows from that
confidence as it is a special and solid assent apprehending the actual
possession of grace already obtained. For so it rests upon confidence of the
heart, as a^ mean, or third argument, by force whereof such a conclusion only
can be inferred. E. G. He that believes, I am sure he shall be saved.
Experience also teaches that that particular assurance of the understanding is
wanting in some, for a time, who notwithstanding have true Faith lying hid in
their hearts.

CHAPTER IIII.
Of God, and his Essence.

1. IN the former dispute, we have treated of Faith: now order requires, that
we treat of God, who is the object of Faith: which that it may be somewhat
more exactly done, we will first speak of the knowledge of God.

2. God as he is in himself cannot be apprehended of any, but himself 1. Tim.
6. 16. Dwelling in that inaccessible light, whom never man saw, nor can see.

3. As he has revealed himself unto us, he is conceived as it were, by the
back parts, not by the Face. Exodus 33. 23. Thou. shall see my back-parts, but
my Face cannot be seen, and darkely, not clearly, that is, after an humane
manner, and measure, 1. Cor. 13. 12. Through a glass: darkely, after a sort.

4. Because those things that pertain to God are necessarily explained after
an humane manner: hence is that manner of speaking frequent in these matters
which is called (...). I. E^. figure that attributes those things to God which
be proper to men, as in humane affections senses or members.

5. Because also they are explained after our measure, to man's capacity, hence
many things are spoken of God according to the way of our conceiving, rather
then from his Nature.

6. We cannot know him otherwise, so as yet to live: neither have we need to
know him otherwise that we may live well, Exodus 33, 19, 20.

7. That which is revealed of God is sufficient for us, that we may live well,
Deuteronomy. 29, 29. Those things which are revealed to us, and our children, for ever
that we may do all the words of this Law.

8. Now that which may be known of God his Sufficiency and his Efficiency Romans
4. 21. Being fully persuaded, that he who had promised, was able to perform.

9. These two, are the Pillars of Faith, the props of comfort, the incitements
of piety, and the surest marks of true Religion: proved by the place before
Viz. Romans 4. 11.

10. The sufficiency of God, is that whereby he himself has sufficient in
himself for himself, and for us: hence also is he called, All-sufficient, Genesis
17, 1.

11. This sufficiency of God is the first ground or reason of our Faith, why we
believe in him, viz. because he is able to give us life, Romans 4. 20.

12 The sufficiency of God is in his Essence, and Subsistence.

13. The Essence of God is, that, whereby he is a being, absolutely first. Isa.
44, 6. I am the first and the last, besides me there is no God. Rev. 1. 8. and
21. 6. and 22, 13. I am Alpha, and Omega, the beginning and end, the first and
the last.

14. This Essence of God is declared in his Name. Iehova.

Now because the Essence of God is such, hence it. follows.

15. Frst, that God is one, and only one, Deuteronomy. 6. 4. 1. Tim. 2, 5. Ephesians. 4,
6. 1. Cor. 8, 5, 6. Mark 12. 32. Romans 3. 29, 30.

16. Secondly, that (...) (...) (...) (...) that is, neither from another, nor
of another, nor by another, nor for another.

17. Thirdly, finally hence it is that he is void of that power which is called
passive, hence he is unchangeable, Psalm. 102. 27, 28. thou remainest: thou art
the same. Romans 1. 23. the glory of the Incorruptible God, James 1. 17. With
whom there is no variableness, nor shadow of turning, or changing.

18. Now because this Essence cannot be sufficiently comprehended of us by one
Act, it is explicated of us as if it were manifold, namely by many attributes.

19. They are called attributes, because they are rather said to be attributed
to God, then properly to be in him, if they be taken as the words sound.

20. These attributes in God, are one most pure, and simple act. Hence the
nature of the Divine attributes, may be rightly explained by these propositions
as so many Consectaries, consequences, or conclusions.

21. First all the attributes of God are truly spoken of God, as well in the
abstract as in the concrete.

22. Secondly, those attributes which are in a sort common to God with the
Creatures, do in their substance belong to God in the first place, to the
Creatures secondarily: although the names are transferd from the Creatures to
God, and so do first agree to the Creatures.

23. Thirdly, the Divine attributes do admit no inward intention, extention,
remission or imparity.

24. Fourthly, the Divine attributes are not contrary one to another, but do
very well agree together.

25. Fifthly, all Divine attributes are as it were Divine perfections: yet so
as that all imperfection, which accompanies such a property in the Creature, is
to be removed in this application of it to God, and the perfection thereof is
to be conceived with greatest eminency.

26. Sixthly, Divine attributes are in God, not only virtually, and by way of
eminency, but also formally, although not in that manner, that qualities, are
in the Creatures.

27. Seventhly, they are in God as in a second Essence, because they are not of
the formal reason of the Divine Essence, for we conceive God to be, before we
can conceive him to be just, and good.

28. Eighthly, they are distinguished, from the Essence, and among themselves,
not only in reason (as they say) reasoning, but also reason reasoned, so that
the foundation of the distinction is in God himself.

29. Ninthly, those attributes, which in their formal respect, include
something proper to the Divine Essence, are altogether incommunicable: as
Omnipotency, Immensity, Eternity, and such like.

30. Tenthly, those that are said to be communicated to the Creatures, do
agree to them by likeness, not altogether in the same manner as they are in
God: neither yet altogether aequivocally.

31. The attributes of God set forth, What God is, and Who he is.

32. What God is, none can perfectly define, but that has the Logic of God
himself. But an imperfect description which comes nearest to unfold Gods
nature, and may be conceived of us, is such as this.

33. God is a Spirit having life in himself. John 4. 24. God is a spirit, and
Chap. 5. 26. The Father has life in himself.

34. He is called a Spirit. 1. Negatively, because he is not a body. 2.
Analogically, or by a certain likeness, because there are many perfections in
spiritual substances which do more shadow forth the Divine nature, then any
bodily thing can.

35. He is said to be Living. 1. Because God does most especially work of
himself, not being moved by another. 2. Because the vital action of God is
his very Essence. 3. Because he is the Fountain of all being; and vital
operation to other living things. Acts 17. 25. 28. He gives to all life, and
breath, and all things: in him we live, move, and be.

36. He is said to live in himself, because he receives neither being nor
life, from any, in any part.

37. Hence, the chief title of God whereby he is distinguished from all
Idols, is, that he is the living God. Deuteronomy. 32. 40. Psalm. 84. 23. Ierem. 5. 2.

38. Hence our Faith seeking eternal life, does rest in God alone, because God
is the Fountain of all life. John 5. 26.

39. Who God is, those properties do set forth to us whereby he is
distinguished from all other things.

40. Now those Divine properties do show, How great God is, and what an one he
is.

41. Under the motion of Quantity he is said to be. 1. One. 2. Infinite. First
inwardly, because he is unmeasurable. Secondly, outwardly as he is
incomprehensible. 3. He is said to be eternal.

42. He is said to be One, not in kind, but in that most perfect unity, which
in the Creatures, is wont to be called numericall, and individual.

43. God is infinite, as he is void of all bounds of his Essence, Psalm. 139, 8.
If I clime up to Heaven, thou art there: or make my bed in the Grave, be hold
thou art there.

44. God is unmeasurable, as he is void of all matter of dimension or measure.
1. King 8. 27. The Heavens, and Heavens of heavens do not contain thee. Isa.
66. 1. Heaven is my throne, Earth my foote-stoole.

45. Hence Faith does look for no certain measure of blessedness, to be
communicated from God, but unmeasurable glory.

46. God is incomprehensible, because he is void of any bounds to compass him.

47. Hence he is present every where; because there is no place whence he is
excluded any where.

48. God is also eternal, because without beginning and end. Psalm. 102. 25.
26. Esaias 44. 1. 1. Tim. 1, 17.

49. Hence it is, that our Faith does apprehend eternal life in God.

50. What an one God is those properties do set forth by which he is said to
work: unto these now ought to be attributed all the properties of Essence, and
quantity, simplicity, immutability, eternity, and immensity.

51. These qualities are conceived either under the reason of faculties or else
of virtues, by which those faculties are adorned.

52. The faculties are understanding and will, whence Faith does lean upon
him, who knows what is needful for us, and is willing also to supply it.

53. The understanding of God is simple without any composition, discourse or
representation of shapes. Heb. 4. 13. All things are naked and open to his eyes.

54. The understanding of God is unchangeable: he knows not otherwise, nor
more one thing then another, nor more before then now, or now then before. Acts
15. 18. known to the Lord are all his works, from before all ages.

55. The understanding of God is eternal: it neither begins nor ends.
Ibid.

56. The understanding of God is Infinite, because he perceives all truths,
and reasons of all things. Job 11. 8. 9. The Wisdom of God is heigher then the
Heavens, longer then the Earth: deeper then the Sea. Psalm. 139. 6. thy
knowledge is more wonderful then that I can conceive it.

57. The same way also the nature of the Divine will ought to be conceived of
us.

58. The will of God is single and only one in God.

59. The will of God is unchangeable: because he always wills the same, and
in the same manner. Psalm. 33. 1. The counsel of the Lord remains for ever.

60. The will of God is eternal; because he does not begin to will what
before he would not, nor cease to will that which before he willed. Mala. 3.
6. I Iehova change not.

61. The will of God may be said to be infinite: because it has no outward
limitation.

62. The affections which are given to God in Scripture, as love, hatred, and
the like, do either set forth acts of the will, or do agree to God only
figuratively.

63. A virtue is the perfection of the understanding and will, such as is
wisdom, holiness, and the like in God.

64. Virtue is attributed to God, as it notes a readiness of doing: not under
the respect of an habit distinct from faculty and act.

65. But the virtues which in man arise from occasion of sin and
imperfection, do not agree to God, as humility, chastity, shamefastnes, and
the like.

66. Out of all these attributes, that perfection of God does result, whereby
he is called blessed, 1. Tim. 1. 11. and 6. 15.

67. Hence our Faith has a firm foundation, because it leans on God the
possessor and author of all perfection, blessedness and glory.

CHAPTER V.
Of the Subsistence of God.

1. THe Subsistence of God is that one Essence, as it is with its personal
properties.

2. The same essence is common to three subsistences, and as touching the
Deity, every subsistence is of it self.

3. Nothing moreover is attributed to the Essence, which may not be attributed
to every subsistence in regard of the Essence of it.

4. But those things that are attributed properly to every subsistence in
regard of its subsistence, cannot be attributed to the Essence.

5. The subsistences are distinguished from the Essence, as the manners of
subsisting growing together with the same Essence are distinguished from the
same absolutely considered.

6. They are distinguished among themselves, as Relatives by certain relative
properties; so as one cannot be another; yet they are together in nature,
neither can they be said to be former, or latter; but in order of beginning,
and manner of subsisting.

7. But seeing those relative properties are, as it were individuating in an
Essence that lives spiritually and most perfectly: therefore those subsistences
are rightly called persons.

8. Now these properties are not inherent qualities, but relative affections,
unto which agrees all that perfection, which is found in the like affections of
the Creature, but no imperfection agrees to them.

9. Hence it is that a relative property in God does make or infer a person,
which in the Creatures has not the same reason.

10. Those subsistences are either breathing, as Father, and Son; or
breathed, as the Holy Spirit.

11. To breath, or send forth is a relation, not such as by it self can make a
person, but common to two persons.

12. The relative property of the Father is to beget, Psalm. 2. 7. Thou art my
Son, this day I begot thee. John 3. 16. the only begotten Son. Heb. 1. 6.
The first begotten. Hence he is the first in Order.

13. The relative property of the Son is to be begotten, that is, so to
proceed from the Father, that he is partaker of the same Essence, and does
perfectly resemble his nature: and hence, he is the second in order, Heb. 1. 3.
The brightness of his glory, and the Character of his Person.

14. The property of the holy Ghost, is to be breathed, or sent forth, and
proceed both from the Father, and the Son. John 15. 26. Whom I will send to
you from the Father, that spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, Romans
8. 9. The spirit of Christ. Gal. 4. 6. The spirit of the Son.

15. The difference between (these two) to be begotten, which agrees to the
Son, and to proceed, which is proper to the holy Ghost, cannot be explained
by us in proper words, but that the Son proceeds from the Father alone, and
the holy Ghost from the Father and the Son, making one relative together, Or
making together one relation.

16. Yet it may, in part, be shadowed out in a similitude; namely the father is
as it were, Deus intelligens, God understanding: the Son the express Image
of the Father, is as it were Deus intellectus, God understood; the holy Spirit
flowing and breathed from the Father by the Son, is as it were Deus dilectus,
God beloved.

The Son is produced as it were by an act of understanding or speaking, from
the understanding, or fruitful memory of the Father: the holy Spirit is
produced by an act of loving or breathing from the fruitful will of the Father
and the Son. Hence the Son is called the word, Wisdom, Image, which are
not affirmed of the holy Ghost. But because in the Creatures there is found the
generation of a son, but there is not any thing found which does so
immediately procced from two equally perfect (as the holy Spirit proceeds
from the Father, and the Son) therefore the procession of the Son is
properly designed, noted, or set down in Scripture: but neither is a special
manner of proceeding, nor special name absolutely proper given to the third
person. For it is truly said of the Father and the Son, that they are
spirits, and holy, and the Son also proceeds from the Father by spiritual
generation.

17. The proper name of God, with his proper titles, is given in Scripture, not
only to the Father, but also to the Son. Ier. 23. 6. Iehova our
righteousness, John 1, 1. The word was God, Romans 9. 5. God blessed for ever,
1. Tim. 3, 16. God manifest in the flesh, Rev. 17. 14. Lord of Lords, and King
of Kings. It is also given to the holy Spirit. Acts 5. 3, 4. that thou
should ly to the holy Spirit, thou have lien unto God, Acts 28. 25. with
Isay 6. 9. Iehova said, the holy Ghost spoke, 1. Cor. 3. 16. and 6. 19. 2. Cor.
6. 16. the Temple of God, the Temple of the spirit.

18. Divine attributes are affirmed not only of the Father, but also of the
Son, Isay 9. 6. The most mighty God. Father of eternity, John 2. 25. He knew
what was in man, and 3. 13. The son of man is in Heaven, and 8. 38. Before
Abraham was I am. In like manner also of the holy Spirit, Psalm. 139. 7. Whither
shall I fly from thy spirit. 1. Cor. 2. 10. The spirit searches all things,
even the deep things of God. Heb. 9. 14. the eternal spirit.

19. The proper operations of God, are attributed not only to the Father, but
also to the Son, and the holy spirit. Election is attributed to the Son,
Mat. 24. 31. His elect, and the eternal counsel of God is attributed to the
holy Ghost. Isay 40. 13. Who has waighed the spirit of the Lord as the man of
his counsel, Creation, is attributed to the Son, John 1. 3. All things were
made by him, and without him was made nothing that was made: Also it is
attributed to the holy Spirit, Psalm. 33. 6. By the Word of the Lord were the
Heavens made, and all the strength of them by the breath of his mouth.
Upholding, and governing of things created is attributed to the Son, Heb. 1.
3. Who upholdeth all things by that his mighty Word. Also they are attributed
to the holy Spirit. Genesis 1. 2. The spirit did move upon the face of the waters.
Zech. 4. 6. By my Spirit says the Lord of Hosts; Proper Power of doing
miracles is given to the Son. Act. 4. 10. Through the name of Jesus Christ, he
stands before you whole, and 9, 34. Jesus Christ he aleth thee. Its also
given to the holy Spirit, Acts 2. 4. They began to speak with tongues, as the
spirit gave them utterance. The communicating of spiritual life, and of all
grace, in vocation, justification, adoption, sanctiand glorification, fication,
is every where given as well to the Son and holy Spirit as to the Father, the
ordaining, sending and blessing of Ecclesiastical Ministry is given to the
Son, Ephesians. 4. 8. 11. He gave gifts, he gave some Apostles, etc. And to the holy
Ghost, 1. Cor. 12. 11. All these works one and the same spirit, Act. 20. 28.
The holy Spirit has made you overseers. The very Resurrection of the flesh is
ascribed to the Son, as the author, John 6. 54. I will raise him up. Also to
the holy Spirit, Romans 8. 11. He shall raise up your bodies, by his spirit
dwelling in you.

20. Divine honor also, and worship is given, not only to the Father, but also
to the Son, Heb. 1. 6. Let all the Angels of God worship him. And also to the
holy Spirit: when his Name together with the Father and the Son, is appointed
to be called upon over the Baptized. Mat. 28. 19. In the name of the Father,
and Son, and holy Spirit. In like manner the Son, and Spirit is called
upon, in that solemn form of salutation. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God the Father, and the communication of the holy Spirit be
with you all, 2. Cor. 13. 13. And whatsoever pertains to worship is referred
as well to Christ as to the holy Spirit, in that the true worshippers of God,
as they are such, are called Temples not only of God the Father, but also of
Christ, Rev. 21. 22. The Lord God Almighty is her Temple, and the Lamb. 1.
Cor. 3. 16. Know ye not, that ye are the Temple of God, and the Spirit of God
dwells in you? and 6. 19. Know ye not that your body is the Temple of the
holy Spirit, who is in you.

21. Finally, that authority, and majesty, which is proper to God, is given to
the Son and the spirit. 1. Cor. 2. 8. The Lord of glory, 1. Pet. 4. 14. that
spirit of glory. All holy prophecy is attributed to Christ and the holy Spirit.
1. Pet. 3. 19. Christ by his spirit went and preached to the spirits that are
in prison. 2. Pet. 1. 21. Holy men spoke being moved by the holy Spirit. Acts
28. 25. The holy Spirit spoke by Isaiah the Prophet.

22. Now that the holy Spirit is propounded to us in all these as a person
subsisting, it does manifestly appear by this, that life, understanding, will
and power is given to him every where, together with all acts proper to a
person.

23, Also his distinction from the Father and the Son is clearly taught when
he is called, another, sent, coming, from the Father and the Son. John 14.

24. Hence, God is the object of our Faith, is every way sufficient to impart
salvation to us. For all love, grace, and the communication of those things
which pertain to living well, do flow from the Father, Son, and holy
Spirit, 2. Cor. 13. 13.

CHAPTER VI.
Of the Efficiency of God.

1. THe Efficiency of God is that, whereby he works all in all things. Ephesians.
1. 11. Who works all things. Romans 11. 36. Of him, by him, and for him are all
things.

3. That Effecting, working, or acting of God, being actively taken as they are
in God acting, not really diverse from God himself. For no composition,
ormutation of power and act can have place in the most simple, and immutable
nature of God. Yet it adds a certain relation of God to a real effect.

4. He works all in all things, because the Efficiency of all and every
thing, depends upon the first cause, not only as touching its substance, but
also, as touching all real circumstances. Isay 45. 7. That I Iehova do all
these things, Lam. 3. 37. 38. Who is he that says, and it comes to pass,
when the Lord commands it not? Out of the mouth of the most high proceeds
not evil and good?

Also whatsoever has any perfection in genere moris in matter of manners, is
accounted among the works of God: but not imperfection or defects, which are
opposed to the subjection that is due to God.

4. In the efficiency of God shines forth both his Essence and his subsistence.

5. That Efficiency which pertaines to the Essence of God, is his omnipotency.

6. The power of God being considered as simply powerful, is altogether the
same with his sufficiency, and pertaines properly to the nature of God, as it
is considered under the respect of a being, and so is before the knowledge and
will of God. Romans 11. 23. for God is able to graft them in again.

7. But power in as much as it is in execution, is in some sort after
sufficiency, and pertaines to the Efficiency of God, and so does follow the
knowledge and will of God. Psalm. 115. 3 and 135, 6. Whatsoever he pleased he
did.

8. In these therefore this order is to be conceived, That first we conceive in
God Posse, to be able, secondly Scire to know, thirdly Velle to will; Lastly,
Efficere potenter, powerfully to effect, which differs from the effectual will
of God, but only ratione, in reason, whence is that Syllogism of Faith, which
in Matthew. 8. 2, 3. is distinctly explained: Lord of thou will, thou can: I
will. Therefore it is done. Where the argument is from the will coming to the
power.

9. Hence the very Will of God, as it is an effecting principle, has a kind
of power, Romans 9. 19. Who has resisted his will; neither is executive
Omnipotency any thing else, then the effecting will of God. Psalm 33. 9. He
commanded and it was done. Revel. 4. 11. By thy will they are and were created.

10. Therefore it is an error against the nature of God, to say, that God
properly wills to do many things, which yet by his Omnipotency he does not.
Ephesians. 1. 19, 20. The exceeding greatness of his power in us that believe,
according to the working of his mighty power.

11. The Omnipotency of God is that whereby, he his able to effect all things
that he wills or can will. 2. Cor. 20. 6. In thy hand is power and strength,
and none can resist thee, Luke 1. 37. With God there is no word which cannot be
done. Phil. 3. 21. He is also able to subject all things unto himself.

12. Hence also God is everywhere called in the old Testament (...) mighty God,
Isay 9. 6. Jeremy 32. 18. Also (...) God all-sufficient. Genesis 17, 1. and 35. 11.
Ruth 1. 20. 21. And in the new Testament he is called (...) the Lord Almighty,
2. Cor. 6. 18. Rev. 1. 8. and 48. And the only (...) Potentate, 1. Tim. 6. 15.

Power is attributed to God actively, because he has power to communicate
something to others, such as is the power of the cause.

13. Potentia, vel potestas causae, A causing power yet properly active power
does not agree to God, as if in respect of himself, he were first idle, and
after did put himself forth into act: for God is a most pure Act. James 1. 17.

14. Therefore we must not imagine such an active power in God, which is a
different thing from his Essence, for the very Essence of God is this power
whereby he is powerful: As the same Essence is mercy it self, whereby he is
merciful.

15. But an active power agrees to God, in respect of the Creature, which is
properly said to be able to receive, and prove that act of God, which before it
did not feel and prove. Matthew 19. 26. All things are possible with God.

16. The Omnipotency of God is conversant about things absolutely possible,
whatsoever God wills, or can will. Ibidem.

17. It is not therefore exercised about things which are altogether (...)
impossible, and do imply a certain contradiction, either in God, or in the
things created, 2. Tim. 2. 13. He cannot deny himself.

18. Hence a certain distinction arises of Divine Omnipotency, whereby it is
distinguished into absolute power, and ordinate, or actual power.

19. Absolute power is that whereby God is able to do all things possible,
although they never shall be. Matthew. 3. 9. God can of these stones raise up
children unto Abraham, and 26. 53. Think thou that I cannot now pray my
Father, and he shall presently give me more then twelve legions of Angels?
Mark. 10. 27. Ephesians. 3. 20.

20. The ordinate power of God is that whereby he not only can do that which
he will, but also in very deed does actually do, whatsoever he will. Psalm.
115. 3. and 135. 6. Ephesians. 3. 11.

21. The manner of Gods subsistence which shines forth in his Efficiency is
first, the co-working of all persons; secondly, the distinct manner of the
persons in working.

22. Their co-working is, that whereby they do inseparably work the same
thing: for all external actions are common to all the persons, John 5. 17, 19.
My Father works, and I work. Whatsoever he does, the same likewise does the
Son. and 16. 13, 14. That spirit shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he
shall hear, he shall speak. He shall take of mine, and give it to you.

23. Hence every person works of himself, as touching the causall power
which he exercises.

24. Hence, there is no praeeminence of dignity, in that co-working, but great
unity, and identity of one, and the same cause.

25. Hence equal honor is equally due from us to all the Divine Persons.

26. The Distinct manner of working is that whereby every person does work
according to the distinct manner of his subsistence.

27. That distinct manner is partly in the order of working, partly in the
bounding of the action.

28. As touching the order, the manner of working of the Father is of himself,
by the Son and Holy Spirit. Hence the beginning of things, namely Creation is
properly attributed to the Father, who in order of beginning is the first
Person.

29. The manner of operation of the Son is from the Father by the spirit.
Hence the dispensation of things is properly attributed to him, namely
Redemption, and the constitution of all the offices in the Church. Ephesians. 4.
11. He therefore gave some to be Apostles, some Prophets, etc.

30. The manner of working of the spirit is from the Father and the Son by
himself. Hence the communication of things is attributed to the Holy Spirit,
as Regeneration, Tit. 3. 5. The communication of all spiritual gifts, 1. Cor.
12. 4. And the perfection of natural things themselves, Genesis 1. 2.

31. As touching the termination of the action that works, in which the
working, or manner of working of one person, does chiefly shine forth is
chiefly attributed to that person. So Creation is by a special application
appropriated to the Father, Redemption to the Son, and Sanctification to the
holy Ghost.

CHAPTER VII.
Of the Decree, and Counsel of God.

1. IN the powerful Efficiency of God, the Decree of God obtains the first
place: because this manner of working, being of all most perfect, does chiefly
agree to the Divine Nature.

2. The Decree of God is his determinate purpose of effecting all things by his
almighty Power, and according to his counsel, Ephesians. 1. 11. He does all things
according to the counsel of his own will.

3. In the Decree of God there appears his constancy, truth, and
faithfulness.

4. Constancy is that whereby the Decree of God remains always immutable,
Number. 23. 23. The strong God is not a man that he should ly, or the Son of man
that he should repent, Prove. 19. 21. The Counsel of the Lord it shall stand.

5. Truth is that whereby he declares that alone which he has decreed, Ierem.
13. 10. Iehova is a God of truth. Romans 3. 4. Let God be true and every man a
lia^. For although his words may seem sometime to sound another thing, yet the
sense of them does always agree with the Decree.

6. Faithfulness is that whereby he effects that which he has decreed, and as
he has decreed. Isay 46. 10. My Counsel shall stand, and I will do all my
pleasure.

7. Every Decree of God is eternal. 1 Cor. 2. 7. Acts 15. 18.

8. To this Decree of God pertains Counsel. Ephesians. 1. 11. Acts 4. 28.

9. The Counsel of God is as it were his deliberation concerning the doing of
every thing in the best manner, after that it is of the understanding and will
approved.

10. Counsel is given to God in respect of perfect judgment, whereby he does
all things advisedly I. E. willingly and of set purpose: not in respect of any
inquisition upon which such a judgment does depend us men. For God sees, and
wills all and every thing together. Therefore it is called, as it were
deliberation, not deliberation properly so called.

11. Three things concur to the perfection of this Counsel. 1. A scope or
end propounded. 2. A conceit of the mind tending toward that scope. 3. An
intention, and well pleasingnesse of the will.

12. The scope or end of this Counsel is the glory of God himself, that is,
that goodness, or perfection of God which is made manifest by his Efficiency,
and shines forth in his works, Ephesians. 1. 6. To the praise of his glorious grace.

13. In every artificer, or one that works by counsel ad extra, outwardly,
there is a platform before hand in the mind which when he is about to work he
looks into, that he may fit his work to it: so also in God seeing he works
not naturally nor rashly, nor by constraint, but with greatest perfection of
reason, such a platform is to be conceived to praeexist before in his mind, as
the exemplary cause of all things to be done. Heb. 11. 3. Those things we see
were made of things that do not appear.

14. The platform of all things is the Divine Essence, as it is understood of
God himself as imitable by the Creatures, or so as in some sort the Image of
that perfection or some footstep thereof may be expressed in the Creatures:
that is, the Creatures themselves, as they are conceived in the Mind of God,
are the platform or image of that nature which they have in themselves.

15. A platform in the mind of man, who attaines to knowledge by Analysis or
resolution is collected of things themselves: and so things are first in
themselves, then they come unto the senses of men, and then to the
understanding, where they can make some Idea to direct the following,
operation. But because God understands all things by Genesis, or composition,
and does not require knowledge by Analysis, or resolution of things, therefore
all things are first in his mind before they are in themselves.

16. In us the things themselves are the example, platform or copy, and our
knowledge is the Image: but in God the Divine knowledge is the coppy-platforme,
and the things themselves the Image, or express likeness of it.

17. An Idea in man is first imprinted and afterward expressed in the things:
but in God it is only expressing properly, not impressed, because it does not
come from any other thing.

18. From this one foundation may all errors of merits and foreseen faith be
sufficiently refuted. For if any Decree of God should depend properly upon such
foresight, then the Idea of God should come to him from something else, which
does in no wise agree with his nature.

19. The Idea or platform, as it is absolutely considered in God, is only one,
but as it includes diverse respects to the Creatures, it becomes manifold; so
that it is true, that the Idea of one Creature is not the Idea of another.

20. There are in God platformes of all perfections which are in the Creatures,
because they proceed from the active power of God: but not of imperfections, if
they be formally considered as imperfections.

21. Therefore the knowledge of evil depends upon the denying of good, as the
being of evil consists in privation of good, for every thing as it has its
being, so it is known.

22. Ideas as they are many, so some of them are Connexa knit together among
themselves, and depend one upon another: whence also a certain order arises
of former and latter.

23. Idea's as they are considered going before the Decree of Gods Will, do
represent a quiddity of things, and only a possible existence: as they are
considered after the determination of Gods Will, they represent the same thing,
as actually to come, according to their actual existence.

24. From that diverse consideration there arises distinction of Divine
knowledge into that which is called, Knowledge of simple understanding, and
knowledge of vision.

25. Knowledge of simple intelligence, is of all possible things, that is, of
all and every thing, which may be done by most perfect knowledge in God.

26. Knowledge of vision, is the knowledge of all future things, whether they
be in their own nature, necessary, or free, or contingent.

27. These things that God knows by the knowledge of simple intelligence or
mere understanding, he knows by his all sufficiency: but those things that he
knows by knowledge of vision, he knows by his Efficiency, or by the Decree of
his own will, Psalm. 33. 15. He that frames their hearts, observes all their
works. Isa. 44. 2. Who as I, foretells and declares it, or orders it to
me, from the time that I disposed the people for ever: that the things to come,
and which shall come to pass may be declared to them?

28. A middle knowledge by which God is fained of some to have known before the
Decree of his will by supposition, such events to come to pass, if such causes
were put: seeing that it does both determine events to come certainly to pass
independantly from Gods Will, and does make some knowledge of God to depend
chiefly on the object: I say such a knowledge cannot stand with the great
perfection of God.

29. The Divine Idea, according to the variety of Notions, which are in the
things, does put on diverse respects. In respect of the Principles, it is called
intelligence whereby God perceives every several thing in every thing: in
respect of truth belonging to every several thing it is called Science, which
as to the extent of it, is Omniscience: and as to that being which things have
in their proper measure, is called Praescience. In respect of the dependence of
truths which they have among themselves, it is called Sapience, whereby he
knows what is convenient for every thing, and what is disagreeable from it:
In respect of the whole order to be appointed in practice, it is called
Prudence, whereby he knows, to apply the fittest occasions to every thing:
Lastly, in respect of putting in practice, it is called Art. Whereby he knows
to effect all things most skilfully. Heb. 11. 10.

30. Those words are often used promiscuously in the Scriptures, to explain
the perfection of Divine understanding to the capacity of those, who have an
understanding very imperfect; yet of their own nature they admit this
distinction, and not another.

31. That conjecturall knowledge which only some do give to God, about
contingent things to come, does plainly repugne the nature, and perfection of
God. Of those three things which were propounded as concurring to the
perfection of Gods Counsel, namely, A scope, conceived of the mind, and
intention of will; The Third remains to be considered, which is called, Good
pleasure.



32. The Good pleasure of God is an act of Divine will, most freely and
effectually determining of all things.

33. Good pleasure indeed in Scripture does most usually set forth the good
will of God, whereby he wills, and determines a saving good unto his: yet
because all the Counsel of God is well pleasing to him, it is rightly used by
Divines to explain every Counsel of God, even according to the Scriptures.

34. This will is truly free: because whatsoever it wills, it wills it not
by necessity of nature, but by Counsel.

35. It is most free, or chiefly and absolutely free, depending upon no other,
but the freedom of the will of men and Angels by reason of that dependence
which it has on God, is less free partaking of another.

36. Freedom in those operations which are outward is not only concomitant, as
it is in inward operations; but also it is antecedent by way of a principle:
because that which God wills to work outwardly, he wills not out of
necessity of nature, but of precedent choice: for there is not a necessary
connection between the Divine Nature, and those Acts.

37. This will is Effectual: because whatsoever it wills, he effects it in
its time, neither is there any thing that is not done, if he wills it to be
done. Psalm. 115. 3. and 135. 6. Iehova does whatsoever he pleases.

38. Hence the Will of God is the first cause of things. Rev. 4. 11. By thy
will they are, and were created. But the Will of God, as it wills to work
outwardly, does not presuppose the goodness of the object, but by willing does
make the object. James 1. 18. Because he would, he begat us, Romans 9. 18. He
has mercy on whom he will.

39. Therefore there is no cause properly so called, to be given of Gods Will.

40. Hence it is rightly said, that God does will one thing to exist for
another: but not that that one thing is a proper cause whereby the Will of God
is inwardly moved to appoint that other thing. So God would that the Sun and
stars should exist, for the generation, conservation, and corruption of things
below: yet the Sun and Stars, are not a cause why God would that those things
should be generated, conserved, and corrupted. And so it is in all things out
of God, which indeed among themselves are causes and effects, even as they
depend upon the Divine will, but there is no cause of Gods Will out of it self.

41. Also the willing of one thing in God, is not properly a cause effecting
that he will another thing in himself, because the Efficiency of a cause upon
an effect, and dependence of the effect upon a cause, cannot be in the Will of
God, which is God himself, truly and simply willing all things together and at
once, with one only act; yet it is true that the Schoolmen say, that a
passive attingency of the Divine will in respect of one thing, is a cause of a
passive attingency in respect of another: and so in this sense it is truly and
piously said, that God wills some one thing, because he wills another.

42. Therefore although he wills many things which will not follow but upon
some antecedent act of the Creature, yet the very act of willing in God does
not properly depend as a consequent thing upon the act of the Creature. Neither
is it lawful under the appellation of an Antecedent will, to give unto God
that imperfect will which is called Velleitas, a woulding in the Schools. For
it does not agree to an Omniscient, Omnipotent, and infinitely, blessed Nature.

43. Wherefore that opinion which determines that God does will something
antecedently to the act of the Creature, which same thing afterward he wills
not toward them, but wills another thing, is not to be admitted: because it
makes the Will of God mutable and depending upon the act of the Creature, so
that as often as the act of the Creature is changed, so often also it is
changed.

44. By that opinion also, that form of speech prescribed in the Word of God
wherein we commit ourselves and all ours to God, as I will do this, or that,
if God will, should not be used in all things, but turned contrarily, God will
do this or that, if man will.

45. This will determines of all things, greatest, least, contingent,
necessary, free, without exception: This the Scripture shows of all kind of
things: as of Christ Jesus to be glorified, and the Church to be saved by him.
Psalm. 2. and 110. 1. and 40. 7, 8, 9. Heb. 7. 16. 21. Ephesians. 5. 25. 2 Timothy 1. 9.
Of Pharaoh. Exodus 1. 3. Where God did so dispose all things, that he might move
Pharaoh to persecute and overthrow the people of Israel; nay he hardened him,
that he might persecute them: yet Pharaoh, and Israel did work freely. In like
manner of the selling of Joseph, wherein all things happened freely, and
contingently, God determining of it according to his Will. Of the very heart of
man. Psalm. 33. 15. 1 Samuel 10. 9. 26. Prove. 21. 1. Of a man killing another by
chance. Exodus 21. 13. Of the Lot cast into the Lap. Prove. 16. 33. Of little
Sparrowes falling to the ground: Of all the hairs of a man's head. Matthew 10.
29. 30. Of the Lillies, Flowers, and Grass of the Earth, Matthew. 6. 28. 30.
Finally, of all created things. Job 38. Psalm. 104. Isay. 45. 7. Ierem. 14. 22.

46. If God should not determine of all things, his Will should not be simply
and universally the first cause: and therefore they that think the contrary,
must of necessity either make two first beginnings, or more then two, which is
very far from all truth.

47. But there is not the same reason of will as there is of Divine knowledge
and power, for knowledge knows all things that may be known, and power can do
all possible things, and they are stretched forth together beyond those things
which actually have been, are, and shall be: but by his Will he wills not all
things he can will, but all things which he judges to be willed, and therefore
actually to be hereafter: whence it is that although God may be called,
Omniscient, and Omnipotent, yet he cannot be called Omnivolent.

48. Whatsoever God wills in all these things, he is universally effectual:
so as he can in no wise be hindered, or frustrated, whereby he cannot obtain
what he wills. For if he should properly will any thing, and could not obtain
it, he should not be most perfect and blessed.

49. Yet the Will of God does not infer a necessity upon all future things, but
a certainty only as touching the event. So it could not be as to the certainty
of the event, that the bones of Christ should be broken, because God would that
they should not be broken: yet there was no necessity imposed upon the
Soldiers Spears, and other second causes which were present.

50. Nay it is so far off, that the will of God, which does most certainly
attain to whatsoever it wills, does urge all things with hard necessity,
that it is the prime root, and efficient cause of all that contingency, and
freedom, which is in things: because it does effectually foreordaine such
effects to follow of such causes.

51. In those things which God Wills there is a certain order conceived,
namely that first he Wills the end, before the means to the end, because he
works by most perfect reason: and among means, he first Wills those things
which come nearest to the end: for that which is first in order of execution,
that is last in order of intention, and so contrarily.

52. This Will of God, is, partly hidden, and partly revealed. Deuteronomy. 29. 29.

53. Those means by which this Will is revealed, are rightly called the Will
of the sign, not only metaphorically, because they declare among men what they
would have, but also metonymically, because they are either effects, or
adjuncts, partly declaring the proper Will of God.

54. There are five signs put in that old verse. Praecipit, and Prohibet,
Permittit, Consulit, Implet: He commands, and forbids, Permits,
Counsels, fulfilleth: but because counsel is all one with a command;
instead of it, it should be better to put in Promittit, He promises.

Thus far in general of Gods Efficiency, which together with his
Sufficiency, does make a fit, and adaequate object of Faith. The kinds of it do
follow.

CHAPTER VIII.
Of Creation.

1. THe Efficiency of God, is either Creation or Providence.

2. Creation is the Efficiency of God whereby he made the World of nothing, in
the beginning very good.

3. Active Creation is conceived, by the manner of a transient action, in which
there is always an Object presupposed about which the agent is exercised, yet
it is not formally, transient but only virtually; because it does not
presuppose, but make an Object.

4. Passive Creation is conceived by the manner of mutation, which is
improperly called mutation.

5. Creation respects the whole world, that is, whatsoever does exist besides
God.

6. Hence, both all things which exist besides God are created, and they are
altogether created, that is, as well according to matter, as according to
form. Rev. 4. 11. Because thou have made all things. Col. 1. 16. For by him
were made all things which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, visible and
invisible.

7. Creation does produce Originally, because it produces a being, not only as
it is a being, but also absolutely in every part.

8. Therefore before the Creation, the Creatures had no real being either of
existence, or Essence, although they had a known being from eternity in the
knowledge of God.

9. Creation then produces out of nothing, that is, out of matter that does
not praeexist, that has a being before, but co-exist, that has a being
together with the thing created: For there was nothing from eternity besides
God, neither is God the matter or part of any Creature, but only the efficient
cause.

10. Indeed somethings are said to be created, whose matter did pre-exist: but
then Creation respects not only that immediate action, whereby it comes to
pass that such things are; but also a mediate action, whereby it comes to
pass that the matter it self should exist of which they are formed: so it was
in the Creation of plants and living Creatures, Genes. 1. 20.

11. That nothing, or not being of things, did go before their being: not only
in order of nature, for so they might co-exist with God from externity: but
also in order of duration, continuance, according to our manner of conceiving.

12. Hence that beginning in which God is said to create the world, was the end
of that duration which nothing had, and the beginning of that which a the world
had.

13. Therefore God would by the Creation, both show forth his perfection, that
he did not need any Creature or outward thing; for then he had created the
world as soon as he could. And also his freedom whereby he brought forth all
things without natural necessity, for if he had created necessarily, he had
done it from eternity. Rev. 4. 11. Psalm. 115. 3.

14. The world neither was made from eternity, neither could be created from
eternity, in that disposition, and order of things, which now it has.

15. That day had not been, if infinite days ought to have gone before, for
those days going before had never been ended, that that might succeed them.

16. Hence also it follows that no Creature was, or could be a cause either
isntrumental, or principal in the act of Creation.

17. Every thing created was very good, because it was made neither rashly, nor
in vain, but unto the end which the Maker did attain unto. Genesis 1. 31.
Whatsoever he made was very good. 1 Timothy 4. 4. Whatsoever God made is good.

18. Goodness of a thing created is that perfection whereby it is fit to the
use it serves for: Now that use is particular, or universal.

19. The Particular is that proper operation to which any thing serves in its
proper nature.

20. Universal use, is the ordaining of one thing with others, for the
perfection of the Universe or whole. Psalm. 104. and 148. Esaias. 40. 13.

21. By this goodness all created things in their natural manner tend to God
from whom they came. For the second being is from the first, and for the first.
Hence those phrases. From him, through him, and for him are all things. Romans
11. 36.

22. Now natural things tend unto God. 1. In that they declare Gods Glory.
Psalm. 19. 1. 2. That they give occasion to us to know, and seek God, Romans 1.
20. Acts 17. 26. 3. In that they sustain our life, that we may live well unto
God. 1 Cor. 10. 31. 1 Timothy 4. 3. 4.

23. Time does co-exist or has a being together with all natural things, as
appears in that phrase in the beginning: for then was the beginning of time.

24. Place also does co-exist, that is, a certain space, wherein the extention
of the Creature is bounded. Genes. 1. 22.

25. But these are not properly created, but concreated, or annexed, knit to
the things created: because they have not an absolute, but only a relative
entitie or being.

26. Because God created all things of nothing, therefore our faith rests in
him against hope, under hope, for those things which are not, as if they were.
Romans 4. 17. 18.

27. The Creation of the world is distributed according to the parts of the
world: for although the world be one, by unity of aggregation, order, and end;
yet it consists of parts, distinguished not only according to the situation,
but also according to the Essence, and Existence.

28. But the Creation of these parts of the world, was not altogether and in
one moment, but it was finished by parts succeding one another, in the space of
six days.

29. Creation then is of the parts of the world, that are either immediately
perfect, or mediatly, Psalm. 33. 6. Heb. 11. 3. Genesis 2. 7. 19. 22.

30. Creation of things immediately perfect is, that whereby things were made
having their principles, both material and formal, at the first ingenerated
in them, and that in a complete existence.

31. Hence those Creatures of themselves are subject to no essential change;
as generation, or corruption.

32. The parts immediately perfect are the highest Heaven, and the Inhabitants
of it the Angels.

33. The highest Heaven, is the dewlling place of Gods holiness, full of all
things which pertain to eternal blessedness: where the Majesty of God does
present it self to be seen as it were Face to Face. 1 Cor. 2. 8. Marc. 12.
23. 1 Cor. 13. 12.

34. It is called the third Heaven, Empyreum fiery, The Heaven of Heavens, and
Paradise. 1 Kings 8. 27. Mat. 18. 10. Marc. 12. 25. 2 Cor. 12. 2. 4.

35. This Heaven is meant. Genesis 1. 1. Heb. 11. 10. 16.

36. Angels are Spirits of primary perfection, created to minister unto God.

37. That Angels were ereated appears, Col. 1. 16. Psalm. 14. 8. 5. That they
were created the first day with the highest Heaven, appears. 1. From the
likeness of nature, that they have. 2. In that they are faid to have as it
were applauded God in the Creation of other things. Job 38. 7. 3. In that they
are Spirits. Heb. 1. 14. Luc. 24. 39. Ministers of God. Heb. 1. 7. 14. Of
chief perfection, and of an immortal nature. Luke 20. 36.

38. Hence the Angels do so excel in clear seeing reason, that they are said
to be as it were, full of eyes, presently discerning what God would have done
by them, and how it is to be done: And in liberty of will, that they perform
their offices with diligence, Psalm 103. 20. And in perfection of strength,
that they are able to do great things. 2 Peter. 2. 11. And in greatest
agility, that as if they had wings, they do swiftly dispatch that which they
have in Commission. Ezech. 1. 6.

39. Their Ministry is to celebrate the Glory of God; and to execute his
commands. Psalm. 103. 20. Especially about those who shall be heirs of eternal
life. Hebr. 1. 14. Psalm 91. 11. and 34. 8.

40. They were created sound in holiness, and righteousness, Lu. 9. 26. John
8. 44. Jude 6. 2. Pet. 2. 4.

41. In number they are very many, unto ten thousand times ten thousand. Dan.
7. 10. Hebr. 12. 22. Mat. 26. 53. They are distinguished among themselves, in
respect of their Offices, and Objects, about which they are exercised. Ephe. 1.
21. And they are under the command of God and Christ only.

42. By the Creation God is known, but not God the Father, Son and Holy
Spirit, because that effecting power whereby the world was created, pertaines
to the essence of God, and not to his personal subsistence.

43. Creation of the parts of the World mediately perfect, is whereby things
were made of principles, that did exist before.

44. Hence those Creatures are subject to change and corruption.

45. Those things that were mediatly perfect have a double existence; first a
rude and incompleate, then afterward a complete, distinct, and beautified
existence.

46. The rude and incomplete existence of things was in that mass which in the
beginning was created, without form, void, and involved in darkness, which is
called Earth, Waters, the Deep.

47. It is said to be without form; not because it had no form, but because
it neither had beauty, and ornament, nor a complete act of those forms which
were afterward to proceed out of it.

48. In the constitution of the complete existence of things, two things are
chiefly to be respected; Namely, the manner, and order.

49. The manner of constitution contains four things. 1. The command of God
producing every thing: Let be, or let this or that be done: wherein the power
of God shines forth, that by his only word or will he did all things. Psalm. 33.
9. Psalm. 115. 3. 2. His approbation acknowledging the same thingh brought forth
as good, God saw that it was good. Hence the goodness of Cod shines forth,
that he produced all things to a good end and use. Psalm. 19. 2. 3. His
ordination assigning to every thing his use; Let it be to this or that end.
Hence the wisdom of God shines forth whereby he has assigned several uses to
every thing, in a most fit way. Ier. 10. 12. and 51. 15. He made the Earth by
his power, he stablished the habitable World by his wisdom, and stretched out
the Heavens by his prudence. 4. The establishing of a Law, and order,
perpetually to be observed in that thing, which is also joined with ordination.
Hence the constancy of God shines forth, that he would have all Creatures to
observe their order, not for some days, or years, but to the end of the world.

50. These former are not severally expressed in some kind of things; because
their imperfection depends upon the perfection of other things: yet in common
reason they do equally agree to all.

51. The order of constitution was thus: In the first day after the bringing
forth of the highest Heavens, the Angels, and the u^shapen Mass, the
subtilest part of that Mass being called forth upward, there was made light,
that is, shining fire.

52. On the second day, Of that part which in subtilty came nearest to the
former there was made Air.

53. On the third day, the parts of the Mass were so distributed, that the
Waters being gathered, in their cha^nels, of that part which was for the
greatest, the Sea was by it self, and the Earth appeared adorned with Herbs
and Trees.

54. On the fourth day, The Luminaries of Heaven were made, to give light upon
the Earth.

55. On the fifth day, Fishes, and Birds, that dwell in the air and water were
brought forth.

56. On the sixth day, were brought forth all Terrestrial living Creatures,
first the brutish Creatures, and then afterward man: and so the Heavens and
Earth were perfected, and all the Hosts of them.

57. In this order the wisdom, power and goodness of God does greatly shine
forth.

58. His wisdom. 1. In that the simple elements were first created before
things elementary or concrete, and compounded. 2. In that among simple things
the more perfect were made first, which come nearest to the nature of God. 3.
In that those things were first created which only have being: then those which
beside being have also life: then those that beside being and life, have also
sense: then last of all, those things which beside being, life and fence, have
also reason. 4. In that in simple things, there was a progress from things
more perfect to things less perfect, but incompound things from things less
perfect to things more perfect, from plants to men.

59. The power of God shined forth in that he first created the Plants, Herbs
and Trees, before the Sun, and Stars, which are wont to be causes in their
producing.

60. The goodness of God shined forth in that he created dwellings, before
inhabitants, food before living Creatures, those things which should be useful
for man, before man himself.

61. Man as he was the last of the Creatures, so was he the Compendium,
abridgement of all Creatures, both immedatly and mediatly perfect, partaking
the nature of the one, in his soul, and of the other in his body.

62. He was the end of the Creatures mediatly perfect, and so in Gods-intention
respected in them, and above them.

63. Hence he is said to be created in another manner then the other Creatures:
for they were brought forth by a word only: let there be light, let there be a
firmament. But man was brought forth as it were with greater counsel, and
deliberation: Let us make man. Genesis 1. 26.

64. For the body was first prepared, and afterward the soul was inspired.
Genesis 2. 7. The body of Elementary matter, but the soul was produced of no
matter being before, but immediately by the power of God.

65. The Excellency of man was placed chiefly in this, that he bore the Image
of God.

66. Three things are required to make an Image. 1. That it be like. 2. That it
be express, and framed to imitate another thing as an exemplar, or copy. 3.
That that likeness be either in its specifiall nature, or most noble
perfection.

67. Hence it is, that in the inferior Creatures the Image of God is not
properly found; but only a shadow, and footstep of it.

68. But in man the proper reason of an Image is found, yet not perfect, which
is only in the Son of God. Col. 1. 15. Hebr. 1. 3. But imperfect, not with a
privative we, but negative imperfection.

69. This Image then is a conformity of man, according to his measure, to the
highest perfection of God.

70. All this Image was natural to man, but in a different respect, for it was
partly the very nature of man, partly it flowed from the principles and
perfection of nature, and partly it was due to nature in a certain manner.

71. The Image of God in man was partly inward, partly outward. The inward, was
the perfection of body and soul.

72. The perfection of the body is that whereby it was absolutely fitted for
comeliness and use agreeable to Gods Will. Genesis 2. 25. Romans 6. 13.

73. The perfection of the soul was that whereby it was of an immortal
nature, not only in those faculties by which it was a free principle of its own
actions, in understanding and will, but also being adorned with gifts whereby
man was made able, and fit to live well, namely with wisdom, holiness, and
righteousness. Ephesians. 4. 24. Col. 3. 10.

74. The External perfection of man was his Dominion over other Creatures,
whereby he might use them freely to Gods Glory, and his own necessity, Genes.
1. 26. and 2. 19. 20.

75. Hence the tilling of the Earth, and getting of food out of the Plants of
the Earth, was committed to him. Genesis 2. 25.

76. Hence was the coming of the Creatures to him as to their Lord, and names
by him put on them, as by their Lord. Gen 2. 19.

77. Hence he was placed in the Garden of Eden as in his Palace. Genesis 2. 19.

78. In all those things joined together the perfection of man was complete:
and from that perfection, a certain Image of God, or of Divine perfection did
arise.

79. This Creation of man, was, of the Male, and Female, both of them of
nothing, as touching the soul. The body of the Male, of the Earth, mingled
with other Elements. The body of the Woman, of the Male, and for the Male, that
nothing might be wanting to his well being. 1 Cor. 11. 8. 9.

80. From the consideration of the Creation our Faith ascends above all the
order of nature, and apprehends the light of the Glory of God, to be showed
forth in the Face of Jesus Christ, because it is God, who commanded the light
to shine out of darkness. 2 Cor. 4. 6.

CHAPTER IX.
Of Providence.

1. THe Providence of God is that Efficiency whereby he provides for his
Creatures now made, in all things, according to the counsel of his own Will.

2. This Providence is extended to all things, not only common, but proper.
Psalm. 145. 15. 16. Prove. 16. 9. 33. Exodus 21. 13. Being properly determined of
no cause, but determining all causes: and hence in their manner it is the
universal and particular cause of all things.

3. The Providence of God is either immediate, whereby God by himself, as the
absolute sole cause provides for things, or mediate, whereby he provides by the
use of means.

4. God does all things that come to pass immediately, both by reason of his
power, in respect of all being, which is found in the effect, (for the power of
God attaines to every effect. Deuteronomy. 8. 3. Esaias 28. 26.) and also by reason of
the subject in respect of that being it has as it is a being: for God himself
who is always and every where present immediately and inwardly, does work that
in all things also.

5. Yet in respect of those things upon which second causes have their
influence by force of their own proper form, God is not said to work,
immediately, but mediatly, because he works by the means of subjects and
virtues of second causes:

6. God therefore uses means, not for want of power, but through the
abundance of his goodness: that namely he might communicate a certain dignity
of working to his Creatures also, and in them might make his efficiency more
perceiveable. 1 Samuel 14. 7. It Is all one to Iehova to save with many, or with
few. Hence God does often use those means, to produce the most noble effects,
which of themselves, have no aptness to bring forth such effects. 1 Cor. 1.
27. 28. Amos 5. 9. 2. Chr. 24. 24. Also he does often make the most fit means,
ineffectuall. Psalm. 33. 16. and 127. 1. 2. Hos. 4. 10.

7. Hence our Faith does not properly respect those means which God uses,
neither depends on them, but on God only, who can relieve all our necessities
either with means, or without means, as it seems good to him. Dan. 3. 17. Our
God whom we worship is able to deliver us out of the hot fiery Furnace, and out
of thy hand, O King.

8. The Providence of God is either Ordinary and usual, or Extraordinary and
unusual.

9. The ordinary providence is whereby God observes that order in things which
was appointed from the beginning. The reason of which order requires, that some
certain thing go before, and from that being put, some certain thing follow
after. Hos. 2. 22. I will hear the Heavens, and they shall hear the Earth,
and the Earth shall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oil, and they shall
hear Israel.

10. That order in natural things is the Law of nature, common to all things
or the very nature of things, as it is stablished in a certain order, arising
from the force and efficacy of that never to be revoked Word of God given in
the beginning: Let it be made, let it be, be it so, which expressing the
respect of a thing to come does signify perpetuity and constancy, and by its
virtue does effectall things which do usually come to pass of the samthings.
Ier. 31. 35. 36. The statutes of the Moon, and ofthe Stars, etc. and 33. 20.
My Covenant of the day and my Covenant of the night.

11. Extraordinary providence is that whereby God provideth for things beyond
the usual, and appointed order of them, in which manner whatsoever is
effected, is by a metonymy of the effect called a Miracle.

12. A Miracle is an operation above the order appointed whence true Miracles
do always give evidence of the omnipotency of the doer. Hence God only is the
Author of true Miracles.

13. Men may-be moral causes of Miracles, as they obtain this of God that he
would do them, or as God uses their help as a sign, or token of a Miracle to
be done by him, yet they cannot be causes really efficient, nor indeed,
isntrumental, much less principal.

14. The Providence of God is either conservation or gubernation.

15. Conservation is that whereby God makes all things, both universal, and
singular, both in their Essence and existence, and in their strength, to
persist, and continue. Psalm. 104. 19. 20. Acts 17. 28. Heb. 1. 3. Which is of
Schoolmen, not unfitly called Manutenentia Dei, Gods holding in his hand,
because by it God does sustain all things as with his Hand.

16. This conservation does necessarily come between Creation, and government
of things created: because whatsoever is created, is created to some end, and
use, to which also it ought to be directed and governed: but it cannot attain
that end, nor be directed to it, unless it be continued and conserved in its
being.

17. Gods conservation is necessary for the Creature because the Creature does
every way depend upon the Creator, not only as touching its Fieri. i. being to
be made, but also touching its Esse, existere, permanere, and operari. i.
Being, Existence, Continuance, and operation: so that every Creature should
return into that nothing whereof it was made, if God should not uphold it, and
the very cessation of Divine conservation, would without any other operation
presently reduce every Creature into nothing. Psalm 104. 29. If thou hidest
thy Face, they are troubled, if thou take away their breath they die, and
return to their dust.

18. Some things are conserved immediately, namely such as are subjected unto
God only. This conservation is in very deed the same with Creation, differing
only in reason, in that Creation includes a certain newnes which conservation
excludes, and Creation excludes a precedent existence which conservation
includes, so that that conservation is nothing else then as it were a continued
Creation, and therefore it is joined with Creation. Neh. 9: 6. Thou have made,
and thou preservest all these things.

19. Gubernation is that whereby God directs and leads all his Creatures to
their proper ends. Psalm. 29. 10. Iehova sits King for ever.

20. The government of all things ought to be of God. For they would never
certainly attain the end to which they were created, unless they were
governed by the same power, by which they were created: and it proceeds from
imperfection, when he leaves the work that he has made, to be directed by
another afterward.

21. This Gubernation includes intrinsecally, not only means convenient and
fitting to the end, but also their certain efficacy, or the attainment it
self. The order therefore of this government is certain, immovable, and
indissoluble, so that the Creature cannot wholly withdraw it self from all
order of government, although it may decline from its particular order. Genesis
50. 20.

22. This government is common or special.

23. Common is that whereby God does govern all things in a like manner, unto
this government belongs, First, The Law of nature common to all things, which
is a certain participation of the Law, and Will of God, put into all things
from the beginning. Job 38. 12. Have thou commanded the morning, and made known
to the dayspring his place, etc. Secondly, a natural inclination, which is a
principle of working according to that law, Job 5. 7. The sparks fly upward.
Thirdly, a natural instinct: which is a peculiar stirring up of the living
Creatures, to some more noble acts, with a certain show and print of reason.
Pro. 6. 6. Go to the Pismire, O sluggard, behold her ways and be wise. And
30. 24. These four are small upon the Earth, but they are exceeding wise, the
Ants, the Mise, the Locusts, the Spiders, Ierem. 8. 7. The storke, the Turtle,
the Crane, and Swallow observe the times of their coming. Fourthly, A certain
obedientiall power, whereby all Creatures are apt to obey the command of God.
Psa. 103. 21. and 148. 8. Doing his pleasure, fulfilling his Word.

24. This government shines forth in the operation of all things, first in that
they always look to some certain end, and so it is necessary that they be
acted and governed by an intelligence every where present, and omnipotent, that
is, of God himself. Job 38. 27. In sending down rain to satisfy the wast
place, and bringing forth the bud of the tender Herb, Isay 55. 10. The rain
causes that the Earth bring forth feed to the sower, and bread for him that
eats. Secondly, In that the works of nature are ordained so accurately, and
agreeable to reason, that they cannot but proceed from highest reason. Prove.
30. 25, 26, 27. 28. Thirdly, in that besides a proper ordination whereby every
thing seeks his own perfection, they do keep as it were a common society and
all do more desire the conservation of the whole then of themselves, as it is
to be seen in heavy things which are carried upward to avoid an emptiness.

25. By force of this Gubernation all second causes, are in a certain manner
determined before, that is, First, they are stirred up, to work, by an
influence, or previous motion, in regard that (beside the communicating of
strength, and sustentation of the same) there is some such thing required
necessarily to bring forth that into act which before was in the power of the
Creature. Secondly, they are applied to a certain object, about which they are
exercised in working. Ezech. 21, 21, 22: etc. 2. Sam. 16. 10. Also by force of
the same government they are ordered, that is, 1. Limits, and bounds are set to
their actions: Job 1. 12. and 2, 6. and 38, 10, 2. Some good is drawn out of
their action, Genesis 50. 20.

26. Because the exercise of that strength which is in the Creatures depends
upon the Will of God; hence it is that we trust in God alone, and not in those
Creatures, by which the kindness of God is derived to us.

CHAPTER X.
Of special Gubernation about intelligent Creatures.

In the former disputation common Gubernation was handled: now follows
special Gubernation.

1. Special Gubernation is that whereby God does govern reasonable Creatures
in a special manner.

2. The special condition of those Creatures does cause the difference. For
seeing they are in some sort immortal, and created after the Image of God, and
have an inward principle of their own actions proceeding from counsel,
therefore they are to be governed to an eternal state of happiness or
unhappiness, and that agreeably to counsel, and freedom.

3. Yet this special Gubernation does not conclude that real Gubernation of
the reasonable Creature, which is common to all Creatures, but is added to it.

4. This moral government consists in teaching, and fulfilling according to
that that before he has taught Micah. 6. 8. He has showed thee O man what is
good Deus. 30, 15. Life and good: Death and Evil. Hither to properly
pertains that revealed Will of God whichis the rule of doing as touching
manners, to the reasonable Creature. God governes by teaching, partly in making
a Law, partly in establishing it.

6. A Law is made by commanding, and forbidding.

7. A Law is established by promising, and threatening.

8. God governes by fulfilling, when he performs those things he has taught.
Ierem. 32. 19. Thine eyes being open do look unto all the ways of men, that
thou may give to every one according to his ways, and according to the
fruit of his doings.

9. From this special and proper way of governing reasonable Creatures, there
arises that covenant, which is between God and them. For this covenant is as
it were a certain transaction of God with the Creature, whereby God
commands, promises, threatens, fulfilleth, and the Creature does tie it
self in obedience to God thus covenanting. Deuteronomy. 26. 16, 17, 18, 19. This day
Iehova thy God commands thee. etc. Thou have avouched this day the Lord to be
thy God, etc. Jehovah has avouched thee this day, etc. To make thee high, etc.
And that thou may be an holy people, etc.

10. Now because this way of entering into covenant is not between those that
are equal, but between Lord and servant. Therefore it portaines to government,
whence also it is most properly called not the covenant of man, but of God, who
is the author, and chief Executor of it. Deuteronomy. 8. 17. 18. That he may perform
his covenant.

11. By virtue of this covenant the moral works of the intelligent Creature,
whilst he is in the way, have always a respect, either to happiness as a
reward, of to unhappiness as a punishment: but in the last there is meriting,
but in the other not.

12. Hence the proper and highest difference of a good work and sin does
flow, namely in that a good work is an operation expecting happiness of
another by way of reward: as by the opposite privation of it, evil works are
made in their kind extremely evil.

13. Hence arises the force and reason of conscience, which is the judgment
of an intelligent Creature of it self, as he is subjected to God.

14. Special government of the reasonable Creature is of Angels and men.

15. Special government of Angels, is either a special prescription, or
ordering the event that follows upon it.

16. This was the same Law as touching the substance, with the moral Law which
is contained in the Decalogue.

17. Yet those in the Decalogue are to be excepted which either pertain to the
nature of man's body, or the condition of this mortal life, which take no place
in them, as many things of propagation pertaining to the seventh precept.
Matthew. 22. 30. Also many things pertaining to the fifth precept, of subjection
of inferiors of their superiors, in like sort some things belonging to the
eighth precept of every ones getting of food in his vocation: finally many
duties of the second and fourth Commandment to be performed to men.

18. The ordering of the event, was in some, a preservation to persist in
obedience. Hence it is that they were confirmed in good, and endowed with full
happiness, so that they do immutably cleave to God, with perfect obedience,
and fulness of glory. Whence those Angels are called elected. 1. Tim. 5. 21.
Good and holy, Luc. 9. 26. Blessed also, and Angels of light. 2. Cor. 11. 14.

19. In others, the ordering of the event was a permission, whence it is that
they abusing their liberty did fall into Apostasy.

20. Hence it is that from that time they were obstinate, in evil, and
condemned to extreme misery. Iud. 6. 2. Pet. 2. 4. Whence the evil Angels,
are called impure spirits, and angels of darkness. Luke 8. 2. and 9. 42:

21. In that different ordering, there does manifestly appear the election of
some Angels, and reprobation of others, by Gods free counsel, and good
pleasure.

22. Touching the time of the fall of Angels, it does only appear, that it was
before Adams fall.

23. Touching the kind of their sin which was first committed by them, it is
most like that it was pride.

24. Touching their punishment the Scripture witnesses that it is not yet
inflicted in the highest degree, but to be inflicted in the end of the world.
Matthew. 25; 41. 1. Cor. 6. 3. Thus much of the government of Angels.
The government of Man follows.


25. In the special government of men, Two things are to be observed, as in
the government of Angels, namely prescribing a Law, and ordering the event
that would thence follow. Yet there is not the same reason of all on either
side.

26. In prescribing a Law there is like reason. 1. In that the Law prescribed
to Men and Angels, was the same as touching the Essence of it: namely moral,
the sum whereof is in the Decalogue. 2. In that that it was written in the
heart by way of habit, wherein the first reason of conscience is placed, which
is called Syn^ercsis. Romans 2, 15.

27. But the similitude, and difference is diverse. For, First, The principles
indeed of this Law are common to Angels and Men, but many secundary
conclusions are only proper to men: as of Parents, marriage, meats, and the like.

28. Secondly, seeing man is of a more imperfect nature then Angels, and so
needs more instruction and exercise: therefore there was added to the Law of
nature a certain positive thing, otherwise of the same reason with it: as the
sanctifying of the seventh day.

29. Thirdly, because Man in this animal life does understand by senses, and
so is as it were led by the hand from sensible things to intelligible and
spiritual, therefore unto that spiritual Law there were added unto Man
outward Symboles; and Sacraments, to illustrate, and confirm it. And in these
Symboles, there was contained, both a certain special, and positive Law, and
a prosession of general obedience to the Law of nature before put into him and
also a confirmation of that solemn sanction of the Law, which did consist of
promises, and threatenings.

30. Fourthly, because Adam was the beginning of mankind, out of whom all Men
were to be derived, therefore a Law is given to him not only as one private
person, as was done in the Angels, but also as a public person, or the head
of man's nature, from whom all good and evil was to be derived to his
posterity. Acts 17. ^6. Romans 5, 18, 19. 1. Cor. 15. 21. 22.

31. Fifthly, in the sanction of this Law, there was contained a promise, of
continuing animal life, and of exalting it afterward to spiritual, as also a
threatening of bodily death which had no place in the Angels.

32. This interpretation being had, the Law and covenant of God with man in the
Creation was, Do this, and thou shall live: If thou do it not, thou shall dye
the death. In which words there is first contained a precept, Do this. 2. a
promise joined to it. If thou do it, thou shall live, 3. A like threatening. If
thou do it not, thou shall dye the death.

33. Unto this covenant there were two Symboles, or Sacraments adjoined, In one
of which the reward due to Obedience was sealed by a Tree, namely of life, and
in the other the punishment of disobedience was sealed by a Tree, namely of
knowledge of good and evil: that was a Sacrament of life, this a Sacrament of
death.

CHAPTER XI.
Of Man's Apostasy, or Fall.

In the former dispute, we have treated of the first parc of the special
government of Men, which consists in prescribing a Law: the other part
follows, in ordering the Event.

1. IN ordering the Event, as to Man, there are tw^ things to be considered
(...), and (...) Man's fall, and his restoring. Romans 5. 19. 1. Cor. 15. 21.

2. In the Angels there was preservation of some, and Apostasy of others, but
no (...) restoring of those that did Apostate. But in Man there could not be
both preservation and apostasy, together: because all men were created in one
Adam as in the beginning, root, and head: but in one and the same Adam, some
men could not be preserved from the Fall and others Fall.

3. In the Angels there was no (...) or Restoring. First, Because they Fell
from the highest top of excellency: Secondly, because in the Fall of Angels,
all the Angelical nature did not perish, but by the sin of the first Man all
mankind did perish.

4. The Apostasy of Man is his Fall from obedience due to God, or transgression
of the Law prescribed by God.

5. In this Fall two things are to be considered. 1. The committing of the
transgression. 2. The propagation of it.

6. The committing of the transgression was accomplished in the eating of the
forbidden Fruit, which was called the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil:
but the first motion or degree of this disobedience, did necessarily go before
that outward act of eating, so that it may be truly said that Man was a sinner,
before he had finished that outward act of eating. Wence it is that the very
desire which Eve was carried toward the forbidden Fruit, does seem to be noted,
as some degree of her sin. Genesis 3. 6. When the Woman saw, that the Fruit of the
Tree was good for Meat, and most delightful to the Eyes, and the Fruit of the
Tree to be desired to get knowledge, she took and eat.

7. Therefore the first degree and motion of this disobedience, was an
inordinate desire of some excellency, by the lifting up of the mind: which that
she might attain, the forbidding of God being laid aside, through unbelief,
she would make trial, whether the forbidden Fruit had some power to confer
such an excellency.

8. Hence was the grievousnesse of this sin, which did not only contain pride,
ingratitude, and unbelief: but also by violating of that most solemn
Sacrament, did make show of, as it were a general profession of disobedience,
and contempt of the whole covenant. All which also were so much the more foul
by how much the condition of the sinner was more perfect.

9. In the committing of this transgression two things are to be considered,
the causes; and consequents of it.

10. Causes were one principal. And others adjuvant.

11. The principal cause was man himself, by the abuse of his free will.
Eccles. 7. 29. For he had received that righteousness, and grace by which he
might have persisted in obedience if he would. That righteousness and grace
was not taken from him before he had sinned, although that strengthening and
confirming grace by which the act of sinning should have been actually
hindered, and the contrary act of obedience brought forth was not granted unto
him, and that by the certain, wise, and just counsel of God. God therefore
was in no wise the cause of his Fall: neither did he lay upon man a necessity
of falling, but man of his own accord, did freely Fall from God.

12. The adjuvant causes were the Devil, and the Woman.

13. The first sin of the Devil was pride: From pride did presently follow
envy toward God, and Gods Image in Man; For because he had lost an orderly
Excellency by affecting one out of order, therefore the Excellency of others
grieved him, and he was maliciously bent to oppose it. But the Devil was not
the compelling cause, neither the cause of sufficient direct necessary or
certain efficacy in procuring that sin: but only the counselling and
persuading cause, by tempting, whence also it is that he has the name of the
tempter. Mat. 4. 3.

14. The tempting of the Devil is a fallacy, or sophistical argumentation:
whereby under a show of that which is true, and good, he labors to seduce to
that which is false: and induce to that which is evil.

15. In this tentation, the good which he propounded, and as it were promised,
was showed to be as it were the greatest: the way to be used to attain that
good, was propounded to be as it were easy, and light: that greatest evil
which did hang over his head, was hidden from him.

16. The Devil is wont to go the like way in all his tentations, which he
does ensnare mankind with; yet in this tentation a certain special cunning is
to be observed which contains many crafts and those very subtle.

17. The first of them was in that he chose a Serpent for his instrument which
had a certain natural aptness, which the Devil knew how to abuse.

18. The second slight was in that he dealt with the Woman 1. Tim. 1. 13.
Whether in the presence, or absence of her husband the Scripture is silent.

19. The third slight was in that he determined nothing at the first speech:
but only propounded a certain question to the Woman, as if he were ignorant of
those matters? Has God indeed said?

20 The fourth was that his question had much ambiguity in it, for so might be
understood that he should not ask of Gods command, but of the sense or meaning
of that command, peradventure not sufficiently understood by man, If the
question be understood of the command it self, then he might seem to have
asked whether God had forbidden them, that they should not at all eat of the
fruit of any Tree, or as the Woman her self answered whether he had forbidden
them the use of that one Tree, and so had not simply given them leave for all.

21. The fifth was that having first called the command of God into doubt by
that question, he did so artifically extenuat the sanction of it, or
communication adjoined in the conceit of the Woman now wavering, that she
should deny either the truth, or at least the necessity of it.

22. The sixth was that after he had weakened the Commandment, and the sanction
of it, it does oppose a prediction quite contrary.

23. The seventh was that to confirm that prediction, he does both abuse the
Name of God, and the Name which God had imposed on the Tree. Genesis 3. 5. God
knows that what day ye shall eat there of your Eyes shall be opened, and you
shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil.

24. Hence it is that the Divill is called a Serpent, a Liar, a Seducer, a
Manslayer. Revelations 12. 9. John 8. 44. Rev. 20. 10.

25. With this tempting of the Devil there was joined the tempting of God,
whereby he did so order that business, that it might thence be manifest what
was in Man. But this tempting of God was neither Evil, nor tending to Evil.

26. A third tempting did follow these: namely of Man toward God, wherein he
did in a certain manner make trial of the truth and Grace of God: namely
making trial, whether God would preserve him, although he did not cleave to
him, or whether he would certainly do what he had threatened.

27. A fourth temptation of Eve did accompany that namely toward her self,
whereby she received the tentation or suggestion of the Devil, into her self,
and applied to her self to her own ruin.

28. From that arose a fifth, whereby the Woman serving the Divill, as his
instrument did tempt Adam: and from that proceeded a sixth, whereby Adam
tempted himself, whilst he consented with a certain purpose to the Woman, and
the Devil.

29. Either all or most of these tentations are found also in every Man's sins.

30. And so that sin was consummated, as touching the Fall of Mankind in Adam,
for Adam was properly the beginning of Mankind, not Eve: Unless as she was
made for him, and with him, did make one and the same beginning. Hence it is
that we read in Scripture of a second Adam, but not of a second Eve.

CHAPTER XII.
Of the consequents of Sin.

In the Former disputation we treated of the Fall, and the causes of it: now
follow the consequents of the Fall.

1. THE consequents of Sin are. 1. Guiltiness and Filthiness, 2.
Punishment, properly and distinctly so called.

2. Guiltiness is the binding of the Sinner to undergo just punishment for
his fault. Levit. 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. He is guilty. Romans 3. 9. We have proved that
all are under Sin. And Verse. 19. All the world is guilty before God. 1. Cor.
15. 17. Ye are in your Sins.

3. Hence that distinction, of Guiltiness of the fault, and guiltiness of
punishment, as also that distinction of the Papists of remission of the
punishment, and of the fault is a distinction without a difference.

4. That guiltiness is not the form of Sin, but an affection, or a
consequent adjunct, partly separable, partly inseparable.

5. Now it follows Sin, partly by virtue of the Law of God adjudging
punishment to Sins, in which respect it has some good in it, and is of God:
and in this respect, God cannot separate that guiltiness from Sins. Yet as
it flows from Sin, and is a worthiness and deserving of punishment, it does
also partake of the nature of it, and it is a vicious thing: and in this
respect it cannot be separated from Sin. This double consideration of
guiltiness is intimated, Romans 1. 32. Knowing the Law of God, that they that
do such things are worthy of death.

6. From this guiltiness there follows a conscience altogether evil: namely
accusing and condemning justly. And hence follows horror, and flying from the
presence of God, Genesis 3. 8. 20. Heb. 2. 15. Romans 8. 15.

7. Filthiness is that spiritual pollution, whereby a sinner is made
destitute of all comeliness, and honor, and becomes vile. Matthew. 15. 11. Rev.
22. 11.

8. This filthiness does immediately follow the offense of the Sin, and
remains in the Sinner, after the act of Sin is past and cease to be: it
is wont to be called the spot of Sin, Corruption, Defilement, Deformity,
Dishonesty, Nakedness, Uncleanness, a blot, and sometimes Culpa, a fault.

9. From this filthiness there follows; First, A turning away from God, Esaias
1. 15. Which is also called abomination, and detestation, Prove. 1. 32.
Especially in respect of greater Sins. Prove. 3. 16. Ierem. 16. 18. Secondly,
the shame of a man to his confusion, Genesis 3. 7. For such a shame, is a fear
arising from the conscience of some filthiness. Romans 6. 21. What fruit had you
of those things whereof you are now ashamed?

10. Punishment is an evil inflicted upon the Sinner for his Sin.

11. It is called an evil because it is a privation of good. But it is not a
privation of an honest good, as it is honest, as sin is: but its a privation of
the good of happiness, in respect of the Sinner, who is punished.

12. It is said to be an evil inflicted, not simply contracted, because it
pertaines to rewarding and revenging Justice.

13. It is said to be inflicted for Sin, because it has always respect and
order to the desert of Sin, unto which punishment follows from the offense,
by reason of the prohibition, and from the guiltiness, by reason of the
commination.

14. Therefore punishment properly so called, has no place but in Intelligent
Creatures, in whom also Sin is found.

15. Because Sin is reduced into order by punishment, and Sin in it self is
in some measure against the goodness of God, but punishment only against the
good of the Creature: therefore Sin has more evil in it self then punishment.

16. Hence it is that the least Sin is not to be admitted, although the
greatest punishment might by that means be avoided, or the greatest good
obtained. Romans 3. 8.

17. In the ordaining of punishment diverse attributes of God do shine forth,
chiefly Holiness, Righteousness, and Mercy.

18. The holiness of God in the largest signification is that whereby he is
free and as it were separated from all imperfection. Isa. 6. 3. Rev. 4. 8. But
that holiness of God which does there properly shine forth is that whereby he
being pure from any spot of Sin, cannot communicate with any Sin. Psalm. 5.
5. Thou art not a strong God that delights in iniquity: evil shall not dwell
with thee. Hab. 1. 13. Thou art of purer Eyes then that thou may behold
Evil.

19. The revenging justice of God which here shines forth is that whereby he
inflicteth evil upon them that do evil. 2. These. 1. 6. It is just with God
to render affliction to them that afflict you.

20. This Justice as it does burn simply-against Sin is called wrath Romans 1.
18. Ephesians. 5. 6. As it does more fiercely wax hot it is called fury. Deuteronomy. 29.
20. As it does give sentence to be executed against a Sinner it is called
judgment. Romans 2. 5. As it does execute the sentence given, it is properly
called revenge. Heb. 10. 30.

21. Mercy here shining forth is that whereby be punishes Sin, less then the
condign desert of it.

22. This mercy is clemency or beneficence.

23. Clemency is that whereby he does moderate the punishments that are due,
Lam. 3. 22. It is the Lords great kindness that we are not consumed.

24. Clemency appears in patience, and long sufferance.

25. Patience is that whereby he does forbearingly suffer Sin, and spares the
Sinners. 2. Pet. 3. 9.

26. Long sufferance is that whereby he does long suspend revenge. Exo. 34. 6.

27. Beneficence is that whereby, being rich in goodness, he powers forth
many good things, even upon Sinners. Matthew. 5. 45. So much of the Guiltiness,
Filthiness, and punishment of sin in general, now follows the punishment
in special.



28. The punishment inflicted on man for Sin is death. Genesis 2. 17. Romans 5. 12.

29 This Death is a miserable privation of life.

30. By the life of man is understood, both the conjunction of the soul with
the body, and all that perfection, which was agreeable to man in that state,
whether it was actually communicated, or to be communicated upon condition.
Psalm 36. 10. With thee is the Fountain of life, in thy light we shall enjoy
light.

31. Therefore Death is not from God, as he did ordain nature, but it is from
God, as taking vengeance on Sin; and so properly from Sin, as the
meritorious and procuring cause.

32. But that Death is not a simple, and bare privation of life, but joined
with subjection to misery: and therefore is not the annihilating of the Sinner,
whereby the subject of misery being taken away, the misery it self should be
taken away.

33. A certain Image and representation of this Death was the casting out of
Paradise, in which there was contained a Symboll or Sacrament of life. Genes.
3. 22. 23. 24. Thus much of Death in general: It follows to speak of it in
special.



34. In Death, or the curse of God that does lie upon Sinners, there are two
degrees; the beginning of it, and the perfection of it: and two members; The
punisment of loss, or privative; and the punishment of sense, or positive: and
there are two kinds; Death spiritual, and corporal.

35. The beginning of spiritual Death, in matter of loss, in the defacing of
the Image of God, that is, the loss of grace, and original Justice. Romans 3.
23. They are deprived of the glory of God. Ephesians. 4. 18. Being strangers from the
Life of God.

36. By this loss of grace, man is robbed of all saving gi^ts: and so nature
is weakened, put out of order, and as it were wounded.

37. The beginning of spiritual death in matter of sense, is spiritual
bondage.

38. Spiritual bondage is a subjection to the power of darkness, or of
spiritually deadly enemies. Coloss 1. 13. Has taken us out of the power of
darkness. 2. Pet. 2. 19. Of whom a man is overcome, of the same he is brought
in bondage.

39. This bondage, is bondage of the Devil, and those that serve the Devil.

40. Bondage of the Devil, is a subjection to that power of the Devil,
whereby he effectually works in men, and in respect of them he has command
of Death Act. 26. 18. 2. Cor. 4. 4. John 12. 31. and 16. 11. 2. Tim 2. 26. Ephesians.
22.

41. Bondage of the servants of the Devil, is of the world and Sin.

42. Bondage of the world is a subjection to the entisements which are found in
the world. Phil. 3. 19. 1 John 4. 5. and 2. 15. 16.

43. Service or bondage of Sin, is that whereby a man is so captivated under
Sin, that he has no power to rise out of it. Romans 6. 16. 17. 19. 20.

44. By this bondage it comes to pass, that although freedom of will remain;
which is essential to man's nature, yet that freedom which pertaines to the
perfection of humane nature, (the property whereof was that power to exercise
acts spiritually good, and by that means acceptable) is not found in his
sinful state unless, Remote, and Dead.

45. From this beginning of spiritual Death, there follows the multiplying of
Sin in this life present.

46. Those Sins that follow, have some respect of punishment, in respect of the
first sin. Romans 1. 26.

47. But this respect of punishment is attributed to those Sins, first by
reason of the effects or consequents of them, because they further the Death of
man, and increase his misery: Secondly, they are said to be punishments in
respect of that inward suffering to which man is subjected to in sinning;
whereby also his nature is pressed down, and made more base. Thirdly, they are
said to be punishments of the former sin: because that former sin was a cause
for which man is deprived; of that righteousness, and grace, or Divine help,
by the absence whereof it comes to pass, that man runs into those sins.
Fourthly, they may be said also in a certain manner punishments of the former
sin, because that former sin was a cause disposing and preparing man to commit
the following sins, and in that respect it has brought upon man all those
Sins, and whatsoever evils, do either accompany or follow them.

CHAPTER XIII.
Of Original Sin.

In the former dispute (Thesi 45.) the multiplication of sin was given as a
consequent from the beginning of spiritual Death, which we will thus show
forth in the following Theses.

1. THe Sin that followed upon the first Fall is either Original, or Actual.

2. Original Sin, is an habitual exorbitancy, of the whole nature of man,
or it is a deviation from the Law of God.

3. Because it is the corruption of the whole man: hence it is called in the
holy Scriptures. The old man. Romans 6. 6. Ephesians. 4. 22. Col. 3. 9. The body of
Sin. Romans 6. 7. 24. A Law of the members. Romans 7. 23. And the members
themselves. Col. 3. 5. Flesh. John 3. 6. Romans 7. 5. 18. 25.

4. Hence also it is that in Scripture, a homogeneall corruption is attributed
not only generally to the whole man, but also to every part of it: as to the
understanding, Genesis 6. 5. The imagination and thoughts only evil. Romans 8. 5.
6. 7. They savor the things of the flesh. To the conscience. Tit. 1. 15. Their
mind and conscience is defiled. To the will, Genesis 8. 21. The imagination of the
heart of man is evil from his childhood. To the affections of every kind. Romans
1. 24. To uncleanness in the lusts of their hearts. Lastly, to the body and
all the members of it. Romans 6. 19. Your members servants to uncleanness, and
iniquity to commit iniquity.

5. This Sin is said to be an exorbitancy, or deviation of man, because it is
in man an habitual privation of that due conformity to the Law imposed on man
by God, wherein he ought to walk as in his way.

6. Hence it is that that original depravation is called in the Scriptures
Sin or that Sin, by a certain special appropriation. Romans 6. 12. 7. 1.
(...) Romans 7. 8. 20. The Law of Sin. 7. 23. Sin dwelling in us, inhering,
adhering and compassing us about. Romans 7. 17. 20. 7. 21. Heb. 12. 1.

7. This disorder in man, has as it were two parts. One formal, and the other
as it were material, Ier. 2. 13. My people have done two evils: they have
forsaken me, etc. That they might dig to themselves Cisternes. The description
of actual Sin does contain the picture of original, as the daughter does
contain the picture of the mother.

8. The formal part is an aversion from good. Romans 3. 12. There is none that
does good, no not one.

9. The material part is a turning and inclining to evil. Romans 7. 23. The Law
of Sin.

10. By reason of this original depravation, it comes to pass, that
although the will of man be free in the state of Sin, as touching all acts
which it does exercise, yet it is captive and servile, as touching the manner
of doing, because it is deprived of that power whereby it should will well, and
that inclination is as it were a form whereby it commes to pass that it
wills amiss, even when that thing is good about which it is exercised
inwilling. Romans 3. 12. 7. 14. 2 Cor. 3. 5. John 8. 34. 2 Pet. 2. 19. Romans 6. 16.

CHAPTER XIV.
Of Actual Sin.

1. Thus much of Original: Now follows Actual Sin.

2. Actual Sin is an exorbitancy of man's action: or a deviation of it from
the Law of God. 1 John 3. 4. It flows from original Sin, as an act from an
habit: or as the fault of the person flows from the fault of nature. In which
respect also original Sin is rightly called the fall of Sin. Fomes peccati.

3. Therefore actual Sins although they are often opposite one to another in
respect of their objects, and their special ways whereby they are carried
toward their objects: yet in respect of that beginning or foundation whence
they proceed, they are indeed tied and knit together, Ia. 2. 10. 1 Timothy 6. 9.

4. Actual Sins are diversely distinguished among themselves, First, in
respect of degree. One Sin is greater or lesser then another. Ezech. 5. 6.
and 8. She has changed my judgments more then the Gent^es themselves. and 8.
15. Thou shall see yet greater abominations then these. John 19. 11. He has
the grearer Sin: whence also punishment is greater, or lesser. Luke 12. 47.
He that knows and does not, shall be beaten with many stripes, and he that
knows not and does, shall be beaten with few stripes, Mat. 11. 22. 24.

5. But this difference of degrees depends. First, upon respect of the person
by whom it is committed. Numb. 12. 14. Whence it is, there is a difference
between Fornication, Adultery, and Incest. 2. Upon the kind and nature of the
thing, Mat. 5. 21. 22. He that is angry unadvisedly: he that calls Raca: he
that says, thou fool. 3. Upon the intending, and remitting the Act. Phil. 3.
6. As concerning, ^eale persecuting the Church, 1 Timothy 1. 13. A blasphemer, a
Persecutor, and Injurious. 4. Upon the way, and manner of committing: for it is
done either out of ignorance, infirmity, or with an high hand. Number. 15. 27. 30.
If a soul shall Sin through error, he shall offer as he Goat, but the soul
which shall commit with an high hand, shall be cut off. Psalm 19. 13. 14. 1
Cor. 6. 7. There is utterly a fault in you. 5. Upon the circumstances of place,
time, and the like. Isa. 26. 10. When favor is showed to a wicked man, he will
not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness, he does wickedly.

6. Secondly, the special difference of actual Sins is properly privative,
and does formally depend upon the difference of rectitudes, from which these
acts do decline.

7. Therefore that distribution of Sins as they are contrary to the
Commandment of God, is most proper.

8. Thirdly, actual Sin is distinguished in respect of parts: into Sin of
Omission, and Sin of Commission. For seeing there are as it were two part of
original Sin, turning from good, and a turning to evil: actual Sin that
flows from thence has a double respect, for where turning from good does most
appear, that is said to be a Sin of Omission: and where a turning to evil
does most appear, that is called a Sin of Commission.

9. Therefore a Sin of Omission is not to do that that ought to be done.
James 4. 17. He that knows to do well and does it not, to him it is Sin.
Mat. 25. 42. I was an hungry and ye gave me no meat, etc.

10. Sin of Commission, is to do that which ought not to be done.

11. Sin of Omission is most directly contrary to the command of God, and
Sin of Commission to the forbidding: in a Sin of Commission there is a
certain addition to the Law of God, and in Omission there is a certain
detractation from the Law: both which are forbidden. Deuteronomy. 4. 2. 12. 32. Rev.
22. 18. 19.

12. This distribution of Sin is not into the kinds of Sin. 1. Because,
Commission and Omission being about the same object, and under the same formal
respect, do not differ in kind, as in covetousness. 2. Because to speak
morally there is no Omission without an act going before, or accompaning it. 3.
Because Omission cannot be voluntary and free without an act, unto which act
there does always cleave a Sin of Commission.

13. Fourthly, Sin is distributed in respect of the subject, into Sin of
the heart, of the mouth, and of the work. So that it is. A word, a deed, or a
thought against the Law. Isa. 18. 13. Mat. 5. 28. 15. 19.

14. Fifthly, Sin is distributed in respect of the object. Into that Sin
which is against God, and into that which is against men. Luke 15. 18. 1 Samuel
2. 25. Yet it does not altogether in the same reason respect God and man. For
Sin as it is a transgression of the Law of God, is an offense against God
only: but yet in a material respect, as to the wrong and loss that is often
done to men by Sin, it has respect also to men.

14. Sixthly, Sin is distributed in respect of the effect. Into Sin
distroying the conscience, and not destroying. Into Sin reigning, and
mortified: into Sin pardonable, and unpardonable, which yet are not properly
belonging to this place.

16. From this multiplication of Sin there follows an increase of spiritual
death both in matter of loss, and in matter of sense.

17. In matter of loss, there is security of conscience, and stupidity; that
is a deprivation of the sense of Sin and misery.

18. This security comes from custom of sinning, and obstinacy of mind in
Sins: for Sins whether they be of Commission or Omission, being brought into
custom, and made old, through daily multiplication do beget an evil habit,
and do as it were bring an hard skin over the will and mind. Ierem. 13. 23.
Can a Blackamore change his skin, or a Leopard his spots? them may ye do good
that are accustomed to do evil. Ephesians. 4. 19. Being past feeling, they gave
themselves to lasciviousness, to commit all uncleanness with greediness.

19. In matter of sense, there is greatest terror of conscience joined with
desperation. Hebr. 10. 26. 27. Genesis 4. 13.

20. This terror arises from the greatness and multiplicity of guilt,
together with an inavoydablenesse of imminent punishment.

21. But in this beginning of spiritual death, there is a certain moderation
used by God. This moderation is internal or external.

22. The internal appears in the remainders of Gods Image, James 3. 9. Now
these remainders appear both in the understanding, and also in the will.

23. In the understanding, by those principles of truth, which direct both the
theoreticall, and practical judgment.

24. The theoricall principles, are both of true, and false, of which all men
that have any use of reason have some knowledge, Romans 1. 20. Psalm. 19. 2. 3.

25. Practical principles, are of that which is honest, and dishonest, just,
and unjust, that God is to be worshipped, that that is not to be done to
another, which one would not have done to himself.

26. This is the Law written in the hearts of all men. Romans 2. 15. They show
the effect of the Law written in their hearts.

27. From these principles there arises a certain force of natural
conscience. Romans 2. 15. Their consciences together bearing witness, and their
thoughts accusing one another, or excusing: which conscience notwithstanding
together with those principles, is corrupt, and so dead. Tit. 1. 15. Their
mind, and conscience is defiled.

28. In the will those remainders appear by a certain inclination unto good
known in that manner: which although it be vanishing, and dead, yet it is
found in all in some measure: whence also it is that at least the shadows of
virtues, are allowed and embraced of all. 2 Timothy 3. 5. Having a show of
goodlinesse.

29. Also that restrayning power pertains to the will together with the
understanding whereby excess of Sin is restrained in most, so that then
Sinners do abhor the committing of many grosser Sins. 1 Cor. 5. 1. Such
fornication which is not named among the Gentiles.

30. The outward moderation of this misery is by those external means both
politic and oeconomicke, whereby the course of Sin and misery is wont
partly to be hindered.

CHAPTER. XV.
Of Corporal Death.

Thus far of the beginning of the spiritual Death; now it follows to speak
of the beginning of bodily Death, with the consummation of both.

1. THe beginning of bodily death in matter of loss, is either inward or
outward.

2. Inward is the loss of the internal good things of the body, as of health
and long life, Deuteronomy. 28. 21. 27. 35. 1 Cor. 11. 30. Mat. 9. 2.

3. Hence is mortality, as touching the state, and nearest power to Death.

4. For this mortality is a dissolving or loosing of that band wherewith the
soul was joined with the body.

5. The outward beginning of this Death in matter of loss is the loss of
outward good things, whereby this life was either beautified or sustained.

6. Of the first kind is. 1. Loss of dominion over the Creatures. ^he which
after the Fall did put offor the greatest part that subjection toward man, to
which they were made, and became his deadly enemies unless they be brought
into order by the special providence of God, Job 5. 22. 23. Be not afraid of
the beasts of the Earth, For thou shall be in covenant with the stones of the
Field, and the beasts of the Field shall be at peace with thee. Hos. 2. 18. I
will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the Field. 2. That ignominy
which he is subject to, both living and dead. Deuteronomy. 28. 20. 37.

7. Of the latter kind is poverty, or the loss of those things which pertain
to food, raiment, and possessions. Deuteronomy. 28. 17. 18.

8. The beginning of this Death in matter of sense is also inward or outward.

9. Inward is in weariness, Genesis 3. 19. Pain, and diseases. Deuteronomy. 28. 35.

10. Outward, is in all those calamities to which the life of man it outwardly
subject. Deuteronomy. 28. 25. 48.

11. The moderation, that appeared in this corporal punishment is touching
inward, and outward things.

12. Touching inward things. In that man has yet space, and commodity of life,
granted to him by the goodness of God. Genesis 3. 6.

13. Touching outward things: in that he has certain remainders of dominion
over the Creatures. Genesis 9. 2. Let the fear of you and the dread of you be
upon all the beasts of the Earth, etc. So that although man by his sin fell
from all right which he had before, of using the Creatures to his benefi^ ye^
by grant and divine indulgence, he may use them, and in that h^ sins not, that
lie does simply use them, althoug he sin in the manner of using: because so
long as life is granted, and prolonged to him, with the same, there is together
granted the use of those things, which are necessarily required unto life, and
in a sort they are due to him.

Hence it is that although the Creatures were subject to vanity and a curse,
for the sin of man. Genesis 3. 17. 18. Romans 8. 20. 22. yet they are preserved in
that estate, that they may supply the necessities of man's life.

CHAPTER XVI.
Of the Consummation of Death.

1. THE Consummation of Death is the highest degree of the punishment
appointed, and to endure for ever. As touching the degree, it is said to be
infinite.

2. But it is infinite only in respect of the loss and privation: because it
is the loosing of an infinite good, not in respect of sense or positive
affliction; yet it may be said to be positively infinite, in respect of the
thing afflicting, but not in respect of the manner of afflicting.

3. Hence it is that there are certain degrees in this punishment, according
to the variety of degrees, which are found in sins, Luke 12, 47, 48. He shall
be beaten with many stripes: he shall beaten with few stripes.

4. As touching the continuance, this punishment is said to be eternal or
never to be ended. Marc. 9. 44. 46. 48. Where their Worm dies not, and their
fire never goes out.

5. Now it is eternal. 1. Because of the eternal abiding of the offense. 2.
Because of the unchangeablenesse of the condition which that degree of
punishment does follow. 3. Because of the want of satisfaction.

6. Hence it is that the incorruptibility of the damned is their immortality in
death, and to death.

7. The consummation of spiritual death in matter of loss, is a total and
final forsaking, whereby a man is separated wholly from the face, presence, and
favor of God. Matthew. 7. 23. Depart from me. And 25. 41. G^ ye cursed. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 9. Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction, being driven
from the Face of the Lord, and the glory of his Power.

8. Hence follows the greatest, and eternal hardening in evil, and despair
of good Luc. 16, 26.

9. The consummation of spiritual Death in matter of sense, is fullness of
bondage, whereby he is altogether delivered into the power of the Devil,
Matthew. 25. 41.

10. Hence is fullness of terrors of conscience, and fullness of sin, for the
damned do sin, and will fin for ever, although neither the same sins which
were in this life, as Theft, Murder, Adultery; nor altogether of the same
condition, with them which they committed alive. For they offend chiefly in
hatred, envy indignation, and such like affections, which the sharpness of
punishment gives occasion to. Also these sins after death, have not the same
respect of desert which they have in this life, because then there is neither
any possibility to avoid sin, neither is there place for threatening and
increase of punishment by them.

11. Hence it is that sins themselves, in the damned, have more respect of
punishment: but in those that live, they have more respect of offense.

12. Terror of conscience is as it were a worm, perpetually gnawing. Mar. 9.
44. Esaias 66. 24.

13. The Consummation of corporal Death together with spiritual, is first by
separation of the soul from the body. 1. Cor. 15. 42. 43. To which that change
of some is answerable, which is like death. 1. Cor. 15. 51. 52. 1 Thessalonians. 4.
15. 16. Secondly, by casting the soul and body into Hell, or that place which
God has prepared, for the extreme torments of sins. Rev. 21. 8.

14. Hence are pains, and greatest vexations both of soul and body. Luc. 16.
23.

15. Hence are Lamentation, Howlings, G^ashing of Teeth, and such like effects,
of greatest vexation. Luc. 13. 28.

16. But of the place of Hell, and manner of torture, and nature of outward
things which pertain thereunto, because they are not necessary for us to know,
the Scripture has not pronounced any thing distinctly of them.

CHAPTER XVII.
Of the Propagation of Sin.

Thus much of the transgression. Now it follows to treat of the propagation of
it.

1. THis propagation, is that whereby the whole posterity of man, decending
from Adam, in a natural manner, is made partaker of the same condition with
him. Job 14. 5. Psalm. 51. 7 Romans 5. 44. Ephesians. 2. 3. This is come to pass by
Gods just ordination. The equity whereof appears in some measure among men.
1. In natural right, whereby inbred qualities are derived from that which
begets, to that which is begotten. 2. In hereditary right, whereby the
burdens of parents are transferd upon their children. 3. In the right of like
for like whereby the rejection of good, and suffering of evil are equally
extended.

2. This propagation of Sin consists of two parts. Namely, Imputation and
real communication.

3. By imputation, the same singular act of disobedience, which was Adams, is
also become ours.

4. By real communication the same singular sin is not derived to us, but the
same in kind, or of the same reason and nature.

5. Original sin, seeing it is formally a privation of original
righteousness, and this privation does follow the first sin as a punishment,
hence it has the respect of a punishment in order of nature, before it has
the respect of a sin. As by the Justice of God that original righteousness
is denied, so far forth it is a punishment: As it ought to be in us, and yet
through man's fault in wanting, so far forth it is a sin.

6. Therefore this privation is derived from Adam by way of desert, as it is a
punishment; and by way of a real efficient, as it has the respect of a sin
joined to it, for in that that any is borne a son of Adam, he is made worthy to
be endowed with righteousness: when therefore he ought to have it, and has it
not, that want to him is sin.

7. Together with this privation, there is also derived, an unaptnes, and a
certain perverseness of all the bodily faculties, which in their manner are
opposite to that rectitude, that is approved of God.

8. For upon the deprivation of righteousness whereby all the faculties were
to be directed, there follows in them all, such a defect, whereby it comes to
pass, that when they are carried to any moral thing; that very inclination is
morally evil.

9. Of these arises every actual Sin: for the mind being blind by the
privation of light dotheasily admit any errors: And the will being now turned
from God, does burn with love of it self, and evil desires without God.

10. From Sin thus propagated, there follows also, a propagation of death,
both begun and consummate: as well touching sense as touching loss, as well
corporal as spiritual, to all the posterity of Adam.

11. Through this apostasy of mankind, it comes to pass, that our Faith,
whereby now we believe in God, is not simply for life, but for salvation. For
it is not sufficient for man being fallen, that God do simply give him life,
but it is also required, that he would give it man being dead in Sin, Ephesians. 2.
1. And this was one difference between the question of the rich young man.
Matthew. 19. 16. What good shall I do that I may have eternal life? and that of
the Iaylor, Acts 16. 30. What must I do to be saved?

CHAPTER XVIII.
Of the Person of Christ, the Mediator.

After the Fall of Man: it follows that we see his restoring.

1. THe restoring of man is the lifting him up from an estate of sin and
death, unto an estate of grace, and life.

2. The cause of this restoring was the merciful purpose of God. Ephesians. 1. 9.
According to his free good will which he had purposed in himself. For there
was nothing in man, which could confer any force to procure this restoring: but
rather much which made to the contrary, as sin, in which there was an enmity
against God: which in that respect does commend this love of God toward us.
Romans 5. 8. But God commends his love toward us, in that when we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us.

3. There are two parts of this restoring: Redemption, and the application
thereof. That is as it were the first act of this restoring: this as it were
the second act. That is as it were the matter, this as it were the form of our
salvation. That is as it were the Sufficiency, this the very Efficiency.

4. These parts are altogether of one and the same latitude. For the end of
redemption is the application of it: and the prime reason, rule, and measure of
application is that same gracious Will of God which was the cause of Redemption
it self. Ephesians. 1. 9. 10. He has made known to us, the mystery of his will,
according to his free good will, which he had foreordained in himself, that in
the full dispensation of those times before ordained, he might summarily gather
together all things in Christ.

5. Therefore Redemption is appointed to all and every one, for whom it was in
Gods intendment obtained: according to that of Christ. John 6. 37. Whatsoever
the Father gives me shall come unto me.

6. Redemption is the bringing of man into freedom, from the bondage of sin,
and the devil, by the payment of an equal price. 1. Pet. 1. 18. Ye know that
ye were not redeemed by corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with
precious blood. 1. Cor. 6. 20. Ye are bought with a price, and 7. 23. Ye are
bought with a price.

7. For this freedom was not primarily effected by power, nor by prayers,
(although these also had their force in perfecting this business,) but by the
payment of a just price.

8. This price seeing it could not be paid by man, the help of a Mediator was
necessary, who should come between God and man, making a perfect
reconciliation between them. 1. Tim. 2. 5. Acts 20. 28. The Church of God
which he has purchased by his own blood. 1. Tim. 2. 6. The man Christ Jesus,
who gave himself a price of our redemption.

9. Now such a Mediator is not given, for one age only but for yesterday, to
day and for ever. Hebr. 13. 8. Jesus Christ yesterday, to day and is the same
for ever: Revel. 13. 8. The Lamb slain from the foundation of the World.
Although he was only manifest in the fullness of time. Col. 1. 27. Tit. 1. 2.
1. Pet. 1. 20. For this Meditation was equally necessary in all ages: Also is
was sufficient, and effectual from the beginning, by virtue of Gods decree,
promise, and acce^tation.

10. This M^iator is only Jesus Christ. Acts 4. 12. Neither is there salvation
in any other, for among men there is given no other name under Heaven, by which
we must be saved.

11. In Christ two things are to be considered. 1. The fitness which he had to
perform the work of redemption. 2. The parts of the redemption it self.

12. His fitness consists of two parts. The first is his person: the second is
the office, imposed upon his person.

13. In the person of Christ the Mediator two things are to be observed: the
distinction; of the two natures, and the personal union of them.

14. The distinct natures are: the Divine nature, as it is the second person of
the Deity, and the humane, in all things like to our natures (excepting sin,
and the manner of subsisting) Matt. 1. 23. Emanuel, God with us, John 1. 14.
That word was made flesh, etc. The distinction it self between those two
natures remains: because they remain absolutely the same which they were
before, as well touching their essence as all their essential properties:
Hence neither the Deity in Christ with the humanity, nor the humanity with the
deity is either changed, or mingled, or any way confounded.

15. The personal union, is that whereby the second person of the deity did
take the humane nature, that it might inseparably subsist in the same person
John 1. 14.

16. For the second person of the deity although it have but one subsistence,
yet i^ has a twofold way of subsisting: one in the Divine nature from
eternity; another in the humane nature after the incarnation. Romans 9. 5. Of
whom is Christ, as touching the flesh, who is above all, God blessed f^r ever,
Amen. Which latter way of subsisting does agree to the Son of God. In respect
of the union which he has with the humane nature.

17. This union to the divine person and nature, does ad nothing, but a
certain relation: but in the humane nature it makes a change, whilst by this
means it is elevated to highest perfection: for it is made as it we a proper
adjunct of the Divine person by which it is assumed: as it were a member of the
same whole God man. (...), whereof the divine nature is as it were another
part: as touching the subsistence, it is made as it were an effect singularly
upheld by the Divine nature: and also it is made as it were a subject wherein
the Divine nature does especially dwell. Coloss. 2. 9.

18. We endeavor to describe this union; by many logical ways: because it
cannot sufficiently be explained by any one.

19. We use all those terms wherein the fountains, of consent, and unity are
contained, that we may show the union to be most near.

20. Yet we temper these terms with that limitation, as it were, because this
union is mystical, and secret, so it may not be plainly expressed, but only
shadowed forth by humane words, and notions.

21. From this union there follows a personal communication of properties
which is not a real transfusion. For then the Divine nature should take the
properties of the humane, and the humane should take the properties of the
Divine, and so the humane should be the Divine, and the Divine, the humane, or
as well the Divine, as humane should cease to be. Neither it is a real
donation from which should follow, that the humane nature might use the Divine
properties as its own restruments. But it is a Communion, or co^curring unto
the same operations; so that they are performed together by each nature, but
according to their own distinct properties.

22. Hence it comes to pass that all the doings a^ sufferings of Christ are
referred properly to his person as the proper Terminum bound of them: althou^
some are properly to be referred to the one, some to the other nature, as to
their beginning, and proper respects.

23. And hence follows the Communication of these properties, as touching
predi^ation, or attribution, whereby the properties of the one nature are
attributed either to the whole person, as when Christ is said to be dead which
is proper to the humane nature, and to have been in the beginning which is
proper to the Divine nature: Or to the other nature, because of the person, as
when ^od is said to be taken up into glory: 1. Tim. 2. 16. ^o be crueified, 1.
Cor. 2. 8. Which do not properly agree to the Divine nature, but to the
huma^e. And those things which are proper to the whole person, are properly
attributed to either nature: as when the man Christ is said to be the Mediator
betwixt God and man. 1. Tim. 2. 5. Which does not agree to Christ as he is
man, but as he is God and man.

24. But as that Commu^ion does properly respect the person of Christ, not the
natures considered in themselves, so that communication which consists in
predication does respect God, or man in the concrete, not the Deity, or
humanity in the abstract.

25. Therefore the communication of properties is not merely verba^l, neither
yet is it so real that the property of one nature does pa^se in the other as
touching the intri^secall possession and us^pation.

26. Those examples which are wont to be brought of those that think the
contrary of that communication which is between the matter and the form,
between the soul and the body, and between Iron and the fire, do neither
agree to this mystery, nor prove the possition it self

27. There were in Christ two understandings* one Divine, whereby he knew all
things, John 21. 17. And the other humane, whereby he knew not some things as
yet. Mar^ 13. 32. Also there were two wills, one divine Luke 5. 13. And the
other humane, together also with a natural appetite, Mat. 26. 39. So there is
a double presence of Christ* but yet the humane presence, can neither be every
where, nor in many places at once.

28. Because God in Christ, God-man, has restored life to us, therefore our
Faith is carried toward Christ, and by Christ, toward God.

CHAPTER XIX.
Of the office of Christ.

Thus far of the Person of Christ, his office follows.

1. THE Office of Christ, is that which he undertook that he might obtain
salvation for men: 1. Tim. 1. 15. This is a sure saying, and worthy of all
acceptance: That Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners.

2. For those that deny that the proper end propounded by God and Christ in
this mystery, was the salvation of men, they deprive God and Christ of their
honor, and men of their comfort.

3. In it two things are to be considered. The calling to this office, and the
office it self. Heb. 5. 4, 6. 6. None takes this honor to himself, but he
that is called of God, as was Aaron: So also Christ, etc.

4. The calling is in action of God, especially of the Father, whereby, a
special covenant being made, he ordained his Son to this office.

5. This covenant is expressed, Isay. 53. 10. That if Christ would make
himself a sacrifice for sin, then he should see his seed, he should prolong
his days, and the delight of the Lord should prosper by him.

6. This calling therefore contains in it self. Choosing, fore-ordaining, and
sending. Isay 42. 1. Mine elect 1 Pet. 1. 20. Which was sore-knowne before the
foundation, of the World, John 3. 17. God has sent his Son into the World.
It is called in Scriptures sealing. John 6. 27. Sanctification, John 10. 36.
Anointing. Isay 61. 1. Psalm. 45. 8. Heb. 1. 9. And a giving, Ioh. 3. 16.

7. Choosing, respects the end; fore-ordaining the means; sending, the
execution it self; of mere grace, without any condition foreseen, either
inmen, or in Christ himself.

8. All things which Christ either did or suffered, even as touching all
circumstances were foredetermined. Luke 22. 22. The Son of man goes as it is
appointed. Acts 4. 28. That they might do all things whatsoever thy hand, and
thy counsel had before determined to be done.

9. But this calling was not instituted in an ordinary manner, but confirmed
with a solemn oath, to confirm the excellency and eternity of it. Psalm 110.
4. Hebr. 5. 6. and 7. 24.

10. The office it self to which Christ was called is threefold: Of a Prophet,
of a Priest, of a King.

11. This number, and order of offices, is showed: First by men's necess^ty,
greevously laboring under ignorance, alienation from God, and disability to
return to him: the first of which is healed by the Prophecy of Christ, the
second by his Priesthood, the third by his Kingdom.

12. Secondly, the order of conferring salvation does show his number also
which ought first to be unfolded then obtained, and then afterward applied; the
first of which is the part of a Prophet, the second of a Priest and the third
of a King.

13. Thirdly, the same order also appears by the solemn manner of executing
it, whereby Christ did first teach others, declaring the Will of God unto them:
then he did offer himself; and afterward he did enter into his Kingdom.

14. The prophecy of Christ is that whereby he has perfectly revealed the
whole Will of God that brings salvation: whence he is in Scripture called not
only a Prophet. Deuteronomy. 18. 15. Acts 3. 22. And a Doctor, Mat. 23. 7. The
Apostle of our profession. Hebr. 3. 1. And the Angel of the covenant. Malach.
3. 1. But also the very wisdom of God. 1 Cor. 1. 24. And the treasure of
wisdom and understanding, Col 2. 3.

15. This prophecy was in Christ as in the principal cause: in others whether
angels, or men as in his instruments, 1 Pet. 1. 11. The Prophets did search
what or what manner of time the foretelling spirit of Christ which was in them,
should decline, etc. And 3. 19. By which going to the spirits which are in
prison, he preached* It was in Christ by way of habit so that he might when he
pleased, reveal all the secrets of God. But in others by way of act, and
flas^ing or coruscation so that they could not exercise prophecy but at
certain times when he pleased, Ierem. 42. 7. After ten days came the Lord to
Jeremy.

16. That he might be such a prophet, it was necessary that he should be God,
John 1. 18. and 3. 13. And withal also that he should be man, Acts 3. 22.
Compared with Deuteronomy. 18. 15. For unless he had been God, he should neither
have perfectly understood the Will of God. 1 Cor. 2. 11. 16. Neither had he
been able to reveal it throughout all ages: unless he had been man, he could
not fittly have unfolded it in his own person unto men, Hebr. 1. 1.

17. The priesthood of Christ is that whereby he has purged by sacrifice the
sins of men, and obtained the favor of God for them. Col. 1. 20. and 22. 2
Cor. 5. 15. Romans 5. 10.

18. This priesthood was not legal, or temporary, but according to the order
of Melchisedek. Hebr. 7. 17. Not by a carnal Commandment but by the power of
an endless life. Ibid. Ver. 16. Not by an order that it weak and lame, but
stable, and perfect. Ibid. Ve. 18. and 19. Not for a time, but for ever. Ibid.
Verse 24. Finally admitting no successor or Vicar, but perpetual, and proper
to Christ, and of him that ever lives. Ibid. Verse. 24. and 25.

19. In this office Christ himself was the Priest, Sacrifice, and Altar, he
was Priest according to both natures. Hebr. 5. 6. He was a Sacrifice, most
properly according to his humane nature: whence in the Scriptures this is wont
to be attributed not only to the person of Christ, but to his body. Heb. 12.
13. 1 Pet. 2. 13 Col. 1. 22. To his blood, Col. 1. 20. And to his Soul. Isay
53. 10. Mat. 20. 28. Yet the chief force whereby this sacrifice was made
effectual did depend upon the nature of God, namely that the Son of God did
offer himself for us. Acts 20. 28. Romans 8. 3. He was the Altar properly
according to his Divine nature. Hebr. 9. 14. and 13. 10. 12. 15. For it is
belonging to the Altar to sanctify that which is offered upon it, and so it
ought to be of greater dignity then the sacrifice it self. Mat. 23. 17. But
Ghrist by his divine nature did in a certain manner sanctify himself
according to his humane nature, John 17. 19.

20. Therefore it does hence also appear, how necessary it was that Christ the
Mediator, should be both God and man: for unless he had been man, he had not
been a fit sacrifice: and unless he had been God, that sacrifice had not been
of sufficient virtue.

21. The Kingdom, of Christ is that whereby he does dispense and administer
all things with power and authority, which pertain to the salvation of man,
Psalm. 2. 6. Dan. 2. 44. Luc. 1. 36.

22. The properties of this Kingdom are. First. That it is universal. 1. In
respect of all ages, Mat. 22. 43. 44. 45. 2. In respect of all kind of men.
Dan. 7. 14. Rev. 17. 14. 3. In respect also of all Creatures, as they do in
any sort pertain to the furthering, or beautifying of men's salvation. Ephesians. 1,
21. 22.

23. Secondly, that it is over the very souls, and consciences of men, Romans
14. 17.

24. Thirdly, that it dispenses life and death eternal, Rev. 1. 18.

25. Fourthly, that it is eternal. Dan. 2. 44. and 7. 14.

26. Fifthly, that it brings greatest peace, and perfect felicity to those,
that are heirs of it Isay 9. 6. Ephesians. 2. 16. Hebr. 7. 2.

27. Hence this Kingdom in the Scriptures is every where called the Kingdom
of God, the kingdom of peace, and glory, in the places above cited: and the
Kingdom of light and glory, the Kingdom of Heaven, and the world to come,
Hebr. 2. 5.

28. And hence also it appears how necessary it was that Christ the Mediator
should be God, and man: for unless he had bin God, he could not be the
spiritual King of our souls, dispensing life and death eternal: and unless
he had been man he could not have been an head of the same kind with his body.

29. Christ in all his offices had types: In the prophetical office he h^d men
also so subordinate to h^mselfe that they also were called prophets: but his
Priesthood and kingdom do not admit such a subordination: neither was there
ever any by office a spiritual Priest or King beside Christ alone.

30. The reason of the difference is, because that the declaration of the will
of God unto men, which is the office of a Prophet may in some manner be
performed by a mere man: but purging of sins by sacrifice before God which
is the duty of a priest, and government over the souls and consciences of men,
which is the part of a King, cannot at all be done by a mere man.

31. The Kings of the nations, are not properly subordinate to Christ in their
authority, but unto God.

CHAPTER XX.
Of Satisfaction.

1. THere be two parts of redemption: the humiliation of Christ as our
Mediator, and his exaltation.

2. Humiliation is that whereby he is subject to the justice of God, to
perform all those things which were required to the redemption of man. Phil.
2. 8. Being found in shape as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient
unto death.

3. This humiliation was not properly of the Divine nature or person,
considered in it self, but of the Mediator God-man.

4. Therefore the taking of the humane nature, considered simply and in it
self is not a part of this humiliation: because it was the action of God only:
but that condition of a servant, which did accompany the taking of the Divine
nature, was the prime and proper reason of the humiliation. Yet in respect of
this condition, by a relation redounding from thence, the Divine person is
rightly said to be of no reputation. Phil. 2. 7. Because it did exist in that
form, which for a time was void of all glory and Divine Majesty: for the
Divine Majesty did suppress and hide it self throughout all that space of
humiliation; that it did not constantly exercise that dignity which did
afterward appear in the exaltation.

5. The end of this humiliation is satisfaction and merit.

6. It is called satisfaction, as it is ordered to the honor of God by a
certain recompense for the injury done to him by our sins, Romans 3. 25. Whom
God has set forth to be a reconciliation by his blood to show this
righteousness. This is showed in all those places of Scripture wherein Christ
is said to be dead for us, for that efficiency is set forth in this phraise,
which cannot be attributed to Paul, or Peter in their death, 1 Cor. 1. 13.
Which takes away condemnation, Romans 8. 34. Which finally brings with it
reconciliation to salvation, Romans 5. 10.

7. It is the same also which is signified where it is said, he was made sin
for us. 2 Cor. 5. 21. For he could no other way be made sin then either by
inward pollution, or outward reputation: but he was most of all free from
pollution: neither did the imputation of sin any other way agree to him then
that he migt for us undergo the punishment due to sin.

8. In the same respect it is said that he bore our iniquities, Isay 53. 4.
Neither does that phraise signify a bearing of patience: for by bearing he
took away the sins of the world, John 1. 29. Neither does it only declare a
power of taking away sins: for he bore our sins in his body upon the Cross. 1
Pet. 2. 24.

9. The like sorce is of that f^rme he paid the price of redemption for us.
Mat. 20. 28. For neither is there a mere delivering set forth by that phraise,
nor every means of it; because the price it self is nominated, and it is
intimated to be of the like common respect with the payment of silver or gold
for vendible merchandise. 1 Pet. 1. 18. And the application of this price it
also added. Hebr. 9. 13. 14. 15. Blood sprinkling those that are unclean. And
10. 22. Our hearts purged by sprinkling from an evil conscience. So that
Christ himself is therefore a Mediator because he has given himself a price
of redemption. 1 Timothy 2. 5. 6. And we are therefore made partaker of that
redemption, because Christ has given himself for us, Gal. 2. 20. And we
believe in him. John 1. 12. And by him in God. 1 Pet. 1. 21.

10. In the same sense also he is called an offering and sacrifice for our
sins, Ephesians. 5. 2. He gave himself for us an offering and sacrifice of a sweet
smelling favor to God. For he was so true and proper a sacrifice for sin,
that all other sacrifices which went before, were but shadows of this: and
after this is finished, it is neither needful, nor lawful to offer any other,
Hebr. 16. 12. 14.

11. But this whole mystery depends upon this, that Christ is made such a
Mediator, as that he is also a surety. Hebr. 7. 22. And the common root of
those that are to be redeemed, as Adam was of those that are created, and lost.
Romans 5. 16. 17. 18. 19. 1 Cor. 15. 22.

12. In the same humiliation of Christ there was also, merit, as it is ordered
to our benefit, or to obtain some good for us in the way of reward. This is
showed in all those places of Scripture wherein he is said by his obedience to
have procured righteousness forus. Romans 5. 19. Many are made righteous: to
procure the favor of God for us, Romans 5. 10. We have been reconciled to God by
the death of his Son: and to procure life eternal for us, Romans 6. 23. Life
eternal by Jesus Christ.

13. The merit and satisfaction of Christ differ not in the thing it self, so
as they should be sought for in sundry and different operations: but they ought
in a diverse way to be acknowledged in one and the some obedience.

14. Neither ought any part of that obedience which is found in the humiliation
of Christ, to be excluded from that dignity and use.

15. But the exaltation of Christ, although it be an essential part of his
mediation, yet it does not pertain to his merit, or satisfaction.

16. This satisfaction as touching the substance of the thing was perfect, in
rigor of justice: yet it presupposes grace, whereby Christ was called to
perform this work, and whereby it being performed, it was accepted in our
name and for our good: Lastly, whereby that is performed by covenant rewarding
which was required in this Satisfaction, John 3. 16. So God loved the world
that he gave his only begotten Son, Romans 3. 24. We are justified freely by
his grace, through the redemption made in Jesus Christ, and 5. 15. The grace of
God, and gift by grace, which is of that one man Jesus Christ.

17. Hence greatest justice, and greatest grace, are together manifested, and
work in man's redemption. Romans 5. 17. They receive abundance of grace, and the
gift of righteousness, so that all the fruit of this Satisfaction are rightly
together called the fruits and effects of the grace and mercy of God.

18. This Satisfaction had worth sufficient, and in some respect infinite:
First, from the person of him that did offer, who was God: Secondly, from the
dignity and excellency of the thing offered, for he offered himself God and
man. Thirdly, from the manner of offering, in which there was a certain divine
perfection, by reason of the personal Union.

19. For as the greatness of the injury grows from the dignity of the person
offended, because there the worth of the offended person is hurt: so the worth
of him that makes satisfaction does grow from the dignity of him that makes
Satisfaction, because here the yielding of honor is looked unto, which depends
upon the dignity of him that yields the honor.

20. Also in satisfaction, not the act only or suffering, but also the person
it self which does or suffers is voluntarily subjected to the obedience of
him to whom that honor is yielded, also the manner of workingh does always
flow from him that works with proportion:

21. Where this also is to be observed, that a substantial dignity such as was
in Christ, does more properly confer to the dignity of the work, then an
accidentary dignity, such as is in some men.

22. From this dignity of the person it comes to pass, that the satisfaction
of Christ, was sufficient as touching the substance: and superabundant as
touching certain circumstances which did not at all agree to Christ.

CHAPTER XXI.
Of the Life of Christ being humbled.

1. THe parts of Christ's humiliation are two: his Life, and Death.

2. Of his Life there are two parts: the first in his Conception and Birth: the
second after he was Borne.

3. Unto his conception there were two principles that did work together one
active, and another passive.

4. The Passive was the blessed Virgin Mary: which (...) called a passive
principle, not because she did nothing unto the bringing forth of Christ, but
because she did nothing of her self, but that she did administer that matter
of which the flesh of Christ was formed. Neither yet could she administer it
immediately fit, (for she had no pure matter) but it was made fit by a certain
supernatural preparation, and sanctification, Luc. 1. 35. Because that which
shall be borne of thee is holy, yet Christ was truly and really the Son of
Mary, and the seed of the Woman promised from the beginning. Neither are there
therefore two Son-ships in Christ really distinct, or two sons joined
together; for that temporal Sonship, whereby he is referred to his Mother,
was a respect of reason only. Indeed the humane nature of Christ had a real
relation to Mary, as to a cause, but the Sonship does no way agree to the
nature, but to the person only: yet there is that relation of the humane nature
to the person, and of Mary to that nature, that it may be truly and rightly
said, Mary was the Mother of God.

5. The active principle of this conception was not a man (whence, blessed Mary
was a Mother and Virgin together. Mat. 1. 23. Isay 7. 14.) But the holy Spirit.
Neither yet can Christ be called the Son of the holy Spirit, no not in as
much as he is man; for as he is man, neither is he of the same nature with the
holy Spirit, neither does it agree to a nature, but to a person to undergo the
respect of a Son.

6. In the first instant of this conception, Christ received according to his
humane nature, fullness of all grace, as touching the first act. John 1. 14.
Full of grace, and truth. Luc. 2. 40. He was filled with wisdom, yet so as
that it might be increased as touching the second acts, and by spreading forth
to new objects, Luke 2. 25. He grew in Wisdom.

7. Hence Christ was indeed erriched with blessedness, from the very instant
of his conception, but so as that, as travelers do, he proceeded in it,
until he came to highest exaltation.

8. In the birth of Christ there was humility of greatest poverty with an
attestation of gratest glory: that both natures, and both parts of mediation,
might be declared from the beginning.

9. All the earthly things which did belong to the birth of Christ were most
humble: But the Angels and Stars of Heaven did declare that glory wherewith
all kinds of men, Shepherds, wisemen, Herod, and the Priests with all the
people were moved, Luc. 1. 18. Mat. 2. 2. 3.

10. By reason of this birth he was according to the flesh the Son of the
Patriarchs of all the world, yet specially he was that seed of Abraham, in
whom all Nations should be blessed; and that Son of David who was to possess
a Kingdom, not of this, but of another for ever. John 18. 36. My Kingdom is
not of this world. Luc. 1. 33. And he shall reign in the house of Jacob for
ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

11. The time, place, and the like circumstances, accompanying his Birth did
make the same truth manifest.

12. After the birth of Christ was his life. Private and public.

13. He lived a private life before public, because the condition of man did
so require, to which he had subjected himself, because the Law of God had so
determined, and so also the infirmity of man did require that by degrees the
Sun of righteousness should appear unto them, and that they should be lead
as it were by the hand from every imperfect thing to that which is perfect.

14. In his private life, there was his infancy and subection to his parents.

15. In his infancy there was his. 1. Circumcision and offering. 2. His flight
unto Egypt, and returning thence.

16. Christ was circumcised and offered, because he did subject himself not
only to the eternal and moral Law, but also to the Ceremonial, and every Law
of God.

17. Those ceremonial observations, were so many confessions of sin.
Therefore Christ who was made sin for us, was fitly made conformable to them.

18. Also they were certain outward means belonging to Divine worship:
therefore Christ observed them, that he might fulfill all righteousness.

19. Lastly, they were certain types shadowing forth Christ: now that he might
fulfill those, and by this means sanctify the same, he would apply them to
himself.

20. Circumcision was the Seal of the Covenant of God.

21. Offering was a presenting and dedicating the first born unto God:
therefore Christ was fitly both circumcised and offered, because he was to
confirm that saving Covenant by his blood, and among the first borne, he was
only perfectly holy to God, of whom all others were only types.

22. His flight into Egypt, and his return thence, was, 1. That he migt show
from the beginning of his age, that he was borne to undergo misery. 2. That
according to the condition to which he had submitted himself, he might provide
for his life after the manner of men. 3. That he might withal show, that he was
the man, that should bring us out of spiritual Egypt into the promised Land.

23. In his subjection to his parents which pertains to the fifth precept of
the Decalogue, he did show that he was subject to the whole moral Law. 1.
Because there is the same reason of one precept as of all. 2. Because there is
no part of moral obedience from which Christ the Lord of Heaven and Earth
might seem to be more free, then from subjection to men.

24. Although that this legal obedience was required of Christ now made man by
right of Creation, yet because he was made man, not for himself, but for us,
it was a part of that humiliation, satisfaction and merit, which God required,
and accept of him for us.

25. In this subjection these two things are to be observed. The exception
which he did suffer, and the effect which it did bring forth.

26. The exception was the disputation which he had with the Scribes, when he
was but twelve years old.

27. This disputation was a foregoing testimony, of that public calling
whereby he was ordained and sent to be a master and teacher of Israel.

28. It was also to teach, that that knowledge and wisdom wherewith Christ
was endued, was not gotten, by progress of time, but conferred or infused of
God from the beginning.

29. The effect of this subjection was his laboring with his hands, that is,
an enduring of that curse of ours, whereby it comes to pass that we eat our
bread with that labor in the sweat of the face.

30. His public life is that whereby he openly manifested himself to be the
Messiah. In this life, there was. 1. The entrance. 2. The progress. 3. The
conclusion.

31. Unto the entrance pertaines his Baptism and Tentation.

32. The Baptism of Christ was his public inauguration to the public
performance of his office: therefore in it, the three offices of Christ are
affirmed, and confirmed.

33. They are affirmed by the testimony of the father publickely pronouncing
that Jesus Christ is his Son, and so that he appointed a king by him, even
that King in whom he is well pleased, that is, a chief Priest, who by his
intetcession should take away the sins of the World, and a chief Prophet, Mat.
3. 17. and 17. 3. This is my Son in whom I am well pleased, hear him.

34. The same offices are confirmed by signs: namely, by opening of Heaven,
descending of the holy Spirit under the bodily shape of a Dove, resting upon
Christ, and an audible voice sent down from Heaven, whereby the testimony of
the Father was signified.

35. They were also confirmed by the testimony of John, who was appointed, for
a witness, preacher and forerunner of Christ, and being certified of Christ
partly by the revelation of the Spirit, and partly by those signs before
mentioned, he did testify of him before others.

36. Moreover by the Baptism of Christ, our Baptism was confirmed, and
sanctified: and withal the person is declared to whom Baptism does so adhere,
that all the force of it is to be sought for in him.

37. Christ was tempted, that he might show that he was much stronger then the
first Adam, and that he could also overcome tentations, and also help us with
a fellow-feeling.

38. The progress of his public life was in poverty and labor.

39. The poverty of Christ was without a singular vow, and without beggary.

40. The labor of Christ was in travailing through diverse Countries, in
watchings, and in greatest intention of all his strength to do good.

41. 2. This public life of Christ was performed in preaching, and working
miracles, unto the preaching of Christ was always joined, in respect of
himself, grace and authority. In respect of others either opening, or
hardening of heart.

42. The object of h^s preaching was properly the Gospel, or Kingdom of
Heaven. Marc. 1. 14. Preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God.

43. The end of his miracles was. 1. To demonstrate the person of Christ. 2. To
confirm his doctrine. 3. To signify his spiritual operations.

44. Christ wrought miracles, in the Angels, in men, in brute Creatures, in
things without life: In Heaven, in Earth, in the Air, and in the Sea: in
things corporeal, and spiritual: that he might show, his universal and
Divine power to be of equal force in every kind of thing.

45. The conclusion of the life of Christ was in the very preparation to death.

46. His preparation to death was in his instructing his Disciples, and
conforting them.

47. This instruction and consolation was partly exercised in his
transfiguration, Luc. 9. 31. Moses and (...) appearing in glory did tell of his
departure. And by those Sacraments which look to the death of Christ by a
certain special respect, namely the passover, and supper of the Lord: partly
in example, John 13. 15. I have given you example, that as I have done to, you,
so also should ye do, partly in his last Sermon, John 14. and 15. and 16. and
partly in his prayer, John 17.

CHAPTER XXII.
Of the Death of Christ.

1. THe Death of Christ is the last act of his humiliation, whereby he did
undergo, extreme, horrible, and greatest pains for the sins of men.

2. It was an act of Christ, and not a mere suffering, because he did of
purpose dispose himself to undergo and sustain it. John 10. 11. I am that
good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, Verse
11. No man takes it from me, but I lay it down by my self: by the same
reason also it was voluntary, not compelled. And out of power, not out of
infirmity only: out of obedience to his Father, and love to us, not out of his
own guilt or desert: unto satisfaction by overcomming, not to perdition by
yielding.

3. It did contain greatest punishments: because it did equal all that misery
which the sins of men did deserve. Hence is that plenty of words and phrases,
by which this death is set forth in Scriptures. For it is not simply called a
death, but also a cutting off, a casting away, a treading under feet, a curse,
an heaping up of sorrows, and such like. Isay. 53. Psalm. 22.

4. But it did so conraine these punishments, that the continuance of them, and
holding under, and such like circumstances, which accompany the punishments of
the sins of all the damned, were removed from this death. Acts 2. 24. It could
not be that he could be held under by death. The reason is first because such
circumstances as these are not of the essence of the punishment it self: but
adjuncts following and accompanying that punishment in those who cannot so
suffer punishment, that by suffering they should satisfy. Secondly, because
there was in Christ, both worthiness, and power to overcome as it were by this
means, the punishment imposed. 1 Cor. 15. 54. 57. Death is swallowed up in
victory. Thanks be given to God who has given us victory by our Lord Jesus
Christ.

5. But because there was in this death the consummation of all humiliation,
whereof that also was the far greatest part: hence often in Scriptures by a
Synechdoche of the member, the death itself of Christ is put for all that
satisfaction which is contained in his whole humiliation.

6. These limitations being had, this death of Christ was the same in kind and
proportion with that death which in justice was due to the sins of men
representing the very same degrees, members, and kinds.

7. The beginning of the spiritual death of Christ in matter of loss, was the
loosing of that joy and delight, which the enjoyment of God, and fullness of
grace was wont to bring. But he did loose this spiritual joy, not as touching
the principle and habit of it, but as to the act and sense of it.

8. The beginning of spiritual death in matter of sense, was the tasting of
the wrath of God, and a certain subjection to the power of darkness. But that
wrath of God was most properly that Cup which was given to Christ to be Drunk.
Mat. 26. 39. My Father, if it be possible, let this Cup pass from me.

9. But the object of this anger was Christ, not absolutely, but only as
touching the punishment which is brought by this anger, which he as our surety
did undergo.

10. That subjection to the power of darkness was not to bondage, but to
vexation, which Christ did feel in his mind.

11. From these the soul of Christ was affected with sorrow, grief, fear,
and horror, in an agony. Mat. 26. 39. John 11. 27. Hebr. 5. 7. Luc. 22. 24.

12. In this manner was the soul of Christ affected not only in that part
which some call the inferior, but also in the superior part: not only nor
chiefly out of a fellow-feeling which it had with the body, put properly and
immediately: not chiefly out of compassion which it had in respect of others,
but out of a proper suffering, which it did undergo in our name. Lastly, not
out of an horror of temporal death, which many of Christ's servants also have
by his power overcome, but out of a certain sense of a supernatural and
spiritual death.

13. There were two effects of this agony. First, a vehement deprecation
showing a mind astonished and a nature flying from the bitterness of death,
yet under condition, and with subjection to his Fathers will. Mar. 14. 35. He
prayed that if it might be that hour might pass from him. John 12. 27. My
soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father keep me from this hour: but
therefore came I unto this hour. Secondly, a watery sweat having clotters of
blood mixed with it dropping down to the ground, Luc. 22. 44. Being in an
agony he prayed more earnestly. And his sweat was like drops of blood falling
down to the ground.

14. In this beginning of spiritual death there was a certain moderation, and
mitigation, that in the mean while there might be place for those duties which
were to be finished before his death, namely prayers, conferences, admonitions,
answers.

15. This moderation was inward or outward.

16. The inward was by spaces of time upon the flacking of the pressure and
vexation which he did feel in his soul. Hence in his understanding he did
attend unto the course of his office undertaken, to the gl^ry that would thence
arise to his Father, and to himself, and to the salvation of those whom his
Father had given to him. In his will also he did choose and embrace all the
miseries of death to obtain those ends.

17. The outward mitigation of this death was by an Angel who did strengthen
him in talking with him. Luc. 22. 43. And appeared to him an Angel from Heaven
comforting him.

18. There was no inward beginning of the bodily death of Christ besides that
natural mortality and weakening which the outward force did bring.

19. The external beginning was manifold, both in matter of loss, and matter
of sense.

20. In matter of loss, he was rejected of his own people, counted worse then
a murderer, forsaken of his most inward Disciples, denied, and betrayed of all
kind of men, especially of the chief ones, and those who were counted the more
wise, he was called a mad man, a deceiver, a blasphemer, one having a devil, a
great man and invader of another man's kingdom, he was stripped of his
garments, and destitute of necessary food.

21. In matter of sense there was. First, shameful apprehending. Secondly, a
violent taking away: in just judgments, both Ecclesiastical, and civil.
Fourthly, in working, whipping, and crucifying, with reproaches, and injuries of
all kinds joined with them. Yet there was some mitigation of this death. First,
by manifestation of the Divine Majesty, to the working of certain miracles: as
in casting the Soldiers down to the ground with his sight and voice, and in
healing the ear of Malchus. Secondly, by operation of the Divine providence,
whereby it came to pass, that he was justified by the Judge, before he was
condemned. Mat. 29. 24. I am innocent of the blood of this just man.

22. The consummation of the Death of Christ was in the highest degree of the
punishment appointed: where is to be considered. The death it self, and the
continuance of it.

23. The consummation of spiritual death in matter of loss, was, that
forsaking of the Father whereby he was deprived of all sense of consolation.
Mat. 27. 46. My God, my God why have thou forsaken me?

24. The consummation of the death of Christ in matter of sense was the curse,
whereby he did endure the full sense of Gods judgment upon man's sin. Gal. 3.
13. He was made a curse for us. The hanging on the Cross was not a cause and
reason of this curse, but a sign and symbol of it. Ibid.

25. The consummation of bodily death was in the breathing out of his soul
with greatest torment, and pain of the body.

26. In this death there was a separation made of the soul from the body, but
the union of both did remain with the Divine nature, so that a dissolution of
the person did not follow.

27. This death of Christ was true, not feigned: it was natural, or from
causes naturally working to bring it, not supernatural; it was voluntary, not
altogether compelled; yet it was violent, not of inward principles: It was also
in a certain manner supernatural, and miraculous, because Christ did keep
his life, and strength so long as he would, and when he would, he laid it down,
John 10. 18.

28. The continuance of this death was, in respect of the state of lowest
humiliation, not in respect of the punishment of affliction, for that which
Christ said, it is finished, is understood of those punishments.

29. The continuance was the remaining under the dominion of death by the space
of three days, Acts 2. 24. This state is wont properly to be set forth by
descending into Hell.

30. Christ being buried three days, was a witness and certain
representation of this state.

CHAPTER XXIII.
Of the Exaltation of Christ.

1. THe Exaltation of Christ is that whereby he did gloriously triumph over his
and our enemies. Luc. 24. 26. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things,
and so to enter into glory? Ephesians. 4. 8. When he ascended up on high, he led
captivity captive. Col. 2. 15. He has spoiled principalities and powers, and
has made a show of them openly, and has triumphed over them in it.

2. He overcame death by enduring it, sin by satisfying, the Devil by
spoiling him, or taking the prey out of his hands.

3. The perfection and manifestation of this victory is in his Exaltation.
Therefore although there was a virtuall triumph, and triumph of merit in his
death, and in the Cross, in which Christ is said to be exalted, or extolled.
John 3. 14. Not in situation and place only, but also in virtue and merit: yet
the actual triumph as touching the state of it, was not in his humiliation,
but his Exaltation.

4. Christ did triumph in the Cross, as in a Field of victory; but in his
Exaltation, as in the kingly seat, and Chariot of triumph.

5. The glory of this triumph was, a changing of the humble form of a servant,
and that most abject condition which in it he did undergo, into blessedness
altogether Heavenly. Phil. 2. 9. Wherefore also God did highly exalt him, and
gave him a name above every name.

6. In respect of the Divine nature, it was only an active manifestation: in
respect of the humane nature, it was a real receiving with suitable actions
flowing from it.

7. The humane nature received all those perfections, which a created nature
could take. For in the soul there flourished all kind of fullness of wisdom
and grace, not only in respect of the principle and habit, but also in respect
of the act and exercise: his body also was adozned with greatest purity,
agility, splendour, and strength. Hebr. 12. 2. For the joy that was set before
him, he endured the Cross, Phil. 3. 21. Who shall transform our vile body,
that it may be life to his glorious body.

8. But as the soul of Christ being now exalted, did still retain the nature
of a soul, so also the body glorified did in no wise lay down the essence,
and essential properties of a body: therefore it can neither be every where,
nor together in many places, nor in the same place with an other body
Penetrative. Which indeed all that have eyes to see may clearly perceive in
those phrases of Scripture. Being taken from them he was carried up into Heaven.
Luke 24. 51. He is not here, he is risen, Mat. 28. 6. And many such like.

9. There were three degrees of Exaltation opposite to as many degrees of his
extreme humiliation: namely his Resurrection from the dead being opposed to
his death; his ascending into Heaven opposed to his descending into the Grave,
and to the Lowest place of the Earth, and his sitting at the right Hand of God
opposed to his remaining in the Grave, and in the state of death or in Hell.

10. Christ's Resurrection was of his whole humane nature which before had
fallen by death. In respect of the soul it was from Hell, or from the state,
and dominion of death, to which the soul as it was a part of the humane
nature, was subject. In respect of the body, it was from the dead, and from the
Grave.

11. The soul is said improperly to have risen again: but the body and humane
nature properly. For the body, and the man, did properly recover his
perfection: but the soul did recover the act and motion of its perfection in
the body.

12. There are two parts of his Resurrection; the first is an internal act,
namely a reviving restored, by the uniting of soul and body: the second is an
external act, namely his going out of the Grave to the manifestation of life
restored.

13. Unto this Resurrection there did give testimony. 1. The Angels. 2. Christ
himself by diverse apparitions (ten whereof at least are reckoned up in the
Scriptures) and also by diverse proofs taken out of the Scriptures. 3. Men, who
were certified of it by seeing hearing, and handling him.

14. But Christ did rise not by the power or leave of another, although this
operation be attributed to God the Father, Acts 2. 24. But by his own power.
John 2. 19. Destroy this Temple, and within three days I will raise it up. And
10. 18. I have power of taking up my life again.

15. The time of Resurrection was the third Day after his Death and Burial,
Mat. 16. 2. Luke 24. 7 Acts 10. 40. 1 Cor. 15. 4.

16. The end of this Resurrection was. 1. That he might be declared to be the
Son of God, Romans 1. 4. Declared mightily to be the Son of God by the
Resurrection from the dead. 2. That he might seal a full victory of death, 1
Cor. 15. 57. Thanks be to God who has given us victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ. 3. That he might fulfill those parts of his office which did follow his
death, Romans 4. 25. He was raised again for our justification. 4. That he might
show himself both justified, and justifying others, 1 Cor. 15. 17. If Christ
be not risen, your faith is vain: ye are yet in your sins. 5. That he might
be the substance, example, and entrance of our spiritual, and corporal
Resurrection. Verse 20. 21. 23. of the same Chapter. He is made the first fruits
of them that sleep. In Christ shall all be made alive.

17. For Christ as God is the cause absolutely principal of our Resurrection:
as satisfying by his humiliation, and death, he is the meritorious cause: but
as rising from the dead he is the exemplary cause, and withal a demonstration
and an initiation.

18. The ascending of Christ into Heaven, is a middle degree, or certain
progress of exaltation, whereby leaving the Earth he ascends up into the
highest Heaven as into his throne of glory. Acts 1. 11. He is taken up from you
into Heaven, Ephesians. 4. 10. He ascended far above all Heavens.

19. This ascension was of the whole person; yet it does not agree to the
Divine nature, but figuratively, namely as it was the cause of ascending, and
was joined with the humane nature, in excellency: manifesting also his glory in
it, whereof he had as it were emptied himself, when he descended into it by
the incarnation: but it does most properly agree to the humane nature, because
it suffered change from a lower place to an higher.

20. The time of his ascension was 40 days after his Resurrection, Acts 1. 3.
not sooner: because the infirmity of the Disciples did require the delay of
this space of time, that their faith might be confirmed by diverse appearings,
and they might also be more fully instructed in those things, which pertain to
the Kingdom of God. Acts 1. 3. Not later, least he should seem to think upon
an earthly life.

21. The place from which he did ascend was mount Olivet, Acts 1. 12. Where
also he entered into deepest humiliation, Luc. 22. 39. That he might teach that
his suffering, and ascension did pertain to the same thing.

22. The place into which he ascended, was the Heaven of the blessed, and which
is not an ubiquitary Heaven, as some do imagine, so as that ascension should
only be a change of condition, and not of place, but it is the highest above
all the other Heavens, Ephesians. 4. 10. The seat, house or mansion of God. John 14.
2. So that in respect of local presence, Christ's humane nature is rightly and
truly said to be with us in Earth, Mat. 26. 11. Although he himself in respect
of his person, and that spiritual efficacy which does depend upon the humane
nature, is every where with his unto the end of the world, Mat. 28. 20.

23. The witnesses of this ascension, were both many men, and Angels. Acts 1.

24. In respect of order, he was the first of all those who ascended into
Heaven, in priority of nature: because his ascension was a cause by virtue
whereof others do ascend. Heb. 9. 8. But others had ascended in their souls
before in time, Col. 1. 20. And some also (as it is most like) in their bodies.
Genesis 5. 24. Hebr. 11. 5. 2 King^ 2. 11.

25. The cause of this ascension was the same which before was of the
Resurrection: namely the power of God, which is the same both of the Father and
the Son: hence in respect of the Father it is called an assumption which in
respect of the Son is called an ascension. Act, 1. 11. But there was added
moreover the condition of a glorified body; which is carried as well upward as
downward.

26. The ends of his ascension were. 1. That he might place his humane nature
now glorified in the mansion of glory. 2. That he might show himself to be him
who could pierce into the Heavenly and deepest counsels of God. John 3. 13. How
shall ye believe, if I tell you heavenly things? For there is none that
ascends into Heaven, but he who descends from Heaven; namely, the son of
man who is in Heaven. 3. That he might prepare mansions for all his in the
house of his Father. John 14. 3. 4. That he might in the name of his own take
possession of the heavenly Kingdom. Ephesians. 2. 6. Has raised us up together, and
has made us sit together in Heaven, in Christ Jesus. 5. That by his
intercession and power he might take care for those things which were to be
performed for their salvation. John 16. 7. If I go from you, I will send the
Comforter unto you. 6. That we may have a most certain argument of our
ascension into Heaven, 1 Cor. 15. 20. He is made the first fruits of them that
sleep. 7. That we also might in thought, affection and conversation follow
after Heavenly things. Col. 3. 1. Phil. 3. 20. Seek those things that are
above where Christ is. We carry our selves a Citizens of Heaven: from whence
also we look for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

27. Sitting at the right Hand of God is the highest degree of his Exaltation,
whereby he enjoys the highest glory of his mediation. Hence Resurrection, and
Ascension are motions tending to this sitting: hence also Resurrection and
Ascension in a certain manner common to us with Christ; but sitting at the
right hand of the Father agrees to none, but to Christ only.

28. That highest glory wherewith Christ is endowed by this sitting, is
properley and formally a kingly glory. Acts 2. 36. Let therefore all the house
of Israel know for certain, that God has made this man a Lord.

29. This Kingly glory is a fullness of power and majesty whereby he governs
all things for the good of his, Psalm. 110. 1. 1 Cor. 15. 25. For he must reign
until he have put down all his enemis, under his feet.

30. This majesty and power does properly agree to the person of Christ the
Mediator: in respect of which it is also truly said that the humane nature of
Christ has now so much eminency of dignity and ruledome, that with power he is
above, and set over all created things, Ephesians. 1. 20. But from this eminency of
dignity, to conclude that the humane nature of Christ (which was created end
remains finite) being absolutely and abstractedly considered, has the same
omnipotency, and omnipresency with God himself it is no other thing then a
certain stupid madness, and it is not far from blasphemy.

31. Unto this kingly dignity pertaines that power whereby Christ was made the
judge of all men, and Angels.

32. This kingly glory of Christ does also redound unto other of his offices,
so that he exercises a kingly Priesthood, and a kingly prophecy.

33. The kingly priesthood is, that whereby he does plead our cause, not by
suffering, and humbly supplicating as it were with bended knees, but by
representing gloriously those things which he did and suffered. Hebr. 9. 24.
Christ is entered into Heaven it self, to appear before the Face of God for us.

34. Christ does exercise a kingly prophecy: whilst he powers out his spirit
upon all flesh: whilst he sends his Ambassadors, works together with them,
and confirms their word by signs that follow: lastly whilst he gather his
own out of the world, protects, builds up, and preserves them for ever. Mat.
28. 18, 19, 20. Marc. 16. 20.

CHAPTER XXIV.
Of the application of Christ.

So much of Redemption: The application of the same Redemption follows.

1. THis application is that whereby all those things which Christ has done,
and does as Mediator, are made actually effectual in some certain Men.

2. This application by a special appropriation is attributed to the holy
Spirit, 1 Cor. 12. 13. By one spirit we are all baptized into (...) (...): yet
it does depend. 1. Upon the dceree, and donation of the Father* whereby he has
given some certain men to Christ to be redeemed, and saved. John 6. 36. This
is the will of my Father, that of that he has given me, I should lose nothing,
for all those, and only those whom the Father has given to Christ, do come to
him. Ibid. verse 37. 2. Upon the intention of Christ whereby he has determined
his satisfaction for the good of those, whom he has appointed to him by his
Father. John 17. 9. 11. 12. 19. I pray for them whom thou have given me,
because they are thine. 3. Upon the acceptance of the Father, whereby he does
accept and ratify that satisfaction for the reconciliation, and salvation of
the same persons. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Namely, that God was in Christ, reconciling the
world to himself, not imputing their sins unto them.

3. This transaction between God and Christ was a certain foregoing
application of our redemption, and deliverance to our surety, and to us in him:
which unto the finishing of that secundary application in us, has the respect
of an effectual example, so as, that is a representation of this, and this is
brought forth by virtue of that.

4. Hence our deliverance from sin and death, was not only determined in the
decree of God, but also granted, and communicated to Christ, and to us in him,
before it be perceived by us. Romans 5. 10. 11. We were reconciled to God, by the
death of his Son. By whom we have now received a reconciliation.

5. Hence both the Father and the Son are said to send the Spirit to perform
this application, John 14. 16. and 16. 7. The Father shall give you an
advocate, I will send him unto you.

6. Hence every good giving, and every perfect good is said to descend from
above from the Father. James 1. 17. And all saving things are said to be
communicated to us, in Christ, as in the head. For Christ as obtaining it by
his merit and through Christ, as effectually applying it. Ephesians. 1. 3. 5. 11.

7. Hence also application is the end and effect of impetration. But seeing the
end is intended by God the Father and Christ, it has a certain connection with
impetration as with its means. For if the redemption of Christ were of
incertaine event, then the Father should appoint the S^nne to death, and the
Son also should undergo it, being yet uncertain, whether any would be saved
by it or no; then also all the fruit of this mystery should depend upon the
free will of men.

8. Hence application is altogether of the same latitude with redemption it
self, that is, the redemption of Christ is applied to all and only those, for
whom it was obtained by the intention of Christ and the Father, yet for their
sakes the same temporal benefits of Christ do redound unto there is also.

9. And in this sense, namely in respect of the intention of application it is
rightly said: Christ did only satisfy for those that are saved by him:
although in respect of that sufficiency which is in the mediation of Christ, it
may be rightly said also, Christ satisfied for all, or every one: and because
those counsels of God are hidden to us, it is agreeable to charity, to judge
very well of every one, although we may not pronounce of all together
collectively, that Christ did equally plead their cause before God.

10. The way of application whereby God does with greatest firmness perform
that, which was contained in a covenant formerly made, and broken, is called in
the Scriptures a new covenant, Hebr. 8. 8. 10. A covenant of life, salvation,
and grace, Romans 4. 16. Gal. 3. 18. Which in the same sense also is called the
Gospel. Romans 1. 16. The good Word of God. Hebr. 6. 5. A faithful saying and
worthy of all acceptance. 1 Timothy 1. 15. A good doctrine. 1 Timothy 4. 6. The Word
of life. Phil. 2. 16. The Word of reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5. 19. The Gospel of
peace. Ephesians. 2. 17. and 6. 15. The Gospel of salvation, and the Word of truth,
Ephesians. 1. 13. The arm of God, Isay 53. 1. The savor of life to life, 2 Cor. 2.
16.

11. It is called a covenant because it is a firm promise, for in the
Scriptures every firm purpose, although it be of things without life, is
called a covenant, Ierem. 33. 20. 25. My covenant of the day, and my covenant
of the night: if my covenant be not with day and night, if I appoint not the
statutes of Heaven and Earth.

12. Yet because it consists of a free donation, and is confirmed by the death
of the giver, it is not so properly called a covenant as a testament, Hebr. 9.
16. Which seeing it is not found in the former, that is not so properly called
a testament as a covenant.

13. But this new covenant differs from the old many ways. 1. In the kind, for
that was as it were a covenant of friendship between the Creator and the
creature: but this is a covenant of reconciliation between enemies.

14. 2. In the efficient: for in that there was an agreement of two parties,
namely God and man: but in this God only does covenant. For man being now dead
in sin, had no ability to contract a spiritual covenant with God. But if two
parties after the manner of a covenant are to be appointed, yet then God only
is the party assuming, and constituting, but man is the party assumed.

15. 3. It differs in the object: for that is extended to all men, but this
belongs to some certain ones in a special manner. For although the
promulgation of it be oftentimes propounded promiscuously, after the manner of
men, yet by a special propriety it belongs, and is directed to those to whom it
was intended by God, who are therefore called sons and heirs, of this
promise and of salvation, Genesis 15. Act. 1. 39. and 3. 25. Romans 4. 16. 13. and
9. 7. 8. Gal. 3. 21. 29.

16. 4. In the beginning or moving cause: for there God according to his
soveraingty did work out of his wise and just counsel: but here mercy only
has place. There indeed there did some respect of grace shine forth, in
appointing a reward due to obedience: yet it was not properly directed by
grace: and so not this covenant of grace, but that was accomplished, that is,
it did actually lead man to happiness.

17. 5. In the foundation, which in the former was the ability of man himself;
but in this, Christ Jesus.

18. 6. In the matter or good things promised: for in that God promised life
only; but in this he promises righteousness also, and all the means of life:
because to man being dead, not the continance or perfection of life, but
restoring was necessary.

19. 7. In the conditions: for that required perfect obedience of works, which
was also to be performed by man of his own strength before any effect of the
promise, that it might have respect of merit unto it: but this requires not any
condition properly so called, or going before, but only following after or
coming between, and that to be communicated by grace, that it might be a
means to perfect the same grace: which is the proper nature of Faith.

20. 8. In the effects: for that teached and shows what is righteous, but
this bestows righteousness it self, in that there was a dead letter, and
deadly to a sinner: but in this a quickening spirit.

21. Hence that never brought salvation to any man, neither could bring any
thing to a sinner, but only death but this does not properly and of it self
bring death or condemnation to any, but it brings assured salvation to all
those of whom it is received.

22. 9. In the adjunct of continuance: for that is antiquated in respect of
those who are partakers of this new: but this is everlasting, both in respect
of the countenance it has in it self, because it admitts no end, or change,
touching the substance, and also in respect of those to whom it is
communicated, because the grace of this covenant does continue for ever with
them, who are once truly in covenant.

CHAPTER XXV.
Of Predestination.

1. BEcause this application of redemption is made to some certain men, and
not to all, so that it shows a manifest difference between men, in respect
of the dispensation of grace; hence it does make the predestination of God
concerning men appear to us in the first place.

2. Predestination indeed was from eternity, Ephesians. 1. 4. He has chosen us
before the foundations of the World were laid. 2 Timothy 1. 9. Which grace was
given us before all ages. And it did also work from the beginning of the
works of God: but it makes no inward difference in the Predestinate themselves
before the actual dispensation of this application. Ephesians. 2. 3. And we were by
nature the children of wrath as well as others. 1 Cor. 6. 11. Thus ye were
indeed. For Predestination before the application of grace does put nothing in
the persons Predestined, but it does lie hid only in him that does
predestinate.

3. This Predestination is the decree of God of manifesting his special glory
in the eternal condition of men. Romans 9. 22. 23. Willing to show his wrath and
to make his power known, he suffered with much long suffering the vessels of
wrath, prepared to destruction. And to make known the riches of his glory
toward the vessels of mercy which he has prepared unto glory 1 Thessalonians. 5. 9.
God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain mercy.

4. It is called destination: because it is a certain determination of the
order of means unto the end. But because God had determined this order with
himself, before any actual existence of things, therefore it is not simply
called destination, but predestination.

5. It is called a decree: because it contains a definite sentence to be
executed by certain counsel. In the same sense also it is called a purpose,
and counsel, because it propounds an end to be attained unto, as it were with
an advised deliberation.

6. Hence predestination has greatest wisdom, freedom, firmness, and
immutability joined with it: because these are found in all the decrees of God.

7. Therefore the reason of Predestination is unmovable, and indissoluble, 2 Timothy 2. 19. The foundation of God stands sure having this seal. The Lord
knows who are his. And under that respect the number of the predestined,
(not only the formal number, or number numbering (as they speak) that is, how
many men at length shall be saved, and how many not: but also the material
number or number numbered, that is, who those several men are) is certain with
God, not only by certainty of foreknowledge, but also by certainty of order of
means. Luc. 10. 20. Rejoice that your names are written in the Heavens.

8. For Predestination does not necessarily presuppose either its limit, or
object as existing, but it makes it to exist: so that by force of
predestination it is ordered, that it should be. 1 Pet. 1. 20. Of Christ
foreknowne before the foundations of the world were laid.

9. Hence also it depends upon no cause, reason or outward condition, but it
does purely proceed from the will of him that predestinateth. Mat. 11. 26. Even
so Father, because it pleased thee. Romans 9. 16. 18. It is not of him that
wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy: he has mercy
on whom he will, and whom he will he hardens.

10. Hence it is neither necessary nor agreeable to the Scriptures either to
appoint any fore required quality in man, as it were the formal object of
Predestination: or so to assign any certain condition of man, that the rest
should be excluded: for it is sufficient to understand that men are the object
of this decree, so that the difference of the decree does not depend upon man,
butthat difference, which is found in men, does follow upon the decree

11. In order of intention there is no foreknowledge, fore-required, or ought
to be presupposed unto the decree of Predestination, besides that simple
intelligence which is of all possible things: because it depends not upon any
reason, or eternal condition, but does purely proceed from the will of him
that does predestinate. Ephesians. 1. 5. 9. He has predestined us according to the
good pleasure of his own will. According to his free good will which he had
purposed in himself.

12. It is properly an act of Gods Will, whereby it is exercised about a
certain object which it determines to bring to a certain end by certain
means. Ephesians. 1. 11. We were chosen, when we were predestined, according to
the purpose of him that works all things according to the pleasure of his own
will.

13. This decree as it does exist in the mind of God presupposing an act of the
will is called fore knowledge: whence it comes to pass that foreknowledge
signifies as much sometime as Predestination, but less properly, Romans 11. 2.
He has not cast away his people whom he fore-knew.

14. There is only one act of will in God properly, because all things in him
are together, and nothing before or after, and so there is only one decree
about the end and means: but after our manner of conceiving, God in order of
intention does will the end before the means. Romans 8. 30. Whom he has
predestined, those he called: although in order of execution, he wills the
means first before their direction to the end. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. He has chosen
us to salvation through sanctification, and faith.

15. Some things are the means, and the end, and the causes also of other
means. John. 6. 37. Whatsoever the Father gives me shall come to me, and him
that comes to me, I will in no wise cast away, yet they are not causes of the
act it self of Predestination, nor of all the effects of it.

16. There are some means which of their own nature are ordered to the end of
Predestination: of which sort are all those things which pertain to the grace
revealed in the Gospel; but other things in a certain outward respect are
subjected to this order: such as are natural good or evil things which above
or beyond their nature through the overruling direction of grace do work
together to our salvation.

17. Of Predestination there are two kinds, Election and Reprobation.

18. Election is the predestination of some certain men, that the glorious
grace of God may be manifested in them. Ephesians. 1. 4. 5. 6. He has chosen us, he
has predestined us to the praise of his glorious grace.

19. Election is an act of the will, which in God is only one and simple: yet
after our manner of conceiving it sets forth (by Synecdoche) by diverse acts.

20. The first act of election then is to will the glory of his grace in the
salvation of some men. 2 Thessa. 2. 13. God has chosed us from the beginning
unto salvation.

21. The second act is to appoint some certain men who shall be made partakers
of this salvation. 2. Tim. 2. 19. The Lord knows who are his.

22. But the proper reason of election is in this second act, which act
contains these three things in the conceaving of it, 1. Love. Romans 9. 13. 2.
Love with respect to a supernatural and chief good. Ier. 31. 3. Ephesians. 5. 25.
3. Love with a separating from others: in which comparative manner, there is
contained a certain virtuall intention of love. Romans 9. 13. John. 17. 6. 1.
Cor. 1. 27. 28.

23. The third act of election is a purpose or intention of preparing and
directing those means by which men elected, are certainly lead through to
salvation as to an end. But these means are properly redemption, and
application of redemption, Ionh 6. 37. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13.

24. This third act in a special respect is called predestination: which is
sometime in the Scriptures distinguished from election, even as it respects the
elect above, Romans 8. 29. Ephesians. 1. 4. and 5. Whom he did foreknow, those he also
predestined. As he has chosen us. Who has predestined us. Although
otherwise by a synecdoche it is used in the same sense with election.

25. Hence Predestination is sometime said to be according to his purpose. Ephesians.
1. 11. And his purpose according to election, Romans 9. 11. And election also
according to purpose, the counsel, and good pleasure of the Will of God, Ephesians.
1. 5.

26. There does a certain knowledge particularly accompany these acts of will
in election in the mind of God, wherebyGod does most certainly know the heirs
of eternal life: whence also election it self is called, knowledge or
foreknowledge. Romans 8. 29. But this knowledge of God because with greatest
firmness it retains the distinct names of those that are to be saved, and the
good things appointed for them, as if all were written in Gods Book, therefore
it is called the book of Life. Psalm 69. 29. Revelations 3. 5. and 13. 8.

27 This election was only one in God in respect of whole Christ mystically
considered, that is, of Christ, and of those who are Christ, as there was one
Creation of all mankind; yet as a certain distinction may be conceived
according to reason, Christ was first elected as the Head, and then some men as
members in him. Ephesians. 1. 4.

28. Yet Christ is not the meritorious, or impulsive cause in respect of the
election of men it self, although it has the reason of a cause in respect of
all the effects of election, which follow the sending of Christ himself.

29. Christ himself in the first act of election as touching the work of
redemption is rightly said to be an effect, and means ordained to the
salvation of man, as the end; as this salvation is the action of God, John 17.
6. Thine they were, and thou gave them me. Yet as this salvation is our good,
Christ is not the effect, but the cause of it. So it may be rightly said in
respect of the first act of election, that Christ the redeemer was the effect
and subordinate means, but in the third act of election he is to be considered
as a cause, Ephesians. 1. 3. He has blessed us with all spiritual blessings, in the
Heavens, in Christ.

30. Reprobation is the predestinating of some certain men, that the glory of
Gods Justice might be manifested in them. Romans 9. 22. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 12. Iud. 4.

31. Three acts are to be conceived in reprobation, as before in election.

32. The first act is to will the setting forth of Justice. Therefore the end
of God in reprobation, is not properly the destruction of the Creature, but the
Justice of God, which shines forth in deformed destruction.

33. Hence is the first difference in reason between election and reprobation,
for in election not only the glorious grace of God has the respect of an end:
but also the salvation of men themselves: but in reprobation damnation in it
self has not the respect of an end, or of good.

34. The second act is to appoint those certain men in whom this Justice of
God should be made manifest. Jude 4.

35. That act cannot properly be called election: because it is not out of
love, neither does it bring the bestowing of any good, but the privation of it:
Therefore it is properly called reprobation, because it does reject or remove
those about whom it is exercised, from that love wherewith the elect are
appointed to salvation. As therefore in election, there is love with discerning
so in reprobation, there is seen the denial of love with putting a difference.

36. But because this negative setting apart which is found in reprobation,
does depend upon that setting apart which is in election: hence the remote end
of reprobation is the glory of that grace which is manifested in election. Romans
9. 22. 23. He suffered the vessels of wrath, that he might make known the
riches of his glory toward the vessels of mercy.

37. Because of this setting apart, whereby God will not communicate
blessedness upon some persons, he is therefore said to hate them. Romans 9. 13.
This hatred is called negative, or privative, because it denies election: but
it includes a positive act whereby God would that some should be deprived of
life eternal.

38. Nevertheless in this is the second difference of reason, between election
and reprobation, that the love of election, does bestow the good on the Creatu^
immediately, but the hatred of reprobation, does only deny good, does not bring
or inflict evil, but the desert of the Creature coming between.

39. The third act of reprobation is an intention to direct those means
whereby Justice may be manifested in the reprobate.

40. The most proper means of this kind are permission of sin, and living in
sin, Romans 9. 18. ^2 Thessalonians. 2. 11. 12.

41. In this act there is the third difference of reason between election and
reprobation, that election is the cause, not only of salvation, but also of all
those things which have the consideration of a cause unto salvation: but
reprobation is not properly a cause, either of damnation, or of sin which
deserves damnation, (...) an an^ecedent only.

42. Hence also follows a fourth disparity, that the very means have not
always among themselves the respect of a cause and effect: for the permission
of sin is not the cause of forsaking, hardening, punishing, but sin it self.

CHAPTER XXVI.
Of ^lling.

Hitherto of Application: The parts of it follow.

1. THE parts of Application are two. Union with Christ, and communion of the
benefits that flow from that Union, Phil. 3. 9. That I may be found in him,
having the righteousness that is by the Faith of Christ.

2. This Union^ that spiritual relation of men to Christ whereby they obtain
right to all those blessings which are prepared in him. 1 John 5. 12. He that
has the S^e has life (...) And. 3. 24. He dwells (...) him, and he in him.

3. This Union is wrought by calling.

4. For Calling is a gathering of men together to Christ, that they may be
united with him. 1 Pet. 2. 4. 5. To whom coming, Ephesians. 4. 12. For the gathering
together of the Saints, for the edifying of the Body of Christ. From which
Union with Christ there follows Union with GOD the Father. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 1. and
2. 1. 1. To the Church which is in GOD the Father, and in our Lord Jesus Christ.

5. This therefore is that first thing which pertaines to the application of
redemption. Ephesians. 1. 7. 8. 9. In whom we have redemption, etc. After he made
known unto us the mystery of his will: and it is that first thing which does
make a man actually elected himself, that is the first act of election which
is showed forth and exercised in man himself: whence also it is that Calling
and election are sometime taken in the Scriptures in the same sense. 1 Cor. 1.
26. 27. 28. Ye see your Calling: God has chosen foolish things and weak
things.

6. Hence the Calling of men does not in any sort depend upon the dignity,
honesty, industry, or any endeavor of the called, but upon election and
predestination of God only. Acts 2. 47. The Lord did ad to the Church such as
should be saved. And 13. 48. As many as were ordained to life believed. Romans 8.
30. Whom he predestined, them also he called. Tit. 3. 5. Not by works of
righteousness, but of his own mercy, Iane^ 1. 18. Of his own will begat he us
by the word of truth.

7. The parts of Calling are two. The offer of Christ, and the receiving of
him. John 1. 11. He came to his own, and his own received him not. But to as
many as receive him, he gave to them, etc.

8. The offer, is an objective propounding of Christ as of a means sufficient
and necessary to salvation. 1. Cor. 1. 23. 24. We preach Christ, the Power of
God and the wisdom of God. Heb. 7. 25. He is able perfectly to save those that
come to God by him. Acts 4. 12. Neither is there any other name under Heaven,
which is given among men, by which we must be saved.

9. But there is nothing propounded, nor ought to be propounded of Christ, in
the Calling of men, to be believed as true, which is not simply and absolutely
true. For this is both against the nature of a testimony, as it is an object of
that Faith which is in the understanding, the formal reason whereof is truth:
and also is against the nature of the Gospel it self, which by an excellency,
is called the word of truth. Ephesians. 1. 13.

10. The offer of Christ is outward, or inward.

11. The outward is a propounding, or preaching of the Gospel or of the
promises of Christ. Acts. 9. 15. That he may bear my name in the sight of the
Gentiles.

12. Yet that man be prepared to receive the promises, the application of the
Law does ordinarily go before to the discovery of sin, and inexcusablenesse
and humiliation of the sinner: Romans 7. 7. I knew not sin, but by the Law.

13. Those promises as touching the outward promulgation, are propounded to all
without difference, together with a command to believe them, but as touching
the propriety of the things promised, which depends upon the intention of him
that promises, they belong only to the elect, who are therefore called the
sons and heirs of the promise. Romans 9. 8.

14. The inward offer is a spiritual enlightening, whereby those promises are
propounded to the hearts of men, as it were by an inward word. John 6. 45.
Whosoever has heard of the Father and has learned, comes to me. Ephesians. 1. 17.
That he might give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation, the eyes of
your mind being enlightened, that ye may know what is that hope of your calling.

15. This also is sometime, and in a certain manner granted to those that are
not elected. Hebrews 6. 4. and 10. 29. Mat. 13. 20.

16. If any one oppose himself out of malice to this illumination, he commits
a sin against the Holy Ghost, which is called unpardonable, or unto death.
Hebr. 6. 6. and 10. 29. 1 John 5. 16. Mat. 12. 32.

17. The receiving of Christ is that whereby Christ being offered is joined to
man, and man unto Christ. John 6. 56. He abides in me, and I him.

18. In respect of this conjunction we say that we are in Christ, 2 Cor. 5. 17.
And to put on Christ. Gal. 3. 27. To be dwelled in by Christ. Ephesians. 3. 17. The
house of Christ. Hebr. 3. 6. the Temple of Christ, 2 Cor. 6. 16. To be espoused
to Christ. Ephesians. 5. 23. Branches of Christ, John 15. 5. Members of Christ, 1
Cor. 12. 12. And the Name of Christ is a certain manner communicated to us. 1
Cor. 12. 12. So also is Christ.

19. By reason of this receiving, Calling is called conversion. Acts 26. 20.
Because all they who obey the call of God, are wholly converted from sin to
grace, from the world to follow God in Christ: It is also called regeneration
as by that word, the very beginning of a new life, of a new Creation, of a new
Creature, is often set forth in the Scriptures. John 1. 13. and 3. 6. 1 John 3.
9. 1 Pet. 1. 23. and 22. As in respect of the offer it is properly called,
Calling, as God does effectually invite and draw men to Christ. John 6. 44.

20. Receiving in respect of man is either passive, or active. Philippians 3.
12. That I may apprehend: I was apprehended.

21. Passive receiving of Christ is that whereby a spiritual principle of
grace is begotten in the will of man. Ephesians. 2. 5. He has quickened.

22. For this grace is the foundation of that revelation whereby a man is
united with Christ, John 3. 3. Except a man be borne again, he cannot see
the Kingdom of God.

23. But the will is the most proper and prime subject of this grace, because
the conversion of the will is an effectual principle of the conversion of the
whole man. Phil. 2. 17. It is God that works in you both to will and to do,
of his own good pleasure.

24. The enlightening of the mind is not sufficient to produce this effect,
because it does not take away that corruption which is in the will, neither
does it communicate unto it any new supernatural principle, by virtue whereof
it may convert it self.

25. Yet the will in respect of this first receiving, has not the
consideration either of a free agent, or a natural patient, but only of
obedientiall subjection. 2 Cor. 4. 6. Because God who has said that light
should shine out of darkness, he it is who has shined in our hearts.

26. Active receiving is Actus olicitus, an act of Faith drawn forth, whereby
he that is called does now wholly lean upon Christ as his Savior, and by
Christ upon God, John 3. 15. 16. Whosoever believes in him, 1 Pet. 1. 21.
Through him believing in God.

27. This act of Faith does depend partly upon a principle or habit of grace
ingenerated, and partly upon the operation of God moving before and stirring
up, John 6. 44. None can come to me, unless the Father draw him.

28. It is indeed drawn out and exercised by man freely, but certainly
unavoydably, and unchangeably. John 6. 37. Whatsoever my Father gives me
shall come unto me.

29. With this Faith wherewith the will is turned to the having of the true
good, there is always joined repentance, by which the same will is turned also
to the doing of the true good, with an averseness, and hatred of the contrary
evil, or sin. Acts 19. 4. Marc. 1. 15. Repent, and believe the Gospel.

30. Repentance has the same causes and principles with Faith, for they are
both the free gifts of God. Ephesians. 2. 8. Faith is the gift of God. 2 Timothy 2. 25.
Whether God will at any time give them repentance. They have the same subject,
because both have their seat in the heart or will of man. Romans 10. 9. 1 Kings
8. 48. With the heart man believes. They shall return with all their heart.
They are also begotten at the same time. But, first, they have diverse objects,
for Faith is properly carried unto Christ, and by Christ unto God: but
repentance is carried to God himself who was before offended by sin, Acts 20.
21. Repentance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Secondly,
they have diverse ends, for Faith does properly seek reconciliation with God,
but repentance a sutablenesse to the will of God. Romans 3. 25. A reconciliation
through Faith in his blood. Acts 26. 20. That they should turn unto God doing
works meet to repentance.

31. Repentance in respect of that carfulness, and anxiety, and terror
arising from the Law which it has joined with it, does go before Faith, by
order of nature, as a preparing and disposing cause: but in respect of that
effectual and kindly turning away from sin, as God is offended by it, so it
follows Faith, and depends upon it as the effect upon his cause, and herein is
proper to the faithful.

32. Although this repentance does always bring grief with it for sins past
and present, yet it does not so properly or essentially consist in grief, as
in turning from, and hatred of sin, and in a firm purpose to follow after
good, Amos 5. 14. 15. Hate the evil, Love the good.

33. That repentance is not true and sound, which does not turn a man from all
known sin, to every known good: neither that which does not virtually continue,
and is actually, renewed as often as need is, from the time of conversion to
the end of life.

34. Repentance is wont to be perceived before Faith: because a sinner cannot
easily persuade himself that he is reconciled to God in Christ, before he
feel himself to have forsaken those sins which did separate him from God.

CHAPTER XXVII.
Of Justification.

1. COmmunion of the blessings flowing from Union with Christ, is that whereby
the faithful are made partakers of all those things they have need of, to live
well, and blessedly with God. Ephesians. 1. 3. He has blessed us with all spiritual
blessings. Romans 8. 32. He who spared not his own Son, etc. How shall he not
freely with him give us all things also?

2. This communion therefore does bring a translation and change of condition
to believers, from the state of sin and death, to the state of righteousness
and life eternal. 1 John 3. 14. We know that we are translated from death to
life.

3. This change of state is twofold; relative, and absolute or real.

4. A relative change of state is that which consists in Gods reputation. Romans
4. 5. And he that works not, but believes in him that justifies the
ungodly, his faith is imputed to him for righteousness, 1 Cor. 5. 19. God was
in Christ reconciling the World tot himself: not imputing to them their
offenses.

5. Hence it admits no degrees properly so called, but it is together and at
once perfect in one only act, although in respect of the manifestation, sense,
and effects, it has diverse degrees. Hitherto pertaines justification and
adoption.

6. Justification is a gracious sentence of God, whereby for Christ's sake
apprehended by Faith he does absolve the believer from sin and death, and
accounts him righteous unto life. Romans 3. 22, 24. The righteousness of God by
Faith of Jesus Christ in all, and upon all that believe: as they who are freely
justified by his grace through the redemption made by Jesus Christ.

7. It is the pronouncing of a sentence, as the use of the word declares, which
does norset forth a physical, or real change in the holy Scriptures: but that
judicial, or moral change which consists in pronouncing of a sentence and in
reputation. Prove. 17. 15. He that justifies the wicked. Romans 8. 33. Who shall
lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that Iustifies.

8. Therefore Thomas with his followers does fowly err, who would have
justification as it were a physical motion, by a real transmutation from a
state of unrightousnesse to a state of righteousness; so as that the term
from which is sin, the term to which, is inherent righteousness, and the
motion is partly remission of sin, partly infusion of righteousness.

9. This sentence was. 1. As it were conceived in the mind of God by a decree
of justifying. Gal. 3. 8. The Scripture foreseeing that God would justify the
Gentiles by Faith. 2. It was pronounced in Christ our head, now rising from the
dead. 2 Cor. 5. 19. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not
imputing their sins to them. 3. It is virtually pronounced upon that first
relation which arises upon Faith begotten, Romans 8. 1. There is therefore no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. 4. It is expressly pronounced by
the Spirit of God witnessing unto our spirits our reconciliation with God. Romans
5. 5. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Spirit that is
given to us. In this testimony of the spirit justification itself does not so
properly consist, as an actual perceiving of that before granted as it were by
a reflected act of Faith.

10. It is a gracious sentence, because it is not properly given by the Justice
of God, but by his grace, Romans 3. 24. Freely by his grace. For by the same
grace whereby he called Christ to the office of Mediator, and did draw the
elect to Union with Christ, he does account them being already drawn and
believing, to be just by that Union.

11. It is for Christ's sake, 2 Cor. 5. 21. That we may be made the
righteousness of God in him, for the obedience of Christ is that
righteousness in respect whereof the grace of God does justify us, no
otherwise, then the disobedience of Adam was that offense in respect whereof
the justice of God did condemn us. Romans 5. 18.

12. Therefore the righteousness of Christ, is imputed to believers in
justification. Phil. 3. 9. That I may be found in him not having mine own
righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is by Faith of Christ, the
righteousness of God through Faith.

13. But because this righteousness is ordained of God to that end, and by his
grace is approved and confirmed: so that sinners can stand before him through
this righteousness, therefore it is called the righteousness of God. Romans 10.
3.

14. But this justification is for Christ, not absolutely considered, in which
sense Christ is also the cause of vocation, but for Christ apprehended by
Faith, which Faith does follow Calling as an effect, and follows
righteousness, by which being apprehended justification follows: whence also
righteousness is said to be of Faith. Romans 9. verse. 30. and 10. 16. And
Justification through Faith, Chap. 3. 28.

15. This justifying Faith is not that general Faith whereby in the
understanding we yield assent to the truth revealed in the holy Scriptures: for
that does neither properly belong to those that are justified, neither of it
own nature has it any force in it self to justify, neither does it produce
those effects which are every where in the Scripture given to justifying Faith.

16. Neither is it (to speak properly) that special confidence, whereby we
do apprehend remission of sins, and justification it self: for justifying
Faith goes before justification it self, as the cause goes before the
effect: but Faith apprehending justification does necessarily presuppose, and
follow justification, as an act follows the object about which it is exercised.

17. That Faith therefore is properly called justifying, whereby we rely upon
Christ for remission of sins and for salvation. For Christ is the adaequate
object of Faith as Faith. Iustifyeth. Faith also does no otherwise justify,
then as it apprehends that righteousness by which we are justified: but that
righteousness is not in the truth of some sentence to which we yield assent,
but in Christ alone, who is made sin for us, that we might be
righteousness in him, 2 Cor. 5. 21.

18. Hence are those Sermons so often repeated in the new Testament, which do
show that justification is to be fought for in Christ alone. John 1. 12. and 3.
15. 16. and 6. 40. 47. 14. 1. 54. Romans 4. 5. and 3. 26. Acts 10. 43. and 26.
18. Gal. 3. 26.

19. This justifying Faith of it own nature does produce, and so has joined
with it a speci^ll and certain persuasion of the grace and mercy of God in
Christ: whence also justifying Faith is oftentimes not amiss described by the
orthodox by this persuasion, especially when they do oppose that general
Faith to which the Papists ascribe all things: but 1. This persuasion as
touching the sense of it, is not always present. For it may and often does
come to pass, either through weakness of judgment, or through diverse
tentations and troubles of mind, that he, who truly believes, and is by Faith
justified before God, yet for a time may think according to that which he
feels, that he neither believes, nor is reconciled to God. 2. There be diverse
degrees, of his persuasion, so that neither all believers have altogether the
same assurance of the grace and favor of God, nor the same believers at all
times: which yet they cannot properly affirm of justifying Faith without a
great deal of detriment of that consolation and peace which Christ has left
to believers.

20. Justification absolves from sin and death not immediately by taking away
the blame, or stain, or all the effects of sin: but that oblation and guilt to
undergo eternal death. Romans 8. 1. 33. 34. There is no condemnation, who shall
lay any thing to their charge? who shall condemn?

21. Neither yet does it so take away the guilt, as that it takes away the
desert of punishment from the sin, which (the sin it self remaining,) can in
no sort be taken away; but it so takes away the guilt, that it takes away the
revenging pursuit of the desert of it, or the deadly effects of it.

22. This absolution from sins is called in a diverse respect, but in the same
sense in holy Scriptures Remission, Redemption, and Reconciliation, Ephesians. 1. 6.
7. For as the state of sin is considered as a bondage, or certain spiritual
captivity in respect of the guilt, so his justification is called Redemption,
but as the same state is considered as a subjection to do punishment, so it is
called remission, as also a passing by, a blotting out, a disburdening, a
taking away, a casting away, a removing, a casting behind the back, Romans 4. 7.
Col. 2. 13. Mich. 7. 18. Isay 43. 12. 38. 17. Psalm. 32. 1, 2. And as the same
state is considered as a certain enmity against God, so justification is
called a reconciliation. Romans 5. 10. As also a certain winking at sin, Numb.
23. 25. A covering of sin. Ps. 32. 1, 2.

23. But not only the sins of justified persons that are past are remitted, but
also in some sort those to come. Numb. 23. 25. He sees no iniquity in Jacob,
nor perverseness in Israel, because justification has left no place to
condemnation, John 5. 24. He that believes has eternal life, and shall not
come into condemnation: and it does certainly and immediately adjudge one to
eternal life. It also makes all that remission, which was in Christ obtained
for us, to be actually ours: neither can sins past and present be altogether
and fully remitted, unless sins to come be in some sort remitted also.

24. But there is this difference, that sins past are remitted by a formal
application, by sins to come only virtually: sins past are remitted in
themselves, sins to come in the subject or person sinning.

25. Yet those that are justified do daily desire the forgiveness of sins. 1.
Because the continuance of this grace is necessary to them. 2. That the sense
and manifestation of it may be more and more perceived, as several sins
required. 3. That the execution of that sentence which in justification is
pronounced, might be matured and furthered.

26. Besides the forgiveness of sins there is required also imputation of
righteousness, Romans 5. 18. Rev. 19. 8. Romans 8. 3. Because there may be a
total absence of sin, where notwithstanding there is not that righteousness
which must come in place of justification.

27. But this righteousness is not severally to be sought in the purity of the
nature, birth, and life of Christ: but it arises out of all the obedience of
Christ together with remission of sins, as the same disobedience of Adam, has
both robbed us of original righteousness, and made us subject to the guilt of
condemnation.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
Of Adoption.

1. ADoption is the gracious sentence of God whereby he accepts the faithful
for Christ's sake, unto the dignity of Sons. John 1. 12. As many as receive him,
to them he gave power to be made the Sons of God, to those that believe in his
Name.

2. It is called a gracious sentence of God: because it does manifest the
gracious will of God toward men: 1 John 3. 1. See what love the Father has
showed to us, that we should be called the Sons of God.

3. This sentence is pronounced with the same diversity of degrees as
justification: for it was first in Gods predestination. Ephesians. 1. 5. He has
predestined us that he might adopt us to be Sons. Afterward it was in Christ.
Gal. 4. 4, 5. God has sent forth his Son, that we might receive adoption.
Afterward it was in believers themselves, The same Chapter Verse 6. And because
ye are Sons, GOD has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,
crying, Abba Father.

4. It is properly conversant about the faithful that are called and
justified, John 1. 12. For by adoption we are not made just: which would
necessarily follow, if adoption were part of justification it self, as some
would have it: neither is it a calling unto Christ, but a certain excellent
dignity flowing from the application of him, Romans 8. 17. Heirs together with
Christ:

5. Yet calling and justification have the respect of a foundation to this
relation of Adoption: for the right of Adoption is obtained by Faith, and the
righteousness of Faith. John 1. 12.

6. But although Adoption follow upon Faith: yet it does not so immediately
follow, but justification comes between: for Adoption of its own nature does
forerequire, and presuppose that reconciliation which is found in Justification.

7. Hence all the faithful do expect Heaven as it were by a double title,
namely by the title of redemption which they have by justification, and by the
title as it were of Sonship, which they have by Adoption.

8. Which yet ought so to be understood that the title of redemption is a
foundation of this right, and Adoption does ad a certain manner of excellency
and dignity.

9. Hence arises the first difference between Divine Adoption and humane: for
humane Adoption is of a person that is a stranger, which has no right to the
inheritance, but by force of Adoption: but the faithful although by natural
generation they have no right to the inheritance of life, yet by virtue of
regeneration, Faith and justification, they have it adjudged to them.

10. Hence also the second difference follows, that humane adoption is only
an extrinsecall denomination, and a communication of those things which are
external: but Divine adoption is a relation so real, that it is also founded
in an intrinsecall action, and in the communicating of a new inward life.

11. This Adoption is made for Christ's sake: because Christ did not only
deserve it as Redeemer, Gal. 4. 5.

That he might redeem them, to receive the adoption of Sons. But also as being
already applied by Faith, he is the bond of this Union. Romans 8. 17. 29. Heirs
of God, coheires with Christ. To be conformed to the Image of his Son.

12. For as Christ in justification is applied as a garment to cover our sins:
so in Adoption he is applied as a brother and Prince of our salvation. Hebr. 2.
10, 11, 12, 13. Many Sons. The Prince of salvation. He that sanctifies, and
they that are sanctified are all of one. He is not ashamed to call them
Brethren. Behold I and the children which God has given me.

13. This application and conjunction is so near, that although Christ is
properly the only natural So^ of God, and much more the first begotten of God:
yet by this grace of Adoption, and communion with Christ, all the faithful
also are said to be the first begotten of God. Heb. 12. 23. Ye are come to the
universal assembly and meeting of the first borne who are written in Heaven.

14. Whence also it appears that believers are in a far different manner the
Sons of God then Adam was in the first Creation: for although Adam by reason of
that dependence which he had of God together with that similitude and Image to
which he was created, might be called metaphorically the Son of God; yet he was
not the Son of God by this mystical conjunction and communion with Christ who
is the natural Son of God.

15. Hence arises the third difference between humane adoption and divine,
for humane adoption was brought in upon want of a natural Son: but the divine
Adoption is not from any want, but out ^f abundant goodness, whereby a
likeness of a natural Son, and a mystical conjunction with him is
communicated to the adopted Sons.

16. That dignity which this Adoption brings with it, does not only far exceed
that common relation whereby God is said to be the Father of every Creature:
but that also which we had before the fall: because that was weak, but this by
reason of the band does remain for ever, John 8. 32. The servant abides not
in the house for ever: but the Son abides for ever.

17. Hence the Name of God and of Christ is named upon the faithful, by a
special right and reason. 1 John 3. 1. As Jacob taking the sons of Joseph into
adoption would have them called by his name. Genesis 48. 5.

18. Hence also the faithful are taken as it were into Gods Family, and are of
his household. Gal. 6. 10. That is, that they may be always under the fatherly
tuition of God, depending upon him, for nourishment, education, and perpetual
conservation: as in old time among the Hebrews adoption of tentimes was no
otherwise testified then by the nurturing and education, of their next kindred
in blood. Hest. 2. 7.

19. Together with the dignity of sons there is joined also the condition of
heirs, Romans 8. 17. If sons, then also heirs: But this inheritance to which
the faithful are adopted, is blessedness eternal: whence adoption does
sometimes in Scripture comprehend all that glory which is prepared for the
faithful, and is expected by them in Heaven, Romans 8. 23. Looking for our
adoption, the redemption of our bodies.

20. Therefore eternal blessedness pertaines to the faithful, and is
communicated to them, not of justice for their deserts, but from that grace
whereby they are taken into the number of sons. Gal. 3. 29. If ye are Christ's,
then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs by promise.

21. Hence arises a certain fourth difference between humane adoption and
divine: for humane adoption is ordained for that that the Son might succeed the
Father in the inheritance: but divine adoption is not ordained for succession,
but for participation of the inheritance assigned: because both the Father and
his first begotten Son lives for ever, and so admits no succession.

22. A proper adjunct of this adoption is the testimony of the spirit which is
given to the faithful whereby this dignity is sealed together with the
inheritance which is to be expected from it, and it is called the spirit of
Adoption, Romans 8. 15, 16, 23. Gal. 4. 5, 6, 7.

23. But the Spirit is said to be communicated to the faithful, not because
Faith goes before all operation of the Spirit, as some unskilfully gather: for
the very first regeneration and conversion is plainly attributed to the holy
Spirit by Christ. John 7. 5. 6, 8. Borne of the spirit: but because believers
only after they have already believed, do receive this operation of the holy
Spirit whereby they are sealed, as with an earnest of their inheritance. Ephesians.
1. 13, 14. and 4. 30. Gal. 3. 14.

24. And hence also it does sufficiently appear that assurance of salvation is
not properly justifying Faith, but a fruit of that Faith: because the Apostle
expressly faith. After ye believed, ye were sealed. Ephesians. 1. 13.

25. The first fruit of adoption is that Christian liberty. Whereby all
believers are as set at liberty by a manumission as it were from the bondage of
the Law, sin and the world. John 8. 32, 36. If the Son shall set you free, ye
shall be free indeed. Romans 8. 22. Being freed from sin we are made servants unto
God. Gal. 4. Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
Hebr. 2. 15. That he might set at liberty those who for fear of death were all
their life time subject to bondage.

26. The second fruit is that the faithful partaking of the dignity of Christ,
are also by him, as it were, Prophets, Priests, and Kings. Rev. 1. 6.

The third fruit is, that all the Creatures and those things which are done by
them, are either subject unto the dominion and pure use of the faithful. Tit.
1. 15. 1 Cor. 3. 21. 22. Or do perform the office of Ministry for them, as
it is affirmed of the Angels. Heb. 1. 14. Or at least do turn to their good.
Romans 8. 28.

CHAPTER XXIX.
Of Sanctification.

So much of the relative change of the condition of the faithful in
Justification and adoption: the real change follows whereby that former is
manifested, and as touching the effects, as it were committed to execution.

1. THE real change of state is an alteration of qualities made in man
himself. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Old things are past away, all things are become new.

2. But because it does not consist in relation and respect, but in real
effecting; therefore it admits diverse degrees, of beginning, progress, and
perfection. 2. Cor. 4. 16. The inward man is renewed day by day.

3. This alteration of qualities does either respect that good which is just,
and honest, and it is called Sanctification: or that good which is profitable
and honorable, and it is called glorification. Romans 6. 22. Ye have your fruit
in holiness, and the end everlasting life.

4. Sanctification is a real change of a man from the filthiness of sin, to
the purity of Gods Image. Ephesians. 4. 22. 23. 34. To put off as touching the old
conversation, that old man, which does corrupt it self in the deceivable
lusts: and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and to put on that new
man, who according to God is created to righteousness and true holiness.

5. For as by justification a believer is properly freed from the guilt of sin,
and has life adjudged to him, the title of which life is as it were,
determined in adoption; so by sanctification the same believer is freed from
the filthiness and stain of sin, and the purity of Gods Image is restored
to him.

6. For hereby Sanctification is not understood the separation from a common
use and consecration to some special use, in which sense the word is often
taken in Scripture, sometime setting forth only the outward, sometime also
that inward and effectual separation; for so it may be extended to calling or
that first regeneration whereby Faith is communicated as a principle of new
life: in which sense regeneration and Sanctification is wont to be confounded
by most: but by it is understood that change of a man, whereby a believer has
righteousness and inherent holiness communicated to them. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13.
Through Sanctification of the Spirit.

7. For God himself does manifestly witness that holiness is a gift of grace
inherent, Ier. 31. 33. I will put my Laws into their mind, and in their heart
will I write them, Ezech. 36. 26. 27. I will give you a new heart, and a new
spirit will I put into the midst of you.

8. But this sanctification is distinguished, from that change of a man which
is proper to the calling of a man in Faith and repentance. In that that Faith
there is not considered properly as a quality, but in relation to Christ:
neither is repentance there considered as a change of disposition; for so it is
all one with sanctification: but as a change of purpose and intent of the mind.
But here a real change of qualities and dispositions is looked unto.

9. It is called a real change, that it may be distinguished not only from
justification, but also from that sanctification which is by Justification, as
is the Sanctification of the seventh day: or also that which is by relation of
a sign, as is the Sanctification of the elements in the Sacraments, or lastly,
that which is by manifestation, in which manner God himself is said to be
sanctified by men. 1 Peter 3. 14.

10. It is of the whole man, not of some one part. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23. Now the God
of peace himself sanctify you wholly, and your whole spirit, soul and body
be preserved blameles unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, Although so
much of man, Tantum and totum or that whole that is in man is not presently
changed.

11. But although the whole man be partaker of this grace, yet it first and
chiefly, agrees to the soul, and afterward from the soul is derived to the
body, as the body of it is capable by that obedientiall power wherewith
together with the soul it is subject to the will of God. So also in the soul
first and properly it agrees to the will, from which it is derived into other
faculties according to the order of nature. Deuteronomy. 30. 6. The Lord thy God shall
circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou may live. Romans 2. 29. The
circumcision of the heart.

12. It is a change of a man from sin, to distinguish it from that
sanctification which is, A (...) mere negative from the mere negative contrary,
such as that was which is attributed to the humane nature of Christ, which is
said to be sanctified, or made holy, although the nature of Christ was never
defiled with sin.

13. The term from which this is, is filthiness, corruption, or the blot of
fin, 2 Cor. 7. 1. Let us purge our selves from all filthiness of flesh and
spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

14. The term to which, is the purity of Gods Image, which is said to be
framed or created again in knowledge, righteousness and holiness. Ephesians. 4.
24. Or a conformity to the Law of God. Iam. 1. 25. Newnes of life. Romans 6. 4.
The new creature. 2. Cor. 5. 16. Gal. 6. 15. and the Divine nature. 2 Pet. 1. 4.

15. But it is called the new and Divine creature. 1. Because it is not
produced of those principles which are in us by nature, as the habit of all
arts are brought forth which are gotten by industry learning, but out of a new
principle of life, communicated by God unto us, in our calling. 2. Because our
natural disposition is altogether of another kind then it was before. 3.
Because in its measure it resembles that highest perfection which is found in
God.

16. There be two degrees of this sanctification, one in this life, which is
called in general an infancy. 1. (...). 13. 11. 12. Ephesians. 4. 14. 2 Pet. 2. 2.
Because although that variety be found in this life, that if some of those that
are sanctified be compared with others and with themselves at diverse times,
then some may be rightly called infants, and others men grown, whilst they
live here. Heb. 5. 13. 14. Yet the highest degree which we attain to in this
life is only a beginning of holiness promised and to be expected. The other
degree is called man's age and perfect age. Ephesians. 4. 14. 1 Cor. 13. ^1. Phil. 3.
12. Because in the life to come the motion and progress of sanctification
cease, there is only found rest, and perfection, so that in this life we are
more properly said to have sanctification then holiness, and in the life to
come: holiness only, and not sanctification.

17. Sanctification therefore has two parts: one in respect of the term from
which, is called mortification, and the other in respect of the term to which,
is called vivification and resurrection. Romans 8. 5. 6.

18. Mortification is the first part of sanctification whereby sin is wasted,
Col. 3. 3. 5. Ye are dead, mortify therefore your earthly members.

19. The meritorious, and exemplary cause of it is the Death of Christ. Romans 6.
5. 6. Being grafted into the likeness of his death: knowing this that our old
manis crucified with him.

20. The cause principally working is that spirit of God who communicates to
the faithful the efficacy of his death. Romans 8. 13. If by the spirit ye
mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

21. The administering cause is Faith it self, Romans 6. 17. From the heart ye
have obeyed that form of doctrine unto which ye were delivered.

22. From this mortification there follows in all that are sanctified a
denial of themselves, and the World. Luc. 9. 23. Gal. 6. 14.

23. Hence arises that inward difference which is between sin, which remains
in the faithful from that which remains in others: In others sin is reigning,
prevailing, and predominating: in the faithful it is broken, subdued and
mortified.

24. Vivification is the second part of sanctification whereby the Image or life
of God is restored in man. Col. 3. 10. Ephesians. 4. 24. Rev. 12. 2. Having put on
the new man: be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.

25. The exemplary cause of it is the Resursection of Christ. Col. 3. 1. 2. Ye
are risen with Christ.

26. The cause principally working is the Spirit of God, which raised Christ
from the dead, Romans 8. 11. If the Spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead
dwells in you.

27. The administering cause is Faith, Gal. 2. 20. The life which I now live in
the flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of GOD.

28. From this vivification there arises a strong tie in those who are
sanctified, of themselves to be addicted wholly to God and to Christ. 2. Cor. 8.
5. They give themselves to the Lord.

29. Because this sanctification is imperfect whilst we live here as infants,
therefore all the faithful lare informed as it were with a double form; sin
and grace: for the perfection of sanctification not found in this life, unless
in the dreams of some fantastic persons. 1 John 1. 8. If we say we have no
sin, we deceive our selves, and there is no truth in us. Yet all that are truly
sanctified do tend unto perfection, Mat. 5. 48. 1. Cor. 13. 11. 2 Pet. 3. 18.

30. Sin or the corrupted part which remains in those that are sanctified,
is called in Scriptures, The old man, the outward man, the members, and the
body of sin. Grace or the renowed part is called the new man, the spirit, the
mind, etc.

31. Hereupon there follows two things. 1. A spiritual war which is made
continually between these parties. Gal. 5. 17. For the flesh lusts against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary one to the
other. 2. A daily renewing of repentance.

32. That flesh which remains in the regenerate; is not only in the
vegetative, and sensitive appetite, but also in the will, and reason it self.
1 Thessalonians. 5. 23.

33. The flesh or this concupiscence has the true and proper reason of sin
in the regenerate themselves. Romans 7.

34. With this corruption even the best works of the Saints are infected, so
as they have need of some remission.

35. Yet the good works of the regenerate are not to be called sins, but
defiled with sin.

36. That defilement of good works, (by reason of Justification) does not
hinder but they may be accepted of God to be rewarded.

37. That fight which is found in wicked men between conscience and the will,
is not the striving of the spirit against the flesh, but of the flesh fearing
against the flesh desiring.

CHAPTER XXX.
Of Glorification.

In the former disputation we spoke of sanctification which is one part of the
alteration of qualities, which did respect that good that is just and honest:
the other part follows, namely Glorification which respects that good, that is
profitable and honorable.

1. GLorification is a real transmutation of a man, from misery or the
punishment of sin, unto happiness eternal. Romans 8. 30. And whom he
justified, those he glorified.

2. It is called a real transmutation, that it may be distinguished from that
blessedness which is either virtuall only, in Election, Calling,
Justification, and Adoption, or declarative in holy works. Romans 4. 6. David
declares that man to be blessed to whom God imputes righteousness, etc. Psalm.
65. 5. Blessed is he whom thou chusest, and bring to dwell in thy Courts.
Matthew. 5. Blessed are the poor in spirit, etc.

3. In respect of the term from which, viz. misery or the punishment of sin,
it is called a redemption. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Ephesians. 1. 14. Gal. 3. 13. Heb. 2. 14, 15.

4. This redemption is a real delivering from the evils of punishment: which
is nothing else in very deed, but the execution of the sentence of
Justification: for in Justification, as we are judged to be just, so we are
judged to have life. Now Glorification makes that life that was judged, and
pronounced ours by real communication, to be ours actually and by possession.

5. It is said to be real, that it may be distinguished from that redemption
which is in the payment of the price of redemption, and in application of the
same to justification, whereof mention is made Ephesians. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14.

6. In the Scriptures also it is wont to be called deliverance, and
preservation from the wrath of God, from death and from the kingdom of
darkness.

7. In respect of the term to which, it is called, beatification, blessing,
life eternal, glory, Glorification, the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, and an immortal inheritance. Ephesians. 1. 3. John 3. 36. and 6. 47. 2 Pet.
1. 3, 11. 1 Pet. 1. 4. and 5. 10.

8. The first degree of this Glorification begun, is the apprehension and sense
of the love of God shining forth in Christ, upon the communion which the
faithful have with him. Romans 5. 5. The love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts, by the holy spirit which is given to us.

9. Hence there arises a certain friendship between God, Christ, and the
faithful, John 15. 15. I have called you friends, because all that I have
heard of my Father have I made known unto you. James 2. 23. Abraham was called
the friend of God.

10. The second degree is undoubted hope and expectation, of the enjoyment of
all those good things which God has prepared for his. Romans 5. 2. We rejoice
under the hope of the glory of God.

11. Hence is freedom to come to God with boldness. Ephesians. 2. 18. and 3. 12.
Heb. 10. 22.

12. Hitherto pertaines the assurance of perseverance and salvation also, Romans
8. 38.

13. For this assurance as touching the thing it self which is called a
certainty of the object,. is sealed to all true believers: but as touching the
perceiving of it, which is called a certainty of the subject, it is not always
present to all; yet it may be gotten by any without special revelation, and
it ought also to be sought for by all: so as this certain confidence rightly
grounded has nothing common with presumption.

14. This certainty is grounded upon, and confirmed to the faithful by the
word, the seals, by oath, and by the earnest of God himself. He. 6. 17. God
willing abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his
counsel, he bound it by an oath: that by two immutable things we may have
strong consolation. Ephesians. 1. 13. Ye are sealed with that holy Spirit of promise
which is the earnest of our inheritance.

15. This truth is perceived, and made certain to us. 1. By a certain
spiritual sense whereby the grace of God now being present, does make its
presence manifest, and evident to the believer. 2. By the gift of discerning
whereby believers do distinguish true grace from the show of it. 3. By
discourse and testimony of conscience whereby grace and salvation is no less
seal to the faithful, then sin and death to unbelievers. 4. The Spirit of God
himself does so confirm all these ways of perceiving, that they have the
same certainty that Faith has. Romans 8. 16. The spirit it self witnesses with
our spirit, that we are the Sons of God. 1 Cor. 2. 12. We have received the
spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which God has freely given
us. 2 Cor. 13. 5. Try your selves whether ye be in the Faith, examine your
selves. 1 John 4. 16. We know, and believe, the love which God had toward us.

16. This certainty does follow upon the perceiving of Faith and Repentance,
where the free covenant of God is rightly understood. 2 Cor. 13. 5.

17. If either of these be wanting, this certain ty is taken away as touching
the perceiving of it; so that he that does rightly understand the promise of
the covenant, cannot be sure of his salvation, unless he perceive in hemselfe
true Faith and repentance: neither can he that feels himself truly to
believe, and repent, be sure of his perseverance and salvation, unless he also
understand by the covenant that God will mightily preserve those that believe
and repent, even to the end.

18. Therefore certainty of salvation is not of any, nor otherwise perceived,
but those who together with Faith keep a good conscience, and that whilst they
keep it from any grievous wound, which by those sins is brought which are wont
to wast conscience.

19. Hence as Faith, and a good conscience do flourish or languish in men, so
also this certainty is either confirmed, or diminished. Ps. 51.

20. They therefore that without any sense or care of Faith, and repentance do
certainly hope for salvation, in presuming they hope, and hoping they perish.

21. From this certainty arises consolation, peace, and joy unspeakable. Romans
5. 2. 3. 1 Pet. 1. 8. Romans 14. 17. 2 Cor. 1. 5. Which are the first fruits of
glory, Romans 8. 23.

22. Consolation is an easing of fear and oppressing grief. 2 Cor. 1. 4. Yet
it contains sometimes by a Synecdoche all salvation begun. Col. 2. 2.

23. Peace is a quieting of the mind, which arises partly from deliverance
from evils, and partly from the presence or hope of contrary good things.
Phil. 4. 7.

24. When it is joined with grace in the Apostles salutations, then it sets
forth all that felicity which is communicated to the faithful by the favor of
God.

25. Joy is that delight which is perceived from the conjunction, and communion
of the chief good.

26. Hence eternal life it self is called joy. Mat. 25. 21. John 15. 11.

27. The third degree is in partaking of the spiritual gifts of grace with
abundance, or overflowing. Col. 2. 2. 7. 10. With all riches of the full
assurance of understanding. Abounding in Faith: complete.

28. Hence the abundance of grace is said to minister a large entrance into the
Kingdom of God. 2 Peter 1. 8. 11.

29. The fourth degree is in experience of the good will or kindness of God.
Psalm. 31. 20. How great is thy goodness which thou do lay up for them that
fear thee? Psalm. 65. 5. We are satisfied with the goodness of thy House, with
the things of thy holy Temple.

30. Hither to pertains that fatherly providence of God whereby he watches
always over the faithful for good, as he watches over the wicked for evil:
in which respect, in Scripture the good Hand of God is said to be with his,
Nehem. 2. 8.

31. Hence all things work together for good to them that love God, Romans 8. 28.

32. From the sense of all these, the faithful are rooted, and grounded in the
love of God. Ephesians. 3. 17.

33. Perfect Glorification is in the taking away of all imperfection from soul
and body, and communication of all perfection.

34. This is granted to the soul immediately after the separation of it from
the body. 2 Cor. 5. Verse 2. Phil. 1. 23. Hebr. 2. 12. 23. But it is not
ordinarily granted to the soul and body jointly before that last Day, wherein
all the faithful shall be perfected together in Christ. Ephesians. 4. 13.
Philippians 3. 20. 21.

CHAPTER XXXI.
Of the Church mystically considered.

Thus much of the application of Redemption considered in it self: The subject
to which, and the manner by which this application is made, does follow.

1. THE Subject is the Church. Ephesians. 5. 25. 26. 27. Christ loved the Church, and
gave himself for it: that he might sanctify it being purified by him with the
washing of water through the Word: that he might make it to himself glorious,
that is, a Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
might be holy and unblameable: whence Election, Redemption, Vocation,
Justification, Adoption, Sanctification, and Glorification do in their
propriety belong to the same subject, that is, to the same singular men, which
make the Church. John 17. 9. 10. and 11. I pray for them; I pray not for the
World, but for them whom thou have given me, because they are thine, Romans 8.
29. 30. For whom he has fore-knowne, them he did predestinate, etc.

2. Yet the Church has so the consideration of a subject in respect of his
application, that it is also an effect of the same application: for it is not
first actually a Church, and afterward made partaker of Union and communion
with Christ; but because it is united to Christ, therefore it is the Church of
Christ.

3. And this is the reason why we can neither explain nor understand the
nature of the Church, unless those things which pertain to the application of
Christ, be first explained and perceived.

4. The elect before they be grafted into Christ are in themselves no otherwise
of the Church, then that power which in its own time shall certainly come into
act, by reason of Gods intention and his transaction with Christ: because that
remote power which is common to all men, in respect of the elect, is certainly
determined in God.

5. Therefore those orthodox Divines, which define the Church a company of
elect ones, do either by elect ones understand, those that are called
according to election; or, they define the Church not only as it does actually
exist, but also as it is to be hereafter.

6. That first thing which does make actually a Church is calling: whence also
it has taken both its name and definition.

7. For the Church is a company of men that are called. 1 Cor. 1. 24. With 10.
32. Called both Jews and Greeks. To the Jews, to the Greeks, and to the
Church of God. But because the end of calling is Faith, and the work of Faith
is ingrafting into Christ, and this Union with Christ, does bring with it
communion with Christ, hence it is defined, in the very same sense, a company
of believers, a company of those who are in Christ; and a company of those that
have communion with Christ.

8. But as Faith does so respect Christ, as that by Christ also it respects
God; so this Church, which does exist by Faith is both referred to Christ as to
the head, and by Christ unto God: whence the Church is called the body of
Christ. Col. 1. 24. And also the Church of God. 1 Cor. 10. 32. The Kingdom of
Christ. Colos. 1. 13. And the Kingdom of God, Romans 14. 17.

9. It is called a company: because it does consist properly in a multitude
joined in fellowship together, or a community of many, not in some certain one
that is called: whence Ephesians. 4. 16. It is called a body fitly joined and
compacted together, of diverse members, and by the same reason it is often
called in Scripture an House, a Family, a City, a Kingdom, a Flock, etc.

10. This company is restrained to men: because the good Angels, although in
some respect they pertain to the Church, by reason of that Union they have
with Christ, and the grace of conversation communicated by him, yet they are
not homogeneall members of the Church redeemed.

11. The form or constituting cause of this Church must needs be such a thing
which is found alike in all the called: but this can be nothing else then a
relation neither has any relation that force besides that that consists in a
chief and intimate affection to Christ: but there is no such in man besides
Faith: Faith therefore is the form of the Church.

12. For Faith as it is in every believer, distributively, is the form of
those that are called: but as it is considered in all collectively, it is the
form of the company of those that are called, that is the Church.

13. For the same, believing men, who being in several distributively,
considered are the called of God, are also the Church of God, as they are
jointly or collectively considered in a company.

14. Hence all those promises of God which are made to the Church in the
Scriptures, and do contain in themselves essential blessings, do also
pertain to every believer.

15. This relation is so near, that in respect of it, not only Christ is the
Churches, and the Church Christ's, Cant. 2. Verse 26. But also Christ is in the
Church, and the Church in him. John 15. Verse 4. 1 John 3. Verse 24. So that
the Church is mystically called Christ. 1 Cor. 12. 12. And the fullness of
Christ. Ephesians. 23.

16. Hence the Church by a metaphor is called the bride, and Christ the
Bridegroom: the Church a City, and Christ the King; the Church an House, and
Christ the House-holder; the Church the branches, and Christ the Vine: finally
the Church a body, and Christ the head.

17. But by these comparisons, there is signified not only the Union and
Communion which is between Christ and the Church, but also the way of order
whereby Christ is the beginning of all dignity, life, power, and perfection, to
the Church.

18. This Church is mystically one, not generally, but as it were the Species
Specialissima, or Individu^n: because it has no kind properly so called.

19. It is therefore called catholic, not as catholic signifies a Genus or
some general thing, but as it sets forth something integrally universal, (as
when we say the universal world) because it contains the faithful of all
Nations, of all places, and of all times.

20. Therefore no part of the Church can truly be called catholic, but as it
does profess that Faith which is the Faith of the catholic Church, in which
sense the Ancients, did not only call that part of the Church which was at
Rome, but other Churches also. As our Church at Francken, may be rightly called
catholic, as it does profess that Faith which belongs to the catholic Church.

21. The Church is divided into members according to the degrees of communion
which it has with Christ, in which respect it is called either Militant, or
Triumphant.

22. The Church militant is that which is partaker only of communion begun:
and so does wrestle as yet with enemies in the field of this World. 1 Cor. 13.
9. 12. We know in part, and prophecy in part: for we see now through a Glass
and darkly. 2 Cor. 10. 3. The weapons of our warfare. Ephesians. 6. 12. 13. We
wrestle, therefore take to you the whole Armor of God.

23. The Church triumphant is that which is already perfitted. Ephesians. 4. 13.
Until we all come to a perfect man, to the measure of the full stature of
Christ. 1 Cor. 15. After comes that which is perfect.

24. The militant Church is both invisible and visible, namely with outward
sight or sense.

25. But this distinction is not a distribution of the Genus into the Species,
as if so be there were one Church visible, and another invisible; nor of the
whole into the members, as if one part of the Church were visible, and another
invisible: but a distinction of the adjuncts of the same subject, because
invisibility is an affection or manner of the Church, in respect of the
essential, and internal form: visibility is an affection or manner of the
Church in respect of the accidental, and outward form.

26. The essential form is invisible: because it is both a relation, which
does not come into the sense, and also spiritual, and so removed more from
sense then in many other relations.

27. The accidentiall form is visible, because it is nothing else then an
outward profession of inward Faith, which may be easily perceived by sense.

28. This visible profession is that visible communion of the Saints which they
have with Christ, and among themselves.

29. The acts of communion with Christ are those visible acts, by which they
present themselves to God in Christ to receive his blessings, and to give the
glory of them to him.

30. The acts of communion among themselves are all those acts, by which they
study to do good each to other: but especially those which directly make to
further their communion with God in Christ.

31. Many acts of this latter kind are to be exercised also toward those who as
yet are not members of the Church: because by a certain power they are to be
judged to belong to it.

32. This Church as it is visible in it self, is in respect of others and
comparatively also distinguished into the Church lying hid, and manifest.

33. That which is manifest is when the number is greater, and the profession
more free and more public.

34. That which is hidden is when the number is less, and profession less
open: which is wont to come to pass by reason of heresies, persecutions, or
profane manners abounding abroad.

35. In the same respect also the Church is purer and impurer, as the
profession is more or less perfect.

36. But this profession does not depend upon confession only and preaching of
the Word, but also upon the receiving of it and religious obedience to it.

37. But although the Church be subject to such changes, and may leave any part
of the World, yet it has never totally falled, or shall fail from the
beginning of the gathering it to the end of the World.

38. For Christ must always have his Kingdom in the mids of his enemies,
until he shall make his enemies his foote-stoole.

39. Yea the Church does never wholly cease to be visible, for although
sometime there scarce appear a Church any where so pure, that one may fly unto
it in communion of the same worship in all things: yet the Church does in some
sort abide visible in that very impurity of worship and profession.

CHAPTER XXXII.
Of the Church Instituted.

1. THE Church as it lives upon Earth, although it be not wholly visible
together, yet it is visible in its parts, both dividedly in the several
members, and jointly in companies or Congregations.

2. The former visibility is by men's personal profession which does not make a
Church simply visible, but in certain members, or visible members of the
Church, although the Church in it self or in its integrall state is not
visible in the same place. Acts 19. 1. Paul came to Ephesus where he found
certain Disciples.

3. That visibility, which is in distinct companies or congregations, does not
only make a visible Church, but touching the outward form does make so many
visible Churches as there are distinct congregations. Revel. 1. 4. The seven
Churches. 2 Cor. 8. 1. 19. The Churches of Macedonia, all the Churches.

4. For those congregations are as it were similary parts of the catholic
Church, and so do partake both of the name and nature of it.

5. Therefore a particular Church in respect of that common nature which is
found in all particular Churches* is a Species of the Church in general, but
in respect of the catholic Church which has the respect of an whole, it is a
member compounded of diverse several members gathered together, and so in
respect of those members it is also an whole.

6. Such a congregation or particular Church is a society of believeres joined
together by a special band among themselves* for the constant exercise of the
communion of Saints among themselves.

7. It is a society of believers: because that same thing in profession does
make a Church visible, which by its inward and real nature does make a
mystical Church, that is, Faith.

8. But because true Faith has holiness joined with it, which it does
effectually work. Acts 15. 9. And so the profession of true faith cannot be
disjoined from the profession of holiness, therefore the Church is
promiscuously and in the same sense called, a society of believers, and of
Saints. Ephesians. 1. 1. To the Saints which are at Ephesus and faithful in Christ
Jesus. 1 Cor. 1. 2. compared with, 2 Cor. 1. 1. Romans 1. 7. Colos. 1. 2.

9. Hence visible and particular Churches also, by reason of this Faith which
they profess, are rightly said to be in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus
Christ. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 1. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 1.

10. It is also very probable that there is no such particular Church in which
the profession of the true Faith flourishes, but in the same also there are
found some true believers.

11. But those who are only believers by profession, so long as they remain
in that society are members of that Church, as also of the catholic Church as
touching the outward state, not touching the inward or essential state. 1 John
2. 19. They went out from us, but they were not of us.

12. Among believers there are to be accounted as members of the Church the
children of those believers who are in the Church. 1 Cor. 7. 14. Your children
are holy. For they are partakers of the same covenant, and the same profession
with their parents.

13. Yet infants are not so perfect members of the Church, as that they can
exercise acts of communion, or be admitted to partake of all the privileges
thereof, unless there do first appear an increase of Faith: but they are not
to be excluded from those privileges which pertain to the beginning of Fait
and entrance into the Church.

14. Believers do not make a particular Church, although peradventure many may
meet and live together in the same place, unless they be joined together by a
special bond among themselves: for so some one Church should often be
dissolved into many and manyal^o should be confounded into one.

15. This bond is a covenant, either express or implicit whereby believers
do particularly bind themselves, to perform all those duties, both toward God
and one toward another, which pertain to the respect and edification of the
Church.

16. Hence it is that in the old Testament we do for the most part so often
read of the renewing of their covenant, as there is related any solemn
reformation of the Church.

17. Hence none is rightly admitted into the Church, but by confession of Faith
and promise of obedience.

18. This joining together by covenant does only so far forth make a Church as
it respects the exercising the communion of Saints: for the same believing men
may join themselves in covenant to make a City or some civil society, as they
do immediately respect a common civil good, but they do not make a Church but
as in their constitution they respect holy communion with God among themselves.

19. Hence the same men, may make a City or politic society and not a Church;
or a Church, and not a City; or both a Church and a City.

20. Hence it is that those meetings that are formally Ecclesiastical, are
said to be had in the Name of the Lord. Math. 18. 20. 1 Cor. 5. 4.

21. Neither yet does some sudden joining together, and exercise of holy
communion suffice to make a Church: unless there be also that constancy, at
least in intention, which brings the state of a body, and members in a certain
spiritual polity.

22. This Cureh is instituded by God and by Christ, Heb. 3. 3. 4. He that
builded the House, for every House is built by some, and in this respect it
differs from the mystical Church, the gathering of which together into one is
not prescribed unto men, but performed immediately b^ divine operation, but the
gathering together into an instituted Church is so perfomed by God, that his
command and man's duty and labor do come between. Hebr. 10. 25. Not forsaking
the assembling our selves together.

23. But it is ordained by God and Christ only, because men have neither power
of themselves to institute, or frame a Church unto Christ, neither have they by
the revealed will of God any such power committed to them: their greatest
honor is, that they are servants in the House of God. Heb. 3. 5.

24. It is not therefore in the power of man either to take away any of those
things which Christ has granted to his Church, or to ad other to them of the
like kind: although he may and ought by all lawful means to provide, that
those things which Christ has ordained may be farthered, and confirmed.

25. But Christ has so instituted the Church, that it always depends upon
himself as upon the head, so that if it be distinctly considered without
Christ, it is not a complete body.

26. Hence the Church itself may not properly make new Laws to her self of
new things to be ordained, but thee ought only to care for this, that she do
well find out the will of Christ, and observe his ordinances in order and
decently, with greatest fruit of edification.

27. But because the ordinances of Christ have always a blessing of God joined
with them, therefore here are diverse promises of God made to the Church of the
presence of Christ. Mat. 18. 20. 1 Cor. 5. 4. So as in a special manner he is
said to be conversant and to walk in the Churches. Revel. 2. 1. Esaias 31. 9.
And of the presence of the Holy Spirit, Esaias 59. 21. So that a more ample and
certain blessing of God may be expected in the Church of God instituted, then
in any solitary life whatsoever.

28. They therefore that have opportunity to join themselves to the Church,
and neglect it, do more grievously sin, not only against God in respect of
ordinance, but also against their own soul in respect of the blessing
adjoined. And if they do obstinatly persist in their carelessenesse,
whatsoever they do otherwise profess, they can scarce be accounted for
believers truly seeking the Kingdom of GOD.

29. The profession of the true Faith is the most essential note of the Church.

30. This profession may in some company go before the solemn preaching of
the Word, and administration of the Sacraments.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
Of the extraordinary Ministers of the Church.

1. THus far of the subject of application. The manner of it follows.

2. The manner of applying consists in those things which are means of the
spirit applying Christ with all his benefits to us for our salvation.

3. The which spirit it self does apply all saving things unto us, internally
and most nearly, and so in his manner immediately, neither is any external
means capable properly of that virtue whereby grace may be really communicated
to us: Therefore though those do morally concur and operate in the
preparation of man to receive thie grace, yet they do not properly confer the
grace by themselves, but the spirit which works together with them. 1 Cor. 3.
7. Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that waters: but God who
gives power to increase.

4. The two principal means of this sort are the Ministry and the holy
Signs: unto which notwithstanding there is necessarily too be joined some
Ecclesiastical D^scipline.

5. The Ministry is an Ecclesiastical function whereby a man being chosen out
does dispense holy things of special right. 2 Cor. 4. 1. We have this
Ministry, as we have obtained mercy, 1 Cor 1. 2. Let a man so account of us as
of the Ministers of Christ, and dispensers of the Mysteries of God.

6. It is called a Ministry, because that power which is committed to
Ecclesiastical men, is a power of doing only by the command of Christ, and
mere obedience toward him. 1 Cor. 4. 1. 2.

7. A spiritual or regal power of government whereby one works of his own
liberty and will, is not belonging to men, but to Christ alone.

8. Hence a Minister of the Church is bound to execute his office by himself,
as one that has not power to appoint any vicar in his place, for this should
not be an action of obedience, but of command.

9. Therefore one that is a constant Minister of diverse Churches which are
necessarily to be provided for by Vicars, is not of Gods Ordaining, but of man's
ambition and presumption.

10. The power is not absolute, but relative, that is, it does not consist in
an absolute power to do any thing, but in a right, whereby one has power to
do that rightly and lawfully which he might not before so do, and therefore
it is Potestas juris, a power of right.

11. But it is of special right: because it respects some special duties
unlawful to others, and it does undertake some common duties in a certain
special manner.

12. The right of the Ministry depends upon calling, Heb. 5. 4. Neither does
any take this honor to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aron.

13. A calling is an action whereby an office is committed to any with
authority to Minister.

14. Therefore they are very ridiculous who do so ordain the calling of
Ministers, that they give them not power to preach the word, unless they have
some new grant.

15. A necessary adjunct of a calling is fitness to the Ministry.

16. Hence those who are altogether unfit to fulfill the Ministry, if they be
called to it by men, are the Ministers of men, not of God. Hos. 4. 6. Because
thou have despised knowledge, I will also despise thee, that thou shall not be
a Priest unto me.

17. This fitness arises from a fit measure of gifts, and a ready will to
undertake and execute the office.

18. From the Ministry there arises a third, staet of the Church: for as by
Faith it had its essential state, and by a combination its integrall state: so
also by the Ministry it has a certain organicall state: because it is now
made fit to exercise all those operations which pertain to the good of the
whole.

19. The course and direction of these operations, is Ecclesiastical polity.

20. The form of this polity is altogether monarchical in respect of Christ,
the head and King; but as toching the visible and vicarious administration, it
is of a mixed nature; partly as it were aristocraticall, and partly as it were
democraticall.

21. Hence in the lawful Ministry of the Church, Hierarchy holy principality
has no place, but rather Hieroduly, or holy Service.

22. Therefore one Minister is not subjected unto the power of another in his
dispensation, but all do immediately depend on Christ: as those Angels which
are inferiors in office to others, are immediately subject unto God, not to
other Angels.

23. This Ministry is either extraordinary or ordinary.

24. Extraordinary Ministry is that which has a certain higher, and more
perfect direction then can be attained to by ordinary means.

25. Hence such Ministers have always gifts and assistance extraordinary, so
that they do Minister without error.

26. The right of an extraordinary Minister is bestowed properly neither from
man, nor by man, but from God alone by Jesus Christ and the holy Spirit. Gal.
1. 1.

27. Hence the calling to such a Ministry is immediate.

28. Yet every etraordinary calling, is not so immediate that it excludes all
Ministry of men; as appears in the calling of Eliseus, and Matthias; but it
excludes only that Ministry which is destitute of an infallible direction.

29. This extrordinary Ministry was very necessary for the Church, because
that will of God which pertaines unto living well to God, could not be found
out by humane industry and ordinary means, as all other Arts and Sciences, but
it did require men stirred up and sent by God, to whom he has manifested his
will, that they might be to us in stead of God hemselfe. Exodus 4. 15, 16. And
be thou to him instead of GOD.

30. God has revealed his will to these extraordinary Ministers. 1. By lively
voice. Reg. 1. 10. Unto which was often added an apparition and speaking to of
an Angel or Christ himself, as of the Angel of his covenant. 2. By vision,
whereby together with the word the Species of the things to be declared were
represented to their eyes waking. 3. By dreams whereby such like things
propounded to the minds of them being a sleep. 4. Sometime also by a certain
special familiarity as it were mouth to mouth, without parable, Numb. 12. 6,
7, 8. If there be a Prophet among you, I will make my self Iehova known to
him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream. My servant Mosi^ is not
so: with him I speak mouth to mouth even apparently, and not in dark
speeches, and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold.

31. The manner of this revelation was so powerful, that its dis draw men
oftentimes into an ecstasy or trance, whereby they were so caught above
themselves, that they perceived nothing beside that that was propounded,
neither all that thing it self according to all its circumstances, 2 Cor. 13.
3. 4.

32. Yet it is so certain, that the divine truth of it is often confirmed, and
in a certain special manner sealed to them to whom it is revealed: so as it
need not another confirmation. Gal. 1. 17. and 2. 6. Neither did I return to
those who were Apostles before me. They who were in estimation added nothing to
me: Although sometimes also for the more abundant confirmation miracles are
added. Judge 6. 36. 37. 38.

33. This extraordinary Ministry is either for the first instituting of a
Church, or, for the special and extraordinary conservation of a Church, or
finally for the extraordinary restoring of a Church being fallen.

34. The Ministry of instituting a Church has always a testimony of miracles
joined with it: Heb. 2, 3, 4. Which at first began to be spoken, etc. God also
bearing them witness, with signs and wonders, and with diverse miracles, and
gifts of the holy Ghost according to his will.

35. Yet miracles do not so give testimony to the doctrine of any, as that it
may be presently believed. For that doctrine which does not consent with the
known will of God ought not to be admitted, although it seem to be confirmed
with miracles. Deuteronomy. 13. 1, 2, 3. Although that sign or wonder come to pass
which he soretold thee, saying, Let us go follow other Gods. Harken not to the
word of that Prophet. Gal. 1. 8. Though we or an Angel from Heaven, preach
another Gospel beside that we have preached, let him be accursed.

36. The Ministry of conserving, and restoring a Church, although it be
extraordinary, and is always confirmed by miracles, yet it does not always or
necessarily require a testimony of miracles: as appears in many in the old
Testament, and in John the Baptist.

37. Extraordinary Ministers were Prophets, Apostles, and Evangelists.

38. Wicliffe, Luther, Zwinglius, and such like, that were the first restorers
of the Gospel, were not to speak properly, extraordinary Ministers.

39. Yet they are not amiss called extraordinary by some. 1. Because they did
perform something like those things which were done by extraordinary Ministers
of old. 2. Because in respect of degree they received some singular gifts from
God, as occasion did require: which also may be affirmed of many among the more
famous Martyrs. 3. Because order at that time being disturbed and decayed, they
were of necessity to attempt some things out of the common course.

40. It is therefore ridiculous, to require miracles of those men, to confirm
that doctrine which they propounded; seeing such an attestation is not
necessary, no notin all extraordinary Ministers.

CHAPTER XXXIIII.
Of the holy Scripture.

1. EXtraordinary Ministers were raised up by God, to instruct the Church not
only by lively voice, but also by Divine writings, that there might be a
perpetual use, and fruit of this Ministry in the Church, even when such
Ministers were taken away.

2. For they only could commit the rule of Faith and manners to writing, who
by reason of the immediate and infallible direction which they had from God,
were in that business free from all error.

3. They received a command of writing from God, partly externally, both
generally when they were commanded to teach, and specially sometimes, when they
were commanded to write. Deuteronomy. 3. 19. Revel. 1. 19. Write ye the Song, write
those things which thou have seen, and partly by the inward instinct of the
spirit. 2 Pet. 1. 21. For prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but
holy men spoke as they were moved by the holy Spirit. 2 Timothy 2. 16. All
Scripture is inspired by God.

4. They wrote also by the inspiration and guidance of the holy Spirit, so that
the men themselves were as it were instruments of the spirit. In the place
before. Ierem. 1. 9. Behold I put my words in thy mouth. Acts 28. 25. Well
indeed spoke the holy Spirit by Esaias the Prophet.

5. But Divine inspiration was present with those writers with some variety,
for some things to be written were before altogether unknown to the writer, as
does sufficiently appear in the History of the Creation past, and in
foretellings of things to come: but some things were before known unto the
writer, as appears in the History of Christ, written by the Apostles: and some
of these they knew by a natural knowledge, and some by a supernatural: In
those things that were hidden and unknown, Divine inspiration did perform all
by it self: in those things which were known, or the knowledge where of might
be obtained by ordinary means, there was also added a religious study (God so
assisting them) that in writing they might not err.

6. In all those things which were made known by supernatural inspiration,
(whether they were matters of right, or fact) he did inspire not only the
things themselves, but did dictate and suggest all the words in which they
should be written: which notwithstanding was done with that sweet attempering,
that every writer, might use those manners of speaking which did most agree to
his person and condition.

7. Hence the Scripture is often attributed to the holy Spirit as to the
author, making no mention of the Scribes. Hebrews 10. 15. Whereof the Holy
Ghost also is a witness to us.

8. Hence also, although in the inscriptions of the holy Books it is for the
most part declared by whose labor they were written, yet there is sometimes
deep silence of this matter, and that without any detriment of such books, or
lessening their authority.

9. Neither yet does it suffice to make a part of holy writ, if a book be
written by some extraordinary servant of God, and upon certain direction of
the spirit: unless it be also publicly given to the Church by divine
authority, and sanctified to be a Canon or rule of the same.

10. The thing it self which they committed to writing, as touching the sum
and chief end of the matter, is nothing else, then that reveal will of God,
which is the rule of Faith and manners.

11. Hence all those things which in the first disputation were spoken of the
doctrine of life revealed from God, do properly agree to the holy Scripture.
For the Scripture is nothing else then that doctrine, with the manner of
writing joined to it, which manner was not to be handled there, but in this
place.

12. Hence the Scripture in respect of the thing and subject meaning, that is,
as it was the doctrine revealed from God, it was before the Church: but in
respect of the manner in which it is properly called Scripture, it is after the
first Church.

13. It is called the holy Scripture, and by (...) the Scripture, and the
writers themselves are called holy, partly in respect of the subject, and
object matter, which is so called, the true and saving will of God, and partly
in respect of that direction whereby it was committed to writing. Romans 1. 2.
Ephesians. 5. 5. 2 Pet. 1. 21. and 2. 22. and 3. 2. Rev. 18. 20.

14. But although diverse parts of the Scripture were written, upon some
special occasion, and were directed to some certain men, or assemblies: yet
in Gods intention, they do as well pertain to the instructing of all the
faithful thorough all ages, as if they had been specially directed to them,
whence, Heb. 12. The exhortation of Solomon, which is used in the Proverbs, is
said to be spoken to the Hebrews (who lived in the Apostles time,) as to
children, and 2 Pet. 3. 15. Paul is said to have wrote to all the faithful in
that he wrote to the Romans. Hebr. 13. 5. That which was said to Joshua is said
to be spoken to all the faithful.

16. All things which are necessary to salvation are contained in the
Scriptures, and also all those things which are necessarily required to the
instruction and edification of the Church. 2 Timothy 3. 15. 16. 17. The holy
Scriptures can make thee wise unto salvation, that the man of God might be
perfect, perfectly furnished to every good work.

16. Hence the Scripture is not a partial, but a perfect rule of Faith, and
manners: neither is here any thing that is constantly and every where necessary
to be observed in the Church of God, which depends either upon any tradition,
or upon any authority whatsoever and is not contained in the Scriptures.

17. Yet all things were not together and at once committed to writing, because
the state of the Church and the wisdom of God did otherwise require: but from
the first writing, those things were successively committed to writing which
were necessarily in those ages.

18. Neither did the Articles of Faith therefore increase according to
succession of times, in respect of the essence, but only in respect of the
explication.

19. As touching the manner of delivery, the Scripture does not explain the
will of God by universal, and scientificall rules, but by narrations,
examples, precepts, exhortations, admonitions, and promises: because that
manner does make most for the common use of all kind of men, and also most to
affect the will, and stir up godly motions, which is the chief scope of
Divinity.

20. Also the will of God is revealed in that manner in the Scriptures, that
although, the things themselves are for the most part hard to be conceived, yet
the manner of delivering and explaining them, especially in those things which
are necessary, is clear and perspicuous.

21. Hence the Scriptures need not especially in necessaries, any such
explication whereby light may be brought to it from something else: but they
give light to themselves, which is diligently to be drawn out by men, and to
be communicated to others according to their calling.

22. Hence also there is only one sense of one place of Scripture: because
otherwise the sense of the Scripture should be not only not clear and
certain, but none at all: for that which does not signify one thing,
signifies certainly nothing.

23. For the determining of controversies in Divinity, there is no visible
power as it were kingly or pretorian, appointed in the Church: but there is
laid a duty on men to enquire: there is bestowed a gift of discerning, both
publicly and privately: and there is commanded a desire to further the
knowledge and practice of the known truth according to their calling, unto
which also is joined a promise of direction, and blessing from God.

24. But because the Scriptures were given for the use and edification of the
Church, therefore they were written in those tongues, which mere most commonly
vulgar in the Church at that time when they were written.

25. Hence all those books which were written before the coming of Christ
were written in Hebrew, for to the Jews were committed the Oracles of God.
Romans 3. 2. and 9. 4. And upon lice reason they that were written afterward were
delivered in the Greek tongue, because that tongue was most common in those
parts were the Church did first flourish.

26. Hence there is some knowledge at least of these tongues necessary to the
exact understanding of the Scriptures: for the Scriptures are understood by the
same means that other humane writings are, many by the skill, and use of
Logic, Rethorick, Grammar, and those tongues in which they are expressed
except in this, that there is a singular light of the spirit always to be
fought for by the godly in the Scriptures.

27. Yet the Scripture is not so tied to those first tongues, but that it may
and ought also to be translated into other tongues, for the common use of the
Church.

28. But among interpreters, neither, those seventy, who turned it into Greek,
nor Hierome, nor any such like did perform the office of a Prophet, so that he
should be free from errors interpreting.

29. Hence no persons absolutely authentical, but so far forth only as they
do express the fountains, by which also they are to be tried.

30. Neither is there any authority in Earth whereby any version may be made
simply authentical.

31. Hence the providence of GOD in preserving the Fountains, has been
always famous, and to be adored, not only that they did not wholly perish, but
also that they stould not be maimed by the loss of any book, or deformed by
any grievous fault, when in the mean while there is no one of the ancient
versions that remains whole.

32. Nevertheless, from those humane versions there may be all those things
perceived which are absolutely necessary, if so be they agree with the
fountains in the essential parts, as all those versions that are received in
the Churches are wont to do, although they differ, and are defective in the
smaller things not a few.

33. Neither therefore must we always rest in any version that is received:
but we must most religiously provide, that the most pure and faultlesse
interpretation be put upon the Church.

34. Of all those books, being delivered from God, and placed, as it were in
the Chest of the Church, there is made up a perfect Canon of Faith and manners,
whence also they have the name of Canonical Scripture.

35. The Prophets made the Canon of the old Testament, and Christ himself
approved it by his Testimony. The Canon of the new Testament together with the
old, the Apostle John approved and sealed up being furnished with Divine
authority. Rev. 22. 18, 19. For I do witness together to every one that
hears the words of the prophesy of this book: if any shall ad to these, God
shall lay upon him the plagues written in this book: and if any shall take
away any thing from the books of his prophecy, God shall take away this part
out of the book of life.

36. Those books which commonly we call apocryphal, do not pertain to the
divine Canon, neither were they rightly enough joined by men of old to the
canonical books, as a certain secundary Canon: for first in some of them
there are manifest fables told and affirmed for true Histories as of Tobith,
Judith, Susanna, Bell, the Dragon, and such like. Secondly, because they
contradict both the sacred Scripture and themselves. Oftentimes Thirdly, they
were not written in Hebrew, nor delivered to the Jewish Church or received by
it, to which notwithstanding God committed all his Oracles before the coming
of Christ. Romans 9. 4. Fourthly they were not approved by Christ, because they
were not among those books which he set forth when he commanded his to search
the Scriptures. Fifthly, they were never received either by the Aostles or the
first Christian Church as a part of the Divine Canon.

CHAPTER XXXV.
Of ordinary Ministers, and their Office in Preaching.

1. ORdinary Ministry is that which has al its direction from the will of God
revealed in the Scriptures, and from those means which God has appointed in
the Church, for the perpetual edification of the same.

2. And hence they are called ordinary: because they may and are wont to be
called to Minister by order appointed by God.

3. But because in their administration they have that Will of God which was
before revealed by extraordinary Ministers for a fixed rule unto them,
therefore they ought not to propound or do any thing in the Church which they
have not prescribed to them in the Scriptures.

4. Therefore also they depend upon extraordinary Ministers, and are as it were
their successors: for although in respect of manner and degree exraordinary
Ministers have no successors; yet in respect of the essence of administration,
ordinary Ministers perform the same office toward the Church as extraordinary
did of old.

5. The right of his Ministry is wont to be communicated by men, and in that
respect the calling of an ordinary Minister is mediate.

6. But this is so to be understood, that the authority of administering Divine
things is immediately communicated from God to all lawful Ministers, and the
appointing of persons upon which it is bestowed is done by the Church.

7. But because the Church can neither confer gifts necessary for this
Ministry nor prescribe unto God upon whom he should bestow them, therefore she
can only choose those whom before she sees fitted, for not as extraordinary
Ministers, so also ordinary are made fit by their very calling, when they were
unfit before.

8. Hence in an ordinary calling it is necessarily required that a lawful
trial go before the calling it self. 1 Timothy 3. 10. Let them be first tried,
then let them Minister if they be blameless.

9. Ordinary Ministry is for the preserving, propagating, and restoring the
Church by ordinary means.

10. There are two parts of this Ministry. 1. That in the Name of God he do
those things which are to be done with the people. 2. That in the name of the
people he do those things with God which are to be done with him.

11. But in these the preaching of the Word does most excel, and so it has
been always of perpetual use in the Church.

12. The duty of an ordinary preacher is to propound the Will of God out of the
Word, unto the edification of the hearers. 1 Timothy 1. 5. The end or preaching is
love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.

13. But because there is chiefly required a serious desire to edify the
Church, therefore he cannot be a fit preacher, who has not prepared his heart
to seek the Law of the Lord, and to keep it, and to teach Israel the statutes
and judgments. For he that teaches another ought before and when he teaches,
to teach himself. Romans 2. 21. Otherwise he is not fitted to edify the Church.

14. This duty is to be performed not only universally in respect of all the
hear (...) in common, but also specially in respect of order and age
whatsoever, as of old men, young men, servants. Tit. 2. and 3. Of teachers, 2
Pet. 1. 12. etc. Yea of every one. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 11. We exhorted, and comforted,
and charged every one of you, not publicly only, but privately also. Acts 20.
20. Publicly, and from house to house.

15. He ought to have this scope of edifying so always before his eyes, that
he diligently take heed (...) turn not aside from it, to vain laughing. 1 Timothy 1. 6. To striving about words. 2. Tim. 2. 14. To unprofitable
controversies, or speculations of science falsely so called. 1 Kin. 6. 20. But
show himself to be an holder fast of the faithful word which tends unto
doctrine. Tit. 1. 9. And which cannot be condemned, Tit. 2. 8.

16. But because the Will of God is to be propounded out of his Word, to this
end therefore he is not fit for his Ministry, who has not his senses
exercised in the holy Scriptures, even beyond the common sort of believers, so
that he might be said to be with Apollos mighty in the Scriptures. Acts 18. 24.
He must not trust to Postils and Commentaries.

17. That the Will of God may be propounded with fruit of edification these two
things, are necessary to be done. 1. That a declaration be made of those things
that are contained in the Text. 2. That application of the same be addressed to
the consciences of the hearers as their condition does seem to require. 1 Timothy
6. 17. Charge those that are rich in this World that they be not high minded,
nor rust in uncertain riches etc.

18. They deceive their hearers, and altogether forget themselves, who propound
a certain text in the beginning, as the beginning of the Sermon to be had, and
afterward do speak many things about the text or by occasion of the text, but
for the most part draw nothing out of the text it self.

19. In declaring what truth there is in the text, first it ought to be
explained, and then afterward what good does follow from thence. That part is
spent in doctrines, or documents, this in use or derivation of profit from
those doctrines. 2. Tim. 3. 16. All the Scripture is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, and instruction in righteousness.

20. They who invert and confound those parts, do not provide for the memory
of their hearers, and do not a little hinder their edification: because they
cannot commit the chief head of the Sermon to memory, that they may afterward
repeat it privately in their families without which exercise the greatest part
of that fruit does perish which would by Sermons redound unto the Church of God.

21. Doctrine is a Theological Axiom, either consisting in the express word
of Scripture, or flowing from them by immediate consequence.

22. A doctrine must first be rightly found out, and then afterward handed.

23. The finding it out is by Logic Analysis, unto which Retoricke also and
Grammar serves.

24. Analysis depends chiefly upon the observation of the scope, or purpose and
the means by which it is attained, according to the act of Logic.

25. Unto this must be subjoyned for confirmation the interpretation of those
things which are doubtful in the Analysis: but manifest things, and such as
are perspicuous of themselves do neither require, nor admit a needelesse
interpretation.

26. Handling (of a doctrine) does partly consist in proving, if it may be
questioned by the hearers, (for it is unfit carefully to confirm that which
all acknowledge) and partly in illustration of the thing sufficiently proved.

27. Proving ought to be taken out of the more clear testimonies of Scripture,
reasons also being added where the nature of the thing will suffer. But here
that measure is to be kept, which the commodity of the hearers, will dictate.

28. Illustration may be drawn almost from all places of invention, b^
dissentaneous, and comparate arguments have here the chief place.

29. Every doctrine being now sufficiently explained must presently be brought
to use, in which part also, unless some special reason do otherwise require,
we must most insist: because it contains the end and good of the other, and is
more joined with the chief scope of the Sermon, namely the edification of the
hearers.

30. They fail therefore who stick to a naked finding out and explication of
the truth and neglecting use and practice, in which Religion and so
blessedness does consist, do little or nothing edify the conscience.

31. Neither yet are all the doctrines which may be drawn out of the text, to
be propounded, nor all the uses to be inculcated, but those are to be chosen
out which the circumstances of place, time and persons, shall teach to be most
necessary, and of those such especially are to be chosen which make most to
stir up or confirm the life of Religion.

32. They fail therefore, who care not much what they say: so they may seem
to have observed, and spoken many things: nay they do this not seldom, that
they may extort many things out of the text which are not in it, and oftentimes
draw from other places unto it, bringing every thing out of many things whereby
indeed the subversion rather then the edification of the hearers, especially
those that are more unskilful, does follow.

33. Both doctrine and use as much as may be ought so to be framed, that they
may have some connection among themselves, and do also show it. For the mind
is not drawn from one thing to another without disprofit: neither is there any
thing does more help memory then order of deduction.

34. An use is a Theological Axiom, drawn from the doctrine, showing the
profit goodness or end of it.

35. The reason of the deduction is to be opened, if it be not very plain:
unto which also must be subjoyned probation, or illustration, as the necessity
of the hearers, and prudence of the speaker shall advise.

36. This use either pertaines to the judgment, or to practice. 2 Timothy 3. 16.

37. In the judgment there is Information, and Reformation of the mind.

38. Information is the proving of some truth.

39. Reformation is the confutation of some error.

40. But although every truth may be taught upon occasion, yet every error is
not every where to be refuted. For old heresies which are already buried, are
not to be dug up again that they may be refuted* neither are wicked
blasphemies easily to be repeated: this does trouble and offend, especially
when they are solemnly nominated, explained, and refuted:

41. In practice of life there is direction, which consists of instruction and
correction.

42. Iustruction is a demonstration of that life that is to be followed.

43. Correction is a condemning of that life that is to be shunned.

44. After declaration, application ought to follow, which has so great
agreement with derivation of uses, that it may often be mingled with it.

45. To apply a doctrine to his use, is so to whet and put on some general
truth with special accommodation; as it may pierce into the minds of such as
are present, with a moving of godly affections.

46. Men are to be pricked to the quick, that they may feel in every one of
them that of the Apostle, namely that the Word of the Lord is a two edged
sword, that pierces into the inward thoughts and affections, and goes through
unto the joining together of the bones and the marrow. Preaching therefore
ought not to be dead, but lively and effectual, so that an unbeliever coming
into the Congregation of the faithful he ought to be affected, and as it were
dug through with the very hearing of the Word, that he may give glory to
God. 1 Cor. 14. 25. And so the hidden things of his heart are made manifest:
and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and say that God is in
you indeed.

47. But this application does either respect a mind oppressed, as
consolation, or fainting in the prosecution of good, as exhortation; or in
avoiding of evil, as admonition.

48. Consolation is the application of some argument, either to take away, or
to mitigate grief and oppressing fear.

49. In consolation, marks are profitably joined, by which the conscience of a
man may be assured that such a benefit portaines to him, with the consideration
of which the Minister does comfort the consciences of believers, adding
occupations, and refutations of such things as a pions and troubled mind may
bring and think of to the contrary.

50. Exhortation is the application of an argument, either to beget, cherish,
and excite some inward virtue, or to further the exercise of it.

51. In exhortation to virtue it is very profitable to show the means which
do tend to the begetting that virtue in us, but let all be proved by places of
Scripture and examples, or by reasons which have a firm foundation in the
Scriptures.

52. Admonition is the application of an argument to correct some vitiousnesse.

53. In admonition, or dehortation from vice, there may be remedies adjoined
out of those places which are most like to prevail against those vices.

54. The manner of working in all these must be such that it have no
ostentation of humane wisdom, or an entermingling of carnal affections, but
the demonstration of the spirit every where manifested. 1 Cor. 1. 17. and c. 2.
1. 4. 13. Not with skill of speaking, least the Cross of Christ should be made
of none effect. Not with excellency of speech or wisdom: not in parswading
words of men's wisdom, but in spiritual and powerful demonstration. Not in
words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the holy Spirit teaches, for it
is the word of the spirit, the word of life which is preached to edification of
God which is by Faith: unto which if any thing be not fitly spoken or done, it
is as vain as hay and stuble. 1 Cor. 3. 12.

55. Therefore neither ought humane testimonies whatsoever they be, nor
Histories known only to the learned to be intermingled, unless very seldom
(the cause also being signified which constrains so to do) when urgent
necessity, or certain hope of fruit does seem to require such a thing, much
less words or sentences of Latin, Greek, or Hebrew, which the people do not
understand.

56. The purity, perfection, and majesty of the word of God is violated, whilst
it seems to want the mixture of humane words, and withal there is a scandal
given to the hearers, who being accustomed to such humane flourishes,
oftentimes, contracting it ching ears, do begin to loathe, the simplicity of
the Gospel, and will not suffer wholesome doctrine. 2 Timothy 4. 3.

57. The example of Paul (who cites a very few, and brief sayings of heathen
Poets, not naming the Authors, to convince the Gentiles to whom they were known
and approved, and that very seldom, and but by the way) this example I say
does nothingh enforce that necessity or profit, which they urge, who do
obtrude humane testimonies frequently, and of purpose, commen ding the authors
with the same solemnity almost wherewith they use to cite the names of the
prophets, and that among Christians, who do only desire to hear Christ, to
the end to show forth some learning.

58. Neither also are unnecessary, and far fetched Proems, or persuasive words
of Orators to be followed: neither must they love digressions, or excusions.
They do savor an humane spirit, spend time, and shut out other things which
would more edify.

59. But if there be used any Exordium, pertaining to the present matter, that
has his proper place, either in the declaration of the text or applying it to
use.

60. The speech and action ought to be wholly spiritual flowing from the very
heart, showing a man much conversant in exercises of piety who also has before
persuaded himself, and troughly settled in his conscience, those things which
he endeavors to persuade others to: into which finally there is Zeal,
Charity, Mildness, Freedom, Humility, whit grove authority.

61. The pronouncing of the speech must be both natural, familiar, clear, and
distinct, that it may be fitly understood: as also agreeable unto the matter
that it may alsoo move the affections. Gal. 4. 20. I would now be present with
you, and change my voice: because I am in doubt of you.

62. Among others here are two voices most to be blamed: the one which is
heavy, slow, singing, drousie, in which not only the words in the same
distinction, of a comma, are separated with a pause, but even the syllables in
the same word, to the great hinderance of the understanding of things.

63. The other voice which does here most offend is that which is hasty and
swift, which overturnes the ears with too much celerity so, that there is no
distinct perceiving of things.

64. That speech pronountiation and action which would be ridiculous in the
senate in places of judgment, in the Court, that is more to be avoided in a
Sermon.

65. The efficacy of the holy Spirit does more clearly appear in a naked
simplicity of words, then in elegancy and neatness: hence Paul says that he
was (...) rude in speech. 2 Cor. 11. 6. Yet if any have a certain outward
force of speaking, he ought to use it with Genuine simplicity.

66. So much affectation as appears, so much efficacy and authority is lost.

67. The sum is, that nothing is to be admitted which does not make for the
spiritual edification of the people, neither any thing to be omitted whereby
we may in a sure way attain to that end.

68. An appendix of the Sermon is Prayer, both before and after.

69. In Prayer going before, those general things ought to be propounded,
whereby the end and use of the word and preaching, and our wants,
unworthiness, and duty, together with the gracious promises of GOD may be so
brought to remembrance, that the minds of all may be stirred up humbly to
seek, and faithfully to observe the Will of God.

70. In Prayer following after, giving of thanks is always to be used, and
the chief heads of the Sermon should be turned into petitions.

CHAPTER XXXVI.
Of the Sacraments.

Thus much of the manner of application, in the first part of it, namely in the
Ministry.

1. THe manner of application in the other part of it is in the signs.

2. A sign is a sensible thing which besides that show it carries immediately
to the senses, makes another thing withal come into the mind: and in this
sense the consideration of a sign is as large as of a Logical argument.

3. Signs are some natural, some by institution.

4. Yet between these two there is so great difference, that they cannot be
confounded without foul error.

5. There is also a sign ordinary and perpetual, and another extraordinary
and temporary.

6. In respect of the thing signified, it is either of things past, and it is
called (...) Rememor^wn, A sign of remembrance: or of things present, and its
called (...) Demonstrativum, a demonstrative sign: of things to come, and it
is called (...) Praenunciativum, a foretelling sign; or finally consisting of
all these, so as it sets forth things present, past, and to come.

7. In respect of the end and use, it either serves for the understanding, and
is called Notificans a notefying sign; or the memory, and is called
Commonefacions, a^ admonishing sign; or for Faith also, and is called
Obsignans, a Sealing sign, or lastly for all these together.

8. Hence an holy Sign is either a bare sign, or a seal also.

9. A bare sign is that which only represents: a seal is that which not
only represents, but also exhibiteth by sealing.

10. A seal sealing the Covenant of God is called a Sacrament, Romans 4. 11.

11. For it is a sign, of remembrance, demonstrating, foretelling, notifying,
admonishing, and sealing.

12. A Sacrament therefore of the new Covenant is a Divine institution, whereby
by sensible signs, the blessings of the new Covenant are represented,
exhibited and applied.

13. Hence such a Sacrament has the respect of a secondary Divine testimony,
whereby that primary testimony which is contained in the Covenant it self, is
specially confirmed in respect of us.

14. Hence that special application of the favor and grace of God, which
arises from true Faith, is very much confirmed and furthered by the Sacraments.

15. In a Sacrament therefore there is a sensible thing, and a spiritual.

16. The sensible thing is a sign either representing, or applying: the
spiritual thing is that which is represented and applied.

17. Yet by the name of a Sacrament, usually and most properly the outward and
sensible thing it self is wont to be set forth.

18. The Sacramental sign has not that spiritual thing to which it is
referred either physically inhering or adhering; for so the sign and thing
signified should be together.

19. Neither yet are they bare declaring and representing signs, but
communicating the thing it self, testifying, and exhibiting the thing to be
more communicated.

20. Hence none can institute such an holy sign, but God only: because no
Creature can bestow the thing signified, or make the communication of it
certain to us, or finally ad that virtue to such signs, whereby they may be
made fit to confirm Faith, and Confidence, or to stir up any spiritual grace
in us, more then any other thing.

21. The thing it self which is set apart and separated to such an holy use,
is properly called a representing sign, as Bread and Wine in the supper, but
the use of these things is called an applying sign; as distributing,
receiving, eating, drinking.

22. Hence Sacraments do not properly exist out of their use, that is neither
before, nor after they are applied to their use, are they indeed Sacraments.

23. The spiritual thing which is signified by the Sacraments of the new
covenant is the new covenant it self, that is, Christ with all those blessings
which in him are prepared for the faithful.

24. Yet some Sacraments do more expressly represent a manner or some respect
of his Covenant, then others, which do also more set forth some other manner

25. But all have this common, that they seal the whole Covenant of grace, to
the faithful; neither have they this use at that only time whilst they are
administered, but to the end of life.

26. The form of a Sacrament is that union which is between the sign, and
things signified.

27. This union is not corporal, neither yet is it imaginary, but it is a
spiritual relation by virtue whereof the things signified are really
communicated to these, who do rightly use the signs.

28. For neither do all those partake the spiritual thing it self, who are
made partakers of the signs, neither is there the same manner and means of
partaking both.

29. From this Union follows a communication of Praedication, whereby First,
the sign is predicated of the thing signified, as when Sanctification of the
heart is calling circumcision. 2. The thing signified of the sign, as when
circumcision is called the Covenant, and bread the body. 3. The effect of the
thing signified is predicated of the sign, as when Baptism is said to
regenerate. 4. A property of the sign is predicated of the thing signified, as
when breaking which agrees to the Bread is attributed to Christ. 5. A property
of the thing signified is attributed to the sign, as when sacramental eating
and drinking is called spiritual.

30. The foundation of this relation arifeth, First, from the similitude or
proportion of the sign to the thing signified: for such a likeness although
it do not make a Sacrament, yet it is required before to those things which do
make a Sacrament, and is laid as a foundation to them. Secondly, from the word
of institution, which consists of a command and a promise. The command does
impose a duty of using the Creatures to that holy end. The promise does give us
to believe that we shall not so use them in vain. But this word of institution
distinctly applied with fit prayers, is called the word of consecration, of
blessing, the word of sanctification, and separation. 3. It is perfited with
observation, and the use it self prescribed, of which here is so great force,
that for default of it that is not a Sacrament to this or that person, being
present in body or receiving, which to others is most effectual.

31. The primary end of a Sacrament is to seal the covenant, and that not on
Gods part only, but consequently also on ours, that is, not only the grace of
God, and promises are sealed to us, but also our thankfulness and obedience
toward God.

32 Therefore mystical signs of holy things cannot be instituted by man,
without prejudice and violation of the Sacraments, although they do set forth
man's duty only.

33. For although such signs are not properly Sacraments, yet they are signs
Sacramental, that is, they partake the nature of Sacraments and so cannot be
instituted by man.

34. A secondary end is profession of Faith and love: for there are represented
in the use of the Saraments, both that union which we have with God in Christ,
and that communion which we hold with all those who are partakers of the same
union, especially with those who are members of the same Church.

CHAPTER XXXVII.
Of Ecclesiastical Discipline.

An adjunct of the Word and Sacraments is Discipline: which in respect of the
sum of the matter has been always one, and so may fitly be handled in this
one place.

1. HOly Discipline is a personal application of the Will of God by censures,
either for the preventing, or taking away of scandals out of the Church of God.

2. For in the preaching of the Word, the Will of God is propounded and really
applied to beget and increase Faith and obdience. In the administration of the
Sacraments, the Will of God is also personally applied by the seals, to
confirm Faith and obdience. In the exercise of Discipline, the Will of God is
personally also applied in the censures for the removing of those vices, which
are contrary to Faith and Obedience.

3. Hence it is that Discipline is wont to be joined with the Word and
Sacraments by the best Divines, in the notes of the Church, for though it be
not a note simply essential and reciprocal (as neither the other two) yet it
ought necessarily to be present to the complete estate of a Church.

4. This Discipline is ordained and prescribed by Christ himself. Mat. 16. 19.
and 18. 15, 16, 17. And so is plainly of Divine right: neither may it be taken
away, diminished, or changed by men at their pleasure.

5. Nay the sins against Christ's, the author, and ordainer, whosoever does not
so much as in him is to establish and promote this Discipline in the Churches
of God.

6. The persons about whom it ought to be exercised, are the members of visible
instituted Churches, without any exception. Mat. 18. 15. 1 Cor. 11. And not
others: There Verse. 12. For it pertaines to them, and only them that have right
to partake of the Sacrament.

7. Unto those persons it applies the Will of God, that is, those means of
spiritual reformation, such as Christ only has given to his Churches. 2 Cor.
10, 4. Therefore punishments and vexations to be endured by the body or purse,
have no place at all in Ecclesiastical Discipline.

8. It respects sins and scandalls in those persons: for it is an wholesome
healing plaster of those wounds and diseases to which the sheep of Christ are
subject. 1 Cor. 5. 5.

9. It forbids and takes away those offenses: because it does effectually and
personally apply the Will of Christ, the impugning and abolishing of them.

10. But because it does so effectually urge obedience toward Christ, therefore
not without singular reason a great part of the Kingdom of Christ, as he does
visibly govern the Church, is placed by the best Divines in this Disciplines.

11. And this is the true reason why the Discipline of Christ is solidly
constituted and exercised together with doctrine in so few Churches, because
most even of those who would seem to knew Christ, and to hope in him, do
refuse to receive the whole Kingdom of Christ, and to yield themselves wholly
to him.

12. But as it is a part of the Kingdom of Christ, so also it is by the same
reason a part of the Gospel: for it is an holy manner of promoting the Gospel
ordained in the Gospel: They therefore who reject Discipline, do neither
receive the whole Kingdom of Christ, nor the whole Gospel.

13. But because both every part of the Kingdom of Christ is necessary in its
measure, and that chiefly which does repress sin, effectually, therefore men
do not safely enough content themselves, in Churches wanting Discipline,
unless that public defect be made up by a private care, and watching one over
another.

14. The parts of this Discipline are brotherly correction, and excommunication.

15. For it does not either only or chiefly consist in the thunderclaps of
Excommunications and Anathem^is, but chiefly in Christian correction.

16. Neither is the proper end of reproof that there might be then an entance
made to Excommunication (although by accident that sometimes do follow) but
that the necessity of Excommunicating if it can be, might be prevented, and the
sinner may be by timely repentance retained in the Church.

17. Correction, increpation or admonition, ought to be used in every sin
unto which the midicine of Discipline agrees, yet in a diverse manner according
to be difference of the sin secret, and known. For in hidden sins, those three
degrees are to be observed which Christ has in order prescribed. Mat. 18. 15.
16. 17. But in public sins such a gradation is not necessary, 1 Timothy 5. 20.

18. These admonitions ought always to be taken out of the word of God, not
out of men's decrees: otherwise they will not pierce to the conscience.

19. A plenary excommunication is not to be used, unless contumacy be added to
the sin. Mat. 18. 17. For the sinner rightly admonished, of necessity must
appear penitent, or obstinate, but the penitent is not to be excommunicated,
therefore only he that is obstinate.

20. Yet in the more heinous offenses so much patience and delay is neither
necessary nor profitable, to expect repentance, and to the discerning of
contumacy, as in more usual faults.

21. When the thing it self may suffer delay, it is agreeable to Scripture and
reason, that excommunication be first begun by suspension or abstension from
the Supper, and such like privileges of the Church, which is wont to be called
the lesser excommunication.

22. Yet we must not stay in this degree, but by this means and in this space
repentance is to be urged, and there being no hope of it, we must proceed at
length to a complete severing from the Communion of the faithful, which is
wont to be called the greater Excommunication.

23. But because an obstinate sinner cannot be separated from the faithful,
unless the faithful be separated from him, and this also makes for their
wholesome shame. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 14. Therefore they who are lawfully excommunicated
are to be avoided of all Communicants, not in respect of duties simply moral,
or otherwise necessary, but in respect of those parts of conversation which are
wont to accompany approbation and inward familiarity. Os, orare, vale, conviva,
mensa, negat^.
With the secluded, neither confer, nor pray,
Salute, nor feast, nor eath with day by day.


24. From the bond Excommunication none that is not penitent ought to be
loosed, neither ought it to be denied to any that is penitent. But it is not a
sufficient repentance, if one say it repent me, I will do so no more, and do
not otherwise show true Repentance: but such judgments, of serious repentance
ought to appear as the Church is bound to be, satisfied in them: otherwise
hyprocrisie is nourished, and the Church is mocked, and Christ himself.

25. Yet in some sins a weak repentance (so it appear true) may be admitted
them in other sins.

26. The power of this Discipline in respect of the right it self pertaines to
that Church in common, whereof the offender is a member, for it pertaines to
her to cast out to whom it belongs to admit at first: and the conservation or
cutting off of members concerns the whole body equally: it is therefore to be
committed to execution with the consent of the Church (and that not only the
Church permitting, but also approving and appointing.)

27. Yet the Elders have the chief parts, in the acting and exercise of it.
And that not only in directing the public action, and pronouncing sentence,
but also in admonitions foregoing, in which they must make up that which they
see was neglected by private persons.

28. The usual censures of the Popes, of pontifical Bishops and their
officers, do themselves deserve a grievous censure: for they are prophanations
of the Name of God, props of an injust government, and snares to catch other
men's money, not spiritual remedies of such sins.

29. Indulgences, Commutations, and humane transactions, in those things unto
which Christ has ordained the Discipline of the Church, are wages of the great
Whore.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
Of the administration of the Covenant of grace before the coming of Christ.

1. ALthough the free, and saving Covenant of God has been only one from the
beginning, yet the manner of the application of Christ or of administering this
new Covenant, has not always been one and the same, but diverse, according to
the ages in which the Church has been gathered.

2. In this variety here has been always a progress from the more
imperfect, to the more perfect.

3. First therefore the mystery of the Gospel was manifested generally and more
darkly, and then more specially and more clearly.

4. This manner of administering is double: one of Christ to be exhibited, and
the other of Christ exhibited.

5. For the old and New Testament are reduced to these two primary heads: the
old ^miseth Christ to come, the New testifies that he is come.

6. Whilst Christ was to be exhibited, all things were more outward and
carnal, afterward more inward and spiritual John 1. 17. The Law was delivered
by Moses, grace and truth came by Christ.

7. Yet at that time there was a double consideration of the Church. 1. As an
heir, and 2. as it was an infant. Galatians 4. 1. and following: So long as
the heir is an infant, he nothing differs from a servant, though he be Lord
of all.

8. As an heir it was free: as an infant it was in a certain manner servile.
Ther^

9. As an heir it was spiritual: as an infant carnal, and earthly. Heb. 9.
10. Romans 9. 7.

10. As an heir it had the spirit of adoption, as an infant the spirit of
fear, and bondage. Romans 8. 15. Ye have not received the spirit of bondage
again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of Adoption.

11. The manner of administration which respects Christ to be exhibited was one
before Moses, and another from Moses to Christ.

12. Before Moses the polity of the Church was rude and loose, as being in
infancy: there were so many visible Churches as there were Families of godly
persons: the Ministry was almost always extraordinary by Prophets: the
masters of Families, and first borne had right to administer some holy things,
as ordinary Ministers, according to that direction which they received from the
Prophets.

13. Yet there were some difference of the dispensation from Adam to Abraham,
and from that which was after Abraham, until Moses.

14. From Adam to Abraham, First, Redemption by Christ, and the application of
him was promised in general, to be performed by a seed of the Woman, to loose
the works of the Devil, that is, sin and death. Genesis 3. 15. Romans 1^ ^0. 1
John 3. 8. The seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents head. The God of
peace shall tread Satan under your feet shortly. The Son of God was manifested
to dissolve the works of the Devil.

15. 2. Calling was exercised in that distinction which was between the seed of
the Woman and the seed of the Devil, between the sons of God and the sons of
men. Genesis 6. 2. 3. The way of justification was set forth by expiatory
sacrifices offered and accepted for sins. Ephesians. 5. 2. Christ has loved us and
given himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a swee^ smelling
savor.

16. 4. Adoption was declared both by the title of sons at that time common to
all the faithful, and by the translation of Enoch into the Heavenly
inheritance. Genesis 5. 24. Hebr. 11. 5.

17. 5. Sanctification was both expressly inculcated by the Prophets and
typically shadowed out by oblations and rites of sacrifices. Iud. 14. Romans 12.
1.

18. 6. Glorification, was publicly sealed both by the example of Enoch, and
conversation of Noach with his family from the flood. 1 Pet. 3. 20. 21.

19. In this period of time the building and conserving of the Arc in the
flood, was an extraordinary Sacrament. Heb. 11. Verse. 7. 1 Pet. 3. 20. and 21.
There was no ordinary Sacrament: but that in many sacrifices here was something
that had the respect of a Sacrament: for in that those that did sacrifice for
the most part were made partakers of their sacrifices in an holy banquet, in an
holy place with joy before God. Exodus 18. 12. This did seal to them in some
sort that grace of the Covenant which is exhibited in the Sacraments.

20. From the time of Abraham the Church did chiefly consist in his family and
posterity.

21. In that period of time all the benefits of the new Covenant were more
clearly and distinctly set forth then before.

22. 1. Election was represented in the persons of Isaac and Jacob, beloved
before Ismael and Esau. Romans 9. 11. 12. 13.

23. 2. Redemption together with the application of it was most excellently
exhibited in the person and blessing of Melchisedeck, also in the promise and
covenant of blessing to come to all Nations by the seed of Abraham.

24. 3. Calling was exercised by leading forth Abraham out of Vr of the Caldees
to a certain new and heavenly Country, Heb. 11. 8. 9. 10.

25. 4. Justification was illustrated by the express testimony of God, that
Faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness, as the Father and pattern of
all that should believe, and by the Sacrament of circumcision, which was a
seal of the same righteousness.

26. 5. Adoption was set forth by calling of the Name of God upon Abraham and
all the sons of the promise, and by assigning of the inheritance to the sons of
the promises begotten of the free Woman, through grace. Galatians 4. 26. 28. 31.

27. 6. Sanctification was figured by circumcision which did set forth the
taking away and abolishing of the corruption of sin and of the old man, that a
new Creature might be settled in its place. Col. 2. 11. Deuteronomy. 30. 6.

28. 7. Glorification was showed in the blessing promised, and in the Land of
Canaan, which was a type of the Heavenly Country.

29. From the time of Moses unto Christ, all these same were further shadowed,
by means both extraordinary, and also ordinary.

30. Redemption and the application hereof was extraordinarily signified. 1. By
the deliverance out of Egypt by the Ministry of Moses as a type of Christ.
Mat. 2. 15. And by the bringing into the Land of Canaan by the Ministry of
Iosuah, as of another type of Christ. 2. By the brazen Serpent, by the
beholding whereof, men that were like to dye were restored to health. John 3.
14. 12. 32. 3. By the cloud, whereby the Israelites were covered from all the
injuries both of their enemies, and of the Heaven. And moreover they had light,
together with refreshing of their strength administered by day and by night. 1
Cor. 10. 2. Esaias 4. 4. 4. By passing thorough the red Sea, whereby they had a
way cast up to the Land of promise, their enemies being overwhelmed and
destroyed. 1. Cor. 10. 2. 5. By Mannah from Heaven, and Water out of the Rock,
whence they received continual nourishment, as it were out of Gods Hand. 1
Cor. 10. 3. and 4. John 6. 32. 33.

31. Ordinarily Christ and Redemption by him was shaddowed out by the high
priest, the authors, and sacrifices for sins.

32. Justification was showed in many sacrifices, washings, and the Sacrament
of the Passover.

33. Adoption was showed in the first borne, who were dedicated to God.

34. Sanctification, in all the offerings and gifts, and in those observations
which had any show of cleanliness.

35. Glorification, by the inheritance of the promised Land, and by that
communion which they had with God in the most holy place.

36. The Church of Jews instituted by Moses, in respect of the outward
gathering together was only one, because all that solemn Communion, which was
at that time prescribed, did depend upon one Temple, and there it was to be
exercised by public profession and with certain rites.

37. The Synagogues were not complete Churches, because the whole worship of
God and the whole holy Communion at that time prescribed could not be exercised
in them.

38 Therefore the Church of the Jews was a national Church, and in some
respect catholic, or universal, as the believing Proselytes of every Nation
under Heaven, were bound to join themselves to that one Church. Acts 2. 5. 6.
8. 9. 10. 11. and 8. 27.

39. The primary Ministers were the Priests, of the family of Aaron, in a
continued line of succession, to whom were joined the other Levites. Number. 3. 6.
7. 8. 9. 10.

40. Yet neither Priests nor Levites were admitted to Minister, unless they
were first tried, and that as they were able in body, age, and the gifts of the
mind.

41. The Discipline of that time that was merely Ecclesiastical, was for a
great part ceremonial, yet so as all kind of holy things were to be preserved
pure.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
Of the administration of the Covenant from Christ exhibited to the end of the
World.

1. THE manner of administration now Christ is exhibited is double, one until
the end of the world, and the other in the end it self.

2. From Christ to the end of the world, there is an administration of one
manner, and that altogether new: whence also it is called the New Testament.

3. It is of one manner without end or alteration, because it is perfect, so
that there is not another to be expected, to which it should give place as to
the more perfect.

4. It is the New Testament, in respect of that which was from the time of
Moses, and in respect of the promise made to the Fathers: not in respect of the
essence, but in respect of the manner, because in them in respect of the manner
of administering, there was some representation of the Covenant of works, from
which this Testament does essentially differ; and so seeing there did not
appear an integrall difference, of the New Covenant from the Old, but in that
administration which is most properly called the New Covenant and Testament.

5. But it differs from the former administration, in quality and quantity.

6. That wherein it differs in quality is either cleernesse, or freedom.

7. Cleernesse consists in this, first that the doctrine of grace and salvation
by Christ and Faith in him, together with those things annexed to it, is more
distinct and express, then before it was: Secondly, that it is not declared in
types and shadows, but in a most manifest manner.

8. In both these respects, Christ before is said to be propounded before under
a valid, but now to be offered with open and unvailed face. 2 Cor. 3. 12. We
use great evidence in speaking; neither are we as Moses who put a veil over
his face, that the children of Israel could not see to the end of that which
now as unprofitable is taken away.

9. Freedom does consist in this. First, that the government of the Law, or
mixing of the covenant of works, which did hold the ancient people-in a
certain bondage, is now taken away: whence also the spirit of adoption,
although it was never wholly denied to the faithful, yet most properly it is
said to be communicated under this New Testament, in which the most perfect
state of believers does most clearly appear, Gal. 4. 5. After the fullness of
time came, God sent forth his Son -- that we might receive the adoptions of
sons, etc. Secondly, it consists in this, that the yoke of the ceremonial Law,
as it was an handwriting against s^ers, as it did forbid the use of things in
their nature indifferent, as it did command many burdensome observations of
them, and as it did veil the truth it self with manifold and carnal
ceremonies, is now wholly taken away, Col. 2. 14. 17. Which are a shadow of
things to come, but the body is of Christ.

10. They therefore offend against that liberty which Christ has obtained for
us, who obtrude upon the Christian Churches either Jewish ceremonies, or other
of the like nature with them, religious, and mystical. For divine ceremonies
are not taken away, that humane should succeed in their room; neither is it
likely, that Christ would leave such mysteries to the will of men, after his
coming, when he permitted no such thing to his people of old, especially
seeing he might so easily. in this kind provide for us, if he had judged any
religious and mystical ceremonies necessary or profitable for his, besides
those very few which he did by name prescribe, or at least show in certain
Tables, to whom he did grant such an authority, which he no where did. Gal. 5.
1. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made you free, and
going back again be not entangled with a yoke of bondage.

11. In quantity this administration differs from the former, both intensively
and extensively.

12. Intensively, first, in that the application by the spirit is more
effectual, and the gifts of the spirit are more perfect, then ordinarily they
were under the Old Testament, whence the old administration is comparatively
called the Letter, and the new the spirit. 2 Cor. 3. 6. Secondly, in that it
begets a more spiritual life. 2 Cor. 3. 18.

13. Extensively, first in respect of place, because it is not contracted to
some one people, as before, but is diffused through the whole world. Secondly,
in respect of time, in that it has no term of duration before the
consammation of the whole mystical Church. 2 Corinthians 3. 11. Ephesians. 4. 13.
That which remains, until we all meet unto a perfect man, unto the measure
of the full stature of Christ.

14. But because this new administration is so perfect, therefore it is meet
also, that the communion of Saint^ in the Church under the New Testament be
ordained most perfect.

15. Therefore in every Church of the New Testament the whole solemn and
ordinary worship of God and all his holy ordinances may and ought to be
observed, so that all the members of that Church may ordinarily exercise
communion together in them.

16. For it is not now as it was ordained of God in the Church of the Jews
that some more solemn parts of Divine worship may be exercised in one place,
and other in other places, but one particular Church is ordained, in which all
holy offices are to be performed.

17. Hence all Christian Churches, have altogether one and the same right,
tha^ne does no more depend upon another, then another upon it.

18. Hence also it is most convenient that one particular Church do not
consist of more members then may meet together into one place to hear the
Word of God, celebrate the Sacraments, offer prayers, and exercise Discipline,
and perform other duties of Divine polity, as one body.

19. For it is an Aberration not void of all confusion, that in some greater
Cities, although there be more believers then that can exercise that Communion
together, yet they are not distributed into diverse Churches, but do make one
so to abound, that the edification of every one cannot be rightly taken care
for and furthered.

20. Therefore the Church instituted since Christ exhibited, is not one
catholic Church, so as all the faithful throughout the world should be joined
together in one and the same outward band among themselves, and should depend
upon one and the same visible pastor, o^ company of pastors, but there are so
many Churches as there are companies, or particular Congregations, of those
that prosesse the Faith, who are joined together by a special band for the
constant exercise of the communion of Saints.

21. For although the mystical Church, as it is in its members, is no other
way distributed then into the adjuncts, and subjects, in which respect we call
the Church of Belgia, of Britany, of France, as we call the Sea according to
the shores which it was heth to, the Belgic, British, French Sea, although it
be one and the same Sea: yet the instituted Churches, are diverse most special
Species, or Individualls, partaking of the same common nature, as diverse
fountains, diverse Schools, diverse Families: although many or all peradventure
might be called one Church in respect of some one affection which they have in
common, as many Families of some noble stock, are often set forth by the name
of one Family, as the Family of the House of Nassou, etc.

22. Neither is this Church that is instituted by God properly national,
provincial, or Dioecesan, which f^rmes were brought in by men from the pattern
of civil government, especially the Roman: but it is Parochial, or of one
congregation, the members where of are combined among themselves, and do
ordinarily meet into one place to the public exercise of religion.

23. For such a company, and not larger, is properly signified by the word
(...) Church, neither has it a larger signification in the New Testament when
it is referred to any visible and designed company, neither also among profane
authors who are the more ancient.

24. Hence diverse fixed Congregations, of the same Country, and Province are
always called Churches in the plural number not one Church, even in Iudaea,
which was all before one national Church. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 14. Acts 14. 23. and 15.
41. Romans 16. 4. 5. 16. 1 Cor. 16. 1. 19. 2 Cor. 8. 1. 18. 19. Gal. 1. 2. 12.

25. Also those particular Churches which are reckoned up i^ the New Testament
were wont to mere together E (...) into one Acts 2. 46. and 5. 12. and 14. 27.
and 15. 25. and 21. 22. 1 Cor. 5. 4. and 14 23. 26. and 11. 17. 23.

26. Neither is there any thing read in all the New Testament of the
institution of any larger Church upon which lesser congregations should depend,
neither is there any worship or holy ordinance prescribed which is not to be
observed in every Congregation, neither is there any ordinary Minister made,
who is not given to some one such company.

27. Yet particular Churches, as their Communion does require, the light of
nature and equity of rules and examples of Scripture do teach, may and of
tentimes also ought to enter into a mutual confederacy and fellowship among
themselves in Classes, and Synods, that they may use their common consent and
mutual help as much as fitly may be, in those things especially, which are of
greater moment; but that combination does neither constitute a new form of a
Church, neither ought it to take away, or diminish any way, that liberty and
power which Christ has left to his Churches, for the directing and farthering
whereof it only serves.

28. The ordinary Ministers do follow the form of the Church instituted; and
are not Occumenicall, National, Provincial, or Dioecesan Bishops, but Elders
of one Congregation, who in the same sense are also called Bishops in the
Scriptures.

29. Those transcendent members of the Hierarchy were merely humane Creatures
brought into the Church without any Divine precept or example: They cannot
fulfill the office of a Pastor in so many Congregations. They rob the Churches
of their liberty, whilst they exercise as it were, a regal, or rather
tyrannical dominion over the Churches themselves, and their Pastors, they have
brought in with them the Roman Antichrist himself, as the head, and
Chancellors, Suffraganes, Archdeacons, Officialls and the like props of the
Hierarchy, as the tail of the same sort, (whose very names are Apocryphal,
and altogether unknowen to the first Churches) to the utter oppressing of the
Churches of GOD.

30. The right of calling an ordinary Minister is in the Church it self to
whom he must serve. Acts 14. 23.

31. Yet here they need the direction and help of the Elders, both of the same
Church, and very often also of the neighbor Churches.

32. The essence of the calling is in election of the Church, and acceptance
of the elected.

33. An antecedent adjunct of it is, examination, or trial.

34. A consequent, and consummating adjunct is ordination, which is nothing
else then a certain solemn entrance of the Minister already elected, into the
free execution of his function: whence it comes to pass that (...), ordaining
by election, and (...) Imposition of hands do often signify the same thing
among the ancients.

35. The Episcopal ordination of a Minister without title, that is, without a
Church to which and in which he should be ordained, is as rediculous as if any
should be fained to be a husband without a wife.

36. A Minister so called to some one Church, can neither forsake it at his own
will, or be cast out from it without just cause: neither can another undertake
the like care of the Church, or neglect that which he has undertaken, by
voluntary non-residency, without sacrilegious breaking of his covenant.

37. Ordinary Ministers are either Pastors and Teachers, or ruling Elders, to
whom are joined those that take care of the poor, that is Deacons, Diaconesses
or Widows.

38. By these offices Christ has sufficiently provided for all the necessities
of the members of the Church, namely that they may be chiefly instructed in the
knowledge of the truth by Teachers, stirred up chiefly to the practice of piety
by Pastors, preserved in that course of life, and called back to repentance for
sins, by them and the Rulers, and be helped against poverty by Deacons.

CHAPTER LX.
Of Baptism and the Supper of the Lord.

1. AFter the nature of the New Testament, the Sacraments of the same do
follow, for they are for number few, to be obtained, and observed easy, and in
their signification must perspicuous.

2. They were sanctified and instituted by Christ himself: for although the
one Sacrament was first used by John Baptist, yet in that very thing he was the
forerunner of Christ, that he might show, what Christ himself afterward would
allow and institute, neither had it the respect of an ordinary institution by
the Ministry of John, but by the institution of Christ himself.

3. These Sacraments are Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord, for neither were
there either other Sacraments or Sacramental signs delivered to the Church by
Christ or his Apostles: neither can there other be appointed by men in the
Church.

4. In respect of Gods Institution, there lies greatest necessity upon the
faithful to use these Sacraments, diligently, and religiously, yet they are
not so absolutely necessary to salvation, that the absence, or mere privation
of them does bring a privation of this institution: neither ought they in that
respect, to be celebrated either of those that are not lawful Ministers, or
out of a Church assembly.

5. Baptism is the Sacrament of Initiation or Regeneration.

6. For although it does seal the whole covenant of grace together to the
faithful, yet by a special approbation it does represent, and confirm our
very ingrafting into Christ. Romans 6. 3. We are baptized into Christ Jesus, and
Verse 5. Being planted together with him. And 1 Cor. 12. 13. We are baptized
into one body.

7. But because upon our first ingrafting into Christ by Faith, there does
immediately follow a relation of our Justification and Adoption: therefore
Baptism as the Sacrament of the ingrafting itself, is unto remission of sins.
Marc. 1. 3. And it is also a representation of adoption, whilst that by it we
are confecrated to the Father Son, and holy Spirit, and their names are
called upon the baptized.

8. Because also holiness is always derived from Christ into whom we are
ingrafred, unto all the faithful, therefore Baptism also is the seal of our
sanctification. Tit. 3. 5. He has saved us by the laver of regeneration, and
the renewing of the holy Spirit. Romans 6. 4. 5, 6.

9. And because Glorification cannot be separated from true holiness,
therefore it is withal the seal also of eternal glory. Tit. 3. 7. That we
might be made heirs, according to the hope of eternal life. Romans 6. 8. If
we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live together with him.

10. But because those benefits are sealed according to the measure of
initiation in Baptism, hence, First, Baptism is but once to be administered,
because there is but one beginning of spiritual life by regeneration, as there
is but one beginning of natural life by generation.

11. Hence also, Secondly, Baptism ought to be administered to all those to
whom the covenant of grace pertaines, because it is the first sealing of the
covenant it self now first begun.

12. But that the infants of the faithful are not to be forbidden this
Sacrament, it appears. 1. Because if they be partakers of any grace, it is by
virtue of the covenant of grace, and so both the covenant, and the first seal
of the covenant also does pertain to them. 2. In that the covenant in which
the faithful are now contained, is the same with that covenant which was made
with Abraham. Romans 4. 11. Gal. 3. 7, 8, 9. But that did expressly extend unto
Infants. 3. This covenant which is now administered to the faithful, does bring
more large and full consolation to them, then of old it could before the
coming of Christ. But if it should pertain only to them, and not to their
Infants, then the grace of God and their consolation should be more narrow, and
contracted after Christ is exhibited then before it was. 4. Because baptism
succeeded in the place of circumcision. Col. 2. 11. 12. And so does pertain as
well to the children of believers as circumcision itself. 5. Because in the
very beginning of regeneration, whereof baptism is a seal, man is merely
passive; whence also there is no outward action required of a man either to be
circumcised or baptized, as in other Sacraments, but only a passive receiving:
therefore Infants, are as capable of this Sacrament in respect of the chief
use of it, as these of age are.

13. Faith and repentance do no more make the covenant of God now then in the
time of Abraham (who was the Father of the faithful) therefore the want of
those acts ought no more to hinder baptism from Infants now, then it did
forbid circumcision then.

14. The sign in this Sacrament is water, not simply, but as it purges the
unclean, either by dipping or sprinkling.

15. But therefore water was chosen, because there is nothing in use that does
more fitly represent that spiritual washing, which is performed by the blood or
dead of Christ, neither is the sprinkling or application of the blood of
Christ, so fitly expressed by any thing, seeing that now since the death of
Christ, there ought to be no use of natural blood in holy things.

16. The supper of the Lord is the Sacrament of the nourishing and growth of
the faithful in Christ.

17. Hence it ought oftentimes to be administered to the same person.

18. Hence also the supper is only to be administered to those, who are visibly
capable of norishment and growth in the Church: and so not to Infants, but
only to those of age.

19. But because most full and perfect nourishment is sealed in Christ,
therefore here is used not some one and simple sign of nourishing, but of a
double kind, as the nourishment of the body does require, namely Bread and Wine.

20. They therefore who take away one of these signs from the faithful in the
administration of the supper, do detract from the wisdom of God, make lame
the institution of Christ, and grievously lessen or take away the consolation
of the faithful.

21. But bread and wine are therefore used, because except the eating of flesh
(which has no place in holy things now the sacrifice of Christ is finished)
and the drinking of blood, from which not only religion, but man's nature
adhors: there is nothing does more conveniently express that nearest union
which by degrees we enjoy with Christ, which is founded in the sacrificing of
his body and shedding of his blood.

22. To faigne any transubstantiation, or consubstantiation in this Sacrament
more, then in baptism, is a certain blind and stupid superstition.

23. For it is not required to spiritual nourishment in this Sacrament, that
the bread and wine be changed into the body and blood of Christ, nor that
Christ be corporally present with them, but only that they be changed
relatively in respect of application and use, and that Christ be spiritually
present with them who receive in Faith.

24. This transubstantiation, and consubstantiation is against the nature of a
Sacrament in general, against the analogy of our other Sacrament, or baptism,
against the most usual phrases in the Old Testament against the humane nature
of Christ against his state of Glorification, and against the revealed will of
God, which says that Christ shall remain in Heaven until the day of
judgment.

25. As touching the words of Institution, This is my body, they are
necessarily to be understood, as other sacramental phrases, which every where
we meet with in the holy Scriptures, of which we have God himself a clear
interpreter, Genesis 17. 10, 11. This is (...) Covenant. That it may be a sign of
the Covenant between me and you.

26. As touching the manner of opening the words of this phrase according to
art, learned men do differ among themselves. Most of our interpreters would
have a trope in the words, that is, a metaphor or a metonymy.

27. The Lutherans contend that here is no trope to be found, but only an
unusual predication.

28. There are not a few, and those new Interpreters, who deny, that there is
either any proper trope, or unusual predication, but they make it an improper
and mystical predication.

29. But no sufficient reason is brought why we may deny that there is a trope
in the words: which may be thus demonstrated. If it be an improper or unusual
predication as they would have it, this unusual or improper way ought to be
showed in some word: which if it be done, then of necessity it is that that
word be some way translated from his natural signification and use: if that be
so, the word takes the nature and definition of a trope.

30. But the trope is neither in the Article going before, nor in the proper
Copula, as in the word is; but in that which follows, that is, in the word
body, for body is put for a sign of the body, not that a true and proper body
is excluded out of that sentence, but rather included, by a relation, which the
sign has to the thing signified.

31. But there is not only one trope, but threefold in this word, the first is
a metaphor, whereby one thing like is put for another unto which a metonymie of
the adjunct adheres and is mingled. For the bread is not only like the body of
Christ, but also by Gods institution it is made an adjunct of it: the second is
a Synechdoche of the part for the whole, whereby the body of Christ is put for
whole Christ; the third is a metonymy of the subject for the adjuncts, in that
Christ is put for all those benefits also which are derived from Christ to us.
In the other part of the Wine, there are other tropes sufficiently manifested.

CHAPTER XLI.
To the end of the World.

1. THus far of the administration which is before the end of the World: in the
end itself that application shall be perfected, which is only begun in this
life.

2. Then the end of calling shall be present to all the called: for we are
called to the eternal glory of God. 1 Pet. 5. 10. Wherein also the end of
Faith is said to be contained, that is, the salvation of souls. 1 Pet. 1. 9.

3. Then that declaration of Justification and Redemption, which is by the
effects, shall be complete, in respect whereof the faithful are said in this
life, to expect Redemption. Luc. 21. 18. Romans 8. 23. Ephesians. 1. 14.

4. Then all the adopted shall enter into the possession itself of the
inheritance, in which sense the faithful are said in this life to expect their
adoption. Romans 8. 23.

5. Then the Image of God shall be perfected in all the Saints. Ephesians. 5. 27.
That he might present it to himself glorious, not having spot, or wrinkle, or
any such thing, but that it might be holy and unblameable.

6. Finally then the glory and blessedness hoped for, shall shine in all kind
of fullness, not only in the soul, but also in the very body. Philippians 3.
21. He shall transfigure out mean body, that it may be made conformable to
his glorious body.

7. But because the state of the Church at that time shall be a state of
perfection, and not of edification, therefore the Ministry, Sacraments, and
Discipline, together with the instituted Churches themselves shall cease, and
the mystical Church shall remain in immediate communion with God.

8. Hence also this end of the World ought with desire to be expected of all
the faithful. Phil. 3. 20. Tit. 2. 13. We expect a Savior, Jesus Christ.
Expecting that blessed hope, and that glorious coming of the glory of the
great God and our Savior.

9. The perfection of this final administration does require the coming and
personal presence of Christ himself. Acts 10. 42.

10. The second coming of Christ in this shall be like the first, that it
shall be real, visible and apparent. Acts 1. 11. But in this unlike, that it
shall be. 1. With greatest glory and power. Mat. 24. 30. Tit. 2. 13. 2. It
shall be with greatest terror in respect of the ungodly, and with greatest joy
of all the godly. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 7, 8, 9, 10.

11. Hence there are two Acts, that serve for the last discerning between the
godly and ungodly; Resurrection and the last judgment, 2 Cor. 5. 10.

12. Resurrection is of that which fell: but because man fell from life, by the
separation of the soul from the body, therefore that he may rise again, it is
necessary that the same soul be again reunited to the same body, that by the
restored union of both, the same man may exist.

13. That such a Resurrection is possible to God it appears: because such a
reparation of man does not exceed that power which was manifested in his first
Creation. Phil. 3. 21. According to that effectual power whereby he is able to
subdue all things to himself.

14. But that this Resurrection shall actually be, it cannot be certainly
demonstrated by any natural reason, neither, A priori, nor A posteriori, but
it is properly of faith.

15. Neither the nature of the soul, nor of the body, can be the cause of
Resurrection: for the forming again and raising up of the body, out of the
dust, is against the wonted course of nature, which when it is perfectly
destroyed, is not wont to be repaired by nature: and the inseparable union of
the soul with the body by which man is made immortal, is above the strength
of nature.

16. Therefore the raising up of the dead does properly agree to Christ
God-man: the principle of it is the Divine omnipotency of Christ, whereby it
may easily be accomplished, even in an Instant.

17. The Ministry of the Angels, shall not be properly to raise the dead, but
together the parts to be raised, and to gather them together being raised.

18. But although all shall be raised by Christ, yet not in one and the same
way: for the Resurrection of the faithful is unto Life, and it is accomplished
by virtue of that union, which they have with Christ, as with their Life. Col.
3. 4. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 14. And by the operation of his qu^ckning spirit which dwells
in them. Romans 8. 11. He shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his spirit
dwelling in you: but the Resurrection of others, is by that power of Christ,
whereby he excecuteth his revenging Justice.

19 Therefore the Resurrection of the faithful is from the Life of Christ, as
from a beginning, unto their life, as the fruit and effect: and therefore it is
called the Resurrection of life: and the raising up of others is from the
sentence of death and condemnation, to death and condemnation it self, and
therefore it is called, the resurrection of condemnation. John 5. 28, 29.

20. The last judgment is exercised by Christ as by a King: for the power of
Judging is part of the office of a King.

21. In respect of the faithful it comes from grace, and is an office of the
Kingdom of grace, essential to Christ the Mediator: but in respect of
unbelievers, it is an office of power only and dominion, granted of the
Father, belonging to some perfection of mediation, but not essential to it.

22. Hence the sins of the faithful shall not come into judgment: for seeing
that in this life they are covered and taken away by the sentence of
Justification, and that last judgment shall be a confirmation and
manifestation of that sentence, it would not be mere, that at that time they
should again be brought to light.

23. The place of this judgment shall be in the Air. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 17.

24. The day and year of it is not revealed in Scripture, and so may not be
set down by men.

25. The sentence presently to be fulfilled, shall be given, of eternal life
or death, according to works foregoing.

26. But the sentence of life, in respect of the elect, shall be given,
according to their works, not as meritorious causes, but as effects testifying
of true causes.

27. But the sentence of death in respect of the reprobate, shall be given
according to their works, as the true causes.

28. Christ God-man is the Judge, as it were delegated: yet in respect of that
Divine authority and power which he has, and upon which depends the strength
of the sentence, here is the principal Judge.

29. The faithful also shall judge with Christ, assisting; not consulting, but
approving, as well in their judgment and will, as by comparison of their life
and works.

30. Judgment shall be given not only of wicked men, but also of evil
Angels. Therefore the raising up, and judging of wicked men to be done by
Christ, does no more argue the universal redemption of such men, then of the
Devils.

31. The fire that is appointed to purge and renew the World, shall not go
before the judgment, but shall follow.

32. Purgatori is no more necessary before the day of judgment then after:
seeing there shall be none afterward, by the confession of the Papists
themselves, neither is there any now before.

33. The elements shall not be taken away, but changed.

34. Christ also after the day of judgment shall remain King and Mediator for
ever.

THE SECOND BOOK OF SACRED THEOLOGY.
CHAPTER 1.
Of Observance in general.

Thus much of the first part of Theology, or of Faith in God: the other part
follows, which is Observance toward God.

1. OBservance is that whereby the Will of God is performed with subjection to
his glory.

2. It respects the Will of God as a pattern, and a rule, as appears by the
those words of Christ, wherein also he describes our obdience; let thy Will be
done as in Heaven, so also in Earth; and did also explain his own obedience,
Mat. 26. 29. Not as I will, but as thou will, and Verse 42. Let thy will be
done, so Psalm. 40, 9. I delight to do thy will, O my God: and thy Law is
written in my bowels.

3. But it respects the Will of God not as it is secret, and powerfully
effectual, or ordaining: for so even all other Creatures and ungodly men, and
the very Devils also themselves do perform the Will of God, with that
obedientiall virtue which is common to all Creatures: but it respects that Will
of God which prescribes our duty to us. Deuteronomy. 29. 29. Things that are revealed,
are revealed, that we may do them.

4. It respects that will with subjection. Romans 8. 7. Because it applies our
will to fulfill the Will of God, as it commands us any thing according to his
authority. Romans 8. 7. It is not subject to the Law of God.

5. Hence it is called obedience: because it makes the will ready to commit the
command of God to execution, being heard, and in some measure perceived.

6. Hence also it has in it self some respect of Service toward God; whence
it comes to pass, that to obey God, and to serve him, sound one and the some
thing. Luc. 1. 74. Romans 6. 16. And to serve God is altogether the same with
serving of obedience and righteousness. There Verse 16. 18. 22. Because that
to do the Will of God with subjection, is to serve God. Ephesians. 6. 6. 7. As
servants of Christ, doing the Will of the Lord from the heart, with good will
doing service, as to the Lord.

7. For our obedience toward God, although in respect of readiness of mind it
ought to be the obedience of sons: yet in respect of that strict obligation to
subjection, it is the obedience of servants.

8. From this subjection to the Will of God, there does necessarily follow a
conformity betwixt the Will of God and ours. Rev. 2. 6. This thou have, that
thou hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. And a certain
express resemblance of that Divine perfection which God has revealed and
propounded to be imitated by us. 2 Pet. 1. 4. That we might be made partakers
of the Divine nature, for he that does truth, his works are said to be done
according to God. John. 3. 2.

9. Hence the same obdience which is called obedience, because it respects the
Will of God with subjection; and righteousness, because it performs that
subjection which is due; is also called holiness because it respects the same
will with conformity and pure likeness. 1 Pet. 1. 14. 15. As obedient children
-- as he that has called you is holy, be ye also holy in all manner
conversation.

10. Obedience looks to the glory of God. 1 Cor. 10. 31. Do all to the glory
of God: as it does acknowledge his chief authority and power in commanding. 1
Cor. 6. 20. Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God, etc. And also
as it has in part relation to, and does represent the perfection of God. 1.
Pet. 2. 9. That ye may set forth his virtues, in the manifestation of which
things consists that glory which may be given to him of us.

11. Also in this subjection there is a respect of fear, as the Authority and
Power of God is acknowledged: whence also the fear of the Lord is in Scripture
often ^at for whole obedience. Psalm 34. 12. I will teach you the fear of the
Lord.

12. It is therefore said to be toward God, both as God is the Rule of it, and
as he is the Object of it, and also as he is the End.

13. The principal efficient cause of it by way of an inward and inherent
principle, is mediatly Faith, and immediately sanctifying Grace.

14. For Faith does both prepare a way for us to God. Heb. 10. 22. Let us draw
nigh by assurance of Faith, and Power to go to him. 2 Cor. 1. 24. By Faith ye
stand, whence obedience is called the obedience of faith. Romans 1. 5. And the
faithful are called the children of obedience, 1 Pet. 1. 14.

15. Now Faith does bring forth obedience in a threefold respect. 1. As it does
apprehend Christ who is the Fountain of Life, and the Spring of all power to
do well, and 2. As it receives and rests in those arguments, which God has
propounded to us in Scripture to persuade obedience, namely by promises and
threatenings. 3. As it has power to obtain all grace, and so that grace
whereby obedience is performed.

16. But sanctifying grace is that very power whereby we are lifted up, to
apply our will to the will of God. Whence also new obedience is always
included and understood, in Scripture, when there is mention made of the new
man, and the new creature. Ephesians. 4. 24. Gal. 6. 15.

17. For nothing can be performed by man, since sin is entered, acceptable to
God, as it comes from him, or as a work of spiritual life: unless, it be
performed in Christ by Faith and the grace of sanctification. John 15. 4, 5.
Without me ye can do nothing.

18. Yet these duties are not therefore to be omitted by a man that does not
yet believe; because they are in themselves good, they hinder the increase of
sin and punishments of sinners, nay they are often reconpensed with diverse
benefits from God, although (...) by force of any determined Law, but by a
certain abundant and secret kindness of him.

19. The adjuvant cause by moving is. 1. The dignity and majesty of God in it
self to be observed. Deuteronomy. 31. 3. Ascribe ye greatness to our God. Psalm. 29.
2. Give unto the Lord the glory of his name. 2. The kindness of God toward us,
in which respect we owe to him whatsoever is in us. 1 Cor. 6. 20. Know ye not
that ye are not your own -- which are Gods. Romans 12. By the mercy of God,
whence also it is, that our obedience is nothing else then thankfulness due to
God, and it is rightly explained by Divines under that name. 3. The authority
of God commanding, which has universal and full dominion over us, James 4.
22. There is one Lawgiver who can save and destroy. 4. The equity and profit
of the things commanded, which do both agree with greatest reason, Romans 2. 15.
Their conscience together bearing witness, and also pertain to our perfection
and blessedness. Deuteronomy. 32. 47. It is your Life. 5. The reward and promises by
which obedience is persuaded. 2 Cor. 7. 1. Seeing we have these promises, let
us purge our selves, etc. 6. The misery which they that do otherwise do
incur, Deuteronomy. 28. 16. Heb. 12. 26. Cursed shall thou be. For our God is a
consuming fire.

20. The matter of obedience is that very thing which is commanded by God, and
so is summarily contained in the Decalogue: for otherwise the Law of God should
not be perfect.

21. Therefore the Law of God altough in respect of the faithful ithee as it
were abrogated, both in respect of the power of justifying which it bad in the
state of integrity, and in respect of the condemning power which it had in the
state of sin: yet it has force and vigor, in respect of power to direct, and
some power also it does retain of condemning, because it reproves, ^d
condemns sin in the faithful themselves, although it cannot wholly condemn
the faithful themselves, who are not under the Law, but under Grace.

22. The form of obedience is our conformity to the Will of God, therefore
revealed, that it may be fulfilled by us Mich. 6. 8. He has (...) ^ee O man,
what is good.

23. For neither is the secret Will of God, the rule of our obedience, nor all
his revealed will, for Jeroboam sinned in taking the Kingdom of Israel,
although the Prophet told him that God did in some sort will it. 1 Kings 11.
31. with 2 Chronicles. 13. 5, 6, 7. But that revealed will, which prescribes our
duty is therefore revealed that it may be fulfilled by us.

24. But this Will of God in this very respect, is said to be good, perfect and
acceptable to God. Romans 12. 2. Good, because it contains in it self all
respect of that which is honest: perfect, because there is nothing to be sought
further for the instruction of life: acceptable to God, because obedience
performed to this will, is approved and crowned of GOD.

25. The knowledge of this will is necessary to true obedience. Prove. 4. 13.
Take hold of instruction, and let her not go: keep her, for she is thy life,
and Verse 19. The way of the wicked is darkness, they know not at what they
stumble.

Therefore the disire of knowing this will of God is commanded to us, together
with obedience it self. Prove. 5. 1. 2. Attend to wisdom, incline thine ear to
understanding: whereof a great part also is, when it respects practice, as on
the contrary, all ignorance of those things which we are bound to know and do,
is sin. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8. Rendering vengeance to those that know not God, and
obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

26. With knowledge of the will of God in this life, there ought to be joined a
trembling and fear to transgress it. Pro. 8. 12. 13. and 14. 16. I wisdom,
have with me the fear of the Lord. The wise man fears and departh for evil.
Chiefly indeed in respect of offense: but also in respect of the anger and
punishment most of all as it separates from God. Neither ought such fear to be
called servile, when it respects not punishment only.

27. The chief end is Gods glory; for we tend unto him by obedience, upon whom
we lean by Faith: otherwise obedience should not flow from Faith. Seeing also
that Faith is our life, as it does join us to God in Christ, it is necessary
that the actions of the same Faith, which are contained in the obedience,
should be carried also to God, that is, to his Glory.

28. The less principal end is our own salvation and blessedness. Romans 6.
22. Being made servants to God, ye have your fruit in holiness, and the end
eternal life. Heb. 1. 2. 2. For the joy that was set before him he endured the
Cross.

29. For although that obedience which performed only for fear of punishment
or expectation of reward, is rightly called mercenary: yet that any should be
secondarily stirred up to do his duty, by looking on the reward, or for fear
of punishment also, this is not strange from the Sons of God, neither does it
in any part weaken their solid obedience.

30. But our obedience is not the principal or meritorious cause of life
eternal. For we do both receive the privilege of this life, and also the life
it self, by grace, and the gift of God for Christ's sake apprehended by Faith.
Romans 6. 23. The gift of God is eternal Life in Jesus Christ our Lord. But our
obedience is in a certain manner, the Ministering, helping and furthering cause
toward the possession of this life, the right where of we had before; in which
respect it is called the waywherein we walk to Heaven. Ephesians. 2. 10.

31. But it furthers our life, both in its own nature; because it is some
degree of the life, it self always es tending to perfection: and also by virtue
of the promise of God who has promised life eternal to those that walk in
his precepts. Galatians 6. 8. He that sowes to the spirit, of the spirit shall
reap life eternal.

32. For although all our obedience whilst we live here is imperfect and
defiled with some mixture of sin. Gala. 5. 17. the flesh lusts against the
spirit; yet in Christ it is so acceptable to God, that it is crowned with the
greatest reward.

33. Therefore the promises made to the obedience of the faithful, are not
legal, but evangelicall, although by some they are called mixed. Mat. 5. 3.

34. The manner of obedience is in subjection or humility largely taken,
whereby the creature does submit himself to God, to receive and execute his
commands: unto which there ought always to be joined. 1. Sincerity, whereby
all mixture of a strange intention and affection is removed, so that the whole
man is applied to this duty. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23. 1 Cor. 6. 20. And 2. Zeal, that
is, the highest degree of a pure affection. Gal 4. 18. It is a good thing to
love servently, (...) in a good thing always.

35. The chief subject of obedience as also of lively Faith is the will. Phil.
2. 13. It is God that works in you both to will, and to do.

36. But because the s^rity of the will approving does most appear in
readiness, alacrity or cheerfulness of mind, therefore that cheerfulness
does most of all pertain to the very essence of obedience. 2 Cor. 9. 7. Deuteronomy.
28. 47. God loves a cheerful giver: because thou did not serve thy God in
joy and cheerfulness of heart. So as often it is pleasing and acceptable to
God, although the work it self that is propounded, be not performed. 2 Cor.
8. 12. For if there be first a ready mind, one is accepted according to that he
has.

37. And because the zeal of the will does chiefly consist in love and hatred,
therefore also there is necessarily required to obedience acceptable to God, a
love of the good, and hatred of evil. Ps. 45. 8. Thou have loved
righteousness, and hated iniquity.

38. The effect and fruit is not only a declaration, but also a confirmation
of Faith and Hope. 2 Timothy 1. 19. Keeping Faith and a good conscience, which
being put away, some have made Shipwreck of Faith.

39. An adjunct that accompanies it is a conscience quiet, joyful and
glorying. Heb. 13. 18. 2 Cor. 1. 12. 1 John 3. 19. 21. For we trust that we
have a good conscience, desiring to behave our selves well in all things. 1.
Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, by this we shall assure
our hearts.

CHAPTER II.
Of Virtue.

1. THere be two parts of obedience. Virtue, and the action of Virtue. 2. Pet.
1. 5. Ad to your Faith Virtue, etc. For if these things be with you and abound,
they will make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

2. This distribution is of the whole into members* for these two are in their
own nature joined together, and do make one and the same obedience.

3. Hence both virtues and their actions are set forth by the same name, and
are explained also by the same definition, because they are altogether of the
same nature: even as arguments of Logic, are of the same name and nature,
whether they be considered alone and by themselves, or in Axioms, and
Syllogismes.

4. Virtue is an habit whereby the will is inclined to do well.

5. It is called an habit, not as it is distinguished from disposition, and
signifies a confirmed and perfect constitution of mind: for such a degree of
virtue is scarce granted to men, while they live here: but generally, as it
contains both a perfect and also imperfect degree of Virtue, and state of the
mind.

6. But it is called an habit, not only because it is had, but also because it
makes the subject which it is in to have it self in a certain manner, that
is, it determines the faculty to good, which otherwise is not determined, in
which sense this word is found, Hebr. 5. 14. Who by reason of habit, have their
senses exercised to discern good and evil.

7. It is in the will. First, because the will is the proper subject of the
Theology as it is the proper principle of life, and of moral and spiritual
actions. 2. Because the will is that faculty which is properly carried unto
good that is honest, Romans 7. 19. 21. 3. Because virtue is an habit that is
(...) or elective, the proper, and immediate operation whereof is voluntary
election. 4. Because the will does commend the other faculties, and so Virtue
does most agree to it, that all may be directed aright. 5. Because the will is
neither by it self, nor by reason sufficiently determined to good actions, and
so it has need of its own and internal disposition to work aright. 6.
Because the other faculties may he compelled, and by consequence one may
whether he will or no lose virtue, if it should have the proper and fixed seat,
in them. 7. Because that praise is most properly due to the actions of the
will, and to the operations of the other faculties, so far forth as they flow
from and depend upon the will; but that it is proper to virtue to be
praiseworthy, not only the Philosophers teach, but also the Apostle,
Philippians 4. 8. If there be any virtue, if any praise. 8. Because neither the
understanding can be the subject of virtue, because intellectual habits,
although they be most perfect, yet they do not make a man good, nor any
sensitive appetite, because true virtue is found in Angels, and the souls
being separated from bodies, which are void of this appetite: yet there are
often in the sensitive faculties some dispositions, which cause that the will
commanding aright is more easily obeyed, and in that respect they have a
certain resemblance of Virtue.

8. Virtue is said to incline to God. First, that it may be distinguished from
a vicious habit whereby men are inclined to evil. Rev. 7. 17. 20. 23. 2. That
it may be distinguished also from those perfections of the mind, which indeed
do bring light, whereby the will may direct it self as well doing, but not
incline it to do right.

9. Hence, First, true and solid virtues, do always make him good in whom
they are: not that the very dispositions that do inhere in us, are the grace
making us first accepted with God, as the Schoolmen speak, for that pertaines
to Faith; but because they are reciprocated with a good man, and goodness is
derived from them into our actions.

10. Hence also none can use virtue amiss, as being the principle of action;
when notwithstanding men may, and are wont to abuse any habit of the mind.

11. Therefore those virtues which are wont to be called intellectual, have
not an exact respect of virtue.

12. Moreover virtue is said to incline not only to good, but also to well
doing: because the manner of action does chiefly flow from virtue.

13. But as the rule of well-doing, so also the rule of virtue is the revealed
will of God, which only has the force of a certain rule in those things which
pertai^ to the direction of life.

14. That is a Lesbian rule of virtue which Aristotle, puts to be the judgment
of prudent men: for there are never such wise men, to whose judgment we may
always stand: neither if there were, they could not be always known or
consulted with by those who exercise themselves in Virtue.

15. That which is said to be right reason, if absolute rectitude be looked
after, it is not elsewhere to be sought for then where it is, that is, in the
Scriptures: neither does it differ from the will of God revealed for the
direction of our life. Psalm. 119. 66. Teach me the excellency of reason and
knowledge: for I believe thy precepts. But if those imperfect notions
concerning that which is honest, and dishonest, be understood, which are found
in the mind of man after the fall: seeing they are imperfect and very obscure,
they cannot exactly inform virtue; neither indeed do they differ any thing
from the written Law of God, but in imperfection and obscurity only.

16. Therefore there can be no other discipline of virtue then Divinity, which
delivers the whole Will of God revealed, for the directing of our reason, will,
and life.

17. They that think otherwise, do bring no reasons, which may move an
understanding and sound man. They say the end of Divinity is the good of grace:
but the end of Ethics is a moral or civil good. As if no moral or civil
good were in any respect, a good of grace and spiritual. As if the proper
good, blessedness, or end of man, were manifold, or as if that should be a
virtue of a man, which does not lead a man to his end, and chief good. They
say that Divinity is exercised about the inward affections of men; but Ethics
about the outward manners. As if either Ethics (which they define a prudence
to govern the will and appetite) did not respect the inward affection: or that
Divinity did not teach as well outward, as inward obedience.

They would have it that Ethickes are concluded in the bounds of this life, but
that Divinity extends to a future. As if a blessed life were not one; or that
of one and the same life, there were one rule, as it is present, and another as
it is to come. They say the subject of Ethickes is a man, approved, good and
honest: but the subject of Divinity is a godly and religious man; when
notwithstanding the Apostle does expressly teach that Divinity instructs us to
live not only piously and religiously, but also temperatly, and justly, that
is, approvedly and honestly, Tit. 2. 12. Ad to these, that the most eager
defenders of the contrary opinion, do acknowledge and contend, that moral
virtues are the image of God in man, and so a degree of Theological virtue;
and that moral virtue compared to spiritual is as warmth to heat, and the
morning-light to the noone-light. As therefore warmth and heat, morning, and
noone-light are taught in the same act: so also virtue moral and spiritual.

18. Therefore that judgment, and wish of that greatest master of arts, Peter
Ramus, was no less pious then prudent: If I should wish for that which I would
obtain, I had rather that this learning of philosophy were delivered to
children out of the Gospel, by some Divine that is learned, and of approved
manners, then out of Aristotle by a Philosopher. A child will learn many
impieties out of Aristotle, which it is to be feared, that he will forget too
late. That the beginning of blessedness, does arise out of men; that the end
of blessedness is bounded in man: that all virtues are wholly contained in man's
power, that they are obtained by man's nature, art, and industry. That though
these works, are great and Divine, yet that God is never used to them, either
as an aider, or workman: that Divine providence is removed from this theater
of humane life: of Divine Justice, that there is not a word spoken: that man's
blessedness is placed in this frail Life, etc.

19. But the same habit which is called virtue, as it does incline in his
manner unto God, is also called a gift, as it is given of God, and inspired by
the holy Spirit: and it is called grace, as it is freely bestowed, by the
special favor of God upon us; also in respect of the perfection which it
has, together with the profit and sweetness, which is perceived from is, is
it called fruit: and in respect of the hope it brings of life eternal, it is
called blessedness by some.

20. They therefore do weary themselves in vain, who make seven gifs of the
spirit out of Isay 11. 2. Upon whom the spirit of Iehova shall rest. The Spirit
of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit
of knowledge and of the fear of Iehova: and do carefully distinguish them
from virtues, and have enough to do to demonstrate the proportion of every of
them to some virtue. For neither are there only seven gifts of the spirit,
although there are no more (nay but six) reckoned up there: because there only
the chief and most kingly giftsin respect of the subject are remembered (for it
is there spoken of Christ) other gifts by a Synecdoche being understood:
neither those gifts themselves whereof there is mention made there, are in very
deed distinguished from virtues, but they do by a metonymy, set forth all
virtues by their causes.

21. For although those (...) Graces, whereof there is mention, 1 Corinthians
12. 4. are in very deed distinguished from virtues: yet Grace when it notes an
inherent perfection in us, does either set forth some one virtue, or all
jointly as it were in his root.

22. In vain also are there twelve fruits of the spirit gathered out of Gal.
5. 22. The fruit of the spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Kindness,
Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance, together with the addition which is
found in the common translation: and they are compared to virtues, as is
aforesaid of gifts; for neither are they only the fruits of the spirit, which
are there expressed upon the present occasion, and are explained in that place
with the names of the virtues themselves: because virtues are fruits, such as
are required and expected by the husbandman, and do agree to the nature of
the seed which he did sow, and also bring profit and sweetness, with them,
when they are perceived: all which do agree to virtues, and their actions in a
certain manner in respect of God; but the profit chiefly in respect of us:
whence also it is that holiness with all virtues is not only called a fruit of
the holy Spirit, but also our fruit, Romans 6. 22. But this profit together with
the sweetness is showed in that place to the Galatians, in as much as joy, and
peace are reckoned up, as fruits of the fruits.

23. They also use the same judgment, who think they have found eight
beatitudes in the Sermon of Christ. Matthew. 5. For there is but one beatitude,
but seeing it has diverse signs, namely all solid virtues, together with the
operations of them, the Lord does propound certain singular virtues, or
operations of virtues, which do most agree to his Kingdom, and are very
remote from humane sense, and does partly persuade them by the promise of
blessedness, and does partly also describe blessedness, or blessed men, by
the study and profession of them.

24. The common affections of virtue, are those four which are wont to be
called Cardinal virtues.

25. For they do not make four kinds of virtues, as the most have hitherto
thought, who do manifest violence both to virtue and reason it self, whilst
they will constrainedly refer all singular virtues to those heads: but they are
four conditions, which are necessarily required in that disposition which
deserves the name of virtue.

26. The first of these is called Justice in that general sense, whereby it
sets forth an inclination to do rightly, giving every man his own, and it may
be called the rectitude of virtue: for in that description of virtue which the
Apostle does propound in a certain heap of words, Phil. 4. 8. Whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are
of good report, if there be any virtue, and if any praise, although truth,
Justice, purity do set forth one and the same nature of virtue, yet Justice
does most intimately set forth the essence of it.

27. The second is Prudence; whereby all the strength of reason is used to find
out that which is right, and to direct a right all the means of it: it is
therefore the alone descerning of those things which pertain to right doing:
and it contains in it self the force of understanding, knowledge and
wisdom: so that all those perfections of the mind which are wont to be called
intellectual virtues, in this respect alone do pertain to virtue, so far
forth as by the power of them the will is directed in doing well.

28. It is called in the Scripture Spiritual understanding and wisdom, Col.
1. 9. Where understanding does seem to set forth a general perceiving of
good, and evil; and wisdom notes out the same perceiving as it is applied to
several things considered with their circumstances, wherewith they are
clothed: so that understanding considering does as it were say, It is lawful:
wisdom says, It is expedient; according to that distinction which is, 1
Corinthians 6. 12 and 10. 23. To this is opposed, Foolishness. Ephesiant 5.
17. Be not therefore unwife, but understanding what the Will of the Lord is.

And Ignorance, Ephesians. 4. 18. Being strangers from the Life of God, by reason of
the ignorance that is in them. It is also called Judgment. 1 Cor. 2. 15. And
Discerning, Phil. 1. 10. To which is opposed vanity of mind, Ephesians. 4. 17. And a
mind void of all Judgment, Romans 1. 28.

29. This Prudence ought to be exercised, 1. With circumspection, taking heed
and due diligence, which are often in the Scripture commended under the name of
watchfulness. Marc. 13. 33. Take heed, watch and pray: unto which is opposed
that drowsy sleepiness which is said to have seized upon the foolish Virgins.
Mat. 25. 5, 13. Secondly, with election upon a due proportion; so as the
greater duties be preferred before the lesser, and in every one a covenient
measure be kept according to the intending of affections and strength. Mat. 6.
33. 1 Cor. 12. 31. and 14. 1. Seek first the Kingdom of God and the
righteousness of it. Affect the greater gifts: but rather that ye may
prophecy.

30. The third general affection of virtue is fortitude, which is a firm
persisting in doing rightly, enduring and overcomming all those difficulties
which may arise either from the continuance of the act which is required, or
from other impediments whatsoever. Hence it is that virtue in the Hebrew is set
forth by the name Christ, even when it is ascribed to Women. Prove. 31. 10. And
a mighty strengthening is required in every virtue. Ephesians. 3. 16. It contains
therefore. 1. That confidence which is commended. Acts 4. 29. To which fear is
opposed, Phil. 1. 14. That they are bold to speak the word without fear.
Secondly, perseverance and constancy, Revel. 2. 26. Whosoever shall overcome;
and keep my works unto the end. To which is opposed a fainting of mind and
weariness of weldoing. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 13. Gal. 6. 9. Hebr. 12. 3, 12. Let us not
be weary. Be not weary. Least ye faint in your minds. Raise up the weak hands,
and feeble knees. Thirdly, It contains sufferance or patience. James 5. 7, 8.
Heb. 10. 36. Be of patient mind, and stabl^sh your hearts. For ye have need of
patience.

31. The fourth is Temperance, whereby all those desires which divert men from
well-doing are assuaged and restrained: and so it makes virtue undefiled. 2 Timothy
2. 4. None that goes a warfare entangleth himself. 1 Pet. 1. 13. Gird up the
loins of your mind, be sober, etc. It is often called in Scripture Sobriety
when that word is used in a more general sense, as 1 Pet. 1. 13. and 5. 8. And
purity or cleanness of heart. 1 Timothy 1. 5. 1 Peter 2. 22. And also sincerity,
as it does exclude pollution of any mixture. This force of the word is showed 2
Cor. 1. 12. With simplicity and sincerity of God, not with fleshly wisdom.

32. Of these four conditions of virtue, the first does order and as it were
constitute virtue: the second does direct and free it from error: the third
does strengthen it against inconveniences: the fourth makes it pure, and
defends it against all allurements which do seduce it.

33. All these virtues do seem to be prescribed, and explained together and
almost by name. 2 Pet. 1. 4. and 6. Ad to Faith Virtue: that is Justice or an
universal rectitude: to virtue knowledge, that is, Prudence directing aright
all your ways: to Prudence continence, that is, that temperance whereby ye may
contain your selves from all allurements of pleasures, wherewith men use to be
fleshed, and drawn away from the right way: to continence patience, that is
fortitude, whereby ye may endure any hardship for righteousness sake. But that
which follows there of piety and charity does contain a distribution of
virtue, to be propounded in his proper place.

34. Yet because every of those affections do more appear in some virtues
then in other, therefore some special virtues do take both their name and
definition from them: for because an accurate rectitude does most appear in
the number, measure, weight, and value of those things which are mutually
received and given by man, therefore Justice, in a certain special manner is
wont to be placed in things of such sort. And because those inconveniences are
held most terrible, which are wont to happen in war and such like dangers,
therefore the name of fortitude is wont to be restrained to such things.
Because the pleasures of the senses are wont most to tickle, therefore
temperance is for the most part placed in them only; although those three
together with Prudence taken in a general sense, are tied and folded together
among themselves, as that Philosopher did observe, who did first almost
propound those four heads of virtues.

35. Whereas the form of virtue is placed by many in a certain mediocrity
between two vices in the extreme, that can be defended by reason. 1. Because
privation is not the form of an habit; but mediocrity, is nothing else then a
privation of a defect and an excess. 2. Because the form of virtue is to be
sought in that conformity which it has to his rule: But this conformity does
neither only, nor chiefly, nor sometime at all consist in mediocrity. 3.
Because virtue in its formal respect cannot be too much intended, and so does
not admit excess, but either in that material thing which it has common with
vices, or in the circumstances of operations, as when some of them are
exercised when they ought not, or are not excercised when they ought.

36. That mean which is found in all virtues, is no other thing then a
conformity to their rule, or measure: for by this they have certain measures
and bounds in which their nature is as it were contained, so that they may not
decline to the right hand or to the left, but by this reason mediocrity is no
more the form of virtues, then of all other things which are distinguished
from other things by certain forms and differences.

37. But those virtues which consist in the middle between two vicious habits,
are not therefore virtues because they consist in the middle, but because they
do in that manner consist in the middle as their rule prescribes; in which
manner, mediocrity whether of participation or negation, Rei vel rationis, of
the thing, or of a respect, is to be considered rather as a subject matter,
then as a perfecting form.

38. But it is manifest that such mediocrity has no place in some virtues: for
the love of God is not in that respect praised that it is not too much, but
that is is most ardent, here the measure is without measure.

39. There is the like reason of all virtues in respect of their proper and
specificall nature. He that gives when he ought not, is not too liberal: but
he is too much in giving, so that in that respect he cease to be liberal,
and in the same act he may be as much defective in not doing that which he
ought.

40. The wiseman indeed admonishes, Eccles. 7. 16. That we be not just
overmuch, but this is not at all to be understood of Justice in its nature (for
it follows Verse 20. that there is none just upon Earth who does good and
sinned not) but as it is in opinion, whereby many do challenge too much to
themselves, and would have it attributed to Justice: but in true virtues we
ought always to endeavor to this, that we may more and more abound, as in the
holy Scriptures we are often admonished.

41. There be no degrees in virtue of one and the same kind, if it be
considered in it self in the extent. For there is no virtue which at least in
disposition does not extend it self to all those things which are contained in
the compass of its object. He is not temperate which does moderate himself in
one ^st, and favors himself in others; but in respect of the subject some
virtue is more strong in one then it is in another, either by reason of a more
apt disposition by nature, or because of greater accustoming, or because of a
more perfect judgment of reason, or finally because of a geater Gift of GOD.

42. That which is wont to be said, that virtues are increased by daily use and
exercise, that must be so understood in solid virtues proceeding from
sanctifying grace, that daily exercise is the disposing cause, and by virtue of
the promise of God in some sort the procuring cause, not principally or
properly effecting such an increase of virtue.

43. But virtues are lessened by the opposite vicious acts, and in respect of
the disposition which they bring, and by reason of the merit that is in them.

44. By how much the acts of virtues, or contrary vices are more intent, more
frequent and more continual, so much the more they prevail, either to the
increasing or diminution of virtues.

45. Hence is that distinction of virtues into humane and heroical; into
virtues purging, purged and exemplary: and of those that are endued with
virtue, into Infants, and men of ripe age. Heb. 5. 13, 14.

46. The communion of virtues is both in the connection and subordination of
them among themselves.

47. For connection is that whereby all virtues which are simply necessary, do
cleave together among themselves. 1. In respect of the beginning from whence
they flow: For every good giving, and every perfect gift descends from the
Father of lights; By the spirit of grace. James 1. 17. 1 Cor. 12. 2. In respect
of the end and intention, which is to the same thing in general; for all
virtues do so respect God, that if his authority be violated in one, it is
withal virtually violated in all. James 2. 10. 3. In respect of that helping
endeavor which they perform mutually one to another. For one virtue does
dispose to the act of another, and also does defend and confirm the same with
the act.

48. Yet virtues are not so essentially and intrinsecally knit together, that
every one is of the essence of the other, or does necessarily depend upon it as
upon a procreating cause.

49. Subordination of virtues is that whereby the act of one virtue is ordered
to the act and object of another, either as a means to an end which is the
command of a superior upon an inferior virtue as Religion commands Justice
temperance, and the like, when it refers their acts to the furthering the
worship and glory of God; or as a cause to its effect, which belongs to every
virtue in respect to every one: for so Religion it self is ordained to bring
forth and conserve Justice.

50. Whenever the act of one virtue is ordered to the end of another virtue,
this ordination although in respect of the direction it depends upon Prudence,
yet in respect of the effectual force and authority, it depends upon a
superior virtue.

CHAPTER III.
Of good Works.

1. AN action of virtue is an operation flowing from a disposition of virtue.
Mat. 12. 35. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth
good things.

2. In the same sense it is called an action or work that is good, right,
laudable, and pleasing to God.

3. Unto such an action there is required first a good efficient or beginning,
that is, a will well disposed, and working from true virtue; for good fruits
do not grow but out of a good Tree. Mat. 12. 33. Secondly, a good matter or
object, that is something commended by God. Mat. 15. 9. In vain they worship
me, teaching doctrines which are the Commandments of men. Thirdly, a good end,
that is the glory of God, and those things which tend unto his glory. 1 Cor.
10. 31. Do all to the glory of God.

4. But the end and the object are oftentimes all one, both in good and evil
actions, especially in the intention and election of te will, where they end it
self is the proper object. For those acts are either conversant in the end it
self, as in the matter or object, as the acts of desiring, willing, wishing,
loving, enjoying; or in those things which tend to the end as they are such, so
as the goodness or deformity is properly derived from the end.

5. For although that good intention or intention of welldoing which is
general and confused does not make a particular action good, if other
conditions be wanting: neither does a special intention of good suffice for
it, if the means be evil: as if any intending to bestow any thing on the
poor or upon pious uses should to that end take to himself other men's goods:
yet an evil intention does always make an action evil, and a good intention
with other conditions does make very much to the constitution of a good action.

6. But there is required to an action truly good, that at least virtually it
be referred to God, as to the chief end.

7. In the fourth place also, there is required a form or a good manner, which
is placed in the agreeing of the action to the revealed Will of God.

8. Moreover this will of God does inform an action of man, as far forth as it
is apprehended by reason. Hence the very conscience of man is the subordinate
rule of moral actions: so as every action must agree with a right conscience,
and an erring or doubtful conscience is first to be laid down before a man may
do against it; although a lighter scruple or sticking of conscience must not
any way put off any action otherwise approved.

9. But that this form or manner be good it requires all the circumstances to
be good, for a singular action is always clothed with its circumstances, upon
which the goodness or evillnesse of it does not a little depend.

10. But those circumstances being referred to the act of the will, do pass
into the nature of an object. For the will whiles it wills some work,
wills all that which is in it, and so all the known circumstances either
expressly or implicitly; and a known circumstance being changed, oftentimes
the act of the will is changed.

11. But the same circumstances being referred to the act of any other faculty
besides the will, are only adjuncts.

12. So the end it self is rightly reckoned among the circumstances, although
not in respect of the will, yet in respect of the faculties and other Acts.

13. By reason of these circumstances it comes to pass, that although many
Acts in the general or in their own nature are indifferent, yet there is no
singular Act that is moral, and deliberate, but it is either good or evil.

14. An Act in its kind indifferent is, when the object of it includes nothing
which pertaines to the will of God, either commanding or forbidding, yet such
acts being in exercise, severally considered, if they be properly humane
proceeding of deliberate reason, are either directed to a due end, and have
conformity to the will of God, and so are good: or they are not rightly
directed, but dissent from the will of God, and in that respect are evil.

15. Besides actions good, evil, and indifferent, some do observe that there
are some acts that do Sonare in malum, have an evil sound, that is being
absolutely considered they do impart a certain inordinatenesse, but by some
circumstances coming to them they are sometimes made good, as to kill a man,
and the like: but even those acts ought to be referred to indifferents; for
they only seem to have some evil in themselves: as also to free a man from
danger of death seems to have some good in it self, with which show also
many that are not evil are deceived: but the true goodness, or pravity of
these actions depends upon the object, and other circumstances: to slay the
innocent or set at liberty the guilty is evil; to slay the guilty justly, or
deliver the innocent upon just reason is good.

16. The goodness of all these causes and conditions is collectively required
for an action absolutely good, but the defect of some one makes the action so
far forth evil.

17. Hence our good works, whilst we live here, are imperfect and impure in
themselves.

18. Hence they are not accepted before GOD, but in Christ.

19. Hence in the works of the regenerate there is not that respect of merit
whereby any reward is obtained by Justice.

20. Yet that reward which is imputed not of debt, but of grace, Romans 4. 4. is
sometime assigned to those imperfect endeavors, Mat. 5. 12. Because although
all our blessedness is the mere gift of God, Romans 6. 23. Yet the fruits of
grace abounding in us, are put upon those accounts whereby we do get the
certainty of that gift. Phil. 4. 17. I require that fruit abounding which may
be put on your accounts.

21. The action of virtue is either inward, or outward. 2 Cor. 18. 10. 11. To
will, to do, to perform.

22. The internal action is properly of the will it self.

23. The external action is of another faculty distinct from the will; whether
it be of the understanding, or of the sensitive appetite which is commonly
called internal, or of the executive power which is usually called external.

24. The internal action of the will has goodness or evillnesse so
intrinsecall, that an act cannot remain the same in the nature of it, but it
must be the same in manners; but an outward act may remain the same in nature,
and yet become another in manners: namely of good may become evil, and of
evil good: As if any one beginning to walk out of an honest purpose, do
persist in his journey for an evil end.

25. There is one and the same goodness or evillnesse of an internal act, and
an external commanded by it: for it is the same act in kind of manners; For to
will to worship God, and from that will toward God, are not two acts of
obedience, but two degrees of one and the same act, so that the goodness of
the one is perfited in the other, 2 Cor. 8. 11. Perform to do that very
thing: that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance.

26. The outward act without the inward is not properly, good or evil: but the
inward is good or evil, without the external; because the goodness of an
action depends first and chiefly upon the will, which is often accepted with
God, although the outward work it self be absent. 2 Cor. 8. 13. If there be
first a ready mind, one is accepted according to that he has.

27. But as virtue in its own nature tends to an act (for it is a disposition
to do well, neither is it idle) so the internal act of it tends to an
external, and produces it, and in it is lead to its end. James 2. 22. Thou
see that Faith was the helper of his works, and by works Faith was brought
to its end.

28. Yet the external act joined with the internal does not properly and by
it self increase the goodness, or evillnesse of it in respect of the
intention only; but by accident it does increase it, as it does continue or
increase the act of the will it self.

29. The goodness and evillnesse of any act, which depends upon the object and
the circumstances of the act, is in respect of its nature in the external act,
before it be in the internal, although in order of existence it is first in
the internal. For to will to give every one his own is therefore good,
because this thing, to give every one his own is good: yet the goodness does
exist in the act of willing before in the act of giving. So to will to steal
is evil, because to steal is evil. The reason is, because the exterior act
is the cause of the inward, in order of intention, and the inward act is the
cause of the outward in order of execution.

30. But that goodness or evillnesse which depends upon the end, is first in
the inward act, and after in the outward; because the very intention of the end
is the inward act of the will; so-to-forsake the World for righteousness sake
is good, because to will righteousness is good, and to give alms for vain
glory is evil, because it is evil to will vain Glory.

31. Obedience that appears in outward actions, without the inward is
hypocrisy, and so is not indeed obedience, but a certain shadow of it.

32. Yet inward obedience without outward, although it be incomplete; yet it is
true: and if there be an effectual will present, so that opportunity, or
ability of executing is only wanting, it is no less acceptable to God, then if
it had an external act joined with it. 2 Cor. 8. 12.

33. Therefore we must not judge of actions good or evil by the event. For
although it is equal, and God himself wills, that he that is judge of
offenses among men, do incline to the more fovourable side, if the event it
self do favor. Exodus 21. 21. and so forward: yet before the tribunal of
God, the inward sin is as great caeteris paribus other things answerable, when
neither event not outward act follows, as if both should follow. Mat. 5. 28.
Whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already
with her in his heart.

34. Yet inward obedience is not of it self sufficient because the whole man
ought to subject it self to God: our bodies are to be offered to God, Romans 12.
1. He is to be glorified in our bodies. 1 Cor. 6. 20. Neither is that true
inward obedience which does not incline to external.

35. The works which are called works of supererogation, whereby the Papists
do boast that some of theirs do perform more excellent works then are
commanded in the Law of God, by the obsevation of certain counsels which they
faigne do not command, but counsel only a singular perfection, are the
dotings of idle men which know neither the Law nor the Gospel.

36. Unto the best works of the faithful there adhereth that imperfection
which has need of remission: yet the works themselves are not sins.

CHAPTER IIII.
Of Religion.

1. OBservance is either Religion, or Justice.

2. This distribution as touching the thing it self is made by God in the
division of the decalogue, as it is enfolded by Christ. Mat. 22. 37. Also the
sense of the same distribution is expressed in other words, Romans 1. 18. Where
all disobedience of man is distributed into impiety and injustice, which could
not stand unless all obedience also were conversant in Piety and Justice:
which is also more plainly opened. Tit. 2. 12. Where of those thres thing
propounded. Righteousness and Piety, do make the parts of new Obedience, and
Temperance notes the manner or means of performing the same, namely denying
worldly lusts.

3. Unto the same also that distribution of a Christian life tends, which is
more frequently used, into holiness and righteousness. Luc. 1. 75. Ephesians. 2.
24. And the same is the meaning of that distribution which is of love toward
God, and love toward our neighbor.

4. Yet we use the names of Religion and Justice, because Religion is a word
most general, containing all those duties which are owing to God, and it is
most emphaticall, because it expresses that proper and distinct way whereby
they are due to God. Acts 26. 5. James 1. 26, 27. And often in the Epistle to
the Hebrews.

5. Religion is Observance, whereby we perform those things which do directly
pertain to the bringing of honor to God. Romans 1. 21. When they knew God,
yet they glorified him not as God, neither were they thankful.

6. Therefore this neme is not amiss by some said to be derived a Religando
from binding again, because in this part of obedience we do directly and
immediately tend unto God, that we may cleave, and as it were, be tied to him.

7. It has the first place in observance, 1. Because obedience toward God
must necessarily begin, from God himself, and from those affections, and acts
whereby we are carried toward him. 2 Cor. 8. 5. They gave themselves first to
the Lord, and then to us by the Will of God. 2. Because Righteousness toward
men, must be performed by force and virtue of Religion, that it may be true
obedience toward God, for it would not be obedience toward God, unless it
did bring honor to God: neither could it bring honor to God, unless it
should proceed from a religious affection. 1 Cor. 10. 31. Do all to the glory
of God: whereunto that phrase also belongs. In the Lord, in the Name of the
Lord. Col. 3. 17. And as to the Lord, and not to men. There Verse 23. 3.
Because Religion has command over the acts of Justice, and is the cause of
them not only virtually effecting, but also directing and ordering. James 1.
26. If any seem to be religious among you, not refraining his tongue, but
deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain. 4. Because religion is in
a certain manner the end of all the acts of Justice, as far forth as they
dispose to the act of religion, as a certain greater thing.

8. Hence Justice it self is sometime called religion in the Scriptures. There
Verse 27. But religious worship, pure, and without spot before God, and the
Father is to visit the fatherless, etc. Not only because it is a sign which
is not separated from true religion, but also because it ought to be exercised
by the command of religion, and have its beginning from it.

9. Hence the offices of religion a re the first and chiefest. Mat. 6. 33. and
22. 37. First seek the kingdom of God. The first and great Commandment.

10. They are the first in order, so that they ought to be taken care for in
the first place, There.

11. Hitherto pertaines that phrase, which every where we meet with in the
Psalms, of seeking God early in the morning.

12. Also they are chief in dignity, and so chiefly to be cared for. Mat. 10.
37. He that loves father or mother above me, is not worthy of me.

13. Hence the duties of religion ought to be performed with more intent and
stirred up forces then the duties of Justice, for that rule pertaines properly
to them, not to these, to love with all the heart, all the soul, and all the
thought. Mat. 22. 37.

14. Which yet must not be so understood, as if all the strength were not also
required in performing and fulfilling the duties of the second table, but. 1.
Because this is principally required in the duty of Religion. 2 Because it is
not required in the other dut is in respect of our neighbor, whom they do
immediately respect; b^ in respect of God, and by virtue of religion. 3. Because
one may love his neighbor with too much intention as touching the very
material act of loving, although this cannot be done under the respect of
virtue and love, but we can no way love God with too much intention.

15. Hence, if some duties of piety and justice cannot be performed together,
an equal and prudent comparison being used, the duties of piety are to be
preferred. Mat. 12, 46, 47, 48. Luke 2. 49. Behold my mother and my brethren,
why did ye seek me? knew ye not that I must go about my fathers business?

16. But an equal comparison is, when a just proportion is observed of the
greatest to the greatest, and of the lesser to the less.

17. But because God is more worshipped with the inward affection then with the
outward work, but men do more need the outward work: therefore the outward
work of religion may sometime be omitted, that a necessary work of Justice,
and mercy may be fulfilled. Matthew 12. Verse. 1. 3, 4. 7. 10. 12. I will have
mercy and not sacrifice, etc.

18. Neither yet is religion in the mean while by this means violated,
because religion it self does command to omit an external work, that a
necessary may be performed.

19. The immediate object of religion unto which it is carried, is God: and that
so adequate, that no duty of religion may be referred to any other object
without greatest injury to God; hitherto pertaines that title of God whereby he
is said to be Zelotes, Zelotypus, zealous or Jealous.

20. But that respect, under which religion does consider God, is that Divine
excellency, which shines f^rth in his sufficiency and efficiency; it is not
some one attribute, but a perfection arising of all his attributes. Ex. 34. 6,
7, 8. Iehova Iehova the strong God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and
full of loving kindness and truth, etc. Therefore all the attributes of God
have some power to beget religion in us, and so, in the Scriptures, the
special respect of it is referred, sometime to mercy, Psalm. 130. 4. with thee
is pardoning, that thou may be reverently worshipped: sometime to Justice.
Deuteronomy. 4. 24. Heb. 12. 29. Let us have grace, by which we may so serve God, that
we may be accepted of him with reverence and fear. For our God is a consuming
fire. And so also to all the other attributes.

21. Hence religion does immediately flow from that Faith wherewith we believe
in God, as in the sufficient, and efficient cause of life.

22. So is that to be understood which is wont to be said, that religion
respects God as the first beginning and supreme Lord of life. And so that
distinction of the Papists is too empty whereby they confess, that those acts
of religion which respect God as the first beginning of life, are to be
performed only to God, but they contend that other acts of religion may be
communicated to the Creatures also, when there is no act of religion which does
not belong to God, as the first beginning of life.

23. The proper act of religionis to bring honor to God, and it is called
worship. Exodus 12. 25, 26. and adoration, John 22. 23. For it must contain in
a certain manner good unto God, otherwise it should not be obedience toward
him, but there can be no intrinsecal good added to God, but an outward good,
which is honor, that is, a testification of the virtue of another to further
his glory or estimation, and this is all that which the Creature can perform
unto God.

24. Therefore an agreeable or worthy estimation of God, and other acts whereby
an estimation is manifested, do make as it were, the next matter of religion.
And every humane honest act, as far forth as it may be referred to the honor
and glory of God, may be the matter, or matteriall object of religion. Also one
and the same act which in respect of subjection to the precept is called
obedience, in respect of the honor which it brings to God, is called religion
and worship.

25. The proper manner of honor, or religious worship is to subject the soul
it self, and the inward affections and acts of the will to another.

26. For in respect of the soul and inward acts of it, man is not subject
directly and Per se to any Creature, although as the soul is knit to the body,
and the inward acts to the outward, his, as it were necessary, condition does
command that subjection which is due to the Creature as a superior.

27. This honor is due to God, not only according to the agreement of the
thing, in which sense we say, those things are due which we give of liberality;
but also according to the right of the person to whom it is given, and that by
so strict a right, that in respect of the debt it exceeds all Justice, although
in respect of equality it is much exceeded by Justice.

28. Therefore all worship which either by its nature or condition, or by Law,
and common custom, or by the mind and institution of him that gives it does
give religions honor to another beside the true God, it does so far forth at
least feign to it self a new and a false GOD.

29. He that does not give this religious worship to God is profane, he that
gives it to another besides to the true God is an idolater, Acts 10. Revel. 19.
10. and 22. 8.

30. But because greatest care ought to be had in Divine worship therefore
among the Latins the word religion is sometime metaphorically used to set
forth any anxious care, even in things that were not sacred. By which appears
that the Heathens themselves by the light of nature did see, that the care of
Religion is to be prefered before all other things.

31. Also because the fear of conscience pertaines to the worship of religion,
therefore also every scruple of conscience is wont to be called religion,
whence also we may gather, that nature it self does dictate that the
conscience of a man does first and most properly respect religion.

32. The general state of the Church, as it does prefesse a right manner of
worshipping God, is rightly wont to be called the Christian Religion, because
such a relation of a state or profession, ariseih from virtue and the act of
Religion.

33. Those things which by a special institution are destinated to religious
uses as the instruments of religion, are also by reason of their state or fixed
relation which they have, called religious.

34. That peculiar manner of living which the Monks have chosen to themselves
to exercise a certain fained perfection, without any reason, and not without
wrong to other Christians, is wont to be called religion by the Papists, and
such Monks religious persons.

35. He that is not religious, is not a Christian.

36. The true religion is only one.

CHAPTER V.
Of Faith.

1. THE parts of religion are two; natural worship, and voluntary or
instituted worship.

2. This distinction is grounded on Exodus 20. 6. Those words of the second
Commandment: who love me, and keep my Commandments.

3. Natural worship is that which depends upon the nature of God: so that
although we had no Law revealed, and prescribed by God, yet if we did rightly
perceive and know the Nature of God, by a meet contemplation of it, we might,
the grace of God helping us, perceive al those things which in this behalf
pertaines unto our duty.

4. For there is no body who understands the Nature of God rightly, but withal
he does also necessarily acknowledge, That GOD is to be believed and hoped in,
that God is to be loved, called upon, and to be heard in all things.

5. Hence this natural worship is simply necessary to salvation. Psalm. 79. 6.
Ierem. 10. 52. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8. Power out thy wrath upon those Nations that know
thee not, and upon the Kingdoms that call not upon thy name. For although we
obtain eternal life neither by merit, nor by any virtue of our obedience; yet
this part of obedience has such an essential connexi^n with that Faith
whereby we rest upon Christ to life eternal, that in exercise it cannot be
separated from it.

6. Hence also this worship has been, is, and shall be one and the same, or
immutable. 1 John 2. Verse 7. The old Commandment which ye had from the
beginning.

7. Natural worship is commanded in the first precept, not only as it is
internal, but also as it is external.

8. For. 1. All obedience is the same inwardly and outwardly: therefore the
same inward and outward worship is contained in the same precept. 2. In those
precepts which pertain to the second table, inward and outward obedience is
together commanded in every one, Christ himself being interpreter. Mat. 5.
Much more therefore in the precepts of the first table, and in the first and
chief of them. 3. If that distinction were lawful, that the first precept
would command only inward worship, and the second only outward, then the first
Commandment should bind the inward man, and the second only the outward man
and the body, which is contrary to all reason.

9. Natural worship tends unto God, either as our good, or as good in himself.

10. The worship which tends unto God, as unto our good, does either respect
him as he is in present ours, as Faith: or as hereafter he is to be ours, as
hope.

11. Faith is a virtue whereby we cleaving to the faithfulness of God, do
lean upon him, that we may obtain that which he propounds to us. He that
receives his testimony has sealed that God is true. John 1. 12. As many as
received him, who believe in his Name.

12. These five things concur to make a Divine Faith. 1. A knowledge of the
thing testified by God. 2. A pious affection toward God, which causes that
his testimony does most prevail with us. 3. An assent which is given to the
thing testified, because of this affection toward God who is the witness of
it. 4. A resting upon God for the obtaining that which is propounded. 5. An
election or apprehension of the thing it self, which is exhibited to us in the
testimony.

13. The first of these is in the understanding: but it does not make Faith,
because it is common to us with unbelievers, heretics, apostates, and the
devils themselves.

14. The second, fourth and fifth are in the will, and do make Faith as it is a
virtue, and act of religion.

15. The third as in the understanding, but as it is moved by the will; neither
is it properly the virtue of Faith, but an effect.

16. But the perfection of Faith is not but in election or apprehension, and so
is to be defined by it.

17. Hence the nature of Faith is excellently opened in Scripture, when the
faithful are said to cleave to God. Joshua 23. 6. Acts 11. 23. 1 Corinthians
6. 17. And to choose the way of truth, and to cleave to the testimony of God,
Psalm. 1^9. 30, 31.

18. For by Faith we first cleave to God, and then afterward consequently we
cleave to those things which are propounded to us by God: so that God himself
is the first Object of Faith, and that which is propounded by God the secundary
Object.

19. But because Faith as it joins us to God is our life; but as it is a
virtue and our duty toward God; it is a act of life, therefore in the former
part we have defined it only by that respect which it has to obtain life and
salvation; but here we have defined it by tha^ general respect which it has
to all that which God propounds to us to believe. Hence Faith cannot exercise
all its act about the threatenings of God considered in themselves, because they
do not propound the good to be received by us: nor about the precepts of God
simply considered, because they declare the good to be done, not to be
received; nor about mere predications, because under that respect they
propound no good to us. But it is perfect in the promises, because in them
there is propounded good to be embraced: whence also it is, that our Divines
are wont to place the object of Faith chiefly in the promises.

20. They who place Faith in the understanding: do confess that there is some
necessary motion of the will to the yiedling of that assent: even as in humane
Faith it is said to be a voluntary thing to give credit to one. But if Faith
depend upon the will, it must needs be that the first beginning of Faith is in
the will.

21. The Objectum quod, or material object of this Faith is whatsoever is
revealed and propounded by God to be believed, whether it be done by spirit or
by word; publicly or privately, Acts 24. 14. I believe all things that are
written in the Law and the Prophets. John 3. 33. He that receives his
testimony.

22. Hence the propounding of the Church is not absolutely necessary; no not in
respect of us, to make an object of Faith, for then Abraham, and other Prophets
had not given assent to those things which were revealed to them from God,
without any help of the Church coming between, which is both against the
Scriptures and all sound reason, and yet is necessarily admitted and defended
by the most learned of the Papists, that they may defend the fained authority
of their false Church from such arguments.

23. This object is always immediately some axiom or sentence under the respect
of truth: but that in which Faith is principally bounded, of which, and for
which assent is yielded to that axiom by Faith is, Ens incomplexum under the
respect of some good. Romans 4. 21. Being fully persuaded, that he who had
promised was able also to do it. Heb. 11. 13. Not having received the
promises, but seeing them a far off, after they had bin persuaded of them, and
had embraced them.

24. For the act of the believer is not bounded in the Axiom, or sentence, but
in the thing, as the most famous Schoolmen confess. The reason is; because
we do not frame axioms, but that by them we may have knowledge of things.
Therefore the principal bound unto which the act of the believer tends, is the
thing it self, which is chiefly respected in the Axiom.

25. The Objectum Quo, or formal object of Faith is the Truenes or
faithfulness of God. Heb. 11. 11. Because he judged him faithful who had
promised. For the formal, and as they say, the specificative reason of Faith
is truth in speaking, that is, the Truenes, or faithfulness of God revealing
something certainly, because it is a common respect of Faith that it leaves
upon the authority of him that witnesses, (in which thing Faith is
distinguished from opinion, science, experience, and sight or sense) but the
authority of God is his Truenes or faithfulness. Tit. 1. 2. God that cannot
lie had promised. Hence that proposition is most true, what soever we are bound
to believe (with a Divine Faith) is true. For because nothing ought so to
believed, unless God do witness the truth there of: but God testifies as he
is true, but Truenes in a witness that knows all things, cannot be separated
from the truth of the testimony; therefore it must needs be, that all that
which we are bound to believe with a Divine Faith is true. This whole
demonstration is manifestly confirmed and used by the Apostle Paul. 1 Cor. 15*
14, 15. If Christ be not raised, our preaching is vain: your Faith also is
vain; we are also found false witnesses of God: because we have witnessed of
God, that he raised up Christ. That is, If the testimony be not true, the
witness is false. Unless this be admitted, that whatsoever. God witnesses is
true, that consequence which is most firm, should avail nothing at all, God
does witness this or that, therefore it is true. Hence Divine Faith cannot be
a principle or cause; either directly or indirectly, either by it self or by
accident, of assenting to that which is false, or of a false assent.

26. Hence also the certainty of Faith in respect of the object is most firm,
and by how much more it is confirmed in the heart of him that believes, so
much the more glory it gives to God. Romans 4. 20. But he doubted not at this
promise of God through unbelief: but he was strengthened in Faith, giving
glory to God, and being fully persuaded that he that had promised, was able
also to do it. But in that somitime our Faith does waver in us, that is not
from the nature of Faith, but from ^ur imperfe^ion.

27. A sufficient and certain representation of both objects, that is, both of
those things which are to be believed, and of that respect under which they are
to be bel^eved, is propounded to us in the Scripture. Romans 16. 26. It is made
manifest, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets according to the Commandment
of the everlasting God, m^de known to all Nations for the obedience of Faith:
2 Timothy 5. 15. The holy Scripture can make thee wise to salvation; by Faith
which is in Christ Jesus.

28. For al^hough in the subject, that is in our hearts, the ligh^ and
testimony of the holy Spirit stirring up Faith in us is necessary; yet in the
object, which is to be r^ceived by F^h there is nothing at all required, either
in respect of the things to be believed, or in respect of the cause and way of
believing, which is not found in the Scripture.

29. Therefore Divine Faith cannot be reduced or resolved into the authority of
the Church, or into other simple external arguments which are wont to be
called Motives by persuading and inducing things preparing to Faith; but it is
to be resolved into the Scripture it self, and that authority which it has
imprinted upon it from the author God, as into the first and proper cause which
causes the thing to be believed; and into the operation of the holy Spirit, as
into the proper cause of the act it self believing.

30. Hence, that principle from which Faith does first begin, and into which it
is last, resolved, is, that the Scripture is revealed from God for our
salvation, as a sufficient rule of Faith and manners. 2 Pet. 1. 19. 20. If you
first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is (...), of a private
interpretation.

31. Faith is partly Implicit, and partly Explicit.

32. Implicit Faith is that whereby the truths of Faith are believed, not
distinctly in themselves, but in their common principle.

33. That common principle wherein all things to be in this manner believed are
contained, is not the Church, but the Scripture. Act. 24. 14. Who do believe
all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.

34. He that believes that the Scripture is every way true, he does implicitly
believe all things which are contained in the Scriptures, Psalm. 129. 86.
compared with Verse. 28. 33. All thy precepts are truth it self; open mine
eyes, that I may see the wonders of thy Law. ^each me the way of thy statuts,
which I will keep unto the end. David did believe that those were wonderful,
and to be holily kept, which he did not yet sufficiently understand.

35. This implicit Faith is good and necessary, but it is not of it self
sufficient to salvation; neither indeed has it in it self, the true reason of
faith, if it subsist by it self: for it cannot be that the will be effectually
affected, and embrace that as good, which it does not at all distinctly know.
Romans 20. 14. How shall they believe him of whom they have not heard?

36. Explicit Faith is that whereby the truths of Faith are believed in
particular, and not in common only.

37. Explicit Faith must necessarily be had of those things which are
propounded to our Faith as necessary means of salvation. Heb. 6. 1. 2. Cor. 4.
3. The foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith in God. If our
Gospel be hid, it is bid to them that perish.

38. There is required a more explicit Faith now after the coming of Christ,
then before, 2 Cor. 3. 18. Of those who are set over others in the Church then
of the common people, Heb. 9. 12. Lastly, of those who have occasion to be more
perfectly instructed, then of others: Luc. 12. 48. To whom much is given, of
him much shall be required.

39. The outward act of Faith is confession, profession, or manifestation of
it, which in its order, and in its place is necessary to salvation, Romans 10. 9.
10. Namely in respect of the preparation and disposition of mind always
necessary. 2 Peter 3. 15. And in respect of the act it self, when the glory of
God and edification of our neighbors shall require it.

40. Persisting in confession of the Faith with loss of temporal life, does
give testimony to the truth and does bring most honor to God, and so by
excellency is called Martyrdom, and they who do so are called witnesses,
(...) Martyrs. Revel. 2. 13. But this is as necessary in its place as
confession of Faith, so that it cannot be refused without denying of Christ.
Mat. 10. 33. 39. and 16. 25.

41. There are opposed to Faith. Infidelity, Doubting, Error, Heresy,
Apostasy.

42. Infidelity is a dissenting of a man from the Faith, who never professed
the true Faith. 1 Cor. 14. 22. 23.

43. Doubting in him who made profession, does either diminish or take away
assent.

44. Doubting that does diminish only assent may stand with a weak Faith. 1
Cor. 8. 10. 11. But not that doubting which takes away assent. James 1. 6, 7, 8.

45. An error in Faith does put some opinion contrary to Faith. 1 Cor. 15.

46. Heresy adds stubbornness to error. Ti^ 3. 10, 11.

47. Apostasy adds unto heresy universility of errors contrary to Faith, 1 Timothy 1. 19. 20. 2 Timothy 1. 15.

48. These are opposed to Faith not only as they take away that assent of the
understanding which is necessary to Faith, but also as they bring and include a
privation of that election and apprehension of Faith, which is in the will.

CHAPTER VI.
Of Hope.

1. HOpe is a virtue, whereby we are inclined to expect those things which God
has promised us. Romans 8. 25.

2. This Hope respects God. 1. As the object which it does expect, for the
principal object of Hope is God himself, and those acts whereby he is joined
to us, 1 Peter 1. 13. Hope in the grace which is brought to you. Hence God
himself is called the Hope of Israel. Ier. 1. 4. 8. And Romans 15. 13. The God
of Hope: not so much because he is the Author and Giver of hope, as because it
is he, upon whom we hope. 2. It respects God as the Author and Giver of all the
good it does expect. Psalm. 37. 5. 6. Roll thy way upon the Lord, and trust in
him, for he shall bring it to pass: For as, it tends unto God to attain good,
so also it respects him as to be obtained by his own Grace. Jeremiah 17. 7.
Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.

3. But the proper reason why we may not trust upon the Creatures, in that
manner as we trust in God, is because the formal object of Hope is not fo^d in
the Creatures. Psalm. 146. 3. Trust not in Princes, nor in any son of man, in
whom there is no salvation. For although some power of doing us good and
helping us, is placed by God in the Creatures, yet the exercise of this virtue
does always depend upon God. Psalm. 107. Sending his word he healed them. And
Psalm. 137. 1. Unless the Lord build the house, in vain they labor that build
it, unless the Lord keep the City, the watchmen watches in vain.

4. Therefore when one says, I hope this or that of such a man, does either
signify that he hopes for that from God by that Creature, or it sets forth a
humane hope, not Divine, or finally it is not Christian.

5. But as Faith, so also Hope in God does respect the grace of God, and Christ
only as causes of good to be commun cared. 1 Pet. 1. 13. Col. 1. 27. Hope in
the grace. Christ the hope of glory.

6. Yet Divine Hope does not only respect God and eternal blessedness, but in
God, and from God it respects all those things which faith apprehends in the
promises of God, although in their own nature they be temporal things. Heb.
11. 1. 2 Cor. 1. 10. Although it does ciefly respect eternal life: whence also
it is, that Hope in Scripture is often by a metonymy of the adjunct, put for
salvation it self or life eternal hoped for. Gal. 5. 5. Romans 8. 24. Tit. 2.
13. And salvation also is sometime put for Hope of salvation, by a metonymy of
the subject. Epb. 6. 17. Compared with 1 Thessalonians. 5. 8. The helmet of Salvation,
for the helmer of the Hope of salvation. Also usually this object is put as
proper to Hope. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 8. Tit. 3. 7. The hope of eternal life. Romans 5. 2.
The hope of glory.

7. Those conditions which are wont to be required to the object of Hope, as
that it be good, to come, difficult, probable, ^re all sound in the promises of
GOD, who promises always the greatest good things which cannot be had
without his help, but by virtue of the promise will come to pass, not only
probably, but certainly.

8. The act wherewith it is conversant about its object is called expectation,
because it is not of uncertain or probable conjecture only, as humane Hope,
but of most certain expectation. Romans 3. 25. Phil. 1. 20. If we hope for what
we see not, we do with patience expect it. According to my earnest expectation
and hope, and every where in the old Testament, where the word Mikueh which is
wont to be turned, Hope, does properly signify expectation.

9. This certainty is derived to Hope from Faith: for Faith is the foundation
of Hope; neither is any thing hoped for, which is not before believed by Faith.
Galatians 5. 5. For, we through the spirit, wait for the Hope of righteousness
by Faith.

10. For seeing Faith apprehends that which is promised, and Hope expects that
which is promised; the whole difference between Faith and Hope, is the respect
of that which is present, and that which is to come.

11. Therefore that distinction of the Papists is empty and vain, who granting
that the faithful may be certain of their salvation with certainty of hope,
yet do deny, that they can ever by ordinary means be made certain of it with
certainty of Faith, when there is one and the same certainty altogether of
Faith and Hope: for which reason also it is, that Hope in Scripture, especially
in the old Testament, is often put for Faith.

12. Therefore that expectation of good things to come which is in the Angels,
and the spirits of just men in Heaven, does not in that differ from our hope,
because one is certain, and the other incertaine: but in these. 1. That our
hope is grounded upon Faith, which beholds God in the promises, as through a
glass, and darkly, 1 Cor. 13. 12. But their expectation is grounded upon open
sight. 2. In that our hope is with labor and contention, but their expectation
is without all difficulty. 3. In that our hope is an imperfect expectation, and
their expectation is perfect.

13. Therefore although Hope together with Faith is wont to be said to be
abolished in the life to come: yet this is not so to be understood, as if they
ceased to be in respect of their essence, but only in respect of the measure
and degree of imperfection. 1 Cor. 13. 10. So that the imperfection only is
properly to be abolished: but Faith and hope it self are to be perfected in
respect of their essence.

14. Hence Christian confidence as it respects good to come, is nothing else
then Hope confirmed. For it must necessarily be referred to some one of those
theological virtues which are reckoned up by the Apostle. 1 Cor. 13. 13. That
is, either to Faith, or to Charity, or to Hope. But it can neither be referred
to Faith, because Faith apprehends a thing as now present, which it makes also
to subsist. Heb. 11. 1. Nor to Charity, because Charity does not respect good
that is ours. 1 Cor. 13. 5. Therefore to Hope.

15. Hence the natural fruit of Hope is Joy, and delight in God, Heb. 3. 6.
The hope whereof we rejoice. 1 Pet. 1. 3. 6. A lively hope, wherein ye
rejoice. Because it does respect the greatest good things not only as possible
and probable; but also as certainly to come, and so does make the possession of
them in a certain manner to subsist, whilst it does assure us of that which
at length shall in very deed subsist. To. 8. 24. We are saves by Hope.

16. The manner of this act depends upon that respect of the object, whereby it
is said to be, to come, and promised. So that in its formal reason, it is not
of those things which are seen. Romans 8. 24. Hope if it be seen, is not
Hope; for why does a man hope for that which he sees?

17. Hence the fruit and companion of Hope is patience toward God, whereby we
do constantly clave to him in seeking and expecting blessedness, although we
do in this present life conflict with diverse evils, even without that
consolation we do desire, Esaias. 8. 17. Waiting upon the Lord who has hid his
Face and looking for him. Romans 8. 25. But if we hope for that we do not see,
we do with patience expect it. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 5. That patient expectation.

18. A fruit of this patience is silence, whereby we rest in the will of God,
and do repress all those carnal things whereby we are stirred up to make
have, or to resist him. Psalm. 37. 7. Be silent to Jehovah, and without ceasing
wait on him.

19. Hope is strengthened and increased, by all those arguments, whereby we are
assured that the good hoped for pertaines to us. Romans 5. 4. Experience causes
Hope.

20. Among these arguments the inwatd signs of Divine grace have the first
place. 1 John 3. 14. 19. We know that we are translated from death to life,
because we love the brethren.

21. Therefore although it is most false which the Papists say, that our hope
is grounded partly upon the grace of God, and partly our own merits, it may
bemo^ truly affirmed, that hope is strengthened, increased and stirred up, by
Faith, repentance, works and a good conscience. So that true and lively hope
does exist by those as it were antecedent arguments. Heb. 10. 22. 23. 1 Pet. 3.
23.

22. The effect of hope is the confirmation of the soul as an anchor, safe,
and firm. Heb. 6. 19. Whereby we possess our very souls. Luc. 21. 19.

23. There follows always from this confirmation of mind a study of
holiness. 1 John. 3. 3. Whosoever has this hope in him, keeps himself
pure, even as he is pure.

24. There is opposed to hope by way of defect. 1. A fear of the evil of
punishment, Psalm. 27. 3. For as Hope is the expectation of good, so this fear
is an expectation of evil.

25. But this fear, if it be moderate and tempered by Faith, although it be
always materially opposed to Hope yet in man that is a sinner, it is not so
formally opposed to Hope and virtue, that it is simply a vice, but rather puts
on the consideration and nature of a virtue, 2 Chronicles. 34. 27. Because thy heart
was tender, and thou did cast down thy self before the Face of God, when
thou heardest his words against this place, etc. The reason is because the
opposition is not, Secundum idem, and ad idem, according to the same, and unto
the same; for hope respects the grace of God, and fear respects the deserts of
our sins.

26. Also desperation is more directly opposed to hope, in the defect, which is
a mere privation of hope joined with a sense of that privation, and
apprebension of the thing hoped for, as of a thing impossible, or at least as
to come, such as was in ^ne. Genesis 5. 13, 14. And in Iud^. Mat. 27. 4. 5.

27. This desperation is always a grievous sin: because it is not a privation
of that hope which men are wont to have in themselves or other Creatures, which
is wont to be a laudable introduction to Divine hope, but it is a privation of
Divine hope, having its beginning always from unbelief, as hope has its
beginning from Faith.

28. Yet desperation in the Devils and damned, has not the consideration of a
sin, but of a punishment. For desperation may either be taken privatively when
one does not hope that which he ought to hope, and when he ought, or negatively
for a mere cessation of hope. In the former sense it is always a fin because
it is contrary to the Law, but in the latter sense not so.

29. The reason of despairing may be diverse, either because the grace of God is
not accounted sufficient to communicate that good to us, or because God will
not communicate it. As desperation is grounded on the former reason, it is
always a sin, but in the latter sense it is not a sin, if so be any be
certain of that will of God.

30. But because it is seldom or never manifest to any one by ordinary means
before the end of this life, that God will not make him partaker of grace and
glory: Therefore there is no desperation of men in this life which is not a
sin.

31. By way of excess presumption is opposed to hope, whereby we do expect
some good rashly. Deuteronomy. 29. 19. Ier. 7. 4. 8, 9, 10. Let there not be any man,
when he has heard, etc.

32. This rash presumption does in expectation of good sometime lean upon the
Creatures. Ierem. 17. 5. 1: Tim. 6. 17. Sometime also it does lean on God in
some sort, but perversely without a promise, and Faith, as when any looks for
pardon and salvation, although he remain impenitent, or retain a purpose of
living in his sins, or expect some other thing of God which does noth agree to
his nature or revealed will.

33. But one does not therefore sin in this presumption, because he hopes too
much upon God, namely with a true and religious hope, for this can in no wise
be done but because he hopes too lightly and rashly without any ground, or
hopes those things also which are not to be hoped.

34. Also shame of face, or confusion is opposed to hope, in respect of the
event. Ps. 25. 2, 3.

CHAPTER VII.
Of Charity.

1. CHarity is a virtue whereby we love God as the chief good. Psalm. 106. 1.
And 118. 1. and 136. 1. Praise the Lord, because he is good, for his mercy
endures for ever. The joy of praising which is an effect of Charity has the
same primary object with Charity its proper cause. Therefore the goodness of
God which does specially shine forth in the effects of kindness, is the proper
object of Charity (as it is of praising.)

2. It follows Faith and Hope in order of nature, as the effect follows its
causes: for we therefore love God out of Charity, because by Faith and hope we
taste in some measure how good God is, and his love shed abroad in our hearts. 1
John 4. 16. 19. We have known and believed the love which God has toward us,
we love him because he loved us first.

3. Therefore not love, but Faith is the first founda tion of the spiritual
building in man: not only because then the building begins, but also because
it sustaines, and contains all the parts of it as also it has the nature of a
root, as it does confer power to fructify.

4. A confuse and remote inclination toward God goes before Faith (a certain
shadow* whereof is found in a certain manner in all Creatures) Acts 17. 27-
That they might seek the Lord, if happily they might find him by seeking him,
but it is rather an ineffectuall Velleitas woulding (as they call it) to love
God, then a true love.

5. That distinction of the Scholemen, between the natural and supernatural
love of God, that is, whereby they make one love of God, as it is the beginning
and end of nature, and another as it is the beginning and end of grace, is an
idle figment. Neither indeed can a man since the fall, by the strength of
nature without Faith, love GOD above all, no not with that love which they call
natural.

6. The love of Charity is of Union, well-pleasednesse, and good will: for
those are as it were the parts of Charity, and they are always contained in
it, if it be true, namely desire of Union, wel-pleasednesse of enjoying, and
affection of good will.

7. Love of Union is that affection, whereby we would be joined together with
GOD. 2 Corinthians 5-8. It is our desire to be absent from the body, and to be
present with the Lord.

8. There is also love of Union, in GOD toward us. Ephesians. 2. 4. 13. He loved us
with much love. You who were far off, are made near. But his love is out of
the abundance of goodness, because he expects no profit out of us: for we are
unprofitable servants to GOD. Luc. 17. 10. John. 22. 2. 23. But our love
toward him is out of the want of goodness, because we stand in need of God.
2. Cor. 5. 4. We groan being burdened -- that mortality may be swallowed up
of life.

9. Therefore our love as it is love of Union with God, is in part, that love
which is called love of concupiscence or desire: because we do properly desire
God to our selves, because we hope to have profit from him and our eternal
blessedness.

10. Yet the highest end of this love ought to be God himself.

11. Love of wel-pleasednesse is that affection, whereby we do approve of all
that that is in God, and rest in his most excellent goodness. Rev. 7: 12.
Blessing and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor and power, and
strength unto our God for ever, and ever, Amen.

12. God also has love of wel-pleasednesse toward us, Heb. 13. 16. But his
wel-pleasednesse is in those good things which are communicated by him to us:
but our wel-pleasednesse is in that goodness, and Divine perfection which in
no sort depends upon us.

13. Love of good will, is that affection whereby we yield our selves wholly to
God, and we will, and endeavor that all things be given to him which pertain
to his glory. Revel. 4. 10, 11. They fell down and cast their crowns before
the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and
power. 1 Cor. 10. 31. Do all to the glory of God.

14. God in bearing us good will, does make us good, by conferring that good
which he wills: but we cannot properly bestow any good upon him, but only
acknowledge with the heart, publish by words, and declare in some measure by
deeds that goodness which he has.

15. That mutual Charity which is between God* and the faithful, has in it
self some respect of friendship. John 15. 15. I have called you friends,
because I have made known all things which I have heard from my Father.

16. In this friendship although there is not found that equality which is
among men that are friends, yet that equality which is possible does appear in
a certain inward communion which is exercised between God, and the faithful:
in which respect God is said to reveal his secrets to the faithful. Psalm 25,
14. John 15.

15. And to be as it were familiarly conversant with them. Revel. 3. 26. If any
shall hear my voice and shall open the door, I will go in to him, and sup
with him, and he with me. John 14. 23. If any love me, he will keep my Word;
And my Father will love him; and we will come to him, and dwell with him.

17. Charity does implicitly contain in it the keeping and fulfilling of all
the Commandments of God* Romans l 13. 10. 1 John 2* 5. and 3. 18. For he cannot
truly love God who does not study to please him in all things, and to be like
him. 1 John 4. 17. Herein is our Charity made perfect -- that as he is, such
also are we.

18. The manner of our Charity toward God is that it becaried to him, as to
that which is simply the highest good and end; so that neither God, nor the
love of God is principally and lastly to be referred to any thing else: because
such love should be mercenary. John 6. 26. Ye seek me, because ye ate of the
loaves and were filled.

19. Yet we may love God as our reward. Genesis* 15. 2. And with respect, of
other good things, as of a reward. Genesis 17. 2.

20. The degree of Charity toward God ought to be the highest, first in
respect of the object, or as they say objectively, that is, willing a greater
good to him then to any. 2. In regard of esteem, or as some speak,
appretiatively, that is, preferring him and his will before all other things,
even our own life. Matt. 10. 37. Luc. 14. 26. So that we rather choose to die
then to transgress even the least of his Commandments. 3. Intensively, that
is, in respect of the vehement endeavor, in the application of all the
faculties to the loving of God. Deuteronomy. 6. 5. Thou shall love the Lord thy God,
with all thy heart, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.

21. According to this description of Charity it is rightly said of some
Divines, that God is only to be loved: that is, simply, by it self and
according to all the parts of Charity (namely with affection of good will,
desire of Union, and wel-pleasednesse of enjoying in the highest degree)
although our neighbor also is to be beloved in a certain respect, for another
thing, in part and in a lower degree.

22. To this Charity is opposed that fear which has torment, by the presence
of God and fear of punishment to be in-flicted by him, 1 John 4. 18. Perfect
love casts out fear: because fear has torment.

23. Hence Charity being perfected casts out fear. Ibid. Because that fear
is an horror arising from the apprehension of evil, by reason of the presence
of God: and so is opposed to Charity, which is carried unto God, as unto that
which is absolutely good.

24. Secondly, there is opposed to it an enstranging from God, which is called
by some hatred of abomination. Psalm 14. 3. John 3. 20. They are all gone out
of the way. He hates the light, for as Charity consists in affection of union,
so this enstranging is in disjunction. But that hatred of God is most contrary
to the love of God, which is called hatred of enmity. John 13. 23, 24, 25. They
have hated both me and my Father. For as the love of Charity is in good will:
so this enmity against God, is in that that ungodly men do desire and will ill
to him if it might be, that he were not, or at least that he were not such an
one as he is.

25. For although if God be apprehended so as he is in himself, he cannot be
the object of hatred; yet as he is apprehended as one that takes vengeance on
sinners, so far forth he is often hated of the same sinners: because in that
respect he is most contrary to them, Ioh. 3. 20. Whosoever evil does, hates
the light, neither comes to the light, least his deeds be reproved. For as
the love of God is in the godly the cause that they hate impiety contrary to
God; so the love of iniquity in the ungodly causes that they hate God as
contrary to their iniquity.

26. But the degrees by which men ascend to this height of ungodliness are
these. 1. Sinners love themselves inordinatly. 2. They will that which pleases
themselves, although it be contrary to the Law of God. 3. They hate the Law:
because it is contrary to this desire. 4. They hate God himself who is the
giver and author of such a Law.

27. The love of this world also is opposed to the Charity toward God. 1 John
2. 15. Because this world agrees not with God and his will. There Verse 16. If
any love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. Because whatsoever is
in the world is not of the Father.

28. For as the perfection of Charity is in this that the mind does rest in
God, so it must needs be against Charity that the mind does rest in that which
is contrary to God.

29. Charity is no more the form of other virtues, then any virtue commanding
or ordering the acts of another is the form of it: but because those acts
which in their nature do not respect God are referred to him by Charity, and
in him such acts are perfected, therefore by a metaphor it is not amiss called
the form of those acts, and of the virtues also from which they come.

30. But Charity cannot be the intrinse call form of Faith: because in its
nature it follows Faith as an effect follows the cause, it does not go
before as a cause does the effect.

31. Neither is faith extrinsecally directed toward God by love; but in its
proper and internal nature it respects God as its object.

32. Justification of Faith does in no sort depend upon Charity (as the Papists
will have it) but upon the proper object of Faith.

33. Where Faith is said to work by love. Gal. 5. 6. It is not because all
efficacy of Faith depends upon charity as upon a cause: but because Faith does
show forth and exercise its efficacy in the stirring up of Charity.

34. The particle, by, does not there show a formal cause: but as it were an
isntrumental: as when God is said to regenerate us by the word.

35. That Faith which is without works is said to be Dead. James 2. 26. Not
because the life of Faith does flow from works: but because works are second
Acts, (...) flowing from the life of Faith.

36. Faith is said to be perfected by works. James 2. 22. Not with an
essential perfection, as the effect is perfected by the cause: but by a
complemental perfection, as the cause is perfected, or made actually complete,
in the producing of the effect.

37. Because the object of Charity is the very goodness of God, as it is in it
self, but Faith and Hope do respect God as he is propounded to us to be
apprehended: therefore that inclination of the mind toward God which belongs to
Charity, does more evidently and constantly appear in weak believers, then
the special acts of Faith or Hope: because the goodness of God is more
manifest in it self, then the way of apprehending it; which is represented to
us in this life, as it were darkly.

CHAPTER VIII.
Of hearing of the Word.

1. FRom these virtues of Religion toward God, Faith, Hope, and Charity, there
arises a double act of Religion which respects that spiritual communion which
is exercised between God and us: Hearing of the word, and Prayer.

2. The reason or foundation of this distribution is in this, that we do
affect God with religious worship, when we yield him due honor, whether this
be by receiving that which he him self propounds to us, or by offering that
which may be received by him according to his perfection; for in both respects
we do that which is immediately, and directly honorable to God.

3. The first act of Religion therefore is about those things which are
communicated to us from God: and the other is about those things which are
yielded to God from us.

4. Hearing the word is a religious receiving of the will of God.

5. Therefore hearing is here taken for any receiving of the words of God,
whether they be communicated to us by preaching, or by reading, or any other
way, because God is wont to work in a singular manner, and by his own
institution in the preaching and hearing of the Word.

6. Therefore this word ought not to be taken so strictly, that it should
either chiefly, or necessarily include always the outward sense of hearing:
but that it may note any percieving of the will of God, and chiefly set forth
an inward receiving and subjection.

7. The receiving of the Word consists of two parts, Attention of mind, and
intention of will.

8. Attention is an applying of the understanding to perceive the revealed will
of God. Acts 16. 14. The Lord opened the heart of Lydia, that she might attend
to the things which were spoken by Paul. It is often called in the Scripture
especially in the Old Testament, A seeking of the will of God, or of God
himself, to set forth that great desire wherewith we should be carried to know
Gods Will, as to the finding out of some thing which we can by no means want.
Esaias 58. 2. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways; as a Nation
which does righteousness and does not forsake the judgment of their God, they
inquire of me the ordinances of Justice, they delight in approaching to God.

9. In this attention there needs that providence whereby we may discern,
what that is that God wills. Romans 12. 2. That ye may prove what is that
good, pleasing, and perfect Will of God: which when it is perceived, we must
not deliberate further, whether it be good, or to be observed or no: for the
will of God itself is the last bound of all religious inquiry. Gal. 1. 15. 16.
When it pleased GOD to reveal his Son in me, I did not consult with flesh
and blood.

10. Intention is an applying of our will to a religious observance of the will
of God already perceived. Psalm. 119. 106. I have sworn and will perform it,
that I will keep thy righteous judgment.

11. The purpose of the intention ought to be so strong and firm, that without
all exception we be ready to observe whatsoever God will command. Ier. 42. 5,
6. The Lord be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even
according to all things for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us:
whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord
our God.

12. In respect of this intention the Law of God it self is said to be in the
heart of a believer. Psalm. 40. 9. and 119. 11. Ier. 31. 33. Heb. 8. 10.

13. This hearing that it may be right, ought to be from religious observance,
bringing subjection of the inward acts, and inclinations of the mind. Romans 6.
17. From the heart ye obeyed that form of doctrine to which ye were
delivered.

14. But that it may be truly religious, It is requisite, first that it arise
from Faith, whereby we believe that to be the word of truth which God reveals
unto us, and also are accordingly affected toward it. Hebr. 4. 2. The word
being heard did not profit them, not being mingled with Faith in them that
heard it. Luc. 24. 32. Did not our hearts burn in us whilst he spoke to us?

15. By this Faith we cleave to the word. Psa. 119. 31. And the word it self
cleaves unto, and is ingrafted in us, unto salvation, James 1. 21. That
ingrafted word.

16. Secondly the same hearing must flow from that hope, whereby we do embrace
that which God has promised as the word of life, also expecting life by it*
Deuteronomy. 32. 47. John 5. 39. It is your life, ye look in them to find eternal
life.

17. By this hope it comes to pass that the faithful bring forth fruit with
patience. Luc. 8. 15.

18. In like manner it must have love joined with it, whereby we cleave to the
same word, or to God revealing himself to us in that word as simply good. Psa.
119. 97. How do I love thy Law. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 10. They received not the love of
the truth, that they might be saved.

19. In respect of this love the Word of God does dwell plentifully in the
faithful, Colossians 3. 16. So as they are also transformed into the form and
fashion of it, Romans 6. 17.

20. Such an Hearing of the Word of God is the true, and proper worship of God.
1. Because it does immediately and directly bring spiritual honor to God, for
although the act of hearing is most properly directed to our receiving of the
Will of God, yet because in the manner of receiving we do subject our
consciences to God, therefore we give him that honor of power, and Divine
truth in the aknowledgement whereof his religous worship is exercised. 2.
Because it contains a direct, and immediate, exercise of Faith, Hope, and
Love, in which the worship of God does most essentially consist.

21. Hence no word or sentence of men, ought to be mingled with the word of
God, and propounded in the same manner with it, least by this means we do in
some sort worship men instead of God.

22. Unto this hearing that pride is most formally opposed whereby one does so
affect his own excellency, that he will not be subject to the Will of God. For
although this pride is contrary to humility of religion, and obedience, or
obedience in general, yet it seems to be most properly opposite to them in
this act of religion: because a proud man, as he is such, is so far from
subjecting himself to the will of another; as to a Law, that he would have his
own will in stead of a Law. Ierem. 13. 15. Hear and give ear: be not proud;
for the Lord has spoken. Ier. 5. 5. They have broken the yoke, they have burst
the bonds.

23. The proper act as it were of this pride is that contempt whereby one does
set at naught either God or the Will of God and observance of it, 2. Sam. 12.
9. Why have thou despised the Word of the Lord, in doing that which is evil in
his Eyes.

24. Hence pride is said to be the cause of all other sins, for a double
reason. 1. Because all other sins are referred in a certain manner to that
excellency which is seen in pride as to an end. 2. Because pride casts away
from it self in contempt the government of the word, by the power whereof
alone sin is avoided.

25. Hence there is in every sin found some respect of pride, but especially in
those which are committed upon deliberate counsel.

26. Hence also all consultation with the world; flesh or wisdom of the flesh
in those things which pertain to religion, is opposed to the hearing of the
Word. Romans 8. 7. Gal. 1. 16.

27. For as by pride men do altogether reufse to subject themselves to the
will of God: So by these consultations of those things which are not after God,
they do seek to themselves as it were other Gods, to whom they may be subject.

28. The most accursed opposition to hearing of the word of God is in
consulting with the Devils. Esaias 8. 19. Deuteronomy. 18. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Where a
certain religious Faith, and Hope due to God only is transferred either
explicitly or implicitly to the enemies of God.

29. Hence it is that Faith is wont chiefly to be required in such
consultations by those who are the masters of such Arts.

30. By virtue of this Faith there is a certain covenant entered into with the
Devil, with some religion; if not openly and eypressively, at least secretly
and implyedly.

31. But although one have not a direct intentation to ask counsel of the
Devil, yet if he do that which either of its own nature, or by use and
application which it has does infer a compellation of the Devil to receive
his help or counsel, he is made partaker of the same sin.

32. Therefore all arts brought in by instinct of the Devil, for the knowing
of secrets are in this respect to be condemned.

33. All divination therefore which is neither grounded upon certain
revelation of God, not the course of nature ordained by God in things created,
is to be condemned.

34. All applying of things or words either to predictions, or those operations
to which they have no disposition, either by their nature, or Gods Ordinance,
is to be condemned.

35. As the help of the Devil is sought by such like courses, they do
contain in themselves a certain invocation of him, and so are opposed to
calling upon God: but as certain revelation is expected, or a submission of
mind used to the receiving and executing his commands, so they are opposed to
the hearing of the word of God.

36. This communion therefore with the Devil is not only in this respect
unlawful, because it is joined with fraud and seducing, but also because of
its own nature it is contrary to true religion.

37. For we have not civil communion or fellowship with the Devil: religious
communion we cannot have, no not as some of old had with the good Angels, who
are ministering spirits, for our good sent of God for that purpose.

38. Whatsoever therefore we do with the Devil besides those things which
pertain to the resisting of him as the enemy of our souls, it makes to the
violating of true religion, and is a certain perverse religion.

39. If he seem sometime to be subject to the command of men, by virtue of
certain inchantements, it is only a show of subjection, that by that means he
may more easily rule over men: therefore he does not hinder, but only color
that religious subjection which men perform to him in that communion.

40. All those do in part communicate with such sins, who by words, figures,
and such like things of no sufficient virtue, do desire to cure diseases in
others, or suffer such things in themselves or others for that end.

41. Sympathies, and Antipathies, and specificall virtues which are found in
some things are hereby differenced from such inchantements, in that the common
experience of all men, does acknowledge these: there is some Faith required in
those; but in these none.

42. A strong imagination does peradventure concur in many to make these
means effectual; but that also does often arise from a certain religious
Faith: neither can it effect any thing in parents for children, or in men for
Cattle, without a certain diabolical operation accompanying it.

43. They that are most given to the hearing of the word, as they do least of
all care for such acts, so they do receive the least fruit by them.

CHAPTER IX.
Of Prayer.

1. PRayer is a religious representing of our will before God, that God may be
as it were affected with it.

2. It is an act of religion, because of its own nature it yeildeth to him that
is prayed unto that sufficiency and efficiency of knowledge, power, and
goodness which is proper to God.

3. Hence it cannot be directed to any other beside God only, without manifest
idolatry.

4. It arises first from Faith. Romans 10. 14. How shall they call on him in
whom they have not believed? Namely from that Faith whereby we do believe that
God is first omniscient, who knows all things, and so the inward affections
and motions of our hearts, for in them chiefly the essence of Prayer does
consist: secondly, that he is omnipotent, who can do what he will in
fulfilling our desires; thirdly, that he is the author and giver of every good
thing: Fourthly, that he does allow and accept our Prayer through Christ.

5. Hence all our Prayers are to be offered to God in the name and mediation of
Christ, by the power of a justifying, Faith. John 14. 13. 14. and 16. 23.
Whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name.

6. It arises also from that hope whereby we expect the fruit desired from our
prayers from God. Romans 8. 23. 26. We groan expecting the adoption: The spirit
makes request for us with groans that cannot be expressed.

7. Lastly, it arises from Charity, whereby we desire both to partake of and
celebrate the goodness of God. Psalm 34 4. 9. Magnify the Lord with me, and
let us extol his name together. Taste and see that the Lord is good, blessed is
the man that trusts in him.

8. Hence Charity to our neighbor also is necessarily required that Prayer be
accepted of God. The fifth petition of the Lords Prayer.

9. Prayer differs from hearing the word, in that hearing is conversant about
the will of God, but Prayer about our will: in hearing the word we receive the
Will of God, but in Prayer we offer our will to God, that it may be received by
him.

10. But it is not a simple will or desire, but a representation of the will or
the will exhibited and represented before God. For it is not sufficient to
prayer, that we desire to have something, for so profane men, because they do
most desire to have, should pray most; but there is required also a desire to
obtain that of God, and a will to seek the same of him, and then a
representing or insinuating of this desire before God.

11. But this representation is done first and essentially in the will it
self, as it being converted to God, does as it were by an act stretched forth,
represent unto him its inclination and desire.

12. Hence the Prayers of the godly are called in the Scriptures desires, Psalm.
10. 17. And unspeakeable groans Romans 8. 26.

13. In the second place and by way of sign; this representation is made in
the understanding, as it conceiving an inward word, does express the
affections of the will before God.

14. Hence the prayers of the faithful are also called words, and speeches
whereby they speak to God, not first and chiefly outwardly, but inwardly. Hos.
14. 2. Take unto you words, and turn unto the Lord. Say unto him, pardon, etc.

15. Prayer therefore is formally an act of the will: yet withal there is
required to it both an antecedent act of the mind whereby we understand, what,
of whom, for what, and how we must pray; and a consequent act whereby we
conceive and express with a certain word of the mind, prayer it self.

16. Hence together with intention or the act of the will, there is also
required attention in Prayer, both to God to whom we pray, and to the thing
whereof we pray, and also to the Prayer it self; for we must not only pray
with the Spirit, but with understanding also. 1 Corinthians 14. 15. I will pray
with the spirit, I but will pray with understanding also.

17. This representation must be submisse and humble, for otherwise it would
not be a religious praying directed from a subject Creature to the highest God
and Creator, but either a command of a superior to an inferior, or a familiar
conference as it were, such as is among equals. Genesis 18. 27. Behold now I
would speak unto the Lord, although I am dust and ashes. Psalm 95. 6. Come
let us bow, and fall down, and bend the knees before the Lord that made us.

18. The general end of Prayer is, that we may as it were affect or move GOD;
whence it is that the faithful are said by their prayers as it were mightily
to prevail with God, Genesis 32. 28. Hos. 12. 4, 5. And as it were to strike,
Romans 15. 30.

19. For although that difference is true which some put between those prayers
which are directed to men, and those which are made to God: that they that pray
to men do affect those to whom they pray, and in some measure dispose them to
that which they desire: but those who pray to God, do not so much affect God
as themselves, and dispose themselves to those things they desire: yet God is
pleased so to commend the force and efficacy of Prayer to us, that he declares
himself to be affected, and as it were moved with it. And that because our
prayer is the means, by the interceding of which, and no otherwise, God will
Communicate many things unto us, whence also they who ask some thing of GOD,
are said to afford help to effect it, 2. Cor. 2. 11.

20. For we do not therefore pray to God that we may make known our desires
to him not knowing them, who understands always a far off. Psalm. 139. 2. That
is, when as yet they are not in our minds: neither that we may move him to our
mind who was unwilling, with whom there is no change or shadow of turning.
James 1. 17. But that we may by our prayer obtain that of him which we believe
he is willing to. 1. John 5. 14. This is our confidence which we have toward
God, that if we ask him any thing according to his will, he hears us.

21. Hence the firmness and unchangeablenesse of Gods providence does not
take away, but establish the prayers of the faithful, and the most sure
apprehension of it by Faith does not make the true believers slothful, but
does more stir them up to pray. 1. Chr. 17. 25, 26, 27. Thou O my God, have
revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou will build him an house.
Therefore has thy servant been bold to pray before thee, etc.

22. Hence also we must pray instantly and continually; instantly, because our
prayer is a necessary means for Gods glory, and our good. Continually, because
such a disposition of will is never to be cast off, and the act of it also is
daily to be exercised, as occasion is offered to us.

23. The adjuncts of Prayer are confession, and a promise made to God: for
these two are always either expressly or implicitly used in every acceptable
Prayer to God, and in every part of it.

24. For because we do by Prayer fly unto the mercy of God, as to the
fountain of all good, either communicated, or to be communicated to us, in so
doing we confess that we are miserable in our selves and destitute of all
good, because also we endeavor as it were, to affect and move God by our
desires; therefore also we profess that our minds are sutably affected about
the same things, and do promise them to be so affected for time to come;
neither can such like affections be absent from our prayers, without a certain
mocking of GOD.

25. Confession is an humble and penitential acknowledgement of our offense,
gultinesse and misery. Ps. 32. 5.

26. The end and use of this confession is. First, that God may be justified
and may have glory in his judgments. Psa. 51. 6. Secondly, that we may be
disposed to obtain the glory of God. Psalm. 3. 25. Thirdly, that the grace that
is granted, may more clearly appear.

27. The manner is diverse, according to the diversity of sinners. For sins not
known, are to be confessed generally. Psa. 19. 13. But known sins specially,
even according to the nature and grievousnesse of every one, Ezra. 9. 14.

28. A promise required in Prayer is a testifying of a purpose agreeable to
Prayer.

29. This purpose is a determination of the will to prosecute that with an
earnest endeavor, which we pray to God that it may be, Psalm. 119. 106. 112.
Compared with the following verses.

30. But we prosecute that we pray for, both by those means which of their
own nature are necessary to that end, and also by other means, the
determination whereof depends upon contingent circumstances, and upon our
election.

31. A promise of the latter kind made to God distinctly, and upon deliberate
counsel, is by a certain appropriation called a vow.

32. Hence every vow must be, First, of a thing neither impossible, nor simply
necessary, but which may be freely performed according to our pleasure by the
ordinary favor of God. Secondly, of a thing neither evil nor vain, but
lawful and good in respect of all circumstances. Thirdly, it must be referred
only to God as the object to whom we vow, and to his honor as the prime end,
although it may be ordered to ours, and others edification and use.

33. Prayer in respect of the manner is either ejaculatory, or a short lifting
up of the desire, where the mind does either not wholly, or not long attend
Prayer. Psalm. 129. 8. Nehem. 2. 4. Or a continued order of Praying.

34. That ought to be more frequent, as that which cannot be hindered by
ordinary businesses; but this must be at set times, as being more solemn, and
not admitting the distraction of other thoughts.

35. But both of them is either mental, or vocal.

36. Mental is that which is performed in the will, mind, and affection,
without any sign purposely adjoined. Nehem. 2. 4. 1. Sam. 1. 13.

37. Vocal is that which draws forth the inward desire of the mind even in
words. Hos. 14. 2.

38. The voice is often times necessary in prayer to express, stirup, continue,
and increase the inward affection of the mind: for although the affection ought
to go before the voice, and the voice to be conformable to the affection; yet
whilst that it is religiously expressed by the voice, it has a certain
reflection upon the mind it self, whereby it is more enkindled, and gets
greater strength. The voice also is necessary in its measure, that the body may
together with the soul be exercised in this part of religion.

39. Hence therefore neither is that speech to be used which he that prays
understands not, and whereby he cannot express his conceivings; for such a
repeating of unknowen words is not properly the speech of a man, because it is
no more formed of the inward conceivings then those words which are sometime
uttered by a Parrot, and so it cannot distinctly express the inward
conceivings of the mind, in which prayer does primarily consist.

40. Neither also must the speech be long, or repeating the same thing often.
Mat. 6. 7. Unless it be out of the abundance of the heart; for then neither
long prayers, nor diverse repeatings are vain or to no purpose; but most
acceptable to God: as does sufficiently appear by approved examples of such
prayers which are mentioned in the Scriptures.

41. Neither finally ought there to be such care of words which may any way
diminish due attention, either to God, or to the subject matter, or to the
inward affection of the mind.

42. In vocal prayer if it be solemn, there are also those gestures required
which become the majesty of God, our baseness, and the nature of the matter it
self.

43. Vocal prayer is either in prose, or in Meter.

44. In meter singing is joined, and therefore there must be more care of the
speech and tone, then in prose.

45. But the melody of singing is ordained for a certain spiritual delight,
whereby the mind is detained in the meditation of the thing that is sung.

46. For there is a more distinct meditation comes between the word, and the
lifting up of the heart, then in other prayers: so that the next and immediate
fruit of a Psalm, is our edification in Faith and obedience.

47. Yet because the lifting up of the heart to God is together required, Simul
and consequenter, and going along with the thing that is sung, and it is also
the end of that meditation; therefore we are said to sing in our heart to the
Lord, Col. 3. 16. And Psalms that are sung have the consideration of Prayers.

48. But because this religious melody has the respect of prayers: therefore
it is not so fit, that the decalogue, and other such like which do not partake
the nature of prayer be turned into Meter, and be sung in stead of Psalms.

49. But because singing does immediately respect our edification, and also does
set forth in its own nature, a certain gladness of the mind, James 5. 13.
therefore the very same gestures which are meet in other prayers, are not
required in such like exercises.

50. Secondly, prayer is either solitary, or with others.

51. In that which is had with others if it be prose, one goes before in
voice, and the rest follow in affection, and Faith, which they ought to
declare, in the end, by saying, Amen. Nehem. 8. 7. 1. Cor. 14. 16.

52. Hence, Alternatio precum enterchanging of prayers by Anthemes:
distribution of parts between the Minister and People; and repeating of words
propounded by the Minister, by the subsequent voice of the people, is not to be
approved.

53. But in the melody of singing, because it tends to our mutual
edification, attention, and stirring up of pious affections among us one toward
another, Col. 3. 16. Therefore all do join their voices together. 1.
Chronicles 16. 35. Marc. 14. 26.

54. In those prayers which are had with others, such speech must be used which
is understood of others. 1. Co. 14.

55. Hence that broken music which excludes understanding, must be absent from
those sacred exercises of piety at least which we have with others.

56. The kinds of prayer are two, Petition, and thanksgiving. Phil. 4. 6. In
every thing let your requests be made known to God in prayers, and
deprecation, with giving of thanks.

57. Petition is a prayer of that which is wanting, that we may obtain it
Matthew 7. 7. Ask, and it shall be given you: Seek, and ye shall find;
Knock, and it shall be opened to you.

58. Always that which we ask is wanting, either wholly, or in part, or in our
feeling, or finally in respect of the act, or in respect of the continuance of
it.

59. Hence, a sense of our emptiness and want, together with an apprehension
of sufficiency, whereby our insufficiency may be supplied, is necessarily
required to make a petition aright.

60. The virtue and efficacy of petition is not in deferring, or in satisfying,
as the Papists would have it, but in impetration only.

61. To impetrate is properly to have the force of a means to obtain some
good freely from another.

62. Therefore all good works, or all observance, although as it flows from
Faith, has some power to obtain blessings from God by virtue of that promise,
whereby he appoints a free reward to them; whence also Real Prayer
distinguished from vocal and mental, is called by some a good work, although
very improperly: yet petition, does obtain in a special manner, not only as
it is a chief part of obedience, but also because it has in its proper nature
this end and use, as it is a formal act of Faith and hope, by which we receive
all good things from God.

63. But this impetration does not properly respect the justice of God, but his
mercy and kindness.

64. Hence we receive every good thing we ask, not from the hand of justice,
but grace.

65. Petition, because it does most formally flow from Faith and Hope,
therefore it is in the same manner conversant about good things to be asked as
those virtues are conversant about their secundary objects, that is, those
things which they apprehend, are to be communicated to us from God.

66. Hence those things only are to be asked absolutely which are necessary for
Gods glory and our salvation: but other things with a secret subjection to the
most wise disposing of God.

67. Hence both the manner, and particular time to communicate this or that
upon us, ought not to be prescribed to God in our prayers; yet it is lawful to
pray God to hear us speedily, Psalm 102. 3. Hear me speedily. Because he
has promised to do this, Luke 18. 8. He will avenge them quickly. Yet we
may not define the fit time of this hastening.

68. But because petition flows also from Charity, hence those things also are
to be desired, and asked in prayers, which do most make to the celebration of
the glory and goodness of God.

69. Hence also we ask not only for our selves, but for all other also, who
either or may be pertakers with us of the same goodness of God. 1. Tim. 2. 1,
2, 3.

70. The Patriarchs and Prophets did not only in their blessings pray well when
they uttered their desires, but also did promise well in the name of the Lord;
the Hebrew words are wont to contain both, Let God give, or God shall give.
Genesis 27. 30.

71. Therefore although we may not peculiarly pray for the dead, because such
prayer has neither precept nor commendable example in Scriptures, nor finally
any use or end: neither may we pray for all and every one living collectively
that they may be saved; because we know the contrary is determined by God; yet
we ought not wholly to reject any man living in particular from the communion
of our prayers, neither for any enmity, nor for conjectures, or probable signs
of reprobation.

72. Petition is twofold according to the respect of the object or thing which
is asked for it is either Apprecation, or Deprecation.

73. Apprecation is petitioning for good things to be communicated.

74. Deprecation is petition for evil things to be removed. Intercession which
is joined to these two, 1. Tim. 2. 1. is a peculiar manner of deprecation,
namely, when that evil which we desire to be removed is placed in some injury,
done by men.

75. Unto deprecation there belongs, Complaints and lamentations, as adjuncts
of it.

76. Complaint is a signification of our grief, of miseries as they are
injuriously inflicted by men.

77. Unto these complaints imprecation is sometime joined, whereby we wish some
evil to those who are authors of evil. But this is ordinarily no further
lawful, then as it has the force of deprecation, for the removing some
greater evil by that evil which we wish to them, but the prophetical
imprecations were also predictions.

78. Lamentation is a signification of our grief, of those miseries as they
are sent by God.

79. Sometime fasting is added to deprecation as an outward adjunct.

80. Fasting is an abstinence from the helps and comforts of this life,
whereby humility is showed as it were in a real confession, and we are made
the more fit to make more effectual prayers. 1. Cor. 7. 5. Joel 1. 14, 15, 16.
Dan. 9. 2. 3.

81. Hence fasting considered by it self is not a good work, and part of our
obedience toward God, but as it disposes us to make more free, ardent, and
more continued Prayers.

82. Hence also the same measure and time of fasting is not equally profitable,
and necessary to all and every one.

83. Finally hence that way of fasting is most religious, when the whole mind
is so attent to seek God, that thereby it is called a way from the thought and
care of those things, which pertain to the life present.

84. Thanksgiving is prayer, of those things which we have received, that the
honor may be given to God. Ps. 50. 15. 23. I will deliver thee, that thou
may glorify me. He that offers praise does glorify me.

85. It is Prayer no less then petition, because whilst we give thanks to
God, we do represent our will with a religious submission before God, that he
may be as it were affected or moved, although not properly, to that end that we
may receive something from God, but rather that we may refer something we have
received unto him.

86. It is most properly of those things which we have received: because we
must first be affected with the sense of a benefit, before we can give thanks
to GOD in respect of it.

87. Yet thanks must be given, not only for those things which we have
actually and really received, but also for those things we apprehend by Faith
and Hope; partly because the promise it self of these things is a benefit,
which in some sort is already said to be bestowed; and partly because the
things promised are apprehended with that certainty, that they do affect the
mind as things present.

88. Also that celebration of the praises of God belongs to thancksgiving,
which is exercised about those perfections which are in God himself, and do
shine forth in his works; but with a certain respect to those things we have
received, namely as those perfections are arguments that do either illustrate
that good which we have received, or confirm the bestowing of it, Rev. 4. 8,
9. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty -- the living Creatures gave glory, and
honor, and thanksgiving to him who sat upon the Throne.

89. Hence for the right performance of thanksgiving there is required. 1. A
knowledge of the blessings of God. 2. An applying of them to our selves by
Faith and Hope. 3. A due estimation of them, together with an affection
beseeming.

90. The proper end of thanksgiving is to give the honor to God, for all those
things which we have received. Psalm. 50. 15. For if we so think of the good
things we have received, that we either rest in them, or glory in our selves,
or ascribe them only to second causes, then thanksgiving is corrupted.

91. Hence thanksgiving is a secundary end of every religious petition: for he
that does rightly ask any thing of God, does not only ask therefore that he
may receive, much less that he may spend it upon his lusts, James 4. 3. But
that that which is received may be again referred to the glory of God who gave
it. 2. Cor. 1. 11. You helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on
our behalf.

92. Hence in every petition, thanksgiving for that benefit which is asked, is
expressly or implicitly promised.

93. Hence thanksgiving in it self is more perfect and more noble then
petition: because in petition ofttimes our good is respected, but in giving of
thanks Gods honor only.

94. Hence thanksgiving is more attributed to the Angels, and to the blessed
Spirits in the Scriptures, then petition.

95. By this act we are said not only to praise, and celebrate God, but also to
extol, bless, magnify, and glorify him, and the like: all which are so to
to be understood, that they seth forth only a declaration, not a real
effecting of those things they make show of.

96. If thanksgiving be more solemn, there must be sometimes a cheerful
solemnity joined with it. Esth. 9. 19. For as a fasting when we deprecate a
greater evil does both cause, and testify our humiliation to be the greater;
so in solemn joy for some special good communicated to us, outward mirth if
it be moderate, and within the bounds of Temperance, does make and testify the
same to be the greater.

97. Evils as evils can neither be the object of petition nor thansgiving:
yet afflictions as they are so directed by God, that they do work together
for our good, may have the respect of both.

CHAPTER X.
Of an Oath.

1. THere be two manners of petition to be used upon occasion, which were
brought in by reason of man's infirmity: an Oath, and a Lot.

2. But because these two manners are brought in upon such occasion, therefore
they must not be usually frequented, but then only to be used where humane
necessity requires, and a weighty and just cause is in hand.

3. An Oath is a requesting of Gods Testimony to confirm the truth of our
testimony. Heb. 6. 13. 16. Men swear by him who is the greater: and an Oath
for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.

4. An Oath became necessary after the fall of man, because man by (...) had
lost both that credit which ought to be given to his simple testimony, and that
also which he ought to have given to the testimony of others.

5. That infirmity of man in giving credit to the testimony of others, is so
great that it was in a manner necessary for God himself also to demean
himself to confirm his testimonies by the form of an Oath. He. 6. 13. 17.
Which was more then needed in respect of Gods faithfulness, but not in respect
of humane infirmity.

6. Yet God seeing he has not any greater or superior Judge, Heb. 6. 13. He
cannot properly swear, but this is prescribed to him metaphorically: because
all that perfection of confirmation which is found in the Oaths of men, does
most perfectly agree to those testimonies of God.

7. But Gods Testimony is worthily called upon to confirm truth: because he is
the highest truth who can neither deceive nor be deceived, Heb. 6. 18. It
cannot be that God should lie.

8. Hence in an Oath the worship of religion is given to God, as he is both
acknowledged the Author of truth, and to be conscious of all our roughts, as to
whose eyes those things are naked and open which are most secret to all
Creatures, and the rewarder of truth and falsehood, and who provides for all
things by an admirable providence, as being the living God. Deuteronomy. 6. 13 Fear
the Lord thy God, and worship him, and swear by his name.

9. Hence we may not swear by any Creature, but by God alone, who only is
omniscient, the only law giver, and rewarder of those things which pertain to
conscience, and finally to be only religiously worshipped. Mat. 5. 34. 35. and
23. 21. 22. James 5. 12.

10. Yet every thing considered in an Oath is not properly the worship of God,
because it does not directly tend to give honor to God: but to confirm the
truth; but that request which is made in an Oath is worship, and in that
respect to swear by the true God, does sometime in Scripture set forth true
worship. Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Esaias 48. 1. And an Oath it self is wont to be called
worship.

11. In this requesting of the testimony of God, he who swears does make
himself subject to Gods vengeance and curse, if he give false testimony, that
is, if wittingly he deceive. Hence in every Oath there is implicitly or
expressly an imprecation or cursing contained, Nehem. 10. 30. 2. Cor. 1. 23.
Entered into a curse and an Oath. I call God to witness against my soul.

12. Hence is that form of swearing, which is very frequent in the old
Testament. So do God to me, and more also in which words there is a general
or indefinite curse contained, that the way of inflicting the evil may be
committed to God.

13. Therefore there is so great religion of an Oath that it may admit no
equivocation or mental reservation; which things may have their place in play
or ligher Jesting, but cannot be used in the worship of God without great
impiety. For this is nothing else but to mock at GODS Judgment.

14. Hence also there can no release, properly so called, commuting, or
dispensation, and absolution from an Oath, come from man: although some oaths
which were either unlawful from the beginning, or afterward become so, may be
by men pronounced to be void.

15. Because it is a testimony of a thing done, or to be done, therefore an
Oath that confirms a testimony is distinguished into an assertory, and
promissory Oath.

16. An assertory Oath is of a thing past, or present. 2. Cor. 1. 23. A
promissory Oath under which a comminatory is contained, is of a thing to come.
1. Samuel 20. 12, 13, 14.

17. An assertory Oath, because it is of a thing already done, does not bind to
do any thing, but does only confirm the truth of the thing done.

18. But this assertion does immediately respect the judgment of him that
swears, being grounded on those arguments which are wont to be called
infallible, so as an Oath that agrees with such a judgment, is to be accounted
for true, although it should differ from the thing it self: because it does
not respect the thing it self, but by means of such a judgment: whence also
the Romans did use that most considerate word I think, even then when being
sworn they spoke those things which they were sure of.

19. A promissory Oath has in it the force of an assertory Oath, as it
tes^ifieth a present firm intention of the mind, but it does moreover bind to
do that which is declared to be intended.

20. But it binds so far only as one can bind himself, that is, to that which
both Defacto and dejure in deed and in right, he may perform, and so must be
always of a thing lawful and possible.

21. Such an Oath binds to the fulfilling of it, although the Oath was
unlawful in respect of the manner, or the thing promised bring damage with it
to him that promised. Ios. 9. 19. Ps. 15. 4.

22. But if the Oath be against the Commandments of God, it does not bind:
because an Oath ought not to be a bond of iniquity.

23. Yet an Oath made in some manner against the command of God does sometime
bind, as when the Jews to whom freedom was promised, did swear to be subject
to strangers into whose power they came.

24. A promissory Oath whereby something is promised to man only for his sake,
does cease to bind, if he to whom the promise is made, does either remit or
take away that foundation whereupon it was grounded.

25. An Oath is lawful and honest for Christians. 1. Because it is of the Law
of nature, or moral Law which is not abrogated. 2. Because it pertaines to
Gods honor, and Charity to our neighbor. 3. Because there are commendable
examples of Oaths used even in the new. Testament. 2. Cor. 1. 23. Rev. 6. 10.

26. Christ in the fifth of Matthew does not condemn every Oath, but such as
are rash, indirect, and made by the Creatures.

27. James Chap. 5. Ver. 12. Does condemn the same abuse of an Oath, and not
all swearing, whereby his repeating the words of Christ he does manifestly
show, that those words of Christ swear not at all, do make one sentence with
those that follow; neither by Heaven, etc. And so are to be understood as
joined together, not divided asunder.

28. Amen, Amen is not a form of swearing, but only of a grave asseveration.
Those words, Hebr. 6. 14. Surely blessing I will bless thee, do not contain
the form, but the matter only of that Oath which is, Genesis 22. 16. 17. neither
does the word, Amen, appear there, either in the Greek or Hebrew, as some
have rashly imagined.

29. The words of an Oath are to be interpreted in the Court of conscience,
according to the meaning of him that swore, if he dealt simply and heartily: if
not, then according to his meaning, whom he would deceive, or to whom he swear.
But in the outward Court the words of them that swear, are to be taken as
they are commonly understood.

30. A perjured man is not to speak properly, but such an one, that either
swears against his conscience or witt^ngly and willingly departs from that
which he did lawfully swear.

31. Faith that is confirmed by a lawful Oath, is to be kept, the same
circumstances remaining, even to enemies, thieves, and Pirates: for if the
respect of the persons does not make the Oath unlawful: it cannot make it of
no force.

32. An Oath that is extorted by fear, does not cease to bind in that respect:
because those acts which are said to be extorted from a man by fear, if they
proceed from counsel, they are simply voluntary, although not absolutely
Spontaneous, or of good will.

33. They that do not use reason so as they cannot understand the nature of an
Oath, are not capable of an Oath.

34. To require an Oath of him who will swear by false Gods, is not of it
self a sin. Genesis 31. 53.

35. An Oath of a Christian man given concerning his innocence, which cannot be
reprehended by any certain arguments, ought to put an end to controversies
pertaining thereto. Exodus 22. 11. Heb. 6. 16.

36. A simple Oath made only in words binds as the most solemn Oath.

37. That solemnity which is used in some places in touching and kissing a
book, is altogether of the same sort with the lifting up or stretching forth
of the hand, that is, it signifies a consent to swear, and to the Oath it
self.

38. The putting of the hand under the thigh of him that required an Oath, Genesis
24. 2. was not for any mystical signification of Christ, but for a sign of
subjectio^.

39. Adjuring is (to speak properly) that whereby one does draw another either
to swear, Genesis 24. 8. Or to that religion which is in an Oath. Numb. 5. 21.
Matthew. 26. 63. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 27.

40. Therefore it does most properly pertain to those who have power to
require an Oath of others, although in a certain proportion it is also
extended to that religious obtestation, which inferiors sometime use toward
their superiors, and equals among themselves.

41. To adjure the Devils, is to exercise command over them, and so it is not
lawful for any to exercise adjuration toward them, unless he have received
special power from God to that purpose.

42. Those exorcismes which were used before Baptism even in the time of the
Fathers, were superstitious.

43. The adjurings, or exorcisings of things without life, and consecrations of
them to supernatural operations and uses, such as the Papists use in their
holy Water, Temples, Bells and the like, are superstitious enchantments.

44. The adjuring of a man to accuse himself for any crime objected (which is
used in that Oath which is called the Oath of Inquisition or Ex ^fficio) has
neither ground in the Scriptures, and is against the law of nature.

45. Neither is an indefinite adjuring to answer to all such things, as shall
be demanded simply to be admitted.

CHAPTER XI.
Of a Lot.

1. A Lot is a requesting of a Divine testimony to decide some controversy, by
the determining of an event to be manifested in a mere contingency. Pro. 16.
33. The Lot is cast into the lap: but the whole disposition of it is of the
Lord. And 11, 18. A Lot makes contentions to cease, and decideth among the
mighty.

2. We call it a request: because it has that nature, that it expects that use
to which it serves from God alone; and in that respect it has an immediate
respect to his providence.

3. We define it by contingency, that we may avoid the error of those, who
place the common consideration of a Lot in that manner of the efficient cause,
whereby it is said to work by fortune.

4. For there are many fortuitous causes which do altogether differ from the
consideration of a Lot: as when he finds gold, who digging sought for coals:
also there are many Lots wherein fortune is no acting cause, as when the Lot
depends upon the flying of birds, or some such like effects, which is produced
by a cause that works of its own power.

5. Neither can it be Logically defended, that the very cast of a Die, or some
such like effect upon which depends the consideration of a Lot, is always
beside the intention or scope of the agent, which yet is necessarily required,
to fortuitous chance.

6. But we do not place a Lot simply in contingency, but in mere contingency:
because there are three degrees of things contingent: some often happening,
some seldom, and some so far as we can understand, equally having themselves
on either part: for in other Contingents there is some place left to conjecture
by art: but in mere contingency there is none.

7. It is not therefore a fortuitous manner of the efficient cause which is
said to rule in Lots, but either that blind fortune which was made a g^ddesse
by prosane men, and placed in Heaven, or the special providence of God,
working that way that is hidden to us.

8. But seeing that in every Lot there is sought the determination of some
question or controversy, and it is sought by mere contingency, in it self and
in respect of us, altogether undetermined; it must needs be, that the very
determination it self (whatsoever the actual intention of men shall be) be
from the nature of the thing always sought from an higher power, having power
to direct such contingencies, by certain counsel: and so in very deed the use
of a Lot is an appealing always either to the true God, or to some feigned
power, which is wont to be set forth by many by the name of fortune.

9. When therefore our Divines do teach that there is a certain extraordinary
providence of God set over all Lots, they are not so to be taken, as if either
those that used Lots did always directly, and distinctly respect such a
providence, or as if God did always exercise such a providence: but that the
Lot it self, of its own nature has a certain respect to the singular, and
extraordinary providence of God in directing of an event merely conting^nt, and
in this sense their sentence is most true.

10. For seeing that in a Lot some judgment is expected by the common consent
of all, and there is no power of giving judgment in contingent events, neither
is there any other fortune judging then the certain providence of God, it must
needs be that this judgment be in a singular manner expected, from Gods
providence.

11. Neither can mere contingency it self have the respect of a principal
cause in deciding any question: neither can man to whom the event it self is
merely contingent, direct it to attain such an end. It must needs be therefore
that such direction be expected of some superior director.

12. Ad hereunto, that such is the order of proceeding in man's inquiry, that
when men desire some question to be determined, and they have not certain
means in their power for this determination, they seek it from some superior
power: unto which manner of proceeding the consideration of a Lot does
altogether agree.

13. Neither can it stand, that he that works by counsel, intending a
certain end and scope, by certain reason, can subject his action, either to
fortune or mere continge^y as it is such: for so consell should be without
knowledge, and indifferency undetermined should be a means of a cause
determined.

14. Such an expectation and respect to the singular providence of God is
manifestly taught. Prove. 16. verse 33. Whilst the action of every man about a
Lot, is affirmed to be bounded in mere contingency. The Lot is cast into the
lap, and in accurate discerning the whole judgment is referred to GOD. But all
the disposition of it is from the Lord.

15. For although all things are otherwise referred unto Gods providence in the
Scriptures: yet nothing is wont to be referred unto it with such discerning,
unless it have a certain singular respect unto it.

16. Neither does it any thing hinder, that the Hebrew word Mischphath is
sometime wont to signify another thing beside Judgment: because it must
always be taken according to the subject matter; and there is a certain
judgment given to Lots by all who describe the nature of them.

17. Hence therefore a Lot ought neither to be used rashly, nor in sporting or
lighter matters, nor in those controversies which are either vainer, or can be
decided fitly by other ordinary means.

18. Neither theresore it is to be used ordinarily or without special
revelation, to divining, nor to consult of alright, nor ordinarily of a deed
that is past, but of a division to be made, or of an election lawful on both
sides, which cannot otherwise be so fitly determined, that they whom it
concerns would be pleased.

19. The opinion of them who defend playing Lots is sufficiently refuted by
this one reason, that (by the consent of all) a Lot has a natural fitness to
ask counsel of Gods providence in a special manner. For it cannot be that
one and the same action of its own nature should be specially apt to so sacred
an use, and yet withal should be applied to jests, and plays.

20. That reason whereby it is contended, that the use of a Lot is lawful in
light and playing matters, because it is lawfully used in those civil
controversies which are of lesser moment, has no consequence: for although
those civil controversies in which a Lot has place, of themselves are not
great, yet are made very great by the consequences joined with them or adhering
to them: which cannot be affirmed of those spirring contentions.

21. The tithes of the living Creatures. Lev. 27. 32. The orders of priestly
and Leviticall administrations, 1. Chron. 26. 13, 14, etc. Luc. 1. 9. Might
bring with them great inconveniences, unless they had been determined by some
Divine sentence: and in that respect they were appointed by Lot by Gods
institution.

22. It does not appear from the nature of Lots, that they do most agree to
the lightest things: for although we may not expect Gods special determination
unless we have before done so much as in us is to decide the question,
propounded by ordinary means, yet by that our endeavor waightinesse is either
not removed from the controversy it self, or not to be committed to a Lot.

23. The very nature of a Lot is holy, as of an Oath: therefore there is no
need that it should receive special sanctification from any special
institution. For although that contingency which is as it were the matter of a
Lot, is not of its own nature holy, as neither Bread nor Wine ought to be so
esteemed; yet in application to its use, it puts on a certain sanctity, as
the words of an Oath, and the elements in the Sacraments.

24. It is indeed free for Christians to use the Creatures to those ends to
which they are naturally apt, or made apt: But mere contingency has no
aptitude of it self to determine any question, neither does it take any
aptitude by the consent of them who use it to that end. For in those Lots which
are called extraordinary, and are acknowledged to depend upon God, and not upon
men; the same consent is had in the same manner, and yet it adds nothing to a
Lot.

25. None can show that a Lot is indifferent, unless he shall first
demonstrate that there is in it no special appealing to Gods providence.

26. Although also the matter of sporting things, is not tied to this or that
kind of indifferent actions, yet it has those bounds set to it self, that it
can have no place in those things which do singularly pertain to communion
with God.

27. It is altogether vain which is objected, that a Lot often repeated will
have a diverse event: for neither is this likely, if a Lot can be rightly
iterated, neither does every appealing to Gods providnce necessarily bring with
it his special operation: and yet God even out of order is read to have
sometimes answered diversely to those, by whom he was unseasonably tempted,
Numb. 22. 12. 20. Go not with them: Arise, go with them.

28. But much vainer it is to object in stead of an argument, that God cannot
be drawn by us at our pleasure to exercise an extraordinary providence. For
notwithstanding this, we may appeal to his extraordinary providence, when it
pleases us.

29. Therefore playing at Dice is repugnant to religion, not only by the
circumstances and by accident, but of its inward nature and in it self.

30. But under the name of the Dye are those plays also comprehended, which
are grounded on mere contingency, although they be afterward governed by wit,
industry or some art, as in Table, and Cards.

31. But those humane exercises which are grounded upon art, but are in part
subject to casualty in the progress, do greatly differ from Dice.

32. Whereas men are wont, by playing at Dice to be stirred up to swearings,
cursings, and blasphemies, more then in other exercises, this comes partly
from the nature of the play it self: because the Lo^ being often reiterated
and often failing expectation, they think that that power which they imagine
does govern the Lot, is against them.

33. By the same reason also it comes to pass, that they that use those plays
can scarce put an end or measure to them: because they who are inferior in the
contention, have no reason to despair of their Lot, and sodo persist in a
pertinacious expectation of their wished success.

34. Hence also those losses and inconveniences, by which other plays are wont
to be made extrinsecally vicious, in di^ do depend partly upon the veruy
nature of the play.

CHAPTER. XII.
Oftempting of God.

1. TEmpting of God is in a singular manner opposed to hearing the word and
Prayer. Psalm. 95. 7, 8, 9. To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
heart, as in the provocation, as in the day of Tentation in the Wilderness:
where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works. For seeing that in
hearing the word and godly Prayer, we have communion with God, according to
this will, if we seek such like communion beyond his will, then we are
properly said to tempt him.

2. To tempt God is to make trial of foam Divine perfection in an unlawful
manner. Psalm. 95. 9.

3. This trial is sometime of the power of God, Psalm. 78. 18. 19. They tempted
God in their heart -- and speaking against God, they said, Can God prepare a
Table in the Wilderness? namely, when it is circumscribed by men, and bounds
are set to it at their pleasure: at if he shall do this or that, which they
would have him, then let him be accounted omnipotent, otherwise not. Ps. 78.
41. Who tempted God, and limited the holy one of Israel.

4. Sometime trial is made of the Knowledge of God, as when men privily do
something doubting whether God know it or no, Ps. 94. 7. saying, the Lord sees
not, neither does the God of Jacob regard.

5. Sometime it is of the presence of GOD. Exodus 17. 7. They tempted God,
saying, Is the Lord among us or no?

6. Sometime it is of the providence of God, when men leaving ordinary means
appointed by God, do yet expect that God should provide for them, at their
desire, although he promised no such thing. Mat. 4. 7.

7. Sometime it is of the anger, justice and vengeance of God. 1. Cor. 10. 22.
Do we provoke the Lord to anger? which kind of tempting is in all murmuring,
and strife against God o^ those sent by God. 1. Cor. 10. 9. 10. Neither let us
tempt Christ. Neither murmur ye; whence Massah and Meribah were the names of
the same place. Exodus 17. 7.

8. But tempting of God is sometime with an express intention to try God, as
in unlawful casting of Lots, and whenever we presume that of God which he
has not promised.

9. Sometime it is with a secret and implied consent, namely when that is done
which of it self and in its own nature tends to this, that God may be tried,
although he that does it think no such thing.

10. And this is done two ways, First, when one wills and expected any thing
to be done, and in the mean while refuses the means that are necessary for
it: as they do in natural things who would have health or continuance of
life, and reject medicines, or food: as they also in supernatural things which
would have grace and life, but neglect the Word of God, and Sacraments, with
the like means of grace and salvation. Secondly, when one exposes himself to
danger without urgent necessity, from which he can in no wise or scarsly be
delivered, except by a miracle from God: as they do in natural things often
who seek vain glory in contemning death, and those in spiritual things who
seem as it were to love the occasions, and entisements to sin.

11. This sin does often times flow from doubting or unbelief: because he who
seeks such trial of God, does not sufficiently trust the revealed word of
God: but will undertake a new way to know the will of God; and so it is opposed
to hearing the word, so far forth as it is to be received of us by Faith.

12. Sometime it flows from despair, when men not expecting the promises of
God, by a disorderly hastening, will prescribe God, when and how he may satisfy
their expectation: and so it is opposed to the hearing of the word, as it
cherishes divine hope in us.

13. Sometime also it flows from a base esteem and contempt of God: as when
one playing and jesting will try whether God will manifest himself according
to his desire: and so it is opposed to hearing of the word, as it has in it a
love, and fit esteem of God.

14. It flows also from a certain arrogance and pride, whereby we refusing to
subject our wills to the Will of God, do seek to make his will subject to our
lust.

15. But it comes most often from presumption, whereby one is confident that
God will do this, or that which he no where promised, or at least did not
promise that he would do in that manner and with those means that they
expect; whence also it is that every tempting of God is by some referred to
presumption: and in respect of arrogance it is opposed to prayer, wherein we
do humbly represent our will to God, that it may be performed by him as he
pleases.

16. But it is always opposed to some act of religion, whereby we depend upon
the will of God: because when we tempt God, we do it that God may as it were
depend upon our will.

17. To desire some special sign of God, with some special reason,
inspiration, or instinct, is to tempt God, Matthew: 16. 1. The Pharisees and
Sadduc^s tempting him, required him to show them a sign from Heaven.

18. Yet to refuse a sign offered by God, is to tempt or weary him. Is. 7. 11,
12, 13. Ask a sign. I will not ask, neither will I tempt God. Ye weary my
God. Humbly to seek a sign of God about some particular necessary thing,
which otherwise is not sufficiently manifested, a believer may sometime do
without sin. Genesis 15. 8. How shall I know that I shall inherit the Land?

19. Proving or purging of a suspected offense by trial of hot Iron, scalding
water and the like, are temptings of God: for there is a certain miraculous
showing of the power of God expected or required in them to prove an hidden
truth, without just cause: because there are other means appointed to find out
men's faults, which also if they fail, such things may be unknown without any
fault.

20. Of the same kind are single Duells, or monomachies, which of old were
permitted by public authority, and are yet too much frequented: for in them
the righteousness of the cause is committed to be decided by the singular
providence of God from that success which he is thought to give according to
his Justice, without any certain and just reason.

21. Beside these temptings which do properly pertain to trial, there is
also a tempting as it were of inducement, toward God, when there is required,
or expected help from him to commit some heinous wickedness.

20. Yet those inducements may fithly enough be referred to temptation of
trial: because the Will of God is tried in them. They differ from others in
this only, that that object about which the Will of God is tried, is an action
in it self unlawful, in which respect, the honor of God is specially hurt
and violated: because together with the temptation there is joined a certain
most foul mocking of God.

23. Tempting or proving of God is sometime taken in good part, and is
commanded, Mat. 3. 10. Try me now in this, says the Lord of Hosts.

24. But this tempting is an act of Faith, leading us to obey and practice
those things which God has commanded; with expectation of that fruit and
blessing which God has promised.

25. This lawful tempting of God does put back all the tentations of the
Devil.

26. That unlawful tempting of God does lay us open to the tentations of the
Devil, neither are we ever overcome by any tentation of the Devil, unless
we do in a sort tempt God.

CHAPTER XIII.
Of instituted worship.

1. INstituted worship is the means ordained by the Will of God, to exercise
and further natural worship.

2. All such like means ordained of God are declared in the second
Commandment, by forbidding all contrary means of worship devised by men,
under the title of Graven and Image: which seeing they were of old the chief
inventions of men corrupting the worship of God, they are most fitly (by a
Synechdoche frequent in the Decalogue) put instead of all devises of man's wit
pertaining to worship.

3. This worship does not depend In specie, and immediately upon the nature of
God, or upon that honor w^ch by virtue of our Creation we owe to God, but upon
the most free institution of God.

4. Hence this worship was diverse according to the diverse constitution of the
Church; one befo^ Christ exhibited, and another after.

5. It is a means having relation to the natural worship, otherwise it were
not worship, because one cannot give that honor to God which is due to him, as
touching the essence of the act any other way then by Faith, hope, and Love,
whereby we do receive from God with due subjection, those things he propounds
to us to be received, and with the same subjectio^ we offer to him those things
which may be offered by us to his honor. But because the acts themselves are
in a special manner exercised in those things, which God has instituted for
his honor, therefore there is in them a certain secundary worship, and a
certain partaking of the former.

6. But it has in respect to that natural worship the affection of an effect,
which existeth by virtue of the former: and of a means and instrument, whereby
Faith, Hope, and Love, (in which that worship is contained) do exercise their
acts; and of an adjuvant cause whereby they are furthered, and also of an
adjunct to which thy are subjected.

7. But it is properly called worship, as it is a means and helping cause of
that primary worship.

8. But because, the command of God being put, it depends and flows from the
primary worship of God, therefore it is often persuaded, and urged by those
arguments which are taken from the inward and essential manner of worshipping
God, as in the second precept. They that love me, and keep by Commandments.
Deuteronomy. 10. 12, 13. What does the Lord thy God require of thee, but that thou
fear the Lord thy God, walk in all his ways, and that thou love him, and
worship the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul: observing the
precepts of the Lord, and his Statutes.

9. That rule therefore of interpreting the Scriptures which is wont to be
delivered by some is not universally true; that all those duties moral and
immutable, which have moral and immutable reasons joined to them; except it be
thus understood, that those duties do follow upon those reasons, no special
command coming between. Lev. 11. 44. I am the Lord your God, that sanctify
you, that ye may be holy, as I am holy ^t defile not therefore your selves with
any creeping thing.

10. No worship of this kind is lawful, unless it has God for the Author,
and ordainer of it. Deuteronomy. 4. 2. and 12. 32. Keep you all things which I shall
command you, Ad not to the word which command you, neither take from it, every
thing which I command you observe to do: ad not to it, nor take from it every
thing which I command you observe to do: ad not to it, nor take from. 1.
Chron. 16. 13. Our Lord broke in upon us, because we did not seek him aright.

11. That is declared in those words of the Commandment. Thou shall not make
to thy self: that is of thine own brain or judgment, for although that
particle to thyselfe, does sometimes either abound, or has another force: yet
here the most accurate brevity of these Commandments does exclude redundancy,
and it is manifest that the vanity of man's cogitations is excluded by other
places of Scripture pertaining to the same thing. As Amos 5. 26. Which ye made
to your selves. Numb. 15. 39. That ye follow not after your own heart and your
own eyes, which when ye follow; ye go a whoring.

12. The same is also declared by that universality of the prohibition, which
is explained in the Commandment by a distribution of the things which are in
Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Waters under the Earth.

13. For none beside God himself can either understand what will be acceptable
to him: or can ad that virtue to any worship whereby, it may be made effectual
and profitable for us; neither can there be any thing honorable to God, which
comes not from him as the author of it, neither finally do we read that such a
power was at any time given to any man by God, to ordain any worship at his
own pleasure. Matthew 15. 9. In vain do thy worship me, ^eaching for
doctrines the precepts of men.

14. Hence implicitly and by interpretation of God himself, we make him our
God, and give the honor due to God to him, whose authority or ordinances we
subject our selves unto in religious worship.

15. In this respect also men are sometime said to worship the Devil, when
they observe those worships which the Devil brought in. 1. Cor. 10. 20. Levit.
17. 7. Deuteronomy. 32. 17.

16. But we must observe that worship which God has appointed with the same
religion, as we receive his word or will, or call upon his name Deuteronomy. 6. 17,
18. and 12. 25. 28. and 13. 18. and 28. 14.

17. The means which God has ordained in this kind, some of them do
properly, and immediately make to the exercising and furthering of Faith, Hope
and Charity; as public and solemn preaching of the word, celebration of
Baptism, and the Lords Supper, and prayer.

And some of them are means for the right performance of those former, as the
combination of the faithful into certain Congregations or Churches, Election,
Ordination, and Ministration of Ministers ordained by God, together with the
care of Ecclesiastical Discipline.

18. Those former are most properly the instituted worship of God; yet the rest
are also worship, not only in that general respect, as all things are said to
be acts of worship and religion, which do any way flow from, or are guided by
religion; but also in their special nature, because the adequate end and use
of them is, that God may be rightly worshipped.

19. All these therefore both in general, and in special ought to be observed
of us as they are appointed by God; for God must be worshipped by us with his
own worship, totally and solely, nothing must here be added, taken away or
changed. Deuteronomy. 12. 32.

20. That is a very empty distinction, whereby some go about to excuse their
additions. That only addition corrupting, and not addition conserving is
forbidden; because every addition as well as detraction is expressly opposed to
observation, or conservation of the commands of God, as being a corruption.
Deuteronomy. 12. 32.

21. Of like stamp also is that evasion whereby they say there is forbidden
only addition of essentialls, and not of accidentalls: for first although there
be accidents or certain adjuncts of worship, yet there is no worship to be
simply called accidental, because it has in it the very essence of worship.
Secondly, as the least commands of God even to Iotaes and Titles are
religiously to be observed, Mat. 5. 18. 19. So additions which seem very
small, are by the same reason to be rejected. Thirdly, Moses does seal up even
those laws of the place of Divine worship, of the manner, of abstinence from
blood, and the like which must needs be referred to accidental worship if any
such be, with this very caution of not adding, or taking away. Deuteronomy. 12. 32.

22. This observation is in a special manner called obedience, because by it
we do that which seems right in the eyes of the Lord, although some other may
seem righter in our eyes. Deuteronomy. 12. 25. 28.

23. There is opposed unto this instituted worship, as unlawful, that
will worship which is devised by men. Mat. 15. 9. Col. 2. 23.

24. The sin which is committed in will worship, is by a general name called
superstition.

25. Superstition is that whereby undue worship is yielded to God.

26. For in superstition God is always the object, and the end in some
measure, but the worship it self i^ unlawful.

27. It is called undue worship, either in respect of the manner or measure, or
in respect of the matter and substance of the worship. In the former manner the
Pharisees offended about the Sabbath, when they urged the observation of it as
touching the outward rest, above the manner and measure appointed by God. And
they also offended in the latter manner, in observing and urging their own
traditions, Marc. 7. 8.

28. Hence superstition is called an excess of religion, not in respect of the
formal power of religion, because so none can be too religious; but in respect
unto the acts and means of religion.

29. This excess is not only in those positive exercises, which consists in
the use of things, but also in abstinence from the use of some things, as from
meats, which are accounted unclean and unlawful, and the like.

30. Yet every abstinence, even from things lawful, although they be counted
unlawful, is not superstition, to speak properly, unless there be some
special worship and honor intended to God by that abstinence.

31. This indue worship is either properly opposed to that worship, wherein
instituted worship is directly put forth and exercised, that is, in hearing the
word celebration of the Sacraments, and prayer; or to that which respects the
means of it.

32. Unto the hearing of the word is opposed, first, A teaching by images
devised by men. Deuteronomy. 4. 15. 16. Is. 40. 18. and 41. 29. Ierem. 10. 8. 15. Heb.
2. 18. Secondly, a vanting of traditions as they are propounded as rules of
religion, Mat. 7. 8.

33. Religious teaching by Images is condemned, first, because they are not
sanctified by God to that end: secondly, because they can neither represent to
us God himself, nor the perfections of God; thirdly, because they debase the
soul, and turn away the attention from spiritual contemplation of the Will
of God; fourthly, because if they be once admitted into the exercises of
worship, the worship it self by the perverseness of man's wit, at least, in
part, will be transferred to them: as it is declared in those words of the
Commandment. Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them.

34. Of like kind with Images, are all those ceremonies, which are ordained by
men for mystical or religious signification.

35. For such ceremonies have no determinate power to teach, either by any
power put into them by nature, or by divine institution: but they can receive
none by humane institution, because man can effect this neither by commanding,
seeing it is beyond his authority, nor by obtaining, seeing GOD has promised
no such thing to him that asks.

36. Neither can men take to themselves any authority in ordaining such
ceremonies, from that, that it is commanded to all Churches, that all things be
done decently, and in order. 1. Cor. 14. 40. For neither the respect of order
nor decency requires, that some holy things should be newly ordained, but that
those which are ordained by God, be used in that manner, which is agreeable to
their dignity; neither do order and decency pertain to holy things only, but
also to civil duties; for confusion and indecency in both are vices opposite
to that due manner which is required to the attaining the just end and use of
them.

37. To the Sacraments are opposed. 1. Sacrifices properly so called, whether
they be bloody or unbloudy, as the Papists feign of their Mass: for after
Christ exhibited, all old sacrifices are abrogated: neither is there any new
ordinance, because the sacrifice of Christ being once offered we have no need
of other types, then those which pertain to the exhibition and sealing of
Christ bestowed on us, which is sufficiently by Gods ordinance performed in the
Sacraments, (without Sacrifices.)

38. Also the ordination and use of new seals, o^ ceremonies sealing some
grace of God is opposed to the Sacraments: for it belongs to him to seal
grace, to whom it belongs to give it.

39. Unto prayer is opposed that relative use of Images, whereby God is
worshipped at them, or before them, although the worship is not referred to the
Images themselves, as some say, subjectively, but objectively by them to GOD
alone.

40. Superstition of this kind is called idolatry. Exodus 32. 5. Psalm. 106. 20.
Acts 7. 41.

41. If they be idols, which are in themselves worshipped in stead of God, it
is that idolatry which is against the first Commandment; but when the tru^ God
is worshipped at an Image, or in an Image, this i^ idolatry, which is against
the second Commandment.

42. For although in respect of the intention of hi^ that worshippeth, he does
not offend in the primary or highest object, yet from the nature of the thing
i^ self he always offends against the formal worship o^ God, and
interpretatively also a new God is faigne^ for the object, who is delighted
with such worship, an^ religious worship is given also to the Image it self,
although it be not done with that purpose that that worship be lastly bounded
in the Image, but that it be by that directed also to God himself.

43. Hence we must not only shun this idolatry' as well as that absolute
idolatry* which is against the first Commandment: but also the very idols, and
idolothites, or the things that are dedicated to Idols, and all the monuments
properly so called of Idols, 1. John 5. 21. 1. Corinthians 8. 10. and 10. 18.
19. 21. 2. Cor. 12. 6. 26. Numbers 33. 52. Deuteronomy. 12. 2. 3. Exodus 23, 13.

44. Superstition of the second kind is in humane forms of the Church, such as
are Churches that are visibly integrally, and Organically, Oecumenicall,
Provincial, and Diocesan, brought in by men; as also in the Hierarchy
agreeable to them, and orders of religious persons, who are found among the
Papists, and in functions, and censures which are exercised by them.

45. The audaciousnesse of those men is intolerable who either omit the second
Commandment, or teach it ought to be so maimed, that it should be read now
under the New Testament. Thou shall not adore nor worship any likeness, or
Image.

CHAPTER XIIII.
Of the manner of Divine worship.

THE adjuncts of worship especially to be observed are two: The manner which is
contained in the third Commandment, and the time which is commanded in the
fourth Commandment.

4. But these two are so adjuncts of religious worship, as that in a certain
secundary respect they partake the definition and nature of it, because by the
observation of them not only that honor of God, which consists in the natural
and instituted worship of God is furthered; but also a certain special honor
is yielded to him as far forth as they are joined to the other, both by his
command, and by a direct and immediate respect.

3. The manner of worship in general is the lawful use of all those things
which pertain to GOD.

4. But the lawful use consists in this, that all things which pertain to
worship be so handled, as is agreeable to the Majesty of God.

5. For whereas it is forbidden in the third Commandment, Thou shall not take
the name of God i^ vain; by the Name of God all those things are under stood,
whereby God is made known to us, or re veales himself, as men are wont to be
known one t^ another by their names: so that the Name of God co^ taines all
those things which pertain to the worship (...) God, whether natural, or
instituted. Act. 9. 15. That h^ may bear my name among the Gentiles. Deuteronomy. 12.
5^ The place which the Lord shall choose to place his na^ there. Mich. 4. 5. We
will walk in the Name of t^ Lord our God. Mal. 1. 11. 12. My name shall be gr^
among the Gentiles.

6. But seeing to take this Name in vain is either t^ take it rashly, that is
either without any end propou^ ded, or without a just and fit end: or to take
it in vain that is, not in that manner which is required to the j^ end, namely,
the honor of God; there is withal co^ manded that we sanctify the Name of
God, that i^ that we use all holy things in that manner which is s^ table to
their holiness and dignity. Isay 1. 13.

7. That suitable manner is, when those circumsta^ ces are used which the nature
of religious things r^ quires.

8. We define this manner by circumstances; beca^ the essential manner of
virtues, and of the acts of r^ ligion is contained in the virtues and acts
themselv^ and is directly commanded in the same precepts w^ them; but that
accidental manner which is in circumstances, seeing it is in some sort
separable from the acts of Religion, and yet is necessarily required to them,
that they may be acceptable to God, is in a special manner commanded in this
third Commandment.

9. These circumstances are either inward or outward.

10. The inward are either antecedent, or going before; concomitant or
accompanying with; consequent, or following after.

11. The circumstances going before are a desire, and stirring up of the mind,
or preparation in a due meditation of these things which pertain to that holy
thing, which is to be handled. Eccles. 5. 1. 2. Take heed to thy feet when thou
entrest into the House of God: Be not swift with thy mouth, and let not thy
mind hasten to utter a thing before God.

12. But this preparation does most properly pertain to those acts of
religion, which are more solemn: for meditation it self whereby the mind is
stirred up, is an act of Religion, but it does not require another preparation
also before it, for so we should proceed without end: but those acts which are
of their nature less perfect, ought to make way for the more perfect and more
solemn acts.

13. Hence before public and solemn hearing the word and prayer, private
prayer is required, and also before private prayer, if it be solemn, there is
required some meditation also of those things which pertain to our prayers,
whether in respect of God whom we pray unto, or in respect of our selves who
are about to pray, or in respect of the things themselves which are to be asked.

14. The circumstances that are concomitant or that accompany with, are
Reverence, and Devotion.

15. A certain general reverence of God is necessary to all obedience, which
respects the authority of God that does command; but this reverence is proper
to the acts of Religion, which has respect to the holiness of those things
about which we are exercised.

16. This Reverence contains two things. 1. A due estimation of the excellency
of such things. 2. A fear of too much familiarity, namely, whereby such things
might be unworthily handled by us.

17. Devotion also contains two things. 1. A certain singular readiness to
perform all those things which pertain to the worship of God. Psalm. 108. 23.
O God, I will sing with a fixed heart. I will awake right early. 2. A suitable
delight in performing those things. If. 58. 13. If thou shall call the Sabbath
a delight.

18. Hence also a greater care and of another kind must be had in hearing the
Word of God, then in receiving the Edicts of Princes; And in calling upon the
Name of God then in supplications, which we make to men whomsoever.

19. The circumstances that follow after are two. 1. To retain the force and
taste as it were, of that worship in our minds. 2. To obtain with all our
endeavor, the end, and use of it.

20. The outward circumstances are those which pertain to order and decency.
1. Cor. 14. 40. Let all things be done decently and in order.

21. But the general rule of these is, that they be ordered in that manner
which makes most for edification. 1. Cor. 14. 26.

22. Of this nature are the circumstances of place, time, and the like, which
are common adjuncts of religious and civil acts.

23. Therefore although such like circumstances are wont to be called of some
rites, and religious or Ecclesiastical ceremonies: Yet they have nothing in
their nature, which is proper to religion, and therefore religious worship does
not so properly consist in them, however the holiness of religious worship is
in some sort violated by the neglect, and contempt of them: because that common
respect of order and decency which does equally agree to religious, and civil
actions cannot be severed from religious worship, but the dignity and majesty
thereof is in some sort diminished.

24. Such like circumstances therefore which of their own nature are civil or
common, are not particularly commanded in the Scriptures, partly because they
come into men's common sense, and partly because it would not stand with the
dignity and majesty of the Law of God, that such things should be severally
prescribed in it. For by this means many ridiculous things should have been
provided for by a special Law, as for example, that in the Church assembly one
should not place himself in another bosom, spit in another face, or should
not make mouths in holy actions. Yet they are to be accounted as commanded
from God. 1. Because they are commanded in general under the Law of order,
decency and edification. 2. Because most of them do necessarily follow from
those things which are expressly appointed by God. For when God appointed that
the faithful of all sorts, should meet together to celebrate his name and
worship, he did consequently ordain that they should have a fit, and
convenient place wherein they may meet together, and an hour also assigned at
which they may be present together; when also there is a Minister appointed by
God, to teach others publicly, it is withal appointed that he have a seat,
and that situation of his body, which is meet for such an action.

25. Those things therefore which pertain to order and decency, are not so
left to men's will, that they may under the name of that, obtrude what they
please upon the Churches: but they are partly determined by the general
precepts of God, partly by the nature of the things themselves, and partly by
those circumstances which do offer themselves upon occasion.

26. For diverse circumstances of order and decency are such, as though there be
no public institution of them, yet they ought to be observed of every one,
neither can men forbid them without sin.

27. But those constitutions by which many circumstances of this kind are wont
to be determined, about, place, time and the like, are rightly said to be by
the best Divines partly Divine, and partly humane: because they are partly
grounded upon the Will of God, in respect of the chief and primary reason of
them, and they depend partly upon the prudence of men, in respect of particular
observation of those things which are agreeable to the Will of God: yet so that
if there be no error of man in making that determination, that constitution is
to be held as simply Divine. For it is the Will of God, that the Church meet at
that hour of the day, which (all circumstances considered) is most convenient.
If therefore there be no error in observation of the circumstances, that hour
which by their due consideration is assigned for meeting, must be acknowledged
as if it were appointed by God.

28. The special manner of the worship of God must be specially determined, as
the special nature of every religious action does require.

29. Hitherto pertains the right manner of hearing the Word of God, calling
upon his name, receiving the Sacraments, exercising Ecclesiastical D^scipline,
and of performing all those several things, which pertain either to the
natural or instituted worship of God. Ezech. 33. 31. Mat. 13. 19. 1. Cor. 11.
27. 29. Esaias 66. 5.

30. But because in Oaths the manner of swearing is wont to be chiefly
respected, therefore (not without all reason) it is wont to be by many referred
to this place in the third Commandment, although of its own nature it
pertain to the first. Leviticus 19. 12. Mat. 5. 34. 2. Chron. 36. 13.

31. Contrary to this due manner in the general is. 1. That vice which is
called of some Acedia loathing, whereby one loatheth Divine or spiritual
things. 2. Tim. 4. 3. Which is opposed to that desire, whereby we ought to have
an appetite to spiritual things. 1. Pet. 2. 2.

32. 2. That slothfulness whereby one shunnes that cheerfulness and labor
that is required to Divine things. Romans 12. 11. Which is opposed to that
stirring up and heat of mind, whereby Divine things are to be prosecuted. Romans
12. 11. and Psalm. 57, 8, 9.

33. 3. Neglect and contempt of holy things, and the abuse of the same to
filthy sporting, and light matters, all which are opposed to that reverence due
to holy things, Luc. 19. 46.

34. 4. Dullness and wandering of mind in exercises of worship. Heb. 5. 11.
Ezech. 33. 31. And it is opposed to devotion, such as was in Cornelius, Act.
10. 2.

35. 5. Rashness or lightness in using, either the name, or titles of God, or
those things which have some special respect to God. Ier. 23. 34. Luc. 13. 1.
And it is opposed to that prosecuting of a just end, which ought to be present
with reverence in the use, of such things. 1. Cor. 11. 17.

36. 6. Forgetfulness. James 1. 24, 25. Which is opposed to the receiving of
fruit, and abiding of the virtue which ought to follow the acts of religion.

37. 7. Confusion, which is opposed to order and decency. 1. Cor. 14. 33.

CHAPTER XV.
Of the time of worship.

1. THE most solemn time of worship is now the first day of every week which
is called the Lords day, Rev. 1. 10. 1. Cor. 16. 2.

2. And it is called the Lords Day, by the same reason that the holy Supper of
the Eucharist is called the Lords Supper. 1. Cor. 11. 20. Namely because it was
instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ, and it must be referted to the same Lord
in the end and use of it.

3. It is necessary that some time be given for the worship of God, by the
dictate of natural reason: for man must needs have time for all, especially
his outward actions; neither can he conveniently attend Divine worship, unless
for that time he cease from other works.

4. Thus far therefore the time of worship falls upon the same precept with the
worship it self; for as when God created the whole world, he is said also to
have created time together with it; so also when he commanded, and ordained
religious actions, he did also withal command and ordain some time or
necessary circumstance.

5. That some certain day is to be ordained for the more solemn worship of
God, this is also of moral natural right, not unknown to the very heathen,
who had always through all ages their set and solemn feast days.

6. That this solemn day ought to be one at least in a week or in the compass
of seven; this belongs to positive Law, but yet it is altogether of
unchangeable institution: so that in respect of our duty and obligation, it
has the very same force and reason with those that are of moral and natural
right, and so it is rightly said of the Schoolmen, to belong to moral right;
not of nature, but of Discipline.

7. That this institution was not ceremonial, and temporal; it appears
sufficiently by this, that it has nothing proper to the Jews, or to the time
of the ceremonial Law; for none can, or dare deny, but that such determination
might be made, at least for a moral reason and benefit, because although
natural reason does not dictate the very same determination as necessary, yet
it dictates it as convenient, as it does apprehend it to be fit that the
worship of God be frequently exercised, and it cannot but acknowledge this
determination in respect of the frequency of the days to be in this respect
convenient.

8. The same also is manifest by this that from the beginning of the Creation,
when there was no place for ceremonies that had respect to Christ the Redeemer
the seventh day, or one of seven was set apart for the worship of God, Genesis 2.
3.

9. For whereas some do contend, that this was spoken by a prolepsis or
anticipation; or that the seventh day was at that time sanctified in the mind
and purpose of God, not in execution: or that then there was a foundation laid
of that sanctification to come; and not the obligation or Law it self. This
may be refuted by diverse arguments. For 1. This anticipation never came into
any man's mind, who was not before anticipated with prejudice about the
observation of the Lords Day. The Jews of old did never dream of it; whose
received opinion was, that this feast was (...) among all Nations from the
beginning of the World. Philo (...). 14. In the new Testament there is no such
thing taught or declared. The authors themselves of this opinion do grant it
to be probable, that some observation of the seventh day, did begin from the
beginning of the Creation. Suarez de diebus Fest. The best interpreters
(Luther, Calvin, etc.) Whom none will affirm to have offended on that side in
giving too much to the Lords Day, do simply, and heartily acknowledge, that
the seventh day was sanctified from the beginning of the World. 2. There can be
no example given of such like anticipation in all the Scripture: for although
the name of certain places are sometime used, proleptically, especially in the
book of Genesis, yet there is no mention at all of such a prolepticall
Institution, either in that book, or in any other of the whole sacred
Scripture. 3. The words and phrases of the very place evince the contrary. Genesis
2. 2, 3. For the perfection of the Creation is twice joined together with the
sanctification of the seventh day in the very same manner and phrase, as the
Creation both of other Creatures and of man himself, is joined with their
blessing. Genesis 1. 21. 22. 27. 28. 4. Neither the purpose of God, nor a naked
foundation of the thing it self suffices, to ground and uphold such a phrase
of Sanctification and Benediction. For by this reason it might be said, that
God sanctified Water, Bread and Wine for the Sacraments of the New Covenant,
from the time that he gave the promise of breaking the Serpents head by the
seed of the woman. Genesis 3. 15. For then God did purpose to seal that
covenant of grace by such seals, some foundation of which seals also was laid
partly in the promise it self, and partly in the creation of those things
which might actually be used to such sealing. 5. From such a foundation laid in
the first Crea^ion, the Prophet gathers a perpetual rule and Law. Malac. 2.
15. Did he not make one? and why one? To seek a godly seed. So in like manner
may we: did not God rest the seventh day? and why the seventh day? to sanctify
the seventh day to God. 6. Upon this very thing the arguing of the Apostle
seems to be grounded, Hebrews 4. 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. Which is thus. There was a
double rest mentioned in the Old Testament, whereof the godly were made
partakers in this life. One was of the Sabbath, and the other was of the Land
of Canaan: but David Psalm 95. promissing rest, speaks not of the rest of
the Sabbath, because that was from the beginning of the World: nor of the rest
in the Land of Canaan, because that was past, not to be expected. To day
therefore he understands a certain third rest, that is, eternal in Heaven.

10. Neither does it any thing hinder this truth, that it is not recorded in
the History of Genesis, that the observation of the seventh day was solemny
kept by the first Patriarchs. For 1. All and every thing which was observed by
them for a thousand and five hundred years, neither could nor ought to be
particularly declared in so short a History as is that of Gensis. Also after
the Law of the Sabbath delivered by Moses, there is no mention in the book of
Judges and some other Histories, of the observation of it. 2. If this very
thing be granted that the observation of this day was for the most part
neglected, yet this ought no more to make the first institution doubtful, then
Polygamy of the same times can show that the sacred Laws of Wedlock were not
equal in time with the very first marriage. 3. Before the promulgation of the
Law in Mount Sinas, the observation of the Law is propounded and urged, not as
a new thing, but ordained of old. Exodus 16. 24. 30. Which although it may be
affirmed of sacrifices and some other ceremonial observations, yet in the
Sabbath, there seems to be for the reasons before put, a certain respect had
unto the first institution, which was equal in time with man's Creation, which
is also declared in the 30. Verse in that word of the time past, has given
you, etc. 4. Among the very Heathens, there were always those footsteps of
the observation of the seventh day, that it is more then probable, that the
observation of the seventh day was delivered them from those Patriarchs whose
posterity they were. Josephus in his last book against Appion, denies, That
there can be found a nicity either of the Greeks or Barbarians, which had not
taken the resting from labor on the seventh Day, into their own manners.
Clemens Alexandrinus Lib. 5. Stromat. does demonstrate the same thing also:
(...). That not only the Hebrews, but the Greeks also observe the seventh
Day. Eusebius. de praeparatione Euangelica lib. 13. affirms, that not only the
Hebrews, but almost all as well Philosophers as Poets, did know that the
seventh day was more holy. Lampridius in Alexandro Severo, tells that on the
seventh day, when he was in the City, he went up to the Capitol and frequented
the Temples. Neither is it far from this purpose that holy days were wont to
be granted to children in Schools on the seventh day. Lucianus in
Pseudologista, Aulus Gellius. li. 13. cap. 2. And some heathen Doctors, were
wont to dispute only upon the Sabbaths, as Suetonius relates of one Diogenes,
lib. 3. Hesiod. lib. 2. Dierum. (...). Li^s (...).5.The former forgetfulness
or carelessness, and neglect of this day, is easily seen to be reproved by
that same horratory word, which is used in the beginning of the fourth
Commandment. Remember.

11. But the right, and moral perpetual authority of this institution is most
of all declared from this, that it is expressly commanded in the Decalogue; for
this is a most certain rule, and received among all the best Divines; That
moral precepts were thus differenced from ceremonialls and Iudicalls, that all
and only moralls were publicly proclaimed before all the people of Israel
from Mount Sinai, by the voice of God himself, and afterward also written, and
written again as it were by the finger of God himself, and that in Tables of
stone, to declare their perpetual and unchangeable continuance; Christ also
does expressly testify that not one Jot, or tittle of this Law should perish.
Matthew 5. 18.

12. That which is commanded in the fourth Commandment, is not indeed of a
moral nature in the same degree and manner altogether with those things that
are commanded, for the most part in all the other Commandments; because it
belongs to positive right, whence also it is, that whereas the three former
Commandments were propounded negatively, by forbidding those vices unto which
we are prone by the pravity of our nature, this fourth Commandment is first
propounded affirmatively in declaring and commanding that which in this part
pertaines unto our duty, and afterward negatively, by forbidding those things
which are repugnant to this duty; which also is in part the reason of that
admonition which is specially prefixed before this precept, Remember the
Sabbath day, that is, Remember to keep this day, as it is explained, Deuteronomy. 5.
18. Because it may more easily be forgotten, seeing it belongs to positive
right, then many other things which are more natural. Yet this positive right
upon which this ordinance is grounded, is Divine right, and in respect of man
altogether unchangeable.

13. Those who turn this fourth Commandment into allegories of a cessation
from sins, and from the troubles of this life, and such like, and thence do
faigne a fourefold, or a fivefold Sabbath, according to their manner, who play
with Allegories, they attribute nothing at all to this member of the decalogue,
which does not as well, and much more properly agree to many Jewish ceremonies,
which are now wholly abrogated.

14. But those that would have this precept ceremonial (as they would have the
second to be also) besides that they are sufficiently refuted, by those things
which have been spoken before, they contradict the express testimony of
Scripture, which affirms that ten words, or moral precepts are contained in
the decalogue, Exodus 34. 18. Deuteronomy. 4. 13. and 10. 4. Where they leave only
nine, or rather eight.

15. They who would have that only to be moral in this precept, that some
time, or some certain days, should be assigned to Divine worship, do no more
make this ordinance to be moral, then was the building of the Tabernacle and
Temple among the Jews. For by that very thing this was declared to all to be
the perpetual Will of God, that some fit place is always to be appointed for
Church meetings, and public exercises of Divine worship: so that by this
reason, there is no more a moral precept given touching some time of worship,
then there is given touching the place, and so neither that indeed (which only
they leave in the fourth precept.) Thou shall observe Feast-dayes, ought any
more to be put in the Decalogue then this, Thou shall frequent the Temples.

16. Moreover, the yearly Feasts, new Moons, and the like ordinances, which
were merely ceremonial, do contain that general equity also in them, and
do still teach us that some certain and fit days ought to be appointed for
public worship: finally, by this reason God should by this Commandment
command several men, nothing at all: for seeing the institution of days by
this opinion is only commanded immediately, and it is not in the power of
private men to ordain these or those days for public worship, by this,
means nothing at all should be commanded but at their will who are in public
office: neither should any thing be commanded them in special, but only in
general, that they do according to their wisdom in setting apart days to
public worship, so that if it seem good to them to appoint one day of twenty
or thirty to this use, they cannot be reproved of any sin in this respect, as
if they broke this Commandment.

17. If there were ever any thing ceremonial in the Sabbath in respect of the
very observation of the day, that is to be accounted for a thing added to it,
or a constitution coming extrinsecally, beyond the nature of the Sabbath, and
the first institution of it; and so it nothing hinders but the institution of
the seventh day was simply moral: for so there was a ceremonial respect of
some type added to some other Commandments, as in the authority of Fathers,
and the first borne of Families, which pertain to the first Commandment,
there was a certain adumbration of Christ, who is the first begotten among the
Sons of God.

18. Neither yet does it certainly appear in the Scriptures, that there was
any ceremony properly so called, or type, in the observation of the seventh
day: for whereas Heb. 4. 9. there is mention made of a spiritual Sabbatisme,
prefigured before by a type, it is under the respect of a type referred only to
the rest promised in the Land of Cannaan, and by comparison of things like to
the rest of God; but in no sort, or in the least signification is it referred
to the rest commanded in the fourth Commandment, as unto a type or shadow.

19. But whereas in Exodus 31. 13. 17. And Ezech. 20. 20. The Sabbath is called
a sign between God and his people, it cannot thence be made a type or
representation of any future grace: Because 1. A sign does often note the same
that an argument, or instruction, as also the most learned interpreters do
note upon. Exodus 31. It is a sign between me, etc. that is, an instruction.
So our mutual love is a sign that we are the Disciples of Christ. John 13.
35. But it is not a type. 2. The Sabbath in those places is not said to be a
sign of some thing to come, but present, as every visible concomitant adjunct
is a sign of the subject being present. For in the observation of the Sabbath
there is a common, and public profession of that communion which is between
God and us: as therefore all solemn profession is a sign of that thing whereof
it is a profession, so also the Sabbath is in that common respect called a
sign.

20. And this is the most proper reason, why the observation of the Sabbath is
so much urged, and the breaking of it so severely punished in the old
Testament: namely because there was in the Sabbath a common and public
profession of all Religion; for this Commandment as it is a close of the first
Table of the Law, does thus summarily contain the whole worship of God,
whilst it commands a certain day for all the exercises thereof. Esaias 56. 2.

21. There were many ceremonies ordained about the observation of the Sabbath:
but the observation of the Sabbath was no more made ceremonial by them, then
it was judicial or political, because of those judicial Laws, whereby it
was then provided that it should be celebrated most religiously. Exodus 31. 14.

22. That accommodation of the fourth Commandment unto the special state of
the Jews, which was in the observation of the seventh day from the beginning
of the Creation, does no more make the precept it self ceremonial, then the
promise of the Land of Canaan, made to the people of Israel, That thou may
live long in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee, makes the fifth
Commandment ceremonial: or more then that Preface, I am the Lord thy God
which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, makes all the Commandments
ceremonial.

23. It may indeed be granted that a more strict observation of the Sabbath was
commanded in those days, applied to the time of Pedagogy and bondage, which is
not of force in all ages; yet this hinders not, but the observation it self is
plainly moral and common to all ages.

24. Yet there can be nothing brought out of the Scriptures, which was at any
time commanded about the strict observation of the Sabbath to the Jews, which
by the same reason does not partaine to all Christians, except the kindling of
fires, and preparing their ordinary food. Exodus 35. 3. and 16. 14. And those
precepts seem to have been special, and given upon particular occasion; for
there is nothing said about the kindling of fire, but in the building of the
Tabernacle, which God would declare was not so holy a work, but it might and
ought to be intermitted on the Sabbath day. Neither is there any mention of the
preparing of victuals, but when Manna was by a miracle sent from Heaven, which
was also by a miracle preserved on the Sabbath day. And by the History of
Christ it appears very likely that he did approve of preparing victuals, done
by kindling of a fire, upon the Sabbath day. For being invited by the Jews to
a feast which was had on the Sabbath day, he refused not to be present. Luc.
14. 1. etc.

25. Whereas the reason of the Sabbath does sometime seem to be referred to the
delivering of the people of Israel out of the captivity of Egypt, it does not
turn the Sabbath into a ceremony. For 1. All the Commandments are in some
sort referred to the same deliverance, as appears by the Preface of the
decalogue. 2. It does not appear that the Sabbath it self had any singular
relation to this deliverance, but that there is mention made of the
deliverance, out of Egypt, Deuteronomy. 5. 15. For that reason only, that seeing the
Israelites had been servants before in Egypt, they ought the more readily and
willingly grant this time of rest to their servants.

26. Whereas the last day of the week was of old observed; this was anciently
ordained by God from the time of the first Creation, because God did that day
cease from the works of Creation.

27. Whereas the last day of the week is now changed into the first day, this
was not done by humane, but Divine authority. For he only can change the day of
the Sabbath, who is Lord of the Sabbath, that is, Christ. Marc. 12. 8. Whence
also that first day which succeeded, is properly called the Lords Day.

28. If this Lords Day be granted to have been of Apostolical institution, yet
that authority which it is Built upon, is nevertheless divine; because the
Apostles were no less guided by the spirit in holy institutions, then in
propounding the doctrine of the Gospel, either in word or writings.

29. Also seeing this institution was grounded upon no special occasion that
was to continue for a time only, whereby it might be made temporary, it does
necessarily follow, that the mind of the Ordainers was, that the observation
of this day should be of perpetual and unchangeable right.

30. Yet it is more likely that Christ himself was the author of this
institution in his own person. 1. Because Christ was no less faithful in
ordering his whole house, or the Church of God, as touching all things that are
generally necessary and useful then was Moses, Heb. 3. 2. 6. But no Christian
can with any reason deny that the observatio^ of this day is generally
profitable, and in some sort necessary for the Churches of Christ. 2. Because
Christ himself did often appear upon this very day to his Disciples gathered
together in one place after the resurrection, John 20. 19. 26. 3. Because he
powered out the holy Spirit upon them this very day, Acts 2. 4. In the practice
of the Churches in the time of the Apostles when there is mention made of this
observation of the first day, Acts 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 2. It is not remembered as
some late Ordinance, but as a thing a good while received among all the
Disciples of Christ. 5. The Apostles did in all things deliver those things to
the Churches which they had received of Christ, 1. Cor. 11. 23. 6. This
institution could not be deferred not one week after the death of Christ, and
that law of one day in every week to be sanctified according to the
determination of God himself remain firm: which law has been demonstrated
before to be of perpetual right. For the Jewish Sabbath was in respect of the
determination which it had to the seventh day abrogate in the death of Christ:
For whereas it is read that the Apostles sometime after were present in the
assemblies of the Jews that day of the Sabbath, Acts 13. 14. and 16. 13. and
17. 2. and 18. 4. they did that chiefly in that respect, because then was the
fittest occasion to preach the Gospel to the Jews; as also afterward the
Apostle did greatly desire to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, Acts 20.
16. because at that time there was the greatest concourse of the Jews to be in
that place. 7. If the institution of the Lords day was deferred so long, till
the Apostles had made a separation from the Jews, and had their meetings
apart, Acts 18. 6, 7. and 19. 8. as some would have it; then all that space of
time which came between the death of Christ and this separation, which was
above three years, the fourth Commandment had bound none to that observation
of any day: because the Jews day was already abolished, and by this opinion
there was no new brought in the room, and so there were only nine precepts in
force all that time. 8. The reason it self of this change confirms the same,
which is by the consent of all referred to the resurrection of Christ: namely,
because this day the creation of the new world or the world to come, Heb. 2. 5.
in which all things were made new, 2. Cor. 5. 17. was perfected, so that God
did now in Christ rising again from the dead, cease or rest from his greatest
work. As therefore in the beginning of the creation, when God rested from his
works, he then blessed and sanctified that day wherein he did rest: so also it
was meet that that very day wherein Christ did rest from his labors, himself
also should sanctify the same day. Neither is that easily to be rejected which
is urged by some of the Ancients, out of Ps. 118. 24. This is the day which the
Lord has made; for in that very place is treated of Christ's resurrection, as
Christ himself interprets, Mat. 21. 42. 9. It was also most meet that the day
of worship in the New Testament should be ordained by him, by whom the worship
it self was ordained: and from whom all blessing and grace is to be expected
in all worship.

31. They who account the observation of the Lords day for a tradition not
written, they are hereby sufficiently refuted. 1. Because there is no one thing
which depends upon tradition not written of such moment, as is the observation
of the Lords day, by common consent, and the consent of all Christians almost.
2. By this means there is a door opened to bring in diverse superstitions, and
humane devices into the Church of God, or at least to prop them up when they
are brought in. 3. Many among the Papists are ashamed of this invention: for
although all the Papists to cloak their superstitions, are wont to give too
much to Ecclesiastical traditions, yet in the observation of the Lords day
that impression of Divine authority appears that it has compelled not a few
of them, to ascribe it not to any humane, but to Divine right. Bannes in 2. 2.
q. 44. a. 1. Author supplementi adsummam Pisanam verb. Dominica; Abbas in cap.
licet defer. n. 3. Aug. ver. feria. n. 3. Silvester. ver. Dominica q. 1. 7.
Alexander also the third Pope of Rome in the very Canon law, deferiis cap.
licet affirms, that the Scripture as well of the old as new Testament, has
specially deputed the seventh day for man's rest, that is (as Suarez interprets
de dieb. fest. cap. 1.) both Testaments have approved the manner of deputing
every seventh day of the week for the rest of man, which is to depute the
seventh day formally, although materially the same was not always deputed: and
in this manner it is true that that seventh day in the old law was the Sabbath,
and in the new is the Lords day. 4. They among themselves who account the Lords
day among traditions do account baptizing of children also, and that with
greater show in the same place and number. But all our Divines, who have
answered the Papists touching those examples of traditions, do always contend
that those institutions and all other which are of the same profit and
necessity, are to be found in the Scriptures themselves.

32. Those things which are wont to be brought on the contrary out of the
Scriptures, Romans 14. 5. Gal. 4. 10. Col. 2. 16. do nothing at all hinder this
truth. For first, in all those places the observation of some day to religious
use by the ordinance of Christ is no more condemned or denied, then the choice
of some cerraine meat to a religious use by the ordinance of the same Christ:
but no Christian is so void of all reason, that he would conclude out of those
places, that the choice of bread and wine in the Lords Supper for a religious
use, is either unlawful, or not ordained by Christ: neither therefore can any
thing be concluded from them against the observation of the Lords day by the
use and institution of Christ. Secondly, the Apostle Romans 14. does expressly
speak of that estimation of days, which did at that time breed offense among
Christians; but the observation of the Lords day which the Apostle himself
teaches, has at that time taken place in all the Churches, 1. Cor. 16. 1. and
2. could not give any occasion of offense. Thirdly, it is most like that the
Apostle in that place does treat of choosing of days to eat or refuse certain
meats: for the question of that dispute is propounded verse 2. of meats only:
in the 5. and 6. verses, the esteem of a duty is joined with it as pertaining
to the same thing, and afterward through all the rest of the Chapter he treats
only of meats, making no mention of days. Fourthly, in that place to the
Galatians, it is expressly treated of that observation of days, months, and
years, which pertained to the bondage of weak and beggarly elements, Chap. 4.
9. but it was far from the Apostle, and altogether strange to Christian
religion so to account any precept of the Decalogue, or any ordinance of
Christ. Fifthly, in Col. 2. it is specially and expressly treated of those
Sabbaths which were of the same kind with new Moons, and were ceremonial
shadows of things to come in Christ: but the Sabbath commanded in the
Decalogue and our Lords day are altogether of another nature, as has been
before demonstated.

33. Neither is Christian liberty at all diminished by this opinion, (as some
without cause do seem to fear) for it is not a liberty, but a licentiousness
not Christian, if any think themselves freed from the observation of any
precept of the Decalogue, or from the institutions of Christ: and experience
also teaches that licentiousness, and neglect of holy things does more and
more prevail, where a due respect is not had of the Lords day.

34. Neither also was Adam subject to any bondage, because he was tied to
sanctify the seventh day by a special observation.

35. But as the beginning of the old Sabbath was at the evening; because the
Creation also began at the evening, because the common mass was created before
the light, and the cessation of the day from the work of Creation began also at
the evening; so also the beginning of the Lords day does seem to begin from
the morning of that day, because the resurrection of Christ was betimes in the
morning, Mark. 16. 9. John 20. 1.

36. For the right observation of this day two things are necessary, rest, and
the sanctification of this rest.

37. The rest which is required is a cessation from every work which might
hinder the exercises of Divine worship: we must therefore abstain that day. 1.
From all these works which are properly called servile: for seeing such works
were of old by name excluded, in all other solemn feasts, Levit. 23. 7. 8. 25.
32. 36. Numb. 28. 25. much more were they excluded from the Sabbath.

38. But it is ridiculous by servile works to understand sins or mercenary
good works, or done (after the manner of servants) for reward (as some do
understand them by a certain Allegorical sport:) for sins are not forbidden
and unlawful at some certain times, but always and every where: neither does
it pertain to the fourth Commandment to deal with all sins to be forbidden;
although this may in some sense be granted that diverse sins do take some
aggravation from thence if they be committed upon so holy a day, Isay 28. 4.
those evil works also which are done upon fear or hope, that is altogether
servile, have in respect of their manner the same nature with other sins.

39. But servile works are properly those, to the performance whereof servants
or servile men are wont to be used, such as are mechanic works, and all those
to the performance whereof great labor of the body is required, as to plough,
to dig, etc. 2. Besides th^se works there are forbidden also upon that day all
works that are ours: as is gathered from the opposite concession which is
given in the fourth precept, S^ days shall thou work and do all thy work.

40. Whence we may gather with the words following, on the Sabbath day thou
shall do no work: that all those works are forbidden which are properly
called ours, although they be not to speak strictly, servile, or mechanical.

41. Now those are our works which pertain to the uses of this life, that is,
which are exercised in natural and civil things, and do properly pertain to
our gain and profit: of which kind are those which of their own nature are
not servile but liberal, as studyings, exercises of liberal arts; much more
those which are common to free men and servants, as to Jorney, to handle civil
causes, etc.

42. For so this phrase is explained, Esaias 58. 3. Ye do that which delights
you, that ye may exact all your labors, that is, ye do carefully your own
matters, Verse 13. doing thine own ways. But because Esayas in that Chapter
does also and chiefly treat of wicked actions, and those works which are
unlawful at all times, as appears verse 6. Therefore some godly Divines do
seem to err, who are wont to gather out of that place, that every word or
thought that is humane, or pertaines to men, used on the Lords day, is to be
accounted sin: for all humane words, deeds, or thoughts upon that day whereof
that Chapter handles, (whether it be the Sabbath properly called, or a solemn
feast) are not there judged to be impertinent, and in that respect simply
reprehended; but those only which are wont to concern our gain, either simply
unlawful or repugnant to holy exercises, as appears verse 3. and 6.
Concerning such servile and vulgar works there is such a strict law, that upon
the Sabbath day men may not go on in their work, no not in time of plowing and
harvest simply; that is, at those times which are most opportune and as it were
necessary for man's life, Exodus 34. 21. Nor in those things which do mediately
and remotely pertain to holy things, as was the building of the Tabernacle,
Exodus 31. 13. Much less is it lawful to enter into any ordinary journey,
Exodus 16. or to frequent Marts or Faires, Nehem. 13.

43. Yet here are excepted; 1. All those works which belong to common honesty:
for seeing at all other times we ought, so especially upon that day which is
specially dedicated to Divine worship, to be have and carry our selves
decently: all those things which do simply partaine thereunto are understood
to be permitted. 2. Those things which are imposed on us by some singular
necessity, Mat. 12. 11. In which number notwithstanding those things are not to
be accounted, which men make or feign to themselves as necessary: but those
things which it appears to be necessary and unavoidable, by the providence of
God, and which we are not aware of, that is, when such a necessity urges as
the Scripture it self allows as a sufficient cause to do any ordinary thing.
3. All those works which do directly respect the worship and glory of God, Mat.
12. 5. John 5. 8, 9. For in that case those works which are of their own
nature servile, do pass into the nature of holy actions, neither are they
properly our works, but Gods works.

44. This rest, although in it self absolutely considered, it is not, neither
ever was a part of worship; yet as it is commanded of God as a certain
necessary thing unto his worship, and is referred also to it, so far it is a
part of that obedience which pertaines to religion and the worship of God.

45. The sanctification of this rest and day is a special applying of our
selves to worship God, upon that day which is intimated in those phrases, He
sanctified that day, and it is a Sabbath to the Lord thy God.

46. Here public worship ought chiefly to be respected, whence also it is that
the Sabbath is called an holy Convocation, Levit. 23. 13. Acts 13. 14. and 15.
23. and 16. 13. But that that public convocation of the Church ought to be had
both before and after noone upon the Lords day, it appears sufficiently, by
that double burnt-offering of the Sabbath, in the morning and the evening, Number.
28. 9.

47. But the rest of the day ought to be spent in exercises of piety: for
although there was of old an offering peculiar to the Sabbath, yet the
continual or daily offering with his drink offering was not to be omitted,
Number. 28. 10.

48. Also the public worship it self seeing it is most solemnly to be
celebrated, does necessarily require these exercises of reading the Scripture,
meditation, prayer, holy conferences and contemplation of the works of God:
whereby we may be both more prepared to public worship, and that worship may
be made truly effectual to us.

49. Contrary to his ordinance of the Lords day are all feast days, ordained
by men, they being accounted for holy days, as the Lords day ought to be
accounted.

50. For it is most agreeable with the first institution, and with the writings
of the Apostles, that one only day in the week be sanctified.

51. The Jews had no feast days rightly sanctified, but by divine institution.

52. Yet any days may be piously turned into occasion of furthering the
worship of God.

53. Also when God by his special judgments calls to more solemn fasting,
those days are to be accounted as it were for extraordinary Sabbaths:

54. Contrary also to the observation of this day and all transactions of
business, exercises, feastings, sports, and such like, whereby the mind of
man is this day drawn away from the exercises of religion.

CHAPTER XVI.
Of Justice and Charity toward our neighbor.

Thus much of Religion: Justice follows, which is contained in the Second
Table.

1. Justice is a virtue whereby we are inclined to perform our duty due to our
neighbor. So the duty of children toward their parents is said to be just,
Ephesians. 6. 1. And the duty of masters toward their servants is called right and
equal, Col. 4. 1. And all those things which we owe to our neighbor, are
performed in living justly.

2. But justice in this place is not taken most generally, as setting forth
every duty to another: for so it contains even religion it self: for that
justice which i^ said to be general, is no other thing then virtue in
general; as has been before declared; when we did show that justice was the
chief among the general affections of virtue: neither must it be understood
most particularly to respect the quantity either of the thing deserved or
received, for so it contains only a few duties of the second table, namely
those whereby like is returned for like: but it is here used in a certain
middle way, whereby it sets forth the mutual duty between those who are bound
by the same right; in which sense it contains all the force of the second
Table.

3. It has for the object our neighbor, that is, every one whether man or
Angel also, who is or may be with us pertaker of the same end and
blessedness, Luke 10. 36, 37.

4. Hence neither holy men, whatsoever they shall be, nor Angels themselves can
be a fit object of religion, or of that religious worship which is commanded in
the first Table, but only of Justice or of that duty that is due to our
neighbor which is contained in the second Table: whence also those arguments
taken from the nature of the thing, do exclude all adoration of the Creatures.
Acts 10. 26. Rise, for I my self also am a man: Revel. 22. 9. See thou do it
nor, for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of
those that keep the words of this Book, worship God. Rev. 22. 9.

5. Buth in this number and name, every one is by proportion included even in
respect of himself; for every one is first a neighbor to himself, then to
others. Whence also it is that there is no singular precept given whereby a man
may be ordered toward himself: for whilst he is rightly ordered toward God,
and toward his neighbor, he is also ordered toward himself; but with this
difference, that that disposition whereby any is made fit to perform his duty
to God and his neighbor, pertaines to his perfection; but he must also
perform the same duties both to his neighbor and himself, (but not to God,
and himself.)

6. But because that monner whereby duties are to be exercised toward our
neighbor, is with respect and affection to their good; hence this same virtue
is called charity toward our neighbor. Matt. 22. 29. Marc. 12. 31.

7. In this charity there is always love of union, of welpleasednesse and good
will, as in that love which is toward God; but there is also added often times
the consideration of mercy, when the misery of our neighbor is respected,
which has no place in our charity toward God.

8. But this band of Justice and affection of Charity ought always to flow,
and be derived from Religion toward God; for seeing Religion gives the chief
honor to God, it causes that obedience be given to his will in those things
also which do immediately respect the Creatures; whence all they who neglect
their duty toward men, are denied to honor God, but rather do contemn him.
1. Sam. 2. 30. Also charity toward God which is contained in Religion, does of
its own nature produce charity toward men, as they are in some sort partakers
of the Image of God: whence also we are said to love God in men, and men in
God, which is one reason of that phrase, beloved in the Lord.

9. Hence nothing is properly due to man which is contrary to Religion. Acts 4.
19. and 5. 29. Whether it be right in the sight of God to obey you rather then
God, judge ye: we must obey God rather then men.

10. Hence also the truth of Religion cannot consist with the neglect of
Justice, and Charity toward our neighbor. James 1. 27. Religious worship, pure
and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless, and
widows in affliction. 1. John 4. 20. 21. If any one say I love God, and hate
his bzother, he is a liar. This Commandment have we from God, that he that
loves God, love his brother also.

11. Hence finally religion is best proved, and tried by Justice, according to
the frequent use of the Scripture, which argument notwithstanding does serve
much more certainly for negation, then affirmation, if it be understood of the
outward works and offices of Justice: because such works of Justice may be
sometime present, where true religion is wanting; but if true religion be
present, they cannot be wholly absent.

12. By the same reason also unjust works do more argue a man to be ungodly,
then those which are just do argue a godly man: whence the works of the flesh
are said to be manifest. Gal. 5. 19. Which is not affirmed of the fruits of the
spirit, Verse 12.

13. The order of this charity is this, that God is first and chiefly to be
loved by charity, and so is as it were the formal reason of this charity
toward our neighbor: next after God we are bound to love our selves, namely
with that charity which respects true blessedness; for loving God himself
with love of union, we love our selves immediately with that chief charity
which respects our spiritual blessedness: but we ought to love others whom we
would have partakers of the same good with us, secondarily as it were; moreover
others may be deprived of this blessedness without our fault, but we our
selves cannot; therefore we are more bound to will and seek it for our selves
then for others.

14. Hence it is that the love of our selves has the force of a rule or
measure unto the love of others: Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self.

15. Hence it is never lawful to commit any sin for another sake, although
our offense may seem small, and to be a chief good, which we should seek to
another: for he that wittingly and willingly sins hates his own soul.
Prove. 8. 36. and 29. 24. He that sins against me, offers violence to his
own soul. He that partaketh with a thief, hates himself, and he that
hearing cursing declares it not.

16. Among other men none indeed ought wholly to be removed from the embracing
of our charity, who is capable of blessedness; for if we love God above all
things, no enmities will so far prevail with us, but we may love our very
enemies for God. Mat. 5. 39. Romans 12. 17. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 15. 1. Pet. 3. 9.

17. But among men those are more to be loved then others, that come nearer to
God, and in God to our selves. Galatians 6. 10. Let us do good to all, but
especially to the household of Faith.

18. But because they that believe, are more near both to God, and to us also
spiritually, then those who do not as yet believe, therefore also are they
more to be beloved.

19. Yet this is so to be understood, that it be referred to the time present
and the immediate affection; for we may will the same good to some other as much
or more in time to come, the grace of God and faith coming between; in which
sense that affection of the Apostle concerning the Israelites is to be taken.
Romans 9. 3.

20. If among those that are to be beloved there be no apparent disparity
neither in respect of God, nor in respect of us, then they are equally to be
beloved.

21. But if any apparent disparity appear, either in their neerenesse to God
or to our selves, then he who exceeds in any neerenesse, is more to be beloved,
that is, when we cannot exercise the act of our love alike toward all, we are
more bound to place our love on those whom God has by some special neerenesse
or communion commended to us, then on others. Therefore although we ought
equally to will the salvation of others; yet the exercise and care of this will
is chiefly due to those, that are near joined to us in some special respect;
as a Soldier although he ought to wish well to all his fellow Soldiers, yet
he is bound to take most care of those who are of the same band, and are next
ad^oyned in the same Rank. This appears in that example of Paul, who did more
servently desire the conversion of the Israelites then of other Nations; of
which affection he gives this one reason, because they were his brethren, and
and kindred according to the flesh. Romans 9. 3.

22. Yet in this prerogative of charity we must wish to those that are near
unto us, rather those good things which pertain to that conjunction, whereby
they come near unto us, as spiritual good things to those who are most
spiritually joined to us, and natural good things to those with whom we have a
natural neerenesse; not that those kind of good things are in our desires to
be separated one from another, but because the very kind of conjunction, is as
it were a bek from God whereby he stirs us up to bestow our pains chiefly in
this or that kind.

23. Hence it follows, first. That kindred in blood, Caeteris paribus other
things answerable, are more to be beloved then strangers, in those things which
pertain to the good things of this life: and among those that are near in
blood, those that are the nearest to be most loved.

24. Secondly, that some special friend is more to be beloved, then an
ordinary kinsman in blood, at least in those things, which pertain to the
common duties of this life, because friendship may be such that it may make a
nearer conjunction then consanguinity it self considered by it self. Prove.
18. 24. For a friend is nearer then a brother.

25. Thirdly, that parents are to be loved more then any friend, because the
neernesse of parents is greater then of friends as touching the communicating
of those things which are most intimate to us. 1. Tim. 5. 4. If any widow have
children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety toward their own
house, and to recompense their parents: for this is honest and acceptable in
the sight of God.

26. Fourthly, that parents are more to be beloved then children, in those good
things which ought to redound from the effect to the cause, as Honor, Esteem,
Reverence, Thankfulness and the like. But that children are more to be loved
then parents in those things which are derived from the cause to the effect; of
which kind are, Maintenance, Promotion, Providence and the like.

27. Fifthly, that husb^s and wifes are to be loved more then parents or
children, in those things which pertain to society and union of this life; for
that is the greatest neerenesse, whereof it is said, they shall be one flesh.
Genesis 2. 24. Matthew 19. 5. Therefore shall a man leave his Father, and Mother,
and shall cleave to his Wife, and they shall be one flesh.

28. Sixthly, that they that have deserved well of us are more to be beloved
then others, and among thosesuch as have communicated spiritual good things to
us are most to be beloved: let him that is taught in the word communicate to
him that taught him, all good things, Gal. 6. 6.

29. Seventhly, that a community or whole society is more to be beloved then
any nember of it, because the conjunction of a part with the whole is greater
then with another part; and therefore, that a prince whose life and safety is
necessary or most profitable for the common good, is more to be beloved, then
any or diverse of the common people, nay more then our selves in temporal
things. 2. Sam. 21. 17. Thou shall go no more with us to battle, least thou
quench the light of Israel. Lament 4. 20.

30. There be two Acts of charity toward our neighbor: Prayer for his good,
and working of it. Mat. 5. 44. Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which hurt you and persecute
you.

31. This Prayer as it respects the honor of God, pertaines to religion in the
first Table: but as it respects the good of our neighbor, it pertaines to
Justice, and Charity toward our neighbor in the second Table.

32. We must pray for all those good things, which religion commands us to wish
to him, whether they be spiritual, or corporal.

33. In this praying is included not only petition, but also giving of thanks,
whereby we praise God for the good things which he has bestowed on our
neighbors. Romans 1. 8, 9, 10.

34. To his praying is opposed that imprecation which tends to the hurt of our
neighbor, which is called cursing. Mat. 5. 44.

35. Working of good toward our neighbor is an endeavor, concerning him,
tending to his good; whence also it is called good deed. Matthew 5. 44. And
love in deed. 1. John 3. 18.

36. This working is distinguished from praying; because although prayer be
also an endeavor tending to the good of our neighbor, yet is not immediately
exercised about our neighbor, but is directed unto God.

37. Yet unto this working those endeavors must be referred which are
exercised about other Creatures for our neighbors sake: for then there is an
efficiency in our actions of the same reason, as if it were exercised
immediately about our neighbor himself.

38. Now this endeavor is either, by moral persuading, or real effecting.

39. An endeavor of moral persuasion is in propounding of good to be
performed with arguments by which he may be stirred up to it.

40. And this is by admonition, and good example.

41. This admonition is taken generally for any warning, which is used by
words, whether it be to procure and perform good to our neighbors, or to
drive away and make up any hurt.

42. Therefore it contains in it our duty to teach and admonish. Colos. 3. 16.
To observe others that we may whet them to love and good works. Heb. 10. 24.
To exhort them also daily. Heb. 3. 13. To comfort them against sorrow and
grief. 1 Thessalonians 4. 18. And to correct them in a brotherly manner, if they be
overtaken with some offense. Gal. 6. 1. Rev. 19. 17.

43. But this brotherly correction is then to be used; when we certainly know
that the evil to be corrected is committed, when there is hope of some fruit,
or good to follow upon our correction, either by the amendment of our brother
that is fallen, or by preserving of others from partaking of the same; lastly,
when there is fit opportunity in respect of time, or person, and the
circumstances.

44. Unto this admonition is opposed consent, or communion with others in their
sins. Ephesians. 5. 7. 11.

45. One is said to be partaker of another sin nine ways; which are thus set
down in Latin. Iussio, consilium, consensus, palpo, recursus,
Participans, nutans, non obstans, non manifestans.


That is summarily, consent is given to sinners, by counselling, defending,
helping, permitting when we can hinder, and by holding our peace when we may
profitable speak. Romans 1. 32.

46. Good example is a representation of a good work, whereby others may be
stirred up to perform the like. 1. Tim. 4. 12. Tit. 2. 4. 7. Mat. 5. 16. 1.
Pet. 2. 12.

47. To good example scandal is opposed. 1. Cor. 10. 32. 33. Give no offense
to the Jews, to the Gentiles, nor the Church of God.

48. A scandal is a representation of an evil work whereby others may either
be stirred up to sin (whence it is called (...), or a cause of stumbling) or to
be hindered or slackned from doing good, (whence it is called (...) or a cause
of weakening) and that is properly called a scandal, 1. Cor. 8, 9, 10. Take
heed that your lyberty be not an occasion of stumbling to the weak, etc. Romans
14. 21. Wherein thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

49. There is in every evil work which is made known to others, the respect
of a scandal. Mat. 18. 6, 7, 8. Whosoever shall be an offense. If thy hand,
foot, eye cause thee to offend. If thy brother sin against thee.

50. There is also sometime a scandal in a work of it self lawful, if it be
not expedient in respect of others. 1. Cor. 8. 13. If my meat offend my
brother, I will never eat flesh, least I offend my brother.

51. But an indifferent thing is said to be expedient, or not expedient, when
all circumstances considered, it makes, or makes not to the glory of God, and
edification of our neighbor.

52. There is no humane authority that can make that action lawful, whereby a
scandal is given to our neighbor.

53. But then a scandal is said to be given: either when some manifest sin is
committed, or at least that which has evident show of sin is committed, so
that it becomes known to others; or when that is rashly committed which is not
necessary by Gods Command, and yet brings spiritual hurt to others: but much
more if the perverting or troubling of our neighbor be by that very action
directly intended.

54. But if there follow offense, not from the condition of our work, but from
the pure malice of others, then it is called an offense taken, as that of the
Pharis^es, which is not our sin, but of those who are offend^d. Mat: 15. 12,
13, 14. Know thou not that the Pharisees were offended at that saying? Let
them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind.

55. But although this offense taken cannot be avoided by us; yet an offense
given may and ought. For God never lays upon his a necessity of offending.

56. That scandal whereby one is said (metaphorically) to offend himself, or
to give occasion of sinning to himself, is by proportion referred to an
offense given.

57. A real effecting or procuring the good of our neighbor, is when we our
selves perform something which of it self tends to the good of our neighbor
without his help coming between. Heb. 13. 16. To do good, and to distribute
forget not.

58. But although all acts of Justice ought to have charity joined to it, yet
there are some wherein Justice does more shine forth, and others wherein
charity does more rule.

59. Hence that distinction arises whereby some offices are said to belong to
Justice strictly taken, and some belonging to charity; of which difference and
formal distribution we have Christ the author. Luke 11. 42. Ye pass by
judgment and the love of God.

60. Those are the acts of Justice which have in them the confideration of a
debt and equality in respect of others.

61. Those are the acts of charity whereby the good of another is respected
more then our debt.

62. The offices of Justice, are before, and of straighter obligation then they
which are of charity.

63. Hence we are more bound to pay our debts, then to give any thing of our
own; and he that offends another, is more bound to seek reconciliation then he
that is offended.

64. There is in many things a double respect of Justice, one whereof respects
the next end, and words of the Law, that binds, which is called Justice in
the most strict sense; and the other, respects the remote end and reason of the
Law which is called equity or (...).

65. The parts of this Justice are two, one whereof gives to every one his own,
and it is called distributive Justice, the other restores to every one his own,
and it may be called emendative Justice.

66. Distributive Justice cannot be rightly performed without a right judging
of things and persons, and a meet comparison of things to things, and persons
to persons, from whence arises that proportion which they call geometrical.

67. Unto distributive Justice is opposed acception of persons, whereby one is
preferred before another in the distribution of good due, without just cause.

68. Emendative Justice is either Commutative, or Corrective.

69. Commutative Justice is equality of the thing given, and received.

70. Corrective Justice, presupposes some Injustice, and it is either civil
or criminal.

71. Civil does chiefly correct the injustice of the cause.

72. Criminal does chiefly correct the injustice of the person.

73. To corrective Justice pertains revenge, and restitution.

74. Revenge is an act of corrective Justice, whereby punishment is inflicted
on him, who has violated Justice.

75. The end hereof ought to be the amendment or restraint of the offender,
quietness and admonition to others, and so the preserving of Justice, and of
the honor of God. Deuteronomy. 13. 11. and 17. 13. and 19. 20. and 21. 21. That all
Israel may hear, and fear, and do no such iniquity in the midst of thee.

76. Restitution is an act of corrective Justice, whereby another is set again
into the possession of that thing of his own whereof he was unjustly deprived.

77. Hence an action binding to restitution must be against Justice strictly
taken, and not against charity only.

78. To this injustice injury is opposed.

79. To charity is evil will opposed, whether it be formal by a direct
intention or virtuall by interpretation.

80. Unto this ill will partaines unjust discord, which if it break forth into
separation, especially in those things which pertain to religion, it is
properly called Schism.

CHAPTER XVII.
Of the honor of our Neighbor.

1. Justice toward our Neighbor does either immediately affect him or by means
of some action.

2. Justice which does immediately affect our Neighbor, does either respect the
degree of that condition in which our Neighbor is placed, or the condition it
self absolutely considered.

3. As if respects the degree of it, it is called honor which is commanded in
the fifth Commandment: which is said to be the first Commandment with promise,
Ephesians. 6. 2. Either because it is the first of the second Table, or because it is
the first Commandment in all the Law that has a singular and proper promise
joined to it.

4. Here society of men among themselves is supposed and established, private
or oeconomick, and public or politic, wherein one ought to serve another
being joined together in mutual duties of Justice and charity, that they may
exercise and show toward men that religion whereby they worship God.

5. Hence that solitary life which certain Hermites have chosen to themselves
as Angelical, and others embrace for other causes, is so far from
perfection, that unless it be persuaded by some extraordinary reason (and that
for a time only) it is altogether contrary to the law and will of God.

6. But because humane society is as a foundation to all other offices of
Justice and charity which are commanded in the second table of the law:
therefore those transgressions which do directly make to the disturbance,
confusion and overthrow of this society, are more grievous sins, then the
breaches of the several precepts.

7. But although political society be established of God as well as
Oeco^omicall, yet as there is some certain form of this Oeconomicall (as also
of Ecclesiastical society) prescribed to all people, it is not so of
political; but it is left to their liberty, that (so as they preserve their
power whole) they may ordain that society, which makes most for the
establishing of religion and justice among themselves.

8. And this is one reason why there is mention only of parents in the fifth
precept; because Oeconomicall society only (which is plainly natural) should
remain one and the same throughout all ages, and nations: unto which that also
is added, that this is the first degree, wherein is the fountain and seminary
of all society; whence also the authority of all others in superior power is
set forth and mitigated by the name of Father, 2. Kings 2. 12. and 13. and 13,
14. Genesis 41. 8. 43. 1. Sam. 24. 12. 1. Tim. 5. 1.

9. Honor is an acknowledgement of that dignity or excellency which is in
another with a due testification of it.

10. It is called both an acknowledgement and testifying, because it consists
neither in outward observance only, nor in inward only, but in both.

11. It is said to respect excellency or dignity, because we are not affected
with reverence, but upon the apprehension of some excellency.

12. Hence that duty which is due to those who are placed above us in some
eminency, is commonly and most properly set forth under the name of reverence:
but by a synecdoche it sets forth every duty wherein the degree of dignity or
excellency of another is respected, whether that degree be inequall in respect
of us, or equal, Romans 12. 10. In honor preferring one another, 1. Pet. 3. 7.
Let men likewise dwell according to the knowledge of God, giving honor to the
woman as to the weaker vessel; according that 1. Pet. 2. 17. Honor all men.

13. But it has the first place among those duties which are due to our
neighbor; First, because it comes nearest to the nature of religion and piety
wherewith we worship God, whence also it is called religion or piety, not only
by profane authors, but sometime also in the Scriptures, 1. Tim. 5. 4. Let him
learn first to show piety to his own family, etc. Secondly, because it is the
bond and foundation of all other justice, which is to be performed to our
neighbor: for by virtue of this duty of those degrees which it does respect,
men lead a quiet and peaceable life with all piety and honesty, 1. Tim. 2. 2.
which does also seem to be the proper reason of that promise which is adjoined
to this fifth precept, that thou may prolong thy days upon earth, because
without this mutual observance of superiors and inferiors among themselves,
it could not be expected that the life of man should abide in its state.

14. Honor, as it respects the knowledge and opinion of others of him that is
to be honored, is called fame, Eccles. 7. 1. or a good name, Phil. 4. 8.

15. Hence honor as it is the external good of a man, does not really differ
from fame, but only in reason.

16. That office of honoring which we owe to all, is to preserve that state of
dignity which they have, without being hurt.

17. Unto this office those vices are opposed whereby the fame. of our
neighbor is hurt.

18. The good name of our neighbor is hurt when that estimation which ought to
be had of him is diminished, 1. Cor. 4. 13. Being defamed we pray. 2. Cor. 6.
8. By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report.

19. We may diminish it either with our selves conceiving ill of him without
just cause, which is called rash judgment, Mat. 7. 1. 1. Cor. 4. 3. or with
others also.

20. The good name of our neighbor is diminished with others, by words, deeds,
gestures, or other signs.

21. This also is done sometime directly and formally, with an intention to
hurt, and sometime virtually and indirectly, or of the nature of the thing, or
by circumstances adjoined.

22. When the fame of another is hurt by imputation of an evil of the fault or
of punishment, if it be in his presence, it is called either a reproach, or
derision, or a slander; if it be in his absence, it is called detraction.

23. Detraction is directly exercised about the evil of our neighbor four
ways. 1. When a fault is falsely laid upon him. 2. When a secret fault is
discovered without a just cause. 3. When a true crime is too much beaten upon.
4. When the deed is not disallowed, but the intention is blamed.

24. It is indirectly exercised about the good of our neighbor four ways
also. 1. Denying that good which is to be given to our neighbor. 2. Hiding it.
3. Lessening it. 4. By praising it coldly.

25. The former ways are contained in his verse, Imponens, augens,
manifestans, in mala vertens.


26. The latter in this verse, Qui negat aut minuit, tacuit, lau dat que
remiss.


27. The good name of our neighbor is restored by retracting, or desiring
pardon, or sometime also by recompensing of it.

28. The duties of h^our, belong some to unequals, some to equals.

29. Among unequals, it belongs to superiors to excel in well deserving, but
to inferiors to reverence and give thanks.

30. Inequality is either in some simple quality, or in authority and power.

31. Inequality in a simple quality, is either in respect of age, or in respect
of gifts.

32. They that are above others in age, ought to go before them in grave
example, Tit. 2. 4. That old women teach the younger women to be sober.

33. They that excel in gifts, ought readily to impart the same to the profit
of others, Romans 1. 14. I am a debtor both to the Grecians and Barbarians; to
the wise, and the unwise.

34. They that are above others in power, are those who have right to govern
others, whence also power is wont to be called jurisdiction; whose duty it is
to administer justice and charity toward others in a certain eminent way,
according to that power which they have committed to them, Job 29. 14. 1^. I
put on justice, and my judgment covered me as a robe, and as a Diadem. I was
as eyes to the blind, and as feet to the lame, Col. 4. 1. Masters, do that
which is right and equal to your servants.

35. This justice is administered in charity, by protecting and ruling.

36. Protection is an application of power to defend others from evil, Isay
32. 2. And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from
the tempest, etc. Whereunto also pertaines that providence whereby they provide
necessary things for them, 1. Tim. 5. 8.

37. Ruling is an application of power to further others in good, Romans 13. 4.
He is the minister of God for thy good. 1. Tim. 2. 2. That we may lead a
peaceable and quiet life in all godliness and honesty.

38. This ruling is exercised in directing and rewarding.

39. Direction is a propounding of that which is right and good, that it may be
observed, Ephesians. 6. 4. Fathers, bring up your children in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord.

40. Unto this direction pertaines the making and promulgating of good laws in
whatsoever society of men it be.

41. Rewarding is a recompencing of that obedience which is performed or denied
to direction, 1. Pet. 2. 14. both to take vengeance on the wicked, and for the
praise of them that do well. So Romans 13.

42. Here distributive and emendative justice does most shine forth: for
although the justice in other men is the same, with that which is exercised in
those superior, yet it does most shine forth if it be administered with a fit
power.

43. Hence the right of revenging does not properly belong to others then those
that have super-eminent power, Romans 13. 4. 1. Pet. 2. 14. by whom when it is
rightly exercised, it is not the revenge of men, but of God, 2. Chro. 19. 6.
Take heed what you do for ye judge not for men, but for the Lord, who will be
with you in the judgment.

44. They that are in higher power, ought to provide for the commodities of
them over whom they are set in respect of their souls, that they may have
means of salvation, Ephesians. 6. 4. In respect of their bodies, that they may
have food, raiment, and fit dwelling.

45. And these are either private persons or public.

46. Private, are the husband in respect of the wife, parents in respect of
children, and master in respect of servants: where the power of the husband is
moderated with a certain equality: the power of the master is merely
commanding: but the paternall power is as it were mixed.

47. They that are in public authority, are either ministers or magistrates.

48. But there is this difference between magistrates and ministers of the
Church. 1. Magistracy, (of this rather then of the other kind) is an ordinance
from man: but the ordinance of ministers is from God, which is declared in the
Scriptures, when the power of magistracy although it be ordained by God, Romans
13. 1. yet it is called an humane creature, 1. Pet. 2. 13. which name does not
at all agree to the lawful ministers of the Church. 2. Magistracy is an
ordinance of God the Creator, and so belongs to all kind of men: but the
Ecclesiastical ministry is a gift and ordinance of Christ the Mediator, and
so does not properly and ordinarily perraine, but only to those who are of the
Church of Christ. 3. A magistrate has jurisdiction joined to his government,
and so (if he be the supreme magistrate) upon just cause he may make and
abolish laws, and commit jurisdiction to others: but th ministers of the
Church (considered in themselves) are merely mandatory, that have nothing of
their own, but whatsoever they do lawfully, they do it as in Christ's stead who
commands them, and so can neither make laws, nor commit that power which they
have received to others. 4. It belongs to magistrates to procure the common
good both spiritual and corporal of all those who are committed to their
jurisdiction, by politic means, and a coercive power, 1. Tim. 2. 2. but it is
ministers duties to procure their spiritual good who are committed to them by
Ecclesiastical means, Acts 20. 28. Heb. 13. 17.

49. But they cannot be exactly distinguished, in the things themselves, the
persons and causes, about which they are occupied: for there is nothing,
person, or cause so Ecclesiastical, but in some respect it may pertain to the
jurisdiction of the magistrate; neither is there any action so secular (so it
be done by a member of the Church) but, so far as it respects obedience to God,
it may pertain to the taking notice of by the Church.

50. Therefore the exempting of Ecclesiastical men (as they are called) from
the jurisdiction of the civil magistrate, as also the unloosing then from
obedience due to Magistrates, and Parents, brought in by Papists under a
pretense of Religion and perfection, is altogether contrary to the perfect Law
of GOD.

51. In respect of this ruling which comes from the power of superiors, there
is due from inferiors, subjection and obedience. Hebrews 13. 17. Obey your
leaders, and submit your selves.

52. Subjection is an acknowledgment of their authority. 1. Pet. 2. 18. Ephesians. 5.
22.

53. Obedience is the performance of those things that are prescribed. Ephesians. 6.
1. 5.

54. This obedience ought always to be limited according to the limits of
power, which the superior commander has.

55. Hence we must not obey men in those things which are against the command
of God, for we must obey in the Lord, Ephesians. 6. 1. And in the fear of God. Col.
3. 22. Or also against the command of those superior persons who have greater
authority then they.

56. Hence also that obedience must not be blind, or without examination of
the precept: but an inferior ought to enquire so far as is requisite for the
matter in hand, whether the precept belawfull, convenient and binding. Acts 4.
19.

57. But if the precept be not lawful then an enduring of the punishment
wrongfully inflicted, has the place and force of obedience. 1. Pet. 2. 19. 20.

58. In respect of the good that is communicated either by the gifts, or by the
power of superiors, inferiors do owe submissive thankfulness.

59. Thankfulness is a desire to recompense benefits received.

60. For it is a certain welwishing affection, having respect and proportion,
to the benefit of another, yet so that it must not be contained in the
affection it self, but must be manifested in answerable endeavor.

61. Thankfulness indeed is the common duty of all men, who have received any
benefit from others, but there is a certain singular way of thankfulness, of
inferiors toward superiors, which is declared in that word, when thankfulness
is said to be submissive.

62. Hitherto pertaines the relieving of their necessity, whether they stand in
need of substance, help, or counsel. Genesis 45. 9^.

63. This thankfulness, which respects those by whose benefit we do under God
subsist, namely our parents, and country, or those who sustain the same person
with them, is called piety. 1. Tim. 5. 4.

64. The duty of equals toward all their equals is, that one prefer another
in honor: Romans 12. 10. Ephesians. 5. 21.

65. Friendship is toward some that are joined nearer in love and communion.
Prove. 18. 24.

66. The beginning of all honor to be given to our Neighbor, especially of
that which is due to superiors and equals, is humility.

67. This humility as a virtue, whereby one does so moderate his esteem of
himself, that he will not in any kind attribute any thing to himself above
that which is meet for him. Phil. 2. 3. In humility of mind thinking every one
better then himself.

68. Unto humility is opposed pride and envy.

69. Pride is an inordinate affection of a man's own excellency.

70. This affectation of a man's own excellency if it be exercised about good
things that we have, it is called boasting: if about those things which we
would seem to have, it is called arrogance: if about the fame and esteem
which we seek with others, it is called vain glory: if about dignities, it is
called ambition: if about the undertaking of matters, which are beyond our
strength, it is called presumption.

71. Envy is a sorrow for the good of our Neighbor, because it seems to
diminish our own excellency. Number. 10. 29.

72. For if there be fear of another good, because we see some evils like
to come from thence either to others, or to our selves, it is not envy, but an
honest fear, Prove. 28. 28.

73. If the cause of sadness be not that another have good, but that we have
not, and that good is to be wished for by us, then it is not envy, but
emulation. Romans 11. 14.

74. If the cause of sadness be the unworthiness of him, who enjoys that
good, then it is not properly envy, but indignation. Pro. 29. 2.

75. Yet all these affections if they exceed measure, are wont to be noted in
the Scriptures under the name of envy. Psalm. 37. verse. 1. 7. Pro. 3. 31.

CHAPTER XVIII.
Of humanity toward our Neighbor.

1. Justice which respects the condition of our Neighbor absolutely
considered, does either respect the person of our Neighbor, or his outward
commodities.

2. That which respects his person does either respect his life, or his purity.

3. That which respects his life is humanity, and it is commanded in the sixth
Commandment. For seeing here man's life is properly provided for, or as the
Scripture speaks; Genesis 9. 5, 6. The soul of man and the blood of man; all
that duty which is here handled is rightly set forth under the man: of humanity.

4. This Commandment does not properly treat of the life of the brute
Creatures, because they are in man's power, Genesis 9. 2. 3. Neither have they
common society with man: yet because a fit disposition toward the life of man
does infer some respect to another image of his, which is found in other living
Creatures: and cruelty against them is wont to declare a certain inhumane
disposition, or by little and little accustom to it: therefore clemency and
inclemency toward the brute Creatures, does, pertain also hitherto as a
certain appendix.

5. Humanity is a virtue whereby we are inclined to preserve the life of our
Neighbor, and quietness thereof by lawful means.

6. But this is performed two ways, namely by supplying things helpful, and
hindering things hurtful.

7. But seeing the life of man which ought to be preserved is twofold,
spiritual, and corporal, hence the duties of humanity are some spiritual,
and some corporal.

8. The spiritual duty is to do all things according to our power, which may
further the edification of our Neighbor.

9. Of this kind are, prayer; good example and admonition, which are required
of all.

10. For although these immediately in regard of their next end, be general
duties of charity, yet mediatly and in respect of the remote end, they pertain
to the furtherance of the spiritual life of our Neighbor. James 5. 20.

11. There is the like reason, of ceasing from due offices pertaining to the
salvation of our Neighbor, of consenting with other in their sins, and of
offense given to them, which are sins opposed to those duties: for these do
always hurt the spiritual life of our Neighbor, Ezec. 3. 18. and 13. 19. and
33. 6. 8. Romans 14. 15. 1. Cor. 8. 11.

12. But although as the soul is more noble then the body, so the spiritual
life is of greater price then the corporal; and so those sins which do make
against the spiritual life of our Neighbor are greater, (an equal comparison
being made) then those which hurt the body: yet they do not so really pertain
to the hurting of our Neighbor: because hurting and bodily death it self is
wont to be brought on men, by necessity of coaction: but spiritual death
cannot be brought upon one by another unless he be in some sort willing and
do consent, so that is own action is the immediate cause of it.

13. Also it is required of superiors that have power, and authority, that they
study to further the salvation of inferiors by their authority.

14. There be diverse degrees of our duty toward the corporal life of our
Neighbor, that it may be kept quiet and safe.

15. The first degree hereof is, in those virtues which do keep us far from
any hurting of our Neighbor.

16. Of this kind, are Meekness, Patience, Longsuffering, and placablenesse,
or pardoning of wrong.

17. Meekness is a virtue which does moderate anger. Prove. 17. 17. 1. Cor.
13. 4. Numb. 12. 3. Now the man Moses was very meek; above all men who were on
the face of the Earth. Gal. 5. 22. The fruits of the spirit restraining of
anger, goodness, gentleness.

18. Unto this is opposed, slownesse and wrath.

19. Slownesse is a want of Just anger. 1. Sam. 12. 13.

20. Wrath is an inordinate stirring up of anger. Genesis 49. 7. Cursed be their
anger because it was fierce, and their wrath because it was cruel. Eccles. 7.
10. Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of
fools.

21. The degrees of wrath are, provoking of the mind waxing hot, and hatred.

22. Patience is a virtue which moderates anger that is stirred up by grievous
wrongs. Luke 21. 19. Colossians 1. 11. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 14.

23. Long-suffering is a continuance of patience, although it have been long
provoked. Proverbs 14. 29. and 15. 18. and 16. 32.

24. Placablenesse is a virtue whereby we do easily forgive a wrong done to
us. Mat. 18. 21. 22. Luc. 17. 3. 4.

25. The second degree of this duty is in those virtues, which do cherish
society of life, as, concord, and benevolence which has joined with it,
courtesy, affability, and equanimity.

26. Concord, is a virtue whereby we do easily agree with others in those
things that are good. Philippians 1. 27. and 2. 2. and 4. 2.

27. Benevolence is a virtue whereby we wish all things prosperous to others.
1. Cor. 13. 4. Charity is kind.

28. Unto these are opposed discord, dissension and enmity, etc. Gal. 5. 20.

29. A third degree of this duty is in those endeavors whereby the life it
self of our Neighbor, is defended, furthered, and cherished.

30. An endeavor to defend, promote, and cherish the life of our Neighbor,
does contain all those duties, whereby we may be conserving causes of the life
of man. Prove. 24. 10.

31. Unto these are opposed all those sins, whereby the life of men is hurt, as
fierceness, cruelty and the like. Pro. 20. 10.

32. All these are contained under the name of Homicide.

33. Homicide is the injust killing of a man.

34. Now that killing and hurting also is unjust, which is either not done by a
just authority, that is, that that is public, or which is equal to public;
or not upon a just cause, or not in due order, or upon an intention that is not
just; for those four conditions ought always to concur to a just killing;
if one of them be wanting, Homicide is committed.

35. Also rash anger must be referred to Homicide, so far forth as it tends to
the hurting of the life of our Neighbor. Mat. 5. 22. Whosoever is angry with
his brother unadvisedly.

36. But in those words it is given to understand that all anger is not
condemned, for that only is reproved which is rash, that is, which has no just
cause, or observes no just measure. Otherwise the force of anger, as zeal of
God, is often commended. Genesis 30. 2. Ex. 11. 8. and 16. 20. and 23. 19. Numb.
16. 15. and 31. 14. 2. Kings 13. 19. And hatred it self, Psalm 139. 21. 22.

37. This is for the most part peculiarly belonging to the sixth precept, that
those things which are forbidden, may sometime (in another consideration) be
not amiss, and sometime well and rightly done in obedience toward God.

38. So he that kills another upon mere chance, to whom he gave no cause,
whilst he is about a lawful work when and where it is lawful, fit diligence
being used, does not sin. Deuteronomy. 19. 5.

39. Such also is the reason of a necessary defense, so as desire of revenge be
wanting. For this is an unblameable defense granted to every one.

40. Sometime also God is obeyed by killing. Deuteronomy. 13. 9. Namely when it is
done by authority, and command from God. 1. Sam. 15. 18. 19.

41. No man has power from God, by common Law to kill that man of set purpose
whose innocence he knows of.

42. Neither is there any power of man, which can give sufficient authority to
any subject, to slay him, whom he knows to be innocent, and not to deserve
death.

43. Therefore a war can never be just on both sides, because there cannot be
cause of death on both sides.

44. Neither is it lawful in any war to intend their occasion who are not in
some sort partakers of such like cause.

45. But if there be present a lawful cause, together with a just authority
and intention, and a just manner be used, the war it self, or warfare, is not
against Religion, Justice, or Charity, Number. 31. 3. 1. Sam. 18. 16. and 25. 28.
1. Chron. 5. 22. Luc. 3. 14. Romans 13. 4. 1. Pet. 2. 14.

46. Also the same conditions observed, it is lawful for those who have skill
in weapons. 1. Chron. 5. 18. Psalm. 143. 1. To offer and apply their help to
lawful Captains; to make war. Luc. 3. 14. 1. Cor. 9. 7.

47. No Law of God permits any one to kill himself.

48. Yet it is lawful and just sometime for one to expose himself to certain
danger of death.

39. Nay sometime the case is wherein one may and ought to offer himself to
death. Jonah 1. 12.

CHAPTER XIX.
Of Chastity.

1. Justice which respects the purity of our Neighbor is Chastity.

2. Chastity is a virtue whereby the purity of his person is preserved in
respect of those things which pertain to generation. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3, 4, 5.

3. The parts of Chastity are two, shamefastnes and honesty.

4. Shamefastness is a part of chastity drawing back from impurity, which is
in the same sense also called bashfulnesse.

5. Honesty is a part of chastity leading to those things, which become purity.

6. Shamefastness and honesty are radically in the inward choice of a man, but
significatively in the outward conversation.

7. Hence chastity is chiefly named shamefastness, as it does take away the
outward signs of impurity: and it is called comeliness, as it puts the
outward signs of purity.

8. Unto shamefastness, modesty is chiefly referred, and to comeliness
gravity.

9. Modesty is a virtue whereby we contain our selves within the bounds of
fleshly desire.

10. Gravity is a virtue whereby the decorum of purity is observed.

11. Chastity is virginal, conjugall, or viduall.

12. But this distribution is not of the Genus into Species, but of the adjunct
into his subjects.

13. For chastity is the fame in respect of the essence in all, but it admits
some accidental differences, according to the different states of those by
whom it is observed.

14. For virginal is that which ought to be kept by a virgin until she
contract marriage. 1. Cor. 7. 34.

15. Conjugall is that which ought to be kept in wedlock, Tit. 2. 5.

16. Viduall is that which is to be kept by Widows. 1. Tim. 5. 7.

17. Unto conjugall chastity marriage lawfully contracted and observance is
referred. Mat. 19. 6. 1. Tim. 2. 14. Heb. 13. 4. 1. Pet. 3. 1, 2, 4.

18. For this is the difference between single estate and married, that though
chastity may and ought to be observed in single estate, yet single estate of it
self makes nothing to chastity: but wedlock has both of it own nature a
certain purity in it self, as it is an ordinance of God, and also by virtue
of that institution, it becomes a means, to preserve purity and chastity.

19. Marriage is the individual conjunction of one man and one woman by lawful
consent, for a mutual communion of their bodies, and society of life among
themselves.

20. It is of one man with one woman, Genes. 2. 22. Malac. 2. 15. Mat. 19. 4,
5. 1. Cor. 7. 2. Levit. 18. 18.

21. For that perfection of friendship, and mutual offices, such as marriage is
cannot be had but between one and one.

22. Therefore Polygamy, even that which was in use with the ancient Fathers,
was always a violation of the Laws of Marriage, neither was it of old
tolerated by God by any other dispensation, then that whereby he is wont to
tolerate men's, infirmities, and ignorances, and to turn them to God.

23. To a lawful consent is required first, that the persons to be joined be
fit: Secondly, that the consent it self be agreeable to the nature of the
thing and the Law of God.

24. That the persons may be fit is required. 1. A just distance of blood,
Levit. 18.

25. For neernesse of flesh hinders marriage by reason of a certain special
reverence due to our own flesh, contrary to which is that conjugall
familiarity which is signified in that phrase. Do not uncover her nakedness.
Levit. 18. 6. 7. And following.

26. That distance of degrees, either of kindred or affinity, which is
propounded, Levit. 18. to be observed, is of common and perpetual right; for
the violation of it was among those abominations, wherewith the Gentiles
themselves are said to have polluted the Land. Verse 37. 28.

27. Yet it is not in all things of such essential moral right, but it may
admit exception, either upon mere necessity urging, as in the beginning of the
world, or upon a special command of God. Deuteronomy. 25. 5.

28. Spiritual kindred or neernesse (as they call it) brought in by the
Papists between him that baptiseth, or the Godfather, and the God-son or
God-daughter, as they call them baptized, as an impediment of lawful
matrimony, is an idle, and tyrannical devise of superstition.

29. Secondly, there is also required in the person that is to contract
Matrimony, ripeness of age, 1. Cor. 7. 36. Which if it should be wanting, she
could not contract other covenants of less moment, much less this so great a
covenant.

30. That this consent be conformable to the nature of the things, there is
required aforehand. 1. Consent of parents, if they be as yet in their power, 1.
Cor. 7. 36, 37, 38.

31. 2. Consent also of the persons contracting ought to proceed from certain
and deliberate counsel, without compulsion or deceit.

32. This conjunction is said to be individual, because from the nature of the
thing it self, it has the fame ends with the life of man, Romans 7. 1, 2, 3. 1. Corinthians. 7. 39.

33. They therefore that have concubines, who do contract between themselves,
for a time, do not marry according to Gods ordinance and allowance, but do
filthily elude it.

34. Neither does this perpetually depend upon the will only and covenant of
the persons contracting: for then by consent of both parts, a covenant so begun
may be unloosed again, as it uses to be between master and servant: but the
rule and bond of this covenant is the institution of God, whence also it is in
the Scriptures fometime called the covenant of God. Prove. 2. 17.

35. This institution of God whereby he establishes the individual fellowship
of husband and wife, does respect the good of mankind in a just conservation of
it by a certain education, and hereditary succession of children, which cannot
be done without an individual conjunction of parents.

36. Therefore lawful marriage cannot be unloosed before death, without most
grievous guilt of him who is the cause of it.

37. No not infidelity or heresy in either part does give a just cause of
separation. 1. Cor. 7. 12, 13.

38. But if one party make separation with obstinate pertinacy, the other party
in that case is freed. 1. Cor. 7. 15.

39. This conjunction is for the communication of bodies, because there is in
marriage first sought an holy seed. Malac. 2. 15. And secondarily a remedy
against carnal desires which are now since the fall in men, who have not a
singular gift of continency, so unbridled, that (unless they be helped by this
remedy) they do as it were burn them, that is, make them unfit for pious
duties, and make them run headlong to unlawful and foul mixtures, 1. Cor. 7.
2, 9.

40. Hence the body of the husband is said to be in the power of the wife, and
the body of the wife in the power of the husband, so that they ought to give
due benevolence one to another without defrauding, 1. Cor. 7. 3, 4, 5.

41. Hence also the vow of single life, as it takes place among the Papists, is
not a vow of chastity, but of diabolical presumption, a snare of the
conscience, and the bond of impurity.

42. Also society of life, and that most intimate, for mutual comfort and
help, is among the ends of marriage: for seeing a man must leave his father and
mother, and cleave to his wife, Genesis 3. 24. And seeing the woman is said to be
made a meet help unto man. Genesis 2. 18. This helping society does not only
pertain to the propogation of mankind: but it must be extented to all the
duties of this life.

43. All these are mutual between the husband and wife, and ought to be
observed of equal right, as touching the essence or sum of the matter, yet
so as that difference of degree which comes between the husband and the wife
(that the husband govern, and the wife obey) be observed in all these things.
1. Pet. 3. 7. 1. Cor. 11. 7. 8. 9. 10. Ephesians. 5. 33.

44. Unto chastity luxury is opposed in a more strict sense, whereby it sets
forth an unlawful use of those things, which pertain to generation, which in
the same sense is called, uncleanness inordinate affection, and evil
concupiscence. Col. 3. 5. Lasciviousness. Romans 13. 13. The disease of
concupiscence 1 Thessalonians 4. 5.

45. Unto Luxury are reckoned all the helping causes, effects, and signs of it
as unchaste looks. Job 3^. 1. Pro. 9. 13. 2. Pet. 2. 14. Mat. 5. 28. Noddings,
Kissings, Embracings, Touchings, Dancing, Shows, Songs, Gestures, and the
like. Gal. 5. 15.

46. Unto the helping causes of Luxury are referred, Gluttony and Drunkenness.
Romans 13. 13. Ezech. 16. 49. Prove. 23. 31. 33.

47. Unto the effects, and signs of it are referred lasciviousnes, and
lacivious habit, Prove. 7. 11. And obscene speech. Ephesians. 5. 4.

48. The kinds of Luxury are. 1. Scortation, which is the mixture of a single
man with a single woman, 1. Cor. 6. 16. Whether it be Stuprum, whordome, which
is the deflouring of a woman otherwise honest: or fornication properly so
called, which is the mixture with a dishonest woman, or a whore. 2. Adultery,
when at least one of the persons offending is married or betrothed. 3. Incest,
when those are mixed together which are near in the flesh. 4. Rape, when force
is added to Luxury. 5. Mixture against nature.

49. Adultery is most properly and essentially against marriage, the band and
covenant whereof it breaks of it own nature; and so is the proper and just
cause of a divorce, which is not to be admitted for many other sins, although
they be more grievous.

50. A just devorce does dissolve the band it self of marriage.

CHAPTER XX.
Of commutative Justice.

1. Justice which respects the outward benefit of our Neighbor by a certain
appropriation is called commutative Justice, because it is chiefly used in
changings.

2. This Justice is a virtue whereby every man's own is given to him in
external commodities.

3. Now that is said to be every man's own, whereof he has a lawful dominion.

4. Dominion is a right to dispose perfectly of a matter so far as Laws
permit. Matthew. 20. 15.

5. There be two parts of a perfect dominion, propriety and the use of it. Luc.
20. 9. and 10. 1. Cor. 9. 7.

6. Now these are sometimes separated, so as the propriety is in one, and the
use for a time in the power of another.

7. This Justice is exercised, in the getting and using.

8. The Justice of getting depends upon the cause of the dominion.

9. The cause and reason of a dominion is called a title.

10. A just title is a just occupying, an inheritance, a gift, a reward, or a
contract.

11. A just occupation is a lawful taking of things which were belonging to no
body before, yet may become some bodies.

12 Those things are said to belong to no body which are not possessed, neither
are in any ones dominion.

13. In this sense all things are said to have been common in the beginning of
the world, and also after the flood: because they belonged to no man by
possession or peculiar dominion, and so were propounded in common to every one
that did first take or occupy, whereunto also pertaines, that blessing of God
upon mankind. Genesis 1. 28. Fill the earth and subdue it, and bear rule over
every beast, and over all fowls of the Heaven, and over all the beasts that
creep upon the Earth, which is also repeated after the flood; Be fruitful,
increase and fill the Earth.

14. Of the same condition also are now those Islands of the Sea, and parts
also of the continent which were never inhabited.

15. Of the same right also are all those things which did once belong to
somebody, but afterward ceased to belong to any, which are wont to be called
things vacant or forsaken.

16. But things that are lost are not to be accounted with these, unless there
have been due diligence used to find out the true owner: for otherwise although
they be not corporally detained from another, yet in right, with will and mind
they are possessed.

17. Hence those wares that to lighten the Ship are cast into the Sea, or are
by some Ship wrak brought to shore, are not to be accounted for things vacant
or forsaken.

18. Unto this occupying is captivity referred, which is an occupying caused by
right of war justly undertaken.

19. An inheritance is a succeeding into the goods of another, by virtue of his
just will, Levit. 25. 45. 46. Number. 27. 8. 9. 10. and 11.

20. A gift is a free bestowing of a good thing. 1. King 10. 10. and 13.

21. A reward is the recompencing of a work done.

22. A contract as it pertaines to this place, is a communicating of a good
thing upon an agreement binding to it: the form of which is, I give, that thou
may give, or I give that thou may do, or I do that thou may do, or
I do that thou may give.

23. Unto possession by contract is to be referred. 1. Buying, when a thing is
had upon a certain price, 2. Letting, when the use of a thing is granted for a
certain reward. 3. Borrowing, when a thing is taken to be rendered freely
again, in the same, generalled mutuum: or to be restored in the same special,
called commodatum, to which a pledge or depotum may be reckoned.

24. About these matters a lawful occupation, or course of living, is
conversant belonging to all men, except those who enjoy public offices, of
whom we have spoken before at the fifth Commandment: for such occupations of
life, although they do from the nature of the thing pertain to the common
good, and ought to be thither directed by men; yet they do with all belong to
the private good of this life in getting, and keeping the goods of this life.
Ephesians. 4. 28. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 11. 12.

25. All are bound who are not exercised in greater, offices, and do not
prepare themselves to them, to exercise some such occupation. 1. Tim. 5. 13.
Genesis 3. 10. According to that of the Apostle, if any will not labor, let him
not eat. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 10.

26. Neither is it enough that one labor, unless he labor that which is
good. Ephesians. 4. 28. That is, do follow that occupation of life, which agrees
with the will of God and the profit of men: studying quietness and diligence.
1 Thessalonians. 4. 11. 12. and 2 Thessalonians. 3. 12 Unto which are opposed slothfulness,
voluntary beggary, vain, curious, unclean arts: and an unnecessary care of
other men's matters, which is called Busibodines.

27. But to what singular kind, of occupation every one ought to apply
himself, that depends partly upon the inward endowments and inclinations which
he has. 1. Pet. 4. 10. And partly upon outward circumstances whereby he is
carried more to one course of life then to another.

28. But because there is a singular providence of God exercised in directing
such matters; therefore every one is rightly said to be assigned to this or
that kind of life, as it were by Gods reckning.

29. But although in respect of this divine providence such a special
occupation of life is wont to be by proportion called by Divines a vocation:
yet this is not so to be taken, as if that vulgar men were as well separated by
God to their occupations, as a believing man is to live well, or a Minister of
the word to fulfill the work of the Ministry: for neither is there any where
in the Scriptures, either any such thing declared, or the title it self of
vocation, simply and properly given to any vulgar occupation.

30. For the Apostle, 1. Corinthians. 7. 20. When he makes mention of vocation,
does not set forth any certain occupation of this life, (for circumcision, and
uncircumcision, service and freedom, are not occupations of life or just
callings) but he distributes, as it were, the calling of the faithful, by the
subjects, when he shows that some are called being servants, and some being
free, as appears Verse 24. Where he unfolds the variety of calling by that
diverse state and condition, in which the called are found, neither does he
there command that every one abide in that state in which he was called: for he
permits a servant to aspire to freedom, Verse 21. But he teaches that there
is no difference of a free man and a servant, in respect of Christ and
christian calling, Verse 22.

31. In the defect of such possessions poverty consists, and riches in the
abundance of them, 1. John 3. 1.

32. Riches lawfully gotten, though in their own nature they be not moral good
things, yet they are good gifts of God. Prove. 22. 4.

33. And poverty has the respect of a punishment or affliction, Prove. 21. 17.

34. Therefore there is no perfection, in casting away or forsaking riches,
unless the special will of God require it. Acts 20. 25.

35. But evangelical poverty which is spiritual, may consist with great
riches, as in Abraham, Job, etc.

36. Also propriety and distinction of dominions is the ordinance of God and
approved of him. Prove. 22. 2. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 12.

37. In this right of dominion both in getting and using commutative Justice is
exercised, the sum whereof is that we possess our own, not another, and
that without the hurt of others.

38. But the foundation of this Justice is placed in the lawful keeping of
those things we have.

39. Unto this keeping is required parsimony and frugality, Prove. 21. 15.

40. Parsimony is a virtue whereby we make only honest and necessary expenses.

41. Frugality is a virtue whereby we order our matters, with profit and
benefit.

42. The perfection of this Justice properly flowing from Charity is in
Liberality.

43. Liberality is a virtue whereby we are inclined to communicate our
commodity freely to others, by the Will of God. 2. Cor. 8. 14. Romans 12. 13.
Levit. 25. 35. Ps. 37. 19.

44. Unto liberality pertaines not only a free giving, under which is
comprehended the forgiving of a debt: but also free lending. Luc. 6. 34. And
hospitality, Romans 12. 12. 1. Pet. 4. 9.

45. Alms properly so called does consist in this liberality, when it is done
upon taking pity on the calamity of our Neighbor.

46. Theft in the larger signification is opposed to a just title of dominion.

47. Theft is an unjust taking away of that which is another man's against the
will of the owner. Ephesians. 4. 28.

48. Taking away comprehends, taking, detaining, and damnifying.

49. A thing is said to be another, which is another, either in respect of
propriety, power, or possession.

40. In diverse causes the owner upon right of humanity is supposed to consent,
to the bestowing of some part of his goods, although he has not actually
testified his consent, and then the respect of theft cease. Deuteronomy. 23. 24. 25.

51. But seeing that which is another man's is taken away either secretly or by
force: hence there are two kinds of this sin, namely theft specially so called,
and Rapine or Robbery. Exodus 22. 1. Hos. 6. 8, 9. Luc. 8. 21. 1. Cor. 6. 8, 9.

52. Unto theft is referred all fraud which is used in buyings, or sellings, or
in any other unlawful getting.

53. Theft in the common wealth is Peculatus when things that belong to the
community are taken away, and Annonae stagellatio, when the buying and selling
of corn or other things is made deerer then is fit, by monopolies, or the like
arts.

54. Unto rapine are referred oppression: Esaias 3. 14. and extorsion. Luc. 3.
14. 1. Sam. 2. 12.

55. Unto parsimony and frugality is opposed profusion, which is an immoderate
bestowing of those things which we have.

56. Unto liberality is opposed covetousness, which is an immoderate keeping
of those things which we have, Prove. 11. 24. Or a greedy desire of those things
we have not, 1. Tim. 6. 9.

CHAPTER XXI.
Of telling Truth. Veracity.

1. Justice which does affect our Neighbor mediatly, is Veracity and
contentation. For by that our Neighbor is affected, by means of his credit,
and by this by means of some work or action of ours belonging to some
Commandment going before.

2. Veracity is a virtue, whereby we are inclined to observe truth in giving
testimony, Mat. 23. 22. Ephesians. 4. 25. Psalm. 15. 2.

3. Of this telling truth in giving testimony, the ninth precept does properly
handle, and not of those things only or chiefly which pertain to the fame of
our Neighbor; For fame pertaines to that honor, the consideration whereof is
had in the fifth precept: neither is it to be put after riches and the profits
of this life, whereof it was handled in the eight Commandment. Pro. 22. 1.
Neither does a testimony true or false pertain to the same of others only, but
also to their possessions, and life it self. Pro. 30. 14.

4. It is also manifest that the words themselves of this precept do most
directly respect proceeding in judgment, Numb. 35. 30. Deuteronomy. 17. 6. and 19.
15. In which places many other things are handled beside fame, although they
ought also to be extended to all public, politic, and sacred testimonies. 1.
Cor. 15. 15. John 1. 7. 8. 15. 19. 32. 34.

5. Hence actions in places of judgment, have not only approbation, but also
direction from this precept; namely that judgments ought always to be
grounded on fit testimony, (unless there be that evidence of the matter which
needs to witness) or at least strong and violent (as they call them)
presumptions, which are equal to testimonies.

6. The words of a testimony must always be used in that sense as they are
understood, or are thought to be understood by those to whom the witnesses
endeavor to give credence, without equivocation, doubting, or mental
reservation.

7. Truth in a testimony is threefold. 1. When that which is said is
conformable to the thing which is in hand. 2. When it is comformable. 3. When
it is conformable both to the thing and to the mind.

8. The second truth is that which is most properly looked at in a testimony
and in veracity: yet the third is required in those things, a certain
knowledge of which we are either bound or profess to have.

9. This veracity is in a simple assertion, or in a promise.

10. The truth of an assertion is always thus farnecessary that if we affirm
any thing, it do consent with the mind and our judgment.

11. Also sometime an assertion it self is necessary when either Justice or
Charity requires it of us.

12. Justice requires it in public judgments of the Judge, of the plaintiff,
the defendant, of the witness, of the advocate, the notary, and the proctor,
and out of judgment when we are bound to bear witness by some special right.

13. Charity requires this when good comes to our Neighbor by it, without
equivalent hurt to our selves or others.

14. Truth of a promise is called fidelity.

15. Fidelity is a virtue, whereby we are inclined to keep constantly our
credit given.

16. This Fidelity is the foundation of civil Justice, and all agreements, and
contracts: for a reciprocal promise is a contract.

17. To the truth of a testimony is opposed a Lie. Ephesians. 4. 25.

18. A lie is properly a testimony, whereby one pronounces otherwise then is
in his heart. Act. 5. Whence is that phrase in Scripture of a double heart, of
a man that is a liar. Psalm. 12. 3.

19. But because a thing pronounced, does not consist only in outward words,
but chiefly in their sense; therefore the same words which are true in one
sense, in another sense become a lie. Mat. 26. 61.

20. Ironies, fables, jests, repeatings also of false things, and the like are
not lies, because they are not testimonies; and they are not testimonies
because they are not confirmed by the credit and authority of the speaker.

21. An intention of deceiving, although it do almost always accompany a
false testimony, yet it is not of the essence of it, neither is it necessarily
required to a lie; for although one know that he with whom he has to do
cannot be deceived by his lie; yet if he have an intention in speaking to
affirm that which is false, he lies no less then if he had hope of deceiving.

22. An intention of hurting does indeed increase the mischief of a lie: but
it makes not the nature of it: for if a man out of jesting or a desire to
please and be officious, confirm that by his credit which he knows to be
false, it is a lie: pernicious of its own nature, if not others, yet to the
author himself: as it is in those who are given to flatteries or boastings, or
are delighted in confirming monstrous fables or fictions unto others.

23. An intention to speak that which is false, makes a lie, although that
which is spoken be most true.

24. The asseveration of a thing incertaine for certain, is accounted with a
lie although we think it to be true.

25. Also that secrecy whereby one does not speak the truth when Justice or
Charity requires it, does partake of the nature of a lie.

26. But when neither Justice nor Charity requires to give testimony, then the
truth or part of it may be concealed without sin. Ier. 38. 27.

27. Among lies, those are more heinous, in which the testimony is more
solemn, as in public judgments, which are chiefly respected in the words of
the ninth precept, in sacred matters, and in the like. Matthew. 26. 59. 1. Cor.
15. 15.

28. Hence subscriptions, testimonies, or commendatory letters, given against
the known truth are foul lies.

29. That dissembling which consists in deeds or signs, and not in words, is
not properly a lie: unless the same either of their own nature, or by some
certain appointment, have the force and use of speech: as, 1. Sam. 20. 20. 21.
22. Mat. 26. 49. Because such deeds and signs that are not verbal, have no
certain and determinate signification, so as they can have the force of a
testimony.

30. Therefore such dissembling is sometime lawful, as in warlike stratagems.
Ios 8.

31. But it is made unlawful when in respect of the end or manner, it fights
with religion, Justice or Charity.

32. Unto fidelity is opposed perfidy or unfaithfulness.

33. A lie is committed in a promise, if there be not an intention of doing
that which is promised, unfaithfulness is committed, if there be not an
answerable endeavor to perform the same: therefore a lie and unfaithfulness,
may be joined together, and they may be also severed.

34. When a testimony toward our Neighbor is confirmed by an oath, then the
oath is an adjunct of that testimony: and although it do in it self respect
God only, yet in this use it respects our Neighbor also.

35. Therefore perjury in such a testimony is directly and immediately a sin
against reverence due to God: but mediatly it violates also that Justice which
is due to our Neighbor.

36. Asseveration is the manner of a testimony whereby the sincerity of the
witness, and the certitude of knowledge which he has of the thing witnessed,
is declared: whence also it is not unfitly by some called a protestation,
because it produces a witnessing by explication.

37. Therefore in an asseveration there is not a second contestation coming to
the former as there is in an oath: but an illustration of one and the same
thing.

38. Neither is there any calling upon God in a mere asseveration, which is
essential to an oath.

39. Yet an asseveration is not convenient but to the more grave testimonies,
for it is as it were a middle degree between a simple testimony and an oath.

40. We must most of all abstain from those asseveratioins our common speech,
which have some show of an oath.

CHAPTER XXII.
Of Contentation.

1. COntentation is a virtue, whereby the mind does rest in that portion that
God has given him. 1. Tim. 6. 6. Heb. 13. 5. Phil. 4. 11.

2. This contentment is commanded in the tenth Commandment, as appears by the
words themselves, neither is it any way meet that this Commandment be referred
to that inward and original purity of righteousness, which is the fountain
of all obedience; for that is not generally commanded in any one Commandment,
but in all: neither does it more pertain to the second table which is the
condition of this precept, then to the first.

3. Yet because of all virtues which are contained in the second table there is
none more internal, or more intimate to primitive righteousness then
contention, and we are as it were lead by the hand from this, to contemplate
and seek that: therefore that purity is not unfitly by occasion of this
precept handled here.

4. Unto this contentation is joined joy for the prosperity of our Neighbor as
of our own. Romans 12. 15.

5. In that contentment and joy consists the top and perfection of all charity
toward our Neighbor. In which respect also contentment is in a certain manner
the perfection of godliness and a godly man. 1. Tim, 6. 6. For godliness is
great gain ((...)) with contentment, or producing the perfection of co^tenment.

6. Hence it is commanded in the last precept according to that order which
proceeds from the more imperfect to the more perfect, and from that which is
more known to that which is less known.

7. For this is a duty most perfect, and most unknown to us by nature, that
whatsoever we conceive or will, it be joined with the good of our Neighbors.

8. Therefore although this of its own nature has the first place among duties
to our Neighbor, as the foundation of all the rest, yet because it is last in
having a being in man corrupted, therefore it is commanded in the last place.

9. Unto Contentation is opposed concupiscence. Heb. 13. 5.

10. But by concupiscence is not onderstood the power and faculty of lusting,
and desiring which is natural: nor the act or operation of that natural
faculty which is also natural and lawful, neither the whole inclination of
our nature which is corrupt, which is not specially condemned in any one
precept, but in the whole Law: nor all those chief actual lusts which are
inordinate, a great part whereof is contrary to religion and condemned in the
first table; nor lastly, all lusts which tend to the hurt of our Neighbor, for
those which have a deliberate consent, and purpose of prosecuting joined with
them, are condemned in the several Commandments: But that desire whereby the
mind is first instigated, and tickled, with desire of the good things which are
our Neighbors, although it be not yet come into the mind to get them by
unlawful means, 1. Kings 21. 2. Marc. 10. 19.

11. By reason of that affinity, or near consanguinity which those first
motions of injustice have with original corruption, whence they do arise,
they are wont by many to be as it were confounded with it. But. 1. Original
sin, is as it were an inbred habit, perpetually dwelling in us, having it self
in respect of the existence always in the same manner; whilst we live here;
but these morions are transient actions proceeding from that habit. 2. That sin
dwelling in us, is no more original, then a general principle of all vicious
actions, but those acts, which are condemned in this place are manifestly
circumscribed, as having respect only to our neighbor.

12. The Apostle himself, Romans 7. does plainly open this precept by a
Synecdoche of the operations of sin, for concupiscence, Ver. 7. is the same
with the affections of sinners, Ver. 5. And with concupiscence effected by sin,
Ver. 8. And so must necessarily be distinguished from sin dwelling in him. Ver.
7.

13. Neither is it any marvel that the Pharisees (of whom Paul was one) did
not acknowledge the first motions of concupiscence to be sins, seeing the same
is yet stiffly denied by their cosen germans, the Papists.

14. They that divide this last precept of concupiscence into two, so as one is
of coveting the house, and the other of coveting the wife, with that which
follows in this matter. 1. They are forsaken of all reason. 2. They are
constrained either to root out altogether the second precept of the first
Table, or to turn it at least into a needless appendix of the first, that
they may seem to retain in some so^ the number of ten words, or rather (which
is evident in many or^) (...) obs^ring the force of the second precept, they
may with some show remove it from themselves, and their superstitions, they are
constrained to tear in sunder this tenth precept. 3. They cannot certainly
design which is the ninth, and which is the tenth precept, because in the
repetition of the Law, Deuteronomy. 5. 27. Coveting of the wife is put before the
coveting of the house. 4. They can declare no distinct injustice, between these
covetings, whence also it comes to pass, that they themselves in explaining
the decalogue, do always join or rather confound te ninth and tenth precept.
5. The very words of the decalogue, do expressly note one precept when they
forbid one act. Thou shall not cover, and one common object whatsoever is thy
Neighbors.

15. There is referred to concupiscence as a cause, the inordinate love of our
selves, which is called (...). 2. Tim. 3. 2.

16. This self-love is the foundation and original, in a sort of all sins,
not only against our neighbor, but also against God himself. 2. Tim. 3. 4.

17. This concupiscence is that which is distributed by John, into that which
is of the flesh, respecting those things which pertain to food and lust, and
into that which is of the eyes, respecting those things which pertain to
outward delight and profit: and into that which is of the pride of life,
respecting those things which pertain to the glory and pomp of this world. 1.
John 2. 16.

18. Unto joy and well-pleasednesse in the prosperity of our Neighbor is
opposed, envy, or an evil eye, Mat. 20. 15. And (...) or rejoicing in the hurt
of our Neighbor. Psalm. 17. 3. 4. Obad. 12.

19. In this last precept that perfection of Justice is commanded, which is in
some sort explained throughout the whole (...) ^e: as in the first precept of
the (...) ^e, all Religion is in a certain manner commanded, so that in the
first precept of the first table i^ contained that first and great
Commandment, Thou shall love God with all thy heart: and the second table like
to this, thou shall love thy Neighbor as thy self, is contained in the last
of the second Table.

20. From this perfection which shines forth in any one of these precepts it is
manifest, that a perfect and accurate fullfilling of the Law, is impossible
even to the faithful, by that grace which is bestowed upon them in this life.
For seeing (as it is well said) the rule and measure of our obedience is in
affirmatives, Thou shall love with all thy heart: and in negatives, Thou shall
not cover, both of which is impossible in this life, it does necessarily
follow, that none can exactly satisfy the Law.

21. In this life we know only in part, 1. Cor. 13. 9. And therefore we act
only in part: we have received only the first fruits of the spirit. Romans 8. 23.
And therefore we cannot exactly observe a Law altogether spiritual. Romans 7.
14. We carry about us flesh that lusts against the spirit, Gal. 5. 17.
Therefore we cannot obey without concupiscence, inclining and drawing another
way. Finally we are not perfect, Phil. 3. Verse 12. We cannot therefore
perform perfect obedience: but we have always need to have that petition in
the heart, and in the mouth, Forgive us our debts.

22. Yet it is truly and rightly said that the yoke of Christ is easy, and his
burden light. Mat. 11. 30. And his Commandments are not grievous. 1. John 5.
3. Because the Law is there considered. 1. As it is observed by the faithful
who delight in it. Romans 7. 22. Psalm. 119. 14. 16. Not as it ought to be
observed; for that observation brings rest unto the souls of the faithful.
Mat. 11. 29. Although imperfection cleaving to them is grievous and troublesome
to them. 2. In respect of the spirit, not in respect of the flesh. Matthew 26.
41. 3. Remission of sin and of all imperfection which cleaves to our endeavors
being joined with it. 4. In comparison of the Letter of the Law which kills.
5. A comparison also being had of the reward appointed by God to imperfect
obedience begun: in which sense even all afflictions are counted light. 2. Cor.
4. 17. The easiness therefore and lightness of the Law of God is not in the
proportion of it to our strength: but in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God together with the Communication of the Holy Spirit: which
is with all those that love the Law God.

Amen.
