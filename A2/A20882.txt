Drunkards Dyall: or, (...)ood Sir, Your Nose is durty.
Being a merry Jest most finely conuaide,
Between an old Lad, and a witty young Maid.
To the tune of Riding to Rumford.


THere was a lusty Lad
In London dwelling,
That would a wooing go,
where drink was selling:
Where a Less lustily,
kept this lad company.
Till the Pots quality.
made his nose durty.
Tossing up Cup and Can.
one after other,
He could no longer then,
his fancy smoother.
But gave unto his Less
a draught that welcome was,
How comes it (Sir) to pass,
your nose is durty.
Quoth he, in courtesy
I must be doing,
Give us another Pot,
of the last Brewing.
Here my love, here is to thee,
soft a while, sir quoth she,
For me thinks now I see
your nose is durty.
With that this lusty Lad,
bravely began swagger,
Uowing to lay to pawn,
his Dudgin dagger,
Fill us full half a score
of Cannes, or somewhat more,
You Will not away before
your nose is durty.
Thus the Wench flouted him
as he was drinking,
Which he for favors took,
to his own thinking.
Thus away Ale and Bear,
went by this cople here,
And she said still, my dear,
your nose is durty.
Having now drunk his fill,
out he went reeling,
With a wild running braiue
void of all feeling,
With his beloved sweet
by his side in the street,
Where all that did them meet,
saw his nose durty.
Being thus led along
all did deride him,
Till one among the rest,
soundly did chide him,
And had him home to wend
and not his time to spend
For now I see, my friend
your nose is durty.
How comes it now to pass,
you are so myred,
A pot of Ale quoth he
has my brains fired.
Then said the other now
I see below your brow,
Although you know not how,
your nose is durty.
FINIS.
The second Part. to the (...)


THen the Less led him home
to her own dwelling,
Where is behapt a Jest
well worth the telling,
There with his durty nose
much he did wrong his close,
And one might then suppose
his nose was durty.
She brought him strong waters then,
fit for his drinking,
With some Tobacco, which
made him so stinking.
That none durst come him nie,
if yor akse reason why,
You know as well as I,
his nose was durty.
Falling then to the ground,
came his beloved,
Where a plain dealing friend
she her self proved.
Seeing him in that place
in a most drunken case,
Staring him in the face,
saw his nose durty.
And for acquaintance sake
took him up friendly,
Bearing him to a bed,
neat, fine, and cleanly,
And laid him down to sleep,
who could not go nor creep
For he had drunk so deep,
his nose was durty.
Next day when he arose
he looked about him,
Perceiving how his Less,
finely did flout him,
He asked the reason why
she told him presently,
Then he found by and by,
his nose was durty.
Being sorry for his fault,
thus he protested,
That his brains never more
should be molested,
Thanking his loving friend,
that she did succor lend,
And said he would amend,
his nose from durting.
Parting thus soberly
went he on trudging,
But mist his purse, when he
came to his lodging.
(Quoth he) to dear a shot
have I paid for my lot,
Say my friends, have I not,
with a nose durty.
All men that love good Ale,
and other Liquer,
Nothing in nimble brains
can be more quicker:
It will steal cunningly
in your pates by and by,
And will make shamefully,
all your nose durty.
FINIS.
