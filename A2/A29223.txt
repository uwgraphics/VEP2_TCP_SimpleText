ASTRAEA'S TEARS. AN ELEGY Upon the death of that Reverend, Learned and
Honest Judge, Sir RICHARD HUTTON Knight; Lately one of his Majesty's Justices
in his Highness Court of Common Plees at Westminster.



LONDON, Printed by T. H. for Philip Nevil, and are to be sold at his Shop in
Ivy Lane, at the sign of the Gun. 1641.

To my worthily-accomplished and most endeared Cousin, SIR RICHARD HUTTON Knight.
SIr, here receive these Obit-teares of Ours,
While Native Love and Duty nourish Yours:
Let us then join our Funeral Odes in One,
"His dearest God-sonne with his Eldest Son.
Though Heirs in such like Tears do seldom share,
I Am sure true Tears stream from your Fathers Heir.
Excuse me, Sir, that these come forth so late,
"They come too soon by' Voice and Vote oth' State.
To my truly-esteemed and highlyrespected Cousin, THOMAS HUTTON Esquire; A
Member of the Honorable Society of Grais-Inne.
TO you, though younger, yet the same in blood,
Send I this p^tterne of parentall good:
Whose imitation shall you more advance
Then Fortunes portion, or Inheritance.
For those to Meals of worthless minds are given,
Where these Li^es ^halke you out your way to heaven:
Whose lineall-lustre if you do not smother,
Makes you Corrivall with your Elder Brother;
Whom as I live I love; and in him you:
"This shall my Muse in richest raptures show.
While Memory over your dead Father reares
A Shrine bedewed with Astraeas Tears.
TO THE PIOUS MEMORY Obiit. Feb. 26. Anno Domini 1638.
of Sir RICHARD HUTTON Knight; And lately, One of his Majesty's Justices of his
Highness Court of COMMON PLEES at Westminster.
AN ELEGY.
GReat Aescul^pius, had thou none to kill
But Britains grave Hortensius with a pill?
Hippocrates his Maxim never meant
On Goodmens lives to make experiment
But on indulgent patients, who did breath
Less spirit in their life then in their death:
For their inglorious Ev'nings could forbid
Others to do ought less then what they did.
Tell me, O tell me! who could with his eye
Survey a gracefull-usefull Nurcerie,
S^ored with various plants that might besit
Their Masters turn for Shade or Bene^it,
And in this Seminary to cut down
An humble mounting Tamrick, though (...)
Whose very Site might prove him to be made
A Grace for some, to other plants a Shade?
Injurious Fate! if I may justly call
That Fate unjust, which is impartial;
Why would thou not in this vast wilderness
(Where every worldling seems to interesse
His sole employments, as no place but here
Were th Na^ive soil whereto he must adhere)
Cull out such rotten and worme-eaten trees
Who keep a place, but promise no increase?
Some might thy subtle eye have quickly found
C^ock'd, or with swelling bunches to abound;
Others so sweangely (...)'d, 'twere hard to know
By their loose-dangling tops what way they grow.
Others so freely spreading, as their root
Takes so much ground, it holds all others out.
Others Time-statis^s, scorning to incline
To any complete humor but of Time.
Others like Sprigges from the Phoenix ashes bred,
Fix on that Sun by whom they are nourished;
From which should thousand motes like atoms rise,
They Would vow them beams darted from Phoebus eyes.
And coulds't choose none of these to make a dish
For hungry worms, and close a Subjects wish?
These do no good, they trouble but the earth
By making goodness labor of a dearth.
But say, Grand-Artizan of pick and spade,
If thou in purple have desire to trade,
Traverse thy ground, thou can not safely err,
But find Intelligencers every where.
Here may thou find a Coelius, one of might,
Who pleads worse with his le^t hand then his right:
A Critic Con^ull, who Records can tax,
And make the Law a very nose of wax.
Neat-glorious Glosses can his Art find out
Either to raise or reconcile a doubt:
And with such confidence, as if this man
Were held the Ages sole Justinian:
Yet of his reasons he no ground can gather,
Unless he lie them on an unknown father.
Hows'ere, his weak Assertions are held good,
And long-approv'd e're they be understood.
But the Reason why he bears such high command
Is this, "He Is great for whom he seems to stand.
There a loose-liv'd-licentious Appius
Who woo's his mistress with a reverend busse:
A purple-prostitute, that hides this mo^e
With gravity and color of his coat.
Yet who should see this useless Trunk, would swear
His age had made him fitter for a Bear
Then amorous embraces; and this grave
Grave-sinking Patriot must his Doxie have,
Who in her active postures is so pliant,
She feeds on him, as he did on his Chent.
There a sweet-sented Flavius, who could spe^
More Tully in steletting of his peak^
Or twirling his Mouchato's, then those low
Declining dr^ssie Groundlings ^'re could do,
Flowers of selected phrases spring by nature,
While matter must serve words, not words the matter:
No air sounds unasfected, which imparts
More music to our ears then to our ^earts.
Yet though his tongue be smooth, his body small,
Within he stores huge Magazins of gall,
Which raise in him such indigested pas^ion,
As if styles of disgrace were all in fashion.
Were not this Bird, in earnest tell me Fa^e,
F^rre sitter for thy Cage then for our State?
Surely, I think, it would avail thee much
(His moving tongue and eloquence is such)
To have him for thine Orator, to draw
Poor Morta^ to submit them to thy law:
And though he hold himself for Death unfit,
He might move others to encounter it.
There a word scattering P^theas, who asfords
A drop of reason ^or a sea of words.
Of numerous discourse, and so well fraught
As he speaks more then ever he was taught:
And in those conscript Magisteriall Seats
A Chaos too of Cases he repeats,
How properly I mean not to debate,
Hows^ere it argues a retentive pate.
Thus Aristippus finds stones set on stones
Senseless of widows tears, or orphans moanes.
THESE eye the Clock, and measure out the day
In numbering hours, not hearing what men say.
What rich* enameled Shadows (Fate) are these,
Who fat themselves to foster a disease?
These suck full fortunes from a Gooses quill,
By setting of their Names unto a Bill
Which (as they seldom do) if they read over,
They are no wiser then they were before.
But a Gramm'd purse can never knowledge want,
It Is want of means displaies the ignorant.
There a corrupt Sysambris, who would win
A precious Bribe with losing of his skin.
There a Turinus, who in every nook
Deludes poor people with the sale of smook.
These Chymicall Impostors from gross mold
Extract the Elixir of refined gold
And never surfeit, till their mouths be filled
With that rich gravel their injustice pill'd.
For as the Horseleach cries still, more, more,
So they desire new measure to their store,
Which like (...) bowels, swell so fast,
As they consume their owners lungs at last.
Now tell me Fate, were thou enjoined to steal
This precious treasure from our Commonweal,
And spare impurer metals soild with ru^,
Who ^y a shame upon their Coun^ey's trust?
There was a time, but no such place as ^ere,
When to Anticyrae such shipped were
As honored goodn^sse: No inhabitants
Admitted were but timing Sycophants,
Lascivious Palliards, who made public sal^
Of vestall-virgin-honours by re^aile.
Da^k shops were in request to vend base ware,
Each in an act of knav^ry claimed his share.
Whole Sholes of bankrupt M^rchants week by week
Broke, and those held the wisest that did break
For most, and when it lay within their power
Could subtilely delude their Creditour*
Petitiona^ie Pa^es grew strong,
Pretending by prescription to do wrong:
State* prolling Sh^s, who to supply their turn
Laughed in their s^eeves to s^e their Country mourn^*
Naught smel'd of profit, though it took beginning
From that contagious* leprous source of sinning,
Bu^ ^relished: yet how did these bestow
This large dis^aming fortunes overflow
But on Vi^ellian bankets, luscious f^re,
Ph^ntastick habits? while ^ir Ladi^s care
Extended to a Play hill, a Caroach,
A complete Usher, or Postillion Coach;
A Bevy of outlandish Tirewomen,
For naught could s^it their humors that was common.
No Artist, were he never held so rare,
Tasting no other but his country air
Could gain request: those only bore renown
Who were least ^nowne to fashions of their own*
Those then were honest men, who in good troth
Could mi^ce an oath, and cheat, and wipe their mouth,
Guild virtue with pretenses, and deceave
Deluded eyes with only seeming grave.
No real goodness purchased them esteem,
Those were held good, that did but goodly seem;
Yea, seeming-good lost her account in time,
And by degrees fell into that decline
As those who gave a countenance to good
Were held degenerating from their blood:
So as to lie a blemish on His fame
Whose actions were a glory to his name;
Or to detract from good men, or disgrace
A Magistrate or Justice in his place
Was held an act of honor; -- Th'Counterfea^
Taxing a Justice on his Justice Seat
Was an high-Mu^y made; none durst reprove
His frontlesse impudence, but highly love
His ^esolution, though his (...) Spirit
Merely consisted in debasing merit:
Nor needed this indulg^nce, though he erred,
In good men's thoughts, he ever was preferred.
Those only Martial Ch^valieres were held
Could veil a plume o^ ^eathers in the field*
Speak big to their inferiou^s, and define
(What they had got off book) their (...).
Then rank their squadrons in each regiment,
Though they knew little what their Captai^ mean^*
Nor he himself, while he by mimick charms
Could gull the State, and guild his harmless A^mes.
BUT our's a golden age, a gloriou^ State,
Where no such Scarabees surround our gate*
Our Purp^e-co^script-fathers are divine
And scorn ^o clo^e with th'humour of the time.
They shun pres^rment as our Clergic do,
And would decline it, were it offered too.
Their Judgments and (...) do proceed
From a dis^rcet, sage and judicious head:
For what imports the public interest
That they deliver with a constant breast.
Our Courti^rs too, they have no tricks to please,
To purchase suits, dese^tlesse offices.
Free are they from all avaritious thirst,
What they pr^serre it must be honest first,
For else to gain an Empire they'^ not do^ it,
Nor show least graceful countenance unto it,
These s^riously examine every point
In su^ a suit, before they will stir a joint,
As thus: "Is It honest? may it not offend
"The State? inserrs't not some peculiar end*
"May't introduce no president of ill?
"Nor with suspicious fears the people fill?
"Doe'st undermine no Trade? No Commerce stay?
"Nor turn our Traffic clear another way?
"Does it not trench upon some Company?
"Nor wrong the Sta^ by some (...)?
"May I present'^ with (...), and come off
"Like a wise Courtier without a scoff?
"May I ingratiate him do'es employ me,
"That no calumnious Agent may annoy me?
"May I with reputation so proceed
"As no just rub t'ancipate my speed.
"Is the foundation firm whereon I stand?
"Does't promise good success if rightly manned?
"Should it be granted, as't imports one
"Would it do good to many, hurt to none?
This our good Courtiers weigh, as may appear
By ma^y S^its presented lately here:
Wherein sole love to goodness was their aim,
Which they pref^rr'd before their Patt^nts gain.
O^r Ladies too are modest in attire,
They see no foreign dr^ssings they desire;
No cerussed complexion they endure,
To feed vain fancy with as l^ght a lure;
They keep their windows shut; no bosom bare,
It must be private if they take ^he air.
They sacrifice not the Morning of the day
Unto their Glass, nor the Evening to a Pla^;
Our Court*rere banke^s seldom they frequent,
But make their Feasts a poenitentiall L^nt.
They care not for priority of place;
Nor woo affection with a borrowed face.
They love not to consort, nor to be known
To any Favori^es but to their own.
(...) may be well their Embleames, for they live
Still within doors, lest ^hey should Patt^rns give
Of wandering unto others; They are chary
Whom to admit, but whom they mean to marry.
Their Usher, though he be a proper man,
Has but access unto them now and than,
And then he stands at distance, lest he tempt,
Or his familiarity breed contempt.
They ask not what this dressing cost, nor flower*
Fruitless expenses they reserve for the poor,
And with as free extensive hand they give it
While ev^ry farthing sweetened is with Civit.
If a light-amorous line approach their hand,
Like a poor-wounded Dear at Bay they stand*
Astonished at the folly of such men,
Who ravell Time out with so light a pen.
Yet they will peruse the Letter ore and o^e
And find, perchance, more then they found before*
Not to admire him nor aff^ct his strain
But to disgrace him when they meet again;
Yet with such sweetness, he shall hardly know
Whether in earnest they be moved or no.
Such modest-Matron-Mirrors, Ladies be;
They coyness love, though Love's their liverye.
Our Camp-Commanders too, they merit praise,
Who had they lived in Agamemnons days,
Those fierce Atrides, or in Arms had come
When Carthage was beleagred by Rome,
Brave Hannibal, Hamilchar, Asdrubal
Had raised their City to a Capital.
So active is the Gentry of our time,
So docile too in feats of discipline,
Which such impressions in their service take,
As one weeks training may an Ancient make.
Tara tantara, what a martial sight
Of brav^ Commanders disciplined for ^ight
Approach the insulting foe! no stra^agem
Practiced abroad but introduced to them;
No feat, defeat, advantage, point of war^e,
But to our Colonels familiar.
No Terms of Arms but these exactly know,
Their Marches, Postures, and Gradations too,
Their Sconces, Palisado's, Parapets,
Their Military-Ovall Coronets*
Sallies, Alarme^, Excursions, Rendevous,
Issues, Retraits, their Pay unto a souse*
Their Martial Ord'nance too they can dispose
And to the disadvantage of their foes
Plant them with such discretion, none would deem
But that they knew the Friar invented them.
Their Musket, Saker, Minion, Culverin,
Dragonet, Basiliske, and Carabin:
These wi^h their several Charges they will explain
By their dexterity unto a grain.
These pass that Captain, who desired to hear

What discipline was used in every shere,
Or what ^ew O^dinance they had in store
This I Will was not acquainted with before:
By a brisk merry Gre^ke, whose jeering nature
Could tell a Tale, and never laugh at th'matter
Noting his ignorance, was answered thus:
"Sir, there be (...) lately come to us
"Of strange proportion and as strange a style,
"The like whereof never landed in this I Will.
"And if my memory fail not, they are ^hese,
"State-frighting Formidons, Quo (...),
"Neat Cerciorares, Stocks that never will burst,
"By Fabius Max^mus invented first,
"When by delay and spinning out of time
"He finished his glorious design.
"And these, beleev'^, Sir, are of such esteem,
"As Harqu^busses are but Squi^ts to them
"For useful mannagement: for I have scene These Cou^ might have (...) in
(...) for (...) he kn

"In Zealand, Brabant, where I of^ have been
"And kept my fixed P^rdue, ^hese Arms do more
"One hour, then others would in twenty four.
The credulou^ Captain, he b^leeves the man,
(...) much to k^ow from whenc (...) came,
And by wh^ Eng^es drawn on horse or foot,
B^t (...) A^ney f^aring to be out
By (...) m^re discourse, bri^fly decl^r'd
How they were molded, plan^d and pr^par'd,
But at such distance, as (...) he s^ed
Was ^y the (...) firmly cred^ed
For real (...), ^s't might appe^re
The mere he heard, the more he sough^ to hear:
So a^ in the end this expert Bl^eman vo ^'d
He had spoke naught that could be di^-allow'd:
For h^ving (...) h^ard L^w-terme before
A (...) might be a Muket-bore
For ought he knew; nor did he hold it fit
That the Enemy should notice have of it,
But that such Engin^s as he had related
Should by command be on ourselves estated
Without discovery to such foreign Powe^s
As wished no succ^sse to us nor ours.
But their occasions so divide their journey
As the Captain must take leave of his Attu^ney,
Ret^rning him great ^hankes for his relation
And wishing many such within our Nation,
Whose known experience might secure the State,
An^ make the Age engaged to his pate.
Though the Law man knew not what these Engin^ meant
Nor ever any other Instrument
Save what his A vaste Magazin of Bilis, with other Law-Engines.
Law-port mantua did contain,
The late reversions of a factious brain,
Whose native vigor being broke asunder
Would startle weak D^fendents worse then t^under.
Yet one Occurrent I must here relate
Which in their Progress happened of late;
This Chivaliere had a desire to play
A game at Bowls his journey to allay,
Or else directed by another aim
(More probable of two) in hope to gain.
A Cumrade takes him up; but the Captai^e would
Have none but this Attorney keep the gold,
That strange Rel^ter, for he held him just,
And therefore none he might more safely trust:
What he enjoynes, he as demurely takes,
But in conclusion runs away with stakes.
But ^iding on no swift (...) Steed Clozing with tho Stanz^'s of f^mo (...)
"What though ^ Jade his Masters fury fee "He yields t spoil be cause he
wanted heels.

He renders stakes because he wanted speed.
Bu^ let no tr^fling Tales take up that place
Which on my Po^m sh^ld bestow most grace.
Our Clergy too; men of a ^hoice repast,

(For I r^serve my best wine for the last)
How they s^orne av^rice; Ioath venerie,
And sing an Anth^me with Conformiti^?
Survey their dainty Du^ks from top to toe,
Their active (...) w^sts above, below,
You shall see beauty in her proper place,
Without Embrode^y, Fringe, or Tinsell lace:
And to restrain wild fancy, their intent
Crowns pure resolves with a religious Being ^st austere observers of that
^ncient Decretall touching Absti^nce and Conti^ in Lent.
Lent.
Their fixed desires are cloz'd; they do not crave
From their Parochialls more then they have.
Their late P^ition was not meant a pressure
T'inrich themselves, but to improve th'Successour;
For what they did was out of Conscience
While their desires cloz'd in a competence.
They hate Non-residence with all such vermin
As feed their Audience with a pocket-Sermon.
Their Study makes them lean: they scorn to rise
To honor or a deoble b^efice.
Zeal is that sacred Lamp they study by,
Which they display in turning white oth' eye.
Our zealous Zimri's too, their Trophies raise
Adorned with Rose-mary and gilt Baies,
Wherewith they meet their late-^xiled Pastor,
Servant and Master who may run the faster.
Their precious fervor can present their grieves,
Thousands combining to pull down Lawne sleeve^.
So strong's th'infusion of our Bandites zeal,
They Would form the Church to Plato's Commonweal:
Presbytrian parity sole undertaker
To raze a Doct^r, and to raise a B^ker.
Yet in this pure Platonic Common-w^le
We have some Darnell mixed in our me^le.
All are not Solons that do Purple wear,
Nor all true Courtiers that do so appear;
Nor all our Ladies really devout,
Nor all our braving Cavaliero's stout;
Nor all our seeming Levite^ well content,
Nor all their zealous f^males continent.
The Sun h'as motes, what may we think of these
Who taken with fancy, honor or with fees
Expose their fames to an injurious stain
Which blemished once, are never made white again?
What of these ^ormall Agents who pretend
Good to the State, but work their private end?
These moder^ Mac^vels who can devise
A virtuous vizard for an odious vic^?
These who can lie their hand upon their heart,
And gull their loyallst friends with words of Art?
Such fruitless shrubbs in my opinion were
Fitter to cope with F^te then such as are
Mirrors of Justice, who bestow their O^le
To fructify a lean and barren soil
With honest culture, or such Scien^s croppe
Who shadow f^eer Spurges with their top.
And such an One was that grave P^triot
Whose pious zeal such reputation got
Amongst g^od-men, who only hold such great
As make just action^ steps unto their Seat.
These close not with Times garb, nor can they veil
To that Soild-foot-cloth sets his soul to sale.
And yet there are Some such make Justice go
On Crutch^s, while poor virtue ranked b^ low
Must hold his Stirr^p; of which vicious sort ^port for (...).

Yeering Democritus could make a sport;
Accoast them with derision, and discover
The loose embraces of a wanton Lover,
To make them more contemptuous to themselves,
And caution simple Clients of such Shelves
As most endanger Justice: "If you will live,
"And prosper in your Suits, be sure you give
"Meat to the mouth oth' Court; you are rightly served
"In suffering a good cause for to be starved
"For want of exhibition: let him ply
"The Iron while it is hot, and in a pie
"Incoffin such a bounty, as't may force
"The Judge to crown his Cause though it be worse
"Then his penurious Adversary, who
"Was foiled because he would nothing to bestow.
"Suits are like Pills, they must be gilded over,
"For should they any bitterness discover,
"The squeamish appetite would not receive them,
"But either loath them or directly leave them.
"Some have I seen advanced to a place
"For their smooth polite tongue, or amorous ^ace.
"Others by making betts, as I Have been told,
"While others lost their Place, for being Old.
"This raised for making Courts an Ostridge nest,
"That razed for br^nging Courts into request:
"Playing his Cards so to his public shame,
"For all his huge Ruff, He must lose the Game.
"One in a Funeral pomp goes to his Grave,
"One in triumphant port jetts to receive
"His Consul-charge; yet e're the next Moonth come
"A Writ of Ease may kick him from his room.
"For as it is fit, whens'ere th'Dictator please,
"He must surrender by a Writ of Ease.
"Laugh, laugh Democritus, for thou art free
"From these State fears Who is he mind^th th^e?
This merry frumping Stoic meets soon after
With other Objects to revive his laughter,
Pie-colour'd ^umorists who make their Nation
An apish introducer of each fashion;
And these he laughs and wonders at, how Reason
Should suffer Sens^ her Organs to imprison.
"Brisk sooles, quoth he, how you debase your mind

But how art thou transported! ^ye this Piece
Whose living actions rendered an increase

Where he administered justice: first of ^hese
To his long-practis'd Seat in the Common ple^s,
Where his confirmed judgment on that Ben^h
Begot an awful graceful reverence
In his Observers: scorning to devour

EPITAPH.
A Rarer Sage never Age brought forth,
Richer in fame, love, real worth,
Freer in heart, milder in Speech,
Apter to learn, fitter to teach,
Gladder to dye, nor in his death
Less taken with affected breath:
"Nor did he any Sermon need,
"Who left his life a Bo^k to read.

HUTTON KNIGHT: And late one of his Majesty's Justices for the Court of Common

H'as got more ground ^hen ^'re he purchased
By this seven foot: for he was well content
To keep that state was left him by descent.
A simple worlding, easily beguiled
In trusting of his substance with a Child;
A subtle Child, who from his Stygian shore
Had tricks to cosen him and hundreds more.
A numerous B^ok man, who from several places
C^uld store his pleadings with a thousand Cases,
Which proved his Studies were estranged from Sloth,
His Leafes not Spider-wov'n, nor known to Moath;
As I Have seen some, who shelv'd large volumes by the^,
But knew not what was in them, should you try them.
These take up Law and Learning upon trust,
And with a Foxes tail brush off the dust
From their rare-v^sited Authors. -- Such as these
Account it their prime Theo^y to get fees.
Whereas this Patriot had an higher aim,
Holding a precious name his chiefest g^ine.
He knew his Heart triangular to be,
A fair resemblance of the Trinity,
And that it could no more be filled with mould,
Then a tri-ang^ by a Circle could.
This, th^s enlarged his intellectual aim

A Funeral Tear.
FATE, could thou find a more perplexing word
Then to pronounce Death on mine Honored Lord?
But since thou have past thy censure he should dye,
Find One that may his temp'^ature supplye.
So sweetly mild, religiously wise,
So graceful to all knowing hearts and eyes,
So nobly rich in faculties of mind,
So firm unto his own, to all so kind;
Show me one Instance and I will not tax
Fate to deprive the State of Mollinax.
But thou reply'st, it is the fault of Time
To merit few good men, it is not mine.
It Is true; yet we for tar^s shed often more tear^s
Then for the sca^tering of our whea^en-eares.
Let Us learn our passions then to moderate,
As they r^flect upon the public State:
"For great's the loss, must needs be understood,
"When we lose such as are both great and good.
To the pious memory of that judicious Patriot of his Country, Sir CHRISTOPHER
DALSTON KNIGHT.
A Friends farewell.
THe fabric of this Building now is pulled down,
The higher parted from the lower room;
The ^ver of this structure turned to dust,
The Center m^de a P^lour for the just.
Dull stones are rubbish useless for ex^mple,
This fit for the polished corners of the Temple:
The price th^n of this Gem who value can,
But He who now enjoyes it, God and man?
Upon his death.
TO some on Earth a quicker death is given,
No course can be too sp^edy unto heaven;
In him lies here, this may be ver^fide,
Who did to Earth, before on Earth he did.
He heard his Saviors invitation, Come;
And he no sooner heard him then he run.
This made him sle^ght his life, to show his love,
"H^ving his feet below, his faith above.

PANARETEES TRIVMPH: OR, HYMEN'S heavenly Hymn.
REmove that funerall-pile; now six whole ^he sixth ^ares (...).
years
Have been the Nursing mothers of my t^ares.
These rivell'd furrows of mine aged cheek
Have writ griefs characters exceeding deep.
But what is perpetual cannot mix with earth,
"Joys must partake with tears, and tears with m^rth.
Those careless foldings of mine arms must cease
While airs resounded cares, and car^s ay-mees;
While (...) were threnes, each motion of my tongu^
The dying accent of a Swan-like song.
These must be closed in her s^cred shrine
Whose living beauty, while enstyled mine,
M^de me too earthly-blest; -- Another rite
Must banish these presen^ments from my sight;
Yet in their exile shall I still retain
That Anniversall memory of her Name,
As those declining-e^rth-resolving flowers
Where wee'r to celebrate these Rites of ou^s
Shall to my though^s a Fnnerall Lecture read,
And in a fresh Brides beauty eye her dead
With such an active sorrow, as her Tomb
Were th'marriage-bed whereto I sought to come*
Yet must this time with Funeral tears dispense,
And with a feagned Solace ravish Sense,
As if it went to entertain a Guest
Which h'as been long estranged from my breast*
So have I seen the Sun his beauty shroud,
And suddenly break from a sable cloud
With an imperial splendour, but that beam
Became the true ^orerunner of a Stream.
So have I seen Plants in a forward Spring
With bloomes and blossoms lively flourishing,
Yet long before th'imbroder'd Spring were done
Those Pl^ts were seer'd, and all their blossoms gone.
So have I seen a glorious Star appear,
As if sole Empress of that Hemisphea^e,
D^rting her twinkling lights, and marching round
Contract her Orb, and fall upon the ground.
So have I seen a manly spirit fight
With death so long as Oil afforded light,
Nay smile upon his vi^itants, and say,
"I hope e're long, my friends, to have the day;
Yet see vain hopes! before next enter-breath
He proves these were but lightnings before his death.
So I; so my moist eye! which though it seem
To take the world with a pleasi^g beam,
And her dis-sorting passions to exile
With the reflection of a forced smile,
I Am same I was, and must be ever so,
"Woe may put off he^ weed, no weed her woe.
And yet me thinks 'twere ominous to shed
A Funeral tear before a Nuptial bed;
Thi^ might perplex a Bride, and make her wish
She Would never tasted of that painted bliss
So much by Maids affected, but had still
Been Mistre^se of her self and her own will.
Those Vi^lls then my teare-swolne conduits filled
Shall to a pure Elix^r be distilled,
Which well prese^v'd may treasured fountains keep
For those who make a face but cannot weep.
First those brave spritely Blades, who puff^d with pride
Would in their fathers sadles gladly ride;
Hope of concealed treasures, rich demaines
Have soakt the thirsty channels of their brains
They cannot weep to die for it: yet they are known
By ribband, Cyper^, mourning-hood and gown:
Which Ornaments of grief, hows^ere these bear them,
Seem better Mourners far then those that wear them.
Nor is there hope that these will e're have sense
To grieve, till what their Fathers providence
Which many restless nights had scrap't together
Their riot h'as sent packing God knows whither.
Then, never till then, they find what 'twas to have
A pleasing eye upon a Fathers grave.
To these my late-distreaming eyes shall lend
A legacy of tears, and so befriend
These state-presenting Mourners, none shall gather
But that they sorrow truly for their father
Without enforced passion; though short time
Shall prove those tears were none of theirs but min^.
There be some widows too, who stand in need
Of our (...) of tears to suit their weed,
That seeming weed of Sorrow: th^se belie
Their sable habits with a teare-forc'd eye:
And like (...) brave Egyptian modest D^mes
Whose (...)-bequeath^d breasts such love infl^mes,
As when their (...) (...) bu^ied be
They strive which may have ^he precede^cie
To be interred with them: So do these
With unamated coura^e strongly prease
Toward their Husbands graves: where they appear
All Niob^es; clasping the fatal Bear
With an affected zeal; and to ingrave
More Scenes of sorrow leap into his Grave
As if th^y'd be enshrined (though naught less meant)
In the cold bosom of that Monument.
Yet h'as not one poor worm undone a s^itch
Of his fresh-funerall (...); no, ^or that pitch
Which seer'd his Coffin fl^w'd; no, nor one flower
Which beautifide hi^ Hearse decayed in power;
No, nor that late provision which should
Refresh h^s formal Mourners, scarcely cold
Till her decreasing grie^es ^uggest unto her
An other hopeful, youthful, active wooer
To raise her a new progeny; which done
She holds joys past compared with joys to come
Fall short in estimate: She wonders much
How any woman's passion should be such
As to embrace an Husband that i^ dead,
When th'world's so well supplide, it can bestead
Her Choice of such a choice selected one
'Twere madness to lament for him that is gone.
To ^hese my (...) I zealously bequeath,
To sh^d some seeming streamlings at the death
Of their expired Husbands; that their sorrow
May show it self ^ssentiall, though it borrow
Juice from my ^yes, wh^h when Time shall restrain
I look my tears shall be restored again.
The profuse Gall^nt too, who lately sped
Of ^ full fortunes wi^h a loathed bed
Must share in my teare-trib^te to weep o^re her,
And wish (vain wish) that he h^d did before her.
Mean time, on ^hoicer stuff^ his love he se^s,
Steppi^g unto a bed of (...)
In stead of^ icy Consort, who is gone
To t^ke possession of her long^st home.
Yet must h^ fe^gne a tear^, and force a sigh,
And wish his dissolution to be nigh
To gull his weak Sp^ctators wi^h a s^eming
Of being what was least of all h^s meaning.
To fit his sorrow then with fr^sh supply,
He may deri^e from my distilling ^ye
A numorous store; yet would I have him come
When he h'as done (as he will have quickly done)
To render me, and that without delay,
What I have lent, and he is bound to pay.
Nor would I have him make the world believ^
While he so passionately seems to grieve,
That these distreaming rivolets arise
From any other fountain then mine eyes.
Now some will ask why my decaying time
Should to such solemn nuptial rites incline?
Whereto I answer, no licentious fire
Ins^am'd my sprinkling Organs with desire,
No glowing heat of fancy did I feel,
Unto my -- I freely may appeal.
These were unfitting motives to weak Sense,
Though Age must render age benevolence
When time, place, spirit may such acts adm^t
With equal willing minds to second it.
No, my affection never took delight
I^h' light embrances of a marriage night,
Nor to make sacred rites such tempting lures
To sat the desire without more inward cures.
For had these been mine ends, my constant aim
Had long si^ce fixed upon more youthful g^me.
Nor did I want in number to supply
The curious choice of loves-at^ractive ^ye,
Which may appear by those select^r lines
My widow Muse composed in former times.
*"Four wenches be there who my love would win, True, ^yes her (...), (...) in
^e th^d (...).

"And stick as close as Ticks un^o my skin;
"The first a widow worth * six thousand pound,
"But my Hopes say, more thousands may be sound;
"The n^xt as ^mble as ^he mountain Ree,
"But all her fortun^s are not worth a str^e;
"The third a w^nton witty worldly Circket,
"But too too many Cubbs have sprung her wicket;
"The ^urth of lov^ly hue and liv^ly qui^knesse,
"For th'Tri^kle-bed h^s cu^ed her green-sicknesse,
"A D^msell fresh a^ is the slower in May,
"B^t her pure zeal impurer acts display:
"Adv^se me wh ^h to choose, and I Will have at her,
"One must I have, more is an hanging matter.
And these were true, as I may h^pe for life,
Yet could no beauty stamp the style of wife
In my affection: for I found no Spouse
Could cheer^ my fancy l^ke mine inner house:
Which to adorn with v^ssels of ^hoice grace,
I made my Grove my sole-re^iring place.
Where in a s^cred melancholy I
Red in each Creature such variety
As I perceived the very lowest plant
Might read 2 lecture to the ignorant
To make him rightly learned: No Bird in the Air
But sung her morning thankful ch^elere.
Which made me blush to hear such hymns from th^se,
And I, ungrateful I, to hold my peace.
This 'twas that made me seriously to mark
The various warblings of the early Lark,
With wh^t a winged speed she made resort
To join in consort with the heavenly Court.
The Silke-worme I observed too, how she sought
Forth of those threeds she from her bowels wrought
To deck delicious man; how wondrously
Her silk-web spun, she turned a Butterfly.
Again, I turned me to a desert cave
Matted with moss^ like to an ancient Grave,
Wherein I found a subject of that sense
As it exceeded humane providence;
A brisled Hedge-hogge, who retains a form
Of storing in a calm against a storm.
These were the Books I red: for teare^ had so
Surpised my dim eyes with an overflow,
As to bestow my sight, I held it better
Upon a living then a dying letter*
Now you will wonder how I should depart
From this condition which had seaz'd my heart,
And take me to the world which I Would forgone
Since the deprivall of my dearest One.
It Is true, you well may wonder, yet I find
Some maine inducements to divert the mind
From such amazement* hear me, ^'l be brief,
And amongst many reasons call the chief.
I had some little Children for whose care
A native love enjoined me to prepare;
Tender they were in yares as in my love,
But, alas, hows'ere their Nonage might approve
My constant zeal, so weak was my intent,
I could not perfect what my purpose meant.
A Father though he lov's posterity
Cannot play Mother in a family,
Nor dandle a young infant, nor bestow
Such easy kisses as a Nurse can do.
No; nor ith'Needle, nor in any Art
Express himself so formally expert
As a remisser temper can apply,
Besides some offices necessity
Injoyne them to perform: Nor is this all,
No Solemnizer of a Fun^rall
But having cloz'd the period of his sorrow,
His late-expired tears may solace borrow
Of some calm interbreaths, and learn to smile,
Though it be far from (...), and so beguile
A pensive hour: -- Oh but a widows state
Preserved from blemish do'es p^rticipate
A gracious freedom! and you know we read
"Honor a widow that is so indeed.
Yet Eve when she was made of Adams bone,
God held't not me^t that man should be alone,
And therefore raised him Help, that joined tog there
One heart might ^ender mutual joy to either.
In this my griefe-surprized heart was needing,
To cheer my self and for my childrens breeding:
Whose choice improvement was my highest aim
Next the honor of his Name from whom I came.
Breeding, will some object, who can expect
From a Step dame whose fancie's disrespect,
Best favors frowns, content mere discontent,
And when most moved, most in her Element?
It Is true there are some such, whose only song
Is canting fury with a glibbry tongue,
Bearding their e^sie hu^bands, and appear
Rampa^s till they the good man's bretches wear:
Which purchase got, wi^h an imperious brow
They glory in the title of a shrow,
And lest their Husbands should their Lectures miss,
"Now mess served up without a Ch^indish.
And these indeed we Step-dam^s well may call,
But she is none such that I have matched withal.
For those who ^re her husbands children known,
She values them more then they were her own.
Nor is it a curious dress or luscious fare
That work effects upon her matron care;
What we account to be the precioust gem
That can adorn a civil Citizen
Makes her complete; it is a modest eye,
That wooes wi^h no straid looks the passer by;
Her Senses are all i^ward, which divine
She h'as no thought, save ^eaven, she styles not mine.
She dis-esteemes hand-basket Citizins
Who make their wicker baskets shroud their sin^.
Pure-elevated eyes who make a show
Of doing that they never meant to do
Are Bug-b^ares to her zeal; which loves to feed
Th'oyle of devotion as it is in d^ed.
The Church gives her a L^sson; and her scorn
Is to be taught in any other form.
For though, where those g^and (...) be,
She took ^he place of her Nativitie,
Their odious projects she does so despise
As with her N^dle she^'d pick out their ^yes
For want of stronger Arm^ur, to express
That loyal love which she did still profess
To Prince and Countr^y: this 'twas made me bring
That Scot^ish posie to our Nuptial ring:
Thus Tw^de and Tyne our loyal loves combine,
"Which Twedish factions never shall untwine.
O what a virile Spirit have I seen
My Panth^a show! what noble dis^esteeme
To her zeale-madded Natives, when she heard
How they were palisado'd, how prepared,
How desperately gagged to such a vow
As split their faith, and wrought their ruin too!
"What will these never have done, thus would she say, (...) expostulation with
the Calidonian Nation.

"Must Subjects soveraignize, and Ki^gs obey?
"Must a blind Zeal merely composed of smoke
"Delude a Kingdom with an holy clo^ke?
"Must th^se fall short of their allegiance
"Whom Princes grace and favor did advance?
"Must we with civil Arms uncivilely
"Shed blood, and styl't an Act of piety!
"Are all turned High-landers? must this debate
"Extend un^o an universal State?
"H'as my dear Country flourished till now
"With her light ze^le to work her overthrow?
"For love sake leave, leave these intestine wars,
"Succeeding ti^es will sorrow for their scarres*
"They cannot choose but such impr^ssions make,
"As th'motion of them may the Fabric sh^ke.
"If good Plants grow among you, cheer them still,
"But thrive they cannot till you prune the ill.
"Those ge^erous Graffs then labor so to nourish,
"That in despite of wild ones they may flourish.
"Letnot the ambition of a phrenticks head
"Suffer one drop of loyal blood be shed;
"It is too precious, if you rightly knew
"With what a sacred cement, holy glue
"You*r mu^ually combined: oh should you see

"You cannot choose but tax your insolence
"To b^ his foe who took his birth srom thence!
"Admire*h s Princely ^lemency, whose will
"Had a desire to spare where he might spill.
"Long h'as his white flagge freely been displaid,
"O let not your* submissi^n be delaid,
"Lest you to ill convert apparent good,
"And make a white flagge turn a flagge of blood!
"What though the thanklesse Joy should entwine
"The spreading spurges of the weeping Vine,
"And stick so close unto her seered stem
"Till she h'as sucked the juice that nourished them,
"Must she your Emblem be? oh do not so,
"These Acts work mainly for your overthrow.
"You Are Nativ^s and his Subjects, which should draw
"From you a zealou^ love and loyal aw.
"Let it be never said that the Commonweal
"Of Sco^land perished by pretensive Zeal;
"It will be such a blemish, such a scorn,
"It may impe^ch the Babe that is yet unborne
"When he shall hear (though guiltless he of that)
"Himself unhappy called a Traitors brat.
"If for your selves then you will not prove true,
"Yet for those Branches may descend from you,
"Retain your vowed alleg^ance, and return
"Before you see one peering Beacon burn.
"Which to the sad Sp^ctator being once shown
"I fear me much will not b^ quenched so soon:
"Lay down your Arms in time then; it is too late
"When you hear Fury knocking at your gate;
"While Fo^s and Famine close you so about
"A^ Fear gets in, but nothing can get out.
"Trust m^, your case presageth naught but loss,
"And that which you most hate, your fate, a (...);
"(...) aims must have disgraceful ends,
"Nor can the hope of Favorites or Friends
"Divert that Fate: for what heavens hand h'as writ
"Is not in power of man to cancel it.
"Much have I seen, yet seldom seen I have
"Ambition go gray headed to her grave:
"That your gray hairs may then with honor go
"Unto that Earth we all are borne unto,
"Renounce that brainsick oath you there have made;
"That Oath's unjust by which your Faith's betrayed.
"This your own N^tive wishes; crown her wish,
"Her vows shall pay their tribute for your bliss.
Nor does it less her disposition please
To Enjoy a private then a public peace;
Her Household sounds conformity: no jarres
Breath civil factions or intestine wars
In her calm Family: where some obey,
Others command without imperious sway.
None glory in prec^dency, nor stand
In opposition of a just command.
Again, if ought appear irregular,
She shows herself no rigid Censurer:
Her courteous Curtain Lectur^s they are such
They leave impressions with so sweet a tutch
In apprehensive fancies, clozing so
They make men good whether they will or no.
She yields preeminence unto her Mate,
And in this sort seems to expostulate.
"Let't not offend you, Sir, if I impart
"The weak expressions of a loy^ll heart.
"The world shall see that I Will prrforme my vow,
"Where you are Caius I am Caia too.
"As we are then united, hear me speak,
"Whose aims naught more then your improvement seek:
"Fix on your ripe experience which came
"Not only from th ' Survey of Books but Man.
"Unseason'd hours should challenge no such share
"In one who wears Times Emblem in his hair.
"That (...) Proverb in disgrace was made,
"That a (...) ^ead should have the green^st blade.
"Your actions should be postures to the rest
"Who are but man-like monsters at the best,
"While they d^cline from what is real good,
"And stain the tincture of a virtuous blood
"With ayry v^pours, which no sooner see
"The glorious Sun then they dispersed be.
"Reflect on these; let not an hour of time
"Want the dimension of a pre^ious line.
"Our Warfare's p^ssing short, our Conquest great,
"'T^s shame for reverend age to make retreat
"Or yield one foot of ground, or weakly crave
"A Parley when one foot is in the Grave.
"It sounds not well that a light-youthfull rage
"Should claim acquaintance on decrepit age.
"An Old-mans hours should princely patterns give
"To younger years, and teach them how to live.
"Yet, Sir, misconster not my words I pray,
"Your parts do please us, though your hairs be gray;
"No aged wrinkle see I in your brow
"Which with my soul I bear not reverence to;
"No hour so tedicus as when you are from home,
"No news so che^rfull as to hear you are come.
"Begot of s^ncy my ^mbraces be,
"Which scorn to cloze wi^h any one but thee.
"O let me t^en enjoy what we^ke by week
"My six years widdowhood did solely s^ke!
"Let not a Nights distemper e're divide
"My dear Musaeus from his Pan^hea's side.
"But if he do, all passion I Will exile,
"And tax his ^rrour with a pleasing smile.
"Such shall my Lecture be, which if it move
"I live, if not, I cannot leave my love:
"For such effects h'as true affection wrought,
"To Enjoy thy self is all, all else is naught.
Now tell me, are not these such sw^et reg^eetes
They Would weane a professed Lecher from the sheets
Of an enchanting S^ren? Could one tear
Drop from a disposition that is so clear
From all dissembled passion, and depart
Without a deep impression in the heart?
Could vowels lose their life, and turn to air
That were pronounced by one so good and saire?
No, no; I hold no Eloquence so strong
As when it falls from a calm Woman's tongue.
A Traveller may by ^xperience find
That Sunn^*(...) are more violent then the Wind.
These pierce the pores, and by their powerful heat
Resolve his native moisture to a sweat.
Mean time, though Winds with boundless fury blow,
They do not show their active motion so
As those reflecting beamlings: whence collect
"Calm airs produce the soveraign'st effect.
Nor do I speak this, any one should tell her,
Nor do I praise her with a mind to sell her.
For there is no earthly treasure that I see
Can counterveile so rich a pri^e as she:
But to praise goodness in a virtuous Mate
May others move in time to imitate
Whats'ere they graceful in another read,
And in those steps religiously to tread.
This have I in a fair Theater seen
By a rare Curt^an of rich esteem
Fully confirmed: who hearing one commend
The chast-devoted life and virtuous end
Of an heroic Lady, who o're^hrowne
Could not by him who conquered her, be won
To his embraces, but as't did become her,
Contemned life, for to preserve her honor.
"O, quoth this female hearer, that I might
"Be made so happy as enjoy the sight
"Of such a Nonesuch: I should scorn these tyres
"(Times toys) and cloth me with her chaste desires,
"And th'patterne of her goodness: so apply,
"As in her Service I would live and dye.
This gravelled all the Actors; but her heart
What e're they did, could not forget her Part
Which she so well performed, as that same night
This Curt^zan became a Conv^rtite.
Some other graces I could feature too,
Which to a judgment give a beauteous show
Because they have no varnish to adorn
Their sweet condition with a borrowed form.
And trust me, in such colors I Would portray them
As they should need no H^rald to display them,
Were it not that so many ancient Dames
Whose very years should tender their good names,
Seeing her graceful virtues so approved
And by herself improved, and therefore loved,
Might hold their actions blemished, when they hear
So pure a light fixed in a lower Sphere.
First, youthful widows, I appeal to you,
Who, loath to lose the benevolence that is due,
Upon your (...) marriag^, cry alas --!
"O what a brave Blade my first Husband was!
"How pliable to me at bed and board,
"How active in his work, true to his word!
"What pretty toys (such was his loving care)
"He would have brought me home from every Fair!
"The first ripe Cherry that was to be sold,
"Could it have purchased been with weight of gold
"Had been presented me: were Pease-cods dear?
"They had been mine in the nonage of the year.
"No gossip feast, but I might be invited,
"Where though I revell'd till I was benighted,
"Good man, he would sit up, till I came in,
"And with sweet langu^ge my affection win.
"If I but frown*d, he would weep like any Child,
"And fast from meat till he was reconciled.
"No forra^gne fashion, cost it never so much,
"But I must have't, his fancy it was such;
"I had mine own will too in every thing,
"Which to that height of spirit did me bring,
"As what I knew for best I would not do,
"Because my Husband had a mind thereto:
"So as I oft^n altered my intent
"Because he wished me do that which I meant.
"An agile Husband too, to crown my wish,
"But I find no such activenesse in this.
"His spirit rests only in command,
"His sovereignty to have the upper hand;
"But since to be my head it is his hap,
"I vow, that to that head I Will be the cappe.
"To temper then a nature that is so cursed,
"We Will strive who shall enjoy the Buckler first.
But cheerful is my Panthea, and desir^
To feed her fancy with diviner fires.
It cannot her sweet disposition please
To twit her last Choice with abilities
Of her first Husband: Such discou^se, says she,
Tastes more of lightn^sse then of modesty.
Her actions are all noble, and her speech
So full of gravity, as it may teach
The antient'st moral Dame, how to behave
Herself both for the ^orld and the Grave.
Admit she be no Helena of Greece,
Whose beauty wrought that tragical increase
Of Princely Funerals: it was my care
To set my f^ncy on an i^ward-faire,
Whose never-fading Lilli's might survive
The richest piece of beauty that is alive;
And in her pass^ge hence more sweetness breath,
Then thousand Hero's when surpised by death.
For tell me what is this skin-deepe beauty worth
When her diviner spirit is let forth
To Enjoy her freedom! Where are then those Stars
Whose love-attractive lights commenced such wars
With all the Senses! Sunk to such dark forms
As they are Cranies made to harbor Worms.
Where those enazur'd breasts which did supply
With lusciou^ Objects loves-enamour'd eye!
Teats for those slimy wormlings now to pull
Which wanton fancy used once to cull.
Where that aspi^ing front, that mount of grace,
That dimpled chin, that model of a face
More pure then Cy^thia's? nay, every lim
Where fanc^e bathed her liqu'rish senses in?
All hushed in Earth: no motion to be found
Unless by worme-sprouts shaken in the ground.
This outward fair then it is little worth,
Since it receives her tincture from the earth,
Whereto it must by native course return,
And so enshrine her beauty in an Urne.
Alas poor V^rmillion Earth! how is that state
Which showed such braving postures in her gate
Resolved to mouldred dust? where every grain
Proves to the world, that the world is vain.
Give me that wench (and I have such an One)
No dainty Leda, nor no homely Jone,
Where any one may re^d each d^y oth'weeke
"Some morall-mortall Lecture in her Cheek.
Where wrinkles write deep furrows in her face,
While every rivell d^es a^ford a grace
To her beseeming age: that, should we lack
Climact'rick ye^es within an Almanac,
Her reverend brow might pencile out that want
And find an Errand for Deaths Pursevant.
Pray then resolve me, may she not become
A Silyl-Sister of our Meani his Espc^ sall wit^ the Heli^ nian Mu^ to whos^
(...) honor (...) address this ^eavenly ^ym
Hellicon,
Who can contract her brows without a loure,
Wear ages liv'rie, and never look sour?
Enjoy her Husband wi^h a just delight,
And with discretion cool her appetite?
Feed her affection with the least of S^nse,
And make her wrinkles g^ine a reverence?
Live chaste to him she loves, and to that line
Confine those rich dimensions of her time?
Yes; she or none ^ and she it is or none
Whom I Am resolved to set my love upon.
That since my PANARETE lives in bl^sse,
My HYMEN'S heavenly H^mne may cloze with this.
FINIS.
Upon this Poem.
SOme will collect from hence (they cannot choose)
That I Am espoused; so am I to my Muse.
Whose presence yields such s^lace to my life,
I would not change with OVERBERIE'S wife.
Toys, Tyres and Dressings take not her desires,
She feeds her fancy with diviner fires;
Which so enliven me when I turn to her,
"Though I enjoy her, night by night I woo her.
My Hymenaeall-Heav'nly Hymn is this,
"CHRIST JESUS ^s my SPOUSE, and I am his.
That MUSE which i^ not dedicate to Him
"Breaks her First faith, and soiles her Bed with sin.
Astraea's Shrine.
TO those who cherish Virtue, or retain
The style of real good, or scorn to stain^
Astraea's Liv'ry; or fancy that
Which the High Court of Honor levells at,
Or to their Countries and their own behoof
Prove in the Scale Parl'amentary proof;
Who guild not P^etie with mere pretense,
Nor ^ender judgment against their conscience;
We are their Praetorian Scarlet till't wax old,
And value Justice more then Ophir-gold;
Who fear no Writs of Ease, but take delight
To do the Widow and the Orph^ right,
Or store the Almes-ba^, or provide
For such as have no Earthly He^pet beside,
Or purchase poormens pr^ers, or leave their Heirs
Seaz'd less of acres then religious cares,
Or with a pure and undefiled Zeal
Disturb not peace of Church nor Commonweal;
Or when they sit on Seats of Justice tremble,
Re^embring on those Thrones whom they resemble*
To th^se this aged Shrine we reared have,
Will be a Lamp to light them to their Grave,
From whence such precious Odours shall take breath,
As may perfume their Ashes after death.
