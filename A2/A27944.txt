Imprimatur,

Sept. 30. 1691. Ra. Barker.



LONDON, Printed for A. and I. Churchill, at the Black Swan in Paternoster-Row;
and L. Meredith, at the Star in S. Paul's Churchyard, 1694.

PSALM I.
[To the 100 Psalm Tune.]

No wicked Counsels lead aside:
Nor stands in Sinners ways; nor sits
Where God and Goodness men deride.

Is placed, his Soul's entire delight;
On these his mind is fixed by Day,
On these his wakeful thoughts by Night.

Derives his Sap and kindly Juice;
His Leaves are ever fresh and green,
His Branches timely Fruits produce.

Nor spoil the pleasures of his mind;
Whilst the ungodly are dispersed
Like Chaff, by every Stormy Wind.

And vile Hypocrisy for Grace;
Their Guilt, when judged, will find no plea,
Nor they among the Just a place.

As he approves the ways they tread;
But the smooth paths of Sinners, down
To Death and to Damnation lead.
PPALM I.
[Another Meter.]

Lewd Counsels lead aside:
Nor stands in Sinners ways, nor fits
Where Scorners God deride.

His Soul's entire delight:
On these his Mind is fixed by Day,
On these his Thoughts by Night.

Draws Sap and kindly Juice:
His Leaves are ever fresh and green,
His Boughs fair Fruits produce.

The pleasures of his Mind:
Whilst the Ungodly are like Chaff,
Dispersed by every Wind.

Hypocrisy for Grace;
Guilty, when judged, they will find no plea,
Nor with the Just a place.

Who' approves the path they tread:
But Sinners ways, though smooth, to Death
And to Damnation lead.
PSALM II.

And foolish things surmise?

Rulers his Christ despise.

His Laws they count their chain;
Freedom they will have without control,
No Bands shall them restrain.

Their vain attempts deride;

Vex their defeated Pride.

Securely on his Throne:

Proclaimed him now my Son.

Thy Scepter I Will advance
Over all the Earth, the Gentiles give
For thine Inheritance.

Their disobedient Neck;
Like brittle Potsherds, all their powers
Without resistance break.

This greater Lord revere;

And his displeasure fear.

Your Happiness does lie:
Then you are safe, when he is well pleased;
When he is provoked, ye die.
PSALM III.

And in my Troubles boast?

And my Condition lost?

And on thy power rely:
Thou shall defend me as a shield,
And lift my head on high.

And thou from Heaven did hear:

And waked without all fear.

My courage should not fail;
Though they besieged me, I should be
Secured, or else prevail.

For thou have heretofore
Turned back mine Enemies with shame,
And broken all their power.

He still will bless and save;
Then let this Author of their good,
Their cheerful praises have.
PSALM IV.

Of mine Integrity:
Thou have my former troubles eased,
Now to my prayers draw nigh.

My Government despise;
How long will ye pursue vain hopes,
And please your selves with lies?

That Is Godly, to advance:
And when I seek his aid, will send
Timely Deliverance.

Instruct and make you wise:

As the best Sacrifice.

To other succors fly;
Thou art our Hope; Lord, cast on us
A favorable Eye.

Whose Corn has wished increase;
Or when a happy Vintage makes
Their Wine overflow the press

Shall close my wearied Eyes;
No fears disturb me, whilst I know
In God my Safety lies.
PSALM V.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And sighs, that from my sorrows spring:

I spread before my God and King.

The speedy succors I expect;
But timely help will come, when I
Betimes my prayer to God direct.

By God abhor d, place their delight;
Excluded from his Favor here,

O just reward! for God to hate
Those Fools, who will not practice good:

In lies, in treachery and blood.

Within thy Courts again to appear;
Before thy Presence I Will fall down,
And worship thee with holy fear.


Wait for my fall, in false disguise,
True pleasure in my ruin have.

Let their own Counsels make 'em fall;
Crimes often repeated, and beyond
All hopes of Cure, for Vengeance call.

Triumph in his protecting care.
Thy favor, Lord, will shield from harm,
And blessings for the just prepare.
PSALM V.
[Another Meter.]

That from my sorrows spring:

To thee my God and King.

Shall hear, so I expect
Thy timely help, when I betimes
My Prayer to God direct.

Cannot be Gods delight:
These shall be'excluded from his Love,


That will not practice good:
And those destroy, who deal in lies,
In treachery and blood.

Within thy Courts to appear;
Before thy Presence I Will fall down,
And worship thee with fear.

That, like an open Grave,

Joy in my ruin have.

Devices make them fall:
Crimes multiplied and beyond hopes
Of Cure, for Vengeance call.

And in his Goodness trust:

Both crown and shield the just.
PSALM VI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

When thou with kindness do chastise;
But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear;
O Let not this against me rise.

And those perplexities I feel,

O let thy gentler touches heal.

And save my Life; for in the Grave

Thankful acknowledgments can have.

In sighs and groans; and when it is Night
I drown my Bed and self in tears:


Are dashed; for this my mournful Voice,
Will bring God nearer to mine aid,
When ye come flocking to rejoice.


Will vex themselves at their defeat,
And in Confusion turn away.
PSALM VI.
[Another Meter.]

Do kindly me chastise;
But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear;
O let it never rise.

Perplexities I feel,

Thy gentler touches heal.

My Life; for in the Grave

Can cheerful praises have.

In groans; and when it is Night,
I drown my Bed and felt in tears;


Are dashed; my mournful voice
Will bring me help from God, when ye
Come flocking to rejoice.

That gaped for a prey;

With shame shall turn away.
PSALM VII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Save me from harm, as thou art just

Will tear me, whilst no Savior's nigh.

Has such iniquity designed;

My peaceful Neighbor did requite;
If I Have not saved and set him free,
Who Is now my causeless Enemy;

My Life and Honor in the Dust.

To quell my raging Enemies:
Great Judge! Men's careless Justice here,
Calls for thy Judgments more fevere.

Till thou ascend thy Judgment Seat.

Clear then my wronged Innocence.

And settle Righteous Men in peace.
God sees our thoughts and never can
Be bribed to favor unjust Man.
Part II.

And will be my Deliverer.

Against wicked men, who break his Laws:
Whose Punishment though he delay,
He Is angry with them every day.

To their return, his Sword he will whet.
After fair warnings to repent,
God's Bow's for Execution bent.

Deadly to them that persecute.

Against a Life, will ruin thine:

When sure thy self to fall in it.

To break my head, may crush thine own;
And violent dealing prove, when bent
To others harm, thy punishment.

Thy Faithfulness does brightly shine:
And as thy Name on high they raise,
Shall be the Subject of my praise.
PSALM VII.
[Another Meter.]

Save me as thou art just.

A Lion's rage will tear.

Such wickedness designed;

My Neighbor did requite;
If I Have not saved and set him free
Who' is now mine Enemy:

Mine honor in the Dust.

To quell mine Enemies.
Great Judge! men's careless Justice here,
Calls for thine more severe.

Till this judge takes his Seat.

Clear then mine Innocence.

Settle just men in peace.
God sees our thoughts, and never can
Favor unrighteous man.
Part II.

And will deliver me:

Against those who break his Laws.
Whose punishment though he delay,
He Is angry every Day.

His Sword he whets to kill.
After fair warnings to repent,
His Bow lies ready bent:

Against them that persecute.

'Twill only ruin thine:

When sure to fall in it.

May crush thine own instead:
And violent dealing prove, when bent
TO hurt me, thy punishment.

Thy Truth does brightly shine:
And as thy Name on high they raise,
Promote my Songs of Praise.
PSALM VIII.

Its Greatness, Lord, declare:
Heaven's Luster, by thy Glory, is
Out-shin'd in brightness far.

Thy Victories arise;
They still the Triumphs of thy Foes,
And shame thine Enemies.

Raise mine admiring Eye;
And there behold the Moon and Stars
That beautify the Sky.

In thy kind thoughts a place?
Why do thou thus advance and bless
His miserable Race?

He wears a glorious Crown:

And him their Sovereign own.

Or in the Deserts lie;

Or Fowls beneath the Sky:

Disown God's Government;
Whose Power does Rule the World, whose Name
Alone is Excellent.
PSALM IX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And all his mighty works proclaim:

Whilst I sing praises to his Name.

And sought their Safety in their flight?
When they saw God stand on our Side,
They wounded fell, and perished quite.

That daring Foe who God defied,
He then maintained my Cause, and gave
An open Judgment on my Side.

When their tall Champion fell with shame;
Thou'st put an everlasting blot
Of Infamy upon their Name.

Our Countries Desolation;
What Cities thou will waste, and lay
In ruined heaps; these hopes are gone.

Has placed his Throne in glorious Light:

His Sentence will be just and right.

He Will be their refuge in distress:

His Prayer never wanted good Success.
Part II.

Who dwells in Sion, and proclaim
What wonders he for us has done,
That all may know and fear his Name.

The Meek, and slay the Innocent:
Whose cries will quicken the approach
Of their delayed punishment.

God's merciful regard I crave;
Who often has saved me when I stepped
Upon the Threshold of the Grave.
Sions Assemblies then shall hear
The Songs of my Deliverance;
And in the Triumphs of my Joy,
Thy power that saved me I Will advance.

These God-less Sinners true shall find,
By the Arts for others ruin used,
They their own Safety undermined.

Declares his Righteousness to all:
They who lay Trains to hurt the good,
Set Traps to occasion their own fall.

Who God and Justice disregard:

Obtains sure rescue and reward.

To blast the wicked's good Success;

They are but Men, and so Confess.
PSALM X.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And hide thy self in our distress?

And insolence the poor oppress?

They boast so much, prove their own fall;
Who count the Men of Violence
Happy, though God abhorrs them all.

Whether there be a God or no;
But carelessly concludes there is none,
Or that he cares not what men do.

God's Judgments make him not forbear;
All Men he sets at naught, and looks
On all his Foes below his fear.

Shall ever happen in his State,
Nothing disturb his quiet rest,
Nor any trouble be his fate.

He curses when he means to cheat:
And hides the mischief he designs
By Oaths of falsehood and deceit.

Travelers pass without defense:
Unseen he spies and murders those
Whose only Arms are Innocence.

He waits, as cruel to devour;
As Birds are drawn into the Net,
He gets the poor into his power.
Part II.

By putting on a humble guise;
The poor man he intends to seize,
To his assaults more open lies.

For ruin, are by God forgot,
Or shall not be relieved by
His Power, because he sees them not.

And all these Blasphemies confute;
Thus by thine help the poor will know,
That God does hear their humble Suit.

And God with so much scorn contemn?
And why, because forborne, conclude
That God will never punish them?

And wilt their spiteful rage requite:
The poor that has no Friend, commits
Himself to thee, to do him right.

Who strive injustice to maintain;
Search and avenge their wickedness,
Till naught that can do harm remain.

Whose Kingdom shall for ever stand;
Whose power has heretofore expel d
The Heathen Nations from this Land.

When they to thee have made complaint;
Thou will dispose their hearts to wait
Meekly on thee, and Audience grant.

And from their proud Oppressors free;
That Tyrants, sprung out of the Earth,
Their Terror may no longer be.
PSALM XI.

By those discouraged be,
Who bid me, like a frighted Bird,
Unto the Mountains flee.

Have ready bent their Bow;

What can the Righteous do?

Heaven is his glorious Throne,
From whence he views the Sons of Men,
And judges every one.

He does their works approve:
Such as are wicked and unjust,
His Soul can never Love.

This mixture is made up,
Fire, brimstone, and tempestuous storms,
The Portion of their Cup.

In righteousness delight:
And still will favor and protect
The Man that is upright.
PSALM XII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Goodness from Earth will fly away;
And Faithful Men will hardly find
A place, if thou much longer stay.

They Are counted wise that act a part:
Who though their words are smooth and fair,
Intend no kindness in their heart.

And their deceitful Arts will shame;
Whose pride no vengeance fears from God,
And count Religion but a Name.

By fraud and falsehood they supply;
And plead for their injurious tongues
An uncontrolled Liberty.

And groans of such as are oppressed;
At length will vindicate their cause,
And raise his power to give them rest.

His faithfulness has often been tried;
Refined Silver's not so free
From dross, though seven times purified.

Thou, Lord, shall keep the Just from harm;

The wicked every where will swarm.
PSALM XII.
[Another Metre]

Goodness will fly away;
And faithful men will find no place,
If thou much longer stay.
Dissimulation credit gains,
They Are wise that act a part;
Who though their words are smooth, intend
No kindness in their heart.

And their vile Arts will shame;
Who fear not God's Revenge, and count
Religion but a Name.

By falsehood they supply;
And plead for their injurious tongues
Unbounded Liberty.

Of such as are oppressed:
Will vindicate their cause, and raise
His power to give them rest.

His Truth has often been tried:
Silver is not so free from dross,
Though Seven times purified.

To keep the Just from harm:

On every Side will swarm.
(...) PSALM XIV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Who minds the Affairs of men below;
For though they speak it not aloud,
They live as if they thought it so.
Their Principles are all corrupt,
Hateful and vile their actions are:
They Are only skillful to do ill,
But from all good estranged far.

Looked down and took a strict Survey,
What Men did seek and know the Lord,
And did his just Commands obey.

With loathsome wickedness o'ergrown;
None truly pious were, and just,
Or practiced goodness, no not one.

Like Bread thy People thus devour;
Yet neither own thee by their prayers,
Nor dread the Vengeance of thy Power.

Terrors shall seize them unawares,
When God appears to help the Just,
And punishment for these prepares.


Salvation to his people, then
You shall be sad, and they shall sing.
PSALM XIV.
[Another Meter.]

Does mind the affairs below;
For though they speak it not aloud,
They live as if 'twere so.
Their Principles are all corrupt
Their actions hateful are:
They Are skillful only to do ill,
From good estranged far.

And took a strict Survey,
What men did seek and know the Lord,
And his just Laws obey.

With loathsome sins o'ergrown;
What was Religious, just and good,
None practiced, no not one.

Like Bread the poor devour;
Yet neither own thee by their prayers,
Nor dread thy mighty power.

Shall seize them unawares:
When God does help the just, for these
Due Vengeance he prepares.

But when his Power shall bring
Salvation to his people, then
You Will sigh, and they shall sing.
PSALM XV.

Whom thou so well do Love:
That he may praise thee here below,
And dwell with thee above.

Whose works are right and just;
Whose heart and words are true, and whom
One may securely trust.

By a detracting Tongue:
Nor in his Infamy delights;
Much less would do him wrong.

His virtuous Soul does loath;
But shows, to such as fear the Lord,
Kindness and Honor both.
Who does not break his Oath, when he
To his own damage swears;
But his strict Virtue far before
His Interest preferrs.

Bribes to betray the Just:
This man shall never be moved, but may
In God securely trust.
PSALM XVI.

Who trust in thee alone:

Knows thus I Have always done.
Not that my Goodness can deserve,
Much less thy Love requite:

Who are my Soul's delight.
These, who in Virtue do excel,
In all my goods shall share:

Who fond of Idols are.
By bloody offerings to false Gods
My hands I Will not defile;
I hate to mention, more to swear
By Names that are so vile.

From his rich Mercy flows;
And his good providence secures
The Blessings he bestows.

Nor pine to see his Store;
With what I have I Am pleased much,
With what I hope for, more.

Troubles mine Exercise;
Those sad and solitary thoughts
Instruct and make me wise.

My fears are over-blown;
When he stands by me with his Aid,
No power shall cast me down.

In him my Flesh shall trust:

Nor Body in the Dust.

And in thy Presence taste
Pleasures to full Perfection grown,
And Joys that ever last.
PSALM XVII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Hear, O thou righteous Judge, my cry;
And let my Prayer thy Audience gain,
That goes not out of Lips that feign.

Who know the right of every case.

And, when retired, what I design.
Like Gold, when in the furnace tried,
In me thou'st no base Mixture spied;
And my firm purpose still shall be,
To make my words and thoughts agree.

By common practice or the worse;
Thy word restrains me from defense
Procured by Acts of Violence.

Those safe and blessed paths of thine.

To right my cause, to him I cry.

Preserving me when danger's near:
Whose power is wont to interpose,
To save the Righteous from their foes.
Part II.

To the apple of our Eye we bear:
Afford such safety to the good,
As the Hen's wings do to her brood.

From wicked men who me oppress:
From foes for cruelty renowned,
Who to destroy beset me round.

Their Mouths in boasting open wide:

With poring Looks our ruin wait.

Nor young ones closer lurk than they.

Them down, who to my ruin haste.
The wicked's sword may wound me sore,
But save me from its killing power.

If God give leave, to do all ill.
Whose minds the World does so bewitch,
Their only care is to be rich,
And leave to their Posterity
The unspent remainder, when they die.

Thy present favor gives content;
Who shall all Satisfaction gain,
When I awake with thee to reign.
PSALM XVIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

To whom my Safety, Lord, I owe.

I for Security resort:
He saves me from mine Enemies;
On God, my Strength, my hope relies:
No Buckler can defend so well,
Nor horn assailing force repel.
A Tower so high, no Violence
Can reach me there, or force me thence.

So shall my Foes triumph no more.


When a mad rout swelled like a Flood,
And seemed too great to be withstood:

God's pity, being heard above:

Declared his wrath against my foes.
This made the very Earth to quake,
And the hills from their foundations shake,

Whence burning coals among them came.

Under his feet thick clouds were thrown.

Winds joined their wings more swift to pass.

With watery vapors and thick clouds:

Then Coals of fire and hailstones fall.
Part II.

Hailstones and flames broke from the cloud:

These Darts dispersed them all abashed.

One to the Abyss below might peep.
All this was at that wrathful blast,
Which, breathing flames, his Nostrils cast.

Like drowning waves, he drew me out.

From foes, whose strength did mine surpass.

Had not the Lord, my prop and stay,

Restored, because he loved me.

And mine Integrity reward;

Nor wickedly my God forsook.

Nor, as I pleased, were laid aside:

Than mine Integrity to lose.
I felt the injustice of their hate,
Whose wrongs I would not imitate:
Their sins when I could not prevent;
I kept my self still innocent.

I Will bear't, since God accounts me clean:
It Is he my Righteous Cause regards,
And mine Integrity rewards.
Part III.

Who have been merciful and kind.

Jistice and Faithfulness secure.
Him that to crooked ways inclines
He Will cross, and ruin his designs.

The afflicted, and the proud bring down.

Turns my dark state to joy and Light.

By him I scale their highest walls.

His word so tried, none need distrust:
He as a shield will those defend,
Who with firm faith on him depend.

Or Rock for safety, is like ours?

And clears my way to Victory.

Over high and cragged hills I chase.

And strength to break the strongest bows.

He interposed his saving shield:
His hand upheld me, and I grew
Great and victorious with a few.

And suffered not my feet to slide.

I chased, till I destroyed them quite.

And could renew the fight no more:
The proud that bore their head so high,
Now at my feet all prostrate lie.
Part IV.

Both for my Courage and Success:

Submit their necks, to save or kill.

Men could not help, God would not hear.

They fled, like dirt I trod them down.

In me they all unite in peace:
Even Heathens own me for their King,
And unknown Nations tribute, bring.

Such terror strikes, as makes 'em tame:
They feign old grudges to forget,
Offer their service and submit.

Their courage daunted and dismayed,
Forth from their holds and holes they creep,
To yield up what they dare not keep.

My Succors and Salvation come.

And Nations to my Rule subdues.

And made me to a Throne arise;
Was my Deliverer and Defense,
From the known Man of Violence.


And the same Mercies he has known,
Shall to his seed be ever shown.
PSALM XIX.

God's Skill and Power proclaim:

The Night, declare the same.

Nor words to them belong:

Thy praise, without a Tongue.

No Bridegroom shows his face
So cheerful, and no Champion runs
With so much strength his Race.

His Course unto the West:
All the Earth rejoices in his Light,
And by his Heat is blessed.

Our Errors this descries,
Sinners to goodness this converts,
And makes the simple wise.

His Just Commands accord:
Their Joys are pure, and to the Soul
Both Food and Light afford.
Part II.

And keep them pure and bright:
Thy Judgments are exactly true,
And altogether right.

With finest Gold are filled:
Sweeter than Honey, and the drops
From Honey-combs distilled.

My prosperous State I own;
And in observing these shall gain
Rewards that are unknown.

What Man can call to mind?
Lord, let those faults thy pity move,
And easy pardon find.

Enslave my Soul to sin:
So shall I blameless Innocence
Maintain, and peace within.

A pleasing Sacrifice
To thee, my God, in whom my strength,
And my Salvation lies.
PSALM XX.
[As the 113 Psalm.]

When Danger or Distress is near,
His mighty Power be thy defense.

In Sion, with his presence graced,
Support and send thee help from thence.


Thy great Designs all prosper still.

Thy Triumphs spread in Songs of Praise,
When he shall thy requests fulfill.

Thine aids his Conquests will secure,
When thy right hand shall interpose:

The Strength or Numbers of their Horse,
We set thy Name against our Foes.

They and their horses tumble down,
And on their fall our Conquests rise.

And no less in distresses may
God hear his Prayer, than he our cries.
PSALM XXI.

With thy Salvation blessed!

And granted his Request.

A splendid Crown he wears:

TO innumerable Years.

With Majesty arrayed.

And in thy favor glad.

Whose grace will make him stand:

The Terror of thy hand.



But could not bring about.

Thy killing Arrows aim:

Will sing and praise thy Name.
PSALM XXII.

From me oppressed with grief?
Why, after loudest Cries to thee,
So far from my relief?

My Cries to thee can tell:

The Praise of Israel.

When they on thee relied:

Nor fervent Prayers denied.

Not like a Man, I Am used;

By vilest Men abused.

"That God would now appear:
"Let him deliver him, and show
"That he to God is dear.

At first I was released;
I was thy Charge, when yet I hung
Upon my Mother's Breast.

Entirely on thy Care;
And of thy Loving kindness had,
Lord, an unusual Share.

In this distress appear:
O do not thou withdraw thy self,
When trouble is so near,

Armed with rage and power:

Or readier to devour.
Part II.

From one another start:
As wax before the fire dissolves,
So fails my fainting heart.

My tongue scarce strength I have
To tell my griefs; I seem like one
Just fitted for a Grave.

Round to enclose me meet;
And with inhumane Cruelty
Have pierced my Hands and Feet.

May all be told with ease:
This moves no pity; but their Eyes
With this sad sight they please.

Upon my Vesture cast:

And to my Succor haste.

Their Malice else employs;





Of Savage beasts, destroys.

The greatness of thy Name;
And in the Assemblies of thy Saints,
Thy Goodness thus proclaim.
Jacob's Seed,
"And Servants of the Lord;
"Let him be glorified and praised,
"And with due fear adored.

"Th afflicted's Miseries;
"Nor in displeasure hid his Face,
"But always heard their Cries.
Part III.

Shall in thy Church be paid;
Before thy Saints those Vows performed
That in distress I made.

Thy Goodness shall supply:
Thou shall revive their fainting hopes
Who on thy Strength rely.

Shall turn unto the Lord;
By all the Kindreds of the Earth
His Name shall be adored.

Princes their Scepters sway;
All Nations to his Rule submit,
And Homage to him pay.

That wallow in the Dust;
Both shall adore, and thee alone
Their great Preserver trust.

His Righteousness declare:

How great his Mercies are.
PSLAM XXIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

That all my wants be still supplied;
I shall not be exposed to wrong,
Nor left to stray without a Guide.

Where I have Ease and sweet Repast:
The Streams are cool and quiet, where
I quench my thirst, and please my taste.

Life's tedious Journey pleasant make:
And in the Peaceful ways of Grace
He leads me, for his Goodness sake.

And Sorrow cast a dismal Shade;
Thy Power and thy tender Care
Would chase my Fears, and make me glad.

Behold thy Bounty, and repine
To see rich Oils anoint my Head,
To see my Cup overflow with Wine,

Shall still surround me all my Days:
I will frequent thy House, and there
Display thy Love, and sing thy praise.
PSALM XXIII.
[Another Meter.]

I to his Flock belong:
I shall not stray without a Guide,
Nor be exposed to wrong.

Where I have food and Ease;
He leads me to the quiet stream,
Where I my thirst appease.

Life's Journey pleasant make;
He guides me in his righteous Paths,
For his own Goodness sake.

Reflects a dismal Shade,
Thy Rod and Staff would chafe away
My fears, and make me glad.

My Table, who repine
To see rich Oils anoint my Head,
My Cup overflow with Wine.

Shall crown my future days;
I will frequent his House, to show
His Love, and sing his Praise.
PSALM XXIV.

All creatures it contains:
His gracious Care to all the World
Extends, over which he reigns.

The Earth's great Fabric lay:
And on the unstable Floods, he made
Her fixed Foundation stay.

Who shall admitted be?
Lord, who within thy Holy Place
May stand and worship thee?

Whose heart no stains defile;
Whose Tongue blasphemes not God, nor swears
His Neighbor to beguile.

Whom God delights to bless;
On whom he will faithfully bestow
His promised Happiness.

Of Favor, seek his Face;
And as true Proselytes be joined
To Jacob's faithful Race.

Be open and make room:
Lift up your Heads, and you shall see
The King of Glory come.

That Is with such Glory crowned?
It is the mighty Lord, in Fight
For Victcories renowned.

Be open and make room.
List up your heads, and you shall see
The King of Glory come.

Whose Glories so excel?
God, who commands the Heavenly Hosts
Comes now with us to dwell.
PSALM XXV.

In him my trust repose;

Or triumph to my Foes.

Their Souls, who wait on thee.
Let Disappointments shame their hopes
That deal perfidiously.

Mine Eyes in clearer Light;
And teach me always to perform
What Is pleasing in thy Sight.

Never let me go astray:
On thee, my Savior, I wait
To teach and guide my way.

Thou did of Old express;
How thou have graciously relieved
Thy Servants in distress.

No strict Inquiry make:
Those early faults, O Lord, forgive
For thine own Goodness sake.
Part II.

Will erring Souls instruct;
Their wandering Steps, to the safe paths
Of Virtue will conduct.

And teach the Meek his way:

As his just Laws obey.

For Mercy I entreat:
Pardon my sins, O Lord, that are
Both numerous and great.

That fears the Lord above?
He Will ever lead him in the ways
That he himself does Love.

His Soul shall dwell at ease;
His Seed shall after him enjoy
Prosperity and Peace.

His Secret's understood:
How he, by a sure Covenant, stands
Engaged to do them good.
Part III.

Mine Eyes are toward thee;
I hope thy Goodness at the last
From all will set me free.

To me, and Mercy show;
Great are the afflictions I endure,
And find no help below.

Lord, send me quick relief;

And then remove my grief

In number still increase;
How they with causeless hatred seck
The Ruin of my Peace.

From shame as well as guilt;
O never disappoint the hopes
That I on thee have built.

Find sure supports from thee:

From all their troubles free.
PSALM XXVI.

My Soul's Integrity:
Nothing shall shake my Confidence
Whilst I on thee rely.

To thine impartial Eye;
O try my heart, lest any Sin
Should there concealed lie.

Gives me the bevt delight:
This both engages and excites
My care to walk aright.

My free converse denied;
To those, who under specious shows
Designed Mischiefs hide.

Which evil things contrive:
My presence to their lewd consults
No countenance shall give.

Free from Impurity;
And then the Oblations I present,
Shall acceptable be.

Thy Goodness will proclaim;
And tell of all thy wondrous works,
To magnify thy Name.
Part II.

Thy presence do afford;
And where thy Glory brightly shines,
To bless and praise the Lord.

And bloody Crimes I hate;
Let me not in their sufferings share,
kNor perish by their Fate.

That serves their vile intent;
Justice by Brib'ry they will pervert,
TO undo the Innocent.

God and my self to enjoy;
In Mercy save my Life, which they
Would cruelly destroy.

And, Lord, I hope to appear
In the Assemblies of thy Saints,
To bless and praise thee there.
PSALM XXVII.

Why should I be dismayed?
It Is he defends my Life, of whom
Then need I be afraid?

And to devour me gaped;
They stumbled ere they seized their prey,
They fell, and I escaped.

Encamped against me lie;
Nor, if by open force assailed,
Despair of Victory.

I shall not be denied;
TO attend his Service in his House,
And ever there abide.
Frequent converses with him there
Fresh pleasures will create;
To have my doubts resolved, I Will there
For his Directions wait.

Could me so surely hide;
Nor in a Fortress on a Rock
Could I more safe abide.

Above my foes shall raise
Offerings of Joy I Will thither bring,
And there will sing thy praise.
Part II.

An Answer full of Grace;

Resolve to seek thy Face.

Thy Face, nor me reject:
Those Succors I have had before,
From thee I still expect.

As thine, nor Care so large:
When they forsake me, I become
Still more thy Care and Charge.

Where I may safely tread;
Avoiding all the cunning Snares
Mines enemies have laid.

My Name with Slanders blast;
And all the Cruelty they breath
Will execute at last.

With troubles was oppressed,
Had I not hoped thy Mercy would
Secure my Peace and Rest.

Courage and Strength derive;
Though he delay, he will at length
Thy fainting heart revive.
PSALM XXVIII.

When I thy Succor crave;
Else I shall be like them that lie
Neglected in the Grave.

Thy favor I entreat;
And spread out my imploring hands
Toward thy Mercy-seat.

That waits those Sinners end,
Who whilst all Mischiefs they contrive,
Speak like the kindest Friend.

Since to others they designed
Ruin; it is but just that such
Should their own ruin find.

Before their eyes in vain:
His last shall be their overthrow,
Never to rise again.

That in distress I made:

His seasonable aid.
Thy favor, Lord, has made my heart
Exceedingly rejoice:
In grateful Hymns I will advance
Thy praise with cheerful voice,

God will protect and own;
And his Anointed save, whom he.
Has raised to his Throne.

Do all their Safety owe;
Feed thou thy Flock, and raise them up,
When they are fallen low.
PSALM XXIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Ye Rulers of the World proclaim:

The Honor due unto his Name.

Through all the Regions of the Sky;
The Seas are frighted with the noise,


And break before the mighty Sound:

And like a frighted Calf rebound.

Of pointed Lightnings tear the air:
wild Inhabitants,
Think they are not safe, but quake for fear.

Wild Beasts the naked coverts leave;
But in his sacred Temple all
Fearless to God their praises give.

To Clouds above and Floods below:

Will rest and peace on His bestow.
PSALM XXIX.
[Another Meter.]

God's glorious Reign proclaim:

Due Honor to his Name.

The Regions of the Sky:
The Seas start at the Noise, so full


Before the Mighty Sound:

A frighted Calf rebound.

Of Lightning tear the air:
wild Inhabitants
Quake, as not safe, for fear.

The naked Coverts leave:
But in God's Temple, fearless all
To him their praises give.

Above, and Floods below:
This great Protector of the good,
Will Peace on his bestow,
PSALM XXX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Thee I Will extol with thankful Voice;
Who have secured me from those harms,
That would have made my foes rejoice,

To thee I cried, and thou did save:

My Life did rescue from the Giave.

Proclaim the praises of the Lord;
His Goodness often call to mind,
And his Fidelity record.

Which is our Life, does longer stay:
Grief may continue for a Night,
But comfort rises with the Day.

I never shall be disturbed more:

My Mountain made so strong before.
For when thy presence was withdrawn,
New troubles did my State invade:

Thus my address to God I made.

"To see meruin'd? can the Grave
"Declare thy Truth? from silent Dust
"What praising Songs, Lord, can thou have?

"Compassion on my sad Estate;
"Help me and my lost happiness
"Restore, before it be too late.

My sackcloth now is thrown away?
And gladness girds me, who before,
In black despair and horror lay,

But to the Lord due Glory give;
And strive, that in thy thankful Verse,
His Fame eternally may live.
PSALM XXX.
[Another Metre]

My God with thankful Voice;
Who freed me from those harms, that would
Have made my foes rejoice.

I cried, and thou did save;

Did rescue from the Grave.

The Praises of the Lord;
His Goodness call to mind, and his
Fidelity record.

Our Life, does longer stay:
Weeping may for a Night endure,
But Joy comes with the Day.

I shall be moved no more:

My Mount so strong before.
For when thy presence was withdrawn,
Troubles did me invade:

Thus my address I made.

"Me ruined? can the Grave
"Declare thy Truth? Lord, from the Dust
"What praises can thou have?

"Pity on my sad State;
"Help me, and my lost happiness
"Restore, ere't be too late.

My sackcloth's thrown away;
Gladness surrounds me, who before
In dismal Sorrows lay.

To God due praises give;
That in thy thankful Verse, his Fame
Eternally may live.
PSALM XXXI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

The trust that in my God I place:
May all in my Deliverance see
Thy Mercy and Fidelity.

Comes all my safety and defense.

I to thy Custody resort.

My treacherous Enemies have set.

Who have so often redeemed it.

Nor ask the Stars what I must shun;
(All Heathen Cheats to be abhorred)
My trust's entirely in the Lord.

Who in Straits such Care of me has had:

He made a way my foes t'escape.

Into new Difficulties thrown:
Who lie dispirited and faint,
Pined with grief, and pinched with want.

Too weak to hold, if God contend.

My Friends all shun me out of Fear.
Part II.

Who in the Grave neglected lie:
As pieces of a broken Pot
Are thrown away, so I Am forgot.

Show the designs I ought to dread:
For when Rebellion is my guilt,
It Is time, say they, my Blood werespilt.

My Trust, and Judge of my'Innocence,

A Life, which sorely they annoy.
Rescue it still, O Lord, from those.
My cruel persecuting Foes.

In Mercy save me, who am thine.

My hopes, who call upon thy Name:
But let the wicked's death prevent
Their troubling of the Innocent.

Who openly defame the Just:
Whom they with highest crimes traduce,
And all they plead with scorn abuse.
Part III.

For those that fear and trust in thee;
Whose Goodness, now so little known,
Before all the World the Lord will own.

Themselves from persecuting Pride:
God's favor makes this dark retreat,
A Lightsome, safe and quiet seat.

In a strong City compassed round,
I lay enclosed as in a Trap,
Yet he made way for my escape.

I Am lost, without all hope t'evade;
My humble prayer again he heard,
And rescued me from what I feared.

The Faithful still preserved are:
And when the proud insult the most,
God's wrath will plague them, to their cost.

So far, to make your Courage fail:
Firmly to God if you adhere,
He Will strengthen you to persevere.
PSALM XXXII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And hides what he has done amiss;

Whose heart sincere and upright is.

My Guilt; no quiet I could get:

And scorched me like the Summers heat.

My crimes, and open all my wound;
I humbly did confess my Sins
To thee, and easy pardon found.

In Season to implore thine aid;
Then though their troubles like a Flood
Should rise, they need not be afraid.

To thee I Will fly in all distress;
Thou will preserve me; and in Songs
Of Victory I Will thee confess.


Whose Fury, till they are broke or tamed,
No Rein can guide, no Curb can rule.


The happy men: then let the Just
Rejoice and triumph in his Love.
PSALM XXXII.
[Another Meter.]

And hides what is done amiss:

Sincere and upright is.

No quiet I could get:

Scorched me like Summer's heat.

My crimes, and ope'my wound;
I humbly did confess my sins,
And easy pardon found.

Good men t'implore thy aid:
Then though the floods of trouble rise,
They need not be afraid.

I Will fly in all distress;
Thou will preserve me; and my Songs
Thy Mercies shall confess.

Be like the Horse and Mule;

Can guide, no Curb can rule.

That trust in God, shall prove

And triumph in his Love.
PSALM XXXIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And let his Praise be your delight;
For Praise is Lovely and becomes
The Lips of those that are upright.

T'express and to excite your Joys:

With skill, and with a cheerful noise.

His Laws from all injustice free;
His Promise sure, and all his works
Are done in Truth and Equity.

His favor, and his Pleasure are;
The Earth with various Blessings filled,
To us his Goodness does declare.

By his commanding word were made,
And all its numerous Host, from his
Creating breath their Beings had.

To which they are confined, keep:
Whose Waters safely are laid up
In the great Storehouse of the Deep.

Let fear and due regard be shown;
May all the World his awful Power,
By humble Adorations own.

All fixed as he Commandment gave:

Without him no Success shall have.

Nor can his orders countermand;
But every Age, what he resolves,
Will seeimmovably shall stand.
Part II.

That God its chosen Ruler is;
And happy they! whom God declares
By's special favor to be His.

Looks down from his Celestial Throne.

Views from his glorious Mansion.

Their hearts he fashioned one by one;
And all their inmost thoughts, to him
Better than to themselves are known.

Nor Strength a Mighty Man secure:

The Riders preservation sure.

Looks with a favorable Eye;
He never will fail their hopes, that on
His Goodness steadfastly rely.

Their Lives he will rescue from the Grave:
In time of Famine, due Supplies
All their Necessities shall have.

Our Succor, and our sure defense:

In thee with cheerful confidence.

Descend, like a refreshing shower,
As all our hope and joys depend,
Upon thy Favor and thy Power.
PSALM XXXIII.
[Another Meter.]

And praise him with delight:
For thankfulness becomes the Lips
Of those that are upright.

T'excite and tell your Joys:

And with a cheerful noise.

Are from injustice free:
His promise sure; and all his ways
Are truth and Equity.

As they his pleasure are:
The Earth with Blessings filled, to us
His Goodness does declare.

Commanding word were made;
And from his breath its numerous Hosts
Their several beings had.

Confined Limits keep;
Whose waters are laid up within
The Storehouse of the Deep.

Let due regard be shown:
May all the world his awful Power
By humble worship own.

All fixed by Laws he gave.

Though deep, success shall have.

Nor Orders countermand:
But every Age, what he resolves,
Will see shall firmly stand.
Part II.

Its chosen Ruler is:
And happy they! whom God declares
By's Care, that they are His.

From his Celestial Throne:

From his bright Mansion.

He fashioned one by one.
More clearly all their thoughts to him,
Than to themselves are known.

A mighty Man secure:

The Riders safety sure.

Looks with a gracious Eye:
And never will their hopes, that on
His Goodness do rely.

He Will rescue from the Grave
Their Lives, in time of dearth their needs
All due Supplies shall have.

Our help and our defense.

With cheerful Confidence.
Lord, let thy Grace on us descend
Like a refreshing Shower;
For all our hope and joys depend
On thine Almighty Power.
PSALM XXXIV.

I will at all times bless;
My tongue shall daily be employed,
His Goodness to confess.

Shall hear it and rejoice;

Join both in heart and voice.

And graciously he heard;
His timely succors did prevent
The threatening Harm I feared.

To him and be relieved;
Nor in their hopes they place in God,
Shall ever be deceiv^d.

Of help, God's succors craved;
He heard my Cry, and out of all
My troubles I was saved

Yet wait t'encompass such
As fear him; to preserve them safe,
When dangers near approach.

And then you must confess,
That God alone is Good, and them
That trust in him will bless.

You in good ways abide;
He Will see, in all year wants, you be
With needful things supplied.

For lack of prey may faint;
But those that wait on God shall have
All good he knows they want.
Part II.

And with attention hear;
I Will give you wise Instructions,
How ye the Lord should fear.

And happy days would see?

Deceit and Injury.

From doing good never cease;
Seek all men's quiet, and pursue
The things that make for peace.

He casts a gracious Eye;
His Ear's attentive to their suits,
And open to their Cry.

Whom wicked Works employ;
In his fierce wrath, them and their Race
He Will utterly destroy.

God's help in Straits they have:

And contrite Spirits save.

At length God sets them free:

No Bone shall broken be.

With all that hate the Just:
Whom God will keep, and never fail
Their hopes that on him trust.
PPALM XXXV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And take my part against my foes,

Against their fierce Assaults to oppose.

Draw out thy spear and stop their way;
And that my Courage may not fail,
I Will be thy sure Deliverer, say.

My ruin, all their hopes defeat:
Their warlike preparations turn
TO a shameful and confused retreat.

Dispersed, like Chaff before the Wind:

But a steep precipice they will find.

And hunt me like some savage Beast;
Would treach'rously destroy my life,
Who have not injured them the least.

(A fit reward for such a Foe)
And caught in his own wiles, himself
Suffer the same he thought to do.

My Joys to the highest pitch shall raise:

And all shall triumph in thy praise.
Thy Mercy I Will aloud proclaim,
Thy Power to be beyond compare:
Who sav'st the poor from violence,
And wrongs of those that stronger are.
Part II.

Things that never came into my mind:

To whom I had before been kind.

My clothing spoke that I was sad;
My fasts and Prayers repeated, showed
If they did well, I should be glad.

Seemed not to be a sadder cross;
Nor had my looks been more cast down,
Had I bewail d a Mother's loss.

Together to rejoice they flock;
The vilest abjects meet, and make
My Miseries their Laughing Stock.

Of Trencher-Flatterers at Feasts;
Whose Rage could eat me up, and there
Fall on me with abusive jests.

Rescue me from their unjust power;
Who, when destroyed in Goods and Name,
My Life, like Lions would devour.

And when I Have Liberty to go
Into the Assemblies of thy Saints,
All shall thy power and Goodness know.

Rejoice, that they the Day have won;
Nor show by winking signs, their rage
Is satisfied, and I Am undone.
Part III.

By devised falsehoods to increase
Hatred to those, who fain would live
Under the Government in peace.

And a false Traitor boldly call:
To all they meet rejoicing say,
So, so, we have now discovered all.

And how I Am wronged: do not neglect

And me without delay protect.

To thy known Justice I appeal:
According as thou find'st, with me,
Not as they falsely charge me, deal.

Applaud, themselves and prouder grow
To see me ruined: Ah, they will cry,
Now things, as we would have them, go.

And longing wait to see me lost;
Blush at their disappointed hopes,
Hang down their heads, and no more boast.

Triumph for joy and loudly sing,
Blessed be God who David saved,
And made him a Victorious King.

Thy Truth and Goodness to proclaim;
And whilst I live shall never fail,
To bless and praise thy Holy Name.
PSALM XXXVI.

All righteous Laws despise;
I must conclude there is no fear
Of God before his Eyes.

May be concealed a while;
He Will, when his Sin's found out, appear
Hateful to all, and vile.

To cover ill designs;
He will not know what is just, much less
To practice good inclines.

His sleep he will break for this;
So set on Evil, none that serves
His Ends can come amiss.

Thy Mercy, Lord, extends:
Thy Faithfulness the narrow bounds
Of space and time transcends.

Thy Truth shall fail the least;
Thy Judgments none can fathom; thou
Preservest Man and Beast.
Part II.

Thou bear to the Just;
Under whose Providence and Care
Good Men securely trust.

For all Supplies shall look;
And freely of thy Pleasures drink
As from a running Brook.

Derived are from thee;
From thy continued favor flows
All our Felicity.

Thy kindness still impart;
And all thy promises fulfill
To men of upright heart.

Is equal to his hate;
Nor let the wicked's power combined
Subvert my quiet State.

Against me ruined lies:
By such a powerful hand cast down,
They never more shall rise.
PSALM XXXVII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

The wicked's prosperous estate;
Nor, tempted by their good Success,
Grow bold their Crimes to imitate.

Before the Mower cuts it down;
And beauteous Flowers, within a while
Are withered by the scorching Sun.

And on God's Goodness does rely:

And all thy just desires supply.

In firm dependence on him live;
He Will either grant what thou would have,
Or what he knows is better give.

Like Clouds, thy righteousness obscure
He Will clear thy Innocence, the Light
At noon shall not appear more pure.

God's Mercies; but by no means fret,
To see men thrive by wicked Arts,
And what they have a mind to get.

Suppress it, when it first begins;
Lest it boil up to wrath, and thou
Be hurried to commit their Sins.

The good things of his promised land;
But evil doers have their doom,
To be cut off by God's just hand.
Part II.

Thou Wilt see; and if the place thou mind
Where once thou saw him flourishing,
Nothing remaining of him find.

Possess the Land; and with increase
Of all good things their lives be blessed,
And nothing shall disturb their peace.

Enraged against the just, combines:

Derides both him and his designs.

The poor and harmless innocent:

And serve for his own Punishment.

That little which contents the poor,
Is better far than wicked men's
Ill-got or ill-imployed Store.

God will in pieces surely break;
But good men, by his potent Arm,
Shall be upheld, though never so weak.

And patient waiting, God regards;
And with his promised happiness,
Them, and their children he rewards.

That all their hopes on God relied:
In days of Famine, by his care,
They shall be sure to be supplied.
Part III.

Shall perish by his angry Stroke;
Like fat of Lambs on the Altar laid,
Consume and vanish into smoke.

Never intending to restore:
The Righteous man as freely lends
And parts with Wealth, to help the poor.

By them and theirs shall be enjoyed;
The other, followed with God's Curse,
Be rooted out and quite destroyed.

And he delights in his way:

God's power is his Support and Stay.

That Liberal Man I never could see,
Whose Alms exposed himself to want,
Or brought his Race to Beggary.

And thus his seed a Blessing gain;

Do good, and from all sin abstain.

Those who are like himself will own;
They shall continue, when the Race.
Of wicked men is overthrown.
Part IV.

The Good and Just can only plead;
And to their pious Seed intail
Its blessings after they are dead.

Men's minds to form, and manners guide:

His Rule, his goings shall not slide.

And lies in wait to ruin them:

Nor, as he judges them, condemn.

So shall his promised blessings be
Thy portion; and when thou art raised,
The wicked's ruin thou shall see.

Flourish like Laurels ever green;

And no remainder could be seen.

And him that is upright in his way;
Mercy attends his happy Life,
And quiet peace concludes his days.

Escape God's sad but righteous doom,
Whose utter extirpation
At last shall with a vengeance come.

The Good and Just to save and bless;
Who may securely on his strength
Rely, for Succors in distress.

And be their rescue from the unjust:
His Truth and Honor is engaged,
To save them, for in him they trust.
PSALM XXXVII.
[Another Meter.]

The wicked's prosperous State;
Nor by their good Success grow bold
Their crimes to imitate.

The Mower cuts it down;
And beauteous flowers, within a while,
Are withered by the Sun.

God's goodness does rely:

Thy just desires supply.

Dependence on him live;
He Will either grant what thou would have,
Or what is better give.

Thy righteousness obscure;
He Will clear thy innocence, the Light
Shall not appear more pure.

Thy self by no means fret;
Though bad men thrive, or by ill Arts,
What fain they would have, get.

Check it, when it first begins;
Lest it boil up to wrath, and thou
Be hurried to their sins.

Good things in the promised Land;
But evil do'ers are doomed to be
Cut off by God's just hand.
Part II.

And if the place thou mind,
Where once thou saw him flourishing
Nothing remaining find.

The Land, and with increase
Of all good things their Lives be blessed,
And none disturb their peace.

Against the just combines:

Will laugh at his designs.

The poor and innocent:

For his own punishment.

For what contents the poor,
Is better than bad men's ill-got,
Or ill-employed store.

In pieces surely break;
But good men by his Arm shall be
Upheld, though never so weak.

Of Sorrow, God regards;
And with his promised happiness
Them and their seed rewards.

Their hopes on God relied:
In days of Famine, by his care,
They shall be still supplied.
Part III.

Shall perish by his Stroke;
Like fat of Lambs consume away,
And vanish into Smoke.

Not meaning to restore:
The righteous man as freely parts
With wealth, to help the poor.

And theirs shall be enjoyed;
The other, cursed of God, shall be
Cut off, and quite destroyed.

Delights in his way:

God's power will be his stay.

That liberal man could see
Whose Alms exposed himself to want,
Or Race to Beggary.

His seed a Blessing gain:

And from all Sin refrain.

That him resemble own.
They shall continue; when the Race
Of bad men is overthrown.
Part IV.

The Just can only plead;
And to their pious seed entail
Its Blessings when they are dead.

To form, and manners guide:

His goings shall not slide.

And wait to ruin them:

Nor as they judge, condemn.

His promised good shall be
Thy portion; and when thou art raised,
The wicked's ruin see.

Like Laurels fresh and green:

No remnant could be seen.

That Is upright in his ways;
Mercy attends his happy Life,
And peace concludes his days.

Escape God's righteous Doom;
Whose utter Extirpation
Shall with a vengeance come.

The just to save and bless:
Who may securely on his power
Rely, in all distress.

Their rescue from the unjust,
His Truth to save them is engaged,
Because in him they trust.
PSALM XXXVIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

When thou with kindness do chastise
But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear,
It this, unmixed with favor, rise.

How fast they stick in a deep wound;
The heavy load thy hand lays on,
Presses me down unto the ground.

It is, the Almighty to displease;
And, how provoking are my Sins,
I know, by pains that have no ease.

Threaten to sink me every hour;
Too great a load for me to bear,
Unless sustained by thy power.

My Body, and my Follies show:

I bowing like a Mourner go.

Ill humors run through every part:

I roar, for anguish of my heart.

Both what I want, and how I groan,

Decays of strength and sight, are known.
Part II.

Some pity to me would express,
All left me; and my nearest kin
Stood afar often in my distress.

Against my Life, they never give out;
This they discourse, and this contrive
By fraud and lies to bring about.

Or like a Man both deaf and mute;

Nor their reproaches could confute.

The Lord, that heard, my cause would plead;

T'insult, and proudly raise their head.

Gives a sad prospect to my view:

Have made these Punishments my due.

Live in prosperity and peace;
And by the false reports they raise,
Making me odious, they increase.

I Have done, against me all combine,
'Cause I the common good pursue,
Which they as studiously decline.

Forsake me not, as they have done:
Deferr no longer my relief,
Whose Safety lies in thee alone.
PSALM XXXIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

My ways, and chiefly watch my tongue;
To stifle passionate complaints,
How much they thrived who did me wrong.

But like a dumb man held my peace;
Tho whilst I thus denied all vent.
My inward grief did more increase.

My stifled sorrows wanted ease;
The kindled flame at length brake forth,
Into such words to God as these.

And number of my days I view,
To measure right my self and them,
How I am frail, and they are few.

Mine Age is nothing unto thee:
Man in his flourishing Estate
Is altogether Vanity.

But his Vexations real are;
He heaps up wealth, and knows not who
Shall reap the Profit of his Care.
Part II.

How kind the flattering world will prove;
I Will seek my God alone to please,
And be ambitious of his Love.

And then remove thy smarting Rod;
Lest Fools should fancy me cast off,
And laugh at all my Trust in God.

Thy Justice in my Punishment:

My strength to bear it will be spent.

When God for sin does man chastise;
Like Garments fretted by the Moth,
So all his beauty ruined lies.

And to my mournful cry give ear:
A wandering stranger here on Earth
I am, as all my Fathers were.

And spare me yet a while, that I
May make my peace with thee, before
I go away from hence, and die.
PSALM XXXIX.
[Another Meter.]

And chiefly watch my tongue;
To stifle all complaints, how much
They thrived, who did me wrong.

As dumb I held my peace;
Though whilst I thus denied all vent,
My grief did more increase.

Thus stifled wanted case:
The kindled flame at length brake forth
Into such words as these,

I have to live, I view;
To know my self and them, how I
Am frail, and they are few.

Is nothing unto thee;
When Man is in his best Estate,
He Is only Vanity.

Vexations real are;
Gets wealth, and knows not who shall reap
The profit of his Care.
Part II.

How kind the world will prove;
I Will seek to please my God, and be
Ambitious of his Love.

Remove thy smarting Rod;
Lest fools think me cast off, and laugh
At all my trust in God.

In may just punishment:

To bear it will be spent.

For sin does Man chastife;
Like Garments fretted by a Moth,
His beauty ruined lies.

And to my cry give ear;
I am a stranger here on Earth,
As all my Fathers were.

Me yet a while, that I.
May make my peace with thee, before
I go from hence, and die.
PSALM XL.

And on the Lord rely:
When other succors failed, to him,
I prayed, who heard my cry.

Surrounded with despair;
Am safely placed above my fears,
And firm my goings are.

To God, who set me free;
Whilst this thy Goodness does invite
Others to trust in thee.

And can the proud despise;
With the deceitful Arts of such
As turn aside to Lies.

To us so many are;
If I would tell them, they exceed
My thoughts and value far.

No longer grateful were;
And when Obedience thou before
Burnt-Offerings did prefer.

Thy sacred Books recite:

To do thy will delight.

How great thy Mercies are;
Thy Truth and Faithfulness, my tongue
To publish shall not spare.

In private thoughts concealed;
What all are so concerned to know,
To all I have revealed.
Part II.

How true thou art and kind;
And those Compassions I proclaim,
Lord, let me ever find.

With dangers round beset;
Nor wonder at it, when my sins
So many are and great.
Their Number I no more can tell
Than the hairs upon my head:
My heart is quite depressed, and seized
With horror and with dread.

To ruin me advance;
O do not stay, but come as fast
To my Deliverance,

Their own Confusion meet;
And when they'attempt my hurt, with shame
Be forced to retreat.

Themselves unpitied be;
Those who deride my Trust in God,
Reward with Infamy.

Their God alone to please,
Do thou thy Favor, Lord, express,
And make their joys to increase.
Let those whose hopes on thee depend,
And thy Salvation Love,
Ever have cause and hearts to say,
Praised be God above.

With Misery and Grief:
Thou art my Savior and my help
Lord, send me quick relief.
PSALM XLI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Is touched with another's grief;
Who when he hears the poor Man's cry,
Affords him pity and relief.
God will his Charity repay;
In time of need will be his Friend:
When troubles to his Lot shall fall,
He Will make 'em have an happy end.

His Life he will rescue from the Grave;
Prosper his State on Earth, and from
His Foes and all their malice save.

Of Languishing Infirmity:
Secure of God's Compassions,
His weary Limbs will softer lie.

I cried for Pity and for ease;
Lord, let thy Mercies heal my Soul,
Whose sins are only less than these.
Part II.

With Defamations strive to blot;
They wish me dead, and then they hope
To see my Reputation rot.

With me, but all is deceit and fraud;
He picks up matter for his Lies,
And spreads them, when he goes abroad.

Who hate me, and my hurt devise:

He Is laid, say they, never more to rise.

I put the greatest confidence,
Who to my Family retained,
Spurns at me with strange Insolence.

And once more seat me on my Throne;
That by just punishments, I may
Repay, what wickedly they have done.

I know, which thou do not recall:
That I Am in safety, and my Foe
Has missed his Triumph in my fall.

Thou have sustained my Innocence;




And; as to serve thee I Am advanced,
Wilt be for ever my defense.

Whom all true Worshippers adore;
Let every Age consent, and say
Amen, till time shall be no more.
PSALM XLII
[As the 100 Psalm.]

For thee I long, to thee I look:
No chased Heart does pant so much
After the cooling Water-brook.

From mine own house, O Lord than thine:
O how I wish t'approach that place,
Where all thy Glories use to shine.

Increase, and tears become my food,
Whilst mine insulting foes reproach
My Faith, and say, where is now thy God?

How to thine House in Troops we came;
What cheerful Feasts we kept, and sang
Praises in consort to thy Name.

Whence nothing but disquiet flows?
Since you procure not what I wish,
Why should you hinder my repose?
I Have learnt this Remedy at last;
To keep my passions calm and still,
I Am nearer Help by hope in God,
And Resignation to his will.

This Mountain to the other Hill,
Grief does oppress me: but the thoughts
Of thy great Goodness, cheer me still.
Part II.

Where one the other seems to invite;
Tossed in a Sea, where every Wave,
Threatens to overwhelm me quite.

To sing his praise both Night and Day,
I Will thus commend my self to him,
The Author of my Life, and pray.

"Do I thus unregarded lie?
"Why do I mourn without relief,
"Oppressed by mine Enemy?

"To hear my Trust in thee with Scorn
"Reproached, by them who flouting ask,
"Where Is now thy God? thou wretch forlorn!

Whence nothing bat disquiet slows?
Since you procure not what I wish,
Why should you hinder my repose.
I Have learnt this Remedy at last,
To keep my Passions calm and still:
I Am nearer help by hope in God,
And resignation to his will.
PSALM XLII.
[Another Meter.]

I long, to thee I look;
No chased Heart does pant so much
After the Water-brook.

From mine own house, than thine;
O how I wish t'approach the place
Where all thy Glories shine.

And tears become my food;
To hear my Foes reproach my Faith,
And say, where is now thy God?

How to thine House we came
In Troops to feast, and praises sang
In consort to thy Name.

Whence naught but trouble flows?
Since you procure not what I wish,
Hinder not my repose.
I Have learnt this Remedy, to keep
My Passions calm and still:
I Am nearer help by hope in God,
And a resigned will.

This to the other Hill,
Grief casts me down, but thoughts of God's
Great Goodness, chears me still.
Part II.

Another seems to invite:
Tossed in a Sea, where every wave
Threatens to drown me quite.

To praise thee Night and Day;
I Will thus commend my self to thee,
God of my Life, and pray.

"So long forgotten lie?
"Why do I mourn without relief,
"Oppressed by the Enemy?

"My Trust reproached with scorn,
"By them, who flouting ask, where is now
"Thy God? thou wretch forlorn!

Whence naught but trouble flows?
Since you procure not what I wish,
Hinder not my repose.
I Have learnt this Remedy, to keep
My Passions calm and still;
I Am nearer help by hope in God,
And a resigned will.
PSALM XLIII.
[At the 100 Psalm.]

Be thou my gracious Advocate;
And clear mine Innocence from those
Whose craft is equal to their hate.

On which my soul alone relies?
And look not on my mournful State,
Oppressed by cruel Enemies?

That by the Conduct of thy Light,
Thy Courts I may attain, and there
May have of thee a fuller sight.

My Soul, and all my Gladness raise:
Where I thy Goodness would proclaim
With all the Instruments of praise.

Whence nothing but Disturbance flows?
Since they procure not what I wish,
Why should they hinder my repose?
I Have learnt this Remedy at last,
To keep my Passions calm and still;
I Am nearer help by hope in God,
And resignation to his will.
PSALM XLIII.
[Another Meter.]

My gracious Advocate;
To plead my cause, against those, whose power,
Is equal to their hate.

On which my Soul relies?
And look not on my State oppressed
By cruel Enemies?

That, guided by thy Light,
I may attain thy Courts, and have
Of thee a fuller fight.

My soul, my joys would raise:
Where I thy Goodness would proclaim
With Instruments of praise.

Whence naught but trouble flows?
Since you procure not what I wish,
Hinder not my repose.
I Have learnt this Remedy, to keep
My Passions calm and still;
I Am nearer help by hope in God,
And a resigned will.
PSALM XLIV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

We Have often heard our Fathers tell;

How thou the Heathen did expel.

By their own Valor or their Sword:
But by the presence of thy Power,
And special favor of the Lord.
Jacob's Seed,
Whose powerful word alone can do, t:

And we shall tread them under-foot.

We hope to conquer, but by thee:

And they often made with shame to flee.


Thy presence is withdrawn, that used
To head our Armies heretofore:

Our Enemies with ease us foil;
We turn our backs, and they come on
With greedy haste to take the spoil.

Fall into cruel Butchers hands;
Others led Captive are dispersed
In far remote and Heathen Lands.

Like vilest Slaves they are sold and bought;
And being prized as little worth,
Their owners part with them for naught.

To all about a Laughing Stock:

When Signs they only make, their mock.
Part II.

Confounds me with perpetual shame:

Reproach us, and blaspheme thy Name.

These Miseries are our sad Lot,
We Have not been false unto our God,
Him or his Covenant forgot.

Nor thy Religion less have loved;
Nor hitherto our steps have balk'd
Thy way, nor we Apostates proved.

But Dragons rather fury breath;
Our state is utterly forlorn,
And dismal like the shades of Death.

Or prayed to their false Deities;

Who all our secret thoughts espies.

Like butchered sheep; is seen by all;
When rather than forsake our God,
We choose his Sacrifice to fall.

Thy long neglected people own:

Under such sad oppressions groan.

And we one Body seem to make:

Oh save us, for thy Mercies sake.
PSALM XLV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

The Praises of a Mighty King:
What I recite shall flow so fast,
No Scribes quick pen can make such haste.

Created Beauties does outshine:
All Graces on thy Lips are poured,
On thee Eternal Blessings showered.

The Ornament of Majesty;
Like an illustrious Prince appear,
And show how great thy Glories are.

The Virtues that adorn thy train;
Wronged Meekness Truth and Equity
Look only for support from thee,
Thine Enemies amazed stand,
Struck with the terror of thy hand;

Will find a passage to their hearts.

Thy Kingdom ever shall endure;
Thy Laws, the Scepter in thy hand,
Oppress not those whom they command.

Therefore thy Glories far above
Thy Fellows shine; thy God has shed
More Oil of Gladness on thy head.
Part II.

In Nuptial Garments richly clad,
So fragrant from the Ivory rooms,
As if made up of mere perfumes.

TO attend among the princely train:
The Royal Bride at thy right hand,
In purest Gold arrayed did stand.

If thou wilt thy Country's Rites forget:

For he is that Lord thou must adore.
Tire, and those of greatest port,
With presents shall thy favor court.

More splendid than thy cloth of Gold.

With rich embroid'ry, shall be brought;
Her Maids of Honor after go,
Attending in the pompous show.

Into the Palace of the King.

Princes, to rule the Earth shall come.

Survive, Great King, and spread thy Fame.
Thee future Ages shall adore
And praise, till time shall be no more.
PSALM XLVI.

The Strength whereby we stand;
When Troubles their approaches make,
His help is still at hand.

Though the Earth should be displaced;
Or though into the Sea's vast Gulf
The Mountains should be cast.

A frightful noise should make;
Should rise and swell unto the Clouds,
And cause the Hills to shake.

The City of the Lord:

And timely help afford.

But God is on our side;

And daunts their swelling pride.

The Sword out of its sheath;
Which, while he gives it leave, triumphs
In Slaughter and in Death.

Destructive wars to cease;
He breaks their Arms, the Bow and Spear,
And crowns the Earth with peace.

Whose Power is over all;
For fear, he should exalt himself
In your unpitied fall.

Of Hosts is on our side;
We in his Care, as in a Forts,
In Safety shall abide,
PSALM XLVII.

And make a joyful noise;
With Acclamations to your God,
Declare your inward joys.

Him greatly to be feared;
This King of all the world commands
Your Honor and regard.

Our Conquests do advance:

For our Inheritance.
Here he resides too, and in this
All People we excel:
A signal Token it is of Love
When God with us will dwell.

This Holy Place ascends;
Loud noise of trumpets all the while
Our shouts of joy attends.

Sing Praises to our King:

With understanding sing.

And him their Sovereign own;
He seats himself upon the Ark,
As on his Holy Throne.

Do all assemble here;
And whilst they worship Abr'ham's God,
From foes no danger fear.
God, who their safety undertakes,
Superior is to all:
His Rule extends over those whom men
The Earth's Defenders call.
PSALM XLVIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Are due from none so much as those
Of his own City, in that Mount
He for his solemn worship chose.

None so delightful does afford;
Seen Northward of Jerusalem,
The City of our Mighty Lord.

God keeps his solemn Residence:
His Divine presence makes it safe,
No Fort can give it such defense.

Drew near, this City to attack:

In great Confusion hasted back.

No childbed throws come on so fast:

Tossed by fierce Tempests, break at last.

As heretofore our Fathers told:
His Mercy, which has saved us now,
Will still protect, and it uphold.
Part II.

We to thy Temple did repair;
Thought on thy Love, and waited there,
What God would do, by humble prayer.

Thee so, in our Deliverance:
And all the World thy glorious power
In cheerful Praises will advance.
Thy hand for works of Mercy, Lord,
As well as Justice is renowned:
Sion then begin her Songs,
Followed By Judah's cities round.


All are entire; and with what Care
'T has been by Heaven preserved, show.

May trust in God, whom we have tried:
Then he, who now our Guard has been,
Will ever be our God and Guide.
PSALM XLIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Their Ears with great attention bow,
To words that equally concern



My self will listen, while they are sung
To the soft Music of my Harp.

Affright himself with needless fear
In days of evil; when Old Age
Approaches, or when Death draws near.





With Fools together mingled lie:
The Rich, though loath to go, must leave
The World, with all their wealth, and die.
Part II.

Their Fame eternally shall stand;
And to preserve their Memory,
Give their own Names unto their Land.

Makes all their splendid Titles fade:

The Follies and Mistakes they made.

And beauty quite consumed away;
They in Death's Fold shall lie ^nclos'd,
Till the great Resurrection-Day.
A Day in which the Just shall reign,
And over the Bad Dominion have:

After I Am raised from the Grave.

Or honored here; for when he dies;

And stripped of all his Glory lies.

And other Men are apt to praise
His prudent Management, who strives
His Wealth or Family to raise:

The Path his Fathers went before;
And in the Place where now he dwells,
Never see Light or Comfort more.

And with true Wisdom is not blessed;
Though pleased with faise and flattering hopes,
Shall die and perish like a Beast.
PSALM XLIX.
[Another Meter.]

With needful listening bow:

Alike, both high and low.

And with attention sharp

To my Melodious Harp.

Affright himself with fear
In evil days; to see Old Age
Approach, or Death draw near?





Together mingled lie;
The Rich, though loath, must leave the world
With all their wealth, and die.

Their Fame shall ever stand;
And that their Names may not be lost,
They give them to their Land.

Makes all their Titles fade;

All the mistakes they made.
Part II.

And Beauty fades away;
And there shall lie enclosed, till
The Resurrection Day.
Then shall the Just men reign, and over
The Bad Dominion have;

When raised from the Grave.

Or rich, for when he dies,

Of all his Glory lies.

And men are apt to praise
That prudent Management, which wealth
And Families does raise:

Where others went before;
And never, where he now must dwell,
See Light or Comfort more.

True wisdom is not blessed;
Though pleased with flattering hopes, shall die,
And perish like a Beast.
PSALM L.

Calls the whole Land to hear;
And summons all from East to West
Before him to appear.
s the beauteous Palace, where
God keeps his Residence;
He Will go in greatest Splendor forth
And Kingly State from thence.

Lightnings devouring flame,
And thundering Tempests round about
His coming shall proclaim.

His witnesses shall be;
And all the world the Equity
Of his Proceedings see.

His Saints to this Assizo;
Who have a Solemn Covenant made
Confirmed by Sacrifice.

His Justice shall appear;
Since God himself, the Righteous Judge,
Will pass the Sentence there.
Israel, hear to what my charge
Against thee does amount;
It is thy God, who gave thee Laws,
Now calls thee to account.

Of legal Sacrifice;
The Smoke of whose burnt Offerings
Daily to Heaven does rise.

For other Sins to make:
I need not Bullocks or He-Goats
From thy short Stores to take.
Part II.

The Beasts both wild and tame;

All as mine own I claim.

Thee to provide me food;
Since all the Earth to me belongs,
With its full stores of good.

Are on mine Altar, think
I have such Appetite, as craves
Supply of meat and drink.

Thy Vows to the most High:

Him only glorify.

God's Covenant in thy talk?
Urge others to observe his Laws,


And foul Adulteries:

Contrives deceit and Lies.

As thine own Mother's Son:

I liked these things thou'st done.
But I Will correct thee, and in view
Thy sins in order set.

All ye that God forget.
Abused Patience will make
His wrath the more severe;
And none have power to rescue those
Whom he will in pieces tear.

Pleases and honors me;
And he who orders right his ways,
Shall my Salvation see.
PSALM LI.
[To the Tune of the Lamentation,]

That unto thee for Mercy flies;
As thy Compassions boundless are,
So blot out mine iniquities.

For thou alone can make me clean;

Amazed to see how vile I Have been.

But thy Tribunal, Lord, I fear;
For if arraigned and judged by thee,
I must be cast, and thou be clear.

Too prone and bent to do amiss;

And Truth of Heart most pleasing is.

As those with Hyssop sprinkled know
They are absolved; thy Grace can wash
And make me whiter than the Snow.

And inward peace that once I had;
Thy pard'ning voice would heal again
My broken bones and make them glad.

With a severe and angry look;
O take their stains out of my Soul,
And blot their guilt out of thy book.
This may be here added, when the Tune of the Lamentation is used.
To thee, O Father, to the Son
And Holy Ghost, whom we adore;
Be Glory, as it was of old,
Is now, and shall be evermore.
Part II.

Clean and unspotted in thy sight;
Renew a well composed mind,
Unmoved from Goodness and upright.

As one whom thou no more can Love;
Nor let thy Spirit, whose grace I need,
Though grieved too much, from me remove.

TO uphold my feeble powers, afford.

Their ways, and turn unto the Lord.

Of Blood, that sin of crimson dye;
Thy Faithfulness I Will then proclaim,
And loudly sing thy Clemency.


Than costly Sacrifice of Beasts
Consumed wholly in the fire.

Do more than bloody offerings prize;
This present now I humbly make,
Which God, I trust, will not despise.

To bless, defend and succor them:
Do good to Sion, Lord, and build
The Walls of thy Jerusalem.

How kind thou art, shall loudly tell;
And all their choicest Offerings laid
Upon God's Altar, please him well.
PSALM LI.
[Another Meter.]

To thee for Mercy flies;
Thy boundless Mercy can blot out
All mine Iniquities.

Alone can make me clean:

To see how vile I Have been.

Thy Sentence, Lord, I fear;
If judged by thee, I know I must
Be cast, and thou be clear.

Too prone to do amiss;

To thee most pleasing is.

With Hyssop sprinkled know
They are absolvd; thy Grace can wash,
And make me white as Snow.

And Peace that once I had;
Thy Voice would heal my broken bones,
Thy Pardon make them glad.

With a displeased Look;
O take their stains out of my Soul,
Their Guilt out of thy Book.
Part II.

Unspotted in thy sight;
Renew in me a mind unmoved
From Goodness, and upright.

As one thou can not love;
Nor let thy Spirit, though grieved too much,
Its Grace from me remove.

My feeble powers afford:

And turn unto the Lord.

That sin of Crimson Dye;
Then I Will proclaim thy Faithfulness,
And sing thy Clemency.

For this thou do desire,

Consumed in the fire.

More than all Offerings prize;
This present now I humbly bring,
Which God will not despise.

Defend and succor them;
Do good to Sion; build the walls
Of thy Jerusalem.

How kind thou art, shall tell;
And all their Offerings laid upon
God's Altar, please him well.
PSALM LII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

That thou can mighty Mischief do!
Unlike to God, who is not inclined
By'Almighty Power, to be less kind.

Thy Tongue, like Razor newly set;
The first mischievous Instrument,
Prepared to stay the Innocent.

Evil and Lies thee better please.

At once a City to devour.

Thy turn is next to be destroyed:
He Will pluck thee from thy dewlling place,
And root out all thy cursed Race.

Yet thus express their Joys withal.

" Of one that made not God his Trust.
"Who meant by treacherous Arts and Lies,
"By wicked practices to rise;
"And strengthened by great wealth he thought
"Himself secure; He Is brought to naught.

Supported by the Almighty's hand;
And flourish like an Olive Tree:
God's Mercy still my Trust shall be.

For what h' has promised ever wait;
Though other ways bad men propound,
This the best course his Saints have found.
Psalm LIII
[As the 25 Psalm.]

Does mind the affairs below:
For though they speak it not aloud,
They live as if 'twere so.
All are corrupt and vile,
Their Actions hateful are;
They Are only skillful to do ill,
From Good estranged far.

And took a strict Survey,
What men did seek and know the Lord,
And his just Laws obey.

With loathsome Sins o'ergrown;
What was Religious just and good,
None practiced, no not one.

Like bread the poor devour;
And neither own thee by their prayers
Nor dread thy mighty Power.

Great terrors seized them there;
God who despised them, made their fall
As shameful as their fear.

Thy captive people free:
When thy Salvation shall appear,
Great will their triumphs be.
Psalm LIVE.

Thou righteous Judge, advance:

In my Deliverance.

And Strangers to thy fear
Seek to betray me, and to take
Away my Life, draw near.

And brings unlook'd-for aid:
Since he my threatened Life secures,
I Will be no more afraid.

With such malicious fraud:
When thy just Vengeance on them falls,
All will thy Truth applaud.

Of Praise to God I Will bring;
His Power and Wisdom celebrate,
His Goodness ever sing.

And I with pleasure see
Mine Enemies retreat with shame,
Who gloried over me.
PSALM LV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Thy self from thy poor Suppliant:

A doleful noise in my Complaint.

And now reduced me to sore straits;
And loading me with forged crimes,
With rage pursues me, whom he hates.

I feel even Death's strange Agonies:
My Danger threatens me so loud,


As Dove's, who have their innocence,
That to a safe and quiet place
I might retire, by flying hence.

Or to some unknown Desert go:

Till this fierce Tempest did o'erblow.

And their Destruction spring from thence,
The City's with Contention filled,
By rapine caused and Violence.

Mischief and Woe Keep Centry there:

In the Head of every street appear.

Reproached, one made by quarrels fierce;
I could have born it then, or else
Been safe, by shunning his converse.

Beloved, my Counselor, my Friend;
With whom my hours, both at my own
And at God's House, I often did spend.
Part II.

And sink alive into a Grave;
For else, where ever they go or stay,
Mischievous plots a place will have.

Who Will rescue me from what I fear;

I Will cry aloud, and he will hear.

In battle save from cruel hands:
Though they in Number far exceed,
God's Presence for an Army stands.

Will humble, and my prayers will hear;
Who prosp'ring hitherto in Sin,
Change not, nor God's just Vengeance fear.

Oaths of Fidelity has broke.

Ready to give a Mortal stroke.

On God, who will support his own;
They, though sore shaken for a while,
Shall not be utterly cast down.

Prepares men for a fearful end;
Whom God, when they are most secure,
Will headlong to destruction send.
How seldom do the Men of Blood
And Treachery, live half their Days;
I trust, I shall mine Age conclude
In peace, and long God's Goodness praise.
PSALM LVI.

For Man would me devour;
His hot and close pursuit affords
No Truce to breathe an Hour.

And wait my steps t'ensnare;
As well in Number as in Power
To me Superior are.

Some present frights create;
My Trust in thee will never fail.
My Fears to dissipate.

With praise his faithful Word;
And vanquish all my fears of Men,
By trusting in the Lord.

By being Innocent;
They wrest my words, and to my hurt
Their thoughts are wholly bent.

And Snares in secret lay;
Watch all my motions and their time:
To take my Life away.
Part II.

And escape without God's frown?
Repress their haughty insolence;
With Vengeance cast them down.

Thou know how often I weep;
A kind remembrance of my tears,
And of my troubles keep.

To quell my foes, whose pride
Will make my Victory more sure,
Since God is on my side.

With praise, his faithful word;

By trusting in the Lord.

Even to my latest breath;

Rescued my Life from Death.
From falling by the wicked's power
If God will me defend;
My Feet his paths shall tread, my Life
I Will in his service spend.
PSALM LVII.

Mercy to me extend;
I fly for Shelter to thy wings,
Till all my troubles end.

In my distress I Will cry;
Since thou have saved me heretofore,
Thy help will still be nigh.

And save me by his Power;
Put those to shame, who would my Life
With greedy haste devour.
God's Mercy and his Truth's engaged
For my security:

Than Men, enclosed I lie.
They breath mere flames, their teeth are spears
Their tongue a sharpened sword:

In my Deliverance, Lord.

My ruin was prepared;
Their Pits occasioned their own fall,
Their Gins themselves ensnared.

And this my Tongue shall raise;

A Consort to thy Praise.

I Will to the World proclaim;
The scattered Nations shall assist
My Songs, to spread thy same.

Thy Truth unto the Skies;

Both Earth and Heaven rise.
PSALM LVIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And Judges in great councils sit,
Do ye just Sentences pronounce,
And Righteous Men with care acquit?

In equal Balances be weighed,
You practice open Violence,
By your corrupt affections swayed.

Depraved, almost as soon as born;
A wicked brood; trained up to lie,
To flatter, and all Truth to scorn.

No Serpent deadlier poison bears;
To all true Information deaf,
The Asp, it is said, thus stops her ears.

Charmers employ their Magick-skill;
And all reproofs on you are lost,
Who are unjust by Stubborn will.

Yet, Lord, their wickedness disarm;
When they like Lions fiercely rage,
Leave them no power to do me harm.




Part II.

Like hasty showers as quickly spent;
Their Arrows prove like broken reeds,
When ever their Bow's for Mischief bent.

Or those untimely births, begun
With painful throes the Mothers feel,
Which die before they see the Sun.

Like thorns prepared to sees a pot;
When by a furious Tempest raised,
All Is swept away, before it is hot.

The Joys and Triumphs of the Good,
As over the slain with Victory
They pass, and dip their feet in blood.

That God men's actions does regard;
And will not fail, as they deserve
Either to punish or reward.
PSALM LIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

From, those that now against me rise:

Blood must, and only mine, assuage.

And with strong Guards my house beset;
To take away my Life they wait,
Who by no Crime deserve their hate.

And, Lord, thou know I Have nothing done;
Thou who have often my helper been,
Behold what dangers I am in.

Lord God of Hosts, compared with thine?
Spare not these Heathens, who profess
They Are thine, but wickedly transgress.

They come at Evening for their prey;
Which they like growling Dogs do watch,
And hunt the City round to catch.

They talk of naught but death and swords;
For who, say they, minds what we do?

Exposed to all men's Scorn they will be,
Who shall their hopes defeated see.

Who will defend me from their hate.
Part II.

My ruin, upon which they re bent;
And, by my strange escape, complete
My wish, in their as strange defeat.





This would be soon forgot again;
If only scattered and brought low,
Their lasting shame thy power would show.

Their Execrations, Oaths and lies,
Are sins whereof their Mouths are full;
Just Vengeance on their heads they will pull.

And perish in thy wrath at last;
That there is a God then all will know,
Who governs every thing below.

Watch like a growling Dog my door,
Or hunt me round in every street;
A plague like to it let them meet.

To wander up and down for meat,
And pass whole nights in sad complaints,
That none does satisfy their wants.

I Will early raise my praising voice,
Proclaim God's Care and Providence,
in straits my refuge and defense.

My strength, to whom I prayed before:
Thy Mercy ever sing and show,
To which my Life and Safety's due.
PSALM LX.

Deserted we have lain;
Our powers all broken and dispersed,
Lord, turn to us again.

Does strange Convulsions feel;
The Breaches by our Folly made,
Thy hand can only heal.

And such amazement wrought;
As if of deadly wine w'had drank
A stupifying draught.

An Ensign does advance,
To which the Righteous may repair,
And find deliverance.

A Savior in their need,
In answer to my servent prayers
Thy timely succors speed.
Part II.

My hopes depend on thee;
The Land that round Samaria lies,
Submits it self to me.
Israel's Tribes unite
To own my righteous Cause;
Ephraim's my chiefest strength for War,
Judah supports my Laws.
and Edom, as vile slaves
To serve me will be glad;
Philistia meet her conquering Lord,
And to his Triumphs add.

On Edom's Frontiers lies,
So strongly fenced against all assaults,
Which all my force defies?

Refused our Arms to bless;
He Will undertake our conduct now,
And crown it with Success.

Thine aids in trouble meet;
Our hands shall do ^reat acts, our foes
Lie conquered at our feet.
PSALM LXI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]


TO the utmost corner of the Land,
Yet thou can hear and help no less.
My heart's with sorrow overwhelmed:
Be thou to me a safe retreat;
Where placed above my foes and fears
I may enjoy a quiet Seat.

To me a Shelter and strong Tower.

Trusting in thy protecting power.

Thy peoples Heritage possess:

Thy King, I hope, thou still wilt bless,

And fear, O Lord, abide; and send,
That Truth and Goodness better far,
Than strongest Guards may him defend.

And thy great Name for ever bless:
And carefully perform those Vows
I made to God in my distress.
PSALM LXII.
[As the 25 Psalm.]

My Rock and my defense:

Under his Providence.

Destruction in my fall?
Like a loose fence you will tumble down,
Or like a bowing wall.

With Lies, what wants in force
To ruin me; they speak me fair,
Whom inwardly they curse.

Do not to God neglect:
Wait on him still, from whom alone
Deliverance I expect.

And my Salvation;
He Is my defense; it is not their power,
Can thrust me from my throne.

On God alone depend;
He, like a Rock or Fort, shall me
Against all my Foes defend.
Part II.

When ever you are afraid;
He Will be your refuge in distress,
When you implore his aid.

Are vain; great men a Lie:
Both in the Balance laid appear
Lighter than Vanity.

It Is vain in this to trust:
Then seek not to enrich your selves
By ways that are unjust.
It Riches should abound,
By Heaven's Blessing sent,
Take heed they do not gain your hearts,
Nor make you insolent.

Their help they should derive;
Thou, Lord, have often declared, that power
Is thy prerogative.

Abundantly from thee;
So that according to Men's works,
Their due reward shall be.
PSALM LXIII.

Thy Mercy does implore;
No Traveller in desert Lands
Can thirst for water more.

Within thy Holy place;
Thy Power and Glory to behold,
And to obtain thy Grace.

No relish does afford;
No other joys can equal this,
To serve and praise the Lord.

And praise him whilst I live:

Both food and pleasure give.

Present thee to my mind;
And in the Night I think, how good
My God has been and kind.

To thee alone I fly;
And on thy watchful Providence
With cheerfulness rely.

With Speed, and Safety gain;
When I keep close to God, his Care
And Power will me sustain.

My Life to take away:

Food for the Beasts of Prey.

That swear by his great Name
Shall glory; when, perfidious Men
Shall silenced be with Shame.
PSALM LXIV.

Be thou my Life's defense:

And open Violence.

Deeper than sharpest Swords;
Who instead of poisoned arrows, use
Cruel and slanderous words.

Against the innocent;
Which fear of God will not restrain,
Nor yet Man's Care prevent.

In secret Leagues, they hide
Such undiscerned Snares, they think
By none can be descried.

Or wicked Skill find out,
They unattempted leave, to bring
Their Villainies about.

Whose vengeance they provoke,
Shall ruin all their plots, and wound
Them by a sudden Stroke.

Shall on themselves return:
And left by all, over their lost hopes
They shall unpitied mourn.

With awful fear, shall own,
It was an hand Divine, not chance
Threw these proud sinners down.

And loudly tell their joys:
Who makes them gloriously triumph
Over wicked Craft and Lies.
PSALM LXV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]
Sion wait for thee,
And there the Vow performed shall be:

All Flesh shall cheerfully repair.

To all that good from thee we hope;
Thy Mercy does those fears allay,
For this will purge our sins away.

To thee, and in thy Courts appear;
For these shall all refreshments have
Thy House can give, or they can crave.

Thy Kindness to the Good do show;
The Ends of the Earth in thee conside,
And the Isles that in the Sea reside.

'Gain from thy strength Stability:

And stills the peoples madder rage.
Part II.

Thy works of Power and Anger dread;
And all adore thy Goodness great,
Where ever the Sun does rise or set.

Thou visitest the thirsty Earth:
Showers to enrich her barren womb,
From thy full Springs above do come.
Thy Bounty does that food provide,
By which our needs are all supplied.

Wat'red with Showers are soft and yield.
Its Seed, by clods thus gently pressed,
Springs up, and by'after rains is blessed.

And Plenty from the Clouds drops down.

Though parched before, now springs again:
The Little Hills new Garments wear,
And in their youthful Green appear.

The Vales are covered over with grain:
All Nature seems to shout and sing,
To welcome in the hopeful Spring.
PSALM LXV.
[Another Meter.]
Sion wait for thee,
The Vow there paid shall be:

All gladly shall repair.

TO all good from thee we hope;
Thy Mercy will those fears allay,
And purge our sins away.

And in God's Courts appear;
Refreshments in thy House they will have
Of what their Souls can crave.





Kindness to us do show:
In thee the Ends of the Earth confide,
Isles that in the Sea reside.

Fixed and unmoved stand.

And People's madder rage.
Part II.

So widely, see and dread:
All where the Sun does rise or set,
Adore thy Goodness great.

Thou visitest the Earth:
Showers from above, to enrich her womb,
Like flowing rivers come.
By food thy Bounty does provide,
Our needs are all supplied.

Soft'ned by showers yield.

Springs up, by fresh rain blessed.
The fruitful year rich blessings crown
Which fatning Showers drop down.

Though parched, now Springs again.
The little Hills new garments wear,
In youthful green appear.

The Vales spread over with grain.
All Nature seems to shout, and sing
Welcome to a hopeful spring.
PSALM LXVI.

To God their Voices raise:

Him Glorious by their Praise.

Such terror does appear;
As makes his Foes to crouch, and feign
Obedience through their fear.

And sing unto thy Name:

To raise and spread thy Fame.

The swelling Flood made way
For Israel to pass: Who there
His Glories did display.

Does over the World extend;
Then let not men rebel, for pride
Will in their ruin end.

And loudly sing thy Praise;

And Guide of all our ways.
Part II.

In grievous straits distressed:

With heavy loads oppressed.

Have trod us under feet:
But through all dangers we are brought,
Where Ease and Plenty meet.

And thankful Offerings lay

I made in trouble pay.

Does come, I Will spare no cost;
I Will offer what he does require,
And what will please him most.

What God for me has done;
His Mercies showed to me, will be
For your Instruction.

My fervent cries did raise;
He heard me graciously, and turned
My sighing into praise.

Iniquity regard:

And my Petitions heard.

Be ever magnifie'd;
Who neither did reject my Prayer,
Nor his own Grace denied.
PSALM LXVII.
[As the 25 Psalm.]

Bless us with gifts divine;
O let the Glories of thy Face,
On us thy Servants shine.

Thy Fear on Earth abound;
And thy Salvation over all
The Heathen World resound.

Their grateful thoughts express;
Let all the people round the World
Thy mighty Name confess.

Their Joys, since God does reign:
He rules with Wisdom, this great Judge
Will Righteousness maintain.

Their grateful thoughts express;
Let all the people round the World
Thy mighty Name confess.

With Plenty overflow;
And God on all his other Gifts,
His Blessing will bestow.

Our happy Days shall crown:
His Power and Goodness all the World
With humble Fear shall own.
PSALM LXVIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

His scattered foes will flee for fear;

Before the Fire, when he draws near.


He rides on High above the Clouds,
Let him be raised too in your Songs.


He for the desolate provides,
But plagues the RebelsLand with drought.

From Egypt with a Mighty hand;
And led'st them through the Wilderness,
To bring them to the Promised Land:

The Earth did with thy Thunder quake;
Mount Sinai, when the Lord came down
Did from its firm Foundation shake.

A plenteous rain, at their complaint;
Even Bread was rained down from Heaven,
For their Refreshment who were faint.

Found a convenient dwelling there;
And by thy bounty, Lord, the poor
With all things needful furnished were.
Part II.

A female Army ('it was their use)
Met the returning Conquerours,
And in their Songs thus told the News:

"Have left the field with hasty flight;
"And left rich spoils, all shared by us
"Women, who were too weak to fight.
Egypt's servile works,
"Sull'ied among the Pots have lien;
"Your Armies Wings, like those of Doves,
"Victorious now, shall brightly shine.

On this Side Jordan conquered were,
They as illustrious as the Snows
On Salmon's Hill, did then appear.

Your Conquests also did advance;
The high Hill of Basan then became;
A part of God's Inheritance.





As if God meant with you to abide;
Sion's the Hill which he has chose
Therein for ever to reside.

And God is where that Host appears:
Sinai had once his presence, now
To Sion the Honor he transferrs.
Part III.

Ascended is above the Skies;
And after him in triumph draws
As Spoils, his captived Enemies.
He scattered his various Gifts
Around, to make his Bounty known;
Even Rebels had a share, amongst whom
He dwells, and they his kindness own.

On us, shall have our praising Songs:

The Power of Life and Death belongs.

The Heads of all that him resist;
On whom no Methods of his Love
Prevail, who still in sin persist.

Of former Ages he will renew;
As great as those in Bashan's Land,
And the Red Sea, his People knew.

And such a Slaughter shall be made,
That in thine Enemies blood, the Dogs
Their tongues may dip, and thou may wade.

His entrance to the Holy place:

With Timbrels the procession grace.

Their Voices, and this Song they sung,
"In your assemblies bless the Lord,
"All ye that are from Jacob sprung.

Judah and Benjamin lay near;
But the remote too, Zobulun
And Nephthali, attended there.
Part IV.

O Israol, has made thee strong:
Confirm it, Lord, and what is begun
So happily, continue long.
Jerusalem
Shall from thy Temple there come down,
That, by rich Presents thither brought,
Kings shall themselves thy subjects own.

With rage to War against us bent;
With Captains furious as Bulls,
Soldiers as Heifers insolent.
Prancing in Silver-plated Arms,
He unprovoked comes out to fight:
Scatter his Forces and destroy
All that in War and blood delight.
to make a league with thee,
Princely Ambassadors shall send,
And Aethiopia to God
Her hands in gifts and prayers extend.


From thence he thunders with his Voice,
Which every Creature dreads that hears.

Illustriously to Israel shown:
Its wonders in the Heavens appear,
And thence by all the World is known.

In Holy Places, are amazed:
It Is God who gives strength and power
Unto his Saints; his Name be praised.
PSALM LXIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]


Into deep Waters I am led,
Whose swelling waves overflow my head.

I scarce can speak, my throat's so dry:
Mine Eyes, with looking long in vain,
I scarce can lift to Heaven for pain.

Who' unjustly to destroy me long:
Though, of all quarrels to be rid,
I Have paid for wrongs I never did.

I never did them Injury.

Well doing, seeing me undone.

Reproach, and suffered so much scorn:

Not owned by those of nearest kin.

And House, consumes me like a Flame:
All the reproaches thrown at thee,
I felt as if they would aimed at me.

They call me a lewd Hypocrite:

I Am looked on as a Fool or Mad.
When the grave Judges do me wrong,


Thy time, O Lord, to favor me.
Part II.

Thy promised Goodness, Lord, express,
Rescue me from that dangerous State
I Am brought into by cruel hate.

If I still sink, and they overflow:
This heap of Waves, unless thou save,
Will rise so high, they will be my Grave.

Whose only comfort is thy Love;
As thou to pity art inclined,
Let me thy tenderest Mercies find.

Thy Servant, 'cause in such distress:
But as my troubles greater are,
Require thy speedier help and Care.

Whose Life is struck at by my foes:
Who, when I Am ruined, will aloud
Proclaim their joys, and grow more proud,

With what reproaches I Am abused;
Both who are my sworn Enemies,
And what they plot, before thee lies.

Under reproaches, breaks my heart:
I find no Partner in my grief,
As far from pity as relief.

And give me Gall, instead of meat:
And when to quench my thirst I think,
They give me Vinegar to drink.
Part III.

And let their Table be their Snare:
Their prosperous State without mishap,
Be for their ruin a sure Trap.

Their Loins continually to shake:

To overtake and hold them fast.

Their houses may be waste and void.

His grief whom he afflicts, renew.

And then no Mercy to them show:

Which to the Righteous promised are

Save me, and fet me up on high.

Thy Grace and Power how great they are,

Than fairest Ox or Bullock prize:

This will revive and make it glad.

Whom men ill treat, and use as slaves.

Since one tongue's not enough for praise.
Sion save, and build
Cities with Judah's people filled:

Shall there reside and safely dwell.
PSALM LXX.
[As the 25 Psalm.]

How they with haste advance;
O do not stay, but come as fast
To my Deliverance.

Their own Confusion meet:
When they attempt my hurt, with shame
Be forced to retreat.

Their Sport unpitied be;
Those that deride my trust in God,
Reward with Infamy.

Do seek their God to please,
Thy favor toward them express,
And make their joys to increase
Let those that hope in thee,
And thy Salvation love,
Ever have cause and hearts to say,
Praised be God above.

With Misery and Grief;
Thou art my Savior and my help,
Lord, send me quick relief.
PSALM LXXI.
[As the 25 Psalm.]

Let none disgrace my trust:

As thou art good and just.

Whereto I may resort;
Make good thy gracious promise, Lord,
Be thou my Rock and Fort.

And those that are unjust;

And from my Youth, my trust.

When my first breath I drew;
Thou have sustained me ever since,
All praise to thee is due.

On me, as one forlorn;

I shall confute their Scorn.

And when my years decline,
Do not forsake or cast me off,
But own me still for thine.

Conspire, these counsels please.

"Take and destroy with ease.

Incline thee to draw near,
And make thine aids with greater speed
For my relief appear.

Of my confounded foes;
And disappointed of their hopes
To open shame expose.
Part II.

Him with more praises crown:

Whose measures are unknown.

But to the strength divine;
No other Goodness shall be named
Or Faithfulness but thine.

And hitherto declared
Thy wondrous works: forsake me not

Till I have further shown
Thy Power, and taught thy fear
Both to the present Age, and those
That after shall appear.

Thy Works illustrious are;
All thy Perfections have no Bounds,
None can with thee compare.

My Soul, with grief deprest;

Comfort and give me rest.

I Will all my Powers raise;
And to improve my Songs, will add
Sweet Instruments of praise.

Shall loudly bear a part
In praising thee, when tuned and raised,
By a most thankful heart.

To celebrate thy Fame;
Who have redeemed me, and brought
Mine Enemies to shame.
PSALM LXXII
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And Grace to judge aright be blessed:

And the poor injured be redressed.

And undisturbed quiet gain;
When Rulers high and low, their rights
And their just Liberties maintain.

To crush the proud oppressors might;
And save the helpless poor from those
Who in their Miseries delight.

Thy lasting Honor shall procure;
And all shall thee observe and fear,
As long as Sun and Moon endure.

Such welcome blessigs shall come down,
As showers on thirsty ground distill,
Or gentle rains on grass new-mown.

The Moon it self shall sooner cease
To fill and wain, than his just reign
Fail to be blessed with lasting peace.
Part II.

Within Judaea's bounds, but stretch
It self from Sea to Sea, as far
As the Earths Inhabitants do reach.

To own and do him homage meet;
His Enemies shall lick the Dust,
By low prostrations at his feet.
Tharsis and the Isles
Though distant far, shall presents bring;
Princes from happy Arabs Land,
With Gifts shall honor this great King.

With Low Submissions be adored;
All Nations Tributaries be,
And serve him as their Sovereign Lord.

As a known Patron of the poor;
Who saves them, when they cry in vain
To other helps, and his implore.


Or violence their ruin seeks,
Dear shall their blood be in his Sight.
Part III.

The East rich Off rings shall present;
All men shall pray for his long Life,
And praise his Righteous Government.

The Corn on barren Mountains sown,
Shall Spring so thick, the fruit shall shake
And make a noise like Lebanon.
The Earth thus blessed, the people too
Shall fruitful be and flourishing;
The Cities Numbers shall increase
Like Grass or Flowers in the Spring.

In all succession shall survive;
All Nations shall him blessed call,
And Blessings all from him derive.

Of Israel, whose stupendous Acts
Of Power our wonder, and whose Grace
Our Love and Gratitude attracts.

For ever be advanced then;
His Glories fill the Earth, and all
Join in his Praise, and say Amen.
PSALM LXXIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

To those that are sincerely good:

My feet did stagger where I stood.

My envy at those Fools did rise:

A quiet Death should close their Eyes.

That others seek to escape in vain;

And pride surrounds them like a chain.

Their Body thrives, looks fresh and fair;
Their Wealth rolls in with a full tide,
Beyond their hopes, without their Care.

They make no Scruple, feel no shame:

And freely blast the good Man's Name.

And Passion makes his tears to flow;

Discerns or minds things done below.

Thrive in the World, and riches gain:

And cleans'd my heart, says he, in vain.

And I whole Days in Sorrow spend:

The Faith of all good Men offend.
Part II.

The unequal ways of Providence;
I found them hard to be resolved,
And doubts long kept me in suspense.

And there did my mistakesamend:
Before I only viewed their way,
But now I understood their end.

On which their tottering feet were placed:

When down to sudden ruin cast.

Which waking quickly vanishes:



By thee sustained, tho suffering;

And afterward to Glory bring.

On whom I can rely like thee;

My Stay and Portion thou will be.

Or unto hateful Idols bow,
Shall furely their own ruin meet,
And a deserved Overthrow.

To keep me to my God most nigh:
Then I his Mercy and his Truth
Shall praise, when I on him rely.
PSALM LXXIII.
[Another Meter.]

That are sincerely good:

I staggered where I stood.

To prosper, envy rose;

Of health and vigor, close.

Strive to escape in vain;

Surrounds them like a chain.

Their looks are fat and fair:
Their wealth flows in beyond their hopes,
And often without their Care.

No scruple feels, nor shame.

Freely the Good man's Name.

And makes his tears to flow:

Or minds what is done below.

Grow rich and thrive amain.

And cleans'd my heart in vain.

In grief whole days I spend.

Of all good men offend.
Part II.

God's ways of Providence:
I found the search too hard, and doubts
Long kept me in suspense.

Did my Mistakes amend:
Before I viewed their way, but now
I understood their end:

On which their feet were placed:

To sudden ruin cast.

Which waking vanishes.



Sustained, though suffering.

And hence to Glory bring.

I can rely, like thee.

And Portion thou will be.

Or unto Idols bow;
Shall meet thy fierce displeasure here,
And utter overthrow.

To keep to him most: nigh:
His Truth and Mercy I shall praise,
When I on him rely.
PSALM LXXIV
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Whom for his own, we know, he
For ever shall his Anger smoke
Against his once beloved Flock?

So dearly bought, be quite forgot:
But thy old dwelling call to mind,
Sion, to which thou have been kind.

The lasting ruins of our City;
Or in thy Holy House alone,
What mischief the Enemy has done.

With rage they impiously roar:
Their Banners there set up we see,
In Token of their Viotory.

So here they; freely deal their blows.

An Axe's stroke at once hews down.

To be untouched they turn to flames;
And level with the Ground thus lain,
Is made by wicked hands profane.

To root out our Religion quite:
Our Synagogues for this employed,
Not one is left, but all destroyed.

No tokens of his Presence see;
No Prophet now to us does send,
To tell us when our woes shall end.
Part II.

Who Trust in thee to Scorn expose?
And hear'st what blasphemies they speak,
That thou to save us art too weak.

That kept thine Enemies in awe?
Exert thy power, and all will see
Their Folly, who contend with thee.

Of old our King, and still the same.
What strange Salvation in times past
Has this Land seen, that now lies waste?

Ope'ning a way through which we passed.
On its return the Egyptian host,
Stern as Sea Monsters, all were lost.
Phar'oh and all his Captains drowned
And spewed out, no grave they found,
But in the Bellies of wild Beasts,
And Fowls, which on them made their feasts.

Streams flowed, and showed the power of God:
Again, a flowing Stream does stop,
And a great River's dried up.
Part III.

Of Day and Night, were made by thee:
The proper Light that either needs,
From Sun and Moon by turns proceeds.

Difference of Seasons And of times;
The Summer's heat, and Winter's cold.
That fruitful, this decayed and old:
These Changes wisely ordered were,
So 'are those in our Condition here.

They now blaspheme thy Name aloud.

Mournful yet chaste, thy pity move:
To Birds of prey expose her not,
Though poor, too dear to be forgot.

Can'aan to give and to protect.
Now all its dwellings doleful lie,
With rapine filled and cruelty.

Their prayers and trust in God are vain;
T'a good estate the helpless poor,
That they may praise thy Name, restore,

To plead our cause, since ours is thine;
For these Fools Scoffs at our distress,
Reproach thy Providence no less.

And Tumult of thine Enemies;
Whose Pride, if it unpunished go,
Their insolence will higher grow.
PSALM LXXV.

For his preserving Care:
For that thy powerful help is near,
Thy wondrous works declare.

When settled in my throne,
Disorders then shall be reformed,
And equal Justice done.

The people's Hearts with fear;
The Pillars of the Government
By me supported were.

So madly insolent;

Even Heaven it self they meant.

Nor that, by lucky chance:

Another to advance.

Pours out a dreadful Cup,
Full of strange mixture, and with sad
Ingredients made up.
Some bitter drops the good may taste,
But God reserved has
For wicked men the bottom dregs,
And larger draughts of wrath.

For ever, Lord, thy praise:
And more cut off the wicked's power,
And that of good men raise.
PSALM LXXVI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]
Judah God so well,
Nor his Renown, like Israel.
Jerusalem's his place of rest,
And Sion's with his Presence blessed.





The Sword, and Arm that did it wield.

Art more renowned than Hills of prey.

Themselves a prey to us are made.
Seized with death's sleep, which none withstands
Their mighty men could find no hands,

Both at thy check remained unmoved.

Courage or Conquests to maintain.

And rose to save the meek in haste;

And all their rage becalmed and stilled.

Raises God's praise to a greater height;
All whose remains not yet expressed
Shall at his pleasure be suppressed.

And what you vow with conscience pay:
Let all around their presents bring
TO express their fear of this great King.

He Will humble them, or strike them dead:
Monarchs that to the world give Law,
Before him stand with trembling awe.
PSALM LXXVII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

To God that heard me I renewed:

With hands spread out to him I su'd.

Of God (how kind h' had been before,
And what our Miseries now were)
Disturbed and overwhelmed me more.

Though grief had locked my Lips up fast:

Thy wonders wrought in Ages past.

I made, from former dangers freed;
Debated with my self how well
God's past and present ways agre'ed.

Nor follow us with one kind thought?

And must his promise stand for naught?

That God to show it has forgot?
Or's so provoked, our Miseries
To look on, but regard them not?

In God's Proceedings did appear;
That the hand which formerly did save,
Its strokes should now be so severe.

And wonders I will think upon:

But talk of all that thou have done.
Part II.

Perfectly just and holy are,
Though far above our reach; whose power
And Greatness are beyond compare.

Above all other God's have raised;
The World has seen thy power, so far
Exceeding theirs, and been amazed.

Jacob and Joseph saw: their seed
Beheld the effects of thy strong Arm,
When from the Egyptian bondage freed,

The approach of God, and frighted was;
Fled in such haste, the depths were left
A way, through which on Foot to pass.

The air with noise, thy foes with fears;
Strange Hail, like pointed Stones, came down,
And clatt'ring flew about their ears.

The Lightnings in their faces flashed;
And whilst the Earth trembled and shook,
The amazed People stood abashed.

A path, which none before had trod;
And none, with all their utmost skill,
Can trace the Footsteps of our God.
Moses and Aaron led thy Flock
With tender care and gentle hand;
And fed them in the desert, till
They came unto the promised Land.
PSALM LXXVIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]


But Passages of old remark,
Passing all skill in riddles dark.

Have surely been conveyed down;

But to after Ages will transmit.
That they may learn God's power to praise
For wondrous works of former days.

We should acquaint the Race behind;


His Works, which powerful Motives are
TO observe his precepts with due care.

For which their stubborn Fathers fell:
Whose Hearts were not prepared to obey,
Or if inclined, soon fell away.
Ephraimites well armed with bows,
Like Cowards fled before their foes;

His Guidance, and his Covenant brake.

The works they knew his hand had done:

In Egypt, by their Fathers seen.

And through it on dry ground they pass;
The fluid Waters swell and stand
Like a firm wall on either hand.
Part II.

Both night and day their way it showed.

And thirsted drink in Plenty gave.

After them in their Travels went.

Which durst even in that desert sin.

By a new proof his Power they tried;
Meat now, not for their want, they crave,
But such as wanton Lust would have.

Both of God's Power and of his Care;
"In such a desert what loud call
"Can bring in food to feast us all?

"Which lodged perhaps within before;
"But can he Bread enough bestow
"Here, where no corn did ever grow?
"Can Flesh be had for all to eat?
"Their hunger had not need be great.



Whose food was of a wondrous sort:
He made the Clouds his Granary,
Well filled with Stores for their supply.

Manna showered down on every side:
Heavens Corn was Diet ready dressed,

Part III.

Shamed their distrust, and showed his power.

A Cloud of Quails which thither flew.

Rained on their Camp as thick as Dust;
And round their Tents the heaped store,
Lay pil'd like Sand on the Seashore.

Their Longings they a while enjoyed:



Make them sin less, or trust God more.

These sinners did consume their Days.

And sought God's favor to regain:

When the High God was their defense.

Would their Hypocrisy disguise:

Their hearts were false and unsincere.

Those who deserved not to live:
His Anger often away he turned,
Or else with gentle flame it burned.

Moulder ever long and turn to dust:
Or like a blast of wind, when it is over,
Vanishes and returns no more,

The Desert, and repeat their sin.

And to God's Power will set new bounds.

What mighty things his hand had done;
What time the Tyrants cruel yoke
Of Bondage from their Necks he broke.
Part IV.
Egyptians sent,
Through Phar'oh's Court and City went.

None its polluted Streams could drink.

Sent to destroy to vex and wound.

Thick Clouds of Locusts came and spoiled

By Hail destroyed, and unknown Frost.

Their Flocks and Cattle in the Field.

As Tokens of God's wrath severe:
At length he evil Angels sent,
Sad Messengers of Punishment.

All Lives were made an easy prey

Of Beasts, and Children they begot.
The flower of youth one day did see
Cut off from Cham's Posterity.

And led like sheep the way he taught.

And saw their foes o'erwhelmed there.

To Sion, won by his strong hand.

And in their room his Tribes he plants:
The Land divides to each by Lot,
And settles them in what they would got.

His Anger, whilst his Laws they slight:

And all their promises are lies.
In every crooked path they would go,
Starting aside like a false bow:

And hateful Images erect.
Part V.

And greatly did his People loath.
Shiloh's Tent, where he had stayed,
Which never more his presence had.

Was carried Captive by their Foes:

When God provoked his care withdrew.

Their maids no nuptial Garlands crowned:

All public wailings did forbear.

When Sleep or Wine his senses binds;
But waking calls to Arms and shouts;

Their hinder parts he deeply wounds,
And with perpetual shame confounds.

To Ephraim's Tribe where 'twas before;
Judah's Tribe and Sion chose,
A place beloved, for its repose.

Fixed like the Earth for ever fast.
David choose,

Took him his Israel to keep,
With equal care he would done his sheep.

Designing what was good and just:
His Skill to govern was no less
Attended still with good Success.
PSALM LXXIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

The Heathen spoils thine Heritage:
Thy Temple's made profane and cheap,
Thy City turned to a ruined heap.

To every ravenous Bird and Beast:

Enough scarce live to interr the dead.

We meet from all reproach and scorn.

Thy Jealousy that burns like fire?

Who neither know nor thee invoke:

Our City, and our Land laid waste.

Nor how provoking we have been:
But let thy tender Mercies now
Prevent our ruin, though brought low.

Pass by, and send Deliverance.

Where Is now their God to whom they pray?
Oh may they know thee and their guilt,
By thy revenge for Blood they have spilt.

Save those, whom they have condemned to die.

Which we for thy sake, Lord, have born.

And future Ages sing thy Praise.
PSALM LXXIX.
[Another Meter.]

Invade thine Heritage:
Thy Temple's made profane and cheap,
Thy City' a ruined heap.

To ravenous Birds and Beasts.

Their Blood's like water shed.

We Are made their sport and scorn.

Thy wrath that burns like fire?

Let thy fierce anger stay:

Our Walls, and Land laid waste.

Visit not our past sin.
But let thy Mercy, though brought low,
Prevent our ruin now.

And send Deliverance.

Why should the Heathen say?
By thy revenge for Blood they have spilt,
They Will know God and their guilt.

Moved by the Prisoners cry.

We for thy Sake have born.

And thee all Ages praise.
PSALM LXXX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]
Jacob's Race,
And Joseph's wondrous Guide, give ear:
Thou sitt'st between the Cherubins,
Thence gloriously for us appear.
Ephr'aim, with the other Tribes once saw
Thy Conquests in the wilderness:
Now show thy self, that they may know
Thy saving Power is still no less.

Unto thy favor, Lord, restore:
For if our God be reconciled,
We shall be saved and sigh no more.

Our prayers, when we thy help entreat?

Tears that are mingled with our meat.

Strive only who shall spoil us most;
Laugh at our trust in God, too weak
They think, to oppose the powers they boast,

Unto thy favor, Lord, restore;
For if our God be reconciled,
We shall be saved and sigh no more.
Part II.
Egypt thou have brought a Vine,
Transplanted hither by thine hand:

Might farther spread and fill the Land.

Its boughs over goodly Cedars stretched:

As far as to Euphrates reached.

By every spoiler's hand are pressed:

Devoured by every savage Beast.

Visit this Vine forsook so long;

Thou made for thy self so strong.

Has burnt already what is cut down;
And what remains will be consumed,
If God continue still to frown.

And send him thine Almighty aid;
Whom zealous for thine Honor, thou,
And strong for our defense, have made.

If thou will us again revive;
But worship thee and never cease,
To praise thy Goodness, whilst we live.

Unto thy favor, Lord, restore;
For if our God be reconciled,
We shall be saved, and sigh no more.
PSALM LXXXI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

With joyful and triumphant Songs;

Sweet Instruments Harmonious noise.

Proclaim the solemn Feast around:

By Jacob's God to Jacob's Seed:

Of their remove from Egypt's Land:
Who after heard with fear and awe
God's unknown Voice, that gave the Law.

His Hands from sordid works released.

My help, and I as often saved.
The thundering Cloud that terrified
The Egyptians, was your Light and Guide.
You proved at Meribah's famed spring
My Power, and I your murmuring.

If they will hear and do my will.

Nor worship any God but me.

Which brought thee out of Egypt's Land;
Open thy Mouth, though never so wide,
Thy longings shall be satisfied.
Israel would not hear my Voice,
Nor make their God their only choice;

By Counsels of a Mind depraved.

And with his wise Advice complied;

His Hand have all their force repelled.

Been glad to flatter and submit:
While he his people would have blessed,
With never-failing Peace and Rest.

The finest wheat for food to yield:
And with the sweet refreshment filled,
Of Honey from the Rock distilled.
PSALM LXXXII.
[As the 113 Psalm.]

God's Name, and represent him here,
Know that this Judge among you sits.

Or countenance a wicked cause,
Your Guiltiness no plea admits.

The poor, and your assistance lend
To helplese Men that justice crave,

Obnoxious only by their need,
And from the Oppressor's power save.

Who Will know no other Right but gain,
Whose Eyes are blind by Bribes you take.
Thus Justice cannot find its course,
But Laws neglected lose their force,
And all the Land s Foundations shake.

And fall, though Sons of the most High,

Arise, great Judge of all, and reign,
Fallen Justice then will rise again,
When God does sit upon his Throne.
PSALM LXXXIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

An unconcerned Spectator be;
Nor, deaf to all our loud requests,
Without regard our ruin see.

And a tumultuous noise they make:

They lay, and crafty counsels take.

Unless the Nation perish quite;
So that no memory may remain
Nor mention of an Israelite.



And to subvert the Government.
Midian's Army's Fate be theirs,
Their fall like that of Sisera,
Or Jabin's Host by Kison's Streams
Discomfited and swept away.

Than that of those near Endor killed,
Whose Carkases were spread to rot
Like Dung, and served to enrich the field.

Fly with dishonor, and be taken,
As Zeb and Oreb were, and be
Like Zebah and Zalmunna slain.
Part II.

Thy chosen People to oppress;
And there, where God among us dwells,
Cities and Houses to possess.

No where to rest, or stand their Ground;
But be dispersed, and fly like chaff,
By driving Tempests scattered round.

Hot rays the parched Mountains burn;

And frighted, all their force o'erturn.

In their dejected looks appear;
Cover their face with shame, till they
Thy Favor seek and Power revere.

With trouble, and their fears alarm;
That no more Courage may remain
TO assail, nor Power to do us harm.

That he whom we Jehovah call,
Is the great Ruler of the World,
In Power Superior over all.
PSALM LXXXIV.

Thy Presence, Lord, do grant;

Impatient of restraint.

Enjoy, which I Am denied;
Near to thine Altar they prepare
Their Nests, and there reside.

Thine House, to praise thee still:

Devout affections fill.
Baca's vale
So troublesome and dry:
Whose want of Springs, refreshing showers
By Heaven bestowed supply.

Go on unwearied still;
And all present themselves before
The Lord, in Sion's Hill.

My prayer to thee address;

And thine Anointed bless.

Yield me not such content,
As one Day's freedom in thy House,
And in thy Service spent.
There let me have the meanest place,
And at the Thresh-hold lie;
Rather than all the wicked's State,
Without this Liberty.

We Light and Life derive;
A shield for our defense, and he
Will Grace and Glory give.
No good will he withold from him
That Is upright in his way.

His only trust and stay.
PSALM LXXXV.
[As the 113 Psalm.]

Thy Captives to their Land are come,


Is now removed and flames no more,





Which God will to his Saints express,
If they return to Sin no more.

To such as thee sincerely fear,
And Glory to our Land will bring.

Justice and Peace each other greet:

From heaven shall righteousness look down;

Our Land with Plenty shall o'erslow.

And men should eye his righteous ways,
To trace the steps where he does go.
PSALM LXXXVI.

Though poor and in the dust:

In thee alone I trust.

And hear my mournful voice.

Oh make it to rejoice.

To pardon sins inclined;
And all that humbly thee implore,
Shall plenteous mercy find.

In hope thou will attend:

A gracious Answer send.

And talk of Powers Divine;
There Is none that can compare with thee,
Nor any Works like thine.

Their Maker shall adore;
Shall glorify thy Name, O Lord,
And celebrate thy Power.

What Wonders thou have done;
Their Idols they will disown, and say,
That thou art God alone.
Part II.

Of Truth I never may err;
My loose affections so unite,
That I thy Name may fear.
With all my Soul I'II praise the Lord,
His Glories ever tell;

Freed from the lowest Hell.

O God, against me rise;
They seek my Life, and have no fear
Of thee before their Eyes.

To punish Sinners slow;
Goodness and Faithfulness from thee
Abundantly do flow.

And strength from thee I crave:
From all designed mischiefs, Lord,
Thy helpless Servant save.

Which all my Foes may see,
And at their Malice blush; when thou
Do help and comfort me.
PSALM LXXXVII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

For Beauty and for Strength is great:
Jacob's dwellings hates,
But none so loves as Sion's Gates.

Thy Glories are without compare;
Of thee alone it can be told,
God here his Residence does hold.




and Babylon may show,
(And so may other Countries too)
Some single worthy, who derived
His Birth from them, and where he lived.
vast numbers can return,
Of great and good men in her born;
Whose flourishing estate, she is sure,
God by his care, will still secure.

The Nations Register; how sew
Noted for Goodness will he place
Upon the account of Heathen Race?
has many such enjoyed,
Though in lower services employed:
They one another here succeed,
As Streams still flow which Springs do feed.
PSALM LXXXVIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

To thee I cry, to thee I pray:

In Mercy my Petitions grant.

I dwell next door unto the Grave.

I Am given over by all for gone.
Shut up from all Society,
Among the Dead I Am only free:
Forgot like those in Battle slain,
Like Families without remain.

Which, deep and dark, resembles Hell:

Troubles, like Waves, come on so fast.

I Have no converse with those I loved:
Others to see me have no mind,
To such a loathsome place consigned.

Who can do nothing here but weep;
Only my fervent cries implore
Thine aid, when I can weep no more.
Part II.

Shall they, to praise thee, raise their Head?

What Truth, when men destroyed are?

Or Righteoushess, where all is forgot?

My Prayers the morning Light prevent.

Why frown'st thou on my Misery?

Ever since mine Age was young and green




From which if no release I find,
Thy Terrors will distract my Mind:

Death only must conclude my woes.

Environ me on every side;
The Waves together met, in haste
Will swell, and swallow me at last.

Is hopeless, all so far removed;
And all, who my acquaintance were,
Are lost, or hide themselves for fear.
PSALM LXXXIX.

The Mercies of the Lord;
To all make known how true he is,
And constant to his Word.

On firm foundations stay;
And sooner than thy Promise fail,
The Heavens shall move away.
When God his servant David chose,
To govern Israel;
his Covenant with him he made,
And by his Oath did seal:
The Throne I give thee, on thy feed
"For ever I entail;
"Which though thrown down, yet I again
"To raise it will not fail.

With praises to proclaim,
The Heavenly Angels sacred Quire
Shall celebrate the same.

Nor his Commands contest;

With awful fear possessed.
Part II.

Or girt with Truth like thee;

And still the raging Sea.
Egypt's power,
And Israel did adore,
When they beheld the drowned Host
Lie scattered on the shore.

Made by thy powerful voice:

Which in thy Care rejoice.

Can no resistance fear:

In all thy Rule appear.

The joyful sound of Praise:
They, through thy Favor shall enjoy
An Age of happy Days.

Will fresh delights create;

Wilt raise their low estate.
Part III.

Of Israel ever blessed:

His mind of old expressed.
"I Have found a Man of worth and might
"For your Deliverer;
"One from among the People chose,
"I for your King prefer.
"David, my Servant, to receive
"This Honor I appoint;
"Go then, and to this Office him
"With Holy Oil anoint.

TO assist him in distress:

Nor spightfullest oppress.

Broken in pieces see;
And all that hate him, by my power
Plagued and destroyed shall be.

My Favors on him shower;
And whilst he trusts in me, will raise
And still enlarge his power.
His Empire, by his Victories,
Shall far and wide extend;

For safety shall depend.

In highest Honor placed:

My Covenant shall stand fast.

From failing I Will secure;
The Regal Power therein shall last
While the Heavens do endure.
Part IV.
David's sons mind not my Law,
Nor in my Judgments walk;

Of Life, profanely balk.

Severely they shall smart:

Nor from my word depart.

To David's Royal blood:

My Truth shall still make good.

While the Sun shines shall last;

Stand in her Orb more fast.

Thy dealings with thy word?
Wroth with our King, he is now by thee
Rejected and abhorred.
David thou had made
A Covenant in vain;
His Honor's trampled under foot,
His Crown is made profane.

His Forts in ruins laid;

To every Spoiler made.

Their easy Victories:

Assailing Enemies.

His Kingdoms state overthrown:

Has sullied his renown.
Part V.

By thee neglected mourn?
Till we are utterly consumed,
Lord, shall thine Anger burn?

At best, to live we have:
Shall it be said we are made for naught
But sorrow and a Grave?

When none's so firm and strong,
But he must fall into the Grave,
And yield to Death ere long?
Lord, what is become of that old Love
Thou did to David bear?
To whom for ever to be kind
Thou faithfully did swear?

The mighty Peoples scorn:
I easier all my other griefs
Than their reproach have born.

Thy Promise they intend;
As if with David's ruined house
His Kingdom now should end.

And praise thee, though oppressed:
And evermore will say, Amen,
Amen, the Lord be blessed.
PSALM XC.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Thou have our help and refuge been.

Or ever thou had formed the Earth;
Thou had a being long before,
And shall abide when time's no more,

Bidding him Turn again to Dust.

In life so long, is but a day
Compared with thee, and in thy sight
Like the short watches of the night.

Sweeps us away; our Life's a Dream.

Cut down era night and withered are.



As swiftly as a Breath or Thought.

If to another stage we get,
And unto Fourscore years arrive,
We rather sigh and groan, than live.
Part II.

Thought on the terrors of thy wrath?
Wrath that is equal to our dread,
And strikes so often sinners dead.

The uncertainties this Life attend,
May more excite our fear of thee,
And a wise care of Piety.

When will thou give our troubles ease?
Now we are humble and repent,
Show pity to us, and relent.

We long impatiently to taste:

Let Gladness crown our future years.

And please thee most; do thou appear
In these to us and to our Race:

Afford thy Light to guide our way,
That we may never go astray:
All our good undertakings bless,
And prosper with desired success.
PSALM XC.
[Another Meter.]

Thou have our Refuge been.

Or thou had formed the Earth,
Thou wast, when nothing was before,
Wilt be, when time's no more.

Thou said, Return to Dust.

One Day to thee appears;
As the short watches of the Night,
Which slept away, we slight.

We vanish like a dream.
Ere Night, thus flowers in the morning fair
Cut down and withered are.



Swift as a Breath or Thought.

If forward still we get,
And unto Fourscore years arrive,
We rather sigh than live.
Part II.

Thought on thy powerful wrath?
Wrath that is equal to our dread,
And ost strikes sinners dead.

And sense of our last end,
May more excite our fear of thee,
And care of Piety.

When give our troubles ease?
Now we are humble and repent,
Show pity, and relent.

Our longing souls would taste:

Joys crown our future years.

Thy Glory; Lord, appear

Show us thy beauteous Face.
Afford thy Light to guide our way,
Never to go astray:
All our good undertakings bless,
And prosper with success.
PSALM XCI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Has gained a safe and quiet Seat:
For God's o'er-spreading Providence
Will, like a shade, be his defense.

On him, my powerful God, rely.

He Will save thee from the secret Snare.

His faithful Promise be thy Shield:

Shall seize thee with a sudden fright.

And all a-round with Slaughter fill,
Walking unseen both night and day,
Shall miss their aim, or balk their way.

And thou the while unhurt shall stand;

What shall the wicked's portion be.
Part II.

Thy Refuge and Security;

No plague thy dwelling shall infest.

To thee shall kind attendance pay.

Lest thou should stumble to thy hurt.

Tread the Asp and Dragon under feet.

From danger I will set him free.
Because he knows and fears my Name,
I Will honor him and raise his Fame.

I Will hear and answer him with speed.
When he is in trouble I Will stand by,
To save, and set him up on High.

Will show him my Salvation.
PSALM XCI.
[Another Meter.]

Has gained a quiet seat;
For God's o'er-shadowing Providence,
Will be his safe defense.

On him my God rely.

When Plagues infect the Air.

His Promise be thy Shield:

Seize thee with sudden fright.

And all with slaughter fill;
Walking unseen both Night and Day,
Shall miss, or balk their way.

Whilst thou, unhurt, shall stand;

Only thine Eyes shall see,
Part II.

For thy security;

Nor plague thy House infest.

Will kind attendance pay:

From stumbling to thy hurt.

Tread Lions under feet.

From harm I Will set him free.
Because he knows and fears my Name
I will advance his Fame,

I Will answer him with speed.
In straits, to save him, I Will be nigh,
And set him up on high.

Bring him to Heaven at last.
PSALM XCII.

To praise the Lord above:

His Faithfulness and Love.

With an harmonious voice:

Have made me to rejoice.

Contain the deepest sense;

Thy ways of Providence.

With good success o'erjoy'd;
And only grow to be mown down,
And utterly destroyed.


All shall be ruined and dispersed
That work Iniquity.

Thou, Lord, wilt thine employ;
And crown that Power and Dignity,
With undisturbed Joy.

My ruin had combined;
To see them stripped of all their power,
And their own mine find.'

Or stately Cedars grow;

With Springs that ever flow.

And still more fruit shall bring:
Age that makes other things decay,
Makes them more flourishing.

To be both Good and Just,
No falseness can be charged on him
Who is my Rock and Trust.
PSALM XCIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Puts on his Robes of glorious Light;
Tremble, thou Earth, when he appears
Clothed and girt about with Might.
Under his Rule the unquiet World
Will gain stability and peace:

And like himself can never cease.

In Tumults and Commotions rise;
Like troubled Waters of the Sea,
That bid defiance to the Skies.

That Is far above your threatening noise;
For even the Seas unruly waves,
Do calmly listen to his voice.

So all thy Promises are sure:
It Is thy Perfection to be true,
And theirs that serve thee to be pure.
PSALM XCIII.
[Another Meter.]

With Robes of glorious light;
Tremble, thou Earth, when he appears
Girded about with Might.
Now the unquiet World will gain
Stability and Peace:

Himself can never cease.

Combined in Tumults rise;
Like Waters of the Sea, that bid
Defiance to the Skies.

That Is far above your noise;
For even the Seas unruly Waves
Are calmed at his voice.

Tny Promises are sure;
Thy Glory's to be true, and theirs
That serve thee, to be pure.
PSALM XCIV.

At length thy Justice show;

Rewards that are their due.

And boast their Villainies;

And Providence despise?



Or else regards it not.

These senseless Fools be wise?

And see, that formed the Eyes?

And teaches Man his skill:
Shall not he know then, and chastise
Thy disobedient Will

Impieties maintain:
God knows these very thoughts of thine
How false they are and vain.

By chastisements have taught;
And thereby to a sense of thee,
And of his duty brought.

From Troubles set him free;
Whilst Vengeance ruins wicked men's
Short-lived prosperity.
Part II.

May under Troubles groan;
God will not utterly forsake,
Nor cast away his own.

Again to act its part;
And then Felicity shall crown
The men of upright Heart.

To other aids in vain;

I and my hopes had lain.

Thy Mercy me upheld:

And swelling passions quelled.

Of unjust Thrones abett?
Who under forms of Law, t'oppress
The Righteous power get?

That such men's Lives they will have;
And whom their Sentence does condemn,
No Innocence can save.

The Lord is my defense;
He Will be my Refuge to secure
Me from their Violence.

Their ruin shall confess:
For God will surely cut them off
In their own wickedness.
PSALM XCV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And to the Lord our voices raise:

With thankful Hearts and Psalms of praise.

Of mighty Power and eminent
Above all Gods: him Angels serve,
And Princes only represent.

And strength of Hills are in his Hand.

And for their Bound prepared dry Land.

And humble Adorations give:

The Sheep that on his Pastures live.

And not such hardened Sinners prove;

Provoked and tempted God above.
They proved his Power, and saw his Works,

Till, wearied with their murmurings,
That Race he could no longer bear.
He did their stupid Unbelief,
And base Ingratitude detest;

They should not come into his Rest.
PSALM XCV.
[Another Meter.]

To God our voices raise:

And loudly sing his Praise.

In Power eminent
Above all Gods: him Angels serve,
And Princes represent.

Of Hills are in his Hand;

And, for their Bound, dry Land.

And Adorations give;

That on his Pastures live.

Such hardened Sinners prove;

Provoked God above.
They proved his power, and saw his works,

Tell, wearied with that murmuring Race,
He could no longer bear.
He did their unbelief and base
Ingratitude detest:

Not come into his Rest.
PSALM XCVI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

To sing the choicest Psalm of Praise.

And all his saving Works proclaim.

His Wonders to the Nations show:

More feared than any Deity.

Our Lord both The Earth and Heavens made.

In Beauty and in Strength excels.

Glory and Power to God ascribe:

Their Offerings in his Courts renew.
There fall down humbly and confess

Let all the Earth the Lord revere,
And by their Duty show their fear.

A Judge that Equity maintains:
He Will make their Wars and tumults cease;
And bless the World with quiet peace.

The Ocean by its roaring noise:

Trees by the Fruits that crown their tops.

And only Sinners are afraid:
All whom he judges will confess,
His Equity and Righteousness.
PSALM XCVI.
[Another Meter.]

To a new Song of praise:

His saving Works proclaim.

To all his wonders show.

More than all God's be feared.

Our Lord, the Heavens made.

His Strength and Beauty are.

Glory to God ascribe.

Whose Courts your Offerings claim.

The Beauty' of Holiness.
Let all the Earth the Lord revere,
Let Duty show their Fear.

A Judge that Right maintains:
He Will make their Wars and Tumults cease,
And bless die World with Peace.

Seas by their roaring noise.

Trees by their fruitful tops.

Sinners alone afraid.
All whom he judges shall confess
His Truth and Righteousness.
PSALM XCVII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]


And cloud his ways of Providence;
Yet perfect Justice is their ground.


A dreadful Fire before him goes,
To burn up all his Enemies.
The Amazed Earth sees this and quakes;


And men below his Glories own.

That to a graven Image bow,
And boast of Idols: worship him
Angels above and gods below.

When Judgments on these Sinners fall;

And thou art high above them all.

Strictly preserve your Innocence;
Then though the wicked seek your fall,
God will stand up in your defense.

For truly pious men are sown:
A joyful Harvest will at length
Their Labors and their Sorrows crown.

The God you serve is good and kind:
Praise him for all his Mercies past,
And wait with joy for those behind.
PSALM XCVII.
[Another Meter.]


And cloud his ways of Providence,
Yet Justice is their ground.

Do flame around the Skies:

Up all his Enemies.
The Earth sees this and quakes, the Hills


And men his Glories own.

That to an Image bow,
And boast of ldols: worship him
Angels and gods below.

Shall on these Sinners fall;

Art high above them all.

Preserve your Innocence;
Then let the Wicked seek your fall,
God will be your defense.

For pious men are sown;
A joyful Harvest will at length
Their Works and Sorrows crown.

The God you serve is kind;
Praise him for Mercies past, and wait
With joy for those behind.
PSALM XCVIII.

What Wonders he has done:
Let all proclaim the Victories,
His powerful Arm has won.

A secret and enclosed;
Now to the clear and open view
Of Heathens is exposed.

Was first to Israel shown;
But now the Ends of the Earth have seen
His great Salvation.



To testify their Joys.

The Joys of neighboring Lands;

And Rivers clap their Hands.

When God's approach is nigh:
Who comes to judge and rule the World
With Truth and Equity.
PSALM XCIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Between the Cherubins does sit;
Let the Earth quake, and fear possess
The People that inhabit it.
Sion dwells, is great,
And high above all People raised:

Adored be and ever praised.

And Justice mixed, will do all right;
He governs always by these Rules:
Mercy and these are his delight.

And prostrate at his Footstool, show
Your low submission to your God,
As he is Holy this is due.
and other famous men
Of old, thus their Addresses made;
Before the Lord fell down; and he
Gave gracious Answers when they prayed

They understood from thence his Will;
His Testimonies they observed,
And all his Orders did fulfill.

And was propitious for their sake
To great Offenders, upon whom
Just Vengeance he began to take.

And at his holy Hill fall down;
By this submission show, that you
His Holiness and Greatness own.
PSALM C.

To God their cheerful voices raise;

Before his Face with Songs of praise.

Did to us all our Beings give:
We are the People of his care,
The Sheep that on his Pastures live.

His Praises in his Courts proclaim:
And by his powerful love inflamed,
Delight to bless his sacred Name.

His Mercy is for ever sure;
And every changing Age shall see
His Truth will still the same endure.
PSALM C
[Another Meter.]

Their cheerful voices raise;

His Face with Songs of praise.

To all their Beings give;
We are his People, and the Sheep
That on his Pastures live.

His Praises there proclaim:
And by his Love inflamed, delight
To bless his sacred Name.

His Mercy ever sure:
And every changing Age will see
His Truth the same endure.
PSALM CI.
[As the 113 Psalm.]

That mercy, which has made me King'

Thy perfect Law the guide I Will make
Of all my ways, and none shall take
Example by me to be worse.

Served by ill projects, shall not bend
The Laws against the Rule of Right.

Ungodly Counsels to suggest,
shall never be my Favorite.

Nor on the proud vouohsafe to look,
Unless to note him for disgrace:

And unsuspected Honesty,
Shall be advanced to highest place.

By lies and little arts grow great,
Or be in mine Affairs employed.

But wicked Doers by my care
Shall from God's City be destroyed.
PSALM CII.

Of mine afflicted state;

Before it be too late.

Mine anguish is so great:
My Bones are not unlike an Hearth,
Parched and dry with Heat.

And flag like withered Grass;
Mine appetite to food's so lost,
My meals I Over-pass.

Can do but sigh and groan:
So wasted is my flesh, I Am lest
Nothing but skin and bone.

In deserts out pf sight;
I sadly to bemoan my self,
In solitude delight.

Sits without company;
And spends the night in dolesul cries,
Lives such a life as I.

My miseries to scorn;
So set against me with mad rage,
My ruin they have sworn.

Are tasted with my Bread:
And with my Drink are mixed the tears
I plentifully shed.

Does not remit at all:
By dashing all the hopes thou'st raised,
I Have had the sorer fall.
Part II.

Make haste, and fly away:
As Flowers before the scorching Sun,
They wither and decay.

The same thou ever wast;
And the memorial of thy Truth
Shall to all Ages last.
Sion's punishment
Prefixed, expiring are:
God's time to favor here is at hand
Her ruins to repair.

Make us her stones to prize;
Her heaps of rubbish and of dust,
Are precious in our Eyes.

Will then thy Name revere:
Sion is restored,
Will gloriously appear.

Their miseries in vain,
Shall then be heard, and their lost state.
And liberties regain.

Shall stand upon record:
And their Posterity, though yet
Unborn, shall praise the Lord.
Part III.

Advanced is so high;
Yet casts on our afflicted state.
A favorable eye.

The groaning prisoners crave;
And those that look upon themselves
As doomed to die, will save.

May in nis Temple raise,
And in Jerusalem aloud
His Truth and Goodness praise.

Shall meet with one accord;
And other Kingdoms join with us
In worshipping the Lord.

Of age and strength had made;
My hopes to see those happy days.
Fell short, and thus I prayed:

My better days be past;
Thine undeclining years beyond
All generations last.

Of old by thee were laid;
The fair and beauteous Heavens show
The work thy hands have made.

Like garments thrown aside;
But though they change, thy years never fail,


Thy word to them is sure:
Though strange events may change the world,
Their Race shall still endure.
PSALM CIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Let all the powers within me bless:

Forgotten in unthankfulness.

He that in sickness makes thee sound:

Thy Life, with Love and Mercy Crowned.

And all thy just desires supplies:
Who, like the Eagles, makes thine Age
To a renewed youth arise.

Oppressed Innocence will find:
and Israel knew his ways,
And kind Intentions of his mind.

Love is his nature and delight:

Intends not to destroy us quite.
His Anger, in its rise and stay,
From Rules Justice never swerves;

The measure's less than sin deserves.

So his Rewards exceed our Love:

His Pardon does our sins remove.
Part II.

Resembles God's, though shorter far;

That only quickened Dust we are.

That in the Field its Beauty; shows;

And then its former place none Knows.

Is to good Men and to their Race:

His favor ever will embrace.

The Lord has placed in Heaven above;
Whose mighty' power and sovereign Rule
Extends over all that live and move.

And ready services transcend:

Who all, to do his Will, attend.

In every place to his control,
Bless ye your Maker; and with them
Join in his Praises, O my Soul!
PSALM CIII.
[Another Meter.]

All powers within me bless:

Lost in unthankfulness.

Thy sicknesses remove:

And crowns thy Life with Love.

Thy just desires supplies;
Who, like the Eagles, makes thine Age
To a new Youth arise.

Wronged Innocence shall find:
his ways and Israel knew
The Intentions of his mind.

His nature and delight.

Would not destroy us quite.
His Anger in its rise and stay
From Justice never swerves:

It Is less than sin deserves.

So his Rewards our Love:

He does our sins remove.
Part II.

Than God's is lesser far:

And knows that Dust we are.

Fresh when its newly blown;

Whose place no more is known.

To good, men and their race:

His favor will embrace.

His Throne in Heaven above:
Whose sovereign Empire does extend
Over all that live and move.

And services transcend:

Who all his Will attend,

Subject to his control,
Bless ye your Maker; and with them
Join in his praise, my Soul.
PSALM CIV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

To this his Greatness does invite;
Honor and Majesty's his Robe;

He, as a Tent, the Heavens extends;

Clouds are his Chariot, and the winds way.
With their winged wheels mete out his

As flames, with quick obedience move;
To publish and effect below
His pleasure, given in charge above.

No Pillars raised its weight to bear;
And yet no Power can make it move,
Though it hangs loose in fluid air.

Whose Waves the highest Hills surpassed:

They shrank, and fled away in haste.

Thence to the lower Vales descend;
Till in the Sea, from whence they came,
At last their winding courses end.

Threatens again the Earth to cover;
Its fixed bounds no rising Tides,
Without new leave, can ever pass over,
Part II.

Causes the crystal Springs to burst;

And the wild Asses, quench their thirst.

Their Nests in shady boughs to raise;
And by their cheerful Notes reprove
Our silence in our Maker's praise.

For thirst, complain that they 're forgot:
Clouds big with showers on them distill,
And water every barren plot.

Food for all Creatures does produce;
The Grass springs up to serve the Beasts,
And Herbs for Man's peculiar use.

That makes his Countenance look bright;
Bread, the support of Life; all made
To serve our needs, or our delight.

Need not be watered by our care;
Where Lebanon does highest rise,
Cedars are ever fresh and fair.

Storks for their dwelling choose the Pine;

Conies in Rocks they undermine.
Part III.

Measures the seasons of the year;
And, having run his daily course,
The Sun knows when to set, and where.

It Is Night that brings wild-Beasts abroad:

By hunger taught, seek meat from God.

Crowd to their Dens with hasty flight:

And ends together with the Light.

Created all with wondrous skill.
Thy Blessings, Lord, enrich the Earth,

Whose yielding waves the Ships divide;
There Fishes move of different size;
Leviathan
Does play, and Man's attempts despise.

Thine alms of seasonable food:

They gather, and are filled with good.
Part IV.

The whole Creation needs must mourn;
If he withholds his breath or theirs,
They die, and to their Dust return.

All things with Life and Joy endues;
His powerful word, that made the earth
At first, its face again renews.

God's Glory never can be less:
And what his wisdom made so good,
His favor will delight to bless.

God's dreadful anger to provoke;
Whose Look can cause the Earth to quake,
Whose touch make proudest hills to smoke.

Shall be to praise this mighty Lord:

The sweetest pleasure will afford.

No place or thought regards them more;
Bless thou thy Maker, O my Soul,
Let Heaven and Earth his Name adore.
PSALM CIV.
[Another Metre]

His Greatness does invite;
Honor and Majesty's his Robe,


Whose rooms on waters stay;
Clouds are his chariot, and the winds
Winged wheels mete out his way.

As flames, attend and move,
His pleasure to effect below,
That Is given in charge above.

Its weight no Pillars bear;
Yet none can move it, though it hangs
Loose in the yielding air.

Whose waves the hills surpassed:

They shrank, and fled in haste.

Thence to the Vales descend;
Till in the Sea, whence first they came,
Their winding courses end.

Threatens the Earth to cover;
Its fixed bounds no rising Tides
Can, without leave, pass over.
Part II.

Makes crystal springs to burst;

Drink to allay their thirst.

In shady boughs to raise:
Whose cheerful Notes our silence shame
In our Creatour's praise.

For third, say they are forgot:
Clouds big with showers on them distill,
And water every plot.

Does food For all produce;
The grass springs up to serve the beasts,
And herbs for humane use.

That makes his face look bright:
Bread, the support of Life; all serve
Our needs, or our delight.

unwat'red by our care:
Cedars in the heights of Lebanon,
Are ever fresh and fair.

Dwells in the losty Pine;

In Rocks they undermine.
Part III.

The seasons of the year;
After his daily course, the Sun
Knows when to set, and where.

Night brings wild Beasts abroad:

And seek their meat from God.

They crowd with hasty flight:

And finished with the Light.

All made with wondrous skill:
Thy Blessings, Lord, enrich the Earth,

There go the Ships, and there do move
Fishes of different size;
Leviathan does play;
And Man's attempts despise.

Of seasonable food;

And all are filled with good.
Part IV.

All Creatures needs must mourn;
If he withholds their breath, they die,
And to their Dust return.

All things with Life endues,
His powerful word, that made the Earth,
Its face again renews.

God's fame will never be less;
And what his wisdom made so good,
Will still delight to bless.

God's anger to provoke;
Whose Look can cause the Earth to quake,
His Touch make Hills to smoke.

To praise this mighty Lord;

The sweetest Joys afford.

No place regards them more;
Bless thou the Lord, my Soul, his Name
Let Heaven and Earth adore.
PSALM CV.

And call upon his Name;
His gracious and his mighty works
To all the world proclaim.

Our great Creator bless;
And what his powerful hand has wrought,
Our joyful tongues express.

And bear his sacred Name;
And when you worship this great Lord,
Take pleasure in the same.

Your Prayers to him be made;
Your hopes upon his favor rest,
And his almighty aid.

Your admiration move;
Think on the judgments of his mouth,
And wonders of his Love.

Of faithful Abr'am's race;
And Jacob's, Offspring called, who stood
In God's especial Grace.

Us for his people owns;
Whose Judgments make the amazed Earth
To tremble when he frowns.

He ever called to mind;
And will his Promises fulfill,
To ages still behind.
Part II.

With our first fathers made;

And to their seed, thus said.
Can'an's Land bestow,
(This which we now possess)
To bring them into which, his Care
Showed that he meant no less.

One family they were;
Whose number too was very few,
And they mere strangers there:

No fixed Estate enjoyed;
But forced from this to the other Land,
Might soon have been destroyed:

When Sojourners they were;
But Kings, that meant to do them wrong,
Met with rebukes severe.

So dear to God, and great:
"Touch not, said he, my anointed ones,
"Nor Prophets rudely treat.

A famine long prevailed:
And Bread, the great support of Life,
When Corn was wanting, failed:
Joseph to provide
For Jacob, now grown old:
But he that was to save his house,
First as a Slave was fold.
Part III.
Egypt brought, and falsely charged,
Joseph's in prison cast:
The Calumny more pained him, than
The Chains that held him fast.

Great fame he had acquired:
This Phar'oh hearing, tried him too,
And found him one inspired.

Him Ruler of the Land:

He' entrusted in his hand.

And punish he had leave;
All the wise Senators from him
Instructions must receive.
Jacob's house to Egypt came
As Phar'oh did invite:

In Number and in Might.

Those they received with joy:
Whom first by subtle Arts they would
Diminish, then destroy.
and A'ron ( when God saw
Their Bondage heavier grow)
Were sent to Phar'oh with demand
To let his people go.

And wonders in that Land;
Showed that what ever they said or did
Was by Divine command.
Part IV.

Over all Egypt drew;
In which, and all the other plagues,
God's Orders they pursue.

Which all their Fish destroyed:

And the King's rooms annoyed.

Over all the Country came:

Mixed with devouring Flame.

Their pleasant Fruits beat down,
But all the Fig trees too and Vines
Were broke and overthrown.

Of various Locusts pass

Devoured their Herbs and Grass.

Smote by an Angel, dye;
The prime of all their strength, and prop
Of every Family.
Part V.
Egypt's wealth, their Land
In haste the people quit;
Not one in all their Tribes so weak,
For travel was unfit.

The Egyptians hearts did fill;
For fear, as the last Plague their Sons,
The next themselves might kill.

The scorching Sun by day;
But was so bright withal, it served
By night to show their way.

For that vast multitude;
Great flights of Quails, and Bread showered down
From Heaven to be their food.

Whence Streams gushed out so fast,
They ran, and followed them through all
The parched grounds they passed.

His word to Abr'am, wrought:

With joy and triumph brought.

In Can'an's pleasant Land;
Stored with all good by others pains,
And planted to their hand.

And blessed so many ways;
His Laws they might with care observe;
The Lord for ever praise.
PSALM CVI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

That God is good to all proclaim:
Whose Mercies shown to ages past,
To all succeeding times shall last.

Or praise his wonders to their worth?

In righteous works employed are.

God always good to me and kind:
When thou deliv'rest thine elect
From Dangers, do not me neglect.

And share in their felicity;
And when thou do their state advance,
Glory with thine Inheritance.

Of fathers that great sinners were:

In Egypt wrought, or soon forgot.
Their unbelief when newly saved,
At the Red Sea fresh wonders craved.

Gave them a new deliverance.

He checked, by his word's greater force:
Their way through the vast Deep was dry,
Such as through sandy deserts lie.

He gained a noble victory.
Phar'oh's Host
With violence, and all were lost.
Part II.

And for a while believed his word.

And would not for his counsel wait.

Tempting God's power, for flesh they cried.

Which prove their plague, not nourishment.
Moses then they mutiny,
And question his Authority:
Both him and A'ron, whom God chose,
As proud Usurpers they oppose.
Dathan cleave,
And with an open mouth receive
Abiram' s Troop: alive they fall,
And in one Grave are buried all.

Invaders of the Priesthood, slew.
Horeb too they made,
And worship to an Image paid.

And wrought such wonders, now they flight;
An Image better pleasing was
Of a dull Ox that eats grass.

The wondrous works in Egypt seen,
Phar'oh's Host,
All these are now forgot and lost.

He threatened to destroy them quite:
When Moses in the breach did stand,
And stayed the vengeance of his hand.
Part III.

Though to the Borders of it brought;
They the ill report some Spies had made
More credit, than what God had said.

And when he said, Go up they would stay.

These Rebels never should come there,
Nor the despised Land possess,
But perish in the Wilderness:

Be slain or scattered up and down.
s service they embrace,
Moab' s vile god, and their disgrace;
With them on Sacrifices fed,
That had been off'red to the dead.

A grievous plague at once broke in:
Phineas, with zeal possessed,
Slew a bold sinner, and it ceast.

Just and praiseworthy God esteemed;
And it obtained this Act of Grace,
T'entail the Priesthood on his Race.
Meribah God's wrath they move,
Where they for Drink with Moses strove;
It went ill with him for their sake,


The Nations out, though charged to do it:

And in their manners were as bad.
Part IV.

To serve their gods and left the true.

Their children with unpitying eyes.

Did all the Land of Can'an stain.

And other beastly lusts, defile.

Whom once he loved, he now does loath



Yet they provoked him still no less;
Their old Idolatries renewed,
Which brought them low, by foes subdued.

He did their Miseries regard;

Left off to punish, and was kind.

He, to take pity on them, moved;
And those by whom they conquered were,
Their extirpation did forbear.

And bring thy scattered people home:
That, praising thee, we ever may,
With greatest joy and triumph, say;
Isr'el's God and King,
"And everlasting Praises sing:
"And may his Saints, with one accord,
"All say, Amen. Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CVII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

So full of kindness and of love.
Whose Mercy ages past have known,
And those that are to come shall crown.

Whom he redeemed when sore oppressed.

From all the Lands to their own home.

They found, nor City where to stay;

Nor water-springs their thirs to assuage.

Who proved their Savior and their Guide:

And place where they should dwell, did show.

His wonders to the Sons of Men;

Their craving hunger satisfies.
Part II.

So nigh to death, they are in its shade;
On whom the sorrows that they bear,
Sit heavier than the chains they wear.

Contemned his Counsels for their good:

To quell the stoutness of their heart.
Before his strokes they could not stand,
Nothing could raise them but his hand.

To importune his Clemency.
Who did regard their low address,
And saved them out of their distress.

And brake their Bands in sunder quite.

His wonders to the Sons of men.

Brake Bars of Ir'n, and Gates of Brass.
Part III.

Prepare for their own punishment.
Sickness and loathsome maladies
From Luxury and Lust arise.

His tastful meats will not go down.
Nature with heavy loads oppressed,
Beckons to Death to be released.

To God for help; whose earnest cry
Moved a regard to their address,
Heaven saved them out of this distress.

Their virtue's not so quick nor sure;
Death's sentence only he repealed,
He sent his word and they were healed.

His wonders to the Sons of men:

Declare his works and their own joys.
Part IV.



And lift its Waves unto the Skies.

They sink into the Depths as often.

Like Drunkards to and fro they reel.

For help in their extremity;
He lends an Ear to their address,
And brings them out of this distress.

The furious waves depose their rage.

The Haven where they wished to be.

His wonders to the Sons of men;

But in the Church his Glories sing.
Part V.

Turns Rivers to a Desert land;

When wickedness therein abounds.

And flowing Springs fair Pastures prove:

Which after to a City grow.

Whose Fruits supply their growing want.

Their wealth increases with their flocks.

They Are punished and brought low again.

And wander in a state forlorn.

And spreads their numerous Family.

And wickedness shall silent be.

These wondrous dealings of the Lord!
But wise Observers still shall find,
That God is infinitely kind.
PSALM CVIII.

And this my Tongue shall raise:

A consort to thy praise.

I Will to the World proclaim:
The scattered Nations shall assist
My Songs to spread thy Fame.

Thy Truth unto the Skies;

Both Earth and Heaven rise.

A Savior in their need;
In answer to my servent prayers
Thy timely succors speed.

My hopes depend on thee;
The Land that round Samaria lies,
Submits it self to me.

To own my righteous cause;
Ephraim's my chiefest strength for War,
Judah supports my Laws.
Moab and Edom as vile slaves
To serve me will be glad;
Philistia meet thy conquering Lord,
And to his triumphs add.

On Edom's Frontiers lies,
So strongly fenced against all assaults,
Which all my force defies?

Refused our Arms to bless;
He Will undertake our Conduct now,
And crown it with success.

Thine aids in trouble meet:
Our Hands shall do great acts; our foes
Lie conquered at our Feet.
PSALM CIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Be thou concerned t'avenge my wrongs:

By lying and deceitful tongues.

They to my Reputation lay;
And unprovoked, with open force
Attempt to take my life away.

Who now mine adversaries are;
I sought not safety by Revenge
When off'red, but of God by prayer.

The more I love I Am hated more.

Thy Justice therefore I implore.
By the worst Judge may he be tried,
And by a Dev'lin spite, accused:

For Pardon, as a sin, resus'd.





His Office let another take:

His wife a forlorn widow make.

By begging up and down maintain:
And their own Houses lying waste,
Seek for a Lodging where they can.
Part II.

Seize his Estate as lawful spoil;
And may a perfect stranger reap
The fruit of all his care and toil.

No pity to his Race be shown:

Be in the following Age unknown.

Since he in sin would like 'em be:

Root out their cursed memory.

Nothing but cruelty did breath;
And when their Hearts were broke with grief,
He persecuted them to death.

To others, on his own head light;
And may he, by a just reward,
Want all that Blessing he did slight.

As in rich Clothes he took a pride;
And may its sad effect, like drink,
Through all his Veins and Bowels slide.

Let it allow him no repose;
Cover him with it like a Vest,
As with a Girdle bind it close.
Part III.

Whose spite is on my ruin bent;
And question not to make it sure,
By Lies and Slanders they invent.

And Mercy too: Lord, take my part:

And pierced with sorrow to the heart.

Tossed, like a Locust, up and down:

My Body lean with fasting grown.

Reproach and all the signs of scorn;

To help and save me thus forlorn.


Let me with joy see them ashamed,
That their attempts had no success.

To hide themselves from their own shame:

The lowdest praises to thy Name.

Will as his Advocate stand by,
Defend his Cause, and save his Life,
When he is unjustly doomed to die.
PSALM CX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Sit thou advanced on my right hand;
Till all thy conquered Foes shall crouch,
And wait their doom from thy command.
Sion shall thy word go forth,
Which like a Scepter thou shall sway:
To bring the Stubborn under Rule,
And make them willingly obey.

The numerous Converts thou shall view,
Shall make an Army that exceeds
Thy Crystal Drops of morning Dew.

By Oath, which he can never break,
To make thee an eternal Priest,
Of the Order of Melchizedeck.

Proud Monarchs that oppose his Reign

That will not stoop to him, be slain.

To mean refreshments in the way;
But with a glorious reward,
God will his sufferings repay.
PSALM CX.
[Another Meter.]

Sit thou on my right hand;
Till all thy Foes shall crouch, and wait
Their doom at thy Command.
Sion shall thy word go forth;
This Scepter thou shall sway:
Under thy Rule shall Rebels come,
And willingly obey.

The Converts thou shall view;
Shall make an Army that exceeds
The drops of morning Dew.

By'an Oath he cannot break;
You Are ever Priest of The Order made
Of great Melchizedeck.

Kings that oppose his Reign

That will not stoop, be slain.

Refreshments in the way:
But God with glorious rewards
His Sufferings will repay.
PSALM CXI.

And with affection join
In those Assemblies, where the Saints
To praise the Lord combine.

Will soon with pleasure see

How great thy Purity.

They Will often call to mind;
With grateful hearts proclaim that God
Is gracious and kind.

Food with a liberal hand:

The Heathens pleasant Land.

His Word no less is sure;

Performance is secure.
from slavery redeemed,
His Holiness did know;
Their foes the terror of his Name
Felt in their overthrow.

And he that strives to please
His Maker, understands him best;
Whose praise shall never cease,
PSALM CXII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Whose pleasure it is to do his Will:

His happy Race shall flourish still.

And as his wealth and stores increase
His bounty is enlarged; no fear
Of future want does make it less.

They Will in his greater comfort end;
What kindness God on him bestows,
The same to others he will extend.

Discreetly orders all his way:

Or make his memory decay.

His confidence in God displace:

His foes securely in the face.

With suitable rewards will crown:
Not only those above bestow,
But honor here and great renown.

With indignation at his bliss;
And melt away with grief, to see
This Man obtain what they shall miss.
PSALM CXII.
[Another Meter.]

And joys to do his Will:

His race shall flourish still.

And as his stores increase,
His bounty is enlarged; no fear
Of want does make it less.

They Will in his comfort end;
What kindness God on him bestows,
To others he will extend.

Discreetly guides his way:

His memory decay.

Of danger can displace:

His Enemies in the face.

With great rewards will crown;
Both those above bestow, and here
Honor and great renown.

With envy at his bliss;
Consume with grief, to see this Man
Obtain, what they shall miss.
PSALM CXIII.

To God your cheerful praises sing,


Where ever the Sun does rise or set,
Since all are blessed, let all adore.

And Heaven's too narrow to contain
His Glories that are infinite.

With his Perfections to compare,
Who dwells in uncreated Light.

The affairs of mortals here below,
As well as those in Heaven above.

He from the dust the poor does raise,
And from his vile estate remove.

To unexpected dignity,
And sets him a royal Throne.

He makes the barren womb to bear:
O therefore praise this God alone.
PSALM CXIV.
[As the 113 Psalm.]
Isr'el's seed
From Egypt and oppression freed,

Whose bright appearance as they passed

Jordan retired unto its spring.
when God came down, did shake,
The adjoining mountains all did quake,
And like affrighted Rams did skip:
The little hills could not forbear
By trembling too to show their fear,
Like Lambs that round their Mothers trip.

Or Jordan its old banks forsake,
So cross to Nature's fixed Laws?

And little hills like frighted Lambs?
Why seems it strange, when God's the cause?

But the whole Earth may quake for fear,
As into strange Convulsions thrown:

And Flints into a Fountain brake,
When God would make his Power known.
PSALM CXV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

But to thy Name the praise we owe;
To thy free goodness and thy truth,
The springs whence all our blessings flow.

Where is the God whom ye adore?

What ever his Will ordained before.

And all their worth derive from thence;
With no Divinity inspired,
Since they are void of life and sense.



Nor lively motion by his art.

A God, to which our knees should bow;
You trust what cannot help it self;
Statues have sense as much as you.
Israel in the living God
Repose your trust and confidence:
He Will help you to subdue your foes;
In dangers he will be your defense.
A'ron's house on God rely;
To you he will be an help and shield;

Whose care and aid will safety yield.

In after times will be no less;
He the house of Israel will save,
The Priests of A'ron's house will bless,

Of low as well as high degree:

On you and your posterity.

By him that made both Earth and Heaven:

In kindness he to Man has given.

Thy wonders; nor proclaim thy praise:

Which shall continue all our days.
PSALM CXV.
[Another Meter.]

We give the praise we owe;
To thy free goodness and thy truth,
Whence all our blessings flow.

That God whom you adore?

What he ordained before.

Their worth derive from thence;
With no Divinity inspired,
Since void of life or sense.



Motion, or Life by art.

To which our knees should bow;
You trust what cannot help it self,
Statues have sense like you.
Israel, in the living God
Repose your confidence;
To quell your foes he will be your help,
In dangers your defense.
A'ron's house on him rely;
He Will be your help and shield:

And aid will safety yield.

In after times no less;
The house of Israel he will save,
The Priests of A'ron's bless.

Of low or high degree:

And your posterity.

That made both Earth and Heaven;

In kindness he has given.

Nor celebrate thy praise:

And bless thee all our days.
PSALM CXVI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

In straits to my requests did give;

And best devotions, whilst I live.

The sad forerunners of the Grave;

My life from threatening danger save.

Nor did his Mercy come too late;

His kindness raised my low estate.

In quiet rest, freed from thy fears;

And dried up all thy falling tears;



All Men will lie, and I Am deceived.

For all tha kindness he has shown?

And thankfully his favors own.

I made to God, shall be my care;

And showed my life to him was dear.

Thy servant whom thou have set free;
The very Bonds that thou have loosed,
Shall tie me faster unto thee.

And God for all his favors bless:
I Will on his goodness wait, and pray
To him alone in all distress.

Religiously I Will pay my vows;

To worship at his holy house.
PSALM CXVI.
[Another Meter.]

To my requests did give,

Devotions whilst I live.

Forerunners of the Grave;

From threatening danger save.

God's Mercy come too late:

He raised my low estate.

Quiet and free from fears;

And dried up all thy tears.



Will lie, and I Am deceived.

The kindness thou have shown?

Will all thy favors own.

To God, shall be my care:

My Life to him was dear.

Thy servant, Lord, I 'll be;
The bonds that thou have loosed, shall tie
Me faster unto thee.

For all his favors bless;
I Will on his goodness wait, and pray
To him in all distress.

To God I 'll pay my vows;

To worship at his house.
PSALM CXVII.

Their great Creator praise;
And all its scatt'red People join
His mighty Name to raise.

His Mercies ever sure:
Then let our praises, like his truth,
For ever still endure.
PSALM CXVIII.

Have known to be so kind;
Whose Mercies will continue sure,
To ages still behind.



His Mercies have no end.

God's goodness to express;
Who heard my Prayer, and set me free
When I was in distress.

Since God does take my part;

When thou my Helper art.

Than on an Host's defense:

I 'll put my confidence.


But to destroy them, I was sure,
Through God's almighty aid.

Their anger flamed, like fire;
But all was like a blaze of thorns,
That quickly does expire.
I knew by his almighty aid
I soon should cut them short;

His help would me support.
Part II

To God, who made me strong;
And his Salvation still shall be
The subject of my Song.

The dwellings of the just;

That in his goodness trust.

Even to my latest breath:

Has saved me still from death.

Which entrance do afford
Into God's Courts for righteous Men,
Where I will praise the Lord.

And all the righteous throng
Shall enter in my company,
And hear this joyful Song.

And though thou wast before
My gracious God, art now become
My powerful Savior.
Part III.

Unfit, aside was thrown;
Is chosen and preferr'ed, to be
The Head and Corner stone.

By us with wonder seen:

And we'll rejoice therein.

And loud Hosanna's sing;
Wishing prosperity may wait
On him that is our King.

On this kind Errand came;
We welcome thee; and bless all those
That spread thy glorious Fame.

On us, with Light and Grace;
And at thine Altar we'll present
The Sacrifice of praise.

Shall ever sing thy praise:
Thou art my God, and I on high
Thy glorious Name will raise.

That God is good and kind;
Whose Mercies which have been before,
Good Men shall ever find.
PSALM CXIX.
Aleph. Part I.

Whose ways are free from blame;
Who, as the Law of God directs,
Their lives and manners frame.

Unseignedly fulfill:
And to obtain God's favor, seek
To know and do his Will.

But to thy paths repair:

All thy Commands with care.

Never from thine to swerve;

All thy Commands observe.

My' unfeigned joy and praise,
That I have learnt how good thy Laws,
How righteous are thy Ways.

In this thy Will is clear;
Stand by me, Lord, as I intend
Herein to persevere.
Beth. Part II.

Govern his Manners, Lord?
By heedfull listening to the wise
Directions of thy word.

O keep me close to thee:

Might not a sinner be,

To thee, who art so kind:
Thy Statutes give me Grace to learn,
And lodge them in my mind.

I have declared around:

That has a Treasure found.

My thoughts, that I may see,
How well with thy prescribed Rules
Of Life, my ways agree.

And hearts delight is set:
Thy word, which I entirely love,
I never will forget.
Gimel. Part. III.

And such defense afford;
That I, preserved from my Foes,
May live and keep thy word.

The Wonders of thy Law:

Must Light and Comfort draw.

So great my Longings are;
The painful Labors I endure,
My Strength does quite impair.

Follow their haughty Pride;
Who from the Path of thy Commands,
Perversely turn aside.

Suffer reproach and shame;
Whose care is to observe thy Laws,
To live without all blame.

These I my Study made:

And always made me glad.
Daleth. Part IV.

And humbled to the Dust:
Revive and raise me up again,
Who in thy Promise trust.

And found God's kind regard;
And in thy Statutes taught, shall find
Safety for my reward.

The way thy Precepts show;
Then all thy Wonders I have seen,
Others shall also know.

His promised Strength denies:

Seeking no help from Lies.

I Have chose my Life to frame;

Lord, put me not to shame.

With great Alacrity;
When I Am enlarged with thy joys,
And from these straits set free.
He. Part V.

Thy Statutes recommend;
Never from thence will I decline,
But keep it to the End.

And knowledge of thy Will;
Then what thy Sacred Laws enjoin,
I Will heartily fulfill.

Where my Contentment lies.

And less this World to prize.

Vain Pleasures here in view;
That in God's way I may persist,
His Favor to pursue.

Devoted to thy Fear:

Whose Judgments gracious are.

I for thy Precepts have.
Revive me for thy Promise sake,
And from these Troubles save.
Vau. Part VI.

And Faithfulness advance;
And let me feel their good effects
In my deliverance.

My Piety disgrace:
I Am not too bold, when in God's Word
My Confidence I place.

Disheartened to assert;
Who trust the Righteous Judge will give
His Sentence on my part.

Observe for ever will:

Thy Precepts to fulfill.

To own I Will not forbear;
But these, as the best Rule of Life,
Boldly to all declare.

My Love to them I Will show:

I Will show my Love is true.
Zain. Part VII.

Lord, to remembrance call:

But cheers me under all.

My Trust in thee their scorn,
Yet have I not declined thy Laws,
Though never so forlorn.

By Good men's trials, made
Them and his Power better known,
And this my Grief allayed.

Of wicked Men I saw;
And what sad Judgments would befall,
Such as forsook thy Law.

More troublesome and long;
But that I thought upon thy Love,
And made thy Laws my Song.

God was, whilst others slept:

For I thy Precepts kept.
Cheth. Part VIII.

I Will keep like precious store:

I earnestly implore.


Resolved to change my course, and turn
Into thy safer way.

And stripped of all I had;
But did not seek to be revenged
By means thy Law forbad.

When others are asleep,
To praise thee for those righteous Laws,
By thee I Am taught to keep.

Tow'ards God religious Fear;
All that with care thy Precepts keep,
To me are truly dear.

Thy Blessings largely fill:
To serve thee as I ought, I beg
Thou would instruct me still.
Teth. Part IX.

Great Blessings have received;

Of what I have believed.

Too soon I turned aside;
But by thy Chastisements reduced,
Thy Precepts were my Guide.

And do all good afford:
By thy wise Methods, make me more
Obedient to thy word.

A cursed Lie to invent;
Who by strict keeping of thy Laws,
Shall prove I Am innocent.

God's Law is my delight:

Thy Precepts not to slight.

Pronounced from Heaven, appear;
The Wealth a Kingdom does contain
Is not to me so dear.
Iod. Part X.

Have fashioned and made;
More of thy Will I Would know, that thou
May be the more obeyed.

All good men will be glad:
And trust thy faithful word, on which
I my dependence had.

And all my Troubles-just:

For in thy Word I trust.

Let thy Compassions save:
Who in obeying thy Commands
The highest Pleasure have.

And falsehood me oppress:
But I will study and observe
Thy Precepts still no less.

Their Duty, take my part:

Sound and upright in heart.
Caph. Part XI.

Thy word fulfilled to see

When will thou comfort me?

So grief has shrivelled mine;
Yet do I not thy Statutes, Lord,
Forget, much less decline.

Do thou delay so long,
TO inflict due Punishments on those
That do me utmost wrong.

My ruin they pursue.

As thy Commands are true.

A Prey to bloody hands;
Yet to escape, I would not balk
The way of thy Commands.

My Life in mercy spare:
Then I thy Testimonies, Lord,
Will keep with greater care.
Lamed. Part XII.

Thy word is settled fast:

Does to all Ages last.

Continue to this Day:
And all like ready Servants stand
Thine Orders to obey.

Thy Law been my delight;
Under the pressure of my woes,
I'had sunk and perished quite.

Which have revived me still:

To know and do thy Will.

Watched for a fit pretense:
But I Will keep close to thy Commands,
As to my best Defense.

Whose End we often outlive:
But thy wise Laws have large extent,
And lasting Pleasures give.
Mem. Part XIII.

My daily exercise;
By thoughts and talk of this, I make
My self and others wise.

Mine Eyes I ever set,
I Am wiser than my Foes, and all
Their subtle Arts defeat.


Because thy Laws my study are,
And I thy Precepts keep.

The means t'obtain my End;
For I resolved against thy word
Not wilfully to offend.

Nor, wronged, did right o'er-pass:
Just Precepts I had learned, and knew
That God their Author was.

Like what thy words create.

Of every Sin to hate.
Nun. Part XIV.

Unto my Paths a Light:

I Will keep with all my Might.

Thy comforts, Lord, afford;
And raise me from this sad Estate,
According to thy word.

My Prayers and Praises own:
To serve thee better, Lord, thy Will
Still more to me make known.


Yet did I not forget thy Law,
Nor from thy Precepts strayed.

Thy Testimonies part:
These are mine Heritage; the Joy
And Comfort of mine heart.

Thy Statutes I intend;
What ever I lose by it, I will hold
This course unto the End.
Samech. Part XV.

And double-dealing hate:

For thy Protection wait.

The World, depart from me:
From faithful serving of my God,
No hind'rance you shall be.

Do not my hopes expose:

In safety from my Foes.

Thy Statutes go astray;
Their crafty Arts to them will prove
A false and cheating way.

Like dross thou will remove;
Therefore I better like, and more
Thy Testimonies Love.

Fills me with fear and awe:
I dread the Judgments that will seize
All that contemn thy Law.
Ain. Part XVI.

My Foes must needs confess:
Leave me not in their hands, whose rage
Knows only how to oppress.

To ruin me prevail:

My tired hopes will fail.

To thee I service owe;

To me more fully show.

As well as he appear;
When wicked men reject his Law,
And sin without all fear.

All his Commands to prize;
And, in compare with them them, the World
And all its Wealth despise.

For my Direction best:
But unjust Courses, and base Arts
I utterly detest.
Pe. Part XVII.

Whose wonders strike mine Eyes:

And makes the simple wise.

I eagerly pursued;
And as my Pleasure did increase,
My longings were renewed.

And Mercy be the same,
Thou usest to express to those
Who love and fear thy Name.

And my Director be;
Then no Iniquity shall gain
Dominion over me.

Out of the Oppressors reach:

And me thy Statutes teach.

By bold Impieties;
This makes me to lament, and floods
Of Tears o'er-flow mine Eyes.
Tsaddi. Part XVIII.

Exactly do agree:

And such thy Precepts be.

Mine Indignation rise;
To see my Foes forget thy Words,
And thy just Laws despise.

And free from all deceit:

To keep thy Laws is great.

Never change or have an end:
Thy Law's the Truth, on which we may
With certain Faith depend.

And sore oppressed with grief;
I thought on thy Commands, and found
Great comfort and relief.

This wisdom to me give,
By them to order all my ways;
And happy I shall live.
Koph. Part XIX.


Thy Testimonies, when I Am saved,
Better observed shall be.

Prevent the morning Light.

The watches of the Night.

Of which sure proofs I have;
And, as thou judge best, my Life
They seek to ruin, save.

Against me bent draw near;
Who Are far from care to keep thy Law,
And strangers to thy Fear.

Thou, Lord, art nearer still;
And all the Engagements of thy word
Wilt faithfully fulfill.

To be thy Will, stands fast;
And to all that do thereon depend,
Shall be performed at last.
Resh. Part XX.


Who'm mindful of thy Law, and trust
For safety on thy Word.

God's Laws, his help is far.

After thy wonted care.

Yet do I not decline
Thy Testimonies, nor will seek
Their Death, as they do mine.

How boldly men transgress:
Who, what thy Word commands, contemn,
What it forbids no less.

I to thy Precepts bear:
Preserve my Life, O Lord, and show
That I to thee am dear.

Fulfilled in Ages past:
And thy declared Will shall be
Performed, whilst time does last.
Schin. Part XXI.

But my great fear is this,
Lest, by transgressing thy Commands,
Thy favor I should miss.

Thy faithful Word contains;
He joys not more, who richest spoils
After a Conquest gains.

Honest and upright ways.

Seven times a Day my praise.

Who thy Commandments love;
And no Temptations unto Sin,
To them a Scandal prove.

Deliverance did expect;
And for my Safety only did,
What thy Commands direct.


For all my Actions naked are
To thy All-seeing Eyes.
Tau. Part XXII.

To thee for wisdom pray.

No longer, Lord, delay.

Thy Laws I Have understood:

Is faithfully made good.

lt's Succors to me reach:
For help, no other Course I Will take,
But what thy Precepts teach.

I long to have a sight;
Though, whilst: you are pleased to delay,
Thy Law's still my delight.

That I thy Praise may sing:
And let thy Judgments on my Foes,
The help I look for bring.

But now, to thee I come:
Thy Precepts I resolve to obey.
Lord, bring thy Servant home.
PSALM CXX.

in my distress I cried;
He heard me then, and so prevents
My fears to be denied.

No credit may they gain:
Which by false Tales mine Innocence,
Dear as my Life, would stain.

To get me in thy Power:

Like burning Coals devour.

A tedious Banishment
From mine own Country, and a Life
Among barbarous People spent.

Peace and a friendly Life:

Only for war and strife.
PSALM CXXI.

And thence will look for aid.

Both Heaven and Earth he made.

With his Almighty Arm:

From all surprising harm.

Will be thy sure Defense:

Malignant influence.

Preserve thy Soul from Sin;

And bless thy coming in.
PSALM CXXII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

With devout forwardness cxpress
Their Longings, to approach God's house,
To worship, and his Name to bless.

Where fair Jerusalem does lie:

Its Order and its Unity.

Go up, and all their Offerings bring;
And there before his Ark they own
His favors, and his praises sing.

And Thrones for David's Family:

And prosperous all that love her be.

No Foes without thy Walls surround;
And may thy quiet Palaces
With plenty of good things abound.

By ties of Friendship and of Blood;

Oblige me more to seek thy good.
PSALM CXXIII.

Art placed above the Skies:
To thee for Succor I direct
Mine heart, and lift mine Eyes.

With more Submission stands;
Nor maids with greater Duty wait
Their Mistresses Commands:
Than we that justly undergo
The Discipline of God,
Wait for a merciful Release,
When he will remove his Rod.

In thy Compassion lies;
And, Whom insultlng Foes do scorn,
Lord, do not thou despise.

Advantage to their pride;
And they who live in Wealth and Ease,
Our Miseries deride.
PSALM CXXIV.

His People now may say:

To succor us that Day,
When wicked Men, with cruel Wrath
Inflamed, against us rose:

Their Fury to oppose.

Had been an easy Prey:

Had swept us quite away.

His Mercy to enhance;
Then, when our Dangers loudest called,
To send Deliverance.

Caught in the Eowler's net:
God's Power has broke their snares, and we
At Liberty are set.

That Earth and Heaven made:
Our future Hopes shall all depend
On his Almighty Aid.
PSALM CXXV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Repose, and him their Fortress make,
Remain unmoved like Sion's Mount,
Which Storms and Tempests never shake.
with Hills begirt,
Great Safety gains from this Defense:
Good men much more from Angels guard,
And God's surrounding Providence.

Oppress the Good, and vex their Peace;
Lest the Temptation prove so strong,
They imitate their Wickedness.


Rebellious Sinners to destroy;
Then, Lord, with Peace the righteous crown.
PSALM CXXV.
[Another Meter.]

And him their Fortress make,
Remain unmoved, like Sion's Mount,
Which Tempests never shake.
with Hills begirt,
Is safe by this Defense;
Good men are more secure from God's
Surrounding Providence.

Oppress and vex their Peace;
Lest, through discouragement, they prove
Like them in wickedness.

Thy vengeance shall come down
Proud Sinners to destroy; then, Lord,
With Peace the Righteous crown.
PSALM. CXXVI.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

It seemed a strange and pleasant dream:

To tell this News was all our Theme.
This great and unexpected change,
Forced the Heathens to confess

The same with greater joy express.
Great are thy Mercies shown to us:

'T will be like welcome showers to ground
That Is parched with the scorching Sun.

All needful Blessings do restore;
And hope our former Tears will make
Our after-joys to be the more.

His scattered Seed in sadness leaves,
Will shout at Harvest, when he sees
That Seed become a Load of sheaves.
PSALM CXXVI.
[Another Meter.]

It seemed a pleasant Dream;

And Joy was all our Theme.
This mercy so unlooked for moved
The Heathens to confess

With Joy the same express.
Great are thy Mercies shown to us,

'T will be like welcome Showers to ground
Parched with the scorching Sun.

All good to us restore:
And hope our former Tears will make
Our after-joys the more.

By scatt'red handfulls leaves,
Will shout at Harvest, when that Seed
Becomes a Load of sheaves.
PSALM CXXVII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And pains to build an House is lost.
Unlese the Lord the City keep,
The watchful Guards as well may sleep.

Begin, and last when Day is done:
TO avoid that Poverty you dread,
With carefulness you eat your Bread.
But all in vain: if by Heaven blessed,
You may enjoy both wealth and rest:

As God's reward to Goodness come.

Like Arrows to a Man of War:

A Man may dare his Enemies.
PSALM CXXVIII.

Is by obedience shown:

And good Success shall crown.

With Clusters shall abound;
Whose Children like green Olive-plants,
Thy Table shall surround.

When Ggd's thy chiefest fear:

Shall have the greatest share.
A Numerous Race from thee derived.
Thy lengthned Age shall see;
And, the great wish of all good men,
The Land's Prosperity.
PSALM CXXIX.
Isra'lites may say,
Even from our Infant-state,
Many our Enemies have been,
And our Afflictions great.

Through God's preserving care,
Our Extirpation cannot boast,
We still his People are.

Deep marks whereof we bear:
As in plough'd ground, upon our backs
Long furrows do appear.

The wicked's Power broke;
And all the Bands asunder cut
Of their Tyrannick Yoke.
Sion hate
Better Successes meet;
But failing still in their attempts,
Be forced to retreat.

On ruined Houses Top:

Expecting thence no Crop.

Their hopes with wished Success:
Nor the Harvest prayer on these bestow,
"May Heaven your Labors bless.
PSALM CXXX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

To God I raised my fervent Cry:

Not sunk so low but thou can hear.

In strict Severity proceed;
By Merit, without Mercy, tried,
None could be cleared and justified.

That men may turn, and fear thy Name.

And on thy Promises rely.

Than Guards, for slow approach of Day.

In God alone repose their trust.
The frailty of our State he knows;
His plenteous Mercy ever flows.

And pardons what they have done amiss
PSALM CXXX.
[Another Meter.]

To God I raised my Cry:

Lend then a gracious Ear.

Severely should proceed;
By Merit, without Mercy, tried,
None could be justified.

That men may fear thy Name.

And on thy Word rely.

Than Guards for break of Day.

In God repose their Trust.
The Frailty of our State he knows,
His mercy freely flows.

Pard'ning what is done amiss.
PSALM CXXXI.

Nor Eyes that lofty are;
Nor meddle with the things advance'd
Above my lower Sphere.

Composed to silent rest;
I like a Child behave my self,
Weaned from his Mothers breast.

The World's deceitful shows;
But with an undisturbed mind,
In God their trust repose.
PSALM CXXXII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

And Cares that David did molest:

And sacred Vow, to God expressed.



Convenient for the Ark's repose.

In shady Woods of Ephrata:

And prostrate at his Footstool, pray.

The token of thy Presence, rests;
Together may thy Glory come,
Together stay like welcome Guests.

Be ever clothed with righteousness:
That both may triumph in thy Love,
Saints that are blessed, and Priests that bless.
David's sake,
And thine own Promise to him made;
The Prayers of thine Anointed hear,
And with thy Favor make him glad.
Part II.
David swarean Oath,
(With equal Truth 'twassaid and done)
One of thy Race, when thou shall cease
To reign, shall sit upon thy Throne.

My Precepts with religious Care;
Their Children shall not want a Throne
To sit upon, nor that an Heir.
13 For Sion's the beloved Hill,
Seat of their Kings and of their God:

My House of glorious abode.

Her poor I Will satisfy with Food;

The shouts and triumphs of the Good.
David's Regal power shall spring
Afresh, in his Successors, there;
And spread the Luster of his Name,
Till the great promised King appear.

All their Devices overthrown:
But I decree his glorious Head
Shall wear a never-fading Crown.
PSALM CXXXIII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Resembling that of Heaven above;
Where Brethren peacefully unite,
In sweet accord and hearty Love.

On A aron's consecrated Head;
Which first ran down his Face, and thence
Unto his costly Vesture spread.

Or as the fruitful Showers of Rain;
Though first on higher Grounds they fall,
Descend, and water all the Plain.
None can express the Joys that meet,
Where Love and Amity abound:
Their Souls are filled with inward Peace,
Their prosperous State with blessing crowned.
PSALM CXXXIII.
[Another Meter.]

Resembling Heaven above;
Where Brethren peacefully unite
In sweet Accord and Love.

Upon the High-priest's Head;
Which first ran down his Beard, and thence
To His costly Garments spread.

Or fruitful Showers of Rain;
Though first on higher Grounds they fall,
Thence water all the Plain.
None can express the Joys that meet,
Where mutual Love is found;
Their Souls are filled with inward Peace,
Their State with blessing crowned.
PSALM CXXXIV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Who early at his Temple wait,
And there your late attendance give;
See that his Name ye celebrate.

Pure hands in your Devotions raise;
To all your other Off' rings join
The grateful Sacrifice of Praise.

As great in Goodness as in Power,
Give gracious Answered to thy Prayers,
And blese his People every Hour.
PSALM CXXXIV.
[Another Meter.]

Who at his Temple wait;
See that before the rising Sun
His Name ye celebrate.

In your Devotions raise;
To all your other Off' rings join
The Sacrifice of Praise.

In Goodness as in Power;
Give ear to thy requests, and bless
His People every Hour.
PSALM CXXXV.

That Heaven and Earth did frame:

Praise ye his Glorious Name.

Your best Affections raise;
Your inward Pleasure will increase
Together with your Praise.
Isra'elites have greatest cause
To praise him and rejoice;
You that are dearer unto God;
His Treasure and his Choice.

His greatness knows no bound;
What ever by other Gods is claimed,
In him alone is found.

His Pleasure rules them still;
His uncontrolled mind the Heaven,
The Earth and Seas fulfill.

The Vapors to arise,
Which frame the Clouds, where Fire unquench'd
Mingled with Water lies.
From thence the dreadful lightnings burst,
And rains are poured down;
He brings his boisterous winds and storms
From Treasuries unknown,

At once in Egypt slew;

His wondrous Power knew.
Part II.

That Potent Sceptres swayed;
and Og ' mong these for War
The greatest Figure made.
All Can'an's Kingdoms too, at last
With all their Kings, he smote:

Our Heritage and Lot.

Thy Fame can never die;
But thy Memorial shall endure
To all Eternity.

Under oppression mourn:
He Will take their part, and all his wrath
Shall into kindness turn.

Or Gold at best, and thence
Derive their worth, but are no Gods,
Since void of Life or Sense.

A Mouth or other part:
He cannot give them Sight or Breath,
Motion or Life by Art.
Fond men! with hands to make a God,
To which our Knees should bow;
You trust what cannot help it self,
Statues have Sense like you.
Isr'ael, bless the Lord,
Ye Priests his praise proclaim:

That fear him do the same.
21 From Sion may his Songs of praise
Sound forth with sweet accord;
He in this Holy City dwells,
O praise this Highest Lord.
PSALM CXXXV.
[Another Meter.]
[As the 148 Psalm.]

That Heaven and Earth did frame;

Praise ye his Glorious Name.

To this invite;
His praise will give
The best delight.
Isr'aelites are bound
Greatly your God to bless;
Who unto Jacob did
Such special Love express:
Whose Children still
To God are dear;
His Treasure and
Peculiar care.

His Greatness knows no bound;
What other Gods do claim,
In him alone is found.

He all things made;
Still rules over all,
By all obeyed.

Are subject to his Will;
The Earth and Seas below
His pleasure do fulfill.
At his Command
From the World's End,
Vapors to frame
The Clouds ascend.
The dreadful Flashes thence
Of pointed Lightnings fly;
Those Fires remain unquench'd,
Though mixed with Rains they lie.
He brings forth Winds
That loudly blow,
From Treasuries
Which none can know.
Part II.

And Beast in Egypt slew:

His wondrous Power knew.

And Kings he smote;
and Og
Of greatest note.
The Fate of Can'an's Kings
And Kingdoms was the same,

Our Heritage became.

Memorial,
For ever, Lord,
Continue shall.

Suffer, when they offend;
At last their Sorrows will
In their Salvation end:
He Will take the part
Of those that mourn;
And all his wrath
To kindness turn.

Of vile Materials made:
Though by Man's Art with Gold
Or Silver overlaid.

An Eye or Ear

Nor see, nor hear.

Have made, their Knees to bend;
Much more to trust in what
Cannot it self defend:
Brutes that have Life
Are better for;
You without Sense
Like Statues are.
Isr'ael bless the Lord;
Ye Priests his praise proclaim;
Levi's House, and all
That fear him do the same.
Sion sing
With one accord;
There God resides,
Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CXXXVI.
[As the 148 Psalm.]

Who is so kind and good;
Whose Mercies firmly last,
As they have ever stood.

All Gods do bow,

And Powers below.



Above the Waters laid?



To rule the Night.
s Firstborn he smote

Isr'ael's Yoke,
And brought them from that Land.
His Mercies shown
To Ages past,
Eternally
Shall spring and last.

Israel to pass;

Of Phar'oh drowned was.

The Desert led
By Miracles
Were daily fed.

and Og he smote;


His Mercies shown
To Ages past,
Eternally
Shall spring and last.




Whose Mercies shown
To Ages past,
Eternally
Shall spring and last.
PSALM CXXXVI.
[Another Meter.] 113 Psalm.]

To God who is as Good as Great:
To every Age his Meroy's sure.

Whom Angels worship as their King:
Whese Mercy always does endure.

By low prostrations at his Throne:
To every Age his Merey's sure.

His Power to be beyond compare:
Whose Mercy always does endure.

Their Brightness and their Order show:
To every Age his Mercy's sure.

The Earth, which they can never overflow:
Whose Mercy always does endure.

To cheer the World, great Lights has made:
To every Age his Mercy's sure.

And Light, out Labors to complete:
His Mercy always does endure.

For our Repose, its place supply:
To every Age his Mercy's sure.

All the Firstborn in Egypt slew:
Whofe Mercy always does endure.
Israel, whom they long detained
In cruel Bondage, freedom gained:
To every Age his Mercy's sure.

A Power none could resist or shun:
His Mercy always does endure.
Part II.

The Red Sea severed into parts:
To every Age his Mercy's sure,

Till they pass through, the Waters stand:
His Mercy always does endure.
Phar'oh and his Host
That followed them, were sunk and lost:
To every Ate his Mercy's sure.

By Miracles were daily fed:
His Mercy always does endure.

Their passage to the promised Land:
To every Age his Mercy's sure.

No Victories, but all were slain:
His Mercy always does endure.
for War of greatest note,
King of fierce Amorites, he smote:
To every Age his Mercy's sure.
Bashan's Tyrant Og o'ercame,
For height, a Giant of great Name:
His Mercy always does endure.

For a perpetual Heritage:
To every Age his Mercy's sure.

Who had not then our God forgot:
Whose Mercy always does endure.

Might have thrown out, whom he brought in:
To every Age his Mercy's sure.

And saved us from our Enemies:
His Mercy always does endure.

All Creatures wants supplies with good:
To every Age his Mercy's sure.

Our thanks to Heaven's great God let us raise:
Whose Mercy always does endure.
To thee O Father, to the Son,
And Holy Ghost, blessed Three in one,
Whom we as God alone adore;
Glory that was of old be given,
By all on Earth, and all in Heaven,
Now, and till Time shall be no more.
PSALM CXXXVII.
[At the 100 Psalm.]
Euphrates Streams we sat,
Reflecting on our Miseries,
And Sion called to mind; that thought
A Flood of Tears drew from our Eyes.

And so our Harps remained unstrung;
And since our Joys were at an End,
Neglected on the Willows hung.

Whose enslaved Captives now we were,
To entertain their Mirth, required
One of our Temple-songs to hear.

(Our Hearts, as our Condition, sad)
Anthems of Praises to our God
Sing, only for to make you glad?

Or I my Harp employ so ill,
Whilst Sion mourns; may my right hand
Be quite benumbed, or lose its skill.
Whom we as God alone adore;
Glory that was of old be given
By all on Earth, and all in Heaven,
Now, and till Time shall be no more.
PSALM CXXXVII.
[At the 100 Psalm.]

Reflecting on our Miseries,
And Sion called to mind; that thought

Or I my Harp employ so ill,
Whilst sion mourns; may my right hand
Be quite benumbed, or lose its skill.

(Unless thy ruins to deplore)
And find no Joy; It Is all prosane,
Till God Jerusalom restore.

Of Edom, Lord, who without pity,
Rejoyeing over its ruins, cried,
"Raze the Foundations of the City.
Babylon,
whose turn to be destroyed does hasts;
O may he prosper, who repays
What Is done to us, and lays thee waste.

Spares not to snatch thy little ones;
And harm from savage Race prevents,
By dashing them against the Stones.
PSALM CXXXVIII.

Thy best affections raise;
Angels shall hear my Songs, and be
The Partners of my praise.

And Goodness I Will proclaim:
These raise my Wonder, and advance
The Glories of thy Name.

And thou my Prayer did hear:
Thou did support me with thy strength,
And with thy Comforts cheer.

And take occasion thence,

Thy ways of Providence.

The lowly views and owns;
But scorns the proud, and on their height
With Indignation frowns.

My fears, when in distress;
Thy hand shall save me from my Foes,
Thy Power their wrath repress.

Complete what is begun;
O never suffer thine own Work,
Nor me to be undone.
PSALM CXXXIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

In vain l seek to be concealed.

My very thoughts are all revealed.

My walking and my lying down;

Better than to my self are known.

Of thine incircling Arm I lie:

Nor escape the notice of thine Eye.

A Place where God does never come?

His Power, had I in Hell a Room.

Winged with the swiftest morning ray;

My flight, would my abode betray;

The blackest Curtains of the Night;

We Darkness call, to thee is Light.

With all the affections seated there;
To thee that made those hidden Springs
Within the Womb, must needs appear.

The Footsteps of thy wondrous skill;
And, to excite my Praise, I find
Within my self more Wonders still.
Part II.

The dark Recesses of the Womb;








Before the fine Embroidery
Of Parts was to perfection come:

The daily growth of every part;
And what the Eternal mind had framed,
Was copied out, with curious Art,

And the wise Counsels of thy mind;
Their Sum is infinite; yet all
Are dear to me, because they are kind,

Which whilst my busy thoughts run over,
I sleep: and find when I awake,
I Am only where I was before.

Who wickedly 'ganst me combine;
Hence then, ye bloody-minded Men,
Nor your own ruin seek in mine.

Intended mischiefs to disguise;
And boldly call God in, to vouch
For all their Calumnies and Lies,

Such as oppose thy Laws and thee?

My self their utter Enemy.

Of living in a false Disguise;
I Am less afraid to undergo
The Trial of thy piercing Eyes.

Unwillingly have done amiss,
Correct my Errors, and reduce
My wanderings to the way of Bliss.
PSALM CXXXIX.
[Another Meter.]

I seek to be concealed;

To thee are all revealed.

Walking and lying down;
My works and words, better to thee
Than to my self are known.

Incircling Arm I lie;

Nor escape thy piercing Eye.

I seek to find a Seat;

Thy Glories I should meet.

Winged with the Mornings ray;

Would my abode betray.

The Curtains of the Night;

Darkness, to thee is Light.

The affections seated there,
To thee that mad'est within the Womb
Those hidden Springs, appear.

Footsteps of wondrous skill;
And in my self, t'excite my Praise,
I find more Wonders still.
Part II.

Recesses of the Womb;
Before the Embroidery of parts
Was to perfection come:

The growth of every part;
And what the Eternal mind had framed,
Was drawn with curious Art.

And Counsels of thy mind;
Their Sum is infinite, yet dear
To me, because they are kind.

Which whilst my thoughts run over,
I sleep; and find when I awake,
I Am where I was before.

Who against my Life combine;
Hence then ye men of blood; nor your
Own ruin seek in mine.

Of Piety disguise
Intended mischiefs; and would make
God vouch for all their Lies,

Thy holy Laws and thee?

My self their Enemy.

TO have lived in false disguise;
I Am lest afraid to undergo,
The Trial of thine Eyes.

Thou see l've done amiss;
Coorrect, and lead my wandering steps
Into the way of Bliss.
PSALM CXL
[As the 100 Psalm.]

A wicked and a cruel mind:

On mischief, and for War combined.

They give, whom falsely they accuse:
No Serpents Tongue or Adders Teeth
Poison more surely does infuse.

To save me from the wickeds power:
And from their violent Attempts,
Who seek to undo me every hour.

In laying Toils and secret Shares,
Does not exceed' their Wiles, who think
They Are sure to seize me unawares.

I can implore from any Friend;
By humble Prayer my self to thee,
My sole Protector, I commend.

Thee only for my Savior own;
By thee I fought securely, when
Armor and Helmet I had none,
Part II

Would have, nor with a good event
Favor their mischievous designs,
Lest they grow proud and insolent.

By those that now beset me, thrown;
With their laborious Lies, contrived
To work my ruin, prove their own.

Of Fire, may they tho Torment have;
And all their Mischiefs, like deep Pits
Dug for my fall, be their own grave.

Will bring the advanced Sinner low;
And Acts of unjust Violence
Pursue him to his overthrow.

Will pity, and their Cause maintain:
And right the wronged poor, who here
Expect to be redressed in vain.

Due praises to his Name to give:
For th'upright by God's Care upheld,
Shall in his Favor ever live.
PSALM CXLI

Lord, lend a gracious Ear;
And as my Danger calls aloud,
To succor me appear.

Up to thy Presence rise;
And find acceptance, equal to
An Evening Sacrifice,

The Motions of my Tongue;
That no intemperate Speech may show
Inpatient sense of wrong.

Engage in Works of Sin;
Nor let the wicked's Delicates
Me to their practice win.

From those that, Goodness love:
Their wise reproofs, though smarting, will
A real kindness prove.
No precious Ointments, to the Head
So sweet and grateful are;
But to avoid mischievous ways,
I Will make my daily Prayer.
Part II.

Readiness Captains witness bear;
Who at the stony Rocks descent,
Did my mild Language hear.

Their rage will not allow;
Scattered and broke we lie, like ground
Divided by the Plough.

My Trust is in thee still:
Do not abandon me to those
That seek my Blood to spill.

Like snares the wicked lay;
Save me from those that would my Life
To cruel hands betray.

Themselves alone ensnare:
Whilst I escape the Nets they spread,
By God's preserving Care.
PSALM CXLII

God's succor and relief:

Unbosom'd all my grief;

A way for me to escape:
In every Path of mine, is laid
A secret Snare and Trap.

All hopes of safety gone:
Whilst all are careless of my Life,
Or fearful of their own.

What trust I have in thee:
Thou my sure refuge whilst I live,
My Portion thou shall be.

My Persecutors save;
Whose hope in God is less than mine,
But much more Power they have.

That I may praise thy Name;
Then all good Men shall join with me
God's kindness to proclaim.
PSALM CXLIII.

The Hopes I have in thee;
And, Lord, according to thy Truth
And Goodness answer me.

Thy strict Tribunal tried;
For, Lord, if thou should be severe,
None could be justified.

No safety can be found,
Forced to lie in Caves, like one
That Is buried under ground.

That stupid I am grown;
With horror and amazement seized,
My strength is overthrown.

As I am sinking lower;
To call to mind thy former works,
And lean upon power.

Shall thy refreshments gain;
Thy mercy which I gasp for more,
Than thirsty ground for Rain.
Part II.

the assistance I would have;
If God still frown on my requests,
'T will sink me to the Grave.

O let the joyful Morning tell
Thy Kindness toward me.
Lord, be my Guide that I may find

Who seek my overthrow.

And let thy Spirit of Love,
Conduct me in the paths that lead
To Happiness above.

And Honor to advance;
Thy Faithfulness will brightly shine
In my deliverance.

May have a gracious End;
Destroy the Authors of my woes,
For I on thee depend.
PSALM CXLIV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Who gives me strength and skill to fight.

Delive'rer, shield and safe resort.
My trust's in him; 'twas he compelled
Those to be subject who rebelled.

Honor so much a poor weak Man.

Whose Life does vanish like a shade.

When the Heavens make way, and God comes down.
Their ruine's sure, that God provoke,
Whose touch makes proudest Mountains

Such fears, their force will dissipate.

From foreign Powers that me invade;
Like swelling Waves their Numbers stand,
Threatening to overflow the Land.

But break all Faith their Right-hands plight.

Will sing new Songs of Praise to thee.
Part II.

Of Kings, and all their safety lies:
I Am ever bound to praise the Lord,
Who saved me from the hurtful Sword.

From foreign Powers that me invade:
Whose Words and Oaths are vain and light,
Who break all Faith their Right-hands plight.

Our Sons like Plants in their increase:
Our Daughters fair and proper grow,
As polished pillars beaut'eous show.

Our num'erous Flocks increase to more.

Our Land from all invasions free.
No Cries of mournful Exiles meet,
Nor no Complaints in any Street.

Thrice blessed! whom God for His do sown.
PSALM CXLV.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

Thou King of Saints and God of Love:

My work eternally above.

Whose Greatness all our thoughts exceeds.

The next shall tell thy mighty Deeds.

And thy amazing Works proclaim:

Shall gladly join to do the same.

Of mercy, so their Joys shall flow;
Their Tongues thy Faithfulness shall sing
And thine abundant Goodness show.

To Anger flow, but glad to spare;

Over all thy tender Mercies are.

Some thankful Tribute do receive;
But where their Powers fail, thy Praise
Among thy Saints shall ever live.

Thy Kingdom's Glory never cease;

May know, and all thy power confess.
Part II.

Though often undermined in vain:

By thee; when falling, raised again.

Supplies of seasonable Food:

Their longings with desired Good.

In all his ways and works appear:

That call on him and are sincere.

That they in vain have fought his aid:
He hears their Cries when in distress,
And saves them when they are afraid.

The good Man's duty and his love;
But the bold Crimes of wicked Men,
Shall at the length their ruin prove.

Thy cheerful Praises to proclaim;
Let all the World adore thy Power,
And ever bless thy Holy Name.
PSALM CXLV.
[Another Meter.]

My King, and God of Love:

Eternally above.

whose Greatness all exceeds;

And praise thy mighty Deeds.

Thy wondrous Works proclaim;

Shall join to do the same.

So shall their comforts flow:
Their tongues thy Faithfulness shall sing
And thy great Goodness show.

Of Love, and glad to spare;

Thy tender Mercies are.

Thy works thou do receive;
But where they fail, thy Praise among
The Saints shall ever live.

These Subjects never cease;

And all thy Power confess.
Part II.

Though undermined in vain;

When falling, raised again.

Supplies of daily Food;

All their desires with good.

In all his ways appear;

As pray, and are sincere.

They Have sought in vain his Aid;
He hears their Cries when in distress,
And saves them when afraid.

Rewards the good Man's love;
But the bold Crimes of wicked Men;
At length their ruin prove.

Thy Praises to proclaim;
Let all the World adore thy Power,
And ever bless thy Name.
PSALM CXLVI.

Thy best affections raise:

The Subject of my Praise.

Whose Glories at their Death

Do vanish with their Breath.

That made the World does trust;

Cease to be good and just.

The good Man's cause oppressed;
He feeds the hungry, and by him
The Prisoners are released.

Dejected Souls removes;
And by his special Care protects,
The righteous whom he loves.

He does the Orphans own;
As for the wicked's prosperous State,
He turns it upside down.

As he does ever live;
Let all the World he rules, to him
Eternal Praises give.
PSALM CXLVII.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

To praise the God whom we adore;
How grateful to our selves and him!
Nothing becomes a good Man more.

Of Captive Isr'ael did repair;

He binds and heals with tender care.

What virtue comes to us from thence;
For it is from him they borrow all
Their luster and their influence.

His Power so great it knows no bound;

The stubborn Sinners to the ground.

Whose Bounty all things does maintain:

And for the Earth prepares the Rain.
He makes the tender Grass to grow
On Mountains, which are parched and dry.

And the young Ravens when they cry.

Of Horse or Man takes no delight:

In God, his Favor does invite.
Part II.
Jerusalem! sing praise
Unto thy God, and ye that dwell
On Sion's Mount, in joyful Hymns
To all his Truth and Goodness tell.

The Assaults of Foes it now defies;
His Blessing thine Inhabitants
To a vast Number multiplies.

Are settled all in quiet peace;
And thy fair Fields the choicest Wheat
Yields to an envied increase.



















And the Hoar-frosts like Ashes strows.

But at his word warm Winds do blow;
Then Rocks of Ice are soon dissolved,
And the congealed Waters flow.
Israel

The clearer knowledge of his Will
And Laws they have: Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CXLVII.
[Another Meter.]

The Lord whom we adore!
How grateful to our selves and him!
Nothing becomes us more.

Of Isr'ael did repair:

He heals with greatest Care.

What virtue comes from thence;
For it is from him they borrow all
Their light and influence.

His Power admits no bound:

Proud Sinners to the ground.

That all things does maintain:

The Earth prepares the Rain.
He makes the tender Grass to grow
On Mountains, parched and dry:

Young Ravens when they cry.

Of Man, are his delight:

His Favor does invite.
Part II.
Jerusalem! sing praise
To God, and ye that dwell
On Sion's Mount, in Hymns to all
His Truth and Goodness tell.

Of Foes it now defies;
And vastly thine Inhabitants
His Blessing multiplies.

Are settled all in peace;
Thy Fields the choicest Wheat produce,
TO an envied increase.



Hoar-frosts like Ashes strows.
None can abide his piercing Cold:

Then Rocks of Ice dissolve, and soon
Congealed Rivers flow.
Israel
More Grace he did afford:

And Laws. Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CXLVIII.

Let all their Voices raise:

The Great Creator's Praise.

And every Star,
His Glory show
That Is brighter far.

And watery Clouds that move
Within the liquid Sky,

Whose powerful Word
Made you to be;

By his Decree.

Whales in the Depths concealed:

Vapors to Ice congealed:
The stormy Winds
Raised at his Will,
Which at his Word
Are calmed and still.

And Hills that lower are;
Cedars with lofty Heads,
And Trees that fruits do bear:

Or Pastures lie;
Both creeping things,
And Fowls that fly.

People of meaner Birth;
Princes that rule the world,
And Judges of the Earth.

And every Age,

Of God engage.
His Glories alt that shines
In Heay'n and Earth excel;

TO his People Israel:
A People dear
And highly raised:
His Holy Name
Be ever praised.
PSALM CXLIX.
[As the 100 Psalm.]

As he fresh favors daily grants;
Publish your Joys by Hymns of Praise,
Among th'Assemblies of his Saints.
Isr'ael whom he made, rejoice;
Since his peculiar People made;
Let Sion's Children, whom he rules
As their great King, be much more glad.

The inward Motions of their Joy;
And to set off melodious Songs,
Their Harps and Timbrels to employ.

Engage his Care their good to advance:
He Will beautify the Meek, and make
Them great by his Deliverance.

Their Triumphs should be great and high;
And God's loud Praises will become
Their Beds, in which they quiet lie.

Whilst their Hands wield a two edged Sword;
Will courage and assurance give,
To fight the Battles of the Lord.

The Heathen's insolence chastise;

Make chained Kings become their prize.

Shall God upon the Heathen bring:
Such Honor all his Saints shall have,
And praising Hallelujah's sing.
PSALM CL.

Where he his Grace bestows;
Your wondering thoughts to Heaven raise
Where he his Glory shows.

Your inward Passions move;
That your acknowledgments may suit
The Greatness of his Love.



The Triumphs of your Joy.

That breath by which they live;
Let every thing that breaths, to him
Their cheerful Praises give.

HYMNS Taken out of the NEW TESTAMENT; Or, used in the Church Service.
HYMN I.
Benedictus.
[The Song of Zachary, Luke 1. 68.]
LET Isr'ael's powerful God and King
Eternally be blessed;
Who came from Heaven to visit us,
And all our Bonds released
In David's House a Savior raised
To sit upon his Throne;
This, ever since the World began
His Prophets have foreshown.
That he would save us from the Hand;
Of all that did us hate:
The Mercy to perform, for which
Our Fathers long did wait.
Remembering all his Truth engaged
By' a Holy Covenant;
His solemn Oath to Abra'ham sworn;
His Grace that he would grant;
To serve him without fear, from all
Our Adversaries freed;
And to continue all our days
A Holy Life to lead.
And thou, blessed Child, to this high Lord
Shall have a Prophet's place;
Like a preparing Harbinger
Shall go before his Face.
By the Remission of Men's sins
To make Salvation known.
God's tender Mercy, when this Sun
Arose, to all was shown.
He will our sad and dismal State
With Light and Comfort bless;
And guide our Feet into the way
Of Peace and Happiness.
HYMN II.
Magnificat.
[As the 25 Psalm.] Luke 1. 46.]
MY Soul does magnify the Lord,
Transports of Joy my Spirits raise;
And God my Savior shall be
The Subject of my Song of Praise.
For to his humble Handmaids state
He showed regard, when it was deprest:
All Ages shall from henceforth judge
Me happy, and shall call me Blessed.
He that is Great has done to me
Great things, and holy is his Name:
His Mercy through all Ages is
To them that fear him still the same.
He with his Arm his strength has showed,
Confounded what the proud Men thought;
Put down the mighty from their Seat,
And raised them who were set at naught.
He filled the hungry Souls with good;
The full and rich for want complained;
His Mercy he has called to mind,
And Israel his help has gained.
The Promise to our Fathers made
So long before, in which God stood
Engaged to Abra'ham and his Seed,
Is all performed and made good.
HYMN III.
Nunc Dimittis.
[The Song of Simeon, Luke 2. 29.]
I Now can leave this World, and die
In Peace and quiet Rest;
Since that mine Eyes, O Lord, have been
With thy Salvation blessed.
The Prophecies are all fulfilled,
Thy Promises are true;
And thy mysterious Love disclosed
In all the Peoples view.
All the dark Shadows fly away,
Now this bright Sun appears;
Whose saving Health the Gentile World
With unknown Comfort cheers.
Well may the long expected sight
Make Isr'ael's Joys abound;
Before with special Favors graced,
But now with Glory crowned.
