AN ADMIRABLE DISCOVERY of an horrible Attempt, slanderously fathered upon
those of Rochell.
SIR,
The long experience which by your age and worth, you have gotten in this
World, having often invited me to take your advice in the discharge of my
place, does bind me likewise to give you notice of any notable Accident
happening therein.

Of late we have been busied about the discovery of a strange Imposture and
Supposition, drawn from false witnesses, who by the suggestion of one Guillot
of Lions, had caused one du Bois, of the Country of Pourin (a man of the
Reformed Religion, and deputed to exhibit our grievances, which we have often
cause to complain of) to be imprisoned, accusing him of high treason; the
information, hearing, and confrontment whereof, being orderly performed, during
the time of his long imprisonment, there remained but one only witness, and
he not very constant neither, who averred to have heard from the mouth of the
said Du Bois: That the King might perhaps repent the so little keeping of his
Word in the last Treaty of Peace; Whereupon although it were but doubtful,
the Judges (being according to their duties very nice in that which concerns
the sacred person of our King) condemned the said du Bois, in an hundred and
fifty Franckes fine, banishing him from out of the jurisdiction of Paris for
three years, and forced him to pass over an office which he held. After all
this he was yet detained a month longer in Prison, to give the more way to any
new accusation, nor was there any instance made in favor of him, considering
the weight of his accusation, although there appeared some manifest wrong
therein: In the end his liberty being obtained he comes forth: But it
happens that within two hours after, That the same first Appeacher delivers
into the hands of Father Sigueran, a letter found (as he affirmed) in the
straw-bed of the afore-sayd du Bois, directed unto him, and written and signed
by the supposed name of de la Roche a fained inhabitant of the Town of
Rochell; and in the name as it were of the whole body thereof: the fearful
tenure whereof, tended unto horrible and damnable Designs against the life of
our King. Father Sigueran, without consideration of the astonishment it might
have bred, carries it forthwith to the King, and his Majesty refers it to
an appointed Judge.

Now as it was not only his end who set this Informer on work, to aim
simply at the ruin of the said Du Bois, but also to involue in this Devilish
crime the Townsmen of Rochell, yea even endeavoring to bring into a general
hatred (which ought to be common to all good Frenchmen against all such
sacrilegious and detestable paracides) all those of our profession, hoping to
stir up by just executions, or massacres, amongst the people, or by the
indignation of our Prince in a general war, new troubles, and some mighty
breach for the common enemy of our Estate: So the said Inventor suggested such
matter in this Letter, as was able to ensnare us all in the net of an
inevitable ruin, as we should have very well deserved, if these suppositions
had been true, and recommends in express terms in his said discourse unto
the said du Bois, the resolution to aim his stroke at the sacred bosom of
our King, and from thence to pass unto the person of Monsieur the Kings
brother, by the direction and enchantment of a most notorious Magitian, whom he
faines to have been sent unto him, to metamorphoze him into a straw after the
execution. And to spur him on the better to this resolution, he remonstrates
unto him that Mansfield is weary of his long stay: That Monsieur de Soubife
loses the fruit of his surprisalls: That he shall find a safe retreat under
the Constable: and that the sum of six thousand Crowns, promised unto him by
those of Rochell, is ready. Thus you may see how this Project does wholly tend
to muster up all matter which may seem to further the inventors hatred, and
our ruin.

But the more this business seemed monsterous, the more it stirred up the Judges
affection to use all due circumspection and consideration; which presently
invite him happily to a second seazure of du Bois, and upon exact examination
of the said Letter, comes by a number of notable circumstances, to suspect and
discover the perfidiousnesse of this plot; so as every several success of
this his travail, does worthily deserve an entire Description: for presently
he runs over all the Scriueners, Coppiers, and Clerks, discovers by an
Advocats Clerk of Lions, the very same Caracter, the foresaid letter was
written withal; then he visits all the Gravers shopps, and found who made
the Seal* goes to the Stationers, compares there his paper, and finds where
the said Clerk had bought the very same leaf so written: seazeth on him, the
Graver, and the Accuser, who condemns himself and craves pardon, and
discloseth and avoucheth a certain Deputy of the Clergy of Baye upon Baye,
to have hired him thereunto for 600. Crowns. Thus the means and progress of
these discoveries do much recommend this good. Judge unto all posterity, and
to have well deserved of the Commonwealth, which is every day in expectation:
through this his good justice and by the authority and express commandment
of his Majesty, to see exemplarie punishment performed upon these cursed
machavillians. And now you may plainly see Sir how many just occasions we
have, to lift up with thanks giving pure hands unto God, for his holy
protection, and defending of us, and more particular preservation of his Royal
Majesty: For what more plausible subject can we have, to exercise our
sincerity and good intentions, then upon this occasion to procure by our
renewed fidelities and obedience, that true protection of his Majesty's
Scepter, which we crave. And from hence he may justly hereafter be invited,
unto such a particular examination as shall distinctly aver that which they
publicly and so lightly impose upon us: so as observing with what spirit our
Enemies are possessed, he shall plainly see (if it please him) that by
bending and leaning to their desires against his good subjects, he shall
destroy by his Arms, that which he may more profitably win by his protection,
and withstand as courageously our common enemy, as we naturally hate him: It
may please God that his Majesty perceiving us to be glewed to his Scepter
alone, may conclude it as a thing just in his justice, to grant us the entire
accomplishment, and execution of those things which it pleased him to grant us
in the treaty of peace, and which we dare say by our behavior, and His
clemency, we have deserved: least the inexecutions so notoriously observed
toward us, become so many stains, not able to be washed out, but with the
ground and all; and dim the luster of that firm fidelity, which is the
ground and preservation of Kingdoms, as well as of ordinary commerce amongst
men. Nor do these direful and strong garrisons serve to any other end, then
as baits unto such as make sinister conclusions of his Majesty's intentions.

But returning to our History, you shall understand, that this good Judge,
endeavors to find out the source of this instigation as aspiring unto the
public peace: Yet I doubt me we shall not attain thereunto, yet although
we discover not the arm which did shoot them, we have seized on the arrows
of their pernicious designs, and by the blessing of our good God, this
slander has not yet been able to set her viperous teeth on our reputation,
since the murdering of the Lords Anointed ones has been in use; for we know
what is due even to the very skirt of Saules garment: all those of our
profession being always well instructed, to yield obedience to our Kings by
nature and for conscience sake; And we alone are they throughout all their
Dominions, which take the oath of fidelity unto them exclusiuely against all
others. Certainly you which know by reading al our chronicles and your own
experience, what those Friars be, of which there are yet a thousand brands
smoking, have often represented unto me, that in the heat of so many
slaughters and executions wrongfully exercised against us, there was never
found any spark of attempt amongst us, nor any thing which has had power, to
stir us up to affect a foreign Rule, and withdraw us from the Scepter of
our Birth. This is it which makes us so jealous of our reputation, and so
passionatly and openly to cry out for justice, as well for the common good as
our particular preservation. The which being often assured unto us by the
principal Ministers of State here, with the observation of our Edicts: I dare
as often upon their credits confirm the apparencies, and the good words which
his Majesty is pleased to give us concerning the continuance of the peace, the
only supporter of our state and procurement of our felicity; And which
besides makes us hope to be found fit to transport the generous Designs of
our Noble King, beyond the ordinary limmits, which the Spaniard has too
strickly measured out. In the mean time attending to hear from you, I will
pray to God for the prosperity of you and your brave Children, and ever remain

Your humble and most affectionate servant and Allie, Montmartin General
Deputy.
Paris 15. February, 1624.
HOwsoever, if we consider the purity of Gods Word and Gospel, the integrity
of Christian Religion, and the meek simplicity of the Professors thereof, it
may well be wondered at, that crimes of Treachery, Conspiracy, and fury, should
be imputed unto them who have (following our Saviors counsel and example)
suffered patiently, intolerable and most horrible persecutions, injuries, and
reproaches, without rendering the like to their Adversaries, as justly they have
been incited unto; and might have done by the law of Retribution; yet if we
call to mind the inveterate malice of Satan, and his children, against God,
his Word, and his Church, with their accustomed dealings in this kind from
time to time ever since the beginning of the world, it may be esteemed no
wonder at all; No, although these of later and present times, out strip their
forefathers, and Satan now go beyond himself, in inventing new and
prodigious persecutions and slanders against Gods people; for the Devil is
grown old and cunning, and has distilled the quintessence of fury and villainy
into his Imps, especially into the Jesuits heads and hearts; who having set all
Christendom together by the ears, by their subtle plots and devises, to the
utter ruin thereof, (if God in mercy do not miraculously prevent it) while
themselves sit aloft and laugh to see how they make fools of all the world,
thus to dance after their Pipe, and yet can so finely carry the matter, as
(good souls) not once to be suspected; but rather it appears to vulgar eyes,
that they bestow much care and labor, to discover the authors of these
combustions, and to that purpose do they (like unholy Fathers as they are) cry
out in their Books of the Insurrections and Rebellions of Protestants in all
Countries; and here they lay on load, raking all kennels for filthy lies and
foul imputations, to bedaub us withal, and so to make us ugly and odious in
all men's sight; but let not this temptation trouble us, for its no news, for
Gods servants to be slain and slaundered both at once: all Histories both
sacred and profane, make it manifest by multitudes of Examples, which it would
be too long to rehearse in this short discourse; only we may well wonder, that
these fellows who have such long memories to relate what they suppose
Protestants have done; yet are so short in their own rebellions and treacherous
actions; insomuch, as one would think they had learned in Father Aubiguyes
School, the Art to forget any thing that may impeach their Catholic cause.
And therefore it were to be wished that some man of good sufficiency would
call to their remembrance, their transcendant trecheries and cruelties against
Protestants, almost in all Countries of Christendom; such as the massacring of
many thousands in one Kingdom, within three days space: Blowing up with
Gunpowder the whole State of another; besides their familiar burning of poor
Christians, of all degrees, sexes, and ages; esteeming it no more (as one of
them said) then the burning of an Earewig: or as another of them makes it but a
matter of sport, to burn a man for some foolish opinions (as he calls them):
Surely these were hugely Catholic, but it was in monstrous cruelty and
villainy.

Now that it may appear they have not changed their qualities, behold here one
knack of their Knavery, presently set on foot; whereby thou may perceive,
that as their father the Devil was a liar and a murderer from the beginning,
so they as his natural Children, will continue murderers and liars to the
end: God Almighty send an end unto their malice and mischief at length for
Christ's sake. Amen.

FINIS.
