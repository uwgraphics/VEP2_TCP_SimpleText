By the Queen.
A Proclamation against the carriage of Dags, and for reformation of some other
great disorders.
THe Queens Majesty hearing by credible report, that there are great
disorbers lately grown in sundry parts of her Realm, and specially in and
about her City of London, and in the usual high ways to wards the said city,
and to her Majesty's Court, by common carrying of Dags, other wise called
Pistols, to the terror of all people professing to travel and live peaceably,
and (which is most to her Majesty's griese) by the usage whereof, certain
persons have been of late in sundry places slain with such pieces: Hereupon
has called to her remembrance, that she has by former proclamations
published, straightly forbidden the carrying, not only of such Dagges, but also
of other longer pieces, as Caliuers and such like, in places and times not
allowable for service: By which proclamations, as first, by one in very few
words, in May the first of her reign, Her Majesty reciting the Statute of her
noble Father King Henry the eight, in the three and thirtieth year of his
reign, against the riding with handgunnes and dagges, under the length of
three quarters of a yard, commanded the same to be observed, and charged all
her Justices of peace at their next Sessions, to make inquisition of the
observation thereof, and to see the same Stature duly executed: And for that
by process of time, the due execution thereof has ceased, and the disorders
grown much greater, not only in open carrying such Dags, but also in a devise
to have secretly small Dagges, commonly called pocket Dags, and in wearing also
secretly coats of armor, commonly called privy coats, whereby many
robberies and frayes have been increased, and became unpunished: Her Majesty
did in the xxi. year of her reign by another open Proclamation, expressing
the disorders and dangers hereby ensuing, command that both her former
Proclamation concerning the prohibition of Dags, should be speedily put in
execution, and added thereto her further commandments and prohibitions against
a disorder in carrying and shooting with Handguns and Caliuers within two miles
of the place of her Majesty's residence, and near to Towns and men's houses,
where there was no cause of Musters to show the same, nor any places ordained
for exercise, and against the wearing of privy Coats and Dublets of defense,
by such as thereby moved quarrels and frayes, upon other quiet subjects unarmed:
And in conclusion of the same latter Proclamation, her Majesty did also
command all her Officers in any City or Town, to make search for all manner of
such small Dags called Pochet Dags, and specially in shops and houses of
Artificers that do use to make the sme: and those to take and keep in their
possession, giving the owners testimonial of the receipt thereof, to the end
if there should be seen good cause, they might have a reasonable recompense.

All which former commandments and prohibitions appearing in this time to be
as necessary or rather more to be duly executed, then before time, her
Majesty does newly now command to be presently executed: Wherewith her
Majesty charge all her Justices of Peace, and specially now at the first
Sessions that shall be kept after Christmas in all Counties, diligently to be
given in charge, and by Iuries the defaults to be presented and punished.

And for more certainty to have the same so executed, her Majesty commands
the Custos Rotulorum in every County, and the Recorders in all Cities being
Justices of Peace, to make Certificat in writing to her Majesty's Counsel in
the Star chamber within the space of viii. days, from the beginning of every
Hillarie Term, how this her Majesty's present Proclamation has been in the
said first Sessions executed: and so yearly to certify the like in every
Hillarie Term, until the same be otherwise directed by admonition from her
Majesty's said Counsel, to cease from the same.

And although hereby the carriage of Dags is generally prohibited, yet the
carriage thereof shall not be prohibited to persons appointed to come to
Musters, as horsemen with Dags to serve therewith, or to be used by any of her
Majesty's ministers or their servants for their more surety to carry her
Majesty's treasure, or to bring her revenue to places appointed: So as always
the carriage of such Dags be in open sort, to be manifestly seen to all
persons.

Given at Somersethouse, the second day of December, 1594. in the xxxvii. year
of her Majesty's Reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty. 1594
