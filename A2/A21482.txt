A PROCLAMATION CONCERNING CORN.
FOR AS MUCH as corn of all greynes, and specially wheat and rye, is

derthe thereof: and diverse husbandmen and fermers do color such byingis for
sede, where they have no such necessity so to do: For reformacion whereof the
kings most royal majesty, wyllyng that his loving subjects should be
provided of corn at reasonable prices, consyderyng, that (thanks be to god)
there is no just ground or cause, why such greyne should be so high
enhaunced in price, as it is: but that the enhau^cement thereof grows by the
occasion aforesaid, and by the subtle invention and craft of diverse covetous
persons, having convenient plenty of the same: Does therefore straytly charge
and command, that no person nor persons, after this present proclamation,
till his gracis pleasure be further known, shall bie or bargayne any wheat or

it accordyngely. And that no person, having wheat or rye of his own tilthe
and growith, or by provision of his bienge, sufficient to find his family and
household and for his sede, shall bye any such greyne, upon pain that every
offender contrary to the premises or any part thereof, shall not only incur
into his gracis most high displeasure and indignation, but also suffer
imprisonement, and make fine at his pleasure. And also that no person,
occupienge tillage and husbandry, shall bie any wheat or Rye for sede, unless
it be first examined and proved before one or two of the commissioners
assigned for search of corn, that such person has necessity to bye such
sede, or else that such person so byinge any, wheat or rye for sede within.

bring a certificate to one of the said commissioners from the bayliffe or
other chief officer of the markette, where he shall so sell his corn, that he
has sold the same: upon pain that every offender to the contrary hereof to
incur the danger, peynes, imprysonement, and fine above remembered.

And also his majesty straytly charge and commands, that no person or
persons shall regrate or engrose any manner of corn, upon pain of

the commissioners assigned for the same, and there sell at reasonable prices:
and observe and obey the said commissioners in all such oders, as they shall
take for the due execution of their commission, upon pain of imprysonemente
and fine making at his gracis will.

And over this the kings highness straitely charge and commands al and
singular his Justices of pecae, mayres shireffes, bayliffes, constables, and
all other his loving subjects, that they and every of them shall put their
true dilygence and effectual endeavors for the due execution of this his
gracious proclamation, and to make relation of the offenders thereof to the
said commissioners assigned for search of corn, or to the lord Chancellor
of England and other his most honorable counsel from time to time, as shall
