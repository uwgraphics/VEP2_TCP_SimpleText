By the King.
A Proclamation concerning Felts.
WHereas We are credibly informed, That the workers and makers of Felts within
this Our Realm of England, Have heretofore daily employed and set on work
many Thousands of Our poor Subjects, both men, women and children, in Carding,
Basening, Felting, Dressing, Pouncing, Blocking and Dying, with certain other
feats, concerning the working and making of Felts, made and wrought within and
near Our City of London, and in diverse and many other Cities, Boroughes and
towns within this Our Realm of England, and Principality of Wales, whereby
Our said poor subjects have gotten their living time out of mind, until of
late years past, that very great abundance of Felts ready wrought and made in
the parts beyond the Seas, have been, and now daily are brought from foreign
parts into this Our Realm, and here have been and daily are uttered and sold,
to the utter undoing of great multitudes of Our loving Subjects, who for want
of employment as heretofore in making of Felts, are now destitute of means how
to live, and thereby fall to idleness, begging, and other inconveniences; We
therefore tendering the welfare of Our loving Subjects, do hereby straightly
prohibit and forbid all and every person and persons whatsoever, as well Our
natural borne Subjects, as Denizens or Strangers, either directly or
indirectly, from henceforth to vnship, discharge or lay on land, any Felts,
Hats or Caps, wrought or half wrought, in any parts beyond the Seas, at or in
any Port, Haven, Creek, or other place within this Our Realm of England, or
Principality of Wales, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such penalties
as by the Laws of this Our Realm of England, may be inflicted upon persons so
offending.

And for the better execution hereof, We do hereby further charge and command
all Customers, Controllers, and other officers of Our Ports, to whom it shall
appertain, and all Fermers of Our Customs and Imposts now, and for the time
being, their Clerks and substitutes, that they and every of them do forbear
to take any Entries of any Felts, Hats or Caps, made beyond the Seas, that
shall be brought into this Realm by any person or persons whatsoever, as they
and every of them will answer the contrary at their perils.

Given at Roystone the second day of December, in the xj. year of Our Reign
of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the 37.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. Anno Dom. 1613.
