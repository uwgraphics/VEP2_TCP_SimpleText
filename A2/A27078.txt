Reverendissimo in Deo PATRI EDVARDO, Dignissimo DOMINO NORWICENSI Episcopo,

Robertus Bayfield hanc suam primam Sectionem De Tumoribus a Sanguine ortis,
humillimo Dedicat animo;

Sibi persuadens tantum virum and maxim pium hanc esse acceptaturum.

TRACTATVS De Externis Tumoribus praeter naturam, In quatuor Sectiones
digestus, multisque observationibus adornatus.
Sectio prima.
De Tumoribus a Sanguine ortis.
Caput primum.
De Corpulentia nimia.
(...), Corpulentia nimia.
seu Corpulentia nimia, is an overgreat increase of the Bodies bulk, caused by
too much plenty of Flesh and Fat.

The increase of Flesh is caused through plenty of good Blood, Causa.
made by a temperate Liver out of meats of good juice, the hot and moist temper
of the musculous parts of the body thereunto assisting. The increase of fat is
caused by the oyliness and fattiness of the blood, falling out of the veins
into the membranous parts, and there congealed (as Jonston says) by the
moderate heat and efficacy of the said parts.

Signs are needless. Signa.
The consequences thereof, are, an hindrance of the motions and operations of
the body: also shortness of breath, by reason of the passages being stopped.

Qui impinguantur in prima aetate morti repentinae, Pregnostica.
apoplexiae, paralysi, syncopi, diarrhoeae propter humiditatem ipsorum, and
pulsui cordis, expositi sunt: Nec generantes, nec producentes embryonem; sperma
enim ipsorum est paucum. Sicut idem fere mulieribus quae pingues sunt, accidit;
etenim cum concipiunt, abortiunt.

For the Cure; Curatio.
first the Liver vein must be opened, from whence let a small quantity of blood
be drawn.

Secondly, the Patient must shun all such things as generate blood too
plentifully, and use a very spare diet; for as Sennertus says, Jejunium, and a
cibo abstinentia frequentior, and tenuis diaeta plurimum ad corpulentiam
minuendam facit. Let his Wine be thin, and well diluted, or made small with
water.

Thirdly, Purgationes frequentes ex aloe convenient, ideoque pilulae de tribus
utiles. Vt and amara and calida exhibita, absinthium, ruta, oxymel scilliticum,
Syrupus de duabus and quinque radicibus, and diuretica omnia. Quapropter
radices asparagi, foeniculi, petroselini, raphani sylvestris, and similes, in
frequenti usu esse debent. The three former roots may be boiled in broth, and
the bark of the latter is to be infused in white wine.

In mentem revoco, Observatio.
unum ex proximis mihi vicinis corpulentia nimia vexato and affecto, direxisse
and docuisse, ut infusione raphani sylvestris in vino albo uteretur: cujus usu
brevissimo temporis spatio ejus ingens molis corporeae incrementum valde
extenuatum est, and diminutum; ita ut ambulare and respirare facile posset.

Gallen tells us in his 14. Book of the method of Curing, and 15. Chapter, that
he on a time perfectly cured a man aged about forty years, who was exceeding
fat and gross, even to the admiration of all that beheld him; and this he did,
partly by an Antidote compounded and prepared of Sal-theriack, adversus morbos
articulares; and partly by the administering of the right Theriaca or Treacle
made of Vipers; as also by an extenuating diet after it; and for his exercise,
swift running was enjoined him.

This powder following is much approved of, and commended.

Recipe salis nitri. i. alumin.. ii. myrrhae, thuris, cortic. lign. guaiaci,
radic. sarsaparillae an. ii. Fiat pulvis. Of the which let half a dram be
administered in the morning for two months together.

Caput 2.
De Phlegmone, seu inflammatione.
(...), Phlegmone.
seu inflammatio legitima, is a Tumor begotten of pure blood, moan.
and is specially incident to the fleshy parts.

Quo ad Causam and Signa, vide meum enchiridion Medicum, lib. 3. pagin. 277.

The end or termination of this tumor is twofold, viz. resolution and
suppuration.

Si materia non est adeo multa, non crassa, non loco nimis profundo sita, non
sub crassa and densa cute conclusa; si corpus non est impurum, and natura
fortis est; resolutio, and per insensibilem transpirationem evacuatio sperari
potest: and it is a plain token that it does resolve, if there grow a certain
lightness in the member, the pulsation wasting away.

Si vero materia est copiosior, and crassior, loco profundiore contenta, and
sub cute densiore conclusa, suppuratio est expectanda. Tumors which are near to
the inner parts, Prognostica.
and noble entrails, are very dangerous, and oftentimes deadly; as also those
which seize upon great vessels, as veins, arteries, and nerves, for fear of
great effusion of blood, wasting of the spirits, and convulsion.

Eventus malus est, quando inflammatio, si est externa, evanescit, and ad
parts internas retrocedit: which may be known by the sudden diminishing of the
tumor, and a speedy following of a Fever, with other evil accidents.

Eventus bonus est, quando natura vincit materiam inflammationem parientem;
quod accidit, quando tumor vel resolvitur, and materia insensibiliter exhalat,
qui optimus solutionis inflammationis modus est; vel quando materia in pus
mutatur, and suppuratur.

Now if this Tumor Phlegmon be not resolved and evaporated, it must needs come
to pass, that the matter do either ret re back, as before I hinted, or
suppurate, or corrupt and putrefie, which you may know by the black or leady
color, and stinking savor; or else grow into a scirrhous hardness; So
Sennertus says, that inflammatio plerumque in scirrhum abit, quando materia
est nimis viscosa and dura, and calor naturalis fortis, vel mox in principio
nimis fortia discutientia adhibentur, quae tenuiores parts discutiunt, and
crassas relinquunt. And those Imposthumes which do degenerate into a Scirrhus,
are of long continuance and hard to cure; as also those which are in hydropick,
leprous, scabby and corrupt bodies; for they often turn into malign and
ill-conditioned Ulcers.

There be four times observed in this tumor; beginning, augmentation, state,
and declination.

Principium est, cum implentur parts sanguine, and tumor, dolor, ac tensio
adhuc exigua est. But when the swelling, pain, and stretching out are
increased, then is the augmentation.

Status est, quando tumor, tensio, dolor; ac omnia symptomata sunt
vehementissima. And lastly, the declination is then said to be, when the matter
generating the Tumor is diminished, the pain, heat, together with the other
symptoms, are become more remiss and gentle; or otherwise materia in pus
mutatur.

Now as touching the cure of a Phlegmon; Curatio.
first, you must remember, that the very beginning or increase, is the fittest
time to open a vein.

Secondly; take with you this general observation; that you apply not
repercussives, if the tumor be in the glandulous parts, or the matter be
venomous, or thick and unapt to slide back, or if it be near situate to a
principal member.

Thirdly; A principio morbi observandae sunt sex res non naturales, quae sunt
istae; aer, cibus and potus; motus and quies; somnus and vigilia; repletio,
inanitio; and accidentia animi.

Aer in hoc casu sit clarus, and ad frigidum declinet. Victus sit tenuis,
frigidus and humidus. Abstineat a vino, and loco ejus bibat vinum granatorum
cum julepo ^os. and aqua hordei. Motus non convenit, sed omnino quiescat.
Somnus diuturnus est vitandus, and maxim meridianus. Repletio est omnino
fugienda ut and venus. Alvus sit semper mollis.

Fourthly; the accidents incident to this tumor, as pain, regression of the
matter, putrefying of the part, and hardness, are carefully to be removed, when
need requires.

Pain is to be mitigated by asswaging medicines called Anodyna; such as oleum
amygdal. dulcium, Sambucinum, Anethinum, Chamaemelinum, etc. Likewise Mucilago
altheae, Seminis lini, Faenugraeci, Malvae, etc. See my Enchiridion medicum,
lib. 3. cap. 31. page 279.

If there be regression of the matter to the inner parts, it must be revoked by
cupping-glasses, or attractive medicines; such as these: Adeps ursinus,
leoninus, Aristolochia longa, Cantharides, Euphorbium, Fermentum, Galbanum,
Pyrethrum, Sinapi, Viscum, etc. Or compounds, contrived of these, as need
requires.

If the part putrify, use many and deep scarifications, and after wash the
place cum aqua salsa, and then apply a plaster, ex fabarum aut orobi farina
cocta in oxymellite.

As for the hardness that sometime remains, it must be mollified with
convenient means, such as may be found in this, or the Chapter de bubone.

Caput 3.
De Bubone.
(...), seu Bubo, Bubo.
is an Inflammation of the kernels which are seated in the Arme-pits, or in the
Groins.

It may be divided into two kinds, simple and malign. The simple Bubo (which
I now treat of) is that that follows humoral Fevers, or pains of any parts:
The malign is to be divided into venereous and pestilent. The venereous Bubo
follows in the next place; and as touching the pestilential, I have treated of
that sufficiently in the last Chapter of my Enchiridion medicum.

The cause is, blood slipped into the kernels, Causa.
together with a vicious humor provoking nature to expulsion.

The signs are, Signa.
a stiff swelling that yields not to the touch, with redness, pain, and a light
Fever.

Bubo's which be neither malignant nor contagious, Prognostica.
being in the extreme parts of the body, and soon suppurated, are not
dangerous: but when they ripen slowly, the cure is doubtful, because they may
turn to dangerous Fistula's.

Those Bubo's that are bred or excited under the Arme-holes are sooner
maturated, since that they arise from a hotter kind of blood, than those that
are seated in the groins.

Omnium tardissime matur antur bubones post aures, utpote qui oriuntur a
materia frigidiore, and sunt in loco frigidiore.

The cure is in a manner all one with the cure of other inflammations; Curatio.
only stronger medicaments must be used, quia pars affecta frigidior.

If the matter of the Bubo be of a swift motion, and gather readily unto the
place, then discuss the same first with gentler means, and afterward with
stronger. The gentler means:

Recipe olei liliorum i. olei chamomil.. ss. misce. Another.

Recipe Emplastri de meliloto, Emplastri de mucilagine, ana.. ii. olei
liliorum, q. s. misce, and fiat Emplastrum. A stronger sort.

Recipe diachilonis magni. iiii. olei irini q. s. fiat ceratum. Another.

Recipe ammoniaci, bdellii, opopanacis in aceto dissolut. ana. i. terebinthinae
lote. i, ss. Florum chamomill., sambuci, anap. ss. pull. ireos florent.. ss.
olei chamomil. q. s. fiat emplastrum.

But if you find the matter unapt to be resolved, then it must be brought to
suppuration, and cured by all such means as are mentioned in the following
chapter. Commendatur Rulandi Balsam. sulfuris and emplastrum.

Caput 4.
De Bubone venereo.
BVbo venereus, Bubo venereus.
is an inflammation of the glandules in the Flank, gotten by some venereous
touch: for the virulency of the Lues venerea is sometimes communicated to the
Liver, which if it have a powerful expulsive faculty, it expells it into the
groins, as the proper emunctories thereof.

The antecedent cause is a contagious humor, Causa.
procured by some touch of venery. The conjoined (for the most part) is corrupt
and infected blood.

The Tumor is hard with pain, Signa.
heat, etc.

Venereal Bubo's proceeding from a hot, Prognostica.
acrid and chollerick humor, and associated with great pain and heat, do often
degenerate into virulent and corroding Ulcers.

Bubones in ingutnibus si sint duri, and non suppurantur facile, and qui modo
erumpunt, modo evanescunt, curatu sunt difficiles; quia materiam pertinacem,
and naturae in expellendo imbecillitatem significant.

But if they be easily suppurated, and the strength firm, and especially the
Liver strong, they are arguments of a more benign disease; and such Bubo's, if
they be kept open a long while, may bring perfect health.

For the Cure, Curatio.
you must not use repercussives, because that the matter is virulent: neither
must you use discussing medicines, lest resolving the more subtle part, the
grosser dregs become impact and concrete there. Only attractive and
suppurating medicines are here to be used.

If the matter of the Bubo comes on but slowly, it must be drawn forward by
fomenting the place cum oleo and aqua calentibus: or with some Epitheme, ex
decoctione Lilii, Altheae, violariae, malvae, Sem. lini and Faenugraeci. Also
the applying of Cupping-glasses is very effectual to draw it forth; And a
gentle sweat may be procured with this mixture following.

Recipe decoctionis cardui benedicti and sarsaparillae. vi. Theriacae antiquae,
mithridati optimi, ana. i. ss. vel. ii. misce and siat Haustus.

Next apply this or the like plaster, to bring it to suppuration.

Recipe Foliorum malvae, violariae, ana M. ii. Rad. altheae lb. ss. Capitum
liliorum alborum. iiii. Coquantur, and contundantur, addendo farinae triticeae,
vel hordeaceae, q. s. olei communis, butyri, ana. iii. pinguedinis porcinae.
ii. ss. vitellorum ovorum, numero ii. Fiat emplastrum.

When the tumor is fully ripe, if it break not of its own accord, make speedy
issue, or vent, by incision or caustic; and then follow the ordinary way of
mundifying, incarning, and cicatrizing.

Moreover, if need require, the patient shall be let blood, and the humors
evacuated by a purging medicine, but not before the perfect maturity thereof,
lest natures motion be hindered, and so the party fall into the venereous
disease.

Caput 5.
De Phygethlo.
(...), Phygethlon.
seu Panus, is an hard swelling, sometimes arising after Fevers or pains in the
kernels or Almonds of the ears. This inflammation of the glandulous
emunctories, is broader, and with less swelling then the others be: which is
his difference.

Ut Phyma a sanguine pituitoso, Causa.
ita Phygethlon sive Panus a sanguine bilioso ortum habet, ut Galenus docet;
and therefore the more Erysipelas like. Also sometime it arises from an ulcer
or a bruise. Fit autem fere hic tumor post febres, aut post dolores partis
alicujus; maximeque eos, qui ventrem infestarunt.

Phygethli signa sunt tumor, Signa.
durities, calor, distensio, and dolor major, quam pro magnitudine tumoris,
interdum and febris accidit. Tarde hoc tumoris genus maturatur, neque recte in
pus convertitur.

Panus qu^ fit ex ulcere, Prognostica.
dolor, vel collissione, vel ex aliqua caussa externa, periculo vacat. At qui
febribus supervenit, sicut praecipue tempore pestilenti fieri solet, pessimus
and periculosissimus est.

Concerning curation, Curatio,
a word or two may suffice; especially for him that is any thing well exercised
in the general rumors. After meet evacuation, ordain your local medicines both
repressing and discutient.

Recipe urinae pueri, lb. i. vini albi fortiss. lb. ss. alb. ovorum number. ii.
contus. aquae rosarum rub.. ii. fiat fotus. and apply it warm with flax.

If the pain be sharp, or the matter unapt to be discussed; then this
Cataplasme following may be used.

Recipe far. hordei, and faenugraeci, ana. iii. decoquantur in aqua and oleo
chamomelino vel irino, vel anethino, vel ex semine lini, and fiat cataplasma.

If the matter of the tumor be exceeding hard, you may use oleum ligni
guajaci, which is much commended. Quod vero ad excellentissimum omnium
remediorum;

(...). Moisten a little hirds therein and apply it. It is admirable to
consider the wonderful effects this unguent has wrought, almost in all kinds
of tumors and pains.

A kinsman of mine in this City was very much troubled with a Phlegmon
Scirrhodes on his lower lip, Observatio.
about the bigness of a small hens egg, exceeding painful and hard; insomuch
that a Gangrene or mortification was feared. I moistened a pledget of towe or
hirds in the ointments aforesaid, and applied it over night: The next day the
Tumor was softened, and the pain not a little assuaged: after the second
application it was much softer; but after the third, it brake of its own
accord, from whence there did run forth much filthy matter, and so he was
cured: But I remember about the beginning or increase of the Tumor, I gave him
this potion, which wrougth very well.

Recipe diacatholiconis. i. Syrupiros. Alex. ex 9. infus.. i. ss. decocti
communis q. s. misce and f. potio. And I applied a vesicatory behind on his
neck to draw back the rheum, which flowed abundantly out at his mouth.

I could here insert many observations of mine own, touching the admirable
virtue of this unguent; but at present, thus much shall suffice by way of
digression. If you would be further satisfied concerning Phygethlon that
spurious inflammation; read Forestus lib. 1. De tumoribus praeter naturam,
observatio vii. or if you please to look into the Chapter de Parotide in my
Enchiridion Medicum, and into that de Bubone, vel de Bubone venereo in this
Book, you may find plenty of remedies.

Caput 6.
De Phymate.
(...) is a round swelling of the kernels smaller and flatter than the
Phygethlon, Phyma.
less red and less painful, which soon comes to its height and turns to
suppuration. Vel est tuberculum furunculo simile, sed rotundius and planius,
saepe etiam majus.

Caussa seu humor Phyma excitans est sanguis, Causa.
non purus, sed pituitosus, ideoque inflammatio minus magna est, and tumor hic
ad Inflammationem (...) pertinet.

The signs are, a round tumor, Signa.
and even, exceeding the quantity of half an egg; the pain and inflammation is
lesser then in furunculo: see the definition. Oritur frequentius in pueris,
raro in juvenibus, rarius in adultis.

Tumoris hoc genus periculo vacat, Prognostica.
cito augetur, and plerumque absque medicamentorum open suppur atur and sanatur.

Facilius curatur in pueris: difficilius in juvenibus and adultis.

First, Curatio.
in the beginning or increase of the tumor, a vein may be opened.

Secondly, if need require, administer a cooling clyster, and prescribe a sit
and convenient diet.

Thirdly, the pituitous blood impact in the place, if it be thin, must be
discussed; ideoque Galenus abrotanum commendat, parietariam, urticam, radices
altheae, and ammoniacum melle emollitum. But if the matter be too thick to be
resolved, then apply this ripening Cataplasme.

Recipe pulv. rad. altheae, farinae tritici, lupin. ana. i. caricar. pingu.
number. vi. fermenti. ss. Coq. and add caepam sub cinerib. coct. number. i. ol. lil.
alb. q. s. F. Cataplasma. Also Diachylum cum gummis, and emplastrum de
mucilaginibus, are very good for the same purpose; sed pulticula ex farina
tritici cum butyro and croco parata maxim valet.

When it comes to suppuration, open it, unless it break of its own accord.
Afterward proceed by accustomed art, to mundifie it, if it be foul, to fill
with flesh that that is hollow, and to seal it up with a cicatrice when it
comes to be even: See the Chapter de furunculo. Pellis leporis recens imposita
Phyma curat.

Caput 7.
De Furunculo.
(...) seu Furunculus, Dothien.
a Felon, is a little swelling sharppointed, not exceeding the largeness of a
Pigeons egg, remarkable for its redness and pain when it tends to suppuration.

It springs from thick blood, Causa.
and is thereby distinguished ab inflammatione; and the said blood is not much
adust, and so it is differenced a carbunculo.

Its signs are known by the definition. Signa.
Also this kind of tumor, for the most part, breaks of its own accord, and
the matter that issues is thick, and like putrified sinews.

A Furuncle by nature is not perilous, Prognosticum.
as Celsus writes, though no cure be applied thereto; yet pain makes medicines
more welcome, for the sooner dispatch of the matter.

For the Cure, Curatie.
first it will be convenient to open a vein, if age, strength, and time of the
year hinder not.

Secondly, the impulsion, or thronging in of the blood, is to be inhibited (if
neither the thickness of the matter, nor nearness of the noble parts hinder
not) by repellent medicines, all which may be ordered according as is set down
in the Chapter de Phlegmone in my Enchiridion medicum: yea the fittest time for
repercussives is, in the beginning, while the matter violently flows in, but
in the state and declination maturatives, as triticum mansum and impositum, vel
sicus siccae hydromelite incoctae. vel. Picis navalis. i. adipis suilli. v.

Thirdly, when the tumor is opened, purge the same with this mundificative.

Lastly, you must proceed to the consolidation with this emplaster.

A young man in this City being troubled with a Furuncle upon the joint of his
middle finger, Observatio.
next the wrist on his right hand, I caused him to bathe the tumor over night
with that excellent ointment which you have in the Chapter de Phygethlo; the
next day it brake of its own accord, and so healed without the use of any thing
else.

All that my Apothecary uses in the cure of a Felon, is, unguentum album; and
emplastrum de mucilaginihus: The method he observes in the use of them you
have in the Chapter de Paronychia.

Caput 8.
De Parotide.
(...) is an Inflammation of the kernels behind the ears, Parotis.
proceeding from blood, either pure or mixed with vicious humors. For these
Glandules or Emunctories of the brain, being spongy and loose, are fit to
receive the excrements thereof.

Also they are endued with most exquisite sense, by reason of a nerve of the
fifth Conjugation spread over these parts; and therefore no wonder it often
falls out, that their pains are vehement and sharp.

Of these some are critical, the matter of the disease somewhat digested being
sent thither by the force of nature; others symptomatical, the excrements of
the brain increased in quantity, or other quality, rushing thither of their own
accord.

Quo ad Causam and Signa, Prognostica.
vide meum Enchiridion medicum, lib. 3. cap. 16.

The critical Parotis tends naturally to suppuration: and it is difficult to
be cured, especially when it is caused by a gross, tough, and viscid tumor,
sent thither by the Crisis.

The symptomatical ends best by resolution: but if it be not cunningly
resolved, it turns often into a Scirrhous tumor. And if it spring from crude
and undigested matter, it is dangerous, because the place is so nigh the brain.

This disease does more grievously afflict young men than old; and it commonly
brings a fever and watching.

Parotides quae sine febre oriuntur, minus malignae sunt, and minus periculi
habent, quam quae sunt cum febre.

Minus etiam periculosa sunt, quae febres longas sequuntur, qu^m quae acutas,
and praecipue in malignis and pestilentibus accidunt.

Salutares quoque sunt and curatu faciliores, aegrosque a periculo liberant,
quae critice erumpunt.

But those which happen in the end of a disease, after other evacuations,
without the abatement of the symptoms, periculosae and perniciosae sunt.

In the cure, Curatio.
we must not use repercussives at the beginning, especially if the abseess be
critical; for so we should infringe the endeavors of nature forcibly freeing
it self from the morbifique matter, But we must much less repel or drive back,
if the matter of the tumor be venenate; for so the reflux thereof to the noble
parts would prove mortal.

Yet some astringency may be allowed, (I mean in the Parotis not critical) lest
the defluction should be so violent, and the pain so fierce, that thence there
may be fear of watchings, and a Fever. So that Galen thinks it will be
expendient, with many resolving medicines to mix some repelling. Wherefore at
the beginning let this or the like Pulteis be applied.

Recipe Far. hord. and sem. lini, ana. ii. Coquantur cum mulso aut decocto
cham. addendo but. recen. and olei cham. ana. i. fiat Cataplasma. Or it may be
made ex medulla panis, (I mean wheaten bread) urina puerorum infusa; or, ex
farina fabarum, aqua and oleo chamomelino decocta, putting last of all,
mucilaginem psyllii.

Also it will be profitable to use somewhat more strong discussing and
resolving medicines; such as you may find in the Chapter de Bubone.

If the humor does there concrete and grow hard, then use that incomparable
ointment set down in the Chapter de Phygethlo. But if it tend to suppuration,
the case in one with the critical Parotis: then shall you further it with
suppurating medicines, such as may be found in the chapter de Furunculo, or de
Phymate, or in that de Phygethlo. Lastly, for your further satisfaction, see my
Enchiridion medicum, lib. 3. cap. 16. page 260.

Caput 9.
De Paronychia seu Panaritio.
(...), Paronychia.
is an abscess, or inflammation, gathering in the roots of the nails,

Quo ad Causam and Signa, vide meum Enchiridion medicum, lib. 3. cap. 43.

Pro humoris benignitate malum nunc mitius, Prognostica.
nunc deterius est. Si enim materia sit benignior, symptomata sunt minus
vehementia.

Contra, si materia sit maligna, malum periculosum est, quod tamen ligamenta,
and nervos vicinos corrumpit, it a saepe, ut extremus articulus cum osse
abscedat, interdum totus digitus corrumpatur. Yea sometime the pain in this
tumor is so great, that it purchases a Fever, alienation of the mind, and
swooning: Also a Gangrene or Sphacele, which being neglected brings death.

The Cure is contrived by evacuation, Curatio.
mitigation of pain, and suppuration: concerning which, see my Enchiridion
medicum, page 300.

If the pain be sharp, you may use opii. i. cum lacte, croco, and vitello ovi.

Although some will not admit of repellers, for fear of exasperating the pain,
and fixing the humor: yet if the matter be thin and fit for resolution, it may
be discussed and spent out, as Weckerus says, by using first warm wine, and
after oil of roses.

But if it be thick and rebellious to resolution, maturate the same with this
Cataplasme.

Recipe mucilag. sem. psyllii,. i. farinae sem. lini, faenugraeci, ana. iii.
vitell. ovi i. croci. i. pingued. gallinae, butyri rec. ana. i. misc. F.

I remember, Observatio.
a Gentlewoman in this City, being troubled with Paronychia, was freed from her
vehement pain, and cured, only by the use of that excellent ointment set down
in the Chapter de Phygethlo.

My Apothecary has cured very many; and all the method he observes is this;
he spreads a little unguentum Album on a cloth, and applies it to the
imposthume; so he does every night, for three nights together: Then he applies
once a day a plaster de mucilaginibus, until it be whole. The ointment (as he
says) does ripen it, and ease pain; and the plaster does break it and heal it.

Moreover, for the cure of a Paronychia, oleum Saturni laudatur ab Agricola,
and Mucus aurium impositus cum corio anguillae.

Lastly; Ad morbos, et unguium vitia pertinent non solum panaritium, sed and
spasmus, leprositas unguium, albedo maculosa, faeda citrinitas, scissura, and

If the skin by a bruise be separated from the flesh, so as it remain hanging

cut it away, and so apply drying medicines; vel absque deligatura locum sic

For the Cure; Curatio.
if the disease be great, to prevent inflammation, first let the liver vein of
the right arm be opened; and then next (if nothing hinder) turn the stream
another way, by revulsive blood-letting on the contrary part; or by ligatures,
etc.

Also in his diet, there ought to be a measured mixture of purging matter, as

his meats sod with Mummia and Rhapontick.

Now for the blood clodded under the skin, if it be so all over the body, or in

down in the cure of a Phlegmon. See my Enchiridion medicum, lib. 3. cap. 31.
page 280. and 281. Or turn to the Chapter de Furunculo in this book.

If the part incline to a Gangrene, scarrifie the same, and wash it with hot
vinegar, wherein radix sigilli Salomonis has been boiled.

A certain man in this City falling out with another at play, Observatio.
and struggling together, was so dangerously bruised all over his Abdomen,
against the edge of a table, that he could not move, breathe, or cough, without
much difficulty: Some time after, I being sent for, (through Gods blessing)
cured him with this Apozem following:. Rhabarbari electi. ii. Seminis
faeniculi,. ii. Decoctionis communis. ix. Fiat infusio: In qua dissolve Syrupi
rosarum sol. i. Syrupi de rhabarbaro. ss. F. Apozema. He took half thereof over
night about then of the clock, and the other half in the morning about seven.

Also I have found by experience that Diacatholicon is a very good remedy in
inward contusions: and my Apothecary tells me he has cured many therewith;
yea even those that have been desperately bruised: the Dose is. i. in the
common decoction; to which may be added a little Syrupus de rhabarbaro.

It happened not long since, that my Brothers little lad fell in the Kitchen
with his face against the iron Cradle, which bruised and wounded his forehead:
I caused him to be dressed once every day with a pledget of lint dipped in ol.
hyperici, and so in a short time he was cured, without using any thing else.

A certain young man fell from an high place, and all his members were bruised,
so that he seemed to be at deaths door. Pater ipsius accepit favos cum melle,
and coxit in vino ad consistentiam unguenti, which he spread upon the skin of a
wether newly killed, and therein wrapped the Patient: which being repeated for
three days together, he was prefectly cured. In particular contusions this
ointment is spread upon a linen cloth, and applied, and presently works the
cure.

I read of a certain Captain, who by a fall was bruised, and wounded in his
right side upon his short ribs; so that much blood came away, and he was
perpetually tormented with a most cruel pain in the bruised part, so that he
could hardly move, speak, breathe, or cough, but he was forced to cry out with
pain. Dr. Simon Jacoz, a most expert Costensian Physician, being called to him,
caused a vein presently to be opened on the Arm of the same side, and a
Plaster de cumino to be applied partibus dolentibus; which having been on
twelve hours, and once renewed in that time, dolor valde imminutus est, lividus
partis color disparuit, melius spiravit, ac sequenti die e lecto surgere
caepit; and so after one day more, the pain went quite away.

Some have found great comfort, by the use of this ointment following.

(...) is a perfect mortification of a part which sieseth not only the softer
parts of the body, Sphacelus.
but the bones themselves.

This malady is far more dangerous then the former. For the part that is taken
with the Sphacele can no way be restored and made sound, but is forthwith to be
cut off, to prevent present death; before which there usually precede Dotings,
Watchings, syncope, convulsiones, ructus, singultus, and a cold sweat breaking
forth over all the body.

Caput 12.
De Carbunculo.
(...), Carbunculus.
seu Carbunculus, is a Tumor springing from adust, thick, and most fervent
blood, degenerating into black Choler, which corrupts the part. Vel est
pustula parva, venenosa, locum comburens, inprimis vesicam, deinde crustam
faciens.

Use has so prevailed with us, as to understand no otherwise of a Carbuncle,
then a pestilent tumor, and symptom; it shall be good therefore, somewhat to
change our custom, and with Vigo divide it into two kinds: Pestilent and not
Pestilent. Now in this place I shall chiefly treat of the Carbuncle not
Pestilent; because the other I handled before; as you may see in the last
Chapter of my Enchiridion medicum.

The Cause is black, Causa.
thick, hot, and faeculent blood, flowing into the place, which is conjectured
by the state of the body, abounding with blood: for the other comes of a
venomous constitution of the air, which once taken in, is afterward expelled
by nature to some outward parts, together with the humors, and spirits, that
were by it defiled.

The Signs are these following; Signa.
A Crusty Ulcer arises, blackish or ash-colored; sometimes, not long after, a
round Bubo, sharp and burning, breaks forth, qui circa vesperum exasperatur:
otherwhiles it is found without any pustule, only the Ulcer is in all sorts
crusty.

Moreover there is itching, and the flesh round about is very red and inflamed:
also great and grievous pain, with a Fever. If any venomous matter be lurking,
then there is stomachsickness, vomiting, loss of appetite, trembling and
panting of the heart, swoonings, ravings, etc.

Carbunculus, ut nonnulli aiunt, in triplici differentia reperitur. Rubeus
scilicet, citrinus, and niger; rubeus a materia sanguinea adusta exoritur, and
non est multae venenositatis. Citrinus a materia cholerica adusta pervenit;
niger vero a materia melancholica adusta and venenosa; Prognostica.
omnes istae species sunt exitiales, juxta Rhasis sententiam. Verum carbuncili
nigri sunt pejores omnibus, and pauci ab his evadunt, authore Avicenna.

Those are less dangerous which appear first red, (without any pustule) and
afterward yellowish.

Sunt etiam illi Carbunculi minus perniciosi, qui sunt parvi, quam qui sunt
magni; and ex parva pustulae subito ingentem magnitudinem acquirunt.

If a Carbuncle come in the clensing places, called emunctories, and prope
membra principalia, lethalis est; timendum enim est, ne ad partem aliquam
principem materia haec venenosa recurrat.

If it break out about the stomach, or jaws, it suddenly choketh, for the most
part.

Carbuncles commonly come of causes generally reigning; and for the most part
are attendants on the Plague: and then the symptoms are stronger, as I hinted
before.

Curatio Carbunculi est difficillima, si post febrem pestilentem erumpit, the
heart being possessed by malignant humors. Omnis crisis semper est bona,
praeterquam in pestilentiali febre.

The Cure is easier, if it break out before, unless violent symptoms appear
soon after.

The manner of proceeding in the Cure is this. Curatio.
First, prescribe a fit and convenient diet. In respect of the Fever cooling
things must be used; but in respect of contagion, such things as assist the
heart. See my Enchiridion medicum, lib. 2. cap. 12. page 160.

Secondly, Let a vein be opened at the beginning (if nothing hinder) to take
away fervent blood.

Thirdly, Humor malignus praeparetur and mitigetur, ubi scabiosa praecipue
valet; discutit enim, and insensibiliter dissolvit. It may be eaten or drunk
out of wine.

Fourthly, if need require, gentle Glisters may be given, but no other purgers;
because of the acute Fever.

Fifthly, outward medicines applyable to the place, must be discutient, or
meetly repressing: if so be the fluxion be vehement, as is this: Recipe
Arnoglossi, lentium, medullae panis, parts aequales. Coq. in aceto, vel po^ca,
if not very vehement, in aqua vel vino, F. Cataplasma: quod bis vel ter
singulis diebus applicandum. Verum hoc ipsum medicamentum, aut similia, non
supra ipsum carbunculum, sed circa ipsum solum spatio trium digitorum est
apponendum. Now if the Carbuncle be pestilent, I counsel no repellent medicine,
till the matter be (for the most part) gathered, and then they are to be set as
a hedge between the Carbuncle and the heart; as also if the Carbuncle be out of
the emunctories, it is (as I may speak) to be paled about with them: for this
purpose also, Linimentum ex bolo Armeno cum q. s. ol. Rosati commendatur, but
it must be applied, as I hinted before, three fingers space round about the
Carbuncle.

Sixthly, The part must be scarified, (if nothing withstand) and after that
washed with warm salt water, that thereby the clotted blood may be clean purged
forth: and after it is washed, medicaments must be used which resist
putrefaction, especially made of Scabious and Devils-bit. For as Scabiosa, ita
Succisa plurimum commendatur, viridis trita and imposita, vel in vino cocta and
bibita.

Seventhly, Si scarificatio non prodest, urendum; sed ita, ut crusta statim
removeatur, lest if it remain upon the place, it prevent the breathing forth of
the malignant humor: and therefore apply thereto a Cataplasme ex farina orobi,
and oxymelite.

Si post applicationem ignis, aut causticorum, apparuerit circulus circa
carbunculum, scias quod carbunculus est mortificatus.

Eighthly, The Crust being removed, the ulcer must be cleansed cum melle rosac.
succo apii, and similibus. Deinde carne implendum, glutinandum, and tandem
cicatrice claudendum.

Mr. Denis Pomaret, Observatio.
a skilful Surgeon of Montpelier, does declare, that it was his hap to see
three Carbuncles, without any Fever, and without any other grievous symptom,
so that the patients continually followed their employments; one was in the
cheek, the other in the neck, and the third under the lower eyelid of the left
eye. All which (as he says) were cured with the same medicines, wherewith
Surgeons are wont to cure potential Cauteries, viz. Such as procure the
falling of the Eschar.

My Apothecary tells me that since the time he addicted himself to Surgery,
he has seen at least twenty Carbuncles, not pestilent.

Caput 13.
De Epinyctidibus, Terminthis, and Essere.
EPinyctides, Epinyctides.
are small Ulcers, which break out of their own accord, especially in the
night, in the eminent parts of the body, resembling bladders, which being broke
in sunder, blood-waterish matter runs forth.

(...) it a dicitur, (...), quoniam noctu generatur, ut Galenus, and Celsus
docet. Pliny terms them bluish pushes, disquieting especially in the night
time.

They arise from a wheyish and Causa.
melanchollick humor; like the Cause of a Carbuncle in all things save
malignity, and greatness of the tumor.

They are easily known; Signa.
for as Celsus says, they are either of a pale, or of a black color, or of a
white hew, not exceeding the bigness of a bean, arising either in the legs, or
in the feet. About them there is always a very vehement inflammation; and when
they are opened, there is found a very thick and clammy exulceration within.
His color is like unto his humor: but the pain or grief, which greatly
surpasses the bigness of the sore, increases in the night; propter atri
humoris motum, and frigus nocturnum poros cutis adstringens.

Quo ad pleniorem curationis cognitionem, vide infra, capite de Scabie.

Petrus Pachequus, Observatio.
in one of his observations, tells us, that when he could not by any medicines
heal certain Epinyctides, or Pushes, by a woman's advice they were anointed cum
oleo juniperino, and the patient thereupon slept quietly, whereas he had lain
sleepless before, and was prefectly cured.

Moreover, Terminthus.
some there are that refer the Tumor Terminthus unto these Epinyctides. But
that (if I mistake not) arises from black Choler. Now Terminthi (according to
Galen) are certain black pustules arising especially in the Thighs, resembling
in figure, color, and bigness, the fruit of Terminthi.

There is also another certain kind of Tumor, Essere.
which they call Essere, Sora, and Sare; to wit, when little Tubercles,
inclining to a red color, and somewhat hard, do suddenly and unexpectedly seiz
upon the whole body, together with an extraordinary and troublesome itching;
just as if the party had been pricked by Bees, or stung with Nettles.

These kind of Tubercles are referred, by some, unto the aforesaid Epinyctides
of the Greeks; but they differ, in regard that Epinyctides pour forth out of
them, a certain humor, which Essere does not, but vanishes, without any humor
issuing therefrom. Moreover the Epinyctides do afflict the Patient in the
night; as I hinted before, but the Essere break forth (for the most part, in
the day time.

Many things are commended by Authors, for cleansing and beautifying the skin;
as the roots of white Lillies, the flowers of Elder, bitter Almonds, Bean-Meal,
Camphyre, Oil of Tartar, and salt: All these do scour and cleanse.

Delicate and choice women to beautify their skin, do use to wash their faces
and hands in milk, with the powder of sweet Almonds, which makes them soft,
smooth, and fair. Indeed milk is very highly extolled for smoothing the skin,
and especially the milk of Asses and Goats: which Poppea the wife of the
Emperor Nero being not ignorant of (a woman extremely proud and luxurious) she
caused five hundred milch Asses always to attend her whithersoever she went;
and in a great Tub made purposely for her to bathe in, she washed her whole
body in the said milk, that so it might be all over freed from wrinkles, made
tender and delicate, and preserved white; as Pliny relates the story.

The signs are expressed in the description: Signa.
Moreover beside the pustules there is heat, or a little inflammation, with

Caput 5.
De Lichene seu Impetigine.
(...), Lichen.
seu impetigo, a Tetter or Ringworm are hard pustules upon the skin, which
spread themselves into the bordering parts, with dryness, roughness, and great
itching.

Impetigo dicitur quoque mentagra, and non differt a serpigine, nisi secundum
magis, and minus, and in figura. Nam serpigo incipit cum scabie sicca, and
longiori figura. Aliquando est magis ulcerosa, and humidior quam impetigo.

Lichen etiam impetigo Dicitur, quia cum impetu laedit; and serpigo a serpendo
vocatur, quia videtur serpere hinc inde. Illa ergo quae serpit serpigo dicitur,
sed quae stat, impetigo nuncupatur.

Pliny reports, that this evil, which he calls Mentagra, because it began
about the chin, crept first into Italy in the reign of Tiberius Caesar, and was
of so great filthiness and corruption, that any death was to be preferred or
wished before it; and also of so great infection, that by the swift passage
thereof, only by kissing one another it infected the people, but chiefly those
that were governors and rulers among them.

It arises from a thin, Causa.
sharp Chollerick wheyish juice, mingled with an earthy humor, qui a diaeta
simili procedit, and interdum vere, interdum Autumno ad exteriora defluit.

It Is known by what is in the definition expressed. Signa.
Moreover Galen seems to acknowledge this disease: for in his first Book De
Medicam. compos. secundum locos, he remembers a most vile kind of Impetigo of
the Chin, which (as he rehearses out of Crito) provokes itching, it
afflicts also the Patients, and brings them into no small danger. For
sometimes (says he) it runs over the whole face, and goes up to the very
eyes.

Affectus periculosus non est, Prognostica.
and recens ac mitis curatu facilis.

Impetigo vero quae fera est, and ab humore pejore oritur, difficilius curatur,
and in lepram transire potest.

For the Cure, Curatio.
first prescribe a fit and convenient diet, which must be neither salt nor
biting. Secondly, Si corpus fuerit plethoricum, mittatur sanguis. Thirdly,
Alter and evacuate the humors, if they too much offend.

ointment.. Litharg. auri and argenti per noctem in aceto acerrimo infusi and

I remember I cured a Tetter on my wrist cum oleo genistae. Some I have helped
cum unguento nicotianae: And other some I have cured with unguentum enulatum.

A certain Gentlewoman being extremely vexed with a fierce and filthy Tetter or
Ringworm on both her hands, and refusing the use of bleeding, purging, and all
other Remedies, was (in a few days) cured after this manner, as Petrus
Pachequus does declare.

Recipe unguenti rosati. iij. praecipitati albi. iij. mix them, and therewith
besmear the parts affected. Also another Matron of great quality being troubled
with the same Disease, was cured therewith.

This Cataplasme following is exceeding good to assuage the pain of Tetters..
Putria poma, number. vi. per set aceum transmitt antur, quibus add olei rosacei.
ij. lactis muliebris parum, fiat cataplasma, and utere. And this is to be
noted, that rotten Apples do more assuage pain, than roasted or boiled ones,
which always retain somewhat of the fire in them.

Moreover, for a Ringworm or Tetter, Take Tobacco ashes and a littlr alum
melted in your mouth with fasting spittle, mix them, and apply it to the place.
Also the juice of Figs, or of the leaves, do take away Tetters, Wheals,
Freckles, and Warts.

Cancrum.

The Signs are set down in the description. Signa.
Moreover, this Tumor grows and increases very slowly at the beginning; and
continues (as Theodoricus tells us) for one whole year no bigger then a
pustule, being as it were a very small and inconsiderable push; which
afterward and at all times creeps less then a Cancer; yea, as Rogerius
writes, the Cancer does corrode more in uno die, quam Noli me tangere in uno
mense. Ita autem dicitur, vel quod non debeat fricari; vel quia contagiosum
malum est.

This malady is hard to cure; Prognosticum.

About the Cure of this Tumor or Ulcer, Curatio.
it is to be noted, that in it nothing will any whit profit or avail (as it is
also in other Diseases) whilst the Cause still remains. Itaque primo ea
victus ratio instituendae est, quae tales humores adustos non solum non
generat, sed etiam eorum acrimoniam retundit atque corrigit: postea humores
illi pravi e corpore educendi sunt. Vide supra in capite de Herpete esthiomeno,
vel infra in capite de Scirrho.

Quantum ad localia, haec optima and experta sunt.

together in a leaden mortar, to the form of an unguent, which greatly asswageth
pain, and delayeth heat.

My Apothecary told me he has cured very many after this manner. Observatio.
Take a pledget of lint, and dip it in aqua spermatis ranarum, and apply it
upon the part affected, then apply upon that a plaster Diapalmae with the
powder argenti vivi; let the plaster be larger in compass than the pledget of
lint; that so it may hang on: do thus once every day until you perceive the
edges or circle to look white, for then you may conclude it is killed.

If the Disease be terrible, or the humor very rebellious, to one ounce of the
powder argenti vivi, you may add but four ounces of Diapalma; otherwise you
may put half a pound of Diapalma to one ounce of the powder. You must melt your
Plaster, and then mix your powder with it, for your use, as abovesaid; you
must continue the use of those two things, till all the filthy matter be eaten
away.

Moreover, there is another certain kind of Cancerous Tumor or Ulcer, much
like Noli me tangere, called of some Lupus, Lupus.
or the Wolf, especially when it happens in the Shins, Anklebones, and Thighs:
Of others, Cingulus, a Girdle, (when it arises and appears in the midst of
the body) as Guido tells us: It vehemently corrodeth, eating through the part
on which it seizes, and consumes the flesh of Hens and other creatures, if
applied thereunto.

Mauritius cordaeus relates a notable History, worthy of great observation.

There was (says he) a certain noble and choice woman, Historia.
living nigh unto the Castle of Nenue, that had all the right side of her face
possessed and overspread with a Cancer, and that likewise exulcerated of a
long time, insomuch that her face was most grievously tortured with pains and
griefs of all sorts. She having in vain and to no purpose at all sought for
help unto the Physicians, as well French as Italian, as Spanish, and Germans,
(together with other foreign Physicians) was at length perfectly cured by this
following expedite and speedy Remedy, that she had learned of an ordinary and
vulgar Barber-Chirurgion. Pullos illa gallinaceos in parts tenues) and latas
concidebat, the which she daily applied unto the part affected, oftentimes
changing and renewing them: Ab boe unico tandem remedio sanitatem pristinam
recuperavit.

I remember about twelve years past, I saw upon the face of a certain man in
this City a terrible Cancer, which was usually fed with flesh; It had great
lips, and a wide fistulous passage through his left cheek up into his jaw, the
which at last killed him.

excellent one for this purpose.

Caput 11.
De Pruritu.
(...), Pruritus.
Pruritus, or the itch, is a pain which stirs up a desire of scratching,
without any roughness or exulceration of the skin.

Subjectum est interdum totum corpus; praecipue Plantae pedum. Avicenna
distinguit pruritum a scabie; quod pustulis careat.

It arises, Causa.
either from. Choler, or thin salt phlegm, so as it may insinuate it self
between the smallest particles; but clammy and roping; that it may stick faster
to the parts: which is bred of salt and hot meats, through fault of an hot and
dry Liver.

Signa satis sunt manifesta: Signa.

Secondly, the humors must be fitted for evacuation with Goats-milk whey, and
syrup of fumitory: And then purged forth with some Apozem or Potion; such as
may be found in Erysipelatis curatione.

Thirdly, the Hemorrhoides and Courses, are to be provoked, if their stoppage
have been the cause.

Quantum ad localia, conferunt in hoc casu omnia balnea and unguenta in capite
de Scabie descripta.

Moreover, Observatio.
many have been cured (after bleeding and purging) by the use of unguentum
enulatum, rubbed only on the joints. For although some Empericks do (without
any distinction) anoint with unguents of Mercury all the parts of the body,
nisi caput, quod est periculosum; yet Avicen has strictly commanded the
contrary, viz. that we should not use them nigh the stomach, and alia membra
nobilia.

Domina Barker sicco pruritu duorum aut trium annorum spacio vexata est: At
last imploring my help, I prescribed this following mixture.

after which she became perfectly well, and was never troubled with the itch any

Caput 12.
De Combustionibus.
COmbustio. Combustio.
Burning, is a solution of Continuity of the scarf-skin, and commonly in the
skin it self, sometimes in the Muscles, Veins, Arteries, or Nerves, by the
force of fire.

Ipse ordo quodammodo exposcere videtur, ut de ambustu post ipsos biliosos
tumores dicamus: nam quemadmodum bilis inter elementa qualitate sua igni
respondet, ita and ambusta, vel ab igne vel a materia ignita excitantur.

Causa, Causa.
est vel ignis, vel aqua fervens, vel oleum, vel metallum liquefactum.
Moreover, Combustions may be occasioned by mineral waters, by Mercury, by
Gunpowder, and also by Lightning.

Touching the Signs, Signa.
it is neeedless to speak, seeing burning is manifest of it self. If the
Combustion be superficiary, the pain is most bitter and pricking, the skin
rises (unless speedily prevented) into pustules and blisters, wherein is
contained a thin subtle water of a white or yellowish color. If it be low or
deep in, it is covered with an Eschar or crust, the burnt flesh by the force of
the fire turning into that crusty hardness.

Quo ad prognostica, Prognostica.
combustiones abdominis difficulter curantur.

Si ambustio ad intestina usque penetret, lethalis est.

Periculosa quoque est inguinum ambustio, since that those places are moist,
and therefore the more fit to receive the afflux of humors.

Si combustio it a profunda sit, ut ad majores venas, arterias, nervos
penetret, periculosa est. For when the exsiccated vessels are contracted and
shut up, the Blood and the Spirit cannot then flow unto the affected part; from
whence there is caused an Atrophy, a Gangrene, and a deprivation of sense and
motion.

Ambustio a fulnrine etiam periculosa est, and plerumque lethalis.

Quo corpus purius est, eo facilius curatur ambustio.

For the Cure, Curatio.
we must labor to hinder the rising of blisters, by asswaging the pain, and
drawing forth the (...) or heat of the fire, which is done by holding the place
(especially if the burning be but small) by little and little, near the fire;
that so one heat drawing forth another, yon may keep it from blistering. For
which purpose also, the juice of Purslane, of Lettice, of Plantain, or of
Housleek, beaten with the white of an egg and oftentimes applied is very much
commended. So is unguentum nutritum, and also Populeon newly made. But remember
that you apply these Remedies warm; lest otherwise used they cause cruel pain
and consequently defluxion.

Lactuca cum sale illita prodest recens ambustis. Sic malvae folia oleo incocta
and trita sacris ignibus and ambust is utiliter imponuntur. In like manner the
leaves of Elder or Dane-wort boiled in Oil of Nuts, and beaten with a little
salt, is good.

Exceeding commendation is given to an ointment made of one part of Oyl-olive,
and two parts of whites of Eggs, beaten together, and frequently anointed on,
with the Feather of an Hen.

Sed mucilago seminis cydoniorum cum aqua rosarum extracta, and oleo lini
subacta; mox in principio adhibita, omnibus indicationibsn satis facit.

These two ointments following I have oftentimes used with most happy success.
Observatio.
The first;

. musci flavi super lapidem M. i. ss. vel M. ij. Axungiae porcinae lb. i. F.
unguentum s. a.

The second,. Axungiae porcinae vel butyri maialis lb. semis. foliorum hederae
M. iiij. Fiat unguentum secundum artem. Formius did use to boil the leaves of
Ivy in water, and so apply them for burns.

Moreover, it is an easy made and approved Remedy, if you presently after the
burning apply to the grieved part raw Onions beaten with salt. But you must
note, that this medicine takes no place, if once it be gone into an Ulcer:
neither is it good for burns in the eyes.

Thus I have given you variety of Remedies, fit to assuage the pain, and take
away the fiery heat, whereof some do it by a cooling faculty, by which they
extinguish the preternarural heat, and repress or keep back the blood and
humors, which flow into the parts by reason of heat and pain. Others endued
with contrary faculties, are hot and attractive; as which by relaxing the skin,
and opening the pores, resolve and dissipate the serous humors; which yield
both beginning, and matter to the pustules, and so by accident assuage the pain
and heat.

But if so be we cannot by these Remedies hinder the rising of blisters, then
we must presently cut them as soon as they arise, for that the humor contained
in them, not having passage forth, acquires such acrimony that it eats the
flesh which lies under it, and so causes hollow Ulcers.

For excoriations you shall apply such Remedies as are without acrimony, such
as unguentum album camphoratum, desiccativum rubrum, unguentum rosatum, made
without vinegar, or oil of Eggs tempered in a leaden mortar.

When the Combustion shall be so great as to cause an Eschar or Crust, the
falling away must be procured by the use of Emollients, as

Recipe unguenti basilici. i. olei rosac. amygd. lil. albor. ana 3, iij.

The Eschar being removed, the Ulcer must be cleansed with new butter washed
and mixed cum emplastro Stiptico, to the form of an unguent.

Then, to replenish it with flesh,

Recipe olei rosati. viij. olei ovorum. ij. vitri albiss. tenuissime triti,. i.

When the flesh is equal, and nothing but cicatrice wanting, apply this
unguent:. Diachilonis communis. ij. unguenti populeonis, ol. rosati, ana. iij.
mucilag. sem. cotoneorum in aqua rosacea extractae. iiij. vitellorum ovorum,
numero ij. fiat unguentum.

The Cicatrice being made, it shall be good to anoint the place every day with
ol. de vitellis ovorum. But remember, that in the mean time, while you follow
on the Cure, you look to his diet, that it be cooling and moistening.

Let Sorrel, Endive, Lettice, and Borrage be boiled in his broth: contra, a
calidis, acribus, salsis abstineat. Let him refrain from Wine, and drink Barley
water, or thin Posset ale. Also if need be, a vein may be opened and some
cooling Potion may be given, to evacuate superfluous humors.

If a man be burnt of Mercury, foment the place affected with linen clothes wet
in milk, and applied as hot as may be suffered, twenty times, or more; ever
renewing them as they wax cold: after that, with butter often heated, and poured
into cold water, vel in aqua ex semine ranarum, and labored to a most white
unguent, dress the place, to draw out the fire. Last of all, heal it as other
plain wounds. Pain of the teeth, and trembling of the hands, particular
accidents of this burning, may thus be remedied. Wash the hands in aqua vitae,
and gargle with aqua lavendulae.

Against the scalding of mineral water, or of melted metals (if any such
chance). Olei nucum lb. semis. sevi cervini, lib. i. butyri praeparati, lb. i.
semis. fiat unguentum, and utere. Vel

Recipe Adipis suillae, id est, lardi concislibram unam; let it be dissolved in
Rosewater, then strained through a linen cloth, then wash it four times with
the water of henbane, or some other of that kind, then let it be incorporated
with eight yelks of Eggs, and so make an ointment. It is a medicine which the
women in the Hospital of Paris do happily use against burns.

If the Combustion be occasioned by lightning, then sweat must be provoked by
the force of some Antidote. The Arteries, Lips, Tongue, and Nostrils must be
anointed with Treacle Wine.

If the part be burnt beyond hope of recovery,. Colophoniae, lb. i. picis
communis lb. semis. cerae. iij. olei and terebynthinae, quantum sufficiat,
malaxetur, and fiat emplastrum; which must be applied till the dead be divided
from the living flesh. Lastly, finish the healing with your Stipticum Plaster.

When the eyelids, lips, sides of the fingers, neck, the armpits, hams, and
bending of the elbow are burnt, you must have a great care that you suffer not
the parts to touch one the other, without the interposition of some linen rags;
otherwise in continuance of time they would grow and stick together.

If the Combustion shall happen in the face,. Albuminum ovorum numero ij. aquae

(...), Oedema.
is a swelling caused by Phlegmatic matter, which nature expells into the parts
of the Body. Vel ut Weckerus docet, est laxus quidam at que indolens tumor, ex
pituitoso humore in particulam aliquam influente exurgens.

Oedema aliquando est morbus, test Galeno, locis citatis. Aliquando vero est
symptoma, ut evenire solet in cruribus, and pedibus eorum, qui aqua inter cutem
laborant, and in tabidis, and aliis, qui malum corporis habitum patiuntur.

Quo ad Causam, Signa and Prognostica, vide meum Enchiridion Medicum, lib. 3.
page 285.

For the Cure, Curatio.
first prescribe a fit and convenient diet; lest the Patient eat such things as
may occasion phlegm and crudities.

Let his bread be well baked, his meats rather roasted then boiled, and such as
may generate good blood. His wine ought to be white, clear, and oderiferous.

Let the Patient use exercise before meat, so by little and little to spend
this humor, and restore the native heat.

Let him sleep little, because much sleep breeds cold humors; let him avoid
grief and sadness. And if he be of a weak body, let him abstain from venery,
lest he fall into an uncurable coldness, from whence a greater measure of
crudity will arise.

Secondly, prepare and concoct the humor with this Syrup:

Recipe Syrupi de Hysopo vel de absynthio, de staechade, oxymellit. scillitici,
ana. ij. semis. Aquae salviae, betonicae, foeniculi, major anae, ana. iiij.

purge with these Pills:. Pilularum cochiarum, Pilularum arthriticarum, ana.

potion, which I have often used with admirable success.. Diaphoeniconis. ij.

proves very effectual, praesertim si tumor est in partibus inferioribus, and
tunc commendatur ad revulsionem.. Pulveris folior. Asari. ss. vel gr. xv. vel.
i. oxymellit. simplicis q. s. misce.

Also a vomit may be made of the juice of the leaves; you may take seven, nine,
or eleven, stamp them, then put thereto a sufficient quantity of oxymel
simplex, strain it and give it the Patient.

In the mean time, to defend and strengthen the affected part, an Epithema may
be made ex duabus aceti partibus, and una aquae, wherein a new sponge being
dipped, minister it to the place; sed prius ungatur totus tumor cum oleo de
Chamomillae calido.

Deinde (si oedema in cruribus, seu pedibus, seu brachiis fuerit) cum fascia
ligetur membrum: But on such wise make your binding on the sponge, that the
beginning of your rolling be beneath, and the finishing above. If the former
Epithem be not sufficient;

omnium medicamentorum applicatione observare utile est, ut antequam Emplastra
seu guenta and Linimenta applicantur, prius pars calefiat, frictionibus and
fotibus; otherwise medicaments will scarcely do their duty, by reason of the
great coldness of the part, being not sufficient of it self to assimilate the
nourishment, or to expel the superfluous and unprofitable humor.

Let a fomentation be made ex decocto radicum brioniae, flor. sambucini,
Anethi, chamaemel. fol. betonicae, salviae, pulegii. calamenthi, origant,
hyssopi, absynthii, and similium. The frictions must be made of hot linen
clothes, for so the native heat together with the blood and spirits is
recalled to the part, and fuliginous humors contained under the skin are
resolved, whereby the strength of the part is very much recovered.

Si in Oedemate fuerit dolor, tunc.

In the tlme of the Cure, it will be good to give the Patient some of this
mixture, the quantity of a nut, an hour and a half before every meal.

Recipe confervae florum staechados, conservae rorismarini, ana. i. ss.

Also Lozenges Diarrhodonis Abbatis and aromatici rosati I have often given
with good success. Every morning fasting let the Patient eat a Lozenge
weighing. ij. For this vou must remember, that if the infirmity arise from the
stomach, or from any other part, the part from whence it comes must be
strengthened; if from the whole habit of the body, let attenuating penetrating
and opening medicines be prescribed.

If it come to an Ulcer, then whilst it is foul, cleanse it cum mundificativo
ex apio, or apply unguentum apostololorum: after it is cleansed, fill it up
with flesh; and when it is plain, cover it with a cicatrize, as in many other
places you are instructed.

his Daughter had an oedematous or phlegmatic tumor, upon the Region of her
Loins, as big as the palm of ones hand, crude and not come to suppuration, the
which (as he says) was discussed within a few days, by a Plaster framed of
one dram of crude mercury, and one ounce of Diapalma.

Caput 2.
De Emphysemate, seu inflatione.
(...), Emphysema.
inflatio, or a flatulent tumor, springs of a gathering of windy spirits,
either under the skin, or else under the membranes which cover and cloth the
bones or muscles.

Causa hujusmodi inflationum est caloris nativi imbecillitas, Causa.
in materia pituitosa a ad flatus excitandos disposita. For truly, heat may
take up such a vapor of a moist substance, but it cannot divide nor discuss
it. Yea although the native heat he sufficiently powerful; yet because the
humor lies deep, or is kept by the thickness of some membrane, tendon, or
ligament, the stirred up vapor cannot exhale. And so you see that materia
humida, caloris imbecillitas, and meatuum densitas, ad inflationis generationem
concurrant.

The Signs of inflammation are these; Signa.
a certain renitency or resistance, perceived by pressing the tumor with your
finger, and sometimes a noise as if you smote upon a Bottle or Tabour,
especially if much wind be contained therein. The tumor is very clear and
bright, being neither red nor hot, but rather cold and white, as in an Oedema.
It often possesses the joints, and especially the knees, and is very difficult
to be resolved.

Moreover, there is felt oftentimes windiness throughout the whole body, modo
huc, modo illuc discurrens, ac dolorem extensivum pariens.

Flatulentus seu vaporosus spiritus, Prognostica.
qui non discutitur, multa parit incommoda. But a breathing and windy vapor,
coursing up and down within the body, with pain and great anguish, is greatly
to be feared, because it does seem to be drawn from some venomous matter.

Si flatulentus tumor sit magnus, magnam calor is delilitatem arguit, and
materiae multitudinem; ideoque periculosior and contumacior est.

Si flatulenta materia in musculis detineatur, curatu est difficilis, ut Aetius
scribit. Curatio.


The Cure of inflations is dispatched by three intentions. The first consists
of a just and due observation of diet. The second, of a good concoction; and
the third depends on the discussing and dispersing of the windy spirit, which
is assembled in the member.

As touching the first, you must abstain from all gross, viscous, raw,
phlegmatic and windy meats: cujusmodi sunt Dulcia, Legumina, Lac, Caseus,
Fructus crudi, Rapae, Castaneae, and alia id genus, quae spiritum flatuosum
procreant.

Let his bread be of Barley, wherein also beside salt there is some cummin
mingled. Let the flesh which he eats be rather roasted than sodden (ut supra
dictum est de Oedemate) and especially the flesh of birds. Let his drink be
white odoriferous wine: and let him use the decoction of Cicers cum cepis,
petroselino, calamintha, ruta, and cumino.

As touching the second intention; after preparing and purging the humors, you
must strengthen and corroborate the virtue concoctive, cum speciebus
aromaticis, electuariis, and confectionibus: ut sunt Diacuminum, diacalaminte,
aromaticum rosatum, and similia. Vel fiat Tragea ex his.

I read of one that was cured therewith.

Accidit aliquando, quod ventositas corrumpitur a materia venenosa, and
transmittitar de membro ad membrum cum dolor intolerabili. In this case it
will be good to use that incomparable ointment, set down in the Chapter de
Phygethlo; for very many intolerable pains have been removed therewith.

Efficax quoque est emplastrum de Vigo cum Mercurio, ut Paraeus docet. Or if
you please, see my Enchiridion Medicum, lib. 2. page 266. and there you have a
powerful Liniment, with some of which you may mix a little unguentum dialthaea,
to mitigate its strength.

But if these prove not sufficient; then bind the part both above and beneath,
and in the midst between open the tumor with your incision knife, or a hot
iron, so as that the venomous matter may have easy passage out; this done,
dress up the wound with a mixture made ex aloe, bolo armeno, ol. rosaceo, and
aceto. After three or four days, endeavor to fill it up with flesh, and so to
cicatrize it, as art requires.

Caput 3.
De TUmore aquoso.
Tumor aquosus springs from a phlegmatic waterish or wheyish humor. Tumor
aquosus.


The cause is the evil disposition of the liver, Causa.
always distributing unconcocted juice. So that the virtue or faculty of the
members is altered through a cold and corrupted intemperature of the body, and
the naughtiness of nourishment declining to aquosity, ut Galenus annotavit lib.
6. de symptomatum causis.

Tumores aquosi sunt molles, laxi, Signa.
and sine dolor: ut observatum est in oedemate.

Si vero premuntur, prementis digiti vestigium non remanet, sic ab oedemate
distinguuntur, and si ad lucem vel candelam eos spectare detur, pellucidi fere
apparent.

Distinguitur etiam tumor aquosus a flatulento, laxitate, nisi flatus multos
admixtos habeat, gravitate, fluctuatione, quae percipitur quando pars
contrectatur: for at the pressing with your fingers, there is heard a noise or
murmur as of a bladder half filled with water.

Ipsi tumores aquosi periculosi non sunt, Prognostica.
qui a nullo viscerum vitio foventur.

Waterish tumors do happen oftener in the feet, in the stones and cods, in the
head, and in the joints, than in any other parts of the body. And as a flatuous
vapor is seldom found without a waterish humor, so a waterish or serous humor
is scarce contained at any time in any member without a windy spirit.

Et si tumores aquosi periculosi non sunt; tamen dissiculter curantur, cum
humor coctionem non recipiat, and tardius discutiatur.

Si vero materia discuti non possit, tumor aperiatur, after the same manner as
we mentioned in a Phlegmon. For oftentimes this kind of remedy must be
necessarily used, not only by reason of the contumacy of the humor which gives
no place to the resolving medicines, but also because it is shut up in its
proper cist or bag, the thickness of which frustrates the force of the
resolving medicines, neither suffers it to penetrate into the humor. As Paraeus
found by experience in a maid of seven years old, Observatio.
troubled with a Hydrocele or waterish rupture, to whom when he had rafhly (as
himself confesses) applied resolving medicines of all sorts, to dissolve it,
at length he was forced to open it with his knife; not only to evacuate the
contained matter, but also that he might pluck out the bag, which unless it
were cut up by the root, would be a means, as he says, to cause a relapse.

Many waterish tumors have been cured with Rose-vinegar and a little salt
added thereto, a sponge being diped therein and applied, the which as Galen
writes, must lie somewhat long upon the part.

Caput 4.
De Jonthis seu varis aut Cossis, and Psydraciis.
(...) vari seu Cossi, Jonthi.
are little hard Tumors on the skin of the face, curdled up of an hard thick
jnyce.

They arise from an alimentary humor, Causa.
for the most part, which insinuates it self into the pores of the skin; vel,
ut Valescus scribit, Caussae materiales sunt phlegma salsum, aut humores
adusti, aut cholera adusta, aut mclancholia adusta, quibus sanguis commiscetur.

Cognoscuntur facile, Signa.
ut Celsus ait: for they are of the bigness of Hempseeds, and they infest young
people that are inclined to venery, and fruitful; but chaste withal and
continent.

Qui vari ex solo crassiore alimento oriuntur, Prognostica.
stabiles sunt. But if choleric blood be mingled with the Alimentary juice, as
sometimes it happens; then they shed forth an ichor, and turn to Ulcers.

If there be a deep redness in the face, with pustules, malum curatu difficile
est, and pene impossible; and although the pustules be removed by strong
medicaments, yet the redness continues, and magis intenditur.

Quando rubedo conjuncta est cum inflatione faciei and raucedine vocis, lepra

Si autem fuerint a cholera adusta, non indigent phlebotomia, sed mundificetur

Si fuerint a melancholia adusta, digeratur materia cum syrupo de fumoterra.
Concocta materia evacuetur cum infusione epithymi and senae in sero caprino vel

Psydracia are hard whitish pustules, Psydracia.
which yield out matter by pressing, or they are little swellings in the head
like pushes, arising from a salt and nitrous phlegm, mingled sometimes with
blood, and sometimes with a choleric humor.

They are cured by these following Compositions; as Trallianus and Paulus
Aegineta do teach us.

Recipe rutae, aluminis, mellis, ana q. s. misce, fiat unguentum. Wherewith

is a continued blot, changing the color and substance, both of skin and
flesh. Vel, ut Celsus scribit, Est faedus cutis color, ex malo particulae

It springs from phlegmatic blood, Causa.
with which the flesh being nourished, first becomes of a middle nature,
between that of Animals that have blood, and that of bloodless Livewights; and
afterward when it cannot change it into the form of red flesh, it becomes like
the flesh of Oysters and Locusts.

It Is known, Signa.
both from what is set down in the description: and because it makes the hairs
fall off, and others grow in their place like down. The skin is flatter than in
other places, Si acu feriatur, humor aqueus and albus effluit.

Leuce, quae dum fricatur non rubescit, Prognostica.
and si pungatur, sanguinem non emittit, incurabilis est.

The Cure is desperate, if the blot continually increase.

If it be small, and after rubbing it show some redness, there is some hopes of
Cure.

Leuce quae in manu aut pede est, est difficilis curationis.

(...) difficilior curatu est, quam (...): and antiquior etiam alphus facilius

The Cure is performed, first, Curatio.

De Strumis, seu Scrofulis.
(...), Chaerades.
Strumae, seu Scrofulae, ut Barbari loquuntur, are nothing else but hard
kernels, contained within the little films, videlicet Glandulae, chiefly
appearing in the neck, the arme-holes, and in the parts above the privy members.

The Latins call them Strumae, but the Greeks Chaerades, either truly because
of the stones called Chaerades growing in the Sea, or else because of those
beasts called Sows, that bring forth a great company of Pigs at once (for these
evils do rise up many together) which beasts are often infected with that
disease. For Scrofae, that is to say Sues, have thick and glandulous necks, and
commonly they be strumous and full of kernels.

Quo ad Causam and Signa, vide meum Enchiridion medicum, lib. 3. cap. 36. page
289.

Qui hanc patiuntur aegritudinem, Prognostica.
omnium authorum consensu, sunt gulosi, aut nutrimento utuntur phlegmatico.

These kind of Tumors do not lightly come to maturation: but if they do, and
after be so healed, yet for the most part, they spring again, near the
cicatrize of the old.

Children, by reason of their excessive eating and immoderate diet, are very
often annoyed with strumae, but old men, ob causas contrarias, are seldom
troubled therewith.

In infantibus sanantur, in juvenibus vero difficulter, in senibus autem
dissicilius.

They which have a narrow and short forehead, straight temples, flat, as it
were compressed, and large jaws, are subject to strumae: in talibus enim
materia prompte derivatur ad collum, ut ex recentioribus chirurgis annotavit
Henricus.

Little stumae, of a gentle condition, and superficious in the skin, are easily
cured.

Redness, pain, and increasing of heat, do declare that those abscessions will
either come to suppuration, or else degenerate into a Fistula or a Cancer.

Those Tumors which are new and tractable, may easily be discussed; but they
which be hard and inveterate, can in no wise be resolved.

These evils called strumae, do greatly differ among themselves; for some are
without inflammation, or pain, ac mediocri duritie.

Aliae vero sunt cum dolor, inflammatione, and pulsatione. Istae malignae
vocantur.

Aliae sunt magnae, antiquatae, ac venis, nervis, and arteriis infiltratae,
malumque habent colorem.

Ab harum curatione omnino fugiendum est, quoniam, ut habet Avicenna, in
cancrum saepe degenerant.

Such as be moveable (which is a sign they are covered with a veil or Cystis
called Tunica) and hang downward, are a great deal sooner healed, then they
which are planted or surely fixed in the flesh: which if they be, it is an
evident token that they are guarded about with no film or tunicle at all.

Moreover, as touching manual operation, which is to be used, when they will
neither give place to emollients, nor yet be ordered by maturatives, see
Weckerus de strumis, in lib. 3. de morborum externorum curatione, page 677.

Strumae are commonly cured by the hand of the Prince, and otherwise therefore,
seldomer striven withal amongst us.

Some waste these tumors with the herb Scrophularia, Observatio.
commonly called blind Nettle, and water Betony. Others consume them cum
radice urticae mortuae. But the root of the shrub Ruscus or Butchers broom, is
exceedingly commended. The Patient is to take. i. of the powder thereof in
wine, every day for a while.

Formius, a most experienced Surgeon of Montpelier, does declare, that a
girl ten years old, had hard King's Evil swellings on three of her fingers,
which were cured by the smoke of vinegar poured upon red hot flints continued
morning and evening for a month together. Indeed this remedy is highly
extolled by Galen ad tumores scirrhosos discutiendos.

Zacutus exceedingly commends this following unguent, which he takes God to
witness never failed him.

Take the great root of Briony well washed, and cut it in small pieces, boil it

spread upon cloth, and applied it twice a day; if there be no Ulcer, it either

with most happy success. Insomuch that very many have been perfectly cured
therewith.

Moreover, Sennertus does commend a Cataplasme paratum ex radicibus

asswaging pain are to be used: as the white of an Egg, with Rose oil.

If there hap to remain any part of the bladder, you must waste it away by

When Ganglium, by these means, is softened, upon the fresh removing of the
Plaster, whilst the place is yet warm, rub, or press it so long, with your
thumb, until the bladder or bag be broken, and then presently apply or bind
hard thereunto plumbi lamina, hydrargyro illita; which must not be removed for
nine or ten days; that so the remainder of the tumor may be wasted and
consumed.

I read of one that having a Ganglion in carpo manus was cured after this
manner. The Tumor was daily bathed and rubbed, for a month together, cum oleo

Moreover, Formius in one of his observations tells us, that a certain young

the bone called Zigoma, it was discussed within a month, by applying thereunto
a plate of lead smeared with Quicksilver, and stuck upon a Plaster that it
might be kept on. The plate with the Plaster were said upon the Tumor, and a
bolster thereupon, and then he tied them too with such a swathe-band as Galen
calls Semiphalera.

Mr. Denis Pomaret, a skilful Surgeon of Montpelier, does declare, that a
Capouchine-Friar, twenty five years old, had a Wenn upon his knee, which was
grown so soft, that the matter within contained, seemed well digested. The
Surgeon would have it opened, but the Friar refused, saying, he had seen
just such Ganglions discussed with the leaves of Sorrel, wrapped in a wet paper
and roasted in the Embers, which was afterward incorporated with sifted ashes
into the form of a pultis. This medicine he applied diverse days warm, and the
Tumor wholly vanished away.

Caput 9.
De Glandula.
GLandula is a Tumor like to a little kernel, Glandula.
soft, moveable, and separate from the parts round about it; growing commonly
in the emunctories. Vel, ut Fernelius scribit, est adenis tumor obduratus, a
nodo ganglione solo situ distans. Haec enim e solis adenibus, ille e nervis aut
articulis emergit.

The Glandula takes its denomination, as some men say, from an Acorn, called
Glans, the which it somewhat resembles in the compass and form of the Tumor; or
else because it most commonly breeds in the glandules, or emunctories of man's
body.

Hic tumor a malo vitae regimine, Causa.
and a materia phlegmatica, crassa, and glutinosa, exoritur.

The Signs are set down in the definitions. Singa.
Moreover, it is commonly contained in its proper Cist or Bag.

Curatur tam in universali, Curatio.
quam in particulari, ut nodi, idcirco ad nodi, curationem recurre. Vide etiam

Ad glandulam parotis frigida, buboque frigidus, pertinent.

Caput 10.
De Atheromate.
(...), Atheroma.
is a Tumor void of pain, or change of color, containing within the film or
sinewy tunicle, a clammy humor, like to a kind of pulse which is made of
boiled meal. Atheroma igitur sic dictum est, quod materiam pulti similem
contineat, and a meliceride iu figura, and in humoris substantia differt.

The inward cause is a phlegmatic humor, Causa.
which the signs of phlegm abounding in the body, will declare. Outward causes
be falls, strokes, surfeiting, drunkenness, etc. ex aegri sermon dignoscuntur.

This Tumor appears in form and figure very long, Signa.
and somewhat elevated in height, which being pressed with the fingers, ob
humoris lentorem and crassitudinem tarde retrocedit, and amotis digitis, tarde
quoque regreditur. Interdum etiam in atheromatibus simul cum humore pultaceo
lapidosa quaedam, duraque corpora, and alia tanquam sulphuris ramenta
inveniuntur. Yea when they are opened, you may see bodies of all sorts, far
different from the common matter of other Tumors, as sand, coals, chalk, hairs,
straws, hey, horn, snails flesh, both hard and spongeous, gristles, bones, and
sometimes whole creatures, as well living as dead. But for the most part, as I
hinted before, the matter of these Tumors is like to hasty-pudding or pap, with
which they feed little children.

These humors have no danger annexed with them; Prognostica.
notwithstanding for the most part they continue long. Saepe sponte tamen in
abscessum desinunt. But in case they do not, non tam difficulter, ut scrofulae
and scirrhi, curantur.

Such as are found, as it were, hanging in the surface of the skin, and easy
to be moved this way, and that way, facile curabiles sunt.

Qui vero profundius inserti sunt, and ad motum non expositi, difficilius cur
antur, and in Chirurgiae aggressione summam diligentiam expetunt, for fear of a
great flux of blood and convulsion by cutting a vein.

Quantum ad curam universalem, recurre ad curam nodi.

Circa vero localia, Curatio.
atheroma discutientibus and suppurantibus aut erodentibus curatur, ac fere
sectione opus non habet.

Caput 11.
De Steatomate.
(...), Steatoma.
is a Tumor in color nothing differing from other parts, without pain, very
gentle to be handled; small in the beginning, but much enlarging and increasing
in process of time, wherein is contained a humor very like unto Suet or Tallow,
enclosed in its proper membrane.

Paraeus says, that oftentimes it is found to be stuffed with other diverse
hard bodies, stony, bony or callous, like unto the claws of an hen. And
Philoxenus reports that he sometimes saw flies in a Steatoma at the opening
thereof, and such other like things, wholly dissenting from the common matter
of Tumors.

Oritur ab humore phlegmatico, etc. Causa.
ut supra, in capite de Atheromate, notavimus.

Cognoscitur ex iis, Signa.
quae in definitione exposita sunt. Hic tumor etiam a meliceride and atheromate
distinguitur duritie. Nam Steatoma plenum ac solidum est; and it does so resist
touching, that it will in no wise yield to the thrusting of the fingers: yea it
is harder then the other two; and if it should chance to yield to the pressure
of the finger, yet it does not speedily and easily return to its former figure,
because the matter is more gross.

Quo ad prognostica, vide supra, in capite praecedente.

Steatoma nec discuti, Curatio.
nec exedi potest, sed sola sectione curatur, ut in nodis, glandulis, and aliis
hujusmodi dictum fuit. Igitur si opus erit, ad ipsa capita recurre.

Sometimes this tumor has a very broad top, and a very narrow and slender
foundation; in such a case it will be good to cut it up quite even by the root,
for so the labor of the Surgeon shall be quickly ended, the Ulcer made
plain and equal with the other parts, and the cure shortly dispatched.

Caput 12.
De Meliceride.
(...) is a Tumor, Meliceris.
void of pain, but round, wherein the humor which is included in some sinewy
coat, is found somewhat thin, representing the substance of honey. Itaque
meliceris ab atheromate differt figura and humoris substantia. Nam et figura
rotundior, et humoris substantia tenuior.

It arises from a phlegmatic humor. Causa.


Signa in definitione exposita sunt. Signa.


Moreover, this tumor takes up a large space, and yields to the touch, as being
a loose and soft body; and as it is easily disposed and diffused by the
pressure of the finger, so it quickly returns to its former place.

Quo ad Prognostica, vide supra, in capite de Atheromate.

Meliceris tum medicamentis discutientibus, Curatio.
tum erodentibus, tum Chirurgia, id est, sectione, curatur. Vide supra, in

Paulus did usually discuss Melicerides with that medicine which contains of
pressed Grapes (exemptis acinis) viginti, Observatio.
of the scourings of Brass. ss. which medicine must not be applied before the
member be nourished with foments. Another Emplaster appointed for Meliceredes,
which Aetius reported unto Leonides, is this.

Caput 13.
De Testudine seu talpa.
TEstudo seu talpa, Testudo.
is a soft Tumor, or not greatly hard, yet somewhat big, in the which is
contained a gross matter lying hid in a certain Tunicle, which does so cleave
unto the whole head of a man, that oftentimes it corrupts the same. Vel si
aliter-definire velis; Testudo (ut Guido scribit) abscessus est magnus,
humoralis, mollis, latiore forma, in modum testudinis: unde nomen accipit, quae
si in capite (inquit) nascatur, talpharia vel talpa dicitur: in collo bocium:
in testiculis hernia.

Testudo (no doubt) is to be accounted among the number of abscessions, and
comprehended under Meliceris: but Talpa, because it contains a white matter,
is rather referred unto Atheroma then unto Meliceris: notwithstanding Guido
affirms, that it is a kind of Testudo, yea also that it is Testudo it self.

De Nata seu Napta, et Fungis.
NAta, seu Napta, Nata.
is a great and fleshy tumor, not, in shape, unlike a melon or gourd, or rather
the flesh of a man's Buttocks.

Materia quidem in eo interdum videtur carnosa (ut diximus) sed non vere caro
est, verum adipi similis, ideoque ad steatomat a referri potest.

This Tumor more usually breeds upon the buttocks, than upon any other part of
the body: And it borrows sundry names according to the variety of the fashion
and member wherein it is placed.

Causae sunt eadem, Causa.

Moreover, this Tumor is soft, and without any pain, except peradventure it be
so great, that by continual drawing of the parts of that member, it brings
some grief to the Patient.

sanguinis fluxionem, quae ut plurimum in hujusmodi casibus accidere solet.

There is, moreover, another certain kind of Tumor much like unto Napta,
Fungus.
called Fungus, being a pale, soft, and spungy flesh, which springs forth from
a hurt, wounded, or contused Membrane, with a small root, and broad top, like a
Fungus or Mushrome, increasing and decreasing, according to the plenty of the
flowing matter, and industry of the Surgeon, by art, hindering its growth.

These kind of Fungi are generated from a superfluous humor, or, as Paraeus
says, from a melancholy blood, both in temper and consistence, which sweating
forth through the hurt membranes, is changed into this substance by the
formative faculty of the part.

Fungus is not covered with a skin as the Tumor Natta is, but hangs forth all
naked and bare.

Malum hoc periculosum est, and curatu difficile, ac nisi recte tractetur,
facile in cancri naturam abit.

Many things are propounded by Authors to dry, waste, and consume this
superfluous flesh, as Sugar of Saturn, burnt Lead, Tutty prepared, the Ashes of
Frogs and Sea-crabs.

fall away by reason of this binding, the place must be strewed with the
forementioned powders.

Sectio Quarta.
De Tumoribus ab Humore Melancholico.
Caput primum.
De Scirrho.
(...), Scirrhus.
seu Sephiros ut Barbari loquuntur, is an hard Tumor without pain, springing
from a Melancholic humor, which is thick, clammy, and roping. Vel si aliter
definire velis; Scirrhus est Tumor durus and indolens, non tamen omnino sine
sensu, ab humore melancholico naturali and minime corrupto procreatus, ut
recentiores loquuntur Chirurgi.

Quo ad Causam and Signa, vide meum Enchiridion Medicum, lib. 3. page 291.

Scirrhus, Prognostica.
ut Galenus scribit, qui plane omni sensu destituitur, non curatur.

Scirrhus vero, qui omni sensu non destituitur, etsi incurabilis non sit
omnino, praecipue si ab initio commoda remedia adhibeantur; tamen ita facile
non curatur, propter materiae contumaciam, and praesertim, si in part aliqua
nobiliore, ut hepate, vel etiam liene, haereat.

Scirrhous tumors, in their beginning are wont to appear very small, but in
process of time by little and little, they become great and mighty; whereof
some do annoy one only member; but other some of the said tumors do leave that
member which they did first infect, and afterward do pass over into the
possession of another.

Hi tumores si rite tractentur, resolutione terminnatur, nonnunquam indurati
remanent, and non raro in cancrum (quod pessimum est) degenerant ac
transmutantur.

For the Cure; Curatio.
first, you must appoint a sober and moderate diet, and such a one as declineth
unto heat and moisture, in those things which they call Res non naturales. Give
him therefore meats of good juice, and which can engender good blood. Let his
bread be of good Wheat, meanly salted and leavened. Let his drink be small Ale
or Beer, or Wine both thin and sweet smelling. For his meat, give him rear
eggs, the flesh of Chickens, Capons, Hens, and the broths of them. Let him also
eat the flesh of Partriges, Pheasants, sucking Calves, and of Wethers of a year
old. For Pot Herbs, let him use Sphinachia, Borrago, Lactuca, Buglossa, atque
id genus alia, quae sanguinem expurgant, and puriorem reddunt. To conclude, let
him fly and avoid all those things which naturally do engender melancholic
blood, ut sunt carnes caprinae, cervinae, bovis, leporum, aprorum, limaces,
brassica, legumina, panis furfuraceus, vina crassa and nigra, caseus, salita,
frixa, acria, vigilia, and exercitiui laboriosum. Quietness and tranquillity of
mind, with mirth and gladness, is greatly to be desired. Aer debet esse
calidus and humidus.

Secondly, si res postulabit, mittatur sanguis a vena communi, aut basilicae
ejusdem lateris, secundum prudent is medici consilium. And to prepare the
humor, you may frame this Julep:. Syrupi epithymi, fumar. capill. vener. ana.

Melancholia.

Quo ad localia, authoritate Avicennae, and Pauli, medicament a non debent esse
omnino resolutiva; neque debent effe secundum totum mellitiva; sed laudantur ea
quae mixtam habent facultatem, scilicet resolvendi, and mollificandi, ut
Galenus docet; for by the use of only resolving things, there is fear of
concretion, the subtiler part being resolved, and the grosser subsiding; and
only of emollients, there is danger of putrefaction, a Cancer, and a Fistula.
Ad hanc intentionem optimum est ceratum Joan. de Vigo, cujus descriptio haec

Moreover, the aggrieved member may be every day anointed with some thin oil,
as oleum Sabinum, quod omnium est tenuissimum, vel oleum Sambucinum, wherein
either the root of the wild Cucumber, or of Altheae, or green and fresh Dill,
or some such like thing, has been boiled and infused. Now when you have
sufficiently used emollients, fume the tumor with strong Vinegar and Aqua vitae
poured upon a piece of millstone or flint heated very hot; for so the mollified
humor will be rarefied, attenuated, and resolved; then some while after renew
your emollients, and then again apply your resolvers to waste that which
remains, which could not be performed together and at once; Observatio.
for thus Galen healed a Scirrhus in Cercilius his Son.

If it come to suppuration, cleanse away the quittor with the Plaster of
Diachylon simplex, omitting heaters, and section or lancing, ne in cancrum

hand, a leaden plate smeared with Quicksilver was applied thereunto, which in
the space of eight days wholly discussed the Tumor.

Caput 2.
De Cancro.
(...) seu Cancer, Cancer.
is a round Tumor, blew or blackish, having veins round about it, full and
swelling, resembling the feet of a Crab; and springing from black choler. Vel,
ut Weckerus scribit, Cancer est tumor durus, inaequalis, rotundus, venenosus,
color nigricans, calidus, subito accrescens, aegros maxim fatigans, and
perpetuo fere dolor affligens, Graece (...) dicitur.

Cancer nomen trahit a cancro aquatico. Nam quemadmodum in isto animali est
rotunditas, and habet pedes in utraque part corporis: ita morbus iste est
rotundus, and habet venas in circuetu tumentes, sanguine melancholico plenas,
quas Galenus cancri radices appellat.

Quo ad Causam and Signa, vide meum Enchiridion Medicum, lib. 3. page 292. and
293.

Cancer, Prognostica.
or Carcinoma, generally is a grievous and pernicious disease, which can
scarcely be healed, by reason of the grossness and malignity of the humor; non
raro etiam profundas venas occupavit, ut nec purgatione corporis, nec
repellentibus, nec discutientibus, nec sectione, nec ustione tolli possit; sed
remedia mitiora contemnat, fortioribus exasperetur.

The thicker and blacker that the humor is, so much the worse is the effect.

Oritur Cancer in omnibus corporis partibus, sed maxim (ut Celsus ait) in
partibus superioribus, circa faciem, narem, aures, and labia: enascitur quoque
in mammillis, ac in mulierum pudendis, in quibus menstrua defecerint, and quae
rarae ac laxae sunt, ac etiam quae cibis crassis, ac melancholicis nutriuntur.

Cancers, for the most part, light upon those men, which have been accustomed
to hemorrhoidal purging, and have now lost the benefit of the same.

Moreover, when this melancholious humor, resembling in proportion the dregs of
wine, does descend and flow into any member, and there abides compact
together, it causes sometimes the disease called Varices, and sometimes it
breeds a Cancer, as when the same is somewhat cooled. But when it is thrust
out to the whole skin, it causes that evil which they call Elephantiasis.

Those Cancers are only curable which are small, fresh, and do stick in the
outward part of the body: but those that have gotten deeper lodgings, admit no
cure.

Si Cancer sit inveteratus, atque jam confirmatus, curationem non admitt-it,
nisi radicitus extirpetur, aut per sectionem, aut per ustionem.

If the Cancer be seated in cavitate corporis, in the palate, fundament, or
womb, the Cure is not to be undertaken.

Cancer confirmatus and inparte nobiliore sedens, incurabilis est. Yea no man
is thought able, by some, to cure a confirmed and ulcerated Cancer. Et
observatum est saepius, quamvis excisi and aliquando curati fuerint cancri in
exterioribus, eosdem tamen postea rediisse in eadem, vel etiam in aliis
partibus, ut cancro in mammis curato, alium in utero subortum suisse. And
Celsus says, that although Carcinomata be cut off, and brought to a scar, yet
they will return again, and give occasion of death. It will be sufficient
therefore, in great and inveterate Cancers, only to keep them from spreading
further, by gentle medicines, and a palliative cure.

Quo ad curam universalem. Curatio.
Apparente cancro, observabis sex res non naturales, ut in scirrhi curatione
adnotavimus; statim evacuabis corpus, and a sanguinis missione inchoandum est,
ex vena hepatis ejusdem lateris, dummodo vires, ac virtus permiserint: injecto
tamen prius clysterio lenitivo. Si fuerint mulieres, ducantur menstrua, si
nondum quinquagessimum annum attigerint, test Galeno lib. 2. ad Glauconem. At
si in viris fuerit morbus, and hemorrhoides fuerint suppressae, recludantur.

this quantity of Epithymum, or somewhat more, must be offered every third day,
that the melancholic humor which is gathered together in the veins, may by
little and little be emptied and purged out, because it is impossible to
evacuate all at one time. Afterward (if the matter so requires, and the
ministering of simples does little avail) you may use the help of some compound
remedies.

Moreover, how great the force of lead is in all such Cancrous dispositions,
especially that which is burnt and washed, all men may sufficiently know, which
have had some experience thereof, and which have studiously perused those
things which Galen, libro nono de simplicium medicamentorum facultate, does
write of lead, which he himself calls in Greek molybdos.

Si cancer fuerit parvus, and in summa corporis part haereat, radicitus
extirpandus est, ut Avicenna scribit: sanguinisque multum emittendus, ac
crassior sanguis circumquaque ex vicinis partibus exprimendus, ex Tagaultii
sententia. Deinde ferro ignito cauterizetur locus. Hoc enim reliquias materiae
dissipat, membrum corroborat, and sanguinis fluxionem prohibet. Postea remove
escharam, ut in carbunculo dictum fuit. Deinde curabis ut alia ulcera. Now we
know and understand that all the Cancer is taken away, and all the malignity
thereof extinct, when the Ulcer casts forth laudable matter, when that good
flesh begins to grow by little and little, like to the grains of a Pomegranat,
the pricking pain, and all the symptoms being assuaged. But truly, although
Galen and Avicen did allow that Cancers might sometimes be cured by Surgery;
yet to avoid the danger of immoderate flux of blood, and of ulceration, yea and
the life of the sick, omitting those things, we ought rather to follow the
prescript rule of curing, which is only accomplished by gentle medicines.

If there happen any furious motion, or pain in the place, which breeds
extraordinary disquietness, mitigate the pain with this unguent.

medicine is very commendable.. Lythargyrii, cerussae ana. i. terantur in

Galen beats into powder river Crabs burnt; the which being mixed with ointment
of Roses is most profitably applied upon lint to Cancerous Ulcers.

Arsenici operatio in hoc casu est excellens, ut Valescus de Taranta, cap. de
cancro, scriptum reliquit; Dicens vidisse se quendam experimentatorem, cum hoc
medicamento, sanare cancros, fistulas, and ulcera maligna in cruribus. For my
own part, I never saw any cured therewith, neither do I think it safe for the
young artist to use it, seeing it is a hot, acrid, and vehement medicine, able
to increase the pain, fever and all the symptoms, to the dejecting of the
powers, the wasting and consuming of the body, and the hastening of death.
Indeed I read of some that were cured therewith, and have held well a whole
year, sed postea in eodem loco tres supervenerunt cancri, and cum his perierunt.

If the Cancer affect the womb, make injections of the juice of Plantain,
Knot-grass, Lettice, and Purslain mixed together, and agitated or labored in a
leaden mortar with a little Oil of Roses; for this kind of medicine is
commended by Galen, in every kind of ulcerated Cancers. Now to strengthen the

A certain old woman had a Cancer in her left Dug, Observatio.
which she had born thirteen years together; wherein little Cancerous Tumors
grew out, which pained her more than the great one, upon which they grew,
because they were ulcerated. These little Tumors were taken away by frequent
application of waters of red Poppy, Plantain, and Roses, mixed with Honey of
Roses, at first, but afterward the waters were used alone. And in another
woman that had a Cancerous Ulcer in her breast, the same medicines cured the
Ulcer quite, and closed it up.

A near Kinswoman of mine being troubled with a small cancerous Tumor in her
breast, which put her to much pain, she was cured in a very short time, chiefly
by the use of that excellent unguent, set down in the Chapter de Phygethlo.
Also I remember I gave her this Apozem which wrought very well.

other in the morning about seven.

A certain Gentleman of a Noble Family, being troubled with a Cancerous Tumor,
which covered almost all his upper lip; after many things used in vain, he was
cured chiefly by the use of this Ointment. Take green Frogs that live among
trees, or in pure waters, and put them in an earthen pot full of small holes in
the bottom, and fill their mouths with butter, cover the pot close and daub the
juncture with clay, and set it over another empty pot which must be set in the
ground up to the brim; then make a fire round about it fit for distillation,
and gather the oil that drops into the pot in the ground, and mix it with the
powder of Frogs into a Liniment.

Now although this indeed was the principal remedy, yet you must note, that he
was twice purged with the extract of black Hellebor, four grains at a time, in
three drams of Diaprunum Solutivum: Also Horse-Leeches were applied to his
Hemorrhoid veins, and he drunk whey boiled with Epithymum for a month together.

This water following is highly commended by Paraeus; for an ulcerated Cancer
in the womb.

them be all beaten together and distilled in a leaden Alembick, keep the liquor
for use, and with it make often injection into the part; or if the site of the
part will permit, let the cancerous Ulcers be washed therewith, and pledgets of
lint steeped therein, be applied and renewed ever and anon; for so the acrimony
and force of the inflammation is retunded, and the pain assuaged.

Caput 3.
De Scabie and Volatica.
(...), Psora.
seu Scabies, is a Tumor arising from corrupted blood, vexing the Patient with
distemper and exulceration of the skin. Vel si aliter definire velis; Scabies
est infectio cutis, aliquando squamosa, pruriginosa, aliquando sicca, aliquando
humida, aliquando saniosa, ut plurimum in extremitatibus, aliquando magnam
corporis partem occupans.

Causa est sanguis corruptus, Causa.
cum atra bile and pituita salsa mistus; which either comes from suitable Diet,
especially when the Liver is distempered with heat; or it is corrupted by
contagion: and being brought unto the skin, it sticks therein, and causes
exulceration.

The Signs are set down in the definitions. Signa.
Si Scabies sit a sanguine, cognoscitur per ruborem membri and plenitudinem
totius, per mollitiem, per pruritum delectabilem, and per copiosam saniem and
citam generationem, and cito exit sanguis ex unguium scalpellatione, and sapor
in ore sentitur dulcis. Si autem fit a Phlegmate salso, pruritus erit
virulentus, intolerabilis, and sine rubedine: delectatio etiam in scalpendo,
sed in fine est vehemens dolor.

Si scabies ex adustione cholerae fuerit, pruritus erit acutus, and locus
scabiosus citrinus, cum siccitate, punctione, and scissuris. Si vero scabies
provenerit a melancholia, parvus erit pruritus, and membrum scabiosum lividum.

Interdum scabies motu critico accidit, cum morbificus ad cutem expulsus est

Scabies in decrepitis est difficilis curationis, aut impossibilis, ut addit
Gordonius; quia naturaliter sunt sicci, and nutrimentum eorum est indigestum,
and non been nutribile, and phlegmaticae and serosae superfluitates in senum

Scabies foeda, seu ulcer atio foetida, multas parts corporis occupans and

est difficilis curationis, ut dicit Gordonius.

At si fuerit parva, modicam partem corporis occupans, non angustiosa, neque
somnum auferens, facile curabitur.

Propterea sciendum quod scabies humida fit a phlegmate falso, per admixtionem

in three weeks; but remember first to purge and blood him. If he be troubled
with the French Disease, then let him sweat one hour after every anointing with
the decoction of Carduus benedictus, Sarsaparilla, and liquoris. Let him also
drink fumitory water, sweetened with the syrup of fumitory; and in time of year
clarified Whey boiled with Fumitory.

A certain young man was exceedingly tormented with a filthy Scab, with Felons
frequently breaking forth; of which Diseases he could not be freed by
blood-letting, and many purges used at times, in the space of six months;

I have known many Children cured of this Disease, by the use of an Ointment
framed of Cream, juice of Housleek, and Brimstone.

It differs only gradually from other Leprosies. Signa.
And it is known hereby, because it eats deeper into the skin; and scales as it

Morphea, or the Morphew, are great blots or spots upon the skin, changing the
color thereof, which are spread up and down here and there, with a certain
roughness.

Haec passio varia sortitur nomina; ab Avicenna morphea, and albaras, a Celso,
and graecis (...), and (...): a latinis vitiligo. De nominibus autem nulla sit
contentio, dummodo res intellig amus.

It is to be understood, that all those things which are the cause of the
Leprosy, Causa.
are also the cause of the Morphew; so that Morphea convenientiam cum lepra
habet, because as in the Leprosy, so in the Morphew, the assimilative virtue
does err. But they differ, in that the Leprosy is in the flesh and the Morphew
in the skin.

Qui barbaram sequuntur medicinam, tres causas morpheae constituunt:
Primitivam; quae melancholicorum ciborum, seu pituitosorum, seu rerum sanguinem
adurentium est usus. Antecedentem; quae (ut habet Valescus) error digestivae in
stomacho and in intestinis virtutis est: at ego potius in hepate vel in venis
mesaraicis esse crediderim. Nam error in prima and secunda digestiva factus, in
tertia corrigi non potest. Conjunctam; quam Valescus immediatum virtutis

They are either black, Signa.
springing from melancholy blood through default of the spleen, or yellow,
arising from Choler, or white, but not exactly agreeing with the whiteness of
the skin, which spring from phlegmatic blood, chiefly through the default of
the Liver. The skin is by them made white, but not the hairs, and if it be
pricked, blood follows. Infestant etiam viros magis quam foeminas and pucros.

Vitiligo equidem periculum vitae nullum infert: Prognostica.

If the Morphew be new, it is curable; if old incurable, or removed with great
difficulty.

The white Morphew is cured more easily than the black one.

Caput 7.
De Elephantiasi.
(...), Elephantiasis.
is a Cancerous Tumor of the whole body, springing from black choler infected
with a venomous quality, and shed into the whole habit of the body, causing
many symptoms.

Hic morbus Leontiasis etiam nuncupatur, ab horrore, superciliis protuber
antibus, and frontis laxitate. Vocatur quoque Satiriasis, a rubore genarum,
menti contorsione, and libidine.

Some from the opinion of the Arabians have termed it Lepra, or Leprosy (but
unproperly, for the Lepra is a kind of Scab and Disease of the skin) which
word for the present we will use, as that which prevails by custom and
antiquity.

Quo ad Causam and Signa, vide meum Enchiridion Medicum, lib. 3. cap. 47.

Quatuor etiam leprae species ab authothoribus assignantur.

Prima generatur a sanguine in se adusto aut corrupto, and dicitur Alopecia, a
vulpecula depilata. In this there is an obscure redness and swelling of the
face, redness of the eyes, bleeding at the nose. The hair of the beard and
eyelids fall off, and at length the whole body does consume.

Secunda fit a bile, vel sanguine cholerico adusto, and dicitur Leonina, so
termed from the ruggedness of the Lions forehead. In this there are prickings,
bitings, and tetters in the face and eyelids: facies and totum corpus etiam
citrinum colorem acquirit. The Patient is altogether deprived of sleep, and so
hungry and thirsty that he cannot be satisfied.

Tertia oritur a phlegmate adusto, vel sanguine adusto phlegmatico, and dicitur
Tyria, from the scaly Serpent Tyrus, which casts off his skin in the Spring. In
this there is whiteness, scales, and dandruff.

Quarta vero a melancholia adusta and vocatur Elephantiasis, either a morbi
magnitudine, or because the skin of such as are troubled therewith, is rough,
scabious, wrinckled and unequal, like the skin of an Elephant. Hae species raro
sunt separatae, frequentissime complicantur.

Prognosticare pro certo possumus, Prognostica.
quod in sempiternum lepra, postquam venit ad manifestam corruptionem formae
and figurae, non posset curari. Quomodo enim (ut Avicenna scribit) curabitur
lepra? quae est cancer universalis, cum non potest curari cancer particularis.
Indeed Alopecia is less dangerous, more gentle and of easier curation,
especially at the beginning.

Leonina comes speedily, but Elephantiasis somewhat slowly to its augmentation.

Such as are troubled with this most fearful and horrid Disease, sunt omnino
vitandi, tum proper contagium, tum etiam propter aerem vitiatum, qui ex
inspiratione, and respiratione faetidus redditur ob narium ulcera.

For the Cure, first, Curatio.
prescribe a fit and convenient diet. Let his bread be kneaded with water of
Purslain, of Lettice, or of Endive, and not eaten before it be two days old.
All his flesh must be light and easy of digegestion, as namely Pullets,
Partridges, Phesants, Finches; but especially the flesh of sucking Calves, of
Lambs, of young Swine, and of Wethers of a year old. All River Fish which is
not slimy is very good, rather sodden then roasted. So are ripe Melons, because
they cool and moisten. For Pot Herbs let him use Spinach, Lettice, Beets,
Endive and Purslane: And let him wholly refrain from all salt and melancholy
meats, such as are set down in the Chapter de Scirro. Let his drink be wine
diluted with water, aut aqua cum cinnamomo. A vino puro and a venere, durante
morbo, omnino abstineat. Also he must abstain from strong Beer, Spices, hot
Waters, and all sharp things; for vinegar and whatsoever else is sour, does
harm very much the melancholic persons.

Secondly, in the spring, let blood be drawn, ex utroque brachio a vena
hepatis, aut a communi: Sed si Lepra fuerit confirmata, non multum convenit
phlebotomia: Haemorrhoides etiam, and menstrua, si opus fuerit, aperiantur.

Thirdly, after bleeding, concoct and prepare the matter for seven or nine
days with this Syrup.

Recipe succorum scabiosae, borag. fumiterrae, lapathi acuti, and buglossae,
ana lb. ss. florum violarum, boraginis, buglos. polypodii quercini, epithymi,
liquiritiae mundae, ana. i. misc. and bulliant parum, and coletur; cui
colaturae add sacchari albi q. s. and fiat sir. de quo dentur. ij. cum aquis
sumiterrae, buglossae, aut aliis hujusmodi. For this purpose also you may use
the decoction of tamarisk, or the water of Strawberries or Dodder.

Digesta materia evacuetur cum his quae supra dicta sunt in capite de Cancro
and Scirrho. Moreover, let the Patient be oftentimes purged, even twice or
thrice in a month, sires postulaverit: nulla enim sanatio sperari potest, nisi
humores vitiosi e corpore crebro evacuentur. And seeing Bezoar is so highly
commended by many, I think it will be convenient to give after every purging,
three or four grains in a spoonful of Oxe-tongue water.

Mirabile quoque elephantiae remedium est usus viperarum; the flesh of them
boiled, their head and tail being cut off. But the wine of them is exceedingly
commended by all.

Aliqui imponunt vino viperas excoriatas, and sine visceribus, ne vinum foeteat.

Moreover, some do highly commend Electuarium de viperis, quae sic
praeparantur. Abscindantur capita, and caudae viperarum, postea excorientur,
and extrahantur viscera sine pinguedine: deinde laventur, bis, aut ter; postea
coquantur in multa aqua, donec fiant molles, and in dicta aqua sint porri,
anethum, and parum olei. Decoctis viperis separabis carnem a spinis, cui add
carnem pectoris gallinae, cum zinziberis, sacchari, and nucis muscatae, quant.
suff. vel loco carnis gallinae pone micam panis, and fiat electuarium. The
Patient, as some men say, ought to follow this electuary, or the wine above
noted; donec corpus inflatur and cutis excoriatur, ac etiam supervenit vertigo;
quibus apparentibus abstineat a tali usu; and afterward if need require he may
use them again.

Fourthly, let the whole body be rubbed and washed in one of the baths set down
in the Chapter de Scabie, and afterward besmear all over with Hares blood hot.
Deinde capiat. i. theriacae cum vino. After that the blood be dried up, wash
again with the decoction of Lilly roots and bran. Postea ungatur totum corpus
cum unguentis dictis in scabie, and morphea, ut res postulabit, aut cum hoc
unguento,

Recipe unguenti citrini recentis, unguenti albi camphorati recentis, ana. vi.
unguenti populeonis, unguenti ros. ana. i. ping. viperae. ii. olei ros.
myrthini, ana. ss. misc. and utere.

Avicen commands that the whole body (the head and berad being first shaven)
should be washed with water, in quibus coctae fuerint viperae.

Caput 8.
De Elephantiasi Arabum.
(...) Arabum, Elephantiasis Arabum.
or the Leprosy of the Arabians, is a Tumor of the feet, Causa.
springing from melancholic, phlegmatic blood, and the Varices.

In this Disease the Thighs are swelled, Signa.
of a leaden color, black and full of Ulcers. Pedes aegri pedibus Elephantis
figura and crassitie similes etiam sunt: unde Elephantiacus morbus nuncupatur.

Varices and Elephantia, Prognostica.
in corpore consueto, ut diximus, praeservant a multis malis passionibus,
scilicet lepra, cancro, hydrope, splenetica affectione, melancholia and
similibus.

Item in Varicibus and Elephantia, si menstrua vel haemorrhoides superveniunt,
post eorum restrictionem diuturnam, solvit aegritudinem.

Elephantia proceeding from a hot cause with stinking pustules is more
dangerous then that which arises from a cold; quoniam lepram minatur futuram.

If this evil be confirmed by continuance, there remains scarce any hope of
recovery, ut Rhasis scribit.

Si in Elephantia crus inceperit formicare, malum: quia caloris naturalis
oppressionem portendit.

For the Cure, Curatio.
first, prescribe a fit and convenient diet, such as may engender good blood:
Aeger abstineat a cibis crassis, qui humores melancholicos generant.
Custodiendus est etiam ab ambulatione nimia and statione; yea he must neither
walk nor stand, nisi prius pes fuerit ligatus.

Secondly, if nothing hinder, let some blood be drawn a vena communi aut
basilica ejusdem lateris.

Thirdly, vomits frequently given are very much commended by Rhasis, Gradus,
and Gatenaria: Bertrutius would have the Patient to take one every month,
praecipue si a caussa frigida sit. But first it will be very fit to loosen the
belly cum clysteribus appropriatis, and materiam digerere cum digestivis.
Moreover, Rhasis prescribes Pills de hermodactylis, quae faciunt stypticit atem
post solutionem succedere.

Fourthly, let the member be bound with a Ligature, beginning at the heel, and
so upward until you come to the knee, or (if need require further) ad radicem
natis. Ante tamen constrictionem, epithemanda est ex aloe, myrrha, acacia,
hypocystide, alumine, cum aceto forti dissolutis.

Moreover, this following remedy is held pro secreto. Secretum.
Take a marble or flint stone, and heat it very hot in the fire, then sprinkle
it with strong vinegar, and hold the leg or tumefied place over the fume, but
cover it with some cloth, that so it may receive the vapor the better. It
procures a sweat, and dissolveth the matter.

Lixivium etiam ex cinere querus, sambuci, ebuli, Absynthii, stirpium caulium,
vitis, cum exiguo aeeto, commendatur. It is a good fomentation to discuss and
dry up the matter of the Tumor.

Lastly, if a weakness remain on the member, let it be strengthened cum
styptico emplastro, ex medicinis calidis and frigidis commixto.

Caput 9.
De Thymo seu Thymio.
(...) seu Thymium, Thymon.
is a little Wart appearing upon the body, representing the flower of Time,
slender beneath, but at top broader, very rough and somewhat hard, yielding
forth oftentimes blood.

Oritur vel a materia crassa Causa.
melancholica and pituitosa, or from such juice as is ordained to nourish the
skin and scarf-skin called Epidermis.

Cognoscitur ex iis, Signa.
quae in definitione exposita sunt. Moreover, this Verruca which in color
represents the flower of Time, is almost as great as an Egyptian Bean:
sometimes there grows up one alone, and sometimes many together, either in
the hands, or in the ankles or soles of the feet. But the worst Thymia of all,
are in the unclean or secret parts of the body, where they do commonly bleed.
These have many times a certain malignity, and hidden virulency joined with
them, by occasion whereof they are aggravated even by touching only; because
they have their matter of a fierce and raging humor: The Latins call them
only Ficus, but the Frenchmen Saint Fiacrius Figs.

Thymon saepe per se finitur, Prognostica.
ut Celsus scribit, and the lesser it be, the sooner it is ended.

If it be cut off, there arises up underneath a little round root, which
descends down somewhat deep into the flesh, and there abiding, it does again
cause the aforesaid evil to grow.

Quo ad curam universalem, Curatio.
Aeger abstineat a cibis qui crossos ac frigidos humores procreant. Also the
Patient must abstain from much exercise, especially from venery; because
venereous acts do exceedingly exasperate these verrucae. Purgandum est corpus
cum his, quae melancholiam aut pituitam educunt, aut utrosque.

The Warts that grow on uhe hands, may be cured by applying of Purslain beaten
or stamped in its own juice. The leaves and flowers of Marigolds do certainly
perform the selfsame thing, as Paraeus writes.

Paulus Aegineta in his fourth Book and fifteenth Chapter, rehearses very many
remedies, which do take away and utterly abolish Veruccae. Of the which kind
are Elaterium (which is the juice of wild cucumbers) rubbed on with salt.
Cantharides put into unguents, the juice of Willow-leaves, and Cichorium
varrucarium or Wart cichory, Sheeps dung with vinegar, The water which stands
on the stumps of felled Oaks, Cepa cum sale contusa. Also the juice of Spurge,
called Lac tithymali.

But if nothing hinder, bind the Thymon very surely and strongly with a silk
thread, and still every day more and more gird it, until it fall off; or else
remove it by section; and lest it should again grow up, let one drop of oil of
vitriol be dropped on the place, aut gutta elaterii cum sale, aut cum lacte
tithymali. This water following is held most effectual to consume and waste
warts.

Recipe aquae plantag,. vi. virid. aeris,. ij. alum. roch.. iij. sal. com.. ss.
vit. romans and sublim. ana. ss. beat them all together, and boil them; let one
or two drops of this water be dropped on the place, but take heed the sound
flesh be not touched therewith. Some, the better to prevent any danger, that
may happen by the use of such kind of Medicines, do cover the parts round
about the verruca with leaves. Others do anoint them cum unguento ex bolo
armeno, terra sigillata, aqua rosacea and aceto.

If there be need of burning with fire, then you must provide an iron plate
made fit, with a hole, to couch close about the borders of the Wart, so that
none of the sound skin round about it may appear. Adustion being made, you must
resolve the crust with butter, or with some other unctuous thing, and afterward
cure the place, as other ulcerations.

But if Tbymon grows in the secret parts, and be very painful and hard, then
we must only use a palliative cure. The most excellent Medicine that I know of
in this case, is the unguent set down in the Chapter de Phygethlo.

A certain man, Observatio.
studious of Physic, affirmed, that Oxe-dung tempered with the leaves or
powder of Savine, would waste the Warts of the Womb, if it were applied thereto
warm; which, whether it be true, or not, let experience, the mistress of things
be judge.

Simeon Jacoz, a most expert Physician, tells us of a man that had many Warts
upon the fingers of his hands, which he cured by anointing them four or five
times with the milk of a figtree.

Caput 10.
De Myrmecia.
(...) seu Verruca sessilis, Myrmecia^
is a small, callous, round and thick tubercle, sitting with a broad
foundation, and yielding a sense like to the biting or stinging of a Pissemire
or Ant, when it is handled. And therefore it is called Verruca sormica.

Oritur a frigido, Causa.
crasso, melancholico pituitosoque humore, qui non putret, sed indurescit.

Signa in definitione exposita sunt. Signa.
Moreover, observe that Myrmecia has a broader root, and slenderer top than
Thymon; it is lower, harder, fuller of pain, and less subject to bleeding.
Scarce at any time does it exceed the bigness of a Lupine, or Hop.

Myrmecia sine curatione vix unquam desinit. Prognostica.


It sticks in with broad roots, so that it cannot be cut out, without great
ulceration.

Myrmeciae are to be cured by burning, Curatio.
eating, or corroding medicines, of which you have plenty in the foregoing
Chapter, and therefore thither I refer you.

Galen makes mention of one in his time at Rome, Observatio,
who cured them after this manner. First he brought out the evils by applying
his lips, or by sucking them into his mouth for a space, and then setting to
his foreteeth, he utterly destroyed them, by biting them clean out.

Caput 11.
De Acrochordone.
(...) is a kind of Wart, Acrochordon.
having a thin or slender root, with a callous bunch, like unto the knot of a
rope, hanging by a small thread, round and without pain. It is called of the
Arabians, Verruca boteralis, and of the later writers Verruca pensilis.

Oritur ex materia crassa melancholica and pituitosa, Cause.
quam natura discutere non possit.

Signa in definitione exposita sunt. Signa.
Moreover, Acrochordon is distinguished from myrmecia, because it is slenderer
in the bottom, broader in the top, always standing out from the skin, seldom
growing greater than a Bean, most commonly incident to Children: Sometime
turning to matter, otherwhiles suddenly going away: and now and then moving in
some measure an inflammation. Also (as Celsus says) they grow up thick and
many in number.

Acrochordon saepe sine ullius medicamenti open, Prognostica.
ut Celsus habet, per se desinit.

If it be cut off, it leaves no root behind, and therefore it grows not
again.

Acrochordones are removed, Curatio.
either by Ligature, cutting, burning, or biting: all which I have sufficiently
treated of before. Vide supra in capite de Thymo.

Caput 12.
De Clavo.
(...) seu Clavus, Clavus.
is a round callous Wart, of color white, fashioned like the head of a nail,
growing upon the toes and soles of the feet, and procuring pain in going.

Clavi be often caused of a bruise, Causa.
by the pressure and wringing of shoes.

Cognoscuntur ex iis, quae in definitione Signa.
exposita sunt.

Clavus does scarce at any time cease without curing. Prognostica.


If it be cut you shall see a round root underneath, which causes the Corn or
Agnail to grow again.

If it do bleed in the cutting, it oftentimes dies and cease. Cavendum tamen
ne vel inflammatio, vel cancer consequatur, ut Avicenna adnotavit, nam
aliquando accidit.

For the Cure, Curatio.
it must be anointed cum sanguine anguillae and oil of Mercury; and when it IS
softened, with oil of Snails. When it is cut, smear it with the Urine of a Dog,
and lay on a plaster of red wax.

Efficacissimum etiam est ad clavos in pedibus hoc emplastrum.

Recipe picis navalis. i. galban. acet. diss.. ss. sal. ammon.. i. empl. diach.

them, and the same being spread on a cloth, apply it to the Corn, changing it
every fourth day. Lamina plumbi hydrargyro illita, etiam commendatur.

But the surest way to cure Corns, is, to cut them when the Moon is in the
wane, first washing the feet a pretty while in hot water, and then to apply
lvy-leaves bruised, renewing the same every day morning and evening: for within
fifteen days the Corns are drawn out; by which also we learn, that there is in
lvy a most potent attractive faculty.

Quo ad pleniorem curationis cognitionom, vide supra in capite do Thymo.

Caput 13.
De Moro.
(...) is a soft Tumor, Mormu.
increased from the flesh, in carne rara accidens.

It arises from an alimentary humor which has melancholic blood mingled
therewith. Causa.


Hoc tumoris genus facile cognoscitur, Signa.
multoties in palpebris enascitur. And one I saw lately upon the belly of an
Infant, representing the color, form, and bigness of a Mulberry.

Morum facile in cancri naturam vertitur. Prognosticum.


It is the office of a prudent Surgeon, Curatio.
antequam deveniat ad curam, notare colorem, substantiam, tumoris qualitatem,
and locum. Si timetur cancrositas, recurre ad cancrum.

At si fuerit benignum, incidatur aut ligetur, ut dictum fuit in capite de
Thymo. Postea cauterizetur cum ferro ignito, aut cum aliquo caustico,

Caput 14.
De Callo.
(...) seu Callus, Callus.
or Brawniness, is an hardness bred in the surface of the skin, in the palms of
the hands, and the lowest parts of the soles of the feet.

It is caused by continual labor or much walking. Causa:


It has no deep root; Signa.
it is void of all pain, and so it is distinguished from Clavus.

For the Cure, Curatio.
first let the feet be washed cum aqua aut lixivio, in quibus sit malva
decocta. Vel.

Caput 15.
De Cornibus.
COrnua, Cornua.
are long, thick, crooked Warts like unto horns, breeding upon the joints, by
reason of vehement operation.

Causae sunt eaedem, Causa.
quae in myrmeciae vel nodi capite descriptae sunt.

The Signs are set down in the Definition. Signa.


Cornua difficulter curantur, Prognostica.
and toto vitae tempore saepe durant.

If they be nigh the joints, and hinder their motion, or by pressing do cause
continual pain, they must be cut off, which is done with more safety, cum in
nudis ossibus sola cute obductis consistunt.

Cutis primo aperienda, Curatio.
and cornu denudandum; Postea ferro acuto ab osse abscindendum, and vulnus
conveniente modo curandum.

I read of one that had seven horns upon his head, Historia.
one bigger then another, and in several places. Of which horns there was one
as big, and sharp, as the horn of a little Goat, or of the length of a man's
thumb, and multum laedebat cutem, so that it was a wonder the skin was not
ulcerated.

Avenzoar makes mention of another that had a bone, less hard then a natural
one, growing upon his back ad similitudinem unius cornu.

Alexander Benedictus declares, that in Crete, out of a knee wounded by an
arrow, he saw a black horn come forth, almost like to the head of a wild Goat:
The matter (as he says) which should have been converted into the nature of a
bone was easily turned, afflatu aeris, into the nature of a horn.

Zacutus Lusitanus does relate, that a poor man whom melancholiness did
naturally affect, often complained of a dolorous pain on his right heel, and
did feel in it a kind of hardness, which afterward did turn into a tumor about
the bigness of a small chestnut, hard, rough, and of a leaden or livid color,
which did so increase by the space of eight months, that it came to be of the
length of the palm of a man's hand, and of the very likeness of a horn; which
being afterward cut off, by the counsel of the Physicians, and his body
oftentimes purged, he lived by the space of two years in very good health. But
not long after he did feel in the same place intolerable pains, and in six
months the horn grew again, somewhat longer then it was before, hard, and full
of several very sharp points; which being again cut off by the root, there did
remain a wide and deep hole, from whence a great quantity of a black and putrid
humor flowed forth, so sharp and biting that it eat the flesh round about.

A certain old woman had growing upon the bone Zygoma or Cheek-ball under her
eye an hard body two fingers breadth long, just like an horn both in matter and
shape, being broad at the Basis or bottom, and sharp or pointed at the top,
which in process of time fell off by its own accord, and a Cancer arose in its
place.

Caput 16.
De Varice, Dracunculo, and Malo pilari.
(...) is the dilatation of a vein, Varix.
some whiles of one and that a a simple branch, otherwhiles of many, happening
chiefly in the legs, thighs, under the navil, and sometimes in the temples.
Also the testicles, womb, and fundament, are subject to the Varices. Quae sunt
circa testes, hernia varicosa, seu varicosus ramex dicitur.

Oritur a crasso melancholico sanguine, Causa.
eo vel pondere delapso, vel a causa violenta detruso: as leaping, running, a
vehement concussion of the body, the carrying of a heavy burden, a fall, or a
painful journey on foot.

This kind of disease gives manifest signs thereof by the largeness, Signa.
thickness, swelling, and color of the veins, which are blacker than other;
soft, easily yielding to the finger, and soon returning. Varices often grow in
men (vix tamen ante pubertatem) of a melancholy temper, and which usually feed
on gross meats, or such as breed gross and melancholic humors. Also women with
child are commonly troubled with them, by reason of the heaping together of
their suppressed menstrual evacuation.

Varices non debent curari, Prognostica.
si sunt critici, and ab aliis morbis liberant, ut ab insania solent; according
to the saying of Hippocrates, (...).
if the swelling of veins in the legs, called Varices; or the Haemorrhoides,
shall happen to them which are mad, their madness is dissolved. Quoniam totum
corpus a feculento sanguine per eas expurgantur.

Interdum varices in elephantiam Arabum transeunt.

It is best not to meddle with such as are inveterate; Hipp. lib. 6.
lest being cured, there happen a reflux of the melancholy blood to the noble
parts, Aphor. 21.
whence there may be imminent danger of malign ulcers, a Cancer, madness, or
suffocation.

Varix etiam in testibus difficulter Chirurgiam admittit.

Quo ad curam universalem, tam in rebus non naturalibus, quam in evacuatione,
observabis ea quae in scirrhi curatione scripsimus. Aeger etiam semel in
hebdomada capiat vomitum, and parum deambulet.

Quantum ad localia, ea omnia quae supra dicta sunt in capite de aneurismate,
convenient.

Moreover, Terra Lemnia or Bole armoniack, with the white an egg, and vinegar,
have been oftentimes used with happy success. Also a roll dipped in vino
austero, vel decocto astringente, and applied from the ankle to the knee is
much commended. And so is this plaster:. olei myrtillorum, and rosacei, ana.
i. ss. acaciae, hycistidis, thuris, mastiches, boli armenae, ana. ii. gallarum,
nucum cupressi, malicorii, ana. i. cerae q. s. Fiat emplastrum and utere.

A Varix is cut or taken away, either to intercept the passage of the blood and
other humors flowing to an Ulcer seated beneath; or else lest that by the too
great quantity of blood, the vessel should break, and death be occasioned by a
haemorrhagy proceeding from thence. Quo ad modum sectionis, vide Paraeum lib.
13. cap. 20. page 354.

Dracunculus is the condensation of some certain small nerve, Dracunculus.
which seems both to the Physicians and Patients to have some kind of motion
under the skin; being a Disease very like the Varices; causing great pain, when
increasing by little, and little, it begins to be moved.

Hunc morbum Avicenna Venam Meden vocat, because it is a Disease frequent in
the City Medina. Haliabas venam famosam nuncupavit; aliique Doctores venam
cruris nominarunt.

The Dracunculi are bred in the dry and Sun burnt Regions of India, Arabia, and
the higher parts of Egypt, like worms in the musculous parts of man's body.

They are generated of evil and unlaudable blood, of a venenate kind, gross,
hot and melancholic, or of adust phlegm very much dried, as Manardus writes.

This kind of Tumor is round and long, often stretched from the joint of the
shoulder even to the wrist; or from the groin even to one of the ankles, with
tention, heat, renitency, pricking pain, and a Fever. Also this tumor is
somewhile stretched forth straight, otherwhiles it is crooked and twining like
a Serpent.

Dracunculus curatur eodem modo quo Varices. Which thing chiefly seems to have
moved Guido to refer this kind of Disease to the Varices in his Tractate of
Imposthumes.

Quo vero ad pleniorent Dracunculi cognitionem, vide Galenum, Avicennam, and
alios qui hanc materiam tractarunt.

Malum pilare called by the French Cridones a Crinibus, Malum pilare.
arises from thick, strong, and short hairs, which are scarce of a pins
length, chiefly troubling children, pricking their backs like thorns, and
keeping them from rest.

Curatur aquae plusquam tepidae fomentatione, after which to draw forth the
hairs, you must presently apply an ointment made of honey, and wheaten flower;
and being thus drawn, they must be plucked out with small mullets.
