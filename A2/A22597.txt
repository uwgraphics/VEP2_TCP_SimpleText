By the King.
A Proclamation to restrain the landing of Men, or Goods, out of such Ships as
shall come from the parts of France, or the Low Countries now infected with the
Plague, till they have warrant from the Officers or Farmours of His Majesty's
Customs.

THe Kings Majesty being informed, that the infection of the plague is at this
present time dispersed into diverse Towns and places, both of France, and the
Low Countries: and weighing the danger that may ensue to His own Kingdoms and
people, by the resort of persons, from any infected parts, or the landing of
their goods here: Has thought fit, (with the advice of His Privy Council)
out of His Princely care of the safety of His Subjects, and by all provident
means to prevent the peril and inconveniences that may arise thereby, to
declare and publish His Royal Will and Pleasure in that behalf: And does
therefore hereby straightly charge and command, That during the time of the
infection in those or any other parts, no Ships or Vessels whatsoever, ariuing
in any parts of this Kingdom, shall land any Passenger, or Person, or any
Apparel, Houshould-stuffe, Wares, or Merchandises, until such time as they
shall have License from the Officers or Farmours of His Majesty's Customs, or
some of them, upon due consideration by them first taken of the parts and
places from whence such Shipping shall come: upon pain of imprisonment of
every person so landing, or otherwise vnlading or sending a shore any such
Wares or Goods, and to be further proceeded against, as high contemners of His
Majesty's Royal Commands.

And for such Ships or Vessels, as (coming from any infected parts) shall
arrive here, His Majesty's pleasure is, that the Officers and Farmours of His
Customs take special care that no License or Warrant be given for the coming
a shore of any person, or the landing or vnlading of any goods therein, until
twenty days after the arrival of such Ship or Vessel here; whereby it may be
known, whether the men in such Ship shall stand in health or no: And if in
such Vessel there shall be brought Apparel, Houshould-stuffe, or Wares, that
may be thought fit to be ayred, that then the same be conueighed to some
convenient place, near the Waterside, remote from the City of London, or any
other Town or place of much resort.

And for the better effecting of His Majesty's Royal pleasure in the
Premises, His Majesty's Farmours of His Customs are hereby required, upon the
arrival of any Ship, Bark, or Vessel in any part of this Kingdom, to send a
board one or more Waiters or Guardians, the better to restrain the landing of
Goods, or coming a shore of Men out of such Shipping, until due trial shall
be had, that the same may be done without peril or danger of Infection.

And lastly, His Majesty does hereby require and command all Justices of
Peace, Majors, Bailiffes, Sheriffs, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other
His Officers and Ministers whatsoever, to be aiding and assisting in the full
accomplishment and execution of His Majesty's Royal Pleasure herein declared,
which so much imports the common good and safety of His Kingdoms and people.

Given at the Court at Hampton Court, the first day of November, in the
eleventh year of His Majesty's Reign.
God save the King.
