A Proclamation for the Apprehension of John Holland, and Robert Blow,
Gentlemen, late servants to the Earl of Lincoln.
FOrasumch as John Holland, and Robert Blow, late servants to the Earl of
Lincoln, the first in the place of Steward of his Lordships house, and the
other Clerk of his ^chin, have lately committed diverse notable misdemean^rs,
to the danger of this State, and happy peace thereof coutrary to that duty and
Allegiance which they ought to bear unto Us do now lurk and keep themselves
close in some secret place or places, and will not submit themselves to
Justice, to the great abuse and insufferable contempt of Us, and Our Regal
authoritte; We have thought fit, by the advice of Our Privy Counsel, for
special reasons of State, to publish the same to all Our loving Subjects, not
doubting of their care and forwardness in their discovery and Apprehension:
And We do hereby charge and command all and singular Justices of the Peace,
Majors, Shiriffes, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other Our
Officers, Ministers and Subjects whatsoever, to be diligent in inquiring and
searching for the said John Holland and Robert Blow, in all places whatsoever,
as well within Liberttes as without, whom, (or either of them,) if they shall
happen to take, Our will and pleasure is That they cause him or them so
apprehended, to be safely carried to the Sheriff of that County, where he or
they shall be so apprehended; and the Shiriffe of that County safely to convey
him or them, which shall be so brought unto him, unto the Lords of such further
course to be taken with them, as We, by the advice of Our Counsel, shall
direct: And hereof they and every of them, whom it may concern, are to take
special care, as they will answer the neglect thereof, at their perils, letting
all Our loving Subjects know, that if any person or persons, after this Our
Proclamation published, shall directly or indirectly conceal, harbor, keep,
retain or maintain the said John Holland, and Robert Blow, or either of them,
or shall not use his or their best endeavor for their Apprehension, as well by
giving due advertisement thereof to Our Officers, as by all other good means,
We will (as there is just cause) proceed against them that shall so neglect
this Our commandment, with all severity.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the one and twentieth day of March, in the
second year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
