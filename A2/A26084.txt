Whereas a few Malevolent and Ambitious persons, in the name of two Houses of
Parliament, have by Treasonable practices imbroyled this Kingdom in a Civil
War, pursued His Majesty's Person, murdered His good Subjects: some,
barbarously by the common Hangman, against Law and Justice: others, by Hostile
assaults: brought a general devaslation upon the whole Kingdom; taking away
all liberty from the Members of both Houses; by awing, terrifying, and
assaulting them with Tumults and Armies; usurping the Royal power,
Counterfeiting a Great Seal: and to she their horrid intentions against the
King, Kingdom, and Government, finding their Acts nor likely to protect them
from the punishment due to their merits, have unnaturally invited and brought
in the Scots to invade this Kingdom: and in these distractions, to make a
total conquest of this Nation. For resistance whereof, and preserving the
Common-Peace, the inhabitants of Cornwall and Devon have united themselves; and
for continuance of which Union, this ensuing Protestation is to be taken.

The Protestation.
I A. B. Do in the presence of Almighty God, promise, vow, and protest, with my
utmost power to maintain and defend the true. Reformed Protestant Religion,
established by Law in this Kingdom, against all Popery, Popish, and other
innovations of Sectaries and Schismatics; as also His Majesty's person and
Rights, against all forces whatsoever; and in like manner, the Laws, Liberties,
and Privil^dges of Parliament, and of this Kingdom. And I shall, to the utmost
of my power, preserve and defend the Peace of the two Counties of Cornall and
Devon; and all Persons that shall unite themselves by this our Protestation, in
the due performance thereof. And to my power assist His Majesty's Armies for
reducing the Town of Plymouth; and resistance of all Forces of Scots, invaders,
and others, levied under pretense of any authority of two Houses of Parliament,
or otherwise, without His Majesty's personal consent.

In regard of the restless endeavors of the Contrivers of the present
distractions, who after the unnatural divisions they have wrought, and move
misery by calling in the Scots, to make the desolation of this Nation it
recoverable: and it being the duty of all good Subjects and lovers of their
country, in such times to unite themselves, that they may the better resist the
disturbers of the public Peace.

We of the Counties of Cornwall and Devon, (by rcason of situation and
alliance of families, nearly concerned in each others condition) for the
preservation of the Peace already obtained among us and for a further increase
and security of it; do associate andunite our selves (according to our duty to
God, His Majesty, and our Country) for the common defense of these Counties,
against all forees that oppose His Majesty's Army, or Commissioners, authorized
under His Great Seal of England: and against all Towns, Castles, and Forts,
that shall resist His Majesty's said Army or Commissioners.

And we do promise in the presence of Almighty God, that we will not break this
union, nor desist from following all just, necessary, and Honorable ways, to
the urmost of our power, for perfecting and securing the said Peace, and the
reducing all Places, Persons, Towns, Castles, and Forts, within the said
Counties, to His Majesty's obedience, and particularly the Town of Plymouth.

And in case either of the said Counties be invaded by Sea or Land, we do bind
our selves, to mutual defense of each other, against all persons raised
without His Majesty's personal consent: and to resist all such power, with all
the strength each County can raise for the others defense.

FINIS.
