FINIS.
An Advertisement to the READER.
HAving a desire to show our near Agreement with many other Christians, of whom
we have great Esteem; we some Years since put forth a Confession of our Faith,
almost in all Points the same with that of the Assembly, and Savoy, which was
subscribed by the Elders and Messengers of many Churches baptized on profession
of their Faith; and do now put forth a short Account of Christian Principles,
for the Instruction of our Families, in most things agreeing with the Shorter
Catechism of the Assembly. And this we were the rather induced to, because we
have commonly made use of that Catechism in our Families: And the Difference
being not much, it will be more easily committed to Memory.
