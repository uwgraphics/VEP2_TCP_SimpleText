By the King.
A Proclamation for restraint of disorderly and unnecessary resort to the Court.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, having taken into His Princely
consideration, the many inconveniences which may fall out by the unlimited
concourse of people of all sorts to His Court, or the Towns or Parishes near
the same, especially at this time, and in this season of the year, which
grows every day more dangerous for increasing the infection, already begun in
the City of London, and Confines of the same; And being graciously and
prouidently careful to take away and prevent all occasions tending thereunto,
has thought fit by advice of His Privy Council, by this Proclamation to
publish and declare his Royal pleasure and commandment concerning the same,
That although his Majesty cannot but conceive great joy and contentment, when
His loving Subjects, out of their loyal and dutiful affections toward him,
shall desire to see the Persons of Himself, or of his dear Consort the
Queen, who is (by Gods blessing) shortly to come over into England; yet, in
his Princely care of His people, He is contented to dispense with those
public shows of their zeal, chearefulnes, and alacrity at this time* lest
the present occasions of joy and rejoicing, should produce a contrary effect,
by dispersing the Infection into other parts of the Realm, where his Majesty
shall keep his Royal Court and residence.

And therefore his Majesty does hereby straightly charge and command, That
as well in the Journey, which Himself shortly intends to Dover in Kent, for
the reception of his dear Consort, the Queen, at Her arrival, as also in
His, and Her Majesty's return from thence, and in all other Iourneys and
Progresses, which they or either of them shall make this Summer now ensuing,
till they shall return to a standing house in Winter, No person or persons
whatsoever, not being thereunto called or appointed, or not having special
cause of personal attendance at the Court for his Majesty's service, or for
some necessary occasion of extremity concerning their own estate, do presume
to follow, or resort to the Court with Petitions, or upon other pretense, or
unto any City, Town, Uillage, or private house within twelve miles of the
same, as they tender his Majesty's displeasure, and will answer for the same,
as contemners of this his Majesty's just and Royal commandment. And whereas
many of his Majesty's loving Subjects have been heretofore wont to pester the
Court, under color of repairing thither for healing the disease called The
Kings Evil, His Majesty does hereby publish and declare his pleasure, That
until Michaelmas next, and after His Coronation shall be solemnized, He will
not admit any person or persons to come to the Court for healing; And does
straightly charge and forbid, That no person or persons do in the mean time
presume to importune his Majesty in that behalf: And for avoiding many, and
great abuses in that behalf, his Majesty does straightly charge and command,
That no person or persons do at any time hereafter resort to his Majesty, or
His Court for healing of that disease, without bringing a Certificate from the
Minister, and Churchwardens of the Parish wherein they inhabit, or some other
neighbors of more eminent quality, expressing the time they have been troubled
with that infirmity, and that they have not at any time before been healed by
his Majesty, or the late King: And to avoid the great disorder of poor
people, who are used to come flocking into the high ways, and streets, where
his Majesty is to travel, under color of relief from the Almoner, his
Majesty has taken order, that in all the Towns and Parishes, through which
He shall pass, his Majesty's said Almoner shall deliver his Majesty's Alms
to the Overseers of the Poor, to be distributed amongst them, for their better
and more equal relief, then they should receive by coming abroad in that
dishonorable and indecent manner; which therefore his Majesty straightly charge
and commands them to forbear, and all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace,
Constables, and other Officers, to take due care of accordingly. And for other
wandering poor, Uagabonds, Rogues, and such like base and unruly people, which
pester the high way, and make it their Trade or profession to live by begging,
pilfering, or other unlawful shifting, His Majesty does hereby straightly
charge and command, as well the Knight Marshall of His household and his
deputies, as all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Constables, and other
his Majesty's Officers and loving Subjects, to cause such as be Impotent, to
be forthwith returned into their own Countries, and such as be able to
labor, to be sent to the houses of Correction, or otherwise ordered according
to the Laws: To which end also, his Majesty likewise charge and commands
the said Sheriffs, Justices, and other Officers, to cause diligent Watch by
night, and Ward by day to be kept by honest and substantial householders, in
every City, Town, Uillage, and Parish, through which his Majesty shall pass,
and within twelve miles compass of his Majesty's passage or Court, as well to
be ready upon all occasions to suppress disorders and breaches of the Peace,
as to make special search for all such persons, as shall pretend themselves to
be his Majesty's Servants, or followers of the Court, and crave Lodging
without having Billets for the same, and to apprehend all such as they shall
find so lodged or entertained, and not billeted, and to bring them before the
Knight Marshal, or his deputy, and in all other things to be assisting to him
and them concerning the premises, for all occasions of his Majesty's service.

And because his Majesty finds much disorder in some of his own servants,
in unnecessary pestering of the Court, when there is no cause for their
attendance or employment, His Majesty straightly forbids, That any of his
servants do either in this Journey of his Majesty's intended to Dover, or
elsewhere in His Summers Progress, or until his Majesty shall come to keep a
standing house in Winter, resort to the Court, execpt such only of his
Majesty's servants, as are, or shall be set down in the List, or shall be
allowed for service within doors, and above stairs, by the Lord Chamberlain
of his Majesty's honorable household, or below stairs, by the Treasurer and
Comptroller of the household, or for service without doors by the Knight
Marshall, upon pain of his Majesty's displeasure, and incurring the Censure of
a high contempt.

And to the end his Majesty's Royal pleasure herein before declared, may be
in all points observed, his Majesty straightly charge and commands His
Knight Marshall, and all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Constables,
Headboroughs, Bayliffes, and other his Majesty's Officers whatsoever, to see
all things concerning the premises, carefully performed, and put in due
execution, according to the duties of their several places, as they and every
of them will answer for any their neglects herein, at their uttermost perils.

Given at the Court at White Hall, the seventeenth day of May, in the first
year of his Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
