A Proclamation touching the Importation of French Wines.
WHereas We have been given to understand, by the humble complaint, as well of
the Company of French Merchants, as of the Company of Vintners of London, that
the quantities of French Wines already imported, and now remaining in this
Kingdom, are so great, as that unless the further Importation of such Wines
be for a convenient time prohibited, they shall not be able for the support
and maintenance of their Trade, to make sale of those Wines which do now lie
upon their hands; We, therefore having taken this into Our Princely
consideration, as also the manifold inconveniences, which already have, and do
daily grow by the liberty taken by occasion of the late disturbance of Free
Trade in France, to import Wines in Foreign Bottomes, contrary to Our Laws,
by, and with the Advice of the Lords, and others of Our Privy Counsel, do
hereby strictly charge, prohibit and command, that no person or persons
whatsoever, do attempt, or presume to bring or import into this Realm of
England, or Dominion of Wales, or into any Port, Haven, Creek, or place
thereof, any Wines whatsoever of the growth of France, before the first day of
February now next ensuing.

And further, by the like Advice of Our Privy Counsel, We do hereby publish
and declare Our Royal pleasure to be, and do strictly prohibit and command,
That no Wines whatsoever, shall hereafter be imported into this Our Realm, or
the Dominions thereof, in any foreign Ship, Hoy, or other Vessel whatsoever,
contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this Our Realm in that behalf made and
provided, but only in English Bottomes, upon such pains and punishments, as
by Our Laws, or by Our Prerogative Royal can, and may be inflicted upon all
such persons, who shall at any time hereafter presume to offend herein,
contrary to Our Laws, and contrary to this Our pleasure herein declared.

Nevertheless, Our intent or meaning is not, but that the French Merchants,
the natural borne Subjects of Our dear Brother the French King, shall have
and enjoy the like liberty of bringing in as well the Wines of France, as other
the natural Commodities of that Kingdom, in any Ships or other Vessels of
their own building, and appertaining unto themselves, as formerly they have
used and enjoyed.

Given at Our Court at Nonsuch, the seventh day of July, in the Fifth year of
Our Reign Of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
