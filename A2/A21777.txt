By the Queen.
Whereas her Majesty is given to understand, that although she has paid and
disbursed all manner of chardges and expenses apperteyning to her Majesty's
household, and the arrearages thereunto belonging, until the feast of Saint
Michael, which was in the year of our Lord 1575 and in the seventeenth year
of her Majesty's reign: And also that although her Majesty has paid and
disbursed all her household chardges since that time, saving a very small
remnant of arrearages: that yet notwithstanding some of her good subjects do in
diverse places complain they are unsatisfied and unpaid of such money, as her
Majesty has disbursed and paid for their satisfaction: Therefore her
Majesty's pleasure is, that her said subjects should be warned and admonished
there by this Proclamation, to this end and purpose, that if any of them do
remain unpaid of their due, that has been thus wise disbursed by her
Majesty to their use, that all and every such person so unpaid of their due
should make their repair by themselves or their sufficient Deputes, unto the
chief Officers of her Majesty's household with then sufficient declaration in
writing, or their sufficient testimony, what money is owing and unpaid unto
any such person in this behalf. And that if any of them shall after this their
said declaration yet remain unsatisfied, such persons shall present their just
complaynt thereof unto her Majesty's privy Counsel, to the end that every of
them may be satisfied, as to equity and Justice shall apperteyne.

And if any person shall be either by sickness, or by poverty, not well able
to make repair in person, not by Depute, as before is said, and that in some
towns and parishes the several debts may be so small, as the parties will be
loath to make a journey for such small parcels: In such cases the said persons
shall do well, to make declaration to some next Justice of Peace, of the
quantity of the debt, and of the proof thereof, in what sort, and for what
matter the same grew due. And thereupon her Majesty wills and requires the
said Justice, to not^f^ the same by his letter either to the head Officers of
the household, or to some others of her Majesty's priuey Counsel, to the intent
that not only the party may be satisfied, but also it may be known where
the default of payment was.

Given at her Majesty's Castle of Wyndesor, the last day of September, 1577.
in the nineteenth year of her Highness reign.
