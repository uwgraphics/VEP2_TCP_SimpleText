The prologue.
IN the begynny^ge of this new year / my good systers when I consider and se
many friends give tokens of custom one to another / which custom / some use
it for good luck of a new year / some to procure carnal love / some to get a
greater benefyte thereby / some to get worldely favor or mayntenaunce in ill
/ some to please and flatter them that been ill / (which causes ben not
commendable) some to procure love and to continue frendshyp and peace in the
comune life / between neighbor and neighbor / which is right good and
conuenyent to do. And some with right godly intent to purchase ghostly love.
For one ghostly friend to remember another the more heartily in prayers / whi^ I
think right comme^dable. And after this intent (as I suppose) diverse of you
have given tokens unto me. Wherefore having nothing ready to give unto you
again / I purpose in my mind to prepare one token for you all / to profit
each of you. This token think it truly I have not of my self / but of god /
as I have herd and read of holy doctors / and by conjecture of the way to
good living / and nothing by experyence of my self. It is full vnsemynge to
me for to show or write unto you of the way to virtue / which am not yet all
out of ye way of wyckednes. Yet a gryndyngston makes a knyfe bright and sharp
/ though it be never the sharper it self. So I may moeue you to make you
sharp and quycke to ghostly things and to clerenesse of good living / though
I my self be right slow and dull unto the same. To teache goodness is a
thing that may not be undone / of them that have cure and rewle of other
persons / though they do but little good themself. Christ said of the
pharysyes rulers of the people. Do as they say / but not as they do. Not
withstanding our lord has given me a desire to do well. I beseech him I
may have grace to perform my desire to his pleasure / honor and laud.
Therefore though my simple lyuy^ge can stir you but little. I trust that my
good will and desire that I have to your ghostly profit shall mcyte you both
to encreace the more in virtue / and also to help me with your prayers unto the
same. Alytell Dyetary for your daily conuersacyo^ I purpose for to write /
deuydy^ge it into. xxiiij consyderacyons / as the day is divided into.
xxxiiij. hours / which though it be rudely written / it may profit you much
/ if ye will dylyge^tly put it i^ execucyon of workynge / and else it
profytech little / but rather hurts. For christ says a sermaunte that knows
ye will of his master and will not do thereafter shall be bette with many great
strokes. And who soever studyeth for the will of god and forgete it not / but
dylyge^tly put it to workynge / he shall be blessed of god / and have
everlasting Joy for so doing / if he perceyuer therein.

To remember that we ben pilgrims and to what place we ben toward.
IT is necessary first to consider / that we be^ here in this life as pilgrims
/ having no long resting place / but always being forwards other to heaven
were we shall have eternal rest / orels we ben in the wrong way / the which
shall led us to euerlasty^ge sorrow. Learn to know that one way fro that
other. And than every day wha^ ye shall go to do any thing / ask this
questyon of your self / saying in your mind to your self. Whyder art thou
going / considering wisely / whyder ye be^ in ye way of virtue or wyckednes
/ following christ or the devil / in the way to heaven or to hell. And say
these verses. Vias tuas domine demonstra michi: et se mitas edoce me. Dirige me
in veritate tua et doce me: quia tues deus saluator meus: and te sustinui tota
die. Set god for ye mark that ye will go unto / take his commandments for
your way and run steadfastly therein. Have good hope in his goodness / utterly
dystrustynge the dysceyuable co^solacyons of ye world / through the which many
souls be^ dysceyued.

The precyousnesse of time and the shortness of the same.
SEcundarely it is to consider the precyousnes of time / which is given us to
do penance in / for our life past and to labor for Joy in the life to come.
And how that god shall require of every person how he has expended the time
given unto him. And think that every time not spent to his honor is lost /
and shall be straytly punysshed. Beheld how short our time is / and how
uncertain / being no thing surer but only this time present / yt is but now
/ having always death suspecte / that comes upon us suddenly many diverse
ways. And make always a sure reckoning for the time past. Saying this prayer
daily. O bone Ihesu: sint cora^te in obliuione mea tempora preterita valde male
consumpta. Et concede: vt hoctemporis mei residium: tibi sit honorificum: michi
fructuosum et proximo edificatorium. Qui viuis et regnas cumdeo. etc. That is
to say in English. O good lord Ihesu let all my times past be forgoten
before the / yt I have consumed very ill. And grant that this resydew of my
time may be used in honor and worship unto the / fruit full unto my self /
and edyfyenge to my neighbor / which lyuest with god the fader in unity of
the holy ghost world without end. Amen. And at every time that ye clock
does stryke / consider that your life is shorted by an hour / saying thus to
our lady / for to socour you at ye hour of death. Maria plena gratie: matter
misericordie: tu nos ab host protige: and in hora mortis suscipe. Mary mother
full of grace / mother also of mercy / defend us from our enemy / and at the
hour of death / take us to thy proteccyon. And so I trust there shall come
great grace thereof.

How god is present to us and his angel.
Remember always that what soever ye do / our lord god is always present /
seeing and considering every thought / word / and deed / and straytly shall
call us to a acco^pte for the^. Therefore it is necessary to observe good manner
and reverent behauyoure / both inward in mind / and outward in body /
as well in chamber or cell as in other secret places / as in presence of great
astates / having always honor and reverence to god / and to our good angel /
ferynge and being ashamed to do that thing in ye presence of god / yt ye
should be ashamed of in ye presence of men. And wha^ ye be^ alone / say often
this verse. Qui cognoscis oculta cordis: parce peccatis nostris. Lord that
know est the pryuytes of heart / we beseech the spare us / that we be not
dampened for our sins / and great offenses.

Not only the body / but also the mind must be sparred us from the occasyons
of ill.
Think though ye should be closed up within. iiij. walls. It is not enough to
have your bodies sparred from the occasyons of ill / where ye mind is
wandrynge abroad in carnal pleasure / musing upon worldly vanytes / besyed
with works and matters of other persons / and carynge much for your friends
and kynnesfolkes / occupied sometime with unlawful and uncleanly thoughts and
desires. Therefore ye must close up also your mind and affeccy on fro all
such things. And that must be by often and contynuall remembrance of god /
as nere as ye may. Close up and hyde your love and mind in ye deep and large
wounds of our lord Ihesu christ by devout remembrance of his pytefull
passion / always abiding there / for there our enemies dare not meddle / but
whyder ye will or not / they will enter with you into the materyall cloister /
your enemy the flesh must needs in / ye devil will not be behind. And as I
suppose / ye shall have of him more force and stronger battle there than ever
ye had before. And that we thy^ke now right little and easy / shall than
perchance be full hard and grievous to overcome. Therefore prepare your self
manly. Stand fast in faith / and remember ye reward of your vyctory /
trusting in god only for strength.

How the world brings in trouble unto relygous persons.
THe world trusseth his gere and hydeth them in a corner of a man's soul /
unto ye time that he is entered into relygyon. And than the devil brings them
to light. So that those vanytes / sins / and inquyet business / that ye have
seen / herd / and ben in / shall than come to remembrance / which now ye be^
nothing troubled with / as hyden within you. Than also the world shall send
unto you by craft of the devil / tidings and tale berers which shall let
you of great profit / if ye be not ware. Sparre them out therefore and avoid
them from you / and never be glad to here worldly rumors / ne vain
talking. Let not the devil hyde up such things in your souls that
afterward may put you to trouble. Be never glad to talk and here of other
persons ill demenour / of their beauty / their countenance / their apparel /
and specially of detraccyon or backbytynge of any manner of persons / but
rather flee their company / or moeue them to say well / and to speak that is
honest and conuenyent for to here / saying thus before ye shall speak with any
worldely persons. Domine libera any mam meam a labiis iniquis and lingua
dolosa. Good lord I beseech the deliver my soul from ye lyppes of wicked men
and from a dysceyuable tongue.

To order well every time avoiding ydelnesse.
THan after the counseyll of some good man dyspose and order every time of the
day to some profit bodily or ghostly. So that idleness before all things
may be utterly excluded. For idleness is the mother of all ill / stepdame to
virtue / forger of uncleanness / the way to unstableness nuryssher of vices /
increacer of slothfulness / kyndeler of malice and inuye. It sows ill
thoughts. It ge^dreth ill desires / and brings forth many ill works. It
makes us weary of ghostly lyuy^ge. It puts us in fere of ghostly battle /
and dryueth us from the way of penance. O falls ydelnes how many do you
deceive. Ydelnesse is the snare that the devil hydeth ymonges ye grass of the
grene flourysshynge youth / and ymonges the fallyngeleues leaves of the vain
worldely Joy and pleasure / and very hard it is to escape it. Therefore beware
that the devil in no wise find you in this snare / but if ye be caught therein
/ break out betymes before he catch hold upon you. For when he has hold
upon you / it is hard to break away.

How we should give us to diverse exercyses.
ANd because our mind which is much subject unto vanyte whiles we ben in
this life / abides never long in one state. Therefore we must drive away
ydelnes by diverse change of good exercyses. As sometime by good hand work /
and conuenyent bodyly labor. Sometime in prayer / sometime in study / or redynge
of scripture or of some good works of holy doctors. Sometime i^ medytacyon and
contemplacyon if ye can attain thereto. And se ye your hand warke be other to
the honor of god / to ye profit of poor people / orels for your own
necessyte. And in every thing that ye shall do. Se first that it be lawful
for you to do it. Secu^darely if it become you for to do it. Thyrdely whyder it
be expedye^t for to do it. For all things that been lawful and semynge for you
to do / are not to be done / but if they ben expedyent. Saint Poule to wytnes.
Omnia michilice^t: set non omnia michi expediunt. Therefore that thing that is
semy^ge expedyent and not again the commandment of god perform it / saying
before every work. In nomine patris. etc. with a Pater noster and un Aue maria.

Of exercise in prayer and study.
Your prayers besides the hours of dewty which must be preferred before any
thing / ye may prolonge or make short as the holy ghost gives grace of
devotion or good desire. And beware that long prayer gender not tedyousnesse.
For better it is to pray often breuely with devotion / than long vndeuoutly /
except devotion be inspired by long desire. Beware also ye make no band ne
bone of nombre of psalms or prayers / but use them for the time that ye have
pleasure and devotion in the^. And where devotion slacketh / than go to redynge
or to some other exercise / so confortynge your spyrytes / avoiding the sin
of sloth. In your study and redynge of books se that they ben conuenyent for
you. And mark well all such things as make to the exemple of good life /
both for to feel at your self / and to show it unto other for the same
intent. And before ye go to read or study / say thus. Spiritus sancti gratia
illuminet corda et corpora nostra. With a Pater noster. That is the grace of
the holy ghost light on us both soul and body. And after your redynge /
remember brefely what ye have read / and than say thus. Confirma hoc deus quod
operatus es in nobis. With a Pater noster. How to be ordered at your vprysynge /
when ye wake in the morning from sleep after the hour assygned to rise.
Forthwith lift up your heart to god / co^mytynge your self to his proteccyon
/ and give him thanks / for that he has preserved you that night past /
sufferynge no vain thoughts to fall into your mind / but shortly bless you
and fall unto your prayer. Be never ouercomen with sluggysshnesse ne dullness
of body / as some be^ that with gronynge and grutchynge rise out of their
beds. But with a quycke mind put away all sloth as though christ our spouse
did call you unto marriage / saying to your self. Rise thou wretched body
out of of thy couche / make the ready and light thy lamp / go mete with thy
spouse / and do thy duty leest thou be refused for coming to late. Be not
long in ye apparyllynge of your self / but apply you unto your work or
service enjoined to you for to do. With gladness of mind let no vanytes
appear in your apparel / but keep always a semynge form and an vnyfourme
way in your dressynge / using another to rude vesture ne to precious / but in
a mean / no wise desiring to please the world by it / but to honor god. Call
also beseli unto god for his help and grace / that ye may be strong against
the malice and power of your enemies. For many have be^ in great peril both of
body and soul / because they have not blessed them self and honored god at
their vprysynge. Therefore say always when ye rise some blessing and prayer /
as ye may find in diverse books.

Of herynge mass.
IF it may be / here mass every day. For by that ye be made the more able to
all good works in the day following / and prosper ye better in every thing.
In mass time be dylygent asmoche as ye may to have devotion / committing
your self and all that longs unto you to him that is there present. The
mass is the very memoryall of Crystes passion. Than if ye will have devotion /
fall to some medytacyon of Crystes holy passion. For there is nothing that
kyndelyth man's affection so soon as ye medytacyon thereof. If ye will be
perfytely purged from vices. If ye will be endued with virtues. If ye will be
lyghtned with understanding. If ye will have vyctory of your enemies. If ye
will have consolacyon in aduersyte. If ye will have sweetness with teres in
your prayers. If ye will depart pleasau^tly out of this life. If ye will have
redely everlasting joy. Use devout medytacyon of crystes passion in your
mass herynge. And also every other time before ye shall pray. The mass is of
merueylous great effect. For after the saying of saint Austyn. By every mass
devoutly said is there one soul delivered out of purgatory / and one sinner
converted. Therefore here mass devoutly / besechynge our lord saye^ge. Blessed
Ihesu let me sy^ner be ye person ye shall be steadfastly converted unto the. And
say this prayer. Ai^a cristisanctifica me. And wha^ ye be comonde / se that ye
dyspose your self before with hye devotion and mekenes / by contrycyon /
confession / and devout prayers / so that ye may receive your maker to the
salvation and strength of your souls. And after to contynu the more steadfast
in virtue.

How gods service and prayer should be said.
THe service that ye be commanded for to say and all that longs to obedyence
/ se that ye fulfill most dylygently before all thing. For other prayers ben
not acceptable to god / if ye leave on those things that ye are bound to of
dewte. Therefore when the bell ryngeth to service / consider as it were ye
trumpe that shall be blown at ye Judgment. Than hye you fast to church with
great meekness and fere / to treat and dyscusse your causes before god ye
most hye Judge / most mighty / most ferefull / most wise / most tyghtwyse
/ but yet most merciful. Remember that he is mercyful to all them that been
meke and obedyent / and their complayntes and petycyons only he delyteth to
here. Therefore dyspose your self to mekenes before your prayer / by some
medytacyon / as of your sinful life with sorynes therefore / of your few merytes
and innumerable demerytes / of ye daily mysery in this life / of ye infynyte
peynes for sin after this life. Of the great endelesse Joy in heaven / of the
great goodness of god / for delayenge our punysshement / for yt we should amend
our life. Of ye great mercy of our savior Ihesu / sufferynge bitter passion
for our redempcyon. Which al / but these pryncypally ben great causes for to
meken our hearts / and to serve god deuoutely. And when ye have great devotion
by meekness. Say your service and prayers not only in your one person / as
for your self / but in the person of our mother ye holy church. In yt which
there be^ some as prisoners in ye peynes of purgatory. Some as traitors that been obstynate sinners. Some as suers for their pardon yt ben penytent. Some as
mynysters and servants that been in the state of grace. Some ben assystent with
god / to be our patrones and vocates they ben holy angels and saints. Now
ymagyne that sometime our lord speaks unto us / and we sometime unto him in
our psalms and other seruyces that we say. And sometime we treat for the
prisoners. Somtye we compain of our adversaries. Sometime we desire hy^ to
spare his traitors / yt they may have space to amend. Sometime we labor to
our patrones and vocates for to help to opteyne favor and grace. Sometime we
magnyfy his power / his wisdom / his goodness / with law and praise.
Therefore think it no little cause that ye come to church for. Before a
temporal king causes ben dyscussed / for this bodyly life with great dylyge^s
/ fere / and reverence. Much more tha^ ought we with great mekenes / reverence /
and fere / dyscus our ghostly matters for the safegarde and promocyon of our
souls before the high Judge. And though ye understand not what ye say /
consider that ye be^ as a poor wretch yt has a complaynt or supplycacyon to
put unto the king / made by a learned man / wherein all your desire is contained
more expedyently / than ye can do it your self. Thus remember where and in
whose presence ye be^ / and for what cause. And before ye go to your service
call for grace and say. Rex christ cleme^tissime: tu corda nostra posside: vt
tibi lauds de bitas: reddamus omni te^pore. Suffer not your mind to wa^der
as nere as ye may. And say after every hour where ye have been neclygent.
Deus propitius esto michi peccatori. And when ye have said yt is your duty /
than say your other prayers and memoryes of saints as your devotion is moeued.

To have a synguler devotion to some special saints.
IT is very good to have a synguler devotion / to some special saints / in
whom ye have great confydence to be your advocates / helpers / and defenders
at all needs to call on the^ / which may opteyne for you yt ben not worthy or
able of your self. But most specially in any wise to have ye glorious queen
of heaven mother of christ at all time in most loving reverence with most hardy
affection loving unto her / as to most sure refuge in all needs / peril /
and temptacyons / taking her next christ / for most hye and trusty vocate /
gyuynge every day some synguler laud and prayer to her mercyful goodness. And
yt your devotion and reverence to her made / be yt more acceptable. Study to
follow her in pure chastyte and clennes of body and soul with all meekness of
heart and lowlynesse to every person in word and deed. We have so many
enemies and they ben so crafty / that without her help and other holy saints
/ we are not able to escape their danger. The fore chose you such patrones yt
may help you in this dangerous life / and defend your souls from all cruel
enemies at the hour of death specially / and bry^ge you gracyously to
perpetual safegarde.

Te commendacyon of vyrgynyte.
Remember wisely to whom ye be^ despoused. Whom ye desire to have in marriage
/ and pray him mekely that has inspyred you with so good will / and given you
such desire to preserve and perform the same. Ye have promised your
vyrgynyte to Christ. Think this came not of your self For it is impossible so
to do and continue / but only by grace. Consider how precious a tresoure ye
bear in a frail vessel. Remember what reward / what glory / what crown of
Joy ye shall have / by keeping of pure vyrgynyte. And fere what pain / what
shame / what co^fusyon / what da^pnaco^n ye shall fall in if it be lost. What
treasure is better than that / wherewith ye may by heaven. wherein angels
greatly delight. Whereby Christ hy^ self is allect and moeued to love you
specially. And to give (not only himself) to you / but also every thing that
is good. The swetenes of meke vyrgynyte gave so sweet an odor into heaven /
that it made the king of all kings to have such a celestyall concupysce^ce
and love unto the most meke vyrgyne Mary yt he descended from heaven to earth
for to be married unto our nature / but ye shall not be crowned till ye be well
proved as gold in ye furneys. For scripture says / that he that is not
tempted is not proved. Vyrgynyte is gold / your Cell is the furneys /
temptacyon is the fire / the devil is the kyndler and blower of this fire /
your body is the erthen vessel / wherein this gold is put to be proved. Which
vessel if it be broken by any vyolent fire / the gold is shed out and lost
/ and the vessel can never be repared and made hole again.

Vyrgynyte can not be get ne kept without great labor and pain.
Seeing yt chastyte and vyrgynyte be^ gifts of a spyrytuall grace of god and
nothy^ge of our merytes. For we can not be chaste or contynent / but if god give
it us by grace. Therefore they ben unworthy to have so noble a gift ye refuse
to take some labor and pain for it. They yt think to be chaste ymo^ges
delyces and deynte cherysshynges of ye body / they yt will be co^tynent where
great feestynge is and deynte fare / they ye fere not to be co^uersau^te
ymo^ges unchaste and ryotous persons / and not to be tempted for to be forced
with etynge and drinking and not to be defiled / to hyde fire in their bosom /
and not to be brent / they are sore dysceyued. For I think it very hard orels
inpossyble. Therefore beware ye be^ not dysceyued presumynge to much in these
things upon your own strength. For without great co^trycyon and afflyccyon of
the flesh and great help of gracce / true chastyte can another be get nor
kept. Remember yt glass is frail and may endure no dystresse. Also great
adue^tures many times do curs ye dyce. Therefore beware ye ioperde not to far
/ but evermore eschew ye occasyo^s of ill. For ye wise man says. Whosoever
loves peril he shall perysshe therein

Of the virtue of sadness.
SE yt ye be of sad behauyour / both i^ my^de and outward gesture. Keep
your my^de dylygently in sadness and give it all to spyrytuall exercyses /
sufferynge no vain thoughts to rest therein. And myghtely subdew ye
concupyscence and passions of ye body / as wrath / carnal love / bodily or
worldly fere / sensual joy / or dysolute laughing For ye can not be well
ordered outward / but if these ben ordered and well ruled inward / but yet ye
outward behauyour helps much to overcome these inward passions. And
therefore it behooves to keep wisely ye bodyly. v. wits yt ye shall se / here /
or touch / nothing yt should stir you to ill / or dysteyne good manners /
keep your sight close toward ye earth / co^syderynge ye the eye is a these /
and will betraye the soul if it be not warely kept. Fyxe not your sight upon
beawtefull things and here no vain ne vycyous coming / ferynge lest death
will enter in at your wyndowes and infecte your souls with sin.

Of sadness and dyscrecyon in speech and other behauyoure.
Most dylygently refrain your tongue and speak not without a reasonable
questyon be made unto you / orels wha^ ye ben constrained by euydent need / and
than study to give an answer brefely and mekely speaking with sad countenance /
reverence / and sweet fere of god / exchewynge always talky^ge and ye occasyons
of ye same / except it be of ghostly matters / and with right ghostly persons.
Speak nothy^ge but if it be semynge for ye time / place / and person. Myxte
your honest mirth with sadness / both in in speech / laughy^ge / and gesture of
body / without rownynge or casting ye sight toward any person suspectly without
lystynge or moeuynge of the heed or any other member vnsemyngely. Be gentle
without grutchy^ge. your countenance lowly and cherefull without frowning /
lowrynge or derysyon. Wha^ ye speak / lawgh / or smyle / se it be without
scornynge or loud voice. Be not to hasty nor to slow in your going. Show no
slouggysshnesse in in your resting. Inquyre not of other persons
co^uersacyons ne consider their defautes. Refourme ye is amys in other persons
without any reprouynge. Another praise ne dysprayse your self / nor greatly other
person. Speak nothing to be reputed holy or co^nynge. Give place to Ire
betymes and to the^ yt multyply words against you / and forgive shortly their
error or negligence. And thus ye shall keep ye virtue of sadness / and
dyscrecyon / which is is a great help to chastyte / and to all other virtues.
Where to saint Poule does moeue us / saying. Let your sadness be known to all
men. And so by good exemple ye may profit other and merit very much.

How refeccyon ought to be take.
AAs a seek man receives his medycyne / so take your bodyly refeccyon. A seek
man thy^kes his medycyne very bitter therefore he will take no more tha^ shall
suffyse for his health / and if he do / it may be to his hurt / so in likewise
considering the peril unto chastyte that is in meets and drynkes / they
should be bitter unto you / nothy^ge glad to take any more thanne should
sustain nature / ferynge by to much etynge and drinking for to give strength
unto your adversary / and to nourysshe your pryue enemy / increasynge sekenes
of the soul. Therefore when ye go unto your meet / think always upon your
chastye / ferynge lest the venym that is hydde^ in meet and drink do not
infecte the body with carnal lust or sloth. And so consequently the soul by
concupyscence and neclygence in the service of god. Saint Ierom techeth holy
vyrgynes wylleth that after they be^ passed chyldehood and growing aege they
should ete no flesh / ne drink no wine / except the time of sickness. And
commands that such sobrenesse should be kept in meet and drink that the
body should rather complain / than to rejoice in full appetyte / so that the
stomach should not need medycynes / for to cause degestyon / but so to break
the appetyte of the body / that it be not less apt unto watchy^ge / prayer /
study / or contemplacyon after the mele / than it was before. The wise man
Solomon says. I have determined with my self in mind to restrain my flesh
from wine. For this intent. That I might give my mind unto wisdom and
conynge / and eschew folly. Folly can not be avoided / nor godly wisdom
opteyned but by abstynence from much etynge and drinking. Therefore says our
sauyoure Christ. Take heed yt your hearts ben not accombered with Glotony.
Exemple we have of Danyell / Ananya / Mary / and Mysaell / children of great
abstynence. To whom our lord gave excellent wisdom and conning / so that
they exceded far all ye wise learned men in the kynkedome of Babylon. And all
that ever have had the grace of holy wisdom of devout contemplacyon / or
reuelacyon has come by it / by means of abstynence. And constrary. Much
etynge and drynky^ge have caused much sin and folly. As it appears of Noye
and Loath with other / and of ye rich Glotone in the gospel. Sewe not sensual
appetyte therefore to his full desire. So provide to your need / that ye may
swage hunger / and yet not satysfy your bodyly appetyte. Regard not the
deyntynesse of meets and drynkes / but nedely sustentacyon of the frail body
contynually decayenge. And beware ye voluptuousnes crepe not in under ye cloak
of need. Some there ben ye fere great abstynence or wat chynge / because of
sekenes or wekenes of body / ferynge to be not strong to serve god. And I fere
me many times it is but Excusatio in peccatis. For full few there be^ that have
that fervor or love to watch or to absteyne so much. And if they had for the
love of god. I think he would give them dyscrecyon withal / or otherwise
provide for them. I pray god it be not to much / that many think to little.
True dysercco^n is to prefer ye soul before the body / which can not be
without some pain of the body.

Of behauynge at the board.
Sit honestly at your meet. Give place to your better / both in order of
sitting and in first taking of your meet. Use no Jangling / tryflynge /
nor lyghtnes at ye board / and hate utterly detraccyon and backbytynge. Be
content with such as is set before you without grutchynge / and feed not of
to many dysshes nor to gredely. For in many meets says ye wise man ye can
not fail of sickness. And as ye feed ye body with bodyly fode / so feed ye
soul with ghostly fode / as by redynge of some wholesome and ghostly works wherein
your souls may be edyfyed / give dylygence to the herynge thereof with all
silence / your mind and intent set holy thereupon. And as ye se some great
estates of their charytable goodness will se some poor people be served before
them self. So in like wise ghostly / before every mele serve those poor
souls in purgatory that have leest help / with a pater noster and an aue
maria / before ye serve your own bodies. And ye shall deserve (I think) right
great mercy and reward of god therefore. Before ye ete any mete / lift up
your hearts deuoutely to god with laud and praise to him and say grace /
besechynge him to bless your meet and you / so yt the refeccyon which ye
shall take / may be to strength you in his service / not fery^ge the body to
rebel against the soul. After meet give thanks to god deuoutely with saying
grace / addy^ge at ye last end this little prayer. Deus det viuis gratiam:
defunctis misericordiam: ecclesie sue pacem: domino apostolico and nobis
peccatoribus vitam eternam. Amen. Whereto is granted. lxv. years of pardon.

How to be occupied after meet / and to beware of temptacyon.
AFter your dinner go to your work / study / or prayer as ye ben assygned to /
and do that dylygently / remembrynge always god and your good angel present
what soever ye do / and apply every thing that ye done reuete^tly to his
honor. Beware of ydelnesse and light manners / and forgete not your enemies of
the contrary behalf / which never rests / but full besyly labors
contynually to destroy your souls with right great craft and malice. Have them
al way suspecte in every thing yt ye shall do and think. And beware yt he
hyde him not ymonge your good works by vain glory / for thou he will make
them naught Sometime he will bring in good thughtes and purposes for an ill
intent / for to let a better thing / or for to inquyete the conscience. He
comes sometime easily / sometime feresely / sometime pryuely / sometime pertly.
And ye more ye flee fro him ye sorer he assayleth you. But what remedy? Truly
we have no strength nor polycy in regard to our adversary. Therefore let us not
trust in our self Our lord let him be our strength. Our good angels and
holy saints help and conforte to us. Let us therefore committee our self to
him / and call for help betymes in every temptacyon. Cleue stydfastly to his
love / with fere of his dyspleasure. Remembrynge what pain he suffered to
bring man into the state of grace. And therefore suffer not to be brought oue
thereof for a little short pleasure or for suffery^ge a little dyspleasure or a
short pain. It pleseth god very much / when any person auoydeth temptacyon
betymes / and falls to prayer and praysynge of god. For than ye thing yt the
devil had forged for man's great hurt / it turned upon his own heed with
co^fusyon. And ye person yt so resysteth / shall have double reward / both
for his vyctory and for his prayer unto god.

How to overcome temptacyon.
IF he be very ferce against you with te^ptacyon or trybulaco^n / how soever
grievous it be / dyspere not. Think there ben. xii. diverse hours in ye day /
they shall not be alyke unto you. Some good and some badde. Think how our
lord looks upon you to prove your stydfastnesse and manlynesse / for to gyye
you the larger crown of glory / and say with Tobe. If we have not taken good
things of the hand of god / why should we not take ill. And remember holy
saints that have be^ troubled so before. And mark it well that whom soever
god will vysyte with grace and consolacyons / him will he first prove in the
fire of trybulacyon. Therefore never give up to your adversary / ne grutche not
with the troubleous temptacyons / nor look tomoche of that that is laid to you
by temptacyon / but go forward about your good business / as though ye
dysdeyned to here of such things. Or else speak thus in your mind /
refourmynge your soul. Lo my soul / lo how ye devil knocks at thy gate. If
thou suffer him to come in / god thy strength shall go from the / and thou
shall perysshe with great mysery and suffer great pain and shame before god
and man. O thou frail body / all this wickedness proceeds of the. Beware
thou be not subject unto the devil. Consider how that god is present / to se
how thou shall fight with thine enemy Cry for help unto heaven / that they may
assyste us and put away our adversaries. Thou can not se them / and therefore
the battle is the more peryllous. Suffer and take upon the a little pain /
and think how pleasant thy vyctory shall be. And contrary if thou follow ye
short pleasure of thy temptacyon / eternal pain will follow. Therefore beware
/ and tha^ fall to prayer / and what soever ye devil speaks in you by
te^ptacyon / thy^ke it is not your word nor your doing / therefore care not
for it / but go forward / trusty^ge that as after great storms / comes fair
weder. So after great trybulacyon shall follow ghostly consolacyon.

How study or medytacyon in holy writing profyteth much against temptacyon.
FOr this cause I would ye should always fere trusting nothy^ge upon your own
strength but always suspecte your own fraylte / and as a done that fereth the
hawke does comunely use the river side / and as i^ a glass does spy in ye
water ye shadow of the hawke flyenge for to devour her / and so is aware of
her and saves her self. So I would ye should do. The ryuers or waters ben the
sentences of holy scripture / ye life of our savior Ihesu christ / and of other
holy saints. Which flowynge fro the most clear fountain of the dyuyne
wisdom does show and dyscouer ye subtle craft and falls suggestyo^ of our
enemy the devil / and techeth us how we shall be ware of him / for to escape his
danger. Nothing swageth co^cupyscence more / nothy^ge puts ill thoughts
away better / than with the study or medytacyon of ye word of god and holy
redynge. Unto ye which I would yt ye should so accustom your my^de and occupy
your hearts so there upon / that when ye go to bed ye might fall on sleep in
the thinking of some sentence of holy scryptures or saints lives and dream
of them in your sleep yt as soon as ye shall wake / they may cleue to your
memory. And therefore when ye be troubled or waked by the craft or yllusyon of
your enemy / beware of vain thoughts be times / avoiding all dullness of
body and mind. And occupy you thus orels in prayers.

Of meekness.
TAke this for a sure conclusyon / though chastyte be the very flower and
beauty of all virtues / yet without the ground of meekness it can not grow /
but it fades and vanyssheth away / as show against the son. Mekenes is the
fundacyon of all virtues / ye strength of the soul / the co^fusyon of our
great enemy the devil / a vessel of all grace / the mother of peace / the
resting place of the holy ghost. And pride contrary wise is beginning of all
sin and most wekenes of the soul / which expelled angel from heaven / and
man from paradyse. If ye joy in any thing / joy in our lord / and not for
that ye come of noble virtuous lyguage or of rich parents / nor for that ye
prefer pouerte before riches / nor for that ye have forsaken rich maryages /
but show by mekenes how nere you ben our meke spouse Christ / the more meke /
the more nere him ye be^. Beware that ye ben not proud of mekenes / but
despise your self / despise none other person. And set naught to be despised
/ but rather be glad. If ye will be ye spouse of Christ / which being most
rich in heaven / chose to be most poor in earth. He chose a poor mother / a
poor house to be borne in / where he was most honored in heaven. He came
hyder to take dyspytes / reproues / and great peynes mekely as a lamb.
Therefore follow this lamb as ye have known other vyrgynes do before where
soever ye go. And think that ye can never be to meke / co^syderynge what grace
comes always thereby.

Of obedyence.
IF ye have true meekness / ye shall repute every person your better / and
your self as a seruau^te or a hand maid / whatsoever degree ye be of.
Whereupon follow perfyte obedyence / which uneath god to man / and man to god in
perfyte charity. Saint Barnarde says If ye will be wise / be obedyent. For
thus it is wryte^. If thou coueytest wisdom / observe and do that is
commanded the / and god shall give it the. This obedyence must be observed
(not i^ seruyle fere) but with good affection of love and charity (not for fere
of pain) but for love of Justice. Obedyence is that virtue that graffeth all
other virtues in ye soul. It presecueth and keeps them surely after they ben
graffed. It is better than sacryfyce For by sacryfyce is given away the
temporal goods / and by obedyence is utterly left and forsaken the own
self will. Of our own will comes all sin. Than if we forsake our own will
/ resygnynge it to god and to our superyoure / we forsake all sin / for we
may do nothing but as they will. If they will no sin / we therefore being
obedyent / may do no sin. What is than more expedyent tha^ to have obedyence
(which had) we need to fere no peynes of hell. The order of obedience is
thus. It is more our duty to obey god than man / the superyour than the
inferyour / better to obey your own heed than a stranger. And it is specially
good to obey one to another / if it lets not the obedyence to the superyour.
A true obedye^cer is glad to be seruyseable un to every one of his company /
and sorry to be chargeable or comberous to them. Loving and gentle to all /
and devout unto god. The greater that person be that is dysobeyed the
greuoser is the inobedyence. The more easy the commandment be / the more
greuoser is the contempt. And if it fortune you to contempne the commandment
(as god forbydde) of your heed / beware in any wise ye contempne not the
remedy / which is meke penance / ready to be sorry with submyttynge of your
self to correccyon / falling to the fete of them whom ye offend. Note well
this saying of saint Barnarde. When my superyour (sythen he) commands me to
scyle^ce / if a word perchance escape thrughe neclygence or forgetynge my
self. I knowledge my self gylte of inobedye^ce venyally / but if wyttyngly and
with delyberacyon of a contempt / I break out into words / wylfully brekynge
the law of silence. I dyscerne and Judge my self a grievous sinner / and that
deedly and dampnably / if I perceyuer inpenytent unto my lives end. For Christ
says to them ye be^ rulers. Who that dyspyseth you / dyspyseth me. Therefore
keep well this virtue of obedyence unto god / and your superyour / and god
shall be obedyent unto your prayers and petycyons. And be always ready to obey
with a good will without any taryenge or delay / yt ye may say this verse
truly. Paratu^ cor meuz deus: paratu^ cormeu^. etc. My heart is ready good
lord / my heart is ready to obey in will and deed.

Of this virtue of pacyence.
When ye ben troubled with iniuryes / reproues / sclau^ders / with envy / or
malice against you / with loss of goods / or aduersyte and sickness.
Remember your self be times / before any passion of heaviness or inpacyence
ryseth in you / thinking they be^ the messangers of your spouse Ihesu Christ
send for your welthe / other to refourme your manners / or to prove your love /
whyder it be steadfast and faithful or not. And not only suffer them pacyently
/ but also gladly / as saint Poule did and many other holy men and women before
/ and consider it is but folly and vain to look for heaven with pleasure and
delytes / seeing that Christ our sovereign lord and spouse ascended not to
heaven / but by manly fight / with great pain and passion. And that it were no
right nor semynge / that the servant should stand in better condycyon tha^
his master. Better it is to take pacyently / that thing yt ye can not avoid
with hope of a good reward / tha^ to grutche with suerte of great punyssheme^t
And believe it truly that your adversary can not do you so much good / by no
favor / service or benefyte / as he does when he troubles you / if ye take
it pacyently / without grutche or malice against him. And thank god thereof / as
for a token of great love. Ye will ask me who can do thus. I answer? Every
person that is in ye state of grace / and will apply him self thereto
dylygently / as I suppose truly. Christ suffered death for us / leuynge to us
exemple (not only him self) but also many holy saints / that by their
exemple we should follow their steps. Exemple we have of saint Katheryne of
Seen being a child. When her fader and mother / bredren and systren were
set all to do her dyspleasure / and to trouble her holy mind / from her
ghostly purpose / she ordered and dysposed in her devout ymagynacyon / to
accept her fader as Christ / her mother as our lady / her dredren and systren
as ye apostles. And whatsoever was said or done to her by them / she took it
as it had been done of Christ / of his mother / or of his apostles / With meke
pacyence / glad obedyence / and lovely obseruau^ce / thrughe the which / she
deserved increace of much grace. Our lord also byddeth us to do good to them
that hate^ us / and promyseth us the kyngedome of heaven therefore.

The conclusyon.
When the day is almoost paste / wherein ye have tasted both sweet and sour /
yt is to say / ye have had sometime trybulacyon and sometime co^solacyon / both
spyrytually and te^porally. Tha^ turn unto your self / calling to
remembrance with dylygent search / how ye have expended yt day in every thing
yt ye have done or left undone / yt behooved you to have do / or yt became you
not to do / being sorry for every defaute / and bewail all yt is ill. For
though in ye morny^ge ye purposed for to forsake all ill / and for to exercise
good works / yet often times when ye remember your self well / ye shall find
yt ye have done many ylles / and few good things. Therefore in such causes
ordeyne and keep a chapter every day for your self. Be rygoryous upon your
own defautes / and let nothy^ge escape vncorrecte / if ye will yt god shall
spare you. Examyne how ye reason has be obedyent unto the feythe / and how she
has occupied her all day. Also how ye will has be ruled by reason / and kept
ye rules of gods commandments / and whether she has be to famylyer with
sensualyte. How ye sight / ye herynge / ye speech / with every cense and member
of ye body has be occupied every hour of the day / and in what place. The
ymagynacyon and memory with what and with whom they have been occupied. Se whether
the body have be remysse and slow in service / watchynge / study / or labor.
Search if ye mouth have spoken any vain / sturdy / or uncleanly words / yt
should offend other god or man. Or if ye can find any other excess against
good christian manners. Than bow down your heart and body mekely / and pray god
of forgyuenesse / submyttynge your self to his correccyon / and be glad to
take it in this life / and to do wylfull penance. There ben iij. exercyses of
ghostly health / which ben necessary for ever person to use daily. The. i. is
to know your self a sy^ner / and to be sorry for your sy^nes. The. ij. is to
purpose for to be ware of sin / and to forsake it for evermore. The iij. is
for to inte^de to be confessed of all your sins / and do penance for the
same. who soeuet before their sleep does these. iij. things / surely though
it behapped (as god forbid) yt he should dye suddenly / yet there is hope of
grace and salvation / though he were in deedly sin. After ye have made thus
recollacyon of your self / and gadered your defautes together / bind the^ in a
bu^dell and cast the^ in ye fire of hell / that is remembrynge the peynes
ordained for them / being sorry and in full purpose never to fall again. And
be more sorry for the offense of god / than for the damage that should follow
thereof to your self. Than after your prayers said / dress you toward your
bed with most honest manner / as though Christ your spouse were present. And
when ye be set in your bed / bless you with the sign of ye cross /
co^myttynge your body and soul unto your spouse Christ and to the keeping of
your good angel. Than lay you down reuere^tly with your arms a cross upon
your breest. Beware than dylygently of vain thoughts / and put away vain
temptacyons quyckly. Remember yt your enemy the devil slepeth not / and how
that god does se all your behauyour / both in mind and without forth.
Therefore use clenly manner with your self. And beware of carnal desires. Tender
not your body tomoche with soft and warm lyenge. Satysfy not your body in all
that it desires (if ye do) it shall put you in great ieopardy. If ye can not
sleep shortly after ye ben laid / occupy your self in psalms / orels upon
your beedes / and with the^ drive all fantysyes from your mind / except it
be occupied about holy things / by good medytacyon. So falling on sleep as I
have said before. Thus after the night be run unto matyns time / than rise
cherely / and begin to occupy the day again / after the counseyll before.
And as your rule does teache you and bind you / that ye may live here soberly
/ mekely / and justly in clennes of conscience / and hereafter obtain eternal
life / and joy without end / which our lord Ihesu grant us. Amen.
