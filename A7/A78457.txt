Comfortable News out of IRELAND.
THe woeful miseries which have too long afflicted the pleasant and plenteous
Kingdom of Ireland, have been a long time a Theme for discourse thorowout
Christendom, which having been neglected, since the present distractions in
England, how lamentable has been the face of all things in the said wretched
Ireland; every place abounding with fire, famine, sword, and all the ruins
incident to mortality; though, thanks be to the Divine mercy, we have lately
some better hopes that we shall at last respire from these calamities, by
reason God has been pleased, when this Kingdom, especially Munster, the best
peopled Province of that Island, and most faithful of the English government,
was most aflicted and oppressed by the rebellious Mutineers, till lately they
exalted with the constant success of their proceedings had drawn out of the
North, where the malice of the rebellion is pretty well spent into these Western
parts. Rory Mac Guir, brother to the Lord of Inniskillin, out of most desperate
inhumane and bloody of all the brood of Traitors, wherewith some two thousand,
or thereabout of his followers, well experienced in mischiefs and murders, by
coasting the Country, he arrived about the second of November last past, in
the County of Korke, where he immediately had the welcome given him by all the
Rebels in those parts, being at least eight thousand persons of the Lord
Muskrey his Forces, with those of the families of the O Caitys, O Connors, and
other of the Irish Septs or Tribes, which they preserve with as much integrity
and care as the ancient Jews did theirs: the Munster forces being under the
command of one Sir Turlogh Mac Henry O Carty, and Patricke Mac Philim O Connor,
the chief of those two avaritious families, men that had both served abroad in
Flanders in Tyrons Regiment, and therefore better experienced then ordinary in
Warlike rudiments. Their forces therefore conjoined in one body with those of
Kory Mac Guires, they made full ten thousand, with which forces, esteeming
themselves invincible; on they marched, thundering through the lands of the
English, burning up Villages, ravishing Wives and Virgins, killing old men and
children, nay sucking Infants were not protected by their innocence from their
violence; all was fish that came to net, their quarrel was national, nor
would they spare for any respects, any that had the least affinity with the
English in this bloody hostile manner they proceeded, till they were arrived
near Bandon Bridge, a handsome neat Colony of the English in the County of
Korke, which they intended with avaritious hopes to plunder, and then to set
fire off, and therefore through the woods with as much secrecy as possible,
they drew toward it, knowing that if they were discovered, the consequence of
that good town would engage all the English forces thereabouts, which indeed
was not very many, being some thousand of the veterane Munster Bands, under the
command of Sir John Paulet, a Gentleman of good extract and undaunted courage,
to whom, the fourth of November, the day before the fatal stroke was
stricken, joined the young Lord Inchequid a gallant Gentleman, faithful to the
English Crown, of valiant resolution, and of good and fortunate success in
his Military proceedings; with some three thousand foot of his own and my Lord
of Ormunds, and five hundred horse, being the best part of the strength of the
Cavalry in that Province; having notice by their Spies, of the silent march of
the Rebels, they instantly conceited their intentions, and so resolved, nothing
terrified with the report of their numbers, to set down on a Plain between
those woods (where the Rebels were) and Bandon, and there if they would come on
to give them b^ttell with as little noyfe as was possible; therefore they
entrenched themselves, cast up in their Front some slight brestworkes, and
planting conveniently among some very high Furs or Brakes their Ordnance,
which consisted of six indifferent good field Pieces, and some three or four
Sakers. Sir Turlogh Mac Henry O Carty with the Van of their forces, were
advanced out of the wood into the Plain, had notice from his Vaunt Currers,
that there were some English forces near at hand, but as they conjectured no
very considerable number, being at most not above three thousand, some
horsemen, with Sir John Paulets Regiment, lying so close among the Furs, that
they were not discernable, the whole Army of the English part, being not five
thousand men; but in resolve and herformance double the number.

Sr Turlogh having given notice to Rori and O Conner of these tidings, very
joyful they seemed and assured of victory, believing the secure English had no
knowledge of their arrival, and Rori according to the violence of the Rebels
disposition, would needs have the honor of the onset, with some two thousand
Horse; therefore he galloped in toward the English quarters, commanding and
desiring Turlegh and O Conner with their Foot Forces, to wheel about under the
covert of those high Firs, and when he was engaged in combat with their Front,
which they would make as strong as possible against his furious charge of
horse, they should then fall pell mell upon their quarters, and so enclose them
and cut them off every Mothers son. My Lord of Incequin in the mean perceiving
Roris approaches had placed his horsemen in their opposition, leaving their
Troops with a Muskettier to every horse; who as soon as Rori approached within
distance, let fly their fatal bullets, which galled him shrewdly in the head
of his Troops; they charging and discharging as fast as possibly they could,
till Rori was mingled with his horsemen among others, and after the discharging
their Petronels and Carabines either at other, wherein fell at least two
hundred of Rori's horse they came to handiblowes; Wherein our able men at Arms
did gallant execution on them with their swords. The Irish Skeins not cutting
with that vigor and edge that did our English Back-swords, our Musketeers then
recharg'd, sending another volly of lead into the Irish men's bosoms and Foot
Companies, now coming into the relief of our horse, gave Mac-Guire an
entertainment, which made his horsemen reele out of their order; but he
bringing fresh men on though he had at least 800 of his horsemen slain, the
poor garones running up and down the field without riders. Our men had much
ado to resist their fury, though my Lord Inchequin performed all the offices
of a resolute man and a wise Commander: When behold on the sudden Sir Turlegh O
Conner and the rest broke in on Sir John Pawlets quarter, where was the
Ordnance and a thousand more of resolute soldiers, who thinking to have
surprised our men were surprised themselves; the Field-peeces charged with
murdering shot, as Muskets and Pistol bullets, pelliting them down by heaps,
and our excellent firemen safe among the Firs, spending not one shot in vain;
yet the multitude of their numbers made them scarce sensible of their loss
till valiant Sir Sir John Paulet, Captain Robert Sandys with troops charged
them through while the Ordnance again charged, played hotly upon raking them
through and through their flanks, that their slaughter with the fall of Patrick
Macphelme O Conner, did so dishearten the Irish, that they turned their backs,
and in spite of Sr. Turloghs persuasions with nimble heels, sought to recover
the woods Rori Mac-Guire, between whom and my Lord of Inchequid, the fight
stood in equal terms; the Irish rather defending themselves with offending
us, perceiving the cowardly flight of his foot, giving them to a thousand
devils, turned his horse, and fled also toward the woods, then they were in
apparent rout, our men doing that, and plain execution upon both their horse
and foot, beating them down with the but end of their Muskets, and
slaughtering them as they deserved, without all mercy, especially the Munster
Rebels, of Sir Turloghs and O-Connors Regiment went to rack, scarcely a tenth
man escaping into the woods. There fell in all at least three thousand foot,
and some thousand horse, being the vere flower of the Rebels. O-Connor, and two
or three of the Cartys being the chief. Prisoners there were taken to the
number of seven hundred, or thereabouts, of which of most note, Brian
Mac-Henry, O Carty, Sir Turloghs eldest son, and half a dozen Friars, with
one of their Bishops, whom are in safe custody.

In Bandon we got good store of arms and pretty number of serviceable
Garroones: Rori MacGuire, with Master Turlogh and the rest of their forces,
fled by their known by-ways through the woods are reported to be retired into
Vlster. Of our side there were lost only 200. men, and never a one of mark or
quality, but a Lieutenant to Captain Sandys; so that we may perceive how easy
it were to quet the forces of these pertinacious and bloody rebels, were there
an unity in England between the King and the Parliament, which God in his mercy
send speedily to be effected, that the afflictons of us here may be considered:
And we have afforded some speedy and competent succors of men, money, and
horses, with which we should easily, not only defend and secure our selves,
but to reduce the whole kingdom to it is ancient obedience to the English
Crown.

FINIS.
