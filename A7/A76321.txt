Fancy.
IN a Melancholy Fancy out of my self,
Through the Welkin dance I:
All the world surveying,
No where staying,
like the Fairy Elfe:
Over the tops
of highest Mountains Skipping
Through the Fields
the Woods and Valleys tripping;
Over the Ocean Seas
without an Oar or Shipping,
Hallow my fancy, whither will thou go?
Answer.
Feel ye art led by thy Fancy, out of thy wits,
For any thing I can see,
Thou in thy fegary,
Still does vary,
ever in frantic fits:
What did thou see
when thou the Mountains skipped?
What did thou find
when thou the Valleys tripped?
Did thou ere pass the Seas,
and yet was never Shipped?
Hallow my mad brains whither will thou go?
Fancy.
Amid the clowdy Vapors fain would I see,
what be those burning tapors:
That so much affrights us,
And benight us,
and what those Meteors be:
Fain would I know
what is the roaring thunder?
And what those lightnings be
which cleave the clouds in sunder,
And what those Comets are,
whereat men gaze and wonder,
Hallow my fancy, whither will thou go?
Answer.
What have thou learned of the Vapors,
cold, moist, and dry:
Or of those glorious tapors,
That did never fright us, but delight us,
and so adorn the sky:
What can thou tell
of Meteors or of thunder,
Have not their legend
rend thy wits in sunder?
If Comets do appear,
thou art a fool to wonder,
Hallow my mad brains, whither will thou go?
Fancy.
Then did I look down below me,
where I was on high,
VVhither any one did know me,
The world was then a madding,
Running and gadding.
so I do pass them by:
He that is above, he that is above despises,
He that is below
does envy him that rises,
So every one his Plot,
and Counter-plot devises,
Hallow my fancy etc.
Answer.
WAs not thy fancy be falted;
when in the air
Thou were exalted when thou lookst below thee
Who it is that knows thee,
Or who do thou know there,
what did the world there,
Like thy fancy wander,
running at random,
Void of a Commander,
I think with thy disease,
some other thou do slander,
Hallow my mad brains whither will thou go?
Fancy.
See, see, what a buffling
now I do behold,
How they are justling,
Evermore turmoy^ing,
One another foyling,
none do their stations hold:
One sits musing,
in a dumpish passion:
Another is for Music,
mirth, and recreation:
Another hangs his head
because he is out of fashion;
Hallow my fancy whither will thou go.
Answer.
Was not thy fancy amazed
the world to see?
When thereon thou gazed:
Thy wits they fell a running,
Ever shunning
the steps of certainty:
There will be music
if thou use thy brains man,
And thou may have
thy labor for their pains man?
Of all thy fancies travels,
show me now thy gains man:
Hallow my mad brains, etc.
Fancy.
Ships, ships, ships, I descry now
passing the Main;
I Will go and try now,
How they are protecting
And projecting:
when they will return again?
Some go to keep
their Country from invading;
Some go to Sea
for Merchandise and trading:
And some to take the air,
(like Summer Cattle shading)
Hallow my fancy, etc.
Answer.
When thou surveyed the Ocean,
did thou perceive
The reason of its motion:
How it ebbs and flows,
And still moves,
did thou the cause conceive?
Know thou the mind
of every ships director:
Then thou art fit
to be some great Projector;
I think that of thy wits
thou scarcely are protector:
Hallow thou mad brains, etc.
Fancy.
Hollow my fancy, hallow
again to me:
I can no longer follow
Long time thou do fly me,
Still to try me,
will it no better be?
Come, come away,
leave off by lofty soaring,
Stay till at home
and on thy Books be poaring:
For they that god abroad
have still the less in storing,
Welcome my fancy home again to me.
Do for thy fancy rove now?
is she so wild:
That she will not endure now,
For to keep her standing,
At thy commanding,
but has thy hopes beguiled?
Take my advice,
and if thou can forsake her,
Never in thy whimsies,
thus thy Goddess make her:
But if she do return,
for recreation take her:
And welcome thy mad brains home, etc.
