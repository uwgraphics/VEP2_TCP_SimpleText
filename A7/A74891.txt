WILLIAM STEWART TO THE CHVRCH OF SCOTLAND.
Sonnet.
THou little Church, to whom Christ has restored
The clear lost light of his Evangell pure:
Thy God does with all diligence procure,
That with his word, thou may be still decor'd.
Though thou have long his wholesome truth abhorred,
Yet his great mercies did thy blindness cure,
Submitting thee, unto the careful cure,
Of such pastors, as truly teach his word.
Out of whose hands (what great thanks) now receive,
All David's Psalms, set forth in pleasant verse:
Agreater gift of them thou could not crave,
Whose endless fruit, my pen cannot rehearse:
For here thou have, for every accident
That may occur, a doctrine pertinent.
