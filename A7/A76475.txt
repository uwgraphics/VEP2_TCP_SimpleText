A LAMENTATION FOR THE Deceived People of the WORLD.

But in particular To them of Alesbury, and those small Villages round about
her; who are carried away captive by her Priests and Teachers, laden with sins,
ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth, nor never
will, but by owning the Light which comes from the Son of God, the Savior of
all them that believe in the Light, and the Condemnation of all that hate it.

The Leaders of my People causes them to err, and my People perish for lack
of knowledge, says the Lord. HEARKEN and Hear, O Inhabitants of Alesbury; And
to the small Villages round about thee: for thus says the Lord, Take up a
Lamentation for her, and lament her, in this the day of my power, says the
Lord; For I have measured thee, as I measured Sodom in the day of her
highness, and the same sin that I found in her, is found in thee, says the
Lord, pride, haughtiness, and fullness of bread, so that thou loathest the
honey and the honey comb; so that the voice of the Lord is not heard in thee,
through the greatness of thy pride and thy Idolatry: Oh how the Just is
oppressed as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves, through the
abominations and the witch craft which is committed in thee; therefore the
flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his
force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself, neither shall he stand which
handles the Bow, and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself,
neither shall he that rides the horse deliver himself, and he that is
courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, says the Lord;
They that have an ear to hear, let them hear.

Therefore Repent, Repent, oh Inhabitants, for the Vialls of the fierce wrath
of the Lord God, is to be powered out upon you, except you speedily Repent. The
days of Visitation are come, the days of recompense are come, Israel shall
know it; the Prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of
thine iniquity, and thy great hatred. Therefore I warn you all in the presence
of the dreadful God of heaven and earth, that ye repent and return unto the
Lord, in this the day of his power, for dreadful and terrible will he be to
all the workers of iniquity.

And now consider, and be thou warned, and bring forth fruits meet for
repentance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand, it is nigh you, its even at
the door. Therefore repent, repent, for the crooked way shall be made strait,
and the rough way shall be made smooth, and every valley shall be filled, and
every mountain and hill shall be brought low, that all flesh may see the
salvation of God. But this salvation, and this cry, has not entered into your
ears, who have refused the servants of the mosthigh God, which has been sent
often times unto you, with this cry in their mouths, but you have not regarded,
nor hearkened to the voice of the Lord, which has often times been declared
amongst you; and you have despised them that have been sent unto you, some of
them have been kept in your prison, and some have you smitten in your Market,
and others have bin stoned for reproving sin in your streets, and some you have
said had a Devil, when they have reproved you of sin: and now is this
Scripture fulfilled in your ears this day, where Christ said, They shall
persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil falsely against you, for my
names sake.

And here thou art found guilty in this the day of the Lord, and of his power,
which day makes thee manifest, and naked, and bare, before the Lord, who
searches the heart and tries the reins. And none of thy coverings will now
cover thee, in this the day of the Lord; if a profession would have served,
there is no lack of that in thee, but that will not stand in the dreadful day
of God, when thou must give an account for every idle word, and for every vain
thought, Then what will become of thy Profession? That is not (that) which will
stand when the Lord shall appear, they are all too narrow they will not cover
thee, but ye are all seen and comprehended by the children of light, in this
the day of his everlasting power: for you deny the light Christ Jesus, that
lights every man that comes into the world; and he that denies the light,
wherewith he is lighted, which shines in darkness, though the darkness
comprehends it not, which light checks and condemns all the deeds of darkness,
and all they which denies this, denies the way which leads unto life; This is
the strait and narrow way, and few there be that finds it.

And herein is the Scripture fulfilled, as it is written, There is none
righteous, no not one, there is none that understands, there is none that
seeks after God, they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
unprofitable, there is none that does good no not one, their throat is an open
Sepulcher, with their Tongues they have used deceit, the poison of Asps is
under their lips, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, they are
swift to shed blood, destruction and misery is in their ways, and the way of
peace they have not known, there is no fear of God before their eyes.

Hear ye sinners, and ye that live in pride and coveteousnesse, in the fashions
and customs of the world, in the Traditions of men, having men's persons in
admiration for advantage. And here you are all seen to be gone out of the way,
Priest and People, for the way of peace you cannot witness; but some of you
declared you have not peace, and others of you complain of a body of sin, and
you have no refuge to fly to, and so you are found naked, and your sin is not
covered, Who is wise and he shall understand these things, (prudent) and he
shall know them, for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk
in them, but the transgressors shall fall therein.

And the Prophet describes, Blessed are they whose iniquiti^s are forgiven,
and whose sins are covered; but your sins are not covered, therefore you appear
naked, and this blessedness is not known unto you: Therefore consider, are you
not out of the way which is pure, and undefiled, which no vulterous eye has
ever seen, nor no venomous beast has ever trodden in this path, but it is for
the ransomed and the redeemed of the Lord to walk therein, but redemption you
will not own, nor the path which is pure you know not; therefore you are found
in the way of Balacke, who offered sacrafices and burnt offerings to curse
Israel, whom God had blessed; and Jesabell when she had a purpose to destroy
Naboth, she caused a Fast, that her intention might be brought to pass,
nevertheless she had a day, and did not repent, He that has an ear to hear,
let him hear.

Thereefore I warn you all in the fear and dread of the Lord God to Repent of
these crimes which is found among you, for none of your coverings will cover
you in this the day of the Lord which is coming upon you, and upon all flesh,
for the glory of all flesh must be stained in the day of his power, your
Steeple-house worship will not hide you, nor your Baptist worship will not hide
you, your Independing will not cover you from the fierce wrath of the Lamb.

Therefore woe, woe, is me, how great is my Lamentation for you O Inhabitants,
where will you be, or with what will you be covered in this terrible day of the
Lord, which is coming upon you? For that day is a day of wrath, a day of
trouble and distress, a day of wastnesse and desolation, a day of darkness
and gloominesse, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of Trumpet and
Alarm against the fenced Cities, and against the high Towers. And I will bring
distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have
sinned against the Lord, and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their
flesh as the dung, neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver
them, in the day of the Lords wrath, but the whole Land shall be devoured by
the fire of his jealousy, for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them
that dwell in the Land, and a through search will the Lord God make in the
earth, and Jerusalem must be searched with candles, for the Lord God will
cleanse the Land of evil doers, and the Lord knows your manifold
Transgressions, and your mighty Sins, you afflict the Just, and ye take a
bribe, and ye turn aside the poor in the gate; therefore the prudent shall keep
silence in that time, for it is an evil time: Therefore whilst you have time
Repent, and seek good and not evil, that ye may live; and so the Lord, the God
of Hosts, shall be with you (as ye have spoken) and the light of Israel shall
be for a fire, and his holy one for a flame, and it shall burn and devour his
thorns and his briars in one day.

Therefore come down to the light of Christ Jesus, the light of Israel, which
shines in your consciences, which checks and condemns you, for all your deeds
of darkness, and brings to your remembrance all things that ever you have
done; is not this the Christ which was to come, and why do you look for
another? and there is no other, nor no other Name under heaven, whereby you may
be saved, but by this name Christ Jesus, the light of the world, and lights
every man which comes into the world, which suffered at Jerusalem without the
gate; this same Christ do we own, and witness him to be made manifest in us,
and to be made salvation to us, through the operation of his power and his
mighty work in us, which works in us both to will and to do, according to his
good pleasure.

And now consider in the coolness of your spirits, and come down to that of
God in you, which checks you when you do amiss, and shows you that you should
not do so: This is that grace of God, which has appeared to all men, which
brings salvation, which was always the Saints teacher, and we are taught by it,
as the Lord God has promised, and we need no more say, know the Lord, for we
all know him from the least to the greatest, and by his teaching we are taught
to deny all ungodliness and worldly lust, and to live soberly and righteously
in this present world. Therefore I exhort you all in the fear of the Lord, to
come down to this grace of God, which has appeared unto you, that you may
witness your teaching of God, and that will stand you in stead, when the Lord
God shall appear with ten thousand of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon
all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly
deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and all their hard speeches, which
ungodly sinners have spoken against him. And now while you have time prize it,
and slight not the day of your Visitation, least the day of the Lord come upon
you as a Thief in the night, and there be none to deliver you.

A Word to you who have set your selves as Heads and Teachers of this People.
YOu are all seen in this the day of the Lord, and are all comprehended by the
children of light, who walk in the light, that you are out of the strait and
narrow way, where there there is no variousnesse, nor shadow of turning,
neither to the right hand nor to the left, where no error is, and where none
can be deceived. For truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of
judgment, and of might, to declare unto you your transgressions and your sins:
The Heads thereof judge for reward, and the Priests thereof teach for hire, and
the Prophets thereof divine for money, yet will they lean upon the Lord and
say, is not the Lord amongst us? no evil can come upon us; But thus says the
Lord of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the Prophets, that Prophecy unto
you, that make you vain, they speak a vision of their own hearts, and not out
of the mouth of the Lord, they say still unto them that despise me, the Lord
has said ye shall have peace, and they say unto every one that walks after
the imaginations of his own heart, no evil shall fall upon you: and ye are
such Teachers that say you have a body of sin, and tell the people that they
must have sin, while they live in the world; and here you are made manifest,
that you have not received the Ministry of reconciliation, nor you know not
that which reconciles betwixt God and man, that which breaks down the partition
wall, and makes of twain one new man.

Therefore cease you Deceivers from deceiving the People, and stop your mouths
from blaspheming the name of the righteous God, till you have departed from
iniquity, for our God is a consuming fire, and he answers by fire. Therefore
you are of Babell, for you have been crying and professing these many years,
and your sins are standing, and your iniquity is not covered; Hear ye
perverters of Scripture, and teach men so to do, and where will you be
cleansed? will you have a Purgatory after death, as the Papist Priests and
Jesuits will have, if so we deny you, and all your Jesuiticall damnable
doctrine.

Woe unto you Deceivers, woe unto you Merchants of Babylon, that buy and sell
the Letter for money, woe and misery is your portion, except ye Repent, ye
devourers of Gods Inheritance* God will rule you with his rod of iron, and dash
you in pieces like a potters vessel, and there shall be none to deliver you,
for the day is come and coming, that they shall not buy your Merchandise any
more.

And so be you all warned Priests and People, and Repent, for I am clear of
your blood at this time in the presence of the dreadful God of heaven and
earth, who draws near unto Judgment.

From me who am a lover of souls, and the truth, as it is in Jesus: who am in
scorn called a Quaker, but am known to many by the name of Jeane Bettris.
