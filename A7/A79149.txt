royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
WHereas diverse lewd and wicked persons have of late risen in Rebellion in Our
Kingdom of Ireland, surprised diverse of Our Forts and Castles, possessed
themselves thereof, surprised some of Our Garrisons, possessed themselves of
some of Our Magazins of Arms and Munition, dispossessed many of Our good and
loyal Subjects of the British Nation and Protestants of their Houses and
Lands, robbed and spoiled many thousands of Our good Subjects of British
Nation, and Protestants of their goods, to great values, massacred multitudes
of them, imprisoned many others, and some who have the honor to serve Us as
Privy Councillors of that Our Kingdom: We therefore having taken the same
into Our Royal consideration, and abhorring the wicked disloyalty and
horrible acts committed by those persons, do hereby not only declare Our just
indignation thereof, but also do declare them and their Adherents, and
Abettors, and all those who shall hereafter join with them, or commit the like
acts on any of Our good Subjects in that Kingdom, to be Rebels and Traitors
against Our Royal Person, and enemies to Our Royal Crown of England and
Ireland.

And We do hereby strictly charge and command all those persons, who have so
presumed to rise in Arms against Us and Our Royal authority (which We cannot
otherwise interpret then Acts of high Rebellion and detestable disloyalty,
when therein they spoil and destroy Our good and Loyal Subjects of the
British nation, and Protestants) That they immediately lay down their Arms,
and forbear all further Acts of Hostility; wherein if they fail, We do let them
know, That We have authorized Our Justices of Ireland, and other Our chief
Governor or Governors, and General, or Lieutenant General of Our Army
there; And do hereby accordingly require and authorize them, and every of them,
to prosecute the said Rebels and Traitors with fire and sword, as persons who
by their high disloyalty against Us their lawful and undoubted King and
Sovereign, have made themselves unworthy of any mercy or favor, wherein Our
said Justices, or other chief Governor or Governors, and General or
Lieutenant General of Our said Army, shall be countenanced, and supported by
Us and by Our powerful succors of Our good Subjects of England and Scotland,
that so they may reduce to obedience those wicked disturbers of that Peace,
which by the blessing of God that Kingdom has so long and so happily enjoyed,
under the government of Our Royal Father and Us. And this Our Royal pleasure,
We do hereby require Our Justices, or other chief Governor or Governors of
that Our Kingdom of Ireland, to cause to be published and Proclaimed, in, and
thorowout Our said Kingdom of Ireland.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill, 1641.
