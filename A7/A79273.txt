C. R.
Most Reverend Father in God,
WE greet you well, being tender of our Engagement to have a care for the
reasonable satisfaction of the Tenants and Purchasers of Church Lands. Our Will
and Pleasure is, That you give Order to all Bishops, Deans and Chapters within
your Provinces: That in letting the Lands and Revenues belonging to the
respective Churches, they have regard to such as were Tenants before the late
Troubles: Where they have not parted with their Leases. Giving them not only
the privilege of preemption before any other, but using them with all favor
and kindness. And you are forthwith to give directions, that no such ancient
Tenant be put out of his possession, and that no Grant of Lease be made of
things purchased by any Officer or Soldier of the Army, and others, unless it
be to the Purchaser, or by his consent, until we take further Order, which we
shall do speedily, it being our intention to be careful of the Churches
Interest.

Given at our Court at White Hall the 13. of October. in the twelfth year of our
Reign. By His Majesty's Command. E. N.

To the Most Reverend Father in God Acceptus Archbishop of York.
