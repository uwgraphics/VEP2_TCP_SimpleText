AN ORDINANCE For Relief of Persons that have acted in the service of the
PARLIAMENT.
WHereas many good and necessary Acts, Ordinances and Orders of Parliament have
heretofore been made for the encouragement, Indemnity and saving harmless of
such persons as have in any sort either by Sea or Land Engaged, or Acted, or
Commanded to be done, any matter or thing whatsoever by Authority, or for the
service or benefit of the Parliament; And Committees having been appointed to
take care therein, And that Justice should be done accordingly, the Power of
which Committees being determined, and so no course settled for Parties
grieved, His Highness, having a continued and lively Sense of such men's
undertakings and hazards for the Service of the Public in times of eminent
danger and extremity, And being willing that full remedy should be provided for
their safety, Does, by and with the Consent and advice of His Council, Declare,
Establish and Ordain, That all and every the said Acts, Ordinances and Orders
of Parliament, and every Article, Clause and Sentence in them, or any of them
contained, shall stand, remain, and be in full force, effect and virtue, and be
put in practice and execution, and be pleadable and made use of in all Courts
of Justice, as fully and absolutely, to all intents and purposes, as if the
same had been now particularly made for such purpose.

And it is further Declared, Established and Ordained, That the words, Clauses
and sentences, in all and every the said Acts, Ordinances and Orders of
Parliament, shall be adjudged, expounded, and taken in all Courts and
proceedings of Justice, and else where, most beneficial and available, to all
and singular the Persons that have so Acted or done by Authority, or for the
Service or benefit of the Parliament; And if, upon any Trial or Proceedings, in
any Court of Justice, it shall appear unto the Judge, or Judges, before whom
such Trial or Proceeding shall be had or made, That the Party, that has so
acted by the Authority, or for the service or benefit of the Parliament, has
not had, or cannot have such full and just Relief therein, as by the said Acts,
Ordinances or Orders of Parliament was intended or provided, Then such Judge, or
Judges shall, and are hereby Required to make Certificate thereof to the Barous
of the Exchecquer, upon which Certificate, the said Barons, or any two of them,
shall have Authority, and are hereby Empowered, Authorized, and Required, upon
such Certificate and complaint of the party grieved, to proceed, and do therein
to all intents and purposes; And they have hereby given unto them the same and
like Powers. Authorities, Jurisdiction, and Course of proceeding, in all Causes
for relief of such party or parties grieved in the premises, as any Committee
or Commissioners of or for Indemptnity, appointed by Authority of Parliament,
had, or lawfully might have exercised.

And be it further Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That where any person,
that ought to have been Indempnified, by the true meaning of the said Acts and
Orders of Indemnity, has any Judgment or Verdict already obtained against
him at Law, for any matter or thing for which he ought so to have been
indempnified, by reason whereof he is disabled to plead his matter of
Indemnity before the said Judges, before mentioned, that then in every such
case, upon complaint exhibited before the said Barons of the Exchequer, setting
forth his case, and alleging such matter for his Indemnity, as that Court
shall Judge sufficient; and also give in such Security, as the said Barons
shall approve of, to pay Costs unto the party molested or drawn so in question
before the said Barons, in case he shall not prove the suggestion of his said
Complaint, The said Barons, in such special case, also may proceed to do
therein, for Indempnifying the said party grieved, as hereby they are
Authorized to do, upon the Certificate of the Judges before mentioned.

Provided always, That nothing in this Ordinance be Construed or understood to
revive the power of the said Committees in any the former Ordinances or Acts of
Parliament named, so as to enable the said Committees to intermedle in the
execution of any the said Acts or Ordinances.
