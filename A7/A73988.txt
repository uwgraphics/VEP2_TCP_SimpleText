By the King.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, finding that the Infection of the Plague is
at this present dispersed and scattered, as well into several Parishes of the
City of London, as into sundry other parts of the Kingdom, and now lately
come into several houses of the City of Westminster, some of them not far
from the place where the Courts of Justice are usually holden; And foreseeing,
that if the general resort, and concourse of people from all parts of the
Kingdom to Westminster, for the occasions of the next Term, should be
continued in the ordinary course, the same might be an occasion of further
dispersing the said Infection, as well in the said Cities of London and
Westminster, as in other places, especially in the Through-fare Towns, which
yet (by Gods mercy) stand free; And hoping that by the deferring and putting
off the business of the next Term of S. Michael, for some of the first
Returns thereof, and thereby keeping the Sick from the Whole, till the
coldness of the year come further on, may (by Gods blessing) be a good mean
to prevent the further spreading of that Contagion, whereby His Majesty, the
Queen, and Prince, may afterward with more safety come and abide at their
usual places of Residence and access, and His Subjects, as well for their
Suits in Law, as for their Trade and Commerce, resort to the said Cities of
London and Westminster, Is therefore of His especial favor and Princely
goodness, resolved to Adiourne the said Term of S. Michael, (That is to say)
in, and from the Vtas thereof, unto the fourth Return of the said Term,
called Mense Michaelis next coming, which his Majesty signifies to all his
loving Subjects of this his Realm, to the intent that they and every of them,
who have cause or commandment to appear in any of his Highness Courts at
Westminster, in, or at any day or time from and after the said Vtas of S.
Michael, may tarry at their dwellings, or where their business otherwise shall
lie, without resorting to any of the said Courts for that cause before the said
Return of Mense Michaelis next coming; And that without danger of forfeiture,
penalty, or contempt to be incurred toward his Majesty in that behalf.

And nevertheless His Majesty's pleasure is, that two of His Justices (that is
to say) of either Bench one, shall the first day of the said Term of S.
Michael, called Octabis Michaelis, according to the ancient order of the Laws
keep the Essoynes of the said Octabis Michaelis. At which Vtas of S. Michael
Writs of Adiournement shall be directed to the said Justices, giving them
authority to Adiourne the said Term of S. Michael from the Vtas thereof,
until the said fourth Return of Mense Michaelis (as aforesaid.) And the said
Adiournement shall be made in the first day of the said Vtas, commonly called
the day of Essoynes.

And further His Majesty's pleasure is, that all matters, Causes and Suites
depending in any of his other Courts, between party and party, as well in His
Highness Courts of Chancery, Starchamber and Exchequer, as in the Courts of
Wards and Liueries, Duchy of Lancaster, and Court of Requests shall have
continuance, and the parties shall have day from the date of these presents,
until the said fourth Return, as before is said.

Provided always, and His Majesty's Pleasure and Commandment is, That all
Collectors, Receivers, Sheriffs and other Accomptants, and all other persons
that should or ought to account or pay any sum or sums of money in any of
His Majesty's Courts of Exchequer, Court of Wards and Liueries, and of his
Duchy of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter into any Account in any of
the said Courts, shall repair unto the accustomed places at Westminster where
His Highness has appointed such Officers and Ministers, as for that purpose
His Majesty has thought expedient, and there to pay and do in every behalf,
as though no such Proclamation of Adiournement had been had or made.

And His Highness further pleasure and Commandment is, That all Sheriffs
shall return their Writts and Process against all such Accomptants and Debtors,
at the days therein appointed. And if any person or persons who ought to
Account or pay any sum or sums of money to His Majesty in any of the
Courts and places aforesaid, do make default therein, That then His Highness
Writts and Process shall be awarded against them, and duly served and Returned
by the Sheriffs and other Officers, as the same should have been if this
present Proclamation had not been made. And if any Sheriff or other Officer
shall make default, or be negligent in Serving, Executing, or Returning of any
the Writts or Process aforesaid, That then every such Sheriff and other
Officer shall incur such pains and penalties as by the said Courts, or any
of them shall be Taxed and Assessed; Willing and commanding all and every His
Majesty's Sheriffs, Officers, Ministers and Subjects to whom it does or shall
appertain to observe and keep their Assemblies and Apparances with all their
Returns and Certificates in His Highness said Courts at Westminster, in Mense
Michaelis next coming, then and there to be holden and kept, and there to do
their Offices and Duties in every behalf, in like manner and form, as they
should or ought to have done if this present Proclamation had not been had or
made, as thy will answer to the contrary at their perils.

And further His most Excellent Majesty, upon the same reasons, and out of the
same provident care to take away all other occasions of needless resort and
concourse in this time of danger, does hereby straightly charge and command that
no person or persons upon pretense of seeking help or Cure of the disease
commonly called The Kings Evil, do presume or attempt to come to His
Majesty's Court, or to the Cities of London or Westminster for that purpose
before Palm Sunday next coming, upon pain of His Majesty's high displeasure,
his Majesty hereby declaring himself, that his resolution is not to sit for
healing until after that day; And therefore his Majesty does further charge
and command all his Officers and Ministers to whom the same may appertain to
make stay of all such as shall be coming against this his Royal Commandment,
and return them back to the places from whence they came, with such condign
punishment for their misdemeanour, as they shall think fit.

And lastly, because his Majesty has observed, that diverse Noblemen, Knights,
and other persons of quality, have been accustomed toward the Winter season,
to give over their House keeping and hospitality in the Country where they
dwell, and to come up and live or soiourne at London or Westminster, or other
Cities and Towns; A thing which has been usually forbidden, not only in the
times of the late Queen ELIZABETH, and of his Majesty's Father (of blessed
memory,) but in the times of other his Royal Predecessors, and is of very
evil consequence, the Winter time being a time when the Country has most
need of their Residence and keeping amongst their Neighbors, and attending the
public Services and occasions thereof, but above all other times, is not to
be permitted in times of Infection and Dearth; His Majesty's express pleasure
and will is, and he does hereby straightly charge and command (for the reasons
and considerations aforesaid,) That they continue at their usual dwellings and
habitations in the Country for the Winter season now coming, without
remoouing themselves and their Families from the places of their abode to
London or Westminster, or other Cities and great Towns, saving that such as for
attending their Suits in Law, or other just cause shall be occasioned
thereunto, may come up to London or Westminster, leaving their Families in the
Country, and to return again thither after their business dispatched,
as well to avoid their own danger, as to be a comfort and relief to such of
their poor Neighbors as shall stand in need thereof; And if they have any
place of authority, (as being Justices of Peace, or other Officers) to take due
care as well for preventing the further spreading of the Plague, as to see that
the Markets be well served with Corn and provisions at reasonable Rates and
Prices: All which his Majesty straightly charge and commands to be duly
observed by all such whom the same shall any way concern, upon pain of his
Majesty's high displeasure, and of such further punishment, as by the Laws, or
his Majesty's Royal Prerogative may be inflicted upon them, for contemning or
disobeying this his Majesty's Commandment at their perils.

Given at his Majesty's Court at Wansted, the ninth day of September, 1630. in
the sixth year of his Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

Majesty: and by the Assigns of John Bill. M.DC.XXX.
