May 27. 1651.
FOr as much as the Inhabitants of Paul's Church yard are much disturbed by the
Soldiers and others, calling out to passingers, and examining them (though
they go peaceably and civilly along) and by playing at nine pinnes at
unseasonable hours; These are therefore to command all Soldiers and others
whom it may concern, that hereafter there shall be no examining and calling
out to persons that go peaceably on their way, unless they do approach their
Gaurds, and likewise to forbear playing at nine pinnes and other sports, from
the hour of nine of the clock in the evening, till six in the morning, that
so persons that are weak and indisposed to rest, may not be disturbed. Given
under our hands the day and year above written.

John Barkestead. Benjamin Blundell.
