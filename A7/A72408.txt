I would you never had said so,
To the tune of upon the Meddow brow.


TWo loving Friends once meeting
by chance upon the way:
In kindness gave each other,
the good time of the day:
And the one desired the other,
along with him to go:
The other denayd, and to him said,
I would you had not said so.
Being demanded why,
that he that wish desired?
Why sir quoth he my reason is,
because I am almost tired?
And are you tired quoth he,
it is more then I did know?
Then truly since with all my heart,
I would you had not said so.
But seeing you are weary,
now let us take repose:
Here let us sit and rest us,
and to you I Will disclose:
Some Vices in the Country,
amongst us daily grow:
If you will attend good Sir quoth he,
I would you had not said so.
For truly in the City,
from whence I came are more:
More hateful vices, name you one,
I Will name you half a score:
Is It possible (quoth he)
the City so should flow?
With Vice in such abundance,
I would you had not said so.
But now sir for the Country,
because I must begin?
I Will first speak of the Mizer,
that lump, that heap of sin:
This vrchin is a Farmer,
whom many men do know:
He scrapes and hoards the Devil and all
I would you had not said so.
Though Barnes and Racks be full,
though Chists be crammed with Coin:
And though he nothing wants,
yet must he needs purloyne:
His Tennants Rents heel raise,
his Neighbors heel undo:
By removing of their Land marks,
I would you had not said so.
And if a Neighbor has,
near him a pee^ of ground:
Heel never leave by right nor wrong,
till it to him be bound:
If true means cannot get it,
he then to Law will go:
And wrong a poor man for his own,
I would you had not said so.
The Second part.
To the same Tune.
THere are some in our Parrish,
that too much are to blame:
For in a year scarce once,
they to the Church ere came:
But does the Alehouse haunt,
and so themselves undo:
O Lord sure quoth the other again,
I would you had not said so.
O sir I could reveal quoth he,
of truths a number more:
Which shame makes me conceal,
but yet I grieve therefore:
For many do offend,
which hear I may not show:
Truly replide the other then,
I would you had not said so.
Then hear me (qv.) the Townesman
for fearelesse I Will begin:
Apparently to tell you,
now of the Cities sin:
There Is all the acts of Rogarie,
or ought that longs thereto:
Fore tend it quoth the Countryman,
I would you had not said so.
The Courtiers proud, and Lawyers,
does knauish cunning use:
The Trades man by his bying,
does many men abuse:
All the Informers are turned knaves,
they little good do do:
The Sargeants cruel, sir quoth he,
I would you had not said so.
The Broker in the Hundred takes:
good man but Four score:
His Conscience is so upright,
he will not ask for more:
The Bawd she will turn honest,
when whores she does forgo:
That will be never, sir quoth he,
I would you had not said so.
The Curtiz^us shall vertious prove,
when all their faults are fled:
And Punckes shall surely honest live,
when Panders all are dead:
The Taylour he ^^ll steal no more,
when he has no work to do:
He cannot then the other said,
I would you had not said so.
The Brother against his brother,
and Father against the Son:
The son against the Father goes,
till they are all undone:
And Wives against their Husbands,
do make to much a do:
Sir this quoth the other grieves me most,
I would you had not said so.
Most men so impious are,
that they devise all evils:
And in their dealings worser prove,
then do incarnate Devils,
The City Wives fantastic prove,
yet make a modest show:
Their wiles they will have the other said,
I would you had not said so.
Their Scycophanting Parrazites,
their Mistress humors smooth,
And eke the cheating vasse Decoy,
poor country men do sooth:
Till by their Cheating tricks,
they quite do them undo:
Quoth he this case is pitiful,
I would you had not said so.
Thus have you heard what news,
is now within the City:
How all do practice villainy,
without remorse or pity:
Let us now having rested,
upon our Journey go,
Where to, though loath he greed, yet said
I would you had not said so.
Trust me it is great pity,
to hear this bad report:
Of Country, and of City,
how all men do extort:
I would they would reform,
and think what is best to do:
That Countryman nor Citizen,
Might never against them say so.
FINIS.
