TWO MANIFESTO'S, OR DECLARATIONS; THE ONE By the King of Denmark, THE OTHER
By the Queen of Sweden, both concerning the present Wars.
CHRISTIAN the Fourth, by the Grace of God, of Denmark, Norway of the Goths
and Vandals, King; Duke of Holstein, Shleswigk, Stormarn and Ditmars, Count of
Oldenburg and Delmenhorst etc. To his Roman Imperial Majesty, all Christian
Kings and Princes; as also to all and every one, of what quality, degree and
dignity soever he be Greeting: Making withal known, how and in what manner
We (by an unexpected hostile invasion of the Swedish Army, under the command
and conduct of Fieldmarshall Leonhard Tostensohn, first into our Principalities
of Shleswigk, Holstein and Dominions belonging thereunto, and thereupon into
our Province of Iutland immediately belonging to our Crown of Denmark)
inevitably are compelled to put to the view of all and every one by this
Manifestoe, the Injustnesse of this wrong and action, and to the better
manifestation hereof, to draw in brief hither those Agreements, that have
been made betwixt our Kingdom and the Crown of Sweden, whereby not only all
Controversies are fully laid up, a perpetual peace concluded, but also, how in
future time, if any nighbourly errors should come to pass it should be
carried, was provided and agreed upon. Whereas now in the year 1560. when
Ericus King of Sweden, the 13th. of that Name, sought all manner of pretenses
against our Father King Frederick the Second of happy memory, and thereby gave
occasion to a long during bloody War, b^^ the same by the mediation of the
Emperor Maximilian, of the Kings of France and Poland, as also of the Elector
of Saxony in the year 1570. being composed, by their mediation the aforesaid
perpetual Peace was concluded, which both Kings, and their Successors and
Heirs, together with their Kingdoms, by their Royal Honor Faith and troth
should be bound to keep upon pain and forfeiture of a million of gold. It was
also agreed upon namely that, if so any errors should come to pass, the
decision thereof by the appointed Counselors of State of both sides, and if so
be they could not agree upon a final certain conclusion, because that one
side had as many voices as the other, it should be put to an Arbitratour; But
if so be that one of the Kings would not stand to all what was concluded, in
such a case the Counsel of State and the Subjects should be discharged of
their Oath and duty, and should not be bound to follow and obey the King so
long till he has consented to it, as appears at lage by the Copy Lit. A.
And the same agreement have been confirmed again anew betwixt Us and the
deceased King Gustavus Adolphus Lit. B. of happy memory in the year 1612. and
in the year 1624. some errors, which then would arise, by the appointed
Counselors of State were compounded and laid by. We have also thereupon kept
and maintained good and neighbourly correspondence with the aforesaid King
Gustavus Adolphus all the days of his life, and afterward with the modern
Queen and State, and We had no other opinion of the Crown of Sweden, but that
it would do the like. And it appears most clearly by that, that for those
many years together we have endeavored with much zeal and care to take off
from the same the heavy burden of war in the Roman Empire, and to settle the
same in Peace and tranquillity; Whereas, if any bad talentum or mistrust had
been in our heart against that Crown, We had justly suffered the same to ly
under such burden, and according to common practice Per vicinorum discordias
and bella, sought peace and security of our Kingdom and Dominions. But being
no contrary intention against the same, as also no ill suspicion of the same
sticked with us; So therefore no such Counsels could find place with Us, but
rather strived, to procure for the same a true and firm Peace as We can
testify with God and a pure conscience, that thereby we sought with an upright
heart and mind no prejudice to the same, but the good and welfare of both
contending and fighting parties. To which end also in the year 1629. presently
after the agreement betwixt the Roman Imperial Majesty and Us, We desired His
Imperial Majesty's consent of an amiable Treaty betwixt Him and the King of
Sweden, and how we have received thereupon a desired answer; and the King of
Sweden also thereupon accepted our interposition, and appointed a Diet at
Dantzigk in the beginning of the year 1630. where the Roman Imperial Majesty
had his Ambassador, a Burgrave of Donaw but no Treaty was taken in hand,
because no body appeared there in the name of the Crown of Sweden: However we
did therefore not suffer our good intention to sink, but caused presently
after the King of Swedens death the reassumption of so commendable work further
to be solicited, and desired of the Counsel of State, or rather of the
Rixchancellour Oxenstern, who was at that time Plenipotentiaerius in Germany,
who also according to his letter (Lit.C.) to our Counsel of State, bearing
date Collen on the Spree the fourth of Febr. 1633. accepted it with much
thanks, and that therefore the Crown and Princess was much obliged to us for
it, but especially at that time was feign to confess, that Our peaceable mind
about former commendable actions was more then enough known unto Him; And
repeated that same also afterward upon another occasion (as appears out of
the Extract (Lit.D.) to Us his Letters bearing Date at Franckeford the 17. of
May, in the same year. Afterward also We have sent Our Ambassador at great
charges to Breslaw, which Embassage has likewise been in vain and fruitless:
Then We urged still further the propounded Treaty for a happy Peace, till at
last after many teadious, long during and many times fruitless employed pains
and endeavor, We by Gods gracious permission brought it so far, that the
Potentates and Princes, that have interest in this so long continuing bloody
war in Germany, after a long and teadious Treaty fully agreed in
Praeliminaribus, and thereupon with the consent of all sides, a meeting for the
treaty of a general Peace was appointed to be at Osnabrugge. When the
Imperial and Swedish Ambassadors had already met there with Our Ambssadours,
the King of France also had given notice of the coming of His Ambassadors,
And the King of Spain also were near at hand, so that every one stood in good
hope, that now at last the long desired Treaty would go on, and produce some
prosperity and happiness by the reduction of a general Peace, and We in a
special manner directed only Our thoughts and Counsel that way* how by Gods
gracious assistance this work so well begun we might further and thereby
deserve thanks of whole Christendom, as Oxenstern himself in the above said
Extracts declares: Notwithstanding We were feign to see and hear with our
grief and sorrow, that upon a sudden the Swedes had all things overthrown
again. For when We, by reason of the alleged Agreement and Confederacy,
could expect no ill from them and to Our knowledge also have not offended them,
or if so be they had to pretend any offense, they should have turned it over to
the aforesaid, and oftentimes repeated, confirmed, and practiced Decisions and
agreements; yea, when they showed all love and amity toward Us, and had our
ordinary Resident with them, and theirs again with Us, and then further their
Ambassador appointed for the treaty of Peace, conferred almost daily with Our
Ambassadors as appointed Mediators, and pretended every where nothing else
but neighbourly love, peace and concord. Then they cause by their Generals (in
a hostile manner) Our Countries and Dominions about 60 leagues at length from
the utmost Frontiers of our Principalities to be invaded and taken, till they
may come into our Kingdom* which they then easily could perform, because We
feared no Hostility, but under the pretense of amity, with any foregoing
(being usual with all honest Nations) denouncing of war upon a sudden
surprised the Countries, that the Subjects saw them in the midst of them*
before they could hear any thing of their coming, so that for 30. leagues
together they found no man in arms excepting 50. men in a Fort near the East
Sea, which by night time they skaled, and took it, imprisoned the Governor
and detain him still. Yet in the mean time our Rix-Marshall in our absence
guarded our Frontiers with some horse, and for their defense began to raise a
Sconce, and withal sent a Letter to the abovesaid Swedish General to learn
and know the reasons and motives of such an invasion, and what further We had
to expect from him, as the Copy Sub Lit. E. shows more largely. But the
aforesaid General kept the Trumpeter that was sent with him, and left the
Letter unanswered, till he fell again upon a sudden without any forewarning
with his whole strength of horse and foot, and Artillery upon Our horse, and
drove them, (their number being much less then his) into the aforesaid Sconce,
where he presently begun to batter with his Cannon, the aforesaid Sconce being
not yet finished, and continued it for 4. days together. But when the rest of
his Infantry and the great Cannons that he expected came to him, he answered
the aforementioned Letter* wherein he imputed the reasons of his taking
quarters in Holstein and other neighbou ing Countries, to necessity, but that
he pursued the gathered troops, and without summoned the aforesaid Sconce; He
pretended to be for his own security, as sub Lit. F. is to be seen. And
being they lay only in garrison there some of the Trained Bands, and the same
also as aforesaid, was brought to no perfection, he took it presently, forced
the soldiers to lay down their arms, insomuch that whole Iutland he
ruinated, and wasted the Principalities with intollearable Contribution and
Plundering, and to pass by other enormites, Our Officers of the State and
Gentry he caused to be detained prisoners and showed themselves far worse
then Christian enemies: And it is easy, what of the aforesaid most
prejudicial and proud Letter may be judged and concluded; and moreover that by
this so hostile invasion and proceedings he aimed not merely at some
Provinces, nor at a mere recruting of the Army, which however he ought not to
seek in our Countries without Our consent, but rather that it is intended
merely out of a hostile proud and haughty purpose and hope, to destroy Us*
our Kingdoms, Countries and People.

The true and proper cause of this so hostile resolution against us, is as yet
unknown unto us, but we can easily guess, that the hate against us and the
envy to the flourishing peaceable condition of our Kingdoms and Countries
together with the modern occasion of their having in their hands a brave
German Army, and our security we have put in thire friendship, has
principally moved them thereunto: And we are assured* that not any other cause,
that according to all Divine and humane right is sufficient to such an
unforwarned hostility, can justly be produced. And though there were some, that
might have given them occasion to this spilling of blood, yet modus procedendi
can never be justified neither before God nor men. For the most high God has
no delight in the iustest and most necessary war. How should he then approve
of such unnecessary wars, whereunto no cause was given. And as he has sworn
by his truth, that he will bring the Covenant, upon which he has given his
hand, and afterward broken it, upon his own head: So without all doubt will
revenge in due time this uniustnesse and wrong, that has been done to
confederats and fellow members of the same says under the pretense of
Friendship, contrary to e^ected contracts, covenants and agreement; Neither
will it be approved by any man* that ever has loved honesty and virtue;
because according to the Laws and customs of all Nations, to a lawful war
not only weighty reasons, but also that the same, before they come to
extremities, be made kowne to the Adversary party are required. Which is
counted also so much seeming to the natural right and common equity, that the
adversary party has always been held dishonest and injust; especially when
by public contracts it is provided, that otherwise ought not be done. It may
be there will be pretended, that on the Swedish side, that what has passed
with thire ships in the sound, is alleged to be a lawful cause of this war
against us. But we do not doubt, when all impartial men do first know, how
to the arresting of the Swedish Ships by reason of so manifold kowne and
discovered deceitfullnesses, we have been compelled, and how far we have
procceded with particular merchants not de facto, but merely secundum
justitiae norman, that if there has been made complaint of the first sentence
that was given in the first instance, we our self (to testify the more our
desire to impartial justice, together with our Counsel of state) have
reassumed the hearing of the cause, that then no man for using our right will
condemn us; especially when by us in such a hearing, more was seen upon the
preservation of neighbourly friendship, then what the law required. Where now
for the staying and arresting of three, or at most four ships, so bloody a
war may presently begin amongst Christians, we let the whole world judge.
And principally by the rising of any grievances there; should have been
followed the way that is prescribed in the contracts and agreements; then, if
the matter had not been remedied, the way to extremities had yet still been
open: to which end our Counsel of State have sufficiently declared themselves,
and offered nothing else, but a firm peaceable intention, and that in the like
differences that should happen, the aforementioned ancient contracts and
agreements should be followed: albeit the aforesaid Swedish Government has no
weighty cause to complain: For no man almost in Europe is to be found that
has burned so much the Commerce with Tolls and customs and yet without right
and equity, which our Subjects by thire customs, which heretofore they have
laid at Dantzgik, in the Pillaw, and as yet take upon the east sea at Rostock
and in whole Pomerania have heavily felt, And though they had not the least
right to it, yet so sharp was therewith proceeded, that neither our own
proper goods, nor our Sons, though thire passes have been produced, have
been free of it. Which though it cannot be excused with any right, has become
a far greater and heavier grievance, which has dured these many years;
however for all that, we intended not to disturb further the Commonweal not
to occasion the spilling of more Christian blood; But in case the Swedes should
think, that by the proceeding in the sound against some few of thire Ships,
though not without right and equity, they had yet sufficient cause to this
war, surely every one would the more perceive our uprightness toward them,
considering that though in that way a far greater, and a far more
inexcusable cause to war by the aforenamed proceedings has been given to
us, and that the like opportunity, as they apprehended now, nor the brave
profers of those, that highly labored to draw us also into the play, we have
not wanted: notwithstanding we would neither this, not that, suffer to move
us, for to undertake any thing against Conscience Religion, Contracts and
agreements: whether also all that, what was lawful to the Swedes contrary to
the word of God and the natural equity, be not also permited to us, we would
feign know, wherein has sinned the reigning Duke of Holstein and the other
Dukes of the Sonderburgish line, which also neither the nigh consanguinity with
the Queen nor Communia Sacra could save. All this we must commit to God, who
is an enemy to all bloodthirsty and false hearts, but we doubt not at all but
that the whole impartial world will now easily judge, and clearly conclude out
of these inexcusable proceedings against us of the Swedish intention and
design of the modern war how falsely the defense and preservation of the
Protestant Religion as a final cause of thire taking up of arms, has hiterto
been pretended; when they make no conscience to fall out with us as a
Protestant Potentate without any neceessity, right and cause, and to ruinate
wholly our poor Subjects, that in whole Europe no Protestant King, Electour or
Prince may be free of mine. Whether now in such a way the Protestant Religion
be defended, or whether there be helped to the ruin thereof, I fear that all
Protestants will feel to late with thire own ruin and grief, yea that this
war is begune only for the ruin and perdition of the Protestants, whereas
hereby the neighboring Protestant Cities, Commons and Subjects are highly
prejudiced in trade and traffic, the already ruinated neighbors, which
hitherto have provided themselves again out of our Country with all
necessaries which had thire only refuge thither, will not little grieve. To
pass by* what hurt and damage this war by the total desolation of Germany
will bring to the Protestant Churches and Schools; In so much that Gods Holy
name also must be to the Swedes a cover for their falsehood and ill intentions.
But being our innocence appears sufficiently out of that, which has been
said above, and the Swedish Modus procedendi against us stands thus, that every
one of the neighbors may take an example thereof and provide in time for his
security, much less, these that afe in alliance with the said Crown, aid or
assist them as truly is said Adinjusta bella nulla est obligatio. For
confedracies admit always this exception, when a lawful cause is forced upon*
and first no fair accord finds place then not before they take their effect,
which both on the Swedish side is put aside, and they rather merely audendo
and bella ex bellis serendo think to grow great: And therefore thire
confederates ought to take the more heed, and not permit them, nor trust them
too much, lest forgetting all faithfulness and respect to Confederates, they
may not show them the same unfaithful and unneighbourly part, that they have
showed to Us and diverse others, especially being by such destructions of
Treaties of Peace not We alone, but also all Potentates and Princes, that
help to further them seriously, yea in general all Christian hearts, that
have abhorred the cruel spilling of blood, and miserable ruins of Countries,
which for so many years together have so miserably overwhelmed a great part of
Europe, and on the other side sought heartily and earnestly the re-establishing
of a happy general Peace, have been offended and hindered in their
commendable purpose. For now it is as clear as daylight, with what
earnestness and mind, the Crown of Sweden has hitherto desired a peace in
Germany, whereas not only themselves have disturbed the ensuing Treaty, but
besides began also a new war, without any just cause merely as haters of
peace, as also, that the Commerce and Trafficque, that hitherto in some manner
has yet been used in the East and West Sea* by these troubles and
distractions, is stopped and brought to confusion is only to be imputed and
ascribed to them as unruly and shameless authors thereof. We hope therefore,
that every one will seriously take to heart this unchristian and heathen-like
attempt, and be jealous of the blo d thirsty; and on the other side afford to
Us, (that have not only been hindered against Our will in the wholesome
purpose to turn off further shedding of Christian blood as also destruction
and desolation of Countries, but also without any forewarning have been in a
hostile manner subdued, surprised* and been robbed of Our own,) a helpful
hand, and their best assistance to recover the same again. And especially We
trust firmly, that the just and omnipotent God, who abhorres all Actions
breaking Covenants and Peace, will fatherly protect Us, and yet powerfully
maintain Us in that, what graciously He has bestowed upon Us.

Given at our City of Ottensea the 30. of Ian. 1644.
The Queen of Swedens Declaration or manifestoe concerning the invasion into
the Dominions of the King of Denmark.
CHRISTINA by the grace of God constituted Queen and hereditary Princess of
the Swedes, Goths and Vandalls, Great Princess of Finland, Duchess of
Ehesten and Careliae, Countess of Ingarmanlend etc. To all our trusty and well
beloved Nobility Gentry and Clergy, to all and every one in particular of our
trusty and well beloved Subjects and inhabitants in our Kingdom of Sweden,
Principalities of Finland, Liefland and Ingermanland Greeting. These are to
give you and all and every one of you graciously to understand, that for those
many years past we have seen, and could plainly perceive, how and in what
manner our, Neighbor the King of Denmarck in these heavy times contrary to our
friendly trust and confidence we put in him, has sought all occasions and
opportunities to hinder not only our expedition in Germany against our and the
Kingdoms professed enemies, and to stop the way for the attainng unto a good,
true and firm peace (albeit he has tried and offered sometimes both in words
and writing to persuade us the contrary,) but also especially has strived to
throw into our way many other roubles, in practicing our and our Native
Countries worst, as much as possibly he could do. For first during this German
war he has troubled both secretly and openly our Armies and out landish
affairs and always made our burden to us more heavy and troublesome, and
sometimes often with good words, sometimes also by force sought to put us out
of all our advantages, neither has omitted also to despise and defame us and
our Kingdom as much as possibly he could. Afterward in these latter times he
has openly stopped many of our Subjects, espepcially those, that used to have
shipping and trade through the Sound, and by unlawful staying and arresting of
of the Swedish shpis hindered thire living and trade, and besides also against
all equity imposed and charged our Subjects, in Liefland and Narva, that trade
in the West sea, with double, yea triple custom; But also upon some,
especially upon the transportation of such Swedish commodites, which he saw and
perceived, would increase the Trade and Merchandise, and make our Subjects to
prosper as namely ordnances, Lead, Arms, and the like; he has laid a
prohibition to take away thereby the workmanship here in our Native Country,
and to keep us and you under his subjection, Wherefore we truly perceiving a
secret war had just cause, according to our duty, wherewith in our high and
Royal office to our loyal Subjects for their defense and protection we are
bound to take upon us this unsufferable oppression, and thire grivance; But
considering the dangerous times and seasons of this age, we rather bore the
like injury and wrong, then that we should enter into any quarrel, or take up
arms against the King of Denmarck, persuading our selves, of two evil and
troublesome occasions; to be the best to suffer and bear it with silence, to
hope a good alteration, and mean while to seek that all misunderstandings and
grievances may be removed by friendly and peaceable means. And therefore some
few years past by way of our letters memorial, which we sent to Servant and
agent now resident in Denmarck have sought to prevent and remove the before said
grievances, but in stead thereof for those three years together, we had
returned unto us from him, nothing else but scornful words, and a denying
answer. Now in this last year past he went therewith so far and made it so
gross, that directly contrary to all neighbourly friendship, and confidence,
usual custom, and clear accords and decisions of the Kingdoms, as also
contrary to all Laws, Rights, and natural course and property of Trade,
without giving any warning to us and our Subjects, the Swedish ships and goods,
which arrived in the sound, and had their usual Certificats, as heretofore was
aggreed upon, not only two or three, but as many there have been of one and
the same value and were laden with costly wares, which (after that they were
forced to pay custom and Accyse of the Sweedish Goods contrary to the said
decisions and agreements of the Kingdoms. By the deanish serchers have been
searched with a number of indiscreete soldiers guarded, and carried up to
Coppenhagen, where afterward the letters and writings have been opened, torn
in pieces, and partly taken away; Chests and packs, broken and opened, and the
goods taken out and unladen; and when all that was done, the King of Denmark
made himself not only Judge over the Decisions and agreements of the
Kingdoms, but also appointed and put his other Servants to judge over it which
heretofore was neither usual, nor in any way agreeable with the aforesaid
inland agreements and Decisions much less ought We in our Royal Highness
and Kingdoms Right to, suffer and endure it, without the utter ruin and
destruction of you and all Our loyal Subjects.

And after that Our Subjects in such a manner have been detained and burdened
with unusual courses of law, the custom first of all was taken of them, and
afterward both Ship and Goods from them, and those, whom their own was
adjudged and declared free, have been arrested again anew, and guarded wi^h
the watch, yea at last also both their ships and goods were taken by force from
them. And albeit We (having seen him more and more to proceed with all manner
of enmity and hatred, together with new plots in his unjust purpose and
design, misusing the dangerous times of this age and especially the heavy
wars, where with We and our Native Country have been burdened, and that
all this is nothing else but an open wrong and injury) took to heart our
loyal Subjects wrong and their complaints, which they have made to Us about
it, and this last Summer past caused our loving Rix-Counsellours to dispatch
several Letters, as is usual to the Rix-Counsellours of Denmark, and therein
clearly showed them and intimated unto him the unjustnesse of the matter, and
that the like unjustnesse and wrong is contrary to the League, Decisions and
agreements of the Kingdoms, hoping and desiring that they would ponder and
consider rightly our reasons, and the nature of the cause it self, prevail so
far with their Master the King, and procure that to our innocent Subjects
which have suffered and endured such like considerable hindrances, and
intolerable losses, their Ships and goods might be restored without any
damage, Merchandising and trading be reduced to its former course; as also the
Decisions of the Kingdoms according to former custom, and as it ought to be,
may be inviolably kept, and maintained. But they returned Us not only a number
of vain excuses and groundless remonstrances, but besides also contrary to
all friendly neighbourly confidence, as also such pressing friendly visitation
with Letters* We were feign to perceive, and to understand really and indeed,
that the King of Denmark was not only not in the least way altered and changed
in his set thoughts* and evil design, to destroy and ruinate Us and our
Subjects but rather was hardened in his purpose, and augmented the grievances
and burdens more and more, dealt with Us and our Subjects in a more
despightfull and hostile way* as before, and thus actually dissolved all
neighbourly friendship league and agreements, which in ancient times have been
made betwixt the Kingdoms, which meanwhile ought to be observed, and He not
less* then We to maintain the same inviolably, seeking thereby to make unto
Us shipping and trading betwixt the East and West Sea so heavy and intricate,
that the same must fall of it self, to separate Us thereby from Commerce, and
Communication with the other Nations in the world, which God and Nature by way
of shipping has granted to Us, and to our dear native Country and Kingdom:
But principally to deprive Us and Crown the of our means, and our Subjects of
their living and increase, and to force Us and You to pay Tribute and Custom
to him, and that not according to equity, but as much as himself pleases, as
it has happened in these later years, seeking thereby to bring Us into such a
state and condition, that We may not enjoy the good, wherewith God has
blessed Us in our Kingdom, or make use of it for our^ and our native Countries
defense and increase. And if this should be longer suffered, not only shipping
and trading (without which our Kingdom cannot subsist) will be cut off from
Us, but also all Fishing, which Our Subjects use for their maintenance* by
raising of the Salt would be quite spoiled and brought to nothinng: As also all
sorts of Mines, Smiths forges, and many other trades, which have been erected
with our and the Crowns, as also many of Our Subjects, great and considerable
charges and costs, and are now in full use and practice, would perish and lay
wast. So many thousand men, that have undertaken it, and ventured all their
estates in it, thinking to seek thereby their trade and living, would be
brought to their utter ruin and destruction. Moreover, also We are certainly
informed, and know it sufficiently, in what manner he has had, and has yet
daily in hand many Plots and Conspiracies to stir up and entice more enemies
against Us and our native Country. Whereas now by these Designs and Plots of
the King of Denmark that have been laid by him, and are here rehearsed and
alleged, it does clearly appear, what he intended against Us and ous dear
native Country; So We (He having actually in such manner, and otherwise in
many other ways affronted Us, laid aside all respect to Us, to all Friendship,
League and Decisions of the Kingdoms, and We hereafter having nothing more
certain to expect from him then an open war) have been highly forced and
necessitated to let fall the respect and peaceable confidence, which hitherto
We have put in him, to commit our just cause to God, and to prosecute the same
against him, to take up arms for the maintenance of our Royal Highness, for
the defense of our native Country, and protection of Our Subjects, and to use
them with the help of the most high God, so long against him and the Kingdom
of Denmark, till he do accommodate himself to equity, and We can be secured
against further wrong, and We will not stay, that He according to his former
custom shall draw war upon suddenly and unawares. And therefore to the
furtherance of this our Christian and peaceable intention. We were feign to
cause Our and the Kingdoms Counselor, Fieldmarshall, Our trusty and
welbeloved Leonhard Torstenson, with our Army in Germany to come into His
Country and Principality of Holstein, and to take his Winter quarter there,
and to keep a watchful eye to his plots, hostile designs, and We on this
side with our Domestic Army to put our selves into such a Military posture
for the defense of the Kingdom, as the danger of the present times require,
and We could do, leaving all to God and complaining that We are forced and
necessitated to this quarrel, withal wishing, that God Almighty would turn
off from Us and you all misfortune, look upon our innocence, and most
graciously maintain and assist Our just cause.

And whereas We cannot think otherwise, but that this will be strange to
many, especially to those that heretofore heard either little or nothing of it,
or also are informed thereof perversely by some Adversaries; Wherefore We
thought it needful to disclose unto you Our loyal Subjects in general, the
condition and nature of the business by these Our gracious Lettets, and to
make it known unto you, withal graciously desiring, that ye as lo all
Subjects, and lovers of your native Country will rightly consider the
abovesaid and other reasons, and ponder them well, what has moved Us hereunto,
and We enevitably were forced to resolve to all that, against all perverse
persons, interpret them with a good opinion, and judge thereof rightly and
justly. And moreover, that you your selves will be pleased to take care for
your welfare and safety, that with an unanimous concord, and faithful
assistance, you do deprive Our enemies and Adversaries, which plot and
practice Our and your ruin, of all their courage and haughtiness, and cause
them to let fall their conceited hope, and scornful mind in seeking to hate
Us farther, and at last quite to oppress Us.

And whereas We make no doubt of God goodness, and liberal assistance; So
We will hope also, that if you (as We graciously expect from you) do
faithfully support Us in the Expedition of this great Cause, with all your
strength, valor and Concord, that We then with Gods gracious assistance shall
so much the sooner, and speedier, secure and free not only our native
Country, but also Us and you, all and every one of you from further unjust
extortion, wrong and injury of Our neighbors, which We strive highly for, and
spare no labor, care, pains and trouble for to attain thereunto; And your
faithfulness toward Us upon all occasions, We shall reward and recompense
you all, and every one of you, with all Royal graces and affections; And thus
We commit you, all and every one of you, into the gracious protection of God
Almighty. of Sweden.

In witness whereof We have confirmed this with Our Royal Signet, and the
Subscription of the respective Tutours and Administratours of the Kingdom
