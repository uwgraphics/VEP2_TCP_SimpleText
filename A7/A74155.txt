A PROHIBITION to all persons who have set up any Offices called by the names
of ADDRESSES, PUBLIC ADVICE, or INTELLIGENCE, Within the Cities of London and
Westminster, the Borough of Southwark, and three Miles about the same.
THese are to certify all persons whatsoever, whom it may any ways concern;
That whereas the late King Charles the 20 Day of December, in the 13 year of
his Reign did for himself his Heirs and Successors, grant one Indenture of
Lease under the Great Seal of England, to Captain Robert Innes his Executors,
Administrators, and Assigns, for the term of 41 years, of an Office then
called the Intelligence Office, of all kinds of Intelligence whatsoever, of all
Bargains, of things lost, or found, for helping Masters and Mistrisses to
Servants, and Servants to Services, And all other things of the like nature,
within the Cities of London and Westminster; The Borough of Southwark, and
three miles about the same, inhibiting and forbidding all other persons
whatsoever, from erecting any other Office or Offices, of the like nature,
without authority under the hand and Seal of the said Captain Robert Innes, or
his Assigns; And that notwithstanding the said Prohibition in the said Grant
is still in full force for diverse years yet to come; several persons without
any legal authority have, in diverse places of the Cities of London and
Westminster, and Borough of Southwark, set up several Offices of the like
nature, by the name of the Office of Addresses; And lately by the name of the
Office of public Advice; as appears by a printed paper printed by one Mr.
Thomas Newcomb, wherein (contrary to Law,) several persons have assumed a power
to themselves, of imposing rates upon the several particulars therein set forth
and expressed, whereas in the Lease granted to the said Captain Robert Innes,
it is left to the voluntary disposition of the persons addressing themselves to
the said Office what to give; which Grant amongst others was confirmed by an
Act of Parliament, bearing date the 29 day of January 1648: And also by an
Ordinance of his Highness the Lord Protector, with the advice and consent of
his Council, hearing date the 26 of December 1653; And the said Grant is now
exemplified under the Great Seal of England, in the name of his Highness the
Lord Protector, at the request of Oliver Williams, Assign to the said Captain
Robert Innes. Now whereas the legal right of the aforesaid Office is invested
in the said Oliver Williams his Executors, Administrators, and Assigns. He
does further certify all whom it shall or may concern, that he is resolved
with all possible speed to set up the said Office of Intelligence, in such
convenient places as may be for the better executing the power granted in the
said Letters Pattents, according to the true intent and meaning thereof; And
the said Oliver Williams by the power and authority therein granted and
confirmed, as aforesaid, does hereby require and prohibit all and every person
and persons whatsoever, that from henceforth neither they nor any of them
presume to set up any such Office or Offices, or shall any longer continue the
Office or Offices, set up as aforesaid, or to Officiate in the same, either by
the name of the Office of Addresses, Public Advice, or Intelligence, or any
other name whatsoever, for the performance of those things granted as
aforesaid, without sufficient Authority first obtained under the hand and Seal
of the aforesaid Oliver Williams or his Assigns, during the said term, As he or
they will answer the same at their peril,

Dated the 26 day of May, 1657. Oliver Williams.
