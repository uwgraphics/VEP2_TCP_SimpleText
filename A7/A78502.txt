Certamen Brittannicum, Gallico Hispanicum.
A True Relation of a conference holden between Charles Stuart King of Scots,
Don Lewis de Haro, and the Cardinal Mazarine the two Grande Favorites of the
Courts of France and Spain.
THE two State Favorites and grande Politicians of Europe Don Lewis de Haro and
Cardinal Mazarine the two public Ambassadors for the Kings of Spain and
France to manage the treaty of marriage between the said King of France and
the Infant of Spain, having according to former resolutions met on on the
borders of both Kingdoms, after many nicetyes satisfied, objections resolved,
and several ceremonious complements of respect past, they began to consult of
those things, the settling whereof was the foundation of their meeting: wherein
among other things, it fell into consideration, who should be included within
the articles of the peace to be concluded thereby and who debarred, amongst
whom the Cardinal desired that the King of Scots might be one in regard his
Master had (contrary to the Law of Nations, friendship and alliance) banished
him out of his Court and Kingdom: whereupon Don Lewis answered, there is the
more reason he should be taken in, for though his nearest kindred, who had
formerly been obliged to his Father, had forced him to retreat from among
them, yet seeing he had cast himself upon his Master, he should find he did
not rely on a broken reed, which while he trusted would run into his hand,
but that he would be to him as Castle of defense, wherein he might shelter him
from the injurious storms which undeservedly did threaten him, so that whether
or no he be nominally admitted by you it much matters, since he is an allye, a
friend and confederate of my masters, all whose allies must and shall be
necessarily included. Many days and much time being spent in these debates:
and notice thereof being brought to the King of Scots, he thought it very
convenient to go to the place of meeting, and there to make his application to
that noble person who had stood up so much for his interest, and having at last
attained to the end of his journey, (hoping to Crown this beginning of his
desires with success) he went privately to the Lord Don Lewis, who though
somewhat astonished at his sudden and unexpected arrival did yet nevertheless
treat him with many extraordinary civilityes, the usual testimonies of a
condiall affection, with promise in convenient time to procure a meeting
between themselves, and the Cardinal, in which they would consult what was
necessary, and what was fit to be done, whereby he should see, that no stone
should be unturned, if it might raise him an advantage or procure him an
assistance, so as he on his part, would not stand in his own light, and run
himself into a Dilemma, with too much obstinacy in some particulars, at which
time they parted with a reassurance of a future meeting suddenly.

According to his promise about the midst of September last past the Spanish
Grandee gained a meeting: where they after some respects (each reserving to
himself his own Grandezza, Don Lewis began; there has been, Sir, some
controversy between the Cardinal his Eminency and my self about your
interest, I judging it necessary that upon a conclusion of a peace between two
the most potent Princes of Europe, (a third being now distressed through the
malevolent dispositions of ill affected and rebellious subjects should not be
left out, whereunto the Cardinal replied, I confess it is a work of charity
and piety, but where the interest of the state whereof I am a subject, cannot
but suffer by such a concession, I must crave pardon: you know or at the least
have heard, how the King my Master was compelled to make a peace with the
English State, and upon what unequal term we gained the same, he left many of
his friends and kindred in the in the Lurch, and was glad to give Dunkirk and
some other places for the purchase thereof. He was particularly bound to banish
this noble person here present and never to aid or assist him, but to take all
persons, his friend, and allves to be our enemies, so that I cannot saluo
honor regiae majestatis, conclude any thing as to that point.

And does my Cosen truly (said the King of Scots) so highly prize his so dearly
bought peace: surely he cannot but know that the person with whom he made, it
was no better then a regicide, a person who washed his hands in the sacred
blood of his King, without any just or equal quarrel, for to him and his
villainous retinew all things were lawful that might any way serve their turn,
all their actions and passions how diverse and inconstant soever were in their
ambition swallowed up and thereinto converted, they forbear no manner of
murders, breach of faith and buying other men's fidelity, they esteem as a
virtue and think no place strong where an horse laden with gold may enter, not
any City or State unconquerable, where any of the greatest hope to be made
greater can loose the sense of other men's sorrow and subjection: pardon my
deviation, he that speaks of his own greifes, of his own troubles speaks
sensible: such then I say, were the men your Masters men, subjected himself
to: and I pray for what reason, why out of a spirit of revenge the one sought,
the other did conclude a peace, the first to satisfy his desire on the Prince
of Conde, the other that he might fulyll his cruelty toward me.

Truly said Don Lewis and that possibly might be the design of both; for I
know the King of Spain was tampered with, to the same purpose and when by
policy and undermining the effect could not be attained, then straight a war
was included with Spain, Jamarca seized on by violence, and Dunkirk with some
few other places stolen into by craft, but I really believe, that if they
should take a veiw of their Treasury and but reckon the men those
inconsiderable places have cost them, they would quickly find the blood and
treasure hugely to overbalance the worth thereof. For what advantage have
they gotten thereby for Jamaica is so poor a place, that without continual
fresh supplies the souldyary and people there must starve, and then observe but
the danger of bringing in provision, the place being wholly environed with
Islands under the King of Spaines dominion well fortified, well attended on by
ships and populously rich and the whole place will not countervaile either half
the danger or charge. And as for Dunkirk which they boast is the key into
Flanders, if they can make no better use thereof for the future, then they have
hitherto done, it may possibly prove to them mors in olla, a thing of so hard a
digestion that their greedy stomachs shall be forced to restore, let it be as
it will, quoth the Cardinll, we shall endeavor to hold out own and neither
meddle in the settling or unsetling Commonwealths or Kingdoms.

It Is well, answered the King of Scots, but you were I am sure of another mind
when you were banished out of France: but the wheel with you was quickly
round, thanks to your policy, and Machiavellian principles: but as to the maine
point for this is but beating about the bush, my desire is that as in this
happy treaty and conclusion of a peace, and a marriage, most of the Princes,
and states of Europe will have a share of happiness, I alone may not be set
aside: and I am very well assured, that if my condition (as being most
wrongfully expulsed out of my Fathers Kingdom and my lawful inheritance) were
but taken in among the rest of your friends, the very sense thereof would so
move other neighbor Princes and states, that they would suddenly turn their
many promises into actions, and instead of words aid me with Swords.

I must deal ingeniously with you, said Don Lewis, it is the intent of my
Master to take you in as an Ally and Friend: and I am sure having him, you
gain the whole house of Austria, who by reason of their great power and sway
in the Empire, (as having the Emperor of their kindred) command the chief and
greatest part of Europe: for by that means all the Catholic Princes there
will be assistant: and if you but weigh the alliance between these, the Dane,
the Pole, and several others, in the whole, it will be found that two third
parts of Europe will all follow.

I must confess replied the Cardinal, you have said much to the purpose, the
Leagues and Alliances you have spoken of are many and very strong, but most of
them will find business enough to defend themselves against the Swede and his
partakers, for though by the new League they may seem sorely to threaten him,
yet he is able by Himself and his Confederates (as he has done some years
already) to find them employment at home.

Indeed (retorted the King of Scots) I think your chief hopes is on the King of
Sweden, who if I be not mistaken, is in the League with your Eminencyes Master,
as also with my Enemies: but I hope (and something I have of confidence to
assure me thereof) that the Marquess of Brandenburgh (not to mention my Cosen
of the Palatanate) who is late joined with the Emperor and house of Austria,
will so pull his feathers, that on a sudden he shall not fly far abroad.

It may be so (answered the Cardinal) but now admitting all your hopes to be
certainties, they will little avail, for his Holiness is not at all thought
of: and with out all dispute he will go far in Italy: it is true, Italy is
divided into four parts, viz. Lumbardy, Tuscany, St. Peter's Patrimony; and the
Kingdom of Naples: In Lumbardy stand many rich Governments, as the Dukedom of
Millayne (which is my Masters) of Mantua, of Florence, and others of less
note: none of which you have mentioned; these together St. Peter's Patrimony,
and the State of Venice are all at his Holiness beck.

What then (answered Don Lewis) is not my Master the eldest son of the Church?
I am confident his Holiness will as soon bend toward him as the greatest. Is
not the Kingdom of Naples his? are not you to deliver him the Dukedom of
Millayne? Does not he keep a good Fleet of Galleyes at Otrauto continually,
which is the nearest passage from Italy into Greece to prevent any invasion
from the Turks: why then should he have less hopes of his Holiness then you.
And I dare presume that if his Majesty of Scotland here present will be but
reconciled to the Church of Rome, all difficulties will so easily be removed:
that he shall but ask and have Men, moneys, ammunition, Ships, and what not,
without the help or thanks of your Master, or his Friends who have already once
apostatized from him.

I must confess (answered the King of Scots) I would very willingly be
reinstated in my Kingdoms and would even give, forgive, grant or do any thing
even beyond expectation to be hoped from me to come to that happiness, but to
seek or gain them, and to loose or hazard my hopes of Heaven, I dare not, I
cannot, for I shall sooner choose to dye an exile from my native Country then
to banish or change the Religion I have been bred and born in for a settlement
there.

Alas (answered the Cardinal) what is your Religion but a new fangle, a thing
never thought of till Luther's time. I deny that (replied the King) for it is
the same in its purity which was professed in the primitive Church, so that it
is as old as Christianity at self: and all along has been upheld (but with
some mixtures I must confess) I need not say much herein, a great part of the
World are therein as well satisfied as my self.

Yea (replied Don Lewis) but you cannot show that it was ever openly preached
or professed till of late days.

I suppose (answered the King) your excellency in this point is misinformed,
what think you of the Waldenses, of John Wickliffe who openly preached and
upheld the same even in the public and famous University of Oxford, in the
time of King Edward the third of England, and favored by John of Gaunt Duke of
Lancaster, and other great men of that time: Were John Husse and Hierom of
Prague no body, who in defense thereof, both sacrificed their lives. It is
founded upon the word of God, and is the same which is taught in the Doctrine
of the Prophets: yea by Christ himself, and his Apostles, and is of greater
antiquity then that which is grounded but upon the decrees of counsels and
humane traditions: but I shall not argue any further thereof, for I am no
Prophet, nor no Prophets Son.

But quoth the Cardinal this obstinacy will never do you good: your Father
might have still been a King, or you his peaceful Successor, if he had not
been so resolutely bent in these points: And for this very cause, I take
exceptions against you: you know what Machiavell says, It matters not whether
a Prince have Religion or no, so he make a pretense thereof sufficient to serve
his own ends: you must learn to transform your self into any shape, for Qui
nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare. It is usually found in Counsels of State,
that the busy heads of a few do carry all the rest: And many times Men make a
surrender of their own judgments to him that has gotten a name by giving
happy directions in troubles forepast.

A fair Argument has your Eminency used (said the King) but I doubt hardly
sufficient to work on me: for I am like Antigonus (one of Alexanders Captains)
who was as good a Man of War, of as deep judgment, as high a spirit, and as
great undertaking as any of the rest, but his employment was less, which made
him less respected, but his thoughts were as high as theirs, for he valued
himself by his own worth, not by the opinion of others, in like manner, I
though at present kept an exile by those who ought to be my Subjects, have yet
nevertheless the thoughts of a King: for why may not the same providence that
cast me of, put me in again, Saepe redit pulsa nube serena dies.

In truth (said Don Lewis) your resolution is much to be commended, and
generally we find good success to be the reward of a well grounded patience,
and if you can with the contented mind of Socrates, conclude that every place
is the wise Man's Country, and all parts a Palace to a quiet mind, you will not
miss the reward of your patience, for Saepe premente Deo fert Deus alter opem.
And for my own part, I do here protest to your Majesty, that I shall in what I
may assist you, and that I will be earnest with the King of Spain my Master to
that purpose.

But I pray (quoth the Cardinal) let not your excellency be over hasty, for
since it has pleased the divine providence to bring the affairs of these two
great Crowns to so hopeful a period: I hope this shall not be any cause of
breach, and therefore shall rather honor this noble Prince with the title of
friend: Some of his evill-willers we have seen to fall, those that have risen
have waded through a Sea of blood: And those that now remain are ready to
destroy one another about parting the Stakes, I wish therefore the effects may
prove successful, and that the event of our conference may be a happy amen
toward his settlement.

Yet if you please (quoth Don Lewis to the King) I shall not advise you to
trust to the inconstancy of the French Nation: but rather that you will go to
the Court of Spain, where your retreat shall be warranted and safe, whereupon
after many congratulation^ on both sides at the present they parted.

This is the exact relation of the conference, as near as possibly could be
gathered, which for public satisfaction I have here made public, that the
World may see that that poor banished Prince the King of Scots is neither so
helpless nor freindless as many Men imagine.

Shortly after this conference ended, the King took his course directly for the
Court of Spain, where according to information from thence since received, he
is safely arrived, and with courtesy and humanity entertained.

FINIS.
