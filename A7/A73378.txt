TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR ROBERT KER of Ankerhome, Knight, Gentleman of his
Ma. Bedchamber.
Honorable Sir,
WHen the Lord was to give unto his people the Tables of the Law, the second
time, he commanded the people to stand at the foot of the Mount, Aaron, Nadab,
Exodus 24.2, 3, and 18.
and Abihu, and the seventy Elders of Jsrael, to worship a far off in the
middle of the Mount, and that Moses should ascend to the top of the Mount, and
enter within the cloud; These three represented very well the three estates of
the Church: they who stood at the foot of the Mount, resembled the Jewish
Church; Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and the seventy who ascended to the middle of
the Mount, resembled the Christian Church; and Moses who ascended to the top of
the Mount, and entered into the cloud, resembled the glorified Church; and the
Fathers say of those three, that the Jewish Church was in extimis, and and that
the Christian Church is in atrijs; and that the triumphant Church is in
intimis; that is, the Jewish Church was in the utter court; the Christian
Church is in the middle court, and that the glorified Church is in the inner
court. Let us make a comparison betwixt the Jewish Church standing at the foot
of the Mount, and the Christian Church which stands in the middle of the
Mount, and we shall see a great difference betwixt them two. First, let us
compare them in the Priesthood, Melchizedeck and Aaron. Heb. 7.3.
Melchisedeck had neither beginnng of his days, nor end of life, he was borne
before the flood, and none who lived after the flood could tell when he was
borne, and he lived five hundredth years after the flood; so that he seemed
neither to have beginning nor end of days; but the Priest who were after the
order of Aaron, behooved to deduce their genealogies, and of whom they were
descended, Nehem. 7.64.
or else they were secluded from the Priesthood. Eleaz. in Number. 4.
Secondly, the Hebrews say, when the Tabernacle removed, that Eleazar the
Priest carried the oil for the Lamps in his right hand, Luc. 4.8. and 28.45.
and the anointing oil in his left hand, the incense in his bosom, and the
meat offering upon his shoulder. Eleazar was but a figure of Jesus Christ the
Highpriest in the Christian Church, who gives grace, Ioh. 1.16. Revel. 8.3. 1
Timot 2.5. Ephesians. 5.26. 1 Cor. 5.7.
the oil of the Spirit, for the understanding of the Scriptures, who puts
the odours of sweet incense to our prayers; and lastly, he presents the
Church as a pure meate-offering to his Father. Next let us compare the people
under the Law with these under the Gospel; first, their rites were carnal
rites, consisting in these, touch not, taste not, handle not, and even as
Fathers forbid their little children to eat of such and such things, or handle
them not, they specially restrain their basest senses; but when their sons
are come to maturity and age, they forbid them to hearken unto evil, or look
unto evil, they restrain their noble senses especially; so because the Jews
were but infants, he trained the^ up this way, forbidding them to touch, taste,
or handle, but he forbids the Christian Church, things of greater moment;
again, let us compare them them in holiness; under the Law, holiness was
written but upon the forehead of the Highpriest, but under the Gospel, the
Prophet Zachariah says, that holiness shall be written upon the horse
bridles, to signify the great measure of holiness that should be in the
Church under the Gospel. Thirdly, compare them in the measure of their love;
under the Law every seventh year they were to let their land rest, and to
pardon their debtors, and to give a full remission to them: but see how far
the Gospel exceeds the Law in this, Peter asked of Christ if he should
pardon his brother seven times, as the Jews pardoned their debtors the seventh
year; what answered Christ to him? thou shall not pardon seven times, nor
seven times seven times, but seventy times seven times; and as far as the
Iubile exceeded the seventh year, as far shall your charity exceed the
Iubile, that is. to seventy times seven times. Fourthly, compare them in the
measure of their knowledge; their measure of knowledge under the Law was very
small, all things were covered and wrapped up to them, when they carried, the
brazen Altar in the Wilderness, Numb. 4.13.
they covered it with a purple cloth. When they carried the Arc, it was
covered with three coverings, with a veil, Badgers skins, Numb. 4 6.
and a cloth wholly of blew. So the table of the Shewbread had three
coverings, all was covered save only the Laver, and Moses face was covered to
them with a veil, when he came from the Mount; the Priests bare the things
which they might not see, To signify a concealing of a part of the mysteries
of the Gospel, afterward to be revealed; Coloss. 1.26.
so the people saw but through a grate, Heb. 9.1.
but now the Temple of God is opened in the heaven, and there is seen in his
Temple the Arc of the Testament; they stood a far off, Revel. 11.19.
things which are hid and obscure, are said by the Hebrews to be far off,
Deuteronomy. 30.14.
and things which are clear and manifest, are said to be near at hand; thus we
see how far the Gospel exceeds the Law; but yet we are not to vilify and
count basely of those ceremonies, for the holy Ghost has registered the least
instrument and the basest things in the Sanctuary, and David gave to Solomon a
pattern of the table, Candlestick, Lamps, flesh-hookes and bowls, 1 Chronicles.
28.11, 17. It may be said perhaps that they had some use then, 2 Cot. 5.10.
but old things are past away, and all things are become new, what use then can
they have in the Church now; they have no use for signification now in the
Church, or to fore-shadow things to come, seeing Christ the Body himself is
come; yet they have many other good uses, first, we should delight to look
back to see the antiquity of them, for even as men delight to behold the
clothes and Armor of their predecessors which they wore long ago; So should
we delight to see the clothes in which Christ was wrapped in his infancy, and
the Cradle in which Christ lay. Secondly, this should teach us to be thankful
to God, that we have so clear a light under the Gospel, which they had not
under the Law; it was a great benefit to learning, when the obscure
Hieroglyphics in Egypt were changed into letters, and the dark and mystical
writings of Plato, were changed by Aristotle into a clear and plain form of
writing; far greater is the benefit that the Church has now, when the Lord
has changed these figures and ceremonies into the clear light of the Gospel.
Thirdly, these do let us see that God will perform the rest of his promises
as he has fulfilled all these types already, and lastly, they let us see the
miserable estate of the Jews, who cleave still to these ceremonies as yet.
Hierom compares the Jews before Christ came into the world, to these that
eat the flesh, and he compared Christians under the Gospel, to those who eat
the marrow, but he compares the Jews after they had rejected Christ to the
dogs who gnaw the bones, cleaving only to the killing letter, but not
seeking to Jesus Christ the quickening Spirit. And now Sir, I dedicate this part
of my labors to you, that it may remain a note of my thankfulness for your
favors to me. I know Sir, that ye will make better use of it, then most men in
these days do with such Treatises, casting them by, and rather read any
trifle, than that which conduces to the informing of the soul to Godward,
yea preaching it self they are weary of, except perhaps some new man's odd
elocution invite them for a fit, but by and by they look after a new strain,
as it were for new fashions of clothes. But I know Sir your breeding craveth
another thing of you, who was bred up under so wise and religious a mother, who
for the educatio^ of her children, was another Monica, as your self and your
virtuous sister, Mistress Katherine, are sufficient proofs. I cannot pass by
her name upon this occasion, whose life and death was to mean instruction. Good
cause have you to keep that method, as ye have begun it in your eldest
son, so to prosecute the same with your many hopeful children which GOD has
given you by your Noble match, which is one of the best borne Ladies of this
Land, who dignifieth her birth by her Christian, humble, and godly life. Sir,
believe me that godliness is more true Honor to you than your birth, although
you be never so well descended, and to be more esteemed, than the place which
ye have about our Gracious King, and more than all moral virtues whatsoever,
which are but splendida peccata, without piety; your Honor and worldly credit
are but trifles compared to this, they cannot keep a man alive in this world,
nor do him any good in the world to come, Eccles. 12.^3.
for this is the whole man, this makes up a complete man, and he is but the
shadow of a man that wants this: Psalm. 34.7.
The Angels of the Lord pitch round about them that fear him, and deliver
them, and has any man in this Court gotten more remarkable deliverances than
you have, I am sure ye will not let these benefits of the Lord slip out of your
mind, read often the sixty two Psalm, Heb. 12.20.
and meditate upon it. The God of peace that brought again from the dead, our
Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the
everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will,
working in you that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory for ever and ever. Now, for these my labors, if they serve for
any Christian use in the Church, I am satisfied, and that I may do so, I
humbly pray to God, and shall still for your prosperity,

Your Honors still to be commanded in the Lord, John Weemes.

Additions.
Page 171, the Lord gave his people the moral Law and the ceremonies; and the
Gospel; when the ceremonial Law was given, it derogated nothing from the
moral Law, there was nothing abrogated or changed in the first Law, or
subrogated in place of the moral Law, but when the Gospel came in, the
ceremonies were abrogated, et superinducta est spes melior.

Page 137, 35.

Some Laws are natural and ceremonial, some are judicial and ceremonial,
and some are mere ceremonial; natural and ceremonial, where the ground of
the Law is natural, and the ceremony annexed, the ceremony being taken away
the natural part may stand. Example, the father was bound to give his son a
double portion, because he was his strength, and because he was a type of
Christ; take away the type, the moral part stands. So where the Law is
Judicial and ceremonial. Example, Cities of refuge were appointed to save the
mankiller, and he was to abide there until the death of the Highpriest; take
away this ceremony, and Cities of refuge may remain. Thirdly, where the law is
ceremonial and Judicial, a Magistrate cannot make the ceremonial part, a
part of the Judicial; Example, this was a judicial and ceremonial Law, that
the malefactor should be hanged upon a tree, and that he should be cut down
before the night, because he defiled the land, a magistrate may cause hang a
thief now, but he cannot cause hang him as accursed or not suffer him to hang
all night, because he defiled the Land.

EXERCITATIONS DIVINE. Of the Ceremonial Laws which are annexed to the
Commandments in the first and second Tables.
EXERCITAT. I. Of the reducing of the Ceremonies of the Law in general unto
the Commandments.
THe Apostle Paul wills Timothy to hold fast the form of sound words which
he had heard of him, (...) proprie capsule in ^uibus singula monetarum genera
ordine certo disponunt ut in promptu singula habeant cum opus fuerit.
2 Timothy 1.13. In the Syriack it is, Hhora foramina, a speech borrowed from
Merchants who have several boxes or holes wherein they put their several
sorts of Money. So should Divines have proper places of reference to which they
should refer their several heads. Amongst the rest it is not the least skill
to refer the Ceremonies of the Law rightly, to their own commandments, and
digest them in their several places.

Thomas. 1:2. quest. 101. Art. 4.
The Schoolmen divide the ceremonies in four sorts, in sacrificia, sacramenta,
sacra, and observantias, In Sacrifices, Sacraments, holy things, as the place,
the time of their worship, etc. and ordinances which they did observe, although
all the ceremonies may be rereduced to these four heads, yet we must follow
another order, and reduce them to the Commandments.

First, some ceremonies cannot be reduced to one Commandment, Some ceremonies
belong to all the Commandments.
but they belong to them all, as to wear fringes upon their garments, is a
ceremony that cannot be referred to one Commandment, because it served for
the keeping of all the Commandments, Number. 15.39. And it shall be unto you for
a fringe, that ye may look upon it and remember all the Commandments. So
Deuteronomy. 21.23. He that is hanged is accursed of God, this ceremony belongs to
all the Commandments, as the Apostle applies it to the breach of the whole
Commandments, Gal. 3.10. and 13.

Some ceremonies belong to two Commandments.
Secondly, some ceremonies belong to two Commandments, as the purification of a
woman after her childbirth, is a ceremonial Law which signifies that they
did conceive their children in original sin, and therefore had need to be
purged and purified after their birth. Now because original sin is condemned
in the first and last Commandment, therefore this ceremonial Law is annexed
to them both: original sin is condemned in these two Commandments, for in the
other commandments where the full consent and act of sin is forbidden, it is
not forbidden.

Thirdly, some ceremonies, in diverse respects, Some ceremonies in diverse
respects belong to diverse commandments.
may be referred to diverse Commandments, as Levit. 17.14. Ye shall eat the
blood of no manner of flesh; as they were to abstain from blood in reverence
of the blood of Christ, which was to be shed for them, then it belongs to the
second Commandment, as the rest of the significative ceremonies; but as they
were to abstain from blood because the life was in it, it was cruelty to eat
it, and in that respect it belonged to the sixth Commandment.

So Number. 18.21. and 24. and behold I have given the children of Levi all the
tenth in Israel for an inheritance. Now as the priests gathered the tithes, and
received them from the people for serving at the Altar, it was a duty required
of them in the second Commandment; therefore it is said, the tenth shall be
theirs for their service which they serve, even the service of the Tabernacle
of the Congregation; but as the people paid these Tithes to the Priests, it is
a duty required in the fifth Commandment, to honor them.

So Deuteronomy. 21.17. He shall give the first borne a double portion of all that he
has, This ceremonial Law, as the eldest son was a type of Christ, is a
duty of the second Commandment, to give him the double portion; but as he was
his fathers first borne, to keep the families distinguished, that they should
not be confounded in the Tribes, it is a duty required in the fifth
Commandment; because parents should provide for their children.

Lastly, these ceremonies generally for the most part are referred to the
second Commandment.

Ceremonies belonging to the first Commandment. EXERCITAT. II. Of the
purification of the woman after her childbirth.
Luke 2.22. And when the days of her purification according to the Law of
Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the
Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male that opens the
womb, shall be called holy to the Lord) and to offer a sacrifice, according to
that which is said in the Law of the Lord, a pair of Turtle Doves, or two
young Pigeons.
How this ceremonial Law pertains to the first Commandment.
IT may seem strange to some, how this ceremonial Law should belong to the
first Commandment; but this is not strange; for our conception in sin is
condemned in the Commandments; but it is not condemned in any of the
Commandments where the act and full deliberation of the mind is forbidden;
therefore the negative part is especially condemned in the last Commandment,
and the affirmative is commanded in the first Commandment, which requires the
purity of our nature, that we may love the Lord with all our heart; and so the
child must crave pardon for his sin, Psalm. 51.5. and the mother here must
offer her sacrifice for her self and her child.

Two sorts of uncleanenesse, the greater and the ^^sser.
The mother when she conceived and bare a female, she was unclean in her great
uncleanness seventeene days, and in her less uncleanness she was unclean
threescore and six days, Levit. 12.4.

When she conceived and bare a male she was unclean in her great uncleanness
seven days, and she was in her less uncleanness thirty three days. Ver. 5.

The reason why she was longer unclean when she bare a female, than when she
bare a male, The reason why the mother was longer unclean when she bare a
female than when she bare a male.
was not moral, because the woman sinned first and not the man; but the reason
of this is natural, because the male is sooner quickened in his mothers belly,
and mooveth more quickly by reason of the greater heat, and dries up sooner
the humidities than the female does; the female again is more slowly quickened
by reason of the greater cold and humiditie, and therefore the mother had a
longer time prescribed to her for her purification.

The mother when she was purified, The mother offered for her self and her
child when she was purified.
she was to offer a sacrifice for herself and her child.

Some hold that she was to offer a sacrifice for herself, and not for her
child; and therefore they read the words this ways, When the days of her
purification are fulfilled for a son or for a daughter; she shall bring a
lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, etc. But the Text seems rather
to be read this ways, When the days of her purification are fulfilled; for a
son or for a daughter she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt
offering. Mary offered a sacrifice for herself and for her son.
And the practice of Mary the Virgin confirms this, that day that she was
purified she brought a pair of Turtle Doves, or two young Pigeons, and
offered them to the Lord for herself and for her child.

Luke 2.22. Cum impleti essent dies (...) and when the days of her
purification were fulfilled, and not of their purification.

phrase, and so it is in the Syriack, for the Hebrews put the plural number
for the singular, The Hebrews put the plural number for the singular, and the
singular for the plural often times.
as Iud. 12.17. He was buried in the Cities of David, that is, in one of the
Cities of David, so Matthew. 27.44. the Thieves railed upon him, that is, one of
the Thieves railed upon him, So Jonas 1.5. he went down into the sides of the
ship, that is, to one of the sides, So Psalm. 1.3. A tree planted by the rivers
of waters, that is, one of the rivers. So likewise they put the singular number
for the plural number as here, the days of her purification, The child was
unclean as long as the mother was unclean.
for the days of her and his purification. For so long as the mother was
unclean, the child who sucked her was also unclean; and Christ who was subject
to the Law, although there was no moral uncleanness in him, yet he was
legally unclean all this time, until his mother was purified, and this
serves for our great comfort, that he became unclean legally, to take away
our moral uncleanness.





Mary offered a sacrifice for her purification, seeing she conceived not her
child in original sin, and this sacrifice was appointed as a remedy against
original sin?



Elisha when he cured the unsavory waters of Jericho did cast salt into the
spring of the waters, 2 King. 2.21. So we must crave of God, that he would
first purge the bitter root of original sin, before he come to purge our
other sins. David craved pardon of the Lord for this sin, Psalm 51.5.

EXERCITAT. III. Of the place of Gods worship. A ceremonial appendix of
Commandment II.
Deuteronomy. 12.5. But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all
your Tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek,
and thither shall ye come.
THe places which served for the worship of God, Places for worship approved or
commanded by God.
were either places commanded by God, or approved by him: places commanded, as
the Tabernacle and Temple, places approved by God, was their Synagogues and
places of prayer; their Synagogues, Psalm. 74, 8. they have burnt up all the
Synagogues of God in the land, their place of prayer was called (...), in the
Syriack, Domus orationis, a house of prayer, Act. 16.13. And on the Sabbath day
we went out of the City by a river where prayer was wont to be made.

The Tabernacle and Temple were Loci ut sic, Locus ut locus ut sic.

as the Schoolmen speak; their Synagogues and (...) houses of prayer, were
but Loci ut loci, therefore they might not sacrifice in them, but when they
worshipped in them, they turned always their faces toward the Temple.

The Tabernacle which was the first place commanded for the worship of God, was
a type of heaven, Psalm. 15.1. Lord who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle, and when
they could not have access to the Tabernacle, they thought themselves but like
the wandering Arabians, (...) appellative hic sumitur a (...) protraxit, we
read not that Daevid ever dwelt in the tents of Ke^ar therefore it should be
translated, as in Kedar.
that knew not God nor his worship, Psalm. 120.5. Woe is me that I sojourne so
long, dwelling as in the Tents of Kedar.

This Tabernacle was divided in three parts, the holiest of all, the holy
place, and the court of the people.

The holiest of all signified heaven, the second place signified the state of
the old Law where the Priests entered in daily and offered for themselves and
the people, and the court of the people signified the Church here below.

The people might not come into the court of the Priests.
The people might not come into the holiest of all; but Esaias 56.7. My house
shall be called the house of prayer, he applies this both to the Jews and
Gentiles, which Christ applies to the Jews only in the Temple of Jerusalem,
and the Prophet speaks in prototype, as Christ in type: the Proselytes might
not come into the court of the Israelites, they stood but in Atrio Gentium, in
the court of the people, but Esaias foretells that the Gentiles shall have as
free access to the house of God, as the Jews, because his house is the house
of prayer, and this Solomon foretold, 1 King. 8.41. If a stranger come from a
far country to call upon thy name, then hear thou in heaven, that is, grant
that they may have as great access to thee as the Jews have.

When Herod built the Temple, he wrote an inscription upon the gate of the
court of Israel, that no stranger should enter in there under the pain of
death; but now this inscription is changed, that whatsoever stranger he be that
does not enter into the house of the Lord, shall dye the death: before, The
Levites might not go into the holy place.
the people might not enter into the court of the Priest; but now we are all
Kings and priests to God, 1 Pet. 2.9. before, the Levites might enter where the
people might not go, they might go into the court of the Priests, but not
into the holy place; but now all the people are the Lords Levites, Mal. 2.8.
(...) appellative hic sumitur quia habet praefixum.
Ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts. Levi here
is put for the whole people, and therefore they have as great access now as
the Priests had. Before, none might enter into the holiest of all, but the High
priest once in the year, Heb. 9.7. but now all have access to the throne of
grace, Heb 4.16. Romans 5.2.

The Tabernacle and the Temple were alike in many things, first in the form, A
comparisen betwixt the Tabernacle and Temple.
for the Tabernacle was a pattern to the Temple.

Again there was no light in the holiest of all in the Tabernacle; In what
things they were alike.
So neither in the holiest of all in the Temple, and the signification was
this, Rev. 21.23. and the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon,
How the Lord is said to dwell in a cloud.
to shine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the
light thereof. In the holiest of all there was no light, and the High priest
when he entered into it kindled smoke, and he saw nothing, because the Lord
dwells in a cloud, Psalm 18.11. he was not able to behold the shecina or glory
that dwelt in the holiest there was no external light that came there, but the
Lamb was the light, and when we shall be glorified we shall not see that
inaccessible light in which he dwells.

So in the holiest both in the Tabernacle and temple there was no light but the
light of the Candlestick, no light in the Temple but that which the lamp gave.
for there were no windows in the Temple to give light to it, and it was
compassed round about with Chambers that it could have no light.

Sam. 3.3. And ere the lamp of God went out in the Temple of the Lord where
the Ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep. Then it may seem
that they had other light, than the light of the candlestick.

Before the lamp of God went out, that is, before the lamps were changed by
the Priests, and new lights added; and the signification of this was, the
Church should be directed by no light but by the light of the Word, 2 Pet.
1.19. We have also a more sure word of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well that
ye take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day
dawne, and the day star arise in your hearts.

The Court of the Priests was not covered.
There was a court for the Priests both in the Tabernacle and Temple, and it was
not covered above, to signify, that the Church here, has more of the light of
nature than of the light of grace,

Again, the Tabernacle and Temple had the like implements both in the Holiest,
and Holiest of all.

And last, the Tabernacle and the Temple served for the same use for Gods
worship.

In what things the Tabernacle and Temple differed
Now let us see wherein they differed. First, the Tabernacle was moveable, and
the other was fixed; the moveable Tabernacle signified our estate and condition
here, and the Temple which was unmovable signified our estate in future glory.

The Tabernacle had not the court of the Gentiles.
Secondly, the Temple was much more large than the Tabernacle; the Tabernacle
had not the court of the Gentiles as the temple had, there was but one golden
candlestick in the Tabernacle, and ten in the Temple, 1 King. 7.49. So in the
Tabernacle was but one brazen Laver, and in the Temple there were ten: so there
were but two Cherubims in the Tabernacle, but four in the Temple.

Lastly, the Tabernacle endured not so long as the Temple did; and when the
Tabernacle had no use, it was laid up in the Temple.

The Conclusion of this is,

EXERCITAT. IIII. Of the Arc. A Ceremonial Appendix of Command 2.
Exodus 25.17. And thou shall make a Mercy seat of pure Gold, etc. verse. 22.
and there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the
Mercy seat, betwixt the two Cherubims which are upon the Arc of the Testimony.
THe Arc was that place from which the Lord gave his answers to his people,
The diverse names given to the Arc. (...) adytum quasi Oraculum vel loquutorium
dictum quod deus indo responsa daret.
and therefore it is called Debhir, his speaking place, 1 King. 6.23. and it
was a type of Christ, by whom God speaks to his Church, and it was called his
strength, Psalm. 132.8. and 78.61. and his glory, 1 Samuel 4.20. and the King of
Glory, Psalm. 24.7. and the place of the soles of his feet, Esaias. 43.7. and his
footestoole, Psalm. 99.5.

the place of the soles of his feet, and his glory?

Romans 10.15. much more all that is in him is beautiful and glorious.

The Arc called the propitiatory.
The Arc is called the propitiatory, Romans 3.25. 1 Ioh. 2.2. which covers our
sins, and it covers the Tables of the Law that it should not rise up
against us to condemn us, (...) divinitas, gloria divina inter homines
habitans a (...) habitare.
Shecina, or the majesty of God dwelt upon this Arc, it was called shecina,
from Shacan, habitare, and it signified Christ dwelling with men, Reve. 21.3.
Zach. 2.10.

The Cherubims stood upon the mercieseat with their faces looking downward
toward the propitiatory, and Peter alludeth to this, 1 Pet. 1.12. which things
the Angels desire to look unto, Why the Cherubims looked downward.
the Angels look down to the propitiatory, but they look not one toward
another; For then they should have had their faces toward shecina, the
glorious majesty which they could not endure to behold; and here is our
comfort, that we may behold God in Christ, when the veil of his flesh is put
betwixt us and him to cover his majesty, for otherwise he were a consuming
fire and we could not behold him.

The Lord commanded them to bow before the Arc, The people were commanded to
worship before the Arc.
and to worship at his footestoole, Psalm. 99.5. the reason was; because the
divine majesty dwelt there.

The Lord dwelt in the cloud, in the pillar of fire, in the rock, and in the
bush, Deuteronomy. 33.16. for the good will of him who dwelt in the bush. So the Lord
is with his sacrament, so the Lord appeared in majesty, and so he dwelt
amongst us in the flesh here. They were not to bow before him when he appeared
in his types, as in the cloud, in the bush, and in the fire; neither when he
manifests himself in his Sacraments, They worshipped before the Arc because
the glory of the Lord dwells there.
but when he manifested himself in the flesh, and united our nature
hypostatically to his Godhead, here we are to worship him: and so when he
appeared in glory and majesty above the Arc betwixt the Cherubims, they were
bound to worship him, and when he appeared in the Temple, Esaias. 6.

The Lord had a threefold Arc, first, A threefold Arc
a fluctuant Arc, as that Arc of Noah. Secondly, an ambulatory Arc which was
the Arc in the Wilderness, and before the Temple was builded, and thirdly,
the fixed Arc in the Temple.

The fluctuant Arc of Noah signified the tossed and troubled estate of the
Church in the world here, (...) What the Arc of Noah signified.
it is represented also by the ship in which Christ and his Apostles were; this
ship was mightily tossed, and Christ was sleeping in the meanetime in the ship,
the Disciples cried out and bad Christ awake, for they were ready to perish,
and Christ awoke and calmed the storm; the fluctuant Arc is like the Church
tossed to and fro, and Christ in the mean time seems to be sleeping, yet he
has a care that the bark perish not.

The second Arc was that which Moses made, (...) arca
and it was the ambulatory Arc, this Arc remained in the Tabernacle from the
days of Moses until the days of Eli, The places whereunto the Arc was
carried after it was separated from the Tabernacle.
and then they brought it out against the Philistims, where it was taken by
them, 1 Samuel 4.11. After that the Philistims had taken it, they carried it to
their five Cities, Ashdod, Gath, Ekron, Eskalon and Gaza, 1 Samuel 5. and there
it remained in the country of the Philistims seven months, 1 Samuel 6.1. but
when the Lord plagued them, they sent it away upon a new cart to Bethshem^sh,
but the Lord smote the men of Bethshemesh also, because they looked into the
Arc, therefore they sent for the men of Keriath-jearim to fetch the Arc, So
they brought it to Keriath-jearim where it remained in the house of Aminadab,
in the hill, 1 Samuel 7.1. and from them it was carried into the house of
Obed-Edom the Gittite, 1 Chronicles. 13. and from thence to David's house at
Jerusalem, where he made a Tent for it, the Arc was never in Gibea, for that
was in the Tribe of Benjamin; neither did Aminadab dwell in Gibea, but
Kiriath-jearim, which was in the Tribe of Judah; this error that it was in Gibea
arose of this because they translated gibhgna, (...) mons, appellative hic
sumitur and non proprie.
Gibea, a proper name, whereas it should be translated A hill, appellative, and
Aminadab dwelt in this hill, 2 Samuel 6, 2.3.

The Arc is said to rest in the Temple.
The third Arc was Salomons Arc which he settled in the Temple of Jerusalem,
the same in substance, but wandering before; it had more Cherubims than it had
when it was in the Tabernacle, there were but two Cherubims in the Tabernacle,
but four in the Temple. And now it is said to rest, 1 Chronicles. 23.25. The Lord
God has given rest to his people, and in regard of the unstayednesse of it
before Moses said to the people, ye are not yet come to your rest, Deuteronomy. 12.9.

Why the staves were not taken from the Arc in the Temple.
But it is to be observed, that when it was settled in the Temple, the staves
which carried it were not taken away; although they were hid and did not
appear, as they did when the Coathites carried it, yet the ends of the staves
were seen out in the holy place before the Oracle, 1 King, 8.8. this was done
to let the Jews understand, that if they abused this Arc, the Testimony of
his presence, and put their trust only in it; that the staves were ready to
be pulled out again to carry it from them.

Solomon said, The places are holy whereinto the Ark of the Lord has come, 2
Chro. 8.11. yet it was but the furniture of a worldly sanctuary, Heb. 9.1. and
under the Gospel to be done away, that men should say no more the Arc of the
covenant of the Lord: at that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the
Lord, Ier. 3.16. the Church then shall be his Arc, and he shall sit upon it,
because it shall be sanctified, and all shall have access to the holiest.

EXERCITAT. V. Where they worshipped when the Arc and Tabernacle were
separated. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 2.
1 King. 3.4. And the King went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the
great high place, a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that Altar.
Moses Tabernacle was removed from Shilh, The Tabernacle removed from Shilo
after the Arc was taken out of it.
Psalm. 78.60. He refused the Tabernacle of Shiloh; and it seems to have been
transported at that time, when the Arc was taken out of it, and the Philistims
had overcome the Israelites, 1 Samuel 4.11. It was removed from Shilo, Iere.
17.12. But go ye now into my place which was in Shilo; where I set my name at
the first, and see what I did to it, and Psalm. 78.67. Moreover he refused the
Tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the Tribe of Ephraim, but he chose the
Tribe of Judah: the Mount Sion which he loved, that is, he rejected Shiloh
which stood in the Tribe of Ephraim, and the Tabernacle of Joseph, because
Ephraim was Joseph's son.

The Tabernacle was transported from Shiloh to Nob, The Tabernacle carried to
Nob.
a City of the Priests unto which David did fly; from thence it was
transported to Gibeon, a City in the Tribe of Benjamin, where it remained
until Solomon brought it to Jerusalem, 2 Chro. 1.3. And Solomon and all the
Congregation with him went unto the high place which was in Gibeon; Solomon
brought the Tabernacle to Jerusalem.
for there was the Tabernacle of the Congregation of God, which Moses the
servant of God had made in the Wilderness. From thence Solomon brought the
Tabernacle of the Congregation into the Temple of the Lord, 2 Cor. 5.5.6.7. And
the Priests brought the Arc of the covenant of the Lord unto his own place;
but the Tabernacle, as the Hebrews say, was laid up without any more use.



Who might sacrifice in other places then at the Arc or Tabernacle.
These who had an extraordinary warrant, as Solomon, David, and such,
sacrificed in other places; as Samuel sacrificed at Rama, and David built an
Altar in the threshing floor of Arauna the Iebusite, and sacrificed there; and
the Hebrews say, Aram privatam non esse licitam nisi Prophetis.

Sometimes the sacrifice, Priest and place are changed.
In extraordinary sacrifices ye shall see sometimes the place only changed, as
in Samuel and David's sacrificing; sometimes the Lord changed the place, the
sacrifice, and the Priests; he changed the sacrifice when Gideon had prepared a
Kid for a feast to the Angel, the Kid was only to be offered in a sacrifice
for the sin of the Prince, Gideons sacrifice.
Leviticus. 4.2. yet he offered the Kid here; then no sacrifice was boiled
before it was offered; but this was boiled first, and then offered; then he
offered the bread for the meat offering, and the broth for the drink offering:
and the Priest was changed, the Angel was the Priest, and Gideon was the
Levite; and last the place was changed. The Lord who is the lawgiver, and
gives laws to men, and not to himself, he may change time, place, and person
as he pleases.

Salomons sacrificing in Gibeon, 1 King. 3.3. And Solomon loved the Lord
walking in his statutes, as David his father, only he sacrificed and burnt
incense in high places.

Solomon sacrificed upon the brazen Altar which was in Gibeon, as his father
did, 1 Chr. 1.30. Solomon sinned not in offering in Gibeon.
this is not set down as a blemish to Solomon, as if he had done any thing
otherwise then his father; for he loved the Lord, and walked in his statutes as
his father David: (...) est particula restrictiva, non exclusiva vel exceptiva.
and rak here is not particula exceptiva vel exclusiva, but only restrictiva;
that is, he sacrified in no other places, but only in the place where he saw
his father sacrifice.

King. 3. only the people sacrificed in the high places; because there was no
house built unto the name of the Lord in those days.

Three sorts of those who sacrificed before the Temple was builded.
Some answer that there were three sorts of those who sacrificed in those days,
first, those who sacrificed to the true God in a place appointed by him;
secondly, some sacrificing to the true God, but in a place not appointed or
allowed; and thirdly, some sacrificing to Idols in a place not appointed by
him: and they make the people sacrificing in high places because the Temple was
not built yet, to be worshippers of the second sort; The high places in the
Scriptures usually are taken in an evil sense.
but if we shall look in what sense the high places are taken usually in the
Scriptures, we shall find that they signify a place where they worshipped
false gods.

Psalm. 84.3. which David speaks of when he says, yea the Sparrow has found
a house, and the Swallow a nest for her self where she may lay her young ones,
even thine Altar; Seeing no unclean thing was permitted to enter within the
Temple; and the Hebrews write, (...) inhibens corvum
that there was cole gnorebb a scar-crow set up upon the Temple to fright the
fowls, that they might not come near it.

What Altars are meant that David speaks of.
By the Altars here, are meant the Altars which were built in the high places to
the Lord by the Prophets, before the Temple was built; for as yet Salomons
Temple was not builded: or it may be said that David spoke this by the spirit
of prophecy, of the Altars in the time of the captivity, when the Swallows
built their nests in the ruins of the Altars.

Elias mean of, when he says, they have destroyed thine Altars, seeing now
there were no Altars in the high places, which were the Lords Altars?

They have destroyed thy Altars, that is, all the means of thy worship; By
Altars is meant the means of Gods worship.
or if we take the Altars literally, it may be understood of those Altars built
by the Prophets extraordinarily after the Temple was built, as Elias built an
Altar in mount Carmel.

The Jews add farther, that all the times that they sacrificed upon these
Altars, they sacrificed a female and not a male, (...)
1 Samuel 7.9. vajagnalehu, and obtulit ipsum; but the critickes of the Jews,
the Masoreth reads it vajagnaleah, that is, they offered a female upon these
Altars, and not a male.

It was a fault to offer in the high places after the Temple was builded.
Offering of sacrifice upon the high places was found fault with after the
Temple was built; Iehosaphat is blamed for this, that he took not away the
highplaces, 1 King. 22.43. and likewise Asa, 1 King. 15.14. because he took
not away the high places; but the Lord commended Ezekiah much for taking away
the high places, yet Rabsache blamed him for taking away these high places and
Altars, Esaias 36.7.



EXERCITAT. VI. Of the situation of the City of Jerusalem. A ceremonial
appendix of Command 2.
Psalm. 48. Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion,
on the sides of the north the City of the great king.
Jerusalem was compassed about with Hills and Valleys, the Hiles were Gareb,
Calvarie, Gihon, Aceldamae, The Hills compassed Jerusalem.
Olivet, the Valleys were the Valley of dead Carkases, Tyropaeum, the Valley
of Iehosophat or hinnon, or the Kings dale.

The City it self stood upon four Hills, The Hills upon which Jerusalem stood.
Sion toward the south; Akra toward the north, upon which Salem stood; Moriah
betwixt Sion and Akra; and Bezetha betwixt Akra and Moriah; and betwixt Sion
and Moriah lay the great gulf of Millo.

Upon every one of these hills there is some notable thing to be observed: Some
memorable things done on every one of the Hills.
upon mount Gareb all the Lepers were put, therefore it is called, the hill of
Scabbes, Iere. 31.39. upon mount Calvarie Christ was crucified; upon Gihon
Solomon was anointed King; In Aceldama was the potters field which was bought
with the price of the just one, for the burial of strangers, Amos 2.6. Act.
1.19. upon mount Olivet Christ was taken up to Heaven.

Upon mount Sion stood the fort of the Iebusites, The City of David stood in
Sion.
which David taking in afterward, called it the City of David, there he built
his house. In mount Akra stood the old City Salem, where Melchizedeck dwelt,
and it is called Akra from hakkara, (...) obviam veniens.
obviam venit, because there he met Abraham and blessed him when he returned
from the slaughter of the Kings, In mount Moriah Abraham would have offered his
son.
Genesis 14.19. Upon mount Moriah Abraham would have offered his son Isaac, Genesis
22 and here the Angel stood with a drawn sword in his hand above the
threshing floor of Arauna the Iebusite; and upon this mount afterward was the
Temple of Solomon builded.

The new town of Jerusalem stood in Bezetha called the upper Market.
In Bezetha was builded the new town of Jerusalem, called forum inferius, in
respect of forum superius that was in Sion. To the north of Bezetha and Akra
stood the new town builded by Hezekiah which he compassed round about with a
wall called murus tertius, for the first wall was builded by David round about
Sion, even to the Sheep-gate; the second wall was builded by Solomon round
about Bezetha, and joined with the first wall at the Sheepe-gate; the third
wall was builded by Hezekiah joining it to the old wall of the City Salem, and
compassed round about mount Akra to the water gate, where it joined with the
second wall.

The gulf Millo.
Millo was a deep gulf lying to the north of Sion, and to the south of
Moriah; this gulf Solomon filled up when he builded his own house, the
Queens house and the house of Lebanon.

Mount Sion in which the City of David stood, was called the upper town, and
the rest that were toward, the north of it, (...) Jerusalem superior. (...)
Jerusalem inferior.
Salem and Bezetha, were called the nether town, and to this the Apostle
alludeth, Gal. 4.25. Jerusalem which is beneath, and Jerusalem which is above;
Jerusalem which is above signified anogogicallie the triumphant Church, but
allegorically the free children begotten within the covenant of grace; and
Jerusalem below signified the children of the bond woman; and for this cause it
is put in the duall number Ierusalaijm; (...)
because it consists of two Cities which the Greeks call (...). So Jacobs
army is called mahanaijm, consisting of two armies, one heavenly, another
earthly; to these two Solomon compares the Church, Cant 6.13. what will ye
see in the Shulamite; as it were the company of Manaham, or two armies, she
consisted partly of Citizens in the triumphant Church, and partly of Citizens
in the militant.

Jerusalem is sometimes called Sion, Jerusalem is sometimes called Sion, and
sometimes Moriah.
and sometimes Moriah, and Sion is called, the hill of God, Psalm. 68.15. that
is, an excellent hill; for the Hebrews wanting the superlative, they supply it
by adding the name God, by which they understand that which is most excellent
and great in that kind, Psalm. 80.11. The trees of it were like the Cedars of
God, that is, excellent Cedars, So 1 Samuel 18.10. the evil spirit of the Lord
came upon Saul, that is, a very evil spirit. So Jerusalem is called the
daughter of Sion, that is, Sion herself, as the Son of man, that is, a man.

When Jerusalem and Sion are set together, Jerusalem and Sion put together for
the more earnest expression.
they are so to be understood, as a repetition of the selfsame thing for the
more earnest expression, as Zach. 9.9. O daughter of Sion, O daughter of
Jerusalem, here the explaining of the one word by the other, carries a great
weight with it. So Psalm. 92.9. For lo thine enemies, O Lord, for lo, thine
enemies, O Lord, shall perish, that is, they shall surely perish.

Moriah is also taken for all the hills whereupon the City stood, Genesis 22.2. Go
to the Land of vision, that is, Moriah taken largely for all the hills in
Jerusalem.
to the land of Moriah, but Abraham seeing that excellent vision, verse. 14. of
which Christ spoke, Ioh. 8.56. Abraham rejoiced to see my day, he appropriated
the general name, particularly to this mountain, and called it Moriah.

David said to bring the head of Goliath to Jerusalem, 1 Samuel 17.54. seeing he
had not taken in Jerusalem a long time after?

Jerusalem which stood in the tribe of Benjamin was taken in by Saul before,
and to this part David brought the head of Goliath; but the other part was
possessed still by the Iebusites until David was crowned King both over Israel
and Judah, and the first victory that he got after he was crowned King over both
Israel and Judah, was over the Iebusites.

Jerusalem is called the midst of the earth, Ezekiel. 38.12. in the original
Tabbur, (...) vmbilicus, metaphorice Locus editus. why Jerusalem is called the
midst or the navil of the earth
umbilicus, because it stood upon the hills, as the Navell does in the Body; by
this is understood that parable of Gaal, Judge. 9.37. Behold people came down
from the Navell of the earth, that is, from Jerusalem, hence all the Regions
round about Jerusalem take their denomination from the situation of it, Other
countries take their denominations from the situation of Jerusalem.
Psalm. 89.12. the north and the sea thou have created them, and it is called
the north in respect of Jerusalem. So Psalm. 107.3. From the East, and from the
West, and from the North, and from the sea. Here the mediterranean Sea in the
Scriptures is put for the South in respect of Jerusalem; therefore the
situation of the heavens is not taken from the body of man in the Scripture,
The situation of the heavens is taken from the Lord dwelling betwixt the
Cherubims.
as the Philosophers say, but from the Lord dwelling betwixt the Cherubims in
the west end of the Temple of Jerusalem; who sits betwixt the Cherubims,
(...) est vespera occasus (...) est locus campest^is, et pluraliter (...)
Coeli: hinc est quod quidam verterunt Equitat super ad Occasum: Alii, Insidet
amoenitatibus: Alii, Equitat super Coelos.
looking always toward the East, and then his right hand was to the South,
and his left hand to the North, Psalm. 68.4. extol him, qui equitat super ad
occ^sum, who rides upon the West; because the Cherubims stood in the west end
of the Temple.

The Conclusion of this is, Jerusalem being in the center of the earth, and the
line of the Gospel going out from it to be preached through the whole earth, to
gather in the Church of the Gentiles to the Jews, whereby they might make a
compacted City; therefore glorious things are spoken of it. So Ier. 3.17. All
the Nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the Lord to Jerusalem, in
the original it is, Venikevu, They shall run in a line; (...) linea little.
for the Gospel went out from Jerusalem, the sound thereof went to the ends of
the earth, Psalm. 19.5. in the original it is, the line thereof: for Jerusalem
was as the center, and the lines went from the center to the ends of the whole
earth, and the same way that the lines went out from it: So shall all Nations
return by the same lines, and be gathered in to Jerusalem which is above.

EXERCITAT. VII. In what Tribe the Temple stood. A ceremonial appendix of
Command. 2.
Ezekiel. 43.12. This is the Law of the house, Upon the top of the mountain the
whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy: behold this is the Law of
the house.
THat we may the better understand to what Tribe the Temple of Jerusalem did
belong, Why the Tribes were kept distinct.
we must mark that the Lord commanded in his Law that neither the Tribes,
their possessions, nor generations should be confounded; to the end, they might
know of what Tribe Christ should come, who was to come of the seed of David
according to the flesh: therefore he caused to divide the Land into Tribes,
Number. 36.2. and he commanded that they should not dispone of their possessions
either amongst themselves, or to strangers; therefore if a poor man for
poverty had morgaged his possession, the Lord appointed the year of Iubile
that it might return to him again that year, Levit. 15.10.

To which Tribe the Temple belonged.
Now Judah having gotten his lot, and Benjamin his (for upon these two Tribes the
Temple did stand) the question is, to which of these it did belong? for
sometimes it is given to the Tribe of Judah, Josh. 15.63. as for the Iebusites
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Israel could not drive them out,
(...) verbum contrary significationis
but the Iebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day,
In the original it is, Iarash, exhareditare, to cast them out of their
possessions. The Temple ascribed to the Tribe of Benjamin.
Sometimes to the Tribe of Benjamin, Judge. 1.25. Josh. 18.20. and Nehe. 11.24.
Jerusalem could not belong to them both alike, for mount Moriah stands
betwixt the upper and lower City, the upper belonged to the Tribe of Judah, and
the lower to Benjamin, but to which of the Tribes does mount Moriah belong? it
seems to be ascribed to the Tribe of Benjamin by the testament of Jacob, Why
Benjamin is called a ravening Woolfe.
as the scepter to the Tribe of Judah; for Jacob says in his testament,
Benjamin shall ravine as a Woolfe: in the morning he shall devour the prey,
and at night he shall divide the spoil, Genesis 49.27. by which is signified the
Altar upon which the sacrifices were burnt, and the blood powered out at the
foot of the Altar: for the Priests killed the sacrifice in the morning, and
divided the spoil, that is, the things which they had gotten from the people,
they divided amongst themselves at night; they call the Altar the ravening
Woolfe, and the Priests the dividers of the spoil.

The Temple ascribed to the Tribe of Judah.
Again the Tribe of Judah vendicateth the Temple to them, Psalm. 78.67. he
refused the Tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the Tribe of Ephraim; but chose
the Tribe of Judah, the mount Sion which he loved, and he built his sanctuary
like high places, like the earth which he has established for ever, meaning
the Temple, which was builded in this Tribe.

But that we may decide the question, we must mark that the Temple was builded
upon mount Moriah, 2 Chronicles. 3.1. The Temple was builded upon mount Moriah.
this mount Moriah was divided from mount Akra by a great valley, but in the
time of the Macchabees they filled up this valley, that they might join the
City to the Temple, and made the top of mount Akra lower, that they might see
the Temple in the City.

The upper and the nether City were divided by a great valley which Josephus
calls Tyropoeon, How the upper and nether City of Jerusalem were divided.
and in the Scriptures Millo. If the line be drawn through this valley, then
it leaves Sion toward the South in the Tribe of Judah, and mount Moriah with
Salem and Akra toward the North, in the Tribe of Benjamin, but if the line be
drawn through the valley which was filled up by the Maccabees, then mount
Moriah is conjoined with Sion in the Tribe of Judah; for the Temple was builded
in the threshing floor of Arauna the Iebusite; and the Iebusites dwelt upon
mount Sion: therefore the division by this valley cannot show us in what Tribe
the Temple stood; So that we must search out another line, which separateth the
Tribe of Judah from Benjamin; which line being to the north of Judah, must be
upon the south of Benjamin, the two extremes of this line are set down, Josh.
15.5. The line which divided Judah from Benjamin reached from the dead Sea to
the Mediterranean Sea.
where he describes the borders of Judah; the cast part of the line tends
toward the dead Sea, at that part where Jordan enters into it, called Lingua
maris; and the west part of the line tends toward the great Sea, called the
mediterranean Sea; these are his words; For the east border was the salt Sea,
even to the end of Jordan, this was the dead Sea where Sodom and Gomorra
stood, And their border in the north quarter, was from the bay of the Sea at
the uttermost part of Jordan, Josh 15.5. The line comes from En-rogel through
the valley of Hinnom to the tongue of the Sea.
This was toward the east, the line was stretched forth toward the west to
En-rogel which is a fountain in the valley of Hinnom where the valley Tyropoeon
ends. Now if ye will stretch out the line from the fountain of En-rogel to
the tongue of the Sea, it must be drawn through the valley of Hinnom, to the
north of mount Sion, and then it is subjoyned, verse. 9. (speaking of Moriah)
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the
water of Nephtoah, which is over against Hinnom toward the west, and to the
valley of Rephaim toward the north, for Josh. 18.16. makes mention of two
valleys, one toward the east of the City, called Hinnom, upon the west of
which lies the hill Moriah and the Temple; the other valley is called the
valley of Rephaim or of Giants, lying toward the west and south of mount
Sion, then the north part of that valley must stretch toward mount Moriah, and
the line which divides the City and the mountain thereof to wit Moriah, in
two parts, must touch the valley of Rephaim toward the north, The line goes
directly over the top of Mount Moriah.
the same division is set down, Neh. 11.24. So that Benjamin had the north
side of this line, and Judah the south, and the line stretching over the top of
mount Moriah, it went through the middle of the Temple, and through the holiest
of all; so that the one half of the Temple stood in the Tribe of Judah, The
line goes through the midst of the Temple, the holiest, and holiest of all,
and betwixt the Cherubims.
and the other in the Tribe of Benjamin; the one half of the Arc in the one
Tribe, and the other in the other; and of the four Cherubims, two stood in one
Tribe, and two in another; and God himself sitting betwixt the wings of the
Cherubims is said to dwell (cethephau) betwixt his shoulders, How God is said
to dwell betwixt his shoulders.
that is, in Jerusalem where the Temple stood in the very borders of Judah and
Benjamin. (...) humerus vel extremitas alicujus rei.
Catheph signifies the borders or marches, as if he should say, he shall dwell
in the very outmost borders of Judah and Benjamin.

Now for the better understanding of these things which have been spoken
before, mark this figure following.

West.

North.

East.

South.



And for this cause it was that Solomon had in his throne twelve Lions
upholding it, but on the seat where he sat and leaned his arms, there was a
Bullock and a Lion; the Lion for Judah and the Bullock for Benjamin: by which
was signified; Why Salomons Throne had a Bullock and an Ox.
when ten Tribes should be rent from his crown, that Judah, and Benjamin
should cleave together and uphold the Temple; both Judah and Benjamin went in
captivity together, came home together, and builded the Temple together.

Benjamin and the kingly Scepter was in Judah the upper City.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Of the Temple of Jerusalem. Commandment 2.
1 King. 8.30. Hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy
people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place.
THe Lord made choice of this Temple, not so much for himself as for his
people; The Lord causes to build the temple not so much for himself as for
man's cause.
for God dwells not in houses made with hands, Act. 7.48.

God fitting himself to man's capacity, does as a Prince uses to do; for as
a Prince makes choice of some great City for his residence; so does the Lord
make choice of Jerusalem: The Lord compared to a Prince in his princely house.
therefore it is called the City of the great King, Matthew. 5.36. and as a
prince has his palace within a great City; so has the Lord his Temple within
Jerusalem; and therefore it is called the place of his habitation, Psalm. 76.2.
and as a Prince has his palace distinguished in so many courts: so was the
Temple of Jerusalem: and as they have their furnished Tables; so the Lord has
his Altar for his Table, Mala. 1.7. The Lord had his Table and appointed times,
as it were, for dinner and supper.
and and his appointed time for dinner and supper, were the morning and evening
Sacrifices, Psalm. 50.10. Every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle
upon a thousand hills. If I be hungry I will not tell thee.

This Temple was called the throne of his glory, Iere. 14.21. So the perfection
of beauty, and the joy of the whole earth, Lament. 2.15. So the place of his
rest, Psalm. 132.14. and 1 Chro. 6.41.

It was divided into three parts, and therefore, The Temple divided in three
parts.
Iere. 7.4. uses a threefold repetition to note these three parts of the
Temple.

The first was the holiest, the Seventy call it (...), Diverse names ^^en to the
holiest.
it is also called Oraculum; Exodus 25.22. and it called Sanctum Sanctorum, the
holy of the holiest, because it was separated from all profane uses, Heb. 9.14.
and because it was holy, the Highpriest who went into it, behoved to sanctify
himself before he went into it, and he was a type of Christ, who was holy,
blameless and undefiled, and separated from sinners, Heb. 26.7.

The second part of the Temple was called (...) vel Sanctum, and here the
Priest did four things, first, What things the Priests did in the holy place.
he trimmed the lamps and lighted them, secondly, he cleansed the Altar,
thirdly, he prepared the Table for the shewbread, and fourthly, he offered
incense.

Before they entered into the holy place, The two Pillars what they signified.
there stood two great pillars, Iachin and Boaz, Stabilitie and strength, 1
King. 7.21. which signifies the indurance of the spiritual Temple the Church,
that the gates of Hell should not prevail against her, Matthew. 16.17. So they
signified the Apostles, who are called pillars, Gal. 2.9. and likewise all
Christians, Reve. 3.12. him that overcommeth will I make a pillar in the Temple
of my God.

What things were done betwixt the porch and the Altar.
Betwixt this porch and the Altar the Priests humbled themselves, and wept in
the day of humiliation, Joel. 2.17. it was in this place that Zachary was
stoned to death, 2 Chro. 24.21. So here stood five and twenty men, with their
backs toward the Temple, and their faces toward the East, and they worshipped
the Sun, Ezekiel. 8.16. and there was the court of the people, and last the
court of the Gentiles, where the Proselytes stood when they were converted,
this was farthest from the holiest of all; therefore it is said, that the
Publican stood afar off, Luke 18.13. meaning from the holiest, it was out of
this place where Christ drove away the buyers and sellers, and the entry to
this was called the beautiful gate, or Salomons Porch, Act. 3.2.

Why the court of the Gentiles was left out.
This court of the Gentiles was to be left out and not to be measured, Reve.
11.2. but the court which is without the Temple, leave out, and measure it not;
for it is given unto the Gentiles, this was done to signify the multitude of
the Gentiles that were to be called, that this court could not contain them.

A comparison betwixt the first and second Temple.
FIrst, both the first and second Temple were builded by Jews and Tyrians; the
first Temple, 1 King. 5.18. and Salomons builders, and Hirams builders did hew
them, The Jews and Tyrians were builders of the first and second Temple.
etc. So the Tyrians helped to build the second Temple, Ezr. 2.7. and they
signify the diversity of gifts which are requisite for the building of the
Church, and that people of all Nations shall have access to the Church.

The second Temple was built after the manner of the first, the pattern of the
first Temple was showed to David, and he showed to it to Solomon. The second
Temple was built after the manner of the first.
So the pattern of the second Temple was showed to Ezekiel, and he showed it
to Zerubbabel.

The glory and splendour of the first Temple far exceeded the second: The
outward beauty of the first Temple exceeded the Glory of the second.
the first Temple was all built of hewn and polished stone, but not the
second; and where it is said in the Gospel that the Temple was adorned with
goodly stones and gifts, Luke 21.5. that is meant only of Solomon's Porch, and
that part which looks toward mount Olivet, for Christ fate upon mount Olivet
when they showed him that goodly sight; but the rest of the Temple was not of
such polished stone.

Secondly, the glory of the first Temple, The Temple is called gold.
it was all gilded within, and therefore it is called gold, Lament. 4.1. How is
the gold become dim? How is the most fine gold changed? the stones of the
Sanctuary are powered out in the top of every street, but there was no such
gilding in the second Temple.

Thirdly, The first Temple was built without noise, but not so the second.
there was no hammer heard in the building of the first Temple, but there was
much noise heard in the laying of the foundation of the second Temple, Ezra.
3.12. and in the building of it, for with the one hand they wrought in the
work, and with the other hand held a weapon, Nehem. 4.17.

Fourthly, the first Temple was filled with a cloud, Many things wanting in the
second Temple which were in the first.
but not the second. In the first Temple there came a fire from heaven to
kindle the Sacrifice, but not in the second; the Arc and the holy oil were
not in the second, there were many more Prophets in the first than in the
second; the second Temple was often defiled by the Greeks, by the Romans, by
Antiochus; but not the first,

Yet the glory of the second Temple far exceeded the glory of the first, Hag.
2.9. The second Temple exceeded the first Temple in glory.
The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, says the
Lord of hosts; for in this place I will give peace, says the Lord of hosts.

In place of the gold in the first, was Jesus Christ in the second Temple, in
whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, Coloss. 2.3. In place
of the polished and hewn stones in the first Temple, How the second Tem-
exceeded the first.
was Jesus Christ in the second Temple, a living stone, and his members, as
lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, 1 Pet. 2.4.5. The glory of
which was in the first Temple left it; but the glory of the second Temple,
Jesus Christ, promises to be with us unto the end of the world. Solomon who
built the first Temple fell away to Idolatry, but Zerobabel who built the
second Temple fell not to Idolatry; the first Temple had the holy oil; but in
the second Temple came Jesus Christ, who was anointed with the oil of
gladness above his fellows, Psalm. 45.7. Now because of all these privileges
of the second Temple above the first, therefore Christ is said to come to his
Temple, Malac. 3.1.

A comparison betwixt the Temple and Christ.
All that was in the Temple were types of Christ.
EVery thing which was in the Temple, was a type of Christ; the veil was a type
of his flesh, Heb. 10.20. the golden Altar, of his intercession, Reve. 8.3. and
the brazen Altar, of his passion.

Because this Temple was a type of the body of Christ, Ioh. 2.19. destroy this
Temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Therefore no man might carry a
vessel through it, The reverence that was had to the Temple being a type of
Christ.
Mark. 11.16. No man might walk upon the top of it, therefore when the Devil
took Christ up and set him upon it, and his slaves who took James the Apostle
and threw him down from the top of it, they did that which was altogether
forbidden to the Jews.

A comparison betwixt the Temple and Heaven.
THe Temple was made in weight number and measure, Ezekiel. 43.10. (...) expendit
numero, pondere and measura.
and this word is applied to the Heavens, Ezekiel. 40.12. to teach us to make an
anagogicall application from the Temple to the heavens; and therefore the
Temple is called Heaven, 2 Chro. 6.30. Psalm. 11.4. The Lord is in his holy
Temple, the Lords Throne is in Heaven.

There was a controversy betwixt the Samaritans and the Jews, whether the
Temple of Jerusalem, The contention betwixt the Samaritans and Jews for the
place of Gods worship.
or the Temple of Samaria was the place of Gods worship. Christ ends this
controversy, Ioh. 4.21. when he says, The hour comes, when ye shall
neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father. And to show
how that Jerusalem should be no more the place of Gods worship, first he
separated the Arc from the Tabernacle; secondly, the Arc from the Temple; God
remooved from the Temple by degrees.
and then shortly afterward he destroyed the Temple. Jeremiah complayneth in
his time, that the Lord was like a stranger in the Land, and as a wayfaring
man, that turns aside to tarry for a night, Iere. 14.8. A wayfaring man that
tarrieth but for a night in an Inn, has but little care of it: So the Lord
began now to be a stranger, and to take little care of this Inn his Temple,
where he was wont to lodge, and now he was to forsake it for ever.

Jerusalem shall be built again. When they pray, they ever turn their faces
toward the Temple of Jerusalem; and when they see a new house builded, they
mark the white wall with a black stick, (...) a contraction which is (...)
nigrum super album, Recordare vastationis.
and they leave a little space wherein they write those words, nigrum super
album, and under this they write, recordare vastationis; they mark the white
wall with a black stick, to signify, that they mourn, because Jerusalem is
not built as that new wall is built; and they pray the Lord to remember the
destruction of Jerusalem, and to have pity upon it, and they say, Psalm. 137.4.
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, etc.

EXERCITAT. IX. Of the Cherubims. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 2.
Exodus 25.18. And thou shall make two Cherubims of Gold: of beaten Gold shall
thou make them, in the two ends of the Mercie-seat.
THey are called Cherubims from the Hebrew word Racabh to ride, (...)
Cherubinus (...) equitare. (...) Seraphin angeli quia celeritate and aspectus
splendore quasi flammantes and ignei visi sunt a (...) ussit.
because the Lord did ride betwixt them, Psalm. 18.10. He rode upon a Cherub,
and he sits between the Cherubims, Psalm. 99.1. therefore they are called
Mercahhak hashekina, the Chariot of Gods Majesty.

They are also called Seprahim from Saraph to burn, because the Angels his
Ministers are a slaming fire, Psalm. 104.4. and the fyrie Angel or the Seraphin
touched the lips of the Prophet Esaias with a live-coale which he had taken with
the Tongs from off the Altar, Esa. 6.6.

The first place that we read of these Cherubims, is, Genesis 3.24. He placed at
the east end of the Garden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming Sword. And hence it
is probable that the history of Genesis was written after that the Tabernacle
was erected in the wilderness, for Moses writes of them, as of things heard
and known amongst the people.

They are painted as young men and not like boys or children, The Angels are
painted as young men.
and so the Angels appeared in the likeness of young men, Mark. 16.5. And
entering into the Sepulcher they saw a young man sitting on the right side
clothed in a long white garment.

They are made in a comely form and well favored, They are painted in a comely
form.
whereas the Devil (although he can transform himself into an Angel of
light) appears usually in terrible and evil favored shapes, (...) corvus
atramentum diabolus

therefore there is but one word in the Syriacke both for the Raven, Ink, and
for the Devil; because he appears black like the Raven. The Cherubims had
not four faces but four shapes or habits. (...) fignificat aspectum, formam
vel habitum.


They are not painted with four faces, as it is commonly holden, for panim,
facies, Eze. 1.10. is not taken for the face, but for the form or habit. Luke
9.53. And they did not receive him, because his face was, as though he would
go to Jerusalem, that is, his habit; he looked as though he would go to
Jerusalem. So the Cherubims in somethings they looked like man, in their faces;
they went straight up as having legs and thighs, then they were like the Lion
in something, in their neck and breast like the crest of the Lion; and like the
Eagle in their wings; and like the Calfe or the Ox in their feet. Therefore
those are mistaken who think that they had four faces, and from them the
Egyptians borrowed their Sphinges, 1 Macchs. 3.48. And they laid open the book
of the Law wherein the heathen had sought to paint the likeness of their
Images, that is, they sought to paint their Images like the Cherubims; the man
in the Cherub has the face, because man of all visible creatures is the most
understanding, and is Lord over the rest.

What their wings signified.
They had wings to signify their readiness and protection, and David alludeth
to this, Psalm. 17.18. Hide me under thy wings, and the King of Tyrus is called
a Cherub, because of his protecting the people that were under him, Ezekiel. 28.14.

When one form of the Cherubims is expressed all the rest are understood.
When a Cherub is described by any of these four, all the rest are to be
understood. Example, 1 King. 7.29. And on the borders that were between the
ledges, were Lions, Oxen, and Cherubims; [And] here, is exegeticum, and not
copulativum, that is, he made Cherubims which had the likeness of Oxen and
Lions.

They had six wings, with two they covered their faces, and with two they
covered their feet, and with two they did flee, and it is probable that the
Cherubims in the Tabernacle and Temple had six wings also, although they did
not fly, two to cover their faces, two to cover their feet, and two stretched
out: their feet was covered, The Lord would have the Cherubims covered and not
to appear naked.
the Lord would not have them to appear naked; therefore ye shall see when
they appeared to men they appeared clothed, Act. 1.10. Two men stood by them
in white apparel. So Mark. 16.5. and the Prests are commanded to put on
breaches, when they come before the Lord, to cover their nakedness. Lev.
10.26. Ezekiel. 24.18.

The wings are put for their hands.
They are made with wings, and, in that vision of Ezekiel, with hands under
their wings, Eze. 1.8. but where they are described with wings, and no mention
made of their hands, then their wings served them for hands, and so the Hebrews
put a wing for a hand, Psalm. 7.4. If there be iniquity in mine hands, (...) in
alls vel manibus meis.
in the Hebrew it is becaphai, in my wing.

And they appeared in these forms, quae notant Christi trophaeum, The diverse
forms of the Cherubims signify Christ glorious triumph.
which shows Christ's triumph and victory; who was borne as a man; killed as
a Calfe; rose like a Lion; and ascended like an Eagle: and so in the revelation
made to John, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first
beast was like a Lion, and the second beast like a Calfe, and the third beast
had the face of a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying Eagle, Revel. 4.7.

Now let us observe the difference betwixt the Cherubims in the Tabernacle and
the Cherubims in the Temple; The difference betwixt the Cherubims in the Temple
and Tabernacle.
there were but two in the Tabernacle, and four in the Temple; those who stood
in the Tabernacle looked downward with their faces toward the propitiatory,
but two of the Cherubims which were in the Temple, and stood upon the ground,
looked with their faces to the entry of the Temple, and they had their wings
stretched out, not as their wings which stood upon the Arc in the Tabernacle;
and the signification was this, that now their charge was to be extended, and
the Gentiles were to be called to wait upon them also.

Again, Difference betwixt the Cherubims which Ezekiel saw, and them in the
Tabernacle and Temple.
mark a difference betwixt the Cherubims in Ezekiels vision, and these in the
Tabernacle and Temple. In Ezekiels vision they are described full of eyes, but
in the Tample and Tabernacle they are not so described: they are described full
of eyes, (...) to signify that the Lord whom they attend is full of eyes, and
sees all things.

Those Cherubims in Ezekiels vision moved, but these in the Temple and
Tabernacle stirred not; when these moved, they moved forwards but never
backward or in a circle, they stood still at the commandment of the Lord or
went forward at his commandment.

In Esaiahs vision they cried holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts, Esa.
6.13. but in Ezekiels vision they made but a sound or a noise.

What an Angel is.
Of this which has been said we may describe a Cherub or an Angel after this
manner. An Angel is a creature most understanding, most strong, most swift,
and most obedient. First, they are most understanding, therefore they have the
face of a man, and they are full of eyes, to teach us that they exceed man in
knowledge, men are but ratiocinantes creaturae, and they are intelligentes
creatura, they learn hoc post hoc, sed non hoc ex hoc, as men do.

Israelites in Egypt, but to teach them to pass by their houses, as we are led
by the Sign to know the house?

Israelites that the Angels should not destroy them.

The second property of Angels is their strength, represented by the Lion,
(...) Robustissimi.
and therefore they are called the strong ones, Psalm. 78.25. one of them killed
an hundred fourscore and five thousand in one night, 2 King. 19.35.

The third property of the Angels is their sweetness represented by the Eagle,
one Angel killed all the first borne of Egypt in one night, Exodus 12.29.

The fourth property is their obedience represented by the Ox, therefore we
pray, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven, Matthew. 6.10.

The children of God have protection by the Angels.
to keep them in all their ways; Alexander the Great slept soundly one night
when the enemy was near by him; and being asked how he could sleep so
soundly; he answered, because Parmenio waked: (...) vigilantes.
So may the children of God lie down in peace and sleep, Psalm. 4.8. because
they have gnirin, the watchful ones attending them, Dan. 4.17. Solomon had
sixty valiant men of the valiant of Israel having all swords because of fear
in the night, Cant. 3.7. but the children of God have more strong and valient
on^s waiting upon them, so that they need not be affrayd neither in the day or
in the night.

EXERCITAT. X. Of the golden Candlestick. A eremoniall Appendix of Command 2.
Exodus 25.31. And thou shall make a Candlestick of pure Gold, of beaten work
shall the Candlestick be made; his shaft and his branches, his bowels, his
knops, and his flowers shall be of the same.
THe matter of which this Candlestick was made, was pure Gold, and it had a
shaft, branches, bowlse, knops and flowers.

The pure gold signified how excellent the word of God is, Psalm. 19.10. more to
be desired are they then gold, The signification of the Candlestick.
yea then much fine gold.

We are not curiously here to seek the difference of the knops, branches and
flowers, but only to rest in the general, that the Candlestick signified the
Word.

The Candlestick had seven branches, it signified the diverse gifts bestowed
upon his Church by the word, The branches of the Candlestick signified the
diverse gifts bestowed upon the Church.
and John alludeth to the seven branches of this Candlestick, Revel. 1.13. And
in the midst of the seven Candlesticks one like the Son of man clothed with
a garment; this was but typus arbitrarius, or an allusion; for the golden
Candlestick was not made to be a type of the seven Churches in Asia, but it is
only an allusion to it. So Prove. 11.30. The fruit of the righteous is a tree
of life, here is an allusion only, that it is like to the tree of life.

The oil in the Tabernacle was pure oil.
The oil which was in this Candlestick was pure oil, Levit. 24.2. Command the
children of Israel that they bring unto thee pure oil Olive, beaten, for the
light, to cause the lamps to burn continually: (...) aurum, hic est oleum,
sic dictum, quod pur^m splendidum and nit idum fuit and sine mixtura.
This pure oil is called golden oil, or gold for the purity of it, Zach.
4.12. because the oil was bright, clear and glistering like gold. So Job.
37.22. Gold comes out of the north, that is, fair and clear weather. It was
beaten oil, to signify with what pain and travel the word is prepared, and
with patience preached and made to shine in his Church.

No Wax might be burnt in these lamps, because Honey was unclean, therefore
Wax was unclean; Honey might be in no Sacrifice, because it fermenteth,
Levit. 2.11. So no Wax might serve for light. So there was no silk in the
Tabernacle, because the Worm which makes silk was an unclean thing.

(...) baccae (...) spicae
The Prophet Zachary in a vision saw two Olive branches empyting themselves
through the two golden pipes into the Candlestick, and they are compared to two
ears of corn, What the two Olive trees were in the vision of Zachary.
because they were full of Olive berries, as the ears were of grains.

These Olive trees were the cause of the preservation of the Church, and the
cause of the maintenance in the Candlestick.

The two anointed ones which stand before the Lord of the whole earth, verse.
14. Targum paraphraseth them to be Zerubbabel and Joshua, who represented the
Church and commonwealth.

The Lord commanded to make snuffers of pure gold for the snuffing of the
lamps, The snuffers of gold what they signified.
and snuffe-dishes to receive the snufle; he would have the snuff taken from
the light, to signify that he would have the word kept in sincerity and
purity; and he would have the snuffers of gold, to teach them to be
blameless and holy, who are censurers and correctors of others; and he would
have the snuffe-dishes of gold, to teach them that the covering of the offenses
of their brethren was a most excellent thing.

Lastly, in what manner the Priests dressed the lamps; The manner how the
Priests trimmed the lamps.
when the lamp was out, he lighted it, and when it was not out, he dressed it;
when the middlemost lamp was out, he lighted it from the Altar; but the rest
of the lamps every one he lighted from the lamp that was next; and he lighted
one after another, to signify, that one Scripture gives light to another; and
they say in the Talmud, that the cleansing of the innermost Altar was before
the trimming of the five lamps; and the trimming of the five lamps before the
blood of the daily sacrifice; and the blood of the daily sacrifice before the
trimming of the two lamps; and the trimming of the two lamps, before the
burning of incense.

That the Priests should order and trim the lamps, The signification of the
trimming of the lamps.
signifies how Christ and his Ministers should continually look unto the
purity of doctrine and preaching of the light of the Gospel from evening to
morning, in the dark place of this world, until the day dawne and the day
star arise in our hearts, Reve. 1.13. 2 Pet. 1.19.

EXERCITAT. XI. Of the Table of the shewbread. A ceremonial appendix of
Command. 2.
Exodus 25.23. Thou shall also make a Table of Shittim wood, etc. verse. 30. And
thou shall set upon the Table shewbread before me always.
THe Lord commanded to make a Table, and to set twelve loaves upon it.

The loaves represent the Church.
First, the Church is represented by loaves here; as many grains make up one
loaf: so many believers make up one Church, 1 Cor. 10.17. for we being many
are one bread.

The loaves made of fine flower.
Secondly, these loaves were made of fine flower, and not of barley which was a
base grain, and therefore used in no other sacrifice but in the offering for
jealousy, Number. 5.15. So Gideon represented by a barley cake, Judge. 7.13. and I
bought her for so many Homers of Barley, Hos. 3.2. but the Wheat was most
excellent grain, and the flower of the Wheat was most excellent bread, Deuteronomy.
32.14. he made them eat the fat of the kidneys of Wheat.

The twelve loaves represented the twelve tribes.
Thirdly, there stood twelve loaves upon this Table, to represent the twelve
Tribes who came of the twelve Patriarchs: The Tribes were represented by many
things.
these twelve Tribes were represented by many things, by the twelve stones set
up in Jordan, and so by the twelve stones set up in the land of Canaan, So by
the twelve stones set upon the breastplate of Aaron, and upon his shoulders in
onyx stones. So by Canaan divided into twelve parts; and from them the twelve
Apostles in the New Testament and the new Jerusalem built upon twelve
foundations, Revel. 21.14.

These twelve loaves stood before the Lord; Why called shewbread.
therefore they were called panis facierum or propositionis, and they signify
that the Church is always the object of the eye of God, and therefore he
says, set up no Idol, (...)
gnal panai, in my presence. Why the bread was removed every Sabbath.


They were removed every Sabbath, and new loaves put in their places; to
signify the renewing of the graces of God to his Church.

None might eat of these loaves, Who might eat of the shewbread.
but the Priests who served in their course that week, and their children; the
Priests daughter did eat of this bread when she was a widow, and returned
home to her father again, Levit. 22.18. So we being married to the Law, and it
having dominion over us, Romans 7.1. we were out of our fathers house, and might
not eat of his holy bread; but being dead to the Law, Romans 7.4. and divorced
from our sins, as widows, we may come home to our fathers house, and be
partakers of the holy things.

The Priests so long as they were in this holy service, The legal
sanctification of the Priests.
and eat this holy bread, they were not to keep company with their wives; for
this was a part of their ceremonial uncleanness, Exodus 19.14. Moses
commanded them to wash their clothes, and not to come at their wives. This
abstinence, 1 Samuel 21. How David asked the shewbread.
is called via munda a clean way; and to eat in this uncleanness, is called
via polluta: When David in necessity came to Ahimelech the Priest to ask bread
for him and his men, the Priests had no common bread to give them, but this
holy bread: this bread the Priests said they might not eat of it, if they were
in via polluta, and their vessels not sanctified: by via polluta is meant here
to keep company with their wives, and by the sanctification of the vessels is
meant the sanctification of our bodies, Our bodies called our vessels.
for our bodies, are called our vessels, 1 Thessalon. 4.4. That every one of
you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor. And
that this is the meaning, it is clear by David's answer, when he says, they
have abstained from women this three days, 1 Samuel 21.

In their necessity David and his men might eat of this shewbread although
they were not Priests; and it had not been lawful for them to have eaten of
this bread if they had had any other bread; but if they had been unclean this
way, they might not have eaten this bread at all: so that there were some sorts
of legal uncleanness greater than others.

The Church of Rome err in drawing arguments from the Leviticall ceremonies.
The Church of Rome from this place goes about to prove, that ministers, because
they handle holy things, should abstain from marriage; as the Priests were to
abstain from their wives when they were to eat this holy bread, and so they
ground many other of their ordinances upon the Leviticall Law, as none might be
a Priest that had any irregularitie or defect in him, as defectus natalium, a
defect in his birth, as if he had been a bastard: or defectus persona, a
defect in his person, and a number such, which are legal ceremonies, and bind
not the Church now. Castitas abjuga conjuga.

There is duplex castitas, abjuga and conjuga; abjuga is that sort of
chastity, when a man lives chastely out of marriage; conjuga when he lives
chastely in marriage, Heb. 13.4. marriage is honorable in all, and the bed
undefiled, and if they would conclude any thing out of this place, it would but
infer thus much, the Priests abstained from this holy bread but twice in the
year, because there were four and twenty courses of them, and they served but
weekly, and so long as they served they abstained from their wives, this will
not infer their conclusion: therefore those who serve under the Gospel should
live altogether unmaried. What argument may be drawn from the Priests marriage.
This argument might be rather inverted against them this ways, the Priests
under the law were married: therefore the Priests under the Gospel may marry.

And lastly, theologia symbolica non est argumentativa, those conclusions hold
not which are deduced after this manner from types which are not destinate
types.

the Angels behold the face of God continually in glory, Mat. 18.10. So should
the Church behold the face of the Lord in his word, as in a glass, 1 Cor.
13.12. and as Zedekiahs Courtiers had this credit, to see the Kings face
always, 2 King. 25.19. So the Church should study to see the face of the Lord
continually.



EXERCITAT. XII. Of the Altar. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 2.
Exodus 27.1. And thou shall make an Altar of Shittim wood five cubits long and
five cubits broad, etc.
THere were typical Altars under the Law, and the mystical Altar Jesus
Christ, signified by them under the Gospel.

Two Altars.
The typical Altars under the Law were the Altar of burnt offering, and the
Altar of incense; the Altar of burnt offering under the Law in the Wilderness
was built of earth, The matter of the Altars.
in the Temple it was made of wood overlayd with brass; and the Altar of
incense was made of wood overlaid with gold.

Why the Altar in the Wilderness was made of earth, and not of hewn stone.
The Altar of burnt offering in the Wilderness was made of earth, and the Lord
would have it made of earth only, because he would not have it permanent, to
remain after they were gone out of the wilderness; and he would not have it
made of hewn stone, to signify, that men's inventions do but pollute the
worship of God, Exodus 20.25.

Moses Altar and Salomons, in what they agree.
The Altars of Moses Tabernacle, and Salomons Temple were the same in matter,
and form; Moses made his of Shittim wood, and Solomon made his of Cedar wood;
and the substance was all one, although different in color, and name only.

They differed in their bases, height, breadth, and length.
They differed in their bases, the proportion was double; there were two bases
of the Altar in the Tabernacle, and four in the Temple. Secondly, they
differed in height, there was a triple proportion, three, and ten, Moses Altar
was three cubits high, and Salomons Altar was ten cubits high. Thirdly, in
length and breadth, there was a fourefold proportion; the Altar of Moses was
five cubits long, and five cubits broad; and the Altar of Solomon was twenty
cubits long, and twenty cubits broad.

Solomon made all the vessels of the Temple except the Arc.
Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the Lord, the
Altar of gold, the Table of gold whereupon the shewbread was, and the
Candlestick, 1 King. 7.48. but he made not a new Arc, because Christ who was
represented by the Arc, is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever, Heb.
13.8.

Ezekiel, when he describes the new Temple, make mention of the Arc and the
Candlestick, as he does of the Altar and the Temple it self at large?

Why Ezekiel makes no mention of the Arc and Candlestick in the second
Temple.
and the light of that Candlestick was not lighted with fire from the heaven,
as in the Tabernacle and first Temple; and thus the Scriptures in wisdom do
pass many things; and out of the silence of the Scriptures we may learn
sometimes; as when the Scripture passes by Melchizedecks father and his
mother: So when the Scripture sets down the curses at large upon mount
Ebal, Why the curses in the Law are expressed, and the blessings concealed.
and the blessings are concealed; to teach us, that the Law curses us for the
breach of it, and that the blessings are reserved for the Gospel, Matthew. 5.

The golden Altar had a crown round about it, as the Arc of the Testimony
had, and the Table of shewbread.

There arose four horns from the crown of the Altar, The horns of the
golden Altar, what they signified.
every one in the form of a broach small in the top, which signified the
strength which was in Christ, who was able to overthrow that lord with two
horns, Dan. 6.8. and all the horns of the wicked, Psalm. 75.11.

It had a hole like a window in the east side, The place where they emptyed the
Altar of the ashes, was not toward the holiest of all.
to take out the ashes which fell through the grate, as the brazen Altar, and
this was upon the east side of the Altar, and not toward the holiest, to
signify that impurity should be far from the holiest of all. This golden
Altar was called the Table of the Lord, Mala. 1.7.

The Apostle, Heb. 9.4. why the Apostle makes no mention of the golden Altar,
but only of the golden censer.
makes mention of the golden censer only, and not of the golden Altar; and
this he does to signify that this was the last period of the Leviticall
service to be done away; for the last thing which the Priest did when he came
out of the Temple, was to hold up incense with his censer.

The Highpriest when he went into the holiest of all once in the year, he left
the golden censer there for the whole year, Why the Highpriest left the censer
in the holiest of all.
Heb. 9.4. to signify that this Leviticall service was to be laid down, and
that Christ's intercession indureth for ever; and the Apostle passes by all
these things without the veil, to signify that the ceremonies without the
veil were to be abolished.

The Angel appeared to Zacharias when he was offering incense.
At the right side of this Altar the Angel appeared to Zacharias, Luke 1.11.
and first he appeared to him at the time of incense, when all the rest of the
ceremonial service was ended, and when he had done all things which were
requisite in the first Tabernacle; as dressing of lamps, sacrificing, putting
bread upon the Table every Sabbath; to teach us, that now Christ was to come
when the ceremonies were drawing to an end.

Why the Angel appeared to Zacharias the father of John the Baptist.
Again, he appeared to Zacharias who was the father of John the Baptist, to
signify that now Christ was near coming, because John, Zacharias son, his
forerunner was now at hand.

Why he appeared to Zacharias an inferior Priest.
Lastly, he appeared to Zacharias an inferior Priest, and not to the Highpriest,
to signify that John should be but a servant, and one that should not think
himself worthy to loose the latchet of Christ's shoes.

The signification of the brazen Altar.
The Altar for the burnt offering was covered with brass, and it signified
Christ's passion, as the golden Altar signified his intercession; and as none
might go to the golden Altar to offer incense, but he who might go to the
brazen Altar and offer sacrifice; so we have no mediator of intercession but he
that is the mediator of our redemption. This Altar was a large Altar in
Solomon's time, twenty cubits in length and twenty in breadth: when there was
a great sacrifice upon this Altar it was filled to the corners, Zachariah
alludeth to this, they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the
Altar, Zach. 9.15.

When the Sacrifice was accepted of the Lord, they took this for a sign that
it was all turned to ashes, A sign of the acceptance of the Sacrifices
and they prayed, the Lord turn thy sacrifice to ashes, Psalm. 20.3.

This Altar had horns as the golden Altar had; The Sacrifice was tied to the
horns of the Altar.
and they that were to offer a sacrifice, delivered the beast to the Priest,
and he tied it to the horns of the Altar, and from hence he took it to the
north gate and killed it, and then the Priest cut it in so many quarters, and
laid it upon the Altar and burnt it, David alludeth to this, Psalm. 18.27. Bind
the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the Altar.

There was one border about the Altar above, and another at the foot of it,
The blood of the beasts sprinkled upon the Altar and powered under the Altar.
and there was a great ditch about the Altar where the blood of the beasts was
powered, which were killed; this blood was brought from the north gate and
sprinkled upon the horns of the Altar, and it ran down to the foot of the
Altar, into that ditch where the rest of the blood was powered, and it was all
carried through secret passages to the brook Kidron, and John alludeth to
this, Revel. 6.9. I saw under the Altar the souls of them that were slain for
the word of God.

The border went round about the foot of the Altar, that no man might fall
into this deep ditch where the blood was powered. So the Lord commanded them to
make battlements about their houses, for the safety of men, Deuteronomy. 22.8. and so
there was peribulum or a wall round about the Temple to save the people that
none fell over, because it stood upon a hill.

The Lord placed the brazen Altar in the midst of the Court, but AhaZ took it
out of the own place, How Ahaz remooved the brazen Altar.
and set it upon the north side of the Altar of Damascus, 2 King. 16.14. even
in that place where the Idol of jealousy was set up at the north gate, Ezekiel.
8.5. and here the glory of the Lord appeared at his own Altar, when he
testified unto them by his apparition, that he was to leave his Temple for
their Idolatry, Ezekiel. 8.4. this vision of Ezekiel was in atrio gentium, in the
court of the Gentiles; but when the Lord was to give sentence against them, he
came to the threshold of the door, Ezekiel. 10.4.

Why Solomon sacrificed in the middle of the Court.
Because this brazen Altar was not large enough to contain all the sacrifices,
therefore Solomon hallowed the middle of the court, where he sacrificed the
rest of the sacrifices, 1 King. 8.64. David and Solomon being Prophets and
immediately directed by the Spirit of God, David and Solomon added many things
which were not in the Tabernacle.
added somethings which were not in the Tabernacle, as David for conveniencie
caused the Priests to enter in the service of the Tabernacle when they were
twenty five years of age; whereas the Priests before did not enter in their
ministry to serve in the Tabernacle, until they were thirty years of age.
So Solomon for conveniencie hallowed the middle court for the sacrifices,
because the brazen Altar could not contain all the sacrifices at that time,
being an extra-ordinarie sacrifice.

Somethings added in the Temple for signification.
Secondly, something was added in the Temple for signification, as Solomon added
two Cherubims in the Temple which were not in the Tabernacle; to signify that
the Gentiles were to be called, and that the ministry of the Angels should be
extended to them.

Something added in it for order.
Thirdly, something was added for order, as David divided the Priests in four
and twenty orders; but none of the Kings of Judah else did the like, neither
Josias nor yet Hezekiah; because they were not Prophets, as David and Solomon
were.



The Fathers call the Table of the Lord an Altar by allusion.
The fathers by allusion called the Table of the Lord an Altar, but when they
speak this, they mean not properly of an Altar; but only they call it so,
because it carries a remembrance of that sacrifice once offered.

There are four sorts of Altars; typicum, mysticum, Four sorts of Altars.
metaphoricum, and falsum; the typical Altar, was that under the law;
mystical, as Jesus Christ, Heb. 13.10. We have an Altar whereof they have no
right to eat which serve the Tabernacle; metaphorical, as the fathers call
the Table an Altar; and the false Altar, is the Romish Altar, upon which they
would offer Christ daily, and crucify him anew again.



EXERCITAT. XIII. Of the Sacrifices in general. A ceremonial Appendix of
Command 2.
1 King. 8.62. And the King and all Israel with him offered Sacrifice before
the Lord, etc.
IN their Sacrifices they offered beasts and fowls, What they offered in their
Sacrifices.
the beasts were the Ram, the Lamb, the Bullock, and the Goat; the fowls
were the Turtle dove, the Pigeon, and the Sparrow in the sacrifice of Leprosy.

The beasts which were to be offered to the Lord, behooved to have no blemish
in them; (...) Maculatum.
in the original it is mum, which the Seventy translate (...), which is,
worthy of blame; Immaculatum, (...), that is, without blot, What is meant by
blemish.
Levit. 26.16. The man that has any blemish shall not offer to the Lord; then
he explaineth what he means by blemish; when they offered the lame, the
blind, the sick: and contrary to this is that which we call Immaculatum,
Cant. 1. Thou art fair my spouse, and there is no blemish in thee, that is,
there is no deformity in thee: mum here is not taken for a spot, as though a
spotted beast were unclean: for then the Badgers Skins which covered the
Tabernacle had been unclean; the Badger is called shesh, (...)
because it has six spots upon it, as the Hebrews mark.

They might offer nothing that was defective, or wanted any member, Nothing
which was defective or superfluous in the parts of it might be offered.
Levit. 21.25. Bovem aut ovem superstuum aut diminutum, that is, if it had a
member more, or wanted a member, they might not offer it; therefore the Hebrews
say, that when they offered Bullocks, they were Bulls and not Oxen; because no
beasts might be offered to the Lord which were lacking in their parts, Levit.
22.23. and as an Eunuch might not serve before the Lord: so neither might an
Ox be offered to the Lord. Therefore shor, bos, the Chaldee paraphrast ever
paraphraseth it thor, taurus

The blemishes that hindered a beast from being a Sacrifice.
The Jews mark that there are fifty blemishes which disable a beast from
being a sacrifice, five in the ears, three in the eye lids, six in the mouth,
eight in the eye, three in the nose, twelve in the members of generation, six
in the feet, four in any part of the body, and three beside over all the
body: and moreover the beast might not be sacrificed until it had been eight
days old, Levit. 22.27. so if it had lien with one of another kind, Levit.
19.19. or if it had killed a man, Exodus 20.28. or if it were the hyre of a
whore, or the price of a dog, Deuteronomy. 23. None of these might be offered to the
Lord.

Every Sacrifice when it was sacrificed to the Lord, Eevery Sacrifice was
changed when it was offered,
it was changed from the use in which it was before, and there was destruction
rei oblatae. If they were living things, they were killed; if they were liquid
things, they were powered out; and if they were solid things, they were bruised,
and burnt as corn: now in the mass the Papists cannot tell what destruction
is there, whether there be physica mutatio there or not: therefore they cannot
tell whether it be a sacrifice or not.

That which was living was killed and cut down, The living Sacrifice was cut
down through the backebone.
per spinam dorsi through the chain bone of the back; Heb. 4.13. all things
are naked and (...) opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do, that
is, cut up as the Sacrifice, and laid naked before him; Matthew. 24.51. (...), he
will cut him asunder, and give him his portion with hypocrites. If they be not
sacrifices now to the Lord, he will cut them like sacrifices in his wrath.

Thirdly, every Sacrifice was salted with salt, Levit. 2.13. Every Sacrifice
had salt joined with it.
And every oblation of thy meat offering shall thou season with salt; neither
shall thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy
meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shall offer salt. So Mark 9.49.
every sacrifice shall be salted with fire, this might seem at the first an
improper speech, When things are compared we must mark dilligently wherein the
comparison stands.
for if we mark not wherein the comparison stands, we may mistake it, Cant.
5.13. thy lips are like the Lilie; If the comparison be not rightly marked
we may easily be deceived, for the commendation of the lips of the Church,
Cant. 4.5. was that her lips were like Scarlet, then to make them white like
the Lilie were impertinent: therefore the comparison is here in the smell, as
before it was in the color: so Number. 12.10. Miriam was leprous as the snow, the
snow is not leprous, but the comparison stands in the color, she was white
in leprosy like the snow. So the comparison betwixt the fire and the salt is
not in the seasoning; but in the eating out of the corruption, and if they will
not this ways be salted, the Lord will salt them with another sort of fire,

They might have no leaven in their sacrifices, Levit. 2.11. except in some few
offerings of thanksgiving, Levit. 7.13. to signify that the Lord would
graciously accept of our service although mixed with many infirmities which in
his mercy he pardons in Christ, 1 Ioh. 8.9.

But in all other sacrifices he forbids both honey, and leaven; he
forbids honey as well as leaven: the ground of this is natural, because
honey fermenteth as leaven; this leaven figured sin of all sorts both in
doctrine and manners, Luke 12.1. Matthew. 16.6. 1 Cor. 5.8. purge out the old
leaven, that is, corruption in manners.

A Table of the Sacrifices. In the burnt offering the fat and the blood the
Lords, the flesh all burnt, and the skin the Priests.

The Priest got no part of that sin-offering whose blood was sprinkled upon the
golden Altar.

In other sin offerings where the blood was sprinkled but upon the brazen
Altar, the fat and the blood were the Lords, and the flesh belonged to the
Priest.

The sin offering had no meat offering or drink offering.

In the peace offering the fat and the blood the Lords, the breast and the
right shoulder the Priests, and the rest belonged to the offerer.

In the meatoffering a han^full of the flower, a little of the salt, oil,
incense, and wine offered, and the Priest got the rest.

Sacrifices of praise so^e were to b^eaten before the Lord, some in Jerusalem,
and some at home.

The offering of Jealousy had no incense in it.

No Sacrifice without Salt.

EXERCITAT. XIIII. Of the Sacrifices in particular, and first of the burnt
offering. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 2.
Levit. 1.2. If his offering be a burnt offering, etc.
THere were some sacrifices which were commanded by the Lord, and some which
were voluntary sacrifices, as free will offerings, and such.

The sacrifices which were commanded, ordinary and instituted by God, were
five, First, the burnt offering commanded here in Levit. 1. Secondly, the
meatofferings in Levit. 2. Thirdly, the peace offerings, Fourthly, sin
offerings in Levit. 4. And lastly, trespass offering in Levit. 5.15.

Of the daily Sacrifice.
Their daily burnt offering was a Lamb offered morning and evening, Why it was
called continual.
and this was furnished at the charges of the common treasury of the Temple,
and not by any particular man. It was called Sacrificium juge, the continual
Sacrifice, because it was offered twice every day without intermission, and
although other things have this word tamid, continual, joined with them as the
continual bread, Number. 4.7. the continual incense, Exodus 30.8. (...) put for
the daily Sacrifice.
the continual meat offering, Number. 8.16. yet commonly the daily burnt offering
is meant here, as Dan. 8.11. and by him (hattamid) the daily was taken away,
that is, the daily sacrifice.

The burnt offering was a sacrifice which was all burnt to ashes except the
skin and intrals, (...) Holocaustum a (...) ascendere (...) Sacrificium totum
igne consumendum interdum iungitur cum (...) ut Psalm. 51.12 et significat
perfectum sacrificium a (...) perfecit, absolvit.
it was called gnolah from gnalah ascendere, and it was called ignitum Iehovae,
quia igni consumendum, because it was all to be burnt with fire, Levit. 1. and
it had calil joined with it, Psalm 51. which comes from calal to consume:
calil is nor the adjective joined to gnola, for they disagree in gender but
calil here signifies mincha, or the meat offering which was joined to the
burnt offering.

In this burnt offering they were to offer a Bullock, What was offered in the
burnt offering.
a Ram, a Lamb amongst the beasts; or a turtle Dove or young pigeon of the
fowls, and it behoved to be a male and not a female, and likewise it behoved
to be without blemish, to signify that purity and perfection which was in
Christ, and our perfection in him, Heb. 9.13. How much more shall the blood of
Christ, What the burnt offering signified.
who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge
your consciences from dead works to serve the living God? It behoved to be of
the best things and the choice of the flock, to teach us to honor God with
our substance, Prover. 3.9. and to serve him with a perfect heart, 1 Chro. 28.9,

When they offered their sacrifices they kept this order. First, The order
which they keep in brning their sacrifices.
after the beast was killed and laid upon the Altar to be burnt, the offerer
brought fine flower mixed with salt and oil, (for they might not mix the
flower with water) and this part of the Sacrifice was properly called
Immolatio, Immolare.
then he gave this to the Priest who laid it upon the head of the Sacrifice,
and this was called mactatio by the Latins, that is, Mactare.
magis aucta and victima macta. Thirdly, the Priests powered wine upon the
Sacrifice which was to be burnt; and this was called Libatio, and the Apostle
alludeth to this, Libare.
when he says, 2 Timothy, 4.6. I am libor, now I am ready to be offered up.
Fourthly, Incense was superadded to these, Suffire.
and this was called Suffitus, Ephe. 5.2. Christ has given himself for us an
offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor. Lastly, when the
Sacrifice was burning, they offered their spiritual Sacrifice with it, Litare.
and this was called Litare, precibus a Deo aliquid impetrare, they prayed unto
the Lord that he would accept of their Sacrifice; therefore their Sacrifices
were called Sacrificia vociferationis, Sacrifices of shouting, Psalm. 27.6.

Of the meat Offering.
What was offered in the meat offering.
THe meat offering consisted of things without life, as of fine flower, oil and
incense, Levit. 2.2. things which were necessary for the use of man were
offered here to the Lord, as bread to eat, wine to drink, salt to season,
oil to cure, and incense to delight the smell. So Christ our meat offering is
all these to us.

Mincha accessorium perse.

They had two sorts of meat offering, Mincha aceessorium and mincha per se.
Mincha accessorium was that which was always joined with another Sacrifice,
and a handful of it was burnt, and the rest was the Priests; but that which
was Mincha per se which was offered for the Priests, was wholly; burnt and not
eaten, Levit. 6.23.

The flower in the meat offering was the best flower.
The flower which was offered in the meat offering behooved to be simila pura,
fine flower, without any branne; which signified the pure estate of Christ and
all Christians in him.

Cor 1.21. He that established us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is
God. So 1 Ioh. 2.27. the anointing which ye have received of him abides in
you.

Ephesians. 5.2. Christ has given himself for us an offering and a Sacrifice to
God for a sweet smelling savor.

Sometimes it was baked, and sometimes fried in a pan, David alludeth to this,
Psalm 45.2. My heart has fried or boiled a good matter.

Every Sacrifice had this Mincha joined with it, The meat offering oftentimes
put for all the Sacrifices.
except the sin offering, and therefore oftentimes it is put for any
Sacrifice, as Psalm. 20. The Lord remember all thy [mincha] meat offerings, that
is, all thy Sacrifices.

Of the peace offering.
THe peace offering was a Sacrifice of thanksgiving for the saftie of the
offerer, A part of the peace offering due to God, a part to the Pri sts, and a
part to the offerer.
and one part of it was due to God, one to the Priest, one to the offerer, Amos
5.5. I will not accept of the fat of your offerings, that is, of your peace
offerings: David called this fat the burnt offerings of fatlings. That which
was the most excellent in every thing the Hebrews called it the fat, as adeps
frumenti the fat of the corn; medulla tritici, the marrow of the wheat,
Ecclus. 47.2. as the fat was taken away from the peace offering, so was David
chosen out amongst the children of Israel; David and the fat of the peace
offering, all the peace offering was the Lords, yet all was not offered to him,
but a part was given to the Priests, and a part to the people, but the fat was
fully burnt up to the Lord. So the zeal of Gods house burnt up David, as the
fat of the Sacrifice.

The fat was due only to God, The fat was the Lords.
the peoples part was but a lean part; but under the G^spel, Esaias. 25.6. I
will make the people a feast of fat things and full of marrow, the people might
eat none of the marrow under the Law.



L^vit. 3.17. It shall be a statute for ever throughout your dwellings, The fat
of the Sacrifice might not be eaten or used to any other use.
that ye eat no fat nor blood. The fat of the beasts which were not
sacrificed might be taken to any other use, but they might not eat any of it,
Levit. 7.24. the fat of the beast that dies of it self, or that which is
torn, may be used in any other use, but ye shall in no wise eat of it.

The feast of the peace offering.
The rest of the peace offering was divided betwixt the Priest and the people,
and they made a feast of it, 1 Samuel 9.24. Solomon alludeth to it, Prove. 17.1.
better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith, than a house full of
Sacrifices with strife. The Sacrifice put for the feast afetr the Sacrifice,
Antecedens pro eonsequente.
The Sacrifice here is put for the banquet which was after the Sacrifice, and
it was this which David meant of, when he said, there is a yearly sacrifice
there for all the family, 1 Samuel 20 6. that is, a feast after the Sacrifice.

The breast and the shoulder due to the Priest.
The breast and the right shoulder of the peace offering was due to the Priest;
and the rest was due to the offerers; it is said of the sons of Eli, that
they sent their boys, and pulled the flesh out of the Caldron, 1 Samuel 2. that
is, they would not be content with that which was due to them, the breast and
the shoulders; but they would have the peoples part also, and they would not
stay until the fat was offered to the Lord, 1 Samuel 2.15.

Saul to eat of it, seeing it was the Priests part, 1 Samuel 9.24.



Why the Priest got the shoulder.
The Priest got the breast and the shoulder; he got the shoulder to signify
that he carried the burden of the people; Why he got the breast.
can I carry all this people upon my shoulders (says Moses) Number. 11.11.
Wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest all the burden
of this people upon me? and he got the breast to signify his compassion and
love to the people, Number. 11.12. Have I begotten them, that they should say unto
me, carry them in thy bosom. Esaias. 40.11. He shall feed his flock like a
sheepherd, and he shall gather his lambs with his arm, and carry them in his
bosom, and lead these that are with young.

The Highpriest carried the names of the twelve Tribes upon his breast, to
signify his compassion; Why the Highpriest carried the names of the Tribes
upon his breast and shoulder.
and he carried their names engraven in Onyx stones upon his shoulders, to
signify that he carried the burden of the people: Eli when he looked upon
Hanna, and saw her lips moving, he said she was drunk, 1 Samuel 1.13. here there
was no pity in the Priests breast to the poor woman, but 2 King. 4.26.
Elisha a man of pity.
Elisha had more pity in his breast, when he said to Gehazi, run now I pray
thee, and say, is it well with thee? and when she came to the man of God she
caught him by the feet, but Gehazi thrust her away, but the man of God said,
let her alone, for her soul is vexed within her: Churlish Gehazi had no pity
upon the poor woman, but there was much pity and compassion in the heart of
Elisha the man of God.

The peace offering was divided betwixt God, Why God, the Priests, and the
people, had a part in the offering.
the Priests, and the people; God got the chief part, because he it is who
pardons the sin. The Priest got his part, because he is the instrument to
make intimation of this pardon; and the people got their part, to teach them to
be thankful for the remission of sin.

God got his part, and the people got theirs, what a comely thing was this to
see the Lord sitting at his Table, Mala. 1.7. therefore the fat of the
Sacrifice is called his bread, Levit. 3.11. and Number. 28.2. and to be (...)
inviting his children to dine with him, he will not eat his morsels alone,
Job. 31.17. what a comely thing was this to see his children standing like
Olive plants round about his Table, Psalm. 128.3. and how pleasant was it to see
brethren dwell together in unity, God sat as it were the Master of the feast,
in the peace offering.
Psalm. 132.1. and their father sitting at the head of the Table. The Heathen
said of old that (...) erant (...) sine patre, that the feast when it wanted
the father it wanted the head.

A bad division of the peace offering.
The peace offering was divided betwixt God and the Priest, and the people, but
the whore said, Prove. 7. that she had her peace offerings by her, and she
invited her lover to them: was not this a strange sharing or division for God
to get a part, the Priest to get a part, and the whore, and the whoremonger to
get a share; but the Lord will not share with such.

This feast which was adjoined to the Sacrifices was a feast of joy, The feast
joined to the peace offering was a feast of mirth.
Deuteronomy. 16.15. Iud. 21.19. wherein they danced, and it figured our spiritual
mirth and joy for our redemption by Christ. The Idolaters kept this feast to
the golden Calfe which they should have kept to the Lord.

When they offered their spiritual Sacrifices with their external Sacrifices,
then the Lord was much delighted with them, and he says, I have eaten my honey
and my honeycombe, I have drunken my wine and my milk, Cant. 5.1. and he took
such pleasure in these feasts, that he invited the Church his spouse to come
and eat, O friends drink, yea drink abundantly, O beloved. But when their
Sacrifices wanted the inward Sacrifice, then the Lord said, that they offered
but flesh unto him, Hose. 8.13. (...) putridi facti sunt.
then he loathed them but as rotten flesh, Nehelahhu, putridi facti sunt,
Psalm. 14.3. they are become rotten and stinking, and he continues in the
metaphor; they are like wine that has lost the taste, which is called vinum
fugiens: (...) omnis recessit, vinum sugiens.
when these outward Sacrifices wanted the inward, see how unpleasant they were
to the Lord, Esaias. 1. I am full of the burnt offerings of Rams, and the fat of
the fed beasts I delight not in, nor in the blood of Lambs, of Bullocks, or of
Goats: then he comes to his smell, Outward Sacrifices without the inward are
offensive to all Gods senses.
verse. 13, Incense is abomination to me, then to his touch, verse. 14. your new
moons and your appointed feasts I am weary to bear them, then to his
hearing, when ye make many prayers I will not hear them, then to his sight,
ver. 15. I will hide mine eyes from them. Their Sacrifices were offensive to
all Gods senses.

Of the sin-offering.
THe burnt offering was for all sins in general, (...) Josephus Lib. 3.
Antiq. Cap. 10.
the peace offering was a thanksgiving for sins remitted, and the
sin-offering was for sins committed, for which they craved pardon; the
sin-offering was either hhataah or asham, the first the Seventy translate
(...), and the second (...), the first were (...), and the second (...).

The Sacrifice which was for the sins of ignorance or (...), might ascend or
descend, that is it was more or less according to the worth of the offerer,
Levit. 5.7. the poor might offer a pottle of flower; and the rich were to
offer according to their ability: but in the offering which was for a willing
sin, the Sacrifice did neither ascend nor descend, it was alike in all. So in
the punishment of sin, in some sins the punishment ascended and descended,
Exodus 21.28. if a man had kept a pushing Ox, and he had killed a man, he was
to dye for it: or the punishment might descend, Sacrificium ascensionis.
descensionis.

if a sum of money was laid upon him, then he might redeem his life; here
the punishment was ascending and descending: but if a man had killed a man
willingly, then the punishment non ascendebat aut descendebat, but he was to
die for it.

In the sin-offering there was no oil or incense, neither in the Sacrifice of
Jealousy; No Incense in the sin-offering, or in the offering of Jealousy.
because there was nothing acceptable to the Lord in these Sacrifices.

Observe that there was a Sacrifice for original sin, Leviti. 12. (...) in
errore.
there was a Sacrifice for sin of error (bishgagah, in errore) and there was
a Sacrifice for sins of ignorance; but there was no Sacrifice for wilful
sins, There was a Sacrifice for all sins except for wilful sins.
Heb. 10.36. for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the
knowledge of the truth, there remains no more Sacrifice for sins: Christ
prays for sins of ignorance, Lord forgive them, for they know not what they
do, Luke 23.34. Let us pray then with David to keep us from presumptouus
sins, that they have not dominion over us, Psalm. 19.13.

There are several sorts of Sacrifices prescribed for several sorts of
sinners as for the Priest, Sacrifices according to the persons.
for the Prince, and for the whole people, and for a private man.

For the Priest was a young Bullock without blemish, The Sacrifice for the
Priest.
which he offered for himself, and here we are taught, if the Highpriest under
the Law might err, then the Pope may err as Pope; what privilege has he to
be exempted from error more than the Highpriest had? The Highpriest might err.
and if they say, because he is the Highpriest under the Gospel, therefore he
cannot err, but now there is no Highpriest under the Gospel but Jesus Christ,
Who by his own blood entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption for us, Heb. 9.12.

If the Highpriests sin made the people to sin; he was to offer a Bullock,
Levit. 4.3. observe the phrase, Lehashmath, (...) in reatam populi.
that is, if he make the people sin by his evil example, so Ioab said to
David when he caused him to number the people, why will thou be (lehashamah) a
cause of trespass to Israel, 1 Chro. 21.3.

Secondly, for the whole people, The visible Church may err.
and they were to offer a young Bullock, Levit. 4.13. which was the same with
the Priests Sacrifice; and here observe, The sinoffering of the whole people.
that the whole visible Church may err, otherwise the Lord would not have
appointed a Sacrifice for the error of the whole people.

The Sacrifice of the Priest and the Sacrifice of the whole people was one, to
teach us, how great the sin of the Highpriest was.

Aaron who made the golden Calfe?

Aaron did it through infirmity, Why the people more severely punished than
Aaron for making the golden Calfe.
but the people did it willingly and wittingly.

Thirdly the Sacrifice of the Ruler was a male of the kids of the Goats, and
the Sacrifice of any particular common man was a female of the kids of the
Goats, Levit. 4.23.28.



Solon was commended that he made no Law for him who killed his father; he
thought none would be so wicked as to commit such a fact, and he was thought
to have done more wisely in that, Why the Lord set down but one sort of
Sacrifices for all sins done wittingly.
not to inhibite that which had not been practiced, lest he should seem not
so much to forbid this sin, as to incite men to it by his prohibition; So the
Lord would not set down several sorts of Sacrifices, and Laws for several
sorts of willing sins; lest the corrupt nature of man by these inhibitions
should take occasion to sin the more, he sets down but one sort of
Sacrifice for all sins of knowledge, the servant who knows his masters will
and does it not shall be beaten with many stripes, Luke 12.47. the vessels that
could not be purged by fire were broken, Levit. 7.

Two sorts of sin offerings.
There were two sorts of sin offerings. First those sin offerings, whose blood
was not carried into the holy place, and sprinkled seven times before the veil
upon the golden Altar, but was only sprinkled upon the brazen Altar, and of
these the Priests might eat, therefore the Priests are said to eat the sins
of the People, Hos. 4.8. that is, the Sacrifice for sin. So Moses was angry
with Eleazar and Ithamar, What sinoffering the Priests might eat and what not.
because they did not eat the sin-offering; then he explaineth what
sin-offering it was, Levit. 10.18. Behold the blood of it was not brought in,
within the holy place, ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place as I
commanded you.

But the sin-offering whose blood was carried in within the holy place, the
flesh of it was carried without the Camp and burnt, and the Priests might eat
none of that, Levit. 6.30.

The allegorical, tropologicall and anagogicall application of the
sin-offering.
The carrying of the sin-offering without the camp had an allegorical
application, a tropologicall application, and an anagogicall application. The
allegorical application was this, that Christ should suffer without the gate
of Jerusalem; the tropologicall signification the Apostle makes, Heb. 13. if
the Jews stand to the ceremonial Law, they cannot be partakers of the blood
of Christ, and he reasons this ways.

The people got nothing of that which was burnt without the gate, according to
the Leviticall Law, Heb. 13 11.

But Jesus Christ the sin-offering was burnt without the gate.

The Jews who stand to the ceremonial Law, have no part in Christ.
Therefore if the Jews stand to the Leviticall Law they can have no part in
Christ.

And here the Apostle reasons with them out of their own grounds, as Christ
does with the Sadduces out of the five books of Moses, which they only
admitted, Matthew. 22.23.

The anagogicall applycation is this, that we have not here a permanent City,
but seek for one to come, Heb. 13.14.

They were commanded to lay their hand upon the head of the sin-offering,
Levit. 4. Why they laid their hand upon the head of the Sacrifice.
to signify that they laid over their sins upon the beast, which was a type
of Christ who was made (asham) an offering for sin, Esaias. 53.10. and the
Apostle, 1 Cor. 5.21. he made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that is,
the guilt of our sins was imputed unto him; he was not made a Sacrifice only
for our sins, but he was made sin for us; mark here a double opposition,
first, he who knew no sin, was made sin; Secondly, Christ was made sin
for us and then a Sacrifice.
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him: now it cannot be
said, that he who knew no sacrifice was made a Sacrifice for sin, that we
might be a Sacrifice of righteousness to God in him; but this ways, he who
knew no sin was made sin, that is, our sin was imputed to him, that we
might be accounted as righteous before God in him; and therefore although this
by consequence be inferred, that he was made a Sacrifice for our sins; yet it
is not the proper meaning of the place; after that the guilt of our sins was
laid upon him, then he was made a Sacrifice for our sins.

And here we have a notable place to clear that imputed righteousness, which
is imputed unto us; Christ righteousness imputed to us as our sins were
imputed to him.
as the beast when it was killed, the guilt was laid upon it typically, which
had no sin in it; So all our sins were imputed to Christ who had no sin
in himself; and we reason thus, as our sin was imputed to Christ who had no
sin in himself: So Christ's righteousness is imputed to us who have no
righteousness in ourselves.



We are not capable of inherent righteousness.
We are no more capable of inherent righteousness to justify us before God
then Christ was capable of inherent sin; our sanctification is not perfect
sanctification, which is able to stand before the Lord to justify us.

Of the trespass offering.
A Trespass offering was a Sacrifice for sins of omission, or sins of
ignorance, these sins were (...), (...) pallium.
Levit. 5.15. if a soul commit a trespass and sin through ignorance, in the
Hebrew it is, timgnol magnal, as if a man were blindfolded with a cloak cast
about him, for megnil is a cloak, these sins the Apostle calls (...),
errors done of ignorance, Hebr. 9.7.

Agere ex ignorantia ignorantor.

But here we must distinguish betwixt sins done of ignorance, and sins done
ignorantly. This Sacrifice was for sins done of ignorance, but not for sins
done ignorantly. difference of sins done of ignorance and sins done
ignorantly.
Sins done of ignorance were those which proceeded merely of ignorance; but
sins done ignorantly, were those sins which were committed ignorantly, but
ignorance was not the cause of them, as when a man in drunkenness killed a
man, he does it ignorantly, but not of ignorance, because he wilfully was
drunken, which drew on his ignorance; here his drunkenness and his ignorance
were essentially joined together, but there are other sins which are but
accidentally joined together, as drunkenness, and whoredom, for all that are
drunk commit not whoredom, neither all that commit whoredom are drunk.

EXERCITAT. XV. Of the Priests apparel. A ceremonial appendix of Command 2.
Exodus 28.2. And thou shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory
and beauty.
THe Priests were clothed in linen when they served in the Sanctuary, Ezekiel.
44.17. The Priests might we are no wool in the Sanctuary.
And it shall come to pass, that when they shall enter in at the gates of the
inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments, and no wool shall
come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

First, the shame of our nakedness that it do not appear, Reve. 3.18. they
had linen coats reaching down to their feet; linen signifies
righteousness in the Scripture, Revel. 19.8. therefore David prays Psalm.
132.9. Let thy Priests be clothed with righteousness.

When they were in the Sanctuary they wore only linen, and out of the
Sanctuary they wore wool, The Jews called a worldly minded Priest the man
with the woollen cloathe.
the Jews had a proverb, when they saw a worldly minded Priest, they used to
say, there goes the man with the woollen clothes, because he minded nothing
his linen clothing, his Sanctification and righteousness.

These clothes reached down to their feet, and therefore Christ our
Highpriest appeared having (...) and clothed with a garment down to the
feet, Revel. 1.13. Moreover they had a linen girdle which signified truth and
constancy in Christ's administration, Esaias. 22. 21. And I will cloth him with
thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, Ephe. 6.14. stand therefore
having your loins girt about with truth, the garments were common to the
Highpriest with the rest of the Priests.

The Highpriest had some ornaments that were proper to himself, first a robe
of blew with bells, an Ephod of Gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen, a
breastplate, a Miter of sine linen, a plate of pure gold upon his forehead.

The Highpriest had garments proper to himself, therefore in the second Temple
when the Highpriests wanted the anointing oil, when they saw the Highpriest,
they said not; there goes the anointed of the Lord; (...) multiplicatis
vestibus.
but there goes the man with the many clothes, merubha begadim.

He had a broydered girdle which he wore about his paps, therefore Christ is
said to be girt about the paps with a golden girdle, The Priests might not
wear their girdle but about their breasts.
Reve. 1.13. So the seven Angels came out of the Temple having their breasts
girded with golden girdles, Reve. 15.6. and Ezekiel. 44.18. the Priests were
forbidden to gird themselves in the sweating places, that is, about their
loins.

Esaias. 11.5. righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
faithfulness the girdle of his reins, therefore it may seem that he wore his
girdle about his middle.

Why Christ was girt about the loins and reins.
to signify, that there was no concupisence in Christ here, or sinful lust;
and he was girt about the paps with a golden girdle to signify that his heart
was holy and pure without sin.

He had a plate of gold upon his forehead, and holiness to the Lord written in
it, and therefore he was called the Saint of the Lord, Psalm. 106.16. The plate
of gold.
This plate had holiness to the Lord written in it, but Zachariah prophesied
that holiness to the Lord shall be written upon the bridles of the horses,
Zach. 14.20. that is, there shall be such holiness under the Gospel that the
meanest shall have holiness written upon his forehead, as the Priests had
under the Law.

These priestly ornaments signified Christ's Kingly, The signification of the
Highpriests garments.
Priestly, and Prophetical office, his Kingly office was typed by his Crown
which he wore, his Priestly office was signified by the breastplate upon which
he carried the names of the twelve Tribes, and Vrim and Thummim; the Priest did
two things, as the Apostle speaks, Heb. 5.1. (...) and (...), things which
pertained to God, and things which pertained to us: the things which he did
from God to us, were represented by Vrim and Thummim, and the things which he
did from us to God were represented by the breastplate w,herein he carried the
twelve stones, and his prophetical office was signified by his bells.

The priestly garment was put upon Aaron by Moses; The disaraying of Aaron,
what it meant.
and yet Moses is commanded to strippe Aaron of them, and disaray him. The
taking off of his garments, and putting them upon Eleazar, signified the taking
awas of his office and giving it to another. So when Eliakim was clothed with
Shebnas robe, Esaias. 22.15. it signified that his office should be taken from
him, and given to Eliakim. So the stripping of Aaron signified the disanulling
of the Priesthood for the weakness thereof, Heb. 7.14. and when he was stripped
of his Priestly garments for his sins which he had committed, Number. 20.12. he
and all the people were taught to expect a better Priesthood of the same of God
who is perfected for evermore, Heb. 7.28. and this priesthood was continued
from Aaron to Eleazar, and from him to Phinehas, and had no end until Christ
came, who was a Priest after the order of Melchizedeck, the true Eleazar, the
help of God.

The garments which the Priest wore when he went into the holiest of all.
The Highpriest had other garments which he wore when he entered into the holiest
of all upon the day of expiation, he was all clothed in white, and having
finished his service that day, he laid aside these clothes and never wore them
any more, and Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle of the congregation, and
shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy
place, and shall leave them there, Lev. 16.23. The Highpriest laid aside all
his ornaments that day when he went into the holiest of all, to signify unto
us, that the Leviticall Priesthood was to be laid aside, and also that Christ
would give up his Kingdom to his Father, 1 Cor. 15.24. that is, he would not
exercise the function of a mediator any more in the Church, and that he would
give up his personal kingdom, but not his eternal kingdom.

The Sacrifices and ceremonies under the Law had relation to Christ.
All the Ceremonies and Sacrifices under the Law had relation to Christ, they
were but the shadow, and he was the body.

To his conception.
First the Nazarite must be sanctified in his mothers womb, to signify that
Jesus the true Nazarite should be conceived without sin in the womb of the
Virgin.

To his natures.
Secondly, his two natures were signified by the Goat that was killed, and the
scape-Goate, and by the two Sparrowes, the one killed, and the other let go.
So by the Angels ascending and descending upon the Ladder, the Angels ascending
signifying his Godhead whom they all ascend to honor; and descending to
minister unto him as man.

To his birth.
In his birth Mary offered for herself and for her Son, to signify that he
became legally unclean for us to purge our uncleanness.

His offices, King, Priest, and Prophet, To his offices.
typed by the Highpriests garments and ornaments.

His death by the Sacrifices, To his death.
and his lifting up upon the Cross by the brazen Serpent, his burial by Jonas
living in the Whales belly three days, his resurrection by the firsts, and
therefore he is called the first fruits of them that slept, 1 Cor. 15.20. and
the fifty days betwixt the first harvest and the gathering of the full
harvest, signified the fifty days betwixt Christ's resurrection, and the
coming down of the holy Ghost upon the Apostles.

EXERCITAT. XVI. The Lord would not have his Priests use the customs of the
Heathen Priests. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 2.
Exodus 20.26. Thou shall not go up by steps upon mine Altar.
THe Israelits learned Idolatry in Egypt, and their Pappes were bruised, Ezekiel
23.3. and the Prophet Jeremiah calls Egypt a very fair Heifer, Cap. 46.20.
who was lascivious and wanton, following Idolatry, and therefore was called,
great in flesh, Ezekiel. 16.26. (...) sive (...) aestro exagitor, aestro velut
immisso concito ab (...) asilus, aestrus, metaphorice stimulus.
And Israel followed Egypt who was like a backesliding heifer, Hos. 11.6. the
Seventy translate it, (...), like a Heifer stung with Hornets, who runs here
and there: so did they after their Idols; therefore he threatens, that he will
feed them as a lamb in a large place, that is, he would send the ten Tribes
to captivi^ie, where they should have liberty enough to run as they pleased.

The Lord would not have them to imitate the beastly Priests of the Moabites.
When the Israelites were coming out of Egypt, traveling toward Canaan, the
Lord forbids them to follow the beastly Idolatry of the Moabites, to
discover their nakedness, as their Priests did; and for this cause that they
should not go up by steps, or degrees upon the Altar; for their clothes were
short when they traveled through the Wilderness with the ambulatory
Tabernacle, and if they had ascended by steps upon the Altar, their nakedness
might have been seen.

Priapus what.
This filthy Idolatry of the Moabites was the worshipping of Baal-peor who was
also called Priapus. This Priapus was a young man in Hellespont, who was
expelled out of the country as a corrupter of the youth. He went into Greece,
where afterward, beastly and filthy persons made a god of him, Priapus the God
of the Moabites.
The Moabites made choice of him also for their god, and he was called
Baal-peor, because he was made with his nakedness discovered. this Idol was
also called miphlezeth, 1 King. 15.13. Horrenda statua, and Idolum pudoris,
Hos. 11.9. and 9.10. and like unto this worship was that worship of Tammuz,
Ezekiel. 8. with their (...) and (...).

The Moabites choose a filthy God like unto themselves.
Was not this strange that they could imagine that their gods and their
goddesses were such? but we are not to admire this; for even as the Atheist,
that he may sin the more securely, fained to himself that there is not a
God: so the unclean and filthy man imagines a god like unto himself, Psalm,
50.21. because I kept silence thou thoughtest that altogether I was such a one
as thy self they who write of the Ethiopians, say, that they paint the Angels
black, and the Devils white; they paint the Angels black, because they are
black themselves; they think the black color the most comely color, and
the white the most uncomely color. So these filthy Moabites made choice of a
god like unto themselves; and as their god Baal-peor was a filthy god, so were
his Priests filthy Priests, in showing their nakedness. The more modest
amongst the heathen thought it a filthy thing to show their nakedness, and
therefore they said, Caro pro pudendis, honestatis causa.
in scaenam sine subligaculo nemo prodeat, and as they had a filthy god, and
filthy Priests; so they had a filthy Sacrifice, they offered an Ass to
Priapus, which was a beast of great flesh, Ezekiel. 23.20.

Afterward this filthy Idol was called by the Latins Deus hortorum, Priapus
called Deus hortorum, and why.
because they used to commit such filthiness in gardens; and therefore they
used this word hortum in re amorum, when they spoke of filthy and unchaste lust.

Quod meus hortus habet, sumas impune, licebit,
Si dederis nobis, quod tuus hortus habet.
And when they would insinuate their filthy lusts, they say, laegere olera,
legere nuces, legere poma. Propertius.
Cum quibus Idaeo legisti poma sub antro,
and so Virgilius. Malo me Galataea petit, lasciva puella.

The Lord commanded his Priests to wear (...), side garments reaching to their
feet, and also breeches under them.

The Moabites are called the people of Chamos, Number. 21.30. and Ier. 48. hence
comes the Greek word (...), and the Apostle alludeth to this, Romans 13.13.
(...).
(...), not in rioting, and drunkenness.

because they changed the glory of the uncorruptible god, into an image made
like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourefooted beasts, and creeping
things; wherefore God gave them also to uncleanness, and to vile affections,
Romans 1.23.

EXERCITAT. XVII. That a woman might not wear a man's apparel. A ceremonial
appendix of Command. 2.
Deuteronomy. 22.5. The woman shall not wear that which pertains to the man.
THe Lord knowing how prone his people were to Idolatry, made a partition wall
betwixt them and the Gentiles; and he would have them opposite to the Gentiles
in their ceremonial worship.

Vide Analyzes Iunij in Levit.
First, the Egyptians eat only swines flesh; therefore ye shall be opposite to
them, ye shall not eat the flesh of the Hog; they worshipped the Ox and the
Sheep, therefore ye shall eat them, and sacrifice them.

Secondly, in their apparel; the Priests of Isis did wear linen, and wool,
therefore ye shall wear linen only or wool only, and not linsey wolsey.

The Jews opposite to the Gentiles in the manner of their worship.
Thirdly, the Egyptians had (...) to save them from evils, therefore the Lord
commanded his people to wear phylacteries.

Fourthly, in the manner of their worship; they when they worshipped they
looked toward the sun rising, but ye shall be contrary to them, and turn
your faces toward the Arc, which stood in the west end of the Temple.

It is a question whether this belongs to the seventh Commandment or to the
second. The most hold, that it belongs to the seventh Commandment, This is
rather an appendix of the second commandment than of the seventh.
to teach men and women modesty; but if we will consider the words of the Law
more nearly, and the practice of the heathen, it may seem rather to be an
appendix of the second Commandment; In more nebuchim part, 3.
for this word (...). abomination, is spoken usually in the Scripture of
Idolatry, and Maimone shows, that it was the manner of Idolatrous men to
stand with the imbrodered garments of women upon them, before the star Venus,
and the women put upon them men's armor, and stood before the star Mars, and
therefore it may seem that the Lord expressly forbids the woman to put upon
her [Celi] the armor of a man: Why women forbidden to put on men's armor.
and if it were forbidden only to eschew filthiness, why would the Lord
forbid women to put on men's armor, (...)
and the men to put on women's clothes rather then the man's clothes, putting
Celi and Shimlath. And Julius Firmicus writing of the Idolatrous customs of
the Assyrians, says, that they worshipped Venus, Men worshipped Venus with
women's clothes, and women in men's armor.
and that it was not lawful to the Idolatrous Priests to worship her, nisi
effaeminent vultum, and virilem sexum ornatu dedecorarent; unless they changed
their countenance, and fained their sex, and disgraced themselves, The
ceremonies made a distinction betwixt the Jews and Gentiles.
putting on women's apparel upon them.

And the Lord in all these ceremonials made a distinction betwixt the Jews and
the Gentiles, rather than betwixt the male and female.



The females circumcised in the males.
but it distinguished not the male from the female; for the females were
circumcised in the males, Genesis 34.14. we cannot give our sister to one that is
uncircumcised; the ceremonies were instituted then to make a distinction
betwixt the Jews the people of God, and the Heathen.

Commandment III. EXERCITAT. XVIII. Of the Nazarites vow.
Number. 6.2. When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a
Nazarite, etc.
THere were three sorts of things separated to the Lord, first the land every
seventh year was separated to him: Secondly, the first fruits were Nazarites
to the Lord, in the original it is, ginnebhe nezirecha vuae separationis, (as
the Seventy translate it) or sanctificationis tuae (as the Chaldee paraphrast
has it) and thirdly, Three sorts of things separated to God.
was nazareatus personae a separation of persons to God.

(...)
A separation of persons again was either of men or women, Number. 6.2. women
Nazarits, as Sampsons Mother was a Nazarit, Nazareatus terra fructuum
personaram.

when they vowed themselves this ways Nazarits, they were said [Iaphli] to do
some admirable or rare thing.

(...) admirable esse.
So Nazarits according to their ages, as they were adulti, Nazaraus adultus
juvenis. p^rvulus.

Iuvenes or parvuli; young men, as Amos, 2.11. they gave the Nazarits wine to
drink, or little ones, as Samuel.

Nazaraus seculi dierum.

Nazarits again were either Nazaraei saeculi or Nazaraei diaerum; Nazaraei
seculi were those who were perpetual Nazarits and might not be redeemed, nor
change their vow; such as were Samuel Sampson, John the Baptist and James, as
Clemens testifies, these Nazarits some of them were separated to the Lord by
the vow of their mother, as Samuels mother vowed him a Nazarite from his
conception, min nagnaro, as soon as he stirred in his mothers belly.

The Child shall be a Nazarite from the womb to the day of his birth, Judge.
13.7. that is, (...) a (...) movere
from the time of his conception, and from the time of his birth; but when it
is said, Act. 3.2. he was lame from his mothers womb, here both the time of
his conception and his birth are comprehended. So Galat. 1.15. who separated me
from my mothers womhe, that is, from the time that my mother conceived me. So
Psalm. 22.10. I was cast upon thee from the the womb, that is, from the time
that she conceived me. So Iere. 1.6. Psalm, 58.3. the wicked are estranged from
the womb they go astray as soon as they be borne, here from the womb
signified the time from their conception.

Nazzaaei dierum were those who vowed themselves a time only, but after the
time was expired, they were no more Nazarites.

The vow of the voluntary Nazarit lasted but thirty days, as the Jews gather;
Mamone of his treatise of entering into the sanctuary, Cap. sect. 8.14.
Absolon polled his head the thirtieth day of his vow, so did the voluntary
Nazarite, say they, and the inferior priests shaved their heads every
thirtieth day.

Those who were separated to be Nazarits were commanded to abstain from three
things; first from wine, secondly, from touching of the dead; and thirdly, that
no rasor should come upon their head to cut their hair.

They are commanded not to eat the kernel of the raisin; secondly, not to
eat the raisin It self; and thirdly, not to drink the wine, as they might
drink no wine, so neither might they drink ex maceratis vuis quas (...) or
secundaria vina vocat Plinius; So they might drink no vinegar, the Seventy,
(...) as made of apples, dates, etc. so a vino hordei, as Athenaeus calls it.

They were commanded to abstain from wine and strong drink; wine here is put
before strong drink, Scriptura enim nominat genus quandoque post speciem,
Regula.
the Lord says, Amos 2.11. he raised up of their young men for Nazarits, but
verse. 12. they gave their Nazarits wine to drink, they should have learned
abstinencie from the Nazarits, but they intised the Nazarits to drink wine,
contrary to the Law.

The use that we may make of this is first to show us that it is a sin to be
partaker of another man's sins, Psalm 50.18. when thou saw a thief then
thou consentedst with him, and wast pertaker with the adulterer. Secondly, not
only to be partaker, but approve the same, Romans 1.32. thirdly, it is a greater
sin to be examples to others in sin, as Iud. 11. woe be to them for they
have gone in the way of Cain, but it is the greatest sin of all, to provoke
others to sin, as here they provoked the Nazarits to drink wine, and gave
them wine to drink.

Secondly, they were commanded to abstain from the dead, and not to come near
their fathers, brethren or sisters, if they were dead; if a man dyed suddenly
by them, they were defiled; and if they touched but one who touched the dead,
they were defiled; the same holiness was required of them, that was required
of the highpriest to abstain from the dead.

Maimone in his treatise of mourning, cap. 3.
The Jews say, if the Highpriest had lighted upon a dead body in the way, he
might defile himself and bury the dead, being alone, and none to help him: So
they say, if an inferior Priest and a Nazarite were walking together, if he
had been but Nazaraeus dierum, he was to bury the dead, because his holiness
was not perpetual; but if he had been a perpetual Nazarite then the inferior
Priest was to bury the dead, and not he, because as great purity was required
in the perpetual Nazarite, as in the Priest concerning the dead.

Sampson sin being a Nazarite by touching of the dead bodies, and taking off
their clothes?



The heathen Priests learned of them not to touch the dead, Seneca consolatione
ad Marcian. cap 15.
the Flaminian Priests might not put shoes upon their feet of the leather of
that beast which dyed of it self, and if a Priest happened to have a funeral
oration before the dead corpse, he used to stretch a veil betwixt him and the
corpse, that he might not see it, Non licebat Flamini Diali tibias
funebres-audire, nec locum in quo bustum erat, ingredi: A Flaminian Priest
might not hear the sound of the pipes which were at burialls, neither might he
come into that place where there was a grave.

The third thing was this, that no Rasor came upon their head: they suffered
their hair to grow, (...), intonsi
therefore they were called (...), and they were called (...), vel intonsi, and
if they were voluntary Nazarits, no Razor might come upon their heads until
the vow was expired, and then their hair was cut and cast under the Altar, and
burnt: but if they were perpetual Nazarits, there came never a razor upon
their head, but their hair was only cut about, and this was cincta caesaries;
Dalila cut off Sampsons hair, yet he ceased not to be a Nazarit; for the
Angel said, that he should be a NaZarit unto his death. The hair was a sign
of strength, and as long as Sampson kept his hair, he kept his strength; and
God threatening to weaken the estate of his people, uses this similitude, that
he will shave the hair with a razor. Esaias. 7.20. In the same day shall the
Lord shave with a razor.

When the voluntary Nazaret vowed a vow for thirty days, and in the mean time
defiled himself, by touching of the dead; if the whole time had been spent to
one day, and then if he had touched any unclean thing, (...)
all these former days were reckoned nothing to him ( Job. 3.6. [Naphal]
fugient, aut dilabentur: Onkelos, inutiles erunt, Perire diem ad embolismum
pertinet.
or let let them be reckoned amongst the intercalar days which were not
numbered amongst the days of the year) and he was to begin his vow anew
again: so it is in the course of our sanctification, when we have gone on a
while in it, and then fall into some great sin, in that case we are to begin
our sanctification anew again. Act. 7.42. O ye house of Israel, have ye
offered to me slain beasts, and sacrificed by the space of forty years in the
Wilderness? They offered to the Lord sundry times in the Wilderness according
to his ordinance; but because now they fell to worship Idols, therefore the
Lord reckoned the former sacrifices, as though they had not been offered to
him.

When the Israelites had traveled to the confines of Moab to Kadesh-Barnea,
they fell a murmuring there against the Lord, therefore the Lord brought them
back again, after that they had passed sixteen stationes. Number. 33.20.35, To
the red Sea in which they were baptized, 1 Cor. 10.2. So when we fall from the
Lord, we are to return back again to our Baptism and first vow.

And he came and dwelt in Nazaret, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken
by the Prophet. Matthew. 2.23. And he shall be a Nasarit to the Lord.

Nasarit, and a Nazarit.

Nazaret, the true branch of the root of less, Nazaraus vot^, Nazarenus
habitatione.
and he was a Nasarit truly separate to the Lord; and Satan acknowledged him to
be (...) Luc. 4. As Sampso^ was (...), sanctified to the Lord in type; (...).
he was both (...) et (...) est (...), sanctus, and he was (...) oriundus ex
Nazaret, and in the title of Christ's Cross there was an allusion to that plate
of gold which was upon the forehead of the high Priest, and therefore Aaron was
called the Saint of the Lord, because he had holiness to the Lord written in
his forehead; that plate of gold was called Nezer, it had written upon it
(...), which is (...). Exodus 30.39. It was written, that is, engraven in the
plate, Christ was that true Nazarit holy, blameless, and undefiled; we are to
mark, that the Seventy to facilitate words, and to make them the more easy to
be pronounced, write the words different from the Hebrew, as they say, Samaria
for Shemron, so Solomon, for Shelomoh, so Nasareus for Nazareus, and the devil
being well acquainted with all languages, could call Christ (...) putting [S]
for [Z] so in the inscription upon the Cross they call him that Nasarit or
Nazarit.

Nasarit, but Nazarit only.

Nasarit, for he fulfilled that in his forerunner John the Baptist; but he was
the true Nasarit separated from sinners; the Jews in contempt called Christ a
Nazarit, and so Julian the apostate called Christ a Galilean, because Nazarit
stood in Galilee, and it was for this, that the Christians were called at the
first Nazaraei, but afterward their name was changed at Antioch, and they were
called Mesichijm, Christiani.

From the cutting of the Nazarits hair, they brought in shaving of the heads
in the Christian Church, and they said, that long hair signified superfluity
in manners; hence came this speech afterward, Tonso capite fieri monachus;
judaizing in this point.

Commandment. IIII. EXERCITAT. XIX. Of the Passover.
Levit. 23.5. In the fourteenth day of the first month is the Lords passover.
How the Passover pertains to the fourth Commandment.
THe passover as it was a sacrifice, and a sacrament, it is an appendix of the
second Commandment; but the time of it set down here is an appendix of the
fourth Commandment.

The word [Passeover] taken diversely.
This word [Passeover] is taken sundry ways in the Scripture; First, for
passing over, because the Angel passed over the houses of the Israelites, and
destroyed them not, Exodus 12.11. It is the Lords passover, Secondly, Passover
is taken for those actions which were done about the passover, as killing the
lamb, sprinkling of the blood, eating of it, and such, Matthew. 26.17. Thirdly,
for the feast which was annexed to the Passover, 2 Chro. 35.11. They killed
the Passover and the Priests sprinkled the blood, etc. This was for the feast
of the Passover. Fourthly, for the Lamb killed at the Passover. Matthew.
26.19. And they made ready the Passover, That is, the Lamb which was killed
at the Passover, so Marc. 14.12. They killed the Passover. Lastly, for the
time of the Passover, as Luc. 22.1.

They had in this Passover unleavened bread, a Lamb, bitter herbs, and a cup
in which they did drink.

First, they had unleavened bread, The unleavened bread called the poores bread.
this unleavened bread was panis pauperum, the poores bread, Deuteronomy. 13.6. Yet
the Lord takes this unleavned bread for the Sacrament; it was a great change,
Why they had unleavened bread in the Passover.
when Moses rod which was the shepherds rod, was made the rod of the Lord; so
this was a great change, when he took the poores bread, and made it this bread
of his Sacrament; they were commanded to eat the bread in remembrance of their
hastening out of Egypt, when they had no leisure to ferment it; but Christ
changed it to another sort of remembrance, to be a memorall of his death in the
Sacrament. 1 Cor. 11:24. Do this in remembrance of me.

It must be unleavened bread, for leavened bread signified either Hypocrisy or
malice; David calls a wicked man, A leavened person. Psalm. 71.4. So a
leavened heart. Psalm. 73.21. So Matt. 16.6. Beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees, and 1 Cor. 5.7. Purge out the old leaven.

Then they eat it with bitter herbs, Why eaten with sour herbs.
to put them in remembrance of their affliction in Egypt; and Jeremiah seems
to allude to this. Lament. 3.15. Allusion.
He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me drunken with worm wood.



Whether the Cup in the Passover was a Sacramental Cup or not.
for there is no mention made of it in the institution, the Lord commands to
take a Lamb, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs, but not a word of the Cup;
wherefore this cup was but their common Cup, in which they used to drink.

It may be said,

constitutiva sanctificatio, but invocativa: Sanctificatio. Constitutio.
Invocatio.

it is constitutiva invocatio, that makes it a Sacrament, accedat verbum ad
elementum, et fiet Sacramentum (says Augustine) and when it wants the word
of institution then it cannot be a Sacrament; it is true that Christ
transferred this cup, Many things that are common, changed to a holy use.
and made it Sacramental under the Gospel: but it was not sacramental under
the Law, it was only a common cup, the water which they drank out of the
Rock was a Sacrament to them, 1 Cor. 10.4. and it was also common water, for
their beasts drunk of it.

So this was but a common Cup to them, but Christ made it Sacramental,
somethings again which were Sacramental to them, were common at Christ's
Supper, as the eating of bitter herbs. Last, it was not a Sacramental Cup,
for the blood of the Paschall Lamb signified the blood of Christ; there are not
two things appointed in the Sacrament to signify one thing.

What things were proper to the Passover in Egypt, and what proper to it in
Canaan.
Things proper to the Passover in Egypt, were first, they eat the Passover in
their several houses when they were in Egypt; but afterward they were bound
to eat it in Jerusalem only. Deuteronomy. 16.5.6. 2 Chro. 35.

Secondly, in Egypt the blood was sprinkled upon the Lintels of the doors; but
afterward it was sprinkled upon the Altar. 2 Chro. 35. and then the Master of
the house caused to bring back the Lamb to his house, and eat it with his
family. Luc. 22.7.8.

Thirdly, in Egypt they stood when they eat the Paschall Lamb, with their
loins girt, and their staves in their hands, to signify that they were to
make haste, away, Esaias alludeth to this, Esaias. 52.12. For ye shall not go out
with haste, nor go by flight; but when they came to Canaan, they sat when
they eat the Passover.

Their sitting at the Passover was not a significative Ceremony.
Whether was their sitting a significative ceremony, or not, when they eat the
Passover in Canaan?

Seven memorable Passeovers.
Not, it was only after the custom of men when they sit to eat meat.

There were sundry memorable Passeovers. The first in Egypt, the second in the
Wilderness; the third in the days of Joshua; Cap. 5.10. the forth in the
days of Hezekiah; 2 Chro. 30. the fifth in the days of Josiah, where there was
not such a Passover holden from the days of the Judges that judged Israel,
nor in all the days of the Kings of Israel. 2 King. 23.22. The Sixth, after
they returned from the captivity. Ezra 6.9. The last Passover was that which
Jesus kept with his Disciples. Luc. 22. where he put an end to the Passover,
and instituted his own Supper in the place of it.







Exodus 8.26. It was abomination for the Israelites to sacrifice in Egypt, but
the paschall Lamb was eaten in Egypt; therefore the paschall Lamb was not a
sacrifice.





Egypt, and the priesthood was settled, the Priests only killed the sacrifice,
and sprinkled the blood, and the Lamb was then carried home.

Secondly, It was abomination to sacrifice in Egypt, Maimone in Corban
Peshang, cap. 1. ^.
it was an abomination to the Egyptians to see beasts killed there, because
they worshipped beasts as their Gods; but it was not abomination before the
Lord; for fear of the Egyptians they would not sacrifice there, they might
have sacrificed there as well as they killed the Paschall Lamb there, it was a
thing lawful in it self.

We must distinguish two things in the paschal Lamb, it was both a Sacrament
and a sacrifice; the sprinkling of the blood in the Temple was a sacrifice, the
eating of the Lamb at home in their several houses was a Sacrament; and so as
it was a sacrifice, they offered; and as it was a Sacrament, they received.

Reasons proving that the Paschall Lamb was a sacrifice.
Reasons proving that it was a sacrifice are these:

Chro. 30.1. Hezekiah gave Commandment that all the people should come to the
house of the Lord at Jerusalem to keep the Passover, Wherefore should he have
commanded them to come to the house of the Lord to eat it, if it had not been a
sacrifice? if it had been only a Sacrament it had been enough to have bidden
come to Jerusalem to eat it.

Chro. 35.11. And they killed the Passover, and they sprinkled the blood, it
was the blood of the sacrifice that the Priest sprinkled.

Josephus de bello Iudaico. lib. 6. cap. 45.
Josephus writes, that Cestus Florus, when he would show to the Emperor the
multitude of the Jews that were in Jerusalem at the Passover, he desired the
Priests that they might get the number of the people; and how did the Priests
find out the number of the people? he says, by the number of the Lambs which
they killed at the Passover, and then they reckoned how many were in every
family at the eating of a Lamb, and so they found out the number of the
people; it was the Priest then that killed those Lambs, and none else.

The Paschall Lamb a figure of Christ.
The Paschall Lamb was a figure of Jesus Christ: the Paschall Lamb was taken
the tenth day, and separated until the fourteenth and at the evening of the
fourteenth it was killed: Jesus Christ, the true Paschall Lamb, Came six
days before the Passover to Bethania. Ioh. 12.1. and the morrow after he went
to Jerusalem, where they met him with branches of palm trees, and this was
five days before the Passover, then he stayed four days in Jerusalem, and
was killed in the day of the Passover at night, and thus he accomplished the
ceremonies of the Law.

Jews and Christ eat the Passover upon the same day, or not?

Whether Christ kept the Passover that same day which the Jews kept.
in the end of the fourteenth day, and the beginning of the fifteenth, he eat
it betwixt two evenings; but the Jews transferred the day, and eat it in the
end of the fifteenth day, and beginning of the sixteenth; and therefore when
Christ eat the Passover, it was the day of the Preparation to the Jewish
Passover, although indeed it was the true Passover, John 17.62. When the
Passover preceded the Sabbath, they used to transfer the holy actions of
that day to the Sabbath, that two feasts may not fall together, and they did
their common work upon that day, which should have been done upon the
Passover, and reserved the holy actions to the Sabbath following; and it was
upon this day that they crucified Christ.

They kept this translation of feasts, Why they transferred their feasts to the
Sabbath.
lest the feast of Lots should have fallen, 2, 4, 7.

Lest the feast of the Passover should have fallen. 2, 4, 6.

Lest the feast of the Pentecost should have fallen. 3, 5, 7.

Lest the beginning of the new year should have fallen. 1, 4, 6.

Lest the day of expiation should have fallen. 1, 3, 6.

They observed this translation of the feasts, because they had certain feasts
which fell upon these days, that two feasts should not fall together, as the
three feasts of Dedication, the four fasts mentioned in Zachariah, and the
feast of Lots.

When the diverse keeping of the Passover began.
This diversity was not kept so long as the first Temple stood, whence arose it
then? it seems to have taken the beginning from the diverse beginning of the
month, for when they reckoned their month from the apparition which was
doubtful and uncertain; hence it came to pass, that the beginning of the
month was not always at the selfsame period; for the last day of Adar might
fall out so, that it should be the beginning of Nisan; and therefore the
Sanhedrin, appointed that the full Moon should be the thirteenth day, which
according to the verity was the fourteenth; this diversity arose of this,
because of the diverse apparitions of the Moon, so they kept the preparation to
the Pascha diversely.

Great dissension betwixt the Eastern and Western Churches for keeping of the
Passover.
When the Apostles have so clearly determined that matter, that no man should
be condemned or judged for not keeping these days, yet Satan came and did sow
his Cockle and his Darnell, and raised dissentions in the Churches, betwixt the
Eastern and Western Churches, about the keeping of the Passover; the
Eastern Churches alleged that John and Philip celebrated the Passover in
memory of Christ's Supper, for they kept diem (...), in the fourteenth day of
the Month, but the Western Churches alleged that Peter and Paul kept the
Passover upon the first Lords day after the fourteenth day of the month, upon
which day they kept diem (...).

Pius Bishop of Rome ordained the Passover to be kept on the Lords day.
Pius Bishop of Rome, in the year of God, 147. gave out an Edict, that the
Pascha should be celebrated by all upon the Lords day; yet those in Asia cared
not much for this Edict, and there arose hot contentions on both the sides:
Polycarpus John's Disciple came into Rome to settle this contention, and he
appointed that every one should celebrate the Pascha as they were wont, yet
this contention was not buried, for the Eastern and Western Churches left not
off one to write against another.

Victor the Bishop of Rome in a Synod holden there, Victor his Statute
concerning the Passover.
ordained that the Pascha should be celebrated there upon the Lords day from
the fourteenth day of March, until the twenty one of that month. Those of
Caesarea Palestina, Pontus, and Achaia, embraced this Edict, yet others stood
out against it, and said they would keep it according to John's tradition,
wherefore Victor excommunicated all the Bishops in Asia: Yet, Irenaeus Bishop
of Lions, Polycarpus Scholar, settled the matter, under this condition that
every one should celebrate it after his own form. The contention betwixt the
Eastern and Western Churches wakened again.


This peace lasted not long, for in the year of Christ 318, the contention was
wakened anew again, which Constantine the Emperor took hardly out, exhorting
the Asiatickes not to be partakers with the Jews who crucified Christ; but
they would not obey the Emperors letters, for they said, they kept not the
Jews Passover, but the new Passover instituted by Christ; But a Council
being convened at Nice for the repressing of the heresy of the Arrians, it was
appointed, that through every Church of the Empire, The decree of the Council
of Nice.
the Pascha should be celebrated upon the Lords day by all.

The Council for finding out of the Pascha, appointed first, that it should be
celebrated after the twenty one day of March, for at that time the vernall
Equinox was upon this day, and the Pascha should be celebrated after the
Equinox, Secondly, that after the twenty one day of March, they should look
still to the fourteenth day of the moon, and after this day should the
Passover be kept upon the Lords day, and to find out the time of the Moon,
they composed the sicle of the golden number, for wheresoever in the Calendar
the golden number is found of that year, there is the new Moon; and although
these rules were sure at the Council of Nice, yet they hold not now, for the
Equinox is not now fixed upon the twenty one day of March, but ever
anticipateth it, for now it is on the tenth of March: but now these who reckon
to the Passover, look to the first new Moon, after the first day of Lent,
and the first Sunday after, begins the Quadragesima, and the seventh Sunday
after is the Pascha.

The Jewish feasts went backward.
Mark that all these Jewish feasts being reckoned by the Equinoxe, they go
backward from the day upon which they were first instituted; when the Passover
was instituted at the first, it fell upon the twenty seventh day of March. When
the Passover was institute^, the Equinoxe was upon the 27 day of March.
At the Council of Nice, the Equinoxe, turned back to the twenty one day, on
which the Passover was kept; and now, it is turned back to the tenth day. If
the Passover should be kept now according to the Equinoxe, it should be kept
the tenth of March. The reason why the Equinoxe varieth so, is because in the
space of every hundredth and six years, Why the Equinox varieth. At the
Creation the Equinox was upn tho 3 day of April.
the whole Spheres come from the South to the North, by motion of the Firmament
one degree, the world being created upon the third of April, which was the
Equinox then, now it is turned back to the tenth of March, and if the world
were to continue so long, it would turn to the tenth of January: By this the
Lord would teach the Jews, that all their feasts have taken an end; but the
Sabbath continually goes forward, for it shall fall this year upon the first
of January, it will fall upon the second of January the next year, and so
forth; but the feasts go backward, that which falls upon Saturday this
year, shall fall upon Friday the next year; and as the Planets have a
contrary course to the first mover, going backward, whereas the first mover
goes forward; so these feasts going backward, turn to nothing, but the
Sabbath going still forward, shall end in that eternal Sabbath.



EXERCITAT. XX. Of the Pentecost. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 4.
Levit 23.15. And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath,
from the day that ye brought the sheafe of the wave-offering, seven Sabbaths
shall be complete, etc.
THe Pentecost is called the feast of weeks, because there were seven weeks
betwixt the morrow after the Passover; and it is called the Pentecost, from
(...), fifty, and in Hebrew, Haghashibignoth,

There were sundry memorable things reckoned by the number of fifty in the
Scriptures; (...) Many memorable things by the number of fifty.
as fifty days from their coming out of Egypt, unto the giving of the Law.
The Dough which they brought out of Egypt, lasted thirty days, for the Manna
descended the sixeteenth day of the second month; now betwixt the fifteenth
day of the first month, when they came out of Egypt, to the sixteenth day of
the second month, are just thirty days, after that time within fifteen
days, they came to Sinai, that makes forty five days; then the Lord
commanded them to sanctify themselves three days, annd that makes forty
eight days; then the second day after that, the Law was given. So there were
fifty days betwixt the morrow after the Passover and the Pentecost: So there
were fifty days after Christ's Resurruction, and the coming down of the Holy
Ghost upon the Apostles: so in the fiftieth year was the Iubile.

The error of the Samaritans, in reckoning of the Pentecost.
There were seven weeks from the morrow after the Passover to the Pentecost;
the Samaritans mistaking the word Sabbath, they kept seven Pentecosts in one
year, therefore they were called Hebdomaditai.

They began to reckon the Pentecost from the morrow after the Passover, which
they called (...), and the first Sabbath after the (...), was called (...).

Christ rose upon this (...), and as there were fifty days betwixt (...), and
the Pentecost; so there were fifty days betwixt Christ's Resurrection, and the
coming down of the Holy Ghost.

The Angel stirred the poole at the Passover.
At the Pentecost, the man which had an infirmity thirty eight years, was
cured, Ioh. 5.5. For it is said, verse 4. That an Angel went down (...), at a
certain season; and the Hebrews say, lemognad hase, and the Hel^nists say
(...), (following the Hebrews) at this season, that is, at the Pentecost;
(...), here is taken distributive; so Mat. 27.15. The Angel came down at
their feasts, when many people were met together at Jerusalem; confer, Ioh.
4.36. with cap. 5.1. At that Pentecost the Angel but came down, but at the
great Pentecost the Holy Ghost came down.

When the Barley Harvest began.
Upon the (...) was the beginning of their Harvest, and then there were but
handfuls of Barley brought in (therefore at the Passover they read the History
of Ruth, in the days of the Barley Harvest, Ruth 1.22. In the beginning of the
Barley Harvest; the Chaldee Paraphrast paraphraseth it at the Pentecost.) But
at the Pentecost, the full Harvest was gathered in; their first Harvest was of
their Barley, of their basest Grain only; but the full Harvest of their best
Grain, the Wheat, was at the Pentecost. Christ said, Ioh. 4.35. Say ye not,
there are four Months, and then comes Harvest? Behold, I say unto you, lift
up your eyes, and look on the Fields; for they are white already unto
Harvest. But although the Harvest was great, yet there were few Laborers, Mat.
9, 37. Here is an excellent allusion betwixt the Pentecost, when their Corns
were ripe, being the time of their full Harvest, and the coming down of the
Holy Ghost, for at the Pascha there was little Harvest, but at the Pentecost
all the regions were white: so before the holy Spirit came down, there was but
a small Harvest; but when the Holy Ghost came down, The Apostles gathered that
which the Prophets had sown.
there was a plentiful and a great Harvest; and at the Pentecost they gathered
that which the Prophets had sown, John 4.38. Ye reaped that wherein ye
bestowed no labor.

Christ is called the first fruits from the dead, Christ the first fruits from
the dead.
1 Cor. 15.20. as a handful of the first fruits, sanctified the whole field of
Corn that was growing; so Jesus Christ, the first fruits from the dead,
sanctifies all those who are lying in the Grave to rise again by his power,
even when they are in the dust of death, Psalm. 22.15.

The day of the Pentecost was called (...), The Pentecost had but one holy day.
as the last days of the Passover, and the feast of Tabernacles were called
gnazereth, holy days, there was but one holy day of the Pentecost; but the
first and the last days of the other great feasts were both holy, and yet the
Pentecost was the most excellent Feast of all, for then the Comforter came, and
the gift of the Holy Ghost came down plentifully upon the Church.

Lastly, observe the phrase, Act. 2.1. When the days of the Pentecost were
fulfilled, The Scriptures speak of things as done, when they are but in the
act of doing.
that is, fulfilling, So Ier. 25.12. And it shall come to pass, when seventy
years are accomplished, that I will punish the King of Babylon, and that
Nation, says the Lord; Seventy years were not co^plete here, for in the
seventieth year they returned from the captivity; so here, when the days of
the Pentecost were fulfilled, that is, upon the very day of the Pentecost, when
it was fulfilling.

This word gnazareth is usually restrained by the Jews to the last of the
Pentecost, and it is translated by the Seventy, Amos 5.21. (...), which word
Paul uses, Heb. 12.23. for a general Assembly.

EXERCITAT. XXI. Of the Feast of Tabernacles. A ceremonial appendix of
Command. 4.
Levit. 23.33. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children
of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of of this seventh month, shall be the
Feast of Tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord.
God instituted many things to put his people in memory of his judgments and
mercies.
THe Lord would not have his people forgetful, neither of his mercies, nor of
his judgments; of his mercies, Therefore he commanded them to keep the
Passover in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt; he gave them the
Law fifty days after they came out of Egypt, therefore he would have them to
keep the Pentecost; he fed them with Manna, therefore he commanded the pot
with Manna to be reserved; they dwelt in Tabernacles, or Boothes, all the time
that they were in the Wilderness; therefore he commanded them to keep the
feast of Tabernacles, lest they should forget his benefits, Psalm. 103, 2.
Forget not all his benefits. So he will not have them forget his judgments,
therefore he commanded the Censers of Nadab, and Abihu to be nailed upon the
Altar, to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, Number. 16.39.40.

The feast of Tabernacles was instituted, why the feast of Tabernacles was
instituted
to put them in remembrance that they were but Pilgrims in the Wilderness,
and had not a permanent dwelling there.

Their first station in the Wilderness after they came out of Egypt, was
Succoth, a Boothe, or a Tabernacle; (...) Tabernaculum Tentorium, est etiam
proprium nomen loci a tiguriissic dicti a (...) texit, obtexit.
and they had fortytwo Stations in the Wilderness, from the first, to the
last, and all this time when they were in the Wilderness, they had nothing to
dwell in but Tents and Boothes, so that here they were but Pilgrims upon the
earth; as their fathers were before them. Psalm. 39.19. Because our life is a
pilgrimage, therefore David says, I am tossed up and down as the Locust.
Psalm. 109.23. The Locust is now here, now there: so is the life of man tossed
to and fro; and Micah says, Arise and depart, for this is not your rest.
Micah. 2.10.

Observe how the Lord does Minister comfort to his people, showing them a sure
dwelling, Comforts which God gives to his children dwelling in their
tabernacles here.
and a place of rest for their transitory Tabernacles; we dwell in these
bodies, but as in a Tabernacle, but this is our comfort. 2 Cor. 5.1. We know
that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building
of GOD, an house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. When the
Patriarchs dwelt in Canaan, they dwelt in Tents and Tabernacles. Heb. 11.9.
But their comfort was, They looked for a City which has foundations, whose
builder and maker is God. Heb. 11.10. When they traveled in the Wilderness
with the ambulatory Arc, this Tabernacle the Lord refused, and his glory
departed from it: but in place of it Christ himself, (...), Dwelt amongst us
as in the Tabernacle of his flesh. Ioh, 1.14. where the Shecinah or Divine
Majesty dwells for ever. This was the Tabernacle which the Lord made and not
man, (...).
Heb. 11.9. Lastly, although the grave be called domus saeculi man's long home.
Eccle. 12.5. Yet our bodies do rest there, but as in a Tabernacle for a while,
Act. 2.26. Our bodies rest there but for a short time, and he has prepared
another City for us to dwell in.

This feast of Tabernacles was said to be kept seven days, Levit. 23.34. And
the Evangelist says, Upon the last and great day of the feast Jesus stood up.
Ioh. 7.37. This was the most solemn day of the feast, this day they kept
festum laetitiae legis, the feast of joy, because they ended the reading of the
Law this day; (...)
and the next Sabbath, they called Sabbath berefith, because they began again
to read the book of Genesis, (...)
and they read three Haphtaroth or Sections that day, the first was Haphtaroth
elle pekudi lejom shenishel succoth, and it began at, 1 King. 7.51. So was
ended all the words which King Solomon made, etc. And that day Solomon stood up
and blessed all the people: So Jesus Christ the true Solomon blessed the people
in the great and last day of the feast.

(...)
The second Haphtorah which was read this day, was Haphtorah Shimhhath Hatorah,
festum laetitaei legis, and it began at Josh. 1. They kept this feast because
the Law was ended, (...) At this feast was the dedication of the Temple, and
the Arc brought into it. ^ Chro. 3.2.3.7. The remnant of the Jews that
return^d from the ca^tivity was to keep this feast, Zach. 14.16.
and Joshua began the Prophets.

The third Haphtaroh which they read, was Sabbath Hagadol, which began at, Mal.
3.4. And it ended with these words, Behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet.
Mal. 4.5. And so they joined the last Section of the law, and the last Section
of the Prophets both together, and it was on this day that Jesus Christ stood
up and spoke to them, who was the true Solomon, the true Joshua, the end of the
law and the Prophets: and whereas the Jews delighted much in eating and
drinking that day, Jesus Christ called all those to him who thirst. If any man
thirst let him come to me and drink. Ioh. 7.37.

Last, see how upon the first day of this feast they offered thirteen young
Bullockes, two Rames, and fourteen Lambs of the first year, the second day
twelve, the third day, eleven; the fourth day, ten; the fifth day, nine; the
sixth day, eight; and upon the seventh day of the feast were offered but seven
Bullockes, the seventh day of the feast was the great day of the feast, and
yet it had but the meanest offering, which gave them to understand, that the
Lord was to abolish these sacrafices, and to bring in a perfect sacrifice in
place of them, who is Jesus Christ once to be offered for all.

At this feast they held up branches, and so they held them up to Christ before
the Passover, and they sang Hosanna which was a solemn sort of prayer, Salva
quaeso nunc, and they wish not only peace to him on earth but also in Heaven.
Then the shoute of a King was amongst them, Number. 23.21.

EXERCITAT. XXII. Of the New Moons. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 4.
Psalm. 81.3. Blow up the Trumpet in the New Moon, in the time appointed on our
solemn feast day.
(...) Novilunium a (...) texit, quodtunc Luna Sole tegitur: vel (...) Feria
stativa, tempas statum; quod in numeratum anni diem semper recurrit, a (...)
numeravit, supputavit.
THe New Moon has two names in the Scripture, First, it is called Ceseh or
Cese. Secondly, it is called Hhodesh from [Hhiddesh] renovare.

They kept the New Moons holy as they did their Sabbaths, Wherefore will thou
go unto him to day, it is neither New Moon nor Sabbath. 2 King. 4.28. So the
Apostle joyneth them both together. Coloss. 2.16. Let no man therefore judge
you, in respect of an Holy day, or of the New Moon, or of the Sabbath.

Their new Moons and other feasts were Holy days, they might do no servile
work in those days, as to reap, sow or plough, buy or sell, but they might
kindle fire, dress meat, and such upon them, which they might not do upon the
Sabbath.

(...) Noviluniu^, mensis a (...) Innovavit.
In all their other Holy days, the Passover, pentecost, feast of Tabernacles,
and first day of the new year, their sacrifice had a feast joined with it; but
the first day of the new Moon had no feast added to it.

Sam. 20.11.12.13. It is said that it was the day of the new Moon, and David
desired to go to Bethlehem to keep the feast.

Month, and the first day of the New year fell together; therefore the Jews
when they set down their Haphtorah in the Margent upon, 1 Samuel 20. (...)
They set down Haphtorah berosh Har^sh, as ye would say, a division to be read
in the first of the first, that is, on that which was both the first day of the
Month, and the first day of the New year; and it was for the first day of the
New year that the feast was kept, and not for the first day of the New Moon.

The New Moon was celebrated ever upon the first day of the Month, The new
Moon kept ever upon the first day of the month.
and therefore the Moon and the Month began both in one day, although not at
the same hour; for the Moon had twentynine days and twelve hours, but the
Month had twentynine or thirty days successively; therefore the twelve hours
of the first New Moon, excressing over the twentynine days of the first
month, were reserved until the second New Moon, which had other twelve
hours, and those two being joined together, made up the thirty day of the
second Month.

The Lord would have them to keep these New Moons Holy to him, to teach them,
Why they kept the new Moons.
that it was he who ruled and governed the world, and all the changes and
vicissitudes of it; for as the Moon is predominant over all inferior
creatures, so does Gods providence rule all things below here; the heathen
groaped after this, when they set a god or a goddess to every Month, as Juno
to January; Neptune to February; The heathen set a god over every month.
Minerva to March; Venus to April; Apollo to May; Mercury to June; Jupiter to
July; Ceres to August; Vulcan to September; Mars to October; Diana to November;
and Vesta to December. But the Lord has made summer and winter, Psalm. 74.17.
And it is he that crowns the year with his goodness. Psalm. 65.21.

The keeping of these New Moons taught them the estate of the Church in this
world; A comparison betwixt the moon and the Church.
the Church is compared to the Moon, the Moon is lightened by the Sun, and
beautified by it, the Church is said to be fair as the Moon, Cant. 6.10. She
is fair as the Moon, when she is clothed with Christ's righteousness: and as
the moon has her light from the Sun, so has the Church her light from
Jesus Christ. The Sun gives light and receives none; the Moon gives
light, and receives; the air only transmitteth light, but it gives no
light; so the Lord only gives light, but receives none; the Church receives
light and communicates light to others; but the worldlings neither receive
light nor do communicate light to others.

The diverse changes of the Moon.
Again the Church is like the Moon for her alterations, and change, for the
moon has many changes; she is sometimes [Cese] in ab scondito, or in (...), or
(...), in the conjunction; Secondly, she is (...), or in (...), when she is in
the prime; Thirdly, she is (...), Corniculata; Fourthly, she is (...), half
Moon; then she is (...), Gibbosa; and then (...), full Moon: so in
declination, First, she is (...), then (...); Thirdly, (...), and fourthly, in
(...), many are the alterations which are in the Moon; so there are in the
Church.

Psalm. 89.2. Salomons Kingdom is compared to the Moon; Solomon's Kingdom
compared to the Moon.
the Moon in twenty eight days finisheth her course, fourteen days to the
full, and fourteen days to the wane: so from Abraham were fourteen
generations to Solomon, then the Moon was at the full; then from the end of
Salomons days, until Zedokiah are fourteen generations; and then the
Kingdom decayed and waned.

Lastly, observe here that they are commanded to keep the New Moon, and not
the full Moon, to teach the Church that her greatest perfection here is to be
growing to perfection.

The Moon keeps three courses, Three motions of the Moon.
the first is called mensis peragrationis, The second is mensis illuminationis,
and the third is mensis conjunctionis.

Mensis peragrationis is this, Mensis peragrationis what,
when the Moon goes from the point of the Zodiac to the same point again;
and this she does in twentyseaven days and eight hours; the Jews observed
not this month, because it has no reference to the Sun, but respects
only the own proper course of it.

The second is mensis illuminationis, that is, Mensis illuminationis what.
when the Moon is entering in under the Sun, and when she is wearing out
under the sun again; this month comprehends twentyeight days, the
Greeks call it (...), the old and new, and this month the Jews keep not.

The third is mensis conjunctionis, Mensis conjunctionis, what.
the month of the Moons conjunction with the Sun, consisting of twenty nine
days and twelve hours, she remained under the beams of the Sun twelve
hours before the point of the change: when she is coming out under the Sun,
in those twelve hours she is said to be in (...), or (...), but because she
could not be seen immediately after these twelve hours were past for the
brightness of the Sun beams, they stayed until the Sun went down, What
time of the new Moon they blew the Trumpets.
then they went up to the Turrets of their Synagogues and then they blew their
Trumpets and killed their sacrifices in the space of those eighteen hours;
her twelve hours after she came out under the Sun, and the six hours to
the prime the Jews marked them with those two letters [Iod He] which make
eighteen. (...). 18.


Again, Motus Velo cissimus, tardissimus, medius.
observe that the Moon has Motum velo cissimum, tardissimum, et medium; her
swiftest course is when she is farthest from the earth, and then she is in
(...), in this course she runs 17 degrees in one day, and she remains not
under the shadow of the Sun; the Jews observed not this motion.

The slowest motion of the Moon is in (...), nearest the earth, then she
runs but ten degrees in one day, and she remains under the Sun more
than two days: This course of the Moon the Jews observed not.

The Jews observed the first apparition ^f the Moon in her middle motion.
The third motion of the Moon is a middle motion, and in one day she runs
thirteen degrees, and then remains under the shadow of the Sun two days,
and the Jews observed her first apparition in this course for their New
Moons; the Moon keeps always a constant course, but yet when she is
farthest from the earth the seems to us to run more swiftly, therefore they
could not make their observation, of the change of the Moon from that course;
neither when she is nearest to us: for then she seems to make too slow a
course, therefore they observed this course, when she was in her middle motion,
neither too slow nor too swift.

Of their feast of Trumpets.
In the first day of the seventh month they had the feast of blowing of
Trumpets, the Jews commonly hold, that this feast was kept in remembrance of
Isaacs deliverie, when the Lamb was killed for him, but Psalm. 81. verse. 5.
David bids them blow up the Trumpet, because it was a statute in Israel, and
a law of the God of Jacob, this he ordained in Joseph for a Testimony, when he
went out through the Land of Egypt.

A figure to show at what time the Jews began their New Moons.


EXERCITAT. XXIII. Of the day of Expiation. A ceremonial appendix of Command.
4.
Levit. 23.24. On the tenth day of the seventh month there shall be a day of
Atonement, etc.
THis day of Atonement is called Dies cippurim, the day of expiation. (...)
Picavit, pice obduxit. (...) Aliquem iniustum pronuntiare.
Caphar properly is to cover a thing with pitch or plaster, Genesis 6.14. Christ
must cover our sins so that they appear no more, contrary to this is
Hirshiangh, to condemn a man or to make him wicked, that is, to pronounce him
to be wicked.

Four things commanded to be done in the day of expiation.
There were four memorable things commanded on this day of expiation, first,
that they should fast; Secondly, that they should abstain from al sorts of
work; and all sorts of delights; Thirdly, that they should afflict their
souls; Fourthly, that they should proclaim the Iubile this day.

The day of expiation called a fast by way of appropriation.
First, they were commanded to fast this day; they had many fasts, as the fast
of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh
Month, and the the fast of the tenth month, Zach. 8.19. But this was called
the great fast, as Act. 8.9. Sailing was dangerous because the fast was now
past, this fast was the day of expiation.

No works to be done upon the day of expiation.
Secondly, they were commanded to abstain from all works this day. In other
feast days they were commanded to abstain from servile works, as plowing,
sowing, reaping, but this day was to be kept as Holy as the Sabbath it self,
they might kindle no fire this day nor dress meat, they were to abstain from
all delights and pleasures this day, as first, from washing of themselves,
secondly from anointing of themselves, thirdly, from putting on of their shoes
and fine apparel. First, from anointing, They abstained from pleasures that
day.
in the day of affliction they did not anoint themselves. Dan. 20.3.12. So they
laid aside their ornaments. Exodus 33.4* 6. So they went barefooted. 1 Samuel
15.30. So wearing Sackloth. Psalm. 35.13. Not washing themselves. 2 Samuel
12.20.21. They afflicted their souls on the day of expiation.
Not to lie with their wives. 2. Sam. 11.11. Thirdly, This day they afflicted
their souls or humbled their souls, for the outward humiliation had been
nothing with out the inward. Esaias. 58 5. Is it such a fast that I have chosen?
a day for a man to afflict his soul. Outward abstinence without humiliation of
the soul is nothing acceptable to God.

Fourthly, this day they proclaimed the Iubile, Why the Iubile was proclaimed on
the day of expiation.
they were humbled in their souls this day in afflicting themselves, and then
he bids them proclaim the Iubile; to teach us, that the Lord gives grace
to the humble; and secondly, that the Lord mixeth grief and joy together to
his children in this life, they are sweet-sowre joys, and all the promises
have Annexionem Crucis, a condition of some cross adjoined to them. Marc.
10.30. He shall receive an hundredth fold in this life, etc. With persecutions.

This day was instituted for to purge all the defects and wants which had been
in their Sacrifices all the year long, and when this day was not able to purge
them from their sins, this taught them that they must expect another
Sacrifice to purge sin, for Non datur processus in infinitum, but there must
be one perfect Sacrifice to purge all our sins, wherein we should rest.

They had many reasons to show them the weakness of this Leviticall Law, The
weakness of the Ceremonies showed by the Priests and sacrifices.
both in the Sacrifices, and in the Priest; in the Sacrifices, Number. 19.8.9.
When the Heifer was burnt, they put the ashes in water to purge these who were
put out of the Camp for uncleanness; therefore it was called the water of
separation: those ashes purged them that were separated, yet they defiled them
that burnt them, and gathered them, Verse. 10. Therefore this Sacrifice could
not purge him.

So the weakness of these ceremonies was also showed in the Priests
themselves, that the Priest being a sinner, could not make atonement for
himself; when the Priest eat the meat offering of the people, he made
atonement for them; but he might not eat his own meat offering. Levit. 10.17.
This shows the Imperfection of the ceremonies, in eating the sin offering
of the people, but not his own sin offering. This was also showed to them by
this; If the high Priest had been defiled by any thing, there was a second
high Priest appointed to supply his wants, 1 King. 2. which showed the
Imperfection of his Priesthood. Lastly, this Highpriest entered but once in the
year, into the Holiest of all, and he alone, therefore this Priesthood could
bring nothing to perfection.

Heb. 10.5. Sacrifices and Mincha, thou would not have, but a body thou have
prepared for me; in the oblation of Christ's Body, the legal services were
abolished, and the meatoffering ceased when CHRIST came. Dan. 9.2.

Three sorts of purification.
The Jews had diverse sorts of purifications. First they had (...) which was a
purifying by water Ioh. 11.55. (...), they went up to Jerusalem, to purify
themselves, and this the Latins called Lustratio. The Greek called the same
(...), which was a purifying by fire, for (...) is the heat of the sun, this
they borrowed from that Idolatrous custom which the Priests of Moloch used,
(...) transitus per ignem.
when as they had Magnabhir Baish Transitum per ignem, when they did initiate
their young children by making them pass through two fires.

Their second purification was (...), Purifying with water for what?
a washing with water, whereas the former was but a sprinkling with water; Ioh.
3.25. There was a question betwixt some of John's Disciples and the Jews (...),
about purifying, and it was for this purification that those water pots of
stone were set. Ioh. 2.6. for when they came home from their markets, or had
touched a gentile or any unclean thing, they washed their clothes, their
hands and their feet, in those pots of water.

Their third sort of purification was (...) Piaculum, The manner of the heathen
expiating sin.
or victima piacularis, when as they offered a sacrifice of any beast after
they were thus purified, and this was called (...), which the Gentiles abused,
as the Carthaginians, when they took a man, and laid all the sins of the
people upon him, they offered him in a sacrifice, and burnt him in the fire to
be (...), or an expiation for the whole people of that Country or City.

When John the Baptist, John changed all these washinge.
the forerunner of CHRIST came to abolish the ceremonies of the Jews, and to
make way for the Gospel both to the Jews and Gentiles, he changed (...) this
sprinkling of water into repentance, and he changed (...) the washing with
water (...) in baptizing with the holy Ghost and with fire; and he changed
(...) that sacrifice for sin, into that Universal (...), the sacrifice of
Jesus Christ, when he said, Behold the Lamb of God, (...), that takes away the
sins of the World.

EXERCITAT. XXIII. Of the seventh years rest, and the Jubilee. A ceremonial
appendix of Command. 4.
Levit. 25.4. But in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the
Land, etc. verse. 8. and thou shall number seven Sabbaths of years, etc.
GOD commanded his people to rest the seventh day from their labors; then he
commanded them to keep many feasts in the seventh month; upon the first day
of the seventh month they were to keep the feast of Trumpets called Rosh
Hashanah, (...) primus dies anni.
the first day of the new year; upon the tenth day of this month they were to
keep the feast of expiation; upon the fifteenth day of this month, the feast
of Tabernacles, which continued for seven days, and in the seventh day of the
feast of Tabernacles, they kept festum salicis, and carried branches, as they
used in the Pascha to carry palms, which was a sign of victory; then they
carried branches before CHRIST and cried Hosanna filio David. The feast of
collections added to the feast of Tabernacles and Passover.
In the last day of the feast of Tabernacles, was the feast of collection added
both to the Pascha, and to the feast of the Tabernacles, and Ioh. 2.37. it is
called the last and the great day of the feast.

Besides these legal feasts in this month, they had likewise on the fourth
day, the fast of Godaliah, and upon the twenty third day was festum latitiae
legis, et benedictio.

They had but one feast in the Month Nisan, and one in Iair, the Pentecost.

So the Lord commanded that the Land should rest in the seventh year, and
every seventh seventh in the Iubile, The lan^ was labored six years, and
these years were called Anni georgici.

The land was to rest the seventh year, (...)
this was called annus shemittah from Shamat, liberum demittere, and not to
seek any due of it; for those who labored the ground to seek fruit of it
every year was too much, and gave no time of rest to the ground.

The Lord taught the Jews sundry things by the resting of the Land; What
things the Jews were taught by the rest of the seventh year.
for as the Sabbath day taught them that as they were the Lords they behoved to
cease from their own works, to do his work: So the Sabbath of the seventh
year taught them, that both they and their land was the Lords, and therefore
it was to rest.

Secondly, this year taught them to depend upon the Lords providence, for the
Lord promised his blessing upon the sixth year, that the Land should bring out
for three years, Levi. 25.20.

Thirdly, this year was a sign to them of their eternal rest.

Lastly, he instituted this year, to teach them to be pitiful to the poor;
for those things which grew of their own accord that year, were alloted to
the poor and to the strangers.



Levit. 25.21. How God blessed the sixth year, that it served for three years.
Thar he should so bless the sixth year, that it should serve for three
years, and here we may see how the promises were fulfilled, which were made,
Levit. 26, 10. Ye shall bring out the old, because of the new, that is, there
shall be such plenty of new, that ye must bring forth the old to make room
for it, and that is that which Amos speaks, cap. 9.13. Haebraice (...) a
specie in speciem et chaldaice (...) ab anno in annum,
Arator apprehendet messorem, the plowman shall ever take the reaper, that is,
the old and the new shall meet together. So Psalm. 144.13. That our garners may
be full affording all manner of store, but the Chaldee Paraphrast paraphraseth
it, Affording corn from one year to another.

The fertility of the seventh year, was not merely natural.
Here we may observe that this fertility of the seventh year was not merely
natural, but proceeded from the blessing of God. Secondly* all those who
rested the seventh year from their labors, yet they wanted nothing but it was
supplied by the blessing of God. Mal. 3.10 Effundam vobis vsque ad non
sufficientiam, that is, that ye shall not have vessels to contain the oil,
and the wine, nor garners to contain the corn, which I shall bestow upon you.

Never man suffered any loss in Gods service.
So those who abstain from their labors upon the Sabbath, it shall never
impoverish them; for the blessing of God upon the week days shall supply all
their wants; so the Lord promised, when they shall go up to Jerusalem to serve
him at their feasts, that he would keep their land from the incursion of the
enemies, Exo. 34.24. and we see, Josh. 5.2. When they were circumcised, the
Lord struck such a fear and terror in the hearts of the Canaanites, that they
durst not touch them, as Simeon, and Levi killed the Sichemites when they were
newly circumcised; never man yet got hurt in the service of God: He shall still
find the Lords protecting Hand and blessing in his service. When he sent out
the seventy Disciples without purse, scrip, and shoes, he said, Lacked ye any
thing? and they said, Nothing. Luc. 22.35. Nebuchadnezzer shall not want a
reward for his service which he did to the Lord, albeit he was an heathen, for
he got the Land of Egypt for his wages. Ezekiel. 29.20.

The next privilege of the Sabbaticke year was this, Deuteronomy. 14.1. Debts were
paid in the seventh year.
that men's debts were pardoned to them, if they became poor and had nothing to
satisfy, but not if they had sufficient to pay, then they were bound to
satisfy; and if they were poor, the Lord commanded to lend unto them, Deuteronomy.
15.19. although the seventh year was at hand; but that which was borrowed for
necessity only, was not to be restored; and the natural Jews had only this
privilege, but not the Proselytes.

The third privilege of this year was this, Servants were set a liberty this
year.
Exodus 21.2. He shall go out free in the seventh year, paying nothing, to
wit, if he was an Hebrew servant; but if he was not an Hebrew servant, but a
stranger, then he was to serve until the year of the Iubile, Levit. 25.4.

The fourth thing which was done in the seventh year, The Law was publicly
read this year.
the Law was publicly read, Deuteronomy. 31.10.



Ier. 34.14, therefore the Lord plagued them with diverse plagues, and
especially with barrenness of the sixth year, 2 Match. 6.43.49.



At what year the first Rest began.
but seeing the Land was twice divided by Lot, first in Gilgal, Ioh. 14.
Secondly, in Siloh a few years after, because the first division was not
perfected, this account of the seventh year seems to begin at the latter
division of the Land, Ios. 18 2.



Tishri, and not from Nisan; At what time of the were this Rest began.
for if it had begun in Nisan, then they should have lost two Harvests, first,
they might not cut down the Corn which was growing upon the ground in Nisan;
and then secondly, they might not sow in Tishri, and so they should have lost
both the Harvests, Exodus 23.16. and 34.22. but the Lord says, Levit. 25.27.
Ye shall sow the eighth year, therefore they wanted but one sowing, and one
Harvest.

Of the Jubilee.
(...) Produxit, eduxit.
Their great Sabbaticall year was the year of the Iubile: It was called the
Iubile from Iobhel or hobhel, deduxit or produxit; because it brought men back
again to their first estate; the Seventy translate it (...), because they were
brought back to their first estate, and Philo Iudaeus calls it, (...),
restitutio, and Josephus (...), libertatem, and from the word Iubile, the
Latins made their word Iubilo, to take up a merry song. So it might be called
buccina reductionis.

(...)
They blew with Rams horns at this feast, dekeran dikraia, as the Chaldee
paraphrast paraphraseth it. And they blew with these Rams horns in
remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt.

Masius holds, that they were Neat horns; they blew with Rams horns in
the forty ninth year, and in the fiftieth year, the year of the Iubile, with
Oxens horns; but when they gathered the people to the Congregation, Elevare
cornu prophetiae quid.
they blew with silver Trumpets; this blowing of Trumpets signified, that
Ministers should lift up their voice like a Trumpet, Esaias 58.1. and proclaim
salvation to the people. The Prophets were said to lift up the horn, 1 Chro.
25.5. because the Prophets were to lift up their voice, and to blow, as if it
were with a horn. The Priests proclaimed the Iubile with Rams horns.
None might blow with those horns but only the Priests, for the horns were
appointed for a holy use, and no man might blow those horns, but he who was
consecrated for a holy use, as the Priest was, for the Priest went out to
battle and blew the Trumpet, it was he that blew, the trumpet to convocate the
people; it was he that blew, when the walls of Jericho fell down; it was he
that proclaimed the year of Remission; and it was he that proclaimed the year
of the Iubile.

When they proclaimed this Iubile upon the forty ninth year, they proclaimed
it upon the day of expiation; the day of expiation was dies luctus to them, a
day of mourning; and yet the intimation of great joy of the year of the Iubile
was proclaimed that day, to teach the^ in the midst of their grief to remember
joy.

Although the Iubile was proclaimed the forty ninth year, yet the forty ninth
year of the rest and Iubile, The forty ninth year of the Rest, and the ubile
could not ever fall together.
fell not always together; for if the Iubile, and the year of the rest had
fallen always in one year (as some would reckon, beginning the Iubile in
Nisan, and the year of the rest in Tishri) then there should be wanting either
a half year, or a whole year to the year of the rest; the Iubile has
fifty, and the seven rests forty nine, it wanting half a year in the first
Iubile, in the second Iubile there should be a whole year of the rest wanting.
And so the whole order of their reckoning should be perverted; the Text says
expressly, that the fiftieth year shall be the Iubile, and not the forty ninth
year; neither is it enough to say that the Iubile is the fiftieth year,
because the former Iubile is reckoned for one of the fifty, because this ways,
one Iubile should be twice numbered, being the last of the one Iubile, and the
beginning of the next Iubile; and as no man will say, that the Jews were to
rest from their labors after the seventh day, but upon the seventh day; so no
man can say, that the land was to rest after the seventh year, but upon the
seventh; and as the seventh day of the week is to be reckoned, excluding the
former Sabbath (for when the former Sabbath is included, then it is called
eight days) so the seventh year is to be reckoned excluding the former
seventh; and the fiftieth year, secluding the former Iubile.

The year of the Rest and the Iubile fall together every seventh Iubile.
Then to make up the right reckoning, is to give to the year of the rest
fortynine years, and to the Iubile fifty, and so they shall fall together at
every seventh Iubile, in threehundreth and fifty years. Seven times forty
nine, makes but three hundredth and forty three years.

Three sorts of reckoning amongst the Jews. The three years are not three
full years.
When the land is said to rest for three years, it is not meant here of three
complete years; the Hebrews have three sorts of reckonings, the first
reckoning is, excluso utroque termino; their second reckoning was incluso
utroque termino; their third sort of reckoning was, excluso uno termino and
incluso altero. Example of the first, when they are both excluded, Matthew
says, cap. 17.1. six days after, the other Evangelists say, eight days
after, Marc. 9.2. Luc. 9.4. including both the terms. And thus the Evangelists
are reconciled. The 3 sort of reckning is, including one of the terms, and
excluding the other; as they were to Circumcise their children the eight day,
if the child had lived seven days, and a part of the eight, he was to be
circumcised, as if he had lived complete eight days; therefore the Jews say,
that dies legis non est a tempore ad tempus, that is, it is not to be
understood, de completo tempore, of the full time; so the three years wherein
the Lord promised to bless their land, are not to be reckoned for three whole
years, but excluso utroque termino, two half years and a whole year, Deuteronomy.
5.1. At the end of every seventh year thou shall make a release, mikketz
should not be translated, (...) a fine, pro
A fine, but in fine, Deuteronomy. 31.30. putting beth for mem.

The land rested three years, How the land rested three years together.
but not three complete years, but one whole year and two half years,
excluso utroque termino; they did sow their Corn in Shebhat, answering to our
January; and they reaped their Barley in Nisan, answering to our March; and
they reaped their Wheat at the Pentecost, the year before the Iubile; when the
rest and the Iubile fell together, they reaped their Corn in Nisan, which
served them till Tishri; Annus cempletus. currens.

and this half year was called the first year of the three years rest; then
the year of the Iubile began in Tishri, which was a complete or a full year,
and this was the second year of the Rest; and after the Iubile, the Corns
were sown in Shebhat again, and reaped in Nisan, and this half year was
counted the third year; and this was annus currens, but not completus.

In the fiftieth Iubile from the Creation of the world, the seventh Sabbath of
the Land and the first Iubile began both in one year.

After Joshua had fought against the Canaanites for six years, the Lord
commanded the land to rest the seventh year, reckoning the seventh year and
Iubile from Tishri.

How the Iubile and the seventh year of the rest, fell both together, see this
Figure following.

A figure to show when the seventh year of the Rest and the Jubilee fell both
in one year.


Also there were no Jubilees reckoned until Joshua had conquered the land, yet
if ye will reckon from the Creation of the world, till the days of Joshua,
3500 years, which will make up just fifty Iubilies, we may reckon this way,
per tempus prolepticum, which is neither postulatitium nor historicum; tempus
postulatitium they call this, when the Kings of Egypt deduced their genealogies
thirteen thousand years, before the Creation this is a false reckoning; but
tempus prolepticum, is this, when they reckoned seven hundred years before the
Creation, to make the Sun, the Moon, and the year of the Indiction to fall
in one year; and so does Scaliger reckon; and thus we may reckon the Jubilees
ascending up to the Creation, Tempus postulatitium prolepticum historicum.

not per tempus historicum, nor tempus postulatitium, but per tempus
prolepticum; but when we reckon from Joshua's days descending to the time of
Christ's death, this is per tempus historicum, the Scripture shows us just
twenty nine Jubilees from Joshua to Christ, then was the acceptable time, and
the day of great deliverance, Luc. 4.18. and then all the Jubilees ceased.

The difference betwixt the seventh year of release, The difference betwixt
the privileges of the seventh year and the Iubile.
and the year of the Iubile was this, in the seventh year the Hebrew servant
was released, and if he had married a stranger, his wife and his children were
not released; but in the year of the Iubile they were released. Secondly, the
morgaged lands in the seventh year were restored, to the last Morgager; but in
the year of the Iubile the Land was restored to the proper inheritor.

The Lord appointed these Iubiles, First, Why the Iubile was appointed.
that the poor might not be excluded from their inheritance; Secondly, he
instituted them that they might keep a right chronology and reckoning of
times; for as the Greeks did reckon by their Olympiades, and the Latins by
their Lustra; So did the Hebrews by their Iubiles. Thirdly, he instituted
these Iubiles, that they might be a type to them of their full deliverance by
Christ. Esaias. 61.2. Luc. 4.10.

The extent of the remission under the Gospel, above the remission under the
Gospel, above the remission under the Law.
The Remission of the Iubile exceeded the remission of the seventh year seven
times, and Christ extended the remission under the Gospel as far above the
Iubile, as the Iubile is above the seventh year to seventy times seven times:
Peter would have restrained this remission to seven only, Mat. 18.21. but
Christ extends it far above seven times or seventy times, but he says that
we should forgive our brother seventy times seven.

Esaias. 66.22. then we shall rest from our labors and our sins, and the
punishment of them; then the earth shall rest from the burdens under which it
groneth now, Romans 8.22. and the sun, qui jam anhelat ad locum suum, (...)
anhelavit.
Eccles. 1.5. Who now is weary in running of his course, shall rest, and there
shall be no more need of his light, Revel. 22.5. Then all our debts shall be
fully pardoned, and we shall be fully restored to our inheritance which we have
morgaged: when the Priests went about the fortyninth year, and proclaimed that
the fiftieth year was at hand, were not these glad news to the poor, and to
those who were in debt; so when the Ministers of the Gospel, Lift up their
voice like a Trumpet, Esaias. 58.2. and proclaim to us, that the year of the
Iubile is at hand; should not poor and miserable sinners rejoice, and lift up
their heads because their redemption draws near, Luc. 21.28.

Commandment V. EXERCITAT. XXIIII. Of the maintenance of the Priests under the
Law. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 5.
Number. 18.21. And behold I have given the children of Levi, all the tenth in
Israel, etc.
LEt us consider here, first, who pays tithes. Secondly, to whom they were
paid. Thirdly, for what end they were paid. Fourthly, what things the Priests
and the Levites had beside: the tithes, and lastly, the blessing upon those who
paid their tithes.

First, the people paid their tithes to the Levites, because the Levites
Adhaerebant Sacerdotibus, they were joined to the Priests, Number. 18.2. And thy
brethren also of the Tribe of Levi, of the tribe of thy father, bring them with
the [Vaijlavu] ut adherescant tibi, that they may be joined unto thee; the
children of Levi called Levites, (...) filius adhaesienis sic dictus a matre
quia putabat maritum sibi adhaesurum a (...) adhesit and hic, aliudit dominus,
cum dicit (...) ut ado^restant.
were adjuncts to the Priests, and therefore the people paid the tithe to them.

The second thing to be considered here, is to whom they paid tithe, the
people paid their tithe to the Levites.

Churchmen, (...) decimas do vel decimas accipio. Answ.
the Pharisie said I tithe, that is, I pay tithe. Luc. 18.12.

(...) docentes. (...) separati.
All the Pharisees were not teaching Pharisees, they were not all [Porashim]
Docentes, but some were [Parushim] vel (...), separati; and of these some
manured the ground, and were Laike Pharisees, as we may call them; and those
paid tithe as well as others.

Then the Levites paid their tithes to the Priests. Sometimes the Priests are
called Levites in the Scripture, Priest, sometimes called Levites.
as Ezekiel. 44.15. The Priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok; therefore
although when the people are commanded to pay their tithes, the Levites are
only mentioned, yet the Priests are comprehended under the name of Levites,
because the tithes belonged to the Priesthood only; when the Priests and the
Levites are taken Composite, then the tithes belong to them both jointly; but
when they are taken opposite, then the people must pay their tithe to the
Levites, and the Levites must pay their tithe to the Priest, Heb. 7.5. The
sons of Levi who receives the office of Priesthood, have Commandment to take
tithes of the people.

Why the Lord would have the Levites pay tithes.
The Levites paid to the Priest the tithe of the tithes, although they had no
inheritance in the land, yet the Lord would have them to honor him with a heave
offering, and it was reckoned to them as if they had possessions and Lands; and
besides this, they paid tithes of the ground of the suburb, and fields which
were given them; therefore, Number. 18.28.29, Thus you also shall offer an heave
offering unto the Lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of
Israel, and ye shall give thereof the Lords heave offering to Aaron the Priest
out of all your gifts ye shall offer, etc.

Thirdly, to what end they were paid; the tithes were given as a sign of
homage, and thankfulness to God, Prove. 3.9. Honor the Lord with th y
substan, Why the tithes were paid.
and with the first fruits of all thine increase; and as Kings have their
tributes paid unto them for the maintenance of their attendance, Romans 13.6.7.
So the Lord will have his tribute paid to him, for the maintenance of his
servants the Priests; therefore the tithe is called his heave offering, Levit.
27.30. and before the Law was given, Jacob paid them to the Lord, Genesis 28.22.
A^raham and Jacob paid tithes before the law.
and Abraham the tenth generation from Sem paid them to Melchizedecke the
Priest, and the Lord appointed them for the Priests, Number. 18.28.

Now that we may understand what great plenty and a boundance, the Levites had,
who had the Lord for their portion. Number. 18.20. Deuteronomy. 18.2. Ezekiel. 44.28. The
great plenty which the Levite, had for their service.
Let us consider what they had in particular.

First, they had a part of the meatoffering called Mincha. Secondly, they had a
part of the peace offering, the breast, and the shoulder and skin of the burnt
offering, Number. 18.18. Levit. 7.13. Thirdly, they had the first fruits of the
Corn, of the wine, and of the oil, [Reshith] prestantissimum, (...) primitie
primiti^^um (...) primitiae.
the best of them and the fat of the oil, Number. 18.12. Deuteronomy. 18.4. and they had
[Biccurim] the first fruits. The difference Betwixt [Biccurim] and [Reshith]
was this; Reshith were the first fruits which the Levites took from the
people; but Biccurim were the first fruits which the people presented to the
Lord, and the Lord gave them to the Priests, Number. 18.13. What so ever is first
ripe in the Land shall be thine; Reshith was the first of the first fruits,
and Biccurim were the first fruits themselves.

It was not determined by the Law how much they should offer here, What every
one was to offer of their first ^ruits.
but the Doctors of the Jews determined afterward, that none should offer
less than one of sixty, and none should offer more than one of forty, and the
middle sort one of fifty, and they called him who offered one of sixty; (...)
Oculus malus. (...) Oculus bonus. (...) Oculus inter utrumque.
the man with the evil eye, or the covetous eye, or the covetous man, Prove.
23.6. eat not the bread of him who has an evil eye, that is, of a covetous
man; and he who paid one of forty, they called him the man with the good eye,
Ecclus. 35.8. Give the Lord his honor with a good eye, and diminish not the
first fruits of thine hand, and he who paid one of fifty, they called him, the
man with the middle eye.

(...) Obl^to magna.
This was called [Tereumah Gedolah] the great heave offering by way of
excellency, and they paid this, not only of things commanded in the Law, but
also of their oats, Lentiles, and fitches: although these served not for the
sustentation of man; but only in time of famine mine to satisfy their hunger;
yet they paid them, and they paid also tithe of Anise and Mint, which did
grow in their gardens, which our Lord does not blame, Matthew. 23. for he adds,
these things ye should have done: all these, because they were not
determinated by the law, they gave at least to the Priests the sixty part, so
they gave the sixty part of their wool in their Tereumah Gedolah to the Priest.

The Priests and Levites had the f^ee^ill offerings and the estimation of male
and female and according to their ability and sex.
Besides these first fruits which they were bound to pay, they paid likewise
free will offerings, Levit. 7.16. So when they made a singular vow, they were
valued according to their age, and according to their sex, Levit. 27.3.4. The
estimation of the male from twenty year old, even unto sixty, was fifty
Shekels of Silver, after the Shekell of the sanctuary; and the estimation of
the female was thirty. Again, from five year old to twenty, the estimation of
the male was twenty Shekels, and of the female ten. Thirdly, from a month old
to five years old, the estimation of the male was five; and the female was
three Shekels of silver. Fourthly, if they were past sixty years and above,
the estimation of the male was fifteen shekels: and of the female, ten
shekels. Fifthly, the poorer were valued after the valuation of the Priests,
according to their ability, and all these came for the maintenance of the
Priests. So they had a part of things consecrated, Levit. 7.35. Number. 18.13.

The Levites had the tenth part of all the fruits which did grow in Israel;
then the Priests got Decimas Decima^um the tithe of the tithes from the
Levites: the husband man paid to the Levites the tenth of his whole increase,
(...) Decima prima. (...) Decima ex Decima.
and this was called [Magnasar rishon] the first tithe; and the Levites paid
out of this, the tenth to the Priests, which was the hundredth part of the
husband man's increase [Magnasar min Hamagnasar] decima ex decima.

The third tithe was given to the poor, and it was the ninth part of the whole
increase. Tobit. 1.7.8. It was called [Magnasar shani] the second tithe, (...)
Decima secunda, vel secundi anni. (...) Decima tertia, vel tertij anni.
and in the first and second year, this tithe was reserved by the husband man,
and either taken up to Jerusalem, or else sold and put in money, that the
Levite, the widow and the poor might eat of it there at the three great
feasts, and it differed nothing from the tithe of the third year, but only in
the use, as Maimony shows, and every third year it was given to the poor,
but every first and second year it was given to the Priest, and to the Levite,
and to the widow, and they did eat it before the Lord in Jerusalem, by this
we may perceive how the husbandman paid the ninth part of his whole increase
every year: Let us put this case, The husbandman paid the most part of his
increase.
a husbandman has an hundredth and two logs of oil, of this he was to pay two
to the Lord, which was his Tereumah Gedolah, and this was one of fifty; and
then ten to the Levites, and nine of the hundredth, to the poor for the second
tithe, so that of an hundredth and two logs, he paid twenty and one, which was
the fifth part of the hundredth, and some more.

They had the first borne of man and beast.
Moreover, they had the first borne of all sorts of cattle, as of sheep,
beeves, and goats; and the price of the rest which were to be redeemed
according to the Priests estimation. Likewise the first borne of man redeemed
at five shekels the man, Ezekiel. 44.30. Neh. 10.36. And when all the males
appeared before the Lord three times in the year; none of them must come empty
handed; all these the Priests got.

And besides all this, the Levites had forty eight cities, and two thousand
cubits of ground round about them on every side, They had 48 cities and so
much ground about them.
with their Cattle and flocks; the number of the Levites were but twenty
three thousand, Number. 26. The tribe of Asher was fifty three thousand, and two
hundredth; and the tribe of Nephthali was forty five thousand and four
hundredth; and the tribe of Issachar, was sixty four thousand and three
hundredth, and the tribe of Dan, was sixty four thousand and four hundredth,
and yet the greatest of them all, had but ninteene Cities; but the Levites
being but few in number, got more Cities than any of them all; and the reason
was, The Levites were not the tenth part of the people yet they had the tenth
part of the in^rease.
because the Lord would provide liberally for them; the Levites who were not
the tenth part of the people, yet they got the tenth part of the increase of
the Land, and Priests who were but a small number in respect of the Levites,
yet they got the hundredth part of the increase of the Land, and because the
Priests had such a plentiful portion, therefore the Lord alludeth to this,
Iere. 13.14. I will satiate the soul of the Priest with fatness.

The Lord was their portion, Number. 18.20. Deuteronomy, 18.1. Ezekiel. 44.28. and the godly
allude to this, Psalm. 73.26. God is my part for ever, Psalm. 142.6. Thou art my
part in the Land of the Living, Lam. 3.24. The Lord is my part, says my soul,
therefore I will hope in him. Psalm. 16, The Hebrews repeat words to signify
that nothing should be omitted. (...) Et praecipuum omnium primitiarum ex
omnibus, et omnis oblationis omnium ex omnibus oblationibus vestris
Sacerdoesto. Vox (...) hic quinquies repetitur. The blessing of God upon those
who paid their tithes.
the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.

And see what a care the Lord had that they should want none of these. Ezekiel.
44.30. And the first of all the first fruits of all things, and every oblation
of all of every sort, shall be the Priests; the Hebrews when they would have a
thing precisely kept, they double this word [Col] as Psalm. 119.128. Therefore I
esteem all thy precepts, concerning all things to be right, So here the first
of all the first fruits of all things, etc.

The last thing to be considered here, is the blessing of God upon those who
paid their tithes, they were to pay to the Priests the first fruits, and
tithes of all their increase of every sort. And the first of their dough That
he might cause the blessing rest in their house, Ezekiel. 44. So Mal. 3.10. Bring
ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house,
and prove me now here with, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the
windows of heaven, and power you out a blessing, that there shall not be room
enough to receive it, Deuteronomy, 16.74. Thou shall rejoice in the feast before the
Lord, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy maid servant, and the Levite,
and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, The Lord had four, and
the Priest had four at the eating of the Tithe of the third year as the
Hebrews say.
that are within thy gates; And the Hebrews say, the Levite, the fatherless,
the stranger, and the widow, four that belong to me, answerable to four that
belong to thee, thy son, thy daughter, thy man and thy maid; if thou comfort
those that are mine, I will bless and comfort these that are thine, and they
say, when a man pays his tithes, he is the husbandman, and God Almighty is
the Priest; but when he pays them not, then God is the husbandman, and he is
the Priest, and then, Ten Akers of Vine shall yield but one Bath. Esaias, 5.8.

Psalm. 23.1. here was none of the Priests that did shut the doors of Gods
sanctuary or kindle fire upon his Altar for naught, Malac. 1.10.

EXERCITAT. XXV. The Jews might not kill the damme sitting upon the young
ones. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 5.
Levit. 22.6. If the damme be sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou
shall not take the damme with the young, etc. That it may be well with thee and
that thou may prolong thy days.
God made choice of Canaan after a special manner.
The earth is the Lords, and the fullness thereof. Psalm. 23.1. Yet the Lord
made choice of Canaan in a special manner, and therefore he says, the Land is
mine, Levit. 25.23. Thence it is called Emmanuels Land, Esaias. 8 8. and other
Lands the Lord calls polluted Lands, Amos. 7.17. Thou shall dye in a polluted
Land. So the people who dwelt in Canaan were the Lords, after a special
manner, and all that which belonged unto them, therefore he forbids to take
usury of his people.

The damme fitting on the young ones was not a type.
When the Lord forbids them to kill the damme with the young ones; the damme
sitting upon the young ones, was not a type to the Jews here, no more then the
ox when he trod out their corn; but there was a tropologicall sense here,
to teach them manners; but Canaan it self was a type to them.

By this Law the Lord taught them mercy to all men, and reverence to their
parents.
God will have them to show mercy upon the beasts, and the birds, and he will
not have the damme, and the young killed together; and Targum Jonathan
paraphraseth it thus, as your heavenly Father is merciful in heaven, so be ye
merciful in earth. The farthest extent and meaning of this Law is, that they
should abstain from cruelty, Hos. 10.14. Genesis 32.11. To kill the Mother, and
the Children, for as God has not regard of Oxen, 1 Cor. 8.9. his chief regard
was not to the Ox, when he forbids to muzzle his mouth, but that the
Minister should have maintenance: so the Lords chief regard, is not here that
the Damme be spared, but that Parents be reverenced.

God taught the Jews in their infancy sundry ways. First, he taught them by
their apparel, God taught the Jews many ways.
that they should not wear Linsey wolsey; so that the Priests should wear
linen in the Sanctuary, and wool out of the Sanctuary, Ezekiel. 44.17. and so by
their meats, putting a distinction betwixt clean and unclean; and so by their
houses, when he commanded the Law to be written upon the posts of their doors,
and by the Battlements to be put about their new houses, and so by their
husbandry, when he commanded them not to plow with an Ox and an Ass, and not
to sow their fields 'with diverse sorts of seed? So by their flocks to offer
their first borne of them to him; and here when they were walking in the
fields, if a birds nest were before them in the way, either in a tree, or upon
the ground, they were commanded to spare the damme; to teach them reverence to
their Parents; wheresoever they looked, they had some instruction before them.

He forbids them to kill the Damme and the young ones together; Why God would
not have the Jews to kill the Damme with the young ones.
he commanded them to eat flesh after the flood, but here he would restrain
their appetite, that they should not kill both the Damme and the young ones; and
which is more, the Lord forbids when they are about to sacrifice, that they
kill not the Cow or the Ewe, and their young ones both in one day, Levit.
22.27. So the Jews say that they might not kill the damme upon the young ones
although it were for cleansed of the Leprosy, Lev. 14.4. And if he will not
have this done for his own worship, far less will he have men do it for
their own private use, God will have mercy and not sacrifice, Matthew. 9.13. he
forbids them to kill the Dam, but they might take the young ones; he will not
have them like the Pythagoreans who thought it unlawful to kill any beast or
foul, neither will he have them like Barbarians who kill all without respect,
but he will have them kill the young ones and spare the old, to teach them
reverence toward their parents; No creature but man may make use of it.
there is no creature, but man may make some use of it, either to make it the
object of his pity, or else to imitate it, as the Storke, the Crane, and
Swallows, Who know their times, Iere. 8.7. yea the Lord sends the sluggard
to the pismire to learn, Prove, 6.6.

Honor thy father and thy mother, is the greatest Commandment in the second
table, and it has this promise annexed unto it, that they who honor their
parents shall live a long life; and here the Lord joyneth it to the meanest of
all the Commandments which the Jews call Praeceptum leve, the Lord set the
ceremonies [Sejag Latorah] as a hedge about the Law; (...)
and as the hedge is a fence to keep out beasts; so were these ceremonies set
as a hedge to keep the Jews, that they should not break in to violate the
moral.

This law to spare the Damme upon the young ones, binds us not now.
If a man should find a bird fitting in this land upon her young ones, he is not
bound by this Law to spare her, more then he is bound, when he reapeth his
field to leave the gleanings ungathered; yet he is bound by the Moral Law to
show pity to his beast, and so upon the foul, neither could he promise to
himself longer life, if he should do so: but only he must look to the
moral precept, which obliges man still, when these ceremonies are abolished.

How the promise is annexed to this ceremonial precept, and to the moral
precept. Simile.




The keeping of the whole Commandments has this promise of long life annexed
unto it, Prove. 3.1.2. my son forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my
Commandments, for length of days, and long life and peace, shall they add
unto thee, so Deuteronomy. 8.1. and 30.16. But it is more particulary annexed to this
Commandment, and it is called the first Commandment with promise, Ephesians. 6.2.

Commandment. VI. EXERCITAT. XXVI. That the Jews might eat no blood. A
ceremonial appendix of Command. 6.
Deuteronomy. 12.24. Thou shall not eat it, thou shall power it upon the earth as
water.
The blood is not the form to the body.
THe Lord forbids the Jews his people to eat blood, because the life is in
the blood, the blood is not the form to the living body, because one body
cannot be the form to another; neither is it a part of the body, for it
nourishes the rest of the body, and one part nourishes not another; and it is
more excellent than milk, melancholy, or marrow; for they have their
residence in some particular parts of the body, but the blood is dispersed
through the whole body, and none of those are profitable to the body, unless
they be mixed with blood.

Why the life is said to be in the blood.
The life is said to be in the blood, because the natural heat is preserved in
the body by blood; the blood it self is a thing naturally cold, and it is the
heat of the spirits which comes from the heart that heateth the body, and the
blood but keeps in the heat, as a man's clothes do quae non calefaciunt sed
recalefaciunt, it but keeps in the spirits which are in the heart; but when
the blood is let out, then the spirits fail, and the blood is congealed.

Although the soul be said to be in the blood, The blood is not the seat of
the soul.
yet we must not think that the blood is the seat of the soul; because the
seat of the soul is some principal member of the body, but the blood is not
a member of the body; the seat of the soul is a firm, and a permament thing,
and it has sense, especially the Touch, but the blood in it self has no
sense, wherefore it is not the seat of the soul, but the common instrument,
and Vehiculum which carries the spirits.

The life is in the blood, The passions show themselves in the blood.
all the passions of man show themselves in the blood, as the blood is hot
with anger, it flies for fear, it grows slow for grief, and spreads it
self abroad for joy, and in shame, it makes the face to blush.

The life is in the blood, therefore David says, Psalm. 30.10. What profit is
in my blood, that is, in my life, and Virgil calls it the purpure soul.

God taught his people to abstain from blood for two reasons; First, Why God
would have his people abstain from blood.
in reverence of the blood of Christ which was to expiate their sins,
wherefore the blood was called the atonement of the soul, Levit. chap. 17.11.
that is, the soul or the life of the beast, is made the ransom for the soul
or life of man, and therefore it should not be eaten; and for this cause they
were commanded to cover it in the earth with dust: contrary to this, is that,
Job 16.18. They were to cover the blood.
Let not the earth cover my blood, and Ezekiel. 24.7, 8. Their blood is in the
midst of her, she set it upon the top of a Rock, she powered it not upon the
ground to cover it with dust: that it might cause fury to come up to take
vengeance, I have set her blood upon the top of a Rock that it should not be
covered But in this respect it is not an appendix of the sixth Commandment, but
in another respect; the Lord commanded them to abstain from blood, and not to
eat it, to teach them to abstain from cruelty, and then it is a ceremonial
appendix of the sixth Commandment.

How the Romans by degrees became cruel.
The corruption of man is such, when he beholds cruel things then he
begins to be more cruel; the Romans used at the first to set wild beasts
upon the stage to kill one another; and after this they came to be delighted to
see Gladiators, and Fensers kill one another; and thirdly they delighted to see
men cast unto the wild beasts, so that from the sight of killing of beasts,
they delighted to see men killed; and so from eating of blood, they might have
been drawn to cruelty, and shedding of the blood of men; for those who are
but acquainted with the shedding of the blood of Beasts, do care little for
the shedding of the blood of men; Nimrod was a mighty hunter, Genesis 10.9. and
then he became a cruel murderer of men; Pythagoras, that he might teach men
to abstain from blood, taught men always to abstain from the shedding of the
blood of Beasts.



What part of this Law is moral.
Thus much of the law is perpetual, that they should not eat membrum de vivo,
or while it is palpitans sanguis, that is the moral precept, Ezekiel. 33.25. Ye
eat with the blood, which must be understood, ye eat while the life is in the
blood; this is a breach of the moral precept, and it is joined here by the
Prophet with other moral transgressions, Ye lift up your eyes to your Idols,
ye shed blood, and ye eat blood. But this is the Ceremonial part simply to
eat blood, the Lord commands to give that which dyed of it self to the
stranger, Deuteronomy. 14.21. But if this were a moral precept simply, to abstain
from Blood, then no stranger might eat Blood, or eat that which dyed of it
self; To eat blood simply was not a moral Law.
and the Apostles, Act. 15.20. renewed this precept of abstinence from blood,
Why the Apostles renewed this precept.
and they give this to be the reason, verse. 21. For Moses of old time had in
every city those that preach him, being read in their Synagogues every Sabbath
day, that is, seeing Moses ceremonial law is yet professed by the Jews, ye
must bear with the weak Jews until ye and they be fully united, and this
occasion being taken away, the law cease.

He commanded the Jews to abstain from blood, Why he commanded the Jews to
abstain from blood.
because the Church was in her infancy yet; therefore to command the Jews
still to abstain from blood, it is even all one, as if one should command that
a man should be continually nursed with milk, because he sucked milk when he
was a child.

Moses Law as well as to eat the blood.

Noah, and it was one of the seven precepts; Why the Apostle commanded
abstinence from blood.
but abstinence from fat, was not commanded until the ceremonial law was
given, Levit. 3.16.17. and because the Jews esteemed more of this interdiction
of eating of blood, therefore the Apostles commanded them abstinence from it.

Tertulian in his Apology for the Christians shows that they would not eat
blood or strangled, Tertullian in Apolog. c. 9.
and that the heathen used to come to them with bottles of blood, and to force
them to drink of it: by this it appeared, that the Christians in his time
abstained from blood; but Beatus Renanus commenting upon that place of
Tertullian, notes well, that the Christians were too superstitious in that,
Nam citra^scandalum Iudaeorum fuit inscitia servare, they were bound only to
abstain from blood, that they might not offend the Jews.

Blandina the Martyer abstained from blood.

Pagans? How the Pagans charged the Christians with drinking of blood.
It is not likely that we drink the blood of Infants, who abstain from the
blood of beasts; the Council of Orleance is justly censured for renewing this
abstinence from blood, as Iudaizing in this point.

to eat that which is torn of beasts, Exodus 22.21. And here he forbids
them to eat blood.

EXERCITAT. XXVII. That the Jews might not seethe a Kid in the mothers milk,
to teach them not to be cruel. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 6.
Exodus 23.19. Thou shall not sees a Kid in the mothers milk.
A Philosopher in Egypt asked a Jew upon a time, why the Jews abstained from
Swines flesh, and would eat none of that which was holden to be most wholesome?
the Jew answered him by another question; What was the reason why the Egyptians
had so many Hieroglyphickes, and the Pythagoreans, their enigmaticall speeches?
were not those Symbolicall, and taught them some other thing? as ignem gladio
ne fodias, Pythagoras meaning was, that they should not provoke an angry man;
so the precepts of Moses commanding them to abstain from such and such beasts
as unclean, were Symbolicall, and implied some other thing.

This Commandment forbids not mixtures in Religion, How this precept is an
appendix of the sixth Commandment.
as an appendix of the second Commandment, but as an appendix of the sixth
Commandment, to abstain from cruelty, as not to take the damme sitting upon
the young ones, and not to muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treads out the
Corn.

Ye shall not sees a kid in the mothes milk; The diverse interpretation of
this precept.
this is not the meaning of the command, content your selves to eat the kid,
The true meaning of this precept.
but take head that ye eat not the damme also; neither is this the meaning of
it, ye shall not eat flesh with milk, as the Chaldee Paraphrast Paraphraseth
it; neither is this the meaning of it, take heed that ye sees not the kid in
the mothers milk, as the superstitious Jews expound it at this day; they will
not sees flesh, and milk in one pot, neither will they cut both flesh and
cheese with one knife; and amongst the precepts which they have written of
things lawful to be eaten, they forbid the eating of flesh, and milk
together; but the meaning of the place seems to be this; ye shall not eat of
a kid or of a Lamb, (for so the Seventy translate it) so long as it sucketh
the damme, for all this time it is as it were but milk; they might sacrifice
it when it was but eight days old, but not to eat of it so long as it was
sucking. 1 Samuel 7.9. Samuel took a sucking Lamb and offered.

The Lord forbids also, Exodus 22.31. To eat that which was torn by beasts;
the former Commandment that they should not sees a kid in the mothers milk
was a ceremonial law belonging to the sixth Commandment, Not to eat that
which was torn, is a ceremonial appendix both of the sixth and eight
Commandment.
but this Commandment that they should not eat of that which was torn by
beasts was an appendix both of the eight, and sixth Commandment, whereby he
taught them, both to abstain from blood, and from theft.

Levit. 15.17. Be read copulative? the soul which eats that which dies of
it self, and is torn by beasts; or disiunctive? that which dies of it self,
or is torn of beasts.

copulative, thus, if it dye of it self, and be torn of beasts, they might
not eat of it; but the true reading is disiunctive? if it dye of it self, or
be torn, (as Iunius reads it) for the law says expressly, that that which
is torn is unclean, although it dye not first; and then be torn; and some of
the Jews make that more unclean which is torn, then that which dies of it
self; one demanded the question of R, Joseph Gersaeus, Whether the beast that
dyed of it self, or that which was torn, was the more unclean.
why he writ the Law rather upon the skin of a beast that dyed of it self,
than upon the skin of a beast that was torn? he answered them by this
comparison, I tell you whereunto I liken the beast that dies of it self, and
that which is torn; to two malefactors who are adjudged to dye, the one
malefactor the judge himself kills, and the other the hangman kills; so
they hold, that that which dyed of it self was not so unclean, as that which
was torn by wild beasts.

Coloss. 2.21. Even as parents forbid their little children to touch this, or
handle that, whereas they forbid them when they come to understanding, to look
upon evil, God deals with the Jews as fathers do with little children.
or to hear evil. So under the Gospel, the prohibition is given chiefly to
the nobler senses, hearing and seeing, and not so much to the base senses,
touching, and tasting.

Commandment VII. EXERCITAT. XXVIII. When a Bastard might enter into the
Congregation under the Law. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 7.
Deuteronomy. 23.2. A Bastard shall not enter into the Congregation unto the tenth
generation.
THe Lord forbids here that a Bastard should enter into the congregation of
the Lord, unto the tenth generation, there are four things to be considered
here? First, who is called [Mamzer] a Bastard here; Secondly, What is meant by
entering into the congregation; Thirdly, That this is but a ceremonial Law;
What is meant by Bastard here.
and Lastly, That it is not meant of every sort of Bastard.

First, he is not called Mamzer here, if his father were an Hebrew, and his
mother a Gentile, as the Chaldee Paraphrast takes it, for then Obed the son
of Ruth the Moabitesse, should have been a Bastard.

Secondly, He is not called Mamzer or Spurius, who is borne of a Widow (as the
Hebrews hold) as if an Hebrew had married a captive woman, and had lain with
her and she fell with child, and it was in doubt whether he was the child of
the first husband or of the last. And so they hold that David begot Chiliab
upon Abigail, and that his mother called him Daniel, and his father Chiliab, 2 Samuel 2.2. and 1 Chro. 3.1. Because he was incerto patre; but this is one of
their dreams: neither is he called a Bastard, qui ex secundis nuptijs natus
est, as when a man marieth a Widow, and begeteth a child upon her her. The
Jews are most mistaken in this, Ben Syra in his Proverbes, says, Oculos tuos
absconde a muliere vidua, et ne concupiscas pulchritudinem ejus in cord tuo;
nam filij ejus, fiij scortationu^ sunt, hide thine eyes from a Widow Woman,
and be not taken with her beauty; for her children are the children of
fornication. And the same Ben Sira at the letter Samech, says, Ben syra inter
proverbia alphabeto. 2.
Scriba ducat virginem, et ne ducat eam quae maritu^ habuit, nam aquae virginis
tibi soli erunt, aqua^ vero eius qua maritu^ habuit ante te, alius praeter te
hausit, that is, let a scribe mary a Virgin, and let him not mary her who has
had an husband before; and content himself, with the waters of his own
cisterne, and not to drink of that water, where another has drawn before
him: where he alludeth to the phrase of the Scripture, which calls adultery
stolen waters, Prove. 9.17, Water put for seed.
And they put water for seed, Number. 24.7. So Moab, is his fathers water.

But the Jews were much mistaken in this, for the Apostle says. 1 Cor. 7.37.
If her husband be dead, she is at liberty, to marry whom she will, only in the
Lord, Romans 1 Timothy 5.14. Let the younger Widows mary. Therefore Mamzer here,
signifies him, qui ex incerto patre, et certa matre, natus est, whose mother
is known but not his father.

The second thing to be considered, is this, what is meant, by, entering into
the Congregation.

To enter into the Congregation, What is meant by entering into the Congregation.
is to bear charge amongst the people of God, and this is expressed by going
out and in before the people, Deuteronomy. 31.1. I am too old to go out and in before
this people, so, Act. 1.21. All the time that Jesus went out and in amongst us:
this is, to have a charge over the people, and in this sense the Bastard might
not enter into the Congregation, that is, he might have no charge, nor bear
rule amongst the people of God.

To bear charge expressed by dwelling.
Sometimes to bear charge amongst the people of God is expressed by dwelling
amongst them, as 1 King. 3.8. To dwell among the people, what.
Thy servant is in the midst of thy people whom thou have chosen, that is, he
reigns amongst them, and rules them, and so Psalm. 101.2. So to dwell amongst
the people is to be esteemed and to be in account amongst them, Genesis 23.10.
Ephron dwelt amongst the children of Heth, that is, he was a Ruler and a Prince
amongst them, and in this sense the bastard might not dwell amongst the people
of God.

Sometimes to dwell among the people is to dwell safely among them, so the
Shunamitish Woman said to the Prophet when he offered to speak to the King and
to the captains for her I dwell among my people, 1 King. 4.13. that is, I
dwell safely among them, and no man does me harm, and in this sense a bastard
might enter into the congregation.

To enter into the Congregation, is to enjoy all the privileges of the people
of God.
Again, to enter into the Congregation is, to enjoy all the privileges that
the people of God enjoyed, and in this sense, a Bastard might not enter in the
Congregagation. Nehemiah finds fault with the children of Israel, because
they married with the Moabites, and he gives the reason, because the Ammonite
and the Moabite, should not come into the Congregation for ever, Nehe. 13.1. So
by the like reason, the Bastard might not enter into the Congregation unto the
tenth generation, therefore they might not marry with them, Josh. 23.7. Ye shall
not come among the Nations, that is, ye shall not marry with them: there were
many other privileges which the Israelites enjoyed, whereof the Bastard was
not capable; the Israelite had this privilege to be set at liberty the seventh
year. So they might not take Usury of an Israelite, these privileges the
Bastard had not.

When he is secluded from the Congregation, The Bastard was not secluded from
the worship of God.
here it is not meant, that he is secluded from the worship of God, but by
Congregation here, is meant their civil society and meeting, Act. 19, 39. It
shall be determined (...), in a lawful congregation, that is, in a civil
meeting, they were admitted to the Temple, and to the worship of God.

Zach 9.6. A Bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, therefore it may seem that they
might not come to the Temple of God.

Bastard here is meant any vile or wicked man, A Bastard put for any vile
person.
that is not regenerate by the seed of grace.

Unto the tenth generation, that is, he should never enter, Nehem. 13.1.

This Law was ceremonial, and when the ceremonies were in force, it was not
meant of all sorts of Bastards.

There are three sorts of impurity set down in the Scriptures which defile the
children; Three sorts of impurities.
the first is peccatum innatum, that is, original sin, and all the children
of men are equally defiled with this, both those who are begotten in marriage,
and those who are begotten in adultery: the second sort of impurity which the
children do contract, is legal impurity, and this is peccatum agnatum:
Impuritas innata. agnata. imputata.

if the woman had vowed her child to be a perpetual Nazarite to the Lord, if
she had drunken any strong drink after the child was quick in her belly, she
defiled the child, and he might not be a Nazarite: this was but a ceremonial
uncleanness which hindered him, that he might not enter into the Congregation.
So if there were defects in the Priests birth, Defectus natalium. persona.
conjugij.

person, and marriage, which hindered him that he might not enter into the
Congregation. First, if he had been basely borne, he might not enter into the
Congregation. So if there were any defect in his person, or blemish in his
body, and the Canon law imitateth that yet, and calls it Impedimentu^
Canonicu^, Impedimentum canonicum.
or irregularity, especially if he wanted his left eye, that, they call oculum
Canonis. (...)
The third was defectus conjugij, Levit. 21.7. he might not marry [Hhalelah] a
profane woman, such a one as was repudiat from her husband, or one borne of a
whore, or a widow, Ezekiel, chapt. 44. verses 21, 22. All these were called
[Hhalelah] profane. And a Priest that married such a one, might not enter into
the Congregation to serve before the Lord; No defects in a man's person, or
birth do hinder him from entering into the Congregation under the Gospel.
this was impuritas agnata that hindered the Priest. Under the Gospel if a man
should lack an arm, or a leg, he might, notwithstanding of this, enter into
the Congregation; as an Eunuch is admitted to stand before the Lord, Esaias 56.
And if the defects of a man's person, and of his marriage, do not hinder him,
to stand before the Lord, so neither do the defects of a man's birth; although
he be basely born, yet he may enter into the congregation.

Imputed uncleanness of two sorts.
The third sort of impurity which defiles a man, is imputed uncleanness; and
it is of two sorts, either before God, or before the Magistrate. Before God,
the Lord may visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, who are
begotten in holy marriage; much more may he visit the sins of the fathers upon
the children who are begotten in whoredom, The Lord sometimes punishes the
whoredoms of the parents upon the children.
I will not have pity upon her children, because they are the children of
fornications, Hos. 2.4. And so he visited the whoredoms of Iezabel upon Ioram,
2 Kings 9.22. But if the children follow not the footsteps of their fathers,
then the Lord imputes not the sins of the fathers unto the children; if the
adulterer repent him of his adultery, then God pardons him for his adultery:
So he will not lay the fathers adultery to the child's charge, if he follow not
his fathers footsteps.

The second sort of imputation is by the Magistrate, How the Magistrate may
impute the parents whoredoms to the children.
for the restraining of whoredom, Thou shall not inherit with us, because
thou art the son of a strange woman. Iud. 10.2. The equity of this Law is,
because they are not known to be their fathers children; and if the children
of the concubines succeeded not to their fathers inheritance, much less should
the children of the harlots; So they exclude them from bearing any civil
charge. But this defect is taken away, first, by their good education, which
washes away this blot; and then they are reabled by the Law, and made capable
of honors. And this should be no more a blot unto them, than if they wanted a
hand or a leg; and as we blame not the stolen seed when it is sown, and
grows up, but these who stole the seed; Talmud, Talmud torah. cap. 1. fol.
10.
that the Priest excels the Levite; and the Levite excels the Israelite;
and the Israelite excels the Mamzer; and the Mamzer excels the Nethinim,
and the Nethinim the Proselyte; but they say if the Priest be unskilful in the
law, and an Idiot, and the Mamzer be the son or a scholar of the wise; then he
excels the Priest: Notable men in the Church who have been Bastards.
There have been profitable men in the Church who were basely borne, as
Lumbard, Gratian, and Comester, who were three bastards borne of one whore, and
Darius Nothus among the Persian Kings, and Hercules.

When the Lord debarred them to the tenth generation, this is a ceremonial
Law, and not a Moral; This Law is ceremonial, and not moral.
David the tent fromh Pharez incestuously begotten, was King in Israel, and if
this were a moral precept, then Gods Justice should exceed his mercy in the
Church, he shows mercy to the thousand generation, but his Justice should
extend it self for ever.

What sort of Bastard is meant here.
Lastly, it is not meant here of every bastard, but of him who is borne of a
common harlot, Iephthe was basely borne, and yet he had, the charge of the
people of God.

Four sorts of sins
The Lawyers mark that there are four sorts of sons, first, some natural,
and Legitimate, secondly, some Legitimate, but not natural; thirdly, some
natural and not legitimate; and fourthly, some neither natural, nor
legitimate.

Natural and legitimate are those who are borne in holy wedlock. Secondly,
legitimate and not natural are those who are adopted children; (...) collecti
ab (...) collegit congregavit,
and such the Jews called [Asuphim] collecti, Psalm. 27.10. Thirdly, natural
but not legitimate, as those who are borne of harlots, but not of common
harlots, and such are called Nothi; Lastly, neither natural nor legitimate, as
those who are borne of common harlots; such a one the Hebrews called Mamzer,
and the Latins call him Spurium; and the Lawiers call such children incertos,
quia incerto patre, sed certa matre, such as those might not enter into the
congregation.

Saul did to Jonathan, 1 Samuel 20.30. Thou have chosen the son of Iesse to thine
own confusion, and to the confusion of thy mothers nakedness, that is, all men
hearing, that thou love a man whom I hate, they will say; that thou art not
my son, but the son of a whore and a Bastard; and so this shall be a reproach
both to thee and to thy mother.

EXERCITAT. XXIX. The Priests Daughter that defiled her self with fornication
was to be burnt. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 7.
Levit. 21.19. And if any Priests Daughter defiled herself by playing the
whore, she profaneth her father, she shall be burnt with fire.
THe Priests Daughter if she committed whoredom was to be burnt quick, this
the Latins call Vivicomburium. So the King of Babel. Iere. 29.23. Caused roast
two adulterous Priests in the fire, because they lay with their neighbors
wives. She was to be burnt quick, Why the Priests daughter was to be burnt
quick.
because she had profaned her father the Priest. As Simeon, and Levi made their
father stink before the Sichemites, because of their vile murder, Genesis 34.30.
So the Priests Daughter committing whoredom profaneth him and makes him vile
in the eyes of the people. Secondly, she made the sacrifice of the Lord to be
abhorred. As the sons of Eli, lyeing with the women that came to the
Tabernacle, made the sacrifice of the Lord to be abhorred (for the people
judged of the sacrifice by the Priest; such Priest, such sacrifice) so when the
Priests Daughter committed whoredom, she made the sacrifice of the Priest to
be abhorred.

This sin deserved a fearful punishment, Christus typicus. mysticus.
Sacramentalis. proprie dictus.

because it was committed against the Lord Jesus in type.

Christ is set down to us, in the Scriptures, four manner of ways. First;
Christus typicus. Secondly, Christus Mysticus? Thirdly, Christus Sacramentalis;
and fourthly, Christus proprie dictus. When a profane man or woman defile
themselves with whoredom, and then do come to the holy Sacrament, thus they
defile Christ Sacramentally. So when they commit this sin; they offend the
Church, the Mystical Body of Christ, and they take one of his members, and
make it the member of an Harlot. So when the Priests Daughter committed
whoredom, she sinned against Christ in type.



Whether the man that lay with the Priests daughter, was ^urnt or not.
Not, and the Jews say, that they killed not two upon one day, unless they
were guilty of one and the self same crime, as the adulterer and the
adultresse were both put to dead upon one day; but they say, if one had lain
with the Priests Daughter, he was strangled, and she was burnt, and therefore
not put to death in one day.

The Jews afterward changed this sort of burning, and they burnt them,
pouring in hot Lead at their mouth, Combastio anima quid apud hebraeos.
and this is called Combustio animae, and so Jonathan the Paraphrast
paraphraseth it this ways, she shall be burnt pouring in hot Lead at her
mouth; Combusti per munus cali q^^d,
and this sort of burning they called also Combustio per manus coeli, that is,
as if they were stricken from the Heavens by Gods hand immediately; the ground
of this punishment they made to be this, because it is said of Nadab, and
Abihu, combusti sunt in animabus suis, they were burnt in their souls; there
was no burning seen in their bodies, but they looked like those who were
stricken with thunder from the heavens, their clothes were not burnt, Levit.
10.5. And their bodies were carried forth whole and buried; they looked as if
they had dyed a natural death, without any mark in their bodies: not unlike
unto this punishment was that kind of death, which Sir Roger Mortimer put King
Edward the second to, causing an hot broach to be put in his fundament, that
he might seem to be killed, per manus coeli, as the Hebrews speak.

The Priests Daughter was burnt, and not the man, Why the Priests daughter was
burnt, and not the man that lay with her.
because she defiled her fathers house. Sometimes the sin is more exaggerated
upon the Woman's part, then upon the man's; so Tamers fault was greater, then
Iudahs, because she knew him to be her father in Law; but Judah took her only
to be a whore, and not his Daughter in law. How sin is exaggerated both upon
the woman's and man's part.
Sometime again the sin is exaggerated more upon the man's part than upon the
woman's, Levit. 19.20. if an Israelite had lain with a stranger that was
betrothed, he was both to be beaten, and to offer a sacrifice, the woman was
only whipped, and offered not a sacrifice, because she was not an Israelitesse,
and sometimes the sin is equal one both their parts, as if a Priests son
had lain with a Priests Daughter, then they were both to be burnt.



A Ministers daughter now is not to be burnt if she commit whoredom.
because a Minister now under the Gospel is not a type of Christ to come, as
the Priest was under the Law: I grant she should be more severely punished then
another woman, in respect of Scandal; but not in this respect, as if her
father were a type of Christ. so the breach of the Sabbath under the law was
punished by death, because it was a pledge to them of all the benefits which
they were to receive in Christ to come; but the breach of the Sabbath now, is
not so to be punished, because our Sabbath now is not a type of that which we
are to receive in Christ to come.

The conclusion of this is, most holy, if they become profane, they shall
endure the greatest punishments in Hell fire.

EXERCITAT. XXX. How the woman suspected of adultery, was tried by her jealous
Husband. A ceremonial appendix of Command. 7.
Number. 5.12. If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him, and
a man lie with her carnally, and it be clept close, etc.
The manner how the woman suspected of adultery was tried.
THe Lord bearing with the infirmity of the jealous Jews, sets down this
trial, that the woman who was suspected of adultery, should be tried after
this manner. The husband brought her before the Priest, and the Priest brought
her before the Lord, and he charged her with an oath, that she should confess,
if she were guilty; then he took holy water, and mixed it with the dust of the
Sanctuary, and set it before her, and said; The Lord make thee a curse and an
oath among thy people, when he makes thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell:
and after that she had drunk the bitter water, if she was guilty, then this
curse lighted upon her; but if she was not guilty, then she was free and
conceived seed.

The Veil upon the woman's head, a token of subjection.
First, when her husband suspected her, he brought her before the Priest, and
her head was uncovered: her Veil was a token of subjection to her husband, and
therefore she stood bareheaded, as not being under her husband, for so is the
Scripture phrase, Romans 7.2.

The Priest wrote these curses in a book, The Priest wrote the curses in a
book.
and then blotted them out with the bitter water, Thou writest bitter things
against me, Job. 13.26. This was a bitter writing that was written against the
woman, and she was to drink it in water, even as the Israelites drank the
golden Calfe, being beaten to powder, which was their bitter sin.

She drank the bitter waters here, Why the woman was made to drink the bitter
waters.
Because stolen waters were sweet to her, Prove. 9.17. Sin is sweet in the
beginning, but sour in the end, and chiefly this sin of adultery, The
lips of the whore drop as an honey comb, and her mouth is smoother than
oil, but her end is bitter as wormwood, Prove. 5.4. Again, she drank these
waters out of an earthen vessel, Why she drank in an earthen vessel.
because she drank wine before in a golden Cup of whoredoms. Lastly, she
drank the waters that were mixed with the dust, Why mixed with the dust of the
Sanctuary.
in the floor of the Tabernacle, because she despised the Tabernacle of the
Lord, therefore now she has no part of it, but only the Serpents portion, to
drink the dust of it.

Her thigh did rot if she was guilty; That part of the body wherewithal a man
sins, is commonly punished.
the part of the body whereby a man sins, that is punished commonly. As
Absalom was punished by his hair. Zimri and Cosbi stricken through the belly,
and here the adultrous woman's thigh rotteth, and her belly swells; and David
alludeth to this curse, Psalm. 109.18. Let cursing come into his bowels like
water.

It is strange to see how God bears so much with the man here; First, when he
is married, God bears with man in many things.
if he did suspect that he had not married a Virgin, then the tokens of her
virginity were to be brought before him. Secondly, if he agreed not with his
wife, he was to give her the bil of divorcement, but she might not give it to
him. Thirdly, if he suspected her of adultery, she was to drink the bitter
waters, but not he, if she suspected him.

The woman that was innocent became fruitful, although before barren.
If the woman was innocent, then she incurred no danger by drinking the bitter
water, but if she had been barren before, then seminabat semen, she did give
seed, it is not rightly translated, she shall conceive seed.



Whether was this conception of the woman, a miracle.
When God, who is the Author of Nature contracteth Nature, or inlargeth it; it
is not a miracle, although it be a great work of God; when God blessed the
seventh year, so that it brought forth for three years, it was a great work,
but it was not a miracle; it was only an enlarging of Nature. Secundum
naturam. Prater naturam. Supra naturam. Contra. naturam.
God works not contrary to nature.
God works (...), but he works never, (...), God works (...), according
to Nature, when he makes a man see ordinarily; so he works (...), besides
Nature, when he made Stevens eye to see to the third Heaven, Act. 7. But when
he made the blind to see, this was (...). When a young woman conceives and
bears a child, this is according to Nature; but when Sarah bare a son,
After that it ceased to be with her after the manner of women, Genesis 18.11. This
was (...), besides nature; but when the Virgin Mary bare a son, this was
(...), above Nature.

The Lord reserveth four keys to himself.
She shall bring forth children, the Lord is he that gives children to the
barren, Ier 31.27. I will sow the house of Judah, and the house of Israel with
the seed of men. The paraphrast of Jerusalem, in Genesis 30.4. sets down four
keys, the first is, clavis foecunditatis ad aperiendum, the key of fertility
to open the womb, and sterilitatis ad oceludendum, of barrenness to shut the
womb, Genesis 30.22. God remembered Rahel, and opened her womb. Secondly, clavis
pluviae, Deu. 28.12. The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasures, the
heavens to give rain unto the Land in due season. The third is, clavis
cibationis, the key of feeding, Psalm. 145. Thou openest thine hand, and
satisfiest the desire of every living thing. And the fourth is, clavis
sepulcher the key of the grave, Ezekiel. 37.12. And I shall open your graves.

She shall give seed, The woman gives seed in generation.
the woman gives seed in the generation as well as the man; it should not be
translated, Si semen conceperit aut susceperit, for that is contrary to the
nature of the Active conjugation hiphil, and it is oftentimes spoken in the
Scriptures of trees and herbs, sementare semen, which cannot be translated
suscipere semen^. So Heb. 11.11. Sarah received strength, (...) quid.
(...), is not susceptio sed jactus, or the casting out of the seed; as when
the Husbandman casts the seed into the ground that is, (...), the casting out
of the seed. The Syriacke paraphrase does not paraphrase it rightly, ut
susceperit aut conceperit semen, that she might conceive seed.

The Anabaptiste deny that Jesus Christ took flesh of the Virgin Mary but that
he passed through her, The error of the Anabaptists.
as water does the row a golden Pipe; and their chief reason is, because as
they say, Women give no seed in generation, but this Text shows the contrary.
So Levit. 1^.2. And if Christ had not taken flesh of the Virgin Mary, he had
never been our Goel, but as our near kinseman, he has redeemed us from
eternal damnation.

Lastly observe, The Word of God like the bitter water.
as this bitter water made the guilty woman's thigh to rot, so it makes her
that is innocent to conceive. So the Word of God, which is the savor of death
unto death to the wicked, is the savor of life unto life to the godly.

The conclusion of this is, God finds out and punishes all sin, but
especially adultery, He will ^uagerwomen that break wedlock, Ezekiel. ^6.28. And
he shall be a swift witness against adulterers, Mal. 3.5.

Commandment. VIII. EXERCITAT. XXXI. Of devouring of holy things. A
ceremonial appendix of Command. 8.
Prove. 20.25. It is a snare for a man to devour that which is holy, and after
Vows to make inquiry,
Sacrilege compared to a snare.
IT is a snare for a man to devour holy things; a snare is set as a trape to
catch, Ier. 5.26. When the fowler lays his snare, he scatters some Corn
about it to draw the Birds to it; then the snare catches the Birds, and lastly
the fowler destroys them, when Sacrilegious men meddle with holy things to
devour them, they see some hope of gain there which allureth them, but there
is a snare laid secretly to catch them, and then the Lord who takes them,
justly destroys them for meddling with holy things.

The judgments of God upon those who have devoured holy things.
There was never one that meddled with those holy things, to devour them, or
turn them to their own private use and commodity, but it was a snare to him:
Iehoiakim took the Cedar out of the house of God, and seiled his own Windows
with it, and painted it with Vermilion that it should not be known to be the
seiling of the house of God, but see what judgments befell to him, quia
commiscuit se cum ista cedr^, because he meddled with that Cedar, and turned it
to his own use, the Lord says, They shall not lament for him, he shall be
buried with the burial of an Ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of
Jerusalem, Iere. 22.19. And see what judgments befell to Nebuchadnezzer
because he robbed the Temple? and to Belshazzer becaused he drank in the
Vessels of the House of the Lord? And what befell Sbishak King of Egypt, and to
Crassus for robbing of the Temple of the Lord? All these do let us see what a
snare it is to devour holy things. Abimelech when he burnt the house of Baal
Berith the Idol, his snare catched him quickly, because he meddled with the
house of Baal which he took to be a god, he was killed by a Woman with a
piece of a Millstone, Judge 9.53. How dangerous a thing is it then to rob the
house of the living God? Dionysius, the Tyrant, after he had robbed the Temple
of Apollo, and finding a good goal of wind, as he returned home, he jestingly
said, O how does sacrilege please the Gods! But here the Lord says, It is a
snare to devour that which is holy. When the Heathen were sacrificing,
Dionysius was.

So it was a snare to the sons of Eli, to take that part of the Sacrifice
which belonged not to them; so it was a snare to those in the days of Malachy,
Who withheld the tithes from the house of God, and so to the Priests who
changed and alienated their Portions, Ezekiel. 48.14. And so to those who delayed
to pay their vows.

So the Hebrews say, What it is to transgress in holy things.
that to transgress in the holy things, is sacrilege, as if they did eat the
tithe of their Corn and Wine within their own gates, Deu. 12, 17. So if they
did work with their first borne bullock, or sheare their first borne sheep,
Deuteronomy. 15.29. All these were devourers of holy things, and the Prophet alludeth
to this, (...) ditescere, cum puncto in dextro, et (...) decimare, cum puncto
in sinistro cornu.
Iere. 2.3. Israel was holiness to the Lord, and the first fruits of his
increase, all that devour him shall offend, evil shall come upon them, says
the Lord. The Hebrews say that tithes are the hedge of a man's riches, and they
say gnashar with the point in cornu dextro signifies ditescere, to grow rich
and in sinistro, decimas pendere, to pay the tithes, haec duo vno puncto
dirimuntur.

To devour holy things, avaritious and greedy men, are like the horse leech,
who has two Daughters which cry continually, give, give, but most of all they
are desirous to devour holy things, and to eat of the forbidden tree, the Jews
say that every Child in Israel knew his own portion, there were somethings
whereof both the Priest, his sons and daughters might eat, as the wave
breast, and heave shoulder. Levit. 10.14. There were other things which the
Priest and his sons might eat of, but not his daughters, As the sin
offering, whereof none of the blood came within the Tabernacle of the
Congregation to reconcile with all, Levit. 6.28. and there were other things
which the Priest might eat, but neither his son nor his daughter might eat
of them, as the meat offering that remained of the offering of the Lord, made
by fire, Levit. 10.12. for it was eaten beside the Altar. When men become
insatiable, and lust as the Israelites did at the graves of concupiscence, then
nothing will content them until they have Gods portion also; when the father
and the mother came before the Judges in Israel, (...) vrbis.
and complained that their son was [Zolel] a vile person, a drunkard, and a
glutton, Dut. 21.20. Then the Judges ordained that he should be stoned to
death; but when God the Father and the Church their Mother, do complain of
those devourers of holy things, what fearful Judgments must they undergo?

And after Vows to make inquiry, that is, after that thou have vowed a Vow to
seek how thou may illude or disanull it: the Jews said of old, that vows
were the hedge of the first fruits, and tithes the hedge of their riches; they
said that vows were the hedge of the first fruits, because when a man had
vowed, his vow would bind him to perform it, but these thought not that their
vow was such a hedge, when they sought to disannull it.

When they vowed of old, they said after this manner, The form of the Jews vow
of old.
my estimation be upon me fifty Shekels, or the estimation of this man, be upon
ine fifty shekels, this was the form of their vow: according to this David
says, My Vows are upon me, Psalm. 56.12. then they were bound to pay their
vows, and if they refused to pay, then they might take a pawn or pledge of
them, and force them to pay them as just debt, They might force them to pay
their vows.
and this was called the money of the souls estimation. 2 King. 12.4. When
they said, the estimation of this man be upon me, they meant, I am willing to
pay that, which such a man may be valued at; therefore when they made such a
vow, they might not enquire after it.

Thus God would not suffer his name to be abused. Better not to vow, than to
vow and not perform.
Eccles. 5.2, 4, 5, Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be
hasty to utter any thing before God; for God is in Heaven, and thou upon Earth,
therefore let thy words be few. When thou vowest a vow unto God, deserre not to
pay it, for he has no pleasure in fools; pay that which thou owe; better
it is that thou should not vow, than that thou should vow, and not pay.
And if so be, that the Lord will have a man that has but given his word for
his neighbor, not to give sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eye Lids,
until he have delivered himself, As the Roe from the hand of the hunter, and
as a bird from the hand of the fowler, Prove. 6, 1, 2, 3.4. Much more when he
has bound his soul with a bond, Number. 30.4.5. will he have him to perform his
vows, and not to enquire after them.

EXERCITAT. XXXII. Of the Jews Phylacteries. A ceremonial appendix for
keeping of all the Commandments.
Number. 15.38. Speak unto the Children of Israel, and bid them that they make
fringes upon the borders of their garments, etc.
THe Lord sitting himself to the nonage and infancy of the Jews Church, he
gave them helps; first for their judgment, secondly, for their affections,
and thirdly, for their memory.

God gave the Jews helps for their Judgments, memories and affections.
First, he gave them helps for their judgment, for as we, when we have a dull
Scholar, borrow comparisons from sensible things to teach him; so the Lord set
sensible figures and types before the Jews to teach them.

Secondly, he helped their affections by Music, and thirdly he helped their
memories by those Phylacteries or fringes, which he commanded them to put upon
the borders of their garments, Deuteronomy. 22.12. Exodus 13.9. And it shall be for a
sign unto thee, upon thine hand, and for a memorial, between thine eyes,
that is, the Phylactery shall be a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and a
memorial between thine eyes, and a signet upon thine heart; those things
which we account of we carry them as they were written in our hands, Esaias.
49.16. Behold I have graven thee upon the palms of mine hands, Prove. 7.3. Bind
them upon thy fingers, write them upon the Table of thine heart, say unto
wisdom thou art my sister, and call understanding thykinswoman. As they
carried, of old, the names of those whom they loved, in rings, and bracelets;
so he wills him to carry the Law of God graven, as it were his dearest Sister,
or like a Phylactery upon his hand.

The garment which the Jews wore, was a side coat like the garments which the
eastern people do wear at this day, and it was called Cesuth, Deuteronomy. 22.21.
(...) Tegumentum (...) Pallium.
Besides this, they had another garment which they called Megnil, a long Cloak
without sleeves: Thirdly, (...) vestis villosa, Pallium Iudaeis peculiare.
they had a Garment called Talith which was vestis superior, an upper Garment
used by the most of them when they traveled.

Their first Garment called Cesuth was parted below, which made the four wings
of it, two before and two behind, so their upper Garment called Talith was made
like the coat of a Lacky or footboy, divided in two parts.

Those fringes which they were commanded to put upon the borders of their
Garments, (...) institae.
and the wings of them, are called Gedilim threeds woven together, that is,
threeds which remain hanging down like small hairs, after the coat was
wo^^n, Number. 13.38. And then they had their Tephilim, their Phylacteries, and
the Phylacteries were put upon their heads, (...) peniculatus filorum textus.
Why the Jews wore Phylacterius.
and upon their arms, and those which were called TZitzith were put upon their
clothes, and the posts of their doors; he commanded them to wear those
fringes, and Phylacteries, to put them in remembrance to keep the law of the
Lord, and to distinguish the Jew from the heathen; and they say, three things
distinguished the Jew from the heathen, their Sabbath, their circumcision, and
their Phylacteries.

The Jews abused their Phylacteries.
They abused those fringes and Phylacteries, first enlarging them and making
them (...), Christ blamed them not for wearing Phylacteries, but for making
them too broad. Again, they abused them, making them helps only for their
prayers, and they derived Tephilim a Phylacterie a [Palal] orare, (...)
derivatur a (...) apponere, et non a (...) orare, ut quidam volunt.
whereas it should be derived from, [Taphal] apponere; Taphal signifies
adhaesionem vel conjunctionem, and the seventy translate it (...), Immobilia,
they were not then (...), helps to prayer, as the Jews superstitiously
imagined, but helps to put them in remembrance to keep the Law, and from this
superstition it came, that Elisha delighted still to were Talijoth his upper
Garment with the wings, therefore they called him Elisha with the wings, and
his superstitious prayers they called them his golden wings, and R Eleazer the
son of Joseph said, whosoever had Phylacteries upon his head, and upon his arm
and fringes upon his Garment, and a mark upon his door, all these would keep
him from sinning, as it is written, a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Eccles. 4.12. After this they became more impious in abusing them, making them
remedies against Witchcraft, (...) contra fascinationes, those Phylacteries
Varro called Prebia or Brebia, hence comes the word brief which is Satan
sign to save men from danger.

EXERCITAT. XXXIII. A ceremonial appendix for the breach of all the
Commandments.
Deuteronomy. 21.23. Cursed be he that hangs upon a tree.
THere are two parts in this punishment, a judicial part, and a ceremonial.
The judicial is this, A judicial and ceremonial part in the Law.
to put the malefactor to death; the ceremonial part is this, to hang him upon
a tree, but not to suffer him to hang all night, for then he defiles the Land.

When the adulterer is commanded to be put to death, the judicial part of the
Law, had but respect to the breach of one Commandment, to wit, the seventh;
The malefactor that was ^anged under the Law, was accu sed for breach of all
the Commandments.
but when the Law commanded to hang up the malefactor upon a tree, then the
malefactor is accounted accursed, because he has broken the whole
Commandments: Therefore the Apostle adds, Cursed is every one that
continues not in all things which are written, and Deuteronomy. 27.26. Cursed be he
that confirms not all the words of this law to do them, that is, who has
not continued in them to do them, Heb. 8.9. Iere. 31, 33. This transgression
of the law is called the quarrel of his covenant, that brings on the
vengeance of God, Levit. 26.25. And I bring a sword upon you that shall avenge
the quarrel of my covenant, so Iere. 50.28.

We are naturally accursed for breaking of all the Co^mandme^ts, and Christ by
imputatio^ was really accursed for the breach of all the Commandments, so was
the malefactor typically accursed, being a type of Christ.

No malefactor was a type of Christ but he that was hanged. Secondly, none
hanged out of Judea, The malefactor typically accursed.
the form of their death made them accursed, but only the sin it self; No
Malefactor was a type of Christ, but he who was hanged in Canaan.
as when Haman's sons were hanged upon a gallows; thirdly, whatsoever form
of hanging upon a tree they used in Judea, it made them accursed, whether they
were hanged upon one tree, as Saul's sons were; or upon a cross tree, which
form the Romans brought in amongst them, No death made a man accursed, but
hanging on a tree. (...) Crux, patihulam a (...) erigere crucifigere Why the
thief was not to hang all night.
the Jews called Zekephah, and the Greeks called (...) lignum geminum.
Fourthly; they might not suffer them to hang all night upon the tree because it
defiled the land; the Chaldee Paraphrast gives this to be the reason, why they
should not be suffered to hang all night upon the tree, because man was made to
the Image of God, and as it is a dishonor for a Prince to see his Image
misregarded; so the Lord would not have man to hang, all night upon a tree,
because he was made to his Image; but the text gives this reason that he
should not hang all night, lest he defile the Land, Deuteronomy. 21.22. And Josh.
10.26. it was not for the honor of the party hanged, that he was cut down
before night, but that the Land might not be defiled, and in detestation of
this death, The tree buried with the Malefactor.
they took the tree upon which the malefactor was hanged, and buried it with
him; and the Jews add that they did not hang him upon a growing tree, lest
they should have spared the growing tree, and not cut it down, and buried it
with the malefactor.

David caused the young men to kill Rechab, and Benah who killed Ishboseth, and
to hang up their arms and legs over the poole in Hebron, 2 Samuel 4.12. seeing
the malefactor was to be cut down before the sun set?

Why David set up the legs and arms of Benah and Rechab.
The bodies of the malefactors might not hang all night, but they were to be
taken down and buried before the Sun set; but the legs and hands of those
malefactors were set up there, to teach others to abstain from cruel murder.

Fifthly, they were accursed who hung upon a tree rather than upon any other
thing, because Adam sinned eating the fruit of the forbidden tree.

Lastly, observe that no form of man's death, All sorts of deaths now are alike.
now makes him accursed, for all sorts of death now are alike, providing that
he die penitently; it is the dying in sin only that makes a man accursed
now, it is not the form of the death that makes a man accursed.

There were three things which did accompany him, who was hanged upon a tree,
first shame, secondly pain, and thirdly a curse.

First, The death of the Cross an ignominious death.
it was a most ignominious and a shameful death, Number. 25.4. Take the Princes
and hang them up before the Sun, that is, publicly; the Seventy translate it,
paradigmatize them, and make open spectacles of shame, and Suidas says, when
any dyed an unfortunate death, they put a cross upon his grave, and Pliny
reports, that the Romans set up certain Crosses where upon they did hang
those dogs which gave no warning when the Gauls did scale the capitol; they
counted this sort of death, a dogs death, therefore Seneca called it stipem
infamem, and others called it lignum infoelix, and because it was such an
infamous kind of death, therefore the Christian Emperous changed, Crucem in
furcam, in honor of Christ; because he was hanged upon the Cross they would
have it no more used; and Cicero said, it was an heinous thing to bind a
Citizen of Rome, a villainy to scourge him; and in a manner parricide to kill
him; what shall it be then to hang him upon a cross?

This death of the cross was a most painful death, Psalm. 22.14. All my bones
are out of joint, (...) disparant s omnia ossa mea (...) separavit disiunxit.
in the Hebrew it is Hithpardu are sundred, this was but the outside of the
pain; but if we shall consider what was the pain and grief upon his soul,
then we may say, was there ever grief like unto his grief, Lament. 1.12.

Lastly, the death of the Cross was a most cursed death; When the Jews object
to us, as the greatest opprobry, that we worship Christ crucified who dyed such
a cursed death; we should rejoice in this, and count it our greatest
happiness, that he was made a curse for us hanging upon a tree, for his
lifting up upon the Cross draws many to him. Ioh. 3.14. And Bernard said
well, Non pigeat videre serpentem pendentem in lign^, si vis videre regem in
solio residentem; let us observe how the thief believed in Christ when he was
hanging upon the Cross, if Esaias believed he saw the Lord sitting upon a
throne, Esaias. 6.1. If Moses believed he saw the Lord in a flame, Exodus 3.2. If
the three Disciples believed they saw him betwixt Moses and Elias, and his face
shined, Matthew. 17. but the thief saw him hanging upon a tree, and betwixt two
thieves, and not betwixt two Prophets, he saw him not sitting upon his throne,
but hanging upon the Cross, and yet he believed in him.

The conclusion of this is, blessed is he that hears the Word of God, and
does it. Luc. 11, 20.

EXERCITAT. XXXIIII. Of the Jews Logical helps for the understanding of the
ceremonial Law.
FRom the excellency of the cause, they gathered the excellency of the effect;
(...)
Bezaleel and Aholiab were extraordinarily gifted to work all manner of work
in the Tabernacle, Exodus 31.2. and the women who spunne the Curtains of the
Tabernacle were wise hearted women, Exodus 35.25. Therefore the Tabernacle was a
most excellent work. (...) causa prima. (...) causa causarum. The material
cause of the Temple.
So the curious Artificers of Tyrus wrought in the Temple, therefore it was an
excellent work, God himself was, Hael hisibba harishona, or Sibboth
hasibboth, causa causarum.

The material cause of the holiest of all was gold, the Holy place, the
Vessels of it Gold and Silver; and in the outer Court, the instruments serving
for it were of Brass, there were none of the instruments which served in the
Tabernacle made of iron; the material cause of the most of the Temple was of
the Cedar of Libanus, and therefore the Temple is called Lebanon, (...) causa
materiali^.
Zach. 11.1. And this they called Sibbah Homerith.

The formal cause of the Tabernacle was that which the Lord showed to Moses in
the mount, (...) Causa formalis, (...) Causa finalis. (...) ab effectis.
so that of the Temple which was shown to David, and this they called Sibbah
Tzurith.

The final cause was, that the Lord might be worshipped there, and this they
called Sibbah Tachlith.

From the effects, this they called Mesubbabh; nothing that fermented might be
in a sacrifice, therefore honey is forbidden in a sacrifice, because it
fermenteth, Exam. 2. that which was unclean defiled, so that which came of an
unclean thing defiled; therefore they gathered, that there could be no silk
in the Tabernacle, because it came of an unclean worm, Byssus was that fine
linen of Egypt, and not that which we call silk, and Xylinum was the wool
of the tree which we call Cotton, and not silk! So they say the Elephants
tooth or Ivory, none of it was in the Tabernacle, because the Elephant was an
unclean beast; yet Solomon's throne was made of it.

Subjectum [Nosheh] they say that Canaan was more holy than other lands; (...)
Subjectum
therefore they who dyed out of Canaan, dyed in a polluted land, Amos 7.17.
Again, in Canaan towns were more holy than the rest of the land; for they put
the Lepers out of their Cities, and they buried not their dead in them. Then
Jerusalem was more holy than the walled towns, for they eat the light holy
things there, and the second tithe within the walls of it; then the chel or
rampire was holier than that, for no Heathen, or he that was defiled by the
dead, might enter within that. Then the women's Court holier than that, for none
that was washed from their uncleanness, might come there before the Sun set,
Levit. 15.6. The Court of men holier than that, for none that brought his
offering for atonement, though otherwise he was not clean, might come there,
Levit. 12.6, 7. and 14.9, 10. The Priests Court was holier than that, for no
Israelite might come there save in the time of their necessities, for imposing
of hands or for atonement: betwixt the Porch and the Altar was holier than
that, for none that were blemished, or bareheaded, might come there. The Temple
holier than betwixt the Porch and the Altar, none came there but he that had
his hands and his feet washen. And the Holiest of all was more holy than that,
for none might enter in there, except the High Priest once in the year.

(...) Adiunctum.
Adjunctum, [Nashu] Example, Levit. 13. verse 55. the leprosy amongst the
Jews was known by the color of the scab, if it was black, then it was dry,
and he was whole; if it was alba-subrufa, white, reddish, he was to be shut up
for seven days. If it was [adamdam] subrufa, more tending to red, than he was
shut up other seven days; and when it was rufa, very red, then he was shut out
of the Camp; and the Doctors of the Jews express these diverse colors of the
leprosy after this manner; If we shall take a cup of milk, and put four
drops of blood in it, then it shall be album subrufum, (...) subrufum.
somewhat reddish, that is, inclining more to white than red; if we shall put
eight drops of blood in it, it shall be subrufum, inclining more to red than
white, but if we shall put sixteen into it, than it shall be rufum, altogether
red. Example 2. Ab adjunctis, Concha, the Laver in the Tabernacle, was vnctum,
sed non sanctum, it was anointed, but it was not called holy. The Tabernacle
was vnctum and sanctum, sed non sanctificans, it was both anointed and holy,
but it sanctified not other things. But the Altar was vnctum, sanctum, and
sanctificans, it was both anointed, holy, and sanctified other things that
came upon it.

Decisio a pari, (...) Argumentum vel Decia pari.
[Gezarah shavah] the Altar was a place of refuge in the Temple; therefore it
was the place of refuge in the Wilderness. Exodus 21.14. Example 2. no Mamzer
might enter into the Congregation of the Lord; therefore Hybris, that which was
begotten of a Goat and an Ewe might not be offered to God in a sacrifice.
Example 3, Take off thy shoes, for the place where thou stand is holy,
Exodus 3.5. Therefore the Priests behoved to stand barefooted before the Lord.

A simili, [Cajotza] as he who washes his hands, (...) a simili.
and keeps an unclean thing still in his hand, is still unclean; so he who
confesses his sins and keeps one, is still unclean. Example 2, as the
body without the soul, is dead, so is the sacrifice that is offered without
devotion.

Decisio a gravi ad leve, [Gezarah hhomer vemikkal, (...) decisio a gravi ad
leve.
] from the more to the less. Example, if the horns of the Altar did not
shelter the Highpriest who had killed a man willingly, far less did it
protect any other man. Example 2. Levit. 4.12. if the ashes of the red Cow that
was burnt, was to be carried forth into a clean place, much more should the
Cow be burnt and carried into a clean place.

(...) Decisio a levi ad deficile.
Decisio a levi ad difficile, [Gezarah mikkal vehhomer] from the less to the
more. Example, if no blemish might be in the sacrifice, far less in the
Priest. Example, if the Badger skin, which was the outward covering of the
Tabernacle, behoved to be of a clean beast, much more the inner Curtains.
Exam. 3. If the Priests daughter was to be burnt for whooredome, much more the
Priests son: if an inferior Priests son for fornication, much more the
sons of Eli, for adultery; if she for lying with a man at home, much more
they for lying with women in the Temple.

(...) diversum contrarium. (...) Egrediens for as Scortum Meretrix vaga.
A contrarijs [Hephech] stolen waters are sweet, Pro. 9.17. therefore they
gave her who was supected of adultery, bitter waters to drink, Exam. 2.
Habitatio domus dividit spolia, that is, the good Woman who keeps herself at
home; therefore, Niphkath bara, egredien iforas, the Chaldee calls a whore.

(...) A signo ad signatum, vel dictio relativa
A signo ad signatum [Millah Mitzarepheth] Exam. No sort of fowls were offered
by them to the Lord, but Turtle Doves, and young pigeons; the Turtle Dove had
but one mate, and the young pigeon had none, therefore God will have of his
Church her first love, and only love, Exam. 2. Leprosy was a filthy disease
amongst them, and the Lepers were secluded out of the Camp, signifying that
vile sinners should be secluded out of the Church, and they say, that some of
Ioabs posterity for the shedding of blood were stricken with Leprosy, so Vzzia
for his sacrilege stricken with Leprosy. Gehezi for Simony stricken with
Leprosy, Miriam for railing stricken with Leprosy. Exam. 3. Levit. 11.2.3.26.
Whatsoever divides the hoof, and is cloven footed, and cheweth the Cud that
ye may eat; there are three properties set down here to know a clean beast,
First, to divide the hoof. Secondly, to divide the hoof in more, this is
called findere fissuram vngularum, the dog divides the hoof, but divides it
not in two. (...) est dividere in duas parts. (...) est dividere in plures
parts.
Deuteronomy. 14.6. he divides not prefectly, because he divides not in two, Levit.
11.26. Sheshang should be translated in two parts, and Parash is simply to
divide.

EXERCITAT. XXXV. How to understand the signification of the ceremonies of
Moses Law.
THe signification of the ceremonies in general was to distinguish the clean
from the unclean, the Jews from the Gentiles; this application God himself
makes, when he let down the sheet to Peter, Act. 10.

In applying of the ceremonies, we may make an application of the^ in general,
but we cannot make a particular application of every one of them. Example, the
round footed beasts represent the estate of the perfect in glory. They that
part the hoof in two, signify the middle estate of the Church, which is a
midst betwixt the Triumphant Church, and the world; and those who part the
hoof in many partitions, do signify the world; The fault of the Jews in
applying the ceremonies.
but here we must not make a particular application of every one of these; this
was the fault of the Jews, they say, the Camel signified the Babylonian
Empire; the Coney signified the Grecian Empire, the Hare the Medes, and the
Hog the Edomites, or the Romans, as they call them; this was also the fault
of some of the ancient, who studied to make a particular application of every
one of these ceremonies. Example, ye shall eat fish with sins, but not
Eeles; ye shall eat fish with sins, their sins signified faith and hope,
the Eele having no sins signified worldlings, who are always grubbling in
the earth; but in those we rest must in the general signification.

Ceremonies of the Old Testament, are applied by the Apostles in the New
Testament diversely, Ceremonies in the old Testament are applied in the New
three ways
either allegorically, tropologically, or anagogically; they are applied
allegorically, when the thing spoken of in the old Testament, signifies
something in the new Testament; they are applied tropologically; when they are
applied to signify our manners, and when they infer some moral duty; and
they are applied anagogically, when the thing below here, signifies the estate
and condition of the life to come.

No allegorical application to be made from the Old Testament to the new, but
where the Spirit of God has made it.
We are not to make an all^goricall application of any thing in the old
Testament to the Church in the new, but where the holy Ghost has made it,
Example, Galat. 4.25. Hagar, and Sara in the old Testament are applied
allegorically to the new coveant, and they are said, (...), or as the Syriacke
has it, to be at peace together, or agree together: Hagar, her son Ismael,
and the Law, and Jerusalem below here, and her children are all (...). Sara
again, the freewoman, her son Isaac, the new covenant, Jerusalem which is
from above and her children are (...), but they are (...), to Hagar and her
children.

Psalm. 40.6. Mine ear have thou boared, but Heb. 10.5. A body have thou
prepared for me; it is commonly holden, that this is an allegorical
application applied to Christ, taken from the boaring of the servants ear
under the Law; but if it had been an allusion to that form under the Law, why
would the Apostle then who was most skillful in application of the ceremonies
set it down thus; thou have prepared a body for me. And David says, Psalm.
40.6. Thou have boared mine ears, Whereas the right ear of the servant was
only boared.

EXERCITAT. XXXVI. Of the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law.
THE Leviticall ceremonies are considered three ways; first, with CHRIST;
Secondly, The ceremonies considered three ways.
without Christ; and thirdly, against Christ; In the first estate they were
weak Elements and could bring nothing to perfection, Heb. 10, 1. And therefore
they were to be abolished, and the Gospel was to come in the place of them.
Heb. 7.19. The Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope
did, by the which we draw near to God.

First, Lex rogatur, the Law is given. Secondly, Subrogatur, when somethings
are added to the first Law. Lex rogatur. subrogatur. obrogatur. derogatur.
abrogatur.

Thirdly, Obrogatur, when something is changed in the first Law. Fourthly,
derogatur when something is taken from it. Fifty, Abrogatur, when it is
altogether abolished and taken away.

When the ceremonial Law was given, The ceremonial law was was not changed in
part, but altogether abolished.
there was nothing subrogate or put to it, neither was it obrogated, changed in
part, neither was it derogated, any thing taken from it, but fully abrogated,
and therefore the Apostle says, (...), Superinducta est spes melior, the new
covenant was not brought in upon the old, that they might be both joined in
one, but the old was first abrogated, and the new brought in, in the place of
it.

Again, the Apostle says, Gods chief delight was not in sacrifices under the
Law.
A body have thou prepared for me, as if he would say thou have made choice of
no sacrifices, thou would not have them, for thou tookest no delight in them,
thy delight was in the most excellent thing and not in the basest, 1 Samuel
15.22. Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and in sacrifices as
in obeying? behold to obey is better then sacrifice.

A threefold use of the ceremonies under the Law.
These ceremonies had three special uses when they were in force, first to
help the Jews infancy, but the Church under Christ coming to man's age, these
ceremonies have no use now, many things become a child which are unseemely in a
man.

Secondly, these ceremonies served for signification: when we have the fruit,
there is no use of the blossom; so when Christ is come, there is no use of the
ceremonies.

Thirdly, these ceremonies served to make a partition wall betwixt the Jews
and the Gentiles, but this partition wall is now broken down, and there is one
shepherd and one sheepfold, Ioh. 10.16. and therefore this use cease now.

Three errors concercerning Christ.
Secondly, the ceremonies are considered without Christ, when the Apostles did
bear with the weak Jews for a while. And in this estate they were beggarly
elements. Coloss. 2.20. Scotus observes the periode of circumcision, the first
period was from the institution of it until the time that Christ was baptized;
then it was Necessaria et utilis: the second period was from the Baptism of
Christ, until the promulgation of the Gospel, Go teach all Nations,
Baptizing them; Matthew. 28.19. In this period it was Vtilis sed non necessaria,
Profitable but not necessary: the third period from the promulgation of the
Gospel until the destruction of the Temple; it was Licita in this period, Sed
non vtilis: The fourth period was from the destruction of the Temple, or rather
from the Council of the Apostles, even unto this time, then it was altogether
Illicita.

In this estate when the ceremonies were Licita sed non vtilis, they did bear
with the weak Jews at Jerusalem, but not at Antioch, who would have added the
ceremonies to the Gospel. Paul circumcised Timothy, Act. 16.3. bearing with
the weak Jews, but he would no ways bear with the malicious Jews;
therefore he would not Circumcise Titus, lest he should strengthen them in
their obstinacy, Galath. 2.3.

The ceremonies being dead, and Christ come; Cornelius Prayers and alms be
acceptable to God, seeing he waited for Christ to come?

Error temporis. condetionis. persona.

the first was error temporis, the second was error conditionis, and the third
was error personae.

Error temporis, was twofold, either of simple ignorance, or of affected
ignorance; simple ignorance as that of Cornelius, and for this cause Peter was
sent to teach him that Christ was come, and therefore his error was pardonable:
affected ignorance is that ignorance of the Jews who will not know nor believe
that Christ is come, although the truth be evidently demonstrated unto them.

Error conditionis, was that in the Apostles, who took Christ's Kingdom to be
a Worldly Kingdom at the first, Act. 1.6. When will thou restore the Kingdom
to Israel? This error was a dangerous error, but yet was pardoned because as
yet the holy Ghost was not come down upon them: the third was error personae,
and this was when they took false christ's for the true Christ, Matthew. 24.24.
And this error was always damnable.



cursed is he that hangs upon a tree, Whether Laws mixtly ceremonial do
bind.
the ceremonial part is, that he is accursed that hangs upon a tree, we
must not think that he is accursed now who hangs upon a tree, therefore
that law is quite abolished; the Judicial part is this, that he shall not hang
all night upon the tree, and this law binds not Christians now, because it is
an appendix of this ceremonial Law; but where the ground of the Law is
Judicial, and the ceremony but an appendix of it, then the Judicial law may
be observed, at least the equity of it. Example, Cities of refuge were
appointed as a Judicial Law, to save the mankiller from the revenger of the
blood; there was a ceremony annexed to this Law, that they should stay within
the City of refuge until the death of the Highpriest, this was but an appendix
of the judicial Law, therefore the Law may stand, that Cities of refuge be
kept, or at least the equity of it, that those who casually kill, be not slain.



Materialis, formalis, and mixtus vsus, a material, a formal, and a mixed use.

A threefold use of the ceremonial Law.
Materialis, as if a man should abstain from eating of swines flesh only,
because it were unwholesome, he Iudaizeth not in this case; but if he should
abstain from swines flesh as a meat unclean, and forbidden in the Law, then
he should formally keep the ceremony, and truly Iudaize; the mixed use is
this, when a Christian borrows Jewish ceremonies to any use in the Christian
Church.

Mark how the Apostles in their practice renounced the ceremonies of the Law;
first the Apostles kept the Christian Sabbath after Christ's Resurrection, and
not the Jewish Sabbath, therefore they renounced the ceremonies; and the
Apostle wills the Corinthians to keep the Passover all the days of their
life, in holiness, and restrained it not to some few days, as the Jews
Passover was.

Act. 2.1.2 Cor. 16. Here Paul reckons according to the Jewish Pentecost.

Act. 27.9. (the Jews at the day of expiation had a great fast) Paul does not
Iudaize here, but only marketh these for a civil use, to know the time of the
year which was most known to the Jews, when Paul, Act. 17.19. calls
Areopagus Mars street, none will think that Paul worshipped Mars here, but he
uses only this name as a name of distinction to know this street from other
streets; so when he says that he sailed in a ship that had the badge of Castor
and Pollux, Act. 28.11. we must not think he worshipped Castor and Pollux, but
he uses them only as names of distinction, to put a difference betwixt this
ship and other ships; Paul used the names of the Jews feasts for distinction.
so when Paul uses the name of the Pentecost, and the name of the fast, Act.
2. and 27.9. he used them only as names for distinctions sake, and not for any
Jewish observation, and when Paul practiced any of these ceremonies, he
practiced them not for the ceremonies themselves, but for the weak Jews sake.
Example, When he did shave his head in Cenchrea the Port town in Corinth. Act.
18.18. this was not according to the Law altogether, Paul did not shave his
head according to the law.
for if he had done it according to the Law, he should have gone to Jerusalem
and there have cast the hair of his Nazarits vow under the Altar and burnt it;
after the death of Christ, none of the Apostles ever went to the brazen Altar
again to sacrifice, but only they practiced some of the meaner ceremonies
bearing with the weak Jews.



Ioh. 16.7. If I go not away, the Comforter shall not come, Christ's bodily
presence amongst the Apostles hindered his spiritual presence amongst them; if
the bodily presence of Christ hindered the coming of the Spirit unto them, how
much more did these ceremonies under the Law hinder the sight of his
Incarnation, and obscure his glory amongst them.

The ceremonies in the third estate are against Christ.
In the third estate these ceremonies were against Christ, in this estate the
Apostle calls it, concision, and not circumcision, Phil. 3.2. In the third
estate the Jews preferred the shadow to the body, The error of the Jews in
preferring the Ceremonies to Christ.
the bones to the marrow, and the letter to the spirit; they prefer the
shadow to the body, the ceremonies to Christ, the bones to the marrow, because
they content themselves only with the outward figures, and types, and seek
not for the thing signified, and so they have the killing letter, but not the
quickening spirit: and therefore Saint Hierome compares them well now to dogs
who get only the bones to gnaw, but they get none of the marrow, or that
hidden Manna, Jesus Christ to their salvation.

Egypt were changed into letters, and the dark and mystical writings of Plato
were changed by Aristotle, into a clear and plain form of writing: It is a
far greater benefit, when the Lord has changed these dark figures and
shadows, into the clear light of the Gospel.

How to make use of the Ceremonies of the Law in opening of a Text, and
reducing them to practice. Of the Notes whereby Aaron and his posterity were
discerned to be called to the Priesthood.
Number. 17.2. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, speak unto the Children of
Israel, and take every one of them a rod, etc.
WHen Corah and his accomplices murmured against Aaron, and contended with him
for the Priesthood, (as we may see in the Chapter preceding,) the Lord
commanded every one of the first borne of the tribes to bring a rod to him,
that by this new miracle (causing Aarons rod to blossom) he might end this
controversy, and confirm Aaron the more in the Priesthood.

The Prince of the tribe represented the whole tribe.
Secondly, he commanded that the names of the Princes of the tribes should be
written upon the rods, and the reason, was because the Prince represented the
whole tribe; so the Prince being repelled from the Priesthood, the whole tribe
was repelled.

Write thou every man's name upon his rod. Aaron had not written upon his rod
the Tribe of Levi, but the name of Aaron, and so the rest of the Princes.
Another reason wherefore the names were written upon the rods of the Princes,
was because the Princes of the tribes were their first borne, and therefore
they might seem to claim right to the Priesthood: every man's name was written
upon his rod, and Aarons name was written upon his rod, because he was the
first borne of Levi, for the first borne of Levi was Cohath, and he begot
Amram, and Amram begot Aaron, who was elder than his brother Moses.



How the tribes are reckoned in the Scripture.
When a matter is in hand which concerns the whole people, then Levi is
reckoned amongst the rest, as in the matter of blessing and cursing, Deuteronomy. 27.
So in setting up the twelve stones at Jordan; and upon Aarons breastplate, so
here when the question is to which of the Tribes the Priesthood belonged; but
when the matter is concerning civil things, then Levi is excluded as in the
division of the land, and then the tribe of Joseph is divided into two Ephraim,
and Manasses, and so there are twelve Tribes.

Every Tribe must lay their rod before the Lord, and have their name written
upon it, (...) Tribus.
and from hence it came afterward that the Tribes were called Shebhte because
they carried rods before them, and their names written in them, and therefore
Baculus is put for Tribus, Number. 1.4.16.26. Josh. 20.10.

Aaron took not his brother Moses rod which was the rod of God, Why Aaron
took not his brothers rod.
by which he wrought so many miracles, for the rest of the Tribes would have
excepted against that rod, because it was the rod of God; but it was a common
rod like the rest of the rods, that they might take no exception against it.

The rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded.

God thinks not every man fit for this holy calling, he makes choice here of
Aarons rod amongst all the rest, and makes it to bud; God thinks not every
man fit for the Calling of the Ministry.
No man takes this honor unto himself, but he that is called, as was Aaron.
Heb. 5.4. First, no man takes this honor, that is, ought to take it; What it
is to take this calling.
Secondly, take it, that is, usurpeth it at his own hand, as he that takes
the sword shall dye with the sword, Matthew. 26.55. That is, he that takes it
having no calling. So thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vain, Exodus 20.7. that is, usurp it, having no calling to take it up.
Thirdly, this honor, the Priesthood was an honorable calling, and therefore
every base fellow should not usurp it; any was fit enough, yea the basest of
the people, if he could but conserate a ram, to be a Priest sufficient for
Jeroboam, 1 King. 12.31. but the Lord would have none to take upon him this
honorable calling, but those whom he separated for it, and were called as was
Aaron; if any man might challenge this prerogative, might not the King? but see
what Vzzia got for attempting this, 2 Chro. 26.19. and Saul for sacrificing
before Samuel came, thou that can not show that the Lord has made thy rod to
bud, meddle not with this calling, for then some mark of Gods wrath may light
upon thee.

The rod of Aaron was budded.
This miracle was not so much to confirm Aaron, as to convince his
gainstanders; the Lord says, The chief end of this miracle was to convince
the enemies of Aaron.
Bring Aarons Rod back again to be kept for a token against the Rebels; As
the Rod was kept for a testimony against the rebels, so it budded for a
testimony against them the Apostle, 1 Cor. 14.22. says of tongues, that they
are for signs, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not; so are
miracles for the most part ordained for those that are unbeleevers, Miracles
do not beget faith, but confirm it.
or for those who had a small measure of faith in the beginning of the Gospel
see what sort have been most desirous of miracles, those who had no faith;
first, the Devil, he cried for a miracle, that stones might be turned into
bread, Matthew. 4.3. Secondly, the rich glutton in hell, he would have one sent
from the dead to tell his brethren, Luc. 16.30. Moses and the Prophets would
not serve the turn; so the misbeleeving Nazarits would have had a sign from
Christ, What sort of people desired miracles.
and the Jews would have seen miracles, Mat. 12.39. And Herod hoped to have
seen some miracle of Christ, Luc. 23.8. All these, because they had not faith,
cried for miracles; When Paul healed the father of Publius the Consul of a
fever, he healed him by a miracle, and made him presently to arise, Act. 28.8,
but he healed not Timothy that way, but seemed rather to play the Physician to
him, bidding him drink no longer water, but wine; 1 Timothy 5.23. What was the
reason of this? Timothy believed, therefore he needed not a miracle, but the
father of Publius believed not, he was an infidel as yet, therefore a miracle
was more necessary for him; many men cry for miracles, but that argues
infidelity in them; but if thou did believe, thou neededst none of these,
they serve but for infidels, but they serve nothing to beget faith; the thief
said, if thou will come down from the Cross, and save thy self and us, then
I will believe in thee, Luc. 23.39. But if the death of Christ will not work
faith in the, if thou should see miracles both in heaven and earth, they will
never convert thee.



Why God confirms not men's calling by miracles. Simile.
at the first when the Law, and the Gospel were planted, they were confirmed
by miracles, but when they once took root, he withdrew these miracles. A
gardner when he transpla^teth a tree out of one ground to another, before the
tree take root, he sets stays to it, he pours water at the root of it
daily; but when it once takes root, he cease to water it, and pulls away
the stays that he set to uphold it, and suffers it to grow with the ordinary
influence of the heavens; so a Chirurgian when a leg is broken, he binds it
up; but after the bones be fastened, he takes away these helps from it; so the
Lord in planting of Religon, he put to these helps of miracles as stays to
uphold it, but when it is once confirmed and fastened, he takes away these
helps.

Aarons rod did bud.

Thom. contra gentiles.
Secondly, miracles in the second degree; and thirdly, miracles in the lowest
degree.

Miracles in the highest degree they make to be these, Three sorts of miracles.
wherein nature never had a hand, as for the sun to go back and stand still:
Miracles in the second degree, they make to be these, when nature had once an
hand in them, but when they are once decayed nature can never restore them
again; nature brings forth a man seeing, but when he is once blind, nature
can never make him to see again; but when he is restored to his sight again,
this is a miracle in the second degree: A miracle in the third degree, they
make to be this; when nature in time could do such a thing, but nature upon a
sudden cannot do this, and when it is done upon a sudden, it is a miracle in
the third degree; they give the example of this in Peter's mother in law, when
Christ upon a sudden cured her of a Fever, nature in time might have cured
her of this Fever, but because she was cured of this Fever upon a sudden, it
was a miracle in the third degree. Now what sort of miracle was this, when this
Almond rod budded, and brought forth upon a sudden, it was a miracle in the
second degree, for an Almond tree will bring forth Almonds by nature, but
being once cut up, it cannot bring forth Almonds again, then it was a miracle
in the second degree, for nature could never have made this rod to bring forth
Almonds.

Why Corah and Dathan contended for the Priesthood.
Dathan and Abiram contended for the Priesthood, because they were of the
posterity of Ruben the eldest brother, and Corah thought that it belonged to
him, because he was the eldest son of Levi, as Adonijah contended with
Solomon for the kingdom, because he was the eldest son of David, Dathan and
Abiram contended for the Priesthood, because they came of Reuben.

Lineall succession not always the Lawful successinn.
Learn then that lineall succession is not always the lawful succession;
these were lineally descended of Ruben, yet this lineall succession failed, for
Ruben lost his dignity by incest, the Church of Rome now has a lineall
succession from the ancient Roman Church, but by their spiritual whoredoms
and adulteries, Scarabeus, or the dunghill fly, bragged upon a time that he
was more excellent than the Be, because he was descended of the horse; but how
was he descended of the horse? he was only bred of the dung of the horse: so
the Church of Rome that now is, is but come of the excrements of the old Roman
Church and optimi vint pessimum acetum; when the contention was betwixt Solomon
and Adonijah about the kingdom of Israel; Adonijah had standing for him
Abiathar the Priest; and Solomon had standing for him, Zadok the Priest, both
of them were Priests, and both of them had the holy oil, but who had the
right, whether he that was anointed by Zadok, or he that was anointed by
Abiathar? he that was anointed by Zadok had the right, because he had Nathan
the Prophet upon his side. No succession is the right succession, although they
have both Priest and the holy oil, if they have not Nathan upon their side;
Solomon had the right succession, because he had it by Nathan. And so Aaron
here had the Lord upon his side, and therefore the Priesthood belonged to him.

He chused the Almond rod, because it flourished first; Ministers should be
trained up frnm their youth.
The Lord likes these to be his Ministers, who begin to blossom from their
youth, this was excellently typed in Jeremiah, cap. 1. What see thou
Jeremiah? I see an Almond rod; This figured Ieremiahs calling, as the Almond
rod blossomed first, so Jeremiah was called from his infancy; and as the Almond
tree flourished first, so the Lord was to bring his judgments quickly upon
that people which he pronounced by Jeremiah. So he chose Samuel from his
infancy, and John the Baptist from a child, and so Timothy and Athanasius: he
likes not these autumnales arbores, as Jude calls them, verse. 12. which
begun not to blossom till the latter end of Harvest, and then to enter to
the Ministry; happy are they who can say with the Church, omnes fructus
servavi tibi, Cant. 7.13. I have reserved all my fruits to thee, of my infancy
and middle age, and old age, and have dedicated my self still for this
calling, it is a pity to see those that have bin deboshed and dissolute men,
to be thrust into this holy calling, a casheerd soldier, a bankrupt Merchant,
or a fallen Courtier.

When the Lord caused the unclean spirit to pass out of the land, Zach. 13.
then those who had no calling to be Prophets, were ashamed of their vision, and
of their rough gown which they wore to deceive the people (because the
Prophets of God wore a hairy Gown) they confess then that they were not
Prophets, The false Prophets were ashamed of their vision.
but they were husbandmen, and taught to keep Cattle from their youth; it
were to be wished, that those who have not a calling to this holy function,
would renounce it, and say, I was not taught from my youth, and trained up to
this holy calling, but to be a soldier, a Merchant, etc. and therefore I will
renounce it.

The Almond rod brought forth buds, blossoms, and ripe Almonds The blossoming
of Aarons rod was to confirm Aaron, as the Vine branches which budded and
brought forth blossoms, was to confirm the Butler in his office, Genesis 40.10.
and this was declared to Jeremiah, a Priests son, Ier. 1.11, 12. and the
continuance of the Priesthood, with those who should sprout and grow out of
him, Ezeck. 17.44 children are called buds, Job 30.12.

The Church is in a happy estate when she has qualified laborers in the Lords
Vineyard, The estate of the Church is happy when they have good men to succeed
in the Ministry.
and expectants to succeed them, when she has her ripe fruits, her blossoms,
and her buds; the buds are the young ones, who give themselves to those holy
studies; the blossoms are the young men who have made good progress in
Divinity; and the ripe Almonds are those who are actually serving in the
Church: The Jews alluding to Aarons rod, call the children of the Priests
flores sacerdotoles: it was a comfortable thing to Eli when he had young Samuel
to succeed him, and to Elijah when he had Elisha to succeed him, (...)
Reliquium revertetu^, Esaias. 7.3.
and to Esaias that had his son Shear-jashub to succeed, as a pledge to
confirm his prophecy, that the remnant of the people of God should be saved
and brought back from the captivity again. It was a great comfort to Paul
when he had young Timothy to succeed him, and to Augustine, when he had
Alippius; a father dies the more willingly, when he has a good son to
succeed him; the blossoms may rejoice when they have the buds to succeed them,
and the Almonds may rejoice when they have the blossoms to succeed them. John
says, 1 John. 2.14. I write unto you babes, I write unto you young men, and I
write unto you old men; Babes are the buds, the young men are the blossoms,
and the old men are the Almonds. Let us pray to God for the Schools and
Universities, when the old men are wearing away that good young men may succeed
them, and babes in their places: the Church is much to be pitied now, although
there be many youths to succeed, who have knowledge, yet there is little
sanctification amongst them, and therefore less hope that their ministry
shall be profitable.

And yielded Almonds. In the original it is, (...) a (...) ablactavit
[Vaijgmol] et ablactavit, it weaned them; for even as the mother weaneth her
child when he is of such an age, so did the Almond tree weane the Almonds, when
they were ripe.

The Lord likes none to enter into this holy calling until they be ripe, God
will not have Ministers to enter on their calling until they be ripe.
they should have the full grouth before they enter, these (...), or young
plants are not fit for it, young men are not fit for the ministry, Eccles.
12.1. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; why bids he the young
man remember his Creator in the days of his youth? because he is most
forgetful of this duty to remember his God; if he be not fit to remember
himself, and to recommend himself to God twice or thrice in the day, how can
he be the Lords remembrancer, to remember his people before him? Ambros. lib.
1. de offic. cap. 1. tom. 1
It was a case of necessity, when Ambrose was made Bishop of Millan, qui simul
et discebat, and docebat.

Why youths are not fit for the Ministry.
Secondly, youths are not fit for this calling, because this age is much
subject to lust, 2. Timot. 2.22. Fly the Lusts of youth, if ever Lust break
forth in a man's life time, usually it breaks forth in his youth, he that
cannot command his own Lusts, how can he teach other men to subdue theirs? 1 Timothy 3.5. if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care
of the Church of God? Paul will not have a young widow admitted to wash the
Saints feet, 1 Timothy 5.10. because they give themselves oftentimes to
wantonness and fleshly lusts, far less will he have a young man to be
admitted to this holy calling, who should wash the souls of the Saints, and
not their feet; this age likewise is much subject to contempt, 1 Timothy 4.11.
Let no man despise thy youth, and therefore not fit to enter in this calling.
The natural history marketh, that the whelps of the Lions who have the
sharpest paws, do so prick the matrix of their damme, that they are borne the
sooner, and they never get the full strength; so it fares with young men who
hasten out of the University before they get gifts, and strength, wherefore
young students are to be exhorted to stay at the University, until they get
strength; and as the Lord bad his Disciples stay at Jerusalem until the holy
Ghost came down upon them, Luc. 24.49. So should they stay at the Universities
until the Lord enable them with gifts: It is an unseemely thing to see young
ones, ante lanuginem docere senes, et hodie Catechumenus, cras Episcopus, and
how unsavory a thing is it out of the mouth of a green youth to exhort people
to fly from these lusts, whereunto they are most subject themselves; may not
the people justly say to them, Physician heal thy self, and take out the
beam, first, out of thine own eye.







Numb 4 3. they entered to their full ministry at thirty; but Number. 8.24. he
appointed them to enter at twenty and five, for the beginning of their
ministry; but they entered not to their full ministry, until they were full
thirty, and they served until they were fifty, but in Davias time they began
at twenty, 1 Chro. 23.24. The sons of Levi did the work of the service of
the house of the Lord, from the age of twenty years and upward; and 2 Chronicles.
31.17. in Hezekiahs days, and so in the days of Ezra, from twenty years old
and upward, Ezra chap. 3. verse.. 8.

Some may be ripe Almonds now when they are six and twenty, or eight and
twenty, and some scarce when they are thirty; therefore, there cannnot be a
certain time determined when they shall enter, but this is left to the trial,
and discretion of the Church; the determination of the Canon Law, who
concludes absolutely that they should be thirty before they enter, seems to
Iudaize in this. The Levites when they entered on their ministry, they were
thirty years before they entered, because their ministry was a laborious and a
painful service, and therefore required full bodily strength, and so they
gave up their ministry, when they were fifty; but the ministry now is not
such a bodily service, and therefore requires not such bodily strength now;
the soldiers when they went to war were admitted, when they were but twenty
years of age, but the Levites not until they were thirty, there is both
strength and wisdom required in the wars, as Solomon says, Prove. 24.6.
strength in the soldiers; and wisdom in the governors; but in the Levites
and Priests there was both wisdom and strength required, strength without
wisdom before they be thirty, and wisdom without strength after they are
fifty. So knowledge and sanctification are requisite in those who are to enter
on this Holy calling; knowledge without sanctification is like wine that runs
in a man's head, and makes him giddy, sanctification without knowledge turns
into blind zeal, and therefore they are to be joined together in those who are
Preachers, as strength, and wisdom was in the Priests.

The Almonds rod brought forth buds and blossoms.

The Lord taught Aaron by this, although he was weak, and old himself, yet
his posterite should not fail; he was fourscore and six years of age now,
yet to let him understand of a succession, he makes his rod to bud, and it
continued in his posterity for sixty, and three Highpriests.

The Priesthood was entailed to Levi, when they were chosen in the place of the
first borne; and again, when they killed their brethren for the worshipping of
the golden Calfe, it was promised them anew again, and when Phinehas killed
Zimri and Cozbi, the promise was renewed to him.

What needed a new promise to be made to Phinehas of the Priesthood, seeing it
was due to him by the Law,

This new promise secured him in the Priesthood, Nadab and Abihu were killed
before their father dyed, again this promise assured him that it should
continue in his famile.

But the Priesthood was soon translated from the family of Phinehas to
Ithamars posterity, Eli was of the posterity of Ithamar, and not of Phinehas,
and from Eli it came to his son Phimehas, and then to Achitub, and then to
Achiaz the brother of Ahimelech, and then it was restored to Zadoc, see 1 Chronicles. 24.3. for four generations, the posterity of Phinehas wanted the
Priesthood.

Elies posterity had it, de facto et non de jure, Eli brake his neck, his
son Phinehas was killed in the battle, Abiathar was put from the Priesthood,
and his soon Ahimelech was slain by Doeg, and all this time when they wanted
the Priesthood, the posterity of Elcazer far surpassed the posterity of
Ithamar, 1 Chronicles. 24.4. Again it was promised to Phinehas posterity
conditionally, if they should walk in their fathers ways. This promise of the
Priesthood was not made so absolutely to Phinehas, but that Phinehas posterity
for their sins might be deprived of it for a time, (even as the promise made
to David that the Kingdom should continue with his posterity for ever, did not
exclude the captivity of Babylon, and the overthrow of the kingdom for a time)
yet by virtue of this promise made to Phinehas his posterity could not want it
for ever And thirdly, it is so promised to his posterity that it should not be
taken for ever from him as it was from the posterity of Eli.

This rod brought forth Almonds without a root: the fathers reason out of this
place against the Jews who will not believe that the Virgin could bear a
son; why will ye believe this (say they) that Aarons rod brought forth
Almonds without a root, and cannot believe that a Virgin can bear a son? ye
believe that Eva was created out of the side of Adam, and that Adam was created
out of the dust, why may ye not believe this likewise, that God can create a
child in the Womb of the Virgin? Ye believe that Sara an old withered stock,
conceived by the power of God, and why ye will not believe this, that God by
his power created the Child in the Womb of the Virgin?

The tree blossomed, although it was withered.

Hence we may gather that the withered tree, the Church of the Jews, shall
flourish again: a man looking with a natural eye upon that heap of dry
bones, Ezekiel. 37. would never think that they should rise again, but the Lord
by the mighty wind of his Spirit, gathered these bones together, and made them
to live; so the Lord by his mighty power, shall make the withered tree of the
Jews to flourish again.

Never fruit grow upon thee henceforth, Mat. 21.19. Then it may seem, that
this tree shall never flourish again.



Almonds, when it was laid up before the Lord, or not?

No question it did, it up as a testimony against the rebels, now when it kept
the buds blossoms, and Almonds, it testified the more vively against them, and
as the Manna lasted so many hundredth years in the golden pot, so did this rod
keep the blossoms and Almonds.

When Aarons rod budded, it was a token to him that he was called of the Lord;
he that runs, and is not sent by the Lord, shall never do good in that holy
Calling: these Agrippa who were borne with their feet foremost, it was a bad
token of their evil government to follow, as it fell out in Herod Agrippa, who
was a very bad Governor: so when a Preacher is not sent by God to his people,
and the Lord does not make his rod to bud, he shall never be a profitable
Minister in his Calling.

Of the privileges of the first borne under the Law, and what he was bound to
do to his brethren and kinsmen.
Matthew. 22.24. If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his
wife, and raise up seed unto him.
AFter that the Pharisees had tempted Christ, the same day the Sadduces came to
tempt him, who denied the Resurrection, and they reason with Christ ab absurdo,
if there were a Resurrection, then this absurdity would follow, that seven men
should have one wife at the Resurrection, but this is absurd; therefore, etc.
and thus they go about to ground upon Moses Law; For Moses commanded in the
Law, that if a man dye without seed, then his brother should raise up his seed
unto him, Deuteronomy. 35.5. Now there fell out a case among us, that a man married a
wife and dyed without children, his brother married his wife, and he dyed
without children also; and seven brethren had her to wife, Whose wife then
shall she be in the Resurrection? Our Lord answers, that they err, not
knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, for in the Resurrection men
neither marry, nor give in marriage, but are like the Angels of God.

The Sadduces who denied the Resurrection, put this question to Christ.

He that denies the immortality of the soul, cannot hold one sound point in
Religion, the Sadduces denied the immortality of the soul, they held the soul
to be like Quickesilver which made the body to stir, or like Salt that kept
the body from corruption, as Epicurus held, and the best that they made of it,
they said it was an exact temperature of the humors of the body; and then for
the Angels, they said they were but good thoughts, but not subsisting spirits.
Now if the soul be not an immortal substance, the body cannot be joined to it
again, for the weal of the body depends upon the souls immortality, they
held the soul to be mortal, and therefore of necessity they behoved to deny
the resurrection. Tertullian called the Marcionites and Valentinians, qui
credebant reditum animae non corporis, partiarios Saducaeos.

We who profess our selves to be Christians, say the Creed, and repeat this
Article often, I believe the resurruction of the body, but yet if we will look
to the lives of most part of men, we shall hear than say no other thing, but
that which the Sadduces and Epicures said, 1 Cor. 15.32. Let us eat, let us
drink, for to morrow we shall dye, that is, be quite extinguished in soul and
body, as if there were no more of us after our death, tha^ beasts when they are
knocked on the head; when the Pharisees reasoned with the Sadduces, they said
unto the^, Why study ye to keep the Law, seeing ye believe not the immortality
of the soul? they answered, That it might be well with them in this life: we
profess the immortality of the soul, why study we not then to keep the Law,
that it may go well with us in the time to come? Augustine said, if he were
persuaded that the soul were mortal, then of all religions he would choose to
be the Epicure or Sadduce; but seeing the soul is an immortal substance; Let
us detest these bruit beasts who imagine that death is the end both of soul
and body; the soul lives for ever, then the body must live for ever either in
weal or woe; Let us study therefore to feed the soul with that immortal food
of the Word of God, and not say with the rich man in the Gospel, Luc. 12.19.
Soul, thou have enough, if we would have that happy conjunction betwixt the
soul, and the body again.

Moses said, if a man dye having no children.

Moses could command such a thing; for incest is condemned in the moral law,
and forbidden in the seventh Commandment.

Morale positivum, divinu^ positivum.
Moral positive laws are such as the very light of nature commands. Divine
positive are those which are accessory commandments added to the first.
Example, this is a moral positive law, that a man should not lie with his
mother, nor with his mother in law, for this is a fornication, that is not
named amongst the Gentiles. 1 Cor. 5.1. And it was for this sort of incest that
the Canaanites were cast out of Canaan. So this is primarium jus naturae, or
morale positivum, that a man should not lie with his daughter, nor his
daughters daughter, descendendo descending downward: but this again is
divinum positivum, or secundarium jus naturae, in the collateral line, that a
man should not lie with his sister or his brothers wife; No marriage in the
collateral line was forbidden at the first, by the law of nature, or moral
positive law; but it was forbidden afterward by the divine positive law,
Levit. 18.16. When Lot lay with his daughters, this was incest in the highest
degree, because it was contrary to Ius natural, the moral positive law; but
when Amram married Iochabed [Dodatho] his fathers sister, Exodus 6, 20, (...)
Amita. It should not be translated Patrue^is, cozin-german, but his fathers
sister, see Number. 26.59.
This was not against the moral positive, or natural part of the law, because
it was not in the right line, but in the collateral, although in the nearest
degree it was against the divine positive law; and that the Church might be
replenished with people, God over-saw this sort of marriage at the first, but
God does more here, he commanded the brother to raise up seed to his brother.
First, This Commandment was not against the moral positive Law.
this is not contra primarium jus naturae, because it was not in the right
line. Secondly, it is an exception from secundarium ius naturae, for when God
commanded to do this, he willed them not to do this to satisfy lust (for
that were against primarium jus naturae, the moral positive law) but only
that the elder brother might be a tipe of Jesus CHRIST, who should never want a
seed in the Church.

If he dye having no children. In the original it is, having no seed. (...)
should not be translated sons here, for daughters succeeded likewise to the
inheritance when the fathers had no sons, therefore it should be translated,
haeving no children, The women raised up seed to their parents.
which comprehends both the males and femals, the women raised up seed to
their parents as well as the males, marrying within their own tribe, therefore
that saying in the Talmud was not true, qui masculam prolem non habuit, etsi
filias habuerit plurimas, in eo genus est consummatum.

His brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to him.

What brother had this privilege? The eldest brother was bound to raise up
seed.
only he that was the eldest brother, and therefore, Deuteronomy. 25.5. If brethren
dwell together, and one of them dye, one of them, Numerus Cardinali^ pro
ordinali.
that is, the eldest of them, Genesis 1.5. and the evening, and the morning were
one day, that is, the first day, this is, cardinalis numeru^ pro ordinali, if
the third brother had raised up seed to the second brother, then it had been
incest.

He that was the first borne in Israel, What things the first borne did to the
rest.
he was bound to do three things to his brethren and kinsmen, first he was
bound to revenge his blood, their was vindex sanguinis. Secondly, he was Goel,
and redeemed the morgaged lands of his near kinsman, and thirdly, it was he
that delivered him out of prison; all these three he was bound to do to him,
jure propinquitatis, because he was his nearest kinsman.

What things due to the eldest brother.
There were three things again which were due to him; First, he had a double
portion of his fathers goods: Secondly, he had the whole inheritance; and
thirdly, if he dyed without children, his brother was to raise up seed unto him.

Christ our Goel revengeth our blood upon his enemies.
Now let us apply these to Christ; First, Christ is our Goel or vindex
sanguinis, the revenger of our blood upon that red Dragon who thristeth for the
blood of man, and upon all the enemies who thirst for the blood of his
children; the revenger of blood or Goel. Deuteronomy. 19.6. when he pursued the
killer, his heart waxed hot in the pursuit; Jesus Christ our Goel, when he
does see the blood of the Saints shed, his heart waxes hot, and he furbisheth
the sword, to make it drunk with the blood of his enemies, Iere. 51.35. The
violence done to me, to my flesh, be upon thee Babylon, shall Sion say, and my
blood be upon the Chaldeans, shall Jerusalem say; now mark what is said in the
chapter preceding, Iere. 30.50. How tears are said to offend.
Thy Goel or redeemer is strong, and I will plead thy cause. See how the
revenger of the blood makes Babylon, and Chaldea answer for all: Job says,
Cap. 17. My tears ascend before the Lord, Tears naturally descend, but as the
Sun draws up the exhalations, and they fall down again; so the wrongs that
are done to the Saints, they come up before their Goel, and then fall down
again upon the enemies heads, they shall answer for all the blood shed from
Abel to Zachary, and all this innocent blood which is shed now, the Lord will
require it at their hand.

Secondly, he redeemed the morgaged land. Ruth. 4.4. and Ier. 32.7. when
Hanameel the son of Shallum, had morgaged his field that was in Anathoth, the
right of redemption belonged to Jeremiah, as being cozen german to Hanameel. We
have morgaged the Inheritance of heaven, but Jesus Christ who is flesh of our
flesh, and bone of our bones, has redeemed it to us again.

The third thing which the Goel did to his kinsman, The Goel redeemed his
kinsman out of prison.
he redeemed him out of prison; so we being condemned to everlasting prison,
Zach. 9.11. our Goel has redeemed us.

It may be asked why our Goel should give any price for our redemption, Esaias
50.1. for according to the Law of Redemption, the Redeemer should pay no more
than was paid.

The devil, death, How we are said to be redeemed freely.
and sin our enemies to whom we were slaves, gave nothing for us, they held
us as tyrants and unjust possessors, wherefore when we were redeemed without
money, we were redeemed freely, both in respect of our selves who paid nothing,
and also in respect of the Devil, Sin, and Death, we are redeemed freely,
for nothing was paid to them, because they gave nothing for us; but because we
are sold from the Lord, who was our right owner, the price behoved to be paid
to him, and so 1 Pet. 1.18. We are not redeemed with corruptible gold or
silver, but with his precious blood.

He that is our Redeemer then, first, he is our near kinsman, and has
privilege to redeem us; next, he has taken the prey from the unjust
possessor; thirdly, he paid no ransom to him. Lastly, the ransom that our
Goel paid for our Redemption was his own blood, Sanguis est redemptionis jus
and redemptionis pretium, It is both the right of redemption, and the price of
redemption, Ephesians. 1.7. In whom we have redemption through his blood.

Thou that art redeemed, rejoice in thy liberty; secondly, take not that yoke
of servitude again upon thee; thirdly, show thy self a servant of obedience
to righteousness.

The privileges which the first borne had done to him, were three; first, he
had the double po^tion of his fathers goods; and secondly, all the inheritance;
and thirdly, his brother was bound to raise up seed to him.

So Jesus Christ our eldest brother has gifts above his brethren, and anointed
above his fellows; therefore the whole inheritance belongs unto him; but
this is the difference betwixt our eldest brother, and other elder brethren;
The difference betwixt Christ and other elder brothers.
here the eldest brother gets all the inheritance, and the rest are
excluded; but our eldest brother Jesus Christ secludes not us from the
inheritance, but makes us coheires with himself, Romans 8. We use to say of our
friends, that we can see them need but we will not see them bleed, but Jesus
Christ our nearest kinsman, he will neither see us need, nor bleed, but
revenges our blood, and prepares a kingdom for us.

The second thing which was done to the eldest brother, was this, if he dyed
without children, then his brother was bound to raise up seed to him, and the
children which his brother begot, were not called his children, but his eldest
brothers, Ruth 4. and if he refused to do this duty to his eldest brother,
then they spat in his face, and pulled off his shoe, and he was called
discalceatus in Israele, that is, lost his possession in Israel.

Now let us come to the application of this ceremony, who is the eldest brother
here? Christ, who are the second brothers that are bound to raise up seed unto
him? the Preachers.

Christ shall never want a seed in his Church till the Worlds end, Psalm. 72.5.
Christ shall never want a seed in the Church.
They shall fear thee as long as the sun, and the moon endures, throughout
all generations. Secondly, CHRIST promises to be with his Church to the end of
the world, then this seed shall endure to the end of the world. Thirdly, the
covenant made with this seed shall endure for ever, Hos 2.19. Therefore this
seed must endure for ever. Fourthly, the seals of the covenant and the people
within the covenant must endure for ever, 1 Cor. 11.26. Ye show the Lords
death till he come again. Fifthly, see what an express promise our eldest
brother has, that he shall never want a seed, Psalm. 72.17. (...) filiabitur
nomen eius vel sobole scet nomen eius.
[ijnnon] filiabitur nomen ejus, the Seventy transleth it (...), permanebit, he
shall not want a posterity to continue his name for ever; when Rezin King of
Syria, and Pekah King of Israel came against Jerusalem to besiege it, Esaias. 7,
Achaz trembled and feared exceedingly, that the two Kings should sack the City
and waste all; but what does the Lord to confirm Achaz? he causes Esaias the
Prophet to bring forth his young son in his hand, Shearjashub, which
signified, the rest shall return, and that there shall be a remnant seed
left still in Judah, Esaias. 1.9. Who shall be saved in the midst of all their
desolations, 2 Chro. 28. so when we see the Church like to be made havocke of
let us look up to God the Father, bringing out his Son Jesus Christ,
Shear-jashub, (...) reliquum revertetur.
to confirm us against the strength and power of the great Kings of the world,
Pekah and Rezin; that there shall always be a seed, and a remnant left, for
the Lord, and that the gates of hell shall not prevail against his Church:
when Er was dead, Onan was bound to raise up seed unto him, and when Onan
refused, then Shelah was bound to perform this duty, so there shall be some
still to perform this duty to their elder Brother Christ.

The second brother raised up seed to the eldest brother, but the children were
called the eldest brothers children. A Minister should not seek his own
praise.
Hence we learn; that a faithful pastor should not seek his own praise but
the honor of his eldest Brother Christ; if he seek his own praise, then he
begets but children to himself; when Ioab besieged Rabba, and was ready to
take it, he sent unto David, saying, come thou and take it, lest the victory
be attributed to me; so should all faithful Preachers be exceeding careful,
that whatsoever they do, the praise may belong to their elder brother;
Preachers are but the Bridegroomes friends, they should not sue for themselves
but for the Bridegroom: when Sampson sent one to be spokesman for a wife to
him, Judge. 14.^0. this spokesman took the woman to himself; he is not a
faithful spokesman that sues for himself, the Preachers are but the children
of the wedding, or the Bridgroomes friends, (...), or (...), that should be our
highest credit. 2 Cor. 4.5. I do not preach my self, but the Lord Jesus, and
my self your servant for his sake; and let us be content with John the Baptist
to decrease, that Christ may increase, and labor to exalt wisdom, and she
will exalt thee, Prove. 4.8. the only way for a Minister to get credit, is to
seek the credit of his Master; but there are too many like the Pharisees, who
did all that they might be seen of men, and in effect they say as Iehu said,
come and see how zealous I am for the Lord of hoasts, 2 King. 10.16. where a
man might see as it were through a hole of his coat, pride peeping out, and he
seeking his own praise, and not the Lords honor. Let us not be like Onan who
knowing that the seed should not be his, refused to raise it up to his eldest
brother.

If the second brother raised not up seed to his eldest brother, then they spit
in his face.

The greatest credit to a Preacher is to beget children to his eldest brother,
the Lord Jesus Christ, this was Paul's glory, this shall be their Crown and
glory in the day of the Lord; the Lord likes not these barren Eunuchs in the
Church who beget not children unto him. It was a great credit for Abdon, Iud.
12.14. To have forty sons, and thirty Nephews, that rode on threescore and
ten Asse-Coltes, but what credit shall it be for a Preacher to have so many
sons, and daughters begotten to the Lord riding in Chariotes of triumph to
Glory? when they can say, behold me, And the Children which the Lord has given
me, Esaias. 8.18. When a Preacher has begotten many sons to himself, and
built up his own house, this shall never be reckoned upon his score; but what
children have thou begotten unto me, will the Lord say; as Arrows are in the
hand of a mighty man, so are the children to the fathers, Happy is the man that
has his quiver full of them, they shall not be ashamed, but plead with the
enemies in the gate. Psalm. 127.5. The Lord objected to the Jews by Haggai.
Cap. 1.4. Is it time for you, to dwell in your seiled houses, and this house
lie waste? So the Lord may justly object to many of us that we build our own
houses, but suffer the house of the Lord to lie waste, it was an opprobry in
Israel, when a man or a woman wanted children, scribe hunc sine liberis, Iere.
22.30. and therefore they said when they had children, deus abstulit opprob^ium
meum. Luc. 1.25. The Lord has taken away my opprobry; the Lord take away that
opprobry and shame from the ministry, that they stand not up as barren and
unfruitful Eunuchs in the day of the Lord.

How shall we judge, who is a profitable Preacher?

Esaias was a good Preacher, and yet his ministry for the most part was to make
fat the hearts of the people; and he said, I have spent my strength in vain,
Esaias 49, 4. so Iere. 6.25. Cura officij. eventu^.

was an excellent Preacher; yet he said, The bellows are burnt, the Lead is
consumed and the Founder mel^eth in vain, and Christ himself converted not so
many as Peter did; There is cura officij, and cura eventus, we must measure a
faithful Pastor, How the faithfulness of a Preacher is to be measured.
per curam of ficij, and not eventus: his cura officij, is this, nosce statum
gregis tui. Prove. 27.23. To know his sheep by their names, Ioh. 10. Secondly,
to feed them diligen ly, to go out and in before them, to lead them to the
wholesome pastures, and to sow his seed faithfully and then he may lie down and
sleep, and then it grows up day and night, and he cannot tell; this cura
eventus belongs not to him. Lastly, he should be grieved when he sees the
people hard hearted, and will not be converted.

Three sorts of Preachers.
There are three sorts of Preachers; First, those who give a good account of
good sheep, who can say with Esaias. 8.18. Here am I, and the children that thou
have given me. Secondly, those who give a good account of bad sheep, he is
free of their blood, curavimus Babylonem, and noluit sanari, Iere. 51.9. this
faithful Preacher shall not want his reward with God, although he has not
converted many, and Augustine shows the matter by this comparison; two men
come into a Barbers shop to be washed, a Blackamore and another man, the Barber
washes the other man and makes him whiter, he washes the Blackamore and makes
him blacker, yet the Barber will be paid for both, because he has taken
equal pains upon both; so shall the good Preacher get his reward, although
he make not the Blackamore look the whiter. A Minister shall not be like
Jacob in the day of his reckoning, for Jacob made good to Laban, that which was
torn by the wild beasts, Genesis 31.39. but a Minister shall not make good that
which is lost, if it be not lost through his negligence, it shall suffice if he
can show the skin and the mark to the Lord, and if he have sustained the
heat of the day, and the cold of the night, as Jacob did, that is all that the
Lord requires from him.

The third sort is he that gives a bad account of bad sheep, when the sheep
perishes, through his negligence; then the Lord shall require their blood at
his hands.

Whether should a Minister be grieved,

No question he should be grieved; Jeremy wished that his head might be a
fountain of tears, Ier 9.1. That he might weep for that people, and Christ
himself wept over Jerusalem, Mat. 23.37.

But Christ himself (ye will say) gave thanks to God his Father, That he had
hid these things from the wise of the world, and revealed them unto babes,
Matthew. 11.23. and the Angel sang praise, when Esaias made fat the hearts of the
people, Esaias 6.

Christ is considered two ways; first, Christ considered as the Minist r o^
circumcision and as Mediator.
and sent to teach the Jews; no doubt it was a great grief to him when he saw
them hard-hearted, that they would not believe; but again, if ye will consider
him as Mediator, looking up to Gods wisdom and d^cree, he gives God praise
for passing by some, and choosing others; Paul looking to his charge, he wished
the Jews to be saved, but when he looks up to Gods will, in a second
consideration, then his preaching was to make fat the hearts of that people, as
was the preaching of Esaias, he rests in this; and he rejoices that God is
glorified. Simile.
Although the spheres have their own motions in particular, yet they all
follow the motion of the first mover: So although Christ and Paul be sorry at
the first for the hardness of the Jews hearts, yet they must follow the
motion of the first mover, God himself, and rejoice when he is glorified.

T^^ Angels are not ordain^ to be ministering ^pir^ts to the wicked.
The Angels sing praise to God for the hardening of the hearts of the wicked, and
they are not sad for that; the reason of this is, because they are not ordained
to be ministering spirits to such, and therefore it was no grief to them, to
see them condemned, they rejoice to see the godly converted, because they are
committed to their charge; but Ministers have both the good and the bad in
their charge, and therefore at the first cannot be but grieved that they should
miscarry, as Samuel mourned for Saul, 1 Samuel 15.35.

The travel of the Minister is not always lost.
But we are to mark, if a Preacher be faithful, and painful in his calling,
although his Ministry be not effectual to the conversion of all, yet it shall
always serve to the conversion of some. Esaias ministry was to make the
hearts of that people fat, yet there was a remnant seed left unto him, Esaias 1.9.

If he refused to raise up seed to his brother, then the woman spit in his face.

Great shame to unprofitable Ministers.
Great shall be the shame and confusion that shall befall unprofitable and
wicked Ministers in the day of the Lord, who refused to raise up seed to their
eldest brother; Mark but the circumstances of spitting in the face, and ye
shall see how great a disgrace it was. First, we use to spit upon a dog, and
not upon a man; Secondly, Number. 12.4. the Lord says, If her father had spit
upon her face, would she not have been ashamed for seven days? Where the Lord
compares Miriams leprosy to a father spitting upon his child; so the Lord
spit, as it were, Spitting in the face a great disgrace.
upon Miriam when he struck her with leprosy; and Onkelos paraphraseth it, Si
increpando increpasset eam pater ejus: The woman the weaker Sex did spit here
in the man's face, but what a shame is it for a child to have his father to
spit upon him? Thirdly, the place aggravates the shame, it was in the public
meeting, in the gates of the City, it was a great matter to be praised in the
gates of the City, Prove. 30.23. The husband when he was well apparelled,
sitting among the Elders in the gates of the City, then his wife is praised,
this was her greatest credit; so it was the greatest credit of the Father, when
he had store of children, then he was not ashamed to plead with his enemies in
the gates of the City, Psalm. 137. therefore to be put to public shame and
disgrace in that place, what shame and confusion would that breed. Lastly, that
she should spit in his face, the face is the most excellent place in the body,
and the most honorable, and not a part of dishonor. The Apostle Paul says,
If a man smite you in the face, 2 Cor. 11.20. If it was a greater shame to be
smitten in the face, than any other part of the body, then it is a greater
shame to be spit upon the face, than any other part of the body; Great shame to
have the father spit in their faces.
and if it was such a shame in Israel for a woman to spit in a man's face in
their solemn and public meetings, what shame shall it be for Preachers, if
the Lord spit in their faces in the sight of Christ and his Angels; and if it
was a shame to the daughter when the father did spit in her face, what shame
shall it be, if the Lord, who is the father of all, and of whom all fatherhood
is called, Ephesians. 3.5. if he spit in the face of those who are negligent in their
Callings; if she was separated out of her fathers sight, for seven days, what
is it to be separated out of his sight for ever? There is no argument more
forcible to move an unregenerate man to abstain from sin, Shame a bridle to
an unregenerate man.
than shame: what says Tamar to Amnon? 1 Samuel 13.13. And I, whither shall I
cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shall be counted as one of the
fools in Israel. Saul had rather kill himself than fall into the hands of the
Philistines, and abide that shame. 1 Samuel 31. When such do hear the faithful
Pastors praised in the gates of the City, what grief will this breed to them?
and when they see those who have converted others shine like stars in the
firmament, Dan. 22.3. And themselves like dark, and black clouds, Jude. 12.
What shame shall this be to them?

The natural brother who refused to raise up seed to his eldest brother, then
the woman who complained did spit in his face, but if he was a Cousin German or
another kinsman, they did not spit in his face, because he had not such a near
interest, as the natural brother had to raise up seed; yet the holy Ghost,
Ruth 4.1. does not express his name, (...)
but calls him, Pelone al moni, which implies some disgrace, the Lord would
not name him here by his name as he did Boaz.

Onan was killed because he refused to raise up seed to his brother Er; this
Er was a wicked man, yet because Onan refused to raise up seed to him, the
Lord killed him. What will he do then to those who refuse to raise up seed to
their elder Brother Jesus Christ; who is holy, blameless, and worthy of all
honor?

The putting on of the shoe a sign of possession.
They pulled off his shoe, this was a sign that he lost his inheritance, for
when they took possession of the land, they put a shoe upon their foot, and
when they lost their inheritance, the shoe was pulled off their foot.

The principal and chief regard that a man should have, is that he lose not
his inheritance; a man in Israel for necessity sometimes morgaged his
inheritance, and sometimes by violence put from his inheritance, and sometimes
through negligence, and slothfulness did suffer briars and thorns to grow up
in his inheritance, but unless he had been a runnagate like Esau, he never
sold his inheritance: look what regard Jeremiah had to that little piece of
ground in Anathoth which he redeemed from Hanameel his Uncles son, What care
Jeremiah had of his inheritance.
to secure himself in that inheritance, Iere. 32. First he bought the field,
then he weighed the silver, and gave seventeene shekles for it, then he
subscribed the evidence and sealed it, and he took witnesses, and took the
double of the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to
the Law and custom, and that which was open; than he gave the evidence of the
purchase unto Baruch, the son of Nerijah in the sight of Hanameel his uncles
son, and last he bids take these evidences, and put then in an earthen
vessel, that they might continue there for many days; had Jeremiah such a
care for so small an inheritance? a little plat of ground in Anathoth, that
cost but seventeene shekles, that he would have the evidence subscribed and
sealed before faithful witnesses, and to have them safely laid up till the
peoples return out of the captivity? shall not we then be careful of that
great inheritance which is not purchased with gold nor silver, 1 Pet. 1. to
have the evidence of it sealed, subscribed, and laid up safely in our hearts?
Esau was a profane man and a fornicator, Heb. 12.16. He sold his birth right
for a mess of pottage, if Preachers be profane and vile men like Esau, they
will set their inheritance at a light reckoning, but if they be the children of
grace, they will esteem much of it, as Naboth did of his Vineyard: it is the
inheritance that our father has prepared, and his son dearly purchased for
us, and therefore we should esteem highly of it, and beware to lose this
inheritance that was bought with such a price, left if we lose it, the shoe be
pulled off our feet, and we be called discalceati in Israele.

Now come to Christ's answer to the Sadduces objection.

Ye err not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, for in the
Resurrection men neither marry, nor give in marriage, but are like the Angels
of God.

They err not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, that is, the power
of God manifested, and set forth in the Scriptures, the Scriptures teach us
that God by his power shall raise these mortal bodies to immortality, and that
then we shall be like to the Angels in glory; and all these natural bonds and
societies amongst men and women shall cease, as to mary, and give in marriage,
etc.

Ye err not knowing the Scriptures.

All error proceeds from ignorance of the Scriptures, therefore Christ
bids the Jews, search the Scriptures, Ioh. 5.39. and the holy Scriptures
are able to make us wise unto salvation, 2 Timothy 3.15. We shall never under
stand the truth but out of the Scriptures; the Church of Rome are most
injurious to the Laickes forbidding them to read the Scriptures, what mervaill
is it that they be led into all errors, when they want this light of the
Scriptures to direct them; The Church of Rome like a Pyrat.
she may be justly compared to a Pirate; a Pirate when he takes a poor Bark
what does he? First, he takes the compass from her. Secondly, the sails,
and thirdly, the Anchor, what becomes of the poor Bark then? she is cast away
upon the Rocks; so the Church of Rome first takes from the people the
compass that is the Word of God; Secondly, she takes from them (...), (a
speech borrowed from a full sail) forbidding the people assurance of faith,
they teach them that they should have a moral persuasion of the remission of
their sins, to hope well that they shall be saved, but they say it is
presumption to be certainly persuaded of the remission of their sins; and
thus they take away (...), or the full sail from the people: now when
assurance of faith, The miserable estate of those who live in Popery.
the full sail is gone, then hope the Anchor (as the Apostle calls it, Heb.
6.19.) must be lost also; ye see then the necessity of searching the
Scriptures; and if we would be free of error we must study to know them, and
lamentable is their estate, who live in popery, exposed to all danger, because
they have not the use of the holy Scriptures.

Nor the power of God, Twofold power in God.


There is a twofold power in God, first his absolute power. Secondly, his
limited power; his absolute power is this, when he can do any that implies
not a contradiction, for that were impotency in God; his limitate power is
this, when his will limitateth his power, and his other attributes: God by his
absolute power could have destroyed Sodom before Lot came out of it, but by his
limited power, he could not, Genesis 19.22. God may do many things by his
absolute power which he cannot do by his limited power.
because it made more for the glory of God, that Lot should be saved, then
destroyed with the Sodomites; so God by his absolute power might cast away
Peter, but by his limited power, he cannot, because it makes more for his mercy
to save Peter, then to destroy him. Christ by his absolute power could have
wrought miracles in Nazareth, but by his limited power he could not, because it
made more for his glory, not to work any amongst that unbeleeving people,
Mark 6, 5. So Christ by his absolute power could have prayed for so many
millions of Angels to have delivered him; but by his limited power he could
not, because it made more for the glory of his Father, that he should die for
the redeeming of his Church, then that he should escape the cursed death of the
Cross; here Christ speaks of that limited power of God, and not of his
absolute power.

Ye err not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.

We should know Gods power out of the Scriptures.
We must learn to know the power of God, only out of the Scriptures, that
power which is attributed to God, and not found in the Scriptures, is not to be
counted Gods power: there is a question betwixt us and the Church of Rome,
whether the body of Christ can be both in Heaven, and in the Sacrament at once,
they allege the power of God for them, because God by his power can make this
body to be really in the Sacrament; but we reply unto them, that they err not
knowing the Scriptures and the power of God; if they could demonstrate to us
out of the Scriptures this power, then we would believe them; but the Scripture
says, that Jesus Christ's body is in the heavens, and must be contained there
till he come to judgment, Acts 3.21. Whom the heavens must receive until the
times of the restitution of all things. And therefore this power is but an
imaginary power, contrary to the Scriptures of God.

We shall be like the Angels of God, who neither marry nor give in marriage.

There is a good axiom in the Schools, that relata extra usum non sunt
relata, relations out of their use, are no relations; a Land-marke, so long as
it stands in the field, distinguishing one man's land from another, it is in the
relation but taken out of that place, that relation cease; the bread in the
Sacrament is holy bread, so long as it is in the use, but out of this holy use
it becomes common bread again; those things that were eaten in (...), or
Idols chapel, were idolatrous in state there, and might not be eaten; but
when they were sold in the Shambles, they were extra usum, and Paul allowed
then to eat of them: so here the woman is the wife to the husband in this
life, but in the life to come, this relation cease, And we shall be like the
Angels of God, who neither marry nor give in marriage.

We shall be like the Angels of God. Our condition in the life to come, shall
be perfect.


Mark the perfection of our condition and estate in the life to come, above
our estate and condition here; our estate and condition here is twofold; either
our estate after our fall, or our estate in innocence, we stand in need of many
things after our fall, that we needed not before our fall; after our fall we
have need of clothes to cover us, of Physic to cure us, of sleep and rest
to refresh our wearied bodies, and a thousand such; before the fall we had need
of meat, and we had need of marriage, for man was not to live in Innocence here
for ever, and therefore had need of children to succeed him to continue his
generation; but in the life to come we shall stand in need of none of these
things, whereof we stood in need, either in our first estate in innocence, or
after the fall. This Doctrine serves to reproove Turks, Jews, Chiliasts,
Epicures, and such as imagine the life to come, to be after the condition and
estate of this life, that men shall be there in pleasant Gardens, have great
Feasts, wear gorgeous apparel, by imagining no higher of heavenly things and
estate in the life to come, than of earthly things below here, like unto little
children, the highest things that they can imagine of, are sweetnesses, or
those things which delight the taste, but we must have transcendent thoughts,
when we think of heaven, those things which the eye never saw, the ear never
heard, nor entered into the heart of man, are laid up for his children in the
life to come, 1 Cor. 2.9. there our meat and our drink shall be, to do the
will of our God; we shall not stand in need of marriage there, because we shall
continue for ever. In this life marriage is necessary to continue our kind,
because we are mortal here, we live in our m^^^ers b^lly, We have three
mansions.
this is our first mansion; we live in the world, this is our second mansion;
and we live in heaven, that is our third mansion. If it were possible that a
child could imagine or think any thing in his mothers belly, and should
conceive the estate of the perfectest man upon earth, when he is lying in his
mothers belly, wallowing in his blood, breathing by the Navell, were not this a
false and a base imagination? a thousand times greater difference is there
betwixt our estate here, and our condition in the life to come; therefore to
measure the life to come by our condition here, is great folly.

We shall be like the Angels of God.

Great difference betwixt our condition in this life, and our estate in the
life to come.
Here the Jesuits fall into the commendation of single life, that it is
Angelical; but they distinguish not our condition in this life, and our estate
in the life to come; this single life shall make us like the Angels, but in
this life it makes us not to resemble the Angels, for men here marry and give
in marriage, they marry here for the continuance of their kind, which they need
not in the life to come; they marry here for the avoiding of Lust, and
fornication; but in the life to come, they shall not be subject to this; and
therefore need no marriage.

We shall be like the Angels of God.

How the Angels are describe^, cap. 1.
The creatures which are most perfect, are the Angels, and the perfection of man
is to imitate them; the Angels are described by the Prophet, Ezekiel. c. 1 with
the face of a man, with the Crest of a Lion, with the wings of the Eagle, and
the foot of the Ox. First, with the face of a man, to signify their
understanding, for of all visible creatures man is the most understanding.
Secondly, they are described with the Crest of a Lion for their strength.
Thirdly, with the wings of the Eagle for their swiftness; and lastly with the
foot of the Ox, for their obedience; would ye then describe an Angel? He is
a creature most wise, most strong, An Angel, what?
most swift and nimble, and most obedient, and ye have the proof of this,
first of their wisdom; the woman of Tekoah said to David, And my Lord is
wise, according to the wisdom of an Angel of God, 2 Samuel 14.26. And for their
strength, ye see how one Angel killed an hundredth fourscore, and five
thousand in one night in Senacheribs host, 2 King. 19.35. and for their
swiftness ye have example in the Angel, who in one night killed all the first
borne in Egypt. Exodus 12.29. and for their obedience, they are so ready to obey
the Lord, that they are made a pattern and example to us, Matthew. 6.10. Thy will
be done in earth, as it is in heaven, We should do his will upon earth as they
do if in the heavens, that is, most willingly.

And now to make use of this for the Ministry, the Ministers are called the
Angels of the Lord, Reve. 3. because they should resemble most the Angels.

First, The Angels behold the Face of God continually, Matthew. 18, 10. and they
desire with stretched out necks to behold the mystery of the incarnation, 1
Pet. 1.12, If they desire to see the face of God in his Word as the Angels do
see his face in glory, and have an earnest desire to understand the mysteries
of salvation, then they are like the Angels, and may be called Angels.

Secondly, they are the Angels of God, because they carry the message of the
Lord, and therefore they should speak nothing, but the Lords message unto the
people, Hag. 1.13. Then spoke Haggai the Lords messenger in the Lords message
unto the people.

Thirdly, The good Angels keep the Saints in all their ways, Psalm. 91.12. For
he shall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways,
lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. So should Ministers keep the people
committed to their charge; they should beware to cast in offenses, either by
erroneous Doctrine, or scandalons living to offend the weak, that they dash
not their foot against them.

Fourthly, The Angels do separate the good fish from the bad, And sever the
wicked from amongst the just, Matthew. 13.49. So should Ministers strive to
separate notorious vile sinners from amongst the righteous and then they shall
resemble the Angels, yea they shall become the Lords mouth in so doing. Iere.
15.19. If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shall be as my mouth.

Of Satan's accusation of Joshua the High Priest.
Zach. 3.1. And he showed me Joshua the Highpriest standing before the Angel
of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him, etc.
IN this Chapter are set down the benefits whch God bestowed upon his Church,
after she returned from the captivity; and first what he did for Joshua the
Highpriest, as a type, to Verse. 8. Secondly, what he did for the Church, in the
three last verses.

In the type again these things are to be considered; First, how Christ our
Advocate takes the defense of Joshua against Satan, Verse. 2, and then how he
pardons him of his sins, and sanctifies him, verse. 3.4.5. and lastly, the
promise which Christ, the Angel of the covenant, makes unto him, if he walk
in his ways, Verse. 6.7.8.

The accuser is Satan, the accused is Joshua, and the defender is Christ.

Satan, the accuser is described by his name, (...) Satan, Adversarius saluti
hominum a (...) adversari, odio ^^bere.
he is called Satan, that is, qui intestino odio prosequitur, who has a
deadly hatred against the sons of men; the place where he stood when he
accused, was at Joshua's right hand, for it was the manner of the accusers
amongst the Jews, to stand at the right hand of the party accused, when they
did accuse, Psalm. 109.6. The accuser stood at the right hand of the party
accused.
Let Satan stand at his right hand and when he shall be judged, let him be
condemned. The thing which he accused him of was because he stood in filthy
apparel before the Lord.

The opinion of Hierome concerning Joshua.
Hierome is of this mind, that Joshua the Highpriest married a strange woman
contrary to the Commandment of the Lord, as the rest of the Jews did, Ezr.
10.18. And he holds that Satan did accuse him justly here, because he had
married a stranger as well as the rest, but we are rather to incline to
Jonathan the Paraphrast in this, who Paraphraseth it thus, Filios habebat qui
duxerant uxores non convenientes sacerdotio, hoc est, alienigenas, ipse vero
non corripiebat eos, that is, he had sons who married wives who were not
lawful for the Priests to marry, and yet he reproved not them, this may seem
rather to be the cause for which he was blamed, as we may see, Ezr. 10.18. And
amongst the sons of the Priests, there were some that had taken strange
wives, namely of the sons of Joshua the son of Iozedek, and it was for this
that his priestly Garments were stained.

And he showed me Joshua.

Four things are to be considered in this name Joshua. First, that Joshua was
called Hoshea, and Moses changed this name, and called him Iehoshua, and the
Greeks called him Jesus. Act. 7.45.

The opinion of the Jews concerning the change of Joshua's name.
The Jews say that the letter [jod] was taken from the name Iehova, and was put
to Hoshea, and then he was called Joshua, as the letter [he] was taken from
Iehoua, and put to Abram, and then he was called Abraham, but if this their
observation were true, then it should follow, that when the Lord took the
letter [jod] from a name, that it should be for the disgrace of the person, as
Sarai, the Lord changed her name, and called her Sarah; this change was for the
credit of Sarah, and yet [jod] was taken from it, before she was, my princess,
but now she is a princess simply; when David's incestuous son Amnon was
called Amminon. 2 Samuel 13.2. Was the letter [jod] added for his credit? No,
(...)
but the reason why this name was changed was this, to signify the authority
which the Lord had over him; for the imposition of new names signifies
authority in him that imposes, as Ioseph's name was changed by the King of
Egypt, and he was called Zaphnath-paaneah, To impose or change a name, a sign
of authority.
Genesis 41.45. So Eliacim's name was changed by Pharao Neco, and he was called
Iehojakim, so Ananias, Misael, and Hazarias their names were changed in Babel,
so Simon's name was changed into Peter; Jacobs name was changed into Israel; So
this name Hoshea was changed into Joshua, Number. 13.16. and Revel. 2.17. To him
that over comes I will give a new name.

Secondly, Moses gave him this name by the Spirit of God, either foreseeing
that he should be his successor, and save the people from their enemies the
Canaanites, or praying for him that the Lord would save him from the wicked
spies as Salo. Iarchi says.

Thirdly, the Seventy translate this name Joshua always Jesus.

Whether may this name Jesus be given to any in the Church now, as Colos. 4.11.
Salute Jesus which is called Iustus.

This name Joshua contracted into Jesus by the Greeks, Jesus, none may be
called Jesus but Christ himself; for he both preserves alive and gives life:
the Hebrews take vivificare, vel in vita conservare, vel vitae restituere,
Number. 22.33. so Number. 31.15. Number vivificastis omnem foeminam have ye kept the
women alive; so Luc. 13.34. Joshua might have done this; but vivificare is
vitae restituare, to restore to life again, and this Joshua could not do, but
Jesus who quickens the dead, and restores them to life again. 1 Cor. 15.22.

And Satan standing at his right hand.

The right hand was the chief place; for the understanding of this situation
amongst the Jews, mark first, How to understand the situation at the right
hand.
when three are going together or sitting together, he that is in the middle
place is in the chief place, he that stands upon his right hand, is in the
second place; and he that stands on his left hand is in the third place; and
in this sense we are to understand these places, He shall set the sheep at
his right hand, and the goats at his left hand, Matthew. 25.33. Christ is in the
highest place, the sheep in the second place, and the goats in the third; so
the mother of Zebedees children; Matthew. 20.21. desired that one of her sons
might stand at Christ's right hand, and another at his left hand; Christ is in
the highest place, he that stands at his right hand in the second place; and
he that stands at the left hand, is in the third place.

Secondly, when the most eminent person sits, he that sits at his right
hand, is in the second place, Example, Solomon sat upon a throne, and his
mother at his right hand, 1 King. 2.19. Solomon was in the first place, and his
mother in the second. So Christ sits at the right hand of the father, that
is, in the second place next to the father, for we cannot imagine that Christ
as mediator sits above his father.

The right hand is the more excellent, being compared with the left.
Thirdly, when the two hands are compared together, then the right hand is the
more excellent, and so Paul says, They gave unto us the right hand of
fellowship, Galat. 2.9. So Benjamin is called the son of the right hand, and
Solomon, Eccles. 10.2. says; that the wise man's heart is in his right side,
and the fools in his left side; How the wise man's heart is said to be in his
right side.
the reason why the fools heart is said to be in his left side, is because the
blood for the most part falls to the left side, and so the heart that is dull
is said to be in the left side; but the spirits again ascend from the left
side to the right, and so the wise man's heart is said to be in his right side,
because he has more understanding. So in pleading before the judges the
accused stood at the left hand of the accuser, as Satan stood at the right hand
of Joshua, but if the accused prevailed in judgment, and the accuser succumbed
then he was shifted from the right hand to the left hand, then he was said to
lose his cause.

But when the Scripture speaks of protection, The left hand put first for
protection.
it puts the left hand first, Psalm. 16.8. Because he is at my right hand, I
shall not be moved. Then David stood at his left hand. So Psalm 129.5. The Lord
is thy defense at thy right hand. So when Job prays, Job 17.3. Pone me juxta
te, set me by thee, that is, at thy left hand, that thou may defend me with
thy right hand.

Lastly, when the heart and the hand are compared together, then the left hand
is the chief hand, therefore the Jews wore their Phylacteries upon their left
arm, because it was nearest their heart; and so the Latins say of him that
went at the left hand, Ambulare introrsum vel extrorsum quid.
ambulare introrsum, because that hand was nearest the heart, and of him that
goes at the right hand, they say of him, ambulare extrorsum, and we use to say
when we give a man the left hand, we give him the hand that is nearest the
heart.

Standing at his right hand.

To stand, in the Scriptures, is either to pray, Stand, taken diversely. Stare,
pro orare.
as Abraham is said to stand before the Lord, that is, to pray, and the
Publican stood a far off, that is, prayed. So Iere. 18.20. Remember that I
stood before thee to speak for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them;
and the Hebrews say, Sine stationibus non subsisteret mundus, that is, without
prayers the world could not endure, because they stood when they prayed.

Secondly, to stand, signifies to serve, Pr. 22.29. See thou a servant
diligent in his business, Stare pro servire.
this man shall stand before Kings, that is, serve, Psalm. 135.2. Ye who stand
in the Courts of the Lord, that is, who serve.

Thirdly, to stand in the Scripture, is to stand to be judged before a Judge;
Stare pro judicare.
as Exodus 17.14. Why does the people stand all the day long, So amongst the
Latins, Stare in judicio, and cadere causa, Psalm. 1.5. Impij non stabunt in
judicio, that is, they shall lose their cause, now Joshua stood here praying,
Joshua stood here ready to serve, and Joshua stood as accused.

He showed me Satan standing at the right hand of Joshua.

Four chief combats betwixt God and the Devil.
We may mark four singular strifes betwixt God and the Devil, about four
singular of the Lords valiant ones.

The first was between God and Satan about Job, cap. 1, The second was betwixt
Michael the Archangell and the Devil, about the body of Moses, Jude 9. The
third, was betwixt Christ and the Devil about the Highpriest Joshua here. The
fourth, was betwixt Christ and the Devil, about the faith of Peter, Luc. 22.31.

In the first strife betwixt God and the Devil, about Job; it might seem
strange that God gave such a way to Satan in this conflict; but if we will
consider Gods end in it, Why God suffered Satan to afflict Job.
we shall see both his wisdom and goodness in it; for God did not expose Job
to these trials, that the Devil might swallow him up; but both that he might
get the greater glory by this his Champion Job, and that the Church might
learn patience by this example; ye have heard the patience of Job, Iam. 5.11.
The Lord delighted here to see his champion Job wrestle, and to return
victorious, God takes delight to see his children fight with Satan.
and to put Satan to the foil; the Roman Emperors used to keep Lions in
cages, and they used to cast in condemned persons to them to fight to the death
with them; we read in Tertullian how conclamatum est, Christiani ad Leones; so
the Lord keeps the Devils in Cages, and brings not out slaves and condemned
wretches to fight with them, but his most notable champions whom he knows will
report the Victory, and therefore he delights to behold this conflict.

The second reason, why the Lord put Job to these hard trials was for the good
of his Church; for even as the Physicians keep the bodies of the condemned to
make anatomies of them for the good of others, so the Lord kept Job for this
trial, for the good of the Church, that they might remember the patience of
Job.

The second great strife was betwixt Michael the Archangell and the Devil,
about the body of Moses, A second strife betwixt Christ and Satan about the
body of Moses.
Jude 9. It is strange to see how Satan deals with Moses; when Moses was
living, nothing but stone him to death; but now when he is dead, he would make
an Idol of his body, and set it up to be worshipped; and that which he could
not effectuate by him when he was living, he goes about to effectuate it now
by his dead body. It was a great sin, first to kill the Prophets, and then to
erect Sepulchers to them, Matthew. 23.29. Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites, because, etc. but this is a greater sin first to kill Moses, and
then afer his death to labor to make an Idol of him; but the Lord had a great
respect to Moses who was faithful in all his house, Heb. 3.5. when he was
living, so now when he was dead he preserved this his body, and buried it
honorably with his own hands, where the devil knows not.

The third strife betwixt CHRIST and the Devil was about Joshua the
Highpriest; Satan accuses Joshua for standing before the LORD in soiled
apparel, but the Lord takes his defense, puts Satan to rebuke, puts new
apparel upon Joshua, and sets a crown upon his head.

The fourth strife was about Peter's faith, Satan sought to winnow Peter as
wheat, but Christ prayed for Peter's faith, that it should not fail, Luc.
22.31. The devil gave his faith a shrewd blow, and sifted him strangely, when
he made him deny his master thrice. But Christ saved him by his intercession.

We are to make use of these conflicts, 2 Cor. 10.13. that God will not suffer
us to be tempted above that we are able, God will not suffer us to be tempted
above our power.
but with the temptation will make a way always to escape, that we may be able
to bear it.

Observe in Satan's tempations first the order, and then the manner; the Apostle
has an heavenly order, 1 Cor. 11.3. The order of Satan's temptations.
God is Christ's head, Christ is the ma^s head, and the man is the woman's head,
the Devil first he tempted the Woman, the weaker Vessel: Secondly, he
tempted the man, the woman's head; Thirdly, he tempted Christ here in his type
Joshua, and then Christ in proper person, who is the man's head; but he durst
never go higher to tempt God Christ's head. There is nothing contrary to God by
his omnipotency, he subdueth all things to him, as there is nothing sum
malum, as God is sum bonum, for then there should be duo principia, as the
Manicheans held, so the Devil is not absolutely contrary to God, but must be
subject unto him, and overruled by him.

And if we shall mark the manner of his temptations, we shall see them
strange. First, he intices and sets forward men to mischief, and then he
would be their first accuser, like unto Ioab. 2 Samuel 18.12, when Absalom was
hanging in an oak tree, one came and told Ioab that he was hanging there, Ioab
offered the man ten shekles of silver to kill him, but what says the man? he
refused, and said, No, and thou would give me a thousand shekles of silver,
The manner of Satan's temptations.
for the King commanded to spare the young man, and if I should do so, thou
would be the first man that would set thy self against me; for Ioab first
to persuade the man to kill Absalom, and then to be the first to accuse the
man, was not this a shameless accuser? So for the Devil first to set men on
work, and then to accuse them, is not this a vile accuser?

Satan is a cruel and a crafty adversary, he is called Satan, quia intestino
odio prosequitur, because he pursues with deadly hatred, and that red Dragon
who thirsts for the blood of the children of men, therefore miserable are those
who seek to him for relief in their sickness or distress, Exodus 4.14. I am
the Lord that heals thee: many think that there are some gentle sorts of
Devils that can do men no harm, and that are (...), but if they understood
Satan's grounded and rooted malice and craft, they would never seek to him.

Observe the nature of this false accuser, How Satan deals with his own
children, and how with the children of God.
when he accuses the child of God, he makes his sins appear more than they
are; if Joshua's clothes be soyled, he makes them appear like the clothes of
the menstruous women; but when he has to do with the wicked, he makes their
sins appear less than they are; but God keeps a contrary course; when he
looks upon the sins of his Saints, they seem less to him than they are,
Iere. 51.20. Jacobs iniquity shall be sought for, and shall not be found, and
Romans 8.1. No condemnation to them which are in Christ; but when he looks upon
the sins of the wicked, he sees them just as they are; Simile.
when a man looks in a round glass, his face seems to him less than it is;
when a man looks in a hollow glass, his face seems to him more than it is;
when a man looks in a plain glass, his face seems just to him as it is.
They will never be well decked to whom the Devil holds up the glass, of all
men the Devil takes most notice of the sins of the Ministers, and is
readiest to lay their sins to their own charge, and to blaze them abroad to
others; if there be a hole in their coat, he will say they are ragged; and if
their clothes be soyled, he will say they are naked; he observes all our
infirmities, and watches our haltings; therefore let us look well to our
ways.

To resist him.

Satan lays to Joshua's charge the faults of the people, here Joshua
represented the whole people, for the Priest under the law bare the sins of
all the people; but to be partakers of the sins of the people, as here Joshua
was when he did bear with the people that had married strange wives, How a
Minister may be guilty of the sins of the people.
that is a great sin.

A Minister may be guilty of the sins of the people sundry ways; First, of
the ignorance of the people, when he instructs them not; the lipes of the
Priest should preserve knowledge. Secondly, he is guilty of the sins of the
people when he reproves them not for their sin, as, Mal. 2.9. Accepistis
facies in lege, what is that, Ye have accepted persons in the Law? that is,
when the great men sinned, the Priest durst not reprove them, but was partial
in his reproves. Thirdly, they are guilty of the sins of the people when
they scandalize them by their bad life, when they carry not the tender, and
weak Lambs in their bosoms, or cause them to abort, For whom Christ has
died, Rom: 14.15. Lev. 4.3. in reatum populi, (...), to cause the people to
trespass, 1 Chro. 21.3 Why will thou be a trespass to Israel?

How the Minister may be partaker of the sins of the people.
And as the Preacher may be an occasion and a stumbling to make the people
sin, so he may be partaker of the sins of the people, if he follow them in
their sins; we have a notable example of this, Amos 2.11. The Lord forbad
expressly the Nazarits to drink wine, and yet the wicked Jews came and
tempted them to drink wine, and they to be counted boon companions, did
drink wine with them; and thus they were guilty of the sins of the people.
But they should have remembered that of Iere. 15.19. Turn thou not to them, but
let them turn to thee, they bid you drink wine, will ye drink it? then ye
go to them; but refuse to drink it, stand in your place and let them rather
come to you; run not in that same excess of riot with them.

When Joshua's sons married strange wives, this was a stain to his holy
garments; so when the sons of Eli lay with the women that came to the
Tabernacle; it made the sacrifice of the Lord to be abhorred, and when the
Priests daughter committed whoredom, it was a great disgrace and shame unto
him, therefore Paul will have a Minister, To rule well his own house, having
his children in subjection with all gravity, 1 Timothy 3.4. and he gives the
reason why they should have obedient children and his house well ordered, verse.
5, For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of
the Church of God.

How shall a Minister know that he is free from the pollutions of the people?

First, Esaias. 6.5. Woe is me, for I am undone, Notes for a Minister to know
when he is free from the sins of his people.
because I am a man of polluted lipes, and I dwell in the midst of a people of
polluted lips; he that is not touched with a sense of his own pollutions will
never be touched with a sense of the peoples.

Secondly, he shall know if he be free from the pollutions of the people, if he
be grieved for their sins, as the soul of just Lot was vexed for the
unclean conversation of the Sodomites, 2 Pet. 2.7. and if he say with David,
woe is me that I sojourne in Mesech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar. Psalm.
120.5.

Thirdly, when he dwells amongst a corrupt people, let him converse little
with them, and separate himself from them in conversation, or live like a
Pelican in the Wilderness, Psalm. 102.6. and when he comes abroad amongst them,
do as those do who dwell amongst a people, where the sickness is, that is,
have his Antidot or Amulet with him, that he be not infected with corruption.

The sacrifice for the Priests since was as great as the sacrifice of the whole
people.
The Priest was guilty of the peoples sins, and therefore as great a sacrifice
was offered for him, as for the whole people; we have personal sins enough
to be charged for, but when we are charged likewise for the sins of the
people, and be guilty of them, then it will be a fearful reckoning, happy are
we if we can say I am free from the blood of this people, Act. 20.26.

The Hebrews speak of themselves in the plural number.
And the Lord said to Satan, the Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, which may be thus
construed^, I will rebuke thee Satan, for it is the manner of the Hebrews to
speak of themselves in the third person, as if they were speaking of another,
as Genesis 4.23. Hear my voice ye wives of Lamech, that is, my wives, so Genesis
19.24. The Lord rained from the Lord, that is, from himself, so Esth. 8.8.
Write unto the Jews in the Kings name, that is, in my name. So here, The Lord
rebuke thee, O Satan, that is, I will rebuke thee. Or it may be the speech of
the son to the father, Actiones ad extra fiunt a ^atre authoritative, a fi^^
vero subauthoritative, th father rebukes from himself, and the son from the
father.
desiring the father to rebuke him; here he desires his father to rebuke, and
Marc. 1.26. he himself rebukes, for the actions ad extra (as they speak in
the Schools) are common to all the three persons; when the father does rebuke,
he rebukes by the son, and by the holy Ghost, and when the son does
rebuke, he rebukes from the father, and by the holy Ghost; and when the holy
Ghost does rebuke, he rebukes from the Father and from the Son.

The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.

What is meant by rebuke here? What is meant by rebuke here.
the Seventy translates it (...), it is not a simple rebuke then, but conjoined
with opprobry and shame; the Greek Fathers afterward called the censures of
the Church, as excommunication, etc. (...).

Satan is accursed of God with a last and most fearful sort of
excommunication Maran-atha or Shan-atha, Dominus venit, Jude 14. the lesser
sort of excommunication is used in the Church for the destruction of the flesh,
and saving of the spirit, 1 Cor. 6.5. and I gave them to Satan, that they may
learn not to blaspheme, 1 Timothy 1.20. but this last and fearful sort of
excommunication, is a final and total rejection of the party; when one was
excommunicate by this first sort of excommunication, he was to be reputed as a
Publican, none might eat with him, salute him, or converse with him; what a
fearful thing is it then in these times that Witches should be so familiar
with the Devil, salute him as their Master, banquet with him, dance with him,
The manner how they excommunicated the Samaritans.
and more than that, to lie with him, these that are without, 1 Cor. 5.13. what
have we to do with them? the Jews would not meddle with the Samaritans,
because they were Apostates from their Religion, and fearfully excommunicated,
they brought 300 Priests, and 300 Trumpets, and 300 Books of the Law, and 300
Boys and they blew with the Trumpets, and the Levites reading, Drusius ex
Tilmideni qui sepher tanhuma etiam dicitur.
accursed the Cuttaeans in the name of Tetragrammaton, or Iehova, and with the
curses both of the Superior and Inferior house of judgment, And they said,
Cursed is he that eats the bread of the Cuttaean, he that eats the bread
of the Cuttaean or Samaritan, is as he that eats Swines flesh, and let no
Cuttaean be a Proselyte in Israel, neither have any part in the Resurrection,
these curses they wrote upon tables, and sealed them, and sent them through all
Israel, who multiplied also their great Anathema or curse upon them: If the
Samaritans were so execrable to the Jews, that they would not eat with them,
nor salute them that were thus excommunicated, what a fearful sin is it
then to salute the Devil, to eat with him, who is given over to that last and
fearful curse. They said, thou art a Samaritan, and he is a Devil, Ioh.
8.48. they hated them as if they had been Devils, should not then men and
women much more hate the devil himself, and count his bread execrable.

And the Lord said to Satan, the Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.

Observe that all the defense of the Church against Satan, is only in Christ,
I have prayed for thee Peter that thy faith might not fail, Luc. 22.32. Now
that ye may understand this the better, how Christ protecteth his Church, it
shall not be amiss to mark the Epithites that are given to Satan in the
Scripture; and then to observe the Epithites given to Christ contrary to these,
for defense of his Church.

First the Devil is called Abaddon, Apollyon, Revel. 9.11. The Epethites of
Christ, and the Epithites of Satan are opposite.
and Ashmoderus, Tobit. 3.8. A destroyer; but Christ is called Jesus a Savior,
Mat. 1.21. Thou shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from
their sins.

Secondly, the Devil is called (...), That evil one Mat. 37. But Christ is
called Jesus the Just, Act. 3.14. He denied the holy One and the Just. So 1
Ioh. 2.1. We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.

Thirdly, the Devil is (...), an adversary, 1 Pet. 5.8. Your adversary the
Devil like a roaring Lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour, he ever
sets himself against us; but Christ is called Emmanuel, God with us, Matt.
1.25.

Fourthly, the Devil is called the accuser of the brethren, Revelat. 12.10.
but Christ is our Advocate, 1 Ioh. 2.1.

Fifthly, he is called the Tempter, Mat. 2.3. but Jesus Christ is called the
Comforter, and the consolation of Israel, Luc. 21.25. primogenitus mortis, Job.
18.13. The first borne of death, (as many of the Fathers expound it) but Christ
is principium and primogenitus ex mortuis, the beginning and the first borne
from the dead, Coloss. 1.18. Revel. 1.5. by whom we shall live and rise again.

Seventhly, the Devil is that roaring Lion that seeks to devour us, 1. Pet.
5.8. but Christ is that Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the root of David who has
prevailed mightily, Revel. 5.5.

Lastly, the Devil is that Old Serpent who stingeth us to death, but Christ is
that Serpent lift up in the Wilderness, that whosoever looks upon him and
believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life, John 3.15.

The Prophet Zachariah, saw in a vision four horns rising up to molest and
trouble the Church, but he saw four Carpenters come to beat down these
horns, Zach. 1.18. This is the comfort of the Church, that there is no
tentation that arises from Satan to trouble her, but the Lord has a hammer to
beat it down, and si venenum in Diabolo, antidotum in Christo, and if there
be poison in the Devil, there is a remedy for it in Christ.

The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.

The Apostle Jude, verse 8. A great sin to curse the Magistrate.
gathers out of this place and out of the fight betwixt Michael the
Archangell and the Devil about the body of Moses, that men should not revile
those who are in authority. Michael is God blessed for e^^, Satan is a
condemned spirit, yet Michael will not rail against him. The Devil is a
condemned spirit, and we are bound to pray against him; but we are bound to
pray for Magistrates of whose salvation we hope well, therefore we are not to
curse them; the Lord commanded his people to pray for Nebuchadnezzer, and for
Babylon, Iere. 20 7. and the Apostle wills them to pray for all that are in
Authority, 1 Timothy 2.2. yea although they be infidels; David's heart smot him for
cutting off the lap of Saul's garment, 1 Samuel 24.5. and should not their hearts
smite them, who rail against Princes, much more for killing of them, the Lord
will make the fowls of the heaven to discover this wickedness, although it be
secretly spoken in their chambers, Eccles. 10.20.

The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.



Eva by reasoning and keeping purpose with him, got the foil.



is more spiritual, Galath, 6.12. therefore we should turn to God, and
desire the Lord to rebuke him.

What are we to think of those Exorcists who take upon them to cast out the
devil?

That gift was an extraordinary gift bestowed only upon the Church in her
infancy, Gifts simply necessary for the Church.
the gifts which served simply for the Church were, Ephesians. 4.10.11. Apostles,
Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers. The Apostle, 1 Cor. 12. Gifts necessary for
the Church in her infancy.
reckons up other gifts which were not simply necessary for the Church, but
only for her infancy; as the gift of healing, the gift of tongues, and this
gift of casting out devils; if the Highpriest after the captivity should have
put in two counterfeit stones in the breastplate, and called them Vrim, and
Thummim, would not this have been a falsehood in him, when the gift ceased, to
use the sign? so now when there is no such gift in the Church, to use the
name, this is but a deceit.

Gifts necessary for the building of the Church were of two sorts. Gifts
necessary for the Church of two sorts.


First, extraordinary, as Apostles and Evangelists.

Secondly, ordinary, as Pastors and teachers; other gifts were only for the
infancy of the Church, the matter may be cleared by this example; A Prince
when he is a child he has need of a regent, Simile.
of counselors, and boys to play with him; but when the Prince comes to
maturity of age, the Regent cease, and his Play fellows, but not his
Counselors; so the Church in her minority had Apostles and Evangelists, as her
regents; and she had these gifts of ngues, healing, and casting out of Devils,
as her play-fellowes, these cease now; but Pastors and Teachers as her
counselors remain still with her; when Satan is cast out, now by Exorcists
this is not (...), by force to cast him out, but only by collusion, he goes
out, but he returns again.

Even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee, as if he should say, I
have decreed that Jerusalem shall be built, although thou have set thy self
against this, yet thou can not hinder it; Jerusalem taken for the City, and
for the people in the City.
Jerusalem is taken here, first, for the City Jerusalem, and then for the
people gathered to that City out of the captivity.

No counsel can stand against the counsel of the Lord; see what Gamaleel
said, Act. 5.38. if this Counsel be of God, we cannot hinder it; ye may see
what strange impediments, were cast in to hinder the building of the Temple,
although it was Gods purpose to have it built again, there was an hundredth and
thirteen years before it was finished, after the foundation was laid; First,
it was hindered by craft, We will build with you, Ezr. 3. then by bribes, They
hired counselors to weaken the hands of the people, and troubled them in
building, Ezr. 4.5. Thirdly, by false accusationes by letters, Ezr. 4.6.
Fourthly by force, Ezr. 4.23. Fifthly, by the Kings edict. Ezr. 4.21. Lastly,
when they could do no more they hindered them by taunts, and mocking, if a fox
go up with his tail, he will destroy this work. Nehem. 4.3. yet because the
Lord had determined to build it, it must be builded, the Counsel of the Lord
stands sure for ever, therefore in Zachary it is compared to Mountains of
Brass, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

The Lord has chosen Jerusalem, although the Lord made choice of Jerusalem,
yet this notable vine which he planted degenerated, Iere. 2.21. and then he
rejected it, and brought great desolations upon it, Esaias. 29.1. I will make
Jerusalem like Ariel; when Jerusalem killed the Prophets then he sprinkled it
with blood like Ariel, the Altar which was sprinkled with blood.

Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?

As if the Lord would say, he is new brought out of the captivity, and
therefore no mervell though his clothes be yet soiled.

There are three sorts of wants in the Church, First, Three sorts of wants in
the Church.
wants of necessity; Secondly, occasional wants; Thirdly, contracted wants;
wants of necessity are these, when God with-draweth the means, Wants of
necessity what.
that the Church cannot have them; when the people were in the Wilderness, and
sacrificed there, they had neither wine nor oil to join to their sacrifice,
yet their sacrifice was accepted, because it was a want of necessity; The
anointed of the Lord.
so the Highpriest in the second Temple he wanted Vrim, and Thummim, and he
wanted the holy oil, therefore he was not called in the second Temple, Vnctus
Iehovae, but vir multarum vestium, the man with the many clothes, because he
had five ornaments belonging to him, which none of the rest of the Priests had,
although he wanted this holy oil yet he was accepted, and his sacrifice,
because this was a want of necessity.

Secondly, occasional wants are these, when men for the time cannot so
conveniently have their defects supplied; as Number. 10. Eleazar and Ithamar, when
they should have eaten the sin offering in the holy place; they forgot to
eat it, and suffered it to burn, because they were in such grief for Nadab,
and Abihu; Aaron takes the defense of them in this case, and says such
things have befallen me this day, and no mervaile, that both I and my sons
should have forgotten to eat the sin offering in the holy place, Number. 10.
Occasional wants what.
if we being in our sin, should have taken upon us to purge the sins of
the people, should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord? Moses
accepts of this occasional want, because they were in great grief, it was
no mervaile that they forgot to eat it; So they now lately coming out of the
captivity, no mervaile that Joshua was not so handsomely dressed, as he should
have been, for in their captivities they contracted much corruption, as in
Egypt they forgot their Circumcision, and that was called opprobrium Eg^pti,
Josh. 5. Under Antiochus attrahebant praeputium, for fear they drew the skin
of their prepuce that they might not be known to be Jews, The Israelits
learn corruption in the captivity.
and the Apostle alludes to this, Circumcisus es? noli attrahere praputium, 1
Cor. 7.18. And when they were in Babylon they married strange women; and no
mervaile that his clothes were now soiled and foul when he was lately come
out of the captivity; a man that is newly risen out of the ague, no mervaile
that his color be not good, and if he be weak and fall, we excuse him.

Contracted wants what.
Thirdly, there are contracted wants; and these are not excusable; if a man
should drink until he were drunk, and then stagger and fall, no man will
excuse him, as they do him who falls through sickness; the Lord that
excuses Joshua here for his occasional want, he will not excuse Vrijah the
Highpriest when he brings the pattern of the Altar of Damascus to Jerusalem, 2
King. 18.11. This is a contracted guilt, and not occasional; when our
forefathers came out of popery first, no mervaile that there were great wants
amongst them, and that they savoured of the dregs of Rome; but now when we
have lived so long out of popery, and yet desire to be back again to Egypt,
what a shame is that, the Lord will not be beholden to idolatrous Egypt to
borrow any thing from her: Christ stands here for the occasional wants of the
Highpriest, but not for the contracted wants; our fathers lived in constituenda
ecclesia, and we live in constituta ecclesia, and that which was tolerable in
them, may be abomination in us: God accepted of their little knowledge but he
craves a greater measure of knowledge of us, because we live in the sun shine
of the day.

And he answered and spoke to them that stood before him, saying, take away
these filthy Garments.

And he answered, that is, To answer is to begin to speak.
he began to speak according to the manner of the Hebrews, for no speech
passed betwixt him and the Angels before.

Thomas marketh well that Christ speaks after one manner to the Angels, and
the Angels speak another way to Christ; for when Christ speaks to them, he is
sicut agens illuminans and revelans: but when the Angel speaks to Christ, he
is Velut passum, admirans, consulens, and accipiens revelationem ab eo.

And he spoke to those that stood before him.

That is, ministered unto him. The Angels serve Christ's but attend us.
The Angels are ministering spirits to serve Christ, but they are ministering
spirits to attend us, as a Nurse does her young infant, they attend not Christ
to defend and protect him in danger, for he is their head; they only Minister
to him: therefore when the devil cited the Psalm to Christ, Cast thy self
down, for he has given his Angels charge to keep thee, this place was
falsely cited two ways by Satan, First, he leaves out in all thy ways,
Secondly, he applied it falsely to Christ, they shall keep thee, this part
only belonged to Christus mysticus, to Christ's members, they keep Christ's
members in all their ways, but they keep not Christ himself; Christ has
procured this their ministry to us, and he is that Ladder, up which they go
up and down to serve us, Gen 28.12.

Take away the filthy garments from him.

It may be asked here, Joshua's filthy garments; seeing they have no hand in
our justification or sanctification: Christ the mediator justifies us, and the
holy spirit sanctifies us.

God speaks oftentimes after the manner of men.
This is but spoken humanitus, after the manner of men, for as men cause their
servants to take away the foul clothes off the person, which is to be brought
before them, and put new apparel upon him, as Joseph was brought before
Pharao; so does the Lord speak hear after the manner of men.

Some parts of Prophesies and visions are not to be expounded literally.
Those parts of visions and Prophecies which seem contrary to other parts of
Scripture, we are not to expound them literally; but we are to hold that they
were only done in vision. Example, Jeremiah is commanded to carry his girdle
to Babel, and there to hide it beside Euphrates, Iere. 13.4. these words we
cannot expound them literally, but in vision for Jeremiah was never yet in
Babel. So we are not to expound the Prophecy literally, when it is contrary to
piety, but only in vision as when Hosea is bidden marry a whore, Hos. 1.2.
This was only in vision; Thirdly, when they are contrary either to decency or
good manners, as when Ezekiel is bidden go naked, and to eat his bread baken
with man's doung, Ezekiel. 4.12, so we are not to take this vision literally, that
the Angel did any thing in our sanctification or justification. In the parable
of the rich glutton he desired that Abraham would send Lazarus, that he might
dip his finger, and put it upon his tongue; in heaven the glorified souls have
no fingers as yet, nor in hell the damned have no tongues yet; but because we
cannot conceive spiritual things but by bodily things, therefore it is
expressed after this manner; So every knee in heaven and earth shall how, Phil.
2.10. there are no knees in heaven as yet to bow to Christ, but this is spoken
to our capacity, for when we would do homage here below, we bow the knee; so
heavenly worship is here figured by earthly gesture. And to him he said, behold
I have caused thine inquity to pass from thee, and I will cloth thee with
change of raiment:

Pardoning of sin here is expressed by putting off foul clothes, and
putting on a new garment.

The Lord delights to see his Priests clothed in holiness, Psalm. 122.16. and
to put on righteousness as a garment, Job. 29.14. (...) Sacerdos. (...)
sponsus.
and the Hebrews observe that Cohen a Priest, and Cahan a Bridgroome come both
from one root, because the Priest when he comes before the Lord, should be
adorned like the bridgroome; the Apostle says, That as many as were baptized
into Christ, have put on Christ; Galat. 3.27. which is a speech borrowed from
the custom used in the primitive Church; for those who were Adulti or come to
age, The custom in the Primitive Church, when they baptized those that were
come to age.
when they were to be baptized, came to the Church the Sunday before the
Pascha, and put upon them white clothes, therefore the day was called Dominica
in albis, and they were called candidati; if white clothes and holiness
becomes every Christian, when he enters into Christianity, how much more
should Preachers study to put on righteousness when they enter to this holy
calling; but many now dare be bold to come in before the Lord with their
soiled, and filthy clothes, as if they had lain amongst the pots of Egypt.
Four sorts of Garments unbeseeming a Minister.


Secondly, some come in, and they have not these mutatorius vestes, changed
apparel, but they had rather superindui, to put one some show of holiness
above, but not to lay aside their old sins. They make the outside of the
platter clean, but within it is full of uncleanness, Matthew. 23, 25.

Thirdly, others come in with their garment of Linsey-Woolsey before the Lord,
ye shall not know of what profession they are, like Sceptikes doubting of all
things, now standing for popery, now for the truth, now broching this heresy,
now that.

Fourthly, some come in before the Lord with their woollen clothes, the Lord by
Ezekiel, cap. 44. commands expressly that the Priests should wear no wool
in the sanctuary but linen, and out of the sanctuary when they were about
their secular affairs no linen but wool, and therefore the Jews proverb was
when they saw a worldly minded Priest, they said, there goes the man with the
woollen clothes; Ministers, of all men, should study to have their clothes
clean, and see that their garments be not spotted with the flesh, Iud. 23.
Great purity required in Ministers.
It was a great change in Israel, when the Nazarits who were purer then snow,
whiter then milk, more ruddy in body then rubies; when they became blacker
then a coal, Lamen. 4.7. So now it is a great change, when Ministers whose
Garments should be pure and holy, shining as the wings of a dove covered with
silver, and like her feathers covered with yeallow gold, come in as though they
had lien among the pots, Psalm. 68.13. Many now that should come in Candidati
before the Lord, are fettered and entangled with the affairs of the world, yea
they come in Loadened with thick clay, Habak. cha. 2.6. having greater care to
heap up gold then to gather grace to uphold them in the day of their trial;
when Satan shall accuse them, for being clothed with filthy garments, as he
did Joshua the Highpriest here.

And I will cloathe thee with change of raiment.

Joshua's sins being pardoned already, how is his sin pardoned anew again?

Joshua had his total justification before; but this was his partial
justification; Iustificate totalis partialis.

God pardoned him those sins which hindered him in his Priestly office: an
example, not unlike unto this we have, Esaias 6.7. When the Seraphim came with a
coal and touched the lips of Esaias, this was his partial justification when
he pardoned him those sins which hindered him in his calling, Esaias 6.

But ye will say; simul and semel.

Although all sins both by past and to come are remitted to the child of God
in Gods eternal counsel, Whether we get remission of all our sins simul et
semel.
yet the sins not yet committed, when they are committed; and repented of in
our sense and feeling, then they are pardoned when we feel them to be
pardoned, Peccata praeterita remittuntur per formalem applicationem (as they
speak in the Schools) futura vero virtualiter tantum; praeterita insese,
futura in subjecto vel persona peccante.

And I said, let them set a fair crown upon his head.

God never begins a work but he perfecteth it; God never begins a work
but that which he perfecteth.
this we see in the work of creation. God rested not until he had finished
all his works, so in the work of his providence, Psalm. 65.11. Thou crownest
the year with thy goodness. Thirdly, in the work of redemption, Christ left
not off this work till he said consummatum est. Fourthly, in the work of
sanctification, Phil. 3.6. He that has begun a good work in you will perform
it until the day of Jesus Christ. The Lord brings to perfecton every good
work begun in us, he is not like the man in the Gospel; who began to build a
house, but was not able to finish it.

This is a great comfort to the children of God, who find many impediments in
the work of their sanctification; the child of God says sometimes with
Rebecka, Genesis 25.22. It had been better for me, The comforts of the children of
God.
never to have conceived; he feels the flesh striving against the spirit, as
Jacob and Esau in their mothers belly, and sometime he feels the messenger of
Satan buffetting him, and hanging so fast on, and fettering him by the way,
that in his own sense and feeling, he thinks this work will never be
finished, but yet he may take heart to him in this, as God brought home Joshua
out of the captivity, clothed him with change of apparel, and lastly, put the
crown upon his head; so shall the Lord finish that good work which he has
begun in us, Philip. 1.6.

The difference betwixt the Kings Crown and the Priests. (...) corona regis.
They put a Crown upon his head.

The Kings Crown differed from the Priests crown; First in name, the Kings
Crown was called, Gnaterah, the Priests was called Mitznephath; Secondly, in
the matter, the Kings Crown was of pure gold; the Priests was fascia, (...)
cidaris vel corona sacerdotis, Exodus 28.4.
of silk mixed with gold, and it was called tiara. Thirdly, they differed in
the form; and lastly, in the use, the Kings Crown was typical, and civil
also for government in things civil; the Priests was only typical. Secondly,
the things that were joined with the Priests Crown were more vive types of
Christ, then the Kings Crown was; for his Bells typed Christ's prophetical
office, his white garments his Priestly office, and the Crown his Kingly
office; he was a more vive representation of Christ, than the King was.

And they put a Crown upon his head.

There are three sorts of crowns; first, the crown of profession, Three sorts
of crowns.
common to all Christians, Revelat. 3.11. Hold fast that thou have, let no man
take thy Crown. Secondly, a ministerial crown which belongs to faithful
Pastors, Phil. 4.1. Therefore my brethren, my joy and crown. So 1 Thessalonians. 2.19.
And thirdly, the Crown of glory, 1 Pet. 5.4. The crown of the Pastor, is his
people converted by him, Prove 17.6. Childrens children are the crown of old
men, [Gnatereth] corona, comes from [Gnatur] cingere, 1 Samuel 24.23. When Saul
and his men environed David, then they are said [Gnatar] cingere; when the
Grandfather has his childrens children compassing him about, what a crown is
that for him? so a Ministers crown shall be this, Simile.
when his people converted by him, stands about him like a crown; The Priest
under the Law in the time of his days, laid aside his crown, Ezekiel. 24.17. and
in time of joy and gladness, put it on again. Many now a grief may lay aside
their crown, and trample it upon the ground, for grief that they have been so
negligent in their Calling. What joy can a man have when he remembers his
great negligence in his ministry, and sloth in the Lords business? he should
not be so negligent if he would always remember that last crown of glory
which the chief Shepherd shall give, 1 Pet. 5.4. A crown that fades not
away, The crowns below here, wherewith men were crowned, were made of grass,
of Laurel trees, of linen, of wool, and the best of them but of gold, which
all are fading crowns, but this crown is (...), (...), immarcessibilis,
nunquam marcescens; item flos quidam sic dictus quod non marcescat, sed
decerptus asservetur, and cum cuncti flores defecere, madefactus aqua,
reviviscat, Plinius lib. 2. cap. 11.
an incorruptible and durable crown that cannot fade nor vanish away.

So they set a Mitre upon his head, or a crown upon his head. After that
Joshua, by the assistance of the Angel, had resisted Satan, given him the
foil, and had gotten the victory, the Lord in sign of this victory, and to
confirm Joshua in the Priesthood, after he returned from the captivity,
sets a crown upon his head.

This is a great comfort to all Christians, but chiefly to faithful Ministers,
that although they suffer persecution, be carried, as it were, into captivity,
accused by Satan and the wicked in the world, yet if they constantly stand out
and resist Satan, and stop the mouths of those wicked instruments of his, by
their good life and holy conversation, they may be assured the Lord will give
them a crown, even the Crown of life, Revel. 2.10. Fear none of those things
which thou shall suffer; behold the Devil shall cast some of you into prison,
that ye may be tried, and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou
faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a Crown of life.

Of the eating of holy things.
Levit. 22.10. There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a so^ourner of
the Priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing: But if the
Priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, etc.
THe LORD made a twofold distinction of meats under the Law. First, of clean
and unclean meats, and that is taken away now; for to the clean all things
are clean, Titus. 1.15. The Hebrews call that which is unclean [Piggul] a
polluted thing, that is, (...) Abhominatio res abhominanda, proprie dicitur de
carne faetoris and coloris tetri.
a thing that is eaten after the time; and Aquila translateth it (...), that
is, a thing to be rejected or refused; And the Apostle uses the same word when
he is speaking of meats, that nothing is (...), to be refused, if it be
received with thankesgiving, 1 Timothy 4.4.

The second distinction of meats was this, some were clean by the Law, but
yet if they were eaten by persons who had no right to eat them, then they were
unclean to them; Thirdly, if they eat them not in the appointed place; and
fourthly, if they eat them not in due time.

First, somethings the Priests might eat and their sons, but not their
daughters, Number. 18.9.

Here we must mark a difference betwixt the legal promises, and the
spiritual promises; the legal promise is, the Priests and his sons shall
eat of it, but not their daughters; but the spiritual promises are made to
them and to their children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as
the Lord our God shall call, Acts chapter 2. verse 39.

The difference betwixt the legal promises, and Evangelicall promises.
Secondly, the legal promise was made to the Priests and their sons, but not
to their daughters; but in the spiritual promises there is no difference
betwixt male and female Galat. 3.18.

There were other things that their daughters might eat of, as well as their
sons, and the servant that was bought with money, or borne in the house, and
the Priests daughter who was a Widow, or divorced, and returned to her father
again, having no children, all these might eat of the less holy things, Lev.
22.11, 12

A difference betwixt the moral and ceremonial Law.
Observe first a difference betwixt the moral Law and the ceremonial; the
moral Law puts no difference in the worship of God betwixt the son, the
daughter, the manservant, nor the maidservant, nor the stranger, Exodus 22.10.
but the ceremonial Law allows the Priest to eat, his son to eat, his
daughter to eat, his servant bought with his money to eat, and his servant
borne in the house to eat, but not the stranger, Levit. 22.10, 11, 12.

Why the servant borne within the house and bought with the money, might eat
the holy things.
Again, the servant that was bought with his money, and he that was borne in the
house might eat, to signify unto us, that they who are borne within the
covenant, and they who are bought with the price of Christ's blood, although
strangers before, are partakers of Christ's sacrifice; but these who are
strangers still, are not partakers of his holy body. The Priests daughter when
she returned home to her father again, might eat of these less holy things;
so we being married to the law, and it having dominion over us, Romans 7, 1. we
were out of our fathers house, and might not eat of this holy bread; but being
dead to the law, Romans 7.4. and divorced from our sins, as Widows, we may
come home to our fathers house, and be partakers of the holy things.

Secondly, What things the Priest and his sons might eat.
what things the Priest and his sons might eat; that which was ignitum
Iehovae, the sacrifice which was burnt to the Lord by fire, as the sin
offering and the Trespass offering, the Priest and his sons might eat of
them, but not his daughters; so the Shewbread, Levit. 24.9. and it (the
Shewbread) shall be Aarons and his sons, and they shall eat it in the holy
place; for it is most holy unto him, of the offerings of the Lord made by fire.

The Priest and his sons might only eat of the Shewbread, but not his
daughters, but in necessity others might eat of it as well as the Priest and
his sons, as David and his men in necessity eat of it, 1 Samuel 21.6. if they
might eat of it in necessity, much more might the Priests wife and his
daughter in their necessity eat of it.

When the Priest asked David whether his men were clean or not, that they
might eat of the Shewbread;

If it had been in extreme necessity,

The Jews have a rule, A rule of the Jews.
where thou find a command to do a thing, and a prohibition to forbid a
thing, and they both cannot be kept, then thou must leave the negative and
fellow the affirmative. Example, a Nazarite is forbidden to shave his hair,
and the Leper is commanded to shave his hair. Now when a Nazarite becomes a
Leper, which of these two shall he follow; he shall leave the negative precept
which commanded him, not to shave his hair, and he shall follow the
affirmative, and shall shave his hair. So the Priest is forbidden to give his
daughter any of the Shewbread, again he is commanded to provide for his
family, now his daughter is like to sterve for hunger, which of those two shall
he follow; he is to follow the affirmative here, and to leave the negative. So
in the Sabbath, etc.

The Place where they eat the holy things.
Thirdly, the place where they were to eat the holy things: some things they
were to eat by the Altar, that is, in the Chambers of the Priests hard by the
Altar, some they were to eat in Jerusalem, and some they were to eat in any
part of Canaan.

Some things they were to eat in the Chambers nere the Altar, Ezekiel. 42.14,
those things in Levit. 10.12. they are said to eat at the Altar.

When Ezekiel describes the Temple here, he means the Temple under Christ,
and the maintenance of the ministry under the Gospel, as the Priests who
served at the Altar under the law, eat of the rest of the sacrifice in their
Chambers: so the ministers under the Gospel should be maintained now. 1 Cor.
9.13.

Secondly, the less holy things they eat them in Jerusalem, the Paschall
Lamb was eaten within Jerusalem, and not in the Temple, therefore it was of
those less holy things.



Why the Passover was reckoned a less holy thing.
It was reckoned amongst the less holy things, because there was little of it
burnt, but it was eaten by the people. Secondly, it could not be eaten as a
Sacrament in the Temple, for the distinction of the families, that must eat it
severally, they all could not eat it in the Temple. So the first Tithe was but
a common holy thing, or less holy, and it might be eaten any where, but the
second tithe was the more holy tithe, and therefore behoved to be eaten in the
Temple before the Lord.

Lastly, when they might eat it.

Somethings they were bound to eat the self same day that the things were
offered, When they were to eat the holy things.
as the flesh of the sacrifice of the peaceoffering, Levit. 7.15. some things
might be eaten that same day that they were offered, or upon the morrow, as the
sacrifice of the vow, or a freewill offering, Levit. 7.16. But they might eat
none of the flesh of the Sacrifice upon the third day after it was offered, but
it was to be burnt with fire, Levit. 7.17, 18.

Now time, place, distinction of persons, No meat of it self unclean.
and distinctions of meats are all taken away, and it enters not in at the
mouth which defiles a man, but that which comes out of the mouth defiles
him, Matthew. 15.11. there is no meat now, that is unclean in it self, but it
becomes unclean to them that receive it not with pure hearts, Tit. 1.15.
Unto the pure, all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and
unbelieving, is nothing pure; but even their mind, and conscience is defiled,
and every creature of God is good, if it be received with thanksgiving. 1 Timothy
4 4.

Of pollution by the dead.
Number. 29.11. He that touches the dead body of any man, shall be unclean seven
days.
THe pollution of man above other creatures, Man more unclean than any other
creature.
shows the effects of sin which causes death, Romans 6.23. He that touched
a dead beast was but unclean until the even, Levit. 11.24. but he that
touched a dead man, was unclean for seven days. So he that touthe grave or
the bones of a dead man was unclean, and therefore they were commanded to bury
the bones of the dead, when they found them in the way. Ezekiel. 39.15. And the
passengers that pass through the land, when any sees a man's bone, then shall
he set up a sign by it, till the buriers come and bury it. This signified such
as were dead in trespasses and sins, Ephesians. 2.1. and such as have their
consciences defiled by dead works, Heb. 9.13.14. those are unclean.

What the legal pollutions taught the Jews.
And those legal pollutions taught the people of God how careful they should
be that they defile not themselves with sin, or communion with dead and
sinful works as the Apostle says, touch no unclean thing, 2 Cor. 6.17.
and be not partakers of other men's sins, keep thy self pure, 1 Timothy 5.22.

The Jews add to many of the Laws of God.
Whosoever touches one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, shall
be unclean seven days, Number. 19.16. And the Jews add, he that touches the
sword which killed the man, shall be unclean; but this is an addition of their
own. So the Lord commanded that the Nazarit should drink no wine, and they
add, nor come nere unto a Vineyard. So the Lord commanded that they should not
carry burdens upon the Sabbath, Iere. 17. but they added, that it was not
lawful for a sick man to take up his bed upon the Sabbath. Ioh. 5. So the Lord
commanded that they should go no further but a Sabbath days journey upon the
Sabbath, but they added that it was not lawful to stir out of the place upon
the Sabbath. So the Lord commanded them that they should abstain from the
drink offerings of the heathen; but they added that they should abstain from
the wine of the Gentiles. So here the Lord says that Whosoever touches one
that is slain with a sword, shall be unclean until the even. But they add,
whosoever shall touch the sword which killed the man, shall be unclean until
the even.

The touching of the bodies of the dead shows us what unregenerate men are in
the sight of God, they are dead while they are alive. 1 Timothy 5.6. they are like
rotten graves, their throat is an open sepulcher, Romans 3.13. and they are like
whited Sepulchers which indeed appear beutifull outwardly, but within are full
of dead men's bones, and all uncleanness, Matthew. 23.27.

What are we to think of the bodies of the Saints, corpora pura, or impura?

They are neither corpora pura, nor impura, Whether the dead bodies of the
Saints in the grave be pure or not.
sed non pura; they are not impura, because their sins are pardoned; they are
not pura, because they are as yet under the corruption and punishment of sin,
but the wicked, who lie down with their sins in the dust, their bodies are
impura, filthy and unclean.

The bodies of the Saints being not impura, therefore the souls of the
glorified might come to such bodies again, as Moses in the transfiguration was
there in soul and body, his glorified soul came to his body again, because
it was not a sinful body now, but a body lyeing under corruption as yet, but
when Lazarus soul returned to his body, we must not think that Lazarus soul
was a glorified soul (for a glorified soul returns not to a sinful body to
dwell in it again) but the vinon betwixt the soul and the body was loosed at
this time, A difference betwixt the glorified souls, and sinful souls,
enio^ning into their bodies again, Sumus de purgatory.
and the soul was still in the sinful body, tanquam in sede, non tanquam in
organo, that is, it was still in the body, although it did not animate the body.



irregularitas here, sed non peccatum, for for there is not a sin where there
is not a law forbidding it, In what case the Jews sinned when they touched a
dead body.
for sin is the transgressing of the Law. The Lord says not, ye shall not
touch the dead, but he says, he that touches the dead shall be unclean
until the even, Then there is a Commandment added, that a clean person shall
sprinkle him with water upon the third day, and upon the seventh, Number. 19.19.
So that although he be not commanded, not to touch the dead, yet if he have
touched the dead, he is commanded to wash himself. So there is not a
Commandment forbidding a man to touch a Leper, but if he had touched a Leper
there was a Commandment given that he should not enter into the congregation
until he was purifieth, and if he did enter before he was purifieth, he
transgressed the Commandment and sinned.

The comforts in Death.
Eccles. 7.1 Better is the day of death than the day of ones birth.
IN the former part of this verse, the Preacher shows, The co^^^sion of the
words.
that a good name is better than precious ointment, and then he subjoyneth,
better is the day of death, than the day of ones birth, as if he should say, a
man's good name and his report is better known after his death, than when he is
alive, and then his good name smells like the Wine of Lebanon, which in his
life time may be many ways blotted.

He prefers the day of our death to the day of our birth, and he says,
that the day of our death is better.

A thing is said to be [better] sundry ways, One thing is said to be better
then an other sundry ways.
first it may be better in it self; but not to the person; so it is said, that
it had been better that Judas had never been borne, it made more for the
glory of God that Judas was borne, but it was not better for himself.

Secondly, things are said to be better, when they seem to be better to a
carnal and corrupt man, as he says, that a living dog is better than a dead
Lion, Eccles. 9.4. that is, he had rather live in a base estate here, than to
be in best account amongst the dead.

Thirdly, some things are better for this present estate and condition of life
than others, as better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled Ox
and hatred therewith, Prove. 15.17.

Fourthly, some things are better for a man in the state of grace, and for his
soul, as it is better to be a door keeper in the house of God, than to dwell
in the tents of wicked men, One thing is said to be better then another
comparatively.
Psalm. 84.1. So it is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house
of feasting; and, sorrow is better than laughter, Eccles. 7.2, 3. So, the day
of a man's death, is better than the day of his birth.

Next, let us consider, why the day of death is better than the day of ones
birth; because, man is borne unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward, Job 5.7.
but the day of his death, is the end of all his miseries, and therefore is
properly called, man's day, Job 18.20. The day of a man's death is better then
the day of his birth, Luc. 2.29. Now let thou thy servant depart in peace,
1 Samuel 28.15. Why have thou troubled me? Job 3.13. For now should I have lien
still and been quiet, I should have slept; then should I have been at rest.
The Council of Toledo marketh that Christ wept not at Lazarus death, but at
his resurrection; and this should teach us to moderate our grief when our
friends dye, and those whom we love best, If ye love me, says Christ, ye will
rejoice, because I go to my father, Ioh. 14.28. So we should rejoice when we
see our friends go to our Father, and count the day of their death better then
the day of their birth.

The day of death is worse to the wicked.
The day of a man's death, is better than the day of his birth, to the children
of God it is better, but to the wicked, it is much worse; the child of God
says in his death, as Christ said, consummatum est, then all tears are wipt
from their eyes; but to the wicked, it is their worst day, as the child of God
says, consummatum est, so they say, inchoatum est, Luc. 16.25. Remember that
thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus his evil things,
but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. Death is worse to the wicked
man, therefore his death is called, the death of the uncircumcised, Ezekiel.
28.12. and he dies as a fool, 2 Samuel 3.33. but the children of God die in the
Lord, and their death is their rest.

It may seem, that to be borne is better than death, Ioh, 16.20. A woman when
she is in travel, has sorrow, because her hour is come, but as soon as she
is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a
man is borne into the world. She rejoices that she has brought forth a Son,
but we rejoice not when one dies, therefore it may seem that the day of ones
birth is better then the day of his death.

It is better for the woman that she has a child borne for the continuation of
her posterity,

In what case may a man choose death rather then life?

We may chiefly choose death rather then life only to be rid of sin, as
Paul desired, to depart and to be with Christ. Phil. 1.23. but this was only
to be delivered from the body of sin; to prevent sin, it is better not to
be, than to be, Eccles. 4.3. for he has not seen the evil work which is
done under the Sun: Again, it is better for reprobates that they had never
been because of their damnation, as it is said of Judas, It had been better
for him that he had never been borne. Matthew. 26.21. and it is better to be
dead then living, that a man may be freed of sin. There is esse Physicum and
esse morale; it is better for a wicked man to be, than not to be, ratione
Physica; because he comes nearer to God who has his being of himself; but
it is worse to him, quoad esse morale, and magis optandum non esse, cum
carentia poena, quam esse cum poena, that is, it is better for him not to be,
and without punishment, than to be, and be punished eternally. There is in man
instinct, reason, and faith; instinct teaches him only to seek the
preservation of his body; reason goes somewhat higher, and has some respect
to virtue and honor, but yet it is not a right guide to man here, when he
wishes to be dead for fear of shame and such worldly inconvenients; Stoici ne
foedetur virtus, and Romani ob inanem gloriam mortem optarunt.
but faith sees farther, and wishes this dissolution, because it knows that
the body and the soul shall be joined together again after they are separated
and purified from sin. A man must not wish death, or the grave although, he
be bitter in soul, Job. 3.20. and afflictions be upon him, but only for sin.

If it be said, death destroys the substance of man, but sin destroys
only an accident in man?

A building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 2
Cor. 5.1.

Observe that men look diversely upon death. First, as it is an enemy to
nature, and so all men abhor it. And the natural man in this respect calls
it a bitter death, 1 Samuel 15.3. Hagag said, Surely the bitterness of death is
past. Secondly, some look upon it as the wages of sin, Romans 6.32. then it is
a more bitter death, and thirdly, some look upon it as a passage to life, and
then it is to be wished, but not for it self, but for another end, as when a
sick man desires a bitter potion for his healths sake; for no evil of
punishment is to be desired for it self.

There are two periods set down here, our birth, and our death, and not our
life. It is the manner of the spirit of God in the Scriptures to set down the
two extremes, and to leave out the midst, as Psalm. 21.8. the Lord shall keep
thy going in, and going out, that is all thy ways, so Exodus 8.11.5. And all
the first borne of the land of Egypt shall dye from the first borne of Pharaoh
that fitteth upon the throne, unto the first borne of the Maidservant, that
sits behind the Mill, here the rest of the people are left out for
shortness, and the two extremes are expressed, so Number. 6.4. from the kernel
to the husk, here the wine which is the midst is left out, so Job. 24.20. The
womb shall forget him, and the worms shall feed sweetly upon him, here the
birth and the grave include the whole life. So here are set down our birth and
our death our two graves, the grave out of which we come and the grave unto
which we go; Job joyneth these two together, Naked came I out of my Mothers
womb, and naked shall I return thither, Job. 1.21. he was not to return
back to his Mothers womb again, but he was to return back to the grave
again the second womb, and Christ joyneth the belly and the grave, Matthew.
1^.4. For as Jonas was three days and three night, in the Whales belly. So
shall the some of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth, hence it is that the inferior parts of the earth are both called the
Mothers womb, and the grave, Psalm. 139.15. My substance was curiously wrought
in the lowest parts of the earth, that is in my Mothers womb, and as no man
hates the belly that conceived and bred him; so no man should hate the grave
which is his second mother.

He marketh the two extremes here the birth and the death, and passes by our
life, to teach us the shortness of our life, the Scripture describes the
shortness of man's life sundry ways? First, he calls our days anni numeri,
that is, which may be easily numbered, Job. 16.22. when a few years are come
(years of number) than I shall go the way, whence I shall not return, so dies
numeri signify a few days, Number. 19.20, so homines numeri, a few men, Deuteronomy.
4.27. So Ezekiel. 12.16. and Esaias. 10.19. The rest of the trees of his forest
shall be number, that a child may write them, that is, they shall be few, and
here Job says, When years of number are come, that is, a few years that may
be easily numbered, to note the shortness of his days. Secondly, our life is
called saeculum, Psalm. 17.14. Thirdly, our years are reduced to three score
and ten, and if by reason of strength, they be fourscore, yet is their
strength labor and sorrow, for it is soon cut off, and we fly away; if a man
out live threescore and ten, he pays interest for those years, much sorrow
and grief.

Then our years are compared to the days of an hireling, Job. 7.1. which was
a short time, the years of an hirling were but three years, and the Lord to
show the sudden destruction that should come upon Moah, he says, Esaias.
16.14. Within three years, as the years of an hirling, and the glory of Moab
shall be contemned, that is, it shall shortly be contemned, so Job says, his
days are like the days of an hireling, that is, they are very short. They are
compared to months, Job. 14.5. the number of his months are with thee. Then
they are compared to days, and to an artificial day from the sunnerising, to
the setting of the Sun, they are like grass which grows up, in the evening
it is cut down and whitereth, Ps. 90.6. and to a watch in the night, which was
but three or four hours, verse. 4. then they are compared to an hour, then to
a moment, and last to nothing, Psalm. 39.5.

So our years for the shortness of them are compared to a post, Job. 25. Now
my days are swifter than a post, they flyaway and see no good, they are passed
away as the swift ships, as the Eagle that hasteneth to her pray, Mark the
gradation here. First, Job compares his days, to a post, a post goes on in
his journey very swiftly, when one horse wearieth he will take another, and so
goes on; but yet he must rest sometimes: Therefore he goes further and
compares them to the swiftest ships, that are called ships of desire, the ship
will not weary day nor night, yet there may come a contrary wind and make her
stay; therefore he goes higher, and he compares his days to the Eagle, which
of all fowls is the swiftest to catch pray, and nothing can stay her until
she have obtained it. So man's days wearies not, nothing can stay them in their
course, but they fly away, and hasten to their end.

So man's life is compared to the weavers shitle, Job. 7.6. this comparison
would be marked, for the shuttle carries the thread within it, and the weaver
tosseth the shuttle too and fro until the thread be spent, and then he cuteth
it off. So time is the weaver that tosseth the shuttle, and our days are as
the thread within the shuttle, which piece and piece are spent, and then death
cutteth them off. So they are compared to a smoke and to a dream, or to a
vapor, Psalm. 49. or to the breath of ones mouth, and to this the Apostle has
reference, when he says, what is your life? it is even a vapor that appears
for a little time, and then vanishes away, Iam. 4.4,

Now that our death may be comfortable unto us; first, we must remember that we
are mortal, Genesis 2.17. In that day that thou eatest thereof, thou shall dye
the death, Symachus translateth it, Mortalis eris, the consideration of
mortality in Abraham, made him to say that he was but dust and ashes, Genesis
78.27. It is appointed unto men once to dye, but after this the judgment, Heb.
9.17. If men dyed not, they could not obtain life eternal, for flesh and
blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither does corruption inherit
incorruption, therefore we must either die, or be changed; And this corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality, and then we
need not to be afraid of death, for it shall be swallowed up in victory, 1 Cor.
15.50. as the Wise man says, Ecclus 14.12. Remember that death is not long in
coming, and that the covenant of the Grave is not showed unto thee; The Lord
shows unto us that we are all mortal, and that we must dye, but he shows
not in particular the time when we shall dye, and therefore we should be ready
at all times.

Secondly, remember the advertisements of death, when thou art faint and weary,
those are Gentlemen Vshers to death, when ye feel those messengers, remember
that the sound of their Masters feet is behind them, (...) cincinni, sic dicti
quod facile mutantur a (...) mutabit.
2 King. 6.32. We are called in the Scriptures, [bene hhaloph] Prove, 31.8.
Children of change; and the locks of our hair are called [mahhaliphoth]
mutationes Judge 16.13. because they are soon changed, when our hair begins
to change once, that is an advertisement to death, as the wise man says; but
many men take no notice of those advertisements, when a Sergeant comes to
arrest a man, the man absenteth himself, and will not seem to be at home; yet
notwithstanding the arrestment is valide, and holds good in the Law: so those
advertisements of death, although thou neglect them, and seem not to be at
home, yet the arrestment shall hold good, and thou shall be enforced to answer
at the day appointed.

Thirdly, look upon the death of others, for that he looks seriously upon
the death of others, he cannot choose but that he must remember his mortality, 2 Samuel 20.12. When Amasa was wallowing in his blood, all the people stood still
and looked upon him; when people behold the death of others, then it should put
them in mind of their own death.

Fourthly, acquaint thy self often with death, that it seem not a stranger to
thee when it comes, Hierome set the skull of a dead man before him daily, and
the Anchorites of old scraped with their nails some part of their own grave
every day; Put not the evil day far from thee, Esaias 22.12. When the Lord
called the Jews to mourning, yet they put the evil day far from them, and
they said, Let us eat, let us drink, for tomorrow we shall die, 1 Cor.
15.32. Many men live now as though they should never dye, they make a covenant
with death, as the Prophet says Esaias 28.16. We have made a covenant with
death, and with hell are we at agreement. But they are deceived, death is
unmercifull, it will make a league with no man, this league is made only in the
imagination of their own hearts.

Fifthly, consider the comforts which we have against the grave, it is very
terrible in it self, it is called a pit, Esa 38.18. darkness and the Land of
oblivion, Psalm. 88.13. The shadow of death, Job, 10.21. corruption and
destruction, and for the power of it, it is said to have gates and doors, Job
38.13. and a soul, Esaias 5.14. (...) dilatat sepulchrum animam suam.
[Hirhhibbah sheol naphshah] the grave has enlarged her soul; so to have
hands Psalm. 49.16 and 89.49. so to have a mouth, Ps. 141.7, so a sting 1 Cor.
15.55. all those Epithites are to show how terrible and fearful it is to a
wicked impenitent sinner who lies down in it with his sins upon him, but to
the godly it is (...), a sleeping place; it is a place that all men, yea even
the best must come into, Jacob made account to go thither Genesis 37.35. and Job
desired to be there; O that thou would hide me in the grave, Job 14.13.
Because he knew that it was his house, Job. 17.13. Yea Christ himself was
there, and sanctified it, first he bought the grave, the price of him that was
valued, after that Judas had cast it back again, was given for a potters
field, for the burial of strangers, this is the first right which gentiles
have to the grave, because Christ purchased it unto them. Again Christ was
buried in Golgotha where his blood ran down upon the graves of the dead that
were buried there. Thirdly, he has lain down in it, and whereas it was
loathsome before, now he has persumed it, so that we may safely lie down in
that bed in which his blessed body lay; and lastly he has the key of the
grave, to open it when he pleases so that it has no power to keep us.
Revela. 1.18. I have the keys of hell and of death, this is a singular comfort
to us then who are the Children of God, so that we may say better is the day of
our death than the day of our birth.

Sixthly; we should remember that our dead bodies are within the covenant, and
the Lord forgets them not: When Jacob went down to Egypt the Lord promised
to bring him back again, Genesis 46.4. but how did the Lord bring him back
again, seeing he dyed in Egypt? The Lord was with him when his bones were
brought out of Egypt: so the Lord preserves all the bodies of his Saints, and
he keeps all their bones, Psalm. 34.20. yea even when they are in the grave,
because they are within the Covenant, therefore it is called, domus viventium,
the house of the living.

Lastly, that our death may be comfortable unto us, let us remember that it
does not only put an end to our miseries in this life, but it is the entrance
to glory and everlasting happiness, where we shall see the Lord and his
Angels, and abide with them eternally; Moses is renowned unto the worlds end,
because he saw the Lords back parts only; but we shall not only see his
backeparts, but we shall see him as he is, even face to face, 1 John 3.2. 1
Cor. 13.12. The Queen of Sheba heard many things of Solomon, and yet the half
was not told her, but when she saw him face to face, then she said, Happy are
thy men, happy are thy servants that stand continually before thee, 1 King.
10.8. So in this life we hear many things of Christ the true Solomon and his
kingdom, but yet the half are not told us, for the eye has not seen, nor
ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
has prepared for them that love him, 1 Cor. 2.9. But at the day of our death
when our soul shall be separated from our bodies, then we shall see these
things, and shall say with the Queen of Sheba, happy are thy men, happy are
thy servants that stand continually before thee; and blessed are the dead that
die in the Lord, Revel. 14.13. If we consider these things seriously, we shall
be enforced to conclude with Solomon here, better is the day of death, tha^ the
day that one is borne.

FINIS,
AN EXPLICATION OF THE IVDICIALL LAWS OF MOSES.

Plainly discovering diverse of their ancient Rites and Customs.

As in their Governors, Government, Synedrion, Punishments, Civil Accounts,
Contracts, Marriages, Wars, and Burialls.

Also their Oeconomicks, (Vizt.) their dwellings, Feasting, Clothing, and
Husbandry.

Together with two Treatises, the one showing the different estate of the godly
and wicked in this life, and in the life to come.

The other, declaring how the wicked may be enlightened by the preaching of the
Gospel, and yet become worse after they be illuminated.

All which are cleared out of the Original Languages, and do serve as a
special help for the true understanding of diverse difficult Texts of
Scriptures.

Exchange. 1632.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE COLENE, EARL OF SEAFORT, Lord Mackenzee and Kintaill,
one of his MAJESTY'S most Honorable Privy Council in the Kingdom of Scotland.
Honorable and my very good Lord,
GOD who is the God of order and not of confusion, from whom all good things
descend, has placed here below sundry sorts of people; Prove. 30.25.26.27.28
the Ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the Summer;
the Conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the Rocks; the
Locusts have no King, yet go they forth all of them by bands; the Spider
takes hold with her hands, and is in Kings palaces; this sort of people differ
very much, for some of them are (...), which provide only for the present day,
but lay up nothing against the morrow; the Grasshopper provideth not against the
winter as the Ant does; there are others of them who live by rapine, as the
Caterpillars who devour all and then fly away; Nahum 3.16.
and Nahum compares the Merchants of Ninive to these, that carry all the
wealth away with them; and there are some of those people which are insatiable,
as the Horsleach, that has two daughters who cry continually, Prove. 30.15.
Give, give; This sort of people are governed by instinct only; the Locusts
have no King, yet they go out in bands; the Ant has no guide, Prove. 6.7.
overseer, or ruler, yet she provideth her meat in the Summer, and gathers
her food in the harvest, although they have no King or ruler to command them,
and oversee them, neither a guide to direct them, yet they are ruled by
instinct.

There are a second sort of people that God has placed here below, and they
are men; and there is a greater difference amongst this people, than amongst
the former, for look upon some of them, and ye shall hardly discern whether
they be men or not, and as the Philosophers say, there are some sorts of
creatures that we cannot tell whether they live the sensitive or the vegetative
life only, there is so little life in them, as in the Shel-fish; so it is hard
to discern whether those live the reasonable life, or the brutish only, they
have no laws, they lodge in the caves of the earth, go naked, eat raw flesh,
and although they have the shape of men, yet they have but the heart of beasts
in them, as Nebuchadnezzar had. There are other men who are ruled by reason,
and politic government, for their God has taught them, he may be called
their God in this respect, Esaias 28.26.
as the Prophet Esaias calls him the husband-mans God, because he teaches him
how to manure the ground, and so God comes nearer to them; they are a people
here, but yet they are not Gods people, and it is better to be a dorekeeper in
the house of God, Psalm. 84.10.
than in highest advancement amongst such.

There is a third sort who live in his Church, and this is the highest society
in this life, and here we shall see policy, justice, frugalitie, and all
virtues, because Gods worship is here, and as the inferior faculties of the
soul are eminenter by way of excellency contained in the superior, so are all
those comprehended in Religion; and as the shadow follows the body, so does
policy and order follow Religion; if a man would learn frugalitie, let him
look to Joseph, Psalm. 104.22.
who taught the Senators of Egypt; if he would learn policy, let him look
to the government of Salomons Court and his house; 2 King. 4.
if he would learn to be a good warrior, let him see what order the Lord has
placed in the Camp of the Jews; Numb. 80.10.
and if he would learn justice, he shall see it exactly described in the Law
of God.

My Honorable Lord, I have made choice of your LP: to reco^mend this Treatise
to your Patrocinie, because ye know what it is to be amongst Gods people; many
great men if they get their portion in this life amongst the people of this
world, Psalm. 17.
they care not to be Denisons in the society of Gods people, and they content
themselves with the portion of this world, and say, Benum est hic esse; but
this is a freedom which is bought at a higher rate, it cost the chief
Captain a great sum of money to be made a freeman in Rome; Act. 22 28.
but to be made a freeman in the Church of GOD, it cost the price of Christ's
blood. Great men desire to be out of this first society, they desire not to
live like beasts; but if they come to the second society, to live like civil
men, that does content them; they give GOD thanks (perhaps) for this, that
they are men and not beasts, and that they have been bred civilly, but few
give God thanks for this, that they live under the Gospel, where they may
learn Christ, not many Noble are called. 1 Cor. 2.
Sometimes they may tremble and fear, Act. 24.25.
as Felix did, Act 26.28.
and put off their conversion to another time, and some of them are like
Agrippa, who almost are persuaded to be Christians; but few like Sergius
Paulus, Act. 13.7.
who was converted at Paul's preaching.

My Lord, you have had still the practice of Religion in your house, and one of
the best helps to further you, your worthy and religious Lady, whose name
smells now like the wine of Lebanon, when she is gone, Hosea 14.7.
and now she enjoys the fruit of that, when neither her Nobility, birth, or
worldly honor profited nothing; and this I write unto your LP: beseeching you
to go on in that Christian course, that both by your place and example, you
may draw others unto the truth. The Lord promised that he would give the
uttermost parts of the earth for a possession to his Son; Psalm. 2.8.
this is the Motto of this Island, and the farther North, it is the nearer to
the ends of the earth, study therefore my good Lord, that Jesus Christ may
have his possession enlarged in the North, and this shall be your crown in the
latter day, when all your possessions shall fail you.

Your Honors in all dutiful submission, JOHN VVEEMSE:

AN EXPLICATION OF THE IVDICIALL LAWS OF MOSES; As they are annexed to the
Moral and Ceremonial Laws.
Of the Judicial Laws in general.
SOLOMON the Preacher, Eccles 4.12. says, that a threefold Cord is not quickly
broken. The LORD gave his people three sorts of Laws, as three Cords to bind
them, and to keep them in obedience. God gave his Moral, Judicial, and
Ceremonial Law to his people as a threefold Cord.
The first was his moral Law, which was properly called his Law, Deuteronomy. 6.1.
Secondly, he gave them his Ceremonial Laws, which are called his Statutes and
Decrees, Exodus 12.24. And thirdly, his Judgments, which were the Judicial
Laws, Mal. 4.4. Deuteronomy. 24.17.

These Judicial Laws were Determinations of the Moral Law. The Judicial Law
what.


A Determination is either Iuris divini or Humani; these Determinations in
Moses judicial Laws are divini juris; Determinatio Iuris divini. Iuris humani.

therefore they had greater force to bind the Jews, than any municipall Law
has to bind the Subjects now, in respect they were given by God himself, and
these Laws of men which draw nearest to them in equity, are most perfect;
although particularly they cannot be fitted to every Nation, no more than a
shoe of one measure can serve for every foot.

The second sort of Determination is Iuris humani, when men determinate, where
there is no express commandment of God, as concerning circumstances, time,
places, persons, and such. God commands in his law, that they should pay
their first fruits, but he determines not how much they should pay of their
first fruits; then the Priests come in with their humane determination, that
the most shall give no more than one of fifty, and the least shall give no
less than one of sixty. Simile.
When the Israelites were traveling in the Wilderness, they had the Cloud to
direct them by day, and the pillar of fire to direct them by night; yet they
desired Iethro to be eyes to them, Number. 10.31. What need had they of Iethro to
be eyes to them, seeing they had the Cloud by day and the pillar of fire by
night? Iethro was a guide to them, to show them the particular places and ways
in the Wilderness, as the Cloud and the pillar were their guide to direct them
to Canaan. So humane Determinations and Laws, are but guides in particular
circumstances.

A comparison betwixt Humane Laws and Moses Judicial Laws.
Humane Laws they command, they forbid, and sometimes they permit, and lastly
they punish: so ye shall see all these four in Moses Judicial Law. First,
his Judicial Laws do command, but they command the outward man only, (...)
Iguca lex.
and here Moses speaks to them but as a Judge, and they differ from that
fiery Law, the moral Law, that searches and peirceth into the heart, Deuteronomy.
33.2.

Secondly, Humane Laws do prohibit and forbid; so do these Judicial Laws,
and there are more of them which are Negatiues than Affirmatiues, to show us the
perverse nature of man.

Thirdly, Why Moses Judicial Laws permit many things.
Humane Laws give way and permit something for the eschewing of greater evil;
so does Moses Judicial Law, Levit. 27.10. When a man offered a Beast unto the
Lord which he had vowed, he might not change a good for a bad, or a bad for a
good; this was commanded only for eschewing of greater evil; for if it had
been lawful to change once, a good in place of a bad one, then they would
have come quickly to this, to have changed a bad for a good: So this Law
permitted divorcement for the hardness of the peoples hearts, and for the
eschewing of greater inconvenience, least hard-hearted men should have killed
their wives.

Fourthly, The punishments of the Judicial Law alterable.
the punishments inflicted by humane laws are alterable: so were the
punishments in Moses Judicial Law; therefore the Jews say of them, ascendunt
and descendunt, which they understand, not of the greatest and highest
transgressions, but of the middle sort of transgressions, which praecepta
media, their middle Precepts did forbid. Example, Ex. 22. If a man kept a
pushing Ox, knowing that he were wont to push, if he kill a man, then the Law
ordains that the man shall die, or else to redeem himself with a sum of
money; here the Law ascended or descended: but if a man had wilfully killed a
man, that was praeceptum grave, the punishment neither ascended nor descended,
but he was to die the death.

The Scripture compares the moral Law to a prison, Gal. 3.22. the Ceremonial
Law to a second Ward, and these Judicial Laws to a Iailor, to keep the
transgressors in close prison that none of them break out.

CHAPTER I. That Kingly Government is the best Government.
IVDG. 17.6. In those days there was no King in Israel, but every man did that
which was good in his own eyes.
IN government there are five things to be considered; first, potestas;
secondly, ordo; thirdly, modus; fourthly, titulus; and fifthly, vsus.

Five things in Government.
First, there must be a power to exercise government; secondly, order, that some
command and some obey, some to be superiors and some to be inferiors; thirdly,
the manner, whether the government be Monarchical by one, or Aristocraticall
by more; fourthly, the title whether it be by Succession, or Election; and last
the use, how they exercise this Authority.

What things essential and what accidental in Government.
That there should be a power and order in Government, these two are essential
in all Governments, no Government can stand without these two; but the manner,
whether it be by one or by more; and the title, whether it be by Succession or
Election; and the use, whether they govern well or not; these three are but
accidental in Government.

Monarchical the best Government.
Of these two sorts of Government Monarchical is the best.

Their reasons who hold Aristocraticall Government to be the best.
Levi ben Gerson upon the 1 Samuel 8. holds that Aristocraticall Government is
best, and to be preferred to Kingly Government; learn, says he, what has
befallen us under the hand of Kings; David caused the plague to come upon the
people. 2 Samuel 24.15. Ahab restrained the rain for three years. 1 King. 17.
and Zedekiah caused the Sanctuary to be burnt, 2 Chro. 36.14. and the Jews
apply that saying of Hosea, I gave them a King in mine anger, and took him
away in my wrath. Hos. 13.11. That is, I gave them their first King Saul in
mine anger, and I took away their last King Zedekiah in my indignation. We
must distinguish betwixt the parts of a Kings person, and the faults of the
Office.
But the Jews distinguish not well here betwixt the faults of a Kings person,
and the calling it self; good Kings did many excellent things amongst them;
for David a man according to Gods own heart, fought the battles of the Lord, 1 Samuel 25.28. Kings have been the Instruments of much good.
appointed the order of the Priests, and Levites, and Singers, 1 Chro. 24. and
25. He made many Psalms to the praise of God. And Solomon who succeeded him,
built the Temple, wrote many excellent Proverbs and Parables, 1 King. 4.32. And
kept peace in Israel, that every man might dwell safely under his own
Vine-tree, and under his Fig Tree, 1 King. 4.25.

Now that Monarchical Government is the best government, it is proved thus.
Reasons prooving Monarchical government to be the best.




Israel, every man did that which he pleased; Micah set up an Idol. Kingly
government fittest to repress sin.
Judge. 18. and they defiled the Levites Concubine, because there was no King in
Israel. By King, here is not meant any other sort of government, but Kingly
government, as is evident, Judge. 18.17. (...) haeres interdicti a (...)
hereditare, vel possidens regnum, (...) possidere (...) regnum.
There was no Magistrate then, but in the original it is, there was no heir
of restraint then to put them to shame, Ioresh gnetzer, which may be
interpreted either haeres interdicti, or possidens regnum, there was none to
possess the Kingdom, or there was not an heir of restraint. Here two things
are to be observed; first, that that is the best government which restrains
sin most; secondly, that that government which is by an heir of restraint,
is fittest to repress sin; but the government Monarchical is such, and not
Aristocraticall, for it comes not per haeredem, but only by Election.
Observe what GOD himself says to his people, Deuteronomy. 17.20. that he may prolong
his days in his Kingdom, he and his children in the midst of Israel. Here the
Kingdom goes by succession, and not by election; here was an heir of
restraint to repress sin.

Cambyses will succeed to good Cyrus.

Hezekiah succeeded to Idolatrous Ahaz, and if we receive good at the hands of
God, why should we not receive evil also, Job 2.10?

Josephus testimony, of the Jews dealing with Pompey to change their
Government, Lib. 4. Antiq. 5.
and that they would be no longer under Kings; and so they bring Lactantius
citing Seneca, Lactantius lib. 17. c. 15.
speaking of the Commonwealth of Rome; Pueritiam sub caeteris regibus egisse,
ait, a quibus auctam and disciplinis plurimis institutisque formatam; at vero
Tarquinio regnante, cum jam quasi adulta esse caepisset, servitium non tulisse;
and superbo jugo dominationis rejecto, maluisse legibus obtemperare quam
regibus.

Jews wished that Pompey might change the government, The Romans find fault
with the person of their King, and not with his Office.
they wished only, that they might be more gently used; they blamed the
persons, and not the government simply; and so the Romans were weary of
Tarquinius government, but they were not weary of Kingly government, as long as
their Kings ruled them well.

Their Deduction then seems not to have a good ground, who simply do
prefer Aristocracie to Monarchy; first, they say Moses was extraordinarily
called, and Joshua succeeded him; and after that, the government of the
Synedrion or Seventie was settled amongst them, whose government was
Aristocraticall, Nomb. 11. The Judges were set up but for a time over them, and
they were raised up extraordinarily; and then the government was still the
Lords, as we see in the example of Gideon, Judge. 8. and of Iephthe, Judge. 9.
And after, that the Judges had ruled and governed them, then came Saul, whose
government arose from the coffeehouse of the people, but they say it
continued in the house of David especially, because he was a type of Christ;
but simply they say, that God liked Aristocracie best.

But seeing the Lord was minded to give the people of the Jews a King, God was
minded to give the Jews a King.
and tells them what King he would choose, Deuteronomy. 17. How liked he
Aristocracie best? and he likes that government here. Judge. 18.17. which is by
the heir of restraint or the heir of the Kingdom.

The Conclusion of this is, Belial.

CHAPTER II. An Explication of Iothams Apologue.
IVDG. 9.8. The trees went out on a time to anoint a King over them, etc.
THe Holy Ghost teaches us in the Scriptures by Similitudes, Parables, and
Apologues; God teaches us by Similitudes, Parables, and Apologues.
and as a cunning Painter, the more vive that his Colors are drawn in the
purtraiture to express the image, Simile.
we commend him the more; but when we see an Image made by some Archimedes,
that is (...), to move it self, nod with the head, and roll the eyes, we
commend that much more; So all the comparisons and similitudes in the
Scripture, are laid out as it were in vive Colors to us. Two Apologues only
found in the Scriptures.
But there are two Apologues brought in in the Scriptures, this of the trees
Judge. 9. and that 2 King. 14.9. how the Thistle of Lebanon propounded marriage
to the Cedar in Lebanon, where the trees are brought in walking and speaking,
which affect the mind more than plain Similitudes; and in these we must not so
much look to the Letter, as to that which they call (...), or the thing
signified by the Apologue.

All the trees refuse the Government.
Iotham brings in here the trees anointing a King, and they make choice of
three most excellent trees; the Olive, the Fig, and the Vine-tree, and they
all refused, The trees described by their properties.
and then they make choice of the Bramble. The three excellent trees which
refuse the government, the Olive, the Fig, and the Vine-tree, are described
by three properties; the Olive for his fatness, the Fig Tree for its
sweetness, and the Vine-tree because it cheared God and man: The Olive Judge.
9.9. says, should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honor God and
man; (...) ex hiphil and hophal compositum, sensus est, vestrisne verbis
persuasa ita missam facere pinguedinem meam, juxta hiphil, and ea ipsa queque
priver and deficiar juxta hophal, nihilque amplius habtam in me commendabile.
The trees serve for a natural, civil, and religious use.
in the Hebrew it is Hehhadalti, as if it should say, will ye persuade me with
your fair words to leave my fatness, that I should be altogether deprived of
it, so that I have nothing left in me worthy of commendation.

And if we will compare these three trees together, we must consider them first
as they serve for natural uses; secondly, as they serve for civil uses; and
thirdly, for religious uses; and then we shall see the excellency of these
trees.

First, in their natural use; consider the wood of the Olive how far it
excels the wood of the Fig Tree, The wood of the Olive tree excels the
rest.
or the Vine-tree; The Cherubims were made of the Olive tree, 1 King. 6.23.
which was a wood both of indurance fit to be carved or cut, better than the
Algum or Almug trees which Hiram sent to Solomon, 1 King. 10.11. and it was
better than the Cedar of Lebanon; the wood of the Fig Tree was but a base sort
of wood, but the Vine-tree is the basest of of all, Ezekiel. 15.2.3. will a man
take a pin of it to hinge any vessel, it serves for no use if it be not
fruitful; it is like the salt, if it loose the savor, it is good for nothing,
Mat. 5.13.

Secondly, consider the fruit of these trees; Their use in natural things.
the Vine is uvifera, the Olive is baceifera, and the Fig Tree is pomifera,
and they serve for most excellent uses in nature; the Wine serves to cheer
the heart of man, Psalm. 104.15. and Pro. 31.16. give Wine to him that is of a
sad heart, so the Oil makes the face to shine, Psalm. 104.15. and it is good
for the anointing of the body. A Roman being asked how it came to pass that
he lived so long? he said intus melle, and foris oleo: (...) qui ungebat, (...)
qui unctus fuit, ab (...) ungo.
it is fit for the anointing of the body: therefore those who wrestled of old
were called Aliptae.

Secondly, they have good use in curing of wounds, the Samaritane powered Wine
and Oil in the man's wounds, Luke 10.34. and the Fig is good to mature a
boil; the Lord commanded to lay a lump of Figs to Hezekias boil, Esaias. 36.

For civil uses, the Oil excels the Wine and the Fig, for by me they
honor man, Judge. 9.9. unguentum militare. convivale. funebre.

There is Vnguentum militare, wherewith their Kings were anointed to go out as
their Captains before them to the Battle; so David was anointed amongst the
mi^dst of his brethren to be their Captain and King, 1 Samuel 16.13. Secondly,
there was Vnguentum convivale, Eccles. 9.8. Let not Oil be wanting to thy
head, and let thy clothes be white. And thirdly, was Vnguentum funebre, as that
box of Ointment which was powered upon Christ's head, Math. 26.12.

The spiritual use of these trees.
Now let us consider them in their spiritual uses, as they served for the
worship of God; under the old Testaments the Wine and the Oil were used in
their Sacrifices, the Oil in their Meat Offering and the Wine in their
Drinke-offering; so in anointing their High Priests; but the Fig had no use
in their Ceremonial worship; but in his worship under the Gospel the Wine
goes before the Fig or the Olive, for it is the sign of our Lords blood in
the Sacrament.

These trees fitly represent a good King.
The Olive, the Vine, and the Fig tree, fitly represent a good King; the Olive
for his fatness to cure and heal their wounds, Esa. 3.7. Non ero Hhobhes, I
will not be a healer. (...) Ligator vulnerum.
The Seventie translateth it, (...) ligator vulnerum; it is the part of a good
Prince to power Oil in the wounds of his wounded Subjects. Secondly, the Fig
tree for his sweetness represents a good King. 1 King. 12.7. If thou will be
a servant unto this people, and serve them this day, then they will serve thee
for ever. So David spoke mildly and sweetly to the people, 1 Chronicles. 28.2. Hear
me my brethren and my people. Thirdly, the Vine-tree represents a good King;
the Wine gladdeth the heart, so the light of the Kings countenance is life, and
his favor is a cloud of the latter rain, Prove. 16.15.

Three refused the Government, Debora, Gideon, and Iephihe.
When these trees which were excellent for their fruit had refused the
Government, then they made choice of the Bramble for their King; the Bramble
represented a bad King. First, the Bramble brings forth no fruit; Secondly,
The many evils which the Bramble brought with it.
the Bramble has no shadow to shadow the rest; thirdly, Rhamnus the Bramble is
full of prickles, whatsoever it touches it holds fast, and it makes blood
to follow; it was with this sort of thorn wherewith Christ was crowned; the
Italians call it Spina sancta: Fourthly, the fire came from the Bramble and did
not only burn the shrubs of the field, but also the Cedars which were tall,
which might have seemed to be exempted from this tyranny.

The Persians said of Cyrus their King, that he was their Father, and Darius
their King was (...), (...).
a Vintner who sold them, but Cambyses their King was (...) their Lord who
hardly ruled over them.

The conclusion of this is, who feeds a flock and eats not of the milk. 1
Cor. 9.7. Thirdly, he is the husband and his Subjects are his wife, and
therefore she is called a widow when she wants her King, Lament. 1.1. What
great lamentation does a widow make when she wants her loving husband Josias,
then she poured her liver out upon the ground, her eyes failed with tears, and
her bowels were troubled, Lament. 2.11. Last, the Prince is the soul and the
Subjects are the body, and the body should do all things for the good of the
soul; he is the breath of our nostrils, Lament. 4.12. We see how many
obligations the Subjects owe to their King.

CHAPTER III. Why was God angry with them for choosing of a King.
1 SAMUEL 8.7. And the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people
in all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have
rejected me that I should not reign over them.
God was not angry simply with the Jews for choosing of a King, but because
they prevented the time.
KIngly Government being the best Government, why was the LORD then angry with
the Jews for choosing of a King?

He was not angry with them simply for desiring and choosing a King, but for
the manner of their choice; for God was minded to have given them a King, but
they would not stay the Lords leisure, but anticipated the time; therefore the
Jews say of them, comederunt immaturam uvam, the grape was not ripe enough as
yet; we may see that God was minded to have given them a King, Deuteronomy. 17.
because he tells them what sort of King they should choose, and what he
should do; and they say, Three things given in commandment to the Jews when
they entered into Canaan.
that he gave them three things in commandment when they entered into Canaan;
first, to choose a King; secondly, to root out the Canaanites; and thirdly, to
build a Temple for his worship: God was angry with them that they sought a King
so long as good Samuel ruled over them; he was angry with them because they
would have a King to reign over them after the manner of the Nations, Deuteronomy.
17.14. I will set a King over me like all the Nations round about me, but thou
shall set them over thee whom the Lord thy God will choose: If they had said to
Samuel, give one to reign over us after thy death, because thy children are
corrupt, 1 Samuel 8.3. or give us one who may govern us in equity; this had
been no offense to God: but simply to desire a King like the Kings of the
Nations, this was their sin, and herein they rejected not Samuel, but God
himself, 1 Samuel 8.7.

How was God rejected when they chose a King, Prove. 8. and the Kings throne is
Gods throne, 1 Chro. 29.23. and 1 King. 2.15.

The Lord did reign over them in both these sorts of Government, The Judges
had not such absolute government over the people as the Kings had.
they had not such an absolute Government as when the Kings reigned over them;
the Judges might make no Laws, nor take tribute of the people as the Kings
might do; therefore the Lords immediate Government did more appear when the
Judges ruled them, Judge. 8.23. I will not rule over you, neither shall my son
rule over you, the Lord shall rule over you. And when they rejected Samuel here
they said in effect, as the Jews said when they disclaimed Christ, We will
have no King to reign over us but Caesar, Ioh. 19.15. Gods power did more
appear when the Judges ruled, but his goodness and mercy appeared more when
the Kings ruled.
When the Judges ruled over them then Gods power did more appear helping them
by weak means; but when the Kings reigned over them, then Gods wisdom and
his goodness did more appear in settling a government amongst them, and making
their Kings types of Christ. And as in Gods miracles his power did more
appear, but in his ordinary course working by nature his wisdom and
goodness appeared more; so in these two forms of Government, his power did
appear more when the Judges ruled over them; but in settling the Kingly
government amongst them, his goodness and his wisdom did more appear.

The conclusion of this is, a me, per me, and propter me: a me when he is sent
by the Lord; per me, when he is sustained and upholden by the Lord; and propter
me, when he serves to glorify God in his Kingdom.

CHAPTER IIII. What Samuel means by Mishpat Hammelech. (...)

1 SAMUEL 8.11. And he said this will be the manner of the King that shall reign
over you, etc.
KIMCHI says whatsoever is set down in this Text, (...) Lex Regis.
it is lawful for the King to do it, and therefore he interprets Mishpat
Melech 1 Samuel 8.8. This shall be the Law of the King, or this is the thing
which the King may do by the Law; the Chaldie Paraphrast paraphraseth it
Nimusa, a Law.

(...) Lex, chaldaice.
Maymone expounds the words in this wise, he shall take your Beasts at the
Kings price, and your Olives and your Vines for to maintain his servants in
the Wars; Rambamfilius Maymone.
and he says in necessitate omnia pertinent ad jus regis, sed extra
necessitatem non pertinent: But this is not the meaning of the place.

Samuel describes a tyrant, and not what a King may lawfully do.
The Lord is describing here to them, that King which he is to give to them in
his wrath, and not what a lawful King may do; and Mishpat here signifies not
a Law, but the manner and custom of him who should do such things, as 1 Samuel
2.13. And the Priests [Mishpat] custom was with the people to take the flesh
of the sacrifice that did not belong to him. Here it cannot be translated, it
was the Priests Law, for it had been sacrilegious theft in the Priest to have
taken any part of the sacrifice, but that which was due to him. So this should
be the [Mishpat] or custom of this King whom God sent in his wrath, that he
should take any thing which he pleased from them, although it had not been for
necessary uses; but 1 Samuel 10.25. (...) Lex Regni.
the word Mishpat is taken in another sense, then Samuel told the people
[Mishpat Hammelocha] the law of the Kingdom, and laid it up before the Arc.
Here Mishpat is taken in another sense, how the King should rule the Country,
and this Book Samuel laid up before the Arc; but this Mishpat was not laid up
before the Arc, but was set down as a punishment for that people.

Now that this King which Samuel describes unto them (whom God sent in his
wrath) might not do these things to his Subjects by lawful authority,
Reasons prooving that he was not a lawful King, who is described here.
the reasons are these.

King in his anger, and took him away in his wrath, Hos. 13.11. Which cannot
be said of any King in whom there is but the least sparkle of goodness.

[Cerem] not only your Vines, but also your Vineyards, (...)
as Ahab took Naboths Vineyard; whereas David bought from Aranna the Iebusite
the ground to build the Temple on.



The Kings of Israel made no free men slaves.
but the good Kings of Israel never did so, they set not the Israelites to any
servile work, 2 Chronicles. 2 17. And Solomon set the Israelites to be overseers
over the work of the Temple, but he set Strangers to do the servile works.

When the Holy Ghost describes a good King, he calls him Nadibh: and (...)
in the New Testament, (...).
Bountiful lord, Luke 22.



Jews hold that they were not all accomplished in one King, some of them were
accomplished in Rehoboam, 1 King. 12.16. some of them in Ahab, 1 King. 21. and
some in Omri, Micah 6.16.

We and ours are thine; and the good King or Nadibb will answer, (...)
Princeps, a munificentia et liberalitate fic dictus.
I and mine shall be ever for you my people. When the Master sends his
servant away with his reward, and the servant does his duty faithfully, then
it is called (...), Mat. 20.2.

CHAPTER V. A Difference betwixt the Election of Saul, and the Election of
David.
1 SAMUEL 13.14. The Lord has sought him a man after his own heart.
FIrst Saul was chosen but out of the tribe of Benjamin, but David out of the
tribe of Judah; and the Kingdom was intailed to him and his posterity, but not
to the posterity of Saul. In Christ's genealogy none is called a King but
David only.

Saul was chosen by lot, David immediately.
Secondly, Saul was chosen by lot, but David more immediately by God; and even
as Matthias when he was chosen by lot, his calling was not so solemn as Paul's
was: so neither was the calling of Saul so solemn as was the calling of David,
Non tam misit Deus Saulum quam permisit populo.

Thirdly, when he speaks of David, he says 1 Samuel 13.14. Quaesivi, Bikkesh
est diligenter inquirere, Cant. 3. (...) diligenter inquirere.
Exodus 4.19. 2 Samuel 22.33. And he was as glad in finding of him, as the Widow
was when she found her groat, who called in her neighbors to rejoice with her
when she had found it, Luke 16.9.

Fourthly, Quaesivi mihi, est dativus Commodi. Zach. 9.9. Mihi est dativus
commodi. id est, in commodum meum.
Behold thy King comes unto thee; that is, for thy profit and benefit. So
David was the King that would serve for the Lords glory.

Fifthly, he chose David according to his own heart, this was verbum amoris;
and there was great similitude betwixt David's heart, and Gods own heart. The
Jews observe concerning David, that when he had sinned in numbering of the
people, God said to the Prophet, Go tell David, 2 Samuel 24.12. 1 Chronicles. 21.10.
How the Lord calls David his servant.
Giving him no other title but David; as Kimchi marketh upon that place; but
when he had a purpose to build a house for the Lord, then he said Go tell my
servant David, 2 Samuel 7.5. 1 Chronicles. 17.4. Showing what account he makes of
such, and how acceptable men are to him, when they seek his glory, and the
good of his Church. So when the people had committed Idolatry, the Lord calls
them Moses people, Go get thee down, Why God called the Israelites Moses
people.
for thy people which thou broughtst out of Egypt, have corrupted themselves,
Exodus 32.7. He calls them not my people, because they were blotted with such
a blot as was not to be found in his children, Deuteronomy. 32.5. Now because David
was a King fit for Gods worship, see how friendly he speaks of him, I have
sought to me a man; that is, an excellent man.

Sixthly, according to my heart; God chose not David for his stature.
I made not choice of him for his comely stature, as the people made choice of
Saul, but I chose him because he was a man according to mine own heart.

The Conclusion of this is, 1 Samuel 16.7. a man judges according to his eyes,
but the Lord looks to the heart; the Lord has not eyes of flesh, Carneos
habire oculos quid.
Job 10.4. That is, he looks not to outward qualities as men do; but his
eyes pierce into the heart; and he made choice of David, because he saw his
heart was upright. The heart of the Prince is the object of the eye of God.

CHAPTER VI. Of the anointing of their Kings, and whether the Kings and Priests
were anointed with the same Oil or not.
PSALM. 89.27. I have found David my servant, with my holy Oil have I anointed
him.
How the anointing of the Kings and Priests pertains to the Judicial Law.
ALthough the anointing of the Kings and Priests was a thing ceremonial under
the Law, yet thus far it falls under the Judicial Law: first, what Kings
and their sons succeeding them were anointed; secondly, whether the Priests
and the Kings were anointed with the same Oil or not.

There were three sorts of persons anointed under the Law, Kings, Priests, and
Prophets.

All the Priests at the first were anointed.
All the Priests were anointed at the first, both the high Priests and the
inferior Priests, Levit. 8. but afterward only the high Priest was anointed
and his sons after him, Levit. 6.21. and 21.10. and 16.32. therefore he was
called the anointed of the Lord.

How the Priest was anointed.
The Priest when he was anointed, first, he was anointed with Oil, secondly,
sprinkled with blood, and thirdly, with blood and oil, Levit. 8. The first was
upon his head, the second upon his flesh, and the third upon his garments.

So the King was anointed, What Kings were anointed.
but the Kings son was not anointed, if his father was anointed before him;
one anointing served for both, because the Kingdom is the Kings inheritance
for ever, Deuteronomy. 17.20. But if there had been a sedition, they did anoint him,
to pacify the people, and settle the sedition, and to make known who was the
right King; as Solomon was anointed, Maymont in his Treatise of the Implements
of the Sanctuary, cap. 1. sect. 4.
because of the sedition of Adonijah, 1 King. 1. and Ioash because of Athalia,
2 King. 11. and Ioahaz because of his brother Iehojakim, 2 King. 23.30.

Whether were the Kings and Priests anointed with the same Oil or not?

There were four Kings anointed at the first with common Oil, called the Oil
of Balsom; Four Kings anointed both with common oil, and with the holy oil.
Saul was anointed with this common Oil when Samuel first anointed him, this
was done in Rama, where neither the Sanctuary nor holy Oil were; secondly, he
who was anointed with this common oil was David by Samuel at Bethlehem;
thirdly, Hasael and Iehu by one of the children of the Prophets, 2 King. 9.1.
And the Jews say, that those who were anointed by the Prophets, were anointed
with common Oil; but those who were anointed by the high Priest were anointed
with holy Oil.

But Saul when he was made King over Israel at Mizpeh, was anointed with the
holy oil by the high Priest, and David was anointed with the holy Oil at
Hebron and at Jerusalem; when they were anointed before by the Prophets, it was
but a preparation to this holy Oil.

The Church of Rome holds that the King and the Priest were not anointed with
the same Oil, Becanus de jure regio.
that they may advance the Pope above Princes: their reason is this;

None that had the holy Oil upon his head might lament for the dead. Levit.
21.10. But the King might lament for the dead; therefore he was not anointed
with the same Oil wherewith the high Priest was anointed: they prove that the
King might lament for the dead, as David did for Absalom, 2 Samuel 18.33. so for
Abner, 2 Samuel 3.21.

David's mourning after the Beer; Why the high Priest might not mourn for the
dead.
R: Judah answers, that David did this to purge himself, that he was not
guilty of the blood of Abner: and the Text says, that the people and all
Israel understood that day, Why David mourned for Absolon and Abner.
that it was not of the King to slay Abner the son of Ner, 2 Samuel 3.27. The
ceremony gave place here to the necessity, he mourned that he might take the
suspicion out of the hearts of the people: and for his mourning for Absalom,
his passion miscarried him.

Now the reasons proving that they were both anointed with the same sort of
Oil are these.

with mine holy Oil have I anointed him, Psalm. 89.27.

Olive branches that stood before the Lord, Zach. 4.11. The Chaldie Paraphrast
paraphraseth it thus; those are Zerubbabel and Joshua, the Prince of the
people, and the high Priest; because they were both anointed with the same sort
of Oil.

Vnctus Iehovae, but vir multarum vestium; he was distinguished then from the
rest of the Priests by the several Ornaments which he wore, but not by his
anointing.

Although there was no material oil in the second Temple, wherewith they
anointed the King and Priest, Nehem. 7.65. there was neither Vrim nor Thummim
in the second Temple, yet by the form in the first Temple he expresses what
Priests shall be in the second Temple.

Thirdly, the King was in dignity above the high Sam. 7.18. Is it probable
then that he was anointed with an inferior sort of oil to that wherewith the
Priest was anointed?

A comparison betwixt David's anointing and Christ, David thrice anointed, so
was Christ.
David was thrice anointed; first, in Bethlehem secretly by Samuel; secondly,
at Hebron; and thirdly, at Jerusalem: so Jesus Christ was anointed in the womb
of the Virgin; secondly, this anointing manifested it self more when he taught
at Nazaret, Luke 4.13.14. see Act. 7.37.38. And this anointing was fully
manifested in his resurrection, Psalm. 4.5.

David was anointed a King, but he was not an anointed Prophet to attend upon
that calling only, as Esaias and Jeremiah; but Christ was anointed both King and
Prophet: Melchizedeck was a King and a Priest, None anointed King, Priest, and
Prophet, but Jesus Christ.
but he was not a King, Priest, and Prophet, as Christ was. Samuel was a Priest
and a Prophet; but he was not a King, Priest, and Prophet, as Christ was. There
was never any anointed King, Priest, and Prophet, but Christ only, and we are
made in him regale sacerdotium, 1 Pet. 1.9. a royal Priesthood.

It may be asked seeing all the children of God are called Mesichim, or
Christ's,

Mesichim, but Christ is Hameshiah, that anointed of the Lord, Luke 2.26. He is
not so much called the anointed in concreto, as the oil in abstracto, Christ
called the oil.
Esaias 10. I will take away the yoke for the Oils sake, that is, for the
anointeds sake Jesus Christ.

exalts himself above all that are called gods, 2 Thessalonians. 2.4. that is, above
all Princes and Kings.

CHAPTER VII. How the Kings of Judah and Israel, brake this Commandment in
multiplying riches.
DEVT. 17.17. Neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold,
etc.
IT is lawful for Kings to multiple riches by lawful means; How the Kings of
Judah and Israel might multiply riches.
first, of their own proper inheritance, 1 Chronicles. 29.3. this the Hebrews call
Segulla, I have of my own proper good. Secondly, the King may multiply his
riches by husbandry, as Vzzia did, 2 Chronicles. 26 10. So by tributes and gifts
given unto him by other Nations, 2 Chronicles. 17.5. in token of their homage and
subjection. So with things purchased by lawful war from captives, 2 Samuel
8.10. and 1 Chro. 18.22. 2 Chro. 15.7. So for the safety of his Country, and
for the good of his Subjects, he may require tributes and taxations from the
people, and more than ordinary Subsidies, which all turns to their good: for
as the vapors which are drawn up to the Clouds, are not reserved there, but
are sent down to the earth again to water it, and to make it fruitful; so
the Subsidies which the King exacteth from the people this ways, come back
again to their use, to keep and to defend them.

David had great riches, How David came by his riches.
and he got his riches three ways: first by his tributes; secondly, by the
spoil of his enemies; for he fought twenty battles, and got all the spoil
from the enemies; and thirdly, he had argentum capitationis, the pole money of
all the people; and all this he laid up for the building of the Temple of the
Lord; therefore he says 1 Chro. 22.14. (...) in afflictione mea.
Now behold [Begnaneij] in my poverty or affliction, I have prepared for the
house of the Lord an hundredth thousand talents of gold, etc. Why calls he it,
his poverty? because he had nothing but that which he had from the Lord, 1 Chronicles. 29.16. And therefore he would return it back again for the building
of a house to him: here David multiplied silver, but not contrary to the law.
Solomon how he came by his riches.
So Solomon exceeded all the Princes of the earth in riches, his Dominion was
from the river of Egypt to Euphrates; and from Libanus Northward, to the
Mediterran Sea, all those were tributaries to him; the Queen of Sheba brought
out of Arabia Faelix much spices to him, 1 King. 10. And he had three Navies
that came home every third year with gold and precious stones; and the whole
twelve tribes paid tribute to him: he did not here contrary to the law, that
the King should not multiply riches, but that blessing was then fulfilled in
him which was made to Abraham, that his seed should possess, from the river
of Egypt to Euphrates.

The Law says, Deuteronomy. 17.17. (...)
Non multiplicabit sibi valde [lo jarbe lo meod,] in 2 Chronicles. 32.27. it is said
of Hezekias that he had exceeding much riches: [Harbe meod,] the very same
words which are in the interdiction, did Hezekias gather his riches contrary to
the law here? Not; the meaning of the law then is this, that a King should not
multiply gold and silver, to put his confidence in them, or for unnecessary
uses; and it seems that Solomon brake not this law until the Temple was
built, the City enlarged, and the wars ended; then for him in his old age to
lay such heavy tributes and taxations upon the people, was to multiply riches
unto a wrong end: when Solomon gave gold and silver at Jerusalem as plenteous
as stones, 2 Chro. 1.15. This was lawful to give to his Subjects, but Eccles.
2.8. he says, I gathered me also silver and gold, when he gathered it only to
satisfy his covetous desire, and not for necessary uses, that was the
transgression of the Law.

The next part of the interdiction was this, that he should not multiply
horses to himself.

The end of this interdiction was first, to take away all commerce and dealing
with the Egyptians; for having commerce with the Egyptians, and bringing horses
from thence, they were in danger to be infected with Idolatry. Why God forbad
them to multiply.
Secondly, he forbad them to multiply horses, least they should trust in them,
Psalm. 20.7. Some trust in Chariots, and some in Horses, but we will remember
the name of the Lord our God. He forbad to multiply horses to trust in them,
therefore the Lord commands Joshua 11.6. Thou shall hough their horses, (...)
Subnervabis equo^.
[Tegnakker Suschen] subnervabis equos, thou shall not kill them, but cut the
mastersinew, and make them unfit for any service and war hereafter, Joshua
why commanded to hough the horses.
that they might do no service against the people of God afterward: they
might take Camels and Asses in the Battle, Numb. 31.11. and such beasts as
were not fit for the wars, and if at any time they reserved any of the
Horses, it was but a small number: so we see 2 Samuel 8.4. that David of a
thousand Chariots and seven hundredth horsemen which he took in the wars,
reserved only horses for an hundredth Chariots; but he houghed all the rest of
the Chariot horses, he left them so, that they might serve for other uses, but
not for the wars, and he reserved here but the tenth part of them; Solomon at
the first was commended for the multitude of his horses, When horses and silver
may be multiplied.
because he kept them for the defense of the Country; but the Law forbids
to keep them for unnecessary uses, for ostentation, or for trusting in them,
and so Solomon fell afterward to multiply horses and gold exceedingly, but
not for necessary uses; and see how Esaias is a Commentary to this law, cap.
2.7.8. and shows us the end of this interdiction, when he says, the land is
full of silver and gold, Multiplying of horses and gold, draw them to Idolatry.
neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of their
horses, neither is there any end of their Chariots; their land is also full of
Idols. Here we see why the Lord forbids them to multiply horses, because
these drew them to make a league with Idolaters, and made them worship Idols.

Thirdly, the King is forbidden to multiply Wives, The heathens multiply Wives.
Pro. 31.3. Give not thy strength to women, nor thy ways to that which
destroys Kings; the Heathen Kings gave themselves much to have many wives:
Asshuerus commanded, that through all his Provinces which were an hundredth
twenty and seven, that the most beautiful Virgins should be brought to him,
Esth. 2.3. Iustini. lib. 12.
And Darius had as many wives as there are days in the year; but Solomon
exceeded them all in the number of his wives.

The number of Salomons Wives and Concubines are reckoned diversely, 1 King.
11.3. The reconciliation of these two places King 11 3 and Cant 6.8 concerning
^a^omons Wives.
it is said that he had seve^ hundredth wives Princesses, and three hundredth
Concubines: but Cant. 6.8. there are sixty Queens and eighty Concubines, and
Virgins without number: where he alludeth to the number of Salomons wives:
Genebrard goes about to reconcile the places this ways, that Solomon at the
first had but sixty Queens, and eighty Concubines; but afterward their
number came to seven hundredth wives, and three hundredth Concubines; but this
reconciliation cannot stand; for then it should follow that Solomon wrote the
Canticles before he repented; but the true reconciliation is this, although he
had seven hundredth Queens, Sixty Queens which were in favor with him.
yet he had sixty of them who were most in favor with him, and honored by
the people, and these are set down, Cant. 6.8. and they were brought forth
that day that Solomon married Pharaohs daughter, and when they saw her, they
praised her beauty and dignity, and they said, who is she that looks out
at the windows as the morning; the whole number of his Wives and Concubines
seems to have been a thousand, Eccles. 2.28. Of men I have found one of a
thousand, but I have not found a woman amongst these thousands.

The Jews restraint of multiplying vviues.
This Law that the King should not multiply wives, the Jews restrained it to
eighteen wives; they say that David the King had sixteen wives, 2 Samuel 15.16.
the King left ten women which were Concubines to keep the house; these
Concubines were his wives, and besides it is said, 1 Chro. 3.6. that he had six
wives more, in all he had sixteen. So Rehoboam had eighteen wives, 2 Chro.
11.21. And they add farther, that David had six wives before Nathan came to
him, 2 Samuel 3.13. then the Lord said unto him, 2 Samuel 12.8. if that had been
too little for thee, I would have overmore given thee such and such things; the
word is twice repeated here [Cahenna ve cahenna] quot illae quot illae, (...)
twelve more make in all these eightteene wives which David might have had; and
the Targum paraphraseth that place, Deuteronomy. 17.17. Ne multiplicet uxores ultra
octodecem, ne depravent cor ejus; and Solomon Iarchi upon Deuteronomy. 17. he shall
not multiply wives above eighteen, because we find that David the King had
but eighteen wives. Ye see upon what a sandy ground they build this: they
say that David and Rehoboam brake not this commandment, because they contained
themselves within the number of eighteen; but Solomon who exceeded the number,
he brake the commandment.

To multiply wives was altogether against the law; Multiplying of wives was
against the Law.
for they two shall be one flesh, binds him as well that sits upon the
throne, as him that draws the water and heweth the wood: but this to multiply
horses and gold, is but secundum quid against the Law; that is, Multiplying of
horses not altogether against the Law.
it is not simply forbidden, but only for unnecessary uses, and to put their
trust in them; but to enable them for the defense of their Country, and
benefit of the Estate; that is not forbidden.

CHAPTER VIII. A comparison betwixt Salomons Kingdom and Christ's.
PSALM. 89.2. His throne shall be established as the Moon, and shall endure as
the Sun before me.
DAVID prayed for his son Solomon, that the Lord would give his Judgments to
the King, and he compares his Kingdom to the Moon; Salomons Kingdom
compared to the Moon. Simile.
for as the Moon borrows her light from the Sun, so he beggeth of the
Lord, that he would give light to his son Solomon to direct him: and as
Astrologians observe, that when the Moon is joined with a bad Planet, then her
influence is bad; but when she is joined with a good Planet, then her influence
is good; so Solomon in his Government when he was joined to Idolatry, and
strange women, then there was a bad influence upon his Government; but when he
took the direction from the Lord, then his Kingdom flourished. There is a
stone in Arabia called Selenites, Plinius de Gemmis. Simile.
which grows with the Moon, and decreaseth with it; when the Moon is in the
wane, ye cannot see the stone in the perfect color; but when the Moon is at
the full, then the stone grows again to the full: so Salomons Kingdom, as
long as he got light from the Lord it waxed; but when he turned once from the
Lord, it decayed daily. Last, it was like the Moon, the Moon in twenty eight
days finisheth her course, fourteen days to the full, Salomons kingdom like
the Moon in waxing and waning.
and fourteen to the wane; so from Abraham to Solomon fourteen generations,
then the Moon was at the full; then from the end of Salomons days until
Zedekiah were fourteen generations; and then his Kingdom decayed and waned.

Solomon the King when he judged Israel he sat in a throne, 1 King. 10.18. and
the King made a great throne of Ivorie, and overlaid it with the best gold; the
throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind, and it stood
in the porch of Judgment where he judged the people, 1 King. 7.7. and there
were stays in each side in the place of the seat, and two Lions stood behind
the stays, The difference betwixt Salomons throne of Ivorie and the brazen
scaffold.
and twelve Lions stood there, six on the one side and six upon the other
upon the six steps, and there was not the like made in any Kingdom, 2 Chronicles. 9.17. This throne of Solomon was called Solium Domini, because he judged
the Lords judgment there; and it differed from that pillar which stood in the
Temple, for that was a pulpit in which they read the Law, (...) Suggestus.
2 Chro. 6.13. and it was called [Cijor] but this throne was called Cisse, and
it stood in Domo Libani, (...) thronus.
next adjacent to the Queens Palace; it was made of Ivory, which was in great
request amongst the Jews; and Solomon alludeth to it, Cant. 4.6. Allusion.
thy neck is like a Tower of Ivorie.

There were six Lions upon the one side as he went up to his throne, and six
upon the other, What the Lions signified on every side of the Throne.
a Lion at every step; these Lions on every side signified that all the
twelve tribes were subject to Solomon, and acknowledged him as their King; and
the two Lions which stood before the stays signified, that the two tribes Judah
and Benjamin should not depart from Solomon, but continue with him, and his
posterity, to be stays to uphold his Kingdom; which was signified by the
garment of Ahija the Shilonite, rent in twelve pieces, ten were given to
Jeroboam, and two only left to Rehoboam Salomons son, 1 King. 11.

And the Jews write, The admonitio^s which they gave the King when he ascended
to his Throne. In Z^norenna P. Shophat. 1 (...) 2 (...) 3 (...) 4 (...) 5 (...)
6 (...)
that as he ascended upon every step or degree to his throne, a crier cried
to him thus; upon the first step he cried, [lo titeh Mishpat] judicium ne
inclinato, wrest not judgment; secondly, when he ascended upon the second
step he cried unto him, [lo tikir panim] personam ne respicit, accept no
persons in judgment; when he ascended upon the third step, he cried unto
him, [lo tikahh shohher] munus ne recipito, take no bribes; when he ascended
upon the fourth step, he cried [lo tittang lech asherah] non plantabis lucum,
thou shall not plant a grove; when he ascended upon the fifth step he cried
unto him [lo takim lech matzebah] noli erigere statuam, set not up a pillar;
when he ascended upon the sixth step, he cried unto him [lo tizbahh shor] ne
macato bovem, kill not an Ox, that is, sacrifice not to Idols: as he ascended
by degrees, so the admonitions did grow by degrees, from justice to have a care
of religion; and as the Jews had Psalmos gradnum, Psalms of degrees which
they sang when they ascended to the Temple; so these were admonitiones graduum,
that he should not pervert justice, that he should abstain from Idolatry,
that he should not plant a grove, nor erect a pillar for Idolatrous worship,
and that he should not sacrifice to Idols. The twelve Princes of Israel sat
round about this throne; and Christ alludeth to this form, Allusion.
ye shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes, Luke 22.30.

A comparison betwixt Solomon and Christ.
Now let us compare Solomon with Christ;

Solomon was jejidia, beloved of God, but Christ was the only beloved son of
his Father.

Solomon was only anointed, and all the rest of his brethren secluded from the
Kingdom; but we are anointed by Christ, and receive grace for grace from him,
Ioh. 1.16. and are made coheires with him, Romans 8.17. in his Kingdom; here is
a greater than Solomon.

Solomon was crowned his Father being alive, here was Leo and catulus Leonis,
the Lion and the Lions whelp; so Christ thought it not robbery to be equal
with the Father, and to reign with him, Phil. 2.6. here is a greater than
Solomon.

Solomon was obedient to his Parents, so Christ, Ioh. 8.49. I honor my Father,
that is, my heavenly Father, and he went home and was obedient to his Parents,
Luke 2.51. Here is a greater than Solomon.

Salomons marriage, friendship was made up betwixt Egypt and Israel; but Christ
marrying his Church, friendship is made up betwixt God and man; here is a
greater than Solomon.

Salomons Kingdom reached but from the Mediterran Sea to Euphrates; but
Christ's Kingdom reaches to the ends of the earth, Psalm. 2.8. I will give thee
the ends of the earth for a possession; here is a greater than Solomon.

Solomon exceeded all the Princes of the world in riches; in Christ are hid all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, Col. 2.3. here is a greater than
Solomon.

Let us compare Salomons piety and Christ's, Christ and Solomon compared in
piety.
Solomon Solomon offered an hundredth thousand Bullockes; but Christ offered a
greater Sacrifice, even himself upon the Cross; here is a greater than
Solomon.

The Kings of the earth were subject unto him, but Revel. 17.14. had written
upon the hemme of his garment, Rex regum, and Dominus dominantium, the lowest
thing which is in Christ, is above all the Princes of the earth; here is a
greater than Solomon.

When Solomon went to the Temple, he had four and 1 Chro. 27.1. and 2 Chro.
11.12. and when he went to bed, he had threescore valiant men about him of the
valiant of Israel, Cant. 3.7. But Christ has ten thousand times ten thousand,
and thousands of thousands of Angels attending him, Revel. 5.11. here is a
greater than Solomon.

Let us compare them in their wisdom, Solomon had a large heart, like the
sand of the sea, Christ and Solomon compared in wisdom.
1 King. 4.29. Observe his wisdom in deciding the matter betwixt the two
women, 1 King. 3. the thing was done in the night, there were no witnesses, no
probable conjectures favoring the one more than the other, the allegations of
the Mothers both alike, no difference between the childrens age; Solomon
gathered that she was the mother who had the bowels of compassion toward the
infant; Counsel in the heart of man is like deep waters, but a man of
understanding will draw it out. Pro. 20. 5. Solomon by his understanding drew
out here who was the mother of the living child, but he must have some means
whereby to know this; but Christ to whom darkness is as light, he sees the
secrets of the heart, and all things are naked before him, Heb. 4.13. here is a
greater than Solomon.

Ioab and putting Abiathar from the Priesthood; but Christ shall put down all
his enemies, and purge his Church of hirelings, Mat. 21.12. here is a greater
than Solomon.

Lastly, all the earth shall be blessed in Solomon. When the Jews bless any
man, they pray for him after this manner, Beneficus sit tibi Deus ac liberalis,
ut praestitit se erga servum suum Salomonem, this was but fulfilled in type in
Solomon; but the truth was fulfilled in Christ, Esa. 65.16. He who blesses
himself on the earth, shall bless himself in the God of truth: and he
concludes this Psalm for Solomon, Amen, Amen, Psalm. 72.19. Solomon was not he
that could effectuate the prayers of the Church; but Christ is that true and
faithful witness, who is yea and Amen, Revel. 3.14.

Arguments prooving Salomons repentance.
Solomon being such a vive type of Christ, whether might he have been thought
to have been a reprobate or not?



Luke 1.70. As he spoke by his holy Prophets.

Salomons prayer, and accepted of his sacrifices, 1 King. 3.6. which he never
did in any oblation of the wicked, Esaias 1.11.12.13. so Ioh. 9.31. We know that
God hears not sinners, See Pro. 15.8.
that is, Impenitent sinners.

Chro. 11.17. Rehoboam in the first three years of his Reign followed the
footsteps of David and Solomon; hence it follows, Solomon set down as an
example of good.
that Solomon being set down as an example of Imitation for good, that he died
a penitent and reconciled to God; and as the evil beginnings of Manassch,
discommended the evil end of Ammon; so the good beginnings of Rehoboam,
commended the good end of Solomon.

When the Kings of Judah and Israel are set down for examples, these Rules are
to be observed. Rules to be observed concerning examples.


First, when the wicked father lives in his sins, and King. 15.9. Zachariah
is said to have done that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his
fathers had done; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of
Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

Secondly, when the wicked King repents him of King. 21.20. it is said of
Ammon, that he walked in all the ways that his father Manasseh walked in, and
served Idols which his father Manasseh served; This is to be understood only
of Manassehs first days, and not of his last days, when he repented him of
his wickedness.

Thirdly, when a bad King repented him of his wickedness, Chron. 11.17.
Rehoboam in the first three years of his Reign followed the footsteps of
David and Solomon.

Fourthly, If the beginning of a King be good, and his Asa began well, yet
because he fell away, 2 Chronicles. 10.10. therefore good Iehosaphat is never said
to walk in his ways. And the Lord gives the reason of this, Ezekiel. 16.24.
When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits
iniquity, his former righteousness shall be no more remembered. And again,
when the wicked turns away from his wickedness, and does that which is
lawful and right, he shall live.

Solomon is censured by the Holy Ghost, not that he had utterly forsaken God,
but that he went not fully after the Lord; or that his heart was not perfect as
was the heart of David his father.

Salomons Kingdom flourished so long as he followed the Lord; therefore
Religion is a strong pillar like Iakin or Bognaz to uphold a Kingdom;
otherwise it will stand but upon brickle feet of iron and clay, as
Nebuchadnezzars Image did, Dan. 2.33.

CHAPTER IX. Whether Rahab was a betrayer of the City of Jericho or not?
JOSH. 21. And the Spies came into an Harlots house, named Rahab, and lodged
there, etc.
Things objected against Rahab for receiving the Spies.
IT may be said against Rahab, first that she was an Harlot, and therefore no
marvel that she was so ready to betray the City in which she was borne,
receiving the Spies into her house.

Secondly, when the King sent unto her, she answered him not as a dutiful
Subject ought to have done, but hid the Spies in her house, and let them down
by a Cord through the window, and taught them how to escape, and when the
Searchers came to seek them, she said, she knew not what men they were, or
whither they were gone; whereas in the mean time, she had brought them up to
the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of Flax, which she had
laid upon the roof in order, Josh. 2.6.

But it may be said in defense of Rahab,

Grace takes not away the bonds of nature, Grace takes not away the bonds of
nature.
but rather establishes it, 1 Pet. 2.5. Fear God and obey the King: a King
and his Subjects are Infidels, some of his Subjects are converted to the faith,
as it fell out in the Apostles days, that the Emperors remaining Infidels, yet
sundry of their Subjects were converted to the Christian faith. Did their
Christianity loose the bond of obedience which they ought to their Emperor?
God forbid; but confirmed it rather, therefore the Apostle wills to make all
sort of supplication for them, 1 Timothy 2.1.

But Rahab was free from the crime of treason, Rahab was free of treason.
for first God revealed unto her, that the Israelites were to take this City,
and destroy it. Secondly, she knew that whether she had discovered the Spies,
or hid them, yet the City should be destroyed: wherefore it was best for her
in the destruction of the Kingdom which she could not save, to save her self,
and her own household; and here she conformed her will to the will of GOD; and
as he is no traitor, who yields an Hold to the Prince of the Land, although
it be contrary to the will of him, who has commandment over the Hold: so when
Rahab yielded the City to the Lord, contrary to the will of the Inhabitants of
Jericho, she is not to be reputed a betrayer of the City for that. Heber made
a covenant with the Canaanites and with the Israelites.
Heber the Kenite and his wife made a covenant with the Canaanites, and a
covenant with the Israelites the people of God; now there was wars betwixt
the Israelites and the Canaanites; Sisera the Canaanite flies into the tent of
Iael the wife of Heber the Kenite; What shall she do in such a case? If she
kill Sisera, then she breaks her covenant with the Canaanites; and if she let
Sisera go f ee, then she will fight against the people of God, and destroy
them; Iael had a civil league with the Canaanites, but a civil and spiritual
league with the Israelites.
here her wisdom teaches her what to do, to kill the Canaanite with whom
she had only a civil league, and to save the Israelites, with whom she had
both a spiritual and a civil league.

Three sorts of strangers with whom the Israelites had to do.
There were three sorts of the Nations, with some they might have faedera
commerciorum, as David and Solomon made with the King of Tyrus, 2 Samuel 5.11. 1
King. 5.12. of whom it is said, he made this covenant with them, according to
the wisdom which God had given him. So Christ sought water of the woman of
Samaria, and David fled to the King of Gath for a refuge. Secondly, there were
the Ammonites and the Moabites, Deuteronomy. 23.6. Ye shall not seek their
prosperity all your days; that is, ye shall not enter into covenant of
friendship with them, but yet Deuteronomy. 2.19. they are forbidden to make war
against them. And so the seven Nations they were not to seek their good, but
yet upon submission they were to accept of them. Thirdly, there were the
Amalekites, and these they were utterly to destroy.

How the law of the destroying of the seven Nations is to be understood.
Rahab was saved, although she was a Canaanitish and one of the seven Nations
who were to be destroyed; for that law, that the seven Nations should be
destroyed, should be interpreted by another law, to wit, they were to be
destroyed, unless they had submitted themselves, and became tributaries unto
the people of God, Deuteronomy. 20.10. When thou come nigh a City to fight against
it, then proclaim peace unto it; and it shall be, if it make the answer of
peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be that all the people that are found
therein, shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. So 1 King.
9.26. And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizites,
Hivites, and Iebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, their
children which were left after them in the land, The Canaanites were
bond-slaues to Solomon.
whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those
did Solomon levy a tribute of bond service unto this day. And it was the
people of the seven Nations, who hardened their hearts, with whom Joshua took
not peace, Josh. 11.19.20.

When the Gibeonites came to Joshua, if they had told him the truth, that they
were a people that dwelt amongst them, and that they came not from a far
Country, but were Canaanites indeed, and came to seek their peace, (which
they did not for fear) then Joshua was bound to have spared their lives upon
their submission: and whereas the men of Israel said then, Peradventure ye
dwell among us, and how shall we make a league with you? Josh. 9.7. The
meaning is, we cannot make sociale faedus vobiscum, but only deditionis, that
is, Faedus Sociale. Deditionis.

we cannot make a covenant or league of mutual friendship with you, but we may
take you as servants and slaves, if ye submit your selves; Joshua might make a
league of peace with the Canaanites, but not of mutual friendship.
and if it had been simply unlawful to have made any sort of league with the
Canaanites, then the posterity of Saul would not have been punished for the
breach of this oath. Ambrose says well, Pacem quam dederant non censuerant
revocandam, quia firmata erat sacramenti religione, nedum alieni perfidiam
arguat, suam fidem solveret; that is, they held that it was not lawful to
break the oath that was made, least finding fault with other men's falsehood, he
should become perjured himself.

Joshua a type of Christ.
Joshua was a type of Christ; as Joshua sent messengers to the Canaanites to
receive either peace or war: so the Lord has sent his Faeciales into the
world, to bid them either receive peace or war; Rah^b a type of the Church.
and as Rahab held out a red thread to be a sign that whosoever remained in
her house, should be saved; and they who went out of it, should be killed: so
there is no salvation to those who are without the Church, which is marked with
the blood of Christ, Act. 2.47. Rahab being the first fruits of the Gentiles,
implied that the Gentiles should be received into the Church, and be saved.

CHAPTER X. Whether the Kingdom of Judah or Israel were the best Government?
IT may seem at the first, that the Kings of Israel did more formally proceed
by way of Justice, The Kings of Israel proceeded by way of Justice formally.
than the Kings of Judah did; the Kings of Israel did not proceed by way of
arbitrary Justice, neither was there any peremptory execution upon the will of
the King. When Naboth was to be stoned to death, the matter was handled after a
judicial form, which might have given satisfaction to the ignorant people,
who knew not the device and secrecy of the matter.

But the Kings of Judah proceeded by their absolute authority, as may appear
in some of them, The Kings of Judah proceeded by absolute authority.
who took away their Subjects lives by their absolute authority, without any
order of law, or process in Judgment. David killed the Amalekite; and again,
What things objected to David.
he seems to have broken his oath, swearing that nothing should befall
Shimei, and yet he bids his son Solomon put him to death; thou art a wise
man, Ioabs worthy deeds reckoned up. Ioab was David's kinsman.
and know what thou have to do, 1 King. 2. and so caused to kill Ioab who
was David's near kinsman, and who had undergone many dangers for the glory of
God and the good of the Church, 2 Samuel 10. He gave many things to the house of
the Lord.
And he dedicated many of the spoils which he had taken in the wars to the
house of the Lord, 1 Chro. 26.8. he fought for his Country all David's time; he
was faithful to the King, he stood for David against Saul, he followed him
still, although he was banished, and at that time when he was made Captain, 2 Samuel 18. Repressed the sedition of Sheba.
he did repress the sedition of Sheba, even when David would have put him from
his place, and put Amasa in his stead, 2 Samuel 20.4. Dissuaded David to number
the people.
It was he that forbad the King to number the people, 2 Samuel 24. It was he who
first invaded Sion, 1 Chronicles. 11. It was he who by his wisdom taught the woman
of Tekoa to obtain pardon for Absalom; Reconciled Absalom to his father.
It was he that was most skillful in the wars; It was he that fought against
the Syrians, and the Amorites, Subdued many wicked Nations.
and all the enemies of the Church; and it was he who in modesty when he had
gotten the victory, refused to take the praise to himself, but sent for the
King that he might get the praise of the victory, 2 Samuel 12.28. He was not
(...) or implacable; when Abner sought peace at him, he willingly granted it,
so did he to the people of Abel, 2 Samuel 20. He had good success in his wars.
He had good success in the wars, he was a terror to all his enemies, 2 Samuel
10. as to Hadarezer, the Edomites, etc. therefore it may seem that David by
his absolute authority, What things objected to Solomon.
caused him to be put to death unworthily. And as for Solomon, he seems most
unjustly to have killed his brother Adonijah; for first, he was David's eldest
son now alive; secondly, his father loved him most dearly; thirdly, he never
did find fault with him for seeking the Kingdom, and Solomon might seem here
to be too rigorous; Su^t^nius lib. 9.
for Titus a Heathen Prince was more merciful to his brother, Heathen Kings
loving to their brethren.
for when his brother did affect the Kingdom, yet notwithstanding he lovingly
embraced him, and dissuaded him from that course; and Seneca writes of the
like in his first book of Clemency, cap. 9. how Augustus spared Cinna, and
made him of a foe a friend.

David and Solomon Prophets.
But if we shall consider that the Kings of Judah, especially David and Solomon
being directed by the spirit of God immediately, had a better warrant to
proceed by their sole authority, David in killing the Amalekite sinned not.
than the Kings of Israel had, we shall be of another mind: and where it is
objected, that David killed the Amalekite only upon his own confession; When
one may be condemned upon his own confession.
the confession out of ones own mouth, if it be the confession of one that is
well at himself, and is not weary of his life, and if he stand constantly at
it, then the confession out of his own mouth is sufficient, Luke 19.22. Wicked
servant, out of thine own mouth will I judge thee. Secondly, this Amalekite
gloried that he had killed Saul, and so flattered David: and lastly, he was an
Amalekite, against whom the Lord had given out sentence long before, that they
should all be killed with the sword, and the Lord was wroth with Saul for
sparing the Amalekites.

David brake not his oath in causing Shimei to be killed.
The second thing objected to David, is the breaking of his oath in causing
Shimei to be killed, when he had sworn that nothing should befall him; but it
was not for his former railing that he was put to death, but for his new
transgression; David says to his son Solomon, Habes apud te, 2 Samuel 28. that
is, confine him, and suffer him not to go abroad; for he is a mighty man, and
is able to gather together a thousand of Benjamin, 2 Samuel 19.17. therefore
Solomon makes him to swear that he should never go beyond the brook Kedron
under the pain of death, and he most willingly assented unto it, yet he brake
his oath and went to seek his fugitive servant, and for the breach of this
oath, David commands to put him to death, and Solomon caused to execute him,
and after his first transgression, he is kept in ward here, and he is like a
fish taken upon the hook, Simile.
but yet not pulled out of the water to be dressed by the Cooks.

Solomon lays to his charge that sin which was forgiven him, 1 King. 2.42.
thou know what thou did to my Father David.

David and Solomon pardoned this sin but conditionally, that he should not
fall into a new sin; Shimei had his former fault pardoned conditionally.
and even as an old Cicatrix being healed, if it get a new blow, is more
dangerous than any other wound; so a fault pardoned, if the man fall into sin
again aggravateth the sin more; he was pardoned conditionally only, that he
should not transgress again.



Shimei how guilty of treason.
in setting light by the Kings commandment, and he bound himself by an oath,
if he did transgress.

As for the killing of Ioab, David sinned not in causing Solomon to kill Ioab.
all the commendations set down for his praise are nothing, if ye will
compare them with his foul offenses; that which he did for his Country makes
him not a good man; Ioabs vices.
his skill in military discipline, makes him not a good man, but a good
warrior; and justly he deserved death, for he would have had the Kingdom from
Solomon to Adonijah, hoping thereby to have gotten preferment under him; He
would have Adonijah to be King.
as Abner would have had the Kingdom from David to Ishbosheth, and from
Ishbosheth to David again, only for his own advancement: so would Ioab have
Adonijah to have the Kingdom, hoping thereby to get preferment to himself;
therefore he was not to be reckoned amongst the loyal and faithful Subjects
of the King.

And whereas the virtues are reckoned up, we shall find more vices than
virtues in him; first we shall see him delight to see one kill another, He
delighted to see men kill others.
which he thought to have been but a sport, 2 Samuel 2.14. And look to his
cruel murdering of Abner and Amasa, He killed Abner and Amasa.
he shed the blood of peace as it had been in war: and when Abner looked for
no such thing, he traitorously killed him, neither was he a white moved when he
was defiled with their blood, when he saw the blood both upon his girdle, and
his shoes, he gloried in it; and he was ready to kill Vrijah at the
commandment of the King; So he killed Absalom the Kings son, He killed
Absalom.
contrary to the Kings commandment. Wherefore Solomon being a Prince of peace,
Why Solomon killed Adonijah, Ioab, and Shimei.
would not have his servants turbulent like Ioab; but would have them, as
Christ would have his Disciples, not to seek fire from heaven to be revenged
upon the Samaritans, for then they knew not of what spirit they were, Luke 9.55.

Solomon sinned not in killing Adonijah.
Now for Salomons killing of Adonijah, we must not judge rashly of Solomon, who
had many excellent virtues in him; the great virtues which were in him,
meekness, Four chief virtues found in Solomon.
verity, fortitude, and justice, were the four Horses, as it were, which drew
his Chariot, Psalm. 45. First, Salomons meekness in sparing Adonijah.
his meekness, he was the Prince of peace, and therefore he pardoned Adonijah,
regnum au^picandum a clementia, for this procures the favor of his subjects;
so David would not kill Shimei in the beginning of his reign; but Rehoboam
that would not gratify the people in the beginning of his reign, his Kingdom
prospered not. Secondly, his verity; if thou be a good man, Salomons verity
in keeping his promise to Adonijah.
a hair of thy head shall not fall to the ground. Thirdly, his justice when he
failed again, Salomons fortitude and justice.
justly he caused to put him to death. Fourthly, his fortitude; although
Adonijah had a great faction which were against Solomon, yet he durst be bold
to cause to apprehend him: so Solomon for Adonijahs second transgression justly
caused to execute him, and we are not to measure his heavenly wisdom by the
moral virtues which are found in Titus and Augustus; Adonijah was guilty of
treason, How Adonijah was guilty of treason.
for he sought Abishaig only for that end, that he might get the Kingdom.
Secondly, he says, that the Kingdom belongs still to him; he was not like
good Jonathan, who willingly gave way to Gods ordinance, he knew well that the
Lord had appointed the Kingdom for Solomon, 2 Samuel 7. The son which shall
come out of thy loins, shall build thy house, and succeed in the Kingdom:
this was spoken after all his other sons were borne, and this aggravated all
the rest of his sins, that he affected the Kingdom, his father being yet
alive, and although his father was decrepit, yet he ruled by his Counselors,
and he was not weak in mind now although in body.

Wherefore we may conclude, Judah to be the best government, and still to be
preferred before the Kingdom of Israel.

CHAPTER XI. Whether the Jews might choose Herod for their King or not?
DEVT. 17.15. Thou may not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy
brother.
THe Jews distinguish those who were Gentiles both by father and mother, from
those who were borne Jews. Those who were strangers both by father and mother,
they called them Bagbag, by a contraction, (...) Filius Proselyti et Proselyta.
for Benger, and Bengerah, that is, filius proselyti and proselytae, and they
were called (...); but those who were Jews both by father and mother, were
called Hebraei ex Hebreaes, Phil. 3.5. an Hebrew of an Hebrew, that is, both by
father and mother they were Hebrews, and they were called (...), and (...).

Two sorts of Proselytes.
The Proselytes that were converted from Gentilisme to Iudaisme, were of two
sorts; if they were newly converted, they were called Gerim, which the Seventie
translate (...); (...) Extrantus (...) Inhabitans. (...) Inquilinus.
if they had dwelt long amongst them, then they were called Toshibhim,
inquilini, and the Seventie translate them (...), as ye would say,
Parishioners; such a stranger was Achir, Judith 14. who believed in God and was
circumcised.

Those Proselytes who were converted to the faith, and continued in the faith
of their Parents, (...) Gentilis fundamentalis. (...) Iudigena.
they were called [Goignikkere] Gentiles fundamentales, that is, Gentiles who
embraced the grounds of Religion, and these became [Ezrahhim] Indigenae.

When the Proselytes might enter into the Congregation.
These Proselytes although they were converted, yet they might not enter into
the Congregation until the third generation, that is, they might bear no
public charge until that time.

God himself distinguished the Edomite and the Egyptian from other strangers,
Deuteronomy. 23.7. Edomites and Egyptians distinguished from other strangers.
He will not have his people to account them as other strangers, Thou shall not
abhor an Edomite, because he is thy brother; and hence we may see, The
reasons why Herod might be King.
why the Jews might choose Herod for their King: First, because he was an
Idumean their brother; secondly, because he was the son of Parents who were
Proselytes, Antipar and Antipas both Proselytes: Thirdly, he himself was a Jew
by profession, and standing in the third generation, therefore he might enter
into the Congregation, and they might choose him for their King. Herodiani
certain wicked Jews took Herod for their Messiah, now if Herod had not been
accounted a Jew, they would never have acknowledged him for their Messiah.

The name of a Jew is taken sometimes largely, The name [Iew] taken strictly or
largely.
and sometimes strictly; when it is taken largely, it comprehends all which
were Jews by profession, Esth. 8.17. many became Jews.

Sometimes again it is taken more strictly for those Jews who dwelt on the
west side of Jordan, and they were called Iudaei Hierosolymitani, the Jews
that dwelt about Jerusalem, Luke 3.1. Pilate was governor of Judah, and Herod
of Galilie; Judah here is strictly taken; but sometimes Herod is called King of
the Jews, here it is largely taken, Mat. 2.1.

So the name [Gentile] is taken sometime strictly, The name (Gentile) taken
strictly or largely.
as Paul applies it to the converted Gentiles, Galat. 2.12. but when Christ
said, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, Mat. 10.5. Here it is taken
largely, for all the Gentiles.

Josephus calls Herod but a private man, Lib. 14 cap. 11. etc. 17.
therefore it may seem that the Jews never acknowledged Herod for their King,
and the Jews said of Herod, Quod non est rex, neque filius regis.

Why Herod was called a private man.
The reason why he was called a private man was this, because he was not
descended of the Priests; for at that time the posterity of David carried no
sway amongst the people, but only the posterity of the Priests, and whosoever
were not Priests, (...) Populus terra.
were called [Gnim haaretz] populus terrae, see Josephus lib. 14. cap. 12.

If ye will respect Herod's first descent, then he may be called Alienigena,
and not Iudaeus; in his first descent he is (...), and transcriptus, and his
Kingdom may be called Malcoth Hagerim, (...)
the reign of a stranger, but because Herod's father, and grandfather were not
altogether strangers from the people of God (for they were Edomites and
Proselytes) therefore he was not reckoned as a stranger: but it fell out
amongst the Jews, as it did amongst the Romans and Athenians, that those who
were (...), and adscriptitij, were always hated of those who were natural and
inbred Citizens: So the Jews hated those who were Proselytes, because of the
old hatred that was betwixt the Jews and the Gentiles; and they made a Canon
amongst them, Vt caverent sibi in decimam generationem a Proselytis.

Jews might safely choose Herod for their King now, being a Jew by profession,
and descended of Parents who were Jews by profession: and the latter Jews
distinguished not well betwixt Ger and Goi, who reckoned Herod ever to be a
stranger.

CHAPTER XII. Whether Ishbosheth was a Rebel in affecting the Kingdom or not?
2 Samuel 2.8. But Abner the son of Ner, Captain of Saul's Host, took
Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim, and he made him
King over Gilead, etc.
IT may be said of Ishbosheth, Their reasons who hold that Ishbosheth sinned
not in taking the Kingdom.
that he was no Rebel in accepting of the Kingdom after his father Saul was
dead; for first, he was his fathers eldest son now living; and by the law of
Nations, the first borne, or he that was in place of the first borne, did
succeed, The first borne by the law of Nations succeeded in the Kingdom.
Exodus 11.5. and 1 King. 2.15. And so amongst the Edomites, the first borne
succeeded in the Kingdom, 2 King. 3.27. he took his eldest son who should
have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall.

Secondly, Ishbosheth had the consent almost of all the people, for eleven
tribes acknowledged him for their King.

Thirdly, he had good success amongst his Subjects; The success that
Ishbosheth had.
first, in Mahanaim; then amongst the Giliadites; thirdly, amongst the
Ashurites; fourthly, in Izreel; fifthly, in Judah and Benjamin; and lastly, over
all Israel, 2 Samuel 2.9.

Fourthly, he reigned seven years amongst them, and by that it may seem, that
it was a settled Kingdom.

The thing that may be alleged against him is this, Mephibosheth was the son
of the eldest brother, and therefore by right should have succeeded before him.
But Mephibosheth was a lame man, creature, and was not fit for Government, and
therefore by right the Kingdom succeeded to Ishbosheth. Inst.
And if it be said, that David was appointed King by the Lord, we may say, that
Ishbosheth knew nothing of this, in bonafide: and moreover, David calls him a
righteous person, 2 Samuel 4.9. therefore it may seem that he did not usurp or
affect the Kingdom wrongfully.

Ishbosheth compared with Jeroboam in affecting the Kingdom.
Now let us compare Ishbosheths affecting of the Kingdom, and Ieroboams
affecting of the Kingdom; Jeroboam had the word of the Lord by Ahija the
Prophet that he should be King, and he confirmed it unto him by a sign, in
renting of the Cloak in twelve pieces, thus much he had from the Lord; but he
was a wicked and profane man, and got the hearts of the people rather by
coffeehouse and mutiny than by hearty good will, and herein Ishbosheth
far exceeded him.

Again, Ieroboams affecting of the Kingdom might seem to be a revenge; for
he fled away to Egypt from Solomon as a traitor, and now to be revenged upon
his son, he draws away the ten Tribes from him, and so Ishbosheths entering
to the Kingdom seems to be better than his.

Ishbosheth notwithstanding of all that is said for him cannot be excused; he
was his fathers eldest son, but the Kingdom goes not always by succession,
Ishbosheth cannot be excused for affecting the Kingdom.
it pleases God to change this form sometimes, as David was chosen King and
not his eldest brother, and so was Solomon chosen and not Adonijah. And if it
had come by succession, then Mephibosheth should have succeeded and been
preferred before him, for although he was lame in his feet, yet he was not
lame in his mind. And where it is said, that he had the consent of all the
people, their consent is nothing without the consent of the superior God
himself, by me Kings reign, Pro. 8.9. God had declared long before, Saul
could not be ignorant that David should be King.
that Saul should not reign, but that David should reign, and Jonathan gave
way to it, therefore he could not be ignorant of this, but being blinded by
presumption, and misled by crafty Abner (who thought in effect to be King
himself) he affected the Kingdom. And whereas David calls him a righteous
person; Iustitia causae. personae.

we must distinguish inter justitiam causae, and justitiam personae, betwixt
the righteousness of his cause, and the righteousness of his person, although
he was otherwise a good man, yet he had not a good cause in hand; and if we
shall join his cause and his death together, we may think that it was a just
punishment of his Rebellion; for he was murdered by Baanah and Rechab upon his
bed in his bedchamber, 2 Samuel 4.7.

The conclusion of this is; Fear God, honor the King. 1 Pet. 2.17.

CHAPTER XIII. Whether it was lawful for the Jews to pay tribue to Caesar or
not?
MAT. 22.17. Tell us therefore, what think thou? Is it lawful to pay
tribute to Caesar?
THe Jews who were a people always subject to rebellion and mutiny, The
Jews a people prone to rebellion.
propounded this question to Christ, Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to
Caesar or not? The speech of the Jews in defense of their liberty.
As if they should say, we have always been a free people, to whom many
Nations have paid tribute; we are a people who are commanded to pay our tithes
and first fruits only to the Lord. The Lord commanded us to choose a King of
our selves and not a stranger, Deuteronomy. 17. How shall we then pay to Caesar who is
but a stranger? Caesar has taken us violently, and made us captives, and daily
his Publicans most unjustly oppress us; how then shall we pay tribute to him?
and shall we give him this penny which has an Image upon it, contrary to the
law of God which forbids Images? And when we pay this ways head by head
this penny to him, it makes the Romans insult over us, as if we were
negligent of the worship of our God, and worshippers of a false God. Who can
abide to see how these Romans have abused, and do still abuse the Temple of
God? And how Pompey and Crassus have robbed the Temple? And how they exact of
us that penny that should be paid only to the Lord? And if any Nation in the
world have a privilege to free themselves from the slavery and bondage of
strangers, most of all have we Jews, who are Gods peculiar people; and we
would gladly know, Master, what is thy judgment in this case, and we will
stand to thy determination; if thou bid us give it, we will give it; but if
thou forbid us, we will stand to our liberty, and vindicate our selves, as the
Macchabees our Predecessors have done. The Pharisees with the Herodians sought
to entrap Christ.
The Herodians came here with the Pharisees to Christ, waiting what word might
fall from him; If Christ should have answered any thing contrary to the Roman
power, then the Herodians would have fallen upon him; or if he had said at the
first, give this tribute to Caesar, then the Jews would have fallen upon him,
as an enemy to their liberty. So they think to ensnare him what way soever he
answered. But the Lord who catches the crafty in their own craft, does
neither answer affirmatively nor negatiuely, but faith, Why tempt ye me? show
me a penny, and he asked them, whose Image and superscription is upon the
penny? they say Caesar's; then our Lord infers, that they were bound to pay
it unto Caesar. And Christ reasoned thus; Those which are Caesar's, and belong
not unto God, should be given to Caesar; but this penny is such; therefore it
should be given to Caesar. The Assumption is proved, because tribute belongs
to the Conqueror, and he coyneth the money, and puts his Image upon it, in
token of his Dominion over the Subjects, and they should pay it unto him as a
token of their subjection.

Show me a penny. This was not the penny which was commanded to be paid to the
Lord yearly.

The Jews paid a threefold half shekell to the Lord. The Jews under the Law
paid a threefold half shekell.
The first was called Argentum animarum, Exodus 30.2. which every one paid for
the redemption of his life. The second was Argentum transeuntis, that is, the
half shekell which they paid to the Lord, when they were numbered head by
head, 2 King. 12.5. The third was that half shekell which they offered freely
unto the Lord. This half shekell had Aarons rod upon the one side, and the pot
with Manna upon the other; and when they were under the Romans, or captives
under any other foreign Princes, the Masters of their Synagogues used to
gather this half shekell of them yearly, and send it to Jerusalem to the high
Priest. This was not the penny which Caesar craved of them, This tribute which
Caesar exacted was not the half shekell which was due to the Lord.
for it had Caesar's Image and superscription upon it. Neither would the Lord
have bidden them give that to Caesar, which was due to God.

This Didrachma which they paid to Caesar was as much in value, as the half
shekell; and Christ himself although he was free and the Kings son, Christ
paid this tribute.
yet he paid it for himself and for Peter, Mat. 17.27. And so Mary when
Christ was in her womb went to Bethlehem to pay this tribute to Caesar. Luke
2.5.

This Image set upon Caesar's money was not contrary to that, thou shall not
make to thy self any graven Image; for it was not made for a religious use,
but for a civil use.

This penny which Caesar exacted of the Jews was but Denarius, (Denarius,
Didrachma, and Numisma, were all one) this Denarius was the ordinary hire of a
workman for a day, Mat. 20.2. and the daily wages of a Soldier, as Tacitus
says. What if the Roman Emperor had exacted as much of them as Pharaoh did
of their Predecessors? What if he had done to them as Solomon did to their
Predecessors in his old age? or as Rehoboam did to them, whose little finger
was heavier than his fathers loins? What ingratitude was this for them to
grudge for paying so little a tribute to the Emperor who kept them in peace,
Caesar was more mild to the Jews than Pharaoh or Rehoboam.
who kept Legions, and Garrisons of Soldiers, to defend them from the Arabians
and Parthians? he did not make them to work in brick and clay, as the
Egyptians did their predecessors, neither took he their liberties from them;
he permitted them to keep their Sabboths, He permitted them to use their
liberties.
Circumcision, and their Synedria, their Synagogues, and (...); and Dion
testifies of Augustus, that when he gave commandment to take tribute of the
Jews, that it should not be taken from them upon their Sabbath, but they
should delay it till the next day. Now for all these benefits had they not
reason to pay this tribute to Caesar?

Men should not repine after they are become subject.
Men may defend themselves and stand for their liberty, but when they are once
conquered, no place to repine. Agrippa (as Josephus testifies) in his speech
to the Jews, who were called Zelotae for their preposterous desire that they
had to free themselves from subjection to the Romans, said unto them after
this manner, Intempestivum est nunc libertatem concupiscere, olim ne ea
amitteretur, certatim eportuit; nam servitutis periculum facere, durum est; and
ne id subeatur, honesta certatio est, at qui semel subactus, despicit; non
libertatis amans ducendus est, sed servus contumax; that is, it is our of time
now to desire your liberty, ye should have rather long since striven not to
have lost it; for it is a hard thing to undergo servitude, and it is a lawful
strife to withstand it; but when a man is once overcome and yielded himself,
and then rebelleth, he is not said to be a lover of his liberty, but to be a
rebellious subject. And Josephus says, Qui victi sunt and longo tempore
paruerunt, si jugum rejecerint, faciunt quod desperatorum hominum est, and non
quod libertatis amantium est, those who are once overcome and have served a
long time, if they shake off the yoke, they play the part of desperate men, and
not of those who love their liberty.

Now let us conclude this; Caesar that which is Caesar's, Math. 22. Homo est
nummus Dei, because he carries Gods Image, Man is Gods penny, stamped with his
Image.
give to him that penny which was lost, Luke 16. Light the Candle, sweep the
house, find it out, and give to him: and give unto Caesar that which is
Caesar's. Pro. 24.21. Fear God and honor the King. Give not divine honor to
the King, as the Herodians did, who cried the voice of God and not of man. Say
not, Divisum Imperium cum Jove Caesar habet, neither under pretext of Religion,
withdraw that from the King which is due unto him, as the Essaeni did, and the
Pharisees would have done, but keep an equal midst betwixt them both, and
remove not the ancient marks, Prove. 23.10.

CHAPTER XIIII. Whether Naboth might have justly denied to sell his Vineyard to
Ahab, or not?
1 King 21.3. And Naboth said to Ahab, the Lord forbid it me, that I should
give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
NABOTH justly refused to sell his Vineyard to Ahab, it being his fathers
inheritance; no man in Israel might sell his inheritance, because the
Israelites were but the Lords (...), or Farmers, the inheritance was the Lords,
The Israelites might not sell their land simple.
Levit. 25.23. the Land shall not be sold for ever, for the Land is mine, for
ye are strangers and sojourners with me; therefore it was called Emmanuels
Land, Esaias 8.8. All that the Israelites might do was this, they might morgage
their land, but simply they might not sell it, because the Inheritance was the
Lords.

Iere. 32.9. I bought the field of Hanameel my Uncles son that was in
Anatboth, and I weighed him the money for it, even seventeene shekels of silver.

Jeremiah gave for this field in Anathoth (being but seventeene shekels) it may
be gathered that this was not a simple alienatio^ of the ground, Hanameel did
not sell his land, but morgaged it to Jeremiah.
but only a morgaging of it; wherefore his uncle or his uncles children might
have redeemed this land from Jeremiah, and Jeremiah was bound to have restored
this Land to them again: neither does the public writing of this Instrument
prove the selling of the Land simply, and the full dominion of it, but utile
dominium for the time, as he who has a piece of Land in morgage, may morgage
it again to another, but not simply sell it.

But it may be said, David bought the inheritance of mount Moriah from Arauna
the Iebusite, therefore the simple right of the ground might be sold.

It was permitted to the Jews to sell a house within a walled City, What
houses or land the Jews might sell.
and the Gardens or Orchards belonging unto it; but they might not sell their
grounds and Vine-yards, neither the houses nor the villages which have no walls
round about them, for they were reckoned as the fields in the Country.
Secondly, this Hill Moria which was sold, was sold by a Iebusite, and not by an
Israelite; and the ceremonial Laws of the Jews obliged not the Iebusites.
Thirdly, this was an extraordinary case, this ground was sold for the building
of the Temple, and David would not have it without a price.

It may be said, pieces of silver and bought a Potters field with it to bury
strangers in, Mat. 27.7. therefore they might sell a field, for they bought
this field to bury strangers in it.

First, this field was not a fruitful field, Joseph of Arimathea being of
another tribe than those of Jerusalem (for Arimathea, or Rama was in the tribe
of Ephraim; but a great part of Jerusalem, with Mount Calvarie and Joseph's
Garden, wherein he had his Tomb, was in the tribe of Benjamin) yet he bought a
Garden being near Jerusalem, and the Hill Calvarie, because it was a thing
which belonged to the house within the walled City.

If a man might not sell his inheritance in Israel, Judah and Israel had
Orchards and Gardens, and places of burial proper to themselves, which was a
part of their peculium, or proper right.

Naboth said well, God forbid it me that I should sell my fathers inheritance:
they were but usufructuarij, but the Lord was Dominus fundi, and he that has
no right to himself, cannot make a right to another.

Why might they sell their houses within a walled City, and not their fields
and grounds in the Country? Levit. 25.13.

The reason why they might sell their houses within the walled Cities.
The reason was this, they might not sell their grounds, that their possessions
might be kept still distinct; but because many came to dwell in the walled
Cities, and the houses were not so distinguished as the grounds and Vineyards,
therefore they might sell them: this was also done in favor of the Proselytes,
that they might have a dwelling amongst the people of God.

Israelites when they morgaged their Land, they had not power simply to sell
it, because the property was the Lords; therefore it was to return unto him
in the year of the Iubile: So, although the children of God morgage their part
of the heavenly Canaan, yet because the right is the Lords, it shall return to
them in the year of that great Iubile.

CHAPTER XV. Whether the Jews should be tolerated in a Christian Commonwealth
or not?
ROMANS 11.23. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
graffed in: for God is able to graffe them in again.
THere may be many reasons alleged, why this sort of people should not be
tolerated amongst Christians.

First, if ye respect their profession and Religion, they are to be secluded
from us Christians; and secondly, in respect of their dealing with us in their
civil contracts and bargaining.

As for their Religion. First, they detest us Christians who profess Christ,
for Christ's cause. Secondly, they hold many damnable and blasphemous opinions
concerning Christ; first, for his forerunner John the Baptist; secondly, they
hate Marie the Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ; thirdly, they oppose themselves
against Christ's natures; fourthly, against his Offices, King, Priest, and
Prophet; fifthly, against his death upon the cross; sixthly, against his
resurrection; seventhly, they oppose themselves to his imputed righteousness;
and lastly, to his Gospel, and they expect a glorious Messiah to come.

First, in detestation of Christ, they detest us Christians, they call us
[Goijm] Gentes and Edomites, (...) vastavit.
and when they would welcome a Christian, they say welcome Shed, that is,
Devil, The Jews detest Christians.
hinking that the common people understand not the word; and they curse us
Christians daily, anathema sit externis in serpente, that is, they wish that we
who are without their society, may be execrable as the Serpent.

But they detest those most of all who are converted from Iudaisme to
Christianity, and they pray three times in the day against them, morning,
midday, and evening, and thus they pray, Ne sit quies Apostatis, neque spes.

The Jews expect Elias to come.
Secondly, they expect Elias Tishbites to be the forerunner of their Messiah;
and when they cannot resolve their hard questions to their Scholars, they say,
Tishbi solvet nodos, (...)
that is, when Elias Tishbites shall come, he will resolve all doubts, but
Elias is come already, and they have done to him whatsoever they listed, Math.
17.12.

They hate Marie the Mother of Christ, and they call her [Mara] bitterness,
and the herb called Herba Mariae, by them is called Herba suspensi, because
Marie bare Christ, who was crucified upon the Cross: so a piece of money
called grossa Mariae, they called it in despite, grossa suspensi.

The Jews deny the two natures of Christ.
Then they deny the two natures of Christ, for they deny his Godhead, inceptum
est nomen Iehova profanari. Targum Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth it thus, illi
caeperunt idola colere, and fecerunt sibi Deos erroneos, quod cognominabant de
sermon domini, he understands here blasphemously Christ, calling him Deum
erroneum, whom the Scripture call (...). Of old they said Deus sanctus and
domus Iudicij ejus fecerunt hominem, by the house of Judgment they meant the
trinity of persons, for all the inferior house of Judgment consisted of three,
and they said Duorum non est judicium, so the Chaldie paraphrast paraphraseth
the trinity of persons by this paraphrase; but now, the Jews do set
themselves against this, and they deny it flatly.

They set themselves against his offices; The Jews set themselves against the
offices of Christ.
he was anointed King, Priest, and Prophet [Hameshiah] that excellent Prophet,
but in detestation of Christ, they will not call their Tardigradum, or
slow-comming Christ Messiah, but (...) delibutum, they hate so the name of
Christ.

They mock the Kingly office of Christ, Mat. 27.19. they put a crown of
thorns upon his head for a crown; and they put a reed in his hand for a
Scepter: So they mock his Priestly office, he saved others, let him save
himself, Verse. 40. and his Prophetical office, Prophecy thou O Christ, who
is he that smites thee. Mat. 26.68.

So they mock his death, and his crucifying upon the Cross, they call Christ's
cross the Woofe and the Warpe, and so mystically when they speak one to
another amongst Christians, they call Christ the Woofe and the Warpe.

They deny the resurrection of Christ, Mat. 28.15. and it is noysed abroad
amongst them unto this day, that Jesus Christ was stolen away by his Disciples,
and that he did not rise again.

So they oppose his imputed righteousness, and they say, that every fox must
pay his own skin to the flayer, and they say, sit mors mea expiatio cunctarum
transgressionum mearum.

And lastly they oppose themselves against his Gospel, they call (...) [Aven
gilajon] nuntium vanum. (...)


Secondly, if ye will respect their dealing with us in civil matters: they are
worthy to be secluded from the society of Christians.

They care not to forswear themselves to us Christians, they are most
merciless usurers in exacting from the Christians, and they who profess
Physic amongst them, care not to poison Christians, whom they call [Goijm,]
Gentiles.

And if we shall add further, that no false Religion should be tolerated, and
the Lord commanded heretics to be put to death, how then should they be
suffered in a Christian Commonwealth?

What Jews may be sufsered in a Commonwealth, and who not.
But we must put a difference betwixt these miscreants who rail against the
Lord Jesus Christ, and blaspheme his name; and those poor wretches who live in
blindness yet, but do not rail blasphemously against Christ; those we should
pity: The reasons that should move us to pity the Jews.
First, we should pity them for their fathers cause the Patriarchs. Secondly,
we should pity them, because Christ is come of them who is blessed for ever;
thirdly, the Oracles of God were committed to them, Romans 3.2. and the law was
the inheritance of Jacob, Deuteronomy. 33.4. they were faithful keepers of the same
to others, and they were like a lantern who held out the light to others,
although they saw not with it themselves. Fourthly, when we Gentiles were out
of the Covenant they prayed for us, Cant. 8.8. We have a little sister, what
shall we do for her? So when they are out of the Covenant; We have an Elder
brother, Luke 16. what shall we do for him? And lastly, because of the hope of
their conversion, that they shall be graffed in again, Romans 11.

Some Christian Commonwealths admit them, but with these Caveats.









these Caveats, sundry Commonwealths have admitted them.

CHAPTER XVI. Of the Synedrion of the Jews.
MAT. 5.22. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause, shall be in danger of the Judgment, and whosoever shall say
to his brother Raca, shall be in danger of the Council.
THis word, Synedrion, is a greek word, but changed and made a Syriack word,
(...), are sitters in judgment, and Sanhedrin, are the Judges who sat in the
Council, and the place it self was called Synedrion.

In the Syriack, Domus judiciorum, The difference betwixt Domus judiciorum and
Domus Iudicum.
and Domus Iudicum differunt: Domus judiciorum is the house where the
Counselors met, and Domus Iudicum according to the Syriack and Chaldy phrase,
(...) Domus Iudicum. (...) Domus judicij.
signifies the Judges themselves. So the Chaldees when they express the
Trinity, they call it Domus Iudicij, because there were three that sat in
their lesser Iudicatorie; and when Beth dina signifies the Judges themselves,
it has the point above judh, but when it signifies the place of Judgment, it
has the point under judh.

There were two sorts of these Synedria amongst the Jews, the great Council
and the lesser, the great Council was called ^anhedrin Gedolah, (...)
and the lesser was called Sanhedrin Ketannah.

The great Synedrion sat at Jerusalem only, the lesser Synedria sat in other
places also, and they were called (...), judicia.

Allusion. Vide Guilel^ Schickardum de jure regio, and Ludovic: de Dieu.
The great Synedrion sat in Jerusalem only, and Christ alludeth to this, Mat.
23.37. A Prophet might not die out of Jerusalem. So, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
which killest the Prophets, Mat. 23.37. The great Synedrion judged only of a
Prophet.

The great Synedrion divided into five parts.
But Gabinius the Proconsul of Syria, divided this great Synedrion which sat
only at Jerusalem into five parts, whereof he placed one at Jerusalem, another
in Gadara, the third in Amathus toward the red Sea, the fourth in Jericho, and
the fifth he placed in Sephra in Galilie. And Christ meant of these Councels
when he says, they will deliver you up to the Councels, Mat. 10.17. At this
time the great Synedrion was divided into five parts.

They shall deliver you up to the Councels, and they will scourge you in their
Synagogues; What meant by Synagogues and Councels.
by their Synagogues he meant their Ecclesiastical Iudicatories, and by the
Councels their civil.

The number that sat in this great Iudicatorie were seventie and two, six
chosen out of every tribe; but for making the number round, they are called
Seventie: the Scripture uses sometimes when the number is not full, Retundatio
numeri quid?
to express the full number, as Judge. 11.5. Abimelech killed his brethren
which were threescore and ten persons, there were but threescore and nine of
them, for Iotham fled. So Genesis 42.13. Thy servants are twelve brethren, the
sons of one man; although Joseph was thought to be dead, yet, to make up the
number, because he had once twelve sons, they are called the twelve sons of
Jacob. So Number. 14.33. And your children shall wander in the Wilderness forty
years, according to the number of the days that the Spies searched the Land;
this was spoken to them two years after they came out of Egypt; yet the number
is made up here, and it is called forty years. So 1 Cor. 15.5. He was seen
of the twelve; there were but eleven of them at this time, for Judas was dead,
and Matthias was not chosen as yet; yet he calls them twelve, because they
were once twelve, to make up the number. Sometimes again although there be more
for making round the number, they take away some, as Luke 10.1. the Syriack
has it, the seventie two Disciples, yet it is translated the seventie
Disciples. So the Seventie two who translated the Bible, are called the
Seventie.

The Lord charged Moses to gather Seventie of the Elders of Israel, Moses said,
how shall I do this? If I shall choose six out of every Tribe, then there
shall be sixty and two; The uncertain conjecture of Sol: Iarchi concerning
their Election of the Seventie.
and if I shall choose but five out of every Tribe, then there will be ten
wanting; and if I shall choose six out of one Tribe, and but five out of
another Tribe, that will breed but strife amongst them. What does he then? He
made choice of six out of every Tribe, and he brought forth seventie two
blanke papers; upon seventie of the papers, (...) Senex.
he wrote [Zaken] senex; and upon the two that remained, he wrote [Hhelek]
pars. (...) Pars.
Now when the Tribes drew their Lots out of the Box, he who drew [Zaken]
senex, Moses said unto him, Antea sanctificavit te deus benedictus; but he who
drew [Hhelek] pars, he said unto him, Non cupit te deus. The Hebrews say, that
Eldad and Medad, Number. 11.26. were of those who were written, but they went not
out into the Tabernacle, because they drew [Hhelek] pars; but not [Zaken]
senex, they were inter conscriptos (say they) but not inter electos; and so the
number seventie is made up without them.

There were two Presidents in this Council; Two Presidents in the Council.
(...) Princeps.
the first chosen in respect of his power, dignity, and wisdom, and he was
called [Nashi] princeps, and [Rosh hajeshibhah] Pater consessus, (...) Pater
Consessus.
and he it was (as the Jews say) that succeeded Moses, The order how they sat
in Judgment.
who was the principal and the chief in the Council; and upon his right hand
sat he who was greatest amongst the seventie, and he was called [Abh beth din]
pater consistorij; (...) Pater Consistorij.
the rest sat according to their dignity and age next to the Prince; and they
sat in a circuit or a half Moon, that both the Presidents might have them in
their sight.

The time when they sat in these Iudicatories.
The time when they sat; the great Iudicatorie sat every day except on the
Sabbath, and festival days; and when they sat, the little Synedrion sat but
from the morning Sacrifice until the sixth hour, that is, until our twelve;
but the great Synedrion sat from the morning Sacrifice until the evening
Sacrifice, that is, until our three of the clock in the afternoon.

What matters were judged in the great Synedrion.
The matters which they judged in this Iudicatorie, were matters of greatest
weight; as to judge of a false Prophet, when to make wars, appointing
Magistrates for inferior Cities; so for cutting off of a Tribe, and punishing
the high Priest, and whether an Apostate City should be raised and cast down
or not; and they say, that none might give the bitter waters to the woman
suspected of Adultery but this Iudicatorie, Number. 5.29. So they say, when a man
was killed, and the killer not known, none might measure from the place where
the man was killed to the next City, Deuteronomy. 21.7. but the Elders of the great
Synedrion, this case was only tried by them; So the raising up seed to his
brother, and pulling off his shoe, if he refused, these were tried by the great
Synedrion.

Bellarmines argument to prove the Pope to be above secular Judges.
Bellarmine the Jesuit to prove the Pope to be above secular Judges, alleges
Deuteronomy. 17.12. The man that does presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the
Priest, and to the Judge, even that man shall die. Here he says, the
Magistrate does only execute the sentence of the Priest.

But first, ex decreto judicis, is not in the original, according to the
sentence of the Law, Deuteronomy. 17.11. and the word should be read disjunctive, He
that hearkeneth not unto the Priest or unto the Judge, etc. And by the Priest
here is understood, not only the high Priest, but other Priests, Verse. 9. When
the high Priest and the Judges sat together, then he that hearkened not to the
sentence given by the Judge, and interpreted by the Priest, was to die; so he
who hearkened not unto the Judge, although the Priest was not there, was to
die; for these Iudicatories which are conjoined, are sometimes distinguished.
Deuteronomy. 17.12. 2 Chro. 19.8. and they must be interpreted respectively, as the
Lawyers speak.

In the lesser Iudicatorie, When they might judge of capital crimes in the
lesser Iudicatorie.
they might not judge of a capital crime, unless they were twenty three a
full number, so they judged of a beast that had killed a man or lien with a
woman, to be put to death, Levit. 20.16.

The seventie whom Moses chose now at the commandment of the Lord, Number. 11.25.
The difference betwixt the seventie which Moses chose, and the seventie which
were chosen at the direction of Iethro.
differed from the seventie whom he chose at the commandment of Iethro, Exodus
18. they excelled the former seventie far in gifts, for they had the spirit of
Moses upon them, and as the Mantle of Elijah when it was put about Elisha, then
the spirit came upon him; The spirit of Moses was not diminished when it was
put upon the seventie.
so came the spirit of Moses upon the seventie; and the spirit of Moses was not
diminished when it came upon the seventie, but the spirit of Moses in that
hour was like the middle lamp of the Candlestick, from the middle Lamp the
rest were lighted, but the light of this Lamp was not diminished: so the spirit
of Moses was not diminished when it came upon the seventie. Moses spirit of
judgment was upon them all, but not his other gifts; as Moses was mighty in
words and deed, but not they. Moses was the meekest man in the world, but not
they. One Moses ruling in a Council will make it famous, but to have seventie
like Moses sitting in a Council, (for they had the same spirit of ruling which
Moses had) that made it to excel all the Councels in the world, even Areopagus
in Athens, and the Senate in Rome, and if we shall mark the unity that was in
this Council, then we shall more admire it.

Seventie this gift of Prophecy continually or not?

Prophetarunt and non addiderunt, i.e. prophetare; The seventy which Moses
chose had not this gift of Prophecy continually.
and so the phrase is used by the Hebrews, Genesis 8.12. Non addidit redire, She
returned not again; so 1 Samuel 15. Non addidit Samuel redire ad Saulem, that
is, he saw him no more; so Prophetarunt et non addiderunt, that is, they
prophesied that day and no more.



CHAPTER XVII. Whether a Judge is bound to give sentence according to things
prooved and alleged, or according to his own private knowledge?
EXODUS 23 1. Thou shall not receive a report; put not thine hand with the
wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
The opinion of some concerning the proceeding of a Judge sce^na^^ allegata and
probata.
Sundry do hold, that a Judge must not judge contrary to that which he knows,
whatsoever is alleged or proved to the contrary; for whatsoever is not of
faith is sin, Romans 14.23. that is, if a man do a thing against his
conscience, it is sin; Wherefore, if a Judge know a man to be innocent, and
yet evidences be brought in against him that he is guilty; then they hold that
the Judge should use all means to free the innocent man; as first, he should
deal with the accuser not to proceed in his accusation, and should signify
unto him, that he knows well the innocence of the party. Secondly, if this
cannot help, then he is bound publicly to testify upon the Bench, the
innocence of the party, and he may defer the giving out of sentence, unless
he be charged by a superior; but if the matter have no success that way, then
he may remit him to a superior Judge, or will the party accused to appeal to
a superior Judge; but if he cannot prevail any of these ways, some do will
him rather to quite his place, than to give out such a sentence against the
innocent.

Although the light of nature it self, and the word of God both teach us, that
the life of the innocent is to be maintained; yet when another law of greater
force comes in, then this must give place; Why a Judge must proceed according
to things proved.
for reason it self teaches us, that a Judge is to proceed according to
things proved, otherwise justice could not be preserved, and the good of the
whole, is to be preferred before the good of a private man.

But it may be said,

To kill an innocent man accidentally, How a Judge sins in giving out
sentence against an innocent person.
this is not a sin to him; but if he should of purpose kill an innocent man,
that indeed were a sin contrary to the law; and even as in just war, when
the victory cannot be had otherwise unless there be innocent men killed, as
well as the guilty, yet they may be safely killed, because the war is just
war, and secondly, because it is not their intention directly to kill the
innocent, but because otherwise the victory could not be obtained: So a Judge
is bound to proceed according to that which is proved, and if he kill the
innocent man, it is beside his intention; for his intention is here to do
justice, and not to kill the innocent, and he is bound to prefer the
universal good, before the particular.

Pilate was in condemning Christ?

Pilate was an unjust Judge, because he pronounced false sentence against
Christ who was innocent, How Pilate sinned in giving sentence against Christ.
and this might have been known Iuridice, because they were not (...), their
testimonies agreed not, as the Evangelist Mark says, Chap. 14.59.

Titius, whom Titius in his conscience knows not to be his wife; although the
Judge should command Titius to do the duty of an husband to her, yet Titius
should rather suffer any punishment, than to perform that duty to her,
because he knows her not to be his wife. So etc.

intrinsece malum, Malum intrinsece. per accidens.

evil in the own nature of it, and that which is but accidentally evil; to
commit whoredom is simply evil, but when the Judge condemns the innocent
man whom he knows to be innocent, he does not give out sentence against the
man, because he is innocent, (for that were simply sin) but because he is
bound to execute judgment; and here the Judge proceeds as a public person;
but Titius is a private person only, and therefore he is bound to do
according to his knowledge.

and he should conclude for him that is heretical, yet I am not bound to
follow his sentence.

A Judge when he condemns a man according to the law, he makes not a lie, as
when he says, A Judge when he gives out sentence upon an innocent person, he
makes not a lie. Object.
such a proposition is true, when it is false; and in matters divine, he is not
a Judge as he is in the civil Court.

But if a Judge should be urged in his conscience, and posed, is this an
innocent man or not? if he should answer and say, he is not, then he should
answer contrary to his knowledge.

As a Judge, he must answer that he is not innocent; The sentence of the Judge
is the sentence of public authority.
and the sentence of a Judge is the sentence of public authority, and when he
judges so, he does not against his conscience; and here we must distinguish
betwixt his speculatiue and practick knowledge; Scientia speculativa. practica.

although he be innocent according to private and speculatiue knowledge, yet he
is guilty according to the course of the Law and public authority.

He that is innocent should not be condemned;

in judicio speculativo, A man innocent in speculatiue judgment and yet
guilty in practical judgment.
but not injudicio practico; but turn it this way, he that is guilty in
judicio practico should die, but this man is guilty in judicio practico;
therefore he should die.

If a man should produce an Instrument privately to a Judge, a Judge could not
proceed upon this, because he saw such a thing, if it were not publicly
produced in Judgment; this knowledge which he has by the sight of this
Instrument privately, he had it not as a Judge, but as a private man. So etc.

Whether is the Executioner bound to execute the man, whom he knows to be
unjustly condemned?

He is not the Interpreter of the Law; part of the Judge, Whether the
Executioner be bound to execute one that is condemned being innocent.
but he is only to execute the sentence pronounced by the Judge: but if he
should know the sentence to be false which is given out upon the innocent man,
then he should absolutely refuse and say, It is better to obey God than man,
Act. 4.19. He is bound to obey his superior in a good cause, and in a
doubtful cause; but not in that which he knows altogether to be false.



which is not of faith is sin, Romans 14.23. That is, whatsoever he does
against his conscience.



CHAPTER XVIII. An partus sequitur ventrem?
GENESIS 21.10. Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the
bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.
GOD who is the God of order, and not of confusion, has debarred the children
from sundry privileges for their fathers sins.

The children of Heathen Parents were not admitted to the Covenant, until they
became Proselytes.
First, if both the Parents were Heathen, the Lord secluded the children from
the Covenant, and they were not circumcised, until they became Proselytes, and
they were not circumcised nomine Parentum, in the name of their fathers, but
when they embraced the faith and were converted.

Secondly, If both the Parents were Jews, and did not beget their children in
wedlock, then the children were secluded from the inheritance, Judge. 11.2.
Thou shall not inherit with us, because thou art the son of a strange woman.

Thirdly, If an Israelite had married a bondwoman, then the children were
secluded from the inheritance, although their fathers were free; those who were
borne of Handmaids were always reputed servants; and God applied this to
Christ himself as he was man, Esaias 49.5. I have called my servant from the
womb; so Esaias 42.1. Behold my servant whom I uphold, my Elect in whom my soul
is well pleased. Christ as man was a servant.
Marie called her self the Lords handmaide. Luke 1.28. therefore Christ as man
borne of Marie the hand-maide, was a servant.

But ye will say,

In Physical mixtures it is so, In Physical mixtures, things take their
denomination from the better part.
this is rather like that which is spoken in the Schools, Conclusio sequitur
deteriorem partem, if any of the premises be particular, so is the conclusion.

The Doctors of the Jews propound this case, if a Heathenish captive woman
were taken in the Wars, she is converted and becomes a Proselyte; whether
should her child be judged to be a free man or not in Israel? And they
answer, that this child borne of this stranger, is not to be counted a free
man, Verum Senatus suo decreto Lustrari eum tantum curat, H. Melahh. 8.9.
they cause only to wash him, but they will not circumcise him, until he be
able to make confession of his faith, and become a Proselyte; and here they
say, Partus sequitur ventrem, if the mother had been a free woman, either
before, or after the birth amongst the Romans, the child was reputed to be
free; but not so amongst the people of the Jews. Wherefore the Judges in
Israel willed all true Israelites, not to match themselves unequally in
degrees, for the disgrace which it brought upon their children, making them
incapable of freedom, and unfit to be heirs.

Conclusion. Difference betwixt the Judicial Law and the Covenant of grace.
The conclusion of this is: Here we may see the excellency of the Covenant of
grace above the Judicial Law; for if any of the Parents be faithful, then the
child is holy, 1 Cor. 7.14. that is, he may be admitted to the Covenant.

CHAPTER XIX. An error personae irritat contractum?
JOSH. 8.18. And the children of Israel smote them not, because the Princes of
the Congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel.
IT may seem that Error personae irritat contractum, as if a man married one
woman in stead of another, the marriage is nullified.

Isaacs blessing, who blessed Jacob in stead of Esau? and yet the blessing was
effectual; and what shall we think of Joshua's Covenant made with the
Gibeonites, whom he took to be strangers? and yet the Covenant stood firm and
sure; and what shall we say of Jacobs marriage with Leah in stead of Rachel?
Here the marriage was not irritat and made void, although there was an error
in the person.

First, Jacobs marriage with Leah in stead of Rachel, if Jacob had not
afterward approved this marriage, Of Jacobs marriage with Leah.
and gone in unto her, and begotten children upon her, the marriage had been
void; but because he went in unto her, and begot children upon her, this error
was taken away.

Secondly, it may be answered for Isaacs blessing, Of Isaacs blessing Jacob in
stead of Esau.
in blessing Jacob in stead of Esau, and Joshua's Covenant made with the
Gibeonites. There were three who concurred here. First God; secondly, the
persons who craftily concurred here to deceive; and thirdly, the persons who
were deceived. In Isaacs blessing we have to consider; first God, who cannot
deceive, nor be deceived; In blessing of Jacob three persons concurred.
then Rebecca and Jacob, who craftily deceived; and thirdly, Isaac, who was
deceived. Now because it was Gods intention to give the blessing to Jacob,
therefore neither Jacobs craft, nor Isaacs error, could hinder the blessing;
Isaac gives the blessing ignorantly, but because it was according to Gods
intention and revealed will, who was the principal giver of the blessing,
therefore the blessing was effectual. Joshua's Covenant with the Gibeonites.
So in the Covenant with the Gibeonites, the Lord commanded to offer peace to
the seven Nations if they would seek it, now in comes the deceit of the
Gibeonites, and error of Joshua who is deceived, yet because it was Gods
chief intention, that those of the seven Nations who sought peace should be
saved; therefore the oath stood firm, and the error in the person did not
make it void; and the matter may be cleared thus: Simile.
the Lord forbids a brother to eat with a railer, a drunkard, or an
extortioner. 1 Cor. 5.11. but if a drunkard, or a railer, or an ex^ortioner
should come to the Table of the Lord, I am not to refuse to eat at that Table,
although the drunkard be there. The reason is, because this is not my private
Table, but the Lords banquet, and I expect the blessing only from him in it,
and the sins of the drunkard cannot hinder me; but if I should bid such a one
to my house to eat with me, then I should be guilty of their sin. So the
Covenant here is the Lords Covenant, and the deceiver is not able to make it of
no effect. But where the principal intention of the contracter is deceit, and
the person with whom the contract is made is deceived, When the error of the
person makes the contract of no effect.
then the contract is nullified; as if a man should ignorantly buy a free man
for a slave, here the free man should be released, and error personae irritat
contractum.

error personae.

Isaac and Jacob; and the contract betwixt Joshua and the Gibeonites, God had
set down his revealed will, God had revealed his will in the blessing of
Jacob, and the sparing of the Gibeonites.
what he was minded to do in both of these; and therefore neither the error of
Isaac, nor the deceit of Rebecca and Jacob made the blessing of no effect, so
neither in the contract betwixt Joshua and the Gibeonites. But the Lord
forbids fraudulent contracts in his Word, neither is it his intention that
such contracts should be made, therefore they are of no effect.

CHAPTER XX. That a Judge may give out sentence by the information of the false
witnesses, and yet be free.
2 SAMUEL 1.16. And David said unto him, thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
mouth has testified against thee.
IN Judgment the principal part depends upon the witnesses, and if they
testify an untruth, The chief part in judgment depends upon the witnesses.
they make a wrong sentence to proceed out of the mouth of a just Judge: David
here gives out sentence against the Amalekite, it was a just sentence in
respect of the Judge, because he condemned him out of his own mouth, but a
wrong sentence in respect of the Amalekite, because he did not kill Saul, but
bragged only that he had killed him, for the Text says, that Saul killed
himself, 1 Samuel 31.5.

When the Grecians besieged Troy, Simile.
Palamedes was killed there amongst the rest; and when the Greeks had raised
their siege from Troy, and taken Ship to return to Greece; Nauplius the father
of Palamedes (to be revenged upon the Greeks) took a Boat in a dark night,
and went into the Sea, and set up a Beaken upon a rock, which when the Greeks
did see, they took it to be the Harbor, and directed their Course toward it,
and so they run the most of their Ships upon the rocks, and were cast
away. We cannot say here, that the fault was in the Pilots, because the Ships
were cast away; but the fault was in false Nauplius, who held up a wrong light
unto them. So when a good Judge gives out a wrong sentence, the fault is not
in the Judge, but in the false witnesses, who hold up a false light unto him,
and therefore the Judge should labor to punish these false witnesses, and to
restore the party who is wronged to his right; and as Telephus was healed by
the spear that hurt him, so should they study to cure the person whom they
have wounded by their sentence.

A Judge must not proceed without witness.
If a Judge call two or three witnesses, that is the first thing required of him
in trial of the truth, nam testimonio unius non proceditur, and one witness
does not prove. There are three witnesses in heaven to certify us of the
truth, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost. And there are three that bear
witness to us in the earth of the remission of sins, the Spirit, the water,
and blood, 1 Ioh. 5.7.8. So in Iudicatories of the Church three witnesses are
required, 2 Cor. 13.1. This is the third time that I am coming to you, in the
mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. So in the
trial of civil causes, every thing was established by the mouth of two or
three witnesses. Deuteronomy. 21.15.

A Judge is to make choice of faithful witnesses.
Secondly, The Judge must call faithful witnesses; they are called faithful
witnesses when they are reputed so in the common estimation of men; Esaias 8.2.
And I took unto me faithful witnesses, Vriah the Priest and Zechariah the
son of Ierebechiah, Vriah was not a faithful man, yet because he was so
reputed amongst the people; therefore he is called a faithful witness.

They must be eyewitnesses.
Thirdly, He must call witnesses who have both heard and seen, 1 Ioh. 1.1.
That which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, which we have
looked upon etc.

Fourthly, They must be contestes, and their testimonies must be (...),
agreeing in one, Mark. 14.56. Now if the Judge proceed this way, and the
sentence be false, it is not his fault, for by the mouth of two or three
witnesses every word shall be established, that is shall be holden for truth.

When a Judge demands of the witnesses, he asks them not (...), what
murder is. Secondly, he asks not of them, (...), the effects and consequents
of murder which follow it, as the guilt and punishment. Thirdly, (...), he
asks them whether it were casually or maliciously done. And fourthly, (...),
if they saw him kill such a man; this is the special thing that they require,
and if the Judge give out sentence this ways according to things proved, then
the blame lies not upon him if there be a wrong sentence pronounced.

It may be said,

There is a greater uniformity required betwixt the mind and the tongue,
secundum allegata et probata, according to things alleged and proved.

CHAPTER XXI. Of one who killed in sudden passion.
2 SAMUEL 14. And thy hand maid had two sons, and they two strove together in
the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other and
slew him.
THere is a difference betwixt those things which we do in sudden passion,
Difference betwixt things done in passion, and deliberately.
and those things which are done deliberately: those things which children, mad
men, and beasts do, they are not said to be done deliberately, they come not
from the will, which is principium agendi; possunt laedere, sed non injuria
afficere.

Violenti^^. Coactum. Non spontaneum. Voluntarium.
Again, there is a difference betwixt violentum, coactum, non spontaneum, and
voluntarium. Violentum is that, which by outward force a man is constrained to
do, and here the will gives no consent at all: as when they drew the Martyrs
before their Idols, and put incense in their hands. Coactum is that, when there
is some external violence used to enforce and compel a man to do such a
thing, against which he stands out and resists for a time, but yet in the
end he yields for fear: as Origin did to Idolatry. But non spontaneum is
this, when it is partly with the will, and partly against the will; Christ said
unto Peter, Ioh. 21.18. they shall carry thee whither thou would not,
meaning what death he should dye; It was partly with Peter's will, and partly
against his will, that he went to martyrdom. Voluntarium, is that when the
will gives full consent to do a thing.

When a man kills his neighbor in sudden passion he is not violently
drawn to this sin; neither is he compelled to this sin; prima principia
concupiscible et irascibile, sunt interna homini, and cannot be compelled: and
in this sense he who kills in sudden passion, is said to do it willingly;
but if we will respect the will as it is obnubilated with the perturbation of
anger for the time, he did it not willingly, but non sponte. which is a midst
betwixt sponte and invite. Peter said to Christ, Lord I will lay down my life
for thy sake, John 13.3. no doubt he had an intention to dye with him when he
spoke these words; but they shall carry thee whither thou would not, here
he was not willing to dye; so that he was partly willing, and partly not
willing, he was not altogether willing, nor it was not altogether against his
will, but it was partly with his will, and partly against his will.

We do a thing Sponte, we do a thing invite, Sponte. Invite. Non invite.
and we do a thing non invite. We do a thing Sponte, when we are altogether
willing to it; we do a thing invite, when it is partly with our will, and
partly against our will; we do a thing non invite, quando procedit ex
ignorantia comitante, Simile.
as when Mutius Scaevola killed another in stead of Porcenna, and when it was
told him that he had missed the King, and killed another, he was sorry that he
had not killed the King; this action was neither done Sponte, nor invite, but
non invite; but when a man kills in sudden passion, and after that his
passions and perturbations are settled, he is sorry that he has done such a
thing, and is grieved that primus impetus non est in sua potestate, then he
does it invite.

There is a twofold concupiscence, Concupiscentia Antecedent. Consequent.

an antecedent concupiscence, and a consequent concupiscence; the antecedent
concupiscence is that, when the passion preventeth the will, and moves it; but
the consequent concupiscence is that, when the will willingly works, and
stirs up the passion, that it may execute the sin more readily; when
passion preventeth the will, then it extenuateth the sin, but when the will
stirs up the passion, then it augmenteth the sin.

Again, Agere Ex ira. Iratus.

we must make a difference betwixt these two, to do a thing ex ira, and to do
a thing iratus; when a man does a thing ex ira, anger is only the cause of it,
and it repents him of it afterward that he has done it; but when he does a
thing iratus, it does not proceed principally from his anger, but from some
other bad disposition, and hardly such a man repents him of his fact.

Lastly, Eligere. Praeligere.
there is a difference betwixt eligere and praeeligere; eligere is to follow
sense and appetite, but praeeligere is to follow reason: When a man kills in
sudden passion, Anger follows the complexion of the body.
it is electio non praelectio: This sin of anger comes commonly of the
complexion of the body, nam ex iracundis nascuntur irati; the Philosopher
says, a certain man being challenged for beating of his father, gave this
answer; My father beat his father, and pointing to his son with his finger,
he said, this my son will beat me also; these hereditary evils are hardly
cured.

The woman of Tekoah when one of her sons killed the other, she begged of the
King to remember the law of the Lord, that her other son might be saved in
the City of Refuge, which the King granted unto her willingly, 2 Samuel 14.
because he killed him in sudden passion.

CHAPTER XXII. Whether they might take the sons of the Prophets widow for
debt or not?
2 KING. 4. Now cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
Prophets unto Elisha saying, the Creditour is come to take unto him my two
sons to be bondmen.
IT is a pitiful thing to add grief to those who are in grief already; this
widow she was in grief already, and those who would take her sons from her,
add new grief unto her. The Lord says, Make not sad the heart of the widow.
Iere. 22.3. Elias 1 King. 17.20. said unto the Lord, O Lord my God, thou have
brought evil upon this widow with whom I sojourne, by slaying her son: As if
he should say, is it not enough O Lord, that thou have taken away her husband,
but thou will take away her son also? The Lord could not do wrong to this
widow by taking away both her son and her husband; but they who came to take
this poor widows children, did great wrong to her, in adding new grief to
her.

The widow in the Hebrew is called [Almonah] muta ab [Alam] silere, (...) Vidua
ab (...) Silere. (...) Vacua.
because she has no body to speak for her; and she is called [Rikam] empty.
Ruth 1.21. because she wants a husband to defend her; a widow who lives in
pleasure, she is dead while she is living, 1 Timothy 5.6. but a widow that is a
widow indeed and desolate, trusts in God, and she is civilly dead when she
wants the means to help her.

The Lord forbids in his Law to take to pledge the upper or the nether
Millstone, which are the means to maintain the man's life, Deuteronomy. 24.6. The
widows two sons were (as it were) the nether and the upper Millstone to gain
her living. Secondly, the Lord forbids to take to pledge the cloths in which
the poor man lies in the night, for he says, when he cries unto me I will
hear, for I am gracious, Exodus 22.27. And when those two sons of the widow
were taken from her, did not the Lord hear her, a poor woman, a poor widow,
the widow of one that feared the Lord, the widow of a Prophet? Yes verily, he
heard her and that quickly; And, he that says, Touch not mine anointed, and
do my Prophets no harm, Psalm. 105.15. so he says, touch not the Prophets
widow, nor her sonn^s, and do them no harm. Thirdly, the Lord commanded them
when they went to seek the pledge, that they should not go in into the house
to fetch it, but they should stand abroad, and the man should bring it out
himself, Deuteronomy. 24.10. But they who violently took away the woman's sons
observed not this, but did as the wicked servant in the Gospel, who took his
fellow servants by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owe, Mat. 22.28.



Esaias answers, Chap. 58.6. Is not this the Fast that I required, to undo the
heavy burden, and to let the oppressed go free? This debt was a heavy burden
upon the poor woman's shoulders, and therefore they ought to have remitted it.
(...) Pignus. Funis.

Job. 22.6. Thou have taken a pledge from thy brother: Hhobhel, signifies both
pignus and funis a pledge, and a cord, because it binds as strongly as cords
do; and the Greeks call it (...), Quasi obligatio, suppositum, and obnoxios
sibi subijcere, with this cord they would have bound the poor widow.

Job when he describes the oppressor, Chap. 24.3. he says, he takes away the
widows Ox for a pledge; he takes the Ox, the beast that is so needful for
her, therefore he that took an Ox was bound to restore five Oxen for him,
Exodus 22.1. Again, to take the widows only Ox, we see how Nathan
exaggerateth the rich man's fault, for taking the poor man's only sheep, 2 Samuel
12. And if it be oppression, and a crying sin to take the poor widows Ox,
what a sin was it to take her sons, who should have relieved her in her
necessity? Ezekiel. 18.16. it is a note of the child of God, that he withheld
not the pledge from the poor. In the Original it is [Hhabhol lo hhabhal]
Pignorando non pignoravit, (...) Pignorando non Piguoravit.
the repetition of the same word signifies to take away the pledge, and to
keep it.

The widow of Tekoah, when one of her sons had killed the other, and the
revenger of the blood came to kill, she desired that her other son which was
alive, might be saved, because he was her unica pruna, her only sparkle that
was left alive, 2 Samuel 14. Wherefore to take this widows two sons from her,
was to put out her light.

The conclusion of this is. father to the fatherles, and a Judge of the
widows, Psalm. 68.6. therefore men should beware to wrong or harm them: God
will defend their cause, he relieveth the fatherless and the widow, Psalm.
146.9. And he that is their Redeemer is strong.

CHAPTER XXIII. Whether a man may sell his son for debt, or not?
MAT. 20 25. But for as much as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be
sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
THere are three sorts of commanding in the family; the first is Herilis
potestas; the second is Maritalis potestas; and the third is Patria potestas;
these three sorts of power differ.

Herilis potestas, is like the government Monarchical, which has more
absolute commandment to dispose of things, so had the Master, Mat. 20.25. over
his servants, when he commanded the man, his wife and children to be sold.

The second sort of commanding in the family, is the authority which the man
has over his wife, and this is like the Aristocraticall power, for the man in
his necessity, may not sell his wife to set himself at liberty, Et uxor non
est in bonis, she is not a part of his goods.

The third sort of commanding in the house, is Patria potestas; and here the
father has a greater authority over the children, for they are a special
part of their fathers possession, Deuteronomy. 32.6. Ipse est pater tuus qui possedit
te? Is not he thy father that has bought thee? The Lord permitted a man to
sell his children under the Law, Exodus 21.7. If a man sell his daughter to be a
hand-maide. So Ezra 2.5. the Jews being in debt sold their children.

Jacob when he made his latter will, Genesis 42.22. he says, I gave to thee one
part above thy brethren, which I conquered with my bow and with my sword. Jacob
himself never purchased Sichem, but his sons purchased it when they killed
the Sichemites. Why does he say then; which I have purchased with my Bow? The
reason of this was, because Jacob was Lord over his children, and over all that
they conquered.

A father has such authority over his son, that he might sell him until he
was sui juris, that is, until he was one and twenty years old. First, he
might sell him before he was seven year old; then he might have sold him the
second time, until he was fourteen year old, if his debt had not been
paid: and thirdly, he might have sold him until he was twenty one. So he
might sell his daughter. Exodus 21.7. It is not understood here, that he might
sell his daughter when she was ready to be married, Allusion.
but simply, he might sell her at any time. And the Lord alludeth to this
form, Esaias 50.1. Which of my Creditours is it, to whom I have sold you? The
father might sell himself, therefore he might sell his son, because his
son is but a part of himself.

But there are sundry things which cannot be sold Quia nullam admittunt
aestimationem, as blood, chastity,

This was not properly a sale, Non est conditio absoluta, sed quasi sub pacto,
D. ll. 2. Cap. de Patribus qui filios distraxerunt.
tenetur enim emptor filium restituere, si justum pretium offeratur illi; That
is, this condition in selling of his son was not absolute, but the contract
was so made, that the buyer was bound to restore his son back again to him,
if he had offered him a sufficient price.

In the natural body, the hand or any other member will cast up it self to
save a stroke from the head; so should the natural son do to relieve his
father. Ruben offered himself in stead of Benjamin, to be a bond-servant, Genesis
44.33. Now if Ruben offered this for his youngest brother, much more should the
son offer to become a bond-servant for his old father.

The conclusion of this is, the children ought not to lay up for the Parents,
but the Parents for the children, 2 Cor. 12.17. yet to supply their fathers
necessity, they should be content to quite their liberty, and all that they
have for their fathers liberty.

CHAPTER XXIIII. Of their diverse sorts of Rulers and Commanders.
EXODUS 18.25. And Moses choose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads
over the people, Rulers over thousands, etc.
(...) virga. (...) Tribus.
THe people of the Jews were divided into twelve Tribes, those Tribes were
called Shibhte, because they had a rod carried before them.

Before the renting of the ten Tribes from Judah they were called Israelites;
but after the rent of the ten Tribes, the two Tribes and the half were
called Judah, and the ten Tribes were usually called Israel; and sometimes
Joseph, and Izreel, and sometimes Jacob. And in the Captivity they are called
Jews, as Ester 2.5. Mordecai of Benjamin is called a Jew, so Ester 3. Haman
sought to destroy all the Jews: and they are all called Israel in the
Captivity, and thou shall bear the iniquity of Israel and Judah, (...) cum
demonstrative.
Ezekiel. 4. And once halevj, Mal. 2.8. cum [he] demonstrativo, to signify that
levi is not put here for a proper name.

Those who ruled the twelve Tribes were diverse, Joshua 23.2. Joshua called for
all Israel, for their Elders, for their heads, for their Judges and for their
officers.

(...) Seniores.
For the Elders, these are called Zekenim, and the Seventie translate them
(...), id est, majores; Zekenim is sometimes taken for the great Synedrion, and
sometimes for the Kings Council, 2 King. 1.10. And Iehu sent unto Samaria to
the Rulers of Izreel, here the word Elders is taken for the Kings Council, and
not for the Synedrion, for it sat in Jerusalem: and sometimes in the lesser
Cities Zekenim are called Senatores.

Secondly; He called for [roshim] their heads, which the Seventie translate
(...), Principes; (...) Capita, Priupes.
This word [rosh] is taken sometimes for the Captains of the Armies, 1 Samuel
11.11. And Saul divided his Army into three heads, that is three Companies.
Judge. 11.7. eris nobis [lerosh] in caput, the Seventie translate it (...). So
[rosh] is taken for the heads of the families, and they are called [roshe
abhoth] here; Joshua sent for the Captains of the Army.

Thirdly; He sent for [Shophetim] the Judges, (...) vel (...) Iudices.
that is the Rulers of the Cities, and these also were called [Omanim] 2 King.
10.1.

These who ruled the people, (...).
were either the heads of the Tribes, and they were called share hashebhatim,
or (...): these conveined the Tribes, and were Captains in their wars, for
the Tribes had their own proper wars, sometimes one against another; so the
Danites made war against them of Lachis, and they of Ephraim against Iepthe,
Judge. 12.

Or else they were Commanders in some part of the Tribe, for the Tribes were
divided into families, and these who were chief in the family were called
[Share mishpahhim] or Patriarchae, capita familiarum, (...) Capita Familiarum.
the Patriarchs or heads of the families.

These families again were divided into thousands; Example. In Judah there were
five great families, or [alphe] thousands, and they had five Commanders who
were called (...), Numb. 1.16. these were the heads of thousands in Israel. And
Micha alludeth to this chap. 5.2. Bethleem Ephrata although thou be little
amongst the thousands of Judah. Secondly, some were Commanders over hundreds,
and they were called (...). Thirdly, they were Commanders over fifties, Esaias
3.3. And lastly, Rulers over ten. This division was instituted by Moses by the
Council of Iethro, and approved by Iehosaphat, 2 Chronicles. 19. These Commanders
over thousands, hundreds, and fifties were [bagnale ribhoth] Lords to take away
strife from the people, (...)
like our Justices of peace; and they differed from the ordinary Judges called
Shophetim. (...)


Lastly, They had their [shoterim] which word is diversely translated by the
Seventie: (...)
first they translate it (...), because by force they compelled men to
obedience, loro et baculo cogebant: and sometimes they translate them (...),
because they carried a rod: and sometimes (...), Pro. 6 6. Go to the Pismire,
who has not [Shoter] over seer or ruler. So Exodus 5.15. they translate
Shoterim (...), as ye would say, institutores vel doctores, because they
taught the people obedience to the Magistrates: and Act. 13.35. (...); Syrus
habet, caput vrbis. Iunius translates it moderatores, and Aquila translateth it
(...), facinorum Vindices. Lastly, they translate shoterim, (...),
under-rowers; for as in a Gallie there are commanders, rowers, and
under-rowers; so in this well constituted Commonwealth of the Jews, there
were supreme Commanders, Commanders in the middle degree, and Commanders in
the inferior degree.

CHAPTER XXV. Of their civil counting of their times, and first of their Hour.
Of their times.
THe Greeks derive the hour from (...), terminare, because it measured the
times of the year; or from (...) custodire, because they fained that the
hours kept Apolloes gates; but it seems rather to be derived from the
Hebrew word [Or] lux, and hence the Egyptians call the Sun (...) Apollo.

The Greeks at the first had no other division of the year but into four
seasons, which they called quatuor horae anni: and the Latins called them
quatuor tempestates anni. The like division they made of the day, and they
said, solis occasus suprema tempestas esto.

Afterward they divided these tempestates into so many hours in the day, those
hours were either called horae minores, and they were measured by the Zodiac,
and planetarie or unequal hours, because of the obliquitie of the Zodiac;
or else they were called horae equinoctiales equal hours, because of the
straightness of the Equinoctial.

The Jews at first learned the division of the day into whole hours from the
Romans, for before this the hours were either halfe-houres, or (...)
occasional hours, as to dine and to suppe; So the hours of dinner and supper
were described of old by drawing of water, as Rebecca came out to draw water,
Genesis 24.11. Septuaginta dixerunt (...). Dinner and Supper described by drawing
of water.
This was the evening time when women came out to draw water. So they noted the
dinner time by drawing of water, Ioh. 5.31. when the woman of Samaria came out
to draw water, then the Disciples brought meat to Christ and desired him to
eat; This was dinner time.

Of the hours upon Ahaz Dial.
THe hours set upon Ahaz Dial were unequal, or planetarie hours, because
this dial was made upon a polar ground.

Five sorts of Dials.
There are five grounds upon which a dial must be made; First upon the
elevation of the Equinoctial, whose hours are always equal. Secondly
vertical, and it shows only from six to six equinoctially. Thirdly
meridionall, which shows the hours from the rising of the Sun (...) the
midday, upon the East side, and from the mid-d^^ till the Sun set upon the
West side. Fourthly horizo^^all, which has no shadow under the Equinoctial,
or near the Equinoctial. And the last is the polar dial, which follows the
Zodiac, and the hours are contracted upon the South side of the Equinoctial
in the Winter, and enlarged upon the North side in the Summer.

Upon what ground Ahaz Dial was made.
This Dial of Ahaz could not be made upon an equinoctial ground, because the
hours of the Equinoctial dial are equal. Secondly, it could not be made
vertical, because the vertical shows only from six to six, and not the
rising and setting of the Sun. Thirdly, it could not be made meridionall,
because the East side and the West side are divided by the meridionall, and it
wants the twelfth hour. Fourthly, it could not be made horizontall, because
they lay so near the Equinoctial that the style could cast no shadow.
Therefore it behoved to be polar, and the hours behoved to be unequally
divided for Summer and Winter, or else they behoved to have two Dialls, one for
Summer, and another for Winter.

The form of this Dial was Hemispheriall, or an half Circle.

What things are to be considered in this dial.
In this Dial we have to consider these points; First, that the lines were but
half hours upon the dial, and not full hours. Secondly, that this miracle
has been wrought when the Sun was in the height, for if it had been in the
declination, or in the afternoon, then it could not have gone forward ten
degrees; or if it had been soon in the morning, it could not have gone back
ten degrees. Thirdly, this miracle was wrought in the Summer time, the day
being at the longest; it could not be brought back ten degrees in the winter
day, for when the day is shortest, the Sun arises to them at seven of the
clock: neither could this miracle be wrought at the Equinoctial, for then
they could not have discerned the Sun to cast a shadow upon the dial,
because then the shadow is so long; but the Text says, that the Sun went
back so many degrees upon Ahaz dial, 2 King. 20. Therefore it seems to have
been wrought in the Summer time, at the longest day, when it was drawn back
from the eleventh hour to the sixth, which is one hour after the Sun rising;
for in the longest day it arises to them at five of the clock in the morning.

Whether went the Sun back ten degrees, Abulensis upon 2 King. 20. holds,
the shadow went back ten degrees;] or did the Sun go back and the shadow
also?

If the shadow had gone back, and not the Sun, quoad modum, Three sorts of
miracles.
sed non quoad substantiam, and it had been but a miracle in the third degree;
A miracle in the highest degree is, when nature had never a hand in a thing, as
to make the Sun go back so many degrees, or to stand still. A miracle in
the second degree is this, when nature had once a hand in producing of a thing,
but when nature fails once, it cannot restore it to the former case again.
Example. Nature brings forth a man seeing, now when he becomes blind,
nature cannot restore him to his sight, and when he is restored to his sight
again, it is a miracle in the second degree. A miracle in the third degree is
this, when nature in time could do such a thing, but cannot do it upon a
sudden. Example. Peter's Mother in law was sick of a Fever; Nature in time
could cure one of a Fever, but Christ curing her upon a sudden, this is a
miracle in the third degree. Example 2. When a lump of figs was laid to
Hezekias boil, the figs in time would have matured this boil, and broken
it, but when the Lord does it upon a sudden, this is a miracle in the third
degree. So for the shadow to go back when the Sun goes forward, this is
natural to it, but for the shadow to go back upon a sudden, this was a
miracle in the third degree, but when the Sun and the shadow both went back,
this was a miracle in the first degree, and quoad modum and quoad substantiam.





Dionysius Areopagita makes mention of the Eclipse of the Sun in Christ's
Passion.

Jason there is mention made of the standing of the Sun and Moon in Joshua's
days, and that Book is perished now; shall we say then, that nothing is
written in this Book, because this Book is not extant?

Whether was this a greater miracle when the Sun went back in Hezekias
days, Joshua's days?

If ye will respect them to whom this miracle was wrought in Joshua's days, it
was a greater miracle; Whether this miracle or that in Joshua's days was
greatest?
it was wrought for the confirmation of all Israel, and this was wrought but
for the confirmation of Hezekias; Secondly, Joshua's day was longer than
Hezekias day; Hezekias day was but twenty two hours, and Joshua's day was
twenty and four: Ecclus 46.4. Stetit Sol and una dies facta est in duas, Did
not the Sun go back by his means? And was not one day as long as two.

This miracle was wrought at three of the clock in the afternoon, for the
Moon was a quadrant of the Heaven distant from the Sun, and quarter Moon;
for Gibea was Southwest from Megiddo where they did fight, and there the Sun
stood, and Ajalon where the Moon stood was Southeast.



medium aequidistantiae, and the second is interpositionis; Medium
aequidistantia. interpositionis.

the Sun is in medio aequidistantiae, when it is in the middle point, betwixt
the Sunne-rising and the Sunne-setting, this is in the midst of the day; but it
is in medio interpositionis, when it is in any part of the Heaven betwixt the
two extremes, it was now but in medio interpositionis.

Again, This miracle was wrought twenty days after the Equinoxe.
this miracle was wrought twenty days after the Equinoxe; for Joshua
instituted the Passover Cap. 5. the fourteenth day of Nisan, which was at the
Equinoxe, and that Moon had but fourteen days to run to the change, and
now the Moon was before the Sun; but when the miracle fell out, the Moon
was behind the Sun, and it was quarter-Moone; so that the fourteen days of
the old Moon, and the eight days of the other Moon, made up twenty days
after the Equinoxe.

Joshua's day was 24. hours.
Thirdly, Joshua's day was twenty-foure hours, nine hours already past, and
three hours to the Sunne-setting; then the Sun stood a whole Equinoctial
day, which all being joined together, makes twenty-foure hours, then it is
said Josh. 10.14. That there was no day like to it before or after, which must
be understood, that there was no day before or after like unto it for length.

Hezekias day was 22. hours.
Hezekias day was but twenty-two hours in length, which is proved thus; the
Sun had run twelve degrees already forward upon Ahaz Dial, which makes
six planetary hours; then it goes back again ten degrees, which makes
five planetary hours, and this made eleven hours.



Ahaz an hour after it rises, and an hour before it set; neither upon any
other Dial, for then the shadows are so long, that they show not the hour,
it went back then but to the hour after that it arose, which was the second
planetary hour, then it had five planetary hours to the midst of the day,
which made up sixteen hours; and six hours to the Sunne-setting, which
makes in all twenty-two hours.

Now to make some application and spiritual use of these Dials.

The spiritual use of these Dials.
Christ before his Incarnation was like to the Sun shining upon the
Equinoctial Dial, where the shadow is very low; secondly, before Christ came
in the flesh, there were many Ceremonies, and a long shadow, but since Christ
came in the flesh, this is like the Sun shining upon the Polar Dial, the
shadow is short and the Sun is nearer.

Thirdly, our estate in this life compared with the life to come, is like to
the meridionall Dial; for the meridionall Dial shows not the twelfth hour;
so in this life, we see not the son of righteousness in his brightness.

Fourthly, our estate in this life, is like the vertical Dial, which shows
neither the rising nor setting of the Sun; so in this life we know neither
our coming into the world, nor the time when we are to go out of it.

Fifthly, our estate in the life to come is like the Horizontall Dial, for as
the Sun shines always upon the Horizontall Dial; so shall the Sun of
righteousness shine always upon us in the life to come.

CHAPTER XXVI. Of their Day.
GENESIS 1.3. And the Evening and the Morning were the first day.
A Day in the Scripture, is either a natural, Dies Naturalis. Artificialis.
Propheticu^.

artificial, or a prophetical day.

The natural day consists of four and twenty hours, comprehending day and
night, Number. 8.17. In that day that I smote every first borne in the land of
Egypt. But Exodus 12.29. it is said, that at midnight the Lord smote the first
borne of Egypt; so that by day here is meant the whole twenty four hours.

The artificial day began at the Sunne-rising, and ended at the Sunne-setting,
Exodus 16.14. Why sit ye all the day from morning till night? And it had three
Periods in it, morning, midday, and evening; and the midday is called
Zeharaijm, (...) Meridies.
and it is put in the duall number, because it contains a part of the
forenoone, and a part of the afternoon.

Psalm. 65.8. Thou make the outgoings of the morning, and the evening to
rejoice; the outgoings of the morn, is the rising of the stars before the
Sun rise, as (...), and the outgoings of the evening, that is, when the Moon
rises, and the stars with her, as Hesperus; the Sun is said to go out as
it were out of his chamber, when he arises out of the Sea, or the earth, Psalm.
19. And he is said to go in and to dip in the Sea, Mark. 4. when he sets.

Ortus Heliacus. Chronicus. Cosmicus.

Ortus Heliacus, is when the stars arise with the Sun; Ortus Chronicus, is
the rising of the stars with the Moon; Ortus Cosmicus, is when the stars
rise at certain seasons in the year, as Orion, Plejades, etc.

A Prophetical day is taken for a year in the Scriptures; as they had a
prophetical day, so they had prophetical weeks, prophetical months, and
prophetical years.

Prophetical days, weeks, and years.
A week signifies a week of years, as Daniels seventie weeks, Dan. 9.25. So
the month signifies a month of years, according to the Greek computation,
counting thirty days to a month; so the year signifies a year of years,
Iere. 28.3. Adhuc duo anni annoru^; So these places in the Revelation, Forty
two months an hundredth and sixty days three years and an half, so time,
times, and half a time, are prophetically to be understood; A prophetical
day, is a year; the week seven years, the month thirty years, and the
prophetical year three hundredth and sixty years, and this way they counted,
to signify the shortness of the time.

A day is applied in the Scripture first to our estate in grace, Heb. 4. To day
if ye will hear his voice, A day applied to the estate of grace.
harden not your hearts; and all the Comparisons in the Scriptures are taken
from the forenoone, to show the growth of grace; First, (...), or the morning
Star, and the dawning of the day, and the day star arise in your hearts, 2
Pet. 1.19. Secondly, to the Sunne-rising, Esaias 8.10. It is because there is no
morning in them; and thirdly, to the Sun in the strength of the day, Judge.
5.3.

Then the declination of grace is compared to the Sun in the afternoon,
Iere. 6.4. Arise, Declination of grace compared to the declining of the Sun.
let us go up at noone; woe unto us for the day goes away, for the shadows
of the evening are stretched out, Micah 3. And the Sun set upon the Prophets.

The forenoone is compared to the time of grace before it come to the
declining, therefore let us make great reckoning of this time to redeem it,
Psalm. 108.2. I my self will awake early: but in the Original it is more
emphaticall, [Hagnira shahher] Expergefaciam auroram. (...) Expergefaciam
Auroram.
As if David should say, the morning never took me napping, but I wakened it
still.

Secondly, The day represents the shortness of our life.
the day represents the shortness of our life to us, and it is compared to
an artificial day, Psalm. 90.5. In the morning it flourishes, and grows up,
but in the evening it is cut down and withers: it is like Jonas Gourd, which
grows up in one artificial day, and decays again; and the hours of the
day whereunto our life is compared, are like planetary hours, long in the
Summer, and short in the Winter: Compare our days with the days of our
fathers, they are but few and evil, in respect of their days, therefore our
days are called dies palmares.

The Lord made the day for man to travail, The day was made for man to
travail in it.
and the night for him to rest in, therefore they are monsters in nature, that
invert this order, who sleep in the day and wake in the night, Psalm. 104.23.
Man goes forth unto his work, and to his labor, until the evening. And
Verse. 20. Thou make darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the
Forest do creep forth: Those who turn day into night, follow the beasts,
and not man; such a monster was Heliogabalus, who would rise at night, and then
cause morning salutations to be given unto him: the History says, that the
world seemed to go backward in this monsters days: this sort of people Seneca
calls them our Antipodes, for when we rise they go to bed and contra.

How they reckoned the days of the Week.
THe Jews reckoned their days thus; Prima Sabbath, secunda sabbath, the first
day of the week, the second day of the week, etc. Secondly, the Latin Church
reckoned from the Passover, Prima feria, secunda feria, etc. Thirdly, they
borrowed afterward another sort of reckoning from the Heathen, who reckoned
their days by the Planets, the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Mars, etc.

Saturn stands in the highest place, then Jupiter, next Mars, and so in order
Sol, Mercury, Venus, and then Luna. Jupiter follows not Saturn in the days
of the week, but Sol; so Mercury follows not Sol but Luna.

bases to the Hemisphere, whose bases arise from the several corners drawn in
the circle, in whose circumference, the seven Planets are set down according
to their own order, making up one equal triangle in every one of their two
sides, as, Sol, Luna, Mars; Sol is in the right side of the triangle, Luna in
the top, and Mars in the left side of the triangle; and so from Mars to Jupiter
by Mercury; and from Jupiter to Saturn by Venus; and from Saturn to Luna by
Sol, and from the Moon to Mercury by Mars; and from Mercury to Venus by
Jupiter, as ye may see in the figure following.

A Demonstration to show how the days are reckoned according to the seven
Planets.




Areopagus, Mars street, Act. 17. So, we sailed in a Ship whose Badge was
Castor and Pollux. Act. 28. and such like.

CHAPTER XXVII. Of their month.
EXODUS 12.2. This shall be the beginning of months to you.
BEfore the people of God came out of Egypt, the months were reckoned
according to the course of the Sun, Reasons proving how many days every
month had.
following the custom of the Egyptians and Chaldeans, and their months were
full thirty days, as may be gathered out of the eight of Genesis, the flood
began to wax the seventh day of the second month Iair, answering to our May;
and it began to decrease in the seventh day of the seventh month Tishri: from
the seventh day of the second month, to the seventh day of the seventh, are
one hundred and fifty days, which being divided by thirty, gives to every
month thirty days. After they came out of Egypt their months were full
thirty days, Numb. 11.19. Ye shall not eat one day, neither five days,
neither ten days but even a whole month. Hence we may gather that their
month was full thirty days; Reasons proving how many months are in the
year.
because they reckoned by five, ten, twenty, thirty. So there were twelve
months in the year, every month consisting of thirty days: 1 King. 4.7.
And Solomon had twelve Officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for
the King and his household. Each man in his month through the year made
provision: now if there had been more then twelve months in the year, (as
afterward the Jews made their intercalar year Veadar) then one should have
had two months. So 1 Chronicles. 27.1. and 12.15. The chief Officers served the
King by courses, which came in and out month by month throughout all the
months in the year: here we may see that there were twelve months in the
year, and every month had thirty days, which made up in the year three
hundred and sixty days.

But because there were five full days lacking in the months to fill up the
course of the Sun, The twelve months come short of the course of the Sun
five days.
which is three hundred sixty and five days, the Egyptians put to the five
days called (...) to the last month Tishri: and they illustrate the matter by
this apologue, The five odd days illustrated by an apologue of Mercury and
the Moon.
they say, that Mercury and the Moon at a time did play at the dice for the
five odd days, and that Mercury did win them from the Moon, and Mercury
followed the course of the Sun. And in respect the Sun every year runs
three hundred sixty five days and six odd hours, How the leap year or
bissextile is made up.
which six odd hours every fourth year makes a day, they added this day to
the fourth year, which year by the Egyptians was called (...), as ye would
say the dog turning about to himself, as when he biteth his own tail: and
the Latins called it annus from annulus, because it turned about to the same
point again. So Ioh. 18.13. (...) is a year, so Luke 3.2. This odd day which
was added every fourth year was called dies desultorius, This desultorie or
bissextile day at the first did run through the twelve Months.
because it wandered to and fro through the whole year, for the space of one
hundred and twenty years. This is called saeculum, Genesis 26. and therefore
they inter-laced a whole month for this desultorius dies, What makes an
embolimie year.
which in the space of one hundred and twenty years makes up a month of
thirty days: and because that day which afterward was inter-called in the
fourth year lacked some scruples of a whole day, The Suns course comes
always back in the months.
therefore in the space of one hundred thirty and six years the Sun turned
back a day in every month, when it comes to the Equinoxe or Solstice. The
Sun was in the Equinoxe at Christ's death, in the twenty fifth of March, now
it is come to the tenth of March, and if the world should continue long, it
should come to the tenth of January and so backward. The Sun follows the
first mover.
This shows that the Sun keeps the revolution of the first mover, who
comes always nearer to the North Pole, as the Astronomers have observed.

These five (...) dies, the last of them Nehemias calls Nephthar, (...) a
(...) Purificare.
from the word patar, purificare, for writing to the Jews which were in Egypt,
2 Macc. 1.36. he says, that the Temple was purified upon the last of these
(...) dies, called naphthar: for the Egyptian months had always thirty
days, These five intercalar days had diverse names among the Egyptians.
which make up in the year three hundred and sixty days, and five odd days
which added to the end of the year were called (...), and by Egyptians and
Arabians, Nasi, the first of them was called Osiris, and the fifth naphthar.

The month of the Moon has twenty nine days and twelve hours, therefore
amongst the Jews the months were either twenty nine, or full thirty.

A threefold computation of the months of the Moon.
The months of the Moon are considered three manner of ways. First, as the
Moon goes from one point of the Zodiac and returns back to the same
again: and this is called periodus, vel cursus lunaris, which space of time is
more then twenty seven days, and less then twenty eight. The second is the
returning of the Moon to the same place where she went back last from the
Sun, and this is called (...): this consists of twenty nine days and
twelve whole hours. The third is the second day from the conjunction, and it
is called (...) or (...), the apparition of the new Moon; this is in the
second day after the conjunction.

All the time before the captivity the months had no proper names, Ezekiel. 1.1.
No proper names of the months before the Captivity.
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth, that is, in the
fourth month. So the Romans gave the names to the months from their number,
as September, October, etc. Therefore these three names spoken of, 1 King.
6.37.38. Ziph for the second month, and Bull for the eight, and so ethanim;
These first names Ziph and Bull, The names of the months before the captivity
were appellatiue.
Scaliger holds them to be Sydonian names, or Tyrian: but we may say rather
that they were appellatiue names all this time; Ziph, significat amaenitatem,
Dan. 2.31. so the month ethanim, mensis antiquorum, a Chaldie word, because
they reckoned the creation of the world from that month.

Alexander the great changed these Chaldie names which they had learned in the
Captivity, into Macedonian names, as Adar he called it Xanthius, and tishri he
called it (...), as ye would say Jupiters boy, 1 Macch. 9.50.

It was after the captivity before they learned to inter-call their month,
The reason of the months intercalation after the captivity.
and then they began to inter-call them, that they might make both the Sun
and the Moon come both to one period every second or third year. And that
they might know the time of the change of the Moon, for the keeping of their
feasts the better: and for every second or third year they doubled the month
adar, and called it veadar, and this year was called the embolimie year. And
because the Sun and the Moon met not in one period the second or third
year, therefore they made up the golden number consisting of nineteen years,
The course of the Sun and Moon agree after nineteen years are complete, and
called the golden number.
wherein the Sun and the Moon met both in one period together. The rule for
this embolimie amongst the Hebrews was this; ter ter bis bis ter ter ter, id
est, mensis intercalandus est, anno tertio, sexto, octavo, undecimo, decimo
quarto, decimo septimo, decimo nono; et annus decimus nonus erat intercalandus,
consisting of seven months.

Before the captivity they had no other inter-calling or reducing the Moon to
the Sun, but only dies (...) Egyptiorum: and the Turks at this day
observing only the lunarie year, and never reducing the Moon to the Sun,
therefore the month Rammadon falls sometimes in Summer, and sometimes in
winter.

When they inter-called their months, they called the month which they
inter-called, Veadar; and this Veader was their twelfth month, and Adar was
their thirteenth month; this Veadar was but esteemed as momentum temporis
among the Jews, and in their civil computations it had no use, neither judged
they any cause in this month, and the Jews set down this case.

Ruben and Simeon were two twins; Ruben the eldest was borne in the last day of
the intercalar month Veadar, and Simeon his brother was borne in the first day
of the ordinary month adar, so that Simeon was but a day younger then Ruben.
And the case was handled amongst the Judges which of them should enter into the
inheritance first, and they ordained that Simeon should enter a month before
his brother Ruben, because Ruben was borne in that month which was not
reckoned amongst the months, and therefore they counted him a month younger
then his brother Simeon.

The Sun exceeds the Moons course eleven days.
This reckoning they kept, that they might reduce the course of the Moon to the
Sun, for the Sun exceeds the Moon eleven days; The Sun exceeds the
Moons course eleven days. The month exceeds the Moons course six days.
The Sun exceeds the twelve months five days and six hours. What makes
up the leap year.
and also the month exceeds the Moon in the whole year six days, (when
the months are full thirty days.) And thirdly the Sun exceeds the twelve
months, five days and six hours, which six hours every fourth year
makes up a day, and this year we call leap year: these eleven odd days
are not cast away, they are insititij dies, or ingrafted days, as a graft is
grafted in a tree, and they are called the Epact, because they are cast to, to
the end of the year, for to reduce the Moons course to the course of the
Sun; neither are they left as dies desultorij, to run at random through
all the months of the year.

This time of the Epact with them is counted as no time, and they illustrate
the matter thus. The embolimie epact counted as no time.
A man had thirty sons and thirty daughters, and three which were neither his
sons nor his daughters, but abortives, borne out of time; these thirty sons
and thirty daughters were the days and the nights of the months, and the
three odd days after the third embolimie were reserved as insititij dies,
until the next embolimie, and were no part of the months of the year, until
the seventh embolimie.

The spiritual use which the Scripture makes of the Moon is, first to show
us the instabilitie of the world, therefore Revel. 12.1. the Church is the
woman clothed with the Sun, having the moon under her feet: to signify
that the Church shall tread under foot the changeable world.

Secondly, as the Moon changes, so does the life of man, Job 14. while my
change come: so Prove. 31.8. (...) Filii mutationis.
aperi ostuum in causa filiorum mutationis, that is, for him that is going to
be put to death; and as we pray when the Moon changes, Lord send us a good
change, so should we pray especially when we are ready to die, that the Lord
would give us a happy change.

CHAPTER XXVIII. Of their Year.
2 CHRO. 24.23. And it came to pass at the end of the year, (or in the
revolution of the year) that the Host of Assyria came up.
THe Jews had a twofold beginning of the reckoning of their year; the first
was from Tishri, the second was from Nisan.

They began their first reckoning from Tishri, in the month Elul their year
ended, and in this month their new year began; (...) Revolutio.
this was called [Tekuphah] revolutio anni. 1 King. 20.26. it was in this
month that the Kings went forth to battle, 2 Samuel 11.1. And it came to pass
when the year was expired at the time when Kings went out to battle. They
went out to battle at this time of the year, because then the heat of the
year was declining; (...) Mensis Antiquorum.
and the Chaldees called this month, Mensis Ethanim, id est, veterum, 1 King.
8.2. In this month they began to reckon before they came out of Egypt, because
the Jews held that the world was created in this month; (...) chaldaice
Pueritia et Hyems.
this month is called [Hhoreph] pueritia, for as Tishri is the beginning of
the year, Genesis 8.22. so the beginning of our age is our childhood, Job 29.4.

Their Ecclesiastical reckoning began in Nisan.
Their Ecclesiastical reckoning began in Nisan, Exodus 12.1 Chron. 12.15. These
are they who went over Jordan in the first month, when Jordan had overstowed
all the banks: this was in the month Nisan, for then the snow melts upon
the mountains of Libanus, and the waters overflow the banks of Jordan. Ioh.
4.35. Say ye not there are yet four months and then comes the harvest? that
is, the Pascha and the Pentecost; the first was the beginning of the harvest,
and the last was the end of the harvest; the beginning of the harvest fell in
the first month of the year in Nisan; for on the fourteenth day was the
Pascha, and on the fifteenth day they brought in handfuls of new Corn; and
Zach. 7.1. The word of the Lord came unto Zachariah in the fourth day of the
ninth month, even in Chisleu, that is, in the ninth from Nisan. So the feast
of the Tabernacles was kept in the seventh month Tishri, which is the seventh
from Nisan.

From Nisan they reckoned their feasts, What they reckoned from every month.
the reign of their Kings, their contracts, bonds, and Obligations.

From Elul answering to our August; they reckoned the age of their young beasts
which they were to offer to the Lord, none of their beasts were offered before
Elul.

Thirdly, from Tishri answering to our September, they reckoned the seventh
year of the resting of their land, and their Jubilees; Vide Buxtor. Synag.
and from this time they reckoned how long their trees were circumcised or
uncircumcised.

Fourthly, from Shebat answering to our January, they reckoned all their trees
which paid fruit, they paid tithe only of these trees which began to
flourish at that time.

The conclusion of this is; Jews from Tishri to Nisan, because the Jews then
were delivered out of Egypt; so the Lord has changed our reckoning now from
the old Sabbath of the Jews, to the new reckoning of our Sabbath, because this
day our delivery and redemption was finished; 2 Cor. 5.17. Old things are
passed away, behold all things are become new.

CHAPTER XXIX. Of their numbering, and manner of counting.
PRO. 3.6. Wisdom comes with length of days in her right hand.
THey numbered of old three manner of ways; first, by their fingers; secondly,
by letters; and thirdly, by Ciphers.

First, by their fingers, for as their first measure was their hand. Esaias
40.12. Who has measured the waters with the hollow of his hand, and met out
the heavens with his span? So their first numbering was by their fingers; and
Solomon alludeth to this form, Pro. 3.6. Wisdom comes with length of days
in her right hand. The Greeks called this (...), because they numbered upon
their five fingers; Lib. 2. Fast.
so Ovidius,

Seu quia tot digitis per quos numerare Solemus.
So Invenal writing of Nestor;

-- Sua dextra computat annos.
They numbered upon their ten fingers, because no simple number can go beyond
nine, and the tenth number is the complement of all simple numbers.

They numbered, first with their right hand upon the left, because the right
was the most fit hand for action, for the spirits lie in the right side of the
heart, and so make the right hand more fit to do any thing; and the blood
lies more to the left side, and therefore the left hand is not so fit for
action. Solomon says, that the wise man's heart is at his right hand, Eccles.
10.2. the spirits enableth his hand more to do; and the fools is at his left
hand, because there are not so many spirits in the left side of the heart to
quicken the hand; but when the spirits incline equally to both the sides, then
he is [Itter jad] ambidexter, (...) Ambidexter.
that could use the left hand as well as the right; such were the men of
Benjamin and Ehud; it should not be translated left handed, Judge. 3.15. but he
who used both the hands.

They numbered upon the left hand from one to ninety nine, Plinius. Lib. 44.
and at an hundredth they began to turn to the right hand; therefore Ianus was
set up at Rome, with the number of the days in the year upon his hands,
having the great number upon his right hand, and the small number upon his left.

The way how they numbered upon the left hand was this; when they counted one,
Beda de ratione temporum.
they laid the point of their little finger in the midst of their palm; The
manner of their counting from 10. to 100.
when they counted 2, they laid the ring finger upon the palm of their hand,
when they counted 3, they laid their middle finger upon the palm of their
hand; when they counted 4, they lifted up their little finger from the palm of
their hand, and they left other two fingers lie still upon the palm of their
hand; when they counted 5, they lifted up the ring-finger from the palm of
their hand; and when 6, they lifted up the middle finger; when 7, they laid the
point of their little finger about the middle of their hand; and when 8, the
ring-finger about the middle of their hand; when 9, the middle finger about the
middle of their hand; when 10, they laid the nail of their forefinger at the
middle of the thumb; when 20, they laid the nail of the forefinger betwixt
the joints of the thumb; when 30. All numbers under an hundred were counted
upon the left hand.
they laid the nail of the forefinger and the nail of the thumb together;
when 40, they laid the thumb upon the forefinger crosse-wayes; when 50, they
inclined the thumb to the palm of the hand; when 60, they laid the top of the
forefinger to the thumb; when 70. they laid the nail of the thumb to the top
of the forefinger; when 80, they laid the nail of the thumb betwixt the
forefinger and middle finger; when 90. they laid the nail of the forefinger at
the root of the thumb. Luke 15.4. The Parable seems to allude to this form
of counting, he left ninety and nine and sought that one which was lost.

All numbers from an hundred to a thousand upon the right hand.
Then they transferred the numbers from their left hand to the right hand, and
they numbered hundreths upon the right hand, as they number simple numbers upon
the left hand.

When they came to reckon 1000, they laid the palm of their left hand upon
their breast, with their fingers spread; when 2000, they laid the back of
their left hand upon their breast with their fingers spread; All numbers from
1000 to 100000. they numbered with their left hand.
when they numbered 30000, they laid the palm of their left hand upon their
breast with their fingers upward; when they numbered 40000, they laid the back
of their left hand upon their breast, and their fingers downward; when 50000,
they laid the palm of their left hand upon their navell, with their fingers
upward; when 60000, they laid the back of their hand upon their navell, with
their fingers downward; when 70000, they laid the palm of their left hand upon
their left thigh, with their fingers crossewayes; when 80000, they laid the
back of their left hand upon their left thigh, with their fingers upward; when
90000, they laid the palm of their left hand upon their left thigh, with their
fingers downward; so that the hand was laid twice up and twice down, backward
and forward upon their breast, navell, and thigh, therefore Plautus says, Ecce
autem avertit nixus laeva, in femore habet manum, dextra digitis rationem
computat feriens femur, that is, he turns his left hand from his left thigh,
and is come with his right to smite upon his right thigh, to signify an
exceeding great number.

When they came to 100000, After 100000. they counted the same way with their
right hand.
they counted with their right hand upon their belly, navell, and thigh, as
they did before until they came to 10000000.

The Hebrews, Greeks, and Latins, counted likewise by the letters of their
Alphabet; M. Mill. D. Dimidium mill. X. Because it consists of two VV. V.
Because it stands in the fifth place amongst the Vowels.
the Hebrews and Greeks numbered by all the letters of the Alphabet; but the
Latins had only six by which they counted, M.D.C.X.V.I. M. for 1000. D. for
500. C. for 100. X. for 10. and I. for 1.

Afterward they numbered by Ciphers, which were but lately found out: The
Turks learned it from the Arabians; we from the Turks; and it comes from
the Hebrew word [Saphar] numerare; in the Arabicke, (...) Numerare.
Siphra est privatio, that is, a figure in the number which signifies nothing
by it self.

The Ancients did not only number with their fingers, but also speak with
them; unto which Solomon alludeth, Pro. 6.13. Allusion. In tarentilla.
The wicked man he speaks with his fingers; therefore Naevius says, Alij dat
annulum, alium invocat, cumque alio cantat, alijs denique dat digito literas;
Loqui digitis quid.
He gives a ring to one, he calls upon another, he sings with another, and to
others he gives letters by his fingers, that is, he mixeth his speeches with
others by poynting out Letters with his fingers. Beda libello de indigitatione.
Beda in his Book de indigitatione, sets down the manner how they spoke with
their fingers, after he has set down the manner how they counted with them,
for he says, De ipso computo quaedam manualis loquela figurari potest, qua
literis quis sigillatim expressis, verba quae eisde^ literis contineantur,
alteri qui hanc quoque noverit industriam tametsi long posito legenda and
intelligenda contradat: that is, out of the same numbering there may be drawn
out a certain speaking by the hands, which a man may deliver to another who
stands a far off, who has the same skill both to read and understand, and
this is by Letters expressed severally, and the whole words are contained in
these Letters. So that the same way a man counts with his fingers, that same
way does he speak with his fingers, for the first number upon the hand,
poynteth out the first Letter, the second number the second Letter, and so to
the end of the Alphabet, and the man that had the best dexterity did join the
Letters together, and made up a word or phrase, which only he and the speaker
understood.

Wisdom bids us bind her precepts to our fingers, Prove. 7.3. Alluding to
their Phylacteries which they had upon their Arms; so should we put those
numbers upon our hands, and continually make use of them for the shortness of
our life.

CHAPTER XXX. Of their civil Contracts, and manner of writing them.
IERE. 32.7. Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption
is thine to buy it, etc.
IN this contract and bargain between Jeremy and his Uncles son Hanameel,
consider first the manner how the contract was written; and secondly, how this
testimony is cited by Matthew, Cap. 27.7.

Scaliger in Elencho.
First, for the manner of writing the contract, he who was to buy the ground
wrote two Instruments, the one he sealed with his own Signet, Two Instruments
written at the buying of Land, one closed and another not closed.
the other he showed unclosed to the witnesses, that they might subscribe and
bear witness of that which was written: this the witnesses did subscribe upon
the back of the enclosed instrument, and these two Instruments were almost
alike in all things, save only that in the sealed Instrument something was
concealed from the witnesses, What things were concealed from the witnesses in
the closed Instrument.
the things concealed were these, the price of the Land, and the time of the
redemption, these they concealed, (for none knew these but the buyer and the
seller) in case that the Goel or the next of the kindred knowing the time of
the redemption, and the price, and the Morgager not being able to redeem it at
the day, it was lawful for the next of the kindred to have redeemed it; these
two being concealed, there was place still for the poor man to redeem his
Land after the day, therefore they set down in the enclosed Instrument, only
the bare disposition without the price or time of redemption. Calius Rodogineus.
So amongst the Romans, when they sealed their latter will, they concealed the
name of the heir, lest any wrong should be done unto him.

It may be asked how these words are cited by Matthew, chap. 27.9. Then was
fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the Prophet saying, and they took
the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued, which they of
the children of Israel did value, and gave them for a potters field, as the
Lord appointed me; he alleges Jeremy, but the words are spoken by Zecharie,
chap. 11.

This testimony in Matthew is made up of the saying of Jeremy and Zecharie,
The New Testament cites two places out of the old to make up one testimony.
and yet Jeremy is only cited by Matthew: for it is the manner of the new
Testament to make up one testimony of two cited out of the old Testament,
although written in diverse places in the old Testament. Example. Peter Acts
1.20. makes up but one testimony of diverse places collected out of the Psalm
69.17. and 109.8. so 1 Pet. 2.7. this testimony is made up of diverse
testimonies out of the Psalm 118.22. and Esaias 8.14. So Christ, Math. 21.5.
makes up one testimony out of Esaias 62.11. and Zach. 11.11. So Mat. 21.14. made
up of Esaias 56.7. and Iere. 7.11.

The New Testament in citing of two Prophets, express him who has the chief
part of the testimony.
Secondly, this is the manner of the New Testament, when testimonies are cited
out of two, they leave out the one and express only the other, and they cite
the whole testimony as written by one: example, Mat. 21.5. there is a testimony
cited out of two Prophets, yet they are cited but as one testimony, it is cited
out of two Prophets, Esaias 62.11. and Zach. 9.9. Yet the Evangelist says, that
it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet; the first words are
Esayes, the latter are Zacharies, and yet they are cited as if they were the
words of Zachary. So Mark. 1.2. As it is written in the Prophets; this
testimony is written both in Esaias and Malachy, Behold I send my Messenger
before thy face, etc. yet Mat. 3.3. Esaias is only cited and not Malachy.

Now let us consider here why the Evangelist cites here Jeremy rather than
Zachary, Why Matthew rather cites Jeremy than Zachary.
the Evangelist would give a reason here, not so much why Christ was bought by
the Scribes and Pharisees, as of the field which was bought for such a price;
Zachary speaks nothing of the field that was bought, wherefore it had not
been pertinent for the Evangelist to have brought in the testimony of Zachary
here. Jeremy in his thirtieth second Chapter tells when the Captivity was
now approaching, he is commanded to buy such a field, and in buying such a
field there was some secret mystery; secondly, there was some analogy, for
this field bought by Jeremy was a type of the Potters field, whereof Matthew
speaks, and the analogy consisted especially in this, the field which Matthew
makes mention of, was bought to be a burial for strangers, and this was typed
in the field which was bought by Jeremy, What time Jeremiah bought this field.
for Jeremy was commanded to buy this field at that time when he was taken
prisoner, and when there was little or no hope for him to come out of prison,
and when the City was besieged by the Chaldeans; the buyer might think now
that he had but small reason to buy that land, which was presently to be taken
by the Chaldeans; Jeremy might have said unto the Lord, the City is to be
delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and thou bidst me buy the field for
so much money, and the Lord says, I will deliver this City into the hand of
the Chaldeans; hence it may seem that this field was bought rather for
strangers than for the buyer himself, or any that belonged unto him; therefore
Lament. 5.2. Jeremy says, our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses
to Aliants.

But how could Anathoth be turned into a burial place?

It is answered, Anathoth was assigned to the Levites, Josh 11.18. These Cities
which were assigned unto the Levites, they had no feilds which were arable
about them, to bear Corn, but some ground for the feeding of their Cattle;
and it is most probable that they had some Gardens wherein they buried their
dead; as we read of Joseph of Arimathea, who had a Garden near the City in
which Christ was buried: Secondly, this field by Matthew is called the Potters
field, and here we may see some resemblance betwixt this field and the field
spoken of by Jeremy; for after the writs were perfected, Jeremy said to his
Scribe Baruch, take these writs and put them in an earthen pot, that they may
continue there for many days, verse. 14. There must be something typed by this,
that he bids take these writs and put them in an earthen pot, for men use to
put their writs in Chests and boxes and safest places; and as this buying of
the field was set down as an argument to strengthen the Israelites, that they
should return out of the Captivity, and possess their own lands; so it was a
type of that which Matthew speaks; and as this field which Jeremy bought was
turned into the use of strangers, so was the field which Matthew speaks of
made a burial for strangers; and as the writs were hid in the earthen pot in
Ieremies time, so was this field which Matthew speaks of, a Potters field. In
Zachary there is no mention made of the buying of the field with the thirty
pieces of silver, but Matthew speaks of buying of the field, and so does
Jeremy, therefore the Evangelist pertinently cites Jeremy and not Zachary.

Ioh. 5.39.

CHAPTER XXXI. What things the Goel was bound to do to his kinsman, and what
things were done to him by his brethren.
PROVE. 23.10. Remove not the old land mark, and enter not within the field of
the fatherless, for their Redeemer (or Goel) is mighty, and he will plead
their cause.
The privileges of the nearest kinsman.
HE that was the Goel in Israel, was bound to do three things for his brethren;
first, he was vindex sanguinis, the revenger of the blood; secondly, he
redeemed the morgaged lands of his kinsman: thirdly, he delivered him out of
prison. These three things he was bound to do jure propinquitatis, because he
was his nearest kinsman.

Now let us apply these to Christ our Goel, first our Goel, or vindex
sanguinis, the revenger of our blood, Christ our nearest kinsman has taken all
their privileges upon him for us.
revengeth all our wrongs. When the heart of the revenger of the blood was hot
within him, Deuteronomy. 19.6. it was a terrible thing for the manslayer to meet him,
he pursued eagerly after him. So Jesus Christ pursues after his enemies, who
shed the blood of his Church.

Secondly, the Goel redeemed the morgaged Land, Ruth 4.4. and Iere. 32.7.
Jeremy cousin to Hanameel redeemed his morgaged Land; we have morgaged our
inheritance in heaven, but our Goel Jesus Christ, who is flesh of our flesh and
bone of our bone, will redeem it to us again.

The the third thing which the Goel did to his kinsman, was to relieve him out
of prison. So we being condemned to that everlasting prison, Christ has bailed
us.

Now the privileges which the firstborn who was the Goel had done to him
were two; The privileges of the nearest kinsman as he was first borne.
First he had the double portion of his Fathers goods; And secondly, his second
brother was bound to raise up seed to him.

Jesus Christ our eldest brother, he is anointed with gifts above his
fellows, Psalm. 45. and from him we receive grace for grace, Ioh. 1.

The second thing which was due to the Goel was this, What the second brother
was bound to do for the eldest.
if he died without children then his second brother was bound to raise up seed
to him: and if he refused to do it, they pulled off his shoe and spit in his
face. The application of this is; Ministers are Christ's second brethren.
Christ our Eldest brother shall never want a seed in his Church to the worlds
end. When Onan refused to raise up seed to his brother, then Selah was bound to
do it, Genesis 38. So there shall be still some who shall perform this duty to
our Eldest brother.

Again the children were not called their children, but the eldest brothers
children. The application is, the Preachers are Christ's younger brethren,
therefore they should beget children to Christ, and not seek their own honor.

The portion of a slothful Minister.
If they refused to raise up seed to their brother, then their shoe was pulled
off, and they did spit in their face. Great shall be the shame of these who
refuse to do this duty to their elder brother Christ: their shoe shall be
pulled off, and they shall loose their part of that heavenly inheritance.

The Church having such a Goel, men should be loath to meddle with her. Prove.
23.10. Remove not the old marks, and enter not within the field of the
fatherless, for their Goel, or redeemer, is mighty, and he will plead their
cause: here he alludeth to that place, Deuteronomy. 25.8. The Lord is a Goel to all
his poor and distressed members: he was Joseph's Goel when he was in prison:
The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of
Jacob. Genesis 49.24.

CHAPTER XXXII. The difference betwixt the brother natural, and the kinsman in
raising up seed to the eldest brother, and what was done to them if they
refused.
LEVIT. 25.9. Then shall his brothers wife come unto him, etc.
THere was a twofold pulling off of the shoe in Israel, the first was for a
religious use, A two fold use of the pulling off the shoe.
the second for a civil use. First the religious use we see in Exodus 3.5. and
in Josh. 5.13. The second use was a politic use, and this politic or civil
use was two fold; Discalceatio firmateria Ded^cora.

the first served for the solemnity of their contracts, and it was called
firmatoria discalceatio; the second was for a punishment and disgrace Deuteronomy.
25.9. And it differed from that which was used in confirmation in sundry points.

First, when their shoe was taken off for a punishment

Secondly, that pulling off the shoe was for the disgrace of the man; but this
which was used in contracts

Thirdly, that pulling off of the shoe was by command, but this pulling off
the shoe was by custom. Ruth 4.7. This was the manner in former times in
Israel.

Psalm. 60.8. Over Edom I will cast my shoe, that is, (...) Detractio.
I will take possession of it: this was called [Hhalizah] detractio.









Seventie translate (...), and Josephus (...) to smite him in the face: but in
this litter there was no such disgrace offered to the man.

so shall it be done to the man who refuses to build his brothers house, Deuteronomy.
25.9. but in the latter there were no such words spoken.

his house was called domus discalceati in Israel; but there followed no such
disgrace to the man who pulled off his shoe in the contract.

They make another difference to be this, The differen^e betwixt the natural
brother and the kinsman.
that he who was the natural brother, when he raised up seed to his brother,
the children were not called his children, but his brothers children, and the
shoe was pulled off his foot, because he refused to do that honor to his
brother; but when a cousin-german raised up seed to his kinsman, the children
were not called after his kinsman that was dead, but as the father pleased to
call them. Boaz called not his son Machlon, after the first husband of Ruth,
but Obed.

But the question is, Deuteronomy. 25.6. the words in the original are these;
Primogenitus quem pepererit stabit super nomen fratris sui, shall succeed in
the name of his brother: therefore it may seem they were called after the
elder brothers name.

To succeed in the name is to succeed in the place, Jonathan paraphraseth it,
exurget in haereditate nomine fratris, to continue his name, but not to be
called after his name.

There were two sorts of brothers amongst the Jews, natural brethren and
legal brethren; the natural brother was bound to raise up seed to his eldest
brother; the elder first, and if he died, then the second, and then the third,
etc. Mat. 22. And if they did not, then they were punished and disgraced; but
those who were legal brethren, or cousin-germanes, as N. was to Machlon, they
were not compelled to marry them, but if they did not, there was some disgrace
put upon them, but not that great disgrace which was put upon the natural
brother. If a cousin-germane, or a legal brother had married his cousines
wife, the children which he begot upon her, were not called his children, but
his cousines children; even as the children which the natural brother begat,
were not his children but his elder brothers, and therefore N. says, Ruth 4.6.
I cannot redeem it, lest I mar my own inheritance; that is, these children
begotten upon Ruth should not be called my children, but my kinsmans, and so
all that I inherit should go to them.



CHAPTER XXXIII. Of their Marriages.
IVDG. 14.7. And he went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased
Sampson well, and after a time he returned to take her.
THey had their Sponsalia de futuro, and de praesenti; de futuro, as Lots
sons in law were but affianced to his daughters, they were not as yet
married, [Lokeh he benathau] accipientes uxores, (...) accepturi filias eius.
should be interpreted, Brevi post accepturi, for they knew not as yet a man,
Verse. 8. So Deuteronomy. 20.7. What is there that has betrothed a wife, and has not
taken her. So Joseph and Marie were affianced, see Deuteronomy. 22.24.

Betwixt their affiance and their marriage there intervened a time. Judge. 14.7.
And he went down and talked with the woman. This was for the affiancing; and
Verse. 8. After a time he returned again to take her; that is, to marry her:
the first time that he went down he killed the Lion; and the second time when
he went down to the marriage, he found honey in the Lions belly. After some
days, cannot be understood of a year, that a whole year intervened betwixt
their affiancing and their marriage, when the word Dies, When the word [Day]
signifies a year, and when a month.
is put in the plural number, and some less number following it, then it
signifies a year, and the less number signifies months; as Genesis 24.55. Let
her abide with us days or ten; that is, a year of days, or at the least ten
months. So 1 Samuel 27.7. David abode with the Philistims days and four
months; that is, a year of days and four months; so Ezekiel. 1.1. in the
thirtieth year, in the fourth, in the fifth of the month; that is, in the
fourth month, in the fifth day of the month; Days absolutely set down in the
Scripture signify an infinite time.
but when days are put alone, they signify an indefinite time, and not an
year; so Genesis 40.4. Fuerunt dies in custodia, that is, a certain time; so Lev
28.29. He shall redeem it within days, that is, within the time that he and
the man to whom he had morgaged the house agreed upon. So Judge. 14.8. After
days he returned to take her, that is, after a few days, and not after a
whole year; the preparation of a whole year, was enough for a Kings marriage.

Sponsalia de praesenti, were, when he said I take thee to my wife in the
present.

The time of their marriages was in the night, Mat. 25.6 At midnight the
Virgins came to wait for the bridegroomes returning with their Lamps in their
hands; so Luke 12.36.

Marriages of old were made three manner of ways, the first was called
Vsucapio, the second, confarreatio, and the third was called coemptio.

Per usum, vel usucapio, Perusum, vel usucapio.
when a man married a maid which had stayed almost a year with him; the
example which most resembles this in the Scripture, Per confarreati^nem.
was that of David, when he was old he took Abishaig to him, 1 King. 1.2.

Brissonius de ritu nuptiarum.
Per confarreationem, when the bridegroom married the bride, the bridegroom
took a Cake of bread, and brake it betwixt him and the bride, or some Corn,
and put betwixt their hands; to signify that they were to break bread, and to
live together in mutual society; Hosea alludeth to this form, Allusion.
Cap. 2.3. I bought her for an Homer of Barley. So Jesus Christ the husband of
his Church, married her per confarreationem, putting the bread in her hand, and
marrying her to himself in the Sacrament, to signify that he would dwell with
her for ever.

Per coemptionem.
The third sort was per coemptionem, for it was the manner of old, that the
bridegroom bought the bride for so much, and the bride gave little or no
dowry to the bridegroom; so the sons of Sichem bought Dina, The man gave
the dowry and not the woman.
Genesis 34.12. Ask me never so much dowry and I will give it: so David bought
Michol, Saul's daughter for so many foreskins of the Philistims, 1 Samuel 18.25.
And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. The bride brought only Donationes,
vel paraphernalia, as chains, bracelets, Genesis 24. but the dowry which they
gave was but a small thing. Pharaoh giving Gezar to Solomon, it was a present
and not a dowry.
1 King. 9.16. it is said that Pharaoh took Gezar from the Philistims, and
gave it to Solomon for a present, it should not be translated for a dowry.
Exodus 22.17. He shall pay money according to the dowry of Virgins; which is
but a little sum, fifty shekels, Deuteronomy. 22.29. Thus Christ bought his spouse
with his blood, Act. 20.29. she was a poor Damsel, and had nothing to give.

Marriages dissolved after the same manner they were made.
As their marriages were made by one of these three Ceremonies, per usum,
confarreationem, and coemptionem; So amongst the Romans, Vsurpatio.
Diffarreatio. Renuncipatio.
the marriage was dissolved after the same manner. The first was dissolved
usurpatione, if the woman whom he had married (being his maid before) had
stayed but three nights from her husband, then by the Roman law he might put
her away; the second was dissolved diffarreatione, they brake bread and so
departed; the third was dissolved renuncipatione, they took their hands
asunder and so departed; this the Greeks called (...), and the Latins,
Divortium.

The Ceremonies which they used in their Marriages were these; first, he put a
Ring upon her finger; (...) Postulationes Sponsaliorum, Sponsalia sacra ob
matrimonium.
the Hebrews called this [Tebhignoth Kedushim] and he said, be thou my wife
according to the law of Moses and of Israel, and this he did before witnesses;
this was called Subarrhatio, this Ring was put upon the fourth finger of the
left hand, because a vein comes from the heart to that finger, as the
Physicians say.

The day when the bride was married, she took the veil off her face, this
was called (...), and the gifts which were given that day, were called (...);
before she was married, she put a veil upon her face, and this was called
(...), and the gifts which were given to her before the marriage were called
(...).

The solemnities in the marriages were these; first, Diverse solemnities used at
the marriage.
they put a crown upon the head of the bridegroom, and then upon the bride,
and the crown was made of Roses, Myrtle, and Ivy, and the mother of the
bridegroom put this crown upon his head. Cant. 3.11. Go forth, O ye
daughters of Sion, and behold King Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother
crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his
heart.

This crown wherewith the bride and the bridegroom were crowned, was but a
corruptible crown; but that crown, (...) non pollutus, est and nomen gemma
sic dicta quod in ignem conjectae non consumatur.
which we shall get in the life to come, fades not, nor falls not away, 1
Pet. 1.4. (...) is a precious stone, which if ye cast it in the fire it never
consumes; so (...) flos amoris, a flower that never fades. (...)
immarcessibilis, nunquam marcescens, flos quidam sic dictus quod non marcescat.


In their marriages they had those who accompanied the bridegroom, and they
were called Socij sponsi, the children of the wedding; and the Greeks (...) or
(...) a (...), circuire. All the time of the wedding they might do nothing but
attend the bridegroom, they might not fast in the time of the marriage nor
mourn, Mat. 9.15. Can the children of the wedding mourn so long as the
bridegroom is with them?

Who was the bridegroomes friend.
He who chiefly attended the bridegroom was called (...), such a one was he to
whom Sampsons wife was given, who was called his companion, the Chaldie called
him [Shushebhinah] Pronubus or auspex; (...) Pronubus, Auspex.
this was not a friendly part in Sampsons companion to take the bride from him,
for he that has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the
bridegroom which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly, because of the
voice of the bridegroom, Ioh. 3.29. So in the spiritual marriage the
Preachers who are Auspices or Pronubi, should not seek the bride to
themselves, seeking themselves and their own praise, but let the bridegroom
have the bride.

What was the chief office of the bridegroomes friend.
They who were (...), brought the bride into the tent of the bridegroomes
mother, to signify now that she should be in that same place that his mother
was in, Genesis 24.67. They brought her into the tent of Sara, and so the bride
brought the bridegroom into her mothers chamber, Cant. 3.4. I held him and
would not let him go, until I had brought him to my fathers house, and to the
chambers of her that conceived me; she brought him into her mothers tent, to
signify that she should leave father and mother and cleave unto her husband.

They did two things after the marriage, first they blessed them, and then they
sang (...), a marriage song, rejoicing for their marriage.

First, they blessed them, Ruth 4.11. The manner of blessing the bridegroom.
All the people that were in the gates, and the Elders said, we are all
witnesses; and the blessing was this, the Lord make the woman that is come into
thine house, like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of
Israel, and do thou worthily in Ephrata, and be thou famous in Bethlehem: This
was the blessing given to the bride. And again, Verse. 12. Let thy house be
like the house of Pharez (whom Tamar bare unto Judah) of the seed which the
Lord shall give thee of this young woman: This was the blessing which they gave
to the bridegroom.

They prayed, the Lord make thee like Rachel; The explanation of the blessing.
it was their manner in their blessings to allege the examples of those who
had been happy and prosperous, and so when they cursed any body, they brought
forth the example of the most wretched and miserable creatures, Ierem. 30.21.
The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the King of Babylon roasted
in the fire; such was the curse pronounced against the adulterous woman, Number.
5.2. The Lord make thee an oath and a curse among thy people.

The Lord make thee like Rachel and Leah: Why Rachel and Lea are taken for
examples in the blessing.
Why like Rachel and Leah? Because these two came out of their Country with
their husbands, and left their Parents, so did Ruth with Naomi to get a
husband; secondly, like Rachel and Leah, because these two sought children of
their husbands modestly, Genesis 30.1. and verse. 16. So did Ruth of Boaz. Thirdly,
why like Rachel and Leah, and not like Bilhah and Zilpha? Because these two
were but handmaids, and they were not the mothers of many children, as Rachel
and Leah. Fourthly, why first like Rachel and then like Leah? Because Rachel
was more beloved than Leah. Fifthly, why like Rachel and Leah, and not like Sara
and Rebecca? Because there came of them the Ismaelites, who were not of the
Church, as well as the Israelites.

To do worthily is to do virtuously.
Do thou worthily in Ephrata: in the Hebrew it is fac virtutem; the Hebrews
put virtue for the substance gotten by virtuous doing, Psalm. 49. He shall leave
his substance behind him; in the original it is, he shall leave his virtue
behind; and Prove. 31. Fecerunt potentiam, id est, compararunt opes.

Let thy house be like the house of Pharez; because there were five families in
the Tribe of Judah, and Pharez was the chief of them, Number. 26.20. They pray
then first that they may have children; secondly, that they may have means to
maintain and bring up their children; and thirdly, that they may live in
credit among their people.

What song they sung after the marriage.
After the marriage they did sing epithalamium, a song of praise in commendation
of the Bridegroom and Brid, Psalm. 45. so Psalm. 77. your virgins were not
praised, that is, they were not married: and the house of marriage the Jews
called it [beth hillel,] domus laudis.

The morrow after the marriage the Bridegroom came forth out of his
bride-cha^ber in great pomp with his Bride, (...)
out under the veil; and these who heard his voice rejoiced because then the
marriage was consummated: and David alludeth to this, Psalm. 19. for as the
Bridegroom made glad the hearts of his friends when he came out of his Tent or
covering; An anologie betwixt the Sun rising and the Bridegroomes coming out
of his chamber the morrow after his marriage.
so the Sun when he comes out of his chamber gladdeth the earth: his going
out is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit to the end of it. Luke 1.
Christ is called (...), the Sun rising from the East, that Sun of
righteousness coming out of the bosom of his Father, and out of his
bedchamber rising in the East, did shine upon the Jews in the South, and next
upon us Gentiles in the North, Cant. 7.9.

The conclusion of this is. We are married to Jesus per confarreationem, when
he gives us the blessed Sacrament, therefore let us come worthily to it, that
we take it not as Judas did the soppe, Ioh. 13. for that will make
diffarreationem, or (...), a divorce from him for ever.

Secondly, we are married to him per coemptionem, Kedar: Miriam and Aaron
grudged against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married Numb.
12.1. so was his Church Cant. 1.5. I am black, but yet if she had been rich,
which is a second beauty, it had been something; but being both black and
poor, there was a hard matter for the Lord to marry her. A certain woman
being asked what dowry she gave to her husband, she answered that she should
keep her self chaste unto him only, as a chaste spouse. So we having nothing
to bestow upon him, but he having pity upon us when we were naked and
uncomely, let us study to meet him with hearty affection again, and not to
fall a whoring after other gods, which if we do he will make us comely as the
curtains of Solomon.

Thirdly, they sung praises and rejoiced at the marriage Revel. 19.7.

CHAPTER XXXIIII. Whether a brother natural (to keep the Tribes
distinguished) might marry his brothers wife or not in Israel, or is it meant
only of the next kinsman?
DEVT. 25.5. If brethren dwell together, and one of them have no seed, etc.
THe Law is given first to natural brethren, and not to kinsmen only: for the
Text says, if brethren dwell together, and one of them die and have no child,
Numerus cardinalis pro ordinali, vuus pro primo: as the evening and the morning
was one day, that is, the first day. Genesis 1.
now what brethren dwelt together? are they not natural brethren: and one of
them have no seed, that is, if the eldest of them have no seed, vnus pro primo.

And that it is meant of natural brethren, see it by the practice of the
people of God, for when Er died Onan was bound to raise up seed to him, Genesis
38.9. So Ruth 1. The second brother was to marry his eldest brothers wife.
when Machlon the elder brother died without children, then the inheritance
came to Chilion. And when Chilion died without children, then his Uncle his
nearest kinsman was to succeed; and last the brothers children or cousin
germans, and he who was to succeed in the inheritance, it was he who was bound
to marry his brothers wife: wherefore the Law means first of the natural
brother, and if there were no natural brethren, then the cousins or next
kinsmen were to do this duty.

When the Sadduces propounded the question to Christ, that seven brethren
married one wife; it is meant of seven natural brethren, see Tobit 3.8. And
where it is said Deuteronomy. 25.5. the wife of the dead shall not marry with a
stranger, what is that, with a stranger? That is with one who is not of the
family of him who is dead. And first she was bound to marry with the natural
brother, who was not a stranger, and if there had not been a natural brother,
then with the next of the kinsmen, who was not a stranger. Wherefore ijbbam and
(...) are understood first of the natural brother, and then of the next
kinsman.

Israel. But if the brother married his brothers wife, then his children were
not called his children, but his eldest brothers children, and so his name was
blotted out in Israel: and so he might have set up a pillar as Absalon did for
continuance of his name, because he had no children of his own.

Psalm. 72.19. To be the father of Jesus Christ according to the flesh, a
greater blessing to the second brother, then to have children of his own.
coram sole filiabitur nomen ejus per successionem filiorum, we see what befell
Onan because he refused to do this duty, he said the seed should not be
his, therefore the Lord slew him, Genesis 38.9.10.

God expressly forbad in his Law, that a man should lie with his wives sister,
and by the same Law it is forbidden that a man should lie with his brothers
wife, this might seem to be incest and confusion.

God has many exceptions from his own Law.
has given this law also. And as the Jews say, qui observare jussit Sabbatum,
is etiam jussit profanare Sabbatum. So the Lord who forbad a man to lie with
his brothers wife, has reserved this privilege to himself to make an
exception from the law. The Lord commanded in his Law Deuteronomy, 24.4. If a man put
away his wife and she go from him, and become another man's wife, he may not
take her again to wife; yet the Lord took his Church again Ier. 3.1. he has
reserved sundry privileges to himself and exceptions from the Law.

Morale positivum. Divinum positivum.
Secondly, we must distinguish here betwixt these laws which are moral
positive laws, and these which are divine positive laws. We must distinguish
betwixt the moral positive part of the Law, and the divine positive part.
Moral positive laws are such, which the very light of nature commands.
Divine positive laws are these, which are accessory commandments added to
the first. Example. This is a moral positive law, that a man should not lie
with his mother, nor with his mother in-law; for this is a fornication that is
not named amongst the Gentiles, 1 Cor. 5.1. And it was for this sort of incest
that the Cananites were cast out of Canaan. So this is primarium jus naturae,
or morale positivum, that a man should not lie with his daughter, nor his
daughters daughter, descendendo descending downward. What is primarium, and
what is secundarium ius naturae.
But this again is divinum positivum, or secundariu^ jus naturae, in the
collateral line that a man should not lie with his sister or his brothers
wife, no marriage in the collateral line was forbidden at the first by the law
of nature, or moral positive law, but it was forbidden afterward by the
divine positive law, Levit. 18.16. When Judah lay with his daughter in-law, this
was incest in the highest degree, because it was contrary to jus natural, or
morale positivum. So when the Corinthian lay with his mother in-law, it was
against morale positivum, (...) Amita, it should not be translated Patruclis
his cousin german but, his fathers sister. See Number. 26.59.
or jus natural. But when Amram married Iochabed his fathers sister, Exodus
6.20. this was not against the moral, positive, or natural part of the Law,
because it was not in the right line, but in the collateral, although in the
nearest degree, it was against the divine positive law.

And for to replenish his Church with people, God oversaw this sort of marriage
at the first. But God does more here, he commands the brother to raise up
seed to his brother. First this is not contra primarium jus naturae, because it
was not in the right line. Secondly it is an exception from secundarium jus
naturae: for when God willed them to do this, he willed them not to do this
to satisfy lust, for that was contrary to primarium jus naturae, but only
that the elder brother might be a type of Jesus Christ, who should never want
a seed in his Church. If a woman were barren, the Lord could not command
another man to go in unto her and beget children upon her, for that were
contra primarium jus naturae; the Lord will not suffer now that a brother
should marry a sister, as he did in the beginning of the world, neither if a
brother now should marry his eldest brothers wife were it lawful, for now the
eldest brother is not a type of Christ, and it should not be an exception from
the Law, but contra secundarium jus naturae.



CHAPTER XXXV. Of their prisons and places of punishment.
GENESIS 39.20. And Joseph's Master took him, and put him into the prison: a place
where the Kings prisoners were bound.
THey had sundry sorts of Prisons; first, they had Warding, Of their place of
punishment.
as Shimei was confined not to come over the brook Kedron; and, Abiather in
Anathoth, and he who killed casually was confined in the City of Refuge; Three
sorts of Prisons among the Jews.
this was a free sort of Prison, at the first Carcer non erat pars paenae, the
Prison was not a part of the punishment.

Secondly, they had another sort of Prison, in which they were more restrained
than in the Ward, they were kept in Prison, but others had access to them, as
when John was in Prison, his Disciples had access to him; so Paul was in
bonds, but yet he begot Onesimus in his bonds, Phil. 1.

Thirdly, they had a more strait Prison called (...), Custodia, a close Prison.

And fourthly, they had a deep or a low pit; the Greeks called it Barathrum
in Athens, and at Rome it was called Tullianum; such was that Prison in which
Jeremy was let down with cords in a Dungeon, where was no water but mire,
Allusion.
Iere. 38.6. And Zachary alludeth to this, Zach. 9.11. As for thee also by the
blood of thy Covenant, I have sent forth thy Prisoners out of the Pit wherein
is no water.

See Nehem. 3.25.
There were some Prisons within the City of Jerusalem, and some without the
City; within the City, as the house of Jonathan, Some Prisons within, and
some without the walls of Jerusalem.
which was near the Kings Palace, Iere. 37.15. So the Dungeon of Malchior, the
son of Hammelech, Iere. 38.6. So they had Prisons without the gate, as that
Prison wherein Peter was put, Act. 12.10. And when they had passed the first
and the second Ward, (that is, the quaternions of Soldiers that kept him) they
came unto the iron gate that leads unto the City: this Prison was without
the gate near Mount Calvarie, and it was the loathsomest and vilest Prison of
all, for in it the thieves who were carried to Calvarie to be executed were
kept. Allusion.
And Christ alludeth to this Prison, Mat. 25.30. Cast him into utter
darkness, where there shall be weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth:
which Allusion could not be understood, unless there had been a dark Prison
without the City, where was utter darkness.

Now let us compare Ezechiels Ward, Cap. 4. A difference betwixt three sorts of
Prisons.
Ieremies Prisons, Iere. 37. and 38. and Peter's Prison, Act. 12.

Ezechiel when he was warded in his own house by the Lord, Cap. 3.24. First,
These things were not done in vision but really, for when he says a thing was
done in vision, he says, in similitudine only.
he was commanded to stay in his own house; secondly, he was commanded to lie
three hundredth and ninety days upon his left side, Cap. 4.4. and forty days
upon his right side, Verse. 6. Then for his diet, he is commanded to take wheat,
barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fetches, and to put them all
in one vessel, and to make bread of them, Verse. 9. there was no choice of
bread here, and then to cover and bake it with man's dung, Verse. 12. or at the
least with cowes dung, Verse. 15. And for the quantity, he should eat it by
measure, twenty shekels weight every day, Verse. 10. which was ten ounces; and
his drink was by measure the sixth part of an Hin of water, Verse. 11. which was
as much as twelve eggs would hold.

Now let us see how Jeremy was handled in his Prison, Shemajah gave
commandment by a Letter to put him in the stocks, Iere. 29.26. In the Hebrew
it is [El. hazinok] navis sugentis, as ye would say, (...)
the ship of the sucker, they closed the Prisoner between two boords, and they
gave him some liquor in the mean time to preserve his life. So Iere. 11.19.
Mittamus lignum in panem ejus; Chaldeus, proijciamus lignum, that is, if he
will, let him eat the stocks, he shall have no other bread, or, corrumpamius
panem ejus, the english translation has it, let us destroy the stalk with his
bread; and Jeremy was in a deep Dungeon where he stood in mire and clay,
Iere. 38.6. So they used to put them in the stocks; they were at the first
called Nervi, because they were made of the sinews of beasts, and afterward
they were made of iron, Psalm. 105.18. whose feet they hurt with fetters, he
was laid in iron.

Peter's Prison a loathsome Prison.
Then for Peter's Prison, it was utter darkness, without the City, that the
stench and filthiness of these prisoners might not be offensive to the
Citizens, the most loathsome Prison of all, and the darkest Prison, and
therefore a great wonder when the light shined in it, Act. 12.7.

Three sorts of Prisons.
There are three Prisons; first, our mothers belly, in which we are first
Prisoners; and secondly, the grave; and thirdly, the Prison of the wicked in
hell.

This first prison it is a strait prison; it was a great preservation when
Jonas was preserved three days in the Whales belly, the weeds being wrapped
about his head, and the earth with her bars closed him round about, Jonah.
2.5. Yet his life was brought up from corruption; it is as wonderful a
preservation in our mothers belly how we should live, being so wrapped there
and preserved from corruption; he was but kept there three days, but man is
kept nine months.

The grave a strong Prison.
Our second Prison is the grave, Jonas was kept in the Whales belly with jaws
and teeth; Peter was kept in the Prison with four quaternions of Soldiers;
but man is kept within this Prison with a more terrible guard, when the body is
sown in corruption, in dishonor; and in weakness, 1 Cor. 15.43. And
oftentimes with sin the greatest enemy of all, Job 10.11. their sins lie
down in the dust with them, that is, in the grave, this Prison keeps a man
sure.

Hell a terrible and fearful Prison.
The last Prison is that of the wicked in hell; man when he dies is said to
return to his own earth. Ps. 146.4. That is, he has right to the earth,
because he was made of the earth, and he must return to it again; So the
wicked have right to hell, it is their proper inheritance, Judas went to his
own place, Act. 1.35.

A child when he is in his mothers belly, his first prison, although he be
wrapped up there, and closely kept, yet he has a kind and loving keeper, his
mother; but the grave is a terrible keeper and an enemy, 1 Cor. 15.26. Yet
this enemy must render up her dead again; and even as the Whale spued out
Jonas, because he could not concoct him; so shall the grave cast up her dead
again, not being able to concoct them; but there is no redemption out of hell
the last prison: In other Prisons, men have found some mitigation and favor,
but never any in this prison. Joseph was put in fetters, the iron entered into
his soul, Psalm. 105.18. That is, the iron cut his flesh, and came as it were
to the soul; but the Lord was with him, and extended kindness unto him, and
gave him favor in the sight of the Keeper of the Prison, Genesis 39.21. But in
this prison the Lord is not with them, neither find they any favor in the
eyes of their Keeper; but as the Task-maisters doubled the Task upon the poor
Israelites in Egypt, and were heavy exactors over them, and said daily to
them, Get you to your burdens; so these fiends of hell are rigorous exactors
over the wicked: Jeremy when he was in a deep Prison, yet he had Ebedmelech
to intercede for him, Iere. 38.7. but none do intercede for the wicked. Peter
was in a dark Prison, yet the light did shine about him, his fetters fell off
from him, and the Angel led him forth, and set him free; But in hell, there is
no light nor no redemption out of it.

Jeremy prayed unto the King Zedechias, that he would not cause him to return
to the house of Jonathan the Scribe (which was the prison) lest he died there,
Iere. 27.20. So let us put up our supplications to the Lord, that he would not
send us into that eternal Prison to die for ever.

CHAPTER XXXVI. Of their Whipping.
DEVT. 35.3. Forty stripes may be given him, and not exceed.
Diverse sorts of punishments.
THere were sundry sorts of punishments amongst the Jews; first, damnum,
secondly, vincula, thirdly, verbera, fourthly, talio, fifthly, ignominia,
sixthly, servitus, seventhly, mors. But they never used to banish any, because
they would not put them where there was a strange Religion professed.

When they whipped their malefactors; first they had a respect to the offense
committed; and secondly, to the person who was to be whipped; and thirdly, to the
whip.

They had a respect both to the person and to the offense in whipping.
First, they had a respect to the offense; in simplici delicto, they might not
exceed forty stripes, but they might diminish the number of the stripes, if
the person offending had been of a weak body; Secondly, for a double offense
they might not exceed forty, but they were to give him the full forty all at
once; if a man had committed theft, and with all had added perjurie, this was a
double offense, and for this he got the rigor, full forty.

If he had a strong body, and committed a double offense, then he got the full
forty all at one time; secondly, if he had a strong body and committed a
simple offense, then he got not the full number; thirdly, if he had had a weak
body and committed a double offense, then he got the full number, but at two
several times; but if he had been of a weak body, and committed a simple
offense, then the number of the stripes was much diminished.

Again, they considered how many stripes the offender might bear, and the
number of the stripes which the whip gave: Example, the offender is able to
bear twenty stripes, and they adjudge him to have twenty stripes; now they
give him but six blows, for if they had given him seven blows, they should
have exceeded the number prescribed, for the whip wherewith they whipped them
had three thongs, and if they perceived that he grew faint and weak, when they
were beating him, they diminished some of the number; if they ordained that he
should have twelve stripes, and observed in the mean time that he fainted not,
yet they exceeded not that number twelve, which they had ordained to give him
at the first.

When they whipped Paul, 2 Cor. 11.24. and gave him thirtie-nine stripes at
three several times; first, it seems that he has been of a strong body;
secondly, it was for three several offenses (as they thought) that they beat
him; The offender was not whipped thrice for one fault.
for if the offender had thrice committed the self same fault, then he was no
more beaten, but he was shut up within a narrow wall, wherein he might neither
sit nor stand, and there he was fed Pane afflictionis and aqua pressurae;
example, if he had eaten the fat twice, Levit. 3.17. he was but beaten twice;
but if he had eaten the third time of it, then he was shut up in a close
prison, or such a prison in which Ahab commanded Micheas to be put, 1 King.
22.27.

The offender was bowed down when he was beaten, Deuteronomy. 25.2. he neither sat
nor stood, and he who whipped him, stood upon a stone, and he let out or in the
whip, by drawing up or down the knot upon it; for when the knot was drawn up,
then the thongs spread farther and gave a shrewder blow; and when the knot was
drawn down, then the thongs were contracted, and they gave the lesser blow;
when he stood behind him, then he whipped him upon the breast and belly, and he
gave him three blows at a time; and when he stood before him, he lashed him
upon the shoulders, and gave him six blows, three upon every shoulder.

Three Judges stood by when they were whipped.
There stood three Judges by when he was whipped, the first repeated these words
of the Law to him, Deuteronomy. 28.58. If thou obey not all these things, then the
Lord shall multiply thy plagues: the second Judge numbered the stripes; (...)
Maymone Hal: Sauht: cap. 16.
and the third Judge said to the whipper, Lay on, shelishi omer lachozen hacce,
Dicit ei qui portat flagellum, percute.

He who was beaten, was not disgraced by this beating, Whipping was not a
disgrace amongst the Jews.
for whipping amongst them was but as a civil mulct, or fine, not a disgrace
as it is amongst us, and therefore the Lord said, Deuteronomy. 25.3. That thy brother
should not seem vile in thine eyes. When they whipped any of their brethren,
they did it not in scorn or derision, but in compassion, they looked upon him,
and received him after the punishment, as their brother again: and as he who
looked upon Cato Vticensis seeing him drunk, turned away his eyes and seemed
to take no notice of it, being ashamed that such a grave man should be so
overtaken; so did they behold their brethren with pity, and were ready to
cover their offense, and would not upbraid them afterward for it.









CHAPTER XXXVII. Whether an Israelite that had lien with a bondmaide, that was
betrothed, was whipped or not?
LEVIT. 19.20. And whosoever lies carnally with a woman that is a bond-maide,
betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed nor freedom given her, she
shall be scourged.
THe Jews did hold, if an Israelite had lien with a bondwoman betrothed, and
not redeemed, she was to be beaten, and he was to offer a sacrifice for his
offense; she was to be beaten, because she was not a freewoman, and she had
nothing to offer, and although she had, yet she could not offer it, because she
was a stranger and not converted.

The Seventie translate it (...), (...) Vapulatio erit a (...) Bos
from [Bakar] Inquirere; but it comes from [Bakar] Bos, because they were
whipped with a thong of oxe-leather, and some translate it Nervo bovino.

The reason why the Jews held that the woman should only be beaten is this,
(...) The Jews held that the woman was beaten and not the man.
because the word [Tihich] is in the feminine gender, and they read it, she
shall be beaten and not the man; he committed not adultery, he polluted not
another man's wife, nor a freewoman, but a stranger, and a slave, therefore he
was not to be beaten, but to offer a sacrifice; but this word [Tihieh] may
agree as well with [Bikkoreth] which is in the feminine gender, and not to
read it ipsa erit vapulatio, she shall be beaten, but there shall be a
beating, that is, they shall be both beaten, and the man so much the rather,
because he lay with her who was betrothed to another; and the words following
seem to imply so much, they shall not be put to death; this whipping shall be
a sufficient punishment for them: the Seventie translate it (...), but Jonathan
in his Paraphrase following the rest of the Hebrews, paraphraseth it thus,
Scrutatio erit in judicio ejus; ut vapulet ipsa rea, and non ipse.



The punishment of the man and the woman was alike for every uncleanness.
in cunctis nuditatibus pares sunt vir and faemina; if a free man had lien with
a freewoman in Israel, then he was bound to marry her, or else to pay her
dowry; secondly, if a free man lay with a bond-maide that was betrothed and
not redeemed, then they were both whipped; but neither of them put to death; he
died not although the woman was betrothed, because she was not a freewoman;
thirdly, if a free man had lien with a freewoman betrothed, then they were both
to die; fourthly, if a free man had lien with a married woman, then they were
both to die, Deuteronomy. 25. Fifthly, if a married man had lien with an unmarried
woman, they were both to die: lastly, if both the persons had been married,
they were both to die; here in cunctis nuditatibus sunt pares, vir and faemina.







CHAPTER XXXVII. De Lege Talionis, Of the Law of Retaliation.
EXODUS 21.24. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
THe Lawyers when they interpret this Law, they say, that there is talio
analogica and talio jdentitatis; Talio Analogica. Identitatis.

and they say, that talio identitatis should be observed, if the cause be
alike, and the persons, and the manner of doing. Example; a private man beats
out his neighbors eye in spite and malice, therefore his eye should be pulled
out again; but talio similitudinis is then to be observed: when the fact
varieth in many circumstances, as who did it, to whom he did it, etc. then
talio analogica should be observed, but not identitatis: example; if a son
should beat his father, he should not be beaten again, but he should die the
death; here they observe not medium rei, but medium personae. Medium Rei.
Personae.

Example the second, in that Parable of Nathan to David, when the rich man came
and took the poor man's sheep, 1 Samuel 12.3. Here medium rei was not to be
observed, but medium personae, because he was a rich man. So in commutatiue
Justice we observe medium rei, but in distributive Justice we observe medium
personae.

Again, they distinguish betwixt Radamantheum jus, The strict sense of the Law
of Retaliation.
the strict sense of the Law, and (...) or (...), or reciproca paena. The
strict sense of the Law is, when literally they will have eye for eye, and
tooth for tooth; the milder sense of the Law, is, when they will have some
other satisfaction for the wrong done: the Jews generally follow this sense of
the Law, if a man did beat out his neighbors eye, or his tooth; they followed
not this Rhadamantheum ius, The milder sense of the Law of Retaliation.
or the strict sense of the Law, that he should pay one of his own eyes, or
one of his own teeth for it, but that he should satisfy the man whom he had
wronged, by paying so much money to him; for in these cases that were not
deadly, they held that they might make recompense and satisfaction by money:
and they give this instance out of the Law; if an Ox were wont to push with
his horn, and it has been testified to his owner, and he has not kept him
in, but that he has killed a man or a woman, then the Ox shall be stoned to
death, and his owner shall be put to death, or if there be a sum of money
laid upon him, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is
laid upon him, Exodus 21.30.31. Here he might redeem his life with a ransom,
because he was not the direct killer, if he satisfied the parties by giving a
sum of money. So they held that they might satisfy for such transgressions
which were not capital, by paying of money. And the law of the twelve Tables
amongst the Romans says, The Roman Law of Retaliation.
Si unum perfoderit unius jactura multari, si utrumque unius tantum ut sceleris
sui notam gestare possit; and quoniam funesta and impia manus amputari ei
debet, pro manu ablata, bessis patrimonij sui irrogatur, idque in solatium
vitae ejus cui oculi sunt effossi, auferto. If he had put out both the man's
eyes, they would take but one of his eyes, and cut the hand from him for the
other eye, and then they mitigated that part of the punishment, and they made
him pay the fourth part of his substance to relieve the man whose eyes he had
put out.

The Heathen say, that Ceres the goddess of Corn, Simile.
cut off the shoulder of Pelops, Ceres could not set in a shoulder of flesh and
bone again, therefore the gods took the next best course, and they ordained
her to put in a shoulder of Ivorie to Pelops: so he that had beaten out an eye
or a tooth of a man, he could not put it in again; therefore they thought it
good that he should put in a shoulder of Ivorie, that is, with his goods to
maintain him whom he had hurt.

CHAPTER XXXVIII. That theft amongst the Jews, was not capital.
EXODUS 22.1. If a man shall steal an Ox or a Sheep and kill it or sell it, he
shall restore five Oxen for an Ox, and four Sheep for a Sheep.
THeft by the Law of Moses was punished by restitution, paying sometimes two
for one, Three sorts of Precepts amongst the Hebrews.
or four for one, or at the most five for one, and not above.

The Hebrews had three sorts of Commandments, (...) Graviae (...) Levia.
(...) Media. (...) Praecepta

first, they had [Mitzboth Hhamuroth] Praecepta gravia, and [Mitzboth Kalloth]
Praecepta levia: those which they call, Praecepta gravia, here they say the
punishment is always indispensable, as the murderer is always to die the
death. Secondly, they had Praecepta levia, as not to kill the dam sitting upon
the eggs; this was one of the judicial Laws of the lightest sort, for there
was no punishment in Israel for transgression of this Law; so if an Ox had
killed a man, his flesh was not to be eaten, this was one of their judicial
Laws; but if a man had eaten the flesh of such an Ox, he was not to die for
it. Thirdly, they say, they had Praecepta media, where the punishment might be
enlarged or diminished, but not unto death, as in theft.

How affirmative and negative Precepts bind.
Affirmative commandments bind not so strictly as Negatiues do, this is a
Negative, ye shall not suffer a Witch to live, but this is an Affirmative,
that the thief shall pay fourefold or five; this Law had sundry exceptions and
mitigations, it might be extended or mitigated, he was bound to pay fourefold,
but yet the Magistrate might have mitigated this, and taken but twofold from
him; and they might have extended it further, as Solomon extends it to
sevenfold, Proverb. 6.31. [Ieshallem Shibhgnathaijm] he shall pay sevenfold:
(...) What the doubling of the duall number among the Hebrews signifies.
the Hebrews double the duall number, ten in the duall number, is twenty;
three is thirty; and four is forty; but when they come to seven, here they
double not. The light of the Moon shall be as the light of the Sun, and the
light of the Sun shall be sevenfold; then he adds for explanation, as the
light of seven days, Esa. 30.26. Here Shibhgnathaijm doubleth not in the duall
number, as in the former numbers, but only stands for seven, he shall pay
Shibhgnathaijm, What the number seven signifies.
that is, seven for one; some interpret it a definite number for an indefinite,
or he shall pay sevenfold, that is, as much as two for four; but it is not the
manner of the Scriptures to take the number under seven, for seven; or he shall
pay sevenfold, that is, much more then he took; and the words following seem
to approve this interpretation, he shall pay all the substance of his house.
And sometimes this punishment was extended to death, as David's sentence was,
that he should die the death, because he took the poor man's only sheep.
Some answer that it was not for his theft that David gave out sentence of
death upon him, but for his oppression and violent theft, as if a man had come
by night, and had broken into a man's house, and had stolen any thing, then he
might have safely killed him by the Law, and he was not to die for it; but if
he had come after the Sun rose, and had stolen any thing, and the owner of
the goods had killed him, then he was to die for it.

But out of David's answer we may observe this, The person against whom the
theft is committed aggravateth the sin.
that the person against whom the sin is committed, aggravateth the sin, as
for a rich man to steal a poor man's sheep; so the time aggravateth the
sin, if the thief came in the night to steal, then the owner of the goods
might safely kill him, because of his violent theft. But it may be asked, what
is violent theft? If a man steal to satisfy his hunger, that is not violent
theft, but if a man steal who may get his living other ways, and live upon
the sweat of other men's brows, or if he steal from one that has small means
to live on, or if he have means to live upon who steals, this is judged
violent theft, Tom. 1.2. Municipall Laws bind only in the Country where they
are made.
and the Magistrate for this may put him to death. Thomas observes well, that
the Magistrate may add to the judicial Law of Moses according to the
necessity of the time, and greatness of the offense; and as the Municipall
Laws of other Countries oblige not men, but in the Country where they are
made, so does not Moses judicial Law; A Magistrate in Israel was bound when a
malefactor was whipped not to give him above forty stripes, this Law binds not
the Magistrate now, sed crescentibus delictis exasperantur paenae, but the
equity of Moses judicial Laws binds all people; this is the equity of
Moses Law, that for violent theft, a man should always die, and the Law judged
that violent theft, which is not for a man's necessity to satisfy his life.



How Christ's words are to be understood in works of charity.
No doubt it were, therefore Christ says, he that has two coats, let him give
his neigbour one, to wit in his necessity, but not he that has one coat, for
then he was not bound to give it.

Prove. 6.30. that the theife should pay sevenfold, and not be put to death,
but the jealous husband will kill the adulterer.

Jews, by their judicial Laws to take seven fold, but it shows not what
may be done by the positive laws of other Countries.

The conclusion of this is; Now under the Gospel theft is a greater sin then
under the Law, A difference betwixt that which is done, and that which should
be done.
and the necessity is greater amongst us generally, then it was amongst them.
And thirdly, that selling of men to make restitution for things taken by theft,
is not in use amongst us, and therefore thieves may be put to death.

CHAPTER XXXIX. Of their proceeding in judgment before they executed the
malefactor.
Ezekiel. 9.10. Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the
forehead of those that sigh etc.
Those that were to be saved, the Lord caused to mark them.
THose who were appointed to be saved amongst the people of God, he used to set
a mark upon them, Exodus 12. When the Egyptians were to be destroyed, the Lord
commanded his people to sprinkle the blood of the Paschall Lamb upon the
lintels of their doors; and from this as Epiphanius marketh, Lib. 1. cont.
haer. 18.
the Egyptians used at the Equinoxe in the Spring, to take vermilion and to
rub over all their trees and houses with it, saying that, at that time of the
year the fire had almost burnt up all Egypt, and therefore they use this as a
sign in remembrance of their deliverance. So the Lord commanded Ezekiel to set
a mark upon those of Jerusalem that mourned, whom he was minded to save. Ezekiel.
9.4.



God did not mark those who were to be destroyed, because of their great
number.
because of the great number that was to be destroyed, in respect of the
handful that was to be saved, for where there was one to be saved, there was a
hundred to be destroyed; there were but seven thousand who bowed not their knee
to Baall, and of the great multitude that came out of Egypt, only two entered
into the land of Canaan. And Revel. 7.4. of all the Tribes of Israel there were
but one hundred and forty four thousand sealed in the forehead. And in
Ieremies time it was very hard to find one that executed judgment in all the
streets of Jerusalem, Ier. 5.1. There were a few good men at that time, as
Jeremy himself, Ebedmelech the Blackmoore, Vriah the Prophet, and the
Rechabites, But the most of the rest were naught, and if Jerusalem had been
searched few had been found in it. And this was a grief to the Prophet Micah,
which made him to complain, that he could not get a cluster to eat, Mica.
7.1. meaning that the good men were perished out of the earth.

The Heathen learned this of the people of God, to mark those who were to be
saved with the letter (...), and these that were condemned with the letter th
theta. The heathen marked the condemned with theta, and them that were absolved
in judgment with tau. Ascon. pad:
It was the custom of the ancient warriors, when they returned from battle,
he who kept the register of their names, marked the names of those who returned
safe with the letter tau, and the names of those who were wanting with the
letter theta, the Latins learned this from the Grecians, the Grecians from the
Egyptians, and the Egyptians from the people of God. Persius Si potis es vitio
nigrum praefigere theta.

The Jews put not two to death in one day, but for the same crime.
They put not two to death in one day, except they were guilty of one crime,
and they give this example; If a man had lien with the Priests daughter, he and
she were not put to death both in one day, because she was guilty of a greater
sin then he, therefore she was to be burnt quick, but he was not to be put
to death that day, neither was he burnt quick as she was.



(...) seditiosi Mark. 15.7. a (...) seditio factio.
Christ and the two thieves were condemned for one fault because they were
(...), troublers of the peace of the Kingdom; and therefore the theife said,
thou art (...) in the same condemnation, Luke 23.40. Barrabas was a murderer
and so should have dyed by the sword, (...) Effractores.
but because he made insurrection and troubled the common peace, therefore he
was to be crucified. And the Hebrews call these [perizim] effractores, and the
Rabbis called them listin, from the Greek word (...), they took arms to
trouble the peace of the Commonwealth, and they used to crucify all these who
troubled the Kingdom and made insurrection.

CHAPTER XL. Of their Capital punishments.
JOSH. 7.25. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire
after they had stoned them with stones.
THere were sundry sorts of punishments inflicted upon malefactors by the house
of judgment among the Jews. Some of them were burnt, some of them were
strangled, some of them were stoned, and some of them were beheaded, and some
of them were drowned.

He that lay with his mother, or daughter in law the wife of his son, or with
a maid that was betrothed, Who were stoned.
Deuteronomy. 22.24. Or if a woman bowed down to a beast, Levit. 20.16. so the
blasphemer, Levit. 24.14. and Idolater, Deuteronomy. 17.5. So he who offered his seed
to Molech, Levit. 20.2. He that had the spirit of divination or was a wizard,
Levit. 20.27. He that profaned the Sabbath, he that cursed his father or his
mother, Levit. 20.9. so the disobedient son was stoned to death. Deuteronomy. 21.21.
He that persuaded or enticed others to Idolatry, Deuteronomy. 13.1. all these were
stoned to death.

First the Priests daughter if she committed adultery. Secondly he who lay
with his own daughter. Who were burn.
Thirdly he who lay with his sons wife. Fourthly he who lay with his
daughters daughter, or with the daughter of his wives daughter. Fifthly he who
lay with his mother in law, or with the mother of his mother in law, or he who
lay with the mother of his father in law, his wife being yet alive; even all
these were burnt. Josh. 7 15. He that is taken with a cursed thing shall be
burnt with fire, and verse. 25. all Israel stoned him with stones, first he was
stoned, and then burnt.

Who were beheaded.
Those who killed were beheaded, and those who fell away to Idolatry.

Who were strangled.
The fourth sort of punishment was strangling; which was the lightest sort of
punishment capital among the Jews. First he who did strike his father or his
mother. Secondly he who stole a man in Israel. Deuteronomy. 24.7. Thirdly any old man
who hearkened not to the voice of the Synedrion. Fourthly a false Prophet; and
he who lay with another man's wife. Fifthly, he who defiled the Priests daughter;
all these were strangled. And the Jews say, wheresoever this punishment is set
down, let his blood be upon his own head, it is to be understood of stoning;
but where the phrase is found, let him die the death, and the punishment not
set down in particular, then it is to be understood of strangling. But this
holds not, it is said Exodus 21.12. he that smites a man that he die shall
surely be put to death: so it is said, that the adulterer shall die the death,
yet he was not strangled but stoned. Ezekiel. 16.40. Ioh. 8.45.

(...) crucifigere (...) Crux. (...) Arbor. (...).
This strangling the Romans changed into crucifying, which was called [Zacaph]
crucifigere, and the cross was called [Zeceph] crux, and [gnetz] arbor, and
the Greeks called it (...) lignum geminum.

Lastly drowning, Mat. 18.6. It were better that a millstone were hanged about
his neck, (...) dimersio in pelagus, submersio.
and that he were drowned in the midst of the Sea; and the Greeks had (...),
they were put in a chest of lead, and sunk in the Sea, as Casaubon shows out
of Athenaeus.

(...) Excisio.
What sort of punishment is meant Genesis 17.14. he that is not circumcised, that
soul shall be cut off from his people?

Hebrews expound this sort of punishment diversely. Kimchi says, he shall be
punished by the Lord, but he adds, that he is much mistaken who thinks that
the child not being circumcised is secluded from the life to come. Moses
Cotzensis thinks, that these who were not circumcised the eight day, should
dye without children, alluding to that place Levit. 20.20. But all of them
agree in this that the punishment is inflicted by the Lord.

Exodus 31.14. Whosoever does any work on the Sabbath day he shall be cut off
from his people, and be surely put to death, by cutting off here is meant,
cutting off by the Magistrate, why should it not then be so understood in that
place Genesis 17.14. so Levit. 20.6. If any go after wizards, I will set my face
against him, and cut him off; by cutting off here is meant, to be cut off by
the Magistrate, why is it not so then to be understood in that place of Genesis
before mentioned?

Maymone answers to these places, Levit. 17.10. and 21.6. Difference betwixt
these two phrases, I shall cut off etc. and thou shall cut off etc.
I shall cut off that soul, and thou shall cut off that soul; Exodus 22.18.
thou shall not suffer a witch to live, but when he says, I will set my self
against that soul which eats blood, and will cut him off from my people,
then it is meant, that by his own hand immediately he will cut him off.

But what sort of cutting off by the hand of God is meant here?

It is not meant of any bodily punishment inflicted upon their bodies, or upon
their posterity, as the Jews interpret it, but of excommunication and
secluding them from the Church. So Calvin, Iunius, Deodati expound it.

CHAPTER XLII. Why they gave wine to those who were going to be executed.
PROVE. 31.6. Give wine unto those that be of an heavy heart.
THey used to do three things to them who were condemned. First, they gave
them wine to drink to comfort them. Amos 2.8. They drunk the wine of the
condemned in the house of their God; that is, they drank the most excellent
wine, for such wine they gave to the condemned. Secondly, they used to apply
(...), soft wool, which the Chirurgians apply to wounds to mitigate their
pain, because their death was a lingering death. Thirdly, they used to hold
odoriferous canes or reeds to their nose to refresh their brains.

But see what miserable comforters the Jews were to Christ, Luke says (...),
they derided him, Luke 23.35. for in stead of wine, they gave him vinegar and
gall to drink, which was a most bitter sort of drink; and the Lord says Ier.
9.15. I will feed this people even with wormwood, and give them water of gall
to drink. And for (...) they gave him (...), hysope tied about a read and
dipped in vinegar, and they gave it him not to quench his thirst, but to smell
it in derision.

They gave him wine to drink mingled with myrrh, but he received it not,
Mark. 15.23. Christ would not drink this cup mingled with myrrh (for it
intoxicated the brain) that he might be sensible of the pain which he was to
suffer for us. It is a great judgment to be beaten and not to feel it, Prove.
23.35. The Lord who went willingly to death, did willingly drink the cup of
Gods wrath for us; and therefore he was unwilling to drink this cup, which
would have made him senseless of the pain.

They gave him hyssope in stead of wool which should have mitigated his pain,
the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. Prove. 12.10.

Christ suffered in all his senses, in his taste, they gave him veneger mixed
with gall; in his feeling, whereas they should have applied soft wool, and
bound up his wounds, and mitigated his pain, they applied but hysope so in his
hearing, he heard their bitter mockes and scoffing. And as he felt the grievous
pain of the cross in all his senses, so the wicked shall suffer the pains
and torments of hell in all their senses.

The conclusion of this is, sin is sweet in the beginning, but bitter in the
end; Adam did eat asweet fruit, the lips of a strange woman drop as an honey
comb, and her mouth is smoother then oil, but her end is bitter as wormwood,
sharp as a two-edged sword, Pro. 5.3.

They give him hysope; hysope was the last purgation and sprinkling when the
leper was brought into the Camp again: and David alludeth to this, Psalm. 51.
wash me with hysope. So Christ's death must purge us from all our sins, and
bring us into the society of the Saints of God, that there we may dwell for
ever.

CHAPTER XLIII. Of their VVarres.
DEVT. 20.10. When thou come near to a City to fight against it, then
proclaim peace unto it, etc.
FIrst let us consider in their wars, the time when they went to battle;
secondly, the manner how they pitched about the Tabernacle; thirdly, the manner
how they marched when the Camp removed; fourthly, the Proclamation made to them
at their removing; fifthly, the conditions of peace offered to the enemy;
sixthly, what they did before they joined battle; and lastly, the song which
they had after the victory.

The time that they entered to be Soldiers.
First, what time they entered to be Soldiers? the Levites entered to their
Ministry when they were thirty years, Number. 4.42. But the Soldiers entered
when they were twenty years, and they left off when they were fifty; none
went to the wars but they who paid the half shekell; the Levites were
exempted, because they served the Lord in the Tabernacle, they neither paid
this half shekell, nor yet went to the wars. Women likewise were exempted,
She that tarrieth at home, divides the spoil, Psalm. 63.12. So were the weak,
sick, and infirm, the young, and the old under twenty and above fifty; so
the captives, and Idolaters, all these were exempted, none of them paid the
half shekell, or went to the wars.

Secondly, when they pitched about the Tabernacle, they pitched their Tents
with their faces toward it, Number. 2.2. because of the respect that they carried
to it. They pitched round about the Tabernacle when they rested in their Tents;
and David alludeth to this, Psalm. 76.11. Let all that be about him, bring
presents unto him that ought to be feared; there were three Tribes upon every
quarter; Judah, Issachar, and Zabulon upon the East; Ruben, Simeon, and Gad upon
the South; Ephraim, Manasse, and Benjamin upon the West; Dan, Asher, and
Nephthali upon the North, Number. 23.10. Who can number the fourth part of Israel?
Here is an allusion to the Camp as it was divided in four quarters.

There were three Tribes on every quarter, and a space betwixt them and the
Tabernacle, and Moses and Aaron and the Priests upon the East; the Coathites
upon the South; the Gersonites upon the West; and the Merarites upon the North;
these lay betwixt the Tribes and the Tabernacle to watch the holy place; So
betwixt Gods throne and the four and twenty Elders compassing it, were four
living creatures full of eyes, Rev. 6.10.

In the first place Judah pitched and removed first, The privileges of Judah.
Judah got the first place, of him the Kings were to come, he marched first, he
sacrificed first, Numb. 7.12. Judah gave a Lion in his Colors. Themistocles
said, it was better to have a Lion to be a Captain to a company of Hearts,
(...) Catulus leonis. (...) Leo juvenis. (...) Leo cordatus.
than to have a company of Lions and a Heart to be their Captain: The Lion is
first [Gur] Catulus Leonis, then he is [Cephir] cum incipit praedari, when he
begins to catch the prey, and then he is [Labhi] when he grows old. First,
When Judah was the Lions whelpe, the Lion, and the fierce Lion.
Judah was the Lions whelpe in Ioshuah's time, Josh. 1. when they went out
first to Conquer the Land; then he was Cephir in David's time; and thirdly, he
was [Labhi] Cordatus Leo in Salomons time.

And in placing of these Tribes, ye shall observe that always with the feebler
Tribes there is a warre-like and a courageous Tribe placed, as with Issachar
and Zabulon two feeble Tribes, A warrelike Tribe placed with the more feeble.
Judah is placed; Issachar was dull like the Ass, and loved to coutch between
two burdens, Genesis 49.14. So Judge. 15.16. Why abodest thou amongst the
sheep-folds, (...) Sibilare.
to hear the bleating of the flookes (or delighting to whistle by the flocks)
having no mind to help thy brethren in the wars. Zabulon had no skill in
the wars, he dwelt by the Seaside, and gave himself only to shipping,
therefore Judah was joined to help these two weak Tribes; so in that vision,
Esa. 21.7. The Ass and the Camel are joined together; the Camel signifying
the Medes, the more generous people, and the Ass the Persians, the more dull
people.

In the second company was Ruben, Simeon, and Gad; Ruben unstable as water,
Genesis 49.4. So Simeon a weak Tribe divided in Jacob and scattered in Israel,
Genesis 49.7. now to help these they had the warre-like Tribe of Gad joined with
them, (...) Elegans paranomasia.
Genesis 49.19. Gad jedud jegudennu vehu jagud gnakabh, Gad a troop shall
overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last: the men of Gad, were mighty
men of war, and had faces like Lions, 1 Chronicles. 12.8.

In the third company were Ephraim, Manasse, and Benjamin, and Ephraim the
most warrelike of the three, Ephraim had skill to handle the Bow, Psalm. 78.9.
but Benjamin was [Ittor jad] he could sling with both the hands. (...)
Ambidexter.
1 Chronicles. 12.2.

In the fourth company were Dan, Asser, and Nephthali; and of these three, Dan
was the most valiant: Zabulon and Nephthali were a people that jeoparded their
lives unto the death, Judge. 5.18. but Dan was their Captain, he came in to
save the tail of the host, and he was called the gathering host; and the
Lord alludeth to this form, Esa. 51.11. I will go before you and gather you
in: they left none of the weak behind them, Number. 12.15. and Miriam was shut
out of the Camp seven days for Leprosy, and the people journeyed not, till
Miriam was brought in again: David alludeth to this, Psalm. 27.10. Though my
father and my mother should forsake me, yet thou will gather me up: Amalek cut
off the tail of the Host, Deuteronomy. 25.17. these are called the hindmost of the
Host, Josh. 10.19.

Every one of these quarters had their Captain, Every one of the Quarters had
their Captain
and he was the wisest and most courageous, for strength and counsel are for
the wars, Prove. 10.5. 2 Samuel 23.8. the Tachmonite, for his wisdom is
[Ioshebeang] he sat in the Council, and for his valor and courage he is
called Hadino the Eznite, that is, who delighted to lift up the spear; young
and rash youths are not fit to be Captains, such as was Alexander the Great,
Quando animali additur genitivus famininus pluralis, tunc significatur animal
illud tenerumesse, Genesis 38.7.
who ran violently rather through the world, than by skill or wisdom,
therefore Dan. 8.21. he is called Hircus caprarum, that is, a young Goat.

There were four memorable things to be observed in this Camp; first, their
order; secondly, their cleanliness, thirdly, Salus castrametantium; and
lastly, how the Lord provided meat and cloth for them.

First, the order that was in this Camp; The order of this Camp.
this was Acies been ordinata, and God who is the God of order and not of
confusion set them in this order. Balaam saw this when he said, Number. 24.5. How
goodly are thy Tents, O Jacob, and thy Tabernacles O Israel. As the valleys are
they spread forth, as Gardens by the River side, as the trees of Lign-aloes,
which the Lord has planted, and as Cedar trees beside the waters.

Secondly, Mundities, the cleanenesse and neatness of this Camp, for the Lord
commanded them when they were to ease nature to go without the Camp, and to
take a padle with them, and dig in the ground to cover their excrements. Deuteronomy.
23.12.

Thirdly, Salus castrametantium, there was none feeble in their Tribes, Psalm.
105.37. and pes tuus non fuit fermentatus, thy foot did not swell these forty
years, Deuteronomy. 8.4.

The Lord provided meat and cloths for this Camp.
Fourthly, the Lord provided well for this Camp, both meat and cloths; meat, He
rained down Manna from the heavens, and fed them with the bread of Angels, and
for their clothes they waxed not old, Deuteronomy. 8.4. And it is most probable that
their clothes did grow with them as they grew, (...) muinveterarunt.
and their shoes waxed not old upon their feet, Deuteronomy. 29.5. Their shoes did
grow with their feet, and it seems that the childrens clothes were made of
the clothes of them who died.

The four Captains pitched their Tents at the four corners of the Camp,
Judah pitched in the Northeast corner; Ruben in the Southeast; Ephraim on the
Southwest; and Dan on the Northwest corner. Number. 2.2. Every man of the children
of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the Ensign of their fathers
house, far off about the Tabernacle of the Congregation shall they pitch.

When they arose to march they spread their Colors, and they said, (...)
Vexillis utamur in nomine Dei nostri.
Vexillabimus in nomine Dei nostri, in the name of our God we will set up our
Banners, Psalm. 20.5.

They had their Colors, their Ensigns, and their Motto's.

Their Colors were answerable to the stones in Aarons brestplate.
First, their Colors; their Colors were according to the Colors of the stones
in the breastplate of Aaron: Judah gave a green Color like the Smarag: Ruben
a red Color like the Sardius; Ephraim a golden Color like the Chrysolite; Dan
gave party colored of white and red like the Jasper.

In their Ensigns they had the Emblems of Beasts.
Their Ensigns were; first, Judah gave a Lion; Ruben the head of a man, because
he was the first borne, and the head of the family; Ephraim gave the head of
an Ox, because he was the son of Joseph, who was called Bos Dei, Deuteronomy.
33.17. His glory is like the firstling of his Bullock; and Dan gave an Eagle
in his Colors, because the Eagle is an enemy to Serpents, the Serpent should
not be put in his Colors but the Eagle, an enemy to the Serpent; Dan shall
judge his people, Genesis 49.16. Dan is a Lions whelpe, he shall leap from
Bashan. Here he is commended both for his wisdom and his strength, the
Serpent does not express these two well, but the Eagle does express them very
fitly.

Their Motto's in their Ensigns were out of the Testament of Iac^b, or of the
song of Moses.
Thirdly, their Motto, Iuda's Motto was this; Judah is a Lions whelpe, Genesis 49.8.
Ruben had this, Unstable like water, Genesis 49.4. Ephraims Motto was, his glory
is like the firstling of his Bullock, Deuteronomy. 33.16. Dan had this Motto, he
shall be a Serpent by the way, an Adder in the path, and so every one of the
Tribes had their Motto.

The Lord was their General.
The Lord as their General dwelt in the midst of their Camp, and his Ensigns
were the Cloud and the pillar of fire; the Cloud to direct them by day, and the
pillar by night, then he was the guide of their youth, Iere. 3.4. The motto
which they gave him was this, (...)
Mi camocha baelohim Iehova, quis sicut tu Iehova inter Deos; and hence they
made the name of the Macchabees, Mem, Caph, Beth, Iod: and they were called
Machei at the first, and afterward Macchabaei: and like unto this was that
abbreviation, Agla, attagnebher legnolam adonai, Tufortis in aeternum Domine.

When they marched, Their marching was different from their pitching about the
Tabernacle.
they kept not the same order as when they pitched about the Tabernacle, for
when they marched, Judah, Issachar, and Zabulon went before; and the Gersonites
and the Merarites next them set forward, bearing the Tabernacle, Number. 10.17. In
the second place came Ruben, Simeon, and Gad, who lay upon the South; and next
them came the Cohathites with the Arc, Number. 10.21. After them Ephraim,
Benjamin, and Manasse; and David alludeth to this, Psalm. 80.2. Before Ephraim
and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy strength, and come and save us; he
says, before Ephraim, for when they carried the Arc Ephraim came behind the
Arc, and the Arc was before him, and when they rested, Ephraim was upon the
West side of the Arc, which Number. 2.18. is called [jammah] the Sea-ward, (...)
because the Sea lay toward the West, so that the Arc both when they pitched
and when they marched was ever before Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. In the
last place came Dan, Asser, and Nephthali; Dan was in the Reareward of all
their Camps throughout their Hosts, Number. 10.25.

When they marched Ascendebant Chamusshim, The manner of their Marching. (...)
Exodus 13.18. Aquila and Symmachus, (...), qui quintam costam habebant cinctam,
because they carried their sword at the fifth rib, but Theodosion translateth it
(...), they went five in ranks, when they marched they were said to be
Accincti, Genesis 49.19. Number. 32.17. 1 King. 10.11. And Solomon alludeth to this
Prove. 30. 31. speaking of the horse girt in his loins, a warlike beast, fit
for the battle, and contrary to this is discinctus when they lay aside their
armor.

In their marching they made a Proclamation for four sorts of people.
Thirdly, they made a Proclamation in the Camp, that he who had built a new
house, and had not dedicated it, should go back: Secondly, if he had planted
a Vineyard, and had not made it common, he should go back: thirdly, if he had
betrothed a wife, and had not lien with her, he should go back: and fourthly,
they cried that all those who were fearful and faint hearted should return.

What new house was meant in this Proclamation.
He who built a new house, and had not dedicated it, he should go back, which
they expounded thus, if he had built a new house, either for his dwelling, or
for his Cattle, or his Corn, then he was to go back to it, but if he had
built a new house for pleasure, and let it and taken hyre for it, then he was
not to go back.

Secondly, if he had planted a Vineyard and had not made it common, then he was
to go back; where there is an Allusion to that form set down in the Law,
that the first three years after that a man had planted a Vineyard, he might
not eat of the fruits thereof, then the fourth year they were the Lords, and
in the fifth year they were made common, and then turned to the planters own
use, and it was all one whether he planted the Vineyard, bought the Vineyard,
or had gotten it by inheritance or by gift.

Thirdly, if he had betrothed a wife, and had not lien with her, whether she
had been a maid or a widow, he was to return home: and this Immunitie from
the wars lasted for a whole year to those who were new married; but they
say, if the high Priest had married a widow he was not exempted, so if an
inferior Priest had married a repudiate woman, or a common Israelite if he had
married a bastard, then he was not exempted.

Fourthly, all those who were fearful and faint-hearted, Qui mollis est cord,
Hebraice, he should return, lest he make his brethrens heart faint also, Deuteronomy.
20. So all those who were guilty of any crime were sent away, All that were
known for notorious sinners, were discharged from the wars.
for sin always makes a trembling and a faint heart, but the misery is now
that the most lewd take themselves to this calling, Psalm. 68.30. Rebuke the
company of the spearemen, Hebraice, rebuke the beasts of the reeds; the Lord
accounts those profane Soldiers for all their spears but like beasts
amongst the reeds, there are few like unto the Centurion, or Cornelius, who
have good Soldiers.

Gideon made a Proclamation, Judge. 6. Gideons Proclamation.
Whosoever is fearful, let him return, and so there remained but ten
thousand; and he tried his Soldiers again, and all that bowed down to drink
he sent them away, and he took with him only those who lapped like dogs,
which were but three hundred.

Whether made he choice of these as the most cowardly, or the most courageous?

It is commonly holden that they were the most courageous who lapped like
dogs, Israel to brag here, and to say, Mine own hand has saved me, Judge.
7.2. The Lord would only have the whole praise of the Victory. Now whether
made it more for the praise of God, when he overcame with a few cowards, than
if he had overcome with a number of valiant Soldiers: were not they most
cowardly, who durst not lie down to take leisure to drink? But ran and lapped
as the dogs do about Nilus; the Lord made choice of the most fearful and
cowardly for his glory; But Marcus Crassus amongst the Romans, caused to let
blood of the cowards, and he gives this to be the reason, that that blood which
they would not shed in defense of their Country, should now be shed to their
disgrace and shame.

There are two sorts of wars.
They had two sorts of wars; the first were bella spontanea, and the second
was bella praecepti, new married men and those who planted a vineyard were
exempted from the first war, but not from the second war which was against
the Canaanits, the Bridegroom was not exempted from this neither.

Fourthly, before they joined battle with the enemy to destroy them or to sack
their City, they offered conditions of peace to the enemies that were not to
be destroyed, if they sought peace of them; we have one example, in the
Cherethites, that were David's guard; they were called Curetae by Virgil,
Curetum allabimur oras: So they were called Cretenses, these came of the
Phenicians or Philistines; Creta was a Colonie belonging to them, see Act.
27.12. Phenice which is a haven of Creet. Deuteronomy. 20.10. And the conditions were
three especially. First, that they should receive the seven precepts of Noah:
Secondly, that they should be tributaries to them; And thirdly, that they
should be servants to them.

Moabites and Ammonites were still excepted Deuteronomy. 3.3. but Deuteronomy. 2.9. distress
not the Moabites neither contend with them in battle, how then shall we
reconcile these two places, when he bids them not to seek the peace of the
Ammonite.

Moabite or Ammonite, but if they seek it of thee, then thou shall not
distress them, nor contend with them in battle.

(...) Let him fly that will fl^e.
If they would not receive the peace offered, then they cried, dedat se qui
vult, fugiat qui vult, pugnet qui vult.

Before they joined battle they comforted the Soldiers after this manner,
(...) he that will have peace, let him have peace. (...) He that will make
war let him make war. Lam. 5.9 in anima nostra ferimus panem, id est, in
periculo animae. so Psalm. 119. anima mea in manu mea.
trust in him who is the Savior of Israel in affliction, Ier. 14.8. this day
thou fightest, pro confessione vnitatis divinae, quod deus unus est, that thy
God is one, therefore, thou may carry thy life i^ thy hand securely, Job.
13.4. and think neither upon thy wife nor thy children, but put the care of
them out of thy heart. And the Apostle alludeth to this, 2 Timothy 2.4. that he
who goes to the wars, entangleth not himself with the cares of this world.
And they exhorted them to cast the care of their houses, wives, children, and
family upon the Lord, who will provide for them: 1 Samuel 25.28.29. The Lord
will provide a sure house for my Lord the King, because he fights the battles
of the Lord, and his soul shall be bound up in the bundle of life.

When they marched nearer their enemy, What they did when they were at the
shocke of the battle.
they raised the dust with their feet which was the nearest sign of war:
and Christ alludeth to this form Mat. 10. When you come into a house offer
your peace, and if they refuse it, shake off the dust of your feet, and let
your peace return to your self: when the enemies were overcome, they fell
down at the Conquerours feet, and seemed to lick the dust under his feet,
Psalm. 18.

And so they used to cast a firebrand within the enemies land, and the Prophet
Obadiah alludeth to this, verse. 18. there shall not one be left alive in the
house of Esau, the Seventie translate it (...), that shall carry a firebrand.
Such were those faeciales amongst the Romans, who threw a spear into the
enemies land in defiance of the enemy.

After the victory they divided the spoil, and then they sung (...), or carmen
triumphale.

It was their manner after the victory to sing a song of praise, as Moses and
Miriam did, Exodus 15. When the song of triumph was sung.
so Barak and Deborah, Judge. 5. so David after he had conquered all his enemies
sang the eighteenth Psalm, so Revelation 19. when all the enemies of the
Church shall be subdued, they shall sing a song of praise to the Lamb who
sits upon the throne.

The women did sing the song of victory. (...)
The women especially did sing this song, and therefore Psalm. 68.11. it is said,
great were the company, [hammebhassheroth,] of those that published it, in the
faeminine gender, of the women that published it.

In this song of victory the King is commended, that he ascended on high, and
led captivity captive, and received gifts or ransomes from the captives, Verse.
18. And the Apostle applies this to Christ's victory over all his enemies, he
ascended on high, and gave gifts to men, Ephe. 4.8. And in this song of
victory, they sung this Carmen amabaeum, a song by intercourse, I will bring
again from Basan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the Sea,
Verse. 22. They remembered these two deliverances in all their songs of
thankesgiving for deliverance: first, how the Lord delivered them out of the
red Sea; and secondly, that deliverance from Og King of Bashan when he came
against them.

The subject of Deborahs song.
That song of Deborah, Judge. 5. first, contains a praise to God, who gave the
victory. Secondly, it makes mention of the instruments which he used in this
victory, as the stars. Thirdly, it condemns those who would not come, as
Merosh: and fourthly, it commends those who came willingly. And lastly, a
prayer against the enemies of the Church, Verse. 28.

CHAPTER XLIIII. Of their Burials.
GENESIS 49.29 And he charged them and said unto them, I am to be gathered to my
people, bury me with my Fathers.
IN their burials, first, The circumstances that were used in Burial.
we are to consider the place where they buried them; secondly, the ceremonies
which they used at their Burials; thirdly, the form of their Tombs; fourthly,
the great charges that they were at in their burials; and lastly, how they
comforted the living after the dead were buried.

First, the place where they buried them, The place where they used to bury.
it was commonly without the City; In Jerusalem they were buried without the
City near the brook Kedron, Mat. 27.53. And many arose, and came out of the
graves, and went into the holy City, and appeared there: so the widows son
of Naim was buried without the City, Luke 7.12. so the possessed men walked
amongst the graves in solitary places, Mark. 4.37. And Christ was buried in a
Garden without the City.

They buried all of one family together, 1 Samuel 3.1. With whom they were
buried.
they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan in the burial of their Fathers: so
Genesis 33.2. therefore they were said to be gathered to their fathers; and David
alludeth to this form when he says, gather me not with the wicked. Psalm. 30.
For all the bodies of the faithful were laid together, so are their souls
gathered together, and this is called, the bundle of life, 1 Samuel 25. The
Greeks called those who were not buried with their Fathers, (...), outburied.

They buried the man and the wife together, as Abraham and Sara in the field of
Ephron, The faithful were buried together.
Gen 25. so Jacob and Leah, Isaac and Rebecca, so Tobias and his wife were
buried together, Tob. 4.4. And hereby they signified the constancy and love
which should be betwixt the man and the wife, and that they died in the same
faith, therefore the Orthodoxe Church when they died they would not be buried
besides Heretics; Sophronius said, Noli me tangere haeretice neque vivum
neque mortuum.

The strangers converted, desired to be buried with the faithful.
They buried strangers in a part by themselves, Act. 1.18. this place they
called it Kebher galaja, sepulchrum exterorum: when the strangers were
converted to the faith, they desired to be buried with the faithful; as Ruth
said to Naomi, where thou die there will I die and be buried, Ruth 1.17.

The Ceremonies in burial.
Secondly, they used many Ceremonies in their burial, first, they fasted, 1 Samuel 31.13. 2 Samuel 1.12. and they mourned and wept and fasted while even; so 2 Samuel 3.34. David fasted for Abner till the Sun was set.

Secondly, they wept, as for Aaron thirty days, Number. 20.29. so for Moses,
Deuteronomy. 34.8. so for Saul and Jonathan, 2 Samuel 1.12. so for Iosia did all Israel
mourn, 2 Chronicles. 35.24. Families lamented, the men by themselves and the women
by themselves, Zach. 12.12. so Luke 23. and the women followed after weeping.
They mourned and lamented chiefly for their Kings, Iere. 34.5. and they will
lament thee, saying ah Lord; they lamented for their King as the widow does for
her husband, for the King is the husband of the Commonwealth, and when she
wants him she is a widow, Lament. 1.

How these words are to be understood, he taught them the use of the Bow.
Such was the lamentation which David made for Saul and Jonathan, 2 Samuel 1.18.
it is called there the lamentation of the Bow, he commanded to teach the
children of Israel the Bow, it is commonly translated, he taught them the use
of the bow, or to shoot with the bow, but this is impertinently cast in, in the
midst of David's lamentations, that he taught them the use of the bow, but it
should be this way translated, he taught them this lamentation, entitled the
Bow, for it was the manner in old times to give sundry titles to these
lamentations, as, Fistula, Scutum, Ovum, Ala, Securis; so Psalm. 45. Eustatius
lib. 4.
to the chief Musician upon Shonannim, as ye would say upon the lillies, the
song of the marriage is entitled the lilly. Christ is, the lilly of the
valleys, and his Church is as the lilly among thorns, therefore this
marriage- Psalm is entitled the lilly; so the title of this lamentation was
Arcus, the Seventie translated it well David edidit threnum hunc, and it is
subjoyned that he made this lamentation, that he might teach it the children of
Israel; and Josephus adds, that the Jews did diligently learn these
Lamentations even unto his time, the rest of this Lamentation is set down in
the Book of the just, verse. 18. and to translate it he taught them to shoot
with the bow, were not pertinent, for they had skill in the use of the bow
already, 1 Par. 12. and it was not for unskillfulness in the use of the Bow
that the Philistims overcame them. When Josias was killed in the battle,
Jeremy made his Lamentations or (...) for him. Alexander ab Alexandre lib. 3.
Genialium.
When they buried their dead they had Minstrels, Mat. 9.23. who sang the
praises of the dead, this the Greeks called (...), and when the corpse were to
be carried out, they cried Conclamatum est; and they hired Praeficas, mourning
women. Iere. 9.17. and when these women did sing the doleful song, she that
was the chief mourner sung over carmen (...) at every rest; the like we see
in Psalm. 136. for his mercy endures for ever: so Iere. 9.18. the chief
mourner repeated these words in the Lamentation, that our eyes may run down
with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters: so Ezekiel. 26.7. how art thou
destroyed that wast inhabited of Seafaring men.

They lamented not for their wicked Kings when they died; Herod fearing that he
should not have this honor done to him when he died, commanded when he was
about to give up the Ghost, that a number of his wisest Counselors should be
gathered together, Josephus: The stratageme that Herod used that men might
lament for his death.
and that his Guard should inviron him about, and put them all to the sword,
that there might be a lamentatio^ at his death, which they were purposed to
have done, unless that Salome the sister of Herod had prevented it, and
discovered to them the plot, and then they kept a feast of joy in remembrance
of that deliverance, as they did at Hamans death.

Thirdly, they used to wash the bodies of the dead, this was called (...), and
so they washed the body of Dorcas and laid it in an upper chamber, (...) (...).
(...) (...)

there was also (...), Ecclus 31.25 that is, a washing of themselves for
touching of the dead; and the third was (...), baptized for the dead, that is,
counted as dead men, 1 Cor. 15.29. for when they were baptized they went down
into the water, and were baptized all over the body.

They embalmed the dead.
They embalmed the bodies (...) and (...) differ. (...) is to prepare all those
things which serve for the embalming of the body, and this was called a burying
among the Jews, they used much this emb^lming of the bodies before they buried
them, but now because the doctrine of the Resurrection is so clear, this
ceremony of embalming should not be used.

They burned sweet Odours for them.
When they embalmed the bodies of their Kings, they burnt sweet odours for them,
as for Asa and for Zedekiah, Iere. 34.5. Thou shall die in peace, and with the
burnings of thy fathers the former Kings, so shall they burn Odours for thee;
Although Zedekiahs eyes were pulled out of his head, and carried captive to
Babylon: yet he is said to die in peace, because he had all these solemnities
performed to him in his funerals. Those of Iabesh Gilead took the bodies of
Saul and his sons and burnt them, and buried their bones under a tree, 1 Samuel
31.13. To burn their bodies here is not meant, that they burnt them to ashes,
and then buried their bones, but they burnt odours upon their bodies until
they were buried; for these speeches are all one, comburent te, How these
phrases are to be understood, Comburent te and comburent tibi.
as the Latins say, comburent tibi, as the Hebrews say, (...), as the Greeks
say, et aromatizare, as the Evangelists say, for every one of these phrases
signify the great pomp which was used at their burials. And where it is said,
they buried their bones, it is to be understood by the figure Synecdoche, their
bodies, 2 Samuel 1. Are we not all of his bone: so Genesis 2. She is flesh of my
flesh, and bone of my bone, and this last part here is but an explanation of
the first. Iechonias wanted this honorable burial, and therefore is said, to
be buried with the burial of an Ass, Iere. 22. which was, insepulta sepultura.

The heathen burnt the bodies to ashes before they buried them, because that
they thought, The Heathen burned them to ashes.
that the fire purged the body, but the greatest abuse of all in burning of
the dead, was when the King of Moab took the King of Ammons son, and burnt
him to Lyme, and then, (as the Jews say) with that incrustarunt muros, they
plaisterd their walls.

By this we may understand why the Scripture brings in Og the King of Bashans
bed, saying, is it not in Rabbath of Ammon unto this day? Deuteronomy. 3.11. this was
not his sleeping bed, but his funeral bed, for when they were dead, they laid
them upon a rich bed, and burnt odours over them, until their friends carried
them to the grave, and then they came home and burnt the bed and things
belonging unto it. Now the reason why this bed of Og burnt not, was because it
was made of iron, so say Rabbi Isaac Abrabaneel, and Arrias Montanus.

Of the feasts at their Burials.
They had funeral feasts called (...), therefore Ezekiel. 24.17. when his wife
died he was forbidden to eat of that bread, eat not the bread of men; Enoshim,
that is, the bread of mourning men; these feasts they called afterward,
feralia and silicernia, and they used to set the meat upon the graves of the
dead, Job. 4.17. pour out thy bread upon the burial of the just: so Eccles.
30.18 as messes of meat set upon the grave.

The third thing to be considered in their burials, is the form of their
Tombs, the Kings were buried in stately Tombs together in the City of David,
and those Kings who were not buried there, were thought to be basely buried, if
they were not buried in the burial of David, or in the burial of the Kings in
Mount Sion.

Their burials were hewed out of a rock.
The nobler sort some of them had Caves hewed out of a rock, which had several
burials within them, and Christ was buried in such a burial, Esa. 53.9. He
made his grave with the wicked, (...) Excelsa eius.
and with the rich, [Bamathau] in excelsis, that is, although he was crucified
with the wicked, yet he was buried in the Tomb of Joseph, not in a base
burial but an honorable burial, which was Joseph's own burial, who was an
honorable man.

The Prophets were also buried in stately burials.
The Prophets were usually buried in stately Tombs, Iere. 26.23. And Iehojakim
sent for Vrias the Prophet out of Egypt, and caused to slay him with the sword,
and cast his dead body in the graves of the common people: the Prophets were
not usually buried in the burials of the common people; so Mat. 23.29. Woe be
to you, because ye build the Tombs of the Prophets, and garnish the
sepulchers of the righteous.

For the common people they were but laid in the ground, without any Tomb,
Luke 11.4. Ye are like graves which appear not, and the men that walk over
them are not aware of them.

They had some marks of distinction to discern the Tombs of the better sort;
example we have of this in Joshua 24.30. it is said there, that they buried him
in Timnath-herah, but Judge. 2.9. they buried him in Timnath-heres; Here Is is
called the City of the Sun, (...) Sol.
and they changed the name of the Town, because Joshua was buried there, whose
sepulcher had the picture of the Sun drawn upon it, as the Jews write, and
the sepulcher of Elisha was known by it self in the fields, 2 King. 13.21.

Fourthly, they were at great charges in burying of their dead, it was so great
that many times their friends refused to bury them, therefore Gamaliel who was
a man of power and credit amongst them, restrained this. Nicodemus sent for an
hundredth pound weight of Myrrh and Aloes, to embalme Christ, Ioh. 19.39. and
Christ allows the fact of Marie, Mat. 26.10. when she poured the box of
precious ointment upon his head, Why trouble ye the woman, for she has wrought
a good work upon me: and Gamaliel ordained that none should be wrapped in
silk, but all in linen, and no gold put upon them. Cicero lib. 2. de ll.
So amongst the Romans they were glad to diminish these charges, tria si velit
recinia and vincula purpurea, and december tibicines plus ne adhibeto.

Lastly, They comforted the living after the dead were buried.
after the burial was ended they used to comfort the living after this manner;
first, sit consolatio tua in Caelis; secondly, quis audet deo dicere, quid
fecisti? thirdly, they repeated these words of Esaias, chap. 25.8. he will
swallow up death in victory, and wipe away all tears from their faces; and
Psalm. 72.16 they shall flourish and spring again as the grass on the earth:
they b^leeved the resurrection of the body, (...) Domus viventium.
therefore they called the Churchyard [Beth chaijm,] domus viventium, and as
our souls lodge but a while in the body as in a tabernacle, 2 Cor. 5.1. so
our bodies lodge but a while in ^he grave as in a tabernacle, (...).
Act. 2.26. (...), my flesh rests in hope as in a tabernacle, and then they
cried, Zacor ki gnapher anachun, (...) Dominus penset jacturam tuam.
remember that we are but dust, and they conclude with this of Job 1. the Lord
has given and the Lord has taken, blessed be the name of the Lord. When their
little children died, they used not many speeches of consolation, but only
said, the Lord recompense thy loss; Job has a notable saying, I came naked
out of my mothers womb, and I shall go naked thither again; How shall I go
thither again? it is not taken for the same place, but for the same condition;
hence it is that the inferior parts of the earth are called both the mothers
womb and the grave, Psalm. 139.15. I was curiously wrought in the lower parts
of the earth; that is, in my mothers womb, Ephesians. 4.9. Christ is said to
descend into the lower parts of the earth, that is, into his mothers womb, and
see the affinity betwixt the belly and the grave, Christ joyneth them
together, Mat. 12. As Jonas was three days and three nights in the belly of
the Whale, so shall the son of man be in the heart of the earth: and Solomon,
Prove. 30. joyneth them together, there are three things that are not satisfied,
the grave, and the barren womb, etc.

Job 30.23. that the grave is, domus constitutionis omni vivo, that is, the
house in which we are all appointed to meet, and it is domus saeculi, the house
of our age in which we dwell a long time, therefore we should often think of
it, and not put the evil day far from us, and make a covenant with death.

Of the JEWS Oeconomicks.
Of the time of their Repast.
THey had but two times of their Repast, Dinner and Supper, they had no
breakfast; Peter had eaten nothing at the sixth hour, Act. 10.10. and Act.
2.15. those are not drunk as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of
the day.

But it may seem, Ioh. 21.4. it is said, that when the morning was come, Jesus
stood on the shore and said, children have ye any meat?

The reason of this was, Eccles. 10.16. Woe to thee O land, when thy Princes
eat in the morning: they did not eat in the morning, because it was the
fittest time for judging and deciding Controversies; and therefore the Whores
of old were called Nonariae, Persius Satyr. 1.
because they came not out to commit their villainy till after the ninth hour,
when men had ended their businesses; and the Lord bids them execute
judgment in the morning, Iere. 21.12.

The time of Dinner was the time when they refreshed themselves first. Ioh.
21.12. Jesus said unto them, come and dine: so Luke 11.37. And as he spoke a
certain Pharisie besought him to dine with him: and the second refreshment was
at the time of Supper; this was called (...); they spent a longer time at
Supper than at Dinner, All Banquets called Suppers sometimes.
and therefore afterward they put (...) for (...), Dinner, and they called all
Banquets, Suppers, in what time soever of the day they were, although they were
not in the Evening, and (...) and permutantur, the one is put for the other, as
that which Matthew calls a Dinner, cap. 22.4. Luke calls a Supper, 14.16.

The Greeks fed more sumptuously.
The Greeks had (...), prandium, secondly, they had (...), a refreshment
betwixt Dinner and Supper, which is called Merenda, a beaver or afternoons
drink; and they called this Caenae (...); thirdly, they had their Supper, and
then they had Banquets after Supper; and this the Greeks called (...), Latin
comessatio, (...), to keep a Banquet with whores; and Paul alludeth to this
word, (...) Deus Moabitarum.
Romans 13.13. Let us walk honestly as in the day, (...), not in rioting and
drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness. And because the Jews used to
travail so far before the heat of the day, therefore they called this space
which they travailed diaetam terrae, Genesis 35.16. This shows their moderate
diet.

They were sparing at Dinner, and they fed more freely at Supper; the Lord gave
them bread in the morning, and but Quails at night, Exodus 16.12.

They measured the hours by their shadow.
They went to Supper at the ninth hour, after the Evening Sacrifice, and before
the setting of the Sun they ended it; this was called Hesperismus; the
ancient Greeks called this (...), that is, the time when a man's shadow was ten
foot in length, for they measured the hours by their shadow, when the shadow
was of such a length, then it was such an hour; when their shadow was six foot
long, then they used to wash themselves, and when it was ten foot long, then
they went to Supper.

The meat upon which they fed at Dinner and Supper was called [Sagnadah] their
sustentation, (...) Fulcrum. a (...) Fulcire. (...) rapere.
and [Tereph] victus their food, which comes from the root Taraph, to take
by rapine, or hunt for the prey; because of old they hunted for their meat,
Genesis 27.3. Take thy weapons, thy Quiver, and thy Bow, and go out to the field,
and take [hunt] me some Venison.

Things set before them upon the Table were Esculenta, poculenta, and
condimenta, the first for meat, What things were set upon the Table.
the second for drink, and the third for sauce to relish their meat; Meat and
drink the Scriptures oftentimes express by bread and water, 2 King. 6.22. set
bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink: then it is added in
the next verse, he prepared great provision for them.

Their bread was of Wheat, Barley, Lentils, and Beans, Of their bread.
Wheat was the most excellent bread, Deuteronomy. 32.14. I fed thee with fat of the
kidneys of Wheat; this bread when it was not fermented, was called the poores
bread, Deuteronomy. 16 3. because the poor had not leisure to ferment it.

The second sort of bread was of Barley, Barley a base bread.
which was abaser sort of bread, used only in time of scarcity, Revel. 6.6.
And for the baseness of it Gideon is compared to a Barley Cake, Judge. 7.13.
those were called by the Greeks (...), eaters of Barley; this Barley-bread is
a bread which nourishes little, therefore it was a great blessing of Christ,
when he fed five thousand with five barley loaves, Ioh. 6.9.

They had a more baser sort of bread made of Lentils, Millet, and Fitches.
Ezekiel. 4.9. Daniel and his companions eat of the Lentils, Dan. 1.12. Why Daniel
eat Lentiles.
And the reason seems to be this why they eat Lentils and refused the Kings
meat, because they used not these Lentils in their Sacrifices to their Idols.
The Romans of old took their name from those, and they were called Lenticuli
and Fabij.

They used also to eat herbs, Prove. 15.17. Better is a dinner of herbs where
love is, than a stalled Ox and hatred therewith: and Romans 14.2. another who is
weak eats herbs: and the reason why they would eat herbs seems to be
this, because men before the Flood eat herbs only.

Their other meats were called Opsonia, and their coursest sort of meat was
Locusts and wild honey, Mat. 3.4. there were sundry sorts of Locusts, of
which, four sorts were clean, Levit. 11. the rest they might not eat of them.

Of their drink.
Their drink was water, Sicera a composed strong drink, and wine mixed, or
(...) not mixed; if they mixed it with water, (...) vinum mixtum (...) miscuit.
then they were said (...), and when it was mixed with spices, it was called
[Mimsach] Libamen, mustum.

Their Condimenta, the sauces which made their meats to relish, were Salt and
Vinegar only. Ruth 2.14. Dip thy morsel in the Vinegar.

The spare diet of Gods people.
By this which has been said, we may perceive what was the sober diet of the
people of God in old times, they used but a spare diet; this was called by the
Latins, Mensa necessaria, and Seneca hanc mensam produxit ad aquam and panem.

Three sorts of diet.
There are three sorts of dyets set down in the Scripture; John Baptists diet,
Christ's diet, and the Epicures diet: John the Baptist came neither eating nor
drinking, Mat. 11.18. That is, he eat wild honey, and the coursest things; Our
Lord drank Wine, but yet very moderately: the Epicures diet is, Let us eat,
let us drink, for to morrow we shall die, 1 Cor. 15.32. John the Baptists diet
and Christ's diet are not the two extremes, but they are both virtues, the two
extremes are the Epicures diet, Let us eat, let us drink; and the diet of the
scrupulous man who eats only herbs, Romans 14.2. the Epicure takes God to be
an indulgent father to him, in giving him the creatures to eat of them at his
pleasure; and the other takes God to be a niggard, who grants not the
liberal use of the creatures to his children.

Of the manner how they sat at Table.
AT the first in the days of the Patriarchs they sat straight up as we do
now, and afterward they sat in beds; and some hold that they learned this
custom from the Persians, but this custom was more ancient than the Persians,
for it was in the days of Samuel, 1 Samuel 9.22. And he brought them into the
Parlor, and made them sit in the chiefest place. Ezekiel. 23 41. 2 Samuel 4.5.

Sometimes they had triclinia, when three sat in a bed, or biclinia, when two
sat in a bed, and they had (...), when they did Luxuriare.

Christ and his Disciples when they eat the Sacrament, they sat in beds,
therefore when the Church of Corinth received the Sacrament together, we must
not think that they sat in beds as Christ and his Apostles did, for then they
should have had too many beds, which had been excessive, and contrary to the
more modest custom of the Greeks.

This kind of sitting was half sitting and half leaning, which the
Evangelist calls (...), yet because it was usual Table Gesture, they call it
sitting. Ezekiel. 23.41. and the Hebrews call their Chambers Mesubboth, and their
sitters Mesubhim.

If three sat in a bed, then the midst was the chiefest place, and he that lay
in his bosom erat secundus a primo, he was in the second place, and he that
sat next unto him, was in the third place; he that was best beloved leaned in
the bosom of the Master of the feast; To lean in the bosom a token of love.
from this custom is that speech borrowed, to be in Abraham's bosom, to
signify that familiarity and society, which the Saints of God shall have
with the Father of the faithful in the Heaven, and also to signify the unity
of essence in the Father and the Son, he is said to come out of the bosom of
the Father, Ioh. 1.18.

Of their Feasts.
OF their sundry sorts of feasts, of those who were invited to their feasts, of
the number of those who sat at their feasts, the end wherefore they made
feasts, and more particularly, of their excess and pomp in their feasting
compared with the Greeks.

They had feasts at their marriage.
First, they had feasts before their marriages, in their marriages, and after
their marriages; before their marriage, and these feasts were called Kedushim,
sponsalia; and the Greeks called them (...) and (...). Secondly, they had a
feast at the day of their marriage, Genesis 29.22. And Laban gathered together all
the men of the place and made a feast; and Ioh. 2. Christ was present at a
marriage feast in Cana of Galile: and Christ alludeth to this form, Luke 14.8.
When thou art bidden to a wedding, that is, to the feast at the wedding; so
Rev. 19.9. And so they had a feast after the marriage; and the Greeks called
these (...), and the gifts which were brought to the bride after she was
married were called (...), because the veil was taken off her face then, and
these things which were offered to her after she was unvailed, were called
(...).

Secondly, Feasts at the weaning of their children.
the Jews had feasts at the weaning of their children, and not at the day of
their birth, Genesis 21.8. but the Heathen had feasts at the day of their birth,
as Pharaoh, Genesis 40.20. and Herod, Mat. 14.16. and this was called (...).

Thirdly, they had feasts at the day of their death, Feasts at their death and
burial.
Iere. 16.7. Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to
comfort them for the dead, neither shall men give them the cup of consolation
to drink for their father, or for their mother; thou shall not also go into
the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink: the Greeks
called these (...), and (...) was Epulum sepulchrale: and afterward this
feasting degenerated much, for they used to set meat upon the graves of the
dead; and Syracides alludeth to these delicates poured upon a mouth shut up,
are as messes of meat set upon a grave, Ecclus 30.18. So afterward in the
primitive Church they had Caenam novendinalem for the souls departed, they
feasted the poor for the space of nine days, and they prayed, that the souls
might have a refreshment in that time; and this was discharged in the Council
of Carthage.

So they had a feast when they made a Covenant, Feasts at their Covenants.
as Jacob and Laban, Genesis 31.54. so Joshua and the Gibeonites, Josh. 9.14. And
the Greeks called these feasts (...), from (...) libo. The Scythians in their
Covenants and feasts did drink others blood, these the Greeks called (...),
sanguinipotas, drinkers of blood.

So they made feasts when they departed from others at their farewell, Genesis
31.27. (...), sacrificia ante expeditionem.
and these the Greeks called (...).

So they made feasts at the returning of their friends to welcome them home, as
the father of the forlorn son killed the fed Calfe when his son came home;
and these feasts the Greeks called (...); so Joseph made a feast when his
brethren returned to him, Genesis 49.16.

Who were invited and who not?
Those who were invited to their feasts were called (...), and they who were not
invited were called (...) adscititij, and they were called (...), umbrae, et
muscae advolantes, and (...) qui lingua sua se nutriunt; and they were said
(...), a metaphor borrowed from the dogs who fan with their tails when men
feed them.

The number at their feast.
The number which they invited were not many; in that feast of Jobs children
were his seven sons and three daughters; and Christ and his twelve Disciples,
and therefore that is false, septem convivium, and novem convitium: the Greeks
said, incipere debet a Gratiarum numero, and progredi ad Musarum, that is, they
would have no fewer than three at a feast, and no more than nine.

What persons were to be invited.
The persons invited should be the poor especially; when thou make a feast,
bid not the rich but the poor, that is, the poor rather than the rich, men
should not invite to be invited again. Luke 6.12. men should not invite (...)
or (...), whose God is their belly. Heliogabalus invited to his feast, eight
black, eight blind, eight lame, eight hoarse; he made no choice of his guests,
but he made a mock of it.

The end of their feasts.
The end wherefore they made feasts, was the glory of God, 1 Cor. 10.31.
Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do do all to the
glory of God: Asshuerus feast was only to show his magnificence and pride,
but Esthers feast was for the glory of God, and for the safety of the Church.

Breaking of bread a token of love.
The second end of their feasts, was to express their hearty love and
friendship, for to eat and drink together, was the greatest token of love and
friendship, 2 Samuel 12.3. He had an Ewe-lambe etc. which did eat of his own
meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his own bosom: so Psalm. 41.9.
Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread: and
so the communion in the life to come is expressed by eating of bread, Luke
14.15. Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God: and Obadiah
7. these three are joined together, viri faederis, pacis, and panis, that is,
that makes a Covenant together, that has peace, and that eat together; but
Absolon killed Amnon at the feast; so Gedaliah was killed by Ismael at the
feast, Iere. 40. and John the Baptist by Herod, Mat. 14.

Of the place where the Romans used to make their Feast.
THe place where the Romans sat at their meat was called Caenaculum, and where
they lay it was called Cubiculum, and by the Greeks Triclinium.

The ancients at the first sat in the Kirchin, The place where they feasted.
or a place near to the Kitchen, where they did dine or suppe, and this was
called Atrium, from the blacknes of the smoke, and the Courts afterward kept
this name, and they were called Atria, then they changed from this place and
removed to an upper chamber, and there they used to dine and suppe, the Jews
following the Roman custom who had subdued them, sat also in an upper chamber;
Christ and his Disciples eat the Passover in an upper chamber, according to
the custom of the Romans; these Chambers were called Conclavia, closets, or
secret places; and Christ says, when thou prayest enter into thy Closet, Mat.
6.6.

The beds which they had were called Discubitorij Lecti, or Toralia, and they
were covered with herbs and straw before they found out Quilts or sowed
Coverings called stragula, How the beds on which they eat were called.
and the Greeks called them (...) and (...), and they differed from the
sleeping beds called (...), a bed wherein one slept, and sometimes they had
three and sometimes four of those beds in a Chamber.

The form of their beds.
For those three beds, the Ancients made one long bed called (...), after the
form of the Greek Letter (...), that it might almost compass about the round
Table, which they called Semirotundum suggestum, an half round Table, like the
Greek (...), and it was thus painted Martial. Accipe lunata scriptum testudine
sigma.
Octo capit, veniat, quisquis amicus erit.
And the round Table joined with it, was called Antisigma, because it made a
semicircle upon the other part, it was semirotundus suggestus, and joining with
the bed, it made the full circle; this great bed sometimes contained seven;
Martial: De Stibadio, Lib. 14.
Septem sigma capit, sex sumus, add lupum. Christ and his Disciples sat not in
Stabidio, but in several beds, in biclinijs, or triclinijs.

He who made those beds was called Lectisterniator, and he who kept the chamber
clean after the beds were made, The decking of their beds and chambers.
was called Mediastinus, the charge of those was to hang the Chamber with
Tapestry and Curtains; and Christ means of such a Chamber when he says, he
will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared, there make ready for
us, Mark. 14.15.

The Tables which they had, either stood upon one foot, and they were called
(...), or upon two, and they were called bipedes, or upon three, and they were
called tripodes.

At the first, their Tables were not covered with linen, How their Tables were
covered.
but after Supper they took a Brush or Sponge and swept the Table.

Martial: Haec tibi sort datur tergendis spongla mensis. Afterward they used
to cover their Tables Gausapo villoso, with a cloth made of rough Cotton, and
afterward with linen, and they had Napkins with which they wiped their hands
called (...).

They had mensam urnariam a Table upon which their vessels stood; by Varro
called Cylibantum (...), Of their Tables.
because it kept the Cups, and it was called Gartibulum or Gertibulum, a
gerendis vasibus; this mensa urnaria stood but in the Kitchen, but the other
stood in triclinijs, in their upper chambers.

When the Chamber and the Table were thus prepared, the guests were washed in
baths, Of their washing before meat.
and then they were anointed; the servants who anointed them were called
Vnctores or (...), and the place where they were anointed was called (...),
they washed their feet, and the vessel in which they washed their feet was
called Pelluvium, and that in which they washed their hands was called
Malluvium; when they washed before the dinner, it was called (...), and after
dinner (...).

They were curious in anointing of their bodies; Of their anointing.
for every part of the body they had a several ointment; they anointed the
feet with Egyptian ointment, the cheeks and the breast with the Phaenician,
but the arms with the Sisymbrian, the neck and the cheeks with the ointment
made of the herb Serpillum.

Chiefly they anointed their head and their feet with Nardus, and this by
Mark, cap. 14.3. is called (...), upright Nard, and the box in which it was
kept, was called Alabastris, a box cut out of a precious stone in Egypt.

When they sat at these costly Tables, they had great banquets and feasts; this
was called Cana dubia, caena opipara, caena ebria, by Plautus, caena
triumphalis, by Plinius, caena dapsilis; Opposite to these was caena pura, caena
sine sanguine, and caena terrestris, in which they eat only herbs.

Of their manner of drinking.
THey measured their drink by a cup called Cyathus, and some were said potare
sextantes, quadrantes, trientes; He that drank Sextans was of a weak body;
he that drank Deuux was a drunkard, he that drank triens was one of the
middle sort; they used to drink harmonice, there were three sorts of mixtures
like three harmonies in music, the first was (...), three parts of water and
two of wine; secondly, (...), when they mixed three of water and one of wine;
thirdly, (...), when one part of wine, and two of water were mixed.

They drank sometimes nine cups for the nine Muses, and three for the three
fatal sisters.

Ausonius, Ter bibe, vel toties ternos, sic mystica lex est.
Vel tria potandi, vel ter tria multiplicandi.
And sometimes they drank as many cups as there were letters in their friends
name, to whom they drank.

Martial. Nevia sex Cyathis, septem Iustina bibatur. And sometimes amongst the
Romans, they drank as many cups as they wished years to him for whom they
drank, and they used to cool their wine in snow water; so they had a vessel
in quo solebant aquam colare, in which they used to strain the water.

Martial. Attenuare nives norunt, and Lintea nostra,
Frigidior caelo non salit unda tua.
They had a Master of the feast, called Pater discubitus, and by Tacitus, Rex
convivij, and the Greeks called him (...) and (...), who assigned to every man
his place where he should sit, and (...), who tasted the wine before others
drank.

When they were at Supper, they had all sort of music and perfumes, and when
they departed the Master of the feast gave them (...), gifts; so our Lord in
his great and last feast, had his perfumes, his prayers sweetning the prayers
of the Saints, they had their hymn, and he had (...), he gave them his flesh
and his blood.

Of their Apparel.
THe matter of their Apparel was Wool, Linen, and Silk, and Xylinum, which
was a middle betwixt Woollen and Linen.

Silk was called Meshi, Ezekiel. 16.10.13. (...) Sericum. a (...) extrahere.
Aquila translateth it (...), because it was soft and smooth, and easy to be
handled, or it was called so, from [Mashah] extrahere, because it was easily
drawn out; silk is not a new invention, as some take it to be, for it was in
use amongst the Hebrews and Greeks, and it was called Serica Medica, because
the Medes brought it upon Camels from Bactria.

Secondly, they had Wool; and thirdly, Byssus, white Linen, which grows in
Egypt and Palestina, like to the leaves of the Poppie; and this is called
Shesh; (...) Xylinum.
shesh is not rightly translated Linen, but it should be translated Xylinum or
Cotton, and the reasons are these, the Lord forbids to make a garment of
linen and woollen, therefore the Curtains could not be made of linen and
woollen, but of [Shesh] byssus, or Cotton; secondly, Linen does not receive
the scarlet dye, as this Xylinum or Byssus does; their courser clothes were of
Camels hair, such as John the Baptist wore.

Of the color of their clothes.
The color of their clothes, first white, Eccles. 9.8. Let thy garments be
always white; those the Hebrews called [Hhorim] Candidi. White clothes a
sign of prosperity.
They used this white as a sign of prosperity, victory, felicity, joy and
gladness. Christ himself upon the Mount appeared clothed in white, so he
appeared to John in white, Revel. 1.13. so the white robes given to the Martyrs
in sign of victory, Revel. 7.14. and white horses, Zach. 6. and Rev. 7.9. the
Saints are brought in clothed in white, bearing Palms in their hands.

Secondly, they had clothes of scarlet color, this was called (...), which
comes of a worm bred in the stalk of a certain herb, and it has Shani
joined with it, because the cloth was twice dyed in it, and this was celled
(...); Matthew says that they put Christ in Coccinea tunica, in a scarlet
coat; the other Evangelists say, in purple, that is, in scarlet tending more to
purple, it was not bright scarlet; and the whore is called the scarlet whore,
because she was dyed with the blood of the Saints, Revel. 17.4. So there was
hyacinthinus color, a violet or purple color.

Of the diverse names of their stuffes, whereof their clothes were made.
FIrst, the Babylonians caused to weaue in diverse colors and pictures in their
cloth, and this was called vestis babylonica: such was that which Achan stole,
Josh. 7.21.

The second was the Phrygian cloth, sowed with needle work, and this was
called opus Phrygionicum, the Hebrews call it rokem. (...)
The hangings of the Tabernacle were such; The Queens vesture was such, Psalm.
45. This the Seventie call (...), from (...) a needle, and (...) sowed with a
needle.

Thirdly, Alexandrinum, the Alexandrian; This was when threeds of diverse
colors were woven together, and this was called (...), multilicium, or
variegatum: such was Joseph's party colored coat, and the Queens daughters
in those days wore a party colored gown. 2 Samuel 13.18. This was also called
Plumarium, which shined like the Doves neck, Psalm. 68.13.

The Assyrians and Canaanites made opus barbaricum, woven in both the sides, or
(...), such was the veil of the Tabernacle, both woven on the one side, and on
the other.

So they had opus plectile, as Aarons girdle; opus interrasile, imbossed work;
so they had vestes undulatas, vel scutulatas, water chamlet.

Of their husbandry.
FIrst, they plowed the ground, (...) aravit. (...) Novellare.
this was called [Hharash] Then they plowed it the next year, and this was
called [nir] novellare: and Jeremiah alludeth to this 4.3. Plow up your fallow
ground; then he harroweth the ground, breaks the clods and makes it smooth,
Esaias 28.24. and prepares it for the seed: This was called occare.

The Ox when he plowed the ground he eat clean provender, so the ass: and
Esaias alludeth to this Esaias 30.24. The Oxen likewise and the young asses that
ear the ground, shall eat clean provender, which has bin winnowed with the
shovell, and with the fan. Their other herds they fed them with Sycamores or
wild figs, Amos 7.14. I was a herdman and a gatherer of Sycamore fruit.

They sowed diverse sorts of grain, Esaias 28.25. as fitches, cummin, wheat,
barley, and rye.

The barley and the flax were smitten with the thunder, but the wheat and the
rye were not smitten, because they were hid in the dark, Exodus 9.31.32. There
was not such difference betwixt the barley and the wheat, that the one was hid
in the ground, when the other was shot up; therefore it is not rightly
translated hidden in the dark, but erant serotina, or somewhat latter.

There were three months betwixt their sowing and their first reaping, and
four months to the full harvest, Ioh. 4.35. Say not ye, there are yet four
months, and then comes harvest? their barley harvest was at the Passover,
and their wheat harvest was at the Pentecost.

Of the manner how they threshed their corn.
THey had sundry forms in threshing of their corn; First, they beat out their
weaker grain with a staff, as their fitches, and cummin, Esaias 28.27. And this
staff was not unlike to our flailes.

Again, some of their grain was trodden out with the feet of Oxen or Horses;
with Oxen Deuteronomy. 25.4. Thou shall not mussle the mouth of the Ox, that treads
out the corn. And Hosea alludeth to this form, Ephraim is an heifer that is
taught, and loves to tread out the corn, Hos. 10.11. So with the feet of
horses, Esaias 28.28. nor bruise it with his horsemen; or else it was bruised out
with an instrument of wood, which was either a plain piece of wood set with
teeth of iron, to cut the straw and bruise out the corn; This was called
hharutz, (...)
for the sharpness of it. Or else they used a wheel to bruise it out, and
this was called gneglah, as the first was called trahea.

A comparison taken from the ripe figs.
HOSEA 9.10. I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, I saw your fathers as
the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time, Cant. 2.13. the fig tree
puts forth her green figs, the green fig was called grossus, and the
ripe fig was called carica, matura ficus. When it is said, that Christ came
to the fig tree, and found nothing but leaves, for the time of figs were
not as yet, Mark. 11.13. it is meant of those first ripe figs, these are
called green, or untimely figs, Revel. 6.13.

The first ripe figs are easily shaken off and fall away. And Nahum alludeth
to this, Nahum 3.12. All thy strong holds shall be like figge-trees with the
first ripe figs, if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the
eater. And as men long most for the first ripe figs, so did the enemies for
Nineve, and one shaking of the enemy should make them fall like the first ripe
figs into their mouth.

A comparison taken from their shepherds.
THe shepherd in cold weather keeps his cloak close about him, and the Lord
alludeth to this form, Ier. 43.12. He shall array himself with the Land of
Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment, that is, he shall take away the
spoils of Egypt, and keep them as sure as the shepherd keeps his cloak
about him.

The shepherds in the East went out and in before their sheep, and their
sheep followed them, and Christ shows this, Ioh. 10.3. The shepherd calls
his sheep by name, and leads them out.

The shepherd has his call, whereby he calls his sheep, and they know his
voice, Ioh. 10.3. He has his shepherds crook, and his rod; the one to
catch them, the other to drive them: and David alludeth to these, Psalm. 23.4.
Thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

The shepherd has his whissle, and his pipe wherewith he delights himself
when he feeds his sheep Judge. 5.16. Why abod'st thou among the sheepfolds to
hear [sharikoth gadarim] it should not be translated, (...) Fistula.
the bleating of the flocks, but why abodest thou amongst the sheepfolds,
delighting to hear the whissle.

Of the miseries of the Children of GOD in this life, and their happy estate
in the life to come.
LVK. 6.19 Then there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and
fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day, and there was a certain beggar
named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores, etc.
IN this Parable are brought in to us the condition of a rich Glutton and a
poor beggar, they are described by their life, and by their death; in their
life, the rich man is described by his great wealth, by his daily fare, and by
his apparel; the beggar by his poverty, and by his disease; by his poverty,
that he lay at the rich man's gate, and begged but the crummes which fell from
his Table, and yet could not get them, and thirdly by his companions, the
dogs who licked his sores; then they are described by their death, he was
carried to heaven by the Angels to Abraham's bosom, and the rich man to hell by
the Devils, and the Parable sets down to us the petition of him who was in
hell, and the occasion of it, because he saw Lazarus a far off in Abraham's
bosom; his petition was, that Abraham would send Lazarus with one drop of
water to cool his tongue, that is refused to him, and the reason set down;
then he puts up a second petition, that Abraham would send Lazarus to his
brethren to testify unto them of the pains and torment which he endured, but
this is also denied, and the reason is subjoyned.

How to know a Parable from a History.
It may be asked first here, whether this be an History or a Parable? It may
seem to be an History and not a Parable; for the Fathers make this difference
betwixt an History and a Parable, they say, that is an History when the
proper names of men are set down, as they say, Job is not a Parable but a
History, because proper names are set down in it; so Lazarus proper name is
set down here, then it may seem not to be a Parable but an History. But we
are to answer, that Lazarus is not a proper name here, but an appellatiue
common to all miserable, wretched, and poor creatures; for in the Syrian
Language which Christ spoke, (...) Vir cui ferri oportet adjumentum.
Lagnazar, est is qui auxilio destitutus est, he that wants all help; it is
not rightly translated Eleazer; as if it were a proper name, but an appellatiue
Lagnazar, that has no help, therefore that collection of some who think,
that the rich man's name is omitted here for disgrace, is not so material, it
being a Parable and not an History.

He was a rich man, and he is described by his clothing, he was clothed in
purple and fine Linen. He was clothed in purple, this purple was the dye that
was gotten from a shel-fish, Purple a costly dye.
and it is not known now in those parts of the world.

Man should not glory in his apparel.
Man has little cause to glory in his apparel, he borrows it from the fish
and from the Worm; the Jews when they describe a man, they say, that man is a
worm, clothed with the excrements of the worm, the expectation of the worms,
and to be consumed, with the worms; the first clothing that ever God made to
man, was of the skins of beasts, and that man should not be proud of his
apparel, see what Christ says, Mat. 6.29. I say unto you, that even Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of the Lillies: this might seem
strange at the first, but if we will consider it rightly, we shall find it to
be most true;

First, Solomon in all his glory, How the Lilly exceeded Solomon in his
glory.
his ornaments were but artificial, but the clothing of the Lillies are
natural; and look how far nature exceeds art, (for art is but an
imitatrix of nature, and her perfection is to imitate nature) therefore the
Lilly exceeded Solomon in all his glory.

Secondly, Solomon when he was so gloriously decked, he was beholden to many
creatures, he was beholden to Egypt for his linen, to the earth for his gold,
to the silk-worme for his silk, to the shel-fish for his purple, and had
nothing of his own; so that if every one of those should have claimed their
own, he should have stood up like Aesops Crow stripped of all, when every one of
the fowls craved their own feathers which they had lent her; but look to the
Lilly which is beholden to no other for its beauty, does not the Lilly then
exceed Solomon in all his glory?

Thirdly, when Solomon was clothed thus, Man's clothes a note of his shame.
it was but a remembrance to him of his fall, and he had as little cause to
glory in these ornaments, as a thief has to glory in a silken rope in which
he is to be hanged, or if a man should glory in the plaster that covers his
wound; but the beauty of the Lilly is natural, it covers not the shame of
it, therefore the Lilly exceeded Solomon in all his glory.

Fourthly, Solomon in all his glory was but one, and how much ado was there
to get one Solomon so decked and clothed? But all the Lillies of the field are
so clothed, therefore the Lilly exceeded Solomon in all his glory; this
should teach us to make but little reckoning of our apparel, because when we
have done our best, and spent all that we have gotten upon apparel, yet the
silly Gilly-floure or a Dasie, shall exceed us in all our glory; make but
small reckoning then of this clothing; labor to put on the Lord Jesus Christ,
that clothing of ne^dle-worke, with which the Church is decked, Psalm. 4.5. put
on Christ's righteousness, and then thou will exceed all the Lillies of the
field in glory.

And fared sumptuously every day. Why this rich man is called a Glutton.
Because he fared so sumptuously every day, therefore he is commonly called the
rich Glutton, Deuteronomy. 20.21. the disobedient son is called a drunkard and
glutton; what man is to be esteemed a glutton? the Hebrews upon this place
say, that he who eats, tartemar carnis, a pound of flesh is a glutton, and he
who drinks logum vini, an English quart of wine is a drunkard; but we must
not restrain it so here, for Judea being a hot Country, a little flesh served
them, but in those cold Countries, where the cold drives in the heat, men's
stomachs digest the meat better, and therefore a man cannot be accounted a
glutton, although he exceed this measure; but he is called a glutton, who
delights in nothing but in eating and drinking. Seneca says, turpe est
mensuram stomachi sui non nosse.

The Glutton made a god of his back and his belly.
He fared sumptuously every day.] He sacrificed to his back and his belly, to
make a god of the belly, what a base god is that? the belly of the beast was
not sacrificed but cast out: Some make a god of their brain and sacrifice to
their own net or yarne, as Habakuk says, cap. 1.16. as Ahitophel: Some make a
god of their arms and strength, as Goliath; and some of their feet, as Hasael
trusted in his feet; but the most base and filthy god of all is to make a god
of their panch; the Lord calls Idols Deos stercoreos, The belly a base god.
gods of dung; to make a god of the bel^y, is Deus stercoreus, a god of dung:
if the Lord should bring in man, and let him see the Idolatry of his heart, as
he let Ezechiel see what vile Idolatry the Jews were committing in the Temple,
Ezech. 8. he should see more vile abomination and Idolatry in his heart, than
ever Ezechiel saw; some sacrificing to this beastly lust or that, some making a
god of their wealth, and some making a god of their belly, but God will destroy
both the meat and the belly, 1 Cor. 6.13. Let us be content then with sober
fare, all a man's travail is for his mouth, Eccles. 6.7. the mouth is but a
little hole, and it should teach us to be contented with little; Man should
learn to be content with little.
but the gluttons appetite is such, that he thinks he could swallow up
Jordan; nature is content with little, but grace will be content with less.
The Israelites when they gave way unto their appetite, they cried for flesh,
for Garlic, Onyons, and for Pepons, nothing would content them.

Lazarus could not get the crummes that fell from his Table; a man has a
double use of his riches, A double use of a man's goods.
a natural use and a spiritual use, there is a sowing to the flesh, and a
sowing to the spirit, Gal. 6.8. the natural use is to maintain our selves and
our families, the spiritual use is, to give to the poor; Nabal knew not this
use, 1 Samuel 25.11. Shall I take my bread, and my water, and my flesh, which I
have killed for my shearers, and give it to men whom I know not whence they be?
Here he knew the natural use how to provide for himself and his family, his
shearers, but he knew not the spiritual use, to give to David and his men in
their neccessitie. So the rich glutton here knew nor the spiritual use of his
riches, to feed poor Lazarus with them, it is this which the Lord will lay to
the charge of the wicked at the last day, I was an hungered, and ye gave me no
meat, Mat. 25.42. The poor in necessity are Lords of the rich men's goods.
The poor in their necessity are Lords of the rich men's goods, Prove. 3.27.
and the rich men are but Stewards and dispensators to them in that case; the
Fathers call the money given to the poor, Trajectitiam pecuniam, for as he
that goes a far journey, takes a bill of exchange with him, and carries
not his money along with him, for fear of robbing; so the children of God,
they lay out their money to the poor, they take Gods bill of exchange for it,
and then it meets them in the world to come; and so their money receives
them into eternal tabernacles, that is, it testifies that they are to be
received into eternal tabernacles.

The miseries of Lazarus.
Let us consider Lazarus his miseries; first, he was poor, then he was sore,
he had none in the same case with him, he sees the rich glutton that Epicure
to prosper, and himself in such a hard case: he might have been here
overtaken with David's temptation, Psalm: 73.13. Verily I have cleansed my heart
in vain, and washed mine hands in innocence, for all the day I am plagued,
and chastened every morning.

A comparison betwixt Job and Lazarus.
Let us compare Job and Lazarus together; Lazarus lay at the gate, Job on the
dunghill; Lazarus had no friends but the dogs, but Job was in a worse case,
for his friends vexed him, and were miserable comforters to him, Job 16.2. Job
was once rich, and then poor, Lazarus was ever poor, solatium aliquando
nunquam fuisse foelicem.

A comparison betwixt the rich glutton and Lazarus.
Compare the rich glutton with poor Lazarus; Lazarus full of sores, the glutton
sound and whole; Lazarus was hungry, he was full and fared sumptuously every
day; Lazarus was clothed in rags, the glutton in purple and fine linen;
Lazarus lay at the gate, but he sat in his Palace; Lazarus could not get the
crumbs that fell from his table, but he had good store of dainties: Lazarus had
no others to attend him, but the dogs only, but he had many gallant men to
wait upon him.

Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores, The creatures are in league with
the children of God.
all the creatures are in league with the children of God, but they are enemies
to the wicked: The Ravens that fed Eliah, pull out the eyes of those that are
disobedient to their parents, Prove 30.17. The Serpents stung the rebellious
Israelites in the wilderness, yet the Viper upon Paul's hand hurt him not, Act.
28.5. The Lions that touched not Daniel, devoured his accusers, Dan. 6.24. And
the dogs that licked Lazarus sores, eat the flesh of Iezabel; And the reason
of this is, the dominion which the Lord gave to man over the creatures at the
beginning, and the image of God in man makes them to acknowledge him as their
Lord.

But ye will say,

They may: and the reason is, Why the beasts stand in awe of the children of
God.
When Adam was in his innocence, he was like unto a Herald that has his coat
of Arms upon him, all stand in fear of him, because he carries the Kings
coat of Arms, but pull this coat off him, no man respects him; so man when
he was clothed with this Image of God, the beasts stood in awe of him.
Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History records, that the Persecutors took
the Christians, and set them naked before the Lions, yet the Lions durst not
touch them, they stood foaming and roaring before them, but hurt them not, and
therefore they were glad to put the skins of wild beasts upon them, to make
the Lions run upon them and tear them; Thou that art a wicked man, and have
no part of this Image of God to defend thee, no marvel if thy dog bite
thee, thy horse brain thee, or thy ox gore thee: Let us study then for to
have this Image repaired in us, if we would be in league with the beasts of the
field.

Beasts surpass man in many duties.
The dogs came and licked his sores; The beasts many times outstrip man in
many duties: The Kine of Bethshemesh went straight forward with the Arc and
declined neither to the right hand nor to the left, but man many times
declineth either to the right hand or to the left, and he keeps not this
midst: The Ox knows his owner, and the Ass his Masters crib, but Israel
does not know, my people do not consider. Esaias 1.3. and Ier. 8.7. Yea the
storke in the heaven knows her appointed times, and the turtle and the crane,
and the swallow observe the time of their coming, but my people know not the
judgment of the Lord. And the Lord sends man to the Ant to learn wisdom,
Prove. 6.6. Go to the ant thou sluggard, consider her ways and be wise.
Balaams Ass saw the Angel sooner then Balaam himself; and therefore is it
that the Scripture calls men beasts, and sends them to be taught by beasts,
which shows how far man is degenerated from his first estate, and what a
low form he is in, when the beasts are set to teach him.

Why God gave his children a small portion in this life.
It may seem strange why the Lord distributeth things so, that he gives such
plenty and abundance to the rich glutton, and so little to Lazarus, seeing the
earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof, Psalm. 24.1. God who does all
things in wisdom, does not this without good reason: The Lord deals with his
children in this life, Simile.
as he did with the Israelites when he brought them to Canaan, Numb. 13.17.
When he brought them to Canaan, South a barren Country.
he made them to go Southward into the Mountains, the South was a dry and
barren part, Judge. 1.15. Thou have given me a South-land, give me also springs
of water: so Psalm. 126.4. Turn again our captivity O Lord, as the streams
in the South, he prays that the Lord would refresh them now in the midst of
bondage as the waters refreshed the dry and barren South. And Iarchi notes,
that the Lord did with his people here, as Merchants do who show the worst
cloth first, Simile.
so deals the Lord with his children, he shows them the worst first: and
as at the wedding in Cana of Galilie, the last wine was the best, so is it
here; the Lord shows his children great afflictions and troubles, the South
part as it were at first, but afterward he brings them to the Land that
flows with milk and honey.

Secondly, he bestows these outward and temporary things but sparingly upon
his children, that he may draw their hearts to the consideration of better
things: he gives the wicked their portion in this life, Psalm. 17.14. Son
remember that thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things, Luke 16.25. but
he reserveth the good things for his own children, that is the holy Ghost, the
graces of the Spirit, Luke 11.9.

It is a matter of great consequence to discern what are the gifts of Gods
favor; Great skill required in discerning the gifts of Gods right hand.
many men think because they have wealth and prosperity, they are the gifts
of Gods favor, and they seem to stand under the Lords right hand, but they
are deceived. Simile.
When Ephraim and Manasseh were brought before Jacob, Ephraim was set at Jacobs
left hand, and Manasseh at his right hand, but Jacob crossed his hands, and
laid his right hand upon Ephraims head, and his left upon the head of Manasseh,
Genesis 48. So many men who seem to stand at the Lords right hand, shall be set
at his left hand, and many who seem to stand at his left hand, shall be set at
his right hand. Lazarus seems to stand now at his left hand, but stay till
you see him die, and the Angels carry him to glory, and then ye shall see him
stand at the Lords right hand.

It is a point of great wisdom to know the Lords dispensing hand; David
prays Psalm. 17.7. separa benignitates tuas, as if he should say, give us
something O Lord, that we may be discerned to be thy children from the wicked,
for by these outward favors we shall never be known to be thy children. The
Lord cares not to throw a portion of this world to a wicked man, as if one
should throw a bone to a dog; but he will know well to whom he gives this
rich gift of eternal life.

Death separateth the godly from the wicked.
And it came to pass that the beggar dyed, and the rich man also dyed. Death
makes a full separation betwixt the children of God and the wicked: the sheep
and the goats may feed together for a while, but the shepherd separateth
them; the wheat and the chafe may lie in one floor together, but the fan
separateth them; and the good and the bad fish may be both in one net, until
they be drawn to the land; and the tares and the wheat may grow in one field
for a while, until the time of harvest: so may the godly and the wicked live
together here for a while, Simile.
but death makes a total and full separation: Moses said to the Israelites,
stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will show to you to
day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them no more
for ever Exodus 14.13. the red Sea made a separation betwixt the Israelites and
the Egyptians for ever. So death separateth the children of God from the
wicked, that they shall never meet again. Betwixt us and you there is a great
gulf fixed, so that they which would pass from hence to you, cannot; neither
can they pass to us, Gods children should have little meddling with the world.
that would come from thence, Luke 16.26. This should teach the children of God
to have little meddling with the wicked, why? because one day there shall be a
total and final separation, and this is a great comfort to his children,
oftentimes now they are afraid of the incursions of the wicked, and of their
bloody hands, but then they shall never be afraid of them: The gates of the
new Jerusalem were not shut at all, Revel. 21.25. to signify that there shall
be no fear of the enemy there.

And he was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom.] Here consider three
things, first, how it comes that the Angels are ministering spirits to man;
secondly, what they minister to man; thirdly, the comfort that we have by their
ministry. First, the ground of their ministry is, because we are reconciled
to God in Christ, when man fell from God, the Angels stood with a flaming sword
to hold him out of Paradise, Genesis 3.24. When Christ reconciled us to God, he
reconciled us also to the Angels: Why the Angels minister to us.
Jacob saw in a vision a Ladder reaching from the earth to the heaven, and the
Angels ascending up and down upon it, Genesis 28.12. Christ is this Ladder, upon
which the Angels come down to minister unto us, Ioh. 1.51. Verily, verily, I
say unto you, hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the Angels of God
ascending and descending upon the son of man.



Whether the Angels do minister to the wicked?
even as the Lord makes his Sun to rise on the evil and on the good, Mat.
5.45. We have examples of this in the Scriptures, when the Israelites were in
the Wilderness, the Angels brought down Manna to them, therefore David says,
He fed them with the bread of Angels, Psalm. 74.25. It is called the bread of
Angels, because it was brought down by their ministry; there were many wicked
men amongst the Israelites who did eat Manna, yet the Angels by their ministry
brought it down to them; another example we have, the Angels came down at
certain times and stirred the Poole, Ioh. 5.4. and whosoever stepped in first,
after that the Poole was stirred, was healed, whether he were bad or good, the
Angels then may minister to wicked men in outward things, but they do not
defend them from spiritual temptations, as they do the children of God in
resisting Satan.

Secondly, when they minister to man; they minister to him in his life time, in
his death, in the grave, and at the resurrection. First, they minister to him
in his life, and they keep him that he dash not his foot against a stone;
Secondly, in his death they wait about his bed to repel Satan, and when the
soul is out of the body, they carry it into Abraham's bosom; and they attend
the bodies of Gods children in the grave, because they are the Temples of the
holy Ghost; and so at the resurrection they shall gather them from the four
corners of the earth, and shall attend them to glory.

Thirdly, we have great comfort by their ministry; first, (...) Vigilantes.
(...) Robustissimi.
they are [Gnirim] vigilantes, the watchful ones, Dan. 4.13. Secondly, they
are [Habhirim] strong ones, Psalm. 78.25. When Solomon went to bed he had
threescore valiant men about it of the valiant of Israel to defend him, Cant
3.7. But what comfort is it to the children of God then to have so many
watchful and strong Angels attending them?

He was carried by the Angels. What strange change was this, that he who was
now lying amongst the dogs is carried by Angels; lying amongst dogs, the most
base and unclean creatures, (therefore they are called Impuri canes, obscaeni
canes,) that he should now be carried by Angels the most excellent creatures
that GOD made, and not carried by one Angel, but by many Angels, as if they
were striving every one to carry him? when a great man dies all men strive to
be about the Coffin, Simile.
one to carry a leg, and another to carry an arm; so do the Angels strive
here to carry Lazarus soul; never man in this world rode in such triumph as
Lazarus soul did: The pomp of the Romans in their Chariots.
the Romans after their Victories in their triumphs they had their Chariots
drawn sometimes with Elephants, sometimes with nimble footed lennets, sometimes
with pyde horses; and we read of Amasis King of Egypt, who had his Chariot
drawn with four Kings whom he had conquered; but what is this to Lazarus
Chariot, who is carried here by the Angels of God; (...)
he rode here [Bemirkebbath hashecinah] in curru majestatis: What shall be done
to the man whom the King will honor? Esther 6.9. he shall not ride upon the
Kings best horse, but in the Kings best Chariot.

Into Abraham's bosom.] This is a speech borrowed from the custom of the
Jews, for they that lay in ones bosom were most dear and familiar with him,
as John leaned in Christ's bosom; therefore it is said that Christ came out of
the bosom of the Father, Ioh. 1.18.

The fathers were partakers of the same salvation that we are partakers of, The
fathers partakers of the same salvation that we are of.
therefore Lazarus is in Abraham's bosom, they shall sit down with Abraham
Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of God, Mat. 8.11. Our Sacraments have the same
name with the Jews Sacraments.
And they eat the same spiritual manna with us, 1 Cor. 10.3 And our Sacraments
have the names of their Sacraments, we are circumcised with circumcision not
made with hands, Colos. 2.11. And Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, 1
Cor. 5.7. Those then who think that the fathers were but fatted up like hogs
with the temporary promises of this life, are foully deceived: Paradise is
called Abraham's bosom, because the faithful as Abraham's children are received
into that same fellowship with him; what is then become of this Limbus Patrum?

The rich man also died and was buried;] Many were the solemnities which were
in this funeral, but nothing of the Angels that carried his soul to heaven;
he carried nothing of all that he had with him, but only the prickles of an
evil conscience, now he leaves all his pomp behind him. R. Solomon
observes, that David sometimes is called David the King, and David King of
Israel, but when the Scripture speaks of his death, he is called but David,
the days of David drew nere that he should die, 1 King. 2.1. so verse. 10.
David slept with his fathers and was buried. All external glory and worldly
pomp leaves a man in his death.

How to make use of Parables. Arguments drawn from the less to the more.
To make use of Parables, we are to consider how the spirit of God in a Parable
draws an argument from the less to the more, as if the unjust Judge because
of the importunity of the widow granted her request, how much more will God
grant the earnest petitions of his children? so the man instantly seeking bread
from his neighbor: the end of these Parables, is to teach us perseverance
only, and no other thing to be gathered out of them.

Secondly, the unjust Steward is commended for providing for himself, here we
are to follow him in the Parable for his foresight, and not for his deceit, so
we commend the Serpent for his craft, but not for his poison.

Nothing to be gathered besides the scope of the Parable.
Thirdly, nothing is to be gathered in a Parable besides the scope, and as we
look not to every particular color in the picture, but to the whole picture;
so we should not look in a Parable to every particular circumstance in it,
but to the general scope; example, the rich Glutton lift up his eyes and saw
Lazarus in heaven, therefore the damned in hell do see the glorified in
heaven; False Collections from this Parable.
a false collection, and it is besides the intention of the Parable; so the
rich Glutton prayed to Abraham; therefore we may pray to the Saints departed;
or that there is water in heaven to quench the thirst of the damned; or that
the souls departed have fingers or eyes or tongues; or that the damned desire
that their brethren come not to those torments, all false collections; but if
they should gather, that the children of God are in great joy, and the damned
in great pain, that were pertinent; Secondly, What may be gathered from this
Parable.
that there is no redemption out of hell; thirdly, that there is no refreshment
to the wicked in hell; fourthly, that the desires of the wicked shall not be
granted to them; fifthly, that those who will not be instructed by the Word
here, will not believe although one should come from the dead to them; and
lastly, that the Word of God, Moses, and the Prophets, are the only means to
beget faith in us here. Thus far we may stretch the Parable, and then we
shall bring a good sense out of it, but if we stretch it farther, then we shall
bring a wrong sense out of it, the wringing of the nose brings forth blood,
Prove. 30.33.

How the wicked may be enlightened by the Preaching of the Gospel, and yet
become worse after they be illuminated.
MAT. 12.43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through
dry places seeking rest, and finds none, then he says, I will return unto
mine house, etc.
CHRIST having taught long amongst the Jews, and illuminated their minds by
working sundry miracles amongst them, and casting out Devils; The scope of the
Parable.
but having wrought no sanctification amongst them, he brings this Parable of
a man dispossessed of a Devil, and being cast out, finding the house empty
and trimmed, returns with seven spirits worse than himself.

The parts of it.
There is the Parable here, and the application of the Parable; the Parable is
set down at large, and the application in few words, even so shall it also be
with this wicked generation.

The Parable it self has three parts, first, possession; secondly,
dispossession; and thirdly, repossession.

Possession in these words, when the evil spirit is gone out of a man: which
implies, that he must first have possession before he be cast out: secondly,
dispossession, and when he is dispossessed, he wandreth in dry places and
finds no rest until he return; and thirdly, repossession, he goes and
takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they
enter in and dwell there, and the last state of that man is worse than the
first.

When the unclean spirit is cast out.] He is an unclean spirit; first, in the
manner of his apparition; secondly, in the manner of his revelation; and
thirdly, in the manner of his operation.

First, in the manner of his apparition, Satan unclean in the manner of his
apparition.
he appears in the likeness of a Goat, a stinking and a vile creature,
therefore the Lord says, They shall no more offer their sacrifices to Devils,
Deuteronomy. 17.7. In the Original it is [Leshegnirim] to the hayrie ones; (...)
they are called the hayrie ones, because they have appeared in the likeness
of Satyrs or wild Goats.

Secondly, In his revelation. (...).
the Devil is an unclean spirit in the manner of his revelation, thou shall
not suffer [Obh] a Witch to line, Exodus 22.18. Obh is called a Bottle or a
Bladder, the Witches are so called, because Satan gave his answers out of their
bellies, and out of the secret passages of nature, and for this they were
called by the Greeks (...).

Thirdly, In his operation.
he is an unclean spirit in the manner of his operation, where ever he lodges
he defiles that soul and that body, therefore the Scriptures call such
sometimes dogs and swine, Revel. 22.15. and the filthiest beasts that are; but
the holy Spirit is most comely in the manner of his apparition, in his
revelation, and operation.

First, in the manner of his apparition, when he appeared it was either in the
likeness of a man or a Dove, How the Holy Ghost appeared.
or in the likeness of fiery tongues; but he never appeared in the likeness
of any filthy beast.

Again, in the manner of his revelation; he revealed himself to his Prophets
in a most comely manner when he spoke in them, he spoke not out of the secret
parts of nature, they did not foame at the mouth as those who were blasted by
the Devil, but the holy Ghost sanctified their tongues, and in great modesty
and comeliness they spoke the truth.

Thirdly, in the manner of his operation he is most holy, for where ever he
lodges, he sanctifies and purifieth that soul and body, therefore he is
compared in the Scriptures to water and to fire, and to the Fullers soap, Psalm.
51.7. Wash me and I shall be whiter than the snow: (...)
in the original it is [Tecabbeseni] play the Fuller upon me. We may know then
whether we be possessed by Satan or not, if we delight in filthiness or
uncleanness, for uncleanness is the unseparable effect of the unclean
spirit: a man may be overtaken by Satan sometimes, and Satan may in part pollute
him, but he delights not in it; The godly delight not in sin.
but if he delight to wallow in that sin, and make no resistance to Satan,
then he is certainly the habitation of Satan; when one offered violence to a
woman under the Law, Deuteronomy. 22.27. if she cried out, she was not to die the
death; but if she held her peace, and consented to that villainy, she was to die
the death: So when Satan comes to pollute the soul and defile the body, if
he cry out with Paul, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
body of this death? Romans 7.24. then we are not to die; but if we hold our
peace, and delight in Satan's temptations which pollute the soul and the body,
then we are to die.

Is cast out of a man.] There is no creature in which Satan delights to
lodge, Satan's delight is to lodge only in man.
but only in man; when he entered into other creatures, it was but only to
deceive man, as when he entered into the Serpent, it was for this end, to
deceive Eva; he cared not for the Serpent it self: so when he entered into the
Gergesites swine, it was not for the swine that he cared, but only that he
might draw the hearts of the Gergesites from Christ by drowning of their swine;
and the reason wherefore he delights to dwell in no other creature but man,
is, because there is no visible creature that can commit sin but man, where
there is not a Law, there is no transgression, for sin is the transgression
of the Law, Romans 4.15. but no Law is given to any visible creature but only to
man. This should be a great motive to humble man, A motive to humility.
when he sees such a great change, that he who was the Temple of the holy
Ghost, should now become a cage for unclean spirits, and to make the house of
God a den of thieves, Mat. 21.13. Was not this a great change, when a man's
house in which he dwelt was made a dunghill? Ezra 6.11. But this is a far
greater change when man who should be the Temple of the holy Ghost, is made a
receptacle for unclean Devils; it was a great change in Naomi, when her
beauty was changed into bitterness; and when the Nazarites that were whiter
than the snow, became black like the cole, Lament. 4.8. and when
Nebuchadnezzar, who was a mighty King became a beast, Dan. 4.33. but those
changes were nothing to this change, when man who was the Temple of the holy
Ghost, should become the cage of unclean Devils.

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man.
Whether did Satan go out willingly here,

He was cast out by force here, Satan goes not out willingly.
by force to cast him out, Satan does not cast out Satan; but when the Lord
casts him out by his power, then he is cast out by force.

Whether is this gift in the Church now or not,

prayer and fasting now, desiring the Lord to cast him out, Mat. 17.21. but to
charge him to go out, or to conjure him, the Church has no such power; Not
lawful to use the sign when the thing signified is not.
to use the sign when the thing signified is not, this is a great abuse, if
the high Priest under the Law should have put in two counterfeit stones in the
brestplate, when there was neither Vrim nor Thummim, and promised by them, to
have the Lord to answer him, had not this been a delusion, so for men now to
use the words of authority, to charge Satan to go out, when this power is not
in the Church, this is but a delusion; the Church has power now by
excommunication to give over wicked men into the hands of Satan, but yet they
become not (...), really possessed, as it was in the Primitive Church. So the
Church now has power to pray to God for the delivery of the party, but they
have not power with authority to charge the unclean spirit; the Church in her
infancy had some extraordinary gifts which are now ceased, as to speak
tongues, to cure the sick, to cast out Devils, and to kill, as Peter did
Ananias and Saphira, Act. 5.5. to strike blind, as Paul did Elymas the
sorcerer, Act. 13.11.

God never withdrawes from hi^ Church gifts which are simply good.
Those gifts which are the best gifts God never withdraws them from his Church
altogether; but other gifts which are not simply the best gifts, he withdraws
them; example, to speak diverse Languages was a gift profitable for the
planting of the Church at the first, but yet it was not simply necessary; Paul
said, he had rather speak five words in a known tongue, than ten thousand
words in an unknown tongue, 1 Cor. 14.19. Those gifts which are most excellent
and simply necessary in the Church, he takes not away, I show unto you a more
excellent way, 1 Cor. 12.31. And the Lord has turned these gifts into more
excellent gifts, Ioh. 14.12. He that believes in me, the works that I do,
shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do.

When Christ was here bodily present with his Disciples, his bodily presence
was not so comfortable to them as his spiritual presence, so when he was
present by miracles, signs, and wonders in the Primitive Church, this was but
a bodily presence in respect of his spiritual presence with us now; when the
LORD wrought these miracles then, it was either to convict the Infidels, or to
strengthen the faith of the weak ones, these miracles were signs, not to them
that believe, Why miracles were wrought.
but to them that believe not. 1 Cor. 14.22. When Paul healed the father of
Publius the Consul, of a Fever, he healed him by a miracle, and made him
presently to arise, Act. 28.8. but he healed not Timothy that way, but seems
rather to play the Physician to him, bidding him drink no longer water but
wine, 1 Timothy 5.23. What was the reason of this? Timothy believed, therefore he
needed not a miracle; but the father of Publius believed not, he was an
Infidel as yet, and therefore a miracle was more necessary for him.

He walks through dry places.] That is, he counts all other places but
deserts in respect of his former habitation.

Seeking rest and finds none.] Satan has three places; Three places of Satan.
first, his place of pleasure; secondly, his place of wandering; and thirdly,
his place of torment; his place of pleasure is an unclean soul, in which he
delights to wallow: his place of wandering is, when he goes about compassing
the earth too and fro, seeking whom he may devout; and his place of torment is
hell. Satan is tormented now when he is in his place of pleasure, and in his
place of wandering, but his full torment is not come, Art thou come hither to
torment us before the time, Mat. 8.29.

The child of God has three places.
So the child of God has three places; his place of pleasure, as Psalm. 84.1.
How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of Hosts, my soul longs, yea even
faints for the Courts of the Lord: so he has his place of grief, Woe is me,
that I sojourne in Mesech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar, Psalm. 120.5. and
he has his place of joy in the Heavens.

The spirits have their rest.
And finds none.] Spirits have their rest, they are not like quicksilver
which has principium motus in se, sed non quietis, but they have principium
motus and quietis, the soul rests when it is delighted, as the body rests
when it lies or sits. Satan's rest is sin, but this is a restless rest,
the true rest of the soul is God only, When the soul rests.
therefore David said, return my soul to thy rest, Psalm. 116.7. When the
soul is not set upon God the right object, Simile.
then it is extra centrum; and as the Needle of the Compass trembles always
until it stand to the North Pole, so the soul has no rest until it be set
upon the right object God himself. The rich man said, soul take thy rest,
when he had his Barnes full, Luke 12 9. But riches cannot bring rest to the
soul, for the more that a covetous man has, the more he coveteth; an example
of this we see in gold-thirstie Babel, Esa. 14.4. the more they had, the more
they coveted: the souls of the wicked are in a sling, 1 Samuel 25. a stone in a
sling is violently tossed about, so are their souls, and they shall get no
rest day nor night, Rev. 14.11. So David compares the wicked to a wheel which
always turns about, Psalm. 83.13. and to a drunken man that lies upon the
top of a Mast, How to find true rest.
Prove. 23.24. If thou would have true rest to thy soul, disburden it of
sin; Look how the poor ship was tossed, so long as Jonas was in her, but
when he was thrown into the Sea, the storm was calmed: so cast out sin, and
then thou may have rest. When a man entertaineth his sin, he is like a man
that is sick on the Sea, he runs from this place to that place to seek
rest, but all in vain, because he has the sickness within himself. (...)
vel sapius (...) per antiphra sin quasi illocalis, infinitus, qui nullo loco
capitur, sed omnibus rebus locum dat.
God is called by the Hebrews [Makom] locus, because he contains all things,
and is contained of none; every thing is kept in its own place, God is the
place for the soul to rest in: the Philosophers say, Bonum ex integra causa
consistit, malum ex quolibet defectu, Goodness cannot consist without the
integrity of all the parts, but evil is a defect of any of them, that a man
be in good health, it is necessary that every humor keep his just temper and
proportion, but to make a man sick, it is enough that one humor only be
distempered: the rest of the soul is GOD, who is all goodness, but any grief
will disquiet the soul; the soul is a disturbed thing, therefore we must
admire his power who can settle it: when Christ calmed the wind and the Sea,
they said, Who is he that both Sea and winds obey? so we may say, when God
calmeth the soul, and puts it to its rest; Why Satan can have no rest.
who is this that the unsettled soul does obey? Satan being so far from God,
who is the place of rest, he cannot find rest.

Then he says, I will return unto my house from whence I came out.

How can Satan return to that place out of which he has been cast?

Satan is cast out two ways, A twofold casting out of Satan.
is wrought sundry ways; first, by civil education, as Nero was very meek
the first five years of his Reign, because he was brought up under Seneca a
good Master, so Julian so long as he was a Reader in the Church, Satan was cast
out of him partially; and sometimes by the constitution of the body, Wicked
men how restrained from sin.
as some abstain from some sins, because of the constitution of their
bodies, as they abstain from drink, because they have a weak brain; and
sometimes by shame; and sometimes by the restraining power of God; but it is
easy for Satan to enter in again when he has but such bars to hold him
out; but where there is a total sanctification, he cannot enter in again
there. Now when we call it a total sanctification, it is meant total here in
parts, but not in degrees, that is, there is no faculty in the soul, but
there is grace in it as well as there is sin, and therefore Satan cannot
enter there again.

Unto mine house from whence I came.
Satan desires to go back into his ancient habitation.
No place can content him so well as his former habitation, wherein he has
dwelt a long time, and he glories more to repossesse himself in his former
habitations, than to purchase new places. When Satan was dispossessed out of
the people of the Jews in the Wilderness by the doctrine of Miracles which
Moses wrought, he sought to be repossessed again; first, by Idolatry;
secondly, by Whoredom with the daughters of Moab, and by rebellion: so when
he was dispossessed out of the Christian Churches in the East, first, he
sought to be repossessed again by schisms and heresies, but especially by
Arrianisme, then he fully repossessed himself again by Mahomet. How to keep
us free from Satan, that he enter not again.
If thou be free from Satan's possession, look not back again as Lots wife
did; Satan is like a Raven, when he is driven from a dead carcass, he flees
but a little from it, and is ready to return to it again; Simile.
when a man comes out of a Bathe, the Physicians prescribe to him then, that
he look well to himself, for he is ready to catch cold, because his pores
are open; so when Satan is cast out, a man has need then to be very vigi^^nt,
that Satan surprise him not again, For if after they have escaped the
pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, they are again entangled, and overcome, the latter end is worse with
them than the beginning, 2 Pet 2.20.

And when he is come, he finds it empty, swept, and garnished.
This house was swept and hung, but it was not well furnished within.

Observe that God never comes to the soul with a privation, but as he takes
away sin, God comes never with an empty hand.
so he puts in grace, pull up the thorns, and then sow the wheat, Iere.
4.3. Cease to do evil, and then learn to do good, Esaias 1. The Lord likes
not this privatiue Divinity, Curse ye Meroz, because they came not to the
help of the Lord, Judge. 5.23. So when I was an hungered, ye gave me no meat at
all. Mat. 25.42. Many men do content themselves with this, they will do their
enemy no harm, they will have no meddling with him, but this is the sweeping of
the house only, but they come not to the positive part, I will do him good,
and therefore Satan may get entrance again.

Then goes he, and takes seven other spirits with him more wicked than
himself.
Here the question may be moved, Whether some Devils be worse than others?
whether some Devils be worse than others? It may seem there are, because
Beelzebub their Prince he is worst, go to the hels prepared for the Devil and
his Angels, Mat. 25.41. And as amongst the good Angels, some are Powers,
Dominions, and some Thrones; so it seems that amongst the wicked Angels,
there are some more wicked than others, they are not then called worse spirits,
because they are more in number only, but they are worse, because they are more
malicious; they are all bad spirits, but some exceed others in malice and
wickedness; many men do mistake Satan and his Angels, they think that some
of them are spirits which do no harm, but they are all sworn enemies to man's
salvation, therefore Satan is called the red Dragon, the red Dragon delights
not only to kill men for hunger, but also for sport to kill them; what can we
look for then of those infernal spirits of destruction?

And the last end of that man is worse than the first.
The end of the wicked is worse than their beginning three ways.
His last end is worse than his beginning in three respects; first, in respect
of God; secondly, in respect of himself; thirdly, in respect of Satan.

First, in respect of God, who justly punishes him this wise, by giving him up
unto a reprobate sense, because he loved not the truth: secondly, his last end
is worse in respect of himself, because he is dyed over again with sin;
those sins in the Scripture are called Scarlet sins. (...)
Scarlet is called Shani or (...), because it is twice dyed. So men when they
fall back, they are dyed anew again, and as recidivatio in morbis est
periculosa, so is the falling into sin anew again. So it is worse in respect
of himself, because after that a man is illuminated, he is more ready to
become profane, Simile.
if he be not sanctified: Take water and heat it, and set it in the air, it
will freeze sooner than cold water; So if a man be illuminated, and have some
taste of sanctification, and then fall back again, he is in a worse case than
he was in before. Thirdly, he is worse in respect of Satan, for when Satan
catches him again, he makes him twice more the child of hell. A Iailor has
a prisoner fettered by the hands, neck, and feet, the prisoner beggeth of
him, that he would release him, he releaseth him all to the foot, he slippeth
his foot out of the fetters and escapes; if the Iailor catch him again, he
lays a double weight upon him, and fettereth him twice as sure as he was
before; so when a sinner seems to escape from Satan, being enlightened and in
some show sanctified, it he fall back again, he brings seven worse spirits
with him.

The application of the Parable is, The application of the Parable.
Even so shall it be also unto this wicked Generation. As if Christ should say,
when I came amongst you, ye were in darkness, but by my ministry ye have
been illuminated, but maliciously now ye impugn this truth, and ye are
possessed with seven worse spirits than before, therefore your end must be
worse than your beginning.

FINIS.
An Addition. Page 122. line 11.
TO raise up seed to the brother, that is, to the eldest brother, Deuteronomy. 25.5.
If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, that is, if the first or
eldest die and have no seed, then his second brother was bound to raise up
seed to him if he were not married; for the Law speaks of brethren dwelling
together, and not married or forisfamiliate: an example of this we have in Er
and Onan, Genesis 38.

Secondly, if he had no brethren, then his nearest Kinsman was bound to
perform this duty to him, if he had not been married.

But it seems that this duty is required of N. Rut. 4. then I should mar
mine own inheritance.

It is only required of him here to redeem the inheritance, but not to marry
his Cousins wife; stare super nomen defuncti, that is, to make his child to be
reputed as the child of the dead, and so the child should not be counted his
son, but the son of Chilion; thus his inheritance should have been marred,
and his name rased out, and this made N. to refuse, but if the Cousin were not
married, then he was bound to marry the wife of his Kinsman.

Viatici parum, and via longinqua est.

LONDON, Printed by T. Cotes for John Bellamie, and are to be sold at his
shop at the sign of the three Golden Lions in Cornehill, near the Royal
Exchange. 1632.

TO The Right Honorable, Sr. Thomas Coventrie Knight, Lord Coventrie, Baron of
Alesborough, Lord Keeper of his Majesty's Great Seal of ENGLAND.
Most Honorable and my very good Lord,
JOB the wisest and the richest Prince in the East, Job. 28.7.
searching where wisdom might be found, he could not find the place thereof;
He could not find it in the land of the living; the depth says, it is not
with me; and the Sea says, it is not with me; the Vultures eye has not seen
it for all his sharp sight; and for the worth of it, it cannot be gotten for
Gold, neither can Silver be weighed for the price thereof; then he subjoyneth,
God understands the way thereof, and he knows the place thereof: for he
looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole heaven. The
wisdom which Job speaks of here, is Gods secret wisdom in his works of
nature, which none of the world, although they were as sharp sighted as the
Eagle, can understand. Now if man be so ignorant in Gods woTkes of nature, much
more is he in the works of grace; and he may say as Agur said, when he
considered Jthiel and Vcal (Jesus Christ the wisdom of the Father) surely I
am more brutish then any man, Pro. 30.2.
and have not the understanding of a man. David when he looked upon the heavens,
Psalm. 19.1.
the works of Gods hands, he said; The heavens declare the glory of God, and
the firmament shows his handy work: then he tells how they declare his
glory and what sort of Preachers they be, The universality of their preaching,
their line is gone out through all the earth even, to the ends of the world;
Then their diligence in preaching, both day and night; Lastly, how plainly
they preach, n all languages. Yet this their preaching is but an indistinct
fort of preaching in respect of the preaching of the Gospel. We may see some of
his wisdom in the heavens which are his handy work: but nothing of the hid
treasure and riches hid up in Jesus Christ, can we learn by this preaching.
But Paul speaking of the preaching of the Gospel by the Apostles, says, their
sound went out into all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world;
Romans 10.18.
he changes their line into their sound. There is a great difference betwixt
these two sorts of preaching, a naughty person winketh with his eyes, he
speaks with his feet, and teaches with his fingers, Pro. 6.13.
but he speaks more distinctly with his tongue: So the Lord preaches
indistinctly (as it were) by his work; but by the sound of his Gospel, he
preaches clearly and plainly. Where shall we find these treasures of grace
and hid wisdom? this treasure is to be found in his Law; therefore the Jews
call it desiderium mundi, and it is more to be desired, than Gold yea than most
fine Gold. Psalm. 19.10.
The Angels themselves with stretched out necks, desire to look into this
mystery; even as the Cherubims with stretched out necks looked down to the
propitiatory. 1 Pet 1.12.
If the Angels have such a desire to behold this wisdom, much more should man
have a desire to search into these mysteries: for he took not upon him the
nature of Angels, Heb. 2.16.
but he took on him the seed of Abraham: Happy is that man that finds this
wisdom, and the man that gets understanding, this wisdom is only to be
found in the Law of the Lord. Pro. 3.13.
I have indevoured (my Noble Lord) in this treatise to make some small path for
the younger sort to this wisdom; And I have abstained from these questions
which do more hurt than good to the Church. Plutarch makes mention of a
number of Suitors to one maid, but they fell to such contention amongst
themselves, that they did tear her all in pieces: too many disputations in
effect do rent the truth, and nimium altercando amittitur veritas: the best
way to come by the knowledge of the truth, is, to be conversant in the Text it
self, and to be acquainted with the phrase of the holy Ghost speaking in his
own language. Let it not seem strange to any, that I seeming a stranger
should take this boldness to offer these my labors to your Lordship. I cannot
acknowledge such strangeness: for we have one Lord, Ephe. 4.13.
one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all; We live all under one
gracious King, Heb. 13.13.
and there is small or no difference in our language: Act. 1.
we differ not as the Cananites and these of Ashdod, ye say sibboleth and we
say shibboleth, Matthew. 26.73.
ye speak the Dialect of Jerusalem, and we the Dialect of Galilee, small or
no difference. But the reason wherefore I made choice of your honor, is the
good report which I hear of you every where, your name smells as the wine of
Lebanon, ye have put on righteousness as a garment, ye are eyes to the blind
and feet to the lame: Hos. 14.7.
the blessing of him that is ready to perish comes upon you, Job 29.14.
and you have caused the widows heart to sing for joy. There were many notable
and excellent parts in Job, he despised not the counsel of his manservant or
of his maidservant, here was his humility; yet when he sat in judgment, what
grace and majesty had he? they gave ear and kept silence at his counsel; the
young men saw him and hid themselves, and the aged arose and stood up before
him; he was hospitable to the poor, Job. 30.1.
he did not eat his morsels alone, he was pitiful to the fatherless and to
the widow, and he disdained the wicked, that he would not set them with the
dogs of his flock: happy is that Land where there are such judges. Another
cause which moved me to grace this work with your Lordships name, is the
desire I have, that others may read it the more willingly for their own
profit, and even as a fair entry leads the beholder to look more
particularly upon every part of the building: so the beholder of this work set
out under the protection of your honors virtue, will the more earnestly affect
the perusing of the same, in confidence that so much worth as is eminent in
your Lordship would hinder any man's boldness to present unto you a trifle. And
for conclusion, when Jacob was to send his son Benjamin into Egypt, Genesis
42.14.
he prayed that God Almighty would give him favor before the man: So my
earnest prayer to God is, that this treatise may first be acceptable to the
Church of God, and then unto your Lordship: And so I have obtained that which I
desire. The grace of God be with your Lordship, and make that the long
continuance in the charge which his Majesty most worthily has laid upon you,
may produce long happiness to this Commonwealth.

Your honors in all dutiful submission, John Weemse.

A loving advertisement to young Students in Divinity, who desire to come to
the knowledge of the holy Scriptures.
LOving Brethren; There be three Schools in which young Divines must be
exercised; the school of Arts and Sciences, the School of grace, and the
School of your vocation. It is a great help and an introduction to Divinity,
to be trained up in the first School of Arts and Sciences: Moses was learned
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, Daniel in the learning of the Chaldeans,
and Dionysius Areopagita was trained up in Philosophy. Act. 7.22.
A certain Scholar amongst the Jews asked one of the R. His Master, Dan. 1.4.
whether he might read any of the humane Writers or not? Act. 17.34.
he gave him this Answer; you may read them, providing you read them neither
day nor night: this was a foolish answer, for the Jews hated all humane
learning; therefore they say, maledictus qui aluerit Suem, aut didicerit
Sapientiam Graecorum, they call all humane learning the wisdom of the Greeks.
But to shut up this School, and to take away all humane learning from a
Divine, were in effect to make him no Divine. The knowledge of all Arts and
Sciences is necessary for him, as of Geometry, Arithmeticke, Geographie, the
knowledge of Physic, but above all the knowledge of the tongues is more
necessary for him, because they are Vehicula scientiarum. But here ye must not
only study that part of the tongues which is called (...), which is mere
Grammar, as to stand upon Letters, Accents, Pronounciation and such, but ye
must go farther to that part which is called (...), the true meaning of the
words, to interpret them out of one language into another, and to understand
one Phrase by another: neither should ye stand here, but ye must go further to
that part which is called (...), to censure and discern the true reading from
the false as the Masoreth did who excelled in this. Jn the wars there are
three sorts of signs to direct the Soldiers, muta, semivocalia and vocalia:
Muta, as the ensigns, Semivocalia, as the trumpets: Vocalia as the words of
the Captain: So some signs are Muta, as Arts and Sciences; Semivocalia, as
the knowledge of the tongues; and Vocalia, as the meaning of the holy Ghost
speaking in the Scriptures. The knowledge of these is most necessary for you
who intend to apply your minds to the study of Divinity: for by them ye shall
understand the Properties and Phrases of the holy Ghost, the ancient customs
of the people of God, and the sweet allusions in the third, which otherwise ye
shall never be able to understand. And if ye begin to learn these tongues
when ye are young, to what great perfection may ye attain unto before ye come
to be teachers of others? Cicero makes mention of Marcus Crassus, Cicero De
orators:
who walking one day upon the sea shore, saw a boy who had found a boat there,
but he having no helps to further him to sail; first he got Oars, then a
Mast, raes, sails, and ropes, and then he set to the Sea: so from little
beginnings, if ye be willing, ye may attain to a great measure of knowledge,
having such helps in this age, which your Fathers never knew, Iud. 8:21
and the gleanings of Ephraim now, are better than the vintage of Abiezer was
then; ye have now many learned and skillful guides. The Jews say, Qui discit a
junioribus cui similis est? Edenti uvas acerbas, and bibenti e torculari: at
qui discit a Senioribus cui similis? Edenti uvas maturas and bibenti vinum
vetus. Ye need not set your teeth on edge with sour Grapes, for now ye have
store of ripe Grapes gathered by your old Masters. The sluggard that keeps
his hand in his bosom, and says, there is a Lion in the way; alleges that
the Jews are but fabulous, Prove. 22.13.
and that it is but lost time to read them: but remember that he said well,
who said, Malogranatum inveni, corticem abjeci, and quod intus est comedi. Cast
away the unprofitable things and make choice of that which is profitable.
Others say, they cannot attain to such perfection in these tongues as the
Translators have done who have Translated, the Scriptures already: and
therefore they will content themselves with their travels; but how shall they
know whether they have translated well or not? They must give credit only to
the bearer, and if the Trench-man fail them, then they are gone. The Queen of
Sheba was much more delighted to hear Solomon himself speak than hear of
him by report, 1 King. 10.7.
for she said she believed not that which was reported of him; and yet the
half was not told her: so brethren, when ye hear an Interpreter speak,
scarce the half is told you: but when ye see it in the original tongues, then
ye will say; it was true which was spoken, and the wisdom that is in them
exceeds the report which we heard. There is such profunditie in the
Scriptures, that all the wits of men can never sound the depth of them; 1 King.
4.
it fares with them as it did with the widows Oil, it lasted as long as the
Children brought vessels: so there is much store and plenty in them, that when
they have filled the wits and understandings of the best, yet there is enough
to be gotten out of them, by those who come after. And here J cannot let pass
how much these honorable Patrons are to be respected, who entertain and
cherish these professors in the tongues, for without such, knowledge would
soon decay. David made a statute in Israel, that they who tarried by the stuff
should part alike with those who went to battle. The professors of the tongues
are they who keep the stuff, and they should be as well rewarded as they who
go to the field and fight in the ministry. 1 Samuel 30.24.
I have indevoured (brethren) according to my mean measure of knowledge to
make a little path unto you, to encourage you, and to let you see what profit
you may have by this kind of study, and how it may serve you in your
ministry, and if ye reap any benefit by it, be thankful to the God of
heaven the Father of lights from whom all good things descend, and then to my
Noble Patron my Lord Keeper who does encourage me much to go on in this kind
of study. And now when we have made some progress in this first School, and
have attained to some measure of knowledge, see that your knowledge turn not
like the waters of Jordan that run into the dead Sea, but let them be like
those waters which come from the Sea and r^turne to the Sea again, let them
return to the praise of him who gave them. Eccles. 17.
Next when ye are in the School of grace, that ye may understand the
Spiritual meaning of the holy Scriptures, acquaint your selves with prayer.
Elias was a man subject to the like passions as we are, Iam. 5.17.
yet he prayed, and the Heavens were opened and gave rain: so although ye be
men, subject to the same passions to which others are subject; yet if ye pray
earnestly to the Lord, he will open the heavens, and send down that Spiritual
rain upon you, and fit you for the School of your calling. Ier. 2.8. (...)
And here ye must be careful to study the Law of the Lord, and to handle it
diligently. Jeremiah borrows this speech from those who are trained in the
wars, and they are said Tractare bellum, ye must be skillful and trained
before ye enter into this calling, Number. 31.27.
that being entered in it, ye may begin to turn the key of knowledge to open
the Scriptures to your headers, so that ye may have store both of new and old
to bring forth when your Lord and Master shall set you over his household to
give his servants their meat in due season. And at last he will say unto you,
Matthew. 25.23:
ye have been faithful over a few things, J will make you ruler over many
things. Lectio stata juvat, Seneca:
varia delecta.

Your Loving brother in the Lord, JOHN WEEMSE.

EXERCITATIONS DIVINE. The first Book, containing diverse Questions for the
understanding of the Scriptures in general.
Exercitat. Divine. 1. Of the excellency of DIVINITY, above all other Sciences.
2 TIMOT. 3.16. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, etc.
HVmane Sciences and Arts, Humane Sciences and Arts compared to the dough
brought out of Egypt, and Divinity to Manna.
have been fitly compared to the dough which the Israelites brought out of
Egypt, Exodus 12.34. which they fed upon until they got Manna: This dough was
prepared by much labor; by plowing, by sowing, by reaping, by grinding,
kneading, and baking: So humane Sciences which are the birth of reason, are
bred below here: but Divinity is like unto Manna which was prepared or ready
to their hand; they neither plowed for it, neither did sow it, nor reaped it.
So Divinity is prepared in heaven, and sent down to teach the Church here
below. The dough which they brought out of Egypt, The dough the bread of the
poor.
Deuteronomy. 16.3. is called, panis pauperum, the poores bread; it is called the
poores bread, because the poor in their necessity could not be at leisure to
ferment it, and it had not so pleasant a relish; therefore it is called the
poores bread: Manna the bread of Angels.
but Manna is called the bread of Angels, Psalm. 78.25. It is called the bread
of Angels, because it was brought down by their ministry; and it was so
pleasant in taste, that if the Angels had eaten bread, it might have served
them: So 1 Cor. 13.1. If I speak with the tongue of Angels, that is, if the
Angels had tongues to speak with: And as far as Manna surpassed the poores
bread, as far and farther does Divinity surpass humane Sciences and Arts.

The world compared to Egypt, and the Church to Canaan.
Again, the world has been well compared to Egypt, and the Church to Canaan:
Egypt was a Land that was watered with the feet of men, Deuteronomy. 11, 10. It was
said to be watered with the feet of men, Egypt watered with the feet of men.
as a garden, because they carried water on foot out of Nilus, and watered
their Land with it: Canaan a land blessed of God.
but Canaan was a Land blessed of God, and his eyes were upon it from the
beginning of the year to the end, Deuteronomy. 11.12. It was a land of hills and
valleys, and drinks water of the rain of heaven. The world is but watered
with humane Sciences and Arts, which are drawn out of the troubled reason of
man like Nilus: but the Church is watered with these celestial graces which
come from above.

A comparison betwixt Divinity, and all other Sciences and Arts in general.
Now that we may see the excellency of Divinity above all other Sciences and
Arts, let us observe wherein they differ in general, and then let us make a
particular comparison betwixt Divinity and other Sciences and Arts.

origin, in the original: humane Sciences and Arts proceed from God as he
is God and general ruler of the world, but Divinity proceeded from the Father
by the Son to the Church, Revel. 22.1. And he showed me a pure river of water
of life, clear as cristall, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the
Lamb: but these humane Sciences and Arts, although they proceed from God, yet
they proceed not from God and the Lamb like a cristall river.

humano-divinae, they are but the brood of reason, which proceeds from God
enlightening every man that comes into the world, Scientia hu^ano-divina
Scientia humana. Scientia diabolica. Scientia divino-divina

John 1.9. Some again are humane and the birth of corrupt man only, as
Sophistry: And thirdly, some are Diabolicae, as necromancie and witchcraft:
But Divinity is Divino-divina, that is, it is originally from God and
immediately.

A comparison betwixt sense, reason, and faith.
with Reason the mother of all other Sciences and Arts, we shall see how far
Divinity excels all other Sciences and Arts.

There are in man, sense, reason, and faith; and as far as reason surpasses
sense, much farther does faith surpass reason; and by consequent Divinity
surpasses all other Sciences.

Reason differs much from sense, How sense, reason, and faith apprehend
things.
for sense the farther that the object is from it, it is magis universale and
magis confusum, it is the more universal and more confused; and the nearer
that the object comes to the sense, it is the less universal and more
distinct: Example, when we see an object a far off, we take it up first to be
ens somewhat, then we take it up to be a living creature, then we take it up to
be a man, and last to be Peter or John; Here the nearer that the object comes
to our sense, it is less universal and more distinct; and the farther that it
is removed from our sense, it is the more universal and more confused. Simile.
The knowledge which a young child has at the first is wonderful confused,
and he will suck any woman for his nurse, this knowledge is very confused:
then his knowledge becomes more distinct and more general, and then he
begins to know, this is not my nurse, and this is not my nurse, but this is
my nurse; here his knowledge begins to be more distinct, and he will suck
none but his own nurse: and his knowledge now, resembles the knowledge which
we have by reason, which ascends from the particular to the general, and the
farther that it is from sense, it is the more universal and less confused.
But faith the daughter of Divinity, ascends higher than reason or sense, and
the further that it goes from sense and reason the more perfect it is, and it
goes from minus universale, to the supreme and highest cause, God himself;
and the nearer that faith comes to reason or sense, the weaker it is and more
indistinct. Thomas his faith was an indistinct faith and weak, and could not
believe unless he put his fingers in the wounds of Christ, John 20.28. here
his faith leaned too much to sense; but faith the higher that it goes from
sense and reason, the more perfect it is; We have a notable example of this,
Genesis 49. when Joseph took Ephraim and Manasse, Ephraim in his right hand
toward Isreal's left hand, and brought him near unto him, and Manasse in his
left hand toward Isreal's right hand, Israel stretched out his right hand and
laid it upon Ephraims head, and his left hand upon Manasses head, guiding his
hands wittingly, or as Onkelos the Chaldee Paraphrast has it, Prudenter egit
manibus suis, when he dealt wisely with his hands: But when Joseph saw that his
father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he
held up his fathers hand, and he said to his father, not so my father, for this
is the first borne, put thy right hand upon his head: and his father refused
and said, I know it my son, I know it truly, the younger shall be greater
than he, Genesis 48.19. Joseph thought because his father Jacob was blind that his
faith was a confused and weak faith, but Jacob knew that the farther his faith
was from sense, and the higher that it ascended from reason, it was the more
perfect, and therefore he said jadanghti been jadanghti, I know it my son,
(...)
I know it; that is, certainly I know it. This is then the excellency of
faith, that the higher that it goes from sense and reason the more perfect it
is, which shows the excellency of Divinity above all other Sciences and
Arts; for if faith the daughter of Divinity surpasses them all, much more
does Divinity it self: and it may be said of faith, as it was said of the
virtuous woman, Prove. 30. Many daughters in Israel have done virtuously, but
thou surpassest them all.

Nethinims the posterity of the Gibionits were appointed by Iosuah to hew wood
and draw water for the Sanctuary, but never to meddle with the Sacrifices,
neither to kill them nor offer them, Josh. 9.23. so humane Sciences and Arts
are appointed but to attend and serve Divinity, they are but to hew the wood,
and draw the water only to the Sanctuary.

There are three principles from whence Sciences and Arts are derived, the
first is contemplation, A comparison betwixt Divinity and other Sciences.
the second is action, the third is operation.

For contemplation, the metaphysics are the most abstract, considering ens ut
ens only: the second are the mathematics, which considers the quantity and
the number of things; geometry the quantity, and arithmeticke the number.
Thirdly, the Physics consider only natural properties of the body.

These who are exercised in actions and moral philosophy, are laws and such.

Arts which are exercised in operation are rhetoric and grammar.

A comparison betwixt Divinity and Metaphysics.
Metaphysicke considers God only, ut ens vuum, verum et bonum, as he has a
being, as he is one, as he is truth and goodness; but it considers not God
as Creator, Christ as Redeemer, it considers not God in his attributes as
Divinity does, and therefore they say metaphysica parit scientiam tantum, sed
theologia fidem.

A comparison betwixt Divinity, Mathematics, anp Physics.
Secondly, compare Divinity with physic and the mathematics, the
mathematician searches visible forms in visible things, the Physician
invisible forms in visible things; but the Divine invisible forms in visible
things.

A comparison betwixt the Divine, the Lawyer, and the Physician.
Thirdly, let us compare the Divine, the Lawyer and Physician; the Physician est
minister naturae, the servant of nature, the Lawyer est minister justitiae, but
the Divine est minister gratiae: and look how far grace exceeds nature or
justice, so as far does Divinity surpass the Physician or the Lawyer.

A comparison betwixt the Divine, and moral Philosopher.
Fourthly, let us compare Divinity and moral philosophy, the Philosopher says,
that Iuvenis non est idoneus auditor moralis Philosophiae, that a young man is
not fit to hear moral philosophy, but David says, Psalm. 119.9. Wherewith
shall a young man cleanse his ways. Chrysostom has a good observatien to
show the force of Divinity above all moral philosophy, when he compares
Plato the moralist and Paul the Apostle together: Plato says he, that wise
Philosopher came three times to Sicilie to convert Dionysius the tyrant to
moral philosophy, yet he went away without any success: but Paul a Tent-maker
did not only convert Sicilie, but ran from Jerusalem to Illyricum, Romans 15.19.
and converted thousands of souls by the preaching of the Gospel. See how far
Divinity excels moral philosophy. August. de Civitate Dei. lib. 6. cap. 11.
And Augustine observes how Seneca the most excellent of all the moralists,
mocked the Jews, because they spent (as he thought) the seventh part of their
life in idleness, which was the Sabbath day. Iustine Martyr being first a
philosopher, and after a martyr, searched through all the sects of philosophy,
and could never find contentment to his soul till he came to Divinity. First
he came to the sect of the Stoickes and gave himself to be a scholar in that
school, but hearing nothing of God in Stoa in that school, he turned to be a
Peripatetick: but when he entered with the Peripateticks, he perceived his
master nundinantem sapientiam mercede (as he speaks) selling his wisdom for
gain, then he left that sect also. Thirdly, he came to the sect of the
Pythagoreans, but having no skill in geometry (which knowledge Pythagoras
required of his Scholars before he taught them philosophy) he left the
Pythagoreans and fell into the society of the Platonickes: at last he met with
a Christian Divine Philosopher who persuaded him to cast aside all these
circular disciplines, and to study Divinity which should give him greater
contentment than all the philosophy in the world, and he renouncing all gave
himself to the studying of the holy Scriptures, and of a Philosopher became
both a Christian and a Martyr. A comparison betwixt Divinity, and Physic
alone.


Fifthly; let us compare Divinity and Physic alone, they say ubi desinit
physicus ibi incipit medicus, Where the natural philosopher leaves, there the
Physician begins, but we may say, ubi desinit physicus, ibi incipit
Theologus, where the Physician leaves off, there the Divine begins; for
when the Physician has done his last cure and given over the patient, here
signs him into the hands of the Divine, or if he be a religious Physician, he
is glad to play the Divine to him himself; the Physician shows the patient
that his health consists in letting of blood, but the Divine shows that the
health of his patient consists by the letting of the blood of Christ.

A comparison betwixt Divinity and the Mathematics alone.
Sixthly, compare Divinity and the mathematics, the mathematician considers
the length, the height and the breadth of things, but be never considers what
is the height, the breadth and the length of the love of Christ, Ephesians. 3.8. he
never teaches a man to number his days, that he may apply his heart to
wisdom, Psalm. 90.12. as the Divine does.

A comparison betwixt Divinity, Grammar, and Rhetoric.
Lastly, compare Divinity with grammar and rhetoric: hearing of others
teaches us to speak; grammar teaches us to speak congruously, and
rhetoric teaches us to speak eloquently, but Divinity teaches us to speak
the language of Canaan, Esaias 19.18.



Pars legis. (...). (...).

of constituting and making of laws: the second is that ligitious part which
is exercised about the pleading of causes; the first part comes nearer to
Divinity than physic does, because the Physician is exercised only about the
health of the body, and if he speak any thing to his patient of temperance or
restraining of his passions, all this he does but for his patients health. But
the nomotheticke or maker of the law, does all things for the well ordering of
the people; and look how much more excellent it is to live well, than to live
in good health: so much more that part of the law excels physic. But
physic again is to be preferred to that part of the Law which is called
litigi^sa or the litigious part of the law, because that part of the law does
not respect the commonwealth, or the manners of the people, but to give this or
that particular man his right: But to cure this or that particular man, is
better than to restore this or that particular man to his goods; for skin for
skin, and all that a man has will he give for his life, Job. 1. therefore
physic excels the litigious part of the Law.

It may be said that Divinity borrows many things of other Sciences,
therefore it may seem not to be so absolute in perfection.

This argues no want in Divinity,

Divinity is not (...) or a general sum of all Sciences and Arts, or one
universal director to all our actions as they are natural, civil, or
oeconomicall.

But Paul bids Timothy take a little wine to comfort him, Tim. 5.23. So
Moses sets down weights and measures in the Law.

When Paul bids Timothy take some wine to comfort him, he is not playing the
Physician here: Moses sets down weights and measures, this is not his last
end that there may be commutative justice amongst the children of Israel; Paul's
last end and chief consideration is this, that Timothy having a sound body may
be able to glorify God in his ministry. So Moses considers weights and
measures, that Gods people might do no wrong, but glorify God in their
calling; And as one thing may belong to the mathematitian in respect of the
midst, and to the Physician in respect of the thing it self, as when a
Physician shows that a round wound is more hardly cured than a long wound,
although the Physician show this by the principles of geometry, yet he cures
not the wound as a Goemetrician but as a Physician. So when a Divine speaks
of weights and measures, and health of body, although they belong to the
politickes or physickes in respect of the midst, yet in respect of the end they
belong to Divinity.

Other Sciences are not directly subordinate to Divinity; these sciences which
are directly subordinate, the conclusions of the superior Sciences are the
principles of the inferior, as the conclusions of arithmeticke are the
principles of music, and these sciences which are directly subordinate here,
have but some new accident added to them, to make a distinction betwixt them
and the superior. Sciences, as music subordinate to arithmeticke has this
accident superadded to it, to be numerus sonorus a number with sound, but
Divinity and other Sciences toto genere differunt, they are altogether
different.

Subordinatio directa. ratione finis.
Sciences and Arts subordinate to Divinity, in respect of the end.
Other Sciences are not directly subordinate to Divinity but only in respect of
the end, the Apothecary is directly subordinate to the Physician; therefore he
prescribes unto him all his ingredients, what hot things he must use and what
cold, what drachmes and what scruples: the Tailor again is not directly
subordinate to the Doctor, but only in respect of the end, therefore the
Doctor prescribes not unto him how much he should make in a gown; ask the
Doctor why he gives physic to a man? and he will answer, for the
preservation of the body: So ask the Tailor why he makes clothes for him? he
will answer for the same end; here the inferior, the Tailor, is subordinate to
the Doctor, only in respect of the end: So all Sciences and Arts are but
indirectly subordinate to Divinity, and in respect of the end, and therefore
they have nor their particular directions from Divinity.

The conclusion of this is: Conclusio. 1.
All Sciences are found out for the benefit of man, but all of them can do him
but little good, until Divinity come in and rectify him.

All Sciences are subordinate to Divinity in respect of the end; Conclusio. 2.
therefore every man should study to be holy, what Science soever he profess:
but profane men think that it becomes not a Physician to be holy, because
they understand not that these Sciences are subordinate to Divinity in respect
of the end.

EXERCITATI. II. What use reason has in Divinity.
2 Cor. 10.5. And bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
Christ.
AS God in the creation set up two lights to guide and to direct the world,
Genesis 1.16. so the Lord has given two lights to direct man; the light of reason
to direct him in things below here, and Divine light to direct him in things
above: Grace does not extinguish reason, but rectifieth it.
these two lights the one of them does not extinguish the other, but only
diminish it, and makes it fall down and give place, and then rectifieth and
exalts it. Esa. 42.15. I will make the rivers ylands, and I will dry up the
pooles. The rivers come from the fountains, but yet when the light of grace
comes in, then the rivers are diminished and they decrease that the dry land
may appear: reason is not taken away here, but it falls down and gives way
to grace; but the pooles shall be dried up, that is, grace takes away schisms
and herisies and dries them up: but when reason submits her self to
Divinity and is rectified, she has good use in Divinity. And even as a Dwarf
set upon a Giants shoulders sees much further than he did before: so does
reason when it is rectified by Divinity; and so grace does not extinguish
reason but perfecteth it: and therefore Iustine Martyr called religion true
philosophy, and then he says, he became a Philosopher when he became a
Christian.

Things that reason is not able to do in Divinity and matters of Faith.
Let us consider first what is above the reach of reason in Divinity. First,
reason cannot be a judge in matters Divine, for reason can never judge of the
object of supernatural verity. Reason shows this much to a man: when it
sees the antecedent and the consequent, that this follows rightly upon that:
but reason never judges of the object of supernatural verity, but Divinity
enlighteneth the mind and makes the spiritual man to judge of this. A
Carpenter when he is working, Simile.
does see by his eye when he applies the square to the wood, whether it be
straight or not; but yet his eye (without the which he cannot see) is not the
judge to try whether the tree be straight or not, but only the square is the
judge: So reason in man (without the which he could not judge) is not the
square to try what is right or what is wrong, but the Word it self is only
the rule and square; reason cannot consider how faith justifies a man, or
whether works be an effect of faith or not, but reason can conclude only ex
concessis, of things granted, if faith be the cause and works the effect, then
they must necessarily go together, and reason goes no higher.

Secondly, no midst taken from philosophy can make up a Divine conclusion,
neither would it beget faith in a man. Example, God is not the efficient cause
of sin, the efficient cause is a term attributed to God: here if a Divine
should go about to prove either by logic or grounds of metaphysicke, this
conclusion were not a Divine conclusion, whereupon a man's faith might rest, as
if he should reason this ways, No efficient cause can produce a defect but an
effect, God is an efficient cause, and sin is a defect, therefore God cannot
produce sin; this were but an humane conclusion and could not beget faith..
So if he should reason from the grounds of metaphysicke this ways, God is ens
entium, and the properties of ens are vnum verum bonum, therefore God who is
ens entium cannot produce sin, because he is goodness it self; the
conclusion were but an humane conclusion and could not beget faith: but if a
Divine should prove the same by a midst taken out of the Scriptures, and should
reason thus. 1 Ioh. 2.16. All that which is in the world, is either the
concupiscence of the flesh, or the lust of the eye, or the pride of life, not
from the Father, this midst will make up a Divine conclusion which will beget
faith in a man, and then the Christian man may say to the Philosopher as the
Samaritans said unto the woman of Samaria, I believe not now for thy reason,
but for the authority of God, which is the ground of my faith.

Thirdly, Philosophy does not inlighten the mind with spiritual knowledge, it
inlightneth the mind only with a general knowledge whereof John speaks,
John 1.9. Romans 1. when he believes, his reason at the first is mere passive;
therefore this speech of Clemens Alexandrinus would be very warily taken, Lib.
1. Strom.
Philosophiam (...) vocat; as though philosophy made an introduction to saving
faith: And this speech of some Divines is harshly spoken, lumen naturae
accendit lumen gratiae, and Basils comparison must not be stretched over far,
as Dyers before they bring on the most perfect dye, they dye first with the
baser color, to make it the more fit to receive the more bright color: So
humane learning may be a preparation to grace. But the comparison is too far
stretched here, humane learning is a preparation to make a man understand the
axioms, syllogismes and logical part in Divinity; but a heathen philosopher
having the help of nature, is no sooner converted to the truth. A learned
Philosopher converted to the faith, Certitudo evidentiae. adhaerentiae.

may have a greater certainty of evidence than a laicke, and may know the
literal sense better, but he has no greater certainety of adherence, as we
see oftentimes when it comes to the point of suffering. But seeing zeal is
not always according to knowledge, therefore knowledge of humane Sciences is a
great help to the knowledge of faith once bred, when it is sanctified.

Reason must not transcend her bounds.
Philosophy must not transcend her bounds and commit Saltum, as they speak in
the Schools, when she takes midsts which are mere philosophical to prove
any thing in Divinity; this was the fault of most of the Schoolmen: but when
she does keep herself within her bounds, then she has good use in Divinity.
Matthew. 22. the Sadduces reason this way concerning the resurrection. If there
were a resurrection, then there should follow a great absurdity, that seven men
should have one wife at the day of judgment: but this is absurd: therefore,
etc. But Divinity tells reason, that here she goes without her bounds,
measuring the estate of the life to come, by the estate of this life, and
borrows midsts which are not Divine to prove this conclusion; for in the life
to come we shall be like Angels, who neither marry nor give in marriage, and
need not to propagate their kind by generation.

Another example. Nicodemus reasoned this ways, He that is borne again must
enter into his mothers womb, Ioh. 3.4 no man can enter again into his mothers
womb, therefore no man can be borne again: but Divinity teaches reason that
she transcendeth her bounds here, and uses a midst which is mere natural to
prove a supernatural conclusion.

A third example, Arrius reasons this ways; he that is begotten is not
eternal, Christ is begotten, therefore he is not eternal: here Divinity
tells reason that she is out of her bounds, and applies her midsts falsely.
There is a threefold generation, Generatio Physica. Metaphysica. Hyperphysica.

first a physical generation, secondly a metaphysicall, and thirdly an
hyperphysicall: physical generation is this, when a mortal man begets a
son, and this is done in time: metaphysicall generation is this, when the
mind begets a word, and this is always done in time: but hyperphysicall
generation is that eternal generation, and this is done before all time; and
Divinity shows reason how she misapplyeth her physical and metaphysicall
generation; to this eternal generation.

Whether is such a proposition true in Divinity, the Son of God begotten from
all eternity, true in Divinity, the Son of God begotten from all eternity,
false in the court of reason: So Mary the Virgin bare a Son, true in
Divinity: Mary the Virgin bare a Son, false in the court of reason?

That which is true in one Science, Israel there was a judicatorie of seventy
who judged of matters of greatest weight, and there was an inferior judicatory,
consisting of three, and these judged of goods and matters of least moment:
that which was truly concluded in the highest judicatory was not false in this
inferior judicatory, although they could not judge of a false Prophet as the
great Synedrion did, yet they held it not false in the lowest judicatory, when
the great Synedrion concluded such a one to be a false Prophet: So that which
is true in Divinity is not false in reason, but only above her reach; and if
any thing were true in one Science, and false in another, then verum non esset
reciproca affectio entis, that is, that which has a being should not be true,
and that which is true should not have a being, these two propositions should
not be converted. Veritas supra rationem. juxta rationem. rationem.

There is a verity that is above reason, and there is a verity which is
agreeable to reason, and there is a verity that is under reason, the first is
of things taken up by faith, the second is of things taken up by reason, the
third is of things taken up by sense, but there is no verity contrary to
reason, it is not against reason to believe that a Virgin conceived and bare a
Son, but it is above reason.

What use reason has in Divinity.
We must not seclude reason altogether from Divinity, Christ himself used the
help of reason against the Sadduces, and Paul against the Jews, Heb. 7.17.
Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek. This is revealed by
God himself that Christ is the King of peace and righteousness, yet to prove
this and to make it manifest to the misbeleeving Jews, he borrows a help of
a logical notation, saying, which is by interpretation, the King of
righteousness, the King of peace, Heb. 7.2. So Christ uses reason against the
Sadduces: God is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, hence he inferferreth
this consequent, that they must live.

Paul were immediately directed by God, that they could not err in their
Midsts, and conclusions as we do.

Paul's extraordinary calling had given him power to use reason, then they had
spoken to the purpose, but he uses reason as common to him and to all other
men, whether Apostles or not Apostles.

But they say, Paul's was greater than ours is.

This we grant, Sadduces, and Paul against the Jews.

But whatsoever was pronounced by Christ against the Sadduces, or by Paul
against the Jews,

Although arguments used by Christ and his Apostles became by and by the Word
of God,

Whether were the Sadduces bound to believe this argument of Christ's, as an
article of their faith,

By the force of this consequence as it were the work of reason, they were not
bound to believe it,

Seeing humane midsts have no force to bind of themselves, why are they used
in proof against men?

This is done for the infirmity of man, who is hard to believe, Simile.
These who have good and perfect sight need no other midst to see by, but the
light; but a man who is of a weak sight and purblind, uses Spectacles as a
help to his sight: so the perverse heriticks make us to bring in these humane
midsts, whereas the midsts taken out of the Word of God should serve by
themselves to convince. When Christ rose again, Thomas doubted of the
resurrection and thought that his body had been but a Spirit, but Christ
bearing with his infirmity, by this humane midst proves that he is flesh,
because he may be touched and felt.

Observe again that in Divinity some propositions are merely Divine, and some
are mixtly Divine. These that are merely Divine, reason can do little thing
here, it can but join the terms together, but it cannot take up these great
mysteries; example, if I were disputing against the Monothelites who denied
that there were two natures in Christ, and should reason thus; Where there are
two natures, there are two wills; but in Christ there are two natures, therefore
two wills. That in Christ there are two wills, this is a proposition merely
Divine, reason can never take up this, yet reason shows this much, where
there are two natures there must be two wills, and it judges only of the
connection of these two, but it cannot judge of the verity of this, whether
there be two wills in Christ or not.



Stoicke called Paul a babbler, Act. 17.18, when he disputed against them for
the resurrection, and called it a new doctrine.

In these propositions again which are mixtly Divine, reason has a further
hand; example, No natural body can be in more places at once, Christ's body is a
natural body, therefore it cannot be in more places at once; this is mixtly
Divine, for the properties of a natural body shows us that it cannot be in
more places at once, and the Scripture also, shows us that Christ's body is a
natural body.

But is not this a mixture of Divinity and humane reason together, when we
borrow a midst out of the Scriptures, and then confirm the self same thing by
reason?

This makes not a mixture of Divinity and philosophy, but makes only
philosophy to serve Divinity.

When we use reason to help our weakness, we do not ground our faith upon
reason or upon the light of nature, but upon that supernatural light; and the
light of nature comes in, Simile.
but as in the second room to confirm our weakness: and as we ascribe not
the price of the Ring, or the worthiness of it to the Hammer which beats it
out, but to the Gold it self, so our faith is not grounded upon humane reason
or the light of nature, but upon the Word of God it self.

How can reason serve in Divinity seeing the natural man perceives not the
things of God;

We must distinguish inter concretum and abstractum betwixt philosophy and
the Philosopher: many of the Philosophers oppugned the mysteries of Divinity by
their corrupt and natural reason: but true philosophy impugneth it not, and
the greater light extinguisheth not the lesser, and verity does not contradict
it self; and truth in philosophy, is but the footestep of that truth which is
in God by way of excellency.

Conclusi.
The conclusion of this is, contra rationem nemo sobrius dicit, contra
scripturam nemo christianus, and contra ecclesiam nemo pacificus: we must
learn then to give every one of these their own place and not to reject
reason altogether from Divinity, but to captivate her and make her a handmaid
to Divinity.

EXERCITAT. III That the end of Divinity here consists rather in practice
than in contemplation.
Luke. 11.28. Blessed are they that hear the Word of God, and keep it.
THe end of our Divinity here consists in doing rather than contemplation. If
we speak properly, doing is not in the understanding but in the will; when
reason divides, The understanding is speculative, and sets the will on
work.
compoundeth, or frames any proposition within it self, then the
understanding is not said properly to do, but contenting it self within it
self, then it is speculative: but when the understanding sets the will on
work, then the will does, and the understanding but directs the will; and
when the understanding reasons within it self, Actus elicitus. imperatus.

they call this actus elicitus; but when the understanding sets the will on
work, they call this actus imperatus.

A proposition in Divinity commands practice, virtually or formally.
A proposition in Divinity commands us either virtually to practice, or else
formally. Virtually it commands us to practice; example, This is life
eternal, to know thee to be the only true God, and whom thou have sent,
Christ, Ioh. 17.3.11. This is a proposition which virtually includes in it
practice; for as the Hebrews say, verba notitiae includunt verba affectus,
Words of knowledge include words of affection: if it be life eternal for us to
know God, then it is life eternal also for us to love God.

This proposition again in Divinity, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, Matthew. 22.37. and
thy neighbor as thy self, verse. 39. commands practice formally.

Secondly a proposition in Divinity urges practice either mediatly or
immediately: mediatly, A proposition in Divinity, commands practice,
mediately or immediately.
as God is summum bonum the chief good; out of this mediate proposition we
gather an immediate, therefore we are to love him above all things.

Thirdly, these conclusions in Divinity which conclude for practice, If the
conclusions be practicke, the propositions must be practicke.
the propositions out of which they are drawn, must also be for practice and
not for contemplation, nam nihil agit extra genus suum, as they say in the
Schools; as we cannot gather grapes of thorns, or figgs of thistels, Matthew.
7.16. So new wine cannot be the cause why the Apostles spoke with diverse
tongues, Act. 2. So we cannot gather conclusions of practice from speculative
propositions.

Fourthly, these rules which serve to direct men to practice may be called
rules of practice, as the Carpenters line in his hand is a line of practice,
The word of God is a line and rule of practice.
because it leads him to practice. So the Word of God is the line by the
which we should walk, therefore it is a rule of practice, Gal. 6.6. As many
as walk according to this rule, peace be unto them: (...) is to work by rule
or line, (...).
the Word is the rule of our working, therefore it teaches us practice.

But it may be said, Divinity in heaven to see God face to face, therefore is
the end of our Divinity here upon earth.

inspectrices, as the mathematics, physic, and such (whose end consists
not in doing) are the parents of moral philosophy and of doing, for by these
we take up the nature of things, the goodness and the truth of them, and then
we begin to esteem of them, and love them when we know them; so that
contemplation brings forth always practice. The glorified Saints in heaven,
coming nearer to the first cause, esteem more highly of him, and therefore
they love him more sincerely, and return all praise to him.

Mary is preferred unto Martha, Mary for her contemplation to Martha for her
action.

Mary and Martha are compared together, they resemble not the contemplative and
the active life, but the natural and spiritual life; Mary cares for the
spiritual life, and Martha for the natural. Did not Mary care for practice as
well as Martha? sat she not at Christ's feet that she might learn practice,
that she might wash them with her tears and wipe them with her hair?

And because practice is, joined always with knowledge, therefore the wisdom
which is proper to the understanding is ascribed sometimes to the will, Job.
28.28. to depart from evil is understanding: and therefore it is, that justice
and judgment are joined together in the Scripture, and they are called fools
who do not according to their knowledge. And Solomon says Eccle. 10.2. The
heart of a wise man is at his right hand, because his heart teaches his hand
to put things in practice.

The end of our Divinity is more in practice than in contemplation; therefore
these onagri or wild asses, the Heremites who lived without all society of
men, forget the chief end wherefore they were let here, living rather like
beasts than like men: and if we shall take a view of the ecclesiastical
history, as out of Theodoret and Zozomen, we shall see how unprofitablie these
men have spent their time, leaving the congregation of the Saints of God.
Theodoret writes of one Macedonius qui (...) and gubba dictus est; Cap. 13. de
historia religiosa. (...)
gubba in the Syriacke tongue is a Ditch, he was called gubba because he stood
in a Ditch all his time, and he was called (...), because he eat nothing but
Barley pulse: See how unprofitablie this man spent his time, not giving
himself to reading of the holy Scriptures, for he was altogether ignorant of
them; for when Flavianus the Bishop sent for him that he might make him a
Minister, he was so ignorant of that which the Bishop had done unto him when he
ordained him Minister, that being required the next Sabbath day to come again
to the Church, answered him who came for him, that he was afraid to be made
Minister the next Sabbath day also, and so refused to come; see how this holy
man spent his life for forty years in contemplatin and what great progress he
made in Christian Religion. From (...) a pillar.
So Theodoret makes mention of one Styllites who stood under a pillar all his
life time, and never came into a house. So Zozomen in his ecclesiastical
history, Lib. 6.29.
writes of one Pior, who going out of his fathers house into a desert, vowed
solemnly that he should never see any of his kinsmen or friends again, and
living fifty years there he had a sister who longed to see him before she
dyed: the Bishop pitying the poor woman, granted leave to Pior to come and
visit her, and he returning into his country, and standing before the door
called out his sister, and shutting his eyes, he said unto her, behold, I am
your brother Pior, look upon me as much as you please; but she entreating
him earnestly to come to her house, he altogether refusing went back again to
the Wilderness: and so we read in Theodoret of one Adynus; In Sacra hist.
lib. 14. 8.
who lived ninety years in the Wilderness and never spoke to any man, as if
he had been possessed with a dumb Devil: this is that holy contemplative life
which the Church of Rome commends so much, but this is pure Religion, to
visit the fatherless and widow in their necessity, Iam. 1.27. These
Heremites living this contemplative life were like Polyphemus having but one
eye in his head, and looking ever up but never down.

The opinion of the Schoolmen in this point.
The Schoolmen differ but little in this point, how Divinity teaches us
practice. Thomas and his followers say, that fides non est recta ratio agendi,
sed recta ratio sentiendi; and therefore Contra gentiles he compares faith to
hearing rather than to sight, but he adds that practice follows faith as
the fruit of it: but Scotus makes faith to be habitus practicus. Ye see how
both of them insist in this, that Divinity consists in practice.

The end of the Sadduces and Pharisees Divinity.
The Lord Number. 15.38.39. commanded the Israelites to make fringes upon the
borders of their garments, that they might remember the Commandments of the
Lord and keep them; the Sadduces gave themselves only to look upon the
fringes, and if they had only remembered the Law, they thought then they had
discharged their duties; but the end of the Pharisees was to remember their own
traditions. The end of the Monks and Jesuits Divinity.
So the end of the Monks Divinity now is only idle contemplation with the
Sadduces; and the end of the Jesuits Divinity now is only to practice
mischief: and many Christians when they read the Scriptures now, they read
them not for practice, but for to pass the time with; they are like little
children who seek Nuts to play, but not to break them and eat the kernels.

The conclusion of this is, Iam. 1.22. Conclusi.
Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your selves.

EXERCITAT. IIII. Of Adams knowledge before his fall.
Genesis 2.19. Whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name of
it.
FIrst, consider in Adams knowledge, the manner how he got this knowledge, and
secondly the measure of his knowledge.

His knowledge was inbred knowledge and not acquired; for as soon as he did
behold the creatures, Of the manner how Adam got his knowledge.
never having seen them before, he gave them all names according to their
nature. This knowledge being inbred it could not be acquired also; nam duplex
ejusdem scientiae in vno subjecto, non datur causa, there cannot be two causes
given of one, and the self same knowledge in one subject, although one and the
self same knowledge cannot be said both to be acquired and inbred, Adams
inbred knowledge, and our acquired knowledge, are not diverse sorts of
knowledge.
yet Adam might have had experimental knowledge, afterward of his inbred
knowledge: His inbred knowledge and our acquired knowledge, are not diverse
sorts of knowledge, for as the sight restored to the blind although it was
miraculous, yet when he saw, it was one sort of sight with our sight: so these
inbred habites and acquired habites, are but one sort of habits; but these
inbred habits in Adam, and infused habits, were more excellent than acquired
habits; for these things which God does, are such that nature cannot produce
the like, or so perfect: as that wine which Christ made miraculously at the
marriage of Cana in Galilee, Things done miraculously, are more excellent than
nature can produce them.
Job. 2. was more excellent wine than other natural wine: so when Christ cured
the blind, their sight was more perfect than our natural sight; so when he
made the lame to go Act. 3.16. So the habites of inbred knowledge in Adam,
were more perfect than any other sinful man could ever attain unto, after him.

Of the measure of Adams knowledge.
The creatures are less than the knowledge of God; they were equal with the
knowledge of Adam before his fall, but they exceed our knowledge now. When the
eye looks upon the white color, Simile.
it scatters the sight, and the white color exceeds it; but when it
looks upon the green color, exaequat visum, and it is a proportionable
object for the eye: but when it looks upon a taunie color, it is less than
the sight. So the creatures are less than Gods sight; they were equal with
Adams sight before his fall, like the green color, and they exceed our sight
since the fall, as the white color does exceed our sight; and because the
heart since the fall is not so capable and so large to comprehend the knowledge
of these creatures as it was before the fall, therefore it is said, 1 King.
4.29. that the Lord gave Solomon a wise heart as the sand of the Sea shore,
that is, to know an innumerable kind of things like the sand of the sea. Simile.
When a man is to infuse liquor into a narrow mouthed vessel, that none if it
run by, he enlarges the mouth of the vessel: So did the Lord enlarge the
heart of Solomon that he might conceive this heavenly wisdom, and the
knowledge of all things; but the mind of Adam before his fall needed not this
extention to receive these gifts.

Secondly, the great measure of this knowledge which Adam had before his fall,
may be taken up this ways. The Hebrews write that there were four gates by
the which Adam entered to see the Lord: Porta creaturaru^ visibiliu^ Porta
intelligentiarum. Porta majestatis. Porta gloriae.

the first was the gate of the visible creatures, the second was by the gate of
the Angels, the third was by the gate of majesty, and the fourth was by the
gate of glory; and they say that Adam entered three of these gates, but the
fourth was shut that he entered not in at it in this life.

The first gate was opened unto him, for in the creatures below, here he saw
the majesty and glory of God. The Scriptures when they express any great thing,
(...) est epitheton omnis rei admirandae and magnae. (...)
they join the name of God with it, as Ezekiel. 13.9. great hail is called Gods
hail or sent by God, el gabbish. So 1 Samuel 26. cecidit sopor domini super eos,
that is, a great sleep fell upon them. So a strong Lion is called ariel, the
Lion of God, 2 Samuel 23.10. So Moses is said to be fair to God, that is, very
fair, Act. 7.20. So Ninive was great to God, that is, very great. The beauty
and greatness in the creatures led Adam to take up how great the Lord was.
Jacob when he saw Esau reconciled unto him, said, I have seen thy face, as
though I had seen the face of God, Genesis 33.10. This glimpse of goodness in
the face of Esau, made Jacob take up, how good God was unto him.

The second gate was porta intelligentiarum, the knowledge of the Angels, they
resembled God more than any visible creature does, therefore they are called
Gods Sons, Job. 1. Chapt. and 38. Chapter, 7. verse, and they see his face
continually. Matthew 18. verse 10. As the Kings courtiours are said to see his
face continually, 2 King. 25.25. and the Angels conversing with him, made him
to come nearer to the knowledge of God.

The third gate was porta Majestatis, he saw the majesty of God more clearly
than any other did. Moses is said to see the face of God, and yet it was but
the sight of his back parts, compared with Adams; and we see him but through a
grate, Cant. 2.11. Heb. 11.26.

The fourth gate was porta gloriae. That gate was reserved to be opened for
him in the heavens.

Let us compare the most excellent men with Adam, and see which of them came
nearest unto him; in some things Moses came nearest to him, in somes things
Solomon came nearest unto him, and in some things Daniel, in some things
Joseph, but Christ the second Adam excelled them in all.

A comparison betwixt Moses and Adam.
In the knowledge and sight of God and his attributes, Moses came nearest to
him Exodus 33.13. Teach me thy ways, that is, thy attributes. So Psalm. 103.7.
He made known to Moses his ways, that is, his attributes, for he
subjoyneth, the Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and full of
compassion, and he chideth not for ever; here his ways are his attributes,
Moses came nearest to Adam in this knowledge.

A comparison betwixt Solomon and Adam.
Solomon in the knowledge of the politickes came nearer to Adams knowledge than
Moses did; Moses sat all the day long to judge the people, Exodus 18. and he
stood in need of Iethro's counsel to make choice of helpers; but Solomon
could have found out all these things by himself without the help of another.
Solomon begged wisdom of God, and it was granted unto him, (...)
he desired wisdom to be his (...), to be president of his counsel, and to
be his assister or (...), and to be his (...), to rule happily, Wisdom. 9.4.
Solomon came nearest to the knowledge of Adam in the Politickes, and he is
preferred to the wisest within the Church, as to Heman and Dedan, 1 King. 4.3.
and to the wisest without the Church, as to the Egyptians.

As he came nearest to Adams knowledge in the Politickes, so likewise in the
knowledge of natural things, Solomon came nearest to Adams knowledge in the
Politics.
for as he wrote from the Cedar of Lebanus to the Hyssope that grew out of the
Wall, 2 King. 4.33. that is, as Josephus explaineth it; he wrote parables and
similitudes taken from every one of these kinds: and Tertullian says well,
Familiare est sacris scriptoribus ut sublimiores veritates explicent per
sensibilia; nam idem qui est author naturae, est author gratiae: It is an
usual thing to the holy writers to illustrate heavenly things by earthly
comparisons, for he that is the God of nature is also the God of grace. Solomon
wrote from the tall Cedar to the small Hyssope that grows out of the wall,
that is, from the greatest to the smallest, then he passes by none of them:
The Hebrews mark the two extremes and leave the midst for brevity.
for it is the manner of the Hebrews to mark the two extremes, and to leave
the midst for brevities cause, as Number. 6, 4, from the kernel to the husk,
here the Scripture omitteth the wine which is the midst betwixt the kernel and
the husk. Another example, Exodus 11.5. And all the first borne of the land of
Egypt shall dye, from the first borne of Pharaoh that sits upon the throne,
unto the first borne of the maidservant that sits behind the Mill. The
Scripture omitteth the midst here, the rest of the people for shortness, and
expresses only the two extremes, the highest and the lowest. A third
example, Job 24.20. The womb shall forget him, and the worms shall feed
sweetly upon him, the birth, and the grave, the two extremes include the whole
life. So Psalm. 121.8. The Lord shall keep thy going in, and going out, that
is, all thy ways: So Solomon writing of the two extremes, the tallest and the
least, includes all the rest. Now if Solomon had such knowledge of these
natural things, much more had Adam.

Adam gave fit names to the creatures, knowing their qualities and nature.
Adam had such knowledge of the creatures that he gave them fit names in the
Hebrew expressing their natures, he was a good nomenclator to give every thing
the right name. Plato in Cratillo shows that he who gives the right name to
a thing, must know the nature of it very well; but since the fall men impose
wrong names to things, as they call light darkness, and darkness light.

To what things Adam gave names and to what he gave no names.
When he gave names to the creatures, he gave not names to these creatures in
particular that had not principium individuationis in se, and which differed
not something in subsistence from others, as all herbs of the same kind, and
trees and stones of the same kind; he gave not a name to every one of them in
particular, but gave one name to them all of the same kind: but these who
differed not in essence but in the manner of their subsisting, to these he gave
diverse names, as he called himself Adam and his wife Eve. Adam gave names to
many things which are not found now in the Scripture.
And we are to observe that there are many names which Adam gave to the
creatures in the first imposition, which are not found in the Scriptures now:
the Elephant the greatest beast upon the earth, yet it has no proper name
given to it, (...) dens eboris compositum ex (...) dens and (...) ebur.
in the Scripture it is called Behemoth, Job 40.15. and the teeth of the
Elephant are called Shenhabbim, the teeth of Ivorie, but not the teeth of the
Elephant; and usually the Scripture expresses only the word teeth, as 1 King.
10.18. he made a Throne of teeth, but not of the teeth of the Elephant, because
the Elephant was not so known to the Jews; (...) cornua dentis. Ezekiel. 27.
therefore the Scripture does only circumscribe this beast and the horns of
it; but Adam gave the greatest beast a proper name when he imposed names to the
beasts.

Adam gave proper namer to the creatures.
When Adam imposed names to the beasts, he imposed proper names to them, not
circumscribing them as the Scripture does now for our capacity; example,
Shemamith with the hands of it takes hold on kings houses, (...) Seems to be
Simia, and Solomon sent for such, 1 King. 10.22. (...).
because this word is a hard word to be understood, and may signify either a
Spyder weaving with her hands; or else (...) a Monkie with a long tail (for
kings are delighted in their palaces with such when they see them hung by the
hands) because we cannot take up the nature of this beast by the name alone,
therefore the Scriptures by the effects and properties of it, describes it
more at large for our capacity; but Adam at the first imposed the simple name.
Names which Adam gave were perfect names.


These names which Adam gave to the beasts at the first were most perfect
names, therefore ye shall see other languages to keep some footesteppe still
of the first imposition, as 1 King. 10.22. (...)
Tukkijm are called Peacoks, the Talmud calls it Tabhas, the Arabic called
it Taus, and the Latin Pavo.

David came nearest to Adam in prudencie, A comparison betwixt David and Adam.
for although he was not so wise as Solomon, yet erat prudentior Salomone he
was more prudent than Solomon; therefore the woman of Tekoah said to him, Thou
art wise as an Angel of God, 2 Samuel 14.20.

The Lord asked the king of Tyrus if he could march Daniel in wisdom, Ezekiel.
28.3. A comparison betwixt Adam and Daniel.
Behold thou art wiser than Daniel, there is no secret that they can hide from
thee. Daniel exceeded all the Chaldeans in wisdom, and the Chaldeans exceeded
the Tyrians, therefore Daniel far exceeded all the Tyrians: but yet if we
will compare Daniels wisdom with the wisdom of Solomon, it will come far
short; for Solomon exceeded all the children of the East in wisdom, and came
nearest to Adams knowledge, no sort of wisdom was hid from Solomon, Daniel
only exceeded in interpreting of secrets and heavenly visions.

Joseph came nearest to him in oeconomie, Psalm. 105.22. A comparison betwixt
Joseph and Adam.
he exceeded the Princes of Egypt in wisdom, and taught their senators.

A companion betwixt the first Adam, and the second Adam Christ.
Jesus Christ the second Adam, the personal wisdom of God his Father, far
excelled Solomon; here is a greater than Solomon. Jesus Christ the second Adam
as he excelled Solomon far; so did he the first Adam in wisdom, Psalm. 45.2.
Thou art fairer than the Children of men, in the original it is Iophjaphitha,
which the Hebrews doubling, (...)
express the great beauty that was in him; and sometimes it is put in two
words, as Ier. 46. gnegla jephe pija, (...)
that is, very fair. Christ the second Adam in outward beauty exceeded not,
Non erat decor in facie ejus, He had no form nor comeliness: and when we
shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. Esaias. 53.2. but in
inward wisdom and grace he was fairer than the Sons of men, and excelled
the first Adam.

Adam having such measure of knowledge before his fall, what great presumption
was it in him to presume above that which was revealed unto him. Let us be
content not to be wise above that which is written, 1 Cor. 4.6. and let us
remember that saying of Augustine, Multi propter arborem scientiae amittunt
arborem vitae.

EXERCITAT. V. How the Law is said to be written in the heart of man after the
fall.
Rom 2.15. Which show the work of the Law written in the hearts.
FIrst, let us enquire how these first Principles which are called primo-prima,
are made up in the hearts of man. Secondly, how these secundo-prima principia
are deduced out of these. And thirdly, how these principia make up this which
we call Conscience: and lastly, we shall show that man by this natural
knowledge ingraft in his heart, cannot come to the true and saving knowledge of
God.

These first Principles are made up after this manner: The Lord has put two
faculties into the Soul, one which we call speculative in the understanding,
and another which we call a practik faculty in the will, to prosecute these
things which the understanding shows to her. God has placed first the
speculative in the understanding, that it might follow that eternal reason
that is in Gods Law; for as it is the perfection of Art to imitate nature, so
it is the perfection of nature to imitate this eternal reason, which is Gods
Law; Then he has placed the will into the soul of man to prosecute those
things, which the understanding the speculative faculty shows unto it.

There are some primo-prima principia, Some principles in the speculative, and
some in the practicke faculty.
in the speculative faculty, and some in the practick faculty; this is a
principle in the speculative faculty; Omne totum est majus sua part, and this
is the first principle in the practike faculty, the will, Matthew. 7.12.
Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.

These primo-prima principia are not naturally known quoad actum perfectum,
How the first principles are known.
but they are in potentia propinqua, that is, they may be most easily known;
for that which is actually perfect in the first degree, is always known, and
as soon as the creature existeth, so soon they are known; as the knowledge
of an Angel is not potentiall but ever actual: but these first principles are
made up without any reasoning discourse or foraigne help. And as it is
natural for a stone to move downward, although it be not always moving
downward, yet because it has that weight within it self, and needs no
other help to make it move downward, as it needs of a foraigne help to
cause it to ascend; therefore this motion is said to be natural to it. How the
first principles are natural to the mind.
So because the mind can make up these principles without any discourse;
therefore they are said to be natural to it: but when we make up a conclusion
in a syllogism, the knowledge of this conclusion is not so easily known to
me: but we must borrow some midsts, which are more known to us, to make up
this conclusion. These first principles are naturally known, but the
conclusion in the syllogism is rationaliter known only, by way of discourse.
First principles are naturally known, but the conclusions are known by
discourse.
These first principles the Divines call rations eternas, dignitates,
immobiiia principia, and the Greeks call them (...). If the judgment be sound
and well disposed, then it agrees to those first principles; but if it be
corrupt it declineth them. It is not necessary that all agree in these first
principles, for although some be found who deny them, yet they stand as
principles to those who are of sound judgments; children and mad men
understand not these first principles, yet those who are of sound judgment,
do acknowledge them.

The first principles are not actually, but potentially written in the mind.
These first principles are not actually written in the heart of man, but
potentially: the mind of man is not like a seminary, which contains in it
diverse sorts of seeds: neither is it like the Flintstone which has the fire
lurking within the veins of it, and being stricken upon the steel, casts
out the sparkels of fire which lurked in the veins of it before: but it is
like unto the eye, which being enlightened by the Sun, has that natural
faculty in it to discern colors: So the mind frames these principles when
the objects are laid before it.

A difference between the first inbred principles, and the second inbred
principles.
And out of these primo-prima principia, the mind frames, and makes up
secundo-prima principia: the difference betwixt these primo-prima principia,
and secundo-prima is this: these primo-prima principia, first inbred principles
are contained in the conclusions; but these secundo-prima principia, these
second inbred principles, are as conclusions contained in the principles: now
to clear this by example; this is a first inbred principle in the mind;
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: this
is a second imbred principle drawn from the first, ye shall not murder; this
conclusion drawn from the first principle, contains in it this first
principle, whatsoever ye would men, etc. So that any man may infer thus; I
may not kill my neighbor, because I will that no man should kill me; here this
principle is contained in the conclusion. There are other conclusions drawn
from these secundo-prima principia, Difference between the conclusions drawn
from the first principles, and the conclusions drawn from the second inbred
principles.
which may be called tertiae conclusiones, and these are not so easily made up
as the first; here the conclusions are contained in the principles, and not the
principles in the conclusions as before; example, honor thy father, and thy
mother; this is a second principle; and this; thou shall rise up before the
hoare head, Livit. 19.23. is a conclusion of the third sort: for this follows
not so clearly as the former conclusion, Ye shall rise up before the hoare
head; therefore ye shall honor your father and your mother: but rather this
ways, ye shall honor your father and your mother; therefore ye shall rise
up before the hoare head: hear the conclusion is contained in the principle
and not contra.

This law written in the heart of man, Conscience, what.
makes up this which we call conscience, which is an inbred light in the mind
of man, teaching him to follow that which is good, and to eschew that which is
evil: and it is called conscientia, quasi concludens scientia; and it has a
twofold Act; the first is to give testimony to things, A twofold act of the
conscience.
whether we have done them well or ill; if we have done them well, then it
gives testimony for us, Romans 9.1. my conscience also bearing me witness; and
if we have done evil, Greg. Nazain.
then it testifies against us. Gregory Nazianzen used to call the conscience
paedagogum animae; for as a Pedagogue waits upon a child, and commends him
when he does well, and whippeth him when he does evil; so the conscience when
a man sins, it stingeth him like Hornets, Deuteronomy. 7.20. but when he does
well, it allows him: and that which we call conscience, the Syriack calls
it Tira, (...) Conscientiaa (...) formavit, pinxit.
Romans 2.15. Which signifies a painted thing, for the conscience now is like a
table, in which sundry things are painted; and this sort of writing in the
consciences, has not been unfitly compared to that writing, which we write
with the juice of an Onion; Simile.
here the letters at the first are not legible, but hold the paper to the fire,
and that makes the letters legible: So these evil deeds, which sink first
into the conscience, and are not legible, yet when the conscience is put to the
fire of Gods wrath, then they begin to appear legible, and then the Lord
sets their sins in order before them, Psalm. 50.21. The second act of the
conscience is to bind or loose; for even as a man, when he is bound hand and
foot, he cannot stir out of the place; so the light which is in the
conscience, binds the will of man, so to do a thing; that he cannot do any
other thing unless he sin against it. Romans 14.23. Whatsoever is not of faith
is sin, that is, whatsoever he does against his conscience, in that, he
sins.

Conscientia recta. Conscientia erronea. Conscientia dubia. Conscientia
probabilis. Conscientia scrupulosa.

This conscience is either a good conscience, a bad conscience; a doubting
conscience, a probable conscience, or a scrupulous conscience.

A good conscience is that, which is well informed, and concludes rightly.

A bad conscience is that, which is wrongly informed, and concludes falsely.

A doubtful conscience is that, which neither does assent nor dissent, and
therefore concludes nothing.

A probable conscience is that, which concludes as it thinks, upon probable
and good reasons.

And a scrupulous conscience is that, which concludes, but with some fear or
doubting, which troubles the mind. Let us take but this one example for all
in the case of eating of meat: A difference between these sorts of conscience.
The good conscience says, To the pure all things are pure, and therefore I
may eat of this meat: the bad conscience of the Jew says, Touch not, taste
not, handle not; therefore I will eat none of this, because it is unclean.
The doubtful conscience doubts whether he may eat of it, Romans 14.23. but
does not fully conclude with the Jew, that he may not eat of it. The probable
conscience is this, which upon probable grounds, concludes to eat of it. In
Corinth some doubted whether they might eat of flesh sold in the Shambles, 1
Cor. 10. because perhaps they might light upon that in the Market, whereof the
other part was sacrificed to Idols; but the probable conscience concludes to
eat of it, because in the Shambles it has no relation to the Idol, and it
knows, by all probability, that the rest of it was not sacrificed to Idols,
but that the Priest got the rest for his portion; he sees others who are men
of a good conscience, eat of such; and upon these probable grounds he eats
of it. The scrupulous conscience is this which inclines to eat, but with
fear and grief to his mind, when he eats it.

The light in the conscience since the fall makes not up this good conscience,
The light of nature since the fall makes not up a good conscience.
but it makes this ill conscience, and it troubles the scrupulous conscience,
and this doubtful conscience.

When the bad conscience excuses or accuses falsely.
This bad conscience it excuses or accuses: it excuses an unregenerat man
falsely, when he hears the curses of the Law, and blesses himself in the
meanetime, Deuteronomy. 29.19. Ioh. 16.2. Secondly, it excuses him falsely, when he
assenteth to the principles in general; but when he comes to the particular
application; he concludes not rightly. When the Husbandmen killed the Lord of
the Vineyard, Christ asked of the Jews, what should become of these
Husbandmen? Matthew. 21.41. they answered, he will destroy these wicked men: but
Luke 20.16. when they consider this, that the matter touched them more nearely,
then they said God forebid. The thing which they assented to in the general,
they shune it in particular, as if they should say, we are no such men, and we
hope that God will not so deal with us. So when it accuses for the breach of
any superstitious ceremony, as it did the superstitious Philistims; if they
did but tread upon the Threshold of the Door, where Dagon break his neck, 1 Samuel 4.5. So a bad conscience accuses a man truly sometimes, as Eccles. 7.22.
for oftentimes also, thine own heart knows that thou thy self have cursed
others.

The conscience is Gods herald.
The conscience binds as the Lords deputy; the conscience may be compared to
the Kings Herald. The Herald intimates to the Subjects the Kings laws; When
they are intimated, the Subjects are bound to obedience: but if the Herald
should make intimation, of that which were not the Kings Law, unto the
Subjects; yet they are to give obedience to it, until they know the contrary:
so a man is bound to obey his conscience, that is, to do nothing contrary to
it, although it intimate a falsehood unto him.

which is evil; it being Gods Deputy, and God can bind no man to do evil?

It binds him not simply to do the evil,

When a good conscience does bind a man,

A good conscience binds a man for ever,

So out of these principles naturally bred in the heart, A difference between
the law of nature and the laws of nations.
arise all these laws which are written in the heart; and they differ from the
laws of nations, or municipall laws of countries. Esaias 24.5. says, they have
transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances and broken the everlasting
covenant: they have transgressed the Laws, that is, the municipall Laws of
the commonwealth: they have changed the ordinances: that is, these things
wherein all nations agree; as not to do wrong to strangers, to ambassadors
and such: A greater sin to break the law of nature than the law of nations.
and then he comes to the greatest of all; they have broken the everlasting
covenant; that is, the law of nature: it is less to break a municipall law,
than the law of nations; or it is less to transgress the law of nations, than
to violate the Law of nature; for this Law is that: light which lightneth every
man, that comes into the world, Ioh. 1.9.

A man by this natural knowledge, Natural light cannot bring a man to the
knowledge of his own salvation.
cannot be brought to the knowledge of his salvattion; therefore the Law must
be written anew again in his heart. It is a strange position of Clemens
Alexandrinus, who holds that there was alia justitia secundum legem naturae,
alia secundum legem Mosis, Strom. cap. 6. 7.
et alia secundum Christum; and he calls these two first (...), or degrees
to lead to Christ; and as the Law led the Jews to Christ, so did philosophy
lead the Greeks; and hence he concludes, that the good men amongst the
Heathen were saved, or at least had some steps to salvation.



EXERCITAT. VI. Of the seven Precepts given to Noah.
Act. 15.20. We write unto them that they abstain from things strangled, and
from blood.
BEfore the Law was written, the Hebrews say, that the Lord gave to Noah seven
Precepts, which were delivered of Noah by tradition to his posterity after him;
(...)
these the Jews call pirke abhoth, capitula patrum, the traditions of the
fathers. The most ancient and first tradition that we read of, was that, Genesis
32.32. because Jacob halted upon his thigh, therefore the children of Israel
eat not of the sinew which shranke, which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto
this day; So were these seven precepts delivered by tradition.

The first was against strange worship or idolatry, 1 (...) 2 (...) 3 (...) 4
(...) 5 (...) 6 (...) 7 (...)
that they should not worship false gods; and this they called gnabhuda zar^,
strange worship. The second they called it gnal birkath hashem, that is, they
should bless the name of God. The third was gnal shepukoth dammim, that is, he
was forbidden to shed innocent blood. The fourth was gnalui gniria, that is, he
should not defile himself with filthy lusts. The fifth was gnad hagazael, de
rapina; that he should take nothing by violence or theft. The sixth was, gnal
hadinim de judiciis. The seventh was, abhar min achai, ne menbrum de vivo; that
he should not pull a member from a living creature, and eat of it. This
precept they say, was given last to Noah, Genesis 9.4. but the flesh with the life
thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat: that is, How this
precept of Noah not to eat blood is to be understood.
(as the Jews interpret it) ye shall not pull a member from a living
creature, and eat of it, as the wild beast does; but to stay until the beast
be killed, and then eat the flesh thereof: neither shall ye eat the blood
while it is hot, as if it were yet in the body: this is cruelty, and against a
moral precept; to eat hot blood while the life is in it; Where the reason of
the Law is perpetual, the Law is perpetual.
for where the reason of the Law is perpetual, the Law must be perpetual. The
reason of the Law is; ye shall not eat blood because the life is in it; so
long as the life is in it, ye must not eat it: and see how this sin, Ezekiel.
33.35. is matched with other great sins. Ye eat with the blood, and lift up
your eyes toward your Idols, and shed blood, and shall ye possess the land?
The moral transgressions of the Law joined with it here, shows that it is
cruelty to eat hot blood. But Levit. 7.27. was the ceremonial part of the
Law: and the Apostles in the council, Act. 15. forbids them to eat any
thing that was strangled; whereby they meant the ceremonial part of the Law.



Act. 15. See Beza, Act. 15.
It is the same that is forbidden in the fourth precept given to Noah, not
revelare turpitudinem, and to interpret here, fornication, for eating of things
sacrificed to Idols, seems to be a strained sense: for that is forbidden
already by the first precept, to Noah. And to uncover the nakedness according
to the phrase of the Scripture, is meant of bodily pollution and not of
spiritual fornication.

Of eating of blood, see more in the appendix of Command. 6.
Now besides these morrall precepts set down by the council, they interlace
this ceremonial precept de suffocato, forbidding to eat things strangled; and
they give the reason wherefore the Gentiles should abstain from these, Act.
15.21. For Moses is read in their Synagogues every Sabbath, Why the Apostles
forbid to eat blood or things strangled.
as if James should say, they profess not only the morrall Law, but also the
ceremonial Law yet; therefore ye Gentiles shall do well to abstain, from
these things which may give them offense. The Jews respected these precepts
most, because they were kept in the Church even from Noah's days.

The Hebrews add further; that there was no other precept given until
Abraham's days; then God added the precept of circumcision, and afterward
taught them to separate tithes.

God at the beginning taught his Church by tradition and not by write.
The Lord taught his Church in her infancy this ways by traditions, and not be
write: and even as parents teach their children the first elements by word,
Simile.
and afterward by write; so the Lord taught his Church first by word, and then
by write.

Church without his word to direct her: before the fall, he spoke immediately to
Adam and Eve, and taught them. In the second period, he taught them by these
seven precepts. In the third period, by the Law written, and in the fourth
period by the Gospel.

EXERCITAT. VII. Of the diverse ways how God revealed himself extraordinarily
to his Church.
Heb. 1.1. God who at sundry times, and in diverse manners spoke in times past
unto the Fathers by the Prophets.
GOd manifested himself to his Church; God revealed himself to his Church
four ways.
first by prophecy, secondly, by the holy Spirit, thirdly by Vrim and Thummim,
and fourthly by the poole Bethesda.

First by prophecy. Sundry sorts of prophecy. (...)
There were sundry sorts of prophecy: the first was lepi face to face, to
Moses only.

This sort of prophecy was the highest degree of revelation; and it drew
nearest to that sort of vision, which we shall get of God in the heavens. He
manifested himself to Moses face to face, How the Lord manifested himself to
Moses.
and he knew him by his name, that is, not only by the face, as Princes know
many of their Subjects; but he knew him inwardly, and liked him: this was
notitia approbationis.

Moses saw God face to face, yet he saw not the essence of God, for he
dwells in a light inaccessable. John saw Christ (...).
John saw God three manner of ways. First, in his incarnation, he saw God
dwelling amongst men in the flesh here. Secondly, in his transfiguration upon
the Mount. Thirdly, in the Spirit upon the Lords day, Rev. 1.10. Although John
lay in the bosom of Christ and was his beloved Disciple, yet he says, No man
has seen God at any time: the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of
the Father he has declared him. Ioh. 1.18.

Differences betwixt the revelations made to Moses, and to the rest of the
Prophets.
When God spoke to Moses, he spoke to his underderstanding immediately. A man
has a right ear, and a left ear; the understanding is like the right ear
and the fantasy is like the left ear: he spoke to Moses right ear, to his
understanding: but when he spoke to the rest of the Prophets, by some shapes
and visible forms; he spoke first to their left ear. Moses saw no visible
shapes nor forms, except only in the entry of his calling, when he saw the
bush burning, Exodus 3.6. and the Angel coming to kill him in the Inn, Exodus
4.24. and when he saw the pattern of the Tabernacle in the Mount, Heb. 9. but
usually God manifested himself to his understanding.

Dan. 8.27. and I Daniel fainted and was sick certain days, and I was
astonished at the visions. So Ezekiel fell upon his face when the Lord revealed
himself unto him. Chap. 3.27. But Moses was never affrayd at the sight of God
but thrice. First when he was to enter in his calling when he saw the bush
burning. Exodus 3.2. Secondly, at the giving of the Law, Heb. 12.21. Thirdly, in
the Inn.

Moses needed not such preparations before he prophesied, as some of the other
Prophets did. Elisha before he prophesied, called for a Minstrell to settle his
passions; that he might be the more fit to receive his prophecy. 2 King. 3.15.
But Moses needed not such a preperation. So Paul when he was ravished to the
third heaven, this knowledge which he got, was intellectual, and it was
neither by the sight, nor by the fantasy: and whether the soul was in the
body here tanquam in organo, vel tanquam in sede only, See Iunius de
purgatory.
it may be doubted.

The second sort of prophecy, was by vision; as when Moses saw the bush
burning, this was presented to him when he awas awake; this was the meanest
sort of revelation, (...).

The third sort was (...), Visio (...). Visio (...)

when something was presented to their fantasy in a dream.

These visions which he show to the Prophets, sometimes they were of things
which really existed; as Zachary saw Iosuah the high Priest, and Satan
standing at his right hand. Zach. 3. Sometimes of things that might be and was
not: as Zachary saw two women carrying an Ephath, Zach. 5.5. and sometimes of
things that were not, nor never could be: as the monstrous beasts shown to
Daniel, and to John in the revelation.

When the Lord revealed himself to the Prophets in these visions: The Lord
appeared to his Prophets, sometimes immediately, and sometimes by an Angel.
sometimes he spoke mediatly to them by an Angel. As Exodus 3.2. God is said
there to appear to Moses; but Act. 7.30. an Angel is said to appear in the
burning bush. Sometimes again in these apparitions, he immediately appeared to
the Prophets. Ioh. 12.40. He blinded their eyes, etc. these things he said
when he saw his glory, that is, when he saw Christ's glory.

When the Angels did appear to the Prophets in these visions, they appeared in
the shapes of men, The Angels ever appeared in the likeness of men, but not in
the likeness of women or beasts
but they never appeared in the likeness of women, far less in the
likeness of beasts, as the Devil does: therefore Levit. 17.7. they shall no
more offer their sacrifices unto Devils, in the Hebrew it is, leshegnirem, (...)
to the hoarie ones; because the Devil appeared in these shapes. When the
Cherubims appeared they carry the face of a man, the crest of a Lion, the feet
of the Ox, and the wings of an Eagle; they had not four faces (as some
think) but in something they represented man, in someting the Lion, in
something the Ox, and in something the Eagle: (...)
panim here should be translated, (...).

When the Angels appeared in the likeness of man, they were more glorious than
any man.
When the Angels appeared to the Prophets, there was more glory in them, then in
other men; although sometimes they concealed this glory for a while, as may be
seen Genesis 18. comparing it with Heb. 13.2. When Paul saw an Angel standing by
him in the likeness of a man of Mecadonia; there was more glory in him, than
in all the men of Mecadonia, Act. 6.9, Because the glory of an Angel did shine
in him: and in this sense it is said, Act. 6.15. that they saw the face of
Steven as it had been the face of an Angel, that is, his face did shine above
the face of mortal men, as when the Angels appeared in humane shape. But when
the Lord appeared in the likeness of a man, then his glory far exceeded the
glory of an Angel, When the Lord appeared in the likeness of man, he exceeded
the glory of an Angel.
Esa. 6.1. I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne. First, he was set upon a high
throne. Secondly, his clothes reached down to the ground, which signifies
his glory: the hemme of his garment touched the ground, which signyfied the
humanity of Christ: and the Seraphims covering their faces, because they could
not behold the glory of God. And when the Lord appeared in these visions, he
appeared in the likeness of an old man: as Daniel saw the Ancient of days
sitting upon a throne, Dan. 7.9. and Reve. 1.14. when the Son of God
appeared, his hair was white as wool, and white as Snow: but the Angels of
the Lord appeared in the likeness of young men, Mark. 16.5. and the Cherubims
were made like young men.



Exekiel saw the most excellent visions. Ezekiels visions for the most part
were of Christ: and the spiritual Temple. Answ.
Esaias saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, Esa. 6.1. but this was a vision of
judgment, to make fat the hearts of the people: but the visions of Ezekiel for
the most part were of Christ and the building of the spiritual Temple. These
visions were so high, that the Jews forbad any to read them ante annum
sacerdotalem, that is, before they were thirty years of age.

Whether were the revelations by visions,

Thomas answers;

It is generally to be observed here; The Prophets understood these things
which they phophecied.
that in all these sorts of visions, and apparitions, they understood that
which they prophesied: and therefore the Prophets were called videntes, Seers,
Job. 13.1. mine eyes has seen all these things, mine ears has heard them,
and I understand them all. Pharaoh did not understand these things which he
saw; therefore he was not a Prophet: So Belthasser when he saw fingers writing
upon the wall, he under- not that which he saw, and therefore he was not a
Prophet: and so Caiphas understood not what he prophesied. Ioh. 11. They were
like unto men who are purblind and see not a thing distinctly: and therefore
desires others to tell them more distinctly what it is. The Jews say of these,
that they were (...) non (...), that is, (...)
they were stirred up by God, but they sought not the Lord. And of Balaam they
say, prophetavit ex voluntate Dei, sed non cepit quod prophetavit. Daniel at
the first understood not the prophecy, but the Angel revealed it unto him,
Dan. 8.17.

So the Lord appeared to them in Dreams as he did before to them when they
were awake, and sometimes these dreams were (...), dreams in which they saw
some shapes and visions; as Jacob saw a ladder in his dream: so Abraham in his
dream, saw the Carkases, and fowls lighting upon them. Genesis 15.8. Daniel saw
the four monarchies, represented be four visible shapes, Dan. 4. and
sometimes he revealed himself sine symbolo, without any visible shape; as to
Joseph, Matt. 2. and to the wise men, Mat. 2.12.

(...)
The Lord was only author of these dreams, therefore. Genesis 37.7. when Joseph
is called bagnal chalamoth, it is not well translated Lord of dreams, for God
himself is only Lord of dreams. The Seventie translate it (...), (...).
infomniator, and it signifies not simple a dreamer but him who dreameth
often, therefore chalamoth is in the plural number. If the Lord revealed
himself in the forepart of the night as he did to Abraham, then it was called
Tardema, a dead sleep, 1 Samuel 26. (...)
cecidit sopor domini super eos id est magnus. But if in the latter part of the
night, then it was called chalam, a dream. To some he revealed himself in a
dream, but he gave then not the interpretation of it, as to the Butler and
Baker. Some had the interpretation of the dream, but not the dream, as
Joseph. Nebuchodnezzer had the dream, but Daniel the interpretation of it, but
the Prophets of God: had both the dream and the interpretation of it, as
Daniel. The heathen sometimes had both the dream and the interpretation, The
Prophets had the dreams with the interpretations of them.
as the Midianites had of the Barley cake. Iud. 7. but this was for their
destruction: but the comfortable dreams and visions, with their
interpretations; were only revealed to the Prophets, for the good of the
Church.



Intensive the revelation by vision was the more excellent, Revelatio
intensiva. Revelatio extensiva.

but extensive the revelation by dreams was the more excellent, and that by
vision came nearest to that which was intellectual, for they had no use of
their senses in it, and the visions were presented to their understanding only.
When we take up a thing by sense; Somethings are presented to the sense,
somethings to the fantasy, and some things to the understanding.
first the sense transmiteth it to the fantasy, and then the fantasy
sends it to the understanding; this is the most imperfect sort of knowledge.
Secondly, when the vision is presented to the fantasy only, and the
fantasy sends it to the understanding, this is more perfect then the
former. And thirdly, when the vision is presented to the understanding only,
this is a higher degree.

In the Knowledge which they got by dreams, first, they had the dream, and
when they were awake they got the understanding of it: but in a vision they
presently understood the thing presented unto them. Because the revelation by
vision was the more perfect sort of knowledge, therefore Joel says your young
men shall see visions, and then he added, your old men shall dream dreams, as
the more imperfect sort of revelation, Joel. 2.28.



The reasons why God revealed himself by dreams.
First these things which we begin to think upon when we are awake we begin to
try them by reason, and if reason approve them not then we reject them, but in
a dream the mind receiveththings not examining them by reason. In matters
Divine the less that reason have a hand in admitting of them the better it is,
and here it was better for the Prophets to be ruled by God, and fitter for them
to be scholars then judges.

dreams was this, to let them see how far his power exceeded the power of
man; for masters cannot teach scholars; but when they are awake and giving
heed: but God can teach his Prophets in a deep sleep and in a dream: which
gave the Prophets to understand what great commandment, the Lord had over all
the faculties of their minds.



(...) How the Lord revealed himself to his Prophets by the holy Spirit.
The third way, how the Lord revealed himself to his Prophets; was by ruah
hakkodesh, by the holy spirit: then the Prophets had all the use of their
senses; hearing one speaking to them, as we do every one another, and seeing,
etc. and the more use that they have of their senses, Drusius in Pentateuchum.
the more unperfect was their revelation. Others distinguish this sort of
revelation which was by the holy Spirit, from that which was properly called
prophecy: they say these who spoke by the holy spirit, and were Prophets in
that sense, they were not called to attend still as Prophets; such as was David
a King; and Daniel a Courtiour: But Esaias and Jeremy were Prophets properly so
called: because they waited still, and attended in the school of the Prophets.

(...)
The fourth way, how God revealed himself, was by vrim and thummim, (...)
and they are always joined together except in two places of the Scripture,
What sort of revelation was by Vrim and Thummim.
Exodus 17.21. and 1 Samuel 28.8. This was a different kind of revelation from the
former: for by this the Priest did not prophecy, neither made songues to the
praise of God: but having put on this breastplate, it was a sign to him that
God would answer these doubts, (...)
which he asked of him, and it is called the Brestplate of judgment, mishpat
signifies, either the administration of public judgments, Esa. 41.3. or
private affairs, Pro. 13.23. est qui absumitur absqe judicio, that is: because
his family is not rightly administrat. It is called then the breastplate of
judgment: because the Lord taught his people in their doubtful cases; what to
do, The breastplate and the Vrim and Thumim are distinguished.
by this vrim and thummim.

Exodus 28.30. Thou shall put in the breastplate Vrim and Thummim. Some hold
that the twelve precious stones set in the brestplate, were called vrim and
thummim: as Kimchi; but the Text makes against that: for the breastplate, and
the vrim and the thummim are distinguished verse. 30. Some of the Jews again
incline most to this sense; that these two words vrim and Thummim were set in
the breastplate as holiness to the Lord was written in great letters upon a
plate of Gold, What this Vrim and Thummim were.
and set in the forehead of the highpriest. But it seems rather that they
were two precious stones given by the Lord himself, to be set in the
brestplate: and an Ancient Jew called Rabbi Bechai marketh, demonstrativum.
that these two are set down cum he demonstrativo for their excellency.
Neither says the Lord thou shall make vrim and thummim as he said of the rest
of the ornaments of the Highpriests, thou shall make this or that. The letters
did not make up the answer.


It is commonly holden that the letters did shine out of the breastplate of
Aaron, when the Lord gave his answers to him, that he might read the answer by
the letters: but this could not be, as may appear by the form of the
brestplate following.

The form of the Breast Plate.


When David asked of the Lord, 1 Samuel 23.12. will the men of Keila deliver me
and my men into the hands of Saul? (...)
the Lord said ysgiru, they will deliver thee: here the letters in the
brestplate would have made up this whole answer; Iod from Iehuda, Samech from
Joseph, Gimel from Gad, Iod from Levi, Resh from Reuben, and Vau from Reuben,
but Judges 20.8. when the Israelites asked counsel of the Lord, who shall go
up first to battle against Benjaman? it was answered, (...)
Iehuda Battechilla, Judah shall go up first, now there was not so many letters
in the brestplate to express this answer, for there wanted four letters of
the Alphabet in the brestplate (...). 2 Samuel 5.23. There wanted four letters
in the Breastplate.
when David enquired of the Lord, shall I go up against the Philistimes? the
Lord answered, Thou shall not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come
upon them over against the Mulberry trees. The letters in the brestplate could
not express all this, therefore it was not by the letters that the Lord
answered the Priest: but when he had on this brestplate, How the Lord taught
the Priest by Vrim and Thummim.
(...), or rationale upon him, then the Lord taught him what to answer; and
this brestplate was but a sign unto him, that the Lord would answer him, as
Sampsons hair was a sign unto him, that the Lord would continue his strength
with him as long as he kept his hair; how was the strength in Sampsons hair?
not as in the cause, or in the subject, but only as in the sign, so in the
Apostles garments and shadow; The Vrim and Thummim were a sign only that the
Lord would answer the Priest.
they were but a sign of their power which they had in healing miraculously;
and so was vrim and thummim but a sign of this, that the Lord would answer the
Priest.

The vrim and thummim were not always with the Arc; The Vrim and Thummim were
not ever with the Arc.
for all the time of Saul they asked not counsel of the Arc, 1 Chronicles. 13.3.
Let us bring again the Arc of our God unto us: for we enquired not at it, in
the days of Saul; they went usually to ask counsel in the Tabernacle and
Sanctuary of the Lord, Iud. 20. they went up to Silo, where the Tabernacle
was, to ask the Lord then the Arc was in the Tabernacle: but when the Arc
was separated from the Tabernacle, they might sacrifice in the Tabernacle. So
they might ask the Lord here by vrim and thummim although the Arc was not
there. When the Highpriest asked counsel for David, at Nob: the Arc was not
there nor the Tabernacle; but only vrim and thummim: but when the Arc and the
vrim and thummim were together, they always enquired the Lord before the Arc;
and when they were separated; they turned their faces toward the Arc,
wheresoever it was, when they asked counsel by the judgment of vrim and
thummim. When David was in Ziglag, 1 Samuel 30. he asked counsel of the Lord by
the Priest: but neither the Arc nor the Tabernacle was ever in Ziglag a town
of the Philistims.

They asked counsel of the Lord at the Arc by the High Priest.
When any are said, to ask counsel of the Lord, who were not Highpriests; as
the Israelites are said thrice to ask the Lord. Iud. 20.18. 1 Samuel 14.37. and
23.2. 1 Chronicles. 14. they are understood to have done this by the Highpriest, for
Number. 27.21. Joshua is commanded to ask counsel at the Lord, by Eleazer the
Highpriest.

How he stood who asked counsel by Vrim and Thummim.
The manner how he stood who asked counsel of the Lord by the Highpriest, He
shall stand before Eleazar the Priest, who shall ask counsel for him after
the judgment of Vrim before the Lord. Number. 27.21. he stood not directly before
the Highpriest, for then he should have stood betwixt him and the Arc:
therefore liphne should be translated juxta, (...)
a latere, or beside the Priest. He stood by the Highpriest when he asked
counsel, and he heard not what tht Lord said to the Priest; but the Priest
gave him his answer.

The Lord by Vrim and Thummim answered distinctly to every question.
When two things are demanded of the Lord, he answered in order to them. As 1 Samuel 23.9. will they come up? The Lord answered, they will come up. So he
answered to the second question, will they deliver me? They will deliver thee.

They asked not counsel of the Lord by Vrim and Thummim but in great and
weighty matters; They asked counsel by Vrim and Thummim only in matters of
weight.
as David after the death of Saul, 1 Samuel 2. So 2 Samuel 5. they asked the Lord,
for the King, for the common wealth or for a tribe, or for making of wars,
but in matters of less moment they asked not the Lord, by Vrim and Thummim: as
if any thing had been committed to ones custody, and it was lost; they did
not ask the Lord for it by Vrim and Thummim, but the oath of the Lord was
betwixt them, Exodus 22.11.

When they got their answers by Vrim and Thummim, God confirmed his answers
sometimes by lot.
the Lord confirmed their answers sometimes by lot. As 1 Samuel 10.8. he asked
first by Vrim and Thummim, who should be King? and then it was confirmed by
lot. So when Joshua divided the Land. First, he got his answer by Vrim and
Thummim, and then he bids them cast lots, and as their lots ascended, he
distributed unto them, Number. 26.55. When the Highpriest consulted, he stretched
out his hands unto the Ark of the Lord. 1 Samuel 14.19. collige manum tuam, draw
in thine hand.

The difference betwixt the predictions of the Prophets and the Priest, by Vrim
and Thummim was this. A difference between the predictions of the Priests by
Vrim and Thumim, and the predictions of the Prophets.
The Prophets when they foretold things, vt futura in seipsis, as to fall out
in themselves; then they always fell out: but when they foretold things as
they were in their causes, then they might fall out, or not fall out. Example,
Esaias says to Ezekias, set thy house in order for thou shall dye, and not live,
Esaias. 38.1. Prophesies as the respect the second causes and events.
looking to the second causes, and to Ezekias, he shall dye. But looking to the
event, he shall not dye. So 1 King. 21.20. The Lord threatened to bring a
judgment upon Achab, and yet upon his humiliation spared him. So the Lord
threatened Ninive, forty days and Ninive shall be destroyed, Jonah. 3.4. and
yet when they humbled themselves they were not destroyed. But that which was
revealed by the Highpriest, when he took on Vrim and Thummim, took always
effect.

Iud. 20.23. shall I go up to the battle against the children of Benjamin our
brother? The Lord answered, go up against him. And yet they were killed.

Benjamin; but he answered not to the success of the battle, because they
were not as yet humbled; and they trusted too much to their own strength. But
when Phineas demanded what they should do* verse. 28. when they were humbled:
they got a direct and more distinct answer: go up, for to morrow I will
deliver them into thine hand.

De pont. Romans lib. 4. 3.
Bellermine the Jesuit, that he may prove the infallibility of the Pope in
judgeing in matters of faith; alleges the Vrim and the Thummim, which were
upon the brestplate of the Highpriest; (...) a radice, (...) a false derivation.
which directed him that he could not err in judgment. But this reason is
faulty many ways. First, in the derivation of the names; (...) a radice,
(...) a false derivation to exclude the radical letter, for there is duplex
Mem, here and Aleph is excluded. (...).
for he deriveth Vrim from the root jara which signifies, to teach; whereas it
is derived from or to give light. So he deriveth thummim from the root Aman,
which signifies to believe; whereas it comes from tamam, to make a thing
perfect. The seventie translate th^se words, (...), as ye would say,
manifestatio and veritas. And so does Hierome. But this they do (...), and
they respect more the end here, wherefore they were put into the brestplate,
than their proper significations. For as Vrim properly signifies brightness,
and figuratively (...), because that which makes all things manifest is the
light, Ephesians. 5.13. and this Thummim properly signifies perfection; so
figuratively in things spiritual, it signifies verity. The Seventy looking to
the figurative signification, translate them this ways.

Secondly, put the case that Vrim and Thummim signified doctrine and verity,
yet it will not follow that the Highpriest might not err: for by these were
signified not what sort of men they were, but what sort of men they ought to
be. Prove. 16.10. A divine sentence is in the lips of the King, and his mouth
transgresses not in judgment. Here is a clearer place that the King of Spain
cannot err in judgment, than that the Pope cannot err in judgment; if ye
will take words as they stand. But the meaning of the words is, a divine
sentance ought to be in the lips of the King; and then his mouth will not
transgress in judgment. So these two are set in the brestplate of Aaron, to
teach him his duty: but they were not notes of his infallibility. And if by
Vrim, they would infer his infallibility in judgment: so by Thimmim, they
may infer his holiness of life: and so none of the Popes were profane and
wicked men.

Thirdly, this brestplate served not for a trial of his doctrine, but only
for foretelling of the doubtful events of things; for their doctrine was to be
tried by the law and by the testimony, Esa. 8.

Fourthly, The Highpriests might err.
if Vrim and Thummim signified verity and judgment, then it should follow,
that none of the Highpriests could err: but we know that Vrijah the
Highpriest in the time of Achaz, brought the pattern of the Altar of Damascus,
and placed it in Jerusalem. 2 King. 16.6. And Caaiphas erred, when he condemned
Christ to death.

Lastly, let this be granted, that the Highpriest under the law could not err;
therefore that either Peter or the Pope his successor (as they allege) could
not err, it will not follow. For this privilege, not to err, belongs to
none, but to Jesus Christ, of whom the Highpriest was a type; who had both Vrim
and Thummim, purity of doctrine and perfection of life.



How long the gift of prophecy endured under the old Testament.
The gift of prophecy endured under the old Testament until the time of the
Macedonian Empire. When Alexander the great did reign, Nehemiah makes mention
of one Iaddus the Highpriest, Neh. 12.7. who met Alexander, See Shinlerusin
(...)
when he came against Jerusalem. Now if there had been none, who were
infallibly directed by the Spirit of God at this time; who could have put this
into the canonical Scripture it being historical? therefore there behoved to
be one at this time, who had the spirit of prophecy, and was one of the
masters of the great Synagogue, who did this: and then the Sun went down
upon the Prophets. Micah. 3. and the gift of prophecy ceased.

The gift of Prophecy given under the new Testament.
Thse gift of prophecy was bestowed anew again, in the second Temple, under
the new Testament. Joel. 2. I will power out my spirit upon all flesh, and your
young men shall see visions, etc.

This gift lasted in the Church, till the second Temple was destroyed. The
Jews by a certain kind of Kabbala called gematrja, (...) a (...)
observe upon Hagg. 1.8. it is written there ekkabhda, I will be glorified,
because the word wants the letter in the end of it, which letter stands for
five; they say that the want of this, shows the want of five things in the
second Temple, which were in the first. The Arc, the mercy seat, and
Cherubims. Secondly, the fire from Heaven. Thirdly, the majesty of Divine
presence called shekena. Fourthly, the holy Ghost. And fifthly, Vrim and
Thummim. But this rabbinicall observation is most impious, The Jews
cabbalisticall observation blasphemous.
and serves to overthrow all the whole New Testament, to deny Jesus Christ,
and to condemn his Apostles and Evangelists; as though they had not the gift
of the holy Spirit when they wrote, during the time of the second Temple: and
this is contrary to the very scope of the Prophet, Hagg. 1.8. Go up into the
mountain, and bring wood to build this house, and I will take pleasure in it,
and I will be glorified says the Lord, and Hagg. 2.9. The glory of the latter
house shall be greater then the former, and in this place will I give peace
says the Lord.

Whether were the Arc, the Vrim and Thummim,

The Arc was not in the second Temple.
yet the second Temple wanted this typical Arc, the Vrim and Thummim, and the
fire; therefore it is but a fable of theirs, Josephus ant. lib. 14.
who say, that Titus after he had destroyed the second Temple, brought the Arc
to Rome in his triumphs; but the Arc was never seen in the second Temple;
and Josephus, who was an eye witness of Titus triumphs shows, that it was
only but the table of the shewbread which Titus carried away in his triumphs,
and is seen yet pictured there.

The Vrim and Thummim were not in the second Temple, but the graces signified
by them.

Nehem. 7.65. and Ezra. 2.63. That they should not eat of the most holy
things, until there stood up a Priest with Vrim and with Thummim.

The new Testament expresses things sometimes under types of the old Testament.
by figures and types which were under the Old Testament: so by Vrim and
Thummim which were in the first Temple; to express the perfection of the
Priests, which should be in the second Temple.

The last way, How the Lord revealed himself by the poole Bethesda.
how God revealed himself in the second Temple, was by the poole Bethesda:
when the Angel came down at certain times to stir the poole, then whosoever
after the first troubling of the water stepped in, he was cured of whatsoever
disease. Ioh. 5.4. It was not the Angel that cured them here: for it is a true
Axiom of the Schoolmen, An Angel cannot work a Miracle.
pars naturae non potest superare naturam, an Angel is but a part of nature,
therefore he cannot work a miracle, What Angel wrought this Miracle. (...)
which is above nature. It was Christ himself who wrought the miracle, it was
he who loosed the prisoners, Psalm. 146. Mattir, is so to loose the bound, that
they have use both of their hands and feet, to leap as freely as the
Grasshopper does, which has legs to leap upon the earth, Levit. 11.21. So
the diseased were loosed, that they might leap and go straight upon their
own feet. By Angel here some understand the power of God, who uses his
Angels, as his ministers to work many things below here; and therefore the
Seventy put God in place of the Angel, as Eccles. 5.6. Say not before the
Angel, that it was an error. But the Seventy translate it (...), for the
Chaldes use to ascribe the work of God to his ministers, the Angels. But it is
better to ascribe this miracle here, to the Angel of the covenant Jesus
Christ. Tertullian says, that the operation of the fish-poole being now to
cease and to loose the virtue of it, our Savior curing him who had been long
diseased, being at the poole, gave thereby an entrance to all sick persons to
come unto him: as if he should have said, he that desires to be whole; let him
not come to the poole, or expect the coming down of the Angel: for when he
comes, he heals but one; but come unto me, and I shall heal you all.

He that despised Moses law, Heb. 10.28. dyed without mercy, under two or
three witnesses, of how much sorer punishment shall we be thought worthy of, if
we tread under foot the Son of God.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Of the necessity of the Word written.
Ioh. 20.31. But these are written that ye might believe.
GOd thought it necessary, after that he had taught his Church by Word; next to
teach her by write. There is a twofold necessity. The first is called an
absolute necessity: the second, of expedience. Again, Necessitas absoluta
Necessitas expedientia

Gods revealed will was necessary to all men, as a cause; but his written word
was necessary as an isntrumental cause; and this word is considered either
essentially, Scriptura est necessaria (...) verbum (...). The word considered
essentially or accidentally. Simile.
or accidentally. Essentially for the written word: this written, and unwritten
word, differ only as a man naked, and clothed; for there is no change in the
nature and substance here. And that we may the better underderstand the
necessity of the writing of the word, we must distinguish here the states of
the Church. First, The estate of the Church considered three ways.
she was in a family or oeconomike. Secondly, she was National, dispersed
through the country of the Jews. Thirdly, she was Ecomenicall or Catholic,
dispersed through the whole world. So long as she was in a family, and the
Patriarchs lived long, to record to the posterity, the word and the works of
God; then God taught his Church by his word unwritten. But when his Church
began to be enlarged, first through Judea, and then through the whole world,
then he would have his word set down in write; Why God would have his word
written.
because then the Fathers were not of so long a life, to record to the
posterity, the word and the works of God. Again he did this to obviat the
craft of the Devil, and the counterfeite writings of the false Apostles.

God reveals himself most surely to us by his word.
It was necessary then, that the word should be written, that the Church might
have a greater certainety of their salvation. See how far the Lord commends
unto us, the certainety which we have by the Scriptures; above all other sort
of revelation. 2 Pet. 1.19. (...).
We have also a more sure word of prophecy: here the certainety of the
Scriptures, is preferred to the transfiguration in the mount. Secondly, the
Apostle Gal. 1.8. prefers it to the revelation made by Angels, If an Angel
should come from heaven and teach any other Gospel, let him be accursed.
Thirdly, Christ himself preferred the certainety of it to Moses and the
Prophets. If one should come from the dead and teach us. Luke 16.31.

The Church is not the last resolution of our faith.
The Church of Rome then does great wrong to Christians; when they would make
the last ground and stay of Christian faith, to be the Church only; But we
are built upon the foundation of the Prophets, and Apostles, Ephe. 2.20. the
Lord when he dwelt between the Cherubims, he set the Candlestick upon his
right hand, and the table with the shewbread upon his left hand: to teach us,
that the Scriptures are to be preferred still to the testimony of the Church;
and that we must rest upon their testimony primario.



Somethings de fide and de verbo fidej, somethings de verbo fidej, but not de
fide primario, somethings neither de fide neither de verbo fidej.
Some things are both de fide, and de verbo fidei; as Christ is Emmanuel.
Secondly, somethings are de verbo fidei but not de fide primario; as Paul left
his cloak at Troas. Thirdly, somethings are de fide, but non de verbo fidei,
which are the conclusions drawn from the canonical word by consequence. And
these are either drawn from the word generally; as this, that the Scriptures
are the word of God. for this is evident from the whole word generally, and
although this be a principle in it self, which ought first to be believed; yet
in my conception, and manner of taking up, it is a conclusion arising from that
majesty and Divine character which is in the word it self, or the particular
conclusions drawn from the word. They are de fide, non de verbo fidei, as when
a man concludes, his own particular justification from the word; as I James
am justified, est de fide mea, and not a part of the canonical word, but an
application arising from it. Fourthly, something are neither de fides nor de
verbo fidei.

Secondly, we may answer to this: whether the word written be an article of our
faith or not. Articles of our faith, taken generally or specially.
The articles of our faith are either taken generally, or specially: generally,
for all that is contained in the Scriptures, or may be deduced by way of
consequence from the Scriptures: then it is not an article of our faith, to
believe the canon of the Scriptures. Secondly, specially for that which is
contained in the Creed; for the Creed is the substance of that which is
contained in the Scriptures; and then it is an article of our faith to believe
the Cannon of the Scriptures.

The Scriptures of God, are considered essentially, The Scriptures considered
essentially or accidentally.
or accidentally. Essentially, as they proceed from God; accidentally again,
as they were written by such and such men. As they proceed from God, we must
believe them to be true, and to be the means of our salvation; for saving
truth is only from God. But if we consider them but accidentally, as they are
written by such and such men, then it is not an article of our faith to believe
them; for it makes not to our salvation primario, to know that they were
written by such and such men.

When the books in holy Scripture, carry the names of those who wrote them; as
the books of Moses carry his name; if a man should deny these books to be
written by Moses, and then be ignorant altogether of the matter contained in
them; then his ignorance were damnable, Ignorantia damnabilis negatio
haeretical.
and the denial of them heretical; they have Moses and the Prophets, Luke 16.

But if the writer of the book be not set down in the Scripture; if a man
should deny such a man to write it, he should not be reputed as an heretic
for that; Negatia est haeretica per accidens sed ignoratio non est damnabilis.
and to be ignorant that such a man wrote it, this were not damnable ignorance.
Example, it is holden that Paul wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews; now if a man
should deny that Paul wrote this Epistle, he were not to be holden a heretic
for that, neither were his ignorance damnable. A man may be ignorant of this or
that book, and yet be saved, and many were saved before the books were
written, and now many are saved who cannot read the Scriptures.

Ignorantia hic est infirmitatis and negatio est haeritica per accidens.
But when a man doubts of the order and number of the books in the Canon,
this argues but his unskilfulnesse and infirmity, and the denial of the
number and order of these books, is but heretical by accident, and the
ignorance is not damnable.





Conclusi.
The conclusion of this is. Seeing God has revealed his will in his word
written to us, and remitted us always to the law and to the testimony, Esaias
10.8. Ioh. 5.49. search the Scriptures: therefore these who leave the
Scriptures, and make choice of traditions; they forsake the fountain of living
water, and dig Cisternes to themselves that cannot hold no water, Ier. 2.13.

EXERCITAT. IX. Of the singular prerogatives which the secretaries of the holy
Ghost had, who wrote the Scriptures.
2 Pet. 1.21. And the holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy
Ghost.
Gal. 1.12. for the Gospel which I preached, I received it not of man, neither
was I taught but by the revelation of Jesus Christ, they had not their calling
from man, but immediately from God. They had their calling intuitu Ecclesiae,
Vocatio vel est intuitu ecclesiae. intervetu eccles.

1 Cor. 3.2. sed non interventu Ecclesiae: that is, God ordained these offices
for the good of the Church, and it was for the Church cause that he appointed
them; but they had not their calling from the Church. But Preachers now have
their calling both intuitu Ecclesiae, and interventu Ecclesiae. Immediata
suppositi virtutis.

There is immedietas ratione suppositi and immedietas ratione virtutis: the
first is, when the person is immediately separated by God to such a calling; the
second is, when the graces and calling, are immediately given by God When
Ministers are called, they have their gifts immediately from God, and so they
have their calling; there interveneth no suppositum, or midst between God and
them: but for the appointing and designing of them to such places; that they
have from the Church. But the Apostles were called immediately, both ratione
suppositi and virtutis; they had their gifts immediately from God, neither were
they designed to such and such plaees as the Ministers are now.

The Prophets and Apostles were immediately called by God, and therefore
Matthias was chosen by lot to be an Apostle, because the lot is immediately
directed by the hand of God; but Preachers now should not be chosen by lot.
Zeno the Emperor tempted God in this case, laying a paper upon the Altar, that
God might write in the paper the name of him, who should be Bishop of
Constantinople: Nicepherus, Lib. 2.
but Flavitius corrupting the Sexton of the Church, caused him to write in his
name, and so was made Bishop of Constantinople.

Moses learned from the Egyptians, and Daniel from the Chaldeans: therefore it
may seem that they had not their calling immediately from God.

The Apostles and Prophets learned their humane Sciences and Arts from men but
not their divine knowledge.
They had the learning of humane sciences and trades from men; as Paul learned
from men to be a Tent maker: so Moses learned these humane sciences from the
Egyptians, and Daniel from the Chaldeans; but their knowledge, as Prophets and
Apostles imediatly was from God. Although they had their divine knowledge
immediately from God, Simile. The Prophets knowledge was kept by reading. Dan.
2.9. and 1 Timothy 4.13.
yet they were to entertain it by reading, As the fire, that came from heaven
upon the Altar was miraculous; yet when it was once kindled, they kept it in
with wood, as we do our fire: So the Prophets knowledge was preserved by
reading, as ours is.

The measure of the Prophets and Apostles knowledge.
Their knowledge far differed from the knowledge of Christ; this was visio
vnionis, and this excelled the knowledge of all creatures, even of the Angels:
this was not called prophecy, as he was comprehensor; but as he was viator
here upon the earth, this his illumination is called Prophecy; he is called
the great Prophet, Deuteronomy. 18.15. and in this sort of knowledge he excelled both
men and Angels. Secondly, their knowledge differed from the knowledge of
Angels, and the glorified Spirits: for prophecy as Peter says, Visio vnionis
gloria raptus prophetiae

2 Pet. 1.19. is like a light shining in a dark place, but in Heaven there is
no darkness.

Thirdly, their knowledge differed from the knowledge that Paul had, when he
was taken up to the third heaven; and this was called visio raptus: their
knowledge was far inferior to all these sorts of knowledge; but it far
exceeded all the knowledge that we have.

The Prophets had not the gift of prophecy by habit.


Bezaliell and Aholiab, although they had their knowledge immediately from God,
to work all curious works in the Tabernacle; yet they kept still this their
knowledge as an ordinary habit; but this gift of prophecy, the Prophets had it
not as a habit, but they had need still of new illumination when they
prophesied. Peter compares prophecy to a light shining in a dark place, 2
Pet. 1.19. how long continues light in a dark house? no longer then a candle
is there: so this coruscation, Simile.
or glimpse of the Spirit, continued no longer with them; but when the Spirit
was illuminating them, and teaching them: they had the gift of prophecy even
as they had the gift of healing; but they could not heal when and where they
pleased. Paul says, I have left Trophimus sick at Miletum, 2 Timothy 4 20. So
they could not prophecy when and where they pleased, 2 King. 4.27. The Lord
has hid it from me and has not told it me, they had not this prophecy as a
permanent habit; but as that, which was now and then revealed unto them. Ier.
42.7. And it came to pass after ten days; here the Prophets behoved to
attend, until he got a new revelation from the Lord; and sometimes they waited
longer, and sometimes shorter for this revelation.



Number. 17. It is said of those Prophets, Prophetia momentanea.
prophetarunt and non addiderunt, that is, they prophesied but that day only,
that the Spirit came upon them, but never after; as the Hebrews expound it: but
the Prophets of the Lord, prophesied often. So 2 King. 2.3. The children of the
Prophets came forth: they prophesied, but this gift of the prophecy continued
not with them: but these Prophets of the Lord, often prophesied: And although
they had not the habit of prophecy, yet they were separate by God for that
purpose, to expect still for new illumination.

(...).
was this, that they could not err in their writing, 2 Pet. 1.21. The holy men
of God spoke as they were inspired by the holy Ghost, The Peophets erred not in
writing the Scriptures.
Matthew. 10:2. Luke 21.15. Luke 1.17. therefore the Prophets were called, the
mouth of God, Luke 1.18. Ier. 15.19. thou shall be as my mouth. He spoke not
only by their mouths, The Prophets are called the mouth of God.
but also they were his mouth. And contrary to this is that lieing Spirit in
the mouth of the false Prophets. 1 King. 22.22.

The secretaries of the holy Ghost, erred sometimes in some of their purposes,
Wherein the Prophets and Apostles erred.
and in some circumstances of their calling; but in the doctrine it self they
never erred. Peter in the transfiguration, knew not what he said, Luke 9.33.
David was minded to build an house to God, he asked of Nathan if he should do
so, 1 Chro. 17.2. Nathan said to him; do what is in thine heart. So when Eliab
stood before Samuel, 1 Samuel 16.6. Samuel said: surely the Lords anointed i^
before me. So the Disciples erred in their counsel, which they gave to Paul,
forbidding him to go up to Jerusalem, Act. 21.4. But the spirit of God, taught
the contrary by Agabus, verse. 17. David Psalm. 116. said in his have, that all
men are liars: he meant, that Samuel the man of God had made a lie to him;
because he thought the promise too long differred in getting of the kingdom.
So when he wrote a letter to Ioab with vriah, in this he was not Gods
secretary, but the Devils. But as they were the secretaries of God, and spoke
by divine inspiration, they could not err.

But it may seem, Paul wrote that he would come to Spain, Romans 15.24. and yet
he never came to Spain.

We must distinguish between their purposes external, and their doctrine: yea
and Amen, 2 Cor. 1.20. He wrote that he was purposed to come to Spain, and so
he was; but he was let, that he could not come.

But Paul repented that he wrote the Epistle to the Corinthians to grieve them,
Cor. 7.8. If this was written by the inspiration of the holy Ghost, why did he
repent of it?

Paul wrote this Epistle to humble them, comes to cure a wounded man, Simile.
he puts the poor patient to great pain, and makes him to cry out, that
grieveth him; but it greeveth him not when he cures him: So it repented not
Paul, that he had written to the Corinthians; but it repented him to see them
so swallowed up with grief.

Iud. 16.17. there were about three thousand upon the roof of the house. So
Act. 2.40. and that day there were added to the Church, about three thousand
souls. Is not the number of all things, certainly known to God?



Peter erred in a matter of faith, Gal. 2.14.

Wherein Peter erred.
The error was not in the substance, but in the circumstance of the fact: and
where it is said, Gal. 2.14. That Peter walked not uprightly, according to the
Gospel; it is to be understood only of his conversation; he erred here only,
in this principle of Christian Religion; not walking according to his
knowledge, but he erred not in his writing.



The Apostles considered two manner of ways.
and so they might err; and they pray as other men, Lord forgive us our
sins. Secondly, they are considered according to their functions and
immediate calling; and then they were above the Church, and could not err.

Nathan to be sent to David to attend him continually, one Prophet to another?

of a Prophet to admonish him: for Kings stand in slippery places, and have
need of others to advertise them.

The Prophets, as they were Prophets, could not err; therefore, that
collection of the Jews, is most impious: they say that David wished to the
sons of Ioab four things, 2 Samuel 3.29. First that some of them might dye by
the sword. Secondly, that some of them might dye of the bloody flixe. Thirdly,
that some of them might lean upon a staff. And fourthly, that some of them
might beg their bread. And so they say, it befell David's posterity, for his
sinful wish. One of them leaned upon a staff, Asa was goutish. One of his
posterity was killed by the sword, as Josias. One of them dyed of the flixe, as
Rehoboam. And one of them begged his bread, as Iehojachim. But this collection
is most impious; for David spoke not here by a private spirit of revenge, but
as a Prophet of God: and therefore when they assign these to be the causes,
why these judgments befell David's posterity; they assign that for a cause,
which was not a cause.

The penmen of the holy Ghost, were holy men.
the Lord made choice of none such to be his secretaries, who were not
sanctified. The Lords Prophet is called vir spiritus, the man of the Spirit,
Hos. 9.7. because he is ruled, and guided by the holy Spirit, that he become
not profaine. If the very women, who spun the curtains to the Tabernacle were
wise hearted, Exodus 35.25. Much more will the Lord have those, who are to build
his house; wise and holy men. Those who translated the Bible into Greek, ye
shall see how often they changed their faith, and were turne-coates: Aquila of
a Christian he became a Jew. Symmachus was first a Samaritane, and then he
became half Jew, half Christian. Then Theodoton, first he was a fllower of
Tatianus the heretic, and then he became a Marcionite, and thirdly he became
a Jew. But the Prophets of God, after they were called, continued holy men, and
never fell back again.

See more of Solomon in the Politiks.
God will have no man, but holy men to be his secretaries, Luke 1.70. As he
spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets. Therefore Solomon being a Prophet, and
one of Gods secretaries, behoved to be a holy man; and being holy he could not
be a reprobate: hence he is called Iedidiah, The beloved of God, 2 Samuel 12.25.
and whom God loves, he loves to the end.

The holy men of God wrote as they were (...), inspired by God, (...).
the Spirit enlightened them, and directed them when they wrote: they were
inspired three manner of ways, Illuminati antecedenter. per concomitantia^
subsequenter.

first, antecedenter. Secondly, per concomitantiam; and thirdly, subsequenter.

First, they were illuminate antecedenter: when the Lord revealed things to
come to his Prophets, and made them to write his prophesies; then their tongue,
was the pen of a swift writer, Psalm. 45.1. That is, he not only indicted these
prophesies unto them; but also ruled them so, and guided them in writing; even
as a master guides the hand of a young child, when he is learning to write.

Secondly, he inspired them in writing the Histories and Acts, after another
manner per concomitantiam: for that which was done already, he assisted them
so in writing it down; that they were able to discern the relations which
they had from others, to be true: as Luke knew (...), How Luke differed from
Tertius and Baruch.
accurately the truth of these things, which he had from those, who had heard
and seen Christ: and he made (...), a perfect declaration of them. there was a
great difference betwixt him and Tertius, who was Paul's Scribe, and wrote out
his Epistles, Romans 16.22. or betwixt him and Baruch, who was Ieremies Scribe,
Ier. 38. they were not (...) the secretaries of the holy Ghost, but (...)
discribebant ab alio, they wrote only these things which Jeremiah and Paul
indicted to them; neither was sanctification required in them, as they were
their Scribes. But the Evangelists who saw not Christ, yet they were the
Secretaries of the holy Ghost, and holy men; as they were his Secretaries, and
directed by him to write.

Thirdly, he assisted them in writing subsequenter; the holy Ghost revealed
things to the Prophets long before; but when they were to write these things,
the spirit of the Lord brought the same things to their memory again; and
indicted these things unto them which they had seen before in vision. Ier.
36.2. Take thee a roll, and write therein all the words that I have spoken to
thee, against Israel and against Judah, and against all the Nations; from the
day that I spoke to thee, even from the days of Josias, unto this day. So Ioh.
14.26. the comforter which is the holy Ghost whom the Father will fend in my
name, he shall teach you all thing, and bring all things to your memory which I
have told you.

These Secretaries of the holy Ghost, when they wrote, habebant libertatam
exercitij, sed non specificationis, Libertas exercitij specificationis

as they say in the Schools, they were not like Blocks or Stones, but the
Lord inclined their wills freely to write: which puts a difference betwixt
them, A difference betwixt the Prophets of God and the Sybiles, or Prophets of
the devil.
and the Sybils, and other Prophets of the Devil, who were blasted, and
distracted in their wits, when they prophesied. When Elisha sent one of the
children of the Prophets, to annoint Iehu; one said to him, wherefore comes
this mad fellow, 2 King. 9.11? they took the Prophets to be mad, like unto
the Heathish Prophets, but they were enlightened by the Spirit when they
prophesied, and the Lord rectified their understanding, and took not away from
them the right use of their will. It is said of Saul, when he prophesied, that
the evil spirit of Lord came upon him, 1 Samuel 18.10. And the Chaldie
Paraphrast paraphraseth it, caepit furere, he began to be mad: the Devil
stopping the passages of his body, he wrought upon his melancholious humor,
which is called Esca diaboli, the Devils bait; and then it is said, ijthnabbe,
impulit se ad prophetandum, which is never spoken of the true Prophets in this
Conjugation. (...)


Although the Lords Secretaries had libertatem exercitij, yet they had not
libertatem specificationis; that is, they might not leave that subject which
they were called to write, and write any other thing, as they pleased; they
were necessitated only to write that, although they wrote it freely.

Again, these men when they wrote as the holy Ghost enspired them, The Prophts
did not write with pain and study.
they did it not with pain and study, as we do; but it came freely from them
without any pain or vexation of their spirit. The Princes when they heard
Baruch read the prophecy of Jeremiah, after that it was endited, they asked
how did he write all these words at his mouth? and Baruch answered them, He
pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink
into the Book, Iere. 36.17.18. Solomon says, Eccles. 12.12. In making many
books and in reading there is much weariness of the flesh, but this was no
weariness to them; for they wrote this without any pain or labor: and hence
it follows, that those to whom their writing has been troublesome and
painful, have not been the Secretaries of the holy Ghost; as Mac. 2.26. He
that assayed to abridge the five Books of Jason said, that it was not an
easy thing, to make this abridgement; but it required both sweat and labcu.

Seeing all that wrote the holy Scriptures were enspired by the holy Ghost;
Quest. Why was John called a Divine.

(...).


why was this Epithete appropriate to John, to be called a Divine, Revela. 1.1.
For they were all Divines who wrote the holy Scriptures?

Quomodo differunt (...) and (...).
and specially Chrysostom, they distinguish between (...), and (...), and
they say, Apud caeteros aeconomiae fulmen, sed apud Iohannem theologiae
tonitrua extare. The rest when they discribe the humanity of Christ, they do
it (...); but when John discribeth the Divinity of Christ, he does it (...);
and they say Mattheus (...) and Johannes (...), incipit

Observe a difference betwixt these speeches. The Lord came to the wicked, but
the word of the Lord came to his Prophets.
The Word of the Lord came to Esaias, to Jeremiah; and this phrase: The Lord came
to Balaam, to Abimelech, to Laban. The first signifies, that the Lord put
these holy men in trust with his Word to be his Prophets; but he never
concredited his word to these prophaine wretches: therefore it is said only,
He came to them, but never the Word of the Lord came to them. He concredited
his Word to his Prophets, as to Esaias, and Jeremiah (...), that is, as a pupil
is concredited to the trust of his Tutor; but he never concredited his Word to
these wretches.

The Lord spoke in his Prophets, (...) Notat internam revelationem.
Hosea 1.1. The Spirit of the Lord spoke in me, that is, inwardly revealed his
secrets to me. Mark a difference betwixt these two phrases, Loqui in aliquo,
and Loqui in aeliquem.

Loqui in aliquo, is when the Spirit of the Lord speaks inwardly to the
Prophets; Loqui in aliquo and loqui in aliquem vt differunt.
sed Loqui in aliquem est maledicere, to rail against him: thus Number. 12.
Miriam loquuta est in Mosem, id est, maledixit Mosi.

Matthew. 10.20. It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of our Father which
speaks in you. So it was not they who wrote, but the Spirit of the Lord in
them. 2 King. 13. When Ioash the King of Israel took a Bow in his hand, Elisha
laid his hands upon the Kings hands, and Elisha bad him shoot; and he said,
the Arrow of the Lords deliverance and the Arrow of the deliverance from Syria;
it was not the Kings hand that directed the Arrow here, but it was the hand of
the Prophet laid upon the Kings hand which gave this mighty blow: so it was the
hand of the Lord laid upon the hands of his Secretaries, which directed them to
write the holy Word of God.

EXERCITAT. IX. Arguments proving the Scriptures to be Divine.
1 Thessalonians. 2.13. Ye received it not as the Word of man, but as it is in truth
the Word of God.
THe Testimonies which prove the Scriptures to be Divine, are first, the
Testimony of God himself when he approved them by his Spirit, and when they
were laid before him, by Vrim and Thummim. Secondly, arguments drawn out of
the Scriptures themselves. Thirdly, the Testimony of the Church. Fourthly, the
Testimony of those who were without the Church, Deus testatur, Scriptura
contestatur, and Ecclesia subtestatur.

Deus testatur.
God bears witness to the Scriptures two ways, First, by the internal
Testimony of his Spirit. Secondly, by his external Testimony.

When the Spirit testifies unto us such Books to be his Word,

This is a public Testimony,

The second Testimony which God gave to the Scriptures, was his external
testimony given by Vrim and Thummim, testifying these Books of Moses and the
Prophets, to be the holy Scriptures.

What are we to think of these Books, Vrim and Thummim?

Ketubhim, written Books, (...)
to put a difference between them, and these Books which were confirmed by
Vrim and Thummim: they who wrote these Books were inspired by the holy Ghost
as well as these who wrote the former; and they were confirmed by the masters
of the great Synagogue, (...) aradice
such as were Esdras Zachary and Malachie. The Greeks called these Books
(...): (...) abscondere.
and the Jews distinguish them still, (...).
from the Apocryphal Books called Gannazim abscinditi, and the Greeks called
them (...), Books of whose authority it was still doubted.

Scriptura contestatur.
all this time was tempus (...) to the heathen, that is, it was an hid or an
unknown time to them. After the flood, the Scriptures go on, and they set
down to us the history of the Church: Tempus (...) (...) Historicum.

but the Heathen history is Tempus (...), or fabulosum; as that which we read
of Hercules, and Prometheus: and nothing is set down in the Heathen history
before the Olympiads of the Graecians, which was but in the days of Vzziah.
See how far Gods Word exceeds humane history, in antiquity; It begins
with the world and ends with it, Luke 1.70. as he spoke by the mouth of his
holy Prophets, which have been since the world began.

morbum, medicinam, and medicum, it shows us both the sickness, the
physic, and the Physician to cure it.

The Scriptures not written to satisfy men's curiosity.
Thirdly, the Scripture sets down things necessary only for our salvation,
and nothing for our curiosity. It is often repeated in the Books of the Kings
and Chronicles. The rest are they not written in the Books of the Chronicles,
of the Kings of Judah and Israel, So Ester. 10.2. The rest are they not written
in the Books of the Kings of Persia. The holy Ghost would meet here with the
curious desires of men, who desire still to know more and more, and to read
pleasant discourses, to satisfy their humors: as if the Spirit of God should
say; I have sufficiently told you here of the Kings of Judah and Israel, and of
Persia, and so far as concerns the Church, and may serve for your
edification: it is not my manner to satisfy your curiosity, if ye would know
more, go to your own Scrowles and Registers; where ye shall find matter
enough to pass the time with. To be short, the Scriptures are not given to
pass the time with, but to redeem the time.

Esa. 41.22. Let them show the former things what they be, that we may consider
them and set our hearts upon them: Renunciare proeterita anunciare presentia p.
anunciare futura.
and show us the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye
are Gods. Here the Prophet distinguishes the true God from the false Gods, and
true prophesies from false: If they could tell of things bypast, and relate
them from the beginning and join them with the things to come; then he would
confess that they were Gods, and that their prophesies were true. To tell of
things past is not in respect of time; for the Angels and Devils can tell
things fallen out from the beginning of time: but it is in respect of the
things themselves, when they took beginning, and this is only proper to God,
Psalm. 139.16. In thy Book all my members were written, which in continuance
were fashioned, when as yet there were none of them. He can join things
bypast with things that are to follow; and can tell certainly of things to
come. There is a twofold beginning of things. The first is, exordium rei: The
second is, exordium temporis. Exordium temporis rei.

The Angels know exordium temporis, but not exordium rei; for the Lord only
knows things before the foundation of the world was laid, Ephe. 1.4. He who
knows certainly the beginning of things, can only certainly fortell the
event of things, as though they were present, Hos. 12.4. he wept and made
supplication to him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us. Here
the thing past, he applies to the generation which was present, because he
knew exordium rei.

Esa. 8.1. Take a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen, Behheret enosh.
(...)
That is clearly, that the simplest amongst the children of men may understand
it, Deuteronomy. 30.11. This commandment which I command thee this day, is not hidden
from thee, neither is it far off: In the Hebrew it is, Lo niphleeth, non
separatum a te, (...)
that is, it is not separated from thy knowledge, that thou cannot understand
it: and it is not far from thee, for these things which are obscure and
doubtful which we cannot take up, are said to be far from us; these things
which we understand again are said to be near us, Romans 10.8.



Obscuritas est vel^n rebus ipsis. modo tradendi. conceptione.

the perspicuity in the midsts as they are set down, and thirdly, the dullness
of our conception to take them up. There are many matters handled in the
Scripture, which are hard to be understood, and we are dull in conception to
take up these things; yet they are clearly and plainly set down in the word.
Christ shows all these three, Ioh. 3.12. If I have told you earthly things,
and ye believe not: how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things. If
I have told you earthly things, that is, illustrated heavenly things to you by
earthly comparisons; here is Christ's plain manner in setting down his word.
And ye believe not; here is our dullness in taking up these things which are
plainly set down. How shall ye believe if I shall tell you of heavenly
things, here is the obscurity of the heavenly matters contained in the
Scriptures. The Church of Rome confounds still these three, Obscuritas rei,
and nostri conceptus, cum perspicuo modo tradendi, the obscurity in the matter
the dullness of our conception, with the clear manner of manifestation of
these things in the Scriptures.

writers of the holy Scriptures, shows them to be Divine. The agreement of
the writers of the holy Scriptures.
There were in the Church Patriarchs Prophets and Apostles: Amongst the
Patriarchs, Abraham was the chief; therefore the revelations made to the rest
of the Patriarchs, as to Isaac and to Jacob, had always relation, to the
promises made to Abraham. Amongst the Prophets Moses was the chief, and
therefore all the Prophets grounded themselves upon Moses. And upon the
revelations made to the Apostles, the faith of the Church is grounded, under
the New Testament: and ye shall never find any contradictions amongst these
holy writers; there may seem some contradiction amongst them, but indeed there
is none. Epiphanius uses a good comparison to this purpose: when a man, says
he, Simile.
is drawing water out of a deep Well with two Vessels of a different metal;
the water at the first seems to be of a different color; but when he draws
up the Vessels nearer to him, Although there seem some contradiction in the
Scriptures, we should labor to reconcile them.
this diversity of colors vanishes, and the waters appear both of one
color, and when we taste them, they have but one relish. So says he, although
at the first, there seem some contradiction in the holy Scriptures, yet when
we look nearer and nearer unto them, we shall find no contrariety in them,
but a perfect harmony. When we see the Heathen history, or Apocryphal Books
contradicting the holy History, we should stand for the holy Scriptures
against them: but when we see any appearance of contradiction in the
Scriptures, we should labor to reconcile them: when Moses saw an Egyptian
and an Israelite striving together; he killed the Egyptian, and saved the
Israelite, Exodus 2.12. But when be saw two Israelits striving together, he
labored to reconcile them, saying, ye are brethren why do ye strive. So
when we see the Apocryphal Books, or heathen History, to contradict the
Scriptures, we should kill the Egyptian and save the Israelite. Example, Jacob
cursed Simeon and Levi, for murdering of the Sichemites, Genesis 49.7. but Judith
blessed Simeon for killing of them, Judith 9. So Jeremiah says, they shall
return in the third generation, Ier. 27.7. but Baruch says, they shall
return in the seventh generation Baruch, 6. here let us kill the Egyptian but
save the Israelite: but when we see any appearance of contradiction in the
holy Scriptures, we should labor to reconcile them, because they are brethren.

Ordo naturae, Ordo naturae. conjugalis thori. historiae. dignitatis.

Ordo conjugalis thori, Ordo historiae, and Ordo dignitatis; all these the
Scriptures mark, and for sundry reasons sets one before another: and
although there be not prius and posterius in Scriptura (as the Jews say) in
respect of the particular occasions, yet there is still prius and posterius in
respect of the general end of the history. First, in setting down the
Patriarchs, it observes ordinem naturae, as they were borne; as Ruben in the
first place, because he was the first borne; and then Simeon, thirdly Levi, and
fourthly Judah, etc. Secondly, The Tribes are set down sometimes according to
their nativity, and sometimes as they were borne of free women.
there is Ordo conjugalis thori, according to their birthes, and so the free
women's sons, are set first in the Brestplace of Aaron, Exodus 28. Thirdly,
there is Ordo dignitatis, as Sem is placed before Iaphet for dignity, although
he was younger. So the Scripture else where observes this order, Matthew. 13. He
brings fourth new and old, and Ephe. 2. Apostles and Prophets. So the
Scripture observes the order of history, Matthew. 1.1. The Book of the
generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David the Son of Abraham. why is
Abraham put last after David? because the history is to begin at him. So 1
Chro. 3.5. Solomon is placed last amongst his brethren, because the history was
to begin at him: and if we shall mark the heavenly order that is amongst the
Evangelists, The heavenly order amongst the Evangelists show the Scriptures to
be Divine.
they will show us that the Scriptures are divine. Mark begins at the
works of Christ. Matthew ascends higher, to the birth of Christ. Luke goes
higher, to the conception of Christ, and John goes highest of all, to the
divinity of Christ and his eternal generation. Who would not admire here, the
steps of Jacobs heavenly ladder, ascended from Joseph to Adam, and from Adam to
God.

Iam. 4.6. The spirit in us lusts after envy, yet the Scriptures offer more
grace, The Scriptures offer grace to resist sin.
that is, the Scriptures offer grace and ability to do more, then nature can
do: Nature cannot heal a Spirit, that lusts after envy, or after money or
after uncleanesse; but the Scriptures offer more grace to overcome any of these
sins, be they never so strong. The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the
soul, Psalm. 19.17. when it is dead in sin, it quickneth and reviveth it
again; and when it is decayed in grace, The Word of God is a restorer of the
spiritual life.
it restores it again, even as Boaz is said to be a restorer of the life of
Naomi, and a nurisher of her old age, Ruth 4.15.

Ionathans bow did never turn back, and the Sword of Saul never returned
empty, 2 Samuel 1.22. So the Arrows of the King are sharp to pierce his
enemies, Psalm 45.5.

Ioh. 10.35. The Scriptures cannot be broken, the arguments set down in the
Scripture, are so strong; that all the heretics in the world could never
break them, and they stand like a brazen wall against all oppositions;
therefore the Lord challenges men to bring forth their strongest reasons. Esa.
41.21. produce your cause says the Lord, bring forth your strong reasons says
the King of Jacob.

Ecclesia subtestatur.
The Church is the Pillar of Truth, she holds out the Truth to be seen, she
expounds and interprets the Scriptures; yet her testimony in but an
inducing testimony, and not a persuading testimony: she can teach the Truth,
but she cannot seal up the truth in our hearts, and make us to believe the
Truth of the Scripture. Actus exercitus. signatus.

Her testimony is but in actu exercito, but non signato. Her testimony is
informativum, sen directivum, it informs and directs us, sed non
certificativum and terminativum fidei; that is, she cannot persuade us of the
Truth by her Testimony.

Testimonies of these also, who are without the Church prove the Scriptures to
be Divine, and these are of two sorts; either Heretics, or Infidels.

Heretics prove the Scripture to be Divine, ex accidente.
First, the testimonies of Heretics prove the Scriptures to be Divine; for
Heretics labor always to ground themselves upon the Scriptures. The habit
goes always before the privation, and omne falsum innititur vero, every
falsehood labors to cover it self under the Truth. When the Husbandman had
sown his good seed, then came the evil one and did sow his Tares: when
Heretics labor to ground themselves upon the Scriptures; it is, as when a
thief goes to cover himself under the pretense of Law. This argues the Law
to be just and equal. The testimonies also of the Heathen history proves the
Scriptures to be Divine. Observe the descent of the Babylonian and Assyrian
Kings, and look back again to the holy Scriptures: ye shall see clearly,
how they jumpe with the Scriptures: and as those who sail along the Coast,
have a pleasant view of the Land; Simile.
but those who stand upon the Land, and behold the Ships sailing along the
Coast, Succession of Heathen Kings proved out of the Scripture.
have a more settled and pleasant sight of the Ships: so when we look from
the Heathen history, and mark the descent of the Heathen Kings, we shall see
a pleasant sight: but a far more delectable and sure sight, when we look
from the Scriptures, to the Heathen history. Mark the descent; Belochus the
third called Pull King of Assyria came against Menahem, and took his son, 2
King. 15. Then Pileser called Tiglath, came against Hoshea, King of Samaria,
and took him in the sixth year of the reign of King Ezekias* and then
Shalmanefer, who carried away the ten Tribes into captivity, in the ninth year
of Hoshea, 2 King. 17. and his son Sennacherib, 2 King. 18. came against
Judah, in the foureteenth year of Zedekias, and Esarhaddon succeeded his father
Sennacherib, and his son Berodach-baladon, sent letters and a present to
Hezekias, then Berodach, 2 Chro. 33. carried away Iechonias, and then
Nebuchadnezzer carried away Zedekias; then Nabuchadnezzer the great, burnt
Jerusalem, and carried away the people captive. Then Evil Merodach, who
succeeded him had three sons, Ragasar, Babasar and Belshassar, of whom we
read Dan. 5. and in Belshassers time, the kingdom was translated to the Medes
and Persians. Here we see the descent of the Heathen history, agreeing with the
holy Scriptures.

There are other testimonies of the Heathen, How the Heathen testimonies prove
the Scriptures to be divine.
to prove the Scripture to be Scripture, but not so clearly; when we find the
rubbish of some old monuments, we gather that there has been some great
building there: So when we find some dark footesteps of holy Scripture
amongst the Heathen, we may gather, that once the holy Scriptures have been
read amongst them, although they have depraved and corrupted them.

M^ntan. in his Essays.
Example 1. They of the East Indians have this fable amongst them, that the Gods
drowned the world for sin, and that they took some just men, and put them up
in the clifts of Rocks, to save them: those men to try whether the waters were
abated or not; sent forth some mastive Dogs, and the Dogs returning as
clean as they went out; they gathered by this, that the waters were not yet
abated: they sent them forth the second time, then they returned full of mudde,
by this they gathered that the waters were abated: then they sent them forth
the third time and they returned no more. Here we see how this fable is taken
out of the history of the deluge, and from Noah's sending forth the Dove out of
the Arc; and that this history was known of old amongst the Heathen, we may
perceive because the Dove and the Raven are called the messengers of the Gods,
by the Heathen Poets.

(...)
Example 2. Genesis 36.24. This is Anah who found out Hajemim mules, in the
Wilderness, others read it Iamin^ waters: (...)
now because it was hard to find out the right translation of the word, some
translating it Mules, and some translating it Water: the Heathen made up a
notable lie on the Jews, saying; when Anah was feeding his Asses in the
Wilderness, because the Mules and Asses found out water in the Wilderness for
them to drink, Tacitus. lib. 5. Plutarch. in symposiasis. 4. cap. 5.
therefore the Jews worshipped the golden head of an Ass: see how some
shadow of holy history was still amongst the Heathen.

Example 3. When the destroying Angel destroyed the first borne of their
children, and beasts in Egypt, the Lord caused to sprinkle the blood of the
paschall Lamb, upon the Lintels of the doors, that so their first borne might
be saved, Epipha. contra haerefes. lib. 18.
Exodus 12.13. Epiphanius records that the Egyptians afterward, although they
had forgotten the history of the work of God, yet they rubbed over their
Cattle with a red sort of Keill, to save them that no evil should befall them
that year, ignorantly counterfeitting that blood, which saved the Israelites
once in Egypt: which fable lets us to understand, that this Scripture was
once taught amongst them.

Example 4. Plato did hold that in the revolution of so many years, men should
be just in the same estate, wherein they were before; which is drawn obscurely
from the resurrection, when we shall be in (...), as we were in (...) Matthew.
19.28.

Example 5. Clemens Alexandrinus and Basil note, The Heathen grounded many of
their fables upon the Scriptures.
that the Heathen Philosophers did make their fables, counterfeitting the
Scriptures; and founded their falsehoods upon the truth of God, that men might
give credit to their lies: as upon this, Jonas was swallowed up by the Whale;
they made up this fable of Arion, sitting upon a Delphin, and playing upon an
harp, and a thousand such.

The Conclusion of this is. David, Psalm. 119.18. open thou mine eyes, that I
may behold the wondrous things out of thy Law in the original it is, (...)
Devolue ab oculis meis velamen, scilicet, caliginis, and let us be diligent
searchers and dwell in them, as Paul bids Timothy, (...) Panormitan writes
of Alphonsus King of Arragon, that in the midst of all his princely affairs,
he read over the Bible fourteen times, with the gloss and commentaries upon
it. The Jews say, let a man divide his life in three parts; a third part for
the Scriptures, a third part for mishneth, and a third part for gemara, (...)
that is, two for the Talmud, and one for the Scriptures, see how well they
were exercised in reading of the Law.

EXERCITAT. X. Jn what languages the Scriptures were written originally.
Genesis 11.1. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
THe Old Testament was written originally in Hebrew, and the New Testament in
Greek.

In what character the Scriptures were written at the first.
The Character, in which the Old Testament was written first, was the Samaritane
Character; It was called the Samaritane Character, not because the Samaritans
used it first, but because it was left to the Samaritans after the Jews
refused it.

This Samaritane Character was the first Character as may be seen by the
inscriptions upon their shekels set down by Arius Montanus, Why called the
Samaritane character.
Beza, and Willet upon Ezekiel. And sundry of the Jews ancient monuments have
these letters upon them.

The Character at the first was the Jews and not the Samaritans, The
inscriptions upon the Shekels, show the Samaritane character to be the first.
as is proved by the inscriptions of the shekels. The inscription is this,
Jerusalem hakkodesh; but no Samaritan would have put this inscription upon it:
for they hated Jerusalem and the Jews, therefore this inscription must be the
Jews, and not the Samaritans.

Secondly, most of these ancient shekels are found about Jerusalem, The Jews
kept the Samaritane character in the captivity.
therefore the shekel and letters upon it, was at the first the Jews, and not
the Samaritans.

This Samaritane Character the Jews kept still, in the time of the captivity,
when Belshasser saw fingers writing upon the wall, Mean mean tekel, etc. Dan.
5.25. These Characters were the Samaritan Characters: therefore the Babylonians
could not read them; because they knew not that Character neither; could the
Jews understand the matter although they knew the letters: to the Babylonians,
it was like a sealed book; and to the Jews it was like an open book, to an
unlearned man; because they understood it not, Esa. 29.11. But Daniel read it
and understood it, both because he knew the letters, and also understood the
Chaldee tongue.

Esdras changed this Character after the captivity, Hieron. in Perfat. lib.
regum.
and left it Idiotis, to the Samaritans: and he set down this new Character,
which before was the Chaldee, Character.

The reason why he changed it, was this, because being long in the captivity,
they forgot their own language, that they could neither read it rightly, nor
write it rightly: and therefore he changed the Characters, in these which we
have now.

But the ancient Samaritan Character seems to be kept still in Lamina
sacerdotali, Why Esdras changed the Character.
in the plate of Gold which was upon the forehead of the Highpriest, after the
captivity; for they might change noen of the ornaments of the Highpriest. So
neither that which was written upon the plate of Gold, Kokesh Laihova,
holiness to the Lord: because the Lord commanded these clothes and ornaments,
to be made for him, and his seed after him, Exodus 28.43.

The Inscription which was upon the Plate of Gold in the forehead of the
Highpriest.

(...)

The New Testament was written originally in the Greek Character; and there
were two translations of it, Syriacke and Arabicke; the Syriacke was written in
the Syriacke Character, which differed much from that, which is called
Alphabetum Salomonis, or the Character which Solomon found out. This Character
Pineda sets down in his book De rebus Salomonis. These diverse Characters
may be seen set down here, as follows.

(...) Character Antiqui^r Mosi^ sive Samaritanorum. Recentior Samaritanorum
Hebraeorum sive Merubha Ez^aerecentior. Chaldaeorum antiquorum nunc Rabbinorum.
Antiquorum Arabum, seu Alphabetum Salomonis. Arabum Recentior. Syrorum.
Gracorum.

The Old Testament was originally written in the Hebrew tongue, and some of it
in the tongues derived from the Hebrew, as Chaldee.

We may know the Hebrew was the first original tongue; because it has fewest
Radical letters: whatsoever tongue is derived from thence, it adds some
letters to the first original; as from the Hebrew word Galal, comes Golgotha
the Syriacke word. So Gabbatha Bethsaida, from Gabha and Chased. Secondly, that
language which the Lord spoke, to Adam, Abraham and Moses, and they to him,
must be the original language. But God spoke to them in the Hebrew, and he
wrote the two Tables with his own hand in this language. And thirdly, that
language which expresses the nature, of things, and their affections most
clearly, and in fewest words; that must be the original language: but the
Hebrew does this; therefore it is the first language.

The Jews understood these tongues which had affinity with the Hebrew.
These tongues which were Propagines and Dialects of the Hebrew, the Jews
understood them, when they heard them spoken, and when they read them, but they
understood not the strange tongues, which had but small affinity with the
Hebrew. When Laban and Jacob made a covenant; Laban called the heap of stones
jegar Sagadutha in the Aramean tongue, which had small affinity with the
Hebrew; but Jacob called it Galeed, Genesis 31.47.

King. 18.26. Speak to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand
it?

The Hebrews understood not the Syrian language but by learning.
They might understand it, for they were Courtiours and States men, and so
learned it, as we learn now the Italians and French language. And Abraham's
servant spoke to Nachor in the Aramean language, he being borne in Damascus,
which was in Cylo-Syria: and we may think that Nachor and his house,
understood the Hebrew tongue, being of the posterity of Heber, and keep that
tongue as Abraham did, who came out of Vr of the Chaldees.

Assyria or Syria hebraice, Aram, The large extent of the Syrian language
comprehended all Paleslina, Damascus, the Kingdom of Assyria, Chaldea,
babylon, Arabia, Cylo-Lyria and Antiochia, Zoba, Adiabena, therefore all the
languages which were spoken in these parts, took their general denomination
from Syria, as Syro-aramaea the language which Laban spoke in Mesopotania:
Syro-Chaldaea or Babylonica was that which they spoke in Babylon,
Syro-Antiochena which they spoke in Antioch or Phoenicia: although they were
Propagines or Dialects of the Hebrew, yet they understood them not while they
were taught: therefore Nabuchadnezzer caused to instruct the children of the
Jews in the Chaldee tongue, Dan. 1.4. but the Syro-Arabean and the Palestine
or Cananitish language they might understand it; because it came nearer to
their own language.

The Egyptian tongue differed much from the Hebrew, Psalm. 81.5. Joseph heard a
language in Egypt, The Jews understood not the Egyptian tongue.
which he understood not. Joseph here is put for the whole people of the Jews,
because there was no affinity betwixt the Hebrew and the Egyptian tongue,
therefore they understood not this tongue. So Psalm. 114.1. they departed from a
people of a strange language, (...)
or a barbarous people: they called them all barbarous whom they understood
not: and because the Jews understood not the Egyptian tongue, therefore
Joseph made him to speak to his brethren by an Interpreter, Genesis. 42.23.

The Cananitish language, The Cananites language a diolect of the Hebrew.
was a daughter of the Hebrew tongue, or rather one, with the Hebrew tongue:
and this we may perceive by the names of the towns; men and places which were
imposed to them by the Cananites; as Jericho, Salem, Kiriath-arba,
Kiriath-Sepher, Beth-dagon* so the names of men, Melchizedeck, Adonibezek,
Abimelech. And if the Cananitish tongue, had not been all one with the Hebrew,
how could the Patriarchs have kept conference with those in Canaan, and made
their Bargains and Contracts with them? this is clear also by the example of
Rahab, who could speak to the Spies, and they understood her; and so Joshua to
the Gibionites. The Lord would have this tongue continued amongst the
Cananites, because the Hebrews were shortly to inhabit that land, and to
converse with the Cananites for a while, until they had rooted them out.

Some of the Old Testament written in the Chaldee tongue.
There is some of the Old Testament written in the Chaldee tongue, which has
great affiance with the Hebrew: and some of it written in the Syrian dialect,
as Job, which the Idumeans used, and it differed little from the Hebrew tongue;
but it differed much from the Syrian language now, but more from Arabia
Ismaelitica, which the Turks speak now, in Asia and Africa.

There are some words found in the Old Testament which are Egyptian, Genesis
41.43. Some Phaenitian, as Chabbul, 1 King. 9.13. Some Persian words as Pur,
Esth. 9.24. and some moabitish.

One Verse in Jeremy. originally written in the Chaldee tongue.
There is one verse in Jeremy originally written in the Chaldee tongue, Ier.
10.11. whereas all the rest of that prophecy, is written in the Hebrew tongue.
The gods that have not made the heaven and earth, even they shall perish from
the earth, and from under these heavens. The reason why this verse was written
in the Chaldee tongue, was this; because the Jews now, were to be carried to
Babylon, and when they should be sollicitated there to worship their gods, they
should answer them in their own language; cursed be your gods, for they made
neither heaven nor earth.

That of Daniel and Ezra which is written in the Chaldee tongue, was
transcribed out of the roules, Somethings taken of the registers of the
Chaldeans, and insert in the Scriptures.
and registers of the Chaldeans; and insert in the books of God: but that
which the holy Ghost indicted originally to Daniel and Ezra, was written in the
Hebrew tongue; the rest was borrowed but out of their registers, as first,
Nebuchad-nezzers dreams, Dan. 2. So Nebuchad-nezzer sets up a golden image,
Cap. 3. So Nebuchad-nezzers dream, Cap. 4. and Belshassers visions Cap. 5. all
these were written in the Chaldee tongue: the seventh Chapter is only
excepted; it is written also in the Chaldee tongue although it was originally
endited to Daniel: because it is a more clear exposition of the monarchies
revealed before to Nebuchad-neZZer, and Belshasser; and set down in their own
Registers in the Chaldee tongue, but the eight Chapter and the rest, are wholly
written in the Hebrew tongue, which were indicted immediately by God to Daniel,
and not transcribed out of their registers as the rest were: So that part of
Ezra which is written in the Chaldee tongue, is but transcribed and written out
of the decrees, and letters, of the Kings of Media, and Persia; from the
eleventh verse of the fourth Chapter, to the seventh Chapter.

The Chaldeans and Persians used to register, and keep a Chronicle of all
their memorable deeds, and what befell them: and so of their visions and
dreams; and they caused to write them, and interpret them; so did the
Persians, Esth. 9.32. and Daniel wrote these visions in the Chaldee tongue, and
he set them down for the good of the Church; that they might understand, that
their conditions should be under the Heathish Kings.

Somethings in the Scriptures borrowed from the Heathen History.
The holy Ghost borrowed somethings first from the Poets, and secondly, from the
history of the Heathen; and the Secretaries of the holy Ghost insert them in
the Book of God. From the Poets; as Paul borrowed from Aratus, Menander,
Epimenides or Callimachus, some verses; and inserted them in his Epistles. So
the Scriptures borrow from the history, which were either Heathenish, or
Jewish. Heathenish again, were of two sorts; either Chaldean or Persian.
Daniel borrows from the Chaldeans: So from the history of the Persians, as
that memorable history of the deliverance of the Jews under Haman; was first
written in the Persian language, Esth. 9.32. and he who wrote the Book of
Esther, borrowed the history out of that book. Somethings in the Scripture
borrowed from the Jewish History.
These things which are borrowed from the Jewish history; as the facts of those
registrate in the Books of the Maccabees, Heb. 11. So Jude out of the
prophecy of Enoch, borrowed the history of the strife, between Michael and
the Devil about the body of Moses. So the Apostle Heb. 11. out of the
traditions of the Jews, borrows, that Esaias was cut with a saw under Menasse.
So there are sundry proverbiall speeches in the Talmud, as, Cast out the beam
which is in thine own eye, and then thou shall see chearely to cast out the
mote that is in they neighbors eye, Matthew. 7.5. So it is easier for a Camel
to go through the eye of a Needle, Matthew. 19.24. So it is hard to kick against
pricks, Act. 9.5. Some of our Divines, to prove that the Apocryphal Books
are not Canonical Scripture, use this midst; because they are not cited by the
Apostles, in the New Testament: but this is false, for the Apostle cites them,
Heb. 11. And Scaliger in his Eusebianis, See Scaliger Eusebius. Page 245.
proves out of Georgius Cyncellus that the Apostle cites many testimonies out
of the Apocryphal Books, and out of the traditions of the Jews. As Matthew,
that Salmon married Rahab. Salmon, his genealogy is set down, 1 Chro. 2. but
not whom he married, this Matthew had by tradition, Matthew. 1.5.

Things in the Heathen history, which are not necessary to be known to the
Church: the Scripture passes by them, and remitteth us to Heathen History, and
says still; The rest are they not written in the books of the Chronicles of
Judah and Israel? and when the knowledge of them is necessary to the Church; it
borrows them out of the Heathen history, and inserteth them in the book of
God.

These things which were written out of the Jewish, Heathen sentences were
sanctified by the Apostles when they cited them.
or Heathenish history were not sanctified; until they were insert in the
book of God: therefore Tertullian writing to his Wife, and citing that verse,
Evil speeches corrupt good manners, 1 Cor. 15.33. says, Memor illius
versiculi sanctificati per Apostolum, the Apostle sanctified this verse when
he borrowed it from the Heathen. And as a woman that was Heathenish, when she
became a Proselyte, she might enter into the congregation, and a Jew might
marry her: so these Jewish and Heathenish histories, God sanctified them, that
they might enter into the Congregation and become holy Scriptures, and so the
holy Spirit sweetened the salt waters of Jericho, that the children of the
Prophets might drink of them, 2 Kings. 2.21.

There are many proper names set down in the Scriptures which are not Hebrew
names, Many names in the Scriptures which are not Hebrew names.
but some of them are Chaldee, some Assyrian and some Persicke names, Ier.
39.3. And all the princes of the King of Babylon came in, and sat in the
middle-gate, even Nergal-Sharezer, Samger Nebo, Sersechim, Rabsaris, Nergal
Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the Princes of the King of Babylon.
And that we may know what names are Chaldee names, what Syriacke and what
Persicke. Mark this Table following, concerning these names, and the
composition of them, taken out of Scaliger.

How shall we discern in what language a book was written?

There be two special notes whereby we may discern this; the first is
Interpretation,

First is Interpretation, when the Spirit of God interprets a strange word,
into another tongue; To know in what language a book was written. (...)
then the book was written in that language, in which the word is interpreted.
Example, Esth. 9. Pur this Persicke word is interpreted by the Hebrew goral,
therefore the book was written in the Hebrew, and not in the Persicke tongue
by Mordecai, or by him who else wrote the book. Example 2. Abba Pater, Romans
8.15. Abba is the Syriack word, and Pater the Greek word, because Abba is
interpreted by Pater, therefore the Apostle has written this Epistle in
Greek, and not in Syriack. And so Thomas is called Didymus; Ioh. 11.16.
therefore the Gospel of John was written originally in Greek, (...) Contracte
and not in Hebrew. (...) gemelli.
So Heb. 7.2. Melchisedeck the King of Salem, first, by interpretation King of
righteousness, (...) gemi us (...).
and after that King of peace. The word Melchesedick which is one word, for the
understanding of the Graecising Jews he divides it in two, and shows in
Greek, Act. 1^.8. Elimas by interpretation Magus, this word Magus is
degenerate in a Greek word, therefore this book was written in Greek.
that Salem signifies peace, and Zedek Iustitia, righteousness; as if he
would say, frugifer, qui fert fructum, cornifer, qui fert cornua: here because
the interpretation is in Greek; we may know that this Epistle has been
written originally in Greek.

The second note, to know in what language books have been written, is by the
Allusion of words in the Scriptures. for there are many allusions in the
Hebrew, and in the Chaldee tongue, when they are translated in the Greek or
any other language they loose that grace, as Cabhal is (...)* and C^bhel is
(...)* (...)
Cobal apud Targumislos est caligare, E egans Paranomasia apud Thargum^slos
inter ^^^hal and Cebhe^.
but Ioh. 1.5. (...) (...). And the light shined in darkness, and the
darkness comprehended it not; Here the sweet allusion which is in the
Chaldee, perishes in the Greek. So Ioh. 10.1. (...). (...)
the Syriacke expresses it by a sweet allusion Min tirghna letira, which is
not in the Greek, E^egans paranomasia apud Syro^ inter tirghna and tira.
where the words fall alike which will not fall out in other languages. There
was a question betwixt Origin and Africanus, whether the history of Susanna was
written in Hebrew or in Greek. Africanus denied that it was written in Hebrew,
but in Greek, and he proved it thus. When Daniel examined the Witnesses who
testified against Susanna, he took the witnesses a part and enquired at one of
them, under what tree he saw her commit that villainy? he said it was (...),
the Lentish tree; then Daniel alluding to this said, (...), The Angel of God
has received sentence of God to cut thee in pieces. (...). Divido seco findo
So he inquired at the other, under what tree he saw her; (...). Serra divido
seco.
he answered, (...), Under a Prime tree. Then Daniel said (...), The Angel of
the Lord waited with the sword to cut thee in two. Africanus by this allusion
of words gathered, that this history was not originally written in Hebrew, but
in Greek.

Patriarchs, and in which the Angels spoke to men, and it was the language
which all the world spoke before the confusion of Babylon, and it is the mother
tongue from whence many other tongues are derived, and it is holden by some, to
be that tongue, in which we shall speak one to another in the life to come.
Therefore we should be desirous to understand this holy language.

EXERCITAT. XI. Of the Style of the Scriptures.
Ioh. 7.46. Never man spoke like this man.
When we describe a man's speech, first we describe it by that which is
natural, as whether he be (...), of a weak voice, (...).
or (...) of a slow tongue. Secondly, in what language he speaks. Thirdly,
in what Dialect he speaks. Fourthly, whether it be Soluta oration or (...).
Fifthly, the Property of the speech. Sixthly, the Evidence of the speech.
Seventhly, the Fullness of the speech. Eighthly, the Shortness of the speech.
Ninthly, the Coherence, and lastly the Efficacy of the speech.

First, we describe that which is natural, and proceeds from some defect of
the organs, as if he spoke with a weak voice, or be of a stammering tongue, or
thick lips, which Exodus 6.12, are called Uncircumcised lips: Contrary to
this is a thin lip which is a sign of Eloquence, Job. 12.20. for these who
have thin lips, commonly are Eloquent. Moses the Penman of the holy Ghost,
although he was defective in speech; yet read his writings, and ye shall see
such eloquence in him, that no Heathen could ever match it, The writers of the
Scriptures although weak in person yet powerful in words.
and as it is said of Paul, when he was present in person he was weak, 2 Cor.
10.10. and his speech base and contemptible yet his letters were weighty and
powerful: so whatsoever want or infirmity was in Moses person, yet there was
no want or defect in his writings.

Secondly, in what language he speaks. The holy Ghost spoke and wrote in
Hebrew in the Old Testament, The Old Testament was written in Hebrew, and the
New in Greek.
and in the New in Greek. He wrote the Old Testament in Hebrew, a language
which had this blessing spoken of in the Law, Deuteronomy. 28.12. Thou shall lend and
not borrow, so this language lends to many Nations, but borrows of none.
He wrote the New Testament in Greek, The Hebrew tongue lends to many, but
borrows of none.
a most copious and fertile tongue, which was then Lingua communis to the Jews
although not vulgaris.

Thirdly, in what Dialect he speaks. The Dialects of the Hebrew tongue were
sundry, first, Dialectus Hierosolymitana, that Dialect which was spoken in
Jerusalem and about it, (...)
Ast. 1.19. (...). In their own Dialect, (...)
or proper tongue. So the Dialect of the Ephramites, who said, Sibboleth and
not Shibboleth, Judge. 12.6. and the Dialect of the Galileans, as Peter spoke in
the Galilean Dialect, Matthew. 26.73. So in the new Testament there are sundry
Dialects as Ionick, Dorick Attick, etc.

Fourthly, whether it be in prose or in verse. The Jews divide the Old
Testament according to the style into Charuz; rithmum; Shir carmen, and
Halatza, Orationem solutam, that is prose.

(...) Rithmus.
CharuZ is Soluta oration, but in five Rithmo colligata; that is, it begins
in prose, but ends as it were in meeter, such is Job.

(...) Carmen.
Shir, canticum; written in meeter, as the Psalms and Canticles.

(...) Oration soluta
Hallatza, written in prose; such are the Histories and the most of the
prophets.

Fifthly, the property of the speech. The phrase in Hebrew is much to be
observed, for in the Hebrew it will signify one thing, and in other languages,
another thing.

Example, Number. 19.20. Dies numeri, Dies numeri quid apud Hebraeos.
signifies A few days, so Homines numeri, Genesis 34 30. A few men, Deuteronomy. 4.27.
Ezekiel. 12.16. So Esaias 10.19. The rest of the Trees of his Forest shall be
number, that a child may write them, that is, They shall be few. In other
languages this phrase would signify many men, and many trees, etc.

So some phrases of the Scripture have a contrary signification with the
Hebrews, Some phrases with the Hebrews have a contrary signification.
as Zack. 11.24. Ascendit visio a me, that is, It perished. So Ier. 47.15. Moab
is spoiled and gone up out of her Cities, that is, She is destroyed. Sometimes
again it signifies to wax and increase, as 1 King. 22.35. Bellum ascendit,
The battle increased. So Psalm. 74.23. The tumult that arise up against thee
ascends, that is, Increases continually.

So Levare peccatum is to take off the burden of sin, Exodus 10.17. and John
alludeth to this, 1.29. Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of
the world. (...) Lapidare. Elapidare

And Levare peccatum, Is to take up the burden of sin, Levit. 5.1. So Sakal,
Lapidare and Elapidare, signifies either to cast stones upon a thing, as Deuteronomy.
22.24. or to take away the stones out of a place, as Esa. 62.10.

Another example, I am like a drunken man whom the wine has gone over, Ier.
23.9. that is, whom the wine has overcome, but Matthew. 26.39. Let this cup
pass over me, that is, let it not touch me; in a contrary signification. So
Genesis 25.18. Cecidit coram fratribus suis, He dyed in presence of his brethren,
The New Testament uses often times the Hebraismes of the Old
but the Seventi^ translated it (...), He dwelt before his brethren.

The New Testament usually follows these Hebraismes of the Old Testament as
Hos. 8.8. A vessel in which there is no pleasure, Romans 9.21. A vessel of
dishonor. So 1 Samuel 21.5. The vessels of the young men are holy, 1 Thessalonians. 4.4.
That ye may know to possess your vessels in holiness. So Exodus 1.8. there
arose a new King in Egypt who knew not Joseph, Matthew. 11, 11. there arose not
a greater then John the baptist.

So in the New Testament there are many peculiar phrases which are found in no
other Greek writers, and here we must distinguish inter Hellenisimum and
Graecismum. Difference betwixt Hellenismum and Graecismum. Hellenismus quid.
Hellenismus is that sort of phrase which the Seventy use, for they translating
the Scriptures for the use of the grecizing Jews, followed the Hebrew Chaldee
and Syriacke in many things: The Seventy follow the Hebrew, Chaldee and
Syriacke in many things.
so that they have a peculiar style which is not to be found in other Greek
writers, example (...) in the New Testament signifies wrath and poison Reve.
18.3. Ex vino veneni, that is, poisoned wine. (...) ira. venenum.
So Job 4.6. The reason of this is, because Hhema in the Hebrew, signifies
both wrath and poison. Another example, 1 Cor. 5.45. Death is swallowed up into
victory: the Seventy has it (...) In perpetuum, but (...) does not signify
perpetuum amongst the Heathen, Amos 8.7. and 2 Samuel 2.26. Lament 5.20.
why do they then translate it, For ever? because the word Netzahh, (...)
Victoria. and Aeternitas.

signifies both Victory and Eternity. A third example, Genesis 8.21. Dixit ad
eor suum dominus; but the Chaldee says, Bemeria (...) which phrase the
Evangelist John follows; (...)
but this is not a phrase used amongst the Greeks. A fourth example, Give us
this day, our daily bread, Matthew. 6.11. The Greeks say, (...) Panem
quotidianum, but the Syriacke has it (...), Crastinum panem, that bread which
may feed us to day and to morrow. So Iam. 4.6. The Lord exalts the humble,
but according to the Hebrew and Syriacke phrase, to Exalt, is to lift up on the
Cross, Ioh. 8.28. When ye have lift up the Son of man, or exalted the Son
of man, that is, lifted him up on the Cross. These particular phrases used by
the Seventy would be marked. And besides these, The simplicity of the style of
the Scripture is admirable.
if we shall look more nearely to the style of the Scripture, as to the
simplicity of it, then we shall much more admire it, 1 Cor. 2.4. My preaching
was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the
Spirit, and of power.

Again the Evidence of the style, (...) oculata fides cum quis ipse videt.
the judgments of God are set down, so wisely in the Scripture, as if a man
were looking on with his eyes, this is called (...) by the Greeks, as we may
see in the deludge, the overthrow of Sodom, and the miracles in the
Wilderdernesse, set down so clearly before us, as if we had been eye
witnesses of them. See a notable example, Psalm. 7.12.13. By a borrowed kind of
speech he sets forth the judgments of God which were to over take the
wicked, as if we were looking on. If he turn not he will whet his Sword, he
has bent his bow, and made it ready, he has also prepared for him the
instruments of death: he has ordained his arrows against the persecutors.

Eighthly, the Fullness of the speech. (...).
The Greeks call this (...) wherein nothing is wanting, neither in the
enumeration of the parts, The holy Ghost sets down all circumstances
belonging to the purpose whereof he entreats.
or explication of the causes, or reciting of the circumstances: for the holy
Ghost sets down all the circumstances belonging to the purpose. So the
Apostle Romans 1. describes at large the vanity and impiety of the Gentiles. And
Romans 2. the hypocrisy of the Jews, and Cap. 3. he makes a full description
of the corruptions of man, reckoning up the parts. There is none righteous, no
not one, verse. 10. There is none that understands, there is none that seeks
after God, verse. 11. They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether
become unprofitable, there is none that does good, no not one, Verse. 12. Their
throat is an open Sepulcher, with their tongues have they used deceit, the
poison of Aspes is under their lips, Verse. 13. Whose mouth is full of cursing
and bitterness, Verse. 14. Their feet is swift to shed blood, Verse. 15.
Destruction and misery are in their ways, Verse. 16. And the way of peace they
have not known, Verse. 17. And there is no fear of the Lord before their eyes,
Verse. 18.

Ninthly, the Shortness of the speech: and here we cannot enough admire the
fullness of the style and the shortness of it, Every word of the Scripture
carries a weight.
and that which Cicero said of Thucycides may here be applied fitly, Eum esse
adeo plenum refertumque rebus, ut prope verborum numerum, numero rerum exaquet,
That every word carried a weight with it, and therefore we may call it Laconica
Scriptura.

All things in the Scrip- are fitly joined.
Tenthly, the Coherence: all things in the Scriptures are fitly joined and
coupled together. The Heathen said that there were three things unpossible,
Eripere, Iovi fulmen, Herculi clavam and Homero versum; to pull Jupiters
Thunderbolt out of his hand, Hercules Club out of his hand, and a verse from
Homer: for they thought, that there was such a connection between Homers
verses, that not one verse could be taken away without a great breach in the
whole work: but this may be much more said of the Scriptures of God which
have such a dependence and connection, that if ye take away but one verse, the
whole shall be marred.

Genesis 48.7. And as for me when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the Land
of Canaan in the way, when there was but yet a little way to come to Ephrath,
and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same is Bethlehem, Verse. 8.
And Israel beheld Joseph's sons. How does this cohere with that which goes
before; it would seem that there is no dependence here.

How sentences in the Scripture seeming to disagree cohere very well.
for Jacob had adopted two of Joseph's children, then he gives the reason of
this adoption in these words; as if he should say, whereas I might have had more
children by my first wife Rachel, if she had lived; it is great reason that I
supply this defect in her, by placing some in sted of these children, which she
might have borne to me; and I adopt those thy sons since she is dead.

The second place which seems to have no coherence with things going before,
Esa. 39.21. Take a lump of sigges, and lay it for a plaster unto the boil
and he shall recover, verse. 22. Ezekias also had said what is the sign, that I
shall go up into the house of the Lord. What coherence is betwixt these words,
and the words going before?

There is a right coherence here, and he sets down that last, which was
first for brevities cause; which is more at large set down in the book of the
Kings; and therefore Iunius translateth it well, (...)
Vajo ner, In plusquam perfecto, Esaias had said.

Ier. 40.1. The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, etc.

The beginning of the fortieth Chapter, with the seventh Verse of the
fortiesecond Chapter, and these things which are insert between them, do
contain but the occasion of the prophecy, to wit; when Godoliah was killed,
the rest of the Jews would have gone into Egypt, which Jeremiah forbids
them to do. And it came to pass ten days after, Chap. 42. 7, etc. This
should be joined with the first Verse of the fortieth Chapter, and all the rest
should be included in a parenthesis.

As we have spoken of the style of the Scripture in general, so let us observe
the style of some of the writers in particular. Esayes style differed much from
the style of Amos, he being a Courtiour, and he but a Neat-herd. So the style
of Ezekiel differed from the style of the rest of the Prophets: he calls
himself The Son of man, not because it is a Chaldee phrase, but because of
the excellent visions which he saw, therefore he is called the Son of man,
that is, an excellent man; as Jesus Christ in the New Testament is called The
Son of man, that is, an excellent man. So this is peculiar to John the
Evangelist, to call Christ the Son of God (...), for the Chaldees and the
Talmud usually call him so: John opposed himself to Ebion and Cerinthus two
Jews who denied the divinity of Christ, wherefore he has usually the word
(...), 1 Ioh. 7.5. which was frequent in the Chaldee paraphrast, and read often
by the Jews.

So there are some things peculiar to Paul; for he uses some words according
to the manner of the speech in Tarshish and Cilicia, as Collos. 2.18. (...) in
their language, signifies insidiose alteri praeripere palmam. So 1 Cor. 4.3.
Man's day according to the phrase of Tarshish, is put for the time of judgment;
because they had some appointed times for judgment.

The Conclusion of this is, here we may admire the wisdom of God, who gave
most excellent gifts to his Secretaries for the edification of his Church.
Moses was a man of a slow speech, God gave excellent gifts to his Secretaries,
for the good of his Church
and of a slow tongue, and Aaron must be his spokesman, Exodus 4. Yet Moses was
mighty in words and deeds, Act. 7.22. It is said of Paul that his bodily
presence was weak, but his letters were weighty, 2 Cor. 10.11. By his
preaching he converted many, from Jerusalem to Illiricum, Romans 15.19. but by
his letters he converted more, Paul converted more by his writing, than by his
preaching.
both in Europe Africa and Asia; such was the majesty and grace in his writing,
that they acknowledged it to be from the Lord.

EXERCITAT. XII. That the Hebrew Text is not corrupted.
Psalm. 119.140. Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loves it.
THe Church of Rome, The Church of Rome makes the vulgar Latin translation to
be canonical.
that they may advance the authority of the vulgar Latin translation, which
they have made canonical; do labor to disgrace the original Text, the
Hebrew and Greek, Controvers. 1. Gordonij. cap. 9.
holding that they are corrupt in many things.

Master James Gordon our Country man, observes four distinct periods of time.
The first period, he makes to be the Jews Synagogue before Christ came in
the flesh; he grants that all this time, the Hebrew Text was not corrupted by
the Jews. The second period of time he makes to be from the ascension of
Christ until the days of Hierome and Augustine, and he says, that in this
second period, the Jews went about to corrupt the translation of the Seventy:
because the Christians then began to use arguments taken out of that
translation against them, as Iustine Martyr testifies, writing against Tripho.
The third period he makes to be after the death of Saint Hierome, until the
time that the Talmud was composed and set together, and then he says, there
arose great contention betwixt the Oriental and Occidentall Jews: (the
Oriental Jews were those who dwelt upon the East side of Euphrates in Babylon
Media and Persia, What Jews were called oriental, and what occidentall.
those Peter called the Church at Babylon, 1 Pet. 5.13. The Occidentall Jews
were those to whom he wrote, Scattered abroad in Pontus Galatia, Cappadocia,
Asia, and Bithynia, 1 Pet. 1.1.) because of the diversity of their reading, and
corruptions in the Text. He says that the Jews met at Tiberias, Anno 508. and
there set down the Points; and made their Masora; to obviat this, that no more
corruption should enter into the Text. The fourth period he makes to be after
the Jews had met at Tiberias; they decreed that none should use any copy, but
such as were corrected by the Masoreth: and so from this time he freeth the
Text from corruption: but he labors much to prove that the Hebrew Text was
corrupt before, and that the vulgar Latin is sound and free from corruption,
which was translated by Saint Hierome under Pope Damasus; and so continued in
the Church of Rome. The Jews kept faithful the book of God without
corruption.


The Jews to whom The Oracles of God were committed, Romans 3.2. (therefore it
was called Their Law, Ioh. 8.17.) would they have corrupted their own
Evidents? Augustine calls the Jews Capsarios nostros, who faithfully kept
the book of God, and reserved it unto us without corruption, and he says,
Dispersos esse Iudaeos, infidelesut testarentur Scripturas esse veras. The
unbeleeving Jews were scattered through the world, that they might testify
the Scriptures to be true: The Jews numbered the Verses, Words and Letters of
the Bible.
and shall we think that the Jews would have corrupted the Text, who have
numbered the words, letters, and verses of the Bible: and R. Zaddias has
numbered the letters words and verses, and summed up all the verses at the end
of every book, and they have observed that all the letters are found in one
verse, Zeph. 3.8. as also four of the final letters: they carry such respect
to the Law, that if it but fall to the ground, they institute a fast for it.
They would write no language but in Hebrew letters.


The superstitious Jews at this day, are so careful to keep the letters and
words of the Law, that they will have neither Chaldee, Syriacke, nor Hebrew
words wrirten; but in Hebrew letters: and it greeved them when they saw in
Origens Hexupla, Vide Guiliel. Schiekardum de jure regio.
Hebrew words written in Greek Characters, when they saw the copy which was
presented to Alexander the Great, (...)
having the name Iehova still written in Golden letters, they were much greeved
at it, and when they see any thing changed in our copies now, in disdain they
call it, Hhomesh pesul shel gelahhim, that is, Pentateuchus rasorum Monachorum,
the Pentateuch of the shaven Monks.

The Jews after the death of Christ were dispersed among many Nations and they
never met together again: and albeit they would have corrupted the Scripture,
how could they have falsified all the Copies?

Bellarmin makes this objection to himself. Bellarm. lib. 2. Cap. 2. De verbo
dei.
Some men will say, that the Hebrew Text was corrupted after the days of Saint
Hierome and Augustine. He answers, that Augustins reasons serve for all
times against the corruption of the Hebrew Text: Serrarius in prolegom.
Bibliac^s.
And Serrarius acknowledges, that there is but small or no corruption in the
Hebrew Text, Corruption Physica Mathematica Moralis.

and he makes a threefold corruption. The first Physical, the second
Mathematical, and the third Moral. Physical corruption he makes to be this,
when it wants any member which it should have. Mathematical corruption he
makes to be this, when there are some faults in the print which we call
(...). And a moral corruption he makes to be this, when one of purpose goes
about to corrupt the Text, and in effect he comes to this, that the errors
which are found in the Text, are but errors in the print, and not in the
matter.

But now lately there is one risen up, called Morinus, who has set himself to
improve the original Hebrew Text, and to prefer the Samaritan to it as the
original.

Difference betwixt hebraeo-samaritana, and hebraeo-samaritano-samaritana, in
their Copies.
We must put a difference betwixt Hebraeo-Samaritana and
Hebraeo-samaritano-samaritana. Hebraeo-samaritana is that which Moses wrote
from the Lord and delivered to the Jews, it is called Hebraeo-samaritana;
because the Hebrew was written in the Samaritan Character at the first and so
kept still till after the captivity; and this we grant to be the first and
original writing by which the Church should be ruled.

But that this Hebraeo-samaritano-samaritana should be the first original;
that in no way must we grant, and the reasons are these.

Reasons to prove that the Samaritan copy is not the original.
First, the Samaritans were Idolaters they were brought out of Assyria by
Salmanasses, and they erected a false worship in Judea, for the which they were
hated by the people of God, Ioh. 4. They branded them always with these two
letters, Gnaijn Zain, that is, (...) pro (...) cultus alienus.
strange worship. The Lord concredited his oracles to his own people, Deuteronomy.
33.4. The Law is the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. Therefore the
Law was not committed to their custody, who were not Gods people, they had no
right to his inheritance.

Petrus de Valle brought it from Damascus.

The Samaritan differs as much from the original, as the Seventy do.
as the Seventy do, but none of them hold that the translation of the Seventy
is the original by which all others should be tried, why then should they give
this prerogative to the Samaritan Copy, to be the original? this Samaritan
Copy adds to the original Text which was The inheritance of the Jews,
Deuteronomy. 33.4. and diminishes also from it. It adds to the original Text,
Josh. 21. two Verses, 36.37. Verses. So Genesis 4. it adds a long speech or
conference betwixt Cain and Abel which is not in the original Text. So Targum
Hierosolymitanum supplyeth the same 28. verses here, which are not in the
original Hebrew Text, a conference betwixt Cain and Abel, whether there be any
providence of God or not? or whether there be any reward for the just, or
punishment for the wicked? Abel holds the affirmative, and Cain the negative
part. (...)
But this note of the Masoreth in the margent should not be read this ways,
Pesu pesuki bimtzegno pesuk. Viginti octo versus desiderantur in medio hujus
versus, There are twenty eight Verses wanting in the midst of this verse. But
it should be read this ways, (...)
Pesukim pasekin bimtzeghnoth pasuk, that is, There are twenty eight verses
whose sense ends in the midst of the verse: therefore when the Scripture
says that Cain talked with his brother, it was to persuade him to go out to
the field, and not that he had a long conference with him. Both the Samaritan
Copy then, and the Targum of Jerusalem wrong the Text as defective, putting in
these 28. verses which the Spirit of God never indicted.

As it adds to the original Hebrew Text, so it diminishes somethings from
it, Hos. 4.11. I have called my Son out of Egypt. These words are not in the
Samaritan Copy. So these words, Zach. 12.10. They shall behold him whom they
pierced.

Origin sets it not down in his Octupla, as he has done other
translations? and what is the reason that Hierome never cites it, nor
follows it in his translation, if it be the original?

Moses received from the Lord, and delivered to the people of God afterward,
as you may perceive in the page following, out of Exodus 31. from verse. 12. to
18.

Et dixit Iehova Mosi dicendo, Latin sic.
and tu al loquere filios Israel dicendo, nunc il la Sabbatha mea serua tote:
quia signum est in term and inter vos per generationes vestras ad cognosce^du^
quod ego Iehova sanctificans vos. et observate Sabbathum quia sanc tum erit

in die illo sabbathi morte morietur: and observanto filij Israel ipsum
sabbathum, celebrando sabbathum per generationes suas faedere aeter no interme
and inter filios Israel signum erit in aeternum: quia sex diebus fecit Iehoua
caelum et terram and in die septimo quievit et respiravit

Exodus 31.12. In English thus.
And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying 13. Speak thou also unto the Children of
Israel, saying, verily my Sabbaths shall ye keep: for it is a Sign between
me and you, throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am the Lord
that does sanctify you. 14. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore: for it is
holy unto you: every one that defiles it, shall surely be put to death, for
whosoever does any work therein, that Soul shall be cut off from amongst his
people, 15. Six days may work be done, but in the Seventh is the Sabbath of
rest, holiness to the Lord, whosoever does any work in the Sabbath day he
shall surely be put to death. 16. Wherefore the Children of Israel shall keep
the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a
perpetual Covenant. 17. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel
for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh
day he rested and was refreshed.

Observe the form of this writing of the Samaritans and ye shall find it to
be mere Cabbalisticall, by which they would find out the diverse readings, in
framing the lines, words and letters, and setting them down after such a
curious form, (...)
as the Cabbalists do, by their Gematrija, notaricon, and temura: that is, by
the number of letters, the diverse significations of them, and the diverse
situation and placing of them, they make diverse senses in the Scriptures, as
by elbham, and ethbhash; sometimes putting the last letters for the first, and
the first for the last; sometimes reading up and down; sometimes crosswayes,
and sometimes from the left hand to the right: this we may see in this example
of the Samaritan Copy, where they sum up the observation, the breach, and
punishment of the Sabbath in a round circle; which curiosity the Spirit of God
never used in writing the holy Scriptures.

Christ speaking of the original Text, and the perpetuity of the Law which we
have, he says, One jote, or one title of the Law shall not pass, in the
original it is, (...) answerable to the Hebrew Iod; and (...), which is not
properly translated, A tittle, as if it made a difference betwixt some letters,
(...)
as the top of Daleth from Resh: for the Syriacke calls it Sharat, incisura
vel incisio, the small lines which are in ones hand. The meaning is then, that
not one part of a letter, neither the least letter, nor any part of the least
letter shall perish, hence we may reason from Christ's words. In that copy
whereof the Lord speaks, (...) or Iod must be the least letter; but in the
Samaritan copy Iod is not the least, but the biggest of all the Letters:
therefore the Samaritan copy, is not that copy which Christ spoke of, Hebrae.
but the Hebrew as we may see by the difference of the Letters in the margent
here: (...) Samarit.
hence we may gather that this Samaritan letter was abolished in Christ's time,
and therefore we ought neither to embrace the copy nor the Characters, as
authenticke or original.

The Conclusion of this is, If the light that is in the body be darkness, how
great is that darkness, Matthew. 6.23. The Scriptures are the light of the
Church, and if the original Text were corrupted, Instrumenta gratiae.
conjuncta. remota.

how great were the darkness of the body; God has Conjuncta instrumenta, and
remota instrumenta gratiae. Remota instrumenta gratiae are the Preachers and
their writings, and they may be corrupted. But Conjuncta instrumenta gratiae
are the Prophets and Apostles and their writings, these the Lord kept from
error and corruption for the good of his Church.

EXERCITAT. XIII. That no Canonical book is perished.
Matthew. 5.18. Heaven and earth shall pass, one jote, or one tittle shall no
ways pass from the Law till all be fulfilled.
WHen a thing wants an essential part, this is the greatest want. Secondly,
when it wants an integrall part, this is likewise a great defect. Defectus
Partis essentialis partis integratis ornamenti accidentalis.
And thirdly, when it wants accidental ornaments. When the soul is
separated from the body, here is a separation of the essential parts. When a
man wants a hand or a foot, then he wants an integrall part. And when he
wants his clothes, he wants some ornaments.

No book in the Scripture wants any essential part.
There is no book in the Scripture that wants any essential part; for the
Law and the Gospel which are essential parts, Vide Iunium in Iudam, and
Perkins reformed Catholic.
are found in every book.

Secondly, the Scripture wants no integrall part since the Canon was sealed,
before the Canon was sealed they had as much as served for their infancy: but
after that it was sealed the whole Canon was complete, and none of those
Books perished. Gods care in preserving the Scriptures.


Great was the care which the Lord had to preserve the Scriptures. First, he
commanded the Levites to take the book of the Law written by Moses, and to
put it in the side of the Arc of the covenant of the Lord, Deuteronomy. 31.26.

Secondly, the Lord commanded the King, when he should sit upon the Throne of
his kingdom to write a Copy of this Law, Deuteronomy. 17.18. and the Jews add
further, that he was bound to write out two copies, one which he should keep
in his treasury, and another which he should carry about with him; and they
say moreover, if Printing had been found out then, yet he was bound to write
them out with his own hand.

Thirdly, the Lord commanded the Prophets to write their visions upon Tables,
(...) vocant Graeci.
and to make them plain, Habak. 2.2. Esaias 8.1. and the Seventy read it, to be
graven upon the bush tree, which is a sort of wood that corrupts not, and it
will preserve that which is written upon it and it were to the worlds end.

Books necessary for the Church albeit lost, yet they were found again.
Fourthly, when any book which was necessary for the use of the Church was
lost; the Lord had a care that that book should be found again, as the book
of the law found by Hilkiah, 2 King 22.8. Or the Lord endited it anew again,
when it was lost; as when Iehojakim cut the roll of the lamentations of
Jeremy, yet the Lord inspired him a new again to indite this book to his
Scribe Baruch, Iere. 36.32. because he thought it necessary still for the
Church: therefore he would not have it to perish.

Fifthly, in that general destruction which the Babylonians made at Jerusalem,
burning their houses, and robbing them of their goods; The Israelites kept the
musical instruments in the captivity, to put them in mind of the worship of
God.
yet as Hierome and Basil observe well, it was a special providence of God
that they should leave to those captives, their instruments of Music,
wherewith they used to serve God in the Temple: that they might preserve some
memory of their former worship, they brought these instruments to Babel with
them, Psalm. 137.2. we hung our harpes on willowes. If the Lord had such a care
of these instruments to have them preserved for his praise, much more care had
he to have the Scriptures preserved; which taught them to worship: and he who
had a particular care of the parts of the Scripture, before it was complete,
and numbreth the hairs of our heads, Matthew. 10.30. and the stars of the
heavens, Psalm. 147.4. will he not have a special care that none of these
Books should perish which are canonical?

That fable of Esdras then is to be rejected, lib. 4. The fable of Esdras
rejected.
cap. 4.23. So cap. 14.21. to the 24. verse, he shows how the book of God
was lost in the Captivity, and that Esdras the Scribe, by holy inspiration
wrote it all anew again: but this is false, see we not how Daniel read out of
the prophecy of Jeremy, how long the captivity should last, Dan. 2.9. The
book of God then was not lost in the captivity, and written anew again by
Esdras, Esdras wrote nothing of the Scriptures but only set the books in
order.
but only he set the books in order after the captivity, and nihil ad (...)
fecit sed ad (...). He did nothing in correcting the book of God, but only
set it down in order.

But we read often times in the Scriptures of many Books wanting now, which
were extant before; as the Books of the battles of the Lord, Number. 21.14.

(...)
By this it cannot be inferred that any canonical book is perished; for this
word Sepher, signifies a relation, as well by word, as by write. Secondly,
although we grant that it was a written book, yet it will not follow that it
was a holy Book. Thirdly, although we grant that it was an holy book, yet it
will not follow that it was a canonical book. The books of the Chronicles of
the Kings of Judah and Israel were but civil records, Some things written by
the Prophets not as they were Prophets.
and belonged nothing to the canon of the Scriptures.

Secondly, some books that were written by the Prophets, were not written by
them as they were Prophets. Solomon wrote of Herbs, Trees and Plants, 1 King.
4.33. But what books were these? They were but books of things which were
under the Moon and of things corruptible, and because they served not for the
edification of the Church afterward, Hezekiah buried Salomons books of
physic.
therefore the Lord suffered them to perish. Suidas says, that the book which
Solomon wrote of Physic, was affixed upon the gate in the entry of the
Temple; and because the people trusted too much in it, neglecting the Lord (as
Asa put his trust in the Physicians, 2 Chro. 13.) therefore Hezekiah caused to
pull away this book, (...)
and bury it. And the Talmud says, that Hezekiah did two memorable things.
First, Ganaz Sepher rephuoth. Abscondit librum medicinarum, He hid the books
of Physic which Solomon had written. (...)
And secondly, Cathath nahhash hannehhushoth shegnashe Moshe, Comminuit aeneum
serpentem quem fecerat Moses, He brake the brazen Serpent which Moses made.

Solomon spoke three thousand Proverbes, 1 King. 4.32. yet of all these
Proverbes scarce eight hundred are put in the Canon. Some of these Proverbes
the servants of Hezekiah King of Judah copied out, Prove. 25.1. And as they saw
the King their master bury Salomons book, which he knew was hurtful to the
Church: Salomoni Proverbs and Songs, which were not profitable to the Church
perished.
so those servants copied out these Proverbes which were profitable for the
Church, whereas the rest perished. So Solomon wrote a thousand and five Songs;
of all which Songs, (...) est utriusque numeri quae vel quod.
the Lord made choice but of one to be insert in the Canon, which is called the
Song of Songs, or canticum canticorum quae Salomonis rather then canticum
canticorum quod Salomonis, it was the most excellent Song of all Salomons
Songs, rather then the excellentest Song compared with other Songs.

But all books written by the^ for the whole Church none of them are perished:
as the Prophesies of Nathan Ahija, and Iddo. For Burgensis observes well upon,
1 Chro. 29. That the first book of Samuel is holden to be written by Samuel
himself. So the second Book of Samuel, and the second book of the Kings were
written by Nathan and Gad, who lived with David and Solomon, and wrote until
the death of Solomon, then Iddo and Ahija wrote the history following of
Jeroboam interlacing somethings of Solomon and Rehoboam.

Chron. 29.29. Now the acts of David the King, first and last behold they are
written in the book of Samuel the Seer, and in the book of Nathan the
Prophet; and in the book of Gad the Seer, with all his reign and his might
and the times that went over him, and over Israel and all the Kingdoms of the
Countries. But these words cannot be understood of the books of Samuel; for
we read not in these books, what David did abroad in these Countries:
therefore some other books must be understood here, written by Gad and Nathan,
which are not extant.

David did in Israel, are set down in the book; of Samuels but also the
things which he did abroad in other Countries, as against Zoba King of
Hadadezzar, Hierom. in Esa. 13.
against the Moabites, and against Tobh King of Hemath. And where it is said
over all the kingdoms of the countries, it is the manner of the Scripture (as
Hierome marketh) by the whole Countries, to understand the next adjacent
countries whereof it speaks; (...)
and therefore in the original it is, Haaratzoth, Of that carth.

Chro. 33 19. The prayer of Manasseh and how God was entreated of him, and all
his sin, and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places, and
set up groves and graven images before he was humbled: behold they are written
among the saying of the Seers, or Hosai. But in the whole book of the Kings
there is no mention made of his affliction, or of the cause which moved him to
repent or of his prayers which he made to God in time of his affliction: then
this book of the prophet is not now extant. So the acts of Baasha, Zimri, and
Omri are they not written in the Books of the Chronicles of Israel, 1 Kings
16.5. and 27. But nothing concerning their acts are found in the books of the
Kings, or in the Chronicles: therefore those books are perished, when the
Scriptures remit us to those books, it gives us to understand that these
books are worthy to be trusted, as written by the Seers of God: neither does
the Scripture cite them, as it does some short sentences out of the Heathen
Poets. The Apostle says of those Poets, that they said the truth, Tit. 1.13.
But the Spirit of God remitteth us to these books, that we may be fully
instructed by them in the whole truth of the Acts of those Kings.

Some prophesies of the Prophets were not written.
and the prophesies of those, who prophesied from the days of Eli, to David,
as some of Asaph Heman and Ieduthun. Secondly, all the things which were
written by the Seers, were not written by them as Seers: Solomon wrote many
things, which he wrote not as a Prophet, and so did David. Thirdly, Somethings
written by the Prophets profitable for the Church then, but not profitable now.
many things which they wrote then as Seers, and were profitable to the Church
for that time, were not profitable for the Church now: and the Spirit of God
remitted them then to the civil records and to some prophesies which were then
extant, but are perished now; because now they were not necessary for the
Church: but all these things which the Lord endited to them by his Spirit and
which he thought to be necessary for his Church, to be the Canon and rule of
our faith, all those the Lords watchful eye has kept and preserved, that none
of them are perished.

The Conclusion of this is: Judah and Israel, both in whole and in parts,
although they were but Shepherds, and banished men. And the Church would rather
spend her best blood, then she would part with that precious Jewel or any
part of it: therefore they called those who delivered the book of God to the
persecuting Tyrants, Traditores.

EXERCITAT. XIIII. That the points were not originally with the Letters from
the beginning.
Neh. 8.8. So they read in the Book, the Law of God distinctly, and gave the
sense, and caused them to understand the reading of the Law.
WE have shown that the Scriptures are not corrupt, and that no essential or
integrall part is wanting in the holy Scriptures: Now it rests to show that
the Points, the accidental ornaments were not from the beginning.

The Jews who are faithful keepers, but bad interpreters of the Scriptures,
interpret these words, Nehe. 8.8. (...)
after this manner, vaijkren bassepher betorath, They read in the book of the
Law, this they expound, to be the litterall sense, (...)
which Ezra gave. Mephorash, distinctly that is, (...)
adding the Points and distinctions. Veshom Sh^cel, Appenentes intellectum, and
gave the sense, that is, he added the Targum or paraphrase to it. (...)
Vajabhinu bammikra and caused them to understand the reading of the Law, that
is, he added the Kabbala. But this is a false Gloss, Ezra read the Law to
them, and gave them not only the grammatical sense, but also the spiritual
and true meaning of the words; he neither added points nor Targum, or Kabbala
to it. The points were not then from the beginning, as may be seen by these
reasons following.

Moses wrote the Law. But to these ancient Characters there is no vowell
subjoyned as we may see in the form of the Shekell set down by Arias
Montanus, Beza, and Villalpand upon Ezekiel.

(...)
and they have most exactly written and rouled up this book, which is the
chief book in their estimation, and whereof they account more then of any
other Hebrew Bible; yet there is neither Point nor Accent in this book, but
only Consonants. This may be seen also in their ancient bills of divorce
wherein are neither Points nor Accents: Therefore the Points were not from the
beginning.







Seventy: for when the Seventy read the Hebrew Text wanting the Points, they
differed very far from the Hebrew in many things. (...) baculus. (...) lectus*
The difference of their reading arose from this; because the Hebrew Text
wanted the Points. Example, Genesis 47.31. and Israel bowed himself, gnal rosh
hamitta, upon his beds head. But the Apostle follows the translation of the
Seventy translating it, (...) Volumen.
He bowed upon the top of his rod, Heb. 11.21. So Psalm. 40.7. (...) caput,
cranium.
for Megilla the Seventy read gilgoleth, in capite libri, for in volumine
libri: because they wanted the Points, and the Apostle followed this reading.

(...)
The fifth reason is taken from, Ketibh volo keri, when the words are written one
way, and read another. This diversity of reading and writing arose because the
letters wanted the Points from the beginning: this made them to read one way
and write another way.



Talmud. They write, (...) masculus
that Ioab killed his master, because he taught him to read Zacar Masculus,
(...) memoria.
for Zecer Memoria, and so made him to spare the females of the Amalekites,
whereas he should have blotted out their memory and killed them all. Now if
the points had been from the beginning, then Ioabs master could not have
taught him, to have read Zacar for Zecer.

The Points were not from the beginning then, but found our afterward by the
Masorath.

(...)
There were three sorts of teachers, amongst the Jews. The first was (...), who
gathered the traditions of the Fathers together; (...) vel
such were the Pharisees. (...)
The second were the Sopherim afterward called the Masoreth: these observed
the letters and words in the reading. (...)
The third sort were the Midroseth, the Cabbalists, who expounded the
Scriptures allegorically. The Scribes were from Moses time, who taught the
people to read the Law, because the Law wanted the Points: and Christ calls
these The learned Scribes, and says to one of them; How read thou? Luke
10.26. Shammai and Hillel the first of the Sects of the Scribes and Pharisees.
But afterward Shammai and Hellel were the first of the Scribes and Pharisees,
who were the original of these sects. Shammai was the first of these Scribes
who drew out the Cabbalisticall readings, and Hillel was the first who gathered
their traditions together.

Because the Text wanted the Vowels before the Masorets time, hence arose these
diverse readings marginall and Textuall; here we must take heed of two
errores. The first is of those who hold, Two errors to be shunned concerning
the Marginall and Text reading.
that both the Textuall and Marginall reading were from the beginning, and both
authenticke and original from Moses. The second error which we must shun, is
this, that the marginall reading implies some corruption, where as it serves
for illustration of the Text.

There is but small difference betwixt the Marginall and the line reading.
There are three sorts of reading. The first is (...), (...).
when there is no difference at all in the words. (...).
The second is (...) when there is some small difference in the reading. (...).
And the third is (...), when there is a contrary reading. Now for (...), we
may see it in the original Text it self, as 2 Samuel 22. and Psalm. 18. the same
argument is handled almost word by word in both these places, there is some
diversity of words only: for 2 Samuel 22.43. (...) Evacuare.
It is Adikem, I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, but Psalm. 18.42.
it is Arikem, (...) Comminuere.
I did cast them out as the mire in the streets. Here is but small difference,
Daleth is only changed into Resh, the sense is all one. mutatur in
So 2 Samuel 22.11. and Psalm. 18.11. So 2 Samuel 22.27. and Psalm. 18.26. So 2 Samuel
22.8. and Psalm. 18.9. here is (...), The Marginall and the Text reading make
not a contrary but a diverse reading.
but not (...). So the Marginall reading, and the Text reading makes not a
contrary reading, but a diverse reading: therefore ye shall see that the
Translaters follow sometimes the Marginall reading in their first translations,
(...) illi
as Iunius 2 King 8.10. in his first translation, he says abi; (...) non.
dic ei, but in this second translation he says, abi, dic non, So Ezr. 4.2. In
his first edition, sacrificabimus eidem which is the marginall reading, (...)
fecit.
but in his second translation, (...) december.
non sacrificabimus alteri which is in the Text. Example, 3. 1 King 22.49.
Iehosaphat prepared shipes, Translaters sometime join both the marginall and
text reading together.
Gnasha fecit; but in his second translation Iehosaphat made december naves which
is in the Text. So Prove. 31.4. Eccles. 3.4. Ier. 2.20. and 5.8. He follows
Ketibh in his last Edition, that is, as it is written and not read in all these
places. And sometimes ye shall see them, join both the Marginall and Text
reading together. Psalm. 22.17. They Lion like dug. So the Chaldee Paraphrast
and the Seventie reads it. So Iunius. (Exodus 21.8. If she please not her
Master who has not betrothed her unto himself, (...) non sibi.
non sibi) joyneth lo, lo, (...)
both together, both the Text and Marginall reading. (...) voluit est ketibh
So Josh. 8.12. The line reading has gnir, (...) custodivit est keri
vrbs, and the Marginall reading has Hai, and he joyneth them both together
vrbs Hai. So Prove. 23.26. Let thine eyes observe my ways. Ratza, and Natzar,
he joyneth them both together, studiose custodivit. So Eze. 22.16. (...)
They join them both together. So 1 King. 22.18. the Tigurin joyneth them both
together. The Masoreth put the vowels some times in the text, and the
consonants in the margent.
and the English join them both together, Prove. 19.7. They are wanting to him.

In these diverse readings set down by the Masoreth, sometimes the Points are
put in the Text and the Consonants in the Margent, (...)
as Ier. 31.39. Behold the day says the Lord. Here is a blanke in the Text,
the vowels are only set down and the word Baim, is understood by the Points
of it, which are in the Text, and so it is Baim, although it be not expressly
written in the Text. The reason why they set the consonants in the Margent and
the vowels in the Text, was to signify, that they inclined rather, to follow
the Marginall reading than the Text, and yet not to exclude the Text reading:
therefore they set the vowels in the Text. The Masoreth put not points to a
word which they think does redound.


Again, when the Masoreth think that some words abound, they set down the
Consonants of the word in the Text, but they point not the word, which they
would have to be be omitted, Example, Ier. 51.3. (...)
Against him that bended, let the Archer bend his bow. El ijddroch ijddroch
hadderech. And thus the Masoreth keep us that we go not amiss, (...)
and their observations are a hedge to the Law: therefore the Jews say, Sejag
lahhochma shethea, Silence is the hedge of wisdom, for when a man holds his
peace he is then thought to be wise. So they say Megnasheroth sejag legnosher,
(...)
Tithes are the hedge of our riches, and therefore pay thy Tithes and be rich.
So Nedarim sejag liphrishoth, (...)
vows are the hedge of the first fruits. Lastly, they say, Masoreth sejag
latora, (...)
that the Masoreth is the hedge to the Law. By great pains and wonderful care
those Masoreth, (...)
numbered the letters and words of the Scripture, that none of them might
perish: and as in a well constituted family, (...)
the master of the family takes a note of all the things in his house from the
greatest to the least: (...)
So did these Masoreth of the whole Law: therefore the Hebrews say, Gnim
shimmureth hatorah, that is, (...)
the study of the Masoreth was Cum conservationelegis, for the preserving of
the Law from corruption.

These diverse readings make not up diverse senses but help us better to come
by the right sense of the Scripture. Diverse reading, make not up diverse sense
in the Scripture.
When it is objected to us by the Church of Rome that we have not the true
meaning of the Scriptures, because of our diverse translations: Our Divines
answer, that these diverse translations make not diverse senses in the
Scriptures; for the sense is still one and the same: but these diverse
translations help us only, to come to the true meaning of the Scriptures, and
so we must use these marginall and line readings, as we use these
interpretations. When we see a blanke left in the the Text, and supplied in the
Margent; this adds nothing to the Text, as a word added sometime by a
translatour, adds nothing to the Text: So when the Masoreth put another word
in the Margent, A word set down for explanation adds nothing to the text.
which is not in the Text; that word is set down only for explanation, The
meaning of the text is known by the antecedent and consequent.
and it adds nothing to the Text. We take up the meaning of the Text, by the
antecedent, and consequent, Example, Prove. 4.3. Tender and young was I, (...)
Liphni, before my Mother; but in the Margent it is, Tender and young was I,
Libhni, amongst the Sons of my Mother: for Solomon had more brethren 1 Chronicles.
3.6. But these readings may stand, he was tender and young before his Mother,
and best beloved of all his Mothers Sons.

The Conclusion of this is. A certain Jew gave God thanks for four things.
Jerusalem and not at Pambiditha. ex Tilmideni. cap. 7
Thirdly, that he said Shibbeth and not Sibboleth. Fourthly, that he needed
not the helps of Tiberias, meaning the Points and Accents. But we who are not
natural Jews should be thankful to God; because we have these helps to
further us in the reading.

EXERCITAT. XV. Of the means which God uses to make the Scripture plain unto
us.
1 Cor. 14.11. If I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that
speaks a Barbarian, etc.
THere are three special means by which God makes the Scriptures plain unto
us. Three special means for making the Scriptures plain.
The first is translation of the Scripture. The second is paraprasing of the
Scripture, and the third is the interpretation of the Scripture. What things
are necessary for translation.


In the Translation of the Scripture consider, first, what is a Translation.
Secondly, the necessity of translation. Thirdly, what things a Translator
should observe, and what things he should shun. Fourthly, who they were who
translated the Scriptures. Fifthly, the authority of the translation of the
Seventy. Sixthly, the authority of the vulgar Latin translation.

First, what is a translation. What is translation.
We translate when we change out of one language into another, and it is called
(...) or (...). If the Translator consider the words a part, then it is called
(...) or (...): there is great force in the words, and therefore the Translator
must observe them; Plato was wont to call Socrates, (...), seu obstetricem;
because when he sought out the words, then he brought forth the truth. The
necessity of translation proved by sundry reasons.


Secondly, let us consider the necessity of Translation without a Translation
we can not understand a strange language, but it is barbarous to us.

Reasons proving the necessity of translation.

unknown to the Jews, Words in the old Testament, unknown to the Jews, are
interpreted.
it uses to interpret them. Example, Purim was a Persicke word unknown to the
Jews; therefore the Holy Ghost interprets it, calling it a Lot. So the
Evangelists writing, in Greek, and having sundry Hebrew and Chaldee words,
they expound them in Greek as Siloe, that is, sent, Ioh. 9.7. Abba interpreted
by Pater, Romans 8. So Tabitha kumi, by interpretation, Daughter arise, Mark.
5.21. So Thomas called Didymus. (...).
See Mark. 7.34. and Act. 1.27. and Revela. 1.7. amen by nai, So Abaddon be
(...), Reve. 9.11. So Rabboni by Master, Ioh. 20.16. why does the holy Ghost
interpret these names? but to teach us that he would have the Scriptures
translated into known tongues, that the people might understand them.

Elymas by Magus, Act. 13.8. But Elymas the Sorcerer (for so his name is by
interpretation) withstood them, Seeing all translations should be in a more
known tongue, but Magus, is as obscure as Elymas?

Magus was first a Persicke word, but afterward it was well enough known to
the Jews, The Persians are called Elamites.
Elymas was but a part of Persia, so called from Elam the son of Sem:
therefore the Persians are called Elamites, Act. 2. and Luke interprets
Elymas by Magus, as by that which was well enough known to the Jews, (...)
magus a (...) formare vel fingere.
and to us now; for we take Magus commonly for a Magitian: the Arabic
translateth Magus, by Hhartom, from Hharat, fingere or formare; because the
Magitians draw figures and circles when they conjure.

Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani, Matthew. 27.46.

Why the prayer of Christ upon the cross is set down in Hebrew.
The Evangelist does this, that we may perceive the bitter mock that the Jews
used against Christ, saying, He calls upon Elias, for in no other language
the mock will so appear.

Secondly, Unknown tongues were a curse pronounced against the people of the
Jews.
it was a curse pronounced against the people of God, when the Lord should send
strangers against them who should speak unto them in an unknown tongue, Esa.
28.11. So it is a curse to the Church, as the Apostle applies it, to speak to
the people the mysteries of their salvation in an unknown tongue, 1 Cor. 14.21.

Every man heard them speak in his own language, Act. 2.6. And to some he
gave the tongues, but not the interpretation of them; God gave the gift of
tongues to some, and to others he gave the interptetation of them.
but lest the people should not understand these languages, he gave to others
the gift of interpretation, 1 Cor. 12.10. but the Church of Rome studieth of
purpose to keep the Scriptures in an unknown tongue, and thinks, that
thereby the minds of the people are more affected and stirred up to devotion.
A Translator must take heed, ex quo, and in quod vertit.


The third thing to be considered in a translation is what a Translator should
observe and what he should eschew in his translation. A Translator must
observe Ex quo vertit and in quod vertit, or Terminus a quo and terminus ad
quem, and he must consider first the sense, and then the words; Simile. He must
have the worth of the words in his translation.
he must look first to the sense and see that he carry it with him, and next
to the words; and even as Merchants when they sell their wares they look for
the worth of their wares in Money: So should a Translator in his translation
see that he have the worth, or meaning of the sense in his Translation, he
must consider first the aptness of the phrase into which he is to translate
it, A Translator should consider the aptness of the phrase.
and he is not (...) servilly to follow it. Example, the Hebrew says, I will
multiply thy seed as the sand upon the lip of the Sea, Genesis 22.17. But our
language says upon the Sea shore. So the Hebrew says we must not eat with
common hands, but we say, with unwashen hands: now in this metaphrase changing
one phrase into another, the Translator must take good heed.

A Translatour may add a word where the sense bears it.
Secondly, where the sense bears it a Translator may add a word without any
hurt to the Text. The original Text it self, affects sometime more brevity
and in other places supplyeth this brevity. As, 2 Samuel 6.6. Vzzia put fourth to
the Arc, it is expounded more at large, 1 Chronicles. 13.9. He put forth his hand
to the Arc, So 2 Chronicles. 10.9. is expounded by 2 Chronicles. 13.9. At more length.
The holy Ghost adds a word for illustation where the sense bears it, Deuteronomy.
27.26. Cursed be he that confirms not the words of this Law to do them; But
the Apostle Galat. 3.10. Cursed in every one that continues not in all things
which are written in the book of the Law to do them. So a Translator may add
a word for illustration when the sense bears it, Genesis 3. Have thou eaten of
the tree of which I forbad thee to eat? the Seventy add, Have thou eaten of
the tree which I (only) forbad thee to eat?

Mark. 5.4. interprets tabitha kumi arise daughter, how adds he here,
(...) tibi dico?

A Translater must not add of his own to the text.
should be in a parenthesis.

A Translator must add nothing of his own in his translation, Exodus 16.15.
The vulgar translation adds something which is not in the original: when the
children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, what is this? These words
(what is this) are not the words of the holy Ghost: (...) interrogat apud
Chaldaeos, sed non apud Hebraeos.
for Man signifies, prepared or ready, and therefore it should be interpreted,
this is ready or prepared meat. So Exodus 12.11. they translate Phase, id est
transitus, it should not be translated, id est transitus, but transitus, it is
the Lords Passover.

A Translator must not affect (...), that is, (...), is an affecting of new
words.
newness of words: those do contrary to that of Solomon, Prove. 22.28. Remove
not the ancient marks which thy fathers have set. This was the fault of
Castalio who translated Sequester, for Mediator, Genius, for Angelus,
Insundere, for Baptizare, Histrio, for Hypocrita, Respublica, When the matter
requires, a new word may be used in a translation.
for Ecclesia, and such. We are not so bound to words, but when the matter
requires, a new word may be used. Nicephorus tells of Spiridion, when he
heard the word (...), read for (...); he rose and went out of the Church in a
chafe: so another could not abide Cucurbita, for Hedera, Jonas 4.6. Esa. 45.9.
Woe be to him that striveth with his Maker: let the potsheard strive with the
potsheards of the earth. Hierome has it, testa de Samijs, he translated it
terra Samiae; there is not such a word in the original, neither were these
vasa Samiae, in use, (...), is he who hunteth for strange words that is not in
use.
in the days of the Prophet; yet because these vessels were in use in his
time, he uses it in his translation: neither can he be thought to be (...) a
hunter of new words for this. So Nahum 3.8. Art thou better than No. But
Hierome translateth it, art thou better than Alexandria: because in his time No
was called Alexandria: being built anew by Alexander. (...), pigmenta oratoria,
the flowing speeches of Orators.


A Translatour must not use a great circuit of words, or the floorishing
speeches of Rhetoric in his translation; Simile.
for as men pouring wine out of one Vessel into another, take heed that the
vent be not too great; for then the wine would corrupt: So the Translator if
he take too much liberty to himself he may corrupt the sense.

Words that are transeunt, (...).
passing and received in all languages should not be translated: as Sabbath,
Amen, Halleluia, Hosanna. So Iam. 5.4. and the cries of them which have reaped,
Simile.
are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath. For as some sort of coin
passes in all countries so do some words. Secondly, some words which come not
originally from the Hebrew but from the Greek, yet they should be kept still
untranslated, as Phylacterie, Many Latin words made Greek in the new
Testament.
Tetrach and such.

There are many Latin words which are made Greek in the New Testament, and
these are to be translated. For as Daniel borrowed some words from the Ionians
who dwelt in Asia minor and made Chaldee words of them, as sabucha from
sambucha an instrument which they played upon. Latin words which are made
Greek, should be translated.
Angaria a Persicke word made Greek, Matthew. 5.41. So Gazophylacium, all these
should be translated: So the Latin words which are made Greek should be
translated, as (...) Census, Matthew. 17.25. (...) Centurio, quadrans (...),
Matthew. 5.26. So Colonia (...), Act. 16.12. So custodia (...), Matthew. 26. So
Legio, linteum, Macellum, membrana, modius, praetorium, (...), Matthew. 27.
sudarium, Luke 19.20. Spiculator, Matthew. 6.27. Semicinctum, Act. 19.12. and
Sicarius, Act. 21.38. All these should be translated. (...)


Words appropriate should not be translated to any other use, but unto the use,
to which they are appropriated. Example, Rachab received into her house (...).
A Translator cannot translate it Angels (because that word is appropriated to
the blessed Angels) but Messengers. Example 2. Phil. 2.25. Epaphroditus, (...),
a Translator cannot translate it your Apostle (for that word is appropriated to
the the Apostles) but your Messenger. So Act. 19.23. (...), a Translator cannot
translate it, The Church was confused, because this word Church is appropriated
to the meeting of the Saints of God for his worship; but only, The assembly
was confused.

Words not appropriate should not be appropriate.
So words not appropriat should not be appropriat as the Church of Rome do
appropriat this word Synagoga to the Old Testament, and Ecclesia to the New
Testament; but Synagoga is said of the Church of the New Testament, and
Synagoga and Ecclesia are promiscuusly taken. So this word (...) should not be
translated Gods Clergy, but Gods inheritance, 1 Pet. 5.3. This word which is
common to all Gods people, should not be appropriated to a few.

Words that are degenerate, Words degenerate, should not be used in a
translation.
we cannot use them in a translation. Example, 1 Cor. 14.16. He that occupies
the room (...), it cannot be translated Idiot here (unless we would beg
them for fools,) but Unlearned. So the word (...) is a degenerate word in our
language, and taken in an evil sense, we cannot translate it, the Magitians
came from the East, Vide Rainoldum contra Heart.
but the Wise men came from the East, Matthew. 2.1. So (...) should not be
translated Priest, for the word Priest now is taken for a sacrifycing Priest:
and God himself would not be called Baal, but ishi because Baal was a word
degenerate and given to Idols, Hos. 2. So (...) at the first was he that had
the charge of the corn which the Latins called Epulo, but now both are
degenerate. So should not a degenerate word be used in a translation.

Words that are proper should not be translated as appellatives or contra, 2 Samuel 23.8. Words that are proper, are not to be translated as appellatives.
The Tachmonite that sat in the seat chief amongst the Captains, this same
was Hadino the Eznite, but 1 Chro. 11.11. Iashobeam an Hachmonite, the chief
of the Captains he lift up his Spear against three hundred. It was a proper
name of a man, as we may see, 1 Chro. 27.2. And therefore should not be
translated, he sat in judgment. (...) gratum erat huic hastaeto.
So Adino and Eznite are not proper names, but are to be translated thus, His
delight was to lift up his spear against three hundred. So Josh. 14.15. The
Vulgar translation has it thus, This is Adam who was buried amongst four.
Adam here is an appellative name and not proper; therefore the article He, (...)
is put before it. Secondly, he adds Situs est, which is not in the
original. Thirdly, he translateth Arba, Four, which is a proper name here and
hence came that fable, that four men and their wives are buried there, Adam
and Eve, Abraham and Sara, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Lea. So Act. 19.9.
Schola Tyranni, cannot be translated, in the School of a Tyrant, but In the
School of Tyrannus, because it is not an appellative but a proper name.

(...).
Words that are Mediae significationis, a Translator must take heed how he
translateth the^. Example 1. Esa. 3. 2. I will take away your Kosem from you.
The Translator cannot translate it here, (...)
your Soothsayer but your Prudent. So Ioshu. 13.22. Balaam also the son of
Beor the Kosem, did the children of Israel slay. It cannot be translated,
Balaam the Prudent, but Balaam the Soothsayer.

Another example gnarum is called subtle or crafty and also prudent or wise,
(...)
Genesis 3.1. the Serpent was gnarum, it cannot be translated, More wise than any
beast of the field; but More crafty and Prove. 1.4. It cannot be said to give
Subtlety, but Wisdom to the simple. So Matthew. 10.16. It cannot be said, be
ye Crafty as Serpents, but Wise as Serpents.

Vide Simeon de Muis, in Psalm. 9.
A third example, Sheol signifies both the grave and hell; when it is set down
without He locale, then it ever signifies the grave, (...) locale.
but when He locale, is put to it and the godly, (...) et
are said to go Lesheolah, then it signifies the lowest grave, as Psalm.
86.13. But when Sheol has He locale joined to it, (...) quomodo differuut.
and the wicked are said to go Lesheolah, then it signifies the Hell, and it
should be translated, They went down to hell, (...)
Number. 16.30.

A fourth example, Pethi is taken in an evil sense for Foolishness, as Prove.
1.22. and in a good sense for Simplicity, as Psalm. 116.6.

Words (...) (and as the Jews say Quae nullum habent fratrem) they should be
warily taken heed unto, how they be translated, (...) vel (...).
(...)
because there is not another word to clear them by. Example, Number. 24. 3. Hag
gebher shethum hagnaijn Vir apertis oculis. The Masoreth put this mark (...)
ubi notant vocem aliquam semel reperiri, and quae bis occurrunt, they call them
(...) that is, gemellj.
It is not taken in this sense in all the Scriptures but only here: in other
places of the Scripture it is taken in a contrary signification for Shutting of
the eyes.

Another example, Mat. 13.25. The enemy came and sowed, (...), it should not be
translated Tares or Fitches, but Evil seed, (...) is that which we call
blasted Corn, or the deaf ears, which grow up with the good Corn, and
cannot be discerned from the good Corn until the Harvest; and then it
proves naught: (...) quid.
for Fitches and Tares may be presently discerned, and pulled up; the one
signifies the Hypocrites and the other Heretics. And where it is said, His
enemy came and sowed Tares, Vide Suidam in (...) and Sculteti Exercitationes.
The parable must be understood thus, that the enemy corrupted that seed which
seemed to be good seed: In a parable we must not stretch every word, but
only look to the maine scope; for then we may gather that the wicked in Hell
have tongues now, and the glorified have bodies now in the Heavens. (...) quid.


A third example. Mark. 14.3. She brought a box (...) Of liquid nard, it
should be translated Of upright and perfect nard: for according to the phrase
of the Seventy, that is (...) which excels in the own kind of it, (...)
and so they call the Temple of Solomon (...) An excellent Temple. The Syriack
has it Pis from the Greek word (...).

The fourth thing that is to be considered here, are they who translated the
Scriptures. Lib. 1. controvers. cap. 5. contra Bellar.
Iunius says that there are twelve translations of the Bible into the Greek,
There were twelve translations of the Bible into Greek.
the first translation of the Ptolemies was Lagiana which Ptolemaus Lagi caused
to be translated. The next translation, was the translation of the Seventy,
which was translated in the days of Ptolomeus Philadelpus, the third was
Herodiana in the time of Ptolomie the last, the fourth that of Aquila, the
fifth of Symmachus, the sixth of Theodosion, the seventh Hierichuntina found in
Jericho, the eight Nicapolitana found at Nicapolis, the ninth Origenaria,
translated by Origin, the tenth Luciana translated by the martyr Lucian, the
eleventh Hesychiana, translated by Hesychius, the twelfth Exhieromineana
translated out of Ieromes translation into Greek.

There is such a profunditie in the Scriptures, that it is unpossible for any
Interpreter to sownd the depth of them, but as it fares with the oil of the
widow, 2 King. 4. So long as the children brought vessels, so long there was
oil to fill them: So there is such plenty in the Scriptures, when they have
filled the wits and understanding of the best; yet there is sufficient for
these who go about to translate anew again, to be drawn out of them.

The cause of the difference in translations.
And it is no marvel why they differ so in their translations, for one root
has so many significations sometimes, that all the Translators cannot agree in
one. Let us take but this one example, Job. 4.18. Pagninus translateth it, In
angelis suis ponit lumen. 2. In angelis suis indidit vesaniam, Tigurin. 3. In
Angelis suis ponit lucem exactissimam, vatablus. 4. In angelis suis posuit
gloriationem, (...) laudare. gloriari. fulgere. splendere. insanire, etc.

Regia. 5. In angelis suis reperit vanitatem, Symmachus. 6. Adversus angelos
suos pravum quid advertit, Septuaginta. The diversity of these translations
arises from the word Halal, which signifies Laudare, gloriari, fulgere
splendere, Translations which were in estimation
insanire.

The first translation which was in any account was that which was in in the
days of Ptolomeus Philadelpus.

The second that of Aquila who translated the Old Testament into Greek, an
hundred and twenty years after Christ. The third was that of Symmachus who
lived in the time of the Emperor Severus, fifty and six years after the
translation of Aquila. The fourth translation was that of Theodosion who lived
under the Emperor Commodus (as Symmachus lived under Severus) and he and
Symmachus lived at one time. These four were joined together by Origin, and he
called them Tetrapla. And then he added the Hebrew Text and his own
translation, and then he called them Hexapla. How Origin made up his Teirapla,
Hexapla, and Octupla.
And lastly he added that translation which was found in Jericho, and at
Nicapolis, and then he called them Octupla or (...), because every Page
contained eight Columns, as may be seen in this Table following.

Col. 1. heb. heb. lit. (...) Col. 2. heb. grae. lit. (...). Col. 3. Septua.
(...). Col. 4. Aquila. (...). Col. 5. Theodosio^. (...). Col. 6. Symma. (...).
Col. 7. Hieric. desiderat Col 8. Nicapol. desiderat.

This was Origens last Edition, but as he set them down first, he set his
Tetrapla in the first place, and next his Hexapla,, and last his Octupla, as
Scaliger has set them down.

Page 1. Aquila. (...) Page 2. Symmachus. Page 3. LXX Seniores. Page 4.
Theodosion. Page 5. Editio Hierichuntis. (...). Page 6. Editio Nicap. Page 7.

The diligence of Origin in his edition.
Mark Origens farther diligence in this his work; for by sundry marks and
notes, he distinguished that, which was extant in the Hebrew; from that which
was added by the Translators.

These things which were found in the translations, and not in the Hebrew Text,
he marks them Obelo, thus (...)
These things again which were in the Hebrew Text, and not found in the
translations; he marked them Asterisco, with a star this ways (...)
Thirdly, the diverse readings confirmed by sundry Copies, he marked them
lemnisco this ways / (...) /
And lastly, these things which were found but in few copies, he marked them
Hypolemnisco this ways (...)


This Edition of Origin was so generally followed afterward, that Augustine
complained that in all the Libraries they could scarcely find one Copy of the
Seventy, The edition of Origin corrected by Lucian.
wanting these marks of Origin: and when sundry faults, had crept into this
his Edition Lucian an Elder at Antioch and afterward a Martyr, took all these
Editions and conferred them together; and he set out a more axact and correct
Edition then Origens was.

Of the Translation of the Seventy.
Ptolomaeus Philadelpbus procured not this translation, as some hold.
IT is commonly holden, that Ptolomaeus Philadelphus the son of Ptolomeus
Lagi, King of Egypt gathered a Library, two hundred sixty and seven years
before the birth of Christ, in the City of Alexandria in Egypt: and having
gathered together diverse Greek writers, he gathered also Hebrew, Persian,
Syriack, and Roman writers, and caused to translate them into Greek, and put
them in his Library: and when he understood of Demetrius Phalaraus who had the
charge of his Library, that there were books in Jerusalem written by the
Prophets amongst the Jews, which entreated of God and of the creation of the
world, and much hid wisdom was contained in them; King Ptolomie wrote unto
Jerusalem, that they might send these books unto him: and when they had read
his Letters, they sent these books written in Golden letters: which Hebrew
books when they were delivered unto the King, he understood them not:
therefore he wrote to Eleazar the Highpriest the second time, that he would
send men unto him, who would translate these Hebrew books into Greek. And
Eleazar sent Seventy two, six out of each Tribe, who were very skillfull and
expert both in the Hebrew and in the Greek. These men translated the Scripture
in the I Will Pharos, They were called seventy, propter Rotundationem numori.
being put in several Cells; yet all of them so agreed, that there was not any
difference among them, and they were called the Seventy commonly, although
there were seventy and two of them.

Josephus writing against Appion, borrows this history or fable rather out of
Aristoeas, and afterward the Christian writers (in whose time this translation
of the Seventy was in most request) gave ear willingly to this: for they used
most the translation of the Seventy; and they took occasion to spread abroad
any thing, which might serve for their credit. Justin Martyr a famous old
writer, with tooth and nail stands for the authority of this Translation: he
tells how they were put into several Cells, and how they were directed by the
holy Spirit, so that they agreed, not only in the sense; but also in the
words. But yet neither Aristaeas, nor Josephus who borrowed this from him; make
mention of these Cells.

But Scaliger in his animadversions upon Eusebius at the year M.CCXXXIV,
judges that this book of Aristae^s (out of which this narration was borrowed)
was but fained by some grecizing Jews, caliger proves by many reasons, that
Ptolemeus Philadelphus, did not procure this translation.
that they might conciliat the greater authority to this their translation
which they had procured, and he has sundry reasons to improve this narration.

Hermippus (an ancient writer of whom Diogenes Laertius makes mention) that
Dimetrius phalerius whom Aristaeas brings in as the procurer of this whole
business at the hands of Ptolomeus Philadelphus, was in no favor with him,
for Ptolomeus so disliked this Dimetrius altogether, that in the beginning of
his reign he banished him: and through grief he took himself to live in
the Wilderness; and one day being heavy with sleep, laid himself down upon
the ground to sleep, where a Serpent did sting him to the death. The cause why
Dimetrius was hated by Ptolomeus.
The reason wherefore Philadelphus so hated him was this: because when
Ptolomeus Lagi his father had married a second wife called Eurice (as he had
Bernice the mother of Ptolemeus Philadelphus for his first wife) this Dimetrius
persuaded Ptolomeus Lagi to disinherit the son of Bernice, and to give the
crown to the son of the second wife Eurice; which when Ptolomeus
Philadelphus understood, after his fathers death he presently banished him. Now
seeing Dimetrius was hated so of Ptolomeus Philadelphus, Aristophanes was
keeper of the Library of Ptolomeus.
and dyed in the beginning of his reign, is there any probability that he had
the charge of this Library? and Vitruvius says, that Aristophanes that noble
Grammarian had the keeping of this Library; and not Dimetrius Phalerius.

Aristaeas and these who follow him say, that there were six chosen out of
every Tribe and sent to Egypt to translate the Bible; but at that time there
dwelt no other Jews in Judea, but only of the Tribe of Judah and Benjamin,
although perhaps some of the other Tribes were scattered amongst them; yet it
is certain that these had no place amongst them, because the most part of them
were carried away captive by the Assyrians. This handful which were yet left in
Judea, had no authority amongst them, and how came it to pass that they sent
the whole Synedrion or the great Council to Egypt? besides, the Synedrion
consisted not of the twelve Tribes after the captivity, but only of the Tribe
of Judah; and is it probable that they would send these Seventy to Egypt? and if
it be true which they say of these several Cells in which they were placed,
when they translated the Bible; then it behooved every one of them, to have
such a sufficient measure of knowledge both in Hebrew and Greek, that they
might have finished the whole Work alone; which no man will believe.

Aristaeas reports that Ptolomeus said, if any man should add, or take from
this book then he should be accursed; but this was the curse which God
himself set down in the Law, Deuteronomy. 4.2. Rev. 22. 18. This Ptolomeus
understood not: and whereas Aristaeas goes about to prove that these curses
were usual amongst the Greeks and Romans; we must understand that they never
used these curses but in extreme necessity; but what necessity was there here
for Ptolomeus to add this curse, who was but desirous that these books might
only be put amongst the rest of the books in the Library?

Eleazar the Highpriest and the Synedri^n at Jerusalem had approved this
translation, why would the Jews at Jerusalem have so hated this translation?
The Jews kept a fast for this Translation.
For yearly in remembrance of this translation they kept a fast the eight day
of Tebheth, (which month answers to our December) and the Jews say, that
there was three days darkness when the Law was translated, these Angaria or
fastings which they call Tagnanejoth were appointed either propter (...) for
the great wrath of God which did hang over them, (...)
or for some great plague, or for killing some just man, so the Jews observed
these Angaria in remembrance of this translation, as a day of great heaviness
and not as a day of great joy; and they applied that place of Solomon, Eccles.
3.1. There is a time to rent, and a time to sow, they who made this schism,
say they, rent the Law, when they translated it.

Ptolomeus King of Egypt was, Ptolomeus Philadelphus a vicious man.
we shall hardly be induced to think that he had such a care in translating of
the Bible: or that he would be at such charges to send for such a number of
learned men to translate it: for he was a most vile and wicked man, and he
was called Philadelphus as the Parca or weerdsisters are called Eumenides, for
he killed his two brethren borne of Eurices and committed incest with his own
sister Arcinoe.

Iosep. lib. 11.2.
Sixthly, Josephus writes that the Law was sent by Eleazer the hie Priest to
Egypt, written in Golden Letters; but this is improbable: for the Hebrew
Doctors write, that it was not lawful for any, no not for the King to write
the Law, but only with Ink; and when they saw the copy that was presented to
Alexander the great, Guli^l. Shickardus lib. 2. de sure reg. Hebrae.
having the name Iehova still written in Golden Letters, the wise men amongst
the Jews would have them rased out, and to be written with Ink.

See how the grecizing Jews made up this fable of the agreement and consent of
the Seventy translating the Bible, The fable of the grecizing Jews concerning
the Translation of the Seventie.
this fable arose (as Scaliger observeh well) out of the misapplying of that
place, Exodus 24.9. And Moses ascended and Aaron, verse. 11. And Seventie of the
Elders of Israel. And there the Septuagints add (which is not in the
original) (...), that is, Of the chosen men of Israel none of them did
disagree, and hence afterward was this uniformity made up of the Seventy
translating the Law in Egypt, whereas there is no such thing in the original
text; but only this ways it stands in the Text. They saw the Lord, and upon
the Nobles of Israel, he laid not his hand, that is, although they saw the Lord
yet they dyed not; that which was spoken of the Seventy in Moses time, they
applied it to these Seventy who were sent to Egypt in the days of Ptolemeus:
and again, they misinterpret the word (...) thus, The chosen of Israel none of
them did disagree, but in the original it is, None of them did die. Wherefore
Scaliger judges (and not without cause) that this Translation of the Seventy
was not procured thus, The cause that moved the Jews to procure this
Translation of the Seventie.
and the grecizing Jews do fable; but he says, the matter fell out after
this manner. When the Scattered Jews lived under Ptolemeus King of Egypt,
then they were enforced to write their contracts in Greek, and to reckon their
times by the reign of the Kings of Egypt; who redacted them to this
necessity, to speak the Greek tongue: and these Jews who lived in
Alexandria and through out Egypt, procured this Translation, and that it might
be read, not only in Egypt amongst the grecizing Jews there; but also
amongst all the grecizing Jews abroad: but the Jews who keep the original
text were very loath to admit the Translation of the Seventie to be read in
their Synagogues; and it was for this Translation (as Scaliger holds) that
there was such hatred between the Hebrews and the Greeks, The cause of the
^^atred betwixt the Hebrews and Grecizing Jews.
Act. 6.7. The other Jews who lived still in Judea hated these grecizing Jews
who followed the Translation of the Seventy, they called them hakkore
giphthith, reading after the manner of the Egyptians, (...) Legen^es Egyptia^e,
(...) Retrorsum.
and Lemiphrang, that is, the wrong reading: because they read from the left
hand to the right, and not from the right hand to the left, as the Hebrews do.

By this which has been said, we may perceive that this Translation of the
Seventy was not procured by Ptolomeus Philadelphus. This much only we must
grant, This Translation was procured under Ptolomeus, but not by him.
first, that this Translation was translated in the days of Ptolomeus
Philadelpus. Secondly, that it was translated by seventy Jews; but that
Ptolomeus was the cause why it was translated, or that the Seventy were put in
several Cells when they translated it, or were divinely inspired as the
Prophets of God were when they translated it; The Seventy were not inspired as
Prophets, when they translated the Bible.
all these are too be denied.

This Translation of the Seventy which we have now, is not that which the
Seventy wrote, Origin never saw it, as may appear by his Hexapla, for it was
burnt by Dioclesian (as some hold) in the Library of Alexandria, or (as others
hold) by Julius Caesar when he burnt Serapion. Barouius. Tom. 2.


Vido Lipsium de Bibliotheca.
The Seventy were not (...), inspired by the holy Spirit, and therefore we are
not to parallel the Hebrew Text and the translation of the Seventy, but where
the holy Ghost has paralelled them.

There were other Translations of the Old Testament. First, Diverse translation
of the old Testament.
the Arabicke translation of the Testament. Secondly, the Persicke translation
upon the five books of Moses which was translated by Iacobus Tavasus. And
thirdly, the Ethiopian translation, translated by Damianus Agoeis. And lastly,
the Armenian translation. Guido fabratius sent to the King of France the
Arabicke, Ethiopian, Persian, and Armenian translations, and all in their own
Characters; which if the King had caused print in their own Characters, and
digested them in Columns, as Origin did his Octupla; it had been regium opus,
a princely work.

The first Latin translation out of the Hebrew was Hieroms translation, The
first Translation out of the Hebrew into Latin, was that of Hiero.
four hundred years after Christ in the days of Pope Damasus, there were
other translations in Latin, of which Augustine makes mention, but they were
translated out of the Greek.

The first translation of the New Testament was into the Syriacke tongue. The
first translation of the new Testament, was the Syriack.


Marcke is holden to be the Author of this translation, hut he was martyred in
the eight year of Nero, and the Fathers who lived in Egypt, and Palestina make
no mention of this Syriack translation, as Origin, Clemens Alexandrinus, and
Athanasius: and therefore it seems to be latter, and not so soon after the
Apostles.

The Syriack translation which was heretofore in our Churches was defective,
The Syriack translation which was here to fore wanted many things.
and wanted many things which were in the original; as it wanted the last
verse of the seventh Chapter of John, and the history of the adulterous woman,
Ioh. 8. So the second Epistle of Peter, the second and third Epistle of John,
the Epistle of Jude, and the book of the Revelation; all these were wanting in
it. But that Copy which is brought lately from Syria wants none of these, as
Ludovicus de. Deiu. testifies in his Syriack translation which he has now
published, and the Arabicke translation which Erpeneus had by him, has all
these places which the former translation wanted.

We will subjoyne here the postscripts which are found in the Syriack and
Arabic translations, after the Evangelists.

The postscript of the Evangelist St. Matthew in the Syriack is this, Scriptum
est in terra palestinae Hebraice, The Postscript of Matthew in the Syriack and
Arabic translations.
this Gospel was written in the Hebrew tongue, in Palestina. The Postscript in
the Arabic is this. Absolutum est Evangelium Matthaei Apostoli, quod scripsit
in terra Palestinae Hebraice, auxilio spiritus sancti, octo annis postquam
dominus noster Jesus Christus carne in caelos ascendit, primo anno regni
Claudij Caesaris Regis Romani. That is, the Gospel of the Apostle Matthew,
which he wrote in Hebrew by the assistance of the holy Spirit, in the land of
Palestina, was perfected eight years after Jesus Christ ascended to the
Heavens, in the first year of the reign of Claudius Caesar, the King of the
Romans.

The error of this Syrack and Arabiack postscript.
Here observe two things, first, that the Syriack and Arabic say that this
Gospel was written in Hebrew first, whereas it was written originally in
Greek. Secondly, that the Arabic calls Matthew an Apostle, whereas he was
an Evangelist.

The postscript of Mark in the Syriack and Arabiack Translationes.
The Postscript of the Evangelist Mark, in the Syriack is this, Absolutum est
Evangelium Sancti Marci qui loquutus est and Evangelizavit Romae, That is, here
ends the Gospel of S. Mark which he spoke and preached at Rome. The Arabic
has it thus, Finitum est exemplar Marci, quod scripsit in ditione romana
occidentali, in vrbe Romana, anno duodecimo postqua^ dominus noster Jesus
Christus carne in Caelos ascendit quarto anno Claudij Caesaris, That is, here
ends the exemplar of Mark which he wrote in the province of western Rome
in the City of Rome it self, twelve years after our Lord Jesus Christ
ascended into heaven in the flesh, in the fourth year of Claudius Caesar.

The error of these two postscripts.
But this Postscript is not probable, for Mark lived in the Church of
Alexandria in Egypt, therefore it is more probable that he wrote his Gospel
there, than at Rome.

The postscript of Lu^^ In the Arabiack and Syriack Translation.
The Postscript of Luke in the Syriack is this, Scriptum est Alexandriae magnae
quindecem annis a Christi ascensione. It was written in the great City of
Alexandria fifty years after Christ's ascension. The Arabic is, Scriptum est
grace in civitate Macedonia vigesimo secundo anno post ascensionem Domini in
caelum, vigesimo quarto anno Claudij Caesaris. This Gospel was written in
Greek in the City of Macedonia twenty two years after the Lords ascension
into the heavens, the twenty fourth year of Claudius Caesar.

Here we may see the difference betwixt these two Postscripts, the Syriack
says, The error of these two postscripts.
it was written in Alexandria in Egypt, and the Arabic says, it was written
in Macedonia in Greece, what credit then should we give to these Postscripts?

The Postscript of John; the Syriack is, The postscript of John in the Arabiack
and Syriak Translation.
Johannes Evangelista hoc Evangelium edidit Grace Ephesi. That is, the
Evangelist set forth this Gospel in Greek at Ephesus, the Arabic is, Johannes
filius Zebedaei vnus ex duodecem Apostolis, scripsit id graece Incolis Ephesi,
anno post ascensionem domini in Calos tricesimo, imperante Nero. John the son
of Zebedaeus one of the twelve Apostles wrote this in Greek to the inhabitants
of Ephesus, thirty years after Christ's ascension, in the reign of Nero.

The Syriack translation is read in Syria, Mesopotamea, Chaldea, and Egypt; and
it was sent first in to Europe by Ignatius Patriarch of Antioche.

These who translated the Bible in latter times, The latter Translaters of the
Bible Popish or Orthodoxe.
were either Popish, or Orthodoxe.

Popish, the Latin translation established by the council of Trent, Vatablus,
Arias Montanus, Pagninus, and Isiodorus Clarius.

By the reformed, as by Munster, Ecolampadius by Leo Judah who dying before the
work was finished, Bibliander, and Conradus Pellicanus finished it, and then
they are called Biblia Tigurina. And lastly, by Iunius and Tremellius.

Of the Vulgar Latin translation.
WHen light arose to them who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, to
the Protestants who lived before in Popery, they began to search the original
Text and to look into the fountains, the Hebrew and Greek, and they charged
the adversaries to bring their proofs out of the original Text in their
disputations with them.

The Church of Rome decreed that the Vulgar Latin translation should be the
original.
The Church of Rome to obviat this, made a decree in the Council of Trent,
Anno. 1546. that the vulgar Latin should be holden for the original; which
was as base a change, as when Rehoboam changed the golden Sheilds in the
Temple, into Sheilds of brass, 1 King. 14.27. So have they changed the
original into the Vulgar Latin translation, and made it authenticke; which in
many places is corrupted.

After that they had inacted, that the Vulgar Latin should be only the
touchstone, to try all controversies and that they should use it in their
readings and disputations, then Sixtus Quintus the Pope took great pains
about the correcting of this Vulgar Latin. Pius the fourth and Pius Quintus
had done something before in the correcting of this Vulgar translation; but it
was Sixtus Quintus that finished it, Forty four years betwixt the act of the
Council, and the finishing of the Latin translation.
Anno 1590. So that there were forty four years betwixt the Act made in the
Council, and the finishing of the translation. Bishop Morton says, that the
Canon Law forbids, that a child shall be baptized before it be borne; yet
they will make this Vulgar translation to be original and authenticke before
it be finished and perfected by the Popes. And what will they say here? wanted
the Church an authenticke translation all this while until it was concluded^
in the Council of Trent.

When Sixtus Quintus had taken all this pains in correcting the vulgar Latin,
and had proclaimed it as authenticke by his Bull, and cursed them who held
otherwise: yet Clemens the eight came afterward, Clemens the eight corrected
the vulgar translation.
and corrected many things which were left uncorrected by Sixtus Quintus, and
he set out a more perfect Edition than that of Sixtus Quintus: and there was
great difference betwixt these two Editions, as Docter James the Overseer of
the Library of Oxford has marked, in his book which is entitled, De Bello
antipapali. These were not errors in the Print (as some would salve up the
matter) but they are material differences, as may be seen in that book by
conferring their translations.

We may demand of the Catholics, whether did the Council make this
translation Authenticke which was not Authenticke before, Diverse ^udgements of
the Catholics concerning the vulgar Latin translation.
or did they only declare it to be Authenticke? Some of them say, that the
Council promulgated it to be Authenticke, and that the Lord so directed the
hand of the first Translator, that he erred not in these things that the
Council was to approve afterward. But Bannes the Jesuit says, Page 537.
that it is of greater authority that is approved by the Church, than that
which was immediately written by these, who were infallibly directed by the
Spirit; but can there be any greater authority than to be infallibly directed
by the Spirit? In locis theologicis lib. 2. cap. 14.
Canus holds that they were immediately and infallibly directed by the Spirit,
who translated the Scripture first into the vulgar Latin. And Gretserus goes
further, and sticks not to say, that Theodosion who translated the Bible into
Greek, Defensione B^llarm. contra. Whittakerum. lib. 2. cap. 2. page 537.
erred not in his translation, but was assisted by the holy Spirit that he
could not err; yet he was a Jew and an enemy to Christ. Serrarius says, he
who translated the Vulgar Latin had but the general concurse of the Spirit of
God, Serrarius in Prolegom. bibuac. Page 110.
as the rest of the servants of God had; but was not infallibly directed by the
Spirit in his translation. And Johannes Dreido proposit. 3.4. and Andradius
fol. 255. and Be armin, Lib. 2.11. admittimus eum interpretem fuis^e, sed non
vatem, and yet some of them hold that he erred not in the versions which the
Church approved afterward.

Again we may demand of them, whether will they prefer the Vulgar
translation to the Hebrew and Greek? The grosser of the Papists are not
ashamed, to prefer it to them both, and they say, we have no need to have
recourse to the original, to try whether it be Authenticke or not, the Vulgar
Latin being now established by the Council. In^^agoge ad Scripturam lib. 1.
diff. 6 sect. 1.
And Ludovicus a Tena says, although the books in the original both Hebrew
and Greek were not corrupted, yet seeing they have words of diverse
significations, which the Church has not approved or rejected: therefore we
are to hold that the Vulgar Latin is Authenticke only; because the Church
has concluded it to be so. And Osorius says, Osorius Instit. Moral. Lib. 8.
Cap. 3.
if we should grant that the Interpreter might have erred in his versions, yet
the Church cannot err in approving his Version.

The Modern Papists prefer it not simply to the Hebrew and Greek, as
Gretserus says, Sufficit aequatio, non pralatio: But they say, that they will
not have their translation examined and tried by the Hebrew and Greek; for how
know we (say they) that these Copies which we have now, agree with the first
original Copy? we have the judgment of the Church concerning this
translation, but not concerning the Hebrew and Greek. But if it be in the
Churches power to make a translation or to authorize it, why will they not
authorize the Hebrew and Greek rather than the Vulgar Latin translation?

And if they inact the Vulgar Latin to be Authenticke and the only rule to
decide controversies, what shall become of all the Churches in the East that
understand not the Latin; shall they under the pain of a curse receive this
translation?

When the Vulgar translation was concluded in the Council of Trent, only to
be the Authenticke translation in their Disputations, Sermons, and Conferences;
Some opposed against this, and said, that it was a hard thing for the Church,
to judge that only to be Authenticke, which one man had done. And Aloysius
Caetenaeas said, that no man could know what a Version meant, but by the
Original; and he alleged for himself Cajetans authority in the Council, who
being Legate for the Pope in Germany, Anno 1523. was wont to say, that the
only remedy to refell Heretics, was to understand the literal sense out of
the original tongues, and he said now, that the Cardinal would spend the rest
of his days in studying of the tongues, that he might be the more fit to
convince the Heretics; which he did, and he gave himself to this study
eleven years before he dyed.

Again there was much contention among them concerning the meaning of this
Canon made in the Council of Trent, whether this translation was the judge in
matters of faith or manners only? or was it so strictly to be taken that it
failed not one jote, and that Mathematice it was so perfect and not Moraliter
only? Andreas vega who was present at the Council of Trent holden under Pope
Paul the third, says; when the Tridentine Fathers call the vulgar Latin
translation, the Authenticke translation, they mean no other thing but this,
that it was not corrupted with errors, and that it might be safely read and
used to a man's salvation; and he concludes, that the authority which the
Council gave to this translation, is not to be taken infinitive, but
definitive with certain limitations. But if this was the meaning of the
Council, that the faithful might safely read it, because there was no danger
of error; then what authority or prerogative had this version by the Council,
above that translation of Pagnine for the Doctors of Lovan by the approbation
of the Pope, put the translation of Pagnine with the Hebrew Text. But the
former Catholics say, that he who translated the Hebrew into the Vulgar
Latin, was not an Interpreter, but a Prophet: but how comes it that others
say now, that this Interpreter might err, although not grossly? that he might
err, not in side and moralibus, but in lesser matters? and so they will have
the Council to be understood; but they of old said plainly, that in every
thing this translation was Authenticke.

Lastly, when we demand of them whether the Church may make a new Version yet
or not? or mend that which is already done? Gretserus who takes the defense
of Bellarmine, Lib. 2. cap. 10. page 540.
against Whittaker, denies that there can be any thing added to this
translation, In Prolegom. bible.
or be made more perfect. But Serrarius holds, that this Version may be yet
helped, and that it is not come yet to such a perfection, but that it may grow
to a greater; if the Church would condescend.

The translation of the Seventy although the Apostles themselves followed it in
many things, yet it was never holden to be Original and Divine, by the Church,
neither were the Churches commanded to receive it under the pain of a curse.
Hierome marketh in his Preface upon the first of the Chronicles, that the
Churches of Alexandria in Egypt, followed the Translation of Hesychius (which
was a translation set forth after the Seventies translation) rather then the
translation of the Seventy: but from Constantinople to Antioche, they followed
the translation of Lucian the Martyr, but the Churches of Palestina (which lay
betwixt these two) followed Origens Hexapla: And so he says, the whole world
was divided into th^se three; then what great presumption is it in the Church
of Rome, to make the Vulgar Latin Authenticke and Original, and to injoyne it
to be read in all the Churches? Franciscus Ximenius Cardinal of Toledo, in his
Preface before the Bible set out at Complutum in Spain says, that he set the
Vulgar Latin betwixt the Hebrew and the Greek, as Christ was set betwixt two
Thieves, is not this a fine comparison to prefer the Vulgar Latin to the
Hebrew and Greek?

The Syriack translation was first translated into Latin by Guido Fabricius,
and afterward by Tremellius. Genebrard and Serarius taking occasion upon this
translation, charged Tremellius with great forgerie. First, that he took away
all the Titles from the Epistles; but this was no forgerie: for neither the
Superscriptions nor the Subscriptions are any part of the Canonical Scripture,
as may be seen before in the postscripts added to the Syriacke translation.
Secondly, they charge him, that he took away the Calender, for the reading of
the Gospel upon holy days: but neither the Hebrew Calender, nor the Syriacke
Calender, are Divine Scripture; and that use, for which they say this Calender
served, for reading of the Gospel upon holy days; was only used in the
western Romish Churches, but not in the Eastern Churches. Thirdly, they say
that he committed Plagium in stealing his translation from Guido Fabricius, and
setting it out under his own name: but what diligence he used in translation
of the Syriack, he who wrote his life testifies. And will any man think that
he who was a native Jew, borne and trained up in these tongues, was so
ignorant, that he had no skill, but that which he did steall from another? and
Gretserus adds, that first he was a Jew, and then he became a Monk, thirdly,
a Calvanist or Hugonite, and lastly, that he returned to his vomit again,
and dyed a Jew. But that ye may perceive what a Railer this was, who spared
neither the living nor the dead, I will set down a memorable proof of his
death; he who wrote Apophthegmata morientium, (the notable sayings which sundry
uttered at the last hour of their death,) relates this of him. When they
demanded of him what confession he would make of his faith? he said, Vivat
Christus and pereat Barabbas. Whereas the rest of the Jews cried, Vivat
Barabbas, and pereat Christus, this he said to signify that he renounced
Iudaisme, and took him only to the merits of Christ. Was this to dye like a
Jew? the Name of this worthy man should smell to us as the Wine of Lebanon.
Hos. 14.7.

Of a Paraphrase.
THe second way how God makes the Scripture plain unto us, is by paraphrasing
it, which goes in a larger circuit of words than a translation does; and this
is called tirgam a Paraphrase. (...)
An Ecphrasis is an exposition of this Paraphrase.

The first Paraphrase, was the Paraphrase of Jonathan the son of Vzziel, who
paraphrased the great Prophets thirty years before Christ, both plainly and
without Allegories: but upon the small Prophets he runs out more upon
Allegories.

The second Paraphrase, was the Paraphrase of Onketos otherwise called Rabbi
Aquila, adding Nun and changing a into o, as Aquila Onkelos, as Bonarges
Banuarges. It was he who translated the Old Testament into Greek also, he
paraphrased the five books of Moses ninety years after Christ; not long
after the destruction of the Temple.

The third Paraphrase, was Targum Hierosolymitanum upon the five books of
Moses, most fabulous and most impure; but because Targum Jonathan was in great
request among the Jews, and not so fabulous as this Targum; the Printers
amongst the Jews put these two letters Tan Iod before that Paraphrase, (...)
to make the Reader believe, that it was Targum Jonathan, Ionathans Paraphase:
for these two letters stand both for Targum Jonathan, and for Targum
Hierosolymitanum.

Lastly, Rabbi Joseph Caecus paraphrased Cetubhim, or the written books.

All these Paraphrases if ye will respect the langu ge, were either in the
Babylonian or Hierosolymitan tongue; three in the Babylonian, and Targum
Hierosolymitanum in the Hierosolymitan tongue.

These Paraphrases, Paraphrases when they are blasphemous are to rejected.
where they paraphrase against Christ are to be detested. Exam. 1. Genesis 4.
Incaeptum est nomen domini profanari, but Targum Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth
it blaspemously, In di^bus illis coeperunt Idola colere, and fecerunt fibi Deos
erroneos, quos cognominabant de nomine Sermonis domini. And here he implies
Christ who is called (...), sermo dei. This paraphrase is blasphemous against
the Son of God, and therefore to be detested.

Example, 2 Can. 4.5. Thy two breasts are like two young Roes. Targum
paraphraseth these two Roes to be two Messiases, the one the son of Joseph,
the other the son of David, the one Poor and the other mighty, that is a
blasphemous Paraphrase, and therefore to be detested.

Example 2. Job. 23.9. He paraphraseth it this ways, Michael is upon his right
hand, and Gabriel upon his left hand, Michael is upon his right hand, and he is
fire; and Gabriel is upon his left hand, and he is water; and the holy
creatures are partly fire and partly water. This Paraphrase is blasphemous;
because it makes the Son of God but a Creature, and matcheth Gabriel with
Michael.

Paraphrases when they are ridiculous are to be rejected.
Secondly, where these Paraphrases are fabulous, they are to be rejected.
Example 1, Genesis 3.21. The Lord made coats of skin for Adam and Eve. Targum
Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth it this ways. The Lord made glorious clothes
which he put upon the skin of their flesh, that they might cover themselves.

Example 2. Genesis 32.26. Dimitte me quia ascendit aurora. The Paraphrast makes
this to be one of the seven Angels who stand before the Lord, singing
continually, holy holy Lord of Hoasts, and he makes this Angel to be chief
of the Quire.

Example 3. Exodus 13.19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. Targum
Hierosolymitanum part phraseth it thus, Ascendere fecit Moses vrnam ossium
Iosephi, ex intimo Nili; and abduxit secum. Hence the Talmudist^ make a great
question how they could find this Chest of Joseph, being sunk so deep in the
flood Nilus, and they fly to their shift of Shem hamphorash; (...)
and R, Bechai upon this, says, that Moses took a plate and wrote upon it,
and said, ascend B^^ (meaning Joseph who was called Bos Dei, Deuteronomy. 33.17.) and
did cast this plate into Nilus saying, O Joseph, thy brethren which are
redeemed are waiting for thee, and the cloud of glory is waiting for thee: if
thou will not go up with us now, we are free of our oath.

Example 4. Deuteronomy. 28.18. Decaudicabat debiles, He cut off the tail or the
weak of the host, but Targum Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth it this ways, sed
accepit eos Amalek, and amputavit loca virilitatis eorum, projecitque sursum
versus coelum, dicens, toll quod elegisti, meaning that part which was
commanded by the Lord to be circumcised, they threw it up into the heavens, in
contempt and spite against the Lord.

Example 5. 1 Samuel 15. And he numbered them Battelahim, but Targum paraphraseth
it thus, He numbered them by the l^mbes. For Telahim is called lambs also, (...)
and they say that Saul would not number the people for fear of a plague upon
him and his people; as it fell out afterward upon David and his people:
therefore he caused every one of them to bring a lamb, and he numbered all the
lambs, and so he knew the number of the people; such Jewish fables as these
the Apostle wills us to take heed of^ Tit. 1.14.

But where these Paraphrases clear the Text, Paraphrases where they clear the
Text are to be used.
then we are to m^ke use of them. Example, Genesis 2.24. He shall leave father and
mother, and cleave unto his wife. Onkelos paraphraseth it thus, he shall leave
Donium cubilis, where the Paraphrast alludeth to the ancient custom of the
Jews, fo the children lay in their fathers chamber before they were married,
Luke 11.7. My children are with me in bed.

Example 2. Genesis 12.5. And Abraham took all the souls which he had got in
Charan, Onkelos paraphraseth it thus, Omnes animas quas subjecerat legi.

Example 3. Gen 49. Ruben excellens munere and dignitate, Onkelos paraphraseth
it thus, Excellens principatu and Sacerdotio; for he that was the first borne,
at the first, was both the Prince and the Priest in the Family.

Example 4. Genesis 49, 27. Benjamin a ravening woolfe, he shall cate the prey in
the morning, and shall divide the spoil at night. The Paraphrast paraphraseth
it thus, In his possession shall the Sanctuary be built, morning and evening
shall the Priests offer their offerings; and in the evening shall they divide
the rest of the portion which is left of the sanctified things.

Of interpretation of Scripture.
THe third outward mean whereby the Lord makes the Scripture clear to his
Church, is Interpretation, and this is called (...).

(...),
This Interpretation of the Scriptures makes the people to understand them, for
when the Scriptures are not interpreted, The Scriptures not being interpreted
to the people, are like a Nut not broken.
they are like a Nut not broken. When Gideon heard the dream and the
interpretation of of it, Iud. 7.15. In the Hebrew it is Veshibhro, the breaking
of it: (...)
a speech borrowed from the breaking of a Nut; for as we break the shell that
we may get the Kernel: So the Scriptures must be broken for the people, and
cut up for their understanding.

It was the manner of the Jews in their Synagogues, after that the Law and the
Prophets were read, to Interpret the scriptures, Act. 13.15. And after the
reading of the Law and Prophets, the rulers of the Synagogue sent unto them
saying, ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people;
say on. And therefore the Synagogue was called Beth midresh, Domus
expositionis, and we see the practice of this, (...)
Nehem. 8.8. Legerunt cum appositione intellectus: They read the Law clearly
to the people, and caused them to understand those things which were read; this
was the fruit of their interpretation. So they did (...) Act. 16.10. Confer
places with places. The giving of the sense here, is more than to give the
grammatical interpretation of the words: they gave the sense and the
spiritual meaning of them when they preached, Noah was a Preacher of
righteousness, 2 Pet 2.5. The Church is not only the keeper of the
Scriptures, but also an Interpreter of them. This word Kara signifies both to
Read and to Promulgate, (...) Legit Proclamavit

Esar. 29.12. and 61.12. Zach. 7, 7. Act. 10.20. So Mikra which signifies
Reading, signifies also an Assembly or Convocation, to teach us that the holy
Scriptures ought to be read in the congregation, and holy assemblies, and
ought likewise to be expounded.

The conclusion of this is; The Lord uses so many means to make the Scripture
clear to the people, and yet the Church of Rome goes about to stop these
Fountains of living waters, that the people may not drink of them. As the
Spies raised a slander upon the Land of Canaan, saying that it was unpossible
to be won: so do they slander the Scriptures of God with obscurities, and say,
that it is impossible for the people to understand them.

EXERCITAT. XVI. Of the division of the Scriptures.
They have Moses and the Prophets. Luc. 16.29.
THe scriptures are divided into the old and New Testament.

The old Testament again is divided into Moses and the Prophets, and sometimes
the Law is put for the whole old Testament, Romans 3. So Job. 7.49. Esaias. 2.3.
And sometimes the Psalms are called the Law. Ioh. 15.25. That the word might
be fulfilled which is written in their Law, they hated me without a cause. So
the Prophets are called the Law. 1 Cor. 14.21 In the Law it is written.

(...) pent^^ ^^^chus in
Moses is divided into Hammitzua, Commandments, Chukkim, statutes, and
Mishpatim, judgments; that is, in Moral Precepts, Ceremonial, and Judicial.

The Jews again divide the old Testament into the Law, (...) priores, (...)
posteriores. (...) prophetae
the Prophets and Cetubhim, which the Greeks call (...), holy writings, all
the Scriptures are holy writings; but usually these that were not confirmed by
Vrim and Thummim are called (...).

The Prophets are divided in Rishonim and Acharonim, the former and the Latter:
the former Prophets are Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel. 1 Kings and 2
Kings, They are called the former Prophets because they entreat of the history
past, and present. Act. 3.24. Yea and all the Prophets from Samuel and those
that follow after. Samuel is said to be the first of the Prophets; therefore,
Iere. 15.1. Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, Samuel is the first of the
Prophets; then it is most probable that he wrote the books of Joshua and
Judges. Joshua is the first in order of the Prophets, therefore the Haptorath
which is set upon it, is called Haphtorah laetitiae legis, They were glad when
they ended the Law, and began the Prophets. But Samuel seems to be the
writer of this book.

Others call them the first Prophets, because they saw the first Temple; and
they call them the latter Prophets, because they prophesied in the time of the
second Temple, as Haggai, Malachi, Zachary. But they are all rather to be
called Acharonim latter Prophets, because they foretell things to come: and
they are divided into the great Prophets and into the small.

The great Prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.

The latter Prophets are called Teresar pro Tere gnasar that is, two and ten,
(...) pro, (...) duodecem.
and the Greeks called them (...). There is a Testimony cited by Matthew,
cap. 2.23. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets. This
Testimony is found but in one of the Small prophets: (...).
yet it is said to be spoken by the Prophets, and they gave this to be the
reason, because all these Twelve small Prophets were joined in one book.

The Conclusion of this is. Romans 13, 10. Love is the fulfilling of the Law.
Then he has enlarged this word in two Mat. 22.37. Thou shall love the Lord
thy God with all thine heart: and thou shall love thy Neighbor as thy self.
Thirdly he has enlarged these two into ten words Deuteronomy. 10.4. And he wrote on
the Tables the ten words. Fourthly he has enlarged them into Moses and the
Prophets. Mat. 22.40. On these two Commandments hang all the Law and the
Prophets, (...) pendent, even as we hang a thing upon a Nail, Esaias 22.23. So
the Law and the Prophets hang upon these two.

EXERCITAT. XVII Of the Division of the Psalms.
Act. 13.33. As it is also written in the second Psalm. Thou art my Son this
day have I begotten thee.
THe Psalms are divided in five books, as the five Books of Moses; and the
five Books joined together called Quinque volumina, as Canticles. Ruth.
Lamentations. Ecclesiastes and Esther.

The first book of the Psalms ends with the, 41. Psalm. The second ends
with the 72 Psalm. The third with the 89. The fourth with the 106. The fifth
with the 150. Psalm, (...)
and these books end with the same words, Baruch Iehova Elohe Iisrael
mehagnolam vegnad hagnolam, Amen veamen. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel
from Everlasting to Everlasting, Amen, Amen. Psalm. 41.13. so the rest of the
books, for the most part end thus. And hence we may gather, that this verse
was added by him who set the Psalms in order, and not by those who wrote the
rest of the Psalms. This may appear by the conclusion of David's Psalm of
thankesgiving 1 Chro. 16.36. That they have borrowed their conclusion at the
end of every book from the conclusion of this Psalm.

David wrote the first two books of the Psalms and set them in order.
The first two books were written by David, and they end thus, So end the
Prayers of David the Son of I^ffe, Psalm. 27.30. That is, here end the Psalms
which were both written and set in order by David.

The other three books were written by diverse Authors as by David, Asaph, the
sons of Korah, Ieduthun, Moses, Heman the Ezrite, and when the writer of the
Psalm is not set down, the Jews hold, that he who wrote the former, wrote
that Psalm also.

Asaph wrote thirteen Psalms, Leasaph, (...)
Lamed is sometimes a note of the genitive case, and sometimes of the Dative
case, Aliquando est nota Genitivs aliquando Dativi.
and therefore some have interpreted the word Mizmor leasaph, a Psalm dedicat
to Asaph to be sung be him; but it should be Translated a Psalm of Asaph: for
Asaph was a Prophet, 2 Chronicles. 39.30. Moreover Hezekiah and the Princes
commanded the Levites to sing praises unto the Lord, with the words of David
and Asaph the Seer. And the style of Asaph is harder then the Style of David.

The second who wrote these Psalms were the Sons of Korah, and they wrote
ten in number; The son of Korah wrote some of the Psalms.
the posterity of Korah died not in the rebellion with their Father, Number.
26.11. Some of his posterity wrote before the captivity, and foretold of the
captivity, as the Psalm. 73 74. And some of them when they were in the
captivity.

So some when they were returning from the captivity, as 66. Some after they
were returned, as 85. and 147.

So Moses wrote a Psalm of the shortness of the life of man, Moses wrote a
Psalm.
this Psalm was written when they were in the Wilderness, and yet it was not
registered in the Canon till after the captivity. Thus we see the watchful eye
of God, that had a care to preserve these books which were to be insert in
the Canon, that none of them should perish.

So these Psalms which were written by Ieduthun and by Ethan the Ezrite who
were of the posterity of the Levites. Ieduthun and Ethan wrote some of the
Psalms.
The Levites duty was to teach the People, and so the Lord made those Levites
teachers of the people by their songs.

Of the inscriptions of the Psalms.
THe Psalms generally are entitled Tehilim, praises, because the most of them
are songs of praise; The general inscription of the Psalms is Tehilim
therefore the whole are so called.

The particular Inscriptions of them are either easily understood, or hardly to
be understood at all.

The inscriptions easy to be understood are these. First, (...)
Lamnatzeahh, (...) to the chief Musician. The singers were divided into so
many orders, and every one sang according to their courses, and when it befell
the chief Musician to sing, then he caused to sing this Psalm committed to
him.

The next title is Maschil a Psalm for instruction. These were Psalms which
David made out of his own experience. (...)
Peter, when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren, Luke 22.32
these were called Psalmi didas^alici.

The third was Michtam, Aurei Psalmi, golden Psalms: all the Word of God is
like fine gold, Psalm. 119. (...)
And yet these Psalms are called Golden Psalms, because there is some
special and choice matter in them: so all the word of God is faithful, all to
be trusted, yet Paul says; Fidus est hic sermo, This is a faithful saying, 2 Timothy 1.15. Having some notable things in it, and as all the Ring is Gold, yet
the Diamond is the most excellent: So although all the Word of God be
excellent, (...)
yet these are most excellent. So some are entitled lehazcir, Ad recordandu^
to bring to remembrance, (...)
as 38. 70. because they were made in remembrance of some notable deliverance
or of some great benefit.

(...)
Fourthly, some are called Psalms of degrees.

Psalme^ which they sang wh n they carried the Arc out of the house of David
to the Temple.
When they brought the Arc from David's house into the Temple, they sang, Psalm.
119. by the way, it begins with these words, Beati immaculati in via, and
entreats especially of the Law of the Lord, In omnibus versibus Psalmi 119.
dempto versu 122. vna harum vndecem vocum invenitur. (...)
and there is not a verse in it, except only the 122. verse, which has not
some epithet of the Law of God in it, as his Judgments, his Word, his
Statutes, his Laws, his Testimonies, his Commandments, his Precepts, his
Covenant etc, And when they entered into the Court of the Gentiles with the
Arc, they sang the last part of this, Psalm. 119.

When they went further to the Court of the people, When and where they sung
the Psalms of degrees.
when they stood upon the first degree, they sung Psalm. 120. which contains
the history of the deliverance of the people out of Egypt. And when they stood
upon the second degree, they sung Psalm. 121. My help comes from the Lord.
When they were upon the third step they sung Psalm. 122. I was glad when they
said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord. So they sung a Psalm
upon every step as they ascended, and upon the eight step when they beheld the
excellent buildings of the Courts of the Levites, they sung Psalm. 127. Except
the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. When they entered
into the Court of the Priests, they sung Psalm. 128. Vide Villalpand in Ezekiel.
40.28.
And upon the last step they sung Psalm. 134. Bless ye the Lord all his
servants which watch by night in the house of the Lord. The people might go no
further; then the Priests went forward with the Arc into the Temple, and when
they entered into the porch of the Temple, they sung Psalm. 118. verse. 19. Open
to me the gates of righteousness. When they were standing in the porch they
sung these verses following, The Psalms which the Priests sung when the Arc
entered into the Temple and into the holiest of all.
This is the gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter. When they
were in the midst of the Temple they sung the 22. verse, I will praise thee,
for thou have heard me and art become my salvation, and when the Arc entered
into the holiest of all, they sung Psalm. 24.

The inscription of the Psalms which we understand not; are either Notes of
Music, or Instruments of Music.

Some inscriptions are Notes or tunes of Music.
Notes of Music or common Tunes with which the Psalms were sung are these,
Gnal muth-labben, Psalm. 9. gnal sheminith, Psalm. 6.12. gnal aijeleth Shahar,
Psalm. 22. gnal Ionath Elem Rechokim, 56. Altaschith 57. 59. 75. gnal shushan
Eduth, 60. gnal shoshannim 45. 69 gnal shoshannim Eduth, 80. gnal Mahalath
Leannoth, 88.

Some inscriptions are instruments of Music.
Instruments of Music are these, Neginoth. 4. 6. 41. 54. 67. 76. Nehiloth, 5.
gittith, 8. 81. and Mahalath 53.

The Jews who live now understand not the music nor musisicall instruments
which were of old.
The Instruments of music set down Psalm. 150. none of the Jews themselves
can distinguish them, and they are ignorant of all these sorts of Music now:
but we are to bless God, that the matter contained in these Psalms may be
understood by the Church.

Psalms are divided according to the time.
The Psalms again were divided according to the time when they were sung, some
were sung every morning, as Psalm. 22. at the morning sacrifice. So Psalm. 92.
was sung upon the Sabbath: So at the passover they sung from Psalm. 112. to
verse. 19. of Psalm. 118. and this was that hymn which Christ and his Apostles
sang at the passover, Matthew, 26.30. And when they had sung an Hymn; they went
out into the mount of Olives.

Psalms divided according to their subject.
The Psalms were divided also according to their subject. The first book of
the Psalms entreats of sad matters, the second of glad, the third of sad,
the fourth of glad, the fifth of glad and sad matters.

Psalms which concern Christ.
There are some Psalms, which concern Christ in his Natures and Offices. His
Natures, as Psalm. 110. The Lord said to my Lord etc. His kingly authority, as
Psalm. 2. His priestly office. Psalm. 110. Thou art a Priest for ever after the
order of Melchizedek. So his passion, Psalm. 22. So his burial and
resurrection, Psalm. 16. and his ascension and glory, Psalm. 118.25.26. when
David was crowned King, the people cried, (...)
Anna Iehova hoshignah na anna, Iehova hatzlihhah na. Save now I beseech thee O
Lord, O Lord I beseech thee send now prosperity, that is, we beseech thee O
Lord to save the King, and to prosper him. And the Priest said, Blessed be be
that comes in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of
the Lord. This prayer is applied to Christ, Matthew. 21.9. Hosanna filio David,
they contract these three words Hoshignah na anna in one word Hosanna, (...)
contracte (...)
and they say Hosanna to the Son of David, id est, contingat salus filio
David in altissimis, they wished not only prosperity and safety in the earth
here, Vetum hosanna, pacem and gloriam comprehendit.
but all happiness to him in the highest heavens, Luke 19.28.

There are some Psalms which concerned David's particular estate, in his
persecution by Saul, by Absolon; etc. In his sickness, in his adversity.
Psalms which concerned David.
In his prosperity how he fell in adultery, and repented, Psalm. 51. how he
dedicated his house to the Lord, Psalm. 30. how he purged his house of wicked
men, Psalm. 101. when he entered to his kingdom, 144. So a Psalm to his Son
Solomon when he was to succeed into the kingdom Psalm. 72.

Lastly, Psalmi alphabetici.
some Psalms are divided according to the Letters of the Alphabet, as Psalm.
25.134.111.112.119.145. These Psalms were distinguished by the Letters that
they might keep them the better in their memories, and as Matthew summeth up
the genealogy of Christ into three fourteen generations for the memories
cause: So these Psalms are set down after the order of the Alphabet to help
the memory. Psalm. 25, wants three Letters (...). Psalm. 111. every verse has
two letters of the Alphabet, and the two last verses have three letters to make
up the Alphabet: So Psalm. 112. has the letters after the same manner. The 119.
is distinguished by the letters of the Alphabet, and here ye shall see, that
every Section as it begins with the letter, so all the verses of that
section began with that same letter, as the first Section begins with,
therefore all the eight verses in the first Section begin with, etc. So Psalm.
145. Is set down after the order of the Alphabet, The Syriak Arabic, Seventy,
and vulgar Latin, add this verse to Psalm 145. and make it the 4. verse.
but it wants the Letter. Here some go about to prove by this, that the
original Copy is defective, and therefore the Arabicke translation adds a
verse, (...) Fideiis dominus in omninus verbis suis, and benigbutin omnibus
operibus suis.
so do the Seventy and the Vulgar Latin; but if it be defective here, why do
they not supply a verse likewise in Psalm. 34. where is defective in the
Alphabet? we are not to think that there is any defect in the matter because
these letters of the Alphabet are wanting: for the Lord fitted these letters to
the matter only, and not the matter to the letters; and because the holy Ghost
has not set down the matter here, therefore the Letter is left out; but not
this ways, because the Letter is wanting here; therefore the letter is wanting.

(...)
The five last Psalms begin with Halleluia, and end with it, because they are
the conclusion and sum of the whole praises of God. So the Church in the
revelation concludes after the victory with the same words, Reve. 19.1.
Alleluia, salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God.

Tehilim praises, from the most excellent part of them: Therefore our chief
care should be to praise God here in this life, and then in the life to come
we shall sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb,
Reve. 15.3.

EXERCITAT. Of the division of the Law and the Prophets, in parashoth and
haphtaroth.
Act. 15.21. For Moses of old time had in every City them that preach him,
being read in their Synagogues every Sabbath day.
THe Scriptures were not divided into Chapters, (...)
as we have them now divided, therefore the Jews say, that the whole Law is
Instar vnius pesuk, that is, but as one verse.

The Old Testament was divided into parashoth and Haphtaroth; this division
into parashoth was most ancient, Act. 8.32. The place of Scripture which he
read was this, (...)
in the Greek it is (...) the Section, and the Syriacke calls it pasuka.

They distinguished not these parashoth and haphtaroth by numbers, as we do
our Chapters; they said not the first parashah, the second parashah, but they
distinguish them by the first words of the Section; as the first parashah is
called Bereshith, the second Elle toledoth Noah, etc.

They used to divide and distinguish these great parashoth and haphtaroth three
ways. First, they distinguished them with three great P P P. Secondly, (...)
they distinguished them with three great Samechs, as Genesis 20.10. these Samechs
or Semucheth make not so great a distinction as when they are distinguished by
three great P P P: (...)
for there is some coherence (whch they are distinguished by Samech) with that
which goes before. So in the particular parashoth when ye see them
distinguished by parashah or by Semuchah; but only with great letters, (...)
as Genesis 32.2. this word vaijshlahh begins the parashah in great letters.

Ioh. 7.37. In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried
saying, etc. This was the eight day of the feast of the Tabernacles, They read
three sections upon the eight day of the feast of tabernacles when the Law was
ended.
and it is called the great Sabbath. This day they kept Festum laetitiae legis,
The feast of joy, because they ended the reading of the Law that day; and the
next Sabbath they called it Sabbath bereshith, because they began to read the
book of Genesis again. And ye shall see that this day they read three
Haphtaroth or Sections, (...).
the first was haphtaroth elle pekudi lejom sheni shel Succoth, and it began, 1
King. 7.51. So was ended all the words which King Solomon made, etc. And that
day Solomon stood up and blessed the people; So the true Solomon Jesus Christ
blessed the people In that great and last day of the feast. The second
haphtarah which was read this day, was Josh. 1. haphtaroth shimhhath torah.
(...)
Sectio laetitiae legis, because the Law was ended, and Joshua began the
Prophets. The third parashah which they read was, Malac. 3. Haphtaroth sabbath
hagadol, (...)
and it ended thus, Behold I will send you Eliah the Prophet, and so they
joined the last Section of the Law, and the last Section of the Prophets both
together, and it was in this day that Jesus Christ stood up and spoke to them;
the true Solomon, the true Joshua, the end of the Law and the Prophets. And
whereas the Jews on this day delighted themselves much with banqueting, and
drink; Jesus Christ calls all those to him who thirst, and he promises to
refresh them; If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink.

Scaliger holds, that the Apostle, Coloss. 2.16. Let no man Judge you (...)
in part Sabbathi, In Elencho trihares. cap. 21. page 217.
signifies that, which the Hebrews call Parashah, and which the Talmud
calls Perek or Chelek, or which the Greeks call (...) but the Apostle
means only here, (...)
that he would not have the Jews to condemn the Colossians, for not observing
their Jewish Sabbaths; as he would have the Gentiles to abstain from things
strangled, and blood, Act. 15.29. That they might not give offense to the weak
Jews.

The Jews say, that this division in Parashoth was most ancient, but the
division into Haphtaroth was later, and they give this to be the reason why
they read these Haphtaroth, they say, when, Antiochus Epiphanes forbad them
under pain of death to read the Law of Moses 1 Macch. 2. then they made
choice of some parts of the Prophets answerable to these parts of the Law.
Example, because they durst not read Petorah beresith. They read Esaias. 42. So
says the Lord Creator of heaven and earth. Example, 2. the second Parasha is
Elle toledoth Noah, now because they durst not read this they read Esaias.
besiman, that is, The reading of Moses and the Prophets more ancient than
Antiochus.
at the sign 54. (for that which we call a Chapter they call a sign) Sing ye
barren, etc. But is it likely that Antiochus that great Tyrant, (...).
forbad them only the reading of the five books of Moses? wherefore the
reading of Moses and the Prophets has been much more ancient than the time of
Antiochus: therefore Act. 15.21. Moses is read of old. A Phrase which
signifies a great antiquity.

When they read Moses Law, They read the whole Law in their Synagogues once in
the year.
they divided it in fifty and two Sections, and they finished it once in the
year: They had two sorts of years, there was Annus impraegnatus or
Embolimaeus, and Annus Aequabilis. Annus Impragnatus was that, which we call
Leap year, and it had fifty three weeks; Annus impragnatus. embolimaeus.

in this year they divided one Parashah in two parts, and so they ended the
reading of the Law within the year. When it was Annus Aequabilis then it had
but fifty two weeks, then they read one Parashah for every Sabbath, and in the
last Sabbath of the year, which was the twenty third of Tishri, they read
that Parashah called Latitia legis, which begins Ioshu. 1. And the next
Sabbath they began beresith again at the first of Genesis.

These Parashoth were subdivided into so many parts, and there were sundry who
read these parts upon the Sabbath, he that read the first, was called Cohen
the Priest, he repeated the first part of the Section; and then rose up
Catzan, or Cantor, who did sing the same part which the Priests had read; then
there rose up in the third place a Levite, and he read his part; Fourthly,
there rose up an Israelite, and he read his part, and at last it came to
Maphtir, (...) a (...) cessare in hiphil dimittere.
and he read the last part of the Haphtorah; he was called Maphtir, because
when that part was read, the people were dismissed, and so the Latin Church
said Ite missa est.

In the week days, they read upon the second and the fifth day of the week,
some part of those Parashoth, but not the whole: and the Pharisee meant of
these two days when he said, I fast twice in the week Luke 18.12.

The Greek and Latin Fathers never cite Chapters as we do now; Augustine in
his book of retractations, Cap. 24. says not, I have written to Genesis 3.
but this ways, I have written to the casting out of our parents out of
paradise. And Gregory in his Prologue upon the first of the Kings, says; I
have expounded to you from the beginning of the book, unto the victory of
David.

Who divided the Scriptures first into Chapters it is not certain; they were
divided of old two manner of ways; first they divided them into (...) titles,
(for so they called the greater parts) and then into Chapters as into lesser
parts: others again divided them into Chapters as into greater parts. It is
holden, that Musaeus presbiter Ecclesiae Massiliensis divided them first into
titles, and subdivided them into Chapters. Genebrard, Chronologia.
According to this first division Matthew had sixty three titles, and three
hundredth and fifty five Chapters. So Luke according to the ancient division had
forty eight titles, and three hundredth and forty eight chapters.

He who began this latter division into Chapters, is holden to be Hugo
Cardinalis: according to this division Matthew has twenty and eight Chapters,
and Luke twenty and four, etc.

Lastly, it was divided into verses: this division into Pesuchim or verses, the
Masoreth found out first amongst the Jews: The Greeks called them (...).
Scaliger calls them Commata, and Robertus Stephanus calls them
Sectiunculas, and some hold that it was he that found them out first amongst
us.

EXERCITAT. XIX. Of the sense of the Scriptures.
THere is but one literal sense in the Scriptures, which is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 2 Timothy 3.16.

To make diverse senses in the Scripture, is to make it like that (...) which
Anaxagoras dreamed of, making Quidlibet ex quolibet. August. Epist. 48.
Augustine writing to Vincentius, justly derideth the Donatists who
constructing these words, Cant. 1.7. Tell me (o thou whom my soul loves)
where thou feedest, where thou make thy flocks to rest at noone; They
gathered out of them that the Church of Christ was only in Africa by their
allegorical application. Origin was too much given to these allegories, and
therefore he missed often the true sense of the Scriptures.

These who gathered diverse senses out of the Scripture, do little better with
them, than Esope did with an inscription written in a pillar of Marble, in
which were written these seven letters (...). Esope first read them thus,
(...), id est, abscedens gradus quatuor fodiens invenies thesaurum auri. But
Xanthus his master finding, as he had spoken, a great treasure of Gold, and
giving nothing to Esope for his conjecture, kept all to himself, therefore
Esope read them another way thus, (...), id est, qui tollitis dum abitis,
dividite quem invenistis thesaurum auri. But when Esope got nothing, in a rage
he read it thus, (...). id est, read Regi Dionysio quem invenisti thesaurum
auri.

The Jews hold that there is a literal sense in every Scripture, and a
mystical sense; the literal sense they call Dabhar keton, (...)
rem parvam, and the mystical sense they call it Dabhar gadol, rem magnam, the
literal sense they call it peshath, sensum nudum, and the mystical sense they
call it darash; and most of the Schoolmen hold that there is a double sense in
the Scriptures. Latomus the Papist says, Theologiam crassam versari circa
literalem sensum, theologiam subtiliorem versari circa mysticum and allegoricum
sensum, and they call the literal sense panperem and grammaticum, and the
allegorical Divitem and theologicum, the rich and theological sense. But we
must strive to find out the literal sense of the Scriptures, or else we shall
never come by the true meaning.

The literal sense is that which the words bear either properly or
figuratively, therefore he said well who said, bonus grammaticus, bonus
theologus: for we can never come to the true meaning and sense, unless the
words be unfolded.

A figurative literal sense is either in verbis vel in rebus, either in the
words or in the matter.

In verbis, in the words, as Luke 13.32. Herod is a Fox Psalm. 22.12. The
princes of Israel are Bulls of Basan, in these words there is but one sense. So
Let the dead bury the dead, Luk 9.50. Dead in soul bury the dead in body, here
is but one sense; but where the words in one sentence have diverse
significations, then they make up diverse senses, as judge not that ye be not
judged, Iudicium libertatis. Iudicium potesta^is.
Mat. 7.1. the first is, judicium libertatis, the second is, judicium
potestatis.

When we search to find out the literal sense of the Scripture, that cannot
be the literal sense of it which is contrary to the analogy of faith, which
is either in credendis or in faciendis. If it be contrary to the articles of
our faith or any of the commandments, then that cannot be the literal sens^,
as Romans 12.20. If thine enemy be hungry give him meat, if he thirst give him
drink: for in so doing, thou shall heap coals of fire upon his head. Here to
feed the enemy, and to give him drink, are to be taken literally, because
they are commanded in the sixth Commandment: but to heap coals of fire upon
his head, must be taken figuratively, because according to the letter, it is
contrary to the sixth Commandment. Example, 2. Matthew. 5.29. If thy right eye
offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee, Here the words are not to be
taken literally, for this were contrary to the sixth Commandment, but
figuratively. So this is my body, is not to be taken literally, for it is
contrary to the analogy of faith: because the heavens must contain the body
of Christ until he come again, Act. 3.21.

The second is figurative in rebus, as in the Sacrament of the Supper, when he
sat with his Disciples he said, This is my body; he points at the thing
present, and understands the thing that is not present; he had the bread and
cup in his hand, and he said, This is my body, This is my blood, In these
propositions there is the subject and the attribute; the subject is the bread
and wine which he does demonstrate; the attribute is that which is signified by
the bread and wine, and these two make up but one sense, propius and remotius;
when Peter had made a confession that Christ was the Son of the living God,
Matthew. 16. Christ to confirm this unto him, and to the rest of the Disciples,
says, Tu es Petrus, Similie.
and super hanc petram, etc. he points at Peter, but he understands
himself, upon whom the Church is built and not Peter. When a man looks upon
a picture, he says, this picture is my father, here he understands two
things, propius and remetius, to wit the picture it self, and his father
represented by the picture; this picture at which he points is not his
father properly, but only it represents his father.

Hic est sanguis meus, that the article hic agrees with Sanguis, and not with
Vinum, therefore it may seem that it is his blood indeed, and not wine that he
points at.

hoc est corpus meum, he should have said, hic est corpus meum; because it
repeateth the word panis as it is more clear in the Greek, therefore the
article hic has relation to some other thing, than to the bread at which he
points, for the article (...) repeateth not (...) or (...), the bread or the
wine, but (...) and (...), his body and his blood. When Moses said, Exodus 24.8
Behold the blood of the Covenant, here the word blood is properly to be
understood: because their covenants were confirmed with blood, and there was no
sacrifice without blood. But when Christ said, This is my blood of the New
Testament, there was no blood in the Cup here, but he had relation to his own
blood, which was signified by the wine in the Cup.

When Christ says, This is my body, This is my blood, how was he present with
the bread and the wine there?

A thing is said to be present four manner of ways,

First, (...) when a man is bodily present. Secondly, (...), as when a man is
present by his picture. Thirdly, (...), as the sun is present by operation in
heating and nourishing things below here. Fourthly, (...), when we apprehend a
thing in our mind. Christ when he said, this is my body, and this is my blood,
he was present there (...), but he was not in the bread and the wine (...), for
then his blood should have been there before it was shed; then he should have
had two bodies, one visible and another invisible: but he was present there in
the bread and the wine (...), because the bread and the wine represented his
body, and his blood. So he was present there (...), by his Spirit working in
their hearts and he was present to them by faith (...), when they did
spiritually eat his body and drink his blood, and this is the true and
literal sense of the words.

Which is the literal sense in those words, Hoc facite in mei recordationem,
do this in remembrance of me?

Although there be many things employed in these words, upon the part of the
Minister; Take this bread, bless this bread, break it and give it to the
people. And upon the part of the people; take this bread, eat this bread, etc.
yet all these look but to one thing, that is, to the remembrance of Christ's
death: and therefore the external action brings to mind the internal
action, the remembrance of Christ's death: so that in these words there is but
one sense.

Testimonies of the old Testament cited in the New, make but one sense.
When the testimonies of the old Testament are cited in the new, the Spirit of
God intends propinquius and remotius, something nearer and something farther
off; yet these two make not up two diverse senses, but one full and entire
sense. When Jonathan shot three Arrows to advertise David, 1 Samuel 20.20. he
had not two meanings in his mind, but one: his meaning was to show David how
Saul his father was minded toward him, and whether he might abide or fly: So
the meaning of the holy Ghost is but one in these places. Example, 2 Samuel 7.12.
The Lord makes a promise to David, I will set up thy seed after thee which
shall proceed out of thy bowels. This promise looked both ad propius and
remotius, (...) a radice (...) and non a (...) lex. (...) significat formam. 2 Chronicles. 17.17.
yet it made up but one sense, propius to Solomon, and remotius to Christ:
therefore when he looks to the farthest, to Christ, 2 Samuel 7.19. he says,
Zoth torath, Haec est delineatio hominis Dei, it should not be read, is this
the Law of the man O Lord God? as if David should say, this is not all that
thou have promised to me O Lord, that I should have a son proceeding out of
my own loins, but in him thou do prefigure to me a son, who shall be both
God and man: and he adds For a great while to come, thou do promise to me
a son presently to succeed in my kingdom, but I see besides him a far off
the blessed Messiah. And he applies this promise literally to his son
Solomon, and figuratively to Christ his Son; taking the promise in a larger
extent; and the matter may be cleared by this comparison. A father has a son
who is far from him, he bids the Tailor shape a coat to him, and to take
the measure by another child who is there present, but withal he bids the
Tailor make it larger; because his child will wax taller: So this promise made
to David was first cut out (as it were) for Solomon his son, but yet it had a
larger extent: for it is applied to Christ who is greater than Solomon: and as
by a sphere of wood we take up the celestial spheres: So by the promises made
to David concerning Solomon, we take up him who is greater than Solomon; and
these two make but up one sense. When a man fixes his eye upon one to behold
him, another man accidentally comes in, in the mean time; he casts his
eyes upon that man also: So the Lords eye was principally upon the Messiah, but
he did cast a look, as it were, also to Solomon.

When these testimonies are applied in the New Testament, A Scripture diversely
applied, does make up but one literal sense.
the literal sense is made up sometimes of the type and the thing typed.
Example, Ioh. 19.36. A bone of him shall not be broken. This is spoken both of
the bones of the Paschall Lamb, and of the bones of Christ; and both of them
make up but one literal sense.

Sometimes the literal sense is made up ex historico and allegorico, as Sara
and Hagar, the bond woman and the free, signify the children of the promise
begotten by grace, and the bond servants under the Law; and these two make up
but one sense.

Sometimes ex tropologico and literali, as, Ye shall not mussle the mouth of
the Ox that treads out the corn, 1 Cor. 8.9.

Fourthly, the literal sense is made up ex historico, mystico and prophetico.
Example, Ier. 31.15. A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter
weeping, Rachel weeping for children, refusing to be comforted for her
children because they were not. There was a voice heard in Ramah for Ephraims
captivity, that is, for the ten Tribes who came of Joseph the son of Rahel,
this mourning was because the ten Tribes should not be brought back again
from the captivity, this was mystical and not prophetical, that she mourned
for the ten Tribes who were led away into captivity; but it was prophetical
foretelling the cruel murder which Herod committed in killing the infants not
far from Rahels grave; all these are comprehended in this prophecy, and make
up one full sense.

When a testimony is cited out of the Old Testament in the new, the Spirit of
God intends, that this is the proper meaning in both the places, and that
they make not up two diverse senses. Example, the Lord says, make fat the
hearts of this people, Esa. 6.9. and Christ says, Matthew. 13.14. In them is
fulfilled this prophecy. This judgment to make fat the hearts, was denounced
against the Jews in Esaias time at the first, Act. 23.16. Well spoke the holy
Ghost by Isaiah the Prophet, it was fulfilled upon the Jews who lived both in
Christ's time and in Paul's time. Esaias when he denounced this threatening, he
meant not only of the Jews who lived then, but also of the Jews who were to
come after; and it was literally fulfilled upon them all.

Example, 2. Esa. 61.7. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has
anointed me to preach the Gospel, this prophecy is cited by Christ, Luke
4.18. and it is only meant of Christ, and literally to be applied to him.

Example 3. Esaias. 49.6. I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, Christ
went not in proper person to preach to the Gentiles himself, but he went to
them by his Apostles, therefore Act. 31.47. Paul says, the Lord has commanded
me to go and be a light to the Gentiles, this is the proper sense and meaning
of the Prophet Esaias in this place.

When the testimonies of the Old Testament are cited in the new, they are not
cited by way of Accommodation, but because they are the proper meaning of the
places; if they were cited by Christ and his Apostles only by way of
accommodation; then the Jews might have taken exception, and said, that these
testimonies made nothing against them: because it was not the meaning of the
holy Ghost who indicted these Scriptures to speak against them. But Christ and
his Apostles bring out these testimonies, as properly meant of them, and not by
way of accommodation only.

We must make a distinction betwixt these two, Applicatio destinata Applicatio
per accommodatione
Destinatam applicationem, and per accommodationem, Destinata is this, when the
spirit of God intends that to be the meaning of the place. Applicatio per
accommadationem is this, when a preacher applies the Testimonies of the
scriptures for comfort or rebuke to his hearers, this is not destinata
applicatio; sed per accomodationem. A man makes a suit of apparel for one,
Simile.
that is Destinatum to him, yet this suite will serve for another; and this is
Per accommodationem. When Nathan said to David, the Lord also has put away thy
sin, thou shall not die, 2 Samuel 12.13. this was destinata applicatio, but
when a preacher now applies this to one of his hearers, this is, but per
accommodationem, the scriptures are written for our Admonition, upon whom the
ends of the world are come. 1 Cor. 10.11. And they are profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 2 Timothy 3.16.
They serve to rebuke all obstinate sinners, and to comfort all penitent when
they are applied rightly: but when the Apostles applied their comforts and
threatenings, they had a more particular insight to whom they belonged, than
Preachers have now, and knew particularly what Scriptures were directed to such
and such men. When Esaias prophesied, make fat the hearts of this people. Esaias.
6.9. And when Paul applied it to the Jews in his time, it was destinata
applicatio: but when a Preacher applies it to his hearers now, it is per
accommodationem only, for he cannot so particularly apply it to his hearers,
as Paul did to his.

Where there are two several testimonies found in the old Testament, and
joined together in the new Testament, these two make but one literal sense, as
Esaias 62.11. Say to the daughter of Sion, behold thy Salvation comes. So Zach.
9.9. O Daughter of Sion, O Daughter of Jerusalem, behold thy King comes
riding upon an Ass, and upon an Ass Coalt: Matthew citing these places cap.
23. joyneth them both together, and shows that both Esaias and Zachary meant
of Christ coming in humility and not in glory, and these two make up but one
literal sense.

This is a special note to know the literal sense of the Scripture, A Note to
know the literal sense of the Scripture:
when this phrase is added; That the Scripture might be fulfilled: As Ioh.
13.18. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, he that eats bread with me,
has lift up his heel against me. This place was spoken first by David of
Achitophel Psalm. 41.10. But it was fulfilled literally in Judas who betrayed
Christ.

Example 2. Ioh. 17.12. Those that thou gave me I have kept, and none of
them is lost, but the son of Perdition, that the Scripture might be
fulfilled. This place was first spoken of Doeg, Psalm. 109.7. and this Scripture
is fulfilled in Judas, therefore this is the literal sense of it; the figure
was in Doeg, and the thing figured in Judas.

Example 3. Ioh. 19.24. Let us not rent it, but cast lots whose it shall be,
that the Scriptures might be fulfilled which said; They parted my raiment
amongst them, and for my Vesture they did cast Lots. Saul's Courtiers rent
David's dignities and honors amongst them, but the Scripture was fulfilled
literally here by the Soldiers.

Example 4. Ioh. 19.36. For these things were done that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, a bone of him shall not be broken. The type was observed in the
Paschall Lamb, but the Scripture is fulfilled here literally in Christ.

But it may be said. 1 Cor. 10.6.11. All these things happened to them in
figures, then they signified some other thing to us than to them.

They were types to us, that is, examples, Moses, the patience of Job; These
were not types properly but examples. So these things which befell the Jews in
the wilderness for their murmuring and committing whoredom are set down for
examples to the Corinthians and posterity to come, they were ad (...) they
serve to admonish and instruct us, that we fall not into the like sins, 2 Timothy 3.16.

It may be alleged that there are more literal senses in one Scripture then
one. Example; Caiaphas prophesied that one should die for the people, Ioh.
11.49. In Christ's meaning they had one sense, and in Caiaphas meaning they had
another sense.

This Prophecy must not be considered as one, two; the Spirit of God had one
meaning and Caiaphas had another, but the Scriptures which were inspired by the
holy Spirit had but one sense.

Where the holy Ghost makes a mystical application of the old Testament to
the new, that is Destinata applicatio; And arguments taken from thence hold
firmly. Example, Exodus 16.18. He that gathered much had nothing over, and he
that gathered less had no lake, the Apostle 2 Cor. 8.15. applies this morally
to all the faithful, and reduces things to a certain equality; that those
who are rich in temporary things, should bestow their alms upon the poorer
sort, and the poor, being richer in Spiritual things, might communicate to the
richer, their prayers and Spiritual helps.

When we apply the testimonies of the old Testament and borrow comparisons from
them, it is not destinata applicatio sed per accommodationem.
