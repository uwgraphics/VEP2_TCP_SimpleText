The Preface.
NOt to vy with Any, who have rendered Them better, nor to diminish those who
perhaps have done Them worse, nor for the vanity wherewith Many delight
Themselves, To be rep^cted Authors of a Public work, much less for any sordid
expectation of gain, does This Edition of the Psalms offer it self to the
common view. The general distaste taken at some unhandsome expressions in The
Old, which both disfigured the meaning of the Holy Ghost, and reproached our
English Tongue, (That did not afford a decent clothing to preserve Them from
the scorn of Those who apprehended any occasion to quarrel us) invited Me to
^ry in Some Few, whither They might not in the plainest dress of language be
freed from those disparagements of the Text, which gave offense. After I had
privately showed Those (intended no farther then for an assay) persuasion of
Friends, who had power to command, made me (having now leisure from those
greater employments, to which I was called more then I ever expected) willing
to run through the Rest.

I know Alteration (though for the Better) is scarce welcome to People by
Custom, August. Epist. 118. ad Januarium de consuetud. variis Regionum.
and long Prescription habited in their First forms, that of S. Augustine
being often true, Ipsa mutatio consuetudinis, quae adjuvat Utilitate, Novitate
perturbat, The profit does not recompense to Them the trouble and disorder of
the Change.

I have therefore by tying my self to the old Meter and old Tunes, endeavored
to prevent that disturbance which the Alteration might bring, whose difference
in this Version will not be much discerned, when the Congregation, perfect in
their ancient Tunes, may with as much ease repeat every verse read before They
sing (according to the practice) as They did the Old.

Wherein I shall desire my aim may be rightly understood, which was to render
Them rather with perspicuity and plainness for the vulgar use, then Elegance.
For this the disadvantage of the Measure (of All others least graceful)
wherein most of the Psalms run, allows not: especially when by design I deny
my self the liberty of those words and Phrases, which either suit not the
Gravity of the Subject, or capacity of the Meanest. To this end I have so
closely followed the New Translation of the Psalms in our Church Bibles, that
He who is able to read the one, may perceive the Reason of the Text neither
lost, nor abused in the Rhyme; Both which without much Vn-evennesse, or force
are brought to an easy and familiar agreement.

Indeed where the Place is obscure, and the Construction difficult, I take
leave by paraphrase to give the Meaning: which is a method of times observed by
the Septuagint, whose Version Moralizeth in the Greek, what was wrapped up in
figures by the Hebrew. As to instance in one for all, in Psalm 84. verse 6.
What our Translation from the Original terms The Valley of Baca, or of Mulbery
Trees (as the Margin has it) meaning thereby a place oppressed with drought and
Barrenness, where those Trees commonly grow, The Greek reads (...), Vallem
sitientem and ob id ad fletum excitantem. Vatablus.
the valley of Mourning, or of Tears, from the sad effects (says Vatablus)
which so wretched a Place produces, wherein passengers were constrained (for
want of other) to drink Rain water, kept in pits dug for that purpose.

This course as it is most useful, so I hope needs no excuse; for else how
should the Congregation observe the Psalmists rule, Psalm. 47.7
To sing with understanding, when they understand not what they Sing. The
serving God upon Others scoare whom we believe mean well is a fair way to
Sing implicit Faith into a Church whose Orthodox Divines both in their Pulpits
and writings have so often Said it out.

Neither will any (I hope) be so severe as to conclude, That it is not David's
Psalms, but Ours, so long as we Sing it in His sense, though not always
according to His strict Letter. For as it is not to be expected from a
Translatour, that he should verbum verbo reddere, give word for word: so with
the learned Andraeas Viega, Histor. Council. Tridentin: Lib. 2 An. 1546
I must conclude it impossible, that all the words of one Language should be
transplanted into Another, but that there will be some restriction or
enlargement of significations. And however One who thus precisely binds
himself to a Liter all interpretation may please himself, He can neither inform
Those who are less learned, nor keep them from apprehensions of prejudice upon
the Text: Since that which in the Hebrew is an Elegance, rendered in another
Language according to the Words would be (to say no worse) perplexed and
barbarous, inducing men, through this defect of the Interpreter, to suspect
that The Holy Ghost dictated, and the Church commended some things to the
Peoples use, which need not be understood.

Besides this advantage of Paraphrase where Places are dark, the Congregation
happily may find Another in the contracting diverse Psalms, formerly divided
into several Parts; so that now, unless some Few, the most without these
fractions and interruptions may be sung entirely at Once, not borrowing too
much time out of that which is allotted to Other Duties.

I have no more to add, But as the Service of God was my first aim, so J shall
account my labor fully recompensed, if it proves useful, or acceptable to The
most Renowned Mother Church of England: Under whose First establishment and
happy Reformation, in the Best and most Orthodox Times, I profess my self by
all obligations of Duty and Devotion an obedient Son, and faithful servant.

PSALM. I.

By wicked counsels led:
Nor stands in that perverted way,
In which the Sinners stray;
Nor joins himself unto the chair,
Where Scorners seated are;

To meditate delights.

We near the Rivers see:
Whose branches by their moisture spring,
And fruits in season bring.

Or make his blossom fade.
For God will his endeavors bless
With prosperous success.

Like chaff blow'n by the wind.

Stand up among the Just.
For God the righteous guides, and knows
The path wherein he goes:
When ways of Sinners perish shall
In their eternal fall.
PSALM. II.

Vain people why engage?

And Rulers counsel take.
Who against the Lord that Earth does sway,
And His Anointed, say,

And cast Their Cords away.

Shall them in Scorn deride,

And He in anger speak.

Adorned with Majesty:
Upon Mount Sion raised the throne
Of mine Anointed one.

The Lord has said to me.
Thou ar't my Son, without all spot,
This day I thee begot.

Ore Nations I Will advance:
Far as the earth, or Sea extends,
Are thy Possessions ends.

Such as thy power refuse.
And like a Potters Vessel broak,
So dash them by thy stroke.

The Nations with your Law;
Ye Judges of the earth be wise:
His Scepter not despise.

Rejoice, yet reverence bear.

Your way consumed has.
For if a little that increase,
Where can we seek for Peace?
Since they are only safe, and blessed,
Whose hope in Him does rest.
PSALM. III.

Who troubled have my Peace?
They many are, who against me rise,
And are my enemies.

And say, God cannot aid.

Thou shall my head up-raise.

Who heard my voice from high.

For He did me sustain.

I will not be afraid.
No, though with threats the furious rowt
Encompasse me about.

For with thy vengefull rod
Thou smit'st the cheek, and break'st the jaw
Of such as hate thy Laws.
To Thee O Lord our God alone
Belongs Salvation.
Who do Thy blessings evermore
Upon Thy People power.
PSALM. IV.

When my requests ascend.
Thou have enlarged me in distress,
And eased my heaviness.

The glory of my Name?
How long will ye love vanities,
And take delight in Lies?

Men of unmoved faith.
He, when before His throne I cry,
Will not my suite deny.

Nor sin against His Law.
When on your bed retired, and still,
O meditate his will?

To God your maker bring:
And on the hope of His defense,
Place all your confidence.

Ask, who shall do us good?
Lord let thy face, and beams divine,
On us thy servants shine.

Then theirs, whom plenty cloyes.
Who reap their fruits in time of peace,
whose Come, and Wine increase.

To take my sleep, and rest:
For thou, whose goodness does excel,
Make me in safety dwell.
PSALM. V.

Weigh what I meditate.

To Thee my Prayers I send.

Up to thy Throne be borne.
Betimes will I direct my cry,
And look to thee on high.

No ill dwells in thy sight.

Who hat'st iniquity.

Who leasing make their joy.
God will the bloody minded hate,
And punish all deceit.

Will to thy House repair:
And toward thy Temple in thy fear,
Due adoration bear.

Beset with watchful foes.
Make straight thy way before my face,
And guide me by thy grace.

Their heart foul Malice stains.
Wide Sepulchers are their black throats,
Their tongues but flattering notes.

By their own Counsels fall;
Themselves by their transgressions quell,
Who against Thy power rebel.

And showt with cheerful voice:
Because Thy love, which knows no end,
Does ever them defend.

For Thou will bless the Just:
And with Thy favor, as a shield,
In danger safety yield.
PSALM. VI.

Whose sin deserved it has:
Nor let thy hot displeasure burn,
Least I to nothing turn.

Ashamed my sins to speak.
O heal me, for my bones are vexed,
My Soul with grief perplexed.

For my delivery?

For thine own mercies sake.

Remember Thee in death?
Or will the dust, and silence raise
A voice to sound Thy praise?

Her vain and fruitless groans.
My bed the mark of sorrow wears,
Each night bedewed with tears.

Clouded with misery.
I languish, through my haters rage,
Into untimely age.

The Lord has heard my moanes.
My voice of weeping, and my tears
Sound lowdly in His ears.

In Pardon answer makes.
When their despite, who me defame,
Shall covered be with shame.
PSALM. VII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Deliver me from the unjust.

Whilst none is for my reskue near.

Or wickedness be in my hands;
If friend I ill rewarded have,
Or causeless foe I did not save:

Let him my captive soul subdue:
Let him my life to earth down thrust,
And lay mine honor in the dust.

Take vengeance on mine enemies.

For their sakes lift thy self on high.

According to mine innocence:

But just men stablish, and defend.

Preserves men of integrity.

Yet is provoked every day.

His bow is bent, and ready set.

And arrows from His quiver flings.

Mischief conceaves, brings forth deceit:

And he himself is fallen in it.

To strike his own malicious heart.
His mischief shall his own head wound;
His violence himself confound.

According to His righteousness:
And in my Songs extol the fame
Of His most high, most glorious Name.
PSALM. VIII.

Through earths extended frame!
Who have Thy glory set on high,
Above the starry sky.

Renown and strength to gain:
Whose weakness might thy foes confound,
And the Avenger wound.

Thy fingers did create;
The Moon, with all the Stars of night,
To which thy beams gave light:

Thy favor should him grace?

Thou will with glory crown.

The works Thy hand had made.
What in each element does meet,
Is subject to his feet.

The fowls which air does yield:
The Fishes, which their motion keep
Within the liquid deep.

All in the world obey!
How far excelling is Thy Name
Through earths extended frame!
PSALM. IX.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

And all thy wondrous works impart:
In Songs, and Hymns rejoice will I,

Mine enemies repulsed all
Shall at Thine awful presence fall.

Whose throne wrong judgment never stained.

Destroyed is, put out their name.
O thou malicious enemy,

And like the Cities thou have rased,
Thine own Memorial is defaced.

His throne in judgment stablish'd sure.



For Thou have never left the just.

His doings to the people tell.

Nere passes from His memory.

O Lord, who lift'st me from death's gate:

Whose joys from thy Salvation grow.

Their feet are caught in their own snare,
The Lord in their revenge is known,
Who by themselves are overthrow'n.

And all, who God forgetting, fell.

Nor shall the Needies hope decay.

Nor let thy judgments ever fail.

Will know themselves to be but men.
PSALM. X.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Thy face in times of trouble hide?

But let them fall in the pursuit.

And wretches, whom God hates, admires.

Whom he nor thinks on, nor affects.

His thoughts do fear no opposite.
He said, I never shall be moved,
Nor by adversity be proved.

Whilst mischiefs from his tongue distill.

His eyes against the poor are bent.

To catch the guiltless through deceit.

To make the poor his strong ones prey.

He hides His face, and sees not.

And think upon our miseries.

As if that God kept no account;
Nor will his wicked works require,
Or in His judgments pay their hire.

Whose hand their follies can requite.
He trusts on Thee, whom woes oppress,
Who still do help the fatherless.

And let them perish by Thy strength.

The Heathen to destruction bring.
Thou hear'st Thy servants humble plaint;
Prepar'st their heart, art swift to grant:

That men of earth no more oppress.
PSALM. XI.

Do ye reproachful men
Say, To the mountains fly my soul,
Like to the chased foul?

Their deadly shafts to throw;
That privily in darkness they
The upright in heart may slay.

What can the righteous do?

Whose throne in Heaven abides.
He all beholds with searching eye,
The Sons of men to try.
The Lord His righteous servants proves;
Hates him oppression loves.
He snares, with fire and brimstone showers,
Upon the wicked powers:
Black tempests are by Him raised up,
The portion of their cup.

Who righteousness affect.
His countenance, and favor bright
Beholds the upright.
PSALM: XII.

Goodness on earth does cease:
And, like all other Mortals frail,
The faithful Persons fail.

And to deceive him seeks:
With fratt'ring Lips, and double hearts,
They use deceitful arts.

Puffed up with pride and wrongs:

What Lord can us restrain?

Whose sighs their want deplore;
Now, says the Lord, will I arise
To ease their miseries.

Are pure, and most sincere:
As Silver in the furnace tried,
And sev'n times purified.

And from this race protect.

When vilest men are raised.
PSALM. XIII.

Who am with woes beset.
Shall I still languish in disgrace,
Whilst Thou do hide thy Face?

Take counsel of my grief?
How long will Thou my soul expose
To her insulting foes?

When I my hands up-reare.
Lighten mine eyes, ere loss of breath
Cause me to sleep in death.

Triumphing when I fail:
And those that trouble me be glad,
When they behold me sad.

My constant trust I place.
My glad heart shall rejoice alone
In thy salvation.

Unto the Heavenly King;
Who with such bountiful regard
His servants does reward.
PSALM. XIV.
Sing this as Psalm 100.

There is no God that all things made.
Corrupt and wicked are their facts;
Nor is there one who goodness acts.

And view of all man's children took:
To see if any knowledge sought,
Or upon God would place his thought.

And in their filthiness abide:
Throughout their numbers there is none
That good performs; No, not one.

Those workers of iniquity?
Who eat my people up as bread,
And never God have worshipped.

With great amaze, and sudden fear.
For God amongst the righteous race
Is ever present by His Grace.

Your shameless malice mocked has;
Because he God his refuge makes,
And sure protection from Him takes.

Salvation will from Sion give?
When God shall His from bondage free,
Then Jacobs race shall joyful be.
PSALM. XV.

Or on Thy Hill reside?
Even he whose life, and deeds are right;
Whose words in truth delight.

Nor does his neighbor wrong:
Who none with slanders does backbite,
Or undeserved spite.

Vile persons does despise:
But love and honor does afford
To them that fear the Lord.

Though he a looser were:

Nor lawless use exacts.
Nor to betray the innocent
For wicked bribes is bent.

Out of his Makers love.
PSALM. XVI.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Who put my faithful trust in Thee.
Thou O my Soul to Him have said,
Thou ar't my Lord and only aid.
To Thee my goodness not extends,
No merit nor perfection lends.

By most excelling virtues graced.

Who have on other Gods relied.
To These I no burnt offering,
Nor bloody sacrifice will bring;
Of them I neither mention make,
Nor in my lips their Names will take.

Shall have the duties of my heart.
God fills my Cup, and does advance
The lot of mine inheritance:

A wealthy heritage have made.

Who gav'st me counsel in distress,
And by Thy warnings do invite
My reins to serve Thee in the night.

And hold Him in my memory;
Whilst He assists at my right hand,
I steadfast and unmoved stand.
This glads my heart, my Glory shall
Rejoice, how low so ere I fall:
And in the grave my flesh shall rest,
With hope to Rise again possessed.

Eternally condemned to dwell;
Nor suffer Thy Holy one
In death to see corruption.

At whose Right Hand and Presence are
Such pleasures which no time shall end,
And joys no thought can comprehend.
PSALM. XVII.

My prayer, which lips unseigned send:

Behold my causes equity.

Visit'st, and try'st, and find'st me right.
I in my purposed thoughts profess,
That never shall my mouth transgress.

And paths where the destroyer lurkes.

That so my footsteps never stray.

My voice to hear, my speech to mind.

Sav'st them that trust, when foes withstand

And by Thee shadowed let me lie:

Whose strong oppressions me enclose.



Or Lions whelps, they lurking lay.

Both disappoint, and cast him down.
Deliverance to my soul afford
From wicked men, who are thy sword.

To punish sinners in the land:
Whom pleasures of the world enslave,
And in this life their portion have.
Thou giv'st them treasure at their will,
Their belly do with plenty fill:
Who full of Children at their death
Their substance to their race bequeath.

And presence will in endless light;
And waked from death, with thee abide,
With Thy blessed likeness satisfied.
PSALM. XVIII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Thou art my fortress, rock, and tower:

My horn of safety, and defense.

Who saves me from mine enemies:

And floods of wicked men assailed.

The snares of death about me dwell.

Who from His Temple me relieved.

Which Her foundations shaken has.

And from His mouth devouring flame.

Beneath His feet was darkness throw'n:


Thick darkness His Pavilion made;
And watery Clouds the sky orelay'd.

Whilst hail and fire powered down apace.

And coals fell from the breaking Cloud:

Their force His darted lightnings slew.

The world's foundations naked were,
At Thy rebuke, O Lord, and blast,
Which Thy incensed Nostrills cast.



But God my stay those sorrows eased.

Deliv'ring me through His free grace.

And cleanness of my hands reward.

Nor wickedly His precepts left.
His judgments I, and statutes, prize;
Still placing them before my eyes.

Nor to ungodly courses bent;

I am rewarded in His sight.
Second Part.



Do save the poor, the proud disperse.

And turn my darkness into light.

And through my God leaped ore a wall.

Does as a shield the faithful hide.

Or who a Rock to us, but He?

And keeps me in my ways upright:

And to high places does me lift.

Steel bows by them now broken are.

I through Thy favor greatness gained:
My feet enlarged have not failed;


Wounded and fallen, no more to rise.

And have subdued the rebels might:

And in deserved destruction end.

But God nor help them would, nor hear.

And tread them down in their retreat.

O Lord, Thou resku'd have my life.
My head ore Nations Thou do crown;
Those serve me, whom I have not known*

And strangers stoop unto my sway.

And their close places leave dismayed.

Exalt Him, who Salvation gives.

And people under me subdue.

And lifts me up 'bove those that rise.
He is my reskue, my defense.
From men of blood and violence.

My thanks Eternally record:
Amongst the Heathen speak Thy fame,
And praises sing unto Thy Name.

In love to His anointed King:
His mercies does on David power,
And on his seed, for evermore.
PSALM. XIX.

Of God, who did them frame.

His wonders does recite.

Without or tongue, or speech:

To every Nation.
God in the Circle of those spheres
A Tabernacle reares;
In which the swift, unwearied Sun
His daily course may run.

Does on the world reflect:
And, as a Giant strong in might,
Darts forth his piercing light.

Does from his Chambers rise:
And till his beams declining set,
Nothing can shun his heat.

Converting every Soul.
His faithful promise never dies;
And makes the simple wise.

And drooping hearts delight.
Both pure, and perfect, His command
Gives light to understand.

Eternal, and sincere.
The judgments of the Lord are fixed;
With Truth and Justice mixed.

When them the test refines:
And more then honey that distills,
The mouth with sweetness fills.

Often as he goes amiss:
Which yield a plentiful reward
To all that Them regard.

How far his sin extends?
Lord cleanse my Soul from crimes concealed,
To none but Thee revealed.

May ore Thy Servant reign.
Then shall I walk in innocence,
Free from the great offense.

Who sav'st me by Thy power;
Let all my words, and thoughts, by Thee
Heard, and accepted be.
PSALM. XX.

Give ear when thou do pray.
The Name of Jacob's God defend,
On whom thy hopes depend.

And strength from Sion lend.

Accept thy sacrifice.

Grant thee thy heart's desire:
Make thee enjoy thy wishes still;
Thy counsels all fulfill.

We in Thy help rejoice:
And in Thy Name our banners rear,
Who wilt thy servants hear.

Does His Anointed save.
He hears from Heaven, and His right hand
Makes him in safety stand.

Some put their trust in horse:
But we remember will the Lord,
Whose Name does strength afford.

We raised in triumph are.
O save us Lord, great Heavens King,
Hear those requests we bring.
PSALM. XXI.

Through Thee with safety clad.

And what his lips required.

Crownd'st him with purest gold.

Him endless days to live.

Through Thy Salvation blessed.
Thou giv'st him joy, and lasting grace,
The favor of Thy face.

Whose Mercy keeps Him fast:

Whose hate against Thee combined.

A fiery Oven make.
The Lord shall swallow them in ire,
By His revenges fire.

Root out their childrens birth;

Though fayl'd in their intent.

They turn their back with shame,

So we Thy power will praise.
PSALM. XXII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

O wherefore have Thou me forsook?
Why help'st Thou not, when I implore?
Nor hear'st, when I through anguish roar?

But Thou Thy audience do deny:
And in the night, when I should sleep,
My sorrows will not silence keep.

O Thou the praise of Israel!
Our Fathers placed their trust in Thee;
And Thy deliverance set them free.

And from Confusion saved were.

Reproach of men, and peoples shame,

Shoot out their lip, their head they shake.

See, if from him he safety have.

And ever since my hope become.

And from the birth, my care was flung.

Since left to me no helpers are.

Strong bulls of Bashan girt me round.


My bones disjoynted torture crackes;
My heart within me melts like Wax.

My tongue up to my Palate tied.

For dogs my life encompast have.
Assemblies of the wicked meet;
They pierced have my hands and feet:

Whilst they remorselesse on me stare.

And Lots upon my vesture cast.



Of dogs, and from the Lions paws.
For thou have heard me from the horns
Of fierce assayling Unicornes.

The Praises due to Thy great Name.
Jacobs line,
And Isreal's seed in Praises join.

Nor hid His face, but heard their cries.

Shall in thy Church performed be.

The hearts, that seek Him, ever live.

Religious Converts shall be found.
They shall remember, and implore;
And every Kindred Him adore.
For God's the Kingdom is, whose sway
All Nations of the Earth obey.

Even to the Soul that dies for need;
All from the throne unto the dust,
Before Him bow, and worship must.

And sons to God adopted breed:

His righteousness, and awful Name.
PSALM. XXIII.

I shall no want abide.

And by still waters leads.

He does again restore;
And guides me in the righteous path
His Name elected has.

Or death's more ghastly shade,
I fear no ill: Thy rod, and staff
Direct, and keep me safe.

Before my foes prepare.
Thou do with oil anoint my head;
My flowing Cup does shed.

Until my Life does end:
And in the House of God will I
Remain Eternally.
PSALM. XXIV.

And all that there have place.

And made the floods her base.

Or on His Hill appear?

Nor to deceive does swear.

And righteousness from high.
This is their race, who God believe,
And to His sight are nigh.

Ye Doors Eternal spread:
The King of Glory shall come in;
And his approach begin.

Of whom our Praises sing?
The Lord in Battle mighty, This
The King of Glory is.

Ye Doors Eternal spread.
The King of Glory shall come in,
And his approach begin.

Of whom our Praises sing?
The Lord in Battle mighty, This
The King of Glory is.
PSALM. XXV.

O God my Soul does flee.
To shame O never me expose;
Nor triumph of my foes.

Who wait upon Thy Name;
But let them feel it, who Thy Laws
Transgress without a cause.

Teach me Thy truth to know.

On Thee I still depend.

Thy ancient love record.

But save me in Thy truth.

To sinners He displaies.

Who in His precepts bide.

Great mercies there are found:
Which He unto all such does grant,
Who keep his Covenant.

Pardon to me afford!
And with my heinous crime dispense;
For great is mine offense.

The way which he shall choose;

Shall long on earth have place.

His secret shall appear.
He will His Covenant declare
To such as faithful are.

Who plucks me from the net.

Afflicted, and forlorn.

O Thou my woes discharge.

And all my sins forgive.

Whose hate most cruel grows.

Who put my trust in Thee.

Who on Thy grace attend.
Thy Israel O God release,
And all his troubles ease.
PSALM. XXVI.

My foot insisted has.
My trust has on Thee Lord relied;
Therefore I shall not slide.

My reins and heart descry.

Thy truth has kept me right.

Or those that use deceit:

Nor am the sinners guest.

So at Thine Altar stand:

What thanks to Thee belong.

The House Thou do Elect.
I Love the honor of that Place
Thy presence deignes to grace.

With men of blood and strife:

Whose hand is filled with gifts.

Save me, and mercy show.

Within Thy Temple meet.
PSALM. XXVII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

What terror then shall me affright?
My life's sole strength He is, and aid.
Of whom then shall I be afraid?

Conspiring did against me rise;
When they approached my flesh to eat,
They stumbling fell in their retreat.

My heart their numbers shall not fear.
And though a War against me rise,
My confidence shall them despise.

That I, unto His House retired,
Might spend my days, and there grow old,
His Temples beauty to behold.

Will me in his Pavilion seat;
Within His Tabernacle hide,
And safety on a rock provide.

Behold my foes encircling fall:
Therefore glad Songs, and sacrifice,
With praises to Thy throne shall rise.

In mercy to my voice reply.

My heart O Lord, seek Thee, says.

Nor leave me helpless, I desire:

Wilt me unto Thy favor take.

In paths of truth and plainness lead.

Who raise false witness, me to kill.
I fainted had, but for belief,
In endless life to find releife.
Wait on the Lord, of courage be;
O wait on Him, will strengthen Thee.
PSALM XXVIII.

Forbear not to reply:
Least I be, if Thou silence keep,
Like those in death that sleep.

In accents loud expressed:
When I with lifted hands entreat
Before thy Mercy seat.

Whose works are Thy offense:
Who when their hearts would mischief wreake,
Peace to their neighbor speak.

And wicked labors seeds:
And in the works they did invent,
Render their punishment.

And what His hand has wrought;
He cast them to destruction shall;
Nor build them when they fall.

Became my shield, and aid.

With joy His fame shall raise.

Strength to His Servants send.

To endless bliss advance.
PSALM XXIX.

Glory to God ascribe.

His Name adore and bless.

Brings down the Waters noise.
The Glorious God the Thunder makes,
Which earth's foundation shakes.

Dreadful in Majesty.

The lofty Cedars breaks.

Great Lebanon does leap:
And Syrion, by his Motion borne,
Like a young Unicorne.

From clouds when Lightning glides.

And barren Kadesh shakes.

Rends forests with His Winds.
And all His glory must declare,
Who in His Temple are.

Does King for ever reign.

And bless them long with peace.
PSALM. XXX.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

For Thou have lifted me on high:
Nor made me a scorn to those,
Who were my life's professed foes.

Who have in mercy healed me.
My Soul Thou broughtest from the grave,
And from the pit of Hell did save.

To sing your Makers endless praise:
Remember still with thanks to bless,
And magnify His Holiness.

His favor life restored has.
Our weeping may endure a night,
But joy comes with the morning light,

My bases are for ever laid:
I shall not from my place remove,
But stand supported by Thy love.
No change of times, or fortunes hate
Can overthrow my happy state:
For thou my Mountain made so strong,
I shall on earth continue long.
Yet, whilst exalted in my thought,
I was to sudden trouble brought:
And soon as Thou did hide Thy face,
My comforts vanished hence apace.

With humble supplication cry.
I did to God my plaint address,
Thus pouring forth my heaviness.

What profit is there in my blood?
What triumph can Thou gain by it,
When I go down into the pit?
Shall silent dust, or darkness have
A tongue to praise Thee in the grave?
Or those, in earth who closed are,
From their low Cells Thy truth declare?

And from Thy dwelling succor send.

Have into Songs and Dances turned.
My Sackcloth Thou did off me take,
And cheerful robes of gladness make:
That I Thy praises might renew;
To whom incessant thanks are due.
PSALM. XXXI.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Save me from shame, as Thou art just.

Be Thou my strong defense at need.

O for Thy Names sake me direct!

Which they for me have closely set.

For Thou, O God, did purchase it.

But on the Lord my trust relies.

Who have my Soul in trouble known.

To liberty my feet enlarge.

Mine eye, and soul both wast with grief,
Through sin I sigh away my days:
My bones consume, my strength decays.

I am; whilst friends avoid my sight.

And useless, as a broken pot.

Who counsel took against my life.

Thou art my God, my help, I said.

Whose short-lived date by Thee is span'd.
Me never to the power expose,
Or hand, of persecuting foes.

To save me through Thy grace incline.

Who daily on Thy Name does call.
Let wicked men confusion have,
Put down to silence in the grave.

The just by slanders to traduce.

For those thee fear, whose faith thee sought?

Kept safe from men's insulting pride.
And from the tongues malicious strife,
As in a tower, defend their life.

Whose strong protection me secures.

I am cut off before Thine eyes.
Yet have Thou not my suit denied,
When in my Prayer to Thee I cried.

And with revenge the proud rewards.

To strengthen both your hopes, and hearts.
PSALM. XXXII.

To pardon finds access:
Whose sin, with all he did amiss,
Forgot, and covered is.

Imputes no crime abhord:
Whose spirit right, whose heart is straight,
And harbors no deceit.

I was with anguish pained.
My bones wax't old through discontent:
My days in moanes were spent.

Not resting night or day.
My Moisture was to nothing brought,
Like fields in Summers drought.

And no offense concealed.
And, soon as my confession said,
My peace with Thee was made.

What time Thou may be found.
Nor shall the floods, which highest go,
Thy servants overflow.

From dangers troubled tide:
With Songs of Thy delivery
I shall encompast ly.

How thou this bliss shall reach:
And with mine eye I thee will guide,
Least thou should tread aside.

Whom reason cannot rule:
Whose stubborn mouths the bit, and reine,
From fury must restreine.

For wicked men attend.
But those, in God their trust who place,
Sure mercies shall embrace.
Be glad ye righteous, and rejoice,
Who make the Lord your choice.
With shouts alowd your joy impart
All ye upright in heart.
PSALM. XXXIII.

For praise becomes th'upright.

The ten-string'd instrument,

With their melodious noise.

And all His works are true.

All earth his goodness fills.
The Heavens bright host, and all beneath
He formed with His breath.

Heaped in His store house keep.

Of Him then stand in fear.

The world unmoved stands.

The Lord will bring to naught.

And thoughts unchanged be.

And for His Lot elects.



And work to light is brought.

Nor man with might endu'd.

To reskue by his force.

Are ever in his Eye;

And life from famine save.
Our soul does wait for God our shield;


As we believe in Thee.
PSALM. XXXIV.

His praises still record;

The humble shall rejoice.

Exalt His Name on high;
I sought Him, who my prayer heard,
And saved from all I feared.

No shame their faces bear:

Relieve his misery.

Who in His fear are sound.

To such as faithful be.

For such no blessings miss.
Young Lions often lacking prey,
With hunger pine away.
But those that seek His Covenant
No good thing ever want,

I you His fear will teach.

Or happy days would have?

Thy lips from speaking guile.

Pursue, and seek for peace.

His ears admit their cries.

To cut them from their place.

In trouble safety sends.

And saves souls contrite.

But He releives in all.

Nor broken shall be one.

And with just vengeance pay.
All such as do the righteous hate,
Shall soon be desolate.

And dear their faith esteems.
PSALM. XXXV.
As Psalm 51.

Against them fight who me oppose.

Draw out Thy all-subduing spear.
Stop Thou my persecutors way;
Soul, I am thy salvation, say.

Who to procure my hurt conspire.

Let them be by God's Angel chased:

And let His Angel them pursue.

And for my soul did pits prepare.

In their contrived destruction fall.


Who keep'st the poor from suffering wrong,
And help'st the needy against the strong.

And things unknown to me devise.

To spoil my soul, and life to spill.

I did for them both pray, and fast;

Or for my Mother did I mourn.

Yea abjects in my scorn combined.

By flowting me, delight the guests.

Nor reskue to my soul afford?
O save me from destructions jaws;
My darling from the Lions paws.

Will thanks and praises multiply.

Or wink upon me with their eyes.

Disturbing those of quiet life.

Ha ha, our eye has seen it, cried.
O Lord! Thou their despite do see:
Nor silence keep, nor absent be.

My cause to Thy protection take.



Who love my hurt, my quiet loath.

Extol the Lord with loud applause;
Whose goodness does his servant raise:

PSALM. XXXVI.

No fear of God he has.

Becoming all men's hate.

He is nor good, nor wise.

By ways abhorred thrives.

The hills Thy justice teach.

Are like th'un-fathom'd deep.

Mankind ore-shadowing.

Who drink of Thy pure springs.

We shall behold the light.

To the upright in heart.

Nor wicked hands assail.

And never shall arise.
PSALM. XXXVII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

At those that work iniquity.

Cut down and withered like the grass,

So shall thou dwelling have, and food.
Delight in Him, and for thy hire,
He give thee will thy hearts desire.

By whom our actions crowned are.

Clear as the day, or noontide bright.

Whose wicked projects prosper yet.

To greater evils thee betray.

But good men long on earth shall stay.

Though sought, thou shall not find their place,

Inheriting the promised land:
Their blessings here on earth increase,
With plenty crowned, and lasting peace.

By plots would circumvent th'upright.

Whose vengefull day is coming nigh.

To slay the just, is their intent.

And all their bows shall broken ly.

Then wicked rich men's wealthy store.

But God the righteous does uphold.

And will prolong their heritage;

In days of famine still relieved.

Shall vanish as the Smoakes that rise;
Dissolved, and melted into fume,
As does the fat of Lambs consume.

The good both lend, and give away,

The bad cut off, and cursed stand.
Second Part.

Who does in His commands delight.

For God's right hand does him sustain.

Yet never did my eyes behold
The just forsaken, or unfed;
Or see his children beg their bread.

And ever blessed in his seed.
Depart from evil, and do well;
That you with Him may ever dwell.

But sinners of their race bereaves.

And dwell in endless Happiness.

A righteous mouth will exercise.

Nor shall his goings ever slide.

To shed his blood confederate;

Or by a wrongful sentence die.

That He to life exalt thee may:
When thou the wicked men shall see
Cut off, and quite extinguished be.

Like spreading Lawrells fresh and green:

Not found again, nor thought upon.

For such a man in peace shall end.

Are in their death cut off at last.
God to the righteous help does raise;
He is their strength in troubled days.
His aid shall save them from the unjust;
Because in Him they plant their trust.
PSALM. XXXVIII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Nor Thy rebukes in fury taste.

Thy pressing hand does me confound.

Because my sin does Thee displease.
Nor will that guilt Thou do detest
Afford my troubled conscience rest.

My sinking head have overflow'n.
They burden me with care, and fear;
And are become too great to bear.

My foul offense, and folly tell:

By night I wake, by day I mourn.

And all my body seems one wound.

And roar, beneath They heavy stroke.

My hidden groans to Thee aspire.

Of light deprived are mine eyes.

Far from my sore themselves remove.
My kindred my converses shun;
Nor come to comfort, but look on.

Intent upon my mischiefs are.
With foul reproaches, and false lies,
My ruin daily they devise.

Did never into passion break:

Which might my griefs impatience tell.

To hear my moan, and quell my foes.

Triumphed at my overthrow.

My sorrows are continual:
And whilst my faults are in my view,
They do as often my pain renew.

And with contrition beg redress.
I will the guilt of my offense
Wash off with tears of penitence.

And live to do me further wrong.
Each day their number does increase,
Who are the haters of my peace.

Who make returns of ill for good:
Yet know no cause for their despite,
But that I follow what is right.

That Thou will never me forsake.
My God! O never far depart,
Who my releife, and comfort art.

Thou God of my salvation:
Afford thy help in time of need,
And to my reskue come with speed.
PSALM. XXXIX.

And least my tongue offend,
My mouth shall bownd and bridled be,
Whilst I the wicked see.

Even ceasing to speak good;
Until at last my grieved heart
Was urged with sorrows smart:

For lack of vent a flame;
And then my tongue these words expressed,
Breathed forth from my disrest.

How far my days extend;
That I may know how I am frail,
Each moment apt to fail.

No longer then a span:
His age as nothing is, and he
At best but vanity:
Man like a shadow walks in vain,
Wasting his time with pain;
He heaps up riches, yet not knows
What heir shall them dispose.

Whilst I stay here rely?
Truly my hope shall wait on Thee,
My joys there treasured be.

And help me in distress;
Let not the foolish me deride,
Or scorn me in their pride.

Prepared to obey:
I did not murmur at my pain,
Or of Thy hand complain.

To take away Thy stroke;
For I consume, and my faint breath
Is yielding up to death.

Rebuking his neglect,
Thou make his beauty soon consume
Like to the wandering fume.
Sickness destroys him, as a moath
Corrodes and frets the cloth.
So vain is man, and quickly gone
Into corruption.

Be deaf unto my tears:
For I with Thee a stranger am,
And but to sojourne came.

Till I recover strength,
Before I go from this worlds shore,
And shall be seen no more.
PSALM. XL.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Who to my cry His ear did lend:

And miry clay wherein I stuck.
And on the rock He set my feet,
From whence my goings nere should fleet.

That men may fear, and trust Him still.

Whose constant faith on God does rest:
And never will the proud ones prize,
Nor such as turn aside to lies.

And loving toward us is Thy thought:
If I would speak and them declare,
They more then can be numbered are.

Nor sin-oblation burnt in fire.
Thou pierced, and opened have mine ear;
(To show what gifts more pleasing were:)

The volume of the book foretold:

Yea in my heart Thy Law I write.

Thy truth in great assemblies preach:

But unto men Thy love revealed.

But still preserve me in Thy love:

My sin-prest soul is vexed with cares.

O Lord! to give me help make have.

Who at my souls destruction aim.
Let them repulsed back retire,
Who wish my fall, or hurt desire.

Who, Fie upon thee, say in hate.

Their joys and comforts loud proclaim:
Let all, who Thy salvation love,
Say always, Praised be God above.

Thou not exclud'st me from Thy thought.
Thou my redeemer art, and stay;
My God! O make no long delay.
PSALM. XLI.
Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandments.

He help from God in trouble finds.

Nor gives him up to enemies.

By God he shall be strengthened:
By Thee, when weak and lowest laid,
His bed is in his sickness made.

For, (Lord,) against Thee I sinned have.

And loose both Name, and Memory?

When gone, traduce me in report.

To hurt me in their calumnies.

(Say they,) and never more shall rise:

Lifts up his heel to spurn my head.

That I their malice may requite.

If not triumphed by my foe.

And in Thy presence me retain.
Jacob then
Through all enduring times: Amen.
PSALM. XLII.

Flies to the Brooks retreat:
O God! my soul pursued, and faint,
So after Thee does pant.

For God does hourly thirst.
When shall I come Thy presence near,
And in Thy sight appear?

I had no meat at all:
While they, where is thy God do cry,
On whom thou do rely?

And those glad times deplore,
When to Thy house we thronged with praise,
To keep Thy Holy days.

My heart cast down and vexed?
Hope thou in God, and praise Him still,
Whose help up-raise thee will.

Within finds no releife.
But Jordans Land, and Hermon hill
I will remember still.

At Thy loud Water-falls:
Thy waves, and billows highest run,
All over me have gone.

To shine on me by day:
And I my songs and Prayers all night
Send to the God of light.

Am I forgot at length?
Before my foes why do I mourn,
Oppressed, and forlorn?

I am with swords trans-fixt:
Whilst flouting at my misery,
Where is Thy God? they cry.

My heart cast down, and vexed?
Hope thou in God, and praise Him still;
Whose help up-raise thee will.
PSALM. XLIII.

With them that know no Laws.
Deliver me from the unjust,
In fraud and wrong that trust.

Why do Thou me reject?
Why go I thus in mourning dressed,
By enemies oppressed?

Thy truth to keep me right?
That of Thy holy dwellings I
May make discovery.

A joyful offering:
And on the harp my ditties raise,
To celebrate Thy praise.

Down in thy sorrows cast?
Or wherefore, my afflicted heart,
Thou so disturbed art?
Trust in the Lord: for I will praise,
And thank Him, all my days.
Who cures, and crowns life's short annoyes
With never ending joys.
PSALM. XLIV.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

What Thou have done in times of old.

To plant Thy people in their land.

Those fair possessions for their lot:
But thy right hand, thine arm of might,
Because in them Thou took'st delight.

Deliverance to Jacob bring.

And those tread down, who against us rise.

It Is not my sword deliver must:

And all that hate us put to shame.

And praise Thy Name, great Lord of hoasts!

Nor with our Armies forth do go.

Whilst they, which hate us, spoil and burn.

Like sheep, to scatter and devour.

Not richer, when to price is brought:

Laughed at, and with reproaches torn:

The Heathen shake their head, and flowt,

And shame has covered my face.

Who Thee blaspheme, and me deride;

Thy self, or Covenant forgot.

Nor do our feet Thy ways forsake;

And with death's shadow covered ore.

Or unto Idols worship gave:
Shall not his search the sin impart,
Who knows the secrets of each heart?

We all the day-long killed are:
Counted as sheep for shambles bred,
Fit only to be slaughtered.

Still will Thou us at distance keep?

Who ly oppressed, and grieved by foes?

To earth our belly cleaves down.

And save us for Thy mercies sake.
PSALM. XLV.

Which of the King I write.
And like a ready pen, my tongue
Frames her triumphant song.

Thy lips are full of grace.
Therefore thy God on thee does power
His blessings endless store.

For Truth, and Justice fight.

The terror of Thy hand.

Who dare the King oppose:
Whereby subdued at Thy call,
The vanquished people fall.

Thy Scepter just, and pure:

And wickedness detest.
Therefore thy God has Thee preferred,
And by a love unheard,
The oil of gladness on Thy head,
Above Thy fellows, shed.

Upon Thy garments dwell,
Out of the Ivory Palaces
Provided Thee to please.

Nor to attend disdain,
The Queen, upon Thy right hand placed,
With gold of Ophir graced.

Forget thy parents dear:

Whom, as thy Lord, adore.

Thy favor shall entreat.

All glorious art within.

Shall to the King be brought.
The Virgins which upon her wait,
Shall add unto Thy State.

To enter the Kings Court:

And many Princes breed.

Shall mentioned be with fame;
Whilst the glad people Thy renown
With endless praises crown.
PSALM. XLVI.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Rests wholly on His providence:
Which still affords a present aid,
When greatest troubles us invade.

Though the fixed earth removed were:
Or though the hills, and mountains steep
Lay buried in the angry Deep.

The Mountains with their swelling shake*

Gods City, His fair dwelling place.

Are kept that they can never move.
For He, when dangers Her distress,
His early succor shall address.

Disturbed with strife, and threats of war.
But He the tempest can allay,
And cause the earth to melt away.
The Lord of Hosts does us direct;
Great Jacobs God does us protect:

What desolations He has brought.

And crowns the bleeding earth with peace:
He breaks the bow, and crackes the spear;
In fire the Chariots burned were.

Both earth, and Heaven must obey.

Great Jacobs God does us protect.
PSALM. XLVII.

To God in triumph shout.

With awful Majesty.

And will our portion choose;
Which does in glory far excel;
The Lot of Israel.

And sounding trumpets noise.
Unto our God loud praises sing;
Sing praises to our King.

With knowledge sing, and skill:

And ore the Heathen reigns.

Sprung out of Abra'm's loyne.
For all are in His care enrolled,
Who highly is extolled.
PSALM. XLVIII.

In Salem His blessed seat.
Sion beauteous is for site,
The spacious earth's delight.
Upon the sides which Northward rise,
The Great King's City lies.

Is for a refuge known.

Her glories down to tear:
They saw with marvail her defense,
In trouble hasting thence.

Like pangs which women bear.
Tarshish sail
With Thy strong Eastern gale.
Salem, unto God endeared,
We saw, what often we heard:
The Lord of Hosts will her defend,
And stablish to the end.

We have Thy mercies brought.

So endless is Thy fame.
Thy hand is full of righteousness.
Let Sion joy express.
Judah's daughter gladly sing
The judgments of their King.
Sions Mount;
Her stately Towers recount;

And to your Children tell.

Till time expired ends,
His favors on This place to breath,
And guide us unto death.
PSALM. XLIX.
As Psalm 51.



My heart deep knowledge meditate.

Dark sayings on the harp divine.

When sin, or death assault my heel?


Or bring back life, when fled away;
Or unto God his ransom pay;

Can it recall, or expiate:)

And not of earth's corruption taste.

Like to the fool, and brutish dies:
And all the wealth, which they have got,
Must then become another lot,
Yet they suppose their dwelling place
Shall last through each succeeding race;
And to their lands their names bequeath,
To keep them living after death.

Like beasts that perish, comes to naught.

Who them survive, praise all they say.

For death to feed on, dishes made.
The just in light eternal reigns,
Whilst others pomp in dust remains.

From power of the wide-mouthed grave.

When one of these is wealthy made:
Or when with plenty filled, and ease,
His houses glory does increase.

But stripped of all his honor lies.

Applauding his false happiness:
And men that course in worldings praise,
Which most the appetite obaies.

And never more shall see the light.
Man, who in honor nothing knows,
From hence, like beasts that perish, goes.
PSALM. L.
To the proper Tune.

Unto the earth did call,
From the Suns light
To his declining fall.
Sion fair
The Lord himself has shone,

In noise and terror known.
Ushered with Flame
Wrapped in a stormy cloud,

To earth his judgment loud.

To me with offerings sworn;

The justice by Him borne.

O Israel, I speak,
And witness bear
Against thee, my Laws do break.

Thy sacrifices fail,

Nor Bullocks from thy stall.

Which the wild Forests feed,
Even to the least
Which thousand hills do breed:

Which on the Mountains fly,
The wild beasts owe
Which in the desartly.

I need not tell it thee;
The whole worlds meat,
And it, belongs to me.

Bulls flesh, why should thou think,
Burnt in the fire?
Or blood of goats would drink?

And pay to God thy vows;
This offering
He as the best allows:

In thine afflicted days,
I save thee shall,
And thou shall give Me praise.

(Says God) why should you dare,
The Laws I made,
Or Statutes to declare?
Why do ye vaunt
In your un-hallow'd mouth,
My Covenant?


When thou a thief had seen:
Thy foul intent
Has with adult'rers been.

Thy mouth do dedicate,
Thy false tongue still
Is uttering deceit:

To work thy brothers shame,
And full of spite
Thy Mothers son defame.

And whilst I silent sat,
Thou thought Me one
Who had, like thee, forgate.
But I will have,
And ordered before thine eyes
Present at last
All these impieties.

Who God, nor judgment fear,
Least angered He
Your souls in pieces tear.

Me honors; and th'upright,
After earthes days,
Shall dwell in endless light.
PSALM. LI.
To the proper Tune.

Who thus dejected fly to Thee:
According to Thy boundless love
The weight of mine offense remove.

Thy wonted streams of pardon bring.
O wash my leprous soul again,
And cleanse me from this bloody stain.

The knowledge of this wickedness:
Against Thee have I sinned alone,
Who art my Judge, for what is done.
I cannot hide the blood I spilt,
Nor will excuse my secret guilt.
That at Thy bar when I am tried,
Thy sentence might be justified.

In sin conceived with sorrow Borne;
And have improved, by act and thought,
Those spots which to the world I brought.

And only can that grace inspire:
Thou therefore shall, who wisdom art,
With understanding fill my heart.
Hyssop, then my soul
Shall cleansed be, though never so foul.
Wash me, and my black crimes will grow
More white, then is the falling snow.

So shall my broken bones rejoice.

Nor let them in remembrance stay.

Renew my soul, chaste thoughts impart:

Nor of thy guiding grace deprive.
Restore Thy comfort yet at last,
And let Thy spirit keep me fast:

And sinners shall conversion reach.

O God Thou Author of my good.

And then thy praises shall be sung.

Or any offering made by fire.

Are broken hearts, and souls contrite.

On Sions low calamity:
Build up neglected Salems wall,
Whose Structures now to ruin fall.

With our devout oblations pleased:
Who heaps of Incense up will fling,
And bullocks to Thine Altar bring.
PSALM. LII.

Thou can do mischeife yet?
Gods constant goodness will prevent
Thy murtherous intent.

Like rasors cut thy lies.

Deceit, not truth, approv'st.

But God shall, by His power,

Thy name from heaven raze.

Which wicked ones must bear:
And all their malice vainly tried
With laughter shall deride.

For his assured repose:
But strong in violence, and stealth,
Relied upon his wealth.

Like a green Olive tree:
And on Thy mercy all my days
My confidence will raise.

My praises offer still;
And on Thy saving Name await,
Which Saints must celebrate.
PSALM. LIII.

There is no God, has said.
Corrupted is with sin their mind;
And none to good inclined.

And down on men did look;
To see, if any Him would know,
Or seek His truth below.

To filthiness is gone:
His Law by none is understood;
There is not one does good.

That work iniquity?
Who eat my people up as bread;
Nor God have worshipped.

Their bones has scattered quite.
Through Gods just vengeance, and despise,
In shame their glory lies.
Sion help were sent,
To end our banishment!
For Jacobs Offspring then in peace
Should joy in their release.
PSALM. LIVE.

With judgment do me right.
Be Thou to my request attent,


Strangers, who thee despise.

For those that take my part.

And cut my foes away.

And I will praise Thy Name.
His goodness me from trouble saves,
And gives them timelesse graves.
Mine eye on those sees his desire,
Who did my fall conspire.
PSALM. LV.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

From my request not hidden far.

Who lowdly mourn in my complaint.

Mine innocence decryes with noise;
And bad oppressors That impute,
Which does their wrath and hatred suit.

Death's falling terrors does sustain;

Orewhelm'd with horror, thus I said:

Like doves to fly, and be at rest:

And to the desert take my flight.

And this fierce tempest 'scape at last.

For in the City strife I spied.

Wherein all mischeifes do abound:

Deceit and guile in every street.

For then I could have borne the abuse:
No public hate against me revealed;
Then should I have my self concealed.

In equal conversation tried.

And to Gods house together went.

Strange, as unlook't for, seize their breath.
Let them go down alive to hell;
For wickedness with them does dwell.

Who saves me from their plotted fall.

To Him that hears me will I pray.

Delivered from their bloody strife
Who were in battle opposite:
For many then for me did fight.

By God imposed, who 'bides of old.
Because they in no changes were,
They grow secure, and God not fear.

Who were enleagu'd with him in peace:
His friendly vow he did recant,
And break his solemn Covenant.

But in his heart is cruel war:
More soft then Oil his flattering words;
Yet were they sharper then draw'n swords.

Who shall sustain, and keep thee fast.

In pic of wide destruction throw'n:
Men treacherous, of blood, and strife,
Shall find long troubles, and short life;
Nor half their days completed see:
But I will ever trust in Thee.
PSALM. LVI.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

For Man combines to swallow me.
He daily does against me fight,
By Power to oppress my right.

My life assail and would devour.
O Thou most High! they many are,
Who have conspired in this war.

I fly for shelter to Thy aid.

I know no flesh can do me harm.

Close mischeife plotting in their breast.

To overthrow me in the dark.

Defeat their plots, and cast them down.

Must be unto Thy Audit brought:
Thou bott'lest all the tears I shed;
My sighs are book'd, and numbered.

I know my foes shall faint, and fly.



My knees in thanks to Thee shall bow.

And do my feet from falling save:
That with the living in Thy sight
I may enjoy Eternal light.
PSALM. LVII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Whose soul does only trust in Thee.
To Thy wing's shadow will I have,
Till these calamities be past.

Who always sends deliverance.

Who would both life, and fame devour.

Even sons of men with hate enflamed:
Whose teeth are spears, and darts; whose words
More piercing, and more sharp then swords.

Exalted be Thy Majesty!

But in their own pits fallen are.

I Will Anthems sing with praises mixed.

I early will addresses make.



Exalted by Thy Majesty.
PSALM. LVIII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

O sons of men judge ye upright?

Only full weight of violence.
The wicked men, to life when come,
Estranged are, even from the womb;
They go astray, though newly borne,
They utter lies with lips forsworn.

And like deaf adders stop their ear;

Although he charm them nere so well.

Like the young Lions Sharpened fang.

And cut their arrows as they fly.

Or women's births before their time.

Let whirlwinds blow them from their place.

To wash their feet in wicked blood.

Rewards for just ones, plagues for bad.
PSALM. LIX.
Sing this as the Lamentation.


Lo, for my Soul they ly in wait;
The mighty are confederate.
Yet is it not for my offense,
They thus prepare to take me hence.

Thy help withhold not from me long.

Of all the Heathen vengeance take:
Let not Thy grace to them extend,
Who with malicious hearts offend.

Which snarling through the City run:

And in their lips they carry swords.
For who (say they) our acts shall hear?
Or hinder us, when we appear?

And strike the heathen in their pride.

Who by Thy strength shall guarded be.

Mine eye shall see their ill events.

Least it forget my people may.

Themselves their lies and curses wound.
Great King! consume them in thine ire;


And grudge, when lacking what to eat.

Yea long before the day does spring,
My thankful hymns shall sound aloud
The Mercy Thou to me have showed.
Thou art in trouble my defense,
A refuge for my innocence.

For Thou do help, and mercy bring.
PSALM. LX.

We have strange countries troad;
O turn, and let our wandering feet
In our own dwellings meet.

And broke in factious jarrs:
Heal Thou the breach Thy fury makes,
For our foundation shakes.

And to amazement led.
Thou minglest Thy Revenges cup,
And we have drunk it up.

To gather those that strayed.
Thy truth and wonted pity shall
Our banishment recall.

From all invasion free,
Thy right hand for their safety rear,
And their petitions hear.

He would his servants bless.
I will divide fair Shechem's soil,
And Succoth's valley spoil.
Manasseh, Gilead, both are mine;
In war shall Ephraim shine.
But Iudahs Scepter all must awe,
And give my people Law.
Moab shall be a dunghill grow'n;
Proud Edom overthrow'n:
Philistia's boasted triumphs shall
Be buried in her fall.

Fierce Edoms strength, and head?
That I may break her fensed gate,
And trample on her state.

And made our force their scoff,
Wilt not Thou with our armies go,
To quell the insulting foe?

For help of man is vain.

And foil our enemies.
PSALM. LXI.

My Prayer not deny;

To Thee I make my moan.
Thou to that rock of strength shall lead
My care-oppressed head;

Against all violence.

Will dwell eternally;
Whilst my unshaken hopes endure,
Under Thy wing secure.
For Thou O God have heard my vow;
Thou my desire do know:
From whom the heritages came
To those that fear Thy Name.

And give His years increase:

May dwell in endless light.
Thy mercy, and Thy truth prepare;
Which his preservers are.

And vows performed bring.
PSALM. LXII.

Whence comes salvation.

I shall not greatly move.

Swift death shall you surprise.
Ye shall be like a bowing wall,
Or tottering fences fall.

Whom God lifts to renown:
They blessings with their mouth impart,
But curses from their heart.

My expectation.

I shall not move from hence.

My strength and refuge blessed.

Your heart before Him power.

Are lies, and vanity:
And all alike in balance laid,
Weigh lighter then the shade.

Nor robberies unjust.
If wealth increase, your heart nere set
Upon the gains you get.

His power is to be feared:

Each work its recompense.
PSALM. LXIII.

My thoughts addressed be.
And early as the rising day,
I will before Thee pray.
My thirsting soul, and longing flesh
Beg, Thou will them refresh,
In that dry land, where fruits nere grow,
Nor streams of water flow.

May see Thy Majesty;
And Thy bright glory may behold,
As I had seen of old.

Then life, or earthly bliss:
My lips shall therefore praises give,

Thus unto Thee, whose Name is feared,
My hands shall be up-reard.

When thus my mouth's employed.

With crosses wearied:
And in the watches of the night,
Thy goodness I recite.

To Thee, my Help, I sing:

Whose Right hand me defends.

Shall sink into the grave.

Or make them foxes prey.

With those that by Him swear:
When all the mouths of such as ly,
Stopped, and confounded die.
PSALM. LXIV.

My life from foes defend.

And risings of the proud.

As darts, shoot bitter words:

The perfect man may slay.

Of snares make private speech;
Which when in secret laid, They cry,
What eyes shall them descry?

Most diligent to kill:
Which in their heart concealed deep
Their thoughts in secret keep.

Wound their malicious heart:

As causer of their fall.
Then those deride them shall, that see,
And from their vengeance flee:

God's work these judgments are.
For wisely they consider on,
And ponder what is done.

And glory in His trust.
PSALM. LXV.

Where we perform our vows.

To Thee all flesh shall come.

Thy mercies though nere fail:
Who our transgressions from thy sight
Remov'st, and purgest quite.

Within Thy Courts to sit:
For with Thy Temples beauty he
Shall satisfied be.

Wilt dreadful wonders show!
Thou hope of all earth's bounds contain,
Or far dilated Maine.

On their foundation placed:

And still the People's rage.

Thy fearful tokens tell:
Thou make the outgoings of the morn,
And nights thy praise adorn.

Then giv'st her store of grain.
Such plenty Gods full river yields
TO enrich the thirsty fields.

Take in Thy blessings stores.

Thy clouds drop fatness down.

The hills with joy resound;

With corn the valleys sing.
PSALM. LXVI.

Ye lands lift up your voice.

Report His glorious fame.

The works Thou do prepare!
To Thee, who in great power do sit,
Shall all Thy foes submit.

The earth before Thee fall.

Shown in His children's sight.

Wher-on their foot did stand.

The Nations that rebel.

And cause His praise be heard:

Nor lets our feet to slide.

Like silver purified:

Our loins afflicted are.

To trample on our head;
We went through fire, and water past;
Yet sav'dst Thou us at last.

A thankful Offering.

Devoutly shall be paid.

Whilst clouds of Incense rise:
Rams, Goats, with Bullocks from the stall
Shall at Thy Altar fall.

How large Gods favors are;

And with my tongue extolled.

I shall not then be heard.

My prayers voice to hear.

Who granted my request:
Who has not turned away His face,
Nor held from me His grace.
PSALM. LXVII.

And blessings on us send;
O let Thy Light and Face Divine,
Upon They servants shine.

Be known to Gentiles may;
And nations of the Universe
Thy saving health rehearse.

Their voice to sing Thy praise.
O God! let them with joy express
To Thee their thankfulness.

With gladness to their King:
For thou the world shall judge with right,
And rule the earth with might.

Their voice to sing Thy praise;
O God, let them with joy express
To Thee their thankfulness.

In plenty, and in peace:
And God, our God, in blessings shown,
Shall us His people own.

To us shall blessings give.
That all the ends of earth may fear,
And duty to Him bear.
PSALM. LXVIII.

And scattered be His enemies.
And let all those that hate Him, flee

So perish wicked men like sumes;
Or melted wax, which fire consumes.

And unto God life up their voice.

To Him that rides upon the cloud.
The Name of great Jehovah bless,

For he relieves the widows wants;

And frees the Captives from their chain;
Whilst rebels are with hunger slain.

And marches through the desert tread,

And Sinai was with terror struck.

When faint and weary, plenties store:
Thy congregation Thou did feed;
Reliev'dst the poor, and help'dst their need.

And numerous preachers it record.

Whilst women did divide the spoil.

Ye shall again with luster shine;
Like to the doves fair plumed wing,
As Gold, or Silver glistering.

The land was like to Salmon white.
Bashans hill,
Whose height does earth with wonder fill.

This is the hill where God will dwell.

Thousands of Angels serve His war.
Second Part.

And captive led captivity:
Did ransom those who did rebel;
That God might still among them dwell.

Who loads us daily with His wealth.

The issues does command from death.

Who wilfully in sins are led.

From Bashan bring, and through the deep.

Of fallen, and dying enemies,)
May dipped be in slaughters flood;
And tongues of dogs lick up their blood.

Did in Thy Sanctuary go:

Then Damsels with their Timbrels went.
Jacob spring:
Benjamin their Ruler bring.
With Princely Judah on the Throne,
Strong Nepthali, and Zebulon.

O let Thy work confirmed stand.

In Salems Temple offered be.

Those scatter, who in war delight.
Egypts Princes, and the Moore,
With hands stretched out shall thee adore.

To God, who 'bove the Heavens does ride.
His mighty voice He out does send:


With terror do thy foes amaze.
He strength and power to Israel gives:
Blessed be God, whoever lives.
PSALM. LXIX.

The furious waters roll:

Orewhelm'd by every wave.

My throat is hoarse, and dry.
My failing eyes their strenght abate,
Whilst for my God I wait.

The hairs upon my head:
And though I things not took restore,
They wrong, and hate me more.

My sins to Thee are show'n.
Let none that seek, or wait for Thee,
Through me confounded be.

Shame covered has my face:

Who from my Mother came.

Thy wrongs reputing mine.

That my reproach was turned.

A Proverb grow'n of scorn:

And made the drunkards song.

In Thy accepted time:
O for Thy Truth, and mercies sake,
Hear those requests I make.

Where envious floods conspire;

Nor let the pit enclose.

Let me Thy mercy find:
Hide not Thy Face in time of need;
But hear my moan with speed.
Second Part.

Lost in my foes esteem.

And those who me defame.

Pressed down with sorrows stroke.
For pity I, and comfort look,
But friends have me forsook.

They gave me Gall to eat:

Their peace turn to despair.

Their loins through terror shake.

Let vengeance them devour.

Their habitation raze.

The woundeds grief renew.

Let them thy presence fly:

Nor with thy Saints enroll.

O raise me up again:

And thankful ditties frame.

Will God much better please,
Then fatted Oxen from the stall,
Which on His Altar fall.

whose hopes on God are stayed.

His prisoners not despise.

With all in them have birth.

For Judah to possess.

Inherit shall this place.
And those, that love His glorious Name,
For ever there remain.
PSALM. LXX.

Thy speedy help I crave.

That seek my soul to wound.
Let them disgraced all retire,
That do my hurt desire:
Aba, in scorn,
To shameful ruin turn.

Rejoice and gladded be.
Let them, who in thy love confide,
Say, God be magnified.

O God, to me make speed:
Thou art my help, and only stay;
O Lord, make no delay.
PSALM. LXXI.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Confound me never with disgrace:

Incline Thine ear, and succor me.

Who art my Rock, and only Fort.

From cruel men, and bloody hands.

My trust and Comfort from my youth:

When brought forth in my Mothers pain,
Thou from her bowels did me bring;
Of Thee my praise shall ever sing:

My strong defense on Thee is laid.

And with Thy honor all my days:

Nor me forsake when strength does fail.
Mine enemies combine with hate,
And for my Soul lay daily wait:

For God and man does him forsake.

My God, to succor me make speed:

Who seek my Soul with hate to wound.
Reproach them who conspire my hurt,
And my affliction make their Sport.

But I will praise Thee more and more.

Whose number I could never know.

Thy goodness only mention.

To speak the wonders thou have wrought

Till to this Age Thy power is told.

Who equal can Thy mighty deeds?

Shall quicken me (O Lord) again:
Thy hand shall bring me from the deep,
Though buried low in earth I sleep:
Thou shall my greatness then increase,
And comfort me with endless peace.

On Psalteries Thy truth I Will praise:
And on the harp Thy mercies tell,
O Holy one of Israel!

My soul, which Thou from death did bring;

Who do my foes confound with shame.
PSALM. LXXII.
As Psalm 51.

And from his Son let Justice spring.

And equity the poor defend.

The hills by righteousness increase.

But break oppressors in the grave.

So long as Sun, and Moon appear.
He shall, like rain on grass new mow'n,
Or showers that water earth, come down.

And Peace abound, whilst light displayes.

And from the flood to earths end stretch.

His Foes, as dust His feet below.
Tarshish, the Isles, with Sheba's King,
And Seba shall their presents bring.

And every Nation serve His crown.



And precious their blood esteem.
Sheba shall Gold for Tribute pay;
Men praise Him still, and for Him pray.

Upon the tops of Mountains borne,
Like Lebanon full fruits shall power;
The people flourish like the flower.

About the world his course does run.
Blessings through Him descend on all;
And Nations shall Him Blessed call.
Blessed be God, whose every act
His Servants wonder does attract.

Be with His glory filled: Amen.
PSALM. LXXIII.
Sing this as Psalm 119.
Israel is kind;
To those are clean in mind.

Almost forsook their path.

At fools, and sinners peace:

Nor lessened are in strength.

Nor plagued with common care.

Compassed, as with a chain:
And as a garment for defense,
Covered with violence.

And wealth their wish excells.

And arrogantly speak.

Their tongue through earth does walk.

How prosperous sinners be:
And vexed with their sorrows sense,
Incline to their defense.

How should we think, God knows;

And daily grow in wealth?

I cleanse my heart in vain.
In vain my hands held from offense,
I wash in innocence.

I have afflicted been;
My Soul, with wants and sorrows worn^,
Was chast'ned every morn.

But thus disturbed speak;
I might thy Children so offend,
And Thee blaspheming end.
Second Part.

Hard to be understood:
Nor, till I to Thy Temple went,
Could know, what these things meant.
Then I discerned, what they portend,
And how the wicked end:

Do unto ruin cast.

To desolation brought?
They in a moment turned to tears
Consume by their own fears.

Their Image vanish makes.
Causing their late admirers eyes
Them now as much despise.

And anguish pricked my reins;

Am I, so like a beast.

Held up by Thy Right hand.

Then crown with Thine Elect.

Who can my Savior be?
And through the spacious earth I none
Desire, but Thee alone.
My drooping heart does daily fail,
My flesh corrupt and frail:
But Thou the strength'ner of my heart,
And lasting portion art.

Shall perish utterly.
For Thou destroy'st, and castest low
Such as to Idols bow.

That I to God draw near:
To Thee my hopes entrusted are,
Who will Thy works declare.
PSALM. LXXIV.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Regardlesse of Thy Servants wrong?
Or wherefore does Thy kindled ire,
Thy sheep and Pastures burn like fire?

Nor let Mount Sion be forgot.
And may the tribe thou did redeem,
Be ever dear in Thy esteem.

Who against Thy Church Have evil wrought:
Thine adversaries roar and shout,
They hang in scorn their banners out.

Thy Temples building once did boast,

And with their hammers broken down.

Defile the dwelling of Thy Name:
And in their wicked hearts design,
Her glories quite to undermine.

The Sanctuaries hallowed place.
Gods Houses thus in ashes laid,
Are woeful heaps of rubbish made.

No Prophet have, who can foretell:
Not one has knowledge to forecast,
How long these miseries shall last.

And make Thy Name dishonours theme?

But stretch it forth to strike their pride.

From whom earths help and safety spring.

And with Thy strength the Sea divided.
Thou brak'st the Eegyptian Dragons head,
And left'st him on the waters dead;
Leviathan that sports the flood,
Thou gave for Thy peoples food.

And swelling Seas dry land to grow:

Thine are the courses of the night:

Are set and bounded by Thy line;
The Summers heat, and winters cold,
From Thee their yearly seasons hold.

Thy Name by blasphemies reviled:

A spoil to adversaries strife:
Let not Thy Congregation mourn,
Reproached by Them, of Thee forlorn:

Earth dark'ned by their cruelty.

But let the needy praise Thy Name.

Thy Temples honor, and Thy Laws.
Remember their blaspheming noise,
Thine enemies insulting voice.
Their insolence, who Thee despise,
Does still increase and higher rise.
PSALM. LXXV.

To Thee we thanks impart.
How near, and helpful is Thy Name,
Thy wondrous works proclaim.
Judah's throne,
Shall rule the Nation;
In justice will I take delight,
And judge the peoples right.

Through fear dissolves and faints.
Yet of her loose, declining frame
The Pillars I sustain.

Deal not so madly then:
And unto those, Gods precepts scorn,
Exalt not you the horn.

Nor speak with a stiff neck.

Nor South, nor from the West.
But God as Judge our fortune guides,
Our lot of life divides:
He one man lifts unto the Crown,
And puts another down.

Full mixed, and tempered:
For wicked ones the dreg, and lee,
Wrung out to drink shall be.

The God of Jacobs care;

But lift the Just on high.
PSALM. LXXVI.
Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandments.
Judah God is known; His Name
The Israelites for Great proclaim.
Salem grace,
And Sion is His dwelling place.

And Battles to confusion shook.
The glittering sword, the guarding shield,
Could not resist, nor safety yield.

Who rove upon the Hills of prey:

Are now themselves become a spoil.
A lasting sleep shuts up their eyes,
And all their strength in weakness dies:

And armed Chariots loose their force.

The fury of Thy powerful hand?

The trembling earth was still, and feared.

But gives the proud untimely graves,

And turns their malice to His praise.

To Him your promised offering:

And Kings of earth with terror chain.
PSALM. LXXVII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

To God that hears my prayer still.

I unto Him for succor sought.
All night my anguish did not cease;
My soul no comfort found, nor ease.

My vexed spirit to Him complains.

My tongue perplexed nothing spoke.

The ancient times expired date.

My wonted mirth, omitted long:
All night I commune with my heart,
My spirits search to ease my smart.

Nor by His favor us protect?
Is His compassion lost and gone;
His promises not thought upon?
Has God His pity now forgot?
Or must destruction be our lot?
Or will His wrath, by sin renewed,
His tender mercies quite exclude?

This is mine own infirmity.
But I remember will the years
Thy right hand kept from want, or fears.

Shall with my thankful tongue be told.

My words Thy noble acts relate.

Who with Thy greatness may compare?

Thy strength among the People shines.

Not all the Nations could withstand,
The Sons of Jacob did redeem;
And Joseph's offspring wilt esteem.

Unto their depths retired with fright:
The billows of the troubled maine
Shrunk down, and hid themselves again

Like to a falling tempest powers:
Whilst sounds of horror tear the sky,
And through the air thine arrows fly.

Thy lightnings shone, earths fabric shook:

Which where Thou go no footsteps has.

Saved from the Sea, in deserts fed:
And brought them to their promised land,
By Moses and by Aarons hand.
PSALM. LXXVIII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Your ear unto my Laws divine.



His works in praises magnified:
Israel,
Which Parents must to Children tell.

Might know their duty to perform?
That they their hope in God may set;
And not His works, or Law forget:

With hearts unstedfast in His love:
Ephraim bred,
Who armed from the battle fled.


Egypts land, and Zoans field
Such marvailes to their sight did yield.

The floods contracting to an heap:

At night He led them with a Flame.

Which drink like swelling rivers gave:

And waters made like torrents flow.

And in the desert did provoke.

Which they for lust, not hunger, eat.

Can He in deserts diet make?

But can He bread, or flesh provide?
When God heard this, His just moved ire
Against Jacob kindled like a fire:

And His salvation not believed.

The doors of heaven opened wide:
Manna for their meat,
And gave them corn from heaven to eat.

For to the full He gave them bread.

And made the South His plenty throw.

The fowls like heaps of Sand remained.




Israel sinned still,
His wonders slight, neglect His will.
Second Part.

And all their years in trouble end.

And God to their remembrance brought:
They turned, and from their sin retired,
And early after God inquired.
Then God They for their Rock esteemed,
Remembering He had them redeemed.



Restrained His wrath, and Them did save.

Whose lusts above His Laws prevail:
As passing winds, so light and vain,
Which breathing out, nere come again.

Israel.

Which kept them safe from hostile harm.
Egypt wrought,
His wonders over Zoan brought:

They could not drink the crimsin flood.

And frogs, their plenty to destroy:

And Locusts reaped the ploughman's sweat:

Their Sycamores destroyed with frost:

Their flocks the furious thunder smote.

Bad Angels were among them sent:

Disease and plagues deprived their breath.

The chief which Ham, or Nilus knew.

And did His flock in deserts keep.
Third Part.

When their pursuers drowned were.

The Mount His hand had purchased.

Their land by line to Jacob gave;
And made their tribes in tents to dwell:


As bows deceitful, turned aside.

His jealousy their Idols move.

And Israel did greatly loath:

And no delight in Shiloh took.

His Glory to the Heathens hands:
He left His people to the sword;
His kindled wrath His Lot devoured,

Their maids in marriage none require:

Nor did their widows them lament.

From wine as Giants spirit take:

And put them to perpetual shame.
Ioseph's Tent did then refuse,
Nor would the Tribe of Ephraim choose.
Iudahs Tribe He did elect,
Mount Sion, which His thoughts affect.

Like earth, which stands for ever fast.
David look,
And from amongst the Sheepfolds took:

His chosen People, Jacob's seed:

And by his skillful conduct led.
PSALM. LXXIX.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Thine heritage a prey is made.
Thy Holy Temple they defile,
And Salem make their ruins pile.

To gorge the fowls through heaven that fly,
The carcasses of Saints are feasts,
To glut and feed devouring beasts:

And none would see them buried.

Reproached and laughed at round about:

Consume us like unquenched fire?

Who neither fear thy Name, or power.

Whose furious rage laid Jacob wast,

Nor how rebellious we have bin:
Let speedy mercies us prevent,
Who languish through thy punishment:

Forgive our sins, remove our shame.

Where is the God whom we obey?
O let the value of our blood,
In thy revenge be understood!

Up to thy throne of mercy rise!
Deliver those are marked to die,
By their blood-thirsting cruelty.

Who nor thy Church, nor thee regard:
And may those tongues which thee blaspheme
Become themselves reproaches theme.

Which thine own Fold and Pastures keep,
Will thank thy goodness all our days,
And to succession sing thy praise.
PSALM. LXXX.
Israel keep,
And leadest Joseph like a sheep;
Give ear, and shine with glorious light,
O thou that dwell'st 'twixt Cherubs bright.

Stir up thy self and bring us aid:
Manasses, Ephraim behold,
And Benjamin to bondage sold.

And show to us thy comforts light;
Thy favor to thy servants deigne,
And then we shall be whole again.

With those who daily worship thee?
How long thy closed ear exclude
Their Prayers, who to Thee have su'd?

And tears for drink are measured;

Our neighbors spoil, our haters scorn.

And show to us thy comforts light;
Thy favor to Thy servants deigne,
And then we shall be whole again.

Thy hand which planted, made it spring;

The Heathen were discomfited:
I'ts root Thou caused'st fast to stand,
And with fair branches fill the land;

Her boughs like goodly Cedars made.

Unto the Swelling Oceans beach,

Exposing her to violence?
That all who pass along her place,
Pluck off her grapes, her stock deface;

Root up her planes, devour her store.

Visit Thy now despised Vine:
And what thy right hand once did plant,
O never may thy blessing want.

Which for thy self thou made so strong.

Thy beams of love shall make her rise.

Whom for thy self Thou did elect:

Whose name shall still invoked be.

And show to us Thy comforts light;
Thy favor to thy servants deigne;
And then we shall be whole again.
PSALM. LXXXI.

And make a joyful noise.

With Psaltery conspire.

In solemn triumph go:

For Jacob to retain.
Joseph did command
In the Egyptian land;
Where I a language heard unknow'n,
And understood by none.

From making bricks released.

Who ransomed thee from thrall.
In thunder from the breaking cloud
I answered thee alowd;
And at the waters where you strove
In Meribah did prove.
Hear O my people! I will tell
To Thee O Israel:

Nor worship them before.

And Thee from Egypt brought.
Thy mouth enlarged, and opened wide,
By me shall be supplied.

And Jacob Me reject:

And counsels of their own.

And from my ways not errd.

And with my hand pursued.

But they should still endure.

And honey, for their meat.
PSALM. LXXXII.
Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandments.

To Kings and Judges judgment sits.

And persons of the bad respect?

Justice to men oppressed extend:

And save them from the wicked's hand.

But in the mists of darkness go.
Earths bases all are out of course,
Whilst justice fails, and Law wants force.

And sons derived from highest birth.

And with the fallen Princes ly.

In judgment on the earth arise.
For all the nations scattered far,
Thy lot, and Tributaries are.
PSALM. LXXXIII.

Nor let Thy vengeance sleep;

In tumults gathered.

They plot, and ly in wait;
How they Thy People may annoy,
And Thine elect destroy.

Their Nation quite root out;
And let the name of Israel be
Lost to all memory.

Against Thee confederate,
Edom with Ishmael combine,
Moah with Hagars line.
Gebal, and Ammon against us fight,
With the Amalekite:
The Philistines armed bands conspire,
With those that dwell at Tire:
Ashur runs in to their aid,
Prepared to invade;
They strengthen Lots incestuous race,
Our dwellings to deface.
Midian them confound,
Whose sword themselves did wound:
Like Sisera O make them all,
Who did at Kishon fall.
Iabin swollen with pride,
Whose dreadful Armies died:
Their carcasses in Endor flung,
Were spread on earth as dung.
Oreb's, Zeb's, Zalmunna's fate,
Reward their Princes hate,

Gods Houses to possess.

As straw in winds to reele;

And Hills to ashes turn;

With storms their fear renew.

That they may seek Thy Name.

And perish by Thy hand;
Iehovahs Name
Rules all this earthly frame.
PSALM. LXXXIV.

Thy Tabernacles are!

Whilst from thy Courts restrained.
My heart, my flesh, with all that give
Me power to move, or live,
Cry loud, till they admitted be
The living God to see.

The Swallow builds her nest:
Their young they to thine Altar bring,
O Lord, my God and King.

Thee in thy Temple praise.

Whose ways direct his heart.

Where springs and comforts fail,
Make wells in Baca's barren plain,
And pooles to fill with rain.
They go from strength to strength, nor faint
Through weariness or want;
Till to thy House approaching near
In Sion they appear.

O Jacob's God give ear!

On Thine Annointed's face.

Thousands of ours transcends.
I Would rather keep a door with thee,
Then all earth's glory see.

Crowns those that walk upright.
Nor fails all good such men to give,
Who in His Statutes live.

Who dwell'st in endless light:
How blessed shall that servant be,
Who puts his trust in Thee?
PSALM. LXXXV.

Which has Thy favor seen:
Thou Jacob's Offspring have set free
From thtir captivity.

To cover all offense.

And from thy fiercenes turned.

O cause Thine anger cease.

With all posterity?

Thy peoples joys enlive?

And Thy salvation grant.

For He His peace will send,
And cures His Saints of all their pain,
If they not sin again.

To such as do Him fear:
That glory in our land may dwell,
And all things prosper well.

Justice and Peace do kiss.

And Right from Heaven does look.

Our land yield store of food.

His ways and steps to show.
PSALM. LXXXVI.

Poor, and in misery:

On thee depended has.

Before thy throne I pray:

Lifts up (O Lord) to thee.

And ready to forgive:
Thou plenteous mercy keep'st in store,
For all who Thee implore.

My supplications hear:

Thou sendest me releife.

No works are like to thine.

Shall glorify Thy Name.


My heart unto thy fear unite,
Who in thy name delight.

To honor Thee with praise;

From the devouring grave.

In furious companies:
Ungodly men my life have sought,
Who set thy power at naught.

Whose mercies not abate,
Long suffering art, and patient,
To pardon sinners bent.

Let me thy pity gain.
Give strength, and from destruction
O save Thine handmaids son.
Some token of thy favor deigne,
Which may my haters shame.
Because Thou Lord have brought me aid,
And art my comfort made.
PSALM. LXXXVII.

Where God Himself does rest,
By His protection firmly stayed
Are Her foundations laid.
Sion did elect,
Her gates does more affect,
Then all the numerous tents beside
Where Jacob's sons abide.
Jerusalem! thou City fair,
God's dwelling, and His care!
Of thee, thou throne of Iudahs Kings,
Are spoken glorious things.
Rahab mention,
With high-towr'd Babylon:
The scorched Ethiopian lands,
The plains where Tyrus stands;
Philistia too shall reck'ned be,
With those acknowledge me:

Gives Sions children birth.
God shall establish Her on high,
Her numbers multiply:
When Nations far dispersed shall
Be gathered at His call.

With all Her Sons computes,
They shall amongst His people known
Be counted for his own.

Who there His praise declare;
From whence arise fresh springs of Grace,
To water every place.
PSALM. LXXXVIII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Both day and night I cried have.




Like those who in the grave forgot,
By thee cut off, corrupt and rot.

And darkest deeps my covering made:

And every wave afflicted has:

And severed me from those I loved:
Their friendship turned is to hate;
My life shut up, and desolate.

My hands stretched out, my hopes forlorn.

To praise Thee raised, and wakened?
Shall the devouring grave declare,
How true thy promised mercies are?

The land where all forgotten be?

My prayer shall the morn prevent:

And hid'st from me Thy blessed aspect?

I almost ready am to die;
From youth to age, in life's each act,
Thy suffered terrors me distract?

Thine indignation strikes me so:

Or swelling waters, me surround.

By Thee, from my relief put far.
And those who my acquaintance were,
Concealed, or lost, my sight forbear.
PSALM. LXXXIX.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Thy truth to all succession.
For They built up for ever last:
And are in Heaven established fast:
David swear,
And did by Covenant declare;

And build to Thee a lasting Throne.

And Saints proclaim thy faithfulness.
For who in earth, or heaven are,


And by His servants still adored.

Whose word, like thine, endures so long?

Whose swelling wave becalmed lies:
Rahab brak'st, like one that is dead;
Thine arm thy foes has scattered.

And all the fullness grows from these.

Tabor and Hermon praise thy Name.

Thy right hand full of Majesty.

Mercy and Truth before Thy face.
Blessed are they, who at Thy Feasts,
And in Thy presence, are the guests.

In righteousness exalted be.

Whose favor shall lift up our horn.

Thy Holy one remains our King.

I on my chosen help have laid.
David found,
With Oil anointed Him, and crowned.

I will protect his life from harm.

Nor hurt him shall, by wicked pact:

And shall by plagues consumed die.

Shall in his glory be secured.
Second Part.

Shall to the inland rivers reign.

My God, and Rock, and Father, call:

Above earth's Kings advance his lot:
To Him my mercy nere shall wast;
My Covenant stand ever fast.

Like Heavens unwearied motion.



My hand with stripes their sin correct.


David have I sworn, that I
My promise would not falsify:

About the world his course does run;

The faithful pledge of my decree.

Cast off, and quite abhorred has.

Profaned his crown, his Rule repealed:



That he in battle cannot stand;

And to the earth cast down his throne.

Obscured, and covered is with shame.

Or shall, like fire, thine anger burn?

How vain man's life, how soon decaies.

And in the pit of silence ly?

Thy oath to David plighted has?

How mighty people us defame:

And thine Annointed's steps traduced.

Say evermore, The Lord be blessed.
PSALM. XC.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

All ages have thy mercies seen.

Or earth's unmoved foundation laid:
From everlasting Thou art God,
And wilt out live times period:

Then say, Return to life again.

But to a day with us amount:
Nor are extended in thy sight,
Beyond the watch of one short night:

We vanish as forgotten dreams:

Then wither in the evening.

And unto nothing come at last.

Are always open to thy sight;
Making the breach of thy pure Laws,
Our death, and swift destructions cause.

Expiring like a tale that is told.

Exceeds not Threescore years and ten.
And if to Fourscore they attain,
Their life is but a lengthened pain.
Incessant sorrows, and disease,
Their faculties, and vigor seize.
For soon cut off our days decay,
And suddenly we fly away.

Or of Thy fear true feeling has?
Neither Thy judgments, nor Thy love,
Can us unto repentance move.

We may the end of wisdom reach:
And learn those errors to forget,
Which us in Thy displeasure set.

At our endured punishment.
How long will Thou thy help delay,
Or not remove our woes away?

To recompense Life's past annoyes.

We were enforced to spend in tears.

Thy servants from the dust to rear.
That all succeeding times may know,
What praises to thy Name we owe.

On those, who in death's shade have ly'n.
Grant that for which we prayers make;
And prosper all we undertake.
PSALM. XCI.

Abide secure, and well:
For shadowed by the Almighties care
Both soul and body are.

Thou art my hope and stay.
Thou art my refuge, my strong hold,
Who do my faith embold.

Which cunning hunters set:
Protecting thee by His defense,
In times of Pestilence.

With safety covered:
And least temptation make thee yield,
His truth shall be thy shield.

Shall not thy peace affright:
Nor arrows, which by day do kill,
Thy life with slaughter spill.

Thy dwelling shall infest.
No perils, which at noon destroy,
Thy safety shall annoy.

Thick falling by thy side;
Thou shall unhurt, and guarded stand
From sickness on each hand.

Unto destruction sold:

Who God their refuge make.

Nor plague thy dwelling wast.

Thy Centinells to stand.

Whither thou wake, or sleep.
And least a stone thy foot should hurt,
Their hands shall thee support.
Basilisk, nor Adders sting
Thy life in danger bring.
Thou shall upon the Lion tread,
And bruise the Dragons head.

I will his guardian be:
Since he acknowledged has My name,
I will exalt his fame.

In trouble, and in fear.
I will to honor him advance;
And send deliverance.

I will his comforts raise.
And when his time on earth is done,
Give him salvation.
PSALM. XCII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Praise to Thy Name (most High) to sing:

To show, Thy faithfulness each night.

With Psalteries well-tuned concent,
And on the solemn sounding Lyre,
Where all harmonious notes conspire.

Through all Thy hands atchieuements, glad;
Who, in Thy works, which earth do fill,
Rejoice, and always triumph will.
O Lord! how great Thy actions are?
Deep are Thy thoughts, and hidden far.
The brutish do not this attend,
Nor will the fools it apprehend.

The wicked men are flourishing,
Even then their quick destruction hasts.


Thine enemies before Thee fall.

Like to the stately Unicorne.
With freshest oil, and balm new shed,
Thou will anoint my conquering head:

On those, who against my life conspire:
And for those wicked enemies,
Who to my safeties hazard rise,
Mine ears shall hear them come to naught,
By Thy revenge to ruin brought.

Or Cedars on the mountains brow.

Within His courts we prosper see.

Continue fat, and flourishing:

With whom no wicked harbor must.
PSALM. XCIII.

Clothed with Majesty.
He vested is with glorious light,
And girds Himself with might.
The world created by His hand,
Established does stand
So fast and firm upon its base,
It moves not from the place.

Thy Throne (O Lord) shall hold.
Which, when earth's fabric melts and wastes,
Like Thee, for ever lasts.

In uproare, and in noise,
The swelling waves up-lifted rise,
To band against the skies.

Then those proud waters are:
And stronger then the Oceans wave,
Which winds enchafed have.

Eternally endure.
And holiness becomes (O God!)
The house of Thine abode.
PSALM. XCIV.

Now let Thy vengeance wake.

The proud to recompense.

How long triumph and boast?

Joy in Thy servants wrong?

Afflict Thine heritage.

And kill the fatherless.

The Lord not sees us, say;
Great Jacobs God does not regard,
Nor will the sin reward.

Who thus your crimes disguise.
Ye foolish people of the land,
When will ye understand?

Unable is to hear?
Or shall not he, who formed the eye,
Your wickedness descry?

Not know to punish you?

The vainnes of man's thought.

Who chast'ned is by Thee;
Whom Thou in mercy do correct,
And in Thy Law direct.

He may in patience rest,
Till for transgressors ruin he
A pit prepared see.

Nor his own choice neglects:

And comfort the upright.

Who work iniquities?

My soul had silenced been.
When I, my slipping foot, complained,
Thy mercy me sustained,

Thy comforts her delight.

Or join it with Thine own?
Who, under Laws, and Reason's name,
Their acts of mischief frame.

The just to circumvent.
Who sit in Counsel, souls to kill,
And guiltles blood to spill.

God is my confidence;
My Rock, my refuge, and my tower,
To save me by His power.

Which from themselves did spring.
And in their sins God's vengfull hand
Shall cut them from the land.
PSALM. XCV.

Our cheerful Songs record:
Unto our Rock lift up our voice,
And make a joyful noise.

Approach His presence nigh:
With Psalms and Anthems glad express
Our bounden thankfulness.

The spacious earth has spann'd:



Kneel down the Lord before:

His sheep, and people are.
To day if ye His voice will hear,

Like that provoking in the day
You in the desert lay.

Who did my wonders see:
And forty years you Tribes did pass,
Wherein I grieved was.
I said, my people err in heart,
And wilfully depart;
My ways prescribed they have not known,
Nor in my precepts gone.

By oath protested has,
Those murmurers should nere be blessed,
Or enter to my rest.
PSALM. XCVI.
Sing this as Psalm 51. or 100.

Sing to him all the Universe.

His saving mercies every day.
His glory, and his wonders tell


Whose fear above all Gods is raised.

But it is the Lord does heaven sustain.
Honor, and awe are him before,
His sanctuary strong in power.

Unto the Lord due honor give:

And let his Courts with offerings flame.

In beauty, and in holiness.
Let all the earth before him fear,
And say, God does the Scepter bear.

It shall not from its fast'nings go.
He to the people righteously
His final judgment shall apply.

The roaring Ocean make a noise:

With all the trees the forest yields:

He comes to give the earth it is doom;
His just revenge the world pursu'th,
To judge the people with his truth.
PSALM. XCVII.

And Isles within the maine.

And Justice is His Throne.

To burn His circling foes.

Which trembling earth amaze.

Like melting wax consume;

And men confess His fame.

To worship Idols bound:
Who boast in Stocks, and from Him swerve,
Whom all the Gods must serve.
Sion and Judah both rejoiced,
To hear Thy judgments voyc'd;

Or men, or Gods, compare.

See that ye hate all ill:
He does from wicked hands protect
The souls of His Elect.

And joy to the upright.

And praise His Holiness.
PSALM. XCVIII.

Who marvailes wrought for you.
His holy arm, and His right hand
The victory has gained.

His truth to Heathens shown.

Earth His Salvation seen.

Earth, in loud Songs rejoice:

And Psalms tuned to the string.

Let your full joys rebound.
All in your shrillest accents sing
Before the Lord your King.

The world with those there dwell:

All Hills in praises join.

To give the earth it is doom.
With justice He the world will try,
And men with Equity.
PSALM. XCIX.

With trembling before Him fall.
His throne 'twixt Cherubs He does make:
Let earth be moved and shake.
Sion great,
Above the world His Seat;

Of His most awful Name.

And equity approves,
Thou do Thy righteous judgments fruit
In Jacob execute.

His footstool fall before.
Moses, and Aaron amongst His Priests,
On whom His service rests.
And Samuel amongst those that came
To supplicate His Name.
These called on Him, and when they prayed,
He gracious answer made.

Did speak to them aloud:
Whose Testimonies they obay'd,
Nor from His statutes strayed.

With mercy us'dst Thy rod:
Their sins Thy wrath did not forbear;
Yet they forgiven were.

Exalt His praise on high:
And worship at His sacred Hill;
For God is holy still.
PSALM. C.

All lands to Him lift up your voice:

Approach His presence with a Song.

And not our own, created be:
We are His people, and the sheep
His folds enclose, His pastures keep.

And let His Courts resound with praise:
Your gratitude to Him profess;
His glorious Name for ever bless.

His mercies everlasting are;
His truth eternally shall last,
When Time, and all successions wast.
PSALM. CI.

To Thee my Lord and King.

In ways of Thine elect.
O when will Thou to me come near?
Thy presence when appear?
Who in my house with perfect heart
Will nere from Thee depart.

Will I behold, or prize.
I hate the work of them, whose pride
From Thee does turn aside.

Shall from my thoughts depart:
Nor with the sinful, or perverse
My knowledge shall converse.

His neighbor does back-bite.
With him, whose heart, or look is high,
I never will comply.

Mine eyes shall fixed stand.
Who walks in the perfect way,
Shall in my service stay.

To him that works deceit:
Nor shall he tarry in my sight,
Who does in lies delight.

I early will destroy;
And from the City of the Lord
Cut all whom He abhorred.
PSALM. CII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

To Thy bright throne ascend on high.

But answer my request with speed.

Like to the smoke, or rising fume.
My bones like fired brands became,
Burnt up and scorched in sorrows flame.

And I forget to eat my bread:
I wast and pine in daily groans,
That scarce my flesh cleaves to my bones:

Or Owls in deserts shunning light:

So do I watch, and sit alone.

Of enemies against me sworn;

And drink the tears my sorrows shed.

Since thou who raised, have cast me down.

Or dying flower, I hourly fade.

From times successive change secure.

And Sion help, which ruined lies;
The time is come for her repair,

Thy servants pity her neglect,
And on her dust with sighs reflect.

And Kings Thy Majesty proclaim.
Sions buildings rear,
And in His glory shall appear;
He will regard the poor man's suit,
And not despise the destitute:

That after Times may praise the Lord.
Second Part.

And, out of Heaven, earth survay'd;

And Prisoners save condemned to die.
Sions blessed hill,
And Salem which His wonders sill,

When all the people gathered are.

My Short'ned days are come to naught:

O take me not as yet away:
Nor cast me off from this life's stage,
In prime of youth, and midst of age.
For though My days be few, and frail,
Thy years, O God, will never fail.

And by Thy hand the Heavens were made:
They all shall perish, and decay,
And in their time consume away.
Like to a garment, when grow'n old,
They shall nor use, nor motion hold.
But though the world, and they must fall,
Thy Being is perpetual.

Is from it is gloss and form estranged:
So Shall Thou change this massy frame;
Yet still Thy self abide the same.

Thou will prolong Thy servants seed;
Whose children shall remain with Thee,
And in Thy sight established be.
PSALM. CIII.
As Psalm 51.

To bless the Lord, and sing His praise.

The benefits He powered on thee:

And keep thy body from disease:

And does thy life with mercies crown.

And eagle-like renew thy youth.
He by right judgment has redrest
All such as are by wrong oppressed.
Moses been;
The Israelites His works have seen.

To mercy swift, to vengeance slow.

Nor let His anger long abide:

Nor have our crimes rewarded bin.

So large, so boundless is his love;

As East and West divided are.

To us is his compassion.

Remembering that we are but dust.

Or fading flower, to nothing pass.

Leave neither place, nor print behind.

To childrens children does endure.

Walk after His Commandments.
The Lord in heaven prepares His throne,
And governs all the world alone.
O therefore bless that powerful Lord,
Who made, and rules us by His word.

And never against His word rebel:

Prepared are to act His will:
Ye Heavenly hosts, and creatures all,

Lastly my Soul thy Maker praise,
And bless His goodness all thy days.
PSALM. CIV.
As Psalm 51.

O God! Thy greatness all confess;
Whom Majesty and honor vest,

He Heaven makes his Canopy;

His Chariot is the cloudy storm,
And on the wings of wind is borne.

His Ministers a flaming fire.

It might remain for ever fast:

Whose wave out swells the mountains steep.

And hid their thunder frighted head.

And down into the Valleys go:
Then to their liquid center have,
Where their collected floods are cast.

Thou have within a bank confined:
Not suffering them to pass their bound,
Least earth by their excess be drowned.

Down running to the valleys brings:

To thirsting beasts throughout the field.

And singing in their branches nest.

The teeming earth with plenty fills.

And every Herb for humane use:
That so He may His creatures feed,
And from the earth supply their need.

To glad the Sons of men with wine.
He oil to cheer the face imparts,
And bread, the strength'ner of their hearts.
Second Part.

Nor sap, nor moyst'ning virtue need.
The lofty Cedars by His hand
In Lebanon emplanted stand.

And Storks upon the fir-trees build:

And in the Rocks the Conies breed.

To note the seasons of the year.
The Sun from Him his strength does get,
And knows the measure of his Set.

When beasts creep forth that shunned the light.

From God their hunger must allay.

Down in their Dens themselves they lay.

Continues till the day be done.
O Lord! what wonders have thou made,
In providence and wisdom laid?
The earth is with Thy riches crowned,


There great Leviathan does ly,
Who takes his pastime in the flood:


Who are by Thee with goodness filled.

And to their dust returned ly.

The springing face of earth renewes.

Pleased in His works, from change secure.

Which shrinks and trembles at His frown:
His lightnings touch, or thunders stroke,
Will make the proudest mountains smoke.

Or being have, shall praises give:

When fixed on Him my comforts meet.

In place, and memory forgot.
But thou, my soul, thy Maker bless;
Let all the world His praise express,
PSALM. CV.

His deeds to all proclaim.

His wondrous works relate.

And heart for God enquires,

His faces glorious light.

And Judgments think upon,
Abraham,
And chosen Jacob came.

Through all the earth are known:

To thousands that succeed.
Abraham, and Izaak both
He promised with an oath;

To Jacob did enact:
In which He vowed, that Israel
In Canaans Land should dwell;

Nor place, nor people knew.

Through diverse Nations went;

And Kings for them reproved.

That none should them withstand;)
Against mine Anointed lift no arm,
Nor do my Prophets harm.

Which brake their staff of bread.
Joseph had decreed
He would His people feed:

They did in fetters hold;

And gave his trial ease.

To loose, and set him free.

Chief Ruler of the Land.

He might his Princes bind:
And, tutored by His counsels wise,
His Senators advise.
Second Part.
Jacob into Egypt came,
A Sojourner in Ham.

Much stronger then their foes:

And use them with deceit:
Moses for their succor sent,
With chosen Aaron went.

And signs in Hams abode:

In midst of noone affrights:
The foggs, and vapors Him obey,
By putting out the day.

Were smothered in the Flood.
Egypt frogs abundant brings
In chambers of their Kings.

Their coasts are filled with Lice.

And flames of fire, for showers.
With storm their Vines and Fig Trees shook,
Through all their land were broke.

Not to be numbered,

Devoured on the ground.
Egypt slew,
Their chiefest strength orethrew.

Not one decayed in health.
Egypt was glad and quit of fear,
When They departed were.

And in the night a Flame.

From Heaven He gave them bread.

Springs in dry places grow.
Abraham His promise made
He in remembrance had;

Secured by His defense.

Enriched by others toil:

To him all praises give.
PSALM. CVI.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Whose mercy knows no period.

Or show how due His praises are?

And always in the Truth delight.

Let Thy salvation me protect:

The bliss of Thine inheritance.

Who, like our Fathers, still transgress.
Egypt they forgot,
Thy mercies there remembered not:
But at the Sea did Him provoke,


Whose waters walled them on each side.
And through its depths uncovered,
As safe, as through the desert, led:
Saved them from foes that did pursue;




And God by their temptations press;

Into their souls though Ieannes sent.
Moses in the Camp envied,
And Aaron's office vilify'd.

Abiram's Troops, and Dathan's power.

Which burnt up those that did conspire.
Horeb made;
And to the Molten Image prayed.

Was now converted to a beast.
Egypts wonders, the Red Sea,
Ham, forgotten be.

Till Moses intercession made:
Who in the deadly breach did stand,
To turn away His vengfull hand.


That in the Desert He decreed,

Second Part.
Baal Peor joined, they fed
On sacrifices to the dead.

For which the Plague upon them broke,
Phinehas avenged the offense,
And staid the mortal pestilence:

Of righteousness, and holy zeal.

They did again His anger move:
Where it so ill with Moses went,
He suffered in their punishment.

Provoked was, whilst they reviled:
And discontented for their sake,
Some unadvised language spoke.

They not destroyed at Gods command:



Their Sons, and daughters blood they shed:

Did all the Land of Canaan stain.

In impious works themselves invent.

Abhorred His own heritage.

Their haters made Their conquerours:



He pitty'd their calamity.

His Covenant recalled to mind,
And in his mercy did repent
The sharpnes of their punishment.

Who Them before had captives took.

And from the Heathen us collect:
To thank thy Name through all our days,
And triumph in Thy mercies praise.
Isarael
Be blessed, whose benefits excel.
To Him be praises endless paid:
And let Amen by all be said.
PSALM. CVII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Whose mercy knows no period.
Israel confess, His hands

From North, and South, and East, and West,

But in the wilderness dispersed,


Who them delivered from distress.

To find a City for their stay.

Who such great goodness does afford:
Recording both by tongue and pen
His wonders to the sons of men.

The hungry does with goodness fill,

In iron and affliction laid.
Because against God they did rebel,
And from His words, and counsel fell,

Found none to ease them from their yoke.

Who them delivered from distress:

And freedom from their bondage wrought.

Who such great goodness does afford;
Recording both by tongue and pen
His wonders to the Sons of men.

The iron bars in sunder struck.

Have by His hand afflicted bin.

Abhorring meat, could nothing taste.

Who them delivered from distress.

Their sorrows, and dejections healed.

Who such great mercies does afford;
Recording both by tongue and pen
His wonders to the Sons of men.
And let their Songs of gladness rise.
To pay their thankful sacrifice.
Second Part.




Then down they fall, as if their graves
Were made beneath the gaping waves.

And like a drunkard rowles the keele.

Who them delivers from distress:



Who such great goodness does afford;
Recording both by tongue and pen
His wonders to the Sons of men.

And amongst the Elders speak his fame:

Makes parched sands, where springs did rise.

For sins which in the Land abound.

And turn dry grounds to water springs.

That they may live, and Cities build:

Which may her fruits with plenty yield.

Their flocks not suffering to decrease.

His punishments then brought them low.

Makes them like wanderers forlorn.

And spreads like flocks his family.

When envies mouth shall stopped be.

The loving kindness of the Lord.
PSALM. CVIII.

Prepared my intent.
I will Thy might in songs of praise,
And glorious ditties raise.

The morning I will take;
That through the world my early verse
Thy praises may disperse.

Thy truth the clouds transcends.

'Bove earth in glory rise.

From all invasion free;
Thy right hand in their safety rear,
And their petitions hear.

He would his servants bless.
I will divide fair Shechems soil,
And Succoths valley spoil.
Manasseh, Gilead, both are mine,
In war shall Ephraim shine:
But Judah's Scepter all must aw,
And give my people Law.
Moab shall be a dunghill grow'n,
Proud Edom overthrow'n.
Philistia's boasted triumphs shall
Be buried in her fall.

Fierce Edoms strength and head?
That I may break her fensed gate,
And trample on her state?

And made our force their scoff!
Wilt not Thou with our armies go,
To quell the insulting foe?

For help of man is vain.
Through God we shall in battle rise,
And foil our enemies.
PSALM. CIX.
Sing this as the Lamentation.

Nor unattentive unto me.

And wound me with their lying tongue.

And causeless vex me with debate.

But I my grief in prayer disclose.

And my affection pay with spite.

And Satan stand at his right hand,
Let him, when judged, receive his doom,
And let his prayer, his sin become.

His office let another take.

His wife forlorn, a widow grieve:

And, where they beg it, not be fed.

And strangers reap his harvests toil.

Nor on his feed compassion take.

In the succeeding age forgot.

His Fathers sin, and Mothers stain.

To cut from earth his memory:

And wounds of broken hearts renewed.

All blessings be from him removed.

So seize they him, within, without;
Like water through his bowels flowed,
Or oil into his bones bestowed:
So let them cloth, and gird him fast,
Returning on himself at last.

Who to reproach my soul expose.

Deliver me (O Lord) from shame.

My wounded heart does inward bleed.

As puffs of wind the Locusts throw.

And faintnes ore my flesh prevails:

They looking on me shake their head.



But let me live with gladness crowned.

In sharp confusion clothed ly.

Be in the full assembly sung.

By His protection, ready stand;
To save his innocence from them,
Who wrongfully his soul condemn.
PSALM. CX.

Unto my Lord did say:
Sit at my right hand, till thou see,
Thy foes Thy footstool be.

And strength from Sion send;
That all Thine enemies below
May to Thy Kingdom bow.

That day before Thee fall;
Whose glorious Birth, and youthful hue
Is as the morning dew.

His long decreed intents,
Thou do from great Melchisedek
Thy Royal Priesthood take.

And Nations strong confound:

With Bodies of their dead.

Shall drink, his thirst to stay:
And his victorious head advance
In our Deliverance.
PSALM. CXI.
To the usual Tune.

The Quire of Saints among,
His praises shall be sung.

All those will them repeat,
Whose thoughts on Him are set.

Renowned and honored far;
Nor can His truth empaire:

Who has compassion wrought;
And pity shows, when sought.

Given those, that fear Him, bread,
His Covenant stablished:
His power to them expressed,
And made His people rest,
Where Heathen late possessed.

In truth and judgment stands,
And sure are His Commands:

By His decree kept fast,
Till fleeting time is past.

Whom Tyrants did enslave;
His sacred Covenant gave:
Renowned is His fame,
And reverend His Name,
Which all the world proclaim.

The knowledge of good things
From that beginning springs.
They understand aright,
Who make His Laws their light,
And still His praise recite.
PSALM. CXII.

Delighting in His word:

Blessed his posterity.

His life with plenty crowned.
His righteous dealing, clear as sure,
For ever shall endure.

There rises up a light.
He gracious is, and free from hate,
His heart compassionate.

Nor in his words offends:

In lasting memory.

Has God his refuge made:
Thus fixed, his heart shall never fail,


He has dispersed his store,
His righteousness shall still remain,
And lasting honor gain.

For spite shall gnash his teeth:
And, melted by his envies fire,
Perish in his desire.
PSALM. CXIII.
To the usual Tune.

To His great Name your ditties raise,


Till to the West his course be run,
Nis Name is to be praised alone.

Is seated in great Majesty,
And in the Heavens His glories ly.

The Lord our God who thus excells,
And far above the Heaven dwells?
Who humbling down himself does bow,
Not only things in heaven to know,
But what is done in earth below.

He joyful comforts does restore;
And from the dunghill lifts the poor:

And persons of a Royal birth,
His sorrows may be changed to mirth.

His bounty has with children stored:
O therefore praise this gracious Lord.
PSALM. CXIV.
Israel from Egypt went
Free from his banishment,
And Jacob came from that strange land,
Conducted by God's hand:
Judah, which did pass,
His Sanctuary was:
And Israel the chosen throne
Of his dominion.

Jordan his course reverse.
The Mountains skip'd like sporting rams,
The little hills like Lambs.

That they so fled from thee?
Jordan, what did thy current lack,
That thou wast driven back?
What Miracle did then prevail,
That both your streams should fail?

Yet little hills like Lambs?
Jacobs God
Commands thee with his rod:

And made the flint a spring.
PSALM. CXV.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Thy Name, Thy Truth, the glory be.

Whilst, Where is now their God? they cry?

And acts what ere he did ordain.
Their Idols Silver are, and Gold:
The work which hands of men did mould.

And they have eyes, but cannot see:

And noses, not for smelling, bear.

Nor through their throat resounds their talk.

And so are all that to them pray.
O Israel! O Aarons line!

Trust ye in God, who is your shield;
Protection He, and help does yield.

Will Israel, and Aaron bless.



Who heaven framed, and earth has stored:

But earth unto man's children gives.

Nor those who down to silence go:

Will bless. The Lord for ever praise.
PSALM. CXVI.

He has me heard, and eased.

I will upon Him call.

And pains of Hell I felt.
Disturbed thoughts, and heaviness
My conscience did oppress.

And thus unto Him said:
O Lord! my soul from falling save,
And lift me from the grave.

To those His mercy trust:

When crosses them deject.

God's favors have thee blessed.
He bountifully does reward,
And thee from dangers guard.

My drooping eyes from tears,
And did my wandering steps recall,
When I was apt to fall.

In His eternal land.

Yet still my heart was grieved.
For in my foes success I failed,
Till faith at last prevailed:

And God alone for true.

To him by whom I live?
Or what acknowledgment apply,
For His benignity?

And humble prayers make.

The vows which I have made.

And in the Lord delight,
Are living dear unto His eye,
And precious when they die.

And still adore Thy Name.
Thou loosed have my heavy yoke,
My bonds in sunder broke.

Shall daily offered be:
My gratitude and prayer shall rise,
Like thankful sacrifice.

Before the people paid,

To praise Thy Name resorts.
PSALM. CXVII.

The Praises of the Lord;
Ye people through the Universe,
Your Makers praise rehearse.

And Mercies large bestows.
His constant Truth no time decaies:
The Lord for ever praise.
PSALM. CXVIII.

Whose mercy knows no period.
Let Israel their voices join;
Aarons loyne,

His mercies everlastingnesse.

Who me enlarged, and releast.

I fearlesse man's attempts abide.

I shall my haters ruined see.

Than lean on man, who is but dust:

Then put in Princes confidence.

But His great Name shall them confound:

But I destroyed them in His Name.

Yet through His Name I was unharm'd:
As kindled Thorns, which blazing die,
They quenched in their ashes ly.

The Lord Himself became may aid:


For God's Right hand's lift up on high,
His Right hand acts most valiantly.

And speak His wonders all my days.

He unto death not gave me ore.

With praise the Lord may glorify.

And righteous Persons enter must.

And make me in Thy help rejoice.

The Head is of the Corner made.

Religious wonder multiplies:

We will rejoice, in it be glad.

O Lord! who art as good, as great.

We blessings from God's house proclaim.

Pure Offerings to His Altar bind.

And in my Song Thine honor raise.
O thank the goodness of our God,
Whose mercy knows no period.
PSALM. CXIX.
ALEPH.

Nor in their ways beguiled,

And with their whole heart seek.

Or turned them from His path;

We never should withdraw.

I keep Thy statutes might:

Who Thy commands respect.

When taught Thy judgments right:

O never me forsake.

And to Thy ways relate.

Kept in my mind, and sight.
GIMEL.

I may observance give:

Thy Law's high mysteries.

Thy precepts do not hide.

Thy judgments has desired.

Who Thy Commands forsook.

For I Thy precepts love.

But I Thy statutes seek.

And from It counsel take.
DALETH.

Yet me in death not leave.

Thy statutes not conceal.

That I Thy works may tell.

O quicken me at last.

Thy judgments I propose.

On these I meditate.
ZAIN.

Wherein my hope is laid:

In trouble gives releif.

I never have denied:

And present comfort find.

When sinners Thee despise.

In life's short pilgrimage.

Who have Thy precepts sought.

Because I kept Thy Law.
CHETH.

That I would keep Thy word.

Let me Thy mercy have.

Within Thy Rules to meet.

With duty, not delayed.

I nere from Thee recoyl'd.
At midnight I my self will raise,
To sing Thy Judgments praise.

Who Thee obey, and fear.

Me in Thy statutes teach.
TETH.

According to Thy word.

For I Thy Laws believe.

But now Thy word obeyed:

Let me Thy statutes know.

Who keep Thy Covenant:

But me Thy statutes please.

To know Thee I am brought;

Then thousand heaps of Gold.
IOD.

Teach me to understand:

My settled hope in Thee.
I know Thy judgments (Lord) are true;
And my affliction due.

Thy servants grief allay.

That I with Thee may live.

Hates me, who love Thy Laws.

Thy truth who know, and fear;

That me no shame confound.
CAPH.

Trusts on Thy gracious grant.

When shall my hopes prevail?

Yet Thee I not forsook.

Ere Thou Thy judgment send?

Have dug pits in spite:

Against them who me oppress.

But I on Thee presumed.
O quicken me, as Thou art kind,
So I Thy word shall mind.
LAMED.

In heaven settled fast:

Does fixed as earth abide:

That all things should remain.

I perished had through grief.

For they my soul revive.

And to Thy Law incline.

I make Thy word my joy:

When earth's perfection ends.
MEM.

All day to meditate?

Above mine enemies.

More then my teachers gave.

'Cause I Thy precepts hold.

Are by Thy word restrained:

For Thou have taught my heart.

Thy word more sweetness yields.

And ways of falsehood hate.
NVN.

And to my path a light.

Thy statutes to perform.

Lord! quicken me again.

And me Thy judgments teach.

Can never Thee forget:

From Thee I never strayed.

The comfort of my heart;

Until my life shall end.
SAMECH.

But I Thy Law affect.
Thou art my refuge and my shield,
Whose word does safety yield.

I will my God obey:

Nor let my hope be shamed.

Resting on Thee, be safe.

Does from Thy Laws depart;

Make them on earth decay.

When I these judgments hear.
AIN.

To my oppressors might:

Who have my ways decry'd.

Until my hopes prevail.

Thy statutes (Lord!) reveal.

Thy sacred will impart:

For void Thy Law is made.
I Thy Commandments precious hold,
Above refined gold:

But hate deceit and lies.
PE.

My souls delight and care:

To make the simple wise.

I to Thy laws aspire:

As those who Thee adore.

Nor vices over me reign.

Thy precepts who esteem.

Teach me Thy Laws divine:

When men Thy Law despise.
TSADDI.

Thy judgments are upright.

Unchanged and faithful stand.

Thy Law not kept in mind:
Thy word is very pure, and tried,
By me most magnified.

Thy precepts not forget:

And Thy Commands are true.

Yet I delight in these:

And I shall ever live.

Yet still I fear Thy Laws:

Then those that treasures find.

Who searchest all my ways.
TAV.

And knowledge to me grant.

And in Thy promise save.

When Thou my heart do teach:

For Thy commands are right.

Whose choice Thy precepts be.

My chiefest joys among.

Whose judgments me shall raise:
I like a lost sheep went astray;
O Lord my wand'rings stay.
PSALM. CXX.

I called for relief:
When God unto my help appeared,
And my Petition heard.

Who would my life surprise.
Make not my soul their envies bait,
To perish by deceit.

O false and perjured tongue?

Shall one day be thy hire.

So far from Jsrael;
That I in Mesech sojourne must,
And Tents of Kedar trust.

With dispositions fierce:
Who shunned have, like some disease,
The happy fruits of peace.

I labored all my life:
But They, when Treaties were my care,
For lasting war prepare.
PSALM. CXXI.
Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandments.

From whence my help and comfort rise.

Who made the world, and every thing.

Nor Slumbers He, nor thee neglects.
Israel keeps,
Unwearied is, and never sleeps.

Which on thy right hand is displayed.

Nor vapors of the Moon by night.

Thy soul against temptations arm.

For evermore His care have bin.
PSALM. CXXII.

When They unto me said;
Let us unto God's House repair,
And worship Him with prayer.
Jerusalem! our feet
Within Thy Gates shall meet;

United in each part.

Their praises to commend;
And by their zeal the rest inflame,
To bless their Makers Name.

By public justice graced.
There is the Palace and the Throne,
Which David sits upon.
Salems lasting peace,
That it may nere decrease:
They still shall prosper, from whose love
These happy wishes move.

Sweet concord dwell in Thee:
And let thy Palaces abound,
With fullest plenty crowned.

Peace may within thee stay.

Will ever seek Thy good.
PSALM. CXXIII.

O thou who rul'st the skies,
And in the highest Heavens do dwell,
Whose brightness none can tell.

And Maids their mistress hand:
On God so do our eyes depend
Till He his mercy send.

To end our painful woe.
For we reproached, and unpriz'd,
Are utterly despised.

Filled with excessive scorns.
Whilst those who live in ease, and pride,
Our wretched state deride.
PSALM. CXXIV.
To the proper Tune.
Israel
This truth may gladly tell:
But that the Lord
Did help to us afford;

With strength had not supplied,
When banding foes
Against our safety rose,

Had swallowed us like fire.

Had then above us stood,
Who by the stream
Quite overwhelmed had been;

Become our timeless graves:
Whilst ore our soul
The billows proudly roll.

Who us their prey not made.

Like late-entangled fowls,
Escaped are
Out of the deadly snare:
Broke is the net,
And we at freedom set.

Who Heaven and earth did frame,
Our ruin stayed,
And help on Him is laid.
Another of the same.
Israel may truly say,
In honor of this day;
Had not the Lord our quarrel took,
All help had us forsook.

When men our ruin sought;
And when our close conspiring foes
Against our safety rose;

Had buried us alive;
Consuming both our Place and Name
In their revenges flame.

Had perished in this stream;

Beheld our glories comb.

Who thus from death us raised:
Nor made us subject to their power,
Who sought us to devour.

Like some net scaping foul:
So broken is the bloody snare,
And we delivered are.

In God alone are laid;
It Is He, who made both Heaven and earth,
That gave our comforts birth.
PSALM. CXXV.

Are like fair Sions Mount;
Whose head unmoved, and unshook,
Abides the tempests stroke.
Salem's fense,
By their circumference;
So God His people guards throughout,
And circles them about.

The righteous Lot devour;
Least they the heathens sins partake,
Who them their vassal make.

Who in Thy goodness trust.
And those that are in heart upright,
Continue in Thy sight.

To crooked ways back-slide,
The Lord their judgments shall increase;
But Jacob bless with peace.
PSALM. CXXVI.

On Sions misery;
And did his captived Peoples state
To liberty translate;
This unexpected safety wrought
On us such wonder brought,
Our freedom like a vision seemed,
And we like them that dreamed.

Did exercise our tongues,
That Heathens with amazement said,
God has This gladness made

Great things effected has,
And makes us publish through the earth.
The causes of our mirth.

Let Thy full mercyes flow,
As waters from the fountains mouth,
Or Rivers in the South.

And only sorrows known;
Shall so their future hopes employ,
That they may reap in joy.

And watered with his tears,
Shall doubtless find returned with gain;
What here he sowed in pain.
A blessed harvest shall ensue,
His comforts to renew;
Long joys shall spring from his short grief,
And from each grain a sheaf.
PSALM. CXXVII.
Sing this as the Lords Prayer.

The builders labor is in vain;
Except the City He defend,
And to the dwellers safety send,
In vain are Sentinels prepared,
Or armed watchmen for the guard.

Arise, or sit up late at night,
To find support, and daily eat
Your bread with sorrow earned and sweat:
When God, who His beloved keeps,
This plenty gives with quiet sleeps.

Are blessings which from Heaven come,

So children are in youth obtained;

Shall never fear upbraiding foes.
PSALM. CXXVIII.

And holds His precepts dear:

And of thy labors eat.

Which does thy walls entwine,
With fruits enrich thy dwelling place,
And multiply thy race.
Thy Children shall like branches show,
Which from the Olive grow,
And round about thy table stand,
As blessings to thy land.

Whose hopes in God remain:
Sion bless,
With all earthes happiness.
Thine eyes Jerusalem shall see,
Filled with prosperity,
And whilst thy days of life endure,
Her gloryes shall be sure.

Spring up when thou art old,
And added to thine own increase,
See Israel in peace.
PSALM. CXXIX.
Sing this as Psalm 119.

May Israel now say.

Yet have they not prevailed.

And there long furrows made:
But God has cut their wicked bands,
And saved me from their hands.

Who Sions hurt desire;

Which withers e're grown up:

Nor into sheaves is bound;

Or wish you prosper may.
PSALM. CXXX.

O Lord! to Thee I cry:

My supplication hear.

And with thy searching beam
Examine each transgression,
And error we have done:
When we thus strictly shall be tried,
Who may thy sentence bide?
Or who endure thy vengfull hand,
And in thy judgment stand?

That Thou may feared be:

Therefore in them I trust.

To Thee my Soul does have:
On Thee she waits, to Thee she flies,
Before the morning rise.
They that expect the morning light,
After the weary night,
Watch not so much the break of day,
As she for Thee does stay.
Israel trust in the Lord,
Who pity does afford!
For He more ready is to save,
Then we his help to crave.
With Him abundant mercy is,
To salve what is done amiss:

To cure each sinful wound.
Another of the same, paraphrased for an Antheme.
OUt of the horror of the lowest Deep,
Where cares and endless fears their station keep,
To thee (O Lord) I send my woeful cry:
O hear the accents of my misery.
If Thy enquiry (Lord) should be severe,
To mark all sins which have been acted here,
Who may abide? or, when they sisted are,
Stand un-condemned at Thy Judgments bar?
But there is mercy (O my God) with Thee,
That Thou by it may loved, and feared be.
My Soul waits for the Lord, in Him I trust,
Whose word is faithful, and whose promise just.
On him my longing thoughts are fixed, as they,
Who wait the co^forts of the rising day:
Yea more then those that watch the morning light
Tired with the sorrows of a rest-less night.
O Israel, trust in that Gracious Lord,
Who plentiful remission does afford;
And will His people, who past pardon seem.
By mercyes greater then their sins redeem,
PSALM. CXXXI.

Nor eyes to pride inclined.
To matters great I not aspire,
Nor things too high desire.

Like to a weaned Child,
So weaned from all earth's vanities
My soul on Thee relies.
Israel make God their scope,
And in His goodness hope;
Until both time, and life shall end,
On Him alone depend.
PSALM. CXXXII.
David's trouble Lord,
His vow and oath record;

To Jacob's God did swear.

Nor go into my bed,

Acquainted be with rest:

Unto the Lord designed:
And till I shall a Temple raise
For the Almighty's praise.
Ephrata
Thy Arc did sometimes stay;
And found, in open fields it stood,
Or shelt'red by the wood.

Our knees we will humbly bow:
We will before His foot stool fall,
And on His power call.

Long with Thy presence blessed;
And let Thy Arc be fixed here,
Whose strength the Nations fear.

With joy Thy Saints inspire:
David's sake,
From Thine Anointed take.
David vowed has,
Nor will He break His faith,
From thine own Ioynes shall issue one
To sit upon thy throne.

To my Commandment;
Their sons, whilst day and night remain,
Successively shall Reign.
Sion chose
For my desired repose:

An everlasting guest.

Her poor relieved with bread:

With gladness Her Elect.
David spring,
In honor flourishing:
And like a Lamp, his glorious light
Shall still continue bright.

Shall lose both life and name:
But from his Sacred Head the Crown
Shall never be cast down.
PSALM. CXXXIII.

When brethren do agree:
Whose hearts, as dwellings, love unites,
And to accord invites.

On Aarons sacred head,
Which did from face, and beard descend,
And on his garment end.

Which Hermons top renew:
Or as the fuitfull raines distill
Upon fair Sions Hill.

His loves unwasted showers;
And does their habitations bless
With endless happiness
PSALM. CXXXIV.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

Bless Him with one accord.
You in His House who nightly wait,
His praises due relate.

And daily Him implore:
Within His Sanctuary bless
The Lord of Holiness.

And earth's foundation laid,
Out of His Sion thee defend,
And blessings endless send.
PSALM. CXXXV.
Sing this as Psalm 119.

All ye that love His Name.
Ye in His House, and Courts that stand,
Attending His Command.

From whom all mercies came.
Jacob chose, and on his race
Did all His treasure place.

All other Gods exceeds:

He acts what ere He please.

Which cloud the dark'ned skies:
From whence He raines, and lightning flings,
And winds there treasured brings.
Egypt smote,
Pharaoh brought.

And mighty Kings defeat:
Sibon, and Og, and Canaan fell
Israel.

Succession shall record.

But toward Thine own relent.

Are gold and silver wrought.
Speechless they be, and blind, and deaf,


Who trust in Them repose.
Jacob spring,
O house of Aaron sing!
Levi, who profess
His fear, your Maker bless.
Sion let your blessings sound,
Your thankful Songs abound:
Praise ye the Lord, His mercies tell,
Who does in Salem dwell.
PSALM. CXXXVI.
To the usual Tune, As Psalm 148.

Who does all good afford;



Great wonders done:
His mercy sure
Does still endure.



To rule our days and nights:

The Stars and Moon,

Does still endure.
Egypts firstborn smote;
And Jacob from them brought.

Israel to pass.
Pharaoh's host
In it was lost.
His mercy sure
Does still endure.

Great Kings discomfited,
Sihon the Amorite;
Og, with Bashan's might;

Jacob's hand:
His mercy sure
Does still endure.


Who to all flesh gives food,
His creatures fills with good:

To Heavens King;
Whose mercy sure
Does still endure.
PSALM. CXXXVII.
Sing this as Psalm 119.
Babylons swift streams we sat,
Sad and disconsolate;
The tears as fast ran from our ey,
For Sions memory.

Upon the Willowes hung;

Bid us (in scorn) to sing.
They, who us spoiled with sword and fire,
Did mirth of us require:
Sing us (said They) one of the Songs,
To Sion which belongs.

His Enemies among?
Or tune His Notes in strangers Land,
That cannot understand?
Jerusalem! when I
Forsake thy memory,
May my skill fail, my right hand let
Her cunning quite forget.

When I not not mourn thy wrong;
Or if I not prefer thy mirth
Above all joys on earth.

Proud Edoms fierce disdain;
Who against Jerusalem did cry,
Mocking her misery.
Now she is fallen, nere may our eyes
Again behold her rise!
Down with it, (their rude clamours sound,
Raze it even to the ground.
Babylon! which did us wast,
Thy self our woes must taste:
And in thy final ruin we
Sions revenge shall see.
Happy are They, who to requite
The measure of thy spite,

Shall dash thy little ones.
PSALM. CXXXVIII.

My thankful hymns impart;
Before the Gods of Earth I Will sing
My praise to Heaven's King.

And praises utter still:
Thy word and Name shall loudly sound,
Whose love, and truth abound.

Thy love as soon replied:
My fainting spirit was renewed,
With strength my soul endu'd.

When they Thy words do hear:

The glory of their King.

Yet He cast's down His eye;
The meek and lowly He respects,
But all the proud neglects.

Yet Thou will me revive:
Thy stretched out hand my wrathful foes
To ruin shall expose.

By mercyes which endure.
Cease not of me regard to take;
Nor Thine own works forsake.
PSALM. CXXXIX.
Sing this as Psalm 51.

I open am, and known to Thee:

Are not concealed from Thine eyes:
Thou understand'st my distant thought,
Ere it to form my self had brought.

And have my ways discovered.

And ere 'twas uttered, knew'st it long.

Thy hand each part in order laid.

How I this being did attain;
Which does in wonder so excel,
It Is easier to admire, then tell.

Or Thy all present power deny?

If stoop to Hell, lo, Thou art there.

Far as the Sea does swell, or spring;

Where ere my weary footsteps tread.

Upon me, like a covering, fall;
Those heavy fogs, those mists of night,
Will quickly clear, and turn to light.

Can nothing from thy knowledge shrowed:
For darkness does like Noontide shine,
Light'ned by brighter beams of Thine.

My bodies clothing to become.

Who was enlived by Thy word:
With awful art, and wondrous form
Thou did Thy workmanship adorn.
My soul Their marvels must confess,
And for Thy favors daily bless.

Too secretly for man to mark,
There is no curious joint, or bone,
But was to Thy inspection known.

And wrot'st each member in Thy book:
Thou saw how my imperfect frame
By daily growth to figure came.

Thy purposes and thoughts appear!

They would the numerous sands surmount.
These wonders always presently,
Fixed in my thankful memory:
And whilst of them surveies I take,
My contemplation still must wake.

Ye bloody men depart away:

And take Thy sacred Name in vain.

Whose proud despite against thee rose?

Accounting them mine enemies.

Who Judge of all my actions art:
Do Thou my faith to trial bring,
My hidden thoughts examining:

If I persist in ways untrue:
And when Thou find'st my feet to stray,
Reduce me to Thy lasting way.
PSALM. CXL.

And from the violent:

In war, and tumult rise.

Their lips in poison set.

That would my feet orethrow.

To take my life ensnared.

O hear, and send me aid.

Of my salvation;
In day of battle Thou my head
Have safely covered.

Least then their pride aspire.

Who would my life enclose.

Nor let them rise again:

On earth be stablish'd long.

Who have afflicted lay'n;
Their cause regards, and does delight
To help the poor to right.

Their thanks acknowledge must.
And those who live upright, and well,
Shall in Thy presence dwell.
PSALM. CXLI.

To hear my voice at last.

Or evening sacrifice.

And keep my speeches door;
Incline not unto ill my heart,
With sinners to take part.
Let me not eat of that delights
Their wicked appetites:

And smite me in his love.
Like precious balmes, or odours shed,
Such strokes not break my head;
And in my prayers I shall them bless,
In midst of their distress.

Ly dashed against the stone;
They shall with much contentment hear
My words, which comfort bear.

Our bones no value have:
As fallen trees, cut down, and cleft,
Are in their splinters left.

On Thee I fix mine eye:
Thou will not leave me in the dust,
In whom my soul does trust.

Which wicked men have set.

But let my soul escape.
PSALM. CXLII.

And my request did frame:

And showed Him my restraint.

My way, and path did know:
Yet in that walk my feet did tread,
Close snares for me were spread.

But no man knowledge took:
My soul of help was quite bereft,
And had no refuge left.

And said this faithful word:
Thou do my Help and Portion stand,
In the Eternal Land.

Brought low with heaviness.
From persecuters me defend,
Unable to contend.
My soul out of the prison bring,
That I Thy praise may sing.
And for this bounty showed to me,
The just shall honor Thee.
PSALM. CXLIII.
As Psalm 25.

Presented in Thy fear:
With mercy answer my request,
In humblest words expressed.

Thy servants daily fails;
For no man living, in Thine eye,
Himself shall justify.

My soul, by ways undue,
Make me in darkness hide my head,
Like those have long been dead.

Is by my griefs oreborne:
My heart within me desolate,
Through my dejected state.

In my remembrance hold:
Thy wonders past I meditate,
And all Thy works of late.

Like as the thirsty Lands
The fruitful raines desire to see,
So thirsts my soul for Thee.

My fainting spirit heed:
Least if Thou frown, I prove like those,
The pit of Death does close.

Betimes Thy kindness hear.
In Thee I trust: reveal that Path,
Thy truth prescribed has.

Who in my wrongs delight:
To Thee my soul for shelter flies,
Against her enemies.

That I may please Thee still:
Let Thy good spirit me direct,
To live with Thine elect.

Cleanse Thou my sinful stain;
For Thy great Name, and justice sake,
My soul from trouble take.

My comfort is Thy word.
Then of Thy goodness those destroy,
Who in my sorrows joy.
PSALM. CXLIV.

Who taught my hands to fight:

My people to subdue.

Thy notice should him grace?

Like to the passing shade.

Come down to earth below.
Touch their proud tops, and then thy stroke.
Shall make the mountains smoke.

And them by scattering wast;
Let Thy sharp arrows, against them shot,
Destruction make their lot.

Me from the swelling wave.

Whose right hand acts deceit.

Upon the Psalterie:
And on the ten-string'd Instrument
Ditties of praise invent.

His help to David brings:
From peril of the Sword, and grave,
He does His servant save.

Whose mouth against Thee bands:
Whose right hand falsehood does defend;
Whose deeds in rapine end.

Shall flourish in their youth:
Our daughters like fair columns be,
Which we in Temples see.

Our sheep bring thousands more,

Cause in our streets complaint.

Which is in such a case:
Yea blessed are, and happy, they,
Who God their Lord obey.
PSALM. CXLV.
Sing this as Psalm 100.

And of Thy Name for ever sing;

And yield Thy Name eternal praise.

His greatness is by none exquir'd.

How mighty His achievements are.

Thy wondrous works Majestic State:

All men shall speak, and I proclaim.

Thy goodness, and Thy righteousness;

To mercy swift, to anger slow.

His mercy all His works transcends.

And Saints Thy praise shall celebrate.

By them Thy glorious acts are show'n:

Thy mighty power, and Majesty.

When men decay, and time is past.

And men cast down from ruin call.

Who in due season meat do send:

Does satisfy their just desires.

In Holiness His works He lays.

Who faithfully upon Him call.

Who fear Him, and regard their cry:

But all the wicked will destroy.

Shall loud, and thankful accents raise:
And let all flesh, whom He did frame,
For ever bless His Holy Name.
PSALM. CXLVI.

And bless Him, whilst I live.

Until my being end.

Nor in the Sons of dust;
Who nor themselves, nor others save
From the devouring grave.

He turns to earth again.
And, as his time of life expires,
So perish his desires.

On God relyance has:
Who makes the fear of Him his scope,
And object of his hope.

With all that Those contain:
And when their frame is quite defaced,
His truth shall ever last.

Who are oppressed by might:
Feeds those that are to want exposed;
And has the Captives loosed.

He makes the fallen to rise:
He upon such bestows his care,
Who just and faithful are.

And fatherless relieve:
When wicked men are overthrown,
And all their hopes cast down.
Sion, reigns,
His glory still remains.
Then to thy everlasting King
Eternal praises sing.
PSALM. CXLVII.

It is, His praise to sing.
Salem does repair:
Whose outcasts gathered are.

Relieves the wounded's smart:

And by their names does call.

His Wisdom infinite:

But cast's the wicked down.

Your thankful hymns repeat;
And to the Harpes melodious string
His constant praises sing.

And covers it with clouds:
Who powers his rain on earth below,
And makes the Mountains grow.

And, from their airy nest
When the young ravens to Him cry,
Feeds Them abundantly.

Nor values humane force:

And in His mercy hope.
Jerusalem O praise the Lord;
Sion, Thy God record:

And has thy children blessed.

Fills thee with corns increase.

And, soon as said, are done.

Hoare frost like ashes strowes:

Who can withstand His cold?

Which melts them to a thaw:
He causes His strong wind to blow,
And makes the waters flow.
Jacob show,
Makes him His judgment know.
And to his chosen Israel
He does His Statutes tell.

Nor thus His Love reveal;
Who nor His judgments knew, nor word:
Therefore, Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM. CXLVIII.
To the proper Tune.

Who sits above the sky:

Ye Hosts Celestial;

Both Night and Noon,
Ye Stars of light
His praise recite.

Ye waters them above,

Created This great frame.
He did command

By His decree
They lasting be.

Ye dragons, and all deepes:

The furious winds that blow:
Storms that fulfill
His sacred will,
And serve His word,
Praise ye the Lord.

Ye Hills, which lower ly;
All trees that fruitful are,
The Cedars tall and fair:

Or pastures yield;
Each creeping thing;
And bird of wing.

People, who them obey:
Princes of royal birth,
And Judges of the earth:

Old men, and babes,

His awful name:
His Name does all excel,
In earth, or Heaven that dwell:

Of all His Saints the praise:
Even Jacob dear,
His care most near;
Joined in accord,
Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM. CXLIX.
Sing this as Psalm 119.

Which ye to God may sing:
And let the quire of Saints His praise
In their assembly raise.
Israel in Him rejoice,
Who formed him with his voice:
Let all the Sons, from Sion spring,
Be joyful in their King.

The glory of His Name:
Let them sing praises with the Harp,
With Timbrell shrill and sharp.

Who celebrate His Rites:
And those with meekness who abound,
Are with salvation crowned.

And sing upon their beds:

Their voices exercise.
And in their hand a Two-edged sword
Be put, to act His word,

And peoples punishment:

With manacles to bind,
And their rebellious Nobles lead
In iron fettered.

His judgment threat'ned has:
And in fair Characters engrave;
His Saints such honor have.
PSALM. CL.

To praise His Holiness:
O praise Him in His powers extent,
Who rules the firmament.

Our wonder which invite:
In praises due His greatness tell,
Which all things does excel.

With Cornets shake the ground:
His praise the Psaltery inspire,
With the melodious Lyre.

His honor in the Dance.
Praise Him with Organs, Violls, Flutes,
And the well-stringed Lutes.

Praise Him on Cymbals high:

His Maker praise till death.
