A Friends advice, In an excellent Ditty, Concerning the variable Changes in
this life.
To pleasant new Tune,


WHat if a day, or a month, or a year
crown thy delights,
With a thousand wished contentings?
Cannot the chance of a night, or an hour
cross thy delights
with as many sad tormentings?
Fortune in her fairest birth
are but blossoms dying,
Wanton pleasures doting mirth,
are but shadows flying;
All our joys are but toys.
idle thoughts deceiving,
None has power of an hour,
in our lives bereaving.
What if a smile, or a beck, or a look,
feed thy fond thoughts
with many a sweet conceiving?
May not that smile, or that beck, or that look
tell thee as well
they are but vain deceiving?
Why should Beauty be so proud,
in things of no surmounting?
All her wealth is but a shroud
of a rich accounting;
Then in this, repose no bliss,
which is so vain and idle,
Beauties Flowers, have their hours*
Time does hold (...) B^^^^^
What if the World with allures of her wealth
raise thy degree
to a place of high advancing?
May not the World by a check of that wealth
put thee again
to a low despised changing?
Whilst the Sun of wealth does shine,
thou shall have friends plenty,
But come want then they repine,
not one abides of twenty;
Wealth and Friends, holds and ends,
all your fortunes rise and fall,
Up and down, rise and frown,
certain is no state at all.
What if a grief, or a strain, or a fit,
pinch thee with pain,
or the feeling pangs of sickness?
Does not that gripe, or that strain, or that fit
show thee the form
of thy own true perfect likeness?
Health is but a glimpse of joy,
subject to all changes.
Mirth is but a silly toy
with mishap estranges,
Tell me then silly Man,
why art thou so weak of wit,
As to be in jeopardy
when thou may in quiet sit*
The second part
to the same Tune*
THen if all this, have declared thine amiss
take it from me
as a gentle friendly warning;
If thou refuse, and good counsel abuse
thou may hereafter,
dearly buy thy learning;
All is hazard that we have,
there is nothing biding,
Days of pleasure are like streams,
through fair Meddows gliding,
Wealth or woe, Time does go,
there is no returning,
Secret Fates, guides our States,
both in mirth and mourning,
Man's but a blast, or a smoke, or a cloud
that in a thought
or a moment he is dispersed:
Life's but a span, or a tale, or a word,
that in a trice,
on sudden is rehearsed,
Hopes are changed, and thy thoughts are crossed
Will nor skill prevails
Though we laugh and live at ease,
change of thoughts assaileth,
Though a while, Fortune smile,
and her comforts frowneth,
Yet at length, fails her strength
and in fine she frowneth.
Thus are the joys of a year in an hour,
and of a month,
in a moment quite expired;
But in the night, with the word of a noise,
crossed in the day
of an ease our hearts desired;
Fairest Blossoms soonest fade,
withered, foul and rotten,
And through greatest joys,
quickly are forgotten:
Seek not then (mortal men)
earthly fleeting pleasure,
But with pain, strive to gain
Heavenly lasting Treasure.
Earth to the World* as Man to the Earth,
has but a point,
and a point is soon defaced,
Flesh to the Soul, as Flower to the Sun,
that in a storm
or a Tempest is disgraced;
Fortune may the body please
which is only carnal,
But it will the Soul disease,
that is still immortal,
Earthly joys, are but toys,
to the Souls election,
Worldly grace, does deface,
Man's Divine perfection.
Fleshly delight to the Earth that is fleshly
may be the cause
of a thousand sweet contentings;
But the defaults of a fleshly desire
brings to the Soul
many thousand sad tormentings;
Be not proud presumptuous man,
since thou art a point so base,
Of the least and lowest Element,
which has least and lowest place,
Mark thy Fate, and thy State,
which is only Earth and Dust,
And as Grass, which alas
shortly surely perish must.
Let not the hopes of an Earthly desire
bar thee the joys,
of an earnest contentation,
Nor let not thy eye on the world be so fixed
to hinder thy heart*
from unfeigned recantation;
Be not backward in that course
that may bring thy Soul delight,
Although another war may seem
far more pleasant to thy sight;
Do not go, if he says do,
that knows the secrets of thy mind,
Follow this, thou shall not miss,
an endless happiness to find.
