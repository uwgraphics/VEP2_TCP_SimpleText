A Proclamation for the speedy payment of all such sums of Money as are due
to His Majesty for Customs, or other Duties upon Merchandise, into His
Majesty's Receipt at His City of Oxford.

WHereas great sums of Money are due to Us, as well in Our ancient Right, as
by several Acts made this Parliament for Customs, Duties, and Impositions
upon Merchandise, which either have not been paid to Our Farmors, Officers, or
Collectors, or remain still in their hands, whereby We have not in this Our
great necessity the benefit of Our own Revenue; We do hereby Will and
Command all Our Officers, Farmors and Collectors, in all and every of Our Ports
of this Kingdom, who have received any Duties, Customs or Impositions upon
Merchandise, due to Us, either by any act of Parliament, or in Our ancient
Right since the beginning of this Parliament, that they forthwith pay all such
sums of Money, as remains in their hands upon any such Receipts, into the
Receipt of Our Exchequer at Our City of Oxford, and at, or into no other place.
And We likewise Will and Command all such Persons who have entered into Bonds,
or other obligations to any Ministers, Officers or Collectors of the said
Customs, for the payment of such Duties, that they pay the same into Our said
Receipt at Our City of Oxford, and at, or into no other place, and We do
hereby promise to save and keep harmless all such Persons from any penalty or
damage, by reason of such Bonds; and we do expect a strict obedience to
these Our commands from all Persons whom it may concern, as they tender Our
service, and will answer the contrary at their utmost Perils.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, this 23. of February, in the Eighteenth year of
Our Reign.
