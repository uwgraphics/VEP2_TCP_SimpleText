A Choak-Peare FOR THE PARLIAMENT.

The Peoples thanks to the Parliament.
We thank you thrice most blessed Parliament
For your twice three years happy government:
For we enjoy more than we did before,
(Though you have Robbed us of our bloods and store)
More miseries, and plagues we have from you,
More Taxes than before we ever knew:
More Wars, more Oaths, jarres, dissentions, strifes,
Then we e're knew before in all our lives.
We thank you for them all; And thanks from us
For making of our King so glorious.
We thank you too for shedding of our bloods
We know you will say, You did it for our goods.
'Twas for our goods indeed, you robbed us all,
And for your goods we thus conclude your fall.
Those cursed Traitors that would kill their King,
Unto a hanging we will quickly bring.
Printed at Colechester, in the Year 1648.

A CHOAK-PEAR FOR THE PARLIAMENT
The Parlimaent may now go fiddle,
For Nol and Pom's cut off by the middle.
DROP, Drop ye fruit of perdition, for now ye are ripe for vengeance: Saitmarsh
I believe dyed a Prophet, for he said God had forsaken your bloody Army; and
well observed, ye have thrive accordingly: How many of your gods a horseback
are gone of an Embassy to Pluto since the death of that holy man? Cromwell led
the way as if his Nose should have lighted the rest through the kingdom of
Darkness, many a hundred have followed after; Black Tom went about twelve thou
and into Kent, and came out about eight thousand, what the devil became of the
rest? King Cromwell went into Wales nine thousand, and came out -- -- o, what
become of them? King Gowty-legs eight thousand before Colchester, besides some
regiments of horse and foot drawn off from other places; and (setting the
Ill-dependants aside that came to him since) not above sive thousand of his
eight is left alive; King Tom (as I heard from a holy Sister that newly came
from the Leaguer) shot in the guts with a chain bullet, (pray God it be no
worse) by the brave one eyed gunner, which has made many a hundred of the
Saints eat bullets and shite sizgiggs, witness Shambrook the fire-lock maker
in Tower street. The very same man it seems has taken upon him his cure, and
has performed it with much dexterity, by a Pill or two sent to him by that
trusty and fure messenger Mrs Sweet-lips, that seldom miscarries when she goes
of errands to the Saints; But Whalley that hump-back'd Leveller, took great
pains to little purpose, and levelled a Culvering, and fired it himself at my
Lord Gorings Gunner, and (as he thinks) has killed him, if not, then he is
alive: howsoever Whalley did his good will, and deserves five hundred pounds
out of Sir Charles Lucas his Estate for his good will, and to be made chief
quack over the Independent Drakes, that the pretty Ducks of Reformation may not
want treading, nor whole broods of sincear ducklings to increase and multiply
the number of the Saints so pitifully powdered of late, by that one eyed
Malignant.

Whose clouded bullets, wrapped in smoke and fire,
Has given the Rebels their just weed and hire.
And now Weymor Castle has larnt of her Counen Pembrook-up Poyer, for the
Round-besiegers perceiving a Fleet of Ships consisting of about some Forty
Sail to ride upon the Downs, began to betake themselves to their heels, and
run from it; but finding they were bound toward Callis, they furiously
returned, and began to shoot like so many feirce Dragons: but they in the
Castle, placing dry straw and pitchbarrels and discharged some Grannadoes upon
the Castle, they lighted therein, and made such a flame and smother, that the
Ronnd-heads began to storm them, thinking the Castle had been a fire; the
Garrison and Soldiers skreeking out as if they were frightened; crying,
Quarter, quarter, quarter; and stuffed a Suit of the Governors with straw, and
flung it over the walls, and presently set the Gates wide open; which the holy
Saints perceiving, ran on them with open mouth as if they would have eat both
them and the Castle; but the Garrison cunningly ordered themselves very
discreetly, received them with whole vollies of shot, and killed at least
fourscore upon the place, and made the rest of the Saints fly back with a
vengeance; as if they had run for their lives, and bid the devil take the
hindmost.

As if their mothers had been light heeld wenches,
These holy Children run, and left their trenches.
Noble Poyer has behaved himself with so much gallantry, Success edging his
Sword so sharp, that with its motion it still gains the Victory; has raised
the Seige before Pembrook, and has sent several Companies into Glamorganshire
and other places, to requite them for their former favors; those that escaped,
are merely spiritual men, for they have no more flesh then will just cover
their bones, and no more clothes then will just cover their flesh, and those
clothes they have are made of Independent slink-skins, otherwise called their
own taun'd hides: They marched away as theevishly as they could, and took no
more then what ever they could lay their singers on: not one amongst forty of
them was able to bear his Arms, not only for weakness, but because they had
them not.

Several parties are upon pursuit of them in Gloucestershire and Shrop-shire,
and I make no doubt will quite spoil their plundering: The women where ever
they come are frightened with them, taking them to be Spirits.

Her Cousen Jenken-ap-Rice-ap-John have called over all her Pigg-worthies from
her Cousen Glendower to Pruit: and have keep her creat Feast next Saint Taffies
Day, and have Common Prayer said in her creat hall for all her Victories over
the persidious Enemy, the ROUNDHEAD.

Colchester is for a certain releived with all Provisions; three Ships came in
laden with Wheat, Rye, Powder, Bullet, and other Ammunition, so that they can
hold out for two months, and longer if need be; The 5 of this instant Sir
Charles Lucas issued out with a thousand foot and three hundred horse, and
suddenly fell upon their guard at the East bridge, surprised them, killed and
routed most of them, very few of them escaping, who run away to their main
guard; they took three pieces of Ordnance, three hundred arms, and other good
booty, and returned into the town without any loss, only some two or three of
Sir Charles his men were slightly wounded, which made the Saints distaste the
bullets, who presently cried out, Poison, poison; and said by instinct of the
Spirit, they knew that the bullets were rolled in sand, and the gunner was a
devil, sent from the whore of Babylon to torment them before their time; and so
they betook themselves to the ditches, to murder their tormenting backbiters,
which victory they achieved with the crack of a nail, the Spanish pikemen
doing excellent service, and the fire men by traynes of gunpowder blew up many
a thousands of their enemies, so that they had an absolute victory, deserving a
day of Thanksgiving at the least, throughout the City and all the separate
Congregations in England, who are now mustring with might and main all the
forces they can both of horse and foot, and swear by yea and nay, That before
they have done; they will not leave a Cavaleer so much as a rag to cover his
nakedness; but if they should be as good as their words, we shall have more
Sisters come to our Churches than to Conventicles; for I believe there are not
more letcherous in fatiable close whores in the christian world than the She
Ottors of the Separation; but it is in Zeal, and for propogation of the
Righteous, and so the more excusable.

And now let me give you of the City a Caveat or two concerning the deterring
of the Independents from Listing of horse and foot: Pray what Presbyter is
there amongst you so dull and stupid that does not know, That the Rise of the
Independent must be the fall of your selves; therefore it behooves all that hate
Schism, and Blasphemy, to use all possible means to suppress all public and
private Listing of horse and foot, whether under Skippon or any else
whatsoever; and those already Listed to disband with all possible speed; who
are raised most by Independents and other ill-affected persons, more to
overawe and abuse the City, then to protect it.

Next let us consider how active those Independants are in gathering hands, and
promoting Petitions, and using all destructive ways to hinder a Treaty with
the King, doing their utmost (if they could by any means bring their plots to
perfection) to murder his Majesty, and cut of his Posterity, destroy Monarchy,
and set up Anarchy, and bring this languishing Kingdom to utter confusion: for
if they should effect their cursed designs (as God forbid) they would never be
at quiet, but still warring and striving who should be the greatest amongst
them, and who should have the largest portions, for the Saints are as covetous
as the devil, and will have all or none.

How much good would it bring to the Kingdom, if all persons would endeavor a
Cessation of Arms in all parts of the Kingdom until such time the Treaty be
ended, and afterward a total Disbanding of all Armies whatsoever.

So long as Ravening Soldiers on us Prey,
We must look for Peace the clean contrary way.
There is a report that four thousand men are landed within seven miles of
Colechester, I cannot believe it; but yet it may be truth; for the Prince of
Wales is at Sea with six thousand foot Soldiers, and yet is as yet uncertain
where he intends to Land, some say North wards, others does believe he will
land Eastward.

Whether on the Eastern or the Northern shore,
He quickly will have twenty thousand more.
Harry Martin is so pocky hot this weather, that all his hair comes off of his
head, and his Coach sarves for no other use but to carry his brace of
damnations to the Style-yard, to add feuel to his lust, and he like a
Parliament leacher, (for the ease of his bones) ambles after in a Sedan, and in
this state he goes to the Lower bawdy House in the forenoone, and to the upper
house to bath his lust in the afternoon, and at night to his adulterate bed of
foul incontinency.

A Committee chosen by both Houses to consider with a Committee of the
Common Counsel of the City (on purpose to prolong time till they have butchered
more of his Majesty's loyal Subjects) to juggle with the people, and make them
believe they intend a Personal Treaty with his Majesty on purpose to stave
them off, whilst they have hatched their Cockatrice eggs in the Army, and
then, No more addresses, No more Messages: They are weary it seems of sitting
at westminster, and now would adjourn into the City upon condition the City
will secure them: I hope my Couzens the Cuckolds will have the wit to secure
them, and make them answer to the Law too. But now I think on it, the Round
heads are as guilty as any of the jugglers, knaves, fools and madmen of
Westminster, and will agree to any thing they propound, be it never so contrary
to reason or sense: But Harry Vein, Ven, and their brethren would have my
Couzens make a Paraphrase or Exposition upon certain words and phrases that the
Saints understood not before, as where it is said, That they would defend His
Majesty's Royal Person, and the Parliament during the Treaty, according to
their Covenant.

But hence rise the offense, The City would defend his Majesty's Person before
the Parliament, or would defend the King and not the Parliament, or defend the
King after the Treaty, if they should not agree; But the City must engage
forsooth to deliver up the Person of the King to them, if they shall not agree;
and then to Prison again, to a remore secret place, that Rolf may do his office.

Else at the last we might have hope to see,
Our Yoakes pulled off, and our good King set free.
FINIS.
