TO The General, his Excellency THOMAS Lord Fairfax, a Servant to the high and
mighty, and most excellent God, and to the NATION.
SIR,
I need not mention to you nor unto the world that I am a Prisoner, for walking
in a peaceable, lawful and warrantable way, in the claim of justice against
you for the good of my Country, and for a righteous and just satisfaction for
my wrongs, and indeed it is a president of dangerous moment to stifle the
Sovereign affections, that God kindles in the people to righteousness and
justice; it rases the foundations of natures just liberty, and does in a
special manner as it were raise a Battery, and draws in Battalia against
Christian principles. Oh Sir, let not your greatness make you forget before
whom you are, and shall be though you are so far above and beyond me (as I
acknowledge in the earthly glory) yet the Lord is not, nor will be a respecter
of persons in judgment. Sir, shall a man see an evil and calamity hang over
the Nation after such a deluge of blood, and shall he not speak; may not you
have Hamons and Achitophels about you, that may seduce you to unworthy acts
worthy repentance? would you have a man tormented again and again, and (if God
does not bestow a miracle upon him to make him patient) would you torment him
because lie complains; Oh Sir, what just natural liberty is here? What
Christian Liberty is here? Where are the fundamental laws of England? Is there
any thing that is done, by you, or countenanced by you, as done by any power on
your behalf, that is unnatural, that is unchristia^, that is contrary to the
just fundamental laws of England, the Declarations of Parliament and Army,
that does or can conduce to your Fame and Honor: Have not you struck at the
very Virals of liberty and freedom; truly Sir, as poor Mordicai, said, let
not the Queen think she shall escape in the Kings house, more then the rest of
the Jews: so all those that are or ever shall be for the Rights of the People
shall not escape the Lust, Wrath, and Vengeance of Oppressors; Sir, if the
Parliament of England had walked, or had power to have walked against you, or
the whole Army, by the same rules and principles, you and others walk against
me, then you and others had been even as I am, and in humane probability this
Nation had been made a Celdama, and Golgatha, a field of blood, and a place of
Dead men's skuls: You complained against the injustices of men in Parliament, as
if you would have brought forth impartial righteousness. But Sir, whilst my
Appeal was in the House, a Letter came from your self, or some other, by one of
your Clerks, etc. This was condemned in the King, as is mentioned in King
Charles his Case, as a way to subvert Justice: Moreover, I am committed unto
your jurisdiction during pleasure (and so contrary to law) against whom I have
appealed without any judicial sole, supine, and impartial hearing of my
Cause; would you be dealt so with? and would you think it just if a man should
be set upon in the high way, and he should complain unto a Justice of Peace,
and the Justice of Peace should deliver, him over to him that would have
injured him: And here I am told by my Keeper or Jailer, that I neither write to
you nor to the Parliament, nor to any of my Christian friends, but what he must
see, or the Governor, or tyrannical creature and head Jailer must view, who
walks beyond the bonds of my commitment; and is not this hating the light? Oh
horrible cruelty! contrary to the dealings of the Heathen Governor with Paul,
Acts 24.23. And the Governor does commit the Tyrany that so he may be the
better accepted by you and the Parliament to perpetuate his honor and
Tyranny: Is it for your honor that I am (...) prisoner in appealing on the
behalf of public Right, and for particular justice and redress, the latter of
which was formerly against the late King himself in the public Courts of
Justice in Westminster, very common before the blood of War, and that I should
be overcome by force of your influence, and committed without a lawful hearing
of the Cause, would it have been just and honorable, that David should have
imprisoned Nathan. because Nathan told him his evils and tyrannies in the sight
of the Sun, in record to the world to all generations. And if my declaring your
injustices and arbitrarinesse deserve more then a Prison. If a private or a
public Murder, let me say as Christ said to Judas, what you do, do quickly,
for I value my life no more then I value a straw in the Cause of righteousness
and public Justice: How many addresses did I make in a Christian private
manner unto you before I was public, as my appeal expresses. And my former
silence encouraged you to go on to deal unnaturally and cruelly with me, and
so I could not but imagine might encourage you against other Members in the
Commonweal: And indeed one of my Enemies could say to me that he did find
that you had a disaffection to me, because it was thought that I had an
influence in the honest Country men's Petitions; Sir, if you strike in the
Nations and my close enemies designs, I must needs appeal against you, for
they themselves are not seen all the while, and they can make you bear any
unrighteous burden when they please; and indeed you must bear it in the sight
of the Lord and Just men if you own their designs; they walk in the dark, and
make you authorize their impieties designs and cruelties; and truly Sir, if I
had not the Image of a man, or of your own kind in Creation, but of another
creature you might have scarce dealt so with me, with reason: And truly Sir,
such men that have had the credit and power to abuse the Commonwealth and Army
in and with your Person, may subvert the very ends for which this Army was
declared to be raised and solemnly engaged to stand to; Sir, I was fasted out
of my right, in one of my causes, and after 420. miles riding and losses, could
have no hearing or trial, or Christian reference, as my App^ale express^s. And
secondly, after all my labors expenses indebtements, and zealous affections to
your particular Person and personal Conduct (in order and subserviency to the
right of Country (as the Troops and my self did lately subscribe unto) which I
must confess, I deem supreme to any personal honor (which is accounted by
many of your favorites a dangerous, mutinous, seducing principle.) I challenge
the greatest Machivilian or enemy to the peoples right to tax me with the
contrary Judgment, Opinion, Practice, or Expression.

But Sir, I delivered a second appeal unto the house to show the illegality
and unchristianesse of their commitment I could not have it read. The world
cannot but in common reason see this vile in the presence of God and just men,
And truly Sir you need not ask who shall be Judge Mr. Solliciter Cook
shows in King Charles his case there are indemonstrable principles,
principles of nature engraven in any man's heart and written in such legible
Characters that he that runs may read, and there is nothing but Corruption and
interests is the bloody interposer and obstructer thereof or of an equal
distribution of righteousness, And as for my just principles (confessed indeed
also by the Parliament so that I am not left without witnesses) in its primtite
and masculine constitution and diverse times in their necessities of the people
and also by the Army in their declarations: I had rather be torn limb from
limb by wild Horses and chopped as Herbs for the Pot as the Tyrants of old
did, then lay the Testimonies of God, principles of righteousness (the glory
of any nation) at the foot of any flesh alive; And if I must be butchered
masiacred or destroyed, be kept from a legal hearing be kept from the free
and uninterrupted society of my friends and the free declaring of my self in
order to my cause which is the depth of Tyranny the will of the most high be
done, and if possible I could (if I must be forceibly murdered by any of my
fellow Soldiers) I would stand and see the blood run forth with delight for
my Country till I had none left to support my Carcass, and if I may not have
impartial judgment, and righteousness amongst men I shall leave my cause to
him who will not be satisfied with this answer that you are in the head of an
Army and have power to tyrannize over me obstruct, my right, and destroy me
in my tender years and liberties, and before whom when he enters into
judgment with all flesh this will not justify you, that you shall say that
such particular persons had a private influence upon you to abuse you, or be
an occasion of your destroying any man, in life, liberty, or estate contrary
unto reason or righteousness.

And now I address unto you in more particular manner from the Lord of Hoasts,
the God of Armies, the God of Justice and righteousness, the King, the
Governor of the world, the everlasting God, the Judge, the Lawgiver, who has
told me perfectly in the Conscience by his spiritual and certain testimony,
that fithence you have overturned the face of all authorities, under a notion
of righteousness and Justice, that the Lord will require all the innocent
blood oppressions and cruelties from the day of the death of the late King, at
your hands and at the hands of Lieutenant General Cromwell and and Commissary
General Ireton in an especial manner, and others that have pretended to
Impartial righteousness in the House of Commons; and the Lord has enforced
my spirit to tell you so and declare it to you diverse times in my enjoyments of
my God in my bonds, and the Lord has engaged himself to me in my Cause, and
will stand by me, and has commanded me to tell you, that I am in his name and
for this his Nations sake, to demand reparations to for my unrighteous
imprisonment, and freedom for it, and that I may have a freespeedy and
judicial hearing of my cause, and that I may have the liberty of the choice of
half of those men of the House that I shall deem are impartial and unbrased
and not corrupt men for the hearing and trial of the business; and that the
hearing may be open and public in the sight of the Sun, and that the
obligation of impartial righteousness may be upon them according to the
nature of just judgment, and that there be writers on both sides to take
exactly what is said on the behalf of the Commonweal, the Army and my own
right, and every one in one another; And the Lord has engaged himself for me
and I know the Lord will support me and carry me forth to make it appear,
against you, or any of those that have seduced you to destroy me, and under me,
even him that was the chief author of the Declarations of the Army, and the
Lord will assist me to make it appear that the actions and dealings with me
are contrary to the law of nature in creation; The fundamental Laws of
England, the solemn Declarations of the Parliament and Army, the Scriptures,
and contrary to the glorious light of the most high in the Spirit; so I leave
you to the Lord of righteousness, justice, goodness, and mercy, (who has
professed a care of Sparrowes and the hairs of a man's head) and do subscribe my
self in faithfulness and truth.

From my captivity, slavery, and arbitrary imprisonment, as to men, though I
have freedom, joy, and abundance of consolation as to God, in Windsor Castle.
Your Excellencies real Servant if you are faithful to the most excellent just
and impartial God in the Nations freedoms. WILLIAM BRAY.
