The Armies Declaration, Being a true Alarm in answer to a false and fiery
one, made lately by that detestable Rump, etc.
Brethren and Fellow Soldiers,
When I consider those unparalled actions both of scandal and sedition,
those many changes and overthrows in Government, those strange and horrid Oaths
and Engagements, which by the subtilty of a few turbulent and seditious
spirits, we have been seduced to make our selves guilty of, how that by the
knacks and pretenses of ambitious Usurpers, we have almost been the ruin of
our native Country: and under pretense of liberty both of State and
Conscience, have almost overwhelmed the Nation with Anarchy in State, and the
strangest confusion in the Church; whereby not only the glory of the Nation is
decayed, but our selves made infamous to all posterity, if by our speedy
repentance, we do not return from our backslidings, and with heart and hand
join together, for the restitution of it to its former happiness. When (I say)
I consider these things, I cannot but with the greatest grief and regret detest
and abhor those enormous crimes, which by the instigation and delusion of our
Superiors we have daily been guilty of, and are (it seems) again courted unto,
by those grand contrivers of the Nations ruin, which as they have formerly, so
(conceive) once more they shall by their spurious mask of a Good old Cause, and
defense of the good people of the Land, the glorious pretenses of Freedom and
Liberty, both as men and Christians, and such like hypocritical cantings,
seduce and draw us from the obedience of our General, and the real authority;
to the Egyptian bondage of an Anarchical tyranny, and to the inevitable ruin
both of our selves, and the Nation.

Being truly sensible of these their machinations, which are not only secretly
carried amongst us, and the seeds of Sedition privately sowed, but they are
bold to give us loud Alarums, and to our no small ignominy proclaim to the
world, that they conceive us fit persons for any villainy, which can but
cunningly be suggested to us, in defense therefore not only of my self as a
Member of the Army, but also of you my fellow soldiers (whom I am confident
will unaimously subscribe to what I have here written) I here present both you
and the world with a true Alarm, in opposition to that false fire which was
lately shot in by the Rump amongst us.

The Gentleman (or as some say the Villain, T. Scot) begins his Libel with
something to our purpose: standers by do often see more then the Gamester, He
little considers how ample testimony we can give to the truth of this; not
knowing I suppose, that whilst we have resided in Scotland, and so have been
remote from their actions and undertakings we have had leisure and experience
to search them to the depth, and find them to be a crew of Atheistical,
perfidious, and traitorous Rascals, who whilst they have by a close and
well-carried hypocrisy made the glory of God, and liberty of the people their
outward pretenses, have only bent themselves to increase their own estates,
and perpetuate their power, to the utter inslaving of all English men. He need
not tell us he has discovered more then many of us, when either he has not
yet known, or else pretends him. self ignorant, that we so far detest such
villanons usurpers, that we almost hate and loath our selves, for our ever
being seduced and drawn aside by such impudent and juggling Mountebanks

I beseech you Brethren, pardon my transportation, which I confess to be a
little beyond the bounds of a moderate Reply; but what can a person deserve at
our hands, who has scandalized, and traitorously endeavored the ruin and
destruction of our renowned General, who notwithstanding the black-mouthed
envy of such hellish firebrands, will still be found to terminate all his
actions in the peace and settlement of his Country and Nation. But least my
Gentleman should think he had too hard measure, and call this only railing at
random, I shall take notice of such particular heads of his papers, as may best
require an answer, or deserve taking notice of.

The Basis on which he builds all the rest of his discourse, is the old cheat
and juggle, wherewith we and the Nation were Gulled in 1648. Wherein, says he,
you engaged and promised, That you would see the Government of these Nations
established upon the just and secure fundamentals and constitutions of Freedom:
and Safety to the people, in relation as they were men and Christians, and that
in the ways of a Commonwealth, and Free-State-Government, without King,
single Person, or House of Lords. This is that (which the Gentleman endeavors
to persuade us throughout his whole Pamphlet) we are obliged to perfist in to
our lives end; and in this cause undertaking solely, we must (according to his
Opinion) only expect the blessing and assistance of Almighty God; and to
recede a jot from this, is to turn Apostates from the cause of God, and to
encur the danger of our own ruin and destruction.

I shall not perplex the man with multiplicity of words, only desire him to
ponder these two particulars. First, Whether his Masters and fellow partners in
iniquity, who were the cause and promoters of this Engagement, did not long
before (not only at their entrance into the Parliament House, but also
solemnly in the solemn League and Covenant) swear and protest in the presence
of God, and the face of the world, that they would maintain the King in his
just Rights and Privileges, and preserve his posterity; and whether this was
not the only ground and reason that we, and so many honest men in the Nation
were induced to take, up arms and assert their interest. Secondly, Whether it
can be made out by the Laws of God or man, that an Oath utterly unlawful in it
self, and wholly destructive to the good of a Nation, ought rather to be kept,
then repented of.

I suppose neither he nor his Companions can be so impudent as to deny (though
they have been so impious as to forswear themselves) the first particular; but
methinks I hear them presently ready to reply, that they intended no more by
the taking that Oath, then the maintenance and preservation of themselves and
the people; and that they found it absolutely necessary for the good of the
Nation, to infringe and forget this their solemn Covenant: That they always
reserved to themselves that mental reservation, provided the safety of the
King, might be for their own, and the security of the good people of the Land:
That where the Liberties of the Nation were so highly concerned, there Salus
Populi, suprema Lex esto; The safety of the people must be the only
interpreter of all their reiterated Oaths and protestations; and upon these
specious and gilded pretenses they proceeded to the cutting off their lawful
Sovereign, and craftily draw us in to be Bauds to their actions, whilst we
suffer our selves to be cheated with those Golden baits of Religion and
Liberties; and so whilst we mean nothing but good, cause us to perpetrate the
height of' mischiefs: Having broken the first Article of their Oath, the
preservation of the Kings Majesty, they presently conclude there can be no way
to maintain their wicked actions, but by committing a second as horrid and
villainous, and so proceed to the utter exclusion and banishment of his
Posterity; a crime which even the Turks themselves would be ashamed to
perpetrate.

And now must we be drawn in to be compartners of their Villainies? they by all
the canting terms and spiritual expressions, the quaintest of their Independent
adherents can invent, represent the Kingly Government as arbitrary and
tyrannical, and that England could never enjoy a firm peace and security, but
by the utter abolishing of a Monarchical Government; and we who were only led
by the blind faith we had in our (as we thought) Religious Commanders, are
easily drawn into the net, and suffer our selves to be caught in that snare,
which have since found, did entangle the Nation in such fetters as have not
been by any Power to be knocked off.

But now since it has pleased God of his mercy to open our eyes, and make us
(by his blessing upon our General's indefatigable endeavors) in some sort
instrumental to the restoring of our Country from that bondage which she has
by our delusions long groaned under; let not these impious and unparalleled
Traitors think us either so sottish as to return with the Dog to his vomit, or
so seired in our consciences, as not seriously to repent of our former
miscarriages. We confess we took an Oath to set up a Commonwealth; but we
never swore to destroy the Nation, we engaged to defend the People of God, but
never to maintain a crew of Atheistical hypocrites: Nay further, We confess we
engaged against a King or House of Lords, but did not by that intend the ruin
of our Native Country; and when these two come in competition, that either we
must relinquish and recede from this our Engagement, or else still be made use
of to enslave our Countrymen, and utterly destroy our already dying Stare: We
cannot be so stupid and sencelessy bewitched, not to think it better seriously
to crave pardon of God for this our Engagement, and the Nation for the wrong we
have hitherto done them, then by our obstinate persisting in such wicked
Engagements, sell our selves to the Devil, and the Kingdom to ruin.

The next point of this pious Gentleman's design, is no less, to make us turn
absolute Rebels to our General, and upon this his grand endeavors are, under
the notion of Cavalier-Reports, to make him a designer of bringing and
restoring the late King's Son. We will not dispute whether this be his
insentions, only we shall take occasion to tell the Gentleman in a word, That
we are no such Enomies to the Nation as he takes us to be, but do solemnly
resolve, That if it shall seem good to the Nation and our General to restore
the banished Prince to his rightful Inheritance, we shall with one heart and
hand readily submit to, and concur with them in it; and as we have been so
signal for our disobedience, so for the future endeavor to testify our selves
true and loyal subjects to our Prince, and faithful and loving defenders of our
Country.

In the next place our Libeller craftily endeavors to render our General
odious to the Presbyterian party, and like a wise man indeed, has no other way
to bring it about, but by telling them he will and does intend to bring in King
Charles, as if that were such a Bugbear to a sober Presbyterian: but (says
he) if he be restored, there must necessarily likewise throng in with him
Archbishops, Bishops, and the rest of that Hierarchy, and they shall then be
accounted no other by them, but Sectarians and Phanaticks, etc. Alas my friend!
you are too well known for a lying imposter, to be able to impose any of these
forgeries upon any sober or godly Presbyterian whatsoever; nor is there so
great difference between a moderate Episcopal man, and a sober Presbyterian,
but that both will jointly meet and kiss each other, for the settlement of the
Nation in peace and unity. But the man has yet a fetch farther, The Queens
Mother will come, and then Moncks, Jesuits and Priests of all sorts will she
bring with her, and so Popery will (cum Privilegio) be again readmitted into
the Nation. I perceive that a small supposition is sufficient for this Libeller
to build a conclusion on; it is ten to one whether ever the Queen return again,
though the King be restored to his Right, and should she, yet cannot those
household servants she brings with her, though they should all be Jesuits,
Priests, etc. be so dangerous and destructive to Religion as those innumerable
multitudes of those people who at present lurk in our Phanatick Conventicles.

His next particular consists in advice and dehortations from those persons
whom he calls our bests friends, and the good people of the Nations, those whom
he says bled with us, prayed for us, and been constant assertors of the
Interest of the Nation, against King-ship, single person, or House of Lords;
and what think my Brethren, are these our so good friends, but those who having
made a gainful bargain by embarking themselves in a quarrel against their
Prince, do shiver at all thoughts of a reconciliation, lest a restitution of
their ill gotten goods should follow; and would now make us believe it is the
Interest of the Nation, though with never so much expense of blood and
treasure; never so many perjuries and acts of Rebellion, to maintain these men
in their wrongfully gotten, and we might justly say as wrongfully detained
Possessions and Acquists.

But to proceed; they tell us, We are the only Bulwark they must rely upon,
and if we fail, the Cause of God must sinck with us; and that to bring our
destruction about (and for no other ends) the Militia throughout England is
settled in such hands as are perfect haters and opposers of our Interest; and
that above all others the Militia of London do threaten (as the Danes were
formerly served) to make a black and bloody Night in cutting our throats, and
offering whole Hecatombs of our Carcasses to the restitution of Charles, whom
they call their King. Surely the Gentleman thinks we have as bad consciences as
themselves, and that because we cannot pardon our selves, the Nation can never
be induced to pardon us; but let him and his fellow Phanaticks know, That the
Army has no reason to fear the People of England, when they separate
themselves from their corrupted interest, and the Army can expect no truer
friend, or surer play master then the City or London, as long as the army shall
truly prove friends to the cause of the Nation; and that this Cause and the
Gentleman's are quite distinct things, the Voice of the people, and our own
experience, will testify.

In the next place he endeavors to fright us to his party, by telling us, that
on whatsoever terms the King may be brought in, and whatsoever fair pretenses
he may make, yet at last all must terminate in the loss of our friends, wives,
and children, and the for ever misloving of our posterity. Alas, Sir, the cheat
is now stale, and we understand our selves better then so, as to think any man,
much less the King, so strange a master, that he must sacrifice us all to his
lust and revenge. Now we find where the shoo wrings; it is not the soldiery are
like to suffer by his restitution; no, it is a Scot, a Hasilrigge, a Walton, and
such, who having been already drunk with the blood of the slain, and gorged
themselves with the plentiful dishes of other men's estates, do now begin to be
terrified in conscience, and to fear the disgorging of their so sweet morsels.

But to track him a little further, he seems already somewhat like mad Tom, but
now turns right Tom Fool, and tells us that his Majesty's readmission must be
necessarily destructive to the welfare of the Nation; and to prove this, he
asserts the vaste charge the Nation must groan under, by the debts of his
father, and himself, which remain unsatisfied. But see what a ridiculous
account he makes. As first, the Arrears of the King in his war against the
Parliament: but I beseech the Gentleman to inform us where those Armies are
which should receive those Arrears, or those soldiers which should demand
their pay, or who ever knew that routed forces had ever any right to demand
their salaries.

The next is the young Kings charges in Scotland, and at Worcester, to which
what I have already said is sufficient answer: so that the Gentleman must
already be fain to substract above half of his twenty years doubled
impositions. The rest, as the debts the King has contracted beyond seas, the
dowry of the Queen Mother, and the debts of his Brothers and Sister, are such
imaginary trifles, that it is more then probable that less then the sum of a
six months Assessments, will defray the charges with an overplus.

And for the next particular, furnishing and maintaining of his Court and
Train, I would desire the Gentleman to consider what was said in the Parliament
House, by a person, who demanded of one of these pretended Commonwealths men,
what he thought the charge of maintaining themselves, and keeping out the
family of the Stuarts would yearly amount to; his answer was, To twenty hundred
thousand pounds; Very good, replied the other, and I dare undertake, that half
that sum would bring him in, maintain him in a just splendour and dignity, and
defray the charges of the Nation besides. And yet these impudent Cozeners would
make us believe, that it were far better to keep him out with the intolerable
oppression and taxation of the people; then by bringing him in to release them
from the greatest part of their burdens and misery.

But to make up his bill of fare, he adds in the next place, That those Dukes,
Earls, Lords, etc. whose estates have been sold and disposed by Authority of
Parliament, must either be restored, or satisfaction given for the same: Yes,
here is that which bites to the quick, and this is the real definitiod of their
Good Old Cause. But I desire Mr. Scot and his friends to consider, whether, if
they should lose all their ill-gotten purchases, they can any way repine
against God's just judgment, who seldom or never continues such unjust
possessions to a second or third generation. But yet if these men can patiently
be quiet, and not by their new acts of treason against the quiet of the
Kingdom, irritate and incense the people against them, there will doubtless be
found out such a medium as may make them no loosers, and yet the Estates return
to the right owners; for I would fain know, if that money which they purchased
these Lands with, be returned to the purchasers, whether they will not be
sufficient gainers by having them so long in their hands; or if this be too
much, as indeed it is to be reason granted, I would fain know whether the time
they have already possessed those Lands, has not already paid them both
principal and interest; but there is another thing which these men fear, that
is, diverse of them have purchased Crown, Church, and Delinquents Lands, and
have agreed to pay at several payments, and some of them have never satisfied
above the first portion; and these are the men which fear (if account should
come to be taken) they might justly be adjudged to part with these Lands at as
trifling a price as they bought them; but I shall say no more as to this
particular, having (I doubt) too far intruded into matters of State, for a man
of the profession of a private Soldier, but shall with the rest of my
fellow-brethren acquiesce, as to this and all other points, in the
determination of the joint body of the Nation.

I shall not proceed much further, or meddle any longer with the rest of his
rabblement, which contains nothing but motions to Seditition, and the ready way
to make us deserve a halter; but for his comfort do tell him, that we really
protest against all such mutinous thoughts and are resolved to live and dye
with our worthy General.

But before I conclude, seeing the Gentleman has been pleased to say so much
to us, let me be so bold as to demand a question of him; Whether one grand
reason of their being Enemies to the King and a free Parliament, do not proceed
from the consciousness of their notorious cheating of the State, and privately
pocketing up the Wealth of the Nation which was raised and paid for discharging
the arrears of the Soldiery, who in the mean time have undergone all hardships
and penury; and yet these Gentlemen can have the impudence to think that we
should leave the assured hope of our pay, and be contented once more with their
imaginary promises, and that we should forsake the service of the nation in
general, to make our selves slaves and Janissaries to the arbitrary wills of
such blood-sucking tyrants. I have done with him; and if he conceive I have
handled him too sharply, let him know I have discharged but the part of a
Gentleman and a Soldier, to vindicate my self and my fellow soldiers from
those detestable Titles of Villains and Mutiniers.

FINIS.
