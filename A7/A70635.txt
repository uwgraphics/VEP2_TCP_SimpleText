A CLOUD OF WITNESSES; OR, THE Sufferers Mirror, Made up of The
SVVANLIKE-SONGS, and other CHOICE PASSAGES of several MARTYRS and CONFESSORS to
the Sixteenth Century, in their Treatises, Speeches; Letters, Prayers, etc. in
their Prisons, or Exiles; at the Bar, or Stake, etc.

Collected out of

The Ecclesiastical Histories of Eusebius, Fox, Fuller, Petrie, Scotland,


And Mr. Samuel Ward's Life of Faith in Death, etc. and Alphabetically disposed.

By T. M. M. A.

Hebr. 12.1. Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a Cloud
of Witnesses, let us run with patience the race that is set before us.

James 5.10. Take, my Brethrea, the Prophets, who have spoken in the Name of
the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction and patience.

London, Printed for Robert Boulter at the Turks Head in Bishopsgate-street

Renowned Mr. Samuel Ward of Ipswich gives the following testimony to the
living speeches of dying Christians, which he collected.
AS for their last Speeches and Apothegms, pity it is no better mark has been
taken, and memory preserved of them. The choice and prime I have culled out of
ancient Stories and later Martyrologies, English, Dutch, and French. The profit
and pleasure has paid me for the labor of Collecting, and the like gain (I
hope) shall quit the cost of thy Reading. -- By these, which are but an handful
of Christ's Camp-Royal, it sufficiently appears; they had their Faith fresh and
lively in the face of their grand Enemy, Death; and by virtue of their Faith,
their Spirits, Wits and Tongues, untroubled, and undismayed.

The learned and ingenious Author of the Preface to Mr. Frith's Treatises of
preparation to the Cross (under the Title of Vox Pisces, or the Book-Fish)
gives the following Testimony to several of the remarkable passages in this
Collection.
PErhaps unto some Palats no Liquor seems desirable, but that which has a
delicious tang of the curiosity of these later Times, both for method and
style. For my part I say with the words in the Gospel, Luke 5.39. The old Wine
is better. And accordingly contemplating and comparing the devout Discourses
written in our Language upon the breaking forth of the Light of Reformation, I
am far more deeply taken with the solid simplicity and powerful Spirit, which
methinks I find in the Writings of those Confessors and Martyrs, who watered
the Garden of Reformation with their own blood in this Land, than with the more
elaborate and artificial composures, written more lately in the Times of our
Peace. Who in reading the Letters and Ghostly Meditations of blessed Bradford,
Tailor, Philpot, etc. yea even of other their Brethren less learned, that wrote
and spoke with that Hand, Heart, and Breath, which they were most ready to
yield up for the testimony of the Truth, does not therein perceive that lively
warmth of holy zeal, which is able to awake even a dull and sleepy soul? Among
which Martyrs, as this worthy Frith is one of the first for antiquity, so well
may he be in the foremost rank for comfortable exhortation and soundness of
Doctrine.

The Collectors Preface.
THe Speeches of dying men are remarkable; the Speeches of dying Christians are
much more remarkable; How remarkable then are the Speeches of dying Witnesses
for Christ? It is rationally expected that dying men, much more that dying
Christians, and most of all that dying Witnesses for Christ should speak best
at last. It is their last. These are the last words of David, 2 Samuel 23.
And the Sun shines brightest at setting. They are immediately to give in
their last account. They are upon the borders of Eternity. And the motions of
Nature are more intense, as they draw nearer the Center. To be sure, Saints are
most heavenly, when nearest Heaven. Rivers, the nearer the Sea, the sooner are
met by the Tide. We have good Scriptureground to expect that dying Christians,
especially dying Witnesses for Christ, should have extraordinary assistances
from on high for their last Discourses: That the Wine of the Spirit should be
strongest in them at their last. They have Gods Word for it, That in that hour
it shall be given them, Mat. 10.19.
what they shall speak: for it is not they that speak, but the Spirit of their
Father.

One observes that when Stephen was to deliver his last speech, and to suffer,
he was filled with the Holy Ghost, so that all that sat in the Council,
looking steadfastly on Stephen, Act. 6.5.
saw his face, as if it had been the face of an Angel. His soul was so warmed
by the love of God, that he looked both his Adversaries and the tempestuous
approaching Storm our of countenance. When he was stoned he got a larger sight.
He saw the Heavens opened, and his majestic Glorious Master, the light-giving
Diamond of Heaven, Act. 7.55.
standing at his Fathers right hand. And this he got, no doubt, as for himself,
so to hearten all those that were to come after, he being the first Martyr
after Christ. Hence it has been often found, that their last Speeches have
been Oraculous and Prophetical. Zenophon personates Cyrus as inspired, whilst
he is breathing out his last requests. The nearer we return to the Original
Divinity (^s Pl^tinus speaks) the more Divine we grow. One observes from a
Scripture instance. That what has been asserted by dying Witnesses, has most
speedily come to pass. Zachariah told the children of Israel, 2 Chr. 24 20, 24.
Because ye have forsaken the Lord, he has also forsaken you. For this he was
immediately stoned, and the Lord sealed his Word very speedily afterward; For
the Assyrians coming with a small company against them, the Lord delivered a
very great multitude into their hands, and so without delay in their sight
sealed the words of his dying Witness Zachariah. And why his word sooner then
Isaiah's, Jeremiah's, Ezekiel's? etc. By them he pleaded much longer with his
Apostatizing Church. I know none but this: It was the Lords pleasure; and to
show his respect to dying Witnesses, that he would have what they say taken
special notice of. It may be, that he might show, that whatever fail, the words
of dying Witnesses shall not fall to the ground. It is true, we must not lay
such weight upon these sayings, 1 Pet. 1.9
as we must lay upon Scripture prophesies; for though such sayings may be true
prophesies, yet we are not infallibly assured that these are prophesies, till
they be accomplished: yet their sayings, while dying for and in the Lord, do
give good encouragement to them that remain alive, and so to be much esteemed
by them; whether they respect the honor of God, or the good of souls.

The last Speeches of Christ's dying Witnesses, have extorted even from Heathens
acknowledgments to the honor of God, Vere magnus est Deus Christianorum
Calocerius.
that truly the Christians God is a great God: yea, by them sinners have been
converted. Justin Martyr and others by observing the end the Martyrs made, were
brought out of love with the ways of sin, and in love with the ways of
holiness.

These Speeches (here collected) are called Swanlike Songs, for their
remarkableness, A Cloud of Witnesses, and The Sufferers Mirror for their
usefulness. The Israelites found not only comfort in the shadow of the Cloud
in the Wilderness, but a directive virtue therein, they were led by it. There
is a double power in such instances both to Comfort, and to assimulate. Solamen
miseris, etc. 1 Cor. 10.13.
To see that others have suffered worse is no small comfort to Sufferers.
Jacob's Sheep conceived according to the color of the Rods, that lay in the
Troughs. Our conceptions will be like our visions: like the examples that are
set before our eyes. Here (as in a Glass) even the best may see their spots;
and all, especially Sufferers, may learn how to dress themselves for death. How
can the best of us read these passages, without shame for our low seize,
for our little proficiency in the School of Christ? How unlike are our faces to
the faces in this Mirror? How self-denying were they? How selfish are we? How
crucified to the world were they? How much glued thereunto are we? How easy
was it for them to choose the greatest Sufferings, rather then the least Sin?
How hard is it for us not to choose the greatest Sin, rather then the least
Suffering? How willing were they to part with all for Christ? How unwilling are
we to part with littles for Christ? What an honor did they esteem it to suffer
for Christ, to be chained, to be whipped, to be wrackt, to be halter'd, to be
staked for Christ? Have we such esteems of sufferings for Christ, and of such
sufferings? Are not we ashamed of our glory? How patient were they under the
greatest tortures? How impatient are we under very little troubles? How hot was
their love to Christ, his truths, ordinances, People? How cold is ours? How
zealous were they for the honor of God? How lukewarm are we? How magnanimous
were they? How cowardly and dastardly are we? How humble were they? How proud
are we? How brokenhearted were they? How hard-hearted are we? What
sympathizing spirits had they? How little fellow-feeling is there now among
Christians? How active were they for the glory of God, and good of souls under
their sufferings? how slothful are we? And how little do we for either under
our sufferings? How strong was their Faith? How weak is ours? How fearless were
they of man, who can only kill the body? How fearful are we? How many of these
Worthies attained unto Assurance, and had their Evidences for Heaven clear? How
are the most of us in the dark, as to an interest in God, and a right and title
to Glory? How willing and desirous were they to die, even a violent death? How
loath are we to die, even a natural death? How did they without the least fear
play on the hole of this Asp, and with much courage put their hand into the Den
of this Cockatrice? But how does the fear of this King of Terrors make us
subject to bondage? Thus they are useful to shame us: They are also useful to
prepare us to die, especially a violent death. Such examples chalk the way more
plainly, Longum iter per praecepta, breve and efficax per exempla, Seneca.
then bare direction: These encourage more heartily: these persuade more
powerfully: these chide unbelief with more authority. I beseech you all, who
are the Lords people, (said one lately) not to scare at suffering for the
interests of Christ; because of any thing you may see fall out in these days;
as to the sufferings of his servants: but be encouraged to do and suffer; for I
assure you, in the Name of the Lord, he will bear all your charges. I do again
assure you, in his Name, he will furnish all your expenses, and bear all your
charges. Mr. Rough learned the way to Martyrdom by seeing and hearing Austo at
the Stake in Smithfield.

Coming from his burning, and being asked where he had been, he made answer,
there where I would not but have been for one of mine eyes: and would you know
where? forsooth, I have been to learn the way. And soon after he followed him
in the same place and the same kind of death. Now if one president made him so
good a Scholar; what Dullards and Non-proficients are we, if such a Cloud of
Instances work not in us a cheerful ability to expect and encounter the same
adversary, so often foiled before our eyes? I shall detain thee no longer from
seeing these rare signts, but now invite thee in the words of Rev. 6.7. The
good Lord add his blessing, that thine eye may affect thy heart, (...), Come
and see.
and that these Remarkable passages may be thus useful to all our souls, and
that the Cloud of Witnesses may not be a standing Witness against any of us.
Farewell.

To the Reader.
Reader,
THe life present is only preparative to that to come, as the hidden life in
the womb to the more perfect and noble life in the world, 1 Col. 12. Salvation
is not instantaneous. The Heirs of Glory make their gradual approaches to it,
and enter upon their Inheritance by degrees, Romans 13.11. And the neares they
come to Heaven, the more heavenly their Spirits are, Could a man but hear the
last breathings and whispers of dying Saints, how would he melt and ravish?
Like the Sun they appear most great and glorious at setting. God often leads
them to the top of Pisgah, whence they have a prospect of Canaan, a little
before they enter in to possess it.

But although God does frequently indulge those that die in the Faith of Christ
with rare and excellent visions of Christ, yet ordinarily those that die for
Christ as well as in Christ, have a Benjamin's portion in comparison of their
Brethren. There is a joy proper to Martyrs, which is bestowed upon them as an
honorarium, partly to reward their faithfulness in trials past; and partly to
encourage them to break through the difficulties which yet remain.

In these joys Heaven is let down to Earth, glory antedated, and a short
salvation here obtained, 1 Pet. 1.8. During the continuance of this glorious
frame, they are acted above the ordinary rate of man, which makes the world
stand at gize, and all that behold them to admire at them. Their aspect is
rather angelical then humane, Acts 6.15. and they seem no longer fit to be
reckoned to the Tribe of mortals on Earth, but rather ranked with the glorious
Saints and Seraphims in Heaven; they no longer wrap themselves up in their
garment of flesh, but the only strife among them seems to be who shall first
cast it off, to put on the garments of glory prepared for them.

Reader, would thou see some of these Earthly Angels? men that are a little
too low for Heaven, and much too high for Earth. Would thou see poor frail
Creatures trampling the World under their feet, and with an holy scorn smiling
at the threats of Tyrants, who are the terrors of the mighty in the Land of the
Living? Would thou see shackled Prisoners behave themselves like Judges; and
Judges stand like Prisoners before them? Would thou see some of the rare
exploits of Faith, in its highest elevation immediately before it be swallowed
up in the beatifical vision? To conclude, Would thou see the heavenly
Jerusalem pourtraied on Earth, as the earthly Jerusalem once was upon a Tile,
Ezekiel. 4.1. And would thou hear the melodious voices of ascending Saints, in a
ravishing consort, ready to join with the heavenly Chorus, in their ravishing
Hallelujahs? Then draw near; come and see. If thou be a man of an heavenly
spirit, here is brave and suitable entertainment for thy spirit. And after thou
have conversed a while with these excellent Spirits, it may be thou will judge
as I do, That dead Saints are sweeter Companions (in some respects) for thee to
converse with, then those that are living. And when thou shall see the
magnificent acts of their Faith, their invincible patience, their flaming love
to Christ, their strange contempt of the World, their plainness and simplicity
in the profession of the Gospel, and their servent love to each other; thou will mourn also with me to consider the scandalous and shameful relapse of
Professors from these glorious heights, and to think how many degrees these
Graces are gone back in the souls of Professors, as the Sun upon the Dial of
Ahaz.

The Judicious Collector has gathered this Posie from the Martyrs Graves,
bound up in an excellent method, and presented it to thee. Here thou have the
Cream of the larger Martyrologies scum'd off, the very Spirits of them
extracted, which is more cheap and less tiresome. He intends if God permit a
Second Part speedily. And I assure thee he is a Person singularly qualified for
the Work, having both Materials and Judgment to dispose his Collections. Bless
God for such profitable Instruments, and improve their Labors. Such a Book
has been long desired, many have attempted it, but every one has not that
Furniture of Books and Parts for it. Solomon detecting some of those artifices
which the Buyer uses in Trading, Prove. 20.14 detects this as one, It is
naught, it is naught (says he Buyer) i.e. he disparageth the Commodity, to
^eat down the price, but when he is gone he boasts. ^ am mistaken if thou
also do not boast of thy penny worth in this Book when thou art gone and have
well perused it, that it may reach the end upon thy ^eart for which it is
designed, is the desire of thy ^riend to serve thee,

J. F.

The Books Poetical Prologue.
I Tell their death's, who dying, made Death yield,
By Scriptures sword, and Faith's unbattered shield.
Their number's numberless who ran to dye
Under their Saviors Standard valiantly.
More Saints ten Tyrant Emperors did slay,
Then for a year, Five thousand to each day.
Since Jesuits from the infernal Lake did rise,
More then Eight hundred thousand lost their lives
In thirty years. Bloody Duke d' Alva willed
In Six years Eighteen thousand to be killed.
In Henry 's and in Mary's Bloody Reign
Eight thousand have inhumanely been slain.
Twelve thousand and seven hundred more were Stockt,
Or Whipped, or Wrackt, or else Exiled, or Mocked.
I only promise many a Swan-like Song;
Read them, and beg of God with heart and tongue,
That as the Vine, that is cut, and pruned bears more
In one year, then it did in three before;
So may Christ's Vine: and may the Saints of God
(As Camomile) grow better being trod.
And may Christ's Sufferers in like cases find
The living God as near, as true, as kind
As these have found; and learn sin more to fear,
Then parting with what er'e they count most dear.
Swan-like SONGS.

Adrian. Ward's life of faith in death. page 160.

ADrian's wife seeing the Coffin hooped with Iron, wherein she was to be buried
alive, spoke thus, Have you provided this Pastycrust to bake my flesh in?

Agnes. Fax's Acts and Monuments, etc. Vel. 1.122.

Agnes a Roman Martyr, contemning all threats of tortures, was assaulted as to
her chastity. To the lascivious Wretch she said, Thou shall willingly bathe thy
sword in my blood, if thou will, but thou shall not defile my body with filthy
lust, do what thou can. Hereupon his eyes were struck out by a flame of fire,
like unto a flash of lightning, and upon her prayer he was restored to sight
again. When she saw a sturdy cruel fellow (to behold) approaching with a naked
sword in his hand; I am now glad (said she) and rejoice more, that such an one
as thou, a stout, fierce, strong, and sturdy Soldier art come, then if one
more feeble, weak, and faint-hearted should come. This, even this is he, I now
confess, that I do love: I will make haste to meet him, and will no longer
protract my longing desire.

Albane. Fox. Vol. 1. page 114.

Albane ( England's Proto-Martyr) delivered up himself to the Soldiers instead
of Amphibolus, who had converted him to Christianity, after he had fled to his
house for refuge, and being bound, was carried before the Judge, who at that
time was sacrificing to his Idols. The Judge perceiving the fraud, told Albane,
Forasmuch as thou had rather convey away the Rebel and Traitor to our gods,
than deliver him up to the Soldiers, that he might undergo due punishment for
blaspheming our gods; look what torments he should have suffered, if he had
been taken, the same shall thou suffer, if thou refuse to practice the Rites of
our Religion. Albane; notwithstanding his threats, told him plainly to his
face, that he would not obey his command. Then said the Judge, of what House
and Stock art thou? Albane answered, It matters not of what Stock I am; but if
thou desire to know my Religion, be it known unto thee, I am a Christian,
etc. Then the Judge demanded his name: my Parents (said he) named me Albane;
and I honor and worship the true and living God, that made all things of
nothing. The Judge told him, If he would save his life, he must come and
sacrifice to their gods. Albane answered, The sacrifice that you offer to the
Devil profits you nothing, but rather purchases for you eternal pains and Hell
fire. The Judge commanded him to be beheaded. The Executioner observing his
faith and servent prayers, fell down at his feet, casting from him the sword,
desired rather to be executed for, or with him, than to do execution upon him;
yet afterward another gave the fatal blow.

Alcock.
Constable Rolf (John Alcocks Master) having bailed his Servant, Fox, Vol.
3.383.
said unto him, I am sorry for thee; for truly the Parson will seek thy
destruction: Sir (said Alcock) I am sorry I am a trouble to you; as for my self
I am not sorry, but I do commit my self into Gods hands, and I trust he will
give me a mouth and wisdom to answer according to right. Yet (said Rolph) take
heed of him, he is a blood-sucker, etc. I fear not (said Alcock) he shall do no
more to me than God will give him leave; and happy shall I be, if God will call
me to dye for his Truths sake.

In his first Letter to Hadley he writes thus: O my Brethren of Hadley, why are
ye so soon turned from them, which called you into the Grace of Christ, to
another Doctrine? -- Though those should come unto you, that have been your
true Preachers, and preach another way of salvation, then by Jesus Christ's
death and passion, hold them accursed: yea, if it were an Angel came from
Heaven, and would tell you that the sacrifice of Christ's body upon the Cross
once for all, were not sufficient for all the sins of all those that shall be
saved, accursed be he. -- Why comes this plague upon us? Comes not this upon
thee, because thou have forsaken the Lord thy God? Thine own wickedness shall
reprove thee, and thy turning away shall condemn thee, that thou may know
how evil and hurtful a thing it is, that thou have forsaken the Lord thy God.

Algerius.
Pomponius Algerius, Fox, Vol. 2. page 181.
whilst he was a Prisoner at Venice, before he was burnt at Rome, writ thus in
his comfortable Letter to the Christians, departed out of Babylon into Mount
Sion. To mitigate your sorrow, which you take for me, I cannot but impart unto
you some portion of my joys, which I feel, to the intent you may rejoice with
me. -- I shall utter that, which scarce any will believe: I have found a nest
of honey, an honeycomb in the entrails of a Lion. In the deep dark Dungeon I
have found a Paradise of pleasure. In the place of sorrow and death,
tranquillity of hope and life: when others do weep, I do rejoice; when others do
shake and tremble, there I have found plenty of strength and boldness: in
strait bands, and cold irons I have had rest: Behold he that was once far from
me, now is present with me; whom once I could scarce feel, I now see most
apparently; whom once I saw afar off, now I behold near at hand, whom once I
hungered for, the same now approaches and reaches his hand unto me; he does
comfort me, and heapeth me up with gladness; he drives away all bitterness; he
ministers strength and courage, etc. -- O how easy and sweet is the Lords
yoke! Learn, ye well-beloved, how amiable the Lord is, how meek, and merciful,
who visits his servants in temptations; neither disdaineth he to keep company
with us in such vile and stinking Caves. Will the blind and incredulous world
(think you) believe this? or rather will it not say thus? No, thou will never
be able to abide long the burning heat, the pinching hardness of that place,
etc. The rebukes and frowning faces of great men how will thou suffer? Do not
thou consider thy pleasant Country, the Riches of the World, thy Kinsfolk, the
delicate pleasures and Honors of this life? Do thou forget the solace of thy
Sciences, and fruit of all thy Labors? Will thou thus lose all thy labors,
which thou have hitherto sustained? Finally, fear thou not death which
hangs over thee? O what a fool art thou, which for one words speaking may
salve all this and wilt not! But now to answer: Let this blind world hearken to
this again, What heat can there be more burning, then that fire which is
prepared for thee hereafter? What things more hard, and sharp, and crooked than
this present life which we lead? What thing more odious and hateful than this
world here present? And let these worldly men here answer me. What Country can
we have more sweet than the Heavenly Country above? What treasures more rich
or precious than everlasting life? and who be our Kinsmen but they which hear
the Word of God? Where be greater riches or dignities more honorable than in
Heaven? And as touching the Sciences, let this foolish world consider, Be not
they ordained to know God? whom unless we do know, all our labors, our
night-watchings, our studies, and all our enterprises here serve to no purpose,
all is but labor lost. Furthermore let the miserable worldly men answer me.
What remedy or safe refuge can there be unto him who lacks God, who is the life
and medicine of all men, and how can he be said to fly from death, when he
himself is already dead in sin? If Christ be the way, verity and life, how can
there be any life without Christ? The solely heat of the Prison to me is
coldness; the cold winter to me is a fresh spring in the Lord. He that fears
not to be burned in the fire, how will he fear the heat of weather? Or what
cares he for the pinching frost, which burns for the love of the Lord? The
place is sharp and tedious to them that be guilty, but to the innocent it is
mellifluous. Here droppeth the delectable dew, here flows the pleasant
Nectar; here runs the sweet milk, here is plenty of all good things. -- In
this world there is no mansion firm to me, and therefore I will travel up to
the New Jerusalem, which is in Heaven, and which offers it self to me without
paying any Fine or Income. -- I have traveled hitherto, labored, and sweat
early and late, watching day and night, and now my travels begin to come to
effect. -- What man can now cavil, that these our labors are lost, which have
followed and found out the Lord and Maker of the World, and which have changed
death with life? -- If to dye in the Lord be not to dye, but to live most
joyfully, where is this wretched worldly Rebel, which blames us of folly, for
giving away our lives unto death? O how delectable is this death to me! to
taste of the Lords Cup. -- I am accused of foolishness, for that I do not rid
my self out of these troubles, when with one word I may. But does not Christ
say, Fear not them which kill the body, but him which kills both body and
soul; and whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before
my Father which is in Heaven; and he that denies me before men, him will Falso
deny before my Heavenly Father. Seeing the words of the Lord be so plain, how,
or by what authority will this wise Counselor approve this his counsel which
he does give? God forbid that I should relinquish the commandments of God, and
follow the counsels of men; for it is written, Blessed is the man that has not
gone in the way of sinners, and has not stood in the counsel of the ungodly,
etc. Psalm. 1.1. God forbid I should deny Christ, where I ought to confess him;
I will not set more by my life, then by my soul; neither will I exchange the
life to come for this world here present. --

This Letter he underwrit thus;

Allen.
Sir Edmond Tyrrel bidding Rose Allen to give her Father and Mother good
counsel, Fox, Vol. 3. page 830.
that they might become good Catholics; Sir (said she) they have a better
Instructor than I, for the Holy Ghost does teach them, I hope, who I trust will
not suffer them to err. Thereupon the Knight said, It is time to look to such
Heretics. Sir (said she) with that which you call Heresy, do I worship my
Lord God. Then I perceive (said Tyrrel) you will burn with the rest for
company, No Sir (said she) not for company, but for my Christ's sake, if so I be
compelled, and I hope in his mercies if he call me to it, he will enable me to
bear it. To try her, Tyrrel burnt the wrist of her hand with a candle, till the
very sinews cracked asunder, saying often to her, What, whore, wilt not thou
cry? To which she answered, That she had no cause she thanked God, but rather
to rejoice; You (said she) have more cause to weep than I, if you consider the
matter well. At last she said, Sir, have you done what you will do? He
answering, yea, and if thou think it be not well, then mend it. She replied,
Mend it! Nay the Lord mend you, and give you repentance, if it be his will; and
now if you think it good to begin at the feet, and burn the head also. She
being asked by one, how she could abide the painful burning of her hand; She
said, at first it was some grief to her; but afterward the longer she burned,
the less she felt, even well near none at all.

a Cutler in Flanders, being conducted to Prison, said, Now you have taken me,
you think to deprive me of life, and thereby to bring great damage to me; but
you are deceived, for it is all one, as if you took counters from me to fill my
hand with a great sum of gold. As he went to suffer, he used that speech of the
Apostle St. Peter, I must now shortly put off this my earthly tabernacle, 2
Pet. 1.10. which the love of Jesus my Lord constrains me to do, 2 Cor. 5.14.

that which becomes an Eunuch, I will suffer that which becomes a Bishop.

Andrew.
When the Proconsul threatened Andrew the Apostle with the Cross, Fox, Vol. 1

if he left not off his preaching; I would never (said he) have preached the
Doctrine of the Cross, if I had feared the suffering of the Cross.

When he came to the Cross on which he was to be crucified, he said, O Cross
most welcome, and long looked for, with a willing mind joyfully I come to thee,
being the Scholar of him that did hang on thee; Ward, pa. 138.
welcome O Christ longed and looked for; I am the Scholar of him that was
crucified, long have I coveted to embrace thee, in whom I am what I am.

Apprice.
Bonner asking John Apprice what he thought of the Sacrament of the Altar; he
answered, Fox, Vol. 3. page 700.
The Doctrine you teach is so agreeable to the world, and embraced of the same,

John Ardley being urged by Bonner to recant, Fox, Vol. 3. page 253.
cried out, If every hair of my head were a man, I would suffer death for my
Religion.

Being again solicited to recant; No, God forbid (said he) that I should do
so, for then I shall lose my soul.

Arethusius.
Marcus Arethusius having at the command of Constantinus pulled down a certain
Temple, Fox, Vol 1. page 128.
dedicated to Idols, and instead thereof built up a Church, where the
Christians might congregate; under Julianus he was beaten, cast into a filthy
sink, put into a basket anointed with honey and broth, hung abroad in the heat
of the Sun, as meat for Wasps to feed on, hereby it was hoped he would be
enforced either to build up again the Temple which he had destroyed, or else
give so much money as would pay for the building of the same. This good man
whilst he hung in the basket, did not only conceal his pains, but derided
those wicked instruments of his torments, calling them base, low, terrene
people, and himself exalted, and set on high, when they told him they would be
contented with a small sum of money from him: He said, It is as great a
wickedness to confer one halfpenny in case of impiety, as if a man should
bestow the whole.

Askew.
Mrs. Jane Askew being called by the Bishop of Winchester, a Parrot, told him,
that she was ready to suffer not only his rebukes, but all things that should
follow besides; yea, and all that gladly.

To her Confession in Newgate she thus subscribed; Written by me Jane Askew,
who neither wish death, nor fear its might, and as merry as one bound toward
Heaven.

In her Confession of her Faith she says, Though God has given me the bread
of adversity, and the waters of trouble, yet not so much as my sins have
deserved.

When Nicholas Sharton counseled her to recant, as he had done, she said, It
had been good for him never to have been born.

In an Answer to a Letter of Mr. Lacell's, she writ thus; O Friend, most dearly
beloved in God, I marvail not a little what should move you to judge in me so
slendar a faith as to fear death, which is the end of all misery. In the Lord I
desire you not to believe of me such weakness, for I doubt not but God will
perform his work in me, like as he has begun.

When Wrisley Lord Chancellor sent to her Letters at the Stake, offering her
the Kings pardon, if she would recant; she refusing once to look upon them,
gave this answer: That she came not thither to deny her Lord and Master.

Attalus.
He answered to every question, Ward, pa. 240.
I am a Christian. Being fired in an iron Chain; Behold (said he) O you Romans,
this is to eat man's flesh, which you falsely object to us Christians.

Audebert.
Blessed be God (said Anne Audebert of Orleance) for this Wedding Girdle
(meaning the Chain) my first marriage was on this Lords Day, Ward, pa. 154.
and now my second to my Spouse and Lord Christ shall be on the same.

Augustine.
Boughs fall off trees (said he) and stones out of buildings, Ward, pa. 140.
and why should it seem strange that mortal men dye?

Austine.
Austine a Barbar, Fox, Vol. 2. page 124.
born about Hennegow in Germany, as he was led to execution, being desired by a
Gentleman to have pity upon himself, and if he would not favor his life, yet
that he would favor his own soul: He answered, What care I have of my soul,
you may see by this; that I had rather give my body to be burned, than to do
that thing that were against my conscience.

B
Babilas.
Babilas Bishop of Anti^ch, St. Chrysostom. cont. Gentiles.
being cast by Decius into a filthy stinking Prison for the name of Christ,
with as many irons as he could bear, entreated his Friends (that visited him)
that after his death they would bury with him the signs and tokens of his
valor, meaning his bolts and fetters.

Now (said he) will God wipe away all tears, Ward, page 141.
and now I shall walk with God in the land of the living.

Bainham.
Mr. James Bainham, Fox, Vol 2. page 300.
when he repented of his Recantation in Austin's Church in London, He declared
openly with weeping eyes, that he had denied God, and prayed all the people to
beware of his weakness, and not to do as he did; For (said he) If I should not
return again unto the truth, this Word of God (he having a New Testament in his
hand) would damn me both body and soul at the Day of Judgment. He persuaded
them to die by and by, rather than to do as he did; for he would not feel such
an hell again for all the worlds good.

When he was at the Stake in the midst of the flaming fire, which had half
consumed his Arms and Legs, he spoke these words; O ye Papists, Behold, ye look
for miracles, and here now you may see a miracle; for in this fire I feel no
more pain, than if I were in a Bed of Down, it is to me as a Bed of Roses.

Barbevil.
John Barbevil said to the Friars that called him ignorant Ass; Ward, page 162.
Well, Admit I were so, yet shall my blood witness against such Balaams as you
be.

Bale.
Mr. John Bale in his excellent Paraphrase in Apocalypse. See the image of both
Churches printed 1550.


In his Preface -- He that will live godly in Christ Jesus, and be a patient
sufferer; he that will stand in Gods fear, and prepare himself to temptation;
he that will be strong when adversity shall come, and avoid all assaults of
Antichrist and the Devil, let him give himself wholly to the study of this
prophecy -- He that knows not this Book, knows not what the Church is,
whereof he is a member. -- It contains the universal troubles, persecutions
and crosses, that the Church suffered in the Primitive Spring, what it
suffers now, and what it shall suffer in the later Times, by the subtilties
of Antichrist and his Followers, the cruel Members of Satan; and it manifests
what Promises, what Crowns, and what Glory the said Congregation shall have,
after this present Conflict with the Enemies, that the promised Rewards might
quicken the hearts of those that the Torments fears. -- Unto St. John were
these Mysteries revealed, when he was by the Emperor Domitianus exiled for his
Preaching, into the Isle of Patmos, at the cruel Complaints of the Idolatrous
Priests and Bishops, and by him writ and sent out of the same exile into the
Congregations. -- The Contents of this Book are from no place more freely and
clearly opened, nor told forth more boldly, than out of exile. -- Flattery
dwel^ing at home, and sucking there still his Mothers breasts, may never tell
out the truth, he sees so many dangers on every side, as displeasure of
Friends, decay of Name, loss of Goods, offense of Great men, and jeopardy of
Life, etc. The forsaken wretched sort has the Lord provided always to rebuke
the world of sin, hypocrisy, blindness; for naught is it therefore that he
has exiled a certain number of believing Brethren the Realms of England, of
the which afflicted Family my faith is that I am one. Whereupon In have
considered it is no less my bounden ^^uty, under pain of damnation, to admonish
Christ's flock by this present Revelation of their perils past, and dangers to
come for contempt of ^he Gospel, which now reigns there above all (...) the
Clergy. -- Graciously has the Lord cal^ed them, especially now of late, but
his voice is nothing regarded. His Servants have they impri^ned, tormented, and
slain, having his Verity in much more contempt then before. We looked for a
time of peace, (says the Prophet Jeremiah) and we fare not the better at all;
we waited for a time of health, and we find here nothing else but trouble. And
no marvel, considering the Beasts head that was wounded, is now healed up again
so workmanly, as Rev. 13. mentions. The abominable hypocrisy, idolatry,
pride, and filthiness of those terrible termagaunts of Antichrists holy
household, those two-horned Whoremongers, those Conjurers of Egypt, and
lecherous Locusts, leaping out of the bottomless P^t, which daily deceive the
ignorant multitude with their Sorceries and Charms, must be showed to the World
to their utter shame and confusion. -- To tell them freely of their wicked
works by the Scriptures, I have exiled my self for ever from mine own native
Country, Kindred, Friends, Acquaintance, (which are the great delights of this
life) and am well contented for the sake of Christ, and for the comfort of my
Brethren there, to suffer poverty, penury, abjection, reproof, and all that
shall come beside. -- Here are we admonished beforehand of two most dangerous
evils; neither to agree with those Tyrants, that wage war with the Lamb in his
elect Members, nor yet to obey those deceitful Bishops, tha^ in hypocrisy
usurp the Churches Titles. -- O those has our heavenly Lord premonished us in
this heavenly work of his, and graciously called us away from their
abominations, lest we should be partakers of their sins, and so receive of
their plagues. If we unthankfully neglect it, the greate^ is our danger. --

Barlaam.
He holding his hand in the flame over the Altar, Fox, Vol. 1 page 118. Ward,
page 141.
sung that of the Psalmist, Thou teach my hands to war, and my fingers to
fight.

I have been reported (said Dr. Fox, Vol. 2 page 527.
Barnes at the Stake) to be a Preacher of Sedition, and disobedient to the
Kings Majesty; but here I say to you, that you are all bound by the command of
God, to obey your Prince with all humility, and with all your heart; and that
not only for fear of the sword, but also for conscience sake before God: Yea,
I say further, If the King should command you any thing against Gods Law, if it
be in your power to re^ist him, yet may you not do it.

Basil.
When Valens the Emperor sent his Officers to him, seeking to turn him from
the Faith: Buroughs in Moses Self-denial, pa. 117.
And first of all great preferments were offered him; Basil rejected them with
scorn: Offer these things (said he) to Children. When he was afterward
threatened grievously; Threaten (said he) your Purple Gallants, that give
themselves to their pleasures.

When the Emperors Messenger promised him great preferment, Alas, Sir, Clarks
Lives, Part 1. page 101.
(said this Bishop of Caesarea) these speeches are fit to catch little
Children, that look after such things; but we that are taught and nourished by
the holy Scriptures, are ready to suffer a thousand deaths, rather than to
suffer one syllable or tittle of the Scripture to be altered.

When the Emperor threatened to banish him, Leighs Saints Encouragements in
evil times, page 9.
etc. if he obeyed not, he said, Those Bag-bears were to be propounded to
Children; but for his part, though they might take away his life, yet they
could not hinder him from professing the Truth.

When Modestus the Prefect asked him, Clark, and page 101.
Know you not who we are that command it? No body (said Basil) whilst you
command such things. Know ye not (said the Prefect) that we have Honors to
bestow upon you? They are but changeable (said Basil) like your selves.
Hereupon he threatened to confiscate his Goods, to torment him, to banish him,
or kill him; he answered, He need not fear confiscation, that had nothing to
lose; nor banishment, to whom Heaven only is a Country; nor torments, when
his body would be dashed with one blow; nor death; which is the only way to
set him at liberty. The Prefect telling him he was Mad, he said, Opto me in
aeternum sic delirare, I wish I may for ever be thus Mad. The Prefect another
time threatening him with death, he said, Would it would fall out so well on my
side, that I might lay down this carcass of mine in the quarrel of Christ, and
in the defense of his Truth, who is my Head and Captain.

The Prefect desiring that he would not, by rashly answering, throw himself
away, offered him a day and night to consider further of it; but Basil said, I
have no need to take further counsel about this matter: Look what I am to day,
the same thou shall find me to morrow; but I pray God that thou change not thy
mind.

Benden.
Alice Benden, For, Vol. 3. page 796.
when she was in Prison at Canterbury, agreed with a fellow Prisoner to live
both of them with two pence half penny a day, to try thereby how well they
could sustain penury and hunger before they were put to it.

At her first coming into the Bishops Prison, she was much troubled, and
expostulated why her Lord did suffer her to be sequestered from her loving
Fellows in so extreme misery? But was comforted by these words, Why art thou so
heavy, O my soul? The right hand of the Lord can change all.

At the stake she took forth a shilling of Philip and Mary, which her father
had bowed, and sent her when she was first in Prison, desiring her Brother
there present, to return the same to her Father again, that he might understand
she never lacked money whilst she lay in Prison.

Bennet.
Mr. Thomas Bennet, a Schoolmaster in Exceter, For, Vol. 2. 314.
being pressed by a Doctor, a Gray Friar, to recant for putting upon the doors
of the Cathedral in Schedules, That the Pope is Antichrist, and that we ought
to worship God only, and not the Saints, said, I take God to record, my life
is not dear to me, I am weary of it, seeing your detestable doings, to the
utter destruction of Gods flock, so that I desire death, that I may no longer
be partaker of your detestable idolatries and superstitions, or be subject unto
Antichrist your Pope. -- Away from me I pray you, vex my soul no longer, ye
shall not prevail. -- If I should hear and follow you this day, everlasting
death should hang over me, a just reward for them that prefer the life of this
world before life eternal.

Berger.
Peter Berger, burnt at Lions 1553. Fox, Vol. 2. page 140.

Laborers, I see the heavens open to receive me.

Betken.
When she was brought to the Rack, she said, Fox, Vol. 3. Suppl. p. 49
My Masters, wherefore will you put me to this torture, seeing I have no way
offended you? Is it for my Faith's sake? you need not torment me for that, for
as I was never ashamed to make confession thereof, no more will I be now at
this present before you, I will freely show you my mind therein. But for all
this when they proceeded on with what they intended, Alas my Masters, said she,
If it be so that I must suffer this pain, then give me leave first to call upon
God. Her request they granted: whilst she was praying, one of the Commissioners
was so surprised with fear and terror, that by and by he swouned, and could
not be fetched again, and so she escaped the torture.

Bilney.
Mr. Fox, Vol. 2 page 268.
Thomas Bilney in a Letter to Dr. Tonstal Bishop of London, he gives this
account of his conversion. -- The woman which was twelve years vexed with the
bloody Flux, had consumed all that she had upon Physicians, and yet was still
worse and worse, until such time as she came to Christ, and after she had once
touched the hem of his vesture, through faith she was healed. O mighty power of
the most High! which I also most miserable sinner have often tasted and felt.
Before I came to Christ I had likewise spent all I had upon ignorant
Physicians. -- They appointed me Fastings, Watchings, buying of Pardons, and
Masses, etc. But at last I heard speak of Jesus, even then, when the New
Testament was first set out by Erasmus. At first I was allured to read, rather
for the Latin (having heard it was eloquently done) than for the Word of God.
At the first reading I hit upon this sentence of Sr. Paul, (O most sweet and
comfortable sentence to my soul) in 1 Timothy 1. It is a true saying, and worthy
of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of
whom I am chief. This sentence through Gods instruction and inward working, did
so exhilarate my heart, being before wounded with the guilt of my sins,
insomuch that my bruised bones leapt for joy. after this the Scripture began to
be more pleasant to me then the honey or the honeycomb. Therein I learned that
all my Travels, all my Fasting and Watching, all the redemption of Masses and
Pardons, without faith in Christ, were but a hasty and swift running out of the
right way, or else much like the vesture made of Fig Leaves, wherewithal Adam
and Eve went about in vain to cover their nakedness, and could never obtain
quietness and rest, till they believed in the promise of God, that Christ the
seed of the Woman should break the Serpents head. Neither could I be relieved
or eased of the sharp stingings of my sins, before I was taught of God, that
even as Moses exalted the serpent in the Desert, so shall the Son of man be
exalted, that all which believe on him, should not perish, but have everlasting
life. As soon as I began to taste and savor this heavenly Lesson, which none
can teach but God only, I desired the Lord to increase my faith. And at last I
desired nothing more, then that I being so comforted by him, might be
strengthened by his holy Spirit and grace from above, to teach the wicked his
ways, which are mercy and truth, that the wicked may be converted unto him by
me, who sometimes was also wicked. -- Accordingly I did teach, and set forth
Christ, being made for us by God his Faher, our Wisdom, Righteousness,
Sanctification and Redemption, 1 Cor. 1. Who was made sin for us, i.e. a
Sacrifice for sin, that we through him should be made the righteousness of God,
2 Cor. 5. Who became accursed for us, to redeem us from the curse of the Law,
Gal. 2. -- I taught that all men should first acknowledge their sins, and
condemn them, ^fterward hunger and thirst for that righteousness, which is by
faith in Christ, etc. Romans 3. And forasmuch as this hunger and thrist was wont
to be quenched with the fullness of man's righteousness. -- Therefore oftentimes
have I spoken of those works, exhorting all men not so to cleave to them, as
they being satisfied therewith, should loath or wax weary of Christ. For those
things I have been cried out of, attached, and now cast into prison.

His abjuration cost him dear, Pa. 271.
it brought him even to despair, his Friends were fain to be with him night and
day.

Bishop Latimer says, That he thought all the Word of God was against him, and
sounded his condemnation: To bring any comfortable Scripture to him, was as
though a man should run him through with a sword.

The day before his Execution, Pa. 277.
some Friends finding him eating heartily, with much cheerfulness, and a quiet
mind, they said, They were glad to see him at that time so heartily to refresh
himself: O (said he) I imitate those, who having a ruinous house to dwell in,
yet bestow cost, as long as they may, to hold it up.

In Prison he diverse times proved the fire, Leigh 's Saints Encouragements in
evil times. p. 27.
by putting his finger near to the candle; at the first touch of the candle his
flesh resisting, and he withdrawing his finger, did after chide his flesh in
these words; Quid unius membri inustionem far non potes, and quo pacto cras
totius corporis conflagrationem tolerabis? What (said he) can thou not bear
the burning of one member, and how will thou endure to morrow the burning of
thy whole body?

I seel, Fox, Vol. 2. page 277.
and have known it long by Philosophy, that fire is hot; yet I know some
(recorded in Gods Word) even in the flame felt no heat, and (...) believe that
though my body will be wasted by it, my soul shall be purged thereby.

At the same time he most comfortably treated among his Friends, of Isa. 43.1,
2, 3. But now, thus says the Lord, that created thee, O Jacob, and he that
formed thee, O Israel; Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee
by thy Name. Thou art mine when thou passest through the waters, I will be with
thee, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walk
through the fire thou shall not be burnt, for I am the Lord thy God, the Holy
one of Israel, thy Savior. The comfort whereof never left some of his Friends
to their dying day.

The next morning the Officers fetching him to Execution, a certain Friend
entreated him to be constant, and to take his death patiently; Bilney answered,
I am sailing with the Mariner through a boisterous sea, but shortly shall be in
the Haven, etc. Help me with your Prayers.

Bland.
Mr. John Bland a Kentish Minister, Fox, Vol. 3. page 373.
in his Prayer at the stake. -- Lord Jesus, for thy love I do willingly leave
this life, and desire rather the bitter death of thy Cross, with the loss of
all earthly things, than to abide the blasphemy of thy Holy Name, or else to
obey man in the breaking of thy Command. -- This death is more dear unto me
than thousands of gold and silver. Such love, O Lord, have thou laid up in my
breast, that I hunger for thee, as the Deer wounded desires the soil.

Blehere.
Levine Blehere said to his Friends, Ward, page 160.
offering to rescue him by tumult; Hinder not the Magistrates work, nor my
happiness. Father, thou soresawest the sacrifice from eternity, now accept of
it I pray thee.

Bongeor.
Agnes Bongeor, Fox, Vol. 3. page 849.
having prepared her self to go with her Fellow-martyrs to the stake, putting
on a Smock made for that purpose, and sending away her sucking infant to a
Nurse, through a mistake of her Name in the Writ ( Bowyer being put for
Bongeor) was kept back. Hereupon she made piteous moan, wept bitterly, etc.
Because she went not with them to give her life in defense of her Christ, of
all things in the world, life was least looked for by her. In this perplexity a
Friend came to her, and put her in mind of Abraham's offering up Isaac. I know
(quoth she) that Abraham's will before God was accepted for the deed, in that
he would have done it, if the Angel of the Lord had not stayed him; but I am
unhappy, the Lord thinks not me worthy of this dignity; and yet I would have
gone with my company with all my heart; and because I did it not, it is now my
chief and greatest grief. She was grieved because she had not offered her self
(though she had given away her child) which was more than Abraham was put to.)

Bossu.
Francis le Bossu, Fox. Vol. 3. cons. p. 68.
a French Martyr, to encourage his children to suffer martyrdom with himself,
he thus spoke unto them; Children, we are not now to learn, that it has
always been the portion of Believers to be hated, cruelly used, and devoured
by Unbelievers, as sheep of ravening wolves; if we suffer with Christ, we shall
also reign with him. Let not these drawn swords terrify us, they will be but
as a Bridge, whereby we shall pass over out of a miserable life into immortal
blessedness. We have breathed, and lived long enough among the wicked; let us
now go, and live with our God. He and his two Sons were killed, embracing each
other, in the Massacre at Lions in France, 1572.

Bradford.
Mr. John Bradford, Fox, Vol. 3. p. 281, 282.
the night before he was carried to Newgate, he dreamt that Chains were brought
for him to the Counter, and that the day following he should be carried to
Newgate, and that the next day he should be burnt in Smithfield; which
accordingly came to pass.

Being asked what he should do, and whither he would go, if he should have his
liberty; he said, He cared not whether he want out, or no; but if he did, he
would marry and abide still in England secretly, teaching the people as the
time would suffer him.

When the Keepers Wife told him the sad News (as she called it) of the nearness
of his death, being to be burned the next day, he put off his Cap, and lifting
up his eyes to Heaven, said, I thank God for it, I have looked for the same a
long time, and therefore it comes not now to me suddenly, but as a thing
waited for every day and hour; the Lord make me worthy thereof.

Creswell offering to labor for him, Pa. 292.
and desiring to know what suit he should make for him, What you will do (said
he) do it not at my request, for I desire nothing at your hands. If the Queen
will give me life, I will thank her; if she will banish me, I will thank her;
if she will burn me, I will thank her; if she will condemn me to perpetual
imprisonment, I will thank her.

The Chancellor pressing him to do as they had done, in hopes of the Queens
mercy and pardon; Pa. 283.
My Lord (said he) I desire mercy with Gods mercy, ( i. e. without doing or
saying any thing against God and his Truth, page 290.) but mercy with Gods
wrath God keep me from. -- Gods mercy I desire, and also would be glad of the
Queens favor, to live as a Subject without clog on Conscience: but otherwise
the Lords mercy is better to me than life. -- Life in his displeasure is worse
than death, and death with his favor is true life. He having refused again and
again to answer to the Chancellors Quaeries, Pa. 286.
said, That no fear, but the fear of perjury made him unwilling to answer (he
having been six times sworn not to consent to the practicing of any
Jurisdiction, or any Authority on the Bishop of Rome's behalf, within the Realm
of England) I am not afraid of death, I thank God, I look and have looked for
nothing else from your hands a long time; but I am afraid when death comes, I
should have matter to trouble my Conscience by the guilt of perjury. As for my
death, as I know there are twelve hours in the day, so with the Lord my time is
appointed; and when it shall be his good time, then I shall depart hence; but
in the mean season I am safe enough, though all the people had sworn my death;
into his hands have I committed it, and do, his good will be done.

The Earl of Derby lending one of his Servants to him, Pa. 292.
willing him to tender himself, He told the Messenger, that he thanked his
Lordship for his good will toward him, but in this case I cannot tender my
self more than Gods honor.

The same Servant saying also, Ah Mr. Bradford, consider your Mother, Sister,
Friends, Kinsfolk, Country, what a great discomfort it will be to them to see
you dye as an Heretic. Mr. Bradford replied, I have learned to forsake Father,
Mother, Brother, Sister, Friends, and all that ever I have, yea and my own
self, for else I cannot be Christ's Disciple.

Being asked by a good Gentlewomans Servant, Pa. 305.
that was sent to him, How de did? he answered, Well, I thank God: for as men
in Sailing, which be near to the Shore or Haven where they would be, would be
nearer, even so the nearer I am to God, the nearer I would be.

In a Letter to his Mother and Brethren. Pa. 308.
-- I am at this time in Prison sure enough from starting to confirm that I
have preached unto you: As I am ready (I thank God) with my life and blood to
seal the same, if God vouchsafe me worthy of that honor. -- If we suffer with
him, we shall also reign with him. Be not therefore faint-hearted, but rather
rejoice, at the least for my sake, who now am in the right and high way to
Heaven; for by many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God. Now will
God make known his Children. When the wind does not blow, the Wheat cannot be
known from the Chafe; but when the blast comes, then flies away the Chafe,
but the Wheat remains, and is so far from being hurt, that by the wind it is
more cleansed from the Chafe. Gold when it is cast into the fire is the more
precious, so are Gods Children by afflictions. -- Indeed I thank God more for
this Prison, than for any Parlour, yea than for any pleasure that ever I had:
for in it I find God my most sweet good God always. -- Of all deaths it is
most to be desired to dye for Gods sake: such are sure to go to Heaven. --
Death, nor Life, nor Prison, nor Pleasure, I trust in God, shall be able to
separate me from my Lord God and his Gospel. -- Rejoice in my sufferings, for
it is for your sakes, to confirm the truth I have taught. -- Howsoever you do,
be obedient to the Higher Powers, that is, in no point either in hand or tongue
Rebel; but rather if they command that which with good conscience you cannot
obey, lay your head on the Block, and suffer what they shall do, or say. By
patience possess your souls.

In his Letter to the City of London. Pa. 310.
-- I ask God heartily mercy, that I do no more rejoice, than I do, having so
great cause, as to be an instrument, wherein it may please my dear Lord, and
Savior to suffer. -- Although my sins be manifold and grievous, yet the
Bishops and Prelates do not persecute them in me, but Christ himself, his Word,
his Truth, and Religion. -- Let the anger and plagues of God most justly fallen
upon us, be applied to every one of our deserts, that from the bottom of our
hearts every one of us may say, It is I Lord, that have sinned against thee: It
is my hypocrisy, my vainglory, my covetousness, uncleanness, carnality,
security, idleness, unthankfulness, self-love, etc. which have deserved the
taking away of thy Word and true Religion, of thy good Ministers by Exile,
Imprisonment, Death, etc. -- Prepare your selves to the Cross, be obedient to
all that be in Authority in all things, that be not against God, his Word; for
then answer with the Apostle, It is more meet to obey God, than man. Howbeit
never for any thing resist, or rise against the Magistrates. A venge not your
selves. Commit your Cause to the Lord. If you feel in your selves an hope and
trust in God, that he will never tempt you above that he will make you able to
bear, be assured the Lord will be true to you, and you shall be able to bear
all brunts: but if you want this Hope, flee and get you hence, rather than by
your tarrying Gods Name should be dishonored.

In his Letter to Cambridge. Pa. 312.
-- Thou my Mother, the University, have not only had the truth of Gods Word
plainly manifested unto thee by Reading, Disputing, and Preaching publicly and
privately, but now to make thee altogether excuseless, and as it were almost to
sin against the Holy Ghost, if thou put to thy helping hand with the Romish
Rout to suppress the Verity, and set out the contrary, thou have my life and
blood, as a Seal to confirm thee, if thou will be confirmed, or else to
confound thee, if thou will take part with the Prelates and Clergy, which now
fill up the measure of their Fathers, which flew the Prophets and Apostles,
that all the righteous blood from Abel to Bradford may be required at their
hands. -- For the tender mercy of Christ in his bowels and blood I beseech you
to take Christ's eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see what you do,
and have done in admitting the Romish rotten Rags, which once you utterly
expelled. O be not the Dog returned to his vomit; be not the Sow that was
washed, returning to her wallowing in the mire. Beware least Satan enter in
with seven worse Spirits, etc. It had been better you had never known the
truth, than after knowledge to have run from it. Ah! woe to this world, and the
things therein, which has now so wrought with you. Oh that ever this Dirt of
the Devil should daub up the eye of the Realm! -- What is man whose breath is
in his nostrils, that thou should thus be afraid of him? -- Do not thou
know Rome to be Babylon? Do not thou know, that as the old Babylon had the
children of Judah in captivity, so has Rome the true Judah, i.e. the
Confessors of Christ? Do not thou know, that as destruction happened unto it,
so shall it do unto this? Do not thou know that God will deliver his people
now, when the time is come as he did then? Has not God commanded his people to
come out of her? and will thou give example to the whole Realm to run unto her?
Have thou forgotten the woe that Christ threatens to offence-givers? Wilt not
thou remember that it were better that a Millstone were hanged about thy neck,
and thou thrown into the Sea, than that thou should offend the little ones?
Dear Mother, Receive some admonition of one of thy poor children, now going to
be burned for the testimony of Jesus; Come again to Gods truth, come out of
Babylon, confess Christ and his true Doctrine, repent that which is past, etc.
Remember the readings, etc. of Gods Prophet Bucer, Call to mind the threatenings
of God (now somewhat seen) by thy children, Leaver, and others. Let the exile
of Leaver, Pilkinton, Grindal, Haddon, Horn, Scory, Ponet, etc. something awake
thee. Consider the martyrdom of thy Chickens, Rogers, Saunders, Tailor. And now
cast not away the poor admonition of me, going to be burned also, and to
receive the like Crown of Glory with my fellows. -- Even now the Axe is laid to
the Root.

In his Letter to Lancashire and Cheshire, Pa. 313.
etc. -- Indeed if I should simply consider my life, with that which it ought
to have been, and as God in his Law requires, then could I not but cry, as I
do, Righteous art thou, O Lord, etc. But when I consider the cause of my
condemnation, I cannot but lament, that I do no more rejoice; for it is Gods
truth. So that the condemnation is not a condemnation of Bradford simply, but
rather a condemnation of Christ and his Truth. Bradford is nothing else, but an
instrument in whom Christ and his Doctrine is condemned. And therefore, my
dearly beloved, rejoice, rejoice, and give thanks with me, and for me, that
ever God did vouchsafe ^o great a benefit to our Country, as to choose the
most unworthy (I mean my self) to be one, in whom it pleases him to suffer. --
Forget not how that the Lord has showed himself true, and me his true
Preacher, by bringing to pass these plagues, which at my mouth you often heard
before. -- My blood will cry for vengeance, as against the Papists, Gods
enemies, etc. so against you, if ^e repent not, amend not, and turn not unto
the lord.

In his Letter to the Town of Walden. Pa. 316.
-- What ^an you desire more, to assure your Consciences of the Verity taught
by your Preachers, than their ^wn lives? Waver not therefore in Christ's
Reli^ion truly taught you. Never shall the enemies be ^ble to burn it, and
imprison it, and keep it in ^onds, though they may imprison and burn us. -- I
humbly beseech you, and pray you in the ^owels and blood of Jesus, now I am
going to ^eath for the testimony of Jesus, love the Lords truth, love (I say)
to love it, and to frame your ^ves thereafter. Alas! you know the cause of all
these plagues fallen upon us, and of the success, which Gods adversaries have
daily, is for our not ^ving Gods Word. You know how that we were ^ut Gospellers
in lips, and not in life. -- Remember that before ye learned A.B.C. your Lesson
was Christ's Cross. Forget not that Christ will have no ^isciples, but such as
will promise to deny themselves, and to take up their Cross (mark that, take
(...) up) and follow him, and not the multitude, cu^ome, etc. -- Loath would I
be a witness against ^ou at the last day, as of truth I must be, if ye repent
not, if ye love not Christ's Gospel.

In his Letter to B. C. -- The world seems to have the upper hand, Pa. 317.
the Truth seems to be oppressed, and they which take part therewith are
unjustly entreated. The cause of all this is Gods anger and mercy: His anger,
because we have grievously sinned against him, we have been unthankful for his
Word, etc. we have been so carnal, covetous, licentious, etc. that of his
Justice h^ could no longer forbear, but make us feel his anger, etc. His mercy
is seen in this, that God does vouchsafe to punish us in this present life. If
he should not have punished us, Do not you think we should have continued in
the evils we were in (...) Yes verily, we should have been worse. -- The way to
Heaven is not the wide way of the world (...) but it is a strait way, which few
walk in; for few live Godly in Christ, few regard the Life to come, few
remember the day of Judgment, few remember how Christ will deny them before his
Father, that do deny him here, few consider that Christ will be ashamed of them
in the last day, which are ashamed of his Truth and true Service, few ca^^ up
their accounts, what will be laid to their charge in the day of vengeance, few
regard the condemnation of their own consciences, in doing that which they
inwardly disallow, few love God better that their goods. -- Of this I would
that ye were all certain, that all the hairs of your heads are numberless, so
that not one of them shall perish, neither shall man or Devil be able to
attempt any thing, much less do any thing to you before you heavenly Father,
which loves you most tenderly shall give them leave; they shall go no farther
the^ he will, nor keep you any longer in trouble th^^ he will. Therefore cast
on him all your care, for he is careful for you. Only study to please him, and
to keep your consciences clean, and your bodies pure from the idolatrous
service, which now every where is used, and God will marvellously and
mercifully defend and comfort you.

In his Letter to Erkinald Rawlins and his wife. Pa. 318.
-- First we have cause to rejoice for these days, because our Father
suffers us not to lie in Jezabel's bed, steeping in our sins and security,
but as mindful of us, does correct us as his children. -- Secondly, because
they are days of trial, wherein not only ye your selves, but also the world
shall know, that ye be none of his, but the Lords Darlings, whom we obey, his
servants we are. Now it is seen whether we obey the world or God. -- But the
trials of these days ye are occasioned more to repent, more to pray, more to
contemn this world, more to desire life everlasting, more to be holy, for holy
is the end; wherefore God does afflict us, and so to come to Gods company.

In his Letter to Mr. Laurence Saunders. Pa. 320.
-- A Friend having moved the Prisoners to subscribe to the Papists Articles,
with this condition, so far as they are not against Gods word. Dr. Tailor, and
Mr. Philp^t think the salt sent by our Friend is unseasonable; for my own part,
I pray God in no case I may seek my self, and indeed (I thank God) I purpose it
not.

In another Letter. -- This will be offensive; Pa. 321.
therefore let us Vadere plane, and so sane. I mean let us all confess we are
no changlings, but re ipsa are the same we were in Religion; and therefore
cannot subscribe, except we will dissemble both with God, with our selves, and
with the world.

In his Letter to Dr. Cranmer, Dr. Ridley, and Dr. Latimer. -- Our dear brother
Rogers has broken the Ice valiantly; this day (I think) or to morrow at the
uttermost, hearty Hooper, sincere Saunders, and trusty Tailor end their course,
and receive their Crown. The next am I, who hourly look for the Porter to open
me the Gates after them to enter into the desired Rest. God forgive me mine
unthankfulness for this exceeding great mercy. For though I justly suffer (for
I have been a great Hypocrite, etc. The Lord pardon me, yea he has done it, he
has done it indeed) yet what evil has he done? Christ, whom the Prelates
persecute, his truth, which they hate in me, has done no evil, nor deserved
death. -- O what am I Lord, that tho^ should thus magnify me? Is this thy
wont, to send for such a wretched Hypocrite in a fiery chariot, as thou did
for Elias?

In his Letter to the Lord Russel. Pa. 322.
-- Faith is reckoned, and worthily among the greatest gifts of God, by it, as
we are justified, and made Gods children; so are we Temples and Possessors of
the Holy Spirit, yea of Christ also, Ephesians. 4. And of the Father himself, John
14. By faith we drive the Devil away, 2 Pet. 5. We overcome the world, 1 John
5. And are already Citizens of Heaven, etc. Yet the Apostle does match even
with faith, yea, as it were prefer suffering Persecution for Christ's sake,
Phil. 1. -- Though the wisdom of the world think of the Cross according to
sense, and therefore flies from it, as from a most great ignominy and shame;
yet Gods Scholars have learned to think otherwise of the Cross, as the
Frame-house wherein God frames his Children like to his Son Christ, the
Furnace that fineth Gods gold, the Highway to Heaven, the Suit and Livery of
Gods servants, the earnest and beginning of all consolation and glory.

In his Meditation on the Commandments. Page 93, 94.
-- As the first Command teaches me as well that thou art my God, as what God
thou art; therefore of equity I should have no other Gods but thee, that is, I
should only hang on thee, trust in thee, serve thee, call on thee, obey thee,
and be thankful to thee; so because thou did reveal thy self visibly, that
thou might visibly be worshipped. The second Commandment is concerning thy
Worship, that in no point I should follow in worshipping thee the device or
intent of any man, Saint, Angel, or Spirit, but should take all such as
idolatry, and image-service, be it never so glorious. And why? forsooth because
thou would I should worship thee as thou have appointed by thy Word; for if
service be acceptable it must be according to the Will of him, to whom it is
done, and not of him who does it, etc. So that the meaning of this Precept is,
that as in the first I should have none other Gods but thee, so I should have
no worship of thee, Pa. 19^.
but such as thou appointest -- And therefore utterly abandon mine own will and
reason, all the reasons and good intents of man, and wholly give my self to
serve thee after thy will and word. Page 98, 99.
-- Thou bidst me not to take thy Name in vain, as by temerarious, or vain
swearing, etc. So by denying thy truth and word, or concealing it, when
occasion is offered to promote thy glory, and confirm thy truth. By reason
whereof I may well see, that thou would have me to use my tongue in humble
confessing thee, and thy word, Pa. 113, 114. This was his Meditation in Q.
Marie's time.
and truth after my Vocation, etc. -- Thy Ministers I pray not for, thy Church
I am not careful for, no not now (good Lord) when wicked Doctrine most
prevails, Idolatry, Superstition, and Abomination abound, the Sacraments,
etc. blasphemously corrupted, etc. all which my wickedness brought in, my
profaning of the fourth Commandment, and my not praying. Thy Ministers are in
Prison, dispersed in other Countries, spoiled, burnt, murdered, many fall (for
fear of goods, life, name, etc.) from the truth they have received to most
manifest idolatry, false Preachers abound among the people, thy people dearly
bought, even with thy blood, are not fed with the bread of thy. Word, but with
swillings and drink for swine. Antichrist wholly prevails, and yet for all
this also I am too careless, nothing lamenting my sins, which have been the
cause of all this. -- Help thy Church, cherish it, Pa. 115, 116.
and give it harbor here and elsewhere for Christ's sake. Purge the Ministry
from corruption, and false Ministers. Send out Preachers to feed thy people.
Destroy Antichrist and all his Kingdom. Give to such as be fallen from thy
truth, repentance. Keep others from falling, and by their falling do thou the
more confirm us. Confirm thy Ministers and poor people in Prison and Exile.
Strengthen them in thy truth. Deliver them if it be thy good will. Give them
that with conscience they may so answer their Adversaries, that thy servants
may rejoice, and thy Adversaries be confounded. Avenge thou thy own cause (O
thou God of Hosts) Help all thy people, and me especially, Pa. 146, 147.
because I have most need. -- Set my heart strait in case of Religion, to
acknowledge thee one God, to worship none other God, to reverence thy Name, and
keep thy Sabbaths. Set my heart right in matters of humane conversation, to
honor my Parents, to obey Rulers, and reverence the Ministry of the Word, to
have hands clean from blood, true from theft, a body free from Adultery, and a
tongue void of all offense, but purge the heart first O Lord, etc. --

In his Meditation concerning the sober usage of the body, and the pleasures of
this life. Pa. 184, 185.
-- O that I could consider often and heartily that this body God has made to
be the tabernacle and mansion of our soul for this life; but by reason of sin
dwelling in it, is become now to the soul nothing else but a prison, and that
most strait, vile, stinking, filthy, etc. Then should I not pamper up my body
to obey it, but bridle it that it may obey the soul; then should I fly the
pain it patteth my soul unto by reason of sin and provocation to all evil, and
continually desire the dissolution of it, with Paul, and the deliverance from
it, as much as ever did prisoner his deliverance out of prison, for alonely by
it the Devil has a door to tempt and so to hurt me. -- If it were dissolved,
and I out of it, then could Satan no more hurt me, then would thou speak unto
me face to face, then the conflicting ^ime were at an end, then sorrow would
cease, and ^oy would increase, and I should enter into inesti^able rest. --

In his Meditation for exercise of true mortification. Pa. 189, 190.
-- He that will be ready in weighty mat^ers to deny his own will, and to be
obedient to the will of God, the same had need to accustom himself to deny his
desires in matters of less weight, and to exercise mortification of his will in
trifles. -- If we cannot watch with Christ one hour (as he ^ith to Peter) we
undoubtedly can much less go to ^eath with him. Wherefore, that in great
tempta^^ons we may be ready to say with Christ, Not my ^ill but thi^e be done,
etc. Help me to accustom ^^y self continually to mortify my concupiscence
(...) pleasant things, i. e. of wealth, riches, glory, liberty, favor of men,
meats, drink, apparel, ease, yea and life it self, etc. --

In his Meditation of Gods Providence. Pa. 192.193.
-- This ought to be unto us most certain, that nothing is done without thy
Providence O Lord, i.e. without thy Knowledge, i. e. without thy Will, Wisdom,
and Ordinance, for all these Knowledge does comprehend in it, etc. --

This will we must believe most assuredly to be all just and good, howsoever
otherwise it seem so unto us. -- But though all things be done by thy
Providence, yet Providence has many and diverse means to work by, which means
being contemned thy providence is contemned also. Pa. 194.
-- Indeed when means cannot be had, then should we not tie thy Providence to
means, but make it free as thou art free; for it is not of any need, that thou
usest any instrument or mean to serve thy Providence. Thy Power and Wisdom is
infinite, and therefore should we hang on thy Providence even when all is clean
against us. -- Grant (Dear Father) that I may use this knowledge to my comfort
and commodity in thee; i. e. Grant that in what state soever I be, Pa. 195.
I may not doubt but the same does come to me by thy most just Ordinance; yea,
by thy merciful Ordinance; for as thou art just, and thou art merciful, yea,
thy mercy is above all thy works. -- Look for thy help in time convenient, not
only when I have means, by which tho^ may work, and art so accustomed to
do, but also when I have no means, but am destiture; yea, when all means be
directly and clean against me, gran^ (I say) yet that I may still hang on thee,
and on thy Providence, not doubting of a Fatherly end in thy good time. And
least I should contemn thy Providence, or presuming upon it by uncoupling those
things which thou have coupled together, preserve me from neglecting thy
ordinary and lawful means in all my needs; if so be I may have them, Pa. 196.
and with a good conscience use them, although I know thy Providence be not
tied to them farther than pleases thee. -- Howbeit so, that I depend in no
part on the means, or on my diligence, wisdom, and industry, but on thy
Providence, which more and more persuade me to be altogether fatherly, and
good, how far soever, otherwise it appear, yea is felt of me.

In his Meditation of Gods presence. Pa. 197, 198.
-- There is nothing that makes more to true godliness of life; than the
persuasion of thy presence. (Dear Father, and that nothing is hid from thee,
but all to thee is open and naked, even the very thoughts which one day thou will reveal, either to our praise or punishment in this life, as thou did
David's faults, 2 King. 12. or in the life to come, Mat. 25. Grant to me (Dear
God) mercy for all my sins, especially my hid and close sins, etc. and that
henceforth I always think my self conversant before thee, so that if I do
well, I pass not the publishing of it, as Hypocrites do, if I do or think any
evil, I may know that the same shall not always be hid from men. Grant me that
I may always have in mind that day wherein all my works shall be revealed, so
in trouble and wrong I shall find comfort, and otherwise be kept through thy
grace from evil.

In his Meditation of God's power, beauty, Pa. 199.
and goodness. -- Because thou Lord would have us to love thee, not only
do thou will, entice, allure, and provoke us, but also do command us so to
do, promising thy self unto such as love thee, and threatening us with damnation
if we do otherwise, whereby we may see both our great corruption and
naughtiness, and also thine exceeding great mercy toward us. -- What a thing
is it, that power, riches, authority, beauty, goodness, liberality, truth,
justice, which all thou art, good Lord, cannot move us to love thee? whatsoever
things we see fair, good, wise, mighty, are but even sparkles of thy power,
beauty, goodness, wisdom, which thou art. --

In his Meditation of death, Pa. 202, 203.
etc. -- O Dear Father. -- That our hearts were persuaded that when we go out
of the prison of the body, and so taken into thy blessed company then. --
Whatsoever good we can wish we shall have, and whatsoever we loath, shall be
far from us, etc. Then should we live in longing for that which we now most
loath. Pa. 204.
-- If we remember the good things that after this life shall ensue, without
wavering in the certainty of faith, the passage of death shall be the more
desired. It is like a sailing over the sea to thy home and country: it is like
a medicine or purgation to the health of the soul and body: It is the best
Physician. It is like a woman in travail; for as the child (^eing delivered)
comes into a more large place than the womb, wherein it did lie before, so the
soul being delivered out of the body, comes into a much more large and fair
place, even into Heaven. --

In his Prayer for the remission of sins. Pa. 224, 225.
-- O gracious God, who seek all means possible how to bring thy children to
the sea ling, and sure sense of thy mercy; and therefore when prosperity will
not serve, then sendest thou adversity, graciously correcting them here, whom
thou will shall with thee elsewhere live for ever. We poor Misers give humble
praises and thanks to thee (Dear Father) that thou have vouchsafed us worthy of
thy correction at this present, hereby to work that which we in prosperity and
liberty did neglect. For the which neglecting, and many other our grievous
sins, whereof we now accuse our selves before thee (most merciful Lord) thou
might have most justly given us over, and destroyed both souls and bodies.
But such is thy goodness toward us in Christ, that thou seem to forget all
our offenses, and -- wilt that we should suffer this Cross now laid upon us
for thy Truth and Gospels sake, and so to be thy witnesses with the Prophets,
Apostles, Martyrs, and Confessors, yea with thy dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ
to whom thou do now here begin to fashion us like, Pa. 226.
that in his glory we may be like him also. O good God, what are we on whom
thou should show this great mercy? O loving Lord, forgive us our
unthankfulness and sins. O faithful Father, give us thy holy Spirit now to cry
in our hearts, Abba, dear Father, to assure us of our eternal election in
Christ, to reveal more and more thy Truth unto us, to confirm, strengthen, and
stablish us so in the same, that we may live and dye in it as Vessels of thy
mercy, to thy glory, and to the commodity of thy Church. Indue us with the
Spirit of thy wisdom, that with good conscience we may always so answer the
enemies in thy cause, as may turn to their conversion, or confusion, and our
unspeakable consolation in Jesus Christ, for whose sake we beseech thee
henceforth to keep us, to give us patience, and to will none otherwise for
deliverance or mitigation of our misery, than may stand always with thy good
pleasure and merciful will toward us. Grant this, dear Father, not only to us
in this place, but also to all others elsewhere afflicted for thy Names sake,
through the death and merit of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

In his godly Meditations. See the godly Meditations of Mr. John Bradford. page
415.
-- We are rather to be placed among the wicked, than among thy children, for
that we are so shameless for our sin, and careless for thy wrath, which we may
well say to be most grievous against us, and evidently set forth in the taking
away of our good King, and the true Religion, in the exile of thy Servants,
imprisonment of thy People, misery of thy Children, and death of thy Saints:
and by placing over us in authority thine enemies, by the success thou gave
them in all that they took in hand, by the returning again into our Country of
Antichrist the Pope. -- What shall we do? what shall we say? who can give us
penitent hearts? who can open our lips, that our mouths might make acceptable
confession unto thee? Page 6.
-- O what now may we do? Despair? no, for thou art God, and therefore good;
thou art merciful, and therefore thou forgivest sins, with thee is mercy and
propitiation; and therefore thou art worshipped. When Adam had sinned, thou
gave him mercy before he desired it, and will thou deny us mercy, which now
desire the same? Page 7.
Adam excused his fault, and accused thee, but we accuse our selves, and excuse
thee, and shall we be sent empty away? -- Abraham was pulled out of Idolatry,
when the world was drowned therein, and art thou his God only? Israel in
captivity in Egypt was graciously visited and delivered, and dear God, that
same good Lord, shall we always be forgotten? How often in the wilderness
did thou defer and spare thy plagues at the request of Moses, when the people
themselves made no Petition to thee; and seeing we do not only make our
Petitions to thee, but also have a Mediator for us, now far above Moses, even
Jesus Christ, shall we (I say) dear Lord, depart ashamed? Page 11.
Take into thy custody and governance for ever our souls and bodies, our lives,
and all that ever we have. Tempt us never further than thou will make us able
to bear, and -- always as thy children guide us, so that our life may please
thee, and our deaths praise thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord, for whose sake
we heartily pray thee to grant these things, etc. not only to us, but, etc.
especially for thy children, that be in thraldom under their enemies, in exile,
in prison, poverty, etc. Page 12.
Be merciful to all the whole Realm of England, grant us all true repentance,
and mitigation of our misery. And if it be thy good will, that thy holy Word
and Religion may continue amongst us. Pardon our Enemies, Persecutors, and
Slanderers, and if it be thy pleasure turn their hearts. -- Oh mighty King and
most High, Page 49.
Almighty God, who mercifully governest all things which thou have made, look
down upon the faithful seed of Abraham, etc. consecrated to thee by the
anointing of thy holy Spirit, and appointed to thy Kingdom by thy eternal
purpose, free mercy, and grace, but yet as strangers wandering in this vile vale
of misery, brought forth daily by worldly Tyrants like Sheep to the flaughter.
-- Thou have destroyed Pharaob with all his Horse and Chariots, puffed up with
pride against thy people, leading forth safely by the hands of thy mercy thy
beloved Israel through the high waves of the roaring waters. Thou O God, Page
50.
the Lord of all Hosts and Armies did first drive away from the Gates of thy
people the blasphemous Senacherib, slaying of his Army 85000 by the Angel in
one night, and after by his own Sons before his Idols did kill the same
blasphemous Idolater, etc. Thou did transform and change proud
Nebuchadnezzar, the enemy of thy people, into a bruit beast, to eat grass and
hay, to the horrible terror of all worldly Tyrants, etc. Thou did preserve
those thy three Servants in Babylon, who with bold courage gave their bodies to
the fire, because they would not worship any dead Idol, and when they were cast
into the burning Furnace thou did give them cheerful hearts to rejoice and
sing Psalms, Page 51.
and savedst unhurt the very hairs of their heads, turning the flame from them
to devour their enemies. Thou O Lord God by the might of thy right arm, which
governs all, broughtest Daniel thy Prophet safe into light and life forth of
the dark Den of the devouring Lions, Page 52.
etc. -- Now also, O heavenly Father, beholder of all things, to whom belongs
vengeance, thou see and considerest how thy holy Name by the wicked
Worldlings, and blasphemous Idolaters is dishonored, thy sacred Word forsaken,
refused, and despised, thy holy Spirit provoked, offended, thy chosen Temple
polluted and defiled. Tarry not too long therefore, but show thy power speedily
upon thy chosen Household, which is so grievously vexed, and so cruelpy handled
by thy open enemies. Avenge thine own glory, and shorten these evil days for
thine Elects sake. Let thy Kingdom come of all thy Servants desired, and
though we have all offended thy Majesty. Page 53.
-- Yet for thine own glory (O merciful Lord) suffer not the enemy of thy Son
Christ, the Romish Antichrist, thus wretchedly to delude and draw from thee our
poor brethren, for whom thy Son once died, that by his cruelty, after so clear
light, they should be made Captives to dumb Idols and devilish inventions of
Popish Ceremonies thereunto pertaining. Suffer him not to seduce the simple
sort with this fond opinion, that his false gods, blind, mumbling, feigned
Religion, or his foolish Superstition does give him such conquest, such
victories, such triumph, and so high an hand over us. We know most certainly, O
Lord, Page 54.
that it is not their arm and power, but our sins and offenses, that has
delivered us to their fury, and has caused thee to turn away from us: But turn
again, O Lord, let us fall into thine hands, etc. least these vain Idolaters do
rejoice at the miserable destruction of those men whom they make Proselytes,
and from thy Doctrine Apostates. But O Lord, thy will be fulfilled, this is thy
righteous judgment to punish us with the tyrannical yoke of blindness, because
we have cast away from us the sweet yoke of the wholesome Word of thy Son our
Savior. Yet consider the horrible blasphemies of thine and our enemies. Page
55.
-- They say in their hearts there is no God, which either can or will deliver
us: Wherefore, O heavenly Father, the Governor of all things, the Avenger of
the Causes of the poor, the fatherless, the widow, and the oppressed, look down
from Heaven with the face of thy fatherly mercies, and forgive us all former
offenses, and for thy Son Jesus Christ's sake have mercy upon us; who by the
force and cruelty of wicked and blasphemous Idolaters, (without causes
approved) are haled and pulled from our own houses, are slandered, slain, and
murdered as Rebels and Traitors, like persons pernicious, pestiferous,
leditious, pestilent, and full of mortal poison, to all men contagious; whereas
we do meddle no farther but against the hellish powers of darkness, etc. which
would deny the will of our Christ unto us, we do contend no farther but only
for our Christ Crucified, and the only salvation by his blessed Passion. Page
56.
-- Therefore (O Lord) for thy glorious Names sake, for Jesus Christ's sake,
etc. make the wicked Idolaters to wonder and stand amazed at thy Almighty
power. Use thy wonted strength to the confusion of thine enemies, and to the
help and deliverance of thy persecuted people. All thy Saints do beseech thee
therefore: The young Infants (which have some deal tasted of thy sweet Word) by
whose mouths thou have promised to make perfect thy praises, whose Angels do
always behold thy face, who besides the loss of us their Parents, are in danger
to be compelled and driven (without thy great mercies) to serve dumb and
insensible Idols, do cry and call unto thee: Their pitiful Mothers, with
lamentable-tears lie prostrate before the Throne of thy Grace. Page 57.
Thou Father of the fatherless, Judge of the widows, and Avenger of all the
oppressed, Let it appear, O Lord Omnipotent, that thou do here Judge, Avenge,
and punish all wrongs offered to all thy little Ones that do believe in thee.
Do this, O^ Lord, For thy Names sake. Arise up, O Lord, and thine enemies shall
be scattered and confounded. So be it. O Lord most merciful, at thy time
appointed.

In his Letter to Mr. Pa. 323.
Warcup. -- Be not so dainty, as to look for that at God your dear Fathers
hands, which the Fathers, Patriarks, Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Saints,
and his own Son Jesus Christ did not find, i. e. all fair way and fair weather
to Heavne. -- The Devil stands now at every Inne-door in this City and
Country of thi^ World, crying unto us to tarry and Lodge in this or that place
till the storms be over-past, not tha^ he would not have us to wet our skin,
but that the time of our running our Race might over-pass us ^o our utter
destruction. -- Fear not the Flail, fear not the Fanning-wind, fear not the
Millstone, fear not the Oven; for all these make you more meet for the Lords
tooth.

In his Letter to Dr. Hill. Pa. 326.
-- Such as think it enough to keep the heart pure, notwithstanding that the
outward man curry favor, as they deny God to be jealous, one that will have
the whole man, having created, redeemed, and sanctified ^oth for himself, so
they play the Dissemblers with the Church of God, by their parting stakes
between God and the World, offending the Godly, whom either they provoke to
fall with them, or make more careless and conscienceless, if they have fallen,
and occasioning the wicked and obstinate to triumph against God, and the more
vehemently to prosecute their malic^ against such as will not defile themselves
in body or soul with the Romish Rags, now received among us. -- Call to mind
that there are but two Masters, two kind of people, two ways, and two Mansion
places. The Masters be Christ and Satan; the people the Servitors to either of
these; the ways be strait and wide; the Mansions be Heaven and Hell. This
World is the place of trial of Gods people and ^he Devils servants by whom they
follow: The Cross it is that does make the trial.

In his Letter to Royden and Esing. Pa. 333.
-- Whom would it grieve, which has a long journey to go through a piece of
foul way, if he knew that after that, the way should be most pleasant, yea the
journey should be ended, and he at his resting place most happy? Who will be
afraid or loath to leave a little pelf for a little time, if he knew he should
afterward very speedily receive most plentiful riches? Who will be unwilling
for a while to forsake his wife, children, friends, etc. when he knows he
shall shortly after be associated to them inseparably, even after his own hearts
desire? Who will be sorry to forsake his life, who is most certain of eternal
life? Who loves the shadow better than the body? Who can desire the dross of
this world, but such as be ignorant of the treasures of the everlasting joy in
Heaven? Who is afra^d to dye, but such as hope not to live eternally? -- What
way is so sure a way to Heaven, as to suffer in Christ's Cause? If there be any
way o^ Horseback to Heaven, surely this is the way, Acts 14.2. Tim. 3. The
Devil cannot love his Enemies. Should we look for fire to quench our thirst? As
soon shall Gods true Servants find peace and favor in Antichrists Regiment.

In a Letter to Mrs. Pa. 345.
Anno Warcup. -- My staff^ stande^ at the door. I look continually for the
Sheriff to come for me; and I bless God I am ready for him. Now go I to
practice that which I have preached. Now am I climbing up to the hill; it will
cause me to puff and to blow before I come to the cliffe. The hill is steep
and high; my breath is short, and my strength is feeble. Pray therefore to the
Lord for me, that as I have now through his goodness even almost come to the
top, I may by his grace be strengthened not to rest till I come where I should
be. O^ loving Lord, put out thy hand, and draw me unto thee; for no man comes
be he whom the Father draws. See my dearly beloved, God's loving mercy: He
knows my shor^ breath and great weakness. As he sent for Elius is a fiery
Chariot, so sends he for me. By fire my dro^ must be purified, that I may be
fine gold in h^^ sight.

In his Letter to Mr. Augustine B^rnher. -- I have now taken a more certain
answer of death than ever I did. A^ my God, the hour is come, glorify thy most
unworthy child. I have glorified thee (says this my sweet Father) and I will
glorify thee. Amen.

was the usual close of his Letters which he writ in Prison. When he came into
Smithfield, he fell flat on his face, and prayed; then taking a Faggot in his
hand he kissed it, and so likewise the Stake; and standing by the Stake,
lifting up his hands and eyes to Heaven, he said, O England, England, repent of
thy sins, repent of thy sins, beware of idolatry, beware of false Antichrist,
take heed they do not deceive thee; and to his fellow Martyr he said, Be of
good comfort Brother, for we shall have a merry Supper with the Lord this
night; and then embracing the reeds, the said, Strait is the gate, and narrow
is the way that ^eads to life, and few there be that find it.

What can be so heavy a burden, as an unquiet Conscience to be in such a place,
as a man cannot be suffered to serve God in Christ's Religion? If you be loath to
depart from your Kin and Friends, Remember that Christ calls them his Mother,
Sisters, and Brothers, that do his Fathers will. Where we find therefore God
truly honored according to his will, there we can lack neither Friend nor Kin.
If you be loath to depart for the ^^andering of Gods Word, Remember that Christ
when his hour was not yet come, departed out of his Country into Samaria, to
avoid the malice o^ the Scribes and Pharisees, and commanded hi^ Apostles, that
if they were pursued in one place, they should fly to another. Thus did Paul,
and the other Apostles. Albeit when it came to such ^ point, that they could no
longer escape, than the^ evidenced that their flying before came not o^ fear,
but of godly wisdom to do more good; an^ that they would not rashly, without
urgent necessity offer themselves to death, which had been tempting of God.

so as he could not set them upon the ground and all to make them deny Christ,
which (said he I will never do; for if I should deny him in thi^ world, he
would deny me hereafter.

Barnes.
When Dr. See his Life and Martyrdom before his Works, set forth by Mr. Fox:
Baynes was brought before Cardinal W^lsey, He told him, he thought it
necessary that his Golden Shoos, and Golden Cushions, etc. should be sold and
given to the poor, for that such things were not comely for his Calling,
neither was the Kings Majesty maintained by his Pomp, but by God, who faith, By
me Kings reign.

When the Cardinal would have had him to refer himself to him, promising him
Favor, he answered, I will stick to the Holy Scripture, and to Gods Book,
according to the simple Talent that God has lent me.

Being called before the Bishops and Abbot of Westminster, who demanded of him,
whether he would abjure or burn, he was in a great agony, and then thought
rather to burn than to abjure; but persuaded by Gardener and Fox, because they
said he should do more good in time to come, He abjured, and carried his Faggot
to Paul's.

After they had long detained him in Prison notwithstanding, upon notice given
him of their intentions to burn him, notwithstanding his abjuration, he escaped
out of England into Germany, where he made his supplication to King Henry the
Eighth, against the Lordly Bishops and Prelates of England, for the
intolerable injuries, wrongs, and oppressions wherewith they had vexed not
only himself, but all true Preachers of Gods Word, and Professors of the same,
contrary to the Word of God, and their own Laws and Doctors. -- I do not
believe (says he) that ever God will suffer long so great Tyranny against his
Word, and so violent Oppressions of Christians, as they now use, and that in
the Name of Christ and his Holy Church -- Now it is come to that, that whoever
he be, high or low, poor or rich, wise or foolish, that speaks against them
and their vicious living, he is either made a Traitor to your Grace, or an
Heretic against Holy Church, as though they were Kings or Gods. -- If there be
any men, that Preach, Dispute, or put forth in Writing not any thing touching
them, though it be never so blasphemous against God, the Blood of Christ, and
his Holy Word, they will not once be moved therewith, -- But if any man speak
against their Cloaked Hypocrisy, or against any thing belonging to them, by
which their abominations are disclosed, nothing can excuse, but he must either
to open shame, or cruel death, and that under the accusation of Treason. But
who is he that would be ^ Traitor, or maintain a Traitor against your Majesty?
Sure no man can do it without the great displeasure of the eternal God. The
Doctrine of the Gospel teaches all obedience to Rulers, and not Sedition; and
such as have preached the Word of God only, have never been the movers of
disobedience or rebellion against Princes, but they have been ready to suffer
with all patience whatsoever Tyranny any Power would minister unto them, giving
all people example to do the same; whereas the Papists exempt the Pope and
Priests from being bound to obey Magistrates. Yea, as to the people they teach,
that the words requiring Subjection are a Counsel, and not a Command; and that
the Popes Authority is sufficient to Dispense with all the Commandments of God.
-- Wherefore most gracious Prince, I lowly and merely desire your Majesty to
Judge between the Bishops and me, which of us is truest and faithfullest to God
and to your Majesty.

The following Articles were some of Dr. Barnes his Position in his Sermon,
which the Bishops condemned for Heresy. (1) If thou believe that thou art more
bound to serve God to morrow, which is Christmas day, or on Easter day, or on
Whitsunday, for any holiness that is in one day more than another, thou art
superstitious. (2) Now dare no man preach the Truth and the very Gospel of God,
especially they that be feeble and fearful; but I trust, yea I pray to God,
that it may shortly come that false and manifest errors may be plainly showed,
etc. (3) We make now adays Martyrs, I trust we shall have many more shortly;
for the Verity could never be preached plainly, but persecution followed. (6) I
will never believe, neither can I believe that one man may be by the Law of God
a Bishop of two or three Cities, yea of a whole Country; for it is contrary to
Saint Paul, Tit. 1.
who ^aith, I have left thee behind to set in every City a Bishop. (7) It
cannot be proved by Scripture that ^ man of the Church should have so great
temporal possessions. (8) Sure I am, that they cannot by ^he Law of God have
any Jurisdiction secular. (9) They say they be the Successors of Christ and his
Apostles, but I can see them follow none but Judas; for they bear the purse and
have all the money.

To burn me or to destroy me (says he in his Defense of the Two and twentieth
Article) cannot so greatly profit them; for when I am dead, the Sun, and the
Moon, and the Stars, and the Elements, yea and also Stones shall defend this
Cause against them, rather than the Verity should perish. -- As for me I do
promise them here by this present Writing, and by the fidelity I owe to my
Prince, that if they will be bound to our noble Prince, after the manner of his
Law, and after good conscience and right, that they shall do me no violence,
nor wrong, but discuss and dispute these Articles, and all other that I have
written after the holy Word of God, and by Christ's holy Scripture with me, then
will I (as soon as I may know it) present my self unto our most noble Prince to
prove these things by Gods Word against you all. --

He also writ unto King Henry the Eighth an excellent Treatise to prove from
the Scriptures of Truth, and out of the Writings of the Fathers, tha^ faith
only justifies before God. Prefacing it thus, Now if your Grace do not take
upon you to hear the Disputation of this Article out of the ground of holy
Scripture, my Lords the Bishops will condemn it, before they read it, as their
manner is to do with all things, that please them not, and which they
understand not, and then cry they, Heresy, Heresy, an Heretic, an Heretic,
he ought no^ to be heard, etc.

He writ also several other Treatises, as what the Church is, what the Keys of
the Church be, and to whom they were given. Against free will, tha^ it is
lawful for all men to read the holy Scriptures, that men's constitutions, which
are not grounded in Scripture, bind not the Conscience, etc. In which Treatise
he tells us, there be two manners of Powers; a Temporal, and a Spiritual Power.
The Temporal is committed to Magistrates; in this Power the King is chief and
full Ruler, etc. Unto this Power must we be obedient in all things that pertain
to the ministration of this present life, and of the Commonwealth, not only
for avoiding of punishment, but for conscience sake. So that if this Power
command any thing of Tyranny against right and law (always provided it repugne
not against the Gospel, nor destroy our Faith) our Charity must needs suffer
it. -- Nevertheless if he command thee any thing against right, or do thee any
wrong, if thou can by any reasonable and quiet means, without sedition,
insurrection, or breaking of the common Peace save thy self, or avoid his
Tyranny, thou may do it with good Conscience. -- But in no wise may thou
make any resistance with sword or with hand, but obey, except thou can avoid
as I have showed thee. -- But now it will be enquired, if it please the King to
condemn the New Testament in English, and to command that none of his Subjects
shall have it under displeasure, whether they be bound to obey this Command or
no? To this he answers (having showed why the King should not lay any such
Command on his Subjects) If the King forbid the New Testament, or any of
Christ's Sacraments, or the preaching of the Word of God, or any other thing
that is against Christ, under a temporal pain, or under the pain of death, men
should first make faithful prayers to God, and then intercede the King for a
release of the Command. If he will not do it they shall keep their Testament,
with all other Ordinances of Christ, and let the King exercise his Tyranny (if
they cannot flee) and in no wise under pain of damnation shall they withstand
him with violence, but suffer patiently, and leave the Vengeance of it to their
heavenly Father, which has a scourge to tame those Bedlams with, when he sees
his time: Neither shall they deny Christ's Verity, nor forsake it before the
Prince, lest they run the danger of being denied by Christ before his Father.
-- This may be proved by the examples of the Apostles, when the High Priests of
the Temple commanded Peter and John that they should no more Preach and Teach
in the Name of Jesus: Acts 4. and 5.
They made them answer, It was more right to obey God than man. Also the
Pharisees came and commanded our Master Christ in Herod's Name to depart from
thence under pain of death: But he would not obey, but bid them go tell that
Wolf, Behold I cast out Devils, Luke 13.
etc. Nevertheless I must continue this day, to morrow, and the next day, etc.
So that he left not the Ministration of the Word for the Kings pleasure, nor
yet for fear of death. The three Children also would not obey the Kings command
against Gods Word. Dan. 3.
Daniel would not leave off Prayer, Dan. 6.
though commanded by the King. -- So that Christians are bound to obey in
suffering the Kings Tyranny, but not in consenting to his unlawful Command,
Always having before their eyes, the comfortable saying of our Master Christ,
Fear not them that can only kill the body; Mat. 10.
and that of Peter, Happy are ye if ye siffer for righteousness sake, etc. --
As for the Spiritual Power, it has no^ authority to make Statutes or Laws to
order the World by, but only faithfully and truly to preach the Word, not
adding thereto, nor taking therefrom. -- If these Ministers will of Tyranny,
above the Word of God, make any Law or Statute, it must be considered, whether
it be openly and directly against the Word of God, and to the destruction of
the Faith, etc. such Statutes men are not bound for to obey, neither of
Charity, (for here Faith is hurt, which gives no place to Charity) nor for
avoiding of slander, etc. The more that men be offended at the Word, and the
stiffer they be against it, the more openly and plainly, yea and that to their
faces, that make such Statutes, must we resist them with these words, We are
more bound to obey God than man. -- The other manner of Statutes be when
certain things, that be called indifferent, be commanded to be done of
necessity, etc. Here must they also be withstood, and in no wise obeyed; for in
this is our Faith hurt, and liberty of Christianity, etc. and therefore must
withstand them that will take this liberty from us, with this Text of
Scripture, 1 Cor. 7.
We are bought with the price of Christ's blood, we will not be the servants of
men. This Text is open against them, that will bind men's Consciences in those
things that Christ has left them free in. Gal. 2.
Of this we have an evident example in Paul, who would not circumcise Titus,
when the false Brethren would have compelled him thereunto, as a thing of
necessity. -- It is plain, that by Christ we are made free, and nothing can
bind us to sin, but his Word. --

At the Stake Dr. Barnes began with this Protestation following: I am come
hither to be burned as an Heretic, and you shall hear my belief, whereby you
shall perceive what erroneous opinions I hold. -- I believe in the holy and
blessed Trinity, three Persons and one God, that created and made all the
World, and that this blessed Trinity sent down the Second Person Jesus Christ
into the womb of the most blessed and purest Virgin Mary, etc. I believe that
without the consent of man's will or power, he was conceived by the Holy Ghost,
and took flesh of her, and that he suffered hunger, thirst, cold, and other
passions of our body, (sin except) etc. And I do believe that he lived here
among us, and after he had preached and taught his Fathers Will, he suffered
the most bitter and cruel Death for me and all mankind. And I do believe that
this his Death and Passion was the Iufficient Price and Ransom for the sin of
all the World; And I do believe that through his Death he overcame the Devil,
Sin, Death, and Hell, and that there is none other satisfaction unto the
Father, but this his Death and Passion only; and that no work of man did
deserve any thing of God, but only his Passion, as touching our justification;
for I acknowledge the best work that ever I did is impure and unperfect.
(Herewithal he cast abroad his Arms, and desired God to forgive him his
Trespasses) Wherefore I trust in no good work that ever I did, but only in the
Death of Christ, and I do not doubt but through him to inherit the Kingdom of
Heaven. -- The Sheriff hastening him to make an end, he turned to the people
and desired all men to forgive him, and if he had said any evil at any time
unadvisedly, whereby he had offended any man, or given any occasion of evil,
that they would forgive it him, and amend that evil they took of him, and to
bear witness, that he detested and abhorred all evil Opinions and Doctrines
against the Word of God, and that he died in the Faith of Jesus Christ, by whom
he doubted not to be saved.

Brez.
A Lady visiting Mr. Guy de Brez, Fox Vol. 3. Cont. p. 37.
a French Minister, Prisoner in the Castle of Tournay, told him, She wondered
how he could either eat, or drink, or sleep in quiet; for were I in your case
(said she) the very terror thereof would go nigh to kill me. O Madam (said he)
the good Cause, for which I suffer, and that inward Peace of Conscience,
wherewith God has endued me, makes me eat and drink with greater content, than
mine enemies can, which seek my life. Yea so far off is it, that my bonds or
chains do any way terrify me, or break off my sleep, that on the contrary I
glory and take delight therein, esteeming them at an higher rate, than Chains
and Rings of Gold, or any other Jewels of price whatsoever. Yea when I hear the
rattling of my Chains methinks I hear some Instrument of Music sounding in mine
ears: not that such an effect comes merely from my Chains, but in regard I am
bound therewith for maintaining the truth of the Gospel.

In his Letter to his Wife. -- These thoughts came at first thronging into my
head. What meant we to go so many in company together as we did? Had it not
been for such and such, we had never been discovered, or taken. But meditating
on the Providence of God, my heart began to find wonderful rest, saying thus in
my self, O my God, the day and hour of my birth was before ordained of thee,
and ever since thou have preserved and kept me in great perils and dangers, and
hitherto delivered me out of all. And if now the hour be come, wherein I must
pass out of this life into thy Kingdom, thy will be done. I cannot escape out
of thine hands; yea though I could, yet, Lord, thou know I would not, seeing
all my felicity depends upon conforming my will to thine. -- This World is not
the place of our Rest, No, Heaven is our Home, this is but the place of our
Banishment. -- Take into your consideration the honor the Lord does you, in
giving you an Husband that is not only called to be a Minister of Christ's
Gospel, but also so highly advanced of God, as to be accounted worthy to
partake of the Crown of Martyrdom. It is an honor, which the Angels in Heaven
are not capable of. -- I am here taught to practice, what I have preached to
others; yea let me not be ashamed to confess, that when I heretofore preached,
I spoke but as a Parrot, in regard of that which I have now better learned by
proof and experience. Ward, page 161.
(All my former discourses, were as a blind man's of Colors, in comparison of
my present feeling. Oh what a precious Comforter is a good Conscience!) I have
profited more in the School-house of this Prison, than ever I did in all my
life before. -- I would not change my condition with theirs that persecute me,
though I am lodged in the vilest Prison they have, dark and obscure, where I
have no air to breath at, but a little stinking Hole, where they lay all their
Rubbish, and where the Drunkards commonly vent their Urine, and though I be
laden with Irons both on my hands and feet, eating through the flesh even to
the bare bones, etc. and that I may make no escape guarded with forty men
before the Prison door. --

When the Provost brought him tidings that he was to be burnt at Six, Page 42.
or there abouts that day, He gave him thanks for the good News, which he had
brought him. And going to the rest of the Prisoners he said, Brethren, I am
this day to die for the Doctrine of the Gospel, and now, blessed be God, I joy
and rejoice therein. I had not thought that ever God would have done me this
honor. I feel my self replenished with joy more and more, from minute to
minute. My God adds new courage to me, and my heart leapeth for joy within me.

Then exhorting them to be of good courage, he told them it was no hard matter
to dye, adding by way of acclamation, O how happy are the dead that dye in the
Lord, for they rest from their labors, and their works follow them!

Beware you do nothing (said he) against a good Conscience, etc. For if you do,
you shall certainly feel such an Hell in your Consciences, as will never cease
to vex and trouble you. O my Brethren, how good a thing is it to nourish a good
Conscience! One of the Prisoners asking him, Whether he had finished a certain
work, which he had begun, He answered, No, for now I must cease to labor,
because I am passing along to the heavenly rest.

The time of my departing is at hand, I go to reap that in Heaven, which I have
sown on Earth. I have fought a good fight, I am at the point of finishing my
course, from henceforth the Crown of Glory is laid up for me, which the Lord,
the righteous Judge shall give unto me.

Methinks (said he with a joyful and smiling countenance) that my spirit has
obtained wings to fore alost into Heaven, being invited to the marriage Supper
of the Lamb.

The Provost coming in with Bands, Mr. Gay bid him welcome, and gave him thanks
again for his good news. The Provost replying that it grieved him much that
things should be carried so, Mr. Gay joyfully answered, I accept of you as my
good Friend, I love you with all my heart.

on me, and receive my soul.

Canesire.
There is one Passage in your Letter (said Claude de la Canesire, The Mirror
of Martyrs, page 575.
in a Letter to his Wife from Lions) which does not a little comfort me,
namely, that albeit you are loath to leave me, yet you had rather have no
husband at all, then to have one that should betray the cause of Christ.

Cardmaker.
Mr. John Cardmaker, burnt in Smithfield, 1555. Fox, Vol. 3. page 250.
in a Letter to a Friend writes thus. You shall right well perceive, that I am
not gone back as some men do report me, but as ready to give my life as any of
my Brethren, that are gone before me. -- That day, that I recant any point of
Doctrine, I shall suffer twenty kinds of death, the Lord being my assistance,
as I doubt not, but he will. -- I have learned to rejoice in poverty, as well
as riches, for that I count now to be very riches. -- I have conferred with
some of my learned Adversaries, and I find they are but Sophisters and shadows.

Careless.
John Careless of Coventry, Weaver, Fox, Vol. 3. page 713.
being wished by Dr. Martin to play the wise man's part, to save that which God
has bought. I thank you Sir (said he) and I put you out of doubt, that I am
most sure and certain of my salvation by Jesus Christ, so that my soul is safe
already, whatsoever pains my body suffers here for a little time. Art thou so
predestined to life (said the Doctor) that thou can not perish in
whatsoever opinion thou do die. That God has predestined me to eternal
life in Jesus Christ (said he) I am most certain, and even so I am sure that
his Holy Spirit (wherewith I am sealed) will so preserve me from all Heresies,
and evil opinions, that I shall dye in none at all.

When the Dr. told him that he was a goodly tall man, and might do the Queen
good service in Ireland; He said, wheresoever I am, I am ready to do her Grace
the best service I can with body, goods, and life, and if she, or any under
require me to do any thing contrary to Christ's true Religion, I am ready also
to do service in Smithfield, as my Bedfellows and other Brethren have done,
praised be God for them.

In his Letter to Mr. Pa. 715.
Philpot. -- Ah my true loving Friends, how soon did you say aside all other
business to make a sweet plaster for my wounded conscience, yea, and that out
of a painful pair of Stocks, which place must needs be uneasy to write in! But
God has brought you in a strait place, that you might set my soul at liberty.
-- An good Jeremy, has Phassur put thee into the Stocks: why now thou have the
right reward of a Prophet. -- Though you lie in the dark, slurred with the
Bishops black coal-dust, yet shall you shortly be made as white as snow in
Salmon, and as the wings of a Dove that is covered with silver, and her
seathers like gold. You know the Vessel before it be made bright, is soiled
with oil and other things, that it may scour the better. O happy be you that
you be now in the scouring house, for shortly you shall be set on the celestial
shelf, as bright as Angels. -- My old Friends of Coventry have put the Counsel
in remembrance of me not six days ago, saying, I am more worthy to be burnt
than any that has been burned yet. God's blessing on their hearts for their
good report. God make me worthy of that dignity, and hasten the time, that I
may ser forth his glory. -- Blessed be the time that ever I came into the Kings
Bench to be joined in love and fellowship with such dear children of the Lord.

In his Letter to his Wife. -- Pa. 716.
Are not two sparrows (says Christ) sold for a farthing, and yet not one of
them shall perish without the will of your Heavenly Father, etc. As though he
should have said, if God has such respect and care for a poor sparrow, which
is not worth one farthing, it shall not be taken in the lime-twig, net, or
pitfall, until it be his good will and pleasure: you may be well assured, that
not one of you (whom he so dearly loves, that he has given his only dear Son
for you) shall perish or depart forth of this miserable life, without his good
will and pleasure. -- Let not the remembrance of children keep you from God.
The Lord himself will be a Father and a Mother better than ever you or I could
have been unto them. He himself will do all things necessary for them, yea as
much as rock the cradle, if need be.

In his Letter to Mr. Bradferd. -- Pa. 717.
If we had been thankful to God for the good Ministers of his Word, we had not
so soon been deprived both of it and them. -- Take not away all thy true
Preachers forth of this Realm (O Lord) but leave us a seed, least England be
made like unto Sodom and Gomorrah when thy true Lots be gone. -- Hearken O
Heavens, and then Earth give ear, and bear me witness at the great Day, that I
do here faithsully and truly the Lord's message to his dear Servant, to his
singularly beloved and elect child John Bradford. John Bradford, thou man so
specially beloved of God, I pronounce and restifie unto thee in the Name of the
Lord Jehovah, that all thy sins whatsoever they be, be they never so many, so
grievous, or so great, be fully and freely pardoned, rele^sed, and forgiven
thee, by the mercy of God in Jesus Christ thine only Lord and sweet Savior,
in whom thou do undoubtedly believe. Christ has cleansed thee with his
blood, and clothed thee with his Righteousness, and has made thee in the
sight of God his Father without spot or wrinckle, so that when the fire does
his appointed office, thou shall be received (as a sweet burnt-sacrifice) into
Heaven, where thou shall joyfully remain in God's presence for ever, as the
true inheriter of his everlasting Kingdom, unto the which thou wast undoubtedly
predestinate, and ordained by the Lords infallible purpose and decree before
the foundation of the world was laid, and that this is most true that I have
said, I call the whole Trinity, the Almighty and Eternal Majesty of God the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost to my record at this present, whom I humbly
beseech to confirm and stablish in thee the true and lively feeling of the
same. Amen. Selah.

In his Letter to his dear and faithful Brethren in Newgate, Pa. 719.
condemned to dye. -- Cease not my dearly Beloved, so long as you be in this
life to praise the Lord with all your hearts, for that of his great mercy and
infinite goodness he has vouched you worthy of this great dignity, to suffer
for his sake, not only the loss of goods, wife, and children, long
imprisonment, cruel oppression, but death it self in the fire. This is the
greatest promotion that God can bring you, or any other into, in this vail of
misery; yea, so great an honor, as the highest Angel in Heaven is not
permitted to have, and yet has the Lord for his dear Son Christ's sake reputed
you worthy of the same, yea, and that before me and many others, who have both
long looked and longed for the same. -- Rejoice with double joy, and be glad,
my dear Brethren, for doubtless you have more cause than can be expressed. But
alas! I that for my sins am left behind, may lament with the holy Prophet, Woe
is me, that the days of my joyful rest are prolonged. Ah cursed Satan I which
has caused me so sore to offend my most dear loving Father, whereby mine exile
and banishment is so long prolonged. Oh Christ, my dear Advocate, pacify thy
Father's wrath, which I have justly deserved, that he may take me home to him
in his sweet mercy.

In his Letter to Mr. Green, etc. -- Pa. 720.
If they be so blessed of God that dye in the Lord, as the Holy Chost says
they be, how much more blessed and happy then are you, that die not only in
the Lord, but for the Lord. -- O blessed Green, etc. fresh and green shall thou
be in the Lord's House, and thy fruits shall never wither nor decay. --

O happy Mr. Whittle, Peter's part thou have well played, therefore thy reward
and portion shall be like his. Now have thou good experience of man's infirmity,
but much more proof and taste, yea sense and feeling of God's abundant
bottomless mercy. Although Satan desired to sist thee, yet Christ thy good
Captain prayed that thy faith should not fail. God's strength is made perfect
by thy weakness, etc. -- But alas! I lie like the lame man at the Pools side,
and every one goes into the place of health before me.

In his Letter to William Tyms. -- Satan has two great pieces of Ordnance to
shoot at you, with the which he cannot hurt you, because you have two bul-warks
to defend you. The first of these terrible Guns that he has shot at you is
fear and infidelity, for the uglesomness of death, and horror of your many and
great sins. But this pellet is easily put away with the sure shield of faith in
the most precious death and bloodshedding of our dear Lord and only Savior,
Jesus Christ, whom the Father has given to us wholly to be ours for evermore,
and with him has given us all things, as Paul says, so that though we be
never so great sinners, yet Christ is made unto us holiness, righteousness, and
justification; He has clothed us in all his merits, etc. and taken to himself
all our sin, etc. so that if any should be now condemned for the same, it must
needs be Jesus Christ, who has taken them upon him. But indeed he has made
satisfaction for them to the uttermost, so that for his sake they shall never
be imputed to us, if they were a thousand times more than they be.

The other pestilent Piece he shoots off at you is, to provoke you to put
some part of your trust and considence in your self, and in your own holiness
and righteousness, that you may that way rob God of his glory, and Christ of
the honor and dignity of his death; but blessed be the Lord God, you have also
a full strong B^l-work to beat back this pestilent Pellet, even the pure Law of
God, which proves the best of us all damnable sinners in the sight of God, and
that our best works are polluted, in such sort as the Prophet describes them,
with the which manner of speaking, our free will Pharisees are much offended,
for it felleth all man's righteousness to the ground.

In his Letter to Mr. Augustine Bernher. -- Pray for me that I may be strong
and hardy to lay a good load on that bloody beast of Babylon. O that I might so
strike him down, that he should never be able to rise again, but that stroke
belongs only to the Lord to strike at his coming, which I hope will be
shortly.

Carpenter.
All Bavaria (said George Carpenter) is not so dear to me as my wife and
children, Ward, page 156.
yet for Christ's sake I will forsake them cheerfully.

Carver.
Mr. Derick Carver, Fox, Vol. 3. page 385.
being asked by Bonner whether he would stand for his Confession, answered, He
would, for your Doctrine is poison and forcery. If Christ were here, you would
put him to a worse death, than he was put to before.

At the stake he spoke thus; Dear Brethren and Sisters, I am come here to seal
with my blood Christ's Gospel, because that I know it to be true. -- As many of
you as do believe upon the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost unto everlasting
life, see you do the works pertaining to the same. As many of you as do believe
on the Pope of Rome, you do believe to your utter condemnation, and except the
great mercy of God prevent not, you shall burn in Hell perpetually.

In his Prayer. -- O Lord my God, thou have written, He that will not forsake
wife, children, house, and all that ever he has, and take up his cross, and
follow thee, is not worthy of thee. Lord, thou know that I have forsaken all
to come unto thee. Lord, have mercy upon me, for unto thee I commend my Spirit,
and my soul does rejoice in thee.

Chrysostom.
Eudaxia the Emperess having sent him a very threatening message, he gave this
answer; Go, Clark' s first Volume of Lives, page 145.
tell her, Nil nisi peccatum timeo, I fear nothing but sin.

When she had procured his banishment, as he went forth of the City, he said,
None of these things trouble me; but I said within my self, if the Queen will,
let her banish me, the Earth is the Lords, and the fullness thereof, if she
will, let her cast me into the sea, I will remember Jonah; if she will, let her
cast me into a burning fiery Furnace, or among wild beasts, the three children
and Daniel were so dealt with; if she will, let her stone me, or cut off my
head, I have St. Stephen, and the Baptist my blessed Companions, if she will,
let her take away all my substance, Naked came I out of my Mothers womb, and
naked shall I return thither again.

He used to say the Devil's first assault is violent, resist that, and his
second will be weaker, and that being resisted, he proves a Coward.

Clarebachius.
I believe (said Adolphus Clarebachius) that there is not a merrier heart in
the world at this instant than mine is: Ward; page 159.
Behold, you shall see me die by that faith I have lived in.

Cobham.
See Sir John Oldcastle under the Letter ( O)

Clark.
When Roger Clark was sentenced, Fox, Vol. page 569.
he said with much vehemence, Fight for your God, for he has not long to
continue.

At the Stake he cried out to the people, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes
away the sins of the world.

Coligni.
Jasper Coligni, Fox, Vol. 3 page 57. Clarks Martyrology, etc. page 41. of his
life.
great Admiral of France, who was slain in the Massacre at Paris, August 24.
1572. being shot in the left Arm with two Bullets, and the fore singer of the
right hand broke off with a third; and being told by a Gentleman, that it was
to be feared the Bullets were poisoned, he said, All must be as it pleases God.

Seeing his Friends weep, which held his Arm whilst the Incisions were made, he
said, My Friends, why do you weep? I judge my self happy that bear these wounds
for the Cause of my God.

To Mr. Merlin, his Chaplain, he said, These wounds, my Friend, are Gods
blessings. The smart indeed is troublesome, but I acknowledge the will of my
Lord therein, and I bless his Majests, who has been pleased thus to honor me,
and to lay any pain upon me for his holy Names sake: Let us beg of him, that he
will enable me to persevere to the end.

Speaking concerning those that wounded him, I know assuredly (said he) that it
is not in their power to hurt me, No, though they should kill me, for my death
is a most certain passage to eternal life. N

When the Bloodhounds brake open the house where he lay wounded, he spoke
thus, I perceive what is a doing, I was never afraid of death, and I am ready
to undergo it patiently, for which I have long since prepared my self.

I bless God that I shall die in the Lord. -- I now need no longer any help of
man, therefore my friends get ye hence. -- The presence of God to whose
goodness I commend my soul is abundantly sufficiently for me.

Colver.
Sheep we are for the slaughter (said Francis Colver to his two Sons, Ward, pa.
163.
massacred together with himself) this is no new thing, let us follow millions
of Martyrs through temporal death unto eternal life.

Coo.
Roger C^^ being asked by the Bishop of Norwich, Fox, Vol. 3419.
whether he would not obey the Kings Laws, answered, As far as they agree with
the Word of God, I will obey them. Whether they agree with the Word of God or
no, we are bound to obey them (said the Bishop) though the King were an
Infidel; Coo replied, If Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego had so done,
Nebuchadnezzar had never confessed the Living God.

Constantine.
Being carried with other Martyrs in a Dung-Cart to the place of Execution,
Ward, pa. 154.
he spoke thus, Well, yet are we a precious odor, and a sweet savor to God in
Christ.

Cornford.
John Cornford one of the last five that suffered Martyrdom in Queen Mary's
days (when the Sentence should have been passed, Fox, Vol. 3. page 893.
and they should have been executed by the Papists) being moved in Spirit with
a vehement zeal for God, in the name of them all pronounced Sentence of
Excommunication against the Papists, in these words. -- In the Name of our Lord
Jesus Christ the Son of the most mighty God, and by the power of the holy
Spirit, and the authority of his holy and Apostolic Church, We do hereby give
into the hands of Satan to be destroyed, the bodies of those Blasphemers and
Heretics, that do maintain any error against his most holy Word, or do
condemn his most holy Truth for Heresy, to the maintenance of any false Church
or seigned Religion, so that by this thy just judgment against thy Adversaries,
thy true Religion may be known to thy great glory, and our comfort, and to the
edifying of all our Nation Lord Jesus, So be it. -- It is observable, that
within six days after this Excommunication Quen Mary died, and the tyranny of
all English Papists with her.

Conlogue.
Brethren and Sisters (said Peter Conlogue of Breda at the Stake) be you
always obedient to the Word of God, and fear not those that can kill the body,
Fox, Vol. 3. page 50.
for on the soul they can have no power; as for me I am now going to meet my
glorious Spouse the Lord Jesus Christ.

Cranmer.
When Dr. Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury was Excommunicated, he said,
Fox Vol. 3. page 92.
From this your Judgment and Sentence, I appeal to the just Judgment of God
Almighty, trusting to be present with him in Heaven, for whose presence in the
Altar I am thus condemned.

In his Letter to Mr. Wilkinson. Pa. 677.
-- The true Comforter in all distresses is only God through his Son Jesus
Christ. Whosoever has him has Comfort enough, although he were in a
Wilderness all alone. He that has twenty thousand in his company, if God be
absent, is in a miserable Wilderness. In him is all comfort, and without him is
none. Wherefore I beseech you seek your dwelling there, where you may truly and
rightly serve God, and dwell in him, and have him ever dwelling in you.

After he had recanted, and was brought to Saint Mary's Church in Oxford, where
Dr. Cole after he had preached bitterly against him, showing why he was to be
executed notwithstanding his Recantation, pressed him to evidence to the people
his conversion to Popery, Dr. Cranmer entreated the people to pray with him and
for him, that God would pardon his sins, especially his Recantation.

After he had prayed, he told them, Pa. 669.
It is a sad thing to see so many so much dote upon the love of this false
World, and be so careful of it, and so careless of Gods love, or the World to
come; therefore this shall be my first exhortation, that you set not your minds
overmuch upon this glozing World, but upon God, and the World to come, and to
learn to know what this Lesson means, which St. John teaches, That the Love
of this World is hatred against God. -- Let rich men consider and weigh three
Scriptures, Luke 18. It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
Heavin. 1 John 3. He that has the substance of this world, and sees his
Brother in necessity, and shuts up his mercy from him, how can he say that
he loves God? James 5.1, 2. Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for the
miseries that are coming upon you, your riches are corrupted. -- Another
exhortion is, That next under God you obey your King and Queen willingly and
gladly, without murmuring or grudging. They are Gods Ministers: Whosoever
resists them, resists the Ordinance of God. -- And now I come (said he) to
the great thing, that so much troubles my Conscience, more than any thing that
ever I did, or said, in my whole life, and that is the setting abroad a Writing
contrary to the Truth, which now here I renounce, and refuse as things written
with my hand contrary to the Truth which I thought in my heart, and written for
fear of death and to save my life if it might be.

And forasmuch as my hand offended, writing contrary to my heart, my hand shall
first be punished therefore, for may I come to the fire it shall be first
burned.

At the Stake, when the fire began to burn near him, he stretching out his arm
put his right hand into the flame, which he held so steadfast, that all men
might see his hand burned, before his body was touched.

His eyes lifted up to Heaven, he cried out even as long as he could speak, O
his unworthy hand!

His last words were the words of Stephen, Lord Jesus receive my spirit.

Cromwell.
Thomas Lord Cromwell, Earl of Essex, Fox, Vol. 2. page 529.
the morning that he was executed, having cheerfully eaten his breakfast,
passing out of the Prison down the Hill in the Tower, met the Lord Hungerford
going to Execution for other matter; and ^erceiving him to be heavy and
doleful, he willed him to be of good comfort; for if you repent (said he) of
what you have done, there is mercy enough for you with the Lord, who for
Christ's sake will forgive you; and though the breakfast we are going to be
sharp, yet trusting in the mercy of the Lord, we shall have a joyful dinner.

In his Prayer on the Seaffold. -- O Lord Jesus, Pa. 515.
who art the only health of all men living, and the everlasting life of them
which die in thee -- Being sure that the thing cannot perish; which is
committed to thy mercy, willingly now I leave this frail and wicked flesh, in
sure hope that thou will in better wise restore it to me again at the last day
in the resurrection of the Just -- I see and acknowledge there is in my self no
hope of salvation, but all my considence, hope, and trust is in thy most
merciful goodness. -- Thou, merciful Lord, wast born for thy sake did suffer
hunger and thirst for my sake, did teach, pray, and fast for my sake, all thy
holy actions and works thou wroughtest for my sake, thou sufferedst most
grievous pains and torments for my sake, and finally thou gave thy most
precious body and blood to be shed on the Cross for my sake; Now, most merciful
Savior, let all these things profit me, etc. -- Let thy blood cleanse and wash
away the sport and soulness of my sins, let thy righteousness hide and cover my
unrighteousness. --

Cyprian.
He went in the time of Persecution into voluntary Banishment, Clark's first
Volume of Lives. page 51. Leigh's Saints Encouragements in evil times. page 10.
lest (as he said) he should do more hurt than good to the Congregation.

When he heard the sentence pronounced against him, he said, I thank God for
freeing me from the Prison of this Body.

He said Amen to his own sentence of Martyrdom. The Proconsul bidding him
consult (...) it, he answered, In so just a Cause there needs no deliberation.

D.
Daigerfield.
William Daigerfield and Joan his Wise (who then gave (...) to her tenth child)
being imprisoned in several Prisons, Fox. Vol. 3^ page 759.
Bishop Brooks sent for the man, and told him, that his Wise had recanted, and
so perswathod him to recant, and so sent him to his Wife with a Form of
Recantation with him, which when his Wife say, her heart clave in sunder, and
she dried out, Alas! Husband, this long we have contributed one, and has Satan
so far prevailed with you, as to cause you to break the Vo^^, which you made to
God in Baptism. Hereupon (...) bewailed his promise, and begged of God that he
might not live so long as to call evil good, and good evil, light darkness, or
darkness light. And accordingly (...) to pass.

Damlip.
Mr. Adam Damlip, Fox, Vol. 2. page 564.
when he had been almost two years in the Marshalsey, considering how he could
not employ his talent there to God's Glory, as he desired (though he had many
Favors in Prison) resolved to write to the Bishop of Winchester, earnestly to
desire that he might come to his Trial; for (said he) I know the worst, I can
but lose my present life, which I had rather do, than here to remain, and nor
to be suffered to use my talent to God's Glory.

When he understood by the Keeper, that his suffering was near, he was
notwithstanding very mercy, and did eat his meat as well as over he did in all
his life, insomuch that some at the Board said unto him, they wondered how he
could eat his meat so cheerfully, knowing he was for near his death; Al Masters
(said he) Do you think that I have been so long God's Prisoner in the
Marshalsey, and have not yet learned to die? Yes, yes, and I doubt not but God
will strengthen me therein.

When he was told that his four Quarters should he hanged at four parts of
Calice, and his Head upon the Lanthern-gate, Then shall I not need (said he) to
provide for my Burial.

Dilos.
Alas (said James Delos to the Monks that called him proud Heretic) here I get
nothing but shame, Ward, page 1151.
I expect indeed preferment hereafter.

Denley.
Mr. John Denley being entreated by Bishop Bonner to recant, said, Fox, Vol. 3.
page 388.
God save me from your Counsel.

In the Fire, with the burning flame about him, he sung a Psalm, and having his
face hurt with a Faggot hurled at him, he left singing for a while, and clapped
his (...) in his bleeding face, and afterward put his hands abroad, and ^ung
again till he died.

Dionysius.
Dionystus Ar^pag^^a (who seeing the general Eclipse of the Sun at Christ's
death, Clarks first volume of Lives, p. 12.
said to one; Either the God of Nature now suffers, or the frame of the World
shall be dissolved; and to another, God unknown in the flesh does suffer.

When he was apprehended by Sisinius the Praesect, and sharply reproved for
preaching against the worship of their Gods, and required to confess his
error, said, That they were no gods, whom they worshipped, but Idols, the
works of men's hands, and that it was through mere ignorance, solly, and
idolatry, that they adored them; adding, that there was but one true God, as he
had preached.

After he was grievously tormented, he was brought before Sisinius the second
time, who sentenced him to be beheaded forthwith. Dyonisius told him, he
worshipped such Gods as would perish like Dung upon the Earth; but as for my
self (said he) come life, come death, I will worship none but the God of Heaven
and Earth.

He prayed thus at his death. O Lord God Almighty, thou only begotten Son, and
Holy Spirit; O Sacred Trinity, which are without beginning, and in whom is no
division, Receive the soul of thy Servant in peace, who is put to death for thy
Cause and Gospel.

He used to say, That he desired these two things of God (1) That he might know
the Truth himself, and (2) That he might preach it, as he ought, to others.

Driver.
Alice Driver in her first Examination, Fox, Vol. 3. page 886.
having got her Adversaries to acknowledge, that a Sacrament is a sign, and
that it was Christ's Body, his Disciples did eat the night before he was
crucified; Seeing it is (said she) a sign, it cannot be the thing signified;
and how could it be Christ's Body, that was crucified, seeing his Disciples had
eaten him up over night, except he had two Bodies.

At the end of her second Examination, Pa. 887.
She said; Have you no more to say? God be honored. You be not able to resist
the Spirit of God in me a poor Woman. I was an honest poor man's Daughter,
never brought up in the University, as you have been, but I have driven the
Plough before my Father many a time (I thank God) yet notwithstanding in the
desence of God's Truth, and in the Cause of my Mr. Christ, by his Grace I will
set my foot against the foot of any of you all, in the maintenance and defense
of the same; and if I had a thousand lives, they should go for payment thereof.

When she was tied to the Stake, Fox, Vol. 3 page 888.
and the iron Chain put about her neck, O (said she) here is a goodly
Neckerchief, blessed be God for it.

Drowry.
Thomas Drowry (the blind Boy, Fox, Vol. 3. page 703.
to whom Bishop Hooper, as he was going to the Stake, after he had examined
him, said; Ah poor Boy, God has taken from thee thy outward sight, but he has
given thee another sight much more precious: He that endued thy soul with the
eye of Knowledge and Faith.) Shortly after Bishop Hooper's Martyrdom, was cast
into Prison. Afterward the Chancellor of Gloucester asking him, who taught him
that Heresy, that Christ's Body was not really present in the Sacrament of the
Altar, he said, You, Mr. Chancellor, when in yonder Pulpit you taught us that
the Sacrament was to be received spiritually by Faith, and not carnally and
really, as the Papists teach. But (said the Chancellor) Do thou as I have done,
and thou shall live as I do, and escape burning. Though you (said Drowry) can
so easily dispense with your Conscience, and mock God and the World, yet will
not I do so. Then said the Chancellor, I will condemn thee; God's Will be
fulfilled (said Drowry.)

E.
Edward.
King Edward the Sixth (our English Josias) being pressed by Archbishop Cranmer,
Fox, Vol. 2. page 653.
and Bishop Ridl^y to permit the Lady Mary to have Mass in her House; after he
had argued notably against it, bid them be content, for he would spend his
life, and all he had, rather than to agree to, and grant that he knew certainly
to be against the Truth, and then fell a weeping, insomuch that the Bishop wept
as fast as he; and the Archbishop told Mr. Cheek, his Scholar had more Divinity
in his little finger, than all they had in all their Bodies.

Elizabeth.
The Lady Elizabeth (afterward Queen of England) when she came out of the Birge
at Traytor^ Stairs, Fox, Vol. 3. page 945.
going into the Tower, said, Here land^^ as true a Subject, being a Prisoner,
as ever lande^ at these Stairs. And before thee, O God, I speak it having no
other Friends but thee alone.

Her Gentleman Usher weeping, she demanded of him what he meant so
uncomfortably to use he, seeing she took him to be her Comfort, and not to
dismay nor, especially for that she knew her Truth to be such, that no man
should have cause to wee^ for her.

When the Doors of the Prison were locked and bolted upon her, she called for
her Book, desiring God, not to suffer her to build her foundation upon the
Sands, but upon the Rock, whereby all blasts of blustering weather should have
no power against her.

When she was locked up close in Prison, at first she was much daunted, but
afterward she brake forth into this Speech; The skill of a Pilot is unknown,
but in a Tempest; the valor of a Captain is unseen, but in a Battle; and the
worth of a Christian does not appear, but in time of Trial and Temptation. Mr.
Burrough's Mos. Self-denial, page 31.

Upon Gardeners and other Counselors strict Examination of her, she said, My
Lords, you do sift me very narrowly, but well I am assured, you shall not do
more to me than God has appointed, and so God forgive you all.

Some telling her, that they were persuaded God would not suffer Sir Henry
Benefield to make her away privately; Well, said she, God grant it be so; for
thou, O God, can mollify all such tyrannous hearts, and disappoint all such
cruel purposes; and I beseech thee to hear thy Creature, which am thy Servant,
and at thy Command, trusting by thy Grace ever so to remain.

As she passed over the Water to Richmond, going toward Windsor, in their
Journey to Woodstock, she espied certain of her old Servants standing on the
other side, very desirous to see her, and sent one of her men standing by unto
them; Go to them (said she) and say these words from me, Tanquam ovis, i. just
like a sheep to the slaughter.

At her departing from Woodstock she wrote these Verses with her Diamond in a
Glass Window. Much suspected by me,
Nothing proved can be,
Quoth Elizabeth Prisoner.

When a Popish Priest pressed her hard to declare her Opinion of Christ's
Presence in the Sacrament, Clarks second Volume of Livis.
she truly and warily answered him thus; 'Twas the Word that spoke it,
He took the Bread and brake it,
And what the word did make it,
That I believe, and take it.


Esch.
John Esch and Henry Voes (burnt at Bruxels 1523) being asked what they
believed, Fox, Vol. 2 p. 101, 102.
they said, The Books of the Old and New Testament. And being asked whether
they believed the Decrees of the Councils, and the Fathers, they said, Such as
agreed to the Scriptures they believed; and being asked whether it were any
deadly sin to transgress the Decrees of the Bishop of Rome, they said, That it
is to be attributed only to the Precepts of God, to bind the Conscience of
man, or to lose it.

Being condemned, they gave thanks to God their Heavenly Father, which had
delivered them through his great Goodness from that false and abominable
Priesthood (they having been Augustine Friars) and made them Priests of his
Holy Order, receiving them unto him as a Sacrifice of a sweet Odor.

The greatest Error that they were accused of, was that men ought to trust
only in God, forasmuch as men were liars, and deceitful in all their word, and
deeds; and therefore there ought no trust or affiance to be put in them.

The day of their Execution (said they) the day we have long desired.

One of them, seeing that the fire was kindled at his feet, said, Methinks you
do strew Roses under my feet.

Eulalia.
The Virgin Eulalia (of Emerita in Portugal) having secretly got out of her
Fathers house (where she was kept close for fear, Fox, Vol. 1. page 120.
least she should offer her self to Martyrdom) went courageously unto the
Tribunal, or Judgment Seat, and in the midst of them all, cried out, Would you
know what I am? Behold! I am one of the Christians, an enemy to your Divelish
Sacrifices, I spurn your Idols under my feet, I consess God omnipotent with my
heart and mouth. -- Go to thou Hangman, burn, cut, mangle thou these earthly
Members; it is an easy matter to break a brittle substance, but the inward
mind thou shall not hurt for any thing thou can do.

The Judge endeavoring to persuade her to recant, saying, Behold! what
pleasures thou may enjoy by the Honorable House thou came of; What! will thou kill thy self, so young a flower, (she being not much above twelve years
of age) and so near those Honorable Marriages and great Dowries thou may
enjoy? Eulalia did not answer him, but being in a great sury, spit in the
Tyrants face, threw down the Idols, and spurnt abroad with her feet the heap of
Incense prepared for the Censers. -- When one joint was pulled from another,
she said, Behold, O Lord, I will not forget thee; what a pleasure is it for
them, O Christ, that remember thy triumphant Victories, to attain unto these
high dignities.

F.
Fabrianus.
First better, Ward, pa. 160,
(said Christopher Fabrianus) the^ sweet; First the Battle, the Victory when I
am dead. Every drop of my blood shall preach Christ, and set forth his Praise.

Faninus.
Faninus an Italian kissed the Apparitor tha^ brought him word of his
Execution. Ward, page 155.


To one reminding him of his Children, he said I have left them to an able and
faithful Guardian.

To his Friends weeping, he said, That is we^ done, that you weep for joy with
me.

To one objecting Christ's agony and sadness t^ his cheerfulness: Yea (said he)
Christ was sad, tha^ I might be merry. He had my sins, and I have ^ merits and
righteousness.

To the Friars offering him a wooden Crucis^ he said, Christ needs not the
help of this Piece, (...) imprint him in my mind and heart, where he ha^ his
Habitation.

Farellus.
Mr. Clark 's first Volume of Lives, page 674.
William Farellus, being questioned by (...) Magistrates of Metis, by what
Authority, or (...) whose request he preached, answered, By ^ Command of
Christ, and at the request of ^ Members.

Farrar.
Mr. Fox, Vol. 3. page 216.
Richard Jones, coming to Dr. Robert Farr^ Bishop of St. David, a little before
his death, a^ seeming to lament the painfulness of the death he was to suffer,
the Bishop said to him, That if he saw him once to stir in the pains of his
Barning, he should then give no credit to his Doctrine. Accordly he never
moved, but even as he stood, holding up his stumps, so he continued still, till
Richard Gravel with a staff dashed him upon the head, and so struck him down.

Filieul.
John Filieul and Julian Leville (who suffered in France) being threatened if
they constantly persifted, to be burnt alive, The Mirror of Martyrs, page 595.
and to have their tongues cut out, or otherwise only to be strangled, and to
have the use of their tongues, contemned the offer, saying, You would fain have
us renounce our God for saving our selves from a little pain, but it shall not
be so; and looking one upon another, said, We are ready not only to lose one
or two of our Members, but the whole Body, and to be burned and burned again in
the defense of the Truth.

When the time of their execution came, Fox, Vol. 2. page 144.
the Officer put into their hands, being tied, a Wooden Cross, which they flung
away with their teeth, saying, That they were now to bear a more noble and
excellent Cross than that.

When their tongues were cut, God gave them utterance, insomuch that they were
heard to say, We bid Sin, the Flesh, the World farewell for ever, with whom we
shall never have to do hereafter.

At last when the Tormenter came to smear them with Brimstone and Gunpowder, Go
to (said Fii^lus) salt on, salt on the rotten and stinking flesh.

Fillula.
By these Lidders (said John Fillula to his Felows) we ascend the Heavens,
Ward, page 153.
now begin we to rample under feet, Sin, the World, the Flesh, and the Devil.

Filmer.
Henry Filmer said to Person and Testwood (his fellow Martyrs) Be merry my
Brethren, Fox, Vol. 2. page 555.
and lift up your hands to God, for after this sharp breakfast, I trust we
shall have a good dinner in the Kingdom of Christ our Lord and Redeemer.

Flower.
William Flower (alias Branch) being told his death was near, Fox, Vol. 3. page
242.
said, I hunger for the same, dear Friend, being sully ascertained that they
can kill but the body, which I am assured shall receive again life everlasting,
and see death no more.

Bishop Bonner persuaded him to recant, promimising him thereupon great things,
he answered, That which I have said I will stand to, and therefore I require
that the Law may proceed upon me.

At another time, Do what you will, I am at a point; for the Heavens shall as
soon fall, as I will forsake mine opinion.

In his Prayer. -- Have mercy upon me for thy dear Son our Savior Jesus
Christ's sake, in whom I confess only to be all salvation and justification,
and that there is none other mean, nor way, nor holiness, in which, or by which
any man can be saved in this World.

Burning in the fire, he cried out three times, O the Son of God have mercy
upon me, O the So^ of God receive my soul.

Folks.
Elizabeth Folks being examined, Fox, Vol. 3. page 832.
whether she believed the presence of Christ's Body to be in the Sacrament
substantially and really? answered, That she believed that that was a
substantial and real lie.

When Sentence of Condemnation was read against her, she kneeled down, listing
up her eye, and bands to Heaven, she praised God that ever she was born to see
that most blessed and happy day, that the Lord would count her worthy to suffer
for the testimony of Christ; and Lord, if it be thy will, forgive them that
have done this against me, for they know not what they do.

At the Stake she being hindered from giving her Petticoat to her Mother (who
kissed her, and exhorted her to be strong in the Lord) threw it away from her,
saying, Farewell all the World, farewell Faith and Hope; and so taking the Stake
in her hand, said, Welcome Love, etc.

When she and the other five that suffered with her, were nailed to the Stakes,
and the fire about them, they clapped their hands together for joy in the fire.

Fox.
The day after Queen Mary's death Mr. See his Life before his second Vol. of
Acts and Monum.
John Fox preaching at Basil to the English Exiles, did with confidence tell
them, That now was the time come for their return into England, and that he
brought that News by command from God.

The Lady Anne Hennage being given up for dead, He told her, she had done well
in fitting her self for death, but that she should not die of that Sickness;
and being blamed by her Son in Law for disquieting her mind with hopes of life,
He answered, that he had said no more than was commanded him; for it seemed
good to God that she should recover, and so she did.

Mrs. Honywood having been sick of a Consumption almost twenty years, was
scarce able to speak when Mr. Fox came to her, only faintly she breathed forth
a desire to end her days. Mr. Fox, after he had prayed with her, told her,
That she should not only grow well of that Consumption, but also so live to an
exceeding great age. As well might you have said (quoth Mrs. Honywood) that if
I should throw this Glass against the Wall, I might believe it would not break
to pieces; and holding a Glass in her hand, out of which she had newly drunk,
she threw it forth, but the Glass falling first on a Chest, and then on the
ground, neither brake nor cracked. Accordingly this eminent Christian
Gentlewoman being then Sixty years of age, recovered and lived till she was
above Ninety, and could reckon above three hundred and sixty of her Children
and Childrens Children.

He also foresaw his own death, and therefore sent away his sons that they
might not be present.

Frith.
Mr. Fox, Vol. 2. page 304.
John Frith with some others, (chosen into Christ's Church Oxford, whose
Foundation was laid by Cardinal Wolsey) conferring together upon the abuses of
Religion, then crept into the Church, were therefore accused of Heresy unto
the Cardinal, and cast into Prison, within a deep Cave under the ground of the
same College, where their salt F^sh was laid. Through the filthy stench
thereof they were all infected, and some took their death, but Mr. Frith was
wonderfully preserved; and was translated from that University (after many
miseries undergone both beyond Sea and in his own Land) to another School,
namely, to a more settled Discipline of affliction, the Tower of London; where,
as he remained a Patient in regard of the Persecution, which he suffered, so
did he also the office of a Physician, in prescribing to others Preparatives
and Remedies in the like case. To which end A. D. 1532. he employed his pen in
writing those Treatises, which now go under the name o^ (...) Pisces, or the
Book-Fish.

Concerning which (the Author of the Preface thereunto) observes, See the
preface to Vox Pisces, or the Book-Fish.
that in some sort they ran the Fortune of the Author, being held in captivity
in the Sea, and kept in Jonah's Prison, the belly of a Fish, being in danger
there to be consumed, as the Author was like to have perished in the Dungeon at
Oxford by the noisome stinch of Fish.

The Wine therein offered (says the same Author) is the purest juice of a
Grape of the Vine (Christ-Jesus) ^rod in the Wine Press of Persecution about an
hundred years sinde: It was found in the Maw of a Codfish in Cambridge Market,
1626. and Printed 1627.
Which being put in a Paper Vessel, and formerly miscarrying by wrack in the
transporting, is now beyond expectation in a strange Living Vessel brought back
again to Land, no doubt to the end, that it might after long lying hid in
store, be anew broached and dispersed abroad for the refreshing of many thirsty
souls; to whom it is like to taste not the worse, but the better for the long
lying in so salt a Cellar, as is the bottom of the Sea, wherein, by all
probability, it has been buried for many years.

Mr. Frith did not light his Candle at the Lamp of Mr. Calvin, which then was
not extant; nor of great Luther, who was then but in the beginning of his
growth. And yet (says the same Author) How judicously is there shown the use
of the Cross among Christians to consist in the due preparation for it, and
constant patience under it? How soundly are we taught that our Election and
Justification are of Gods mere mercy, and not for any thing foreseen in us? --
That remission of sins is through Christ only. -- That no man can merit for
others. -- That true Believers do sin, yet fall not away utterly from Christ.
-- As the Work commends the Author, so the Author much more the Work. When he
wrote of the Cross, he fought valiantly under the Cross; he turned his words of
patience into the perfect work of patience. He had the like happiness to that
of St. Paul, to bring forth children unto Christ in his bands. Whilst he was
kept close Prisoner in the Tower, by his Letters and Treatises he gained many
souls to Christ, and among others (which is most observable) he converted one
Rastal to the Truth, who had formerly dipped his Pen in Gall, and wrote most
bitterly against the Truth of the Gospel, and against the Writings of this
Prisoner of Christ, then in bands for the Gospel. Like a Swan he sang most
sweetly before his death, and foretold both particularly his own Martyrdom,
and the propagation of the Gospel through all England within twenty years after
his death; which accordingly came to pass in the Reign of King Edward. He was
as it were a Primrose in the new Spring of the Gospel: And though he wrote in
the twilight between the night of Popery, and the day of Reformation, yet God
so enlightened him, that his Treatise of the Sacrament, was the Candle at which
that great Torch Archbishop Cranmer was lighted, as Mr. Fox reports.

That is the true Cross (says Mr. A Prep. to the Cross. page 7, 8.
Frith in his Treatise called, A Preparation to the Cross) which God does lay
upon us -- For the Word of God to suffer all scorns, mocks, lies, and
persecutions, and not to fear the most cruel, yea even the most shameful death.
-- That we may be prepared to bear the true Cross, Page 13.
we must consider that no calamity falls on us by fortune or chance, but by
the counsel and appointment of God, Page 16. See also c. 13. of the Prep. l. 1.
as witnesses the holy Scripture. -- It is undoubtedly no small comsort to be
assured, that the Cross is of God, and that we are chastened of God, and not of
the Devil, or of any wicked man, who utterly can have no power upon us, not so
much as to move one hair of our head, beside the will of the Lord. -- But it is
not enough to consider that we are afflicted through the counsel and will of
God, A Prepar. pa. 27, 28.
but must moreover mark the cause and intent of his godly will; for reason
judges that we are punished, to the end to be hurt or destroyed, etc. but we
must forsake Reason, and cleave to the Word of God, which teaches that we
suffer affliction to our health and salvation; for afflictions are not signs of
wrath and displeasure, but of grace and favor. -- This is no small comfort to
them that bear the Cross, Page 33.
that they are not punished of the Lord to their hurt or destruction, but to
their health and salvation; and that their afflictions, poverty, etc. are not
signs of Gods wrath, but instruments by which God is glorified. -- When God
does afflict his people for their sins, he does not therefore afflict them,
Page 40.
that by their afflictions they should satisfy for their sins: for the passion
and suffering of Jesus Christ is the ransom and expiation of our sins; but
that by affliction he may bring sinners to repentance. -- When a Christian
sees himself forsaken of all men, Page 41, 42, 43.
he must pray, and not cease to pray, but pray in faith mistrusting nothing.
Psalm. 49.
-- God calls Invocation or crying on him in trouble, a Sacrifice, the true
and most acceptable honor. -- So likewise he ^alleth the Hope, whereby we
tarry his help in af^liction, Sacrifice. Psalm. 4.
Sacrifice you the sacrifice of Ju^tice, and hope ye in the Lord, q. d. that
Hope is (...) Sacrifice, whereby we yield justice to God, that ^seeing he has
so promised) he will pluck us out and deliver us, Page 59, 60, etc.
for so much as he is righteous and ^ue. -- Of patience to Godward, springs
forth patience toward men; for when the heart is at peace with God, it tarrieth
help of him, and utterly sets aside lust to revenge. -- Our reason is
therefore troubled and vexed in persecution, Page 66, 67, etc.
because it thinks that we are afflicted because God either hates us, or
does not regard us, neither will help us. These false opinions God plucketh
from us, and teaches us, that we are afflicted, not because he hates us, but
because he will either amend us, or when we be amended, continue us so. -- And
that in our affliction he will help us, and keep us, and also comfort us with
the Holy Ghost, and set our Conscience at peace, and make us be glad in God,
Page 69, etc.
etc. -- Christian patience has certain conditions, whereby it is known to be
true patience. (1) It grudgeth not, neither excuses it self, as though it
should suffer unworthily for his sins, wherefore he sits down and holds
his peace, as Jeremiah says. -- (2) It casts all carefulness on God, and
commits it self wholly to God, that Gods will be done and not his. (3) It
humbles himself, and casts off the pleasures of the World. A Prep. to the
Cross, Page 70.
(4) He is merry and ready to suffer yet more heavy and grievous evils. -- We
must look for help in all afflictions; for God promises his help, saying, I am
with you, Fear ye not, I will strengthen you. -- But the manner, Page 72.
time, and kind of help is unknown unto us, that Faith and Hope may have place,
which sticks to these things which are not seen nor heard. -- God delivere^^
when most need is, Page 76.
that his glory may shine the brighter. -- He will therefore help, Page 89.
when we be in ^ manner compelled to despair in all humane help, and when all
carnal counsel deceives us; for God only will be glorified. -- He does prolong
help for our utility and profit, Pa. 91.
that he might exercise and prove Faith by temptation, so that he only might
possess the title and name of Helper. -- He that believes makes not haste.
Page 92, 93.
He which yet seems a far off, shall appear at the end, and shall not lie:
although he tarry, yet look for him, for he is coming, and at the last he shall
come and shall not be slow. -- It is also a great comfort to them that be in
affliction, to remember that they have Christ, See cha. 12 of the Prep. to the
Cross, l. 1. and c. 12. l. 2. See p. 105.
and his Prophets, and Apostles, and all good and holy men for their examples
-- Furthermore, it is a great comfort to the godly, that the wicked (whom God
does use as a rod to scourge the godly) go not clear away without punishment,
whom he makes either shamefully ashamed, or through their own counsel he does
take them, and brings them into the same destruction, which they themselves
have studied and found out for others. -- The cause is, For he that hu^teth one
faithful, Pa. 109, 110.
wrongeth not only him, but God, who does revenge the injury and wrong done to
the faithful, as injury done to himself. -- He that touches you, touches the
apple of mine eye. -- Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me. -- If thou be
tempted concerning the Gospel, Pa. 136, etc.
or suffering persecution for the Gospel, think of these Scriptures, He that
receives not my Cross, and follows not me, is not worthy of me. If any man
will come after me, let him forsake himself, and take his Cross and follow me.
For he that will save his soul shall lose it. Contrariwise he that loses his
soul for my sake; shall find it. He that will confess me before men, I will
confess him before my Father. -- The Apostles rejoiced that they were counted
worthy. -- The Servant is not above his Lord: all they that will live godly in
Christ Jesus must suffer persecution. -- If thou must dye, and leave Wife and
Children and thy dear Friends, say, The Lord shall be their Defender; for God
both will, and is able to cherish mine, to nourish and defend them; for he is
the Father of the fatherless, and the Widows Husband. I forget things behind my
back, See also chap. 16. l. 2.
and endeavor my self to those things that are before my face. They that have
Wives, let them be as though they had none, and they that weep as though they
wept not. -- If Satan say thou must forsake the world, what then? Answer thou
contrariwise: I shall attain Heaven, For blessed are the dead that dye in the
Lord. All the world lies in wickedness. All that are born of God overcome the
world, and this is the victory which overcomes the world, our faith. All the
world shall perish with its lusts and desires. Love not the world, nor the
things of the world. We are strangers in this world, and citizens of Heaven. --
Ye sons of men, why love ye vanities, and seek lies? how long love you infancy
or childhood? --

-- The godly have most comfort; See p. 176, etc. of the Preparation, etc.
though in this life they be as sheep ordained to be flain, and seem forsaken
of God, etc. yet they do not despair, no not in death, but are sure they shall
pass through death to life eternal, etc. Also they have this comfort, that
their death is good and precious; they also know, that through Christ's death,
death is overcome and abolished, Pa. 180.
-- Christ by his death has changed their death into a sleep. -- Such as be at
the point of death, Pa. 184.
ought to take comfort and be strong, in that they know that they carry with
them both Letter and Token, which is Baptism, whereby their death is
incorporate with the death of Christ, and that it is not their death, so much
as the death of Christ. Wherefore let them surely trust, that they shall
overcome, as that death of Christ has overcome. Pa. 191.
Unto the godly it is a great comfort, that they know that death is not in the
power of Tyrants, nor put into the hand of any Creature, least they should be
much troubled, etc. they shall only die when it pleases the Lord. -- We
cannot live any longer than the Lord has appointed, and we shall not die, Pa.
193.
though we be in the greatest peril, and extreme jeopardy before our hour. --
Then wherefore should they fear death? Pa. 202.
they cannot live longer than God has appointed, nor die any sooner. -- It is
the comfort of the godly in all adversity, See page 205, etc.
that through the Grace of God, they shall be revived, and raised up, as well
the body as the soul; the souls to Justice, the bodies to Glory. This hope the
wicked have not, Pa. 223, 224.
etc. -- It is a great comfort that affliction shall not endure continually,
and the afflictions of this time are not worthy of the Glory which shall be
showed upon us. -- Our trouble, which is but temporal and light, works an
exceeding and eternal weight of Glory unto us, who look not on the things that
are seen, but on them which are not seen. --

If a man praise a very fool (says Mr. Frith in his Preface to his Mirror)
and think his wit good and profound, he is indeed more fool than the other.
Thus seeing man praises and commends riches, honor, etc. and such other vain
and transitory things, which are but as a dream, and vanish like a flower of
the field; when a man should have most need of them, he himself is more vain
than those things which are but vanity.

If God has opened the eyes of thy mind (says the Mirror it self) and have
given thee Spirit and W^sdome through the knowledge of his Word, See the glass
to know thy self, p. 13. 14, etc.
boast not thy self of it, but rather fear and tremble, for a chargeable Office
is committed unto the^, which (if thou fulfill it) is like to cost thee thy life
at one time or other, with much trouble and persecution: but if thou fulfill it
not, then shall the Office be thy Damnation. For St. Paul says, W^ is to me if
I preach not. And by the Prophet Ezeki^ God says, If I say unto the wicked
that he shall die t^ death, and thou show him not of it, the wicked shall (...)
in his iniquity, but I shall require his blood at thy hand. But peradventure
our Divines would expound these Texts only of them that are sent and have cure
of souls. Whereunto I answer, That every man that has the light of Gods Word
revealed unto him, is sent wheresoever he sees necessity, (...) has the cure
of his Neighbors soul, e. g. If God has given me my sight, and I perceive a
blind man going in the way, which is ready for lack of fight to fall into a
pit, wherein he would likely perish, I am bound by Gods Command to guide him
till he be past that jeopardy, or else if he perish therein, his blood shall be
required at my hands. Thus if I perceive my Neighbor like to perish for lack
of Christ's Doctrine, then am I bound to instruct him with the knowledge God
has given me, or else his blood shall be required at my hand. Peradventure
they will say, that there is already one appointed to watch the Pit, etc. and
therefore I am discharged and need take no thought. Whereunto I answer, I would
be glad that so it were; notwithstanding if I perceive that the Watchmen be
asleep, or run to the Alehouse, etc. and through his negligence espy my
Neighbor in danger of the Pit, then am I nevertheless bound to lead him from
it. I think that God has sent me at that time to save that soul from
perishing, and the Law of God and Nature that binds me thereunto, which
charge me to love my Neighbor as my self, Hag. 1.
to do unto him as I would be done unto. -- If God has given thee riches, etc.
thou art yet the very owner of them, but God is the Owner, who says by the
Prophet, Gold is mine, and silver is mine, and he has for a season made thee a
Steward of them, to see whether thou will be faithful in the distribution of
them, according to his Commands. -- Our spiritual Possessionaries are double
Thieves and Murderers, as concerning the body, besides their murdering of the
soul, for lack of Gods Word, which they will neither preach, or suffer any
other to do it purely, but persecute them, and put them unto most cruel death:
First, they are Thieves and Murderers, because they distribute not what they
have from charitable Forefathers, to the intent it should have been ministered
unto the Poor, but upon Horses, Coaches, etc. gorgeous apparel, and delicate
fare, etc. Thus they defraud the Poor of their bread, and so are Thieves; and
(because this bread is their life) they are Murderers also. -- Besides they
are Thieves and Murderers for withdrawing their perfect Members from labor,
whereby they might minister unto their Neighbors necessities (I speak of as
many as are not occupied about preaching Gods Word.)

Besides these and many other Treatises, he wrote also several choice Letters,
whilst he was Prisoner in the Tower.

In his Letter to the faithful Followers of Christ's Gospel, See his Works, page
81, 82.
he thus expresses himself. --

It cannot be expressed, Dearly Beloved in the Lord) what joy and comfort it is
to my heart to perceive how the Word of God has wrought, and continually
works among you; so that I find no small number walking in the ways of the
Lord, according as he gave us Commandment, willing that we should love each
other, as he loved us. Now have I experience of the says which is in you, and
can testifie^ that it is without simulation, that ye love not i^ word and
tongue only, but in deed and truth. What can be more trial of a faithful
heart, than t^ adventure not only to aid and succor by the means of other
(which without danger may not be admitted unto us) but also personally to visit
the Poor oppressed, and see that nothing be lacking unto them, but that they
have both ghostly comfort and bodily sustenance, notwithstanding the strait
inhibition and terrible meancing of these worldly Rulers, even ready to abide
the extremest jeopardies that Tyrants can imagine. This is an evidence that
you have prepared your selves to the Cross of Christ, according to the Counsel
of the Wise man, which says, My Son, when thou shall enter into the way of the
Lord, prepare thy self unto tribulation. This is an evidence that you have cast
up your accounts, and have wherewith to finish the Tower, which ye have begun
to build: and I doubt not but he that has begun this work in you, shall for
his Glory accomplish the same, even unto the coming of the Lord, which shall
give unto every man according to his deeds. And albeit God of his secret
Judgments for a time keep the rod from some of them that ensue his steps, yet
let them surely reckon upon it; for there is no doubt, but all which will live
devoutly in Christ must suffer persecution; for whom the Lord loves he
corrects, and chasteneth every child that he receives. -- If ye be not under
correction, of which we are all partakers, then are ye bastards, and not
children. Nevertheless we may not suppose that our most loving Father should do
that, because he rejoices in our blood or punishment, but he does it for our
singular profit, that we may be partakers of Holiness, and that the remnants of
sin, which (through the frailty of our Members) rebel against the Spirit and
Will, causing our works to go unperfectly forward, and may some deal be
suppressed, least they should subdue us and reign over us. -- Of these things
God had given me the speculation before, and now it has pleased him to put in
ure and practice upon me. I ever thought, yea and do think, that to walk after
Gods Word, would cost me my life at one time or another; and although the Kings
Grace should take me into his Favor, and not suffer the bloody Edomites to
have their pleasures upon me, yet will I not think that I am escaped, but that
God has only deserred it for a season, to the intent that I should work
somewhat that he has appointed me to do, and so to use me to his Glory. And I
beseech all the faithful followers of the Lord to arm themselves with the same
supposition, marking themselves with the sign of the Cross, not from the Cross
as the superstitious multitude do, but rather to the Cross, in token that they
be ever ready willingly to receive the Cross, when it shall please God to lay
it upon them. The day that it comes not, count it clear won, giving thanks to
the Lord who has kept it from you, and then when it comes, it shall nothing
dismay you; for it is no new thing, but that which you have continually looked
for. And doubt not but that God, who is faithful, will not suffer you to be
tempted above what you are able to bear, but shall ever send some occasion by
the which ye shall stand steadfast, for either he shall blind the eyes of your
enemies, and diminish their Tyrannous Power, or else when he has suffered them
to do their best, and that the Dragon has cast a whole flood of waters after
you, he shall cause even the Earth to open her mouth, and swallow them up. So
faithful is he and careful to ease us, when the vexation shall be too heavy for
us, he shall send a Joseph before you, against ye shall come into Egypt; yea he
shall so provide for you, that ye shall have an hundred Fathers for one, an
hundred Mothers for one, an^ hundred Houses for one, and that in this life, as
I have proved by experience, and after this life everlasting joy with Christ
our Savior. Notwithstanding since this steadfastness comes not of our selves
(as St. Austin says) there was never man so weak or frail, no not the greatest
offender that ever lived, but that every man of his own nature should be as
frail, and commit as great enormities, except he were kept from it by the
Spirit and Power of God. I beseech you, Brethren in the Lord Jesus Christ, to
pray with me, that we may be Vessels to his laud and praise, what time soever
it pleases him to call upon us. The Father of Glory give us the Spirit of
wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, and lighten the eyes of our mind, that we
may know his ways, praising the Lord eternally. -- Amen.

John Frith the Prisoner of Jesus Christ, at all times abiding his pleasure.


In his Letter to his Friends concerning his troubles. Fox, Vol. 2. page 306.
-- I doubt not, dear Brethren, but that it does some deal vex you, to see the
one part to have all the words, and freely to speak what they list, and the
other to be put to silence, and not to be heard indifferently; but refer your
matter^ unto God, who shortly shall judge after another fashion.

The Archbishop of Canterbury having sent one of his Gentlemen, Fox, Vol. 3
page 990, 991.
and one of his Porters to fetch Mr. John Frith out of the Tower to be
examined; The Gentleman pitying him, endeavored to persuade him to relent to
Authority, and to give place for a time, and not to cast himself away, and
suffer all his singular gifts to perish with him with little profit to the
world, etc. Mr. Frith gave him thanks for his good will, but told him farther,
thus, My Cause and Conscience is such, that in no wise I either may or can for
any worldly respect without danger of damnation start aside, etc. I I be
demanded what I think of the Supper of the Lord, otherwise called the Sacrament
of the Altar, I must needs say my Knowledge and my Conscience, though I should
presently lose twenty lives, if I had so many. -- And if I may be indifferently
heard, I am sure mine Adversaries cannot condemn me or mine Assertion, etc. Yea
marry, quoth the Gentleman, you say well, if you might be indifferently heard;
but I much doubt thereof, for that our Master Christ was not indifferently
heard, neither should be (as I think) if he were now present again in the
world, etc. Well, well, (quoth Frith unto the Gentleman) I know very well that
the Doctrine of the Sacrament, which I hold and have opened, contrary to the
Opinion of this Realm, is very hard meat to be digested, both of the Clergy and
Laity: but this I will say to you, That if you live but tweny years more, you
shall see this whole Realm of mine Opinion, etc. and if it come not to pass,
then account me the vainest man that ever you heard speak with a tongue. -- All
things well and rightly pondered, my death in this Cause (which is Gods and not
mine) shall be better unto me and all mine, than life in continual bondage and
misery. The Gentleman was so wrought upon, that he contrived a way for Mr.
Frit^'s escape, and prevailed with the Porter to agree with him in the
suffering thereof, and then told him, that the business which he had
undertaken, viz. to lead him as a sheep to the slaughter, so grieved him, that
he was overwhelmed with care^ and sorrows; whereupon he was resolved, what
danger soever he incurred, to find out a way to deliver him out of the Lions
mouth, and so acquainted him with the way that he and the Porter had agreed
upon. Mr. Frith having diligently hearkened to his Speech, said with a smiling
countenance, And is this the effect of your secret consultation, all this
while, surely you are like to lose your labor, for if you should both leave me
here, and go to Croydon, declaring to the Bishops that you ha^ lost Frith, I
would surely follow after as fast as I could, and bring them news that I had
found an^ brought Frith back again. Do you think that I am afraid to declare
mine Opinion before the Bishop^ in so manifest a Truth? You are a fond man
(said the Gentleman) thus to talk. Do you think that your reasoning with the
Bishops will do any good. I much marvel that you were so willing to fly the
Realm before you were taken, and now so unwilling to save your self when you
may. Marry (says Frith) there is a great difference between escaping then and
now, then I was at liberty, and not attached; but now being taken by the Higher
Powers, and that by Almighty Gods permission and providence, I am fallen into
the Bishops hands only for Religions sake, and for such Doctrine, ^ I am bound
in conscience under pain of damnation to maintain. If I should now start aside,
and run away, I should run from my God, and from the testimony of his Word,
whereby I should deserve a thousand hells.

At the time of his burning Dr. Fox, Vol. 2. page 310.
Cook admonished all the people, that they should no more pray for him, then
they would do for a Dog. Whereupon Mr. Frith smiling, desired the Lord to
forgive him.

Fulgentius.
An Arian Bishop offering to punish the Priest that had most mercilesly beaten
him, Clarks first volume of Lives, p. 167, etc.
if he desired it, he said, It is not lawful for a Christian to meditate
revenge, our Lord Christ well knows how to repay the injuries offered to, and
inflicted on his Servants. If my case be avenged, then lose I the reward of my
patience. It may also scandalize many little ones, if I a Catholic should
require judgment at an Arians hands.

In the midst of his greatest sufferings he used to say, Plura pro Christo
toleranda, We must suffes more than this for Christ.

G.
Gardener.
William Gardener, Fox, Vol. 2. page 746.
an English Merchant in Portugal, was so much troubled in spirit at the sight
of the Idolatry, committed by the Priests in the Mass, at the solemnization of
the Marriage between the King of Portugal's Son, and the King of Spain's
Daughter, that he could not be quiet, till he had (though in the presence of
the King, and of the Nobles, and whole City) the next Sabbath with one hand
snatched away the Cake from the Priest, and trod it under his feet, and with
the other overthrew the Chalice. The King asking him how he durst be so bold?
He answered, Most noble King -- The thing which you have seen, was not done,
nor thought of me for any contumely, or reproach to your presence, but only
for this purpose (as before God I do clearly confess) to seek the salvation of
this people.

Being asked who set him on? He answered, He was not moved by any man, but by
his own Conscience, there being no man under Heaven, for whose sake he would
put himself into so manifest a danger, but he owed his service first to God,
and secondarily to their salvation; wherefore if he had done any thing
displeasing to them, they ought to impute it to themselves, who so irreverently
used the Sacrament of the Lords Supper unto so great Idolatry, not without
great ignomony to the Church, violation of the Sacrament, and the peril of
their own souls, except they repented.

For this he was cruelly tormented, and burned, and in the fire he sung Psalm.
43. Judge me, O God, and defend my cause against the unmerciful people.

Gauderin.
Christopher Gauderin, Fox, Vol. 3. Cont. 49.
having been a Spend thrist, was converted by Lewis Stallins, telling him, That
he ought rather to distribute of his geitings to the poor, then to spend them
so wastfully; for if he continued so, God would surely call him to an account
for it, insomuch that he was chosen a Deacon in the Church; in the execution of
which Office, he was taken and imprisoned, and being asked how he came to turn
Heretic, seeing he learned not that of his Master the Abbot, he answered, I am
no Heretic, but a right believing Christian, which he taught me not indeed,
but rather, other vile qualities, which I am ashamed now to rehearse.

Some objecting to him his youth, being about the age of thirty, He told them,
That man's life consisted but of two days, viz. the day of his birth, and the
day of his death. And for my part (said he) I am now willing by death to pass
into eternal life.

The morning that he was to be executed, He said to his Fellow Prisoners
(having put on a clean shirt, and washed himself) Brethren, I am now going to
be married, I hope before noon to drink of the wine of the Kingdom of Heaven.

A Friar coming to them (as he said) to convert them; Christopher said unto
him, Away from us, thou seducer of Souls, for we have nothing to do with thee.

One of his Fellow Sufferers (as the H^ngman was gagging him) said, What, shall
we not have liberty in this our last hour to praise our God with our voice and
tongue. Brother (said Gauderin) let not this discourage us, for the greater
wrong our enemies think to do unto us, the more assistance we shall find from
God, And so he never ceased to comfort them, till he was gagged also, and burnt
June 2. 1568.

Gerard.
About the year 1160. Clarks Martyrolegy page 41.
in the reign of Henry the Second, came about thirty Waldenses into England,
Gerardus being their Minister, to labor to win Disciples to Christ. They were
converted before a Council of Bishops at Oxford, and Gerard speaking for them
all, said, We are Christians, holding and reverencing the Doctrine of the
Apostles. -- Being urged with arguments against their Doctrine, they answered,
They believed as they were taught by Gods Word, but would not dispute their
faith. -- Being admonished to repent, and threatened if they did not, they
despised their Counsel, scorned their threats, saying, Blessed are they that
suffer persecution for righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

They were excommunicated, burnt in the foreheads for Heretics, Mr. Gerard
both in the forehead and cheek, their clothes were cut off to their Girdles,
and so whipped through Oxford, they singing all the while, Blessed are ye when
men hate you, and despitefully use you, etc.

Ghest.
Laurence Ghest had his wife and seven children brought to him (the Bishop
hoping to overcome him by his natural affection to them) and his wise beginning
to exhort him to favor himself, Fox, Vol. 1. page 1012.
He desired her not to be a block in his way, for that he was in a good course,
running toward the mark of his salvation.

Gibson.
Some of the Articles exhibited against Mr. Richard Gibson. Fox, Vol. 3 page
858.
Richard Gibson. -- (3) That he has commended, allowed, defended, and liked
both Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, and all other Heretics here in this Realm of
England, according to the Ecclesiastical Laws condemned for Heretics, and also
liked their Opinions. (4) That he has comforted, aided, assisted, and
maintained both by words and otherwise, Heretics and erroneous Persons, or at
the least suspected, and infamed of Heresies, etc. (5) That he has affirmed
that the Religion now used in this Realm, is in no wise agreeable to Gods Word
and Commandment, etc.

The Bishop asking him, if he knew any cause why the Sentence should not be
read against him, he said, Pa. 859.
the Bishop had nothing wherefore justly to condemn him. Sentence being read,
He again admonished Gibson to remember himself, and so save his soul. Mr.
Gibson answered, That he would not hear the Bishops babbling, boldly protesting
that he was contrary to them all in his mind, though he aforetime kept it
secret, for fear of the Law. And speaking to the Bishop, he said, Blessed am I,
that am cursed at your hands, We have nothing now, but thus will I; for as the
Bishop says, so it must be. And no heresy is it to turn the truth of Gods
Word into lies, and that do you.

Mr. Gibson also propounded Nine Articles to Bonner, by him to be answered by
yea or nay, or else by saying he could not tell (1) Whether the Scriptures of
God, written by Moses and other holy Prophets of God through faith, that is in
Christ Jesus, be available Doctrine, to make all men in all things unto
salvation learned, without the help of any other Doctrine, or no? (3) Whether
the holy Word of God, as it is written, does sufficiently teach all men, of
what dignity, estate, or calling by Office whatsoever he or they be, their
full, true, and lawful duty in their Office? and whether every man -- be found
upon the pain of eternal damnation, in all things to do, as he is thereby
taught and commanded, and in no wise to leave undone any thing that is to be
done, being taught and commanded by the same? (4) Whether any man (the Lord
Jesus Christ, God and man only except) by the holy Ordinance of God, ever was,
is, or shall be Lord over Faith? (5) By what lawful Authority or Power any man
of what Dignity, Estate, or Calling soever he or they be, may be so bold as to
alter or change the holy Ordinances of God, or any of them, or any part of
them? (6) By what evident tokens Antichrist in his Ministers may be known,
seeing it is written, That Satan can change himself into the similitude of an
Angel of Lignt, and h^s Ministers fashion themselves, as though they were
Ministers of righteousness? (7) What the Beast is, which makes war with the
Saints of God? and what the gorgeous and glittering Whore is, which fitteth
upon the Beast. --

Gilby.
Mr. Anthony Gilby, See Mr. Gilby' s Admonition to england and Scotland to call
them to repentance, Printed at Geneva, 1558. page 59.
an exiled Minister of Christ in Queen Mary's days, in his Admonition speaks
thus. -- Whereas many have written many profitable Admonitions to you twain (O
England and Scotland, both making one Island most happy, if you could know your
own happiness) -- and others with Pen and Tongue, with Word, with Writing, with
jeopardy and loss of Lands, Goods, and Lives, have admonished you both twain of
that cankered poison of Papistry, that ye foster and pamper to your own
perdition and utter destruction of your selves and yours, souls and bodies, for
now and ever. I thought it my duty (seeing your destruction to man's judgment
to draw so near) how much or how little soever they have prevailed, Page 60.
yet once again to admonish you both to give testimony to that truth, which my
Brethren have written, and especially to stir your hearts to repentance, or at
the least to offer my self a witness against you, for the justice of God, and
his righ^eous judgments, which doubtless (if your hearts be hardened) against
you both are at hand to be uttered. Thus by our writing, whom it pleases God
to stir up of your Nations all men that now live, and that shall come after us,
shall have cause also to praise the mercy of God, that so often admonishes
before he strikes, and to consider his just punishment, when he shall pour
forth his vengeance, Give ear therefore betimes, O Britain (for of that name
both rejoices) whilst the Lord calls, exhorts, and admonishes: that is
the acceptable time, when he will be found. If ye resuse the time offered, ye
cannot have it afterward, though with tears (as did Esau) ye do seem to seek
it. Yet once again in Gods behalf I do offer you the very means, which if God
of his mercies grant you grace to follow, I doubt nothing, but that of all your
enemies speedily ye shall be delivered. Ye rejoice at his Word, I am sure, if
ye have any hope of the performance. Then hearken to the matter which I write
unto you, not forth of men's Dreams and Fables, nor forth of profane Histories,
painted wi^h man's wisdom, vain eloquence, or subtle reasons, but forth of the
infallible Word of God. -- Is not this Gods curse and threatening (amongst many
others) pronounced against the sinful Land and disobedient people? Deuteronomy. 28.
That strangers shall devour the fruit of thy Land, and be above thee, etc. and
thy strong walls wherein thou trusted, shall be destroyed, etc. And does not
Isaiah reckon this also as the extremity of all plagues, for the wickedness of
the people to have women raised up to rule over them? Isa. 3.
But what says the same Prophet in the beginning of his prophecy, for a
remedy against these and all other evils, Pa. 61.
Your hands are full of blood (says he) O ye Princes of Sodom and people of
Gomorrah; but wash you, make you clean, take away your wicked thoughts forth of
my sight, cease to do evil, learn to do well, etc. Then will I turn my hand to
thee, and purge out all thy dross, and take away thy tynne, and I will restore
thy Judges as aforetime, and Counselors as of old. And Moses said before in
the place alleged, That if thou will hear the voice of the Lord thy God, Deuteronomy.
2^.
and do his Commandments, thou shall be blessed in the Town, and blessed in the
Field. The Lord shall cause thine enemies, that rise up against thee, to fall
before thee, etc. Lo the way in few words, O Britany, to win Gods favor, and
therefore to overcome thine enemies. But to print this more deeply upon your
hearts, O ye Princes and people of that Island, whom God has begun to punish,
seek (I warn you) no shifting holes to excuse your faults, no political
practices to resist Gods vengeance. -- Submit your selves to him, Page 62.
who holds your breath in your nostrils, who with one blast of his mouth can
destroy all his enemies. Embrace his Son Christ, and repent betimes for your
obstinacy against him and his Word, and for your cruelty against his Servants.
Repent, repent. For repentance is the only way of your redress and
deliverance. -- Consider how the Lord has entreated Israel and Juda, his own
people, how often they trespassed, and how he gave them over into the hands of
their enemies: But whenever they repented and turned again to God
unfeignedly, he sent them Judges and Deliverers, Kings and Saviors. -- Noah
pronounces, that within a hundred and twenty years all flesh should be
destroyed. We have many Noah's, that so cry in our times, yet no man repents.
All the time that Noah was preparing for the Ark to avoid Gods vengeance, the
multitude derided this holy Prophet, as the multitude of your two Realms does
at this day deride all them that by obedience to Gods Word seek the means
appointed to avoid Gods judgments. Then the people would not repent, Page 63.
but as if they should live for ever they married, they banqueted, they
builded, they planted, deriding Gods messenger. Do not you the like? I appeal
to your own consciences. The Lord calls to fasting (says the Prophet Isaiah)
to mortify themselves, and kill their lusts, but they kill Sheep and Bullocks.
Jeremy cries for tears and lamentation; They laugh and mock. Malachi cries to
the people of his time, Turn unto me, and I will turn unto you, says the Lord
of Hosts, and they proudly answer, Wherein shall we turn? Are ye not such? Do
you not ask, Wherein shall we turn, when ye will not know your sins? Ye will
not confess and acknowledge your faults, though ye go a whoring in every
Street, Town, and Village with your Idols: though the blood of the oppressed
cry every where against you for vengeance. So that seeing no token of
repentance, I cannot cry unto you with John Baptist, O ye generation of vipers,
who has taught you to fly from the wrath to come? -- But I will wound you no
more with the words of the Prophets, Page 64.
or of this holy Saint of God John Baptist, but with our Savior Christ's two
most sweet parables of the two Sons and of the Tilmen, to whom he set his
vineyard, I will labor to set before your eyes your rebellion, hypocrisy, and
cruelty, if so I can bring any of you to repentance. -- He has called you by
his Word many a time to work in his vineyard. I ask, what you have answered.
Some of you have said plainly, like rebellious children, That ye would not do
it, that ye would not work in your Fathers vineyard. Shall I apply this part to
Scotland? Scotland was indeed called most plainly and evidently through the
mercies of God both by their own faithful Countrymen, Page 65.
and also by earnest travel of our English Nation to come into the Lords
vineyard in the time of King Edward the Sixth, but refused. That time (as ye
know) the vineyard in England by the children of God was not altogether
neglected, and then most earnestly were ye (O Brethren of Scotland) required to
join hands with us in the Lords work, but Satan alas would not suffer it. His
old fostred malice, and Antichrist his Son, could not abide, that Christ should
grow so strong by joining that Isle together in perfect Religion, etc. Jest
this one Island should become a safe Sanctuary (as it began to be) to all the
persecuted in all places. -- God has also by the blood of his Saints, shed
amongst you, by favor and friendship, by war and the sword, yea by famane and
pestilence, and also by all other means called you to labor in his vineyard;
but to this day alas! we hear not of your humble obedience, but still ye say
with stubborn faces, We will not labor, we will not be bound to such thraldom,
etc. Yet think perchance I am too sharp, and that I accuse you more than you
deserve; for amongst you many do know the will of your Father, and many make
profession of his Gospel, but consider, Brethren, that it is not enough to know
the Commandment, and to profess the same in mouth, b^t it is necessary, that ye
refuse your selves, your own pleasures, appetites, and your own wisdom, if ye
shall be judged faithful laborers in the Lords vineyard, and that ye bear the
burdens together with your Brethren, and suffer heat and sweat, before ye
taste the fruits with them. God will not be content, that ye look over the
Hedge, and behold the labors of your Brethren, but he requires that ye put
your hands also to the labors, that ye travel continually to pluck up all
unprofitable weeds, though in so doing the Thorns prick you to the bone; that
ye affist your Brethren in their labors, though it be with the jeopardy of
your lives, the loss of your substance, and displeasure of the whole earth. --
I must needs leave thee, Page 68.
O Scotland, after I have advertized thee of this, that thou follow not the
example of England, but let thy reformation be full and plain, according to
Gods holy Will and Word, without addition. Let all the plaints, which thy
Heavenly Father has not planted, be rooted out at once. Let not avarice blind
thee, nor worldly wisdom discourage thy heart; let none bear the name of a
Teacher, that is known to be a Fosterer of Superstition, or any kind of
wickedness. -- Thus must thou, O Scotland, repent thy former inobedience, if
that thou will be approved of the Lord. And now do I return to thee O England,
I do liken thee to the second Son in the Parable, which answered his Father
with flattering words, saying, I go Father, but yet he went not at all. For
since the time I had any remembrance, our Heavenly Father, of his great mercies
has not ceased to call thee into his Vineyard, and to these late days thou
have always said, That thou would enter and be obedient. In the time of
King Henry the Eighth, when by Tyndal, Frith, Bilney, and other his faithful
Servants, God called England to dress his Vineyard, many promised full fair,
but what fruit followed, nothing but bitter grapes, yea, briars and brambles,
the wormwood of avarice, the gall of cruelty, the poison of filthy fornication
flowing from head to foot, the contempt of God, and open defense of the
Cake-idol, by open Proclamation to be read in the Churches, instead of Gods
Scriptures. -- It grieveth me to write these evils of my Country, Page 70.
save only that I must needs declare what fruit were found in the Vineyard,
after you promised to work therein, to move you to Repentance, and to justify
Gods Judgments, how grievously soever he shall plague you hereafter. Wherefore
I desire you to call to remembrance your best state under King Edward, when all
men with general consent promised to work in the Vineyard, and ye shall have
cause I doubt not to lament your wickedness, that so contemned the voice of God
for your own lusts, for your cruelty, for your covetousness, that the name of
God was by your vanities evil spoken of in other Nations. -- God grant you all
repentant hearts, for no order or state did any part of his duty in those
days. But to speak of the best, whereof you use to boast, your Religion was
but an English Mattins, patched forth o^ the Popes portess. Many things were in
your great Book superstitious and foolish, all were driven to a present
service, like the Papists, that they should think their duties discharged, if
the number were said of Psalms and Chapters. Finally, there could no Discipline
be brought into the Church, nor correction of manners. Page 71.
-- To what contempt was Gods Word, and the admonition of his Prophets come in
all estates before God did strike, some men are not ignorant. The Preachers
themselves for the most part could find no fault in Religion, but that the
Church was poor, and lacked living. -- Sure many things should have been
reformed, before that the Kitchen had been better provided for our Prelates in
England. It was most evident that many of you under the cloak of Religion,
served your own bellies; some were so busy to heap benefice upon benefice,
some to labor in Parliament for purchasing of Lands, that the time was small,
which could be found for the Reformation of abuses, and every little that was
spent upon the feeding of your flocks. -- In a word, the Gospel was so lightly
esteemed, that the most part of men thought rather that God should bow and
stoop to their appetites, than that they should be subject to his holy
Commandments. -- Even the Nobility and Council would suffer no rebukes of Gods
Messengers, though their offenses were never so manifest; let those that
preached in the Court, the Lent before King Edward deceased, speak their
conscience, and accuse me if I lie; yea, let a writing of Northumberland's to
Mr. Harlow be brought to light, and it shall testify, that he was not ashamed
to say, That the liberty of the Preachers tongues would cause the Council and
Nobility to rise up against them, for they could not suffer so to be entreated.
These were the fruits in the time of Harvest, a little before the Winter came,
and of the time of Mary what should I write? It has cast off the Truth known,
and confessed; and follows lies and errors, which once it detested. Page 72.
It builds the building which once it destroyed; it raises up the idols,
which once were there confounded. -- They persecute, they banish, they burn
Christ the Son of God in his members. Page 73.
-- But to be short, this only remains for both these Nations, that they
repent, and return into the Vineyard, with the first Son, and bring forth the
fruits of Repentance. The fruits of Repentance I call not only to know your
sins, and to lament them, but to amend your lives, and to make strait the Lords
paths by resisting Satan and Sin, and obeying God in doing the works of
righteousness, and executing Gods precepts and Judgments, so long amongst you
contemned, Mat. 3.
for even now is the Axe put to the root of the tree, etc. The Lord has now
his Fan in his hand, and will purge his floor, etc. Repent there ore whilst you
have time, before you be fanned, hewn down, and fired. Page 74.
-- Here have we to lament the miserable state of mankind, which is so seduced
by the subtle Serpent, that he cannot know his misery, when he is admonished,
nor perceive his perdition, when it draws so near. When the Servants of God
set forth his Truth, they are charged to trouble Realms and Countries, as was
Elias, when they warn men not to join hands with wicked Kings and Princes, they
are counted Traitors, as was Isaiah and Jeremiah, such is man's malice. --

Wherefore I do admonish and exhort you both in the Name of the living God,
that how soever you have hitherto showed your selves the Servants of men, to
bear and flatter with the world, that now ye learn in Gods cause to despise the
faces of men, to bend your selves against this wicked world, neither regarding
the Visors of Honors, vain Titles, nor dignities, any farther than they seek
Gods only Glory, for his Glory will he not suffer to be contemned for any
cause; no, he will pour contempt on those Princes that strive against his
Truth, but those that glorify him, will he glorify. -- Behold, Page 75,
your only remedy remaining, ^s to repent your time of ignorance, of
stubbornness, of cruelty, of idolatry, wherein ye have so long continued. Mourn
for your ignorance, and now with all diligence seek for knowledge of the Word
of God, and openly profess the Gospel, which is the power of God, where of ye
ought not to be ashamed. Cease at the last from your old stubbornness, and
labor in the Vineyard with all meekness. Cease from your cruelty against
Christ's Members, and learn to suffer for Christ's sake, if ye will be true
Christians. Banish all Idolatry and Popish Superstition from amongst you, else
can ye, have no part in Christ's Kingdom, no more than Christ can be partaker
with Antichrist. Pray to the Lord of Hosts and Armies to give you the courage,
strength, and means. The Lords Arm is not shortened now, no more than of old.
Be strong therefore in the Lord, for the defense of the Truth, though all the
World rise against it. Now when the battle is fierce against the living God for
dead idols, against the Gospel of Christ for the inventions of Antichrist,
against Christ's members for Popish ceremonies; can any of you that will be
accounted Gods Children, still halt of both hands? Page 76.
-- If you will maintain Gods truth in the Earth, he will receive you as his
Children into the Heavens, if you confess his Christ before this wicked
Generation, Christ shall confess you before his Father in the Heavens, in the
presence of his Angels: But if you persist stubbornly to banish Gods Word, and
his Son Christ in his Members forth of your Earthly Kingdoms, how can ye look
for any part in his Heavenly Kingdom? Page 77.
-- Lo here is the choice of life and death, of misery and wealth offered to
you by Gods mercies, and the means how you may win Gods favor opened, whereby
only ye may prevail against your enemies. God grant you hearts to answer as
the people did to Joshua, offering the like choice. Josh. 24.
God forbid (say they) that we should forsake God, we will serve the Lord our
God, and obey his voice, for he is our God. And we your banished Brethren, by
the Power of God, to provoke you forwards, will thus pronounce with Joshua,
That we and our Families will serve the Lord God, though all Nations run to
Idols, though all people do persecute us. We know that Satan has but a short
time to rage, and that Christ our Captain right speedily will crown his So
Idiers, to whom as he is the eternal God with his Father be all honor and
glory for ever and ever. So be it.

A short Prayer which Mr. Gilby made for the saithful in those days. See it at
the end of the Dialogue.
O Lord God, and most merciful Father, we beseech thee for the honor of thy
Holy Name to desend us from that Antichrist of Rome, and from all his
detestable enormities, manners, laws, garments, and ceremonies. Destroy thou
the counsel of all the Papists and Atheists, enemies of thy Gospel, and of this
Realm of England. Disclose their mischiefs and subtle practices. Confound
their devices. Let them be taken in their own wiliness. And strengthen all
those that maintain the Cause and Quarrel of thy Gospel, with invincible force
and power of the Holy Spirit, so that they fail not to proceed and go forward
to that true Godliness, commanded in thy Holy Word, with all simplicity and
sincerity, to thy Honor and Glory, the comfort of thine Elect, and the
confusion of thine enemies, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. Amen,
Amen. And say from the heart, Amen.

Glee.
When the Friars told Madam La Glee, Fox, Vol. 3. Cont. p. 24.
that she was in a damnable estate: It seems so indeed (said she) being now in
your hands; but I have a God that will never leave me, nor forsake me, for all
that. Thou have (said they) renounced the Faith. It is true (said she) I have
renounced your faith, which I am able to show is rejected, and accursed of God,
and therefore deserves not so much as to be called Faith.

When news was brought her, Page: 25.
that she was condemned to be hanged, she fell down upon her knees, and blessed
God, for that it pleased him to show her so much mercy as to deliver her by
such a kind of death, out of the troubles of this wretched world, and to honor
her so far, as to call her to d^e for his Truth, and to wear his Livery
(meaning the Haltar, which the Hangman had put about her neck) Then sitting
down at Table to break her fast with the three other condemned Servants of
Christ, giving thanks to God, she exhorted them to be of good courage, and to
trust unto the end in his free and only mercy. She then called for a clean
linen Wastcoat, making her self ready, Ward, page 151.
as if she had been going to a Wedding, Mr. Ward tells us, that s^e put on her
Bracelets; for I go (said she) unto my Husband.

Being commanded (as she was led to execution) to take a Torch into her hand,
and to acknowledge she had offended God and the King: Away, away, (said she)
with it. I have neither offended God, nor the King, according to your meaning,
nor in respect of the cause, for which I suffer. I am I confess a sinful woman,
but I need no such light, for helping me to ask forgiveness of God for my sins
past, or present. Use such things your selves, who sit and walk in the darkness
of ignorance and error.

Then one of her Kinsfolks met her in the way, and presented to her view her
little children, praying her to have compassion on them. I must needs tell you
(said she) that I love my children dearly; but yet neither for the love I bear
to them, or any thing else in this world, will I renounce the Truth, or my God,
who is and will be a Father unto them, to provide better for them, then I
should have done, and therefore to his providence and protection I commend and
leave them.

When she saw the three men about to die silent, and not to call on God, she
exhorted them thereto, and gave them an example.

Glover.
Mr. Robert Glover in his Letter to his Wife has many memorable passages, Fox,
Vol. 3. page 422.
the chief I shall collect. -- I thank you heartily (most loving Wife) for your
Letters sent to me in my imprisonment. I read them with tears more than once or
twice, with tears (I say) for joy and gladness, that God has wrought in you so
merciful a work; (1) An unfeigned repentance. (2) An humble and hearty
reconciliation. (3) A willing schm^ssion and obed^ence to the will of God in
all things. -- These your Letters, and the hearing of your godly proceedings
have much relieved and comforted me, etc. and shall be a goodly Testimony for
you ar the great Day, against many worldly and dainty D^mes, which set more by
their own pleasure and praise in this world, than by Gods G^ory, little
regarding (as it appears) the everlasting health of their own souls or
others. -- So long as God shall lend you continuance in this miserable world,
above all things give your self continually to Prayer, lifting up pure hands
without anger, wrath, or doubting forgiving as Christ forgives. And that we may
be the better willing to forgive, it is good often to call to remembrance the
multitude and greatness of our sins, which Christ daily and hourly pardons
and forgiveth us. -- And because Gods Word teaches us, not only the true
manner of praying, but also what we ought to do or not to do in the whole
course of our life, what pleases or displeases God, Joh 12.
and that as Christ says, The Word of God, that he has spoken, shall judge
us. Let your Prayer be to this end especially, that God of his great mercy
would open and reveal more and more daily to your heart the true sense,
knowledge, and understanding of his mest holy Word, and give you grace in your
living, to express the fruit thereof. And forasmuch as Gods Word is, as the
Holy Ghost calls it, The Word of affliction, 1 Cor. 1.
i.e. it is seldom without hatred, persecution, peril, danger of loss of goods
and life, etc. Call upon God continually for his assistance, casting your
accounts what it is like to cost you, endeavoring your self, through the help
of the Holy Ghost by continuance of prayer, to lay your foundation so sure,
that no storm or tempest shall be able to overthrow it; remembering always (as
Christ says) Lots wife, Luke 17.
i. e. to beware of looking back to that thing that displeases God: and
nothing more displeases God than I dolatry, that is, false worshipping of God,
otherwise than his Word commands. -- They object they be the Church, etc. My
answer was, The Church of God knows and acknowledges no other head, but
Jesus Christ the Son of God, whom ye have refused. and chosen the man of sin,
the Son of perdition, enemy to Christ, Pa. 423.
the Devils Deputy and Lieutenant, the Pope. Christ's Church hears, teaches,
and is ruled by his Word, John 1
as he says, My Sheep hear my voice. If you abide in me, and my Word abide in
you, you be my Disciples. Their Church repelleth Gods Word, and forces all men
to follow their traditions. Christ's Church dares not add nor diminish, alter or
change his blessed Testament; Acts 7.
but they be not afraid to take away all that Christ instituted, and go a
whoring (as the Scripture says) with their own inventions, etc. The Church of
Christ is, has been, and shall be in all ages under the Cross, persecuted,
molested, and afflicted, the world ever hating them because they are not of the
world; but these persecute, murder, slay, and kill such as profess the true
doctrine of Christ, be they in learning, living, conversation, and other
virtues never so excellent. Christ and his Church referred the trial of their
doctrine to the Word of God, John 5.
and gave the people leave to judge thereof by the same Word; search the
Scriptures. But this Church takes away the Word from the people, and suffers
neither learned, nor unlearned, to examine or prove their doctrine by the Word
of God. The true Church of God labors by all means to resist and withstand
the Iusts, desires, and motions of the world, the flesh, and the Devil: these
for the most part give themselves to all voluptuousness, etc. -- I likened them
to Nimrod, whom the Scripture calls a mighty Hunter, telling them, That that
which they could not have by the Word, they would have by the Sword, and be the
Church whether men will or no. -- Beware of such as shall advertise you
something to bear with the world, as they do, for a season. There is no
dallying with Gods matters. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
God. Remember the Prophet Elias, 1 Chr. 18 Luke 9.
Why halt ye on both sides? Remember what Christ says, He that puts his
hand to the Plough, and looks back, is not worthy of me. And seeing God has
hitherto allowed you as a good Soldier in the foreward, play not the Coward,
neither draw back to the rere-ward. Saint John numbreth among them, that shall
dwell in the fiery Lake, such as be fearful in Gods Cause, Set before your eyes
always the examples of such, as have behaved themselves boldly in Gods Cause,
as Stephen, Peter, Paul, Daniel, the three Children, the Widows Sons, and in
your days Anne Askew, Lawrence Sanders, John Bradford, etc. Be afraid in
nothing (says Saint Paul) of the adversaries of Christ's Doctrine, Phil. 1.
the which is to them a sign of perdition, but to you of everlaesting
salvation. Christ commands the same, saying, Fear them not. Let us not follow
the example of him, who asked time first to take leave of his Friends. If we do
so, we shall find few of them, that will encourage us to go forward in our
business, please it God never so much. We read not that James and John, Andrew
and Simon, when they were called, put off the time, till they had known their
Fathers and Friends pleasure, but the Scripture says, They forsook all, Mat.
13.
and by and by followed Christ. Christ likened the Kingdom of God to a precious
Pearl, the which whosoever finds, sells all that he has to buy it. Yea,
whosoever has but a little taste or glimmering how precious a treasure the
Kingdom of Heaven is, will gladly forego both life and goods for the obtaining
of it. But the most part now adays be like to Aesop's Cock, which when he had
found a precious stone, wished rather to have found a barley corn: so ignorant
be they how precious a jewel the Word of God is, that they choose rather the
things of this world, which being compared to it, be less in value than a
barley corn. If I would have given place to worldly reasons, these might have
moved me; the foregoing of you and my children; the consideration of the state
of my children, being yet young, apt and inclinable to virtue and learning, and
so having the more need of my assistance; I was never called to be a Preacher
or Min^ster; and (because of my fickness) fear of death in Prison before I
should come to my answer, and so my death to be unprofitable. But these and
such like, I thank my heavenly Father (which of his infinite mercy inspired me
with his Holy Ghost, for his Sons sake, my only Savior and Redeemer)
prevailed not in me. But when I had by the wonderful permission of God fallen
into their hands, at the first sight of the Sheriff, nature a little abashed;
yet ere ever I came to the Prison, by the working of God and through his
goodness, sear departed. -- Little justice was showed by Mr. Sheriff; but the
less justice a man sindeth at their hands, the more consolation in conscience
shall he find from God; for whosoever is of the world, the world will love him.
After I came to Prison, and had reposed my self there a while, I wept for joy
and gladness my belly full, musing much of the great mercies of God, and (as it
were) saying to my self after this sort, O Lord, who am I, on whom thou
should bestow this thy great mercy, to be numbered among the Saints that
suffer for the Gospels sake? And so beholding and considering on the one side
my imperfection, unableness, sinsul misery and unworthiness, and on the other
side the greatness of Gods mercy, to be called to so high promotion, I was as
it were amazed and overcome for a while with joy and gladness, concluding thus;
O Lord, thou show power in weakness, wisdom in foolishness, mercy in
sinfulness. Who shall let thee to choose where and whom thou will? As I have
ever zealously loved the consession of thy Word, Pa. 424.
so ever thought I my self unworthy to be partaker of affl^ction for the same.
Some traveling with me to be dismissed upon bonds, to them my answer was (to
my remembrance) after this sort; Forasmuch as the Masters have imprisoned me,
having nothing to burden me withal, if I should enter into bonds, I should in
so doing accuse my self: and ^e^ing they have no matter to lay to my charge,
they may as well let me pas^ without bonds, as with bonds. Secondly, if I shall
enter into bonds, covenant and promise to appear, I shall do nothing but
excuse, color, and cloak their wickedness, and endanger my self nevertheless,
being bound by my promise to appear. -- Afterward debating the matter with my
self, these considerations came into my head. I have from time to time with
good conscience (God I take to record) moved all such as I had conference with
to be no dalliers in Gods matters, but to show themselves after so great a
light and knowledge, hearty, earnest, constant, and stable in so manifest a
truth, and not to give place one jot contrary to the same. Now thought I, if I
shall withdraw my self, and make any shifts to pull my own neck out of the
Collar, I shall give great offense to my weak Brethren in Christ, and advantage
to the enemies to slander Gods Word. It will be said, he has been a great
emboldner of others to be earnest and fervent, to fear no worldly perils and
dangers, but he himself will give no such example. Wherefore I thought it my
bounden duty both to God and man, being (as it were) by the great goodness of
God called and appointed hereunto, to setaside all fear, perils and dangers,
all worldly respects and considerations, and like as I had before, according to
the measure of my small gift, within the compass of my vocation and calling,
from the bottom of my heart unseignedly moved exhorted, and persuaded all that
profess Gods Word, manfully to persist in the defense of the same, not with
sword and violence, but with suffering and loss of life, rather than to defile
themselves again with the whorish abominaon of the Romish Antichrist. So the
hour being come with my fact and example to ratify, confirm, and protest the
same to the hearts of all true Believers, and to this end (by the mighty
assistance of Gods holy Spirit) I resolved my self with much peace of
conscience, willingly to sustain whatsoever the Romish Antichrist should do
against me. -- When Mr. Warren the Chancellor willed the chief Jailer to carry
me to the Bishop, I laid to his charge the cruel seeking of my death; and when
he would have excused himself, I told him he could not wipe his hands so: He
was as guilty of my blood before God, as though he had murdered me with his
own hands. He departed from me, saying I needed not to fear if I would be of
his belief. God open his eyes, and give him grace to believe this, which he and
all of his inclination shall find (I fear) too true for their parts, that all
they which cruelly, maliciously, and spitefully persecute, molest, and afflict
the Members of Christ for their Conscience sake, and for the true testimony of
Christ's Word, and Cause them to be most unjustly slain and murdered, without
speedy repentance shall dwell with the Devil and his Angels in the fiery lake
everlastingly, where they shall wish and desire, cry and call, but in vain (as
their right companion Epulo) to be refreshed of them, whom in this world they
contemned, despised, disdained, as slaves, misers, and wretches -- The Bishop
laid to my charge my not coming to Church. Here I might have dallied with him,
and put him to his proofs. -- Notwithstanding I answered him through Gods
merciful help, that I neither had nor would come at their Church, as long as
their Mass was used there, to save (if I had them) five hundred lives. -- The
Bishop asking me who should judge the Word? I told him, Christ was content that
the people should judge his Doctrine by searching the Scriptures, and so was
Paul. Methinks ye should claim no farther privilege nor pre^eminence than they
had. -- The Bishop telling me, He was my Bishop; and therefore I must believe
him: If you say black is white (said I) must I also say as you say, and believe
the same, because you say it is so? Pa. 425.
-- If you will be believed because you be a Bishop, Why find you fault with
the people, that believed Mr. Latimer, Mr. Ridley, Mr. Hooper, etc. that were
Bishops? Because they were Heretics (said the Bishop) And may not you err
(quoth I) as well as they? I looked for learning at my Lords hand to persuade
me, and he oppressed me only with his Authority. He said I dissented from the
Church, and asked me where my Church was before King Edward's time; I desired
him to show me, where their Church was in Elias time, and what outward show it
had in Christ's time? -- The tidings that I should be carried to Lichfield did
at first somewhat discourage me, fearing least I should by reason of my great
sickness through extreme handling (which I looked for) have died in the Prison,
before I should come to my answer: But I rebuked immediately with Gods Word
this infidelity in my self, etc. after this manner, What make I of God? Is not
his power as great in Lichfield as Coventry? Does not his providence extend as
well to Lichfield as Coventry? Was he not with Habakkuk, Daniel, Meshach, and
Jeremy in their most dangerous imprisonments? He knows what things we have need
of them. He has numbered all the hairs of our head. The Sparrow falls not to
the ground without our heavenly Fathers will, much more will he care for us, if
we be not faithless, whom he has made worthy to be witnesses of his truth. So
long as we put our trust in him, we shall never be destitute of his help,
neither in prison, nor in sickness, nor in health, nor in death, nor before
Kings, nor before Bishops. Not the Devil himself, much less one of his
Ministers shall be able to prevail against us. With such like meditations I
waxed cheerful of good consolation and comfort. So that hearing one say, They
could not provide Horses enough for us, I said, Let them carry us in a
Dung-Cart for lack of Hoeses, if they list, I am well content for my part. -- I
told Jephcot the Chancellors Servant, That they should have judgment without
mercy, that she we^ no mercy, and this mercy I found at his hand at Lichfield.
He put me into a Prison that same night, where I continued till I was
condemned, in a place next to the Dungeon, etc. very cold, with small light,
and there he allowed me a bundle of Straw instead of a Bed, without Chair,
Form, or any other thing to ease my self withal. God of his mercy gave me
great patience through prayer that night, so that if it had been his pleasure,
I could have been contented to have ended my life. -- In the time of my
imprisonment I gave my self continually to prayer and meditation of the
merciful promises of God, made unto all, without exception of persons, that
call upon the Name of his dear Son Jesus Christ. I found in my self daily
amendment of health of body, increase of peace in conscience, and many
consolations from God by the help of his holy Spirit, and sometime (as it were)
a taste and glimmering of the life to come, All for his only Son Jesus Christ's
sake. To him be all the praise for ever and ever. The enemy cease not many
times sundry ways to assault me: Oftentimes objecting to my conscience my own
unworthiness of the greatness of the benefit to be accounted amongst those that
suffer for Christ, for his Gospels sake. Against him I replied with the Word of
God on this sort. What were all those whom God had chosen from the beginning to
be his Witnesses, and to carry his Name before the world? Were they not men,
Acts 24. Romans 11. Rem. 4. John 1.
as well subject to sin and imperfections, as other men be? -- Who gave first
unto him? What have thou that thou have not received? All have received of his
fullness. They were no bringers of any goodness to God, but altogether
receivers. They chose not God first, but God chose them. They loved not God
first, but he loved them first: Yea he both loved and chose them when they were
his ene mies, full of sin and corruption, as well as void of all goodness. --
He is and will be the same God, as rich in mercy, as mighty, as able, as ready,
as willing to forgive sins without respect of persons to the worlds end of all
them that call upon him. God is near, he is at hand, he is with all, with all
(I say) and refuses ^one, excepteth none, that faithfully in true repentance
call upon him, in what hour, what place, or what time soever it be. It is no
arregancy nor presumption in any man to burden God (as it were) with his
promise, and of duty to claim and challenge his aid, help, and assistance in
all our perils, dangers, and distress, calling upon him not in the confidence
of our own godliness, but in the trust of his own promises made in Christ. --
His Word cannot lie, Call upon me in the day of trouble, Psalm. 50.
and I will hear thee, and thou shall praise me. I answered ^he enemy also on
this manner; I am a sinner, and therefore unworthy to be a witness of this
truth. What then? Must I deny his Word, because I am ^ot worthy to profess it?
What bring I to pass in ^o doing, but add sin to sin? What is greater sin ^han
to deny the truth of Christ's Gospel? He that (...) ashamed of me or of my words
(says Christ) of him ^lso will I be ashamed before my Father, and all his
^ngels. I might also by the same reason forbear to ^o any of Gods Commancments.
When I am provoked to pray, the enemy may say to me, I am (...) worthy to pray,
therefore I shall not pray, etc. -- (...)

When the Bishop came to Lichfield -- he persuaded me to be a Member of his
Church, which had continued so many years. As for our Church (as he called it)
it was not known, he said, but larely in King Edward's time. I profess my self
to be a Member of that Church (said I) that is builded upon the foundation of
the Prophets and Apostles Jesus Christ being the head cornerstone. And the
Church has been from the beginning (said I) though it bear no glorious show
before the world being ever for the most part under the Cross and affliction,
contemned, despised, and persecuted The Bishop contended on the other side that
the^ were the Church. So cried all the Clergy against the Prophets of Jerusalem
(said I) saying, The Church, the Church, etc. So much out of M^ Glover's choice
Letter.

After he was condemned, Pa. 427.
his heart was lumpish and desolate of all spiritual consolation; whereupon
fearing least the Lord had utterly withdraw^ he made his moan to Mr. Austine
Bernher, his familiar friend, telling him how he had prayed nig^ and day to
God, and yet had no sense of comso^ from him. The Minister desired him to wait
patiently the Lords leisure; and howsoever his present seeling was, yet seeing
his cause was just, he exhorted him constantly to stick to the same, an^ to
play the man, not doubting but the Lord in (...) good time would visit him, and
satisfy his des^^ with plenty of consolation, whereof (said M^ Bernher) he was
right certain and sure, and therefore desired him, whenever any such feeling
(...) Gods heavenly mercies should begin to touch (...) heart, that then he
should show some significati^^ thereof. The next day, as he was going to the
place of his Martyrdom, and was come within sight of the Stake, although all
the night before, praying for strength and courage, he could feel none;
suddenly he was so mightily replonished with Gods holy comfort, and heavenly
joys, that he cried out, clapping his hands to Austine, and saying in these
words, Austine, He is come, he is come, etc. and that with such joy and
alacrity, as one seeming rather to be risen from some deadly danger to liberty
of life, than as one passing out of the world by any pains of death.

Godfrey.
When one called Godfrey de Hammele Heretic, Ward, page 157.
he said, No Heretic, but an unprofitable Servant, yet willing to die for his
Lord, and reckoning this death no death, but a life.

Goodman.
Mr. Christopher Goodman, See hit Sermon on Act. 4.19. Enlarged and Printed at
Gena. 1558. Pa. 216, etc.
an exiled Minister of Christ in Queen Mary's days, declaring the cause of all
the then misery in England, and the only way to remedy the same, writes as
follows from Geneva.

-- If all in whom the People should look for comfort, be altogether declined
from God (as in deed they appear to be at this present time in England, without
all fear of his Majesty, or pity upon their Brethren) -- Then assure your
selves (dear Brethren and Servants of God) there can be no better counsel, nor
more comfortable or present remedy (which you shall prove true, if God grant
you his Spirit and Grace to follow it) then in continual and daily invocation
of his Name, to rest wholly and only upon him, make him your shield, buckler,
and refuge, who has so promised to be to all them that are oppressed and
depend upon him; to do nothing commanded against God and your conscience,
prefering at all times the will of God to the will of men, faying and answering
to all manner of persons, This God has commanded, this we must do: That God
has forbidden, that we will not do. If you will rob us and spoil us for doing
the Lords will, to the Lord must you make answer, and not to us; for his goods
they are, and not ours. If ye will imprison us, behold you are oppressors; if
ye will hang us, or burn us, behold ye are murderers of them which fear the
Lord. -- And for our part, if you take from us this vile and corruprible life,
we are sure the Lord will grant it us again with joy, and immortality, both of
soul and body. If God give you grace to make this or the like answer, and
strength to contemn their Tyranny, you may be sure to find unspeakable comfort
and quietness of conscience in the midst of your danger, and greatest rage of
Satan. And thus boldly confessing Christ your Savior before men (as by the
examples of thousands of your Brethren before your faces God does mercifully
encourage you) you may with all hope and patience wait for the joyful
confession of Christ again, Pa. 218.
before his Father and Angels in Heaven, that you are his obedient and dearly
beloved Servants; being also assured of this, that if it be the will of God to
have you any longer to remain in this miserable world, that then his Providence
is so careful over you, and present with you, that no man or power can take
away your lise from you, nor touch your body any farther than your Lord and God
will permit them, which neither shall be augmented for your plain confession,
nor yet diminished for keeping of silence; for nothing comes to the Servants
of God by hap or chance, whose hairs of their heads are numbered. Whereof if ye
be so assured, at ye ought, there can be nothing that should make you to shrink
from the Lord. I they do cast you into Prison with Joseph, the Lord will
deliver you: If they cast you to wild be^sts and Lions, as they did Daniel, you
shall be preserved: If into the Sea with Jonas, P^. 219.
you shall not be drowned; or into the dirty dungeon with Jeremy, you shall be
delivered; or into the fiery Furnace with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, yet
shall not be consumed. Contrariwise, if it be his good pleasure, that you shall
glorify his holy Name by your death, what great thing have you lost? changing
death for life, misery for felicity, continual vexation and trouble for
perpetual rest and quietness, churing rather to die with shame of the world,
being the Servants of God, than to live among men in honor, being the Servants
of Satan, and condemned of God. Otherwise, if you give place to the wickedness
of men to escape their malice and bodily dangers, you show your selves therein
to fear man, more than the mighty and dreadful God: him that has but power of
your body, and that at Gods appointment then God, himself, who has power,
after he has destroyed the body, to cast both soul and body into hell fire,
there to remain everlastingly in torments unspeakable. And moreover, Pa. 220.
that which you look to obtain by these sinful shifts, you shall be sure to
lose with grief and trouble of conscience; for this saying of your Master being
true and certain, that They which seek to save their life (meaning by any
worldly reason or policy) shall lose it. Mat. 16.
What shall be their gains at length, when by dissimulation and yielding to
Popish Blasphemy, they dishonor the Majesty of God to enjoy this short,
miserable, and mortal life, to be cast from the favor of God, and company of
his heavenly Angels, to enjoy for a short time their goods and possessions
among their fleshly and carnal Friends, when as their conscience within shall
be deeply wounded with helllike torments? when Gods curse and indignation
hangs continually over the heads of such, ready to be poured down upon them;
when they shall find no comfort, but utter despair with Judas, who for this
worldly riches (as he did) have sold their Master, Pa. 221.
seeking either to hang themselves with Jadas, to murder themselves with
Francis Spira, to drown themselves with Justice Hales, or else to fall into a
raging madness with Justice Morgan? What comfort had Judas then by his money
received for betraying his Master? was he not shortly after compelled to cast
it from him, with this pitiful voice, Mat. 27. Pa. 222.
I have sinned in betraying innocent blood? -- Then, dear Brethren in Christ,
what other reward can any of you look for, committing the like offenses? --
There is no trust but in God, no comfort but in Christ, no assurance but in his
promise, by whose obedience only you shall avoid all danger. Mat. 10.
And whatsoever you lose in this world, and suffer for his Name, it shall be
here recompensed with double, according to his promise, and in the world to
come with life everlasting, which is to find your life, when you are willing to
lay it down at his Commandment. I am not ignorant how unnatural a thing it is,
and contrary to the flesh, willingly to sustain such cruel death, as the
Adversaries have appointed to all the Children of God, who mind constantly to
stand by their profession, yet to the Spirit notwithstanding is easy and
joyful; for though the flesh be frail, the Spirit is prompt and ready. Pa. 223.
Whereof (praised be the name of God) you have had notable experience in many
of your Brethren, very Martys for Christ, who with joy patiently, and
triumphing have suffered and drunk with thirst of that bitter Cup, which nature
so much abhors, wonderfully strengthened no doubt by the secret inspiration
of Gods holy Spirit; so that there ought to be none among you so feeble, weak,
or timorous, whom the wonderful examples of Gods present power and singular
favor in those persons, should not encourage, bolden, and fortify to show the
like constancy in the same Cause and Profession. Nevertheless great cause we
have thankfully to consider the unspeakable mercy of God in Christ, who has
farther respect to our infirmity, that when we have not that boldness of Spirit
to stand to the death, as we see others, he has provided a present remedy,
that being persecuted in one place, we have liberty to flee into another. When
we cannot be in our own Country with a safe conscience (except we would make
open profession of our Religion, which is every man's duty, Pa. 224.
and so be brought to offer up our lives in sacrifice to God in testimony that
we are his) he has mollified and prepared the hearts of Strangers to receive
us with all pity and gladness, where you may be also not only delivered from
the fear of death, and the Papistical Tyranny, practiced without all measure in
that Country, but with great freedom of conscience hear the Word of God
continually preached, and the Sacraments of our Savior Christ purely and duly
ministered without all dregs of Popery or Superstition of man's invention, to the
intent that you being with. others refreshed for a space, and more strongly
fortified, may be also with others more ready and willing to lay down your
lives at Gods appointment; for that is the chiefest grace of God, and greatest
perfection, to fight even unto blood under Christ's Banner, and with him to give
our lives. Pa. 225.
But if you will thus flee (Beloved in the Lord) you must not choose unto your
selves places, according as you fancy, as many of us, who have left our
Country have done, dwelling in Popish places among the enemies of God in the
midst of impiety; some in France, as in Paris, Orleance, Roan; some in Italy,
as in Rome, Venice, Padua, which persons in fleeing from their Queen, run to
the Pope, fearing the danger of their bodies, feek where they may poison their
souls, thinking by this means to be less suspected of Jezebel, show themselves
afraid and ashamed of the Gospel, which in times past they have stoutly
professed. And lest they should be thought favorers of Christ, have purposely
ridden by the Churches and Congregations of his Servants, their Brethren,
neither minded to comfort others there, nor to be comforted themselves; wherein
they have showed the coldness of their zeal toward Religion, and given no
small occasion of slander to the Word of God, which they seemed to profess. Pa.
226.
-- This manner of fleeing then is ungodly, etc. Neither is it enough to keep
you out of the Dominions of Antichrist, and to place your selves in corners,
you may be quiet and at ease, and not burdened with the charges of the poor,
thinking it sufficient if you have a little exercise in your houses in reading
a Chapter or two of the Scriptures, and then will be counted zealous persons,
and great Gospellers; No Brethren, and Sisters, this is not the way to show
your selves manful soldiers of Christ, except you resort where his Banner is
displayed, Pa. 227.
and his Standard set up, where the Assembly of your Brethren is, and his Word
openly preached, and Sacraments faithfully ministered; for otherwise what may a
man judge, but that such either disdain the company of their poor Brethren,
whom they ought by all means to help and comfort, according to that power that
God has given them for that end only; and not for their own ease; or else
that they have not that zeal to the House of God, the Assembly of his Servants,
and to the spiritual gifts and graces (which God has promised to pour upon the
diligent hearers of his Word) as was in David, who desired, being a King,
Rather to be a doorkeeper in the House of God, Psalm. 84.
than to dwell in the tents of the ungodly, lamenting nothing so much the
injuries done to him by his Son Absalom (which were not small) as that he was
deprived of the comfortable exercises in the Tabernacle of the Lord, which then
was in Sion. Neither does there appear in such persons that greedy desire
(whereof Isaiah makes mention) which ought to be in the Professors of the
Gospel, Pa. 228. Isa. 2.
who never would cease or rest, till they should climb up to the Lords hill,
meaning the Church of Christ, saying one to another, Let us ascend to the hill
of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways,
and we shall walk in his footsteps; for the Law shall come forth of Sion, and
the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem. Which zeal the Prophet does not mention in
vain, but to show what a thirst and earnest desire should be in true
Christians, and how the same appears in seeking and resorting to those
places, where it is set forth in greatest abundance and perfection, as was
after Christ's Ascension in Jerusalem. And as that zeal showed them to be of
Christ, by the like must we be judged Christians also, that if we flee for
Christ, the places whereunto we flee, may bear witness for what cause we are
fled. Pa. 229.
Neither is it a sufficient excuse which many allege, that they believe to be
saved by Christ, that they have sufficient knowledge of their duty, and the
rest they can supply by their own diligence. I dare say their faith is not so
much, but they had need to desire with the Apostles, Lord, increase our faith.
And if they will so confess, why do they forsake the chiefest means that God
has ordained, which is the open Congregations of his people, where his Word,
the fountain of Faith, is most purely preached, and where the godly Examples of
others may be a sharper spur to prick them forward; and as for the knowledge
and diligence of such, there may be no buckler to defend their doings; for if
they have those gifts whereof they boast, where may they better bestow them
than in the Church of God? except they will say they are born to themselves,
and have the gifts of God, which he would have common to others, applied to
their own private fancy, which is to lap them up in a clout, and not to put
them forth to the vantage of the owner, as did the unprofitable Servant, Pa.
230.
and as do all they to whom God has given either learning, counsel, or worl^ly
substance, who either for the strength of Cities, pleasantness of the air,
traffic, or merchandise, or for any other worldly respect or policy do absent
themselves from the Congregation and company of their poor Brethren, where
Christ has advanced his Standard, and blown his Trumpet. If God then give you
not strength at the first to stand in his Profession to the death, nor that you
cannot be quiet in conscience, a biding in your Country, you see how his mercy
has given you liberty to kill, and what places he has appointed you to flee
unto, that is, where you may do good to your selves and others, where ye may be
free from Superstition and Idolatry, where your faith may be increased and not
diminished, and your selves strengthened, and confirmed, and more strongly
armed. But if you in tarrying will neither stand manfully to Christ your
Master, but betray him, doing as the Papists do; nor yet with thanks use this
remedy, that God has granted to our infirmity, to resort to his Churches,
godlily instituted, what answer shall ye be able to make to his Majesty, when
he shall call for an account of your doings? How shall you avoid his wrathful
indignation, now ready to be poured upon his enemies? -- For in taking part
with their impiety, you must be partakers of their Cup likewise. Neither is
this any new or hard Doctrine, that may exceed your capacity, but may rather be
termed your A. B. C. and first Principles, where in none ought to be ignorant.
That if we will be Christ's Scholars, we must learn to bear his Cross, and to
follow him, not to cast it off our shoulders with the enemies, Pa. 233.
and run from him. -- Be no more deceived in so plain a matter. If the Lord be
God, follow him, if Baal be God, go after him. -- Let not the example of any
lead you into error, for men are but mortal. Trust in the Lord, for he is a
sure rock. -- Trust not your own shifts, for they will deceive you. Mark the
end of others, and in time be warned. These Lessons are hard to the flesh, but
easy to the spirit. The way of the Lord is a strait path, but most faithful,
sure and comfortable. -- From Geneva this first of Jan. An. 1558.

Goose.
John Goose (burnt in England An. 1473.) Clarks Martyrology page 57.
being pressed by the Sheriff of London to recant, and so deliver himself from
death, answered, That for his Religion he was at a pass, and neither could nor
would recant the same.

When the Sheriff gave him some meat, Fox, Vol. 1. page 939.
of which he did eat heartily, he said to the standers by, I eat now a good and
competent Dinner, for I shall pass a sharp shower, before I go to Supper.

Gordius.
When a solemn Feast was celebrated in Caesarea, Fox, Vol. 1. page 117.
in honor to Mars, Gordius a Citizen thereof, who had been a Centurion, and
had chosen exile for sometime in the heat of Persecution, left the Desert
wherein he lived in exile, and got him up into the chief place of the Theater,
and with a loud voice cried out, Behold, I am found of them that sought me not,
and to taose that asked not for me, have I openly appeared.

The Sheriff asking him, who he was, from whence he came, and for what he came
thither; I am come (said he) to publish, that I set nothing by your desires
against the Christian Religion, but that I profess Jesus Christ to be my hope
and safety.

The Sheriff threatening him with all kind of torments; It would be to me a
damage (said he) if I should not endure diverse torments for Christ's Cause.

When he was tormented, he lifted up his eyes to Heaven, saying, The Lord is my
helper, I will not fear the thing that men can do unto me; I will learn no
evil, for thou Lord with me.

He blamed the Tormentors if they favored him at all.

The Sheriff promising great things, if he would deny Christ; It ^ieth not in
you (said be) to place any in Authority, which be worthy to have a place in
Heaven.

When he was led out of the City to be burnt, many with tears begged him to save
himself, but he said, Weep not, I beseech you, for me, but rather for those
that bring us to the fire; and thereby purchase Hell fire to themselves. Truly
I am ready for the Name of Christ to suffer a thousand deaths, if need were.

Some persuading him to deny Christ with his tongue, and to keep his Conscience
to himself: My tongue (said he) which by the goodness of God I have, cannot be
brought to deny the Author and giver of it; for with the heart we believe unto
righteousness, and with the mouth we confess unto salvation.

Gorgius.
When the Tyrant offered Gorgius promotion: Ward, page 141.
Have ye any thing (said he) equal to, or more worthy than the Kingdom of
Heaven.

Gonzalve.
Mr. John Gonzalve a samous Preacher in Sevil, Fox, Vol. 3. Cont. p. 12.
was often observed in all his Sermons to aim at this mark, To deliver men's
minds from that blind conceit of meriting by works, that so way might be made
for justification only by faith in Christ Jesus, and deeply to ingraft in them
the knowledge of the sole merit of his plenary satisfaction.

When he was led to the place of his Martyrdom, he never showed the least sign
of his being dismayed, Page 13.
but contrariwise with great constancy and courage of heart standing above all
the people, to whom he had formerly preached and delivered the pattern of sound
doctrine, he began with a loud voice to recite the Psalm, which begins thus, O
Lord, my Rock, be not thou silent to me, etc. Psa. 28.
He changed not his countenance upon the Scaffold, though they had gagged him
there, because he comforted and freely exhorted one of his Sister^ to be
constant.

When the time was come that those which should be burned were brought to the
place of Execution, they were every one commanded to recite the Articles of
their belief; which they willingly did: but when they came to the Article, I
believe the holy Catholic Church, they were bid to add the word Roman^, but
they were silent. Then did the Monks and Friars importune Gonzalve's Sisters,
etc. to repeat the word Roman, who answered, They would if they might hear
Gonzalve pronounce it. He being ungagged, the first word he spoke was, That
they should be of good courage, and not to add one word more than what they had
recited.

Grange.
The Bishop of Arres telling Mr. For, Vol. 3. Cout. p. 39.
Peragrine del^ Grange, that he was sorry to see him in that condition in
Prison. Sir (said he) as for the base estate in which you now see me, God has
so comforted me therein with his grace, that I do without any great difficulty
patiently suffer what he has pleased to lay upon me; yea, I praise and bless
his Name, that he has balanced the weight of my afflictions, according to the
strength which he has given me, so as I sink not under the burden; for as my
sufferings in Christ abound, he causes his consolations by Christ to abound in
me also.

It is usual (said the Bishop) with such as you are to glory in this kind of
speech; 2 Cor. 1.3.
for as soon as any afflictions do befall you, you by and by style them the
sufferings of Christ; and if any of you be put to death, than it is for Gods
truth: but when things are laid to the touchstone, the matter is nothing so,
nor so. Sir (said Mr. Grange) if your meaning be of such as have died for the
Doctrine, for which I am bound with this Chain, and thus settered with Irons, I
doubt not but they have given such a reason of their Faith, that whosoever
shall read their Answers, and weigh the same without partiality, must needs
judge as we do. And for my own part, I am ready to make it good, 1 Timothy 6.3.
Deuteronomy. 12.32.
That the Doctrine I now hold and teach, is according to godliness, taken out
of the pure Fountains of the holy Scriptures, without adding thereto,
diminishing or varying any way therefrom. We read (said the Bishop) that in all
times men have been wont to shelter themselves under the title of Gods Word,
even the old Heretics, etc. I am not ignorant hereof (said Mr. Grange) in
regard that Satan knows how to transform himself into an Angel of light,
thereby to establish his delusions, causing darkness to be taken for light: But
the Holy Ghost, who is the Spirit of truth, has in such wise discovered his
juglings, that none are deluded thereby, but those who at noon day close their
eyes that they may not behold the light. Do you think (said the Bishop) that
the Holy Ghost has given you such an illumination, that the truth should only
be revealed to you, and to none other. God forbid Sir (said Mr. Grange) I
should have any such thought. I am not of the mind of those Dreamers, who brag
of their having particular Revelations of the Holy Spirit, but I speak of an
ordinary and general Revelation, such as is taught us out of the Bible, etc.

I am neither Calvinist nor Papist. I am a Christian; and what I hold
concerning Religion is taken out of Christ's Doctrine, who is the only Doctor
of his Church. What Calvin has taught conformable to the Word of God, I am of
the same mind with him. And whereas you call your Religion the Old Religion,
and ours the New, i^ troubles me not at all; since the Father of Lie^ has long
since forged the same, to disgrace the Truth, etc. --

In his dispute with the Bishop concerning the Real Presence, See pa. 39, 40,
41, 42.
etc. We may see what holy boldness mixed with meekness the Lord had endued
this holy Servant of his with.

When the Provost gave him and Monsieur de Brez (of whom before) notice, that
they should die that day, they magnified God for his goodness, and gave the
Provost thanks for the good news, which he had brought them. Monsieur la Grange
going to the rest of the Prisoners, Page 43.
said, I am this day to die for the Truth, and then the heavenly in heritance
is prepared for me. My name is written in the Book of Life, Phil. 4.3 Romans
11.29.
never to be blotted out, because the gifts and calling of God are without
repentance. --

He called for a Brush to brush his Hat and Cloak, causing his Shoes to be
blacked; for now (said he) I am bidden to the marriage of the Lamb, where I am
to feast with him for ever and ever.

Being asked, Whether he meant to suffer with those Shackles on his heels? I
would I might (said he) yea and that they would bury them with me too, that
they might manifest the inhumanity of my adverfaries. He told his friends, he
felt such joy of the Holy Ghost in his heart, that he could not with tongue
express; adding, that God showed him a thousand times more favor by taking him
after this manner out of this transitory life, than if he had let him die in
his bed by sickness; for now I shall die (said he) enjoying the benefit of all
the powers of my soul, praying the Lord to have mercy on me.

Monsieur la Grange and de Brez were sentenced to be hanged for administering
the Lords Supper against an express charge by the King given them to the
contrary.

When la Grange was upon the Ladder, he protested with a loud voice, that he
died only for preaching to the people the pure truth of God, taking Heaven and
Earth to witness the same with him.

Gratwick.
Mr. Stephen Gratwick, Fox Vol. 3. page 790.
seeing the Bishops that sat upon to laugh, said unto them, Why do ye laugh?
Are ye confederate together for my blood, and therein triumph? You have more
cause to look weightily upon the matter; for I stand here before you upon life
and death. But you declare your selves what you are. You are lapped in Lambs
apparel, but you are bent to have my blood. --

Seeing you will have my blood, Pa. 792.
let me say a little more for my self: On Sunday last you preached this Truth,
If any man think himself Religious, and bridleth not his tongue, the same man's
Religion is vain: And yet in the mean time you seduced your tongue to slander
us poor Prisoners there present in Iron bands, burdening us with the names of
Arrians, Herodians, Anabaptists, Sacramentarians, Pelagians: And when we stood
up to purge our selves thereof, you said, You would cut out our tongues, and
cause us to be pulled out of the Church by violence. But there you gave your
self a shrewd blow, etc. --

Being asked by the Bishop of Winchester if he would recant, he said, My faith
is grounded more steadfastly than to change in a moment. It is no process of
time can alter me, unless my faith were as the ways of the Sea.

When he was condemned, he desired God wi^ a loud voice, That he would not lay
his blood (...) their charge if it were his good will.

Green.
Mr. Fox, Vol. 3. page 622.
Bartlet Green wrote in Mr. Bartram Calthr^^ Book a little before his death,
thus. -- Two thing have very much troubled me whilst I was in (...) Temple,
Pride and Gluttony, which under (...) color of Glory and good Fellowship, drew
(...) almost from God. --

For So Much as vainglory is so subtle an adves sary, that almost it wounds
deadly, ere ever (...) man can perceive himself to be smitten, therefo^^ we
ought so much the rather by continual praye^ to labor for humbleness of mind.
Glutrony begins under a charitable pretense of love and society, and has in
it most uncharitableness -- Let us therefore watch and be sober; for o^
adversary the Devil walks about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may
devour. Vale (mi Buirame) and mei memineris, ut semper simillimi, efficismur.
Vale, etc. Farewell (my Bartram) and remember me, that we may be always like,
Farewell at Newgate Jan. 20. A. 1556.

In his Letter to Mr. Pa. 623.
Philpet. -- Being accused that I spoke against the real Presence, and the
S^crifice of the Mass, and that I affirmed that the^^ Church was the Church of
Antichrist: I confesse^ it, and that I would continue therein, though no^
maintain it by learning, my conscience being satisfied in the truth, which is
sufficient to my salvation. -- I told Mr. Welsh, Forasmuch as it ple^seth you
to use me so familiarly (for he behave^ himself toward me, as though I had
been his equal) I shall open my mind freely to you. I consider my youth, lack
of wit and learning, which would God it were but a little under the opinion
that some men have of me: But God is not bound to time, wit, or knowledge, but
rather chooses the weak things of the world to confound the mighty, neither
can men appoint bounds to Gods mercy; Romans 9.
For I will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. There is no respect of
persons with God, whether he be old or young, rich or poor, wise or foolish,
Fisher or Basket-maker. God gives knowledge of his truth, through his free
grace, James 1.
to whom he list. -- Now I am brought hither before a great many Bishops and
learned men to be made a fool and a laughing stock, but I weigh it not a rush;
for God knows that my whole study is to please him: Besides that, I care not
for man's pleasure or displeasure.

As he was going to Newgate (after he was condemned) there met with him two
Gentlemen, Pa. 627.
that seeing him burst out into tears, to whom Mr. Green said, Ah my friends,
is this your comfort you are come to give me? Must I who needed to have comfort
ministered to me, become now a comforter of you? --

When he was going to, and was at the Stake, he repeated this Distich, Christ
Deus, sine te spes est mihi nulla salutis,
Te duce vera sequor, te duce falsa nego.


In English thus. O Christ my God, sure hope of health,
Besi^es thee I have none,
The truth I love and falsehood hate,
By thee my guide alone.


These Verses he wrote in a Book of Mr. Hussey's of the Temple.

Behold thy self by me,
Such one was I as thou,
And thou in time shall be,
Even dust as I am now!
Bartlet Green. In his Letter to his Friends of the Temple. --

Pa. 628.
Very Friends are they, which are knit together by the knot of Charity. Charity
does not decay, but increase in them that die faithfully. -- If thy Friend be
out of sight, is thy friendship ended? -- If he be carried into Heaven, is
Charity hindered thereby? The Fathers of the Primitive Church gave thanks for
their Friends that died in the Faith, to prove that Charity died not with
Death. -- What says Saint Paul, We are members of his body, of his flesh, and
of his blood; we are members one of another. Is the hand or Arm, Foot or Leg, a
member, when it is dissevered from the body? What is it that couples us, but
love? When all things shall fail, love fails never. Hope has his end, when
we get that we hoped for. Faith is finished in Heaven. Love endures for ever:
Spiritual love, I mean; for carnal love, when that which we love is lost, does
perish with the flesh. Neither was that ever but fleshly love, which by
distance of place or severing of bodies, is parted asunder. -- If we keep
Christ's commandment in loving each other, as he loved us, then should our love
be everlasting. This friendship Paul felt, when it moved him to say, That
neither length nor breadth, neither height nor depth, should sever him from the
love of Christ. Now you may say, Why writes thou this? Truly to the end, that
if our friendship be stable, you may accomplish this the last request of your
Friend, etc. -- Mr. Fleetwood, I beseech you remember Wittrance and Cook, two
singular men among common Prisoners. Mr. Fernham, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Hussy (as
I hope) will dispatch Palmer and Richardson, with his companions. I pray you
Mr. Palmer think on J. Grove, an honest poor man, Traiford and Rice Apprice his
Accomplices. My Cousin Thomas Witton (a Scrivener in Lombardstreet) has
promised to further their delivery, at the least he can instruct you which way
to works I doubt not but that Mr. Bowyer will labor for Goodwife Cooper (for
she is worthy to be helped) and Berard the Frenchman. There be also diverse
others well-disposed men, whose deliverance if you will not labor for, yet I
humbly beseech you to seek their relief. -- For these and all other poor
Prisoners I make this my humble suit and prayer to you all my especial good
Friends, beseeching you by all the bonds of amity, in the bowels of mercy, to
tender the cases of miserable Captives. Help to cloth Christ, visit the
Afflicted, comfort the Sorrowful, and relieve the Needy. The very God of peace
guide your hearts to have mercy on the poor, and love faithfully together. Amen.

This present Monday when I look to die, and to live for ever.

Yours for ever, Bartlet Green.


In his Letter to Mrs. Elizabeth Clark. -- I shall not cease with continual
Prayer to labor for you, desiring Almighty God to increase that which he has
long since begun in you, of fober life, and earnest zeal toward his Religion,
1 Timothy 5.
She that is a true Widow and friendless, puts her trust in God, continuing
day and night in supplication and prayer; but she that lives in pleasure is
dead, even yet alive. And verily she is a true widow, that has married Christ,
forsaking the vanities of the world, and the lusts of the flesh; 1 Cor. 7.
For as the married woman cares how to love and serve and please her Husband,
so ought the Widow to give all her soul and heart, thoughts and words, studies
and labors, faithfully to love God, virtuously to bring up her children and
household, and diligently to provide for the poor and oppressed -- Not to live
in pleasure, but to watch unto prayer, stedfostly laying up all her trust in
God. Luke 2.
Of Anna it is written, That she never went out of the Temple, but served God
with fasting and prayer night and day, -- to bring up her children and household
godly in the nurture and information of the Lord. Ephesians. 6.
-- There are most manifest examples against Parents for the offenses of
Children. Contrariwise how greatly might Hanna rejoice over Samuel her Son,
whom she had brought up in the House of the Lord? Pa. 629.
-- But above all Widows, thrice blessed was the happy Mother of the seven
Sons, that so had instructed them in the fear of the Lord, that by no torments
they would shrink from the love of his Truth? -- To be liberal to Strangers, 1 Timothy 5.
to wash the Saints feet, and minister to them in their adversity. Saint Paul
(as though they only had been therefore meet) appointed only Widows to
minister to the Saints, and to gather for the poor. -- Alas! That Christ so
hungreth, and no man will feed him; is so fore oppressed with thirst, and no man
will give him drink; destitute of all lodging, and not relieved; sick, and not
visitted; imprisoned, and not seen. In times past men could bestow large sums
of money on Copes, Vestments, and Ornaments of the Church: why rather follow we
not St. Ambrose his example, who sold the same for the relief of the poor; or
Chrysostom's command, who willed first to deck and garnish the living Temple of
God? But alas! such is the wickedness of these our last days, that nothing
moves us, neither the pure Doctrine, the godliness of life, nor good examples
of the Ancient Fathers. If in any thing they erred, that will their charitable
children embrace, publish and maintain with sword, faggot and fire: but all in
vain they strive against the stream; for though in despite of the Truth, by
force of the ears of crafty persuasion, they may bring themselves into the
haven of Hell; yet can they not make all men believe that the banks move while
the ship saileth, nor ever shall be able to turn the direct course of the
stream of Gods Truth. --

In another Letter. -- Better is the day of death (says Solomon) than the day
of birth. -- Happy are the dead that die in the Lord. Man of woman is born in
travel to live in misery; man through Christ does die in joy to live in
felicity: he is born to die, and dies to live. Strait as he comes into the
world with cries he utters his miserable estate; strait as he departs with
Songs he praises God for ever. Scarce yet in his cradle, three deadly enemies
affault him, after death no Adversary may annoy him; whilst he is here he
displeases God, when he is dead, he fulfilleth his will. -- Here he dies
every hour, there he lives continually; here is sin, there is righteousness;
here is time, there is eternity, here is hatred, there is love; here is pain,
there is pleasure; here is misery, there is felicity. -- Seek therefore the
things that are above, etc.

Gray.
The Lady Jane Gray, Daughter to the Duke of Suffolk, For, Vol 3 page 13, 14,
etc.
whose Mother was Daughter to Mary, King Henry the Second's Sister, having
personated a Queen for ten days, and upon Queen Mary's Proclamation being
imprisoned, the Queen sent Mr. Fecknam to her, two days before her death to
commune with her, and reduce her from the Doctrine of Christ to Queen Mary's
Religion. Page 31.
The effect of which communication here follows. Madam (said Fecknam) I
lament your heavy Case, etc. You are welcome unto me Sir (said the Lady Jane)
if you come to give me Christian Exhortation. And as for my heavy Case (I thank
God) I do so little lament it, that rather I account the same for a more
manifest Declaration of Gods favor toward me, than ever he showed me at any
time before; and therefore there is no cause, why either you or other which
bear me good will, should lament or be grieved with this my Case, being a thing
so profitable for my souls health. I am here come (said he) from the Queen and
Council to instruct you in the true Doctrine of the right Faith, etc. I
heartily thank the Queen (said she) who is not unmindful of her humble Subject,
and I hope no less that you will do your duty therein, both truly and
faithfully. What is then (said he) required of a Christian? To believe (said
she) in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons and one God. What
(said he) is there nothing else required or looked for in a Christian, but to
believe in him? Page 32.
Yes (said she) We must love him with all our heart, with all our soul, and
with all our mind, and our Neighbor as our self. Why then (said he) faith
justifies not, and saves not. Yes verily (said she) Faith (as Paul says)
only justifies. Why (said he) St. Paul says, If I have all faith without
love, it is nothing. True (said she) for how can I love him, whom I trust not?
or how can I trust him, whom I love not? Faith and love go both together, and
yet love is comprehended in faith. How must we love our Neighbor? (said he) To
love our Neighbor (said she) is to feed the hungry, to cloth the naked, and
give drink to the thirsty, and to do to him as we would do to our selves. Why
then (said he) it is necessary unto salvation to do good works also, and it is
not sufficient only to believe. It is meet (said she) that a Christian in
token that he follows his Master Christ to do good works, yet may we not say,
that they profit to our salvation; for when we have done all, we be
unprofitable servants, and faith only in Christ's blood saves us. How many
Sacraments are there? (said he) Two (said she) The one the Sacrament of
Baptism, by which I am washed with water, and regenerated by the Spirit, and
that washing is a token to me that I am a child of God: the other the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper, which offered to me is a sure seal and testimony that I am
by the blood of Christ, which he shed for me on the Cross, made partaker of the
everlasting Kingdom. There are seven (said he) By what Scripture (said she)
find you that. Well (said he) we will talk of that hereafter. What do you
receive in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper? Do you not receive the very body
and blood of Christ? No surely (said she) I believe that the Supper I neither
receive flesh nor blood, but Bread and Wine, which Bread, when it is broken,
and Wine, when it is drunken, puts me in remembrance, how that for my sins,
the Body of Christ was broken, and his Blood shed on the Cross, and with that
Bread and Wine I receive the Benefits that come by the breaking of his Body,
and shedding of his Blood for our sins on the Cross. Why (said he) does not
Christ speak these words, Take, eat, this is my Body? Require you any plainer
words? Does he not say it is his Body? I grant he says so (said she) and so he
says, I am the Vine, I am the Door, and yet is not the Vine, or the Door. Does
not St. Paul say, Romans 4.
He calls things that are not, a^ though they were.

-- When Fecknam took his leave, he said, That he was sorry for her; for I am
sure (said he) that we two shall never meet. True it is (said she) that we
shall never meet, except God turn your heart; for I am assured, unless you
repent and turn to God, you are in an evil case, and I pray God in the Bowels
of mercy, to send you his Holy Spirit. --

In her Letter to her Father. -- Father, although it has pleased God to hasten
my death by you, by whom my life should rather have been lengthened; yet can I
so patiently take it, as I yield to God more hearty thanks for shortening my
woeful days, than if all the world had been given unto my Possessions with life
lengthened at my own will. Page 33.
-- Although my death at hand to you seem right woeful, to me there is nothing
that can be more welcome, than from this vale of misery to aspire to that
heavenly Throne of all joy and pleasure, with Christ our Savior; in whose
steadfast faith (if it be lawful for the Daughter so to write to the Father) the
Lord that hitherto has strengthened you, so continue you, that at last we may
meet in Heaven, with the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.

In her Letter to Mr. Harding (formerly her Fathers Chaplain, and a zealous
Preacher of the Gospel, but then turned Papist) she writes thus. -- As often as I
call to mind the dreadful and fearful saying of God, That he which lays hold
on the Plough, Luke 9.
and looks back, is not meet for the Kingdom of Heaven; and on the other
side, the comfortable words of our Savior Christ to those, That forsaking
themselves do follow him. I cannot but marvel at thee, and lament thy Case, who
seemed sometime to be the lively Member of Christ, but now the deformed Imp of
the Devil; sometime the beautiful Temple of God, but now the filthy and
stinking Kennel of Satan; sometime the unspotted Spouse of Christ, but now the
shameless Paramour of Antichrist; sometime my faithful Brother, but now a
Stranger and an Apostate; sometime a stout Christian Soldier, but now a
cowardly Runaway: yea, when I consider these things, I cannot but cry out upon
thee, thou seed of Satan, and not of Judah, whom the Devil has deceived, the
world has beguiled, and the desire of life subverted, and made thee of a
Christian an Infidel. Wherefore have thou taken the Testament of the Lord in
thy mouth? Wherefore have thou instructed others to be strong in Christ, when
thou thy self do now so shamefully shrink, and so horribly abuse the
Testament and the Law of the Lord? When thou thy self preachest not to steal,
yet most abominably stealest, not from men, but from God, and committing most
heinous facriledge, robbest Christ thy Lord of his right members, thy body and
soul, and choosest rather to live miserably with shame to the world, than to
die, and gloriously with honor reign with Christ, in whom, even in death is
life? Why do thou now show thy self most weak, when indeed thou ought to
be most strong? The strength of a fort is unknown before the assault, but thou
yieldest thy hold, before any battery be made. Oh wretched and unhappy man,
what art thou but dust and ashes? and will thou resist thy Maker, that
fashioned and framed thee? Will thou now forsake him that called thee from the
customegathering of the Romish Antichristians, to be an Ambassador and
Messenger of his Word? He that first framed thee, and since the first Creation
and Birth preserved thee, nourished and kept thee, yea and inspired thee with
the Spirit of Knowledge (I cannot say of grace) shall he not now possess thee?
Dare thou deliver up thy self to another, being not thine own, but his? How
can thou, having knowledge, or how dare thou neglect the law of the Lord,
and follow the vain traditions of men; and whereas thou have been a public
Professor of his Name, become now a Defacer of his glory? W^lt thou refuse the
true God, and worship the invention of man, the golden Calf, the whore of
Babylon, the Romish Religion, the abominable Idol, the most wicked Mass? Will thou torment again, rent and tear the most precious Body of our Savior Corist
with thy bodily and fleshly teeth? Will thou take upon thee to offer up any
Sacrifice unto God for our sins, considering that Christ offered up himself (as
Paul says) upon the Cross a lively Sacrifice once for all. Can neither the
punishment of the Israelites, (which for their Idolatry they often received) nor
the terrible threatenings of the Prophets, nor the curses of Gods own mouth,
fear thee to honor any other God than him? Do thou so regard him that spared
not his dear and only Son for thee, so diminishing, yea utterly extinguishing
his glory, that thou will attribute the praise and honor due unto him to the
Idols, which have mouths, and speak not, eyes and see not, ears and hear not,
which shall perish with them that made thee. Pa. 34.
-- Confounded be all they that worship them. -- Christ offers up himself
once for all, and will thou offer him up again daily at thy pleasure? But thou will say, thou do it for a good intent. Oh sink of sin! Oh child of
perdition! Do thou dream therein of a good intent, where thy conscience bears
thee witness of Gods threatened wrath against thee? How did Saul, how for that
he disobeyed the Word of the Lord for a good intent, was thrown from his
worldly and temporal Kingdom? -- Will thou for a good intent dishonor God,
offend thy Brother, and danger thy soul, wherefore Christ has shed his most
precious blood? Will thou for a good intent pluck Christ out of Heaven, and
make his death void, and deface the triumph of his Cross by offering him up
daily? Will thou either for fear of death, or hope of life, deny and refuse thy
God, who enriched thy poverty, healed thy infirmity, and yielded to thee his
Victory, if thou could have kept it? Do thou not consider, that the thread
of thy life hangs upon him that made thee, who can (as he please) either
twine it harder to last the longer, or untwine it again to break the sooner?
Do thou not then remember the saying of David, Psa. 104.
When thou take away thy Spirit (O Lord) from men, they die, and are turned
again to their dust; but when thou let thy breath go forth, they shall be
made, and thou shall renew the face of the earth. Mat. 10.
Remember the saying of Christ in his Gospel; Whosoever seeks to save his
life shall lose it, but whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
Again, Whosoever loves Father or Mother above me, is not meet for me. He that
will follow me, let him forsake himself, and take up his Cross, and follow me.
What Cross? the Cross of infamy and shame, of misery, and poverty, of
affliction and persecution for his Names sake. Let the often falling of these
Heavenly Showers pierce thy stony heart. Let the two edged sword of Gods holy
Word sheer asunder the sinews of worldly respects, even to the marrow of the
carnal heart, that thou may once again forsake thy self, and embrace Christ,
and like as good subjects will not refuse to hazard all in the defense of their
earthly and temporal Governor, so fly not like a white-liver'd Milk-sop from
the standing wherein thy chief Captain Christ has set thee in array of this
life. Psalm. 16.
Fight manfully, come life, come death, the Quarrel is Gods, and undoubtedly
the Victory is ours. But thou will say, I will not break unity; what? not the
unity of Satan and his members? not the unity of darkness? not the agreement of
Antichrist and his adherents? -- Tully says of Amity, Amicitia non est nisi
inter bonos. But mark my Friends; yea Friend, if thou be not Gods enemy,
there is no unity, but where Christ knitteth the knot among such as he is. --
The agreement of all men is not an unity, but a conspiracy. Thou have heard
some threatenings against those that love themselves above Christ, and against
those that deny him for love of life; says he not, He that denies me before
men, Mat. 10.
I will deny him before my Father in Heaven. And to the same effect writes
Paul, It is impossible that they which were once enlightened, and have tasted
of the Heavenly Gift, and were partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted of
the good Word of God, if they fall away, etc. should be renewed again by
repentance. Heb. 10.
And again, If we shall willingly sin after we have received the knowledge of
his Truth, there is no oblation left for sin, but the terrible expectation of
judgment and fire, which shall devour the adversaries. Thus Paul writes, and
this thou read, and do thou not quake and tremble? Well, if these terrible
and thundering threatenings cannot stir thee to cleave unto Christ, and forsake
the world; yet let the sweet consolation and promises of the Scriptures, let
the example of Christ and his Apostles, holy Martyrs and Confessors encourage
thee to take faster hold of Christ. Hearken what he says, Mat. 5.
Blessed are you when men revile you, and persecute you for my sake: Rejoice
and be glad, for great is your reward in Heaven; For so persecuted they the
Prophets, that were before you. Hear what Isaiah says, Fear not tho curse of
men, Isa. 51.
be not afraid of their blasphemies; for worms and moths shall eat them up like
cloth and wool, but my righteousness shall endure for ever, and my saving
health from generation to generation. What art thou then (says he) that
fear a mortal man, the child of man, which fades away like the flower, and
forgets the Lord that made thee, that spread out the Heavens, and laid the
foundation of the earth? I am the Lord thy God, that makes the sea to rage,
and be still, whose Name is the Lord of Hosts: I shall put my Word in thy
mouth, and defend thee with the turning of the hand. Christ also says unto his
Disciples, They shall accuse you, Luke 12. Mat. 13.
and bring you before Princes and Rulers for my Names sake; and some of you
they shall persecute and kill; but fear you not, and care you not what you
shall say; for it is the Spirit of your Father that speaks within you, even
the hairs of your head are all numbered. Page 35.
Lay up treasures for your selves, where no thief comes, nor moth corrupts.
Fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; Mat. 10.
John 15.
but fear him that has power to destroy both soul and body. If ye were not of
the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world,
but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Let
these and such like consolations taken out of Scriptures, strengthen you to
Godward. Let not the examples of holy men and women go out of your mind, as
Daniel and the rest of the Prophets, of the three children, etc. -- Return,
return again into Christ's war, and as becomes a faithful warrior, Ephesians. 6.
put on that armor that St. Paul teaches to be most necessary for a Christian
man. And above all things take unto you the shield of Faith, and be you
provoked by Christ's own example, to withstand the Devil, to forsake the world,
and to become a true and faithful member of his mystical Body, who spared not
his own Body for our sins. Throw down your self with the fear of his threatened
vengeance for this so great and heinous offense of Apostasy, and comfort your
self on the other hand with the mercy, blood, and promise of him, who is ready
to turn unto you, whenever you turn unto him. Disdain not to come again with
the lost Son, seeing you have so wandered with him. Be not ashamed to turn again
with him from the swill of Strangers to the delicate of your most benign and
loving Father, acknowledging that you have sinned both against Heaven and
against Earth: Against Heaven, by staining the glorious Name of God, and
causing his most sincere and pure Word to be evil spoken of through you:
Against Earth, by offending so many of your weak Brethren, to whom you have
been a stumbling block through your sudden sl^ding. Be not ashamed -- to weep
bitterly with Peter -- to wash away the filth and mire of your offensive fall
-- to say with the Publican, Luke 18.
Lord, be merciful to me a sinner. Remember the horrible History of Julian of
old, and the lamentable case of Spira of late, whose case (methinks) should be
so green in your remembrance, that being a thing of our time, you should fear
the like inconvenience, seeing you are fallen into the like offense. Last of
all, let the lively remembrance of the last Day be always before your eyes,
remembering the terror that at that time shall befall the Runagates and
Fugitives from Christ, who setting more by the world than by Heaven, more by
their life than by him that gave them life, did shrink, yea fall away from him
that forsook not them; and contrariwise, the inestimable joys prepared for
them, that fearing no peril, nor dreading death, have manfully fought and
victoriously triumphed over all power of darkness, over hell, death, and
damnation, through their most renowned Captain Christ, who now stretches out
his arms to receive you, ready to fall upon your neck, and kiss you, and to
feast you with the dainties and delicates of his own precious blood, which
undoubtedly, if it might stand with his determinate purpose, he would not let
to shed again, rather than you shall be lost. --

The night before she suffered, she sent unto her Sister, the Lady Katharine
the New Testament in Greek, at the end whereof she wrote thus.

I have sent you (good Sister) a Book, which although it be not outwardly
trimmed with Gold, yet inwardly it is more worth than precious stones. It is
the Book of the Law of the Lord. It is his Testament and last Will which he
bequeathed unto us wretches, which shall lead you to the path of eternal joy;
and if you with a good mind read it, and with an earnest mind do purpose to
follow it, it shall bring you to an immortal and everlasting life. It shall
teach you to live, and learn you to die. It shall win you more than you should
have gained by the possession of your woeful Fathers lands; for, as if God had
prospered him, you should have inherited his lands: so if you ply diligently
this Book, seeking to direct your life after it, you shall be an inheriter of
such riches, as neither the covetous shall withdraw from you, nor the thief
steal, nor the moth corrupt. Desire with David to understand the Law of the
Lord God. Live still to die, that you by death may purchase eternal life. Trust
not that the tenderness of your age shall lengthen your life: the young die (if
God call) as soon as the old. Labor always to learn to die, defy the world,
deny the Devil, and despise the flesh, and delight your self only in the Lord.
Be penitent for your sins, but yet despair not; be strong in faith, and yet
presume not. Desire with St. Paul to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, with
whom, even in death, there is life. Be like the good Servant, and even at
midnight be waking, least when death comes, and steals upon you, as a thief
in the night, you be with the evil Servant found sleeping, and least for lack
of oil ye be found like the foolish women, and like him that had not on the
Wedding Garment, and then ye be cast out from the Marriage. Rejoice in Christ,
as I do. Follow the steps of your Master Christ, and take up your Cross. Lay
your sins on his back, and always embrace him. And as concerning my death,
rejoice as I do, that I shall be delivered of this corruption, and put on
incorruption; for I am assured, that I shall for loosing of a mortal life, win
an immortal life, the which I pray God grant you, and send you of his grace to
live in his fear, and to die in the true Christian Faith, from the which (in
Gods Name) I exhort you that you never swarve, neither for hope of life, nor
fear of death; for if you will deny his truth for to lengthen your life, God
will deny you, and yet shorten your days. And if you will cleave unto him, he
will prolong your days to your comfort and his glory; to the which glory God
bring me now, and you hereafter, when it shall please him to call you. Fare you
well (good Sister) and put your only trust in God, who only must help you.

In her Speech upon the Scaffold. -- Good people, I am come hither to die, and
by a Law I am condemned to the same. The fact against the Queens Highness was
unlawful, and the consenting thereunto by me; but touching the procurement and
desire thereof, I do wash my hands thereof in innocence before God and you, and
therewith she wrung her hands. I pray you bear me witness, that I die a true
Christian, and that I look to be saved by no other mean, but only by the mercy
of God in the blood of his only Son Jesus Christ. I confess, when I did know
the Word of God, I neglected the same, loved my self and the world, and
therefore this plague is worthily happened to me for my sins; and yet I thank
God of his goodness, that he has thus given me a time and respite to repent;
and now, good people, while I am alive, I pray you assist me with your Prayers.
--

In her Prayer. -- Thou, O Lord, art the only Defender and Deliverer of those
that put their trust in thee; and therefore I being defiled with sin, etc.
overwhelmed with miseries, vexed with temptations, and grievously tormented.
With the long imprisonment of this vile mass of clay, my sinful body, does come
unto thee (O merciful Savior) craving thy mercy and help, who have said, Thou will not suffer us to be tempted above our power. -- O merciful God, consider
my misery best known unto thee, and be thou unto me a strong Tower of defense.
Suffer me not to be tempted above my power, but either be thou a Deliverer to
me out of this great misery, or else give me grace patiently to bear thy heavy
hand and sharp correction. It was thy right hand that delivered the people of
Israel out of the hands of Pharaoh, who for the space of four hundred years did
oppress them, and keep them in bondage. O deliver me sorrowful wretch! (for
whom thy Son Christ shed his precious blood on the Cross) out of this miserable
captivity and bondage. How long will thou be absent? for ever? O Lord, have
thou forgotten to be gracious, and shut up thy loving kindness in displeasure?
Will thou be no more entreated? Is thy mercy clean gone for ever, and thy
promise come utterly to an end for evermore? Why do thou make so long
tarrying? Shall I despair of thy mercy O God? far be that from me. I am thy
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus; give me therefore grace to tarry thy
leisure. --

When the Handkerchief was tied about her eyes, she kneeling down, and feeling
for the Block, said, What shall I do? where is it? and being directed by one of
the Standers by, she laid her head down upon the Block, and stretching forth
her Body, said, Lord, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.

In her troubles she writ the following Verses with a pin. Clarks second V^lume
of Lives. p. 60, etc.
Non aliena putes homini, quae obtingere possunt;
Sors h^dierna mihi, tunc crit illa tibi.


In English thus, Think nothing strange which man cannot decline (...)
My Lot's to day, to morrow may be thine.
Deo juvante, nil nocet livor malus:
Et non juvante, nil juvat labor gravis.
Post tenebras spero lucem.


In English thus, If God pretect me, malice cannot end me,
If not, all I can do will not defend me.
After dark night
I hope for light.


H.
Haggar.
He was persecuted for saying, ( A. 1520.) Fox, Vol. ^. page 44.
that There should be a battle of Priests, and all the Priests should be slain:
and that the Priests should a while rule, but they should all be destroyed for
making of false gods. -- That the men of the Church should be put down, and the
false gods that they make: and after that, they should know more, and then
should be a merry world.

Hale.
When Thomas Hale was taken by an Alderman of Bristow and another, he said unto
them, Fox, Vol. 3. page 892.
You have sought my blood these two years, and now much good do it you.

He was b^rned A. 1557. for saying, The Sacrament of the Altar is an Idol.

Hall.
Nichalas Hall in his Answer to the first Article against him, granted himself
a Christian man, Fox Vol. 3. page 38^.
and acknowledged the determinations of the holy Church, i. e. of the
Congregation, or Body of Christ: but denied to call the Catholic and
Apostolic Church his Mother, because he found not this Word, Mother, in the
Scripture.

To the second he said, That whereas before he held the Sacrament to be but
only a token or remembrance of Christ's death, now he said, that There is
neither token nor remembrance, because it is now misused, and clean turned from
Christ's institution, etc.

Hallewin. Harman.
When Cornelius Hallewin of Antwerp had received a sharp Letter, Fox, Vol. 3.
Cont. p. 7.
sent him from the Minister of the Flemish Church, upon the occasion of a
recantation spread and falsely fathered upon Cornelius: the blood gushed out of
his nose, he spread abroad his arms, and made pitiful outcries. What to deny
the Truth (said he) God forlid! O that the faithful should conceive so hardly
of me! Good God, thou know I am innocent, nor have I this way offended.

When he was condemned to die, the Margrave offered him, that he should die a
more easy kind of death, if he would give ear to the Priests, which he had
brought to him to Prison: No Sir (said he) God forbid I should do such a thing.
Do ye with my body what ye will.

As they bound him and Harman of Amsterdam, Harman w^lled the Margrave to take
heed what he did; for (said he) this will not go for payment in Gods sight in
bereaving us thus of our Lives. I wish you therefore to repent before it be too
late. You cannot long continue this tyrannous course; for the Lord will shortly
avenge it.

A Cross being offered them, and a promise that they should be beheaded, and
not burnt, if they would take it into their hands, they said, They would not
give the least sign, that might be, of betraying the Truth, and that it was all
one to them what death they were put to, so they died in and for the Lord. The
punishment (they said) could last but for a while, ^ut the glory to come was
eternal.

At the Stake Cornelius fell on his knees, praying God to forgive his enemies,
who had sinned through ignorance.

When the Margrave of Antwerp offered Hallewin and Harmar mitigation of
torments upon abjuration: Ward, page 157.
We are resolved (said they) these momentary afflictions are not worthy that
exceeding weight of glory, that shall be revealed.

Hallingdale.
Articles against John Hallingdale. Fox, Vol. 3. page 856.
-- (3) That during the reign of King Edward, he did depart from his former
Faith and Religion, and so does continue, and determines so to do, (as he
says) to his life's end. (4) That he has diverse times said, That the Faith,
Religion, and Ecclesiastical Service, received, observed, and used now in this
Realm is not good, but against Gods command, etc. And that he will not in any
wise conform himself to the same, but speak, and think against it during his
natural life. (5) That he absenteth himself continually from his Parish Church,
etc. (6) That he will not have his Child by his will (as he says) confirmed by
the Bishop. Unto all which Articles he made this answer, that he confessed all,
and every part to be true.

He told Bonner, that the blood of the Prophets, Revel. 18
and of the Saints, and of all that were slain upon the Earth, was found in the
Babylonical Church, which is the Church where the Pope is head. -- Because I
will not come to your Babylonical Church, therefore you go about to condemn me.

Being demanded whether he would recant, he answered, That he would continue,
and persist in his Opinions to the death.

When the Sentence was read, He openly thanked God, that he never came into the
Church, since the abomination came into it.

Hallywell.
When William Hallynell and the twelve more (that were burnt in one Fire at
Stratford the Bo^ near London) were condemned, Fox, Vol. 3. page 708.
and carried down thither to be burnt, they were divided into two parts, in two
several Chambers: Thereupon the Sheriff came to the one part, and told them,
That the other had recanted, and their lives therefore should be saved, willing
and exhorting them to do the like, and not to cast away themselves: unto whom
they answered, That their Faith was not built on man, but on Christ crucified:
Then the Sheriff went to the other part, and said the like to them; but they
answered as their Brethren had done before, That their Faith was not built on
man, but on Christ and his Word.

Hamelin.
Mr. Philibert Hamelin of Tournay, Fox, Vol. 3. Cont. p. 5.
refusing offers of escape out of Prison, said, I esteem it altogether
unbeseeming for a man, that is called to preach Gods Word unto others, to run
away, and to break Prison, for fear of danger, but rather to maintain the Truth
taught even in the midst of the flaming fire.

After Sentence of death was past upon him, he eat his meat as joyfully, as
though he had been in no danger, speaking to them of the happiness of eternal
life, evidencing that A good conscience is a continual feast.

When he was apprehended, Fox, Vol. 2 page 151.
there was apprehended with him, his Host, whom he thought he had converted,
but afterward he renounced Christ and his Word: Whereupon he said unto him, O
unhappy, and more than miserable! Is it possible for you to be so foolish, as
for the saving of a few days, which you have to live by the course of nature,
so tostart away, and deny the Truth? Know you therefore, that although you have
by your foolishness avoided the corporal fire, yet your life shall be never the
longer; for you shall die before me, and God shall not give you the grace, that
it shall be for his Cause, and you shall be an example to all Apostates.

Immediately after, as he was going out of the Prison he was slain by two
Gentlemen, that had a quarrel with him: whereof when Mr. Hamelin heard, he
professed he knew of no such thing before, but spoke as pleased God to guide
his tongue. And thereupon discoursed excellently of the providence of God, to
the conversion of some present.

When he was in Prison a Priest came in one Sabbath with all his furniture to
say Mass: but Mr. Hamelin, when he saw him, pulled off his garments, etc.
saying, Is it not enough for you to blaspheme God in Churches, but you must
also pollute the Prison with your idolatry?

Hamilton.
Mr. Patrick Hamilton, The Eccles. Hist. of Scotl. p. 4.
Brothers Son to James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, and Sisters Son to John Stuart,
Duke of Althai, hating the world, and the vanity thereof, left Scotland, and
traveled into Germany, where he became intimate with Martin Luther, Philip
Melancthon, Francis Lambert, and became an eminent Professor, the zeal of Gods
glory did eat him up, so that he could not choose, but he must return into his
own Country to make known the Gospel.

Articles objected against him. Fox, Vol. 2. page 227.
-- That the P^pe is Antichrist. -- That the Popes Laws be of no strength, --
That he doubted, Whether all Children, departing immediately after their
baptism, are saved or condemned.

At the place of Execution he gave his Servant (who had been his Chamberlain a
long time) Scor. Hist. page 4.
his Gown, Coat, etc. saying, These will not profit in the fire, they will
profit thee. After this, of me thou can receive no commodity, except the
example of my death, Page 6.
which I pray thee bear in mind; for albeit it be bitter to the flesh, and
fearful before men, yet it is the entrance unto eternal life, which none shall
possess that denies Christ Jesus before this wicked Generation.

The fire being kindled, he cried with a loud voice, Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit. How long shall darkness overwhelm this Realm? And how long will thou
suffer this tyranny of men?

A Black Friar, called Campbel, who had pretended some love to the Gospel,
cried out to him, Convert Heretic, call upon our Lady, say Salve Regina, etc.
His answer was, Depart and trouble me not, thou Messenger of Satan. -- Wicked
man, thou know the contrary, and the contrary to me thou have confessed. I
appeal thee before the tribunal seat of Christ Jesus.

Mr. Fox says, Vol. 2. page 218.
That he cited him to appear before the High God, as general Judge of all men,
to answer to the innocence of his death, etc. between that and a certain day of
the next Month, which he there named: and that the Friar died before the said
day came, without remorse of conscience, that he had persecuted the innocent.

He was burnt Feb. ult. A. 1527.

In his Treatise styled Patricksplaces, Pa. 229.
by Mr. John Frith, who translated it out of Latin into English. -- He that
loves God loves his Neighbor. If a man say, 1 John 4. Romans 13. Galat. 5.
John 16. Pa. 230. Romans 9.
I love God, and yet hates his Brether, is a Liar, etc. He that loves his
Neighbor as himself, keeps all the Commandments of God. -- He that has,
faith loves God. My Father loves you, because you love me, and believe that I
am come of God. -- It is not in our power to keep any one of the Commandments
of God. -- But you will say, Wherefore does God bid us do that which is
impossible for us? I answer, To make thee know that thou art but evil, and that
there is no remedy to save thee in thine own hand, and that thou may seek
remedy at some other, etc. -- The remedy is showed in the Gospel. -- To believe
God is to believe his Word, and to account what he says true. -- Faith is the
gift of God. -- Faith is not in our power. Pa. 231.
-- He that lacks Faith cannot please God. -- All that is done in Faith
pleases God. Pa. 232.
He that believes the Gospel shall be saved. -- No manner of works make us
righteous. Pa. 233.
-- He that thinks to be saved by his works, calls himself Christ. -- Thou
must do good works, but beware that thou do them not to deserve any good
through them. --

Mrs. Katherine Hamilton (Sister to Mr. See the Preface before the Eccles.
Hist. of Scotland.
Patrick) was also accused; and being questioned about works, she answered,
That none was saved by his works. One thereupon speaking to her of the works of
Congrno and Condigno, she answered, Work here, work there, what kind of working
is all this? No works can save me but Christ's.

Hamell.
W^^n Godfrey Hamel was condemned for an Heretic: Nay (said he) not an
Heretic, Fox, Vol. 2. page 127.
but an unprofitable servant of Jesus Christ.

When the Hangman went about to strangle him, to diminish his punishment, he
refused it, saying, That he would abide the Sentence, that the Judges had given.

Hankes.
Mr. Fox, Vol. 3. Page 256.
Thomas Hankes being asked by Bonner why he suffered his Child to be
unchristened so long? answered, Because we be bound to d^nothing contrary to
the Word of God. Being told, that Baptism is commanded by the Word of God: His
institution therein (said he) I do not deny; but all things invented and
devised by man, etc. But will you (said Bonner) deny that which all the World
and your Father have been contensed withal? What my Father (said Hankes) and
all the World has done. I have nothing to do with, but what God has commanded
me to do, to that stand I. Pa. 257.
Bonner telling him that Baget was converted to think well of their Baptism: I
build my faith (said he) neither upon this man, nor upon you; but upon Christ,
who is the founder and author of all men's faith.

Bonner threatening to take another course with him: Whatsoever ye do (said he)
I am ready to suffer it; for I am in your hands to abids it.

Bonner telling him he would not have any Heresy talked in his House: Why
(said he) is the Truth become Heresy? God has commanded that we should have
none other talk in our House, in our Beds, at our Meat, and by the way, but all
I ruth.

Darbishire (Bonners Kinsman) telling him, he was too curious; for he would
have nothing but his pretty Gods Book: he answered, And is it not sufficient
for my salvation? Yes (said D.) for our salvation; but not for our instruction.
God send me the salvation (said H.) and you the instruction.

Bonner threatening him again: You are (said he) in the hands of God, and so am
I. -- That which I have said, I will stand to it God willing, there is no way
to remove it.

Bonner telling him that a Faggot would make him know and believe the Sacrament
of the Altar: No, no (said he) a point for your Faggot. What God thinks meet
to be d^ne, that shall ye do, and mere ye shall not do.

Bonner telling him, That he was willing to teach him, but he was so stubborn,
that ^e would not learn: Except ye learn me (said he) by the Word of God, I
will never credit you, nor believe you.

Harpsfield telling him, If his Child died unchristened, he was damned and his
Child both: Judge you no farther (said he) than ye may by the Scriptures. Pa.
259.
-- How can your Child being an Insant (said Harpsfield) believe? The
deliverance of it (said Hankes) from sin standath in the faith of his Parents,
Saint Paul saying, -- Else were your Children unclean. 1 Cor. 7.
To trust to any (said Bonner) we bid you not; but to pray to them, we bid you:
They that list (said Hankes) receive your Dectrine. You teach me, that I should
not believe, nor trust in any, but to call on them; and Saint Paul says, How
shall I call on him, on whom I believe not?

Bonner calling him fool: he said, A Bishop must be blameless, or faultless,
soler, discreet, no chider, nor given to anger.

Mr. Hankes telling Bonner, That Christ says, These tokens shall follow them
that believe in me: Pa. 216. Mark 16
They shali speak with new tongnes, cast out Devils; and if any drink deadly
poison, it shall net hurt them. Bonner asked him, With what new tongues do ye
speak? Forso^th (said Hankes) where before I came to the knowledge of Gods
Word, I was a foul Blasphemer and filthy talker. Since I came to the knowledge
thereof, I have praised God with the same tongue, and is not this a new tongue?
H^w do you (said Bonner) cast out Devils? Christ (said Hankes) did east them
out by his Word; and he has left the save Word, that whoscever does credit,
and believe it, shall cast out Devils. Did you (said Bonner) ever drink deadly
poison? Yea forsooth that I have (said Hankes) for I have drunk of the
testilent Traditions and Ceremonies of the Bishop of Rome.

Bonner threatening that he should be burnt for an Heretic: Where prove ye
(said Hankes) that Christ, or his Apostles did kill any man for his faith? Did
not Paul (said B.) excommunicate? Yes, my Lord (said H.) but there is a great
difference between excommunlcation, and burning. -- If you will have us grant
you to be of God, then show mercy; for that God requires.

An old Bishop persuading him to learn of his Elders to bear somewhat: I will
bear with nothing (said he) that is contrary to the Word of God.

Fecknam charging him for building his Faith on Latimer, Pa. 261.
Cranmer, Ridley, etc. I build my Faith (said he) upon no man, and that ye well
know; for if those men, and as many more, as they be, should recant, and deny
that they have said, or done, yet will I stand to it, and by this shall ye know
that I build my Faith upon no man.

Chadsey asking him, What he said of the Bishop of Rome? From him (said he) and
all his detestable enormities, good Lord deliver us.

Bonner saying, You speak of Idols, and you know not what they mean: God has
taught us what they be; (said Hankes) for whatsoever is made, graven, or
devised by man's hand, contrary to Gods Word, the same is an Idol.

Chadsey telling him, Pa. 262.
It was pity he should live: In this case (said he) I desire not to live, but
rather to die. -- I would my part might be to morrow.

Bonner threatening to send him to Newgate: My Lord (said he) you can do me no
better pleasure.

Bonner telling the Keeper, Pa. 263.
His Prisoner would not go to the Sermon: Yes, My Lord (said he) I pray you let
me go, and that that is good I will receive, and the rest I will leave behind
me.

Bonner asking after his imprisonment, Whether he was the same man he was
before? he answered, I am no Changeling, nor none will be.

Miles Huggard asking him, Where he proved that Infants were to be baptized? Go
teach all Nations (said he) baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghest. Sir, here is none excepted.

Bonner threatening him again: Pa. 264.
Ye shall do no more (said he) than God shall give you leave. -- As for your
cursings, railings, and blasphemings, I care not for them; for I know the moths
and worms shall eat you, as they eat cloth or wool. --

His examination he writ himself, and subscribed it, T. H. Who desires all
faithful men, and Brethren, to pray unto God to strengthen me in his Truth unto
the end. Pray, pray, pray, gentle Brethren, pray.

Bonner advising him at his public examination to speak advisedly; Pa. 265.
for he stood upon life and death: Well (said he) I will willingly receive what
shall be put unto me. -- My Lord, as you be my friend in causing these my
sayings to be written; so do you cause them to be read, and yet I will never go
from them.

Being exhorted to return again to the bosom of the Mother Church: No, my
Lord, (said he) that will I not; for if I had an hundred bodies, I would suffer
them all to be torn in pieces, rather than I will abjure, or recant.

Some of his Friends being not a little confirmed by his example, and
discourses, yet being somewhat afraid of so sharp a punishment, desired him
alittle before his death, that in the midst of the flame he would show some
token, if he could, whereby they might be more certain, whether the pain of
burning were so great, Pa. 266.
that a man might not therein keep his mind quiet and patient: Whereupon it was
agreed between them, that if the rage of the pain were tolerable, then he
should lift up his hands above his head toward Heaven, before he gave up the
ghost. Accordingly, when he had continued long in the fire, his speech taken
away, his skin drawn together, his singers consumed, so that all concluded he
was dead; contrary to all expectation, he reached up his hands, burning on a
light fire, over his head, to the living God and with great rejoicing (as it
seemed) clapped them three times together.

He was burned to ashes, June 10. 1555.

In his Letter to the Congregation. --

The holy Spirit conduct and lead you all in all your doings, that you may
always direct your deeds according to his holy Word, that when he shall appear
to reward every man according to his works, ye may as obedient children, be
found watching, ready to enter into his everlasting Kingdom, with your Lamps
burning, and not be ashamed of this life, which God has lent you, etc. All
flesh (says the Prophet) is grass, and all his glory as the flower of the
field, which for a season shows her beauty, and as soon as the Lord blows
upon it, it withers away, and departs. Here we are as Pilgrims and
Strangers, following the footsteps of Moses, among many unspeakable dangers,
etc. -- in danger of that dreadful Dragon, and his sinful seed, to be tempted,
devoured, and tormented, who cease not behind every Busn to lay a bait, etc.
casting abroad his Apples in all places, times, and seasons, to see if Adam,
will be allured and enticed to leave the living God, and his most holy
commandment, etc. promising the world at will, to all that will fall down, and
for a mess of pottage sell, and set at naught the everlasting Kingdom of
Heaven. -- Therefore I am bold in bond (as entirely desiring your everlasting
selicity) to warn you, and most heartily desire you to watch and pray. -- On
the high mountains does not grow most plenty of gra^s, neither are the highest
trees farthest from danger, but feldome sure, and always shaken of every wind
that blows. Such a deceitful thing (says our Savior) is honor and riches,
that withour grace, it choketh up the good seed sown, etc. It makes a man
think himself somewhat, that is nothing at all; for though for our honor we
esteem our selves, and stand in our own light, yet when we shall stand before
the living God, there shall be no respect of persons; for riches helps not in
the day of vengeance, nor can we make the Lord partial for money.

-- Though the world rage, Prove. 1.
and blaspheme the Elect of God, ye know that it did so unto Christ, his
Apostles, and to all that were in the Prinitive Church, and shall be unto the
worlds end. -- I beseech you in the bowels of Christ my Lord Jesus, stick sast
unto the Truth: let it never depart out of your hearts and conversations, etc.

Yours in him that lives for ever.


In his Letter to his Wife, Pa. 267.
after his Condemnation. -- I exhort you to love God with all your heart, and
soul, and mind, etc. To lay sure hold on all his promises, that in all your
troubles you may run strait to the great mercy of God, etc. And be sure that
neither Devil, Flesh, nor Hell shall be able to hurt you. But if you will not
keep his holy Precepts, and call for Gods help to walk in the same, but will
leave them, and do as the wicked world does, then be sure to have your part
with the wicked world in the burning lake. Beware of Idolatry, which most of
all stinks in Gods Nostrils, and has been of all good men derested from the
beginning of the world, for the which what Kingdoms, etc. God has punished
with most terrible plagues, etc. to the utter subversion of them, is manifestly
to be seen through the whole Bible; yea, for this he dreadfully plagued his own
people, etc. But how he has preserved those that abhorred superstition and
idolatry, etc. is also to be seen from the beginning, out of what great danger
he has delivered them; yea, when all hope of deliverance was past, as touching
their expectation, etc. I exhort you also in the bowels of Christ, that you
will exercise, and be steadfast in Prayer, the only mean to obtain of God
whatsoever we desire, so it be asked in Faith. O what notable things do we read
in Scripture, that have been obtained through fervent Prayer! -- Whatsoever you
desire of God in Prayer, ask it for Jesus Christ's sake, for whom and in whom
God has promised to give us all things necessary. Though what we ask come not
by and by, continue still knocking, and he will at length open his treasures of
mercy, etc. -- Yet once again I warn you, that ye continue fervent in Prayer,
etc.

In his Letter to Mr. Pa. 268.
Throgmorton. --

Whereas the love of God has moved you to require my Son to be brought up
before your eyes, and the self same love has also moved me to leave him in
your hands as a Father in my absence, I shall require you in Gods behalf,
according to your promise, that ye will see him brought up in the fear of the
Lord, and instructed in the knowledge of his holy Word, that he may learn to
leave the evil, and know the good, etc. And this I require you to fulfill, or
cause to be fulfilled, as ye before the Living God will make answer for the
same. --

Yours, and all men's in Christ Jesus.


Hector.
Bartholomen Hector, being condemned, Fox, Vol. 2 page 155.
was threatened, that if he spoke any thing to the People, his Tongue should be
cut off; yet he did not forbear.

He prayed for the Judges, That God would forgive them, and open their eyes.

He refused a Pardon, offered him at the Stake.

At his Death many wept, saying, Why does this man die, who speaks of nothing
but of God?

When he was called before Authority to be examined, Fox, Vol. 3 cont. page 5.
he would answer them to nothing before he had made his Prayer to God:
Whereupon falling down upon his knees, he said, Lord, open my mouth, and direct
my Speech to utter that only, that may tend to thy honor and glory, and the
edification of thy Church.

When he was bound to the Stake, Gunpowder and Brimstone was brought to be
placed about him; he lifting up his eyes to Heaven, said, Lord, how sweet and
welcome is this to me?

Hernaudes.
Mr. Julian Hernaudes, Fox, Vol. 3. cont. p. 14.
(a Spanish Martyr) came from the Wrack, and the Tortures of the Inquisition
inflicted on him, for bringing with him, and causing to brought into Spain,
many Books of the Holy Scriptures in Spanish) as from a Conquest, saying to his
Fellow Prisoners as he past by them, These Hypocrites are gone away confounded,
no less than wolves, that have been long hunted.

When he was brought forth to his Execution, he said to the rest, Courage, my
valiant and constant Brethren, non is the hour come, in which as the true
Champions of Jesus Christ, we must witness his Truth before men, and for a
short trial for his sake we shall triumph with him for ever and ever.

Herwyn.
When John Herwyn of Flanders, Fox, Vol. 3. Cont p. 17.
was led to Prison, the Ba^liffe meeting certain Drunkards in the Street, and
saying, They say we have many Gospellers in Houscot, but it little appears by
these disorders: he replied, Mr. Bailiffe, is drankenness a sin? What of that
(said the Ba^liffe) Why then (said Herwyn) commit you not these fellows to
Prison, seeing it is your office to punish vice, and to protect such as fear
God?

After he was in Prison, because he was not called forth before the
Magistrates, as soon as he desired and expected, he grew heavy and sad, asking,
Why they so delayed the matter? for his he art was fired with an holy zeal to
confess Christ before his Judges.

When he was brought forth, he admonished his Judges to examine the Doctrine of
the Roman Church by the true Touchstone, which is the holy Scripture, that so
they might discern how opposite and contrary the one is to the other. Consider
also (said he) what the words of St. Peter import, where he affirms, That we
ought to obey God rather that man, etc.

When he craved for Justice, either one way or another, they urged him to
desist from his Opinion; but he answered, That his faith was not built on an
Opinion, Psalm. 14.
but (said he) the Lord has taught me to eschew evil, and do good.

See thou not (said they) how these opinions have troubled the world? and how
many of the learneder sort do contradict them? So far is it off (said he) that
the Doctrine of the Gospel should be the cause of troubles, debates and strife
swhich reign in the world. These troubles indeed arise from the rage of men.
And as for your learned men, it is impossible for humane wisdom to comprehend
the Doctrine of God; for which cause Christ says, Father I thank thee, that
thou have hid these secrets from the wise men of the world, and have revealed
them unto Babes.

When those two Malefactors that were coupled with him brake Prison and fled,
he might have escaped, but fearing his flight might be imputed to the godly
Christians in the City, he would not fly.

When he was advertised of his Sentence, He thanked God for advancing him to so
high an honor at to be counted worthy to suffer for his Name.

As he passed forth from the Court, viewing the people, who waited to see him,
he said, See here how this wicked world rewards the poor Servants of Christ.
Whilst I gave my self to drunkenness, etc. I was never in danger of these
bands (lifting up his hands which were bound) I was then counted a good fellow,
and at that time, who but I? But no sooner began I by conversion to ask after a
godly life, but the world made war upon me, and became my enemy, persecuting
and imprisoning me, and now last of all sending me to the place where I must
pay my last debt. Mat. 10.24. Joh. 15.20.
But the Servant is no better than his Lord; for seeing they persecuted him, no
question they will persecute us.

At the Stake he said, Brethren, I fight under the Standard, and in the quarrel
of my great Lord and Ca^tain Christ. -- I am now going to be trucified; follow
you me, when God of his goodness shall call you to it.

He was burnt Nov. 4. An. 1560.

Hierome.
I find two of this Name.

1. Fox, Vol. 2 page 524.
Mr. William Hierome, Vicar of Stepney near London.

Being accused for preaching against Magistrates, he affirmed (as before he had
preached) That no Magistrate of himself could make any Law or Laws to bind the
inferior people, unless it were by the power and authority of his or their
Princes to him or them given, but only the Prince. Adding, If the Prince make
Laws consenting to Gods Laws, we are bound to obey them; and if he make Laws
repugnant to the Laws of God, etc. yet we are bound not violently to resist, or
grudge against him.

At the Stake he gave the following Exhortation to the people; Pa. 527.
I say unto you, good Brethren, that God has bought us all with no small
price, neither with gold, nor silver, nor other such things of small value, but
with his ^^st precious blood. Be not unthankful therefore, but do what you can
to keep his Commandments, Pa. 528.
i. e. love your Brethren. -- If God has sent thee plenty, help thy neighbor
that has need, give him good counsel, if he lack. -- Bear your Cross with
Christ. -- Let all Christians put no trust nor confidence in their works, but
in the blood of Christ, to whom I commit my soul, beseeching you all to pray to
God for me, and for my Brethren here present with us, etc.

2. Mr. Hierome of Prague.

When he was brought Prisoner to Constance, Fox, Vol. 1. Page 832.
several of the Bishops said unto him, Hierome, why did thou fly and did
not appear when thou wast cited? He answered, Because I could not have any safe
conduct, etc. and I would not my self be the occasion of my perils and danger;
but if I had known of this citation, although I had been in Bohemis, I would
have returned again.

When certain cried out, Let him be burned, Pa. 833.
let him be burned; He answered, If my death does delight and please you, in
the Name of God let it be so.

When he was welcomed to Prison by a Friend of Mr. Hus, saying to him, Be
constant, and fear not death for the Truths sake, of the which when you were at
liberty, you did preach so much goodness; He answered, Truly Brother, I do not
fear death; and forasmuch as we know that we have spoken much thereof in times
past, let us now see what may be known or done in effect.

Vitus Asking him how he did, He answered, Truly Brother I do very well.

After a long sore imprisonment he was forced to recant and consent unto the
death of Mr. John Hus, that he was justly condemned, and put to death; but his
hopes of freedom thereupon were disappointed, Pa. 834.
for they caused him to be carried back unto the same Prison, but not so
straightly chained and bound as before.

After his Recantation and Consent to the death of Mr. Hus, he refused to
answer to any Questions propounded to him in private, except he might be
brought before the Council; They supposing he would confirm his former
Recantation, sent for him May 25. An. 1416.

When he was brought before them, Pa. 835.
he began with Prayer to God, beseeching him to give him Spirit, ability and
utterance, which might most tend to the profit and salvation of his own soul.

Then he spoke unto them thus; I know that the^e have been many excellent men
which have suffered much otherwise, than they have deserved, being oppressed
with false witnesses, and condemned with wrong judgment, as Socrates, Plato,
Anaxagoras, Zeno, Boethius, Moses, Joseph, Isaiah, Daniel, and almost all the
Prophets, etc. John Baptist, Christ, Stephen, and all the Apostles who were
condemned to death not as good men, but as seditious stirrers up of the people,
and contemners of the gods and evil doers. -- This was the old manner of
ancient and learned men, and most holy Elders, that in matters of Faith they
did differ many times in Arguments, not to destroy the Faith, but to find out
the Verity: So did Augustine and Hierome dissent. -- As for Mr. Hus, he was a
good, just and holy man (^o his knowledge) and much unworthy that death which
he did suffer. Pa. 836.
-- At last he added, That all the sins that ever he had committed did not so
much gnaw and trouble his conscience, as did that only sin, which he had
committed, in that most pestiferous fact, when as in his Recantation he had
unjustly spoken against that good and holy man and his Doctrine, and especially
in consenting to his wicked condemnation. Concluding that he did utterly revoke
that wicked Recantation, which he made in that cursed place, and that he did it
through weakness of heart and fear of death, and that whatsoever he had spoken
against that blessed man, he had altogether lied upon him, and that it did
repent him with his whole heart that ever he did it. --

Being again brought forth to have judgment given him, and pressed to recant
what he had before spoken in open audience in commendation of M. Wickliff and
Mr. Hus, He said unto them, I take G^d to my witness, and I protest here before
you all, that I do belive and hold the Articles of the Faith, a^ the holy
Catholic Church does hold and believe the same; but for this cause shall I now
be condemned, for that I will not consent with you to the condemnation of those
most holy and blessed men aforesaid, whom you have most wickedly condemned, for
their detesting and abhorring your wicked and abominable life.

After the Bishop of Londy had ended his Sermon, which was but an exhortation
to condemn Mr. Hierome, he said unto them, You shall condemn me wickedly and
unjustly; but I after my death will leave a remorse in my conscience, and a
nail in your heart, and here I cite you to answer unto me before the most high
and just Judge within an hundred years.

This Prophecy was printed in the Coin called moneta Hussi, Pa. 830.
of the which Coin I my self (says Mr. Fox) have one of the Plates, having the
following sperscription printed about it, Centum revolutis annis Deo
respondebitis and mihi.

An hundred years come and gone,
With God and me you shall reck^n.
After Sentence was pronounced against him, Pa. 837.
a long Mitre of paper, painted about with red Devils was brought to him,
whereupon he said, Our Lord Jesus Christ, whenas he should suffer death for me,
most wretched sinner, did wear a Crown of Thorns upon his Head, and I for his
sake, instead of that Crown will willingly wear this Mitre or Cap.

When the fire was kindled he said, Pa. 838. Clarks Mart. of Eccl. Hist. page
223.
Into thy hands O Lord I commend my Spirit. -- O Lord God, Father Almighty,
have mercy upon me, and pardon mine effences, for thou know how sincerely I
have loved thy Truth.

When the Executioner began to kindle the fire behind him, he bade him kindle
it before his face; for (said he) If I had been afraid of it, I had not come to
this place, having had so many opportunities offered to me to escape it.

At the giving up of the ghost he said, Hanc animam in flammis offero Christ
tibi.
This soul of mine in flames of fire,
O Christ I offer thee. --


In his Letter to Mr. Fox. Vol. 1. page 830.
John Hus. -- My Master, in those things which you have both written hitherto,
and also preached after the Law of God, against the pride, avarice, and other
inordinate vices of the Priests, go forward, be constant and strong, and if I
shall know that you be oppressed in the cause, and if need shall so require, of
mine own accord I will follow after to help you as much as I can. Petrie 's
Church Hist. Gent. 15. p. 539.


In the Letter of Poggius ( Secretary to the Council of Constance) to Leonard
Aretine concerning Hierome's death --

I profess I never saw any man, who in talking, especially for life and death,
has come nearer the eloquence of the Ancients, whom we do so much admire. It
was a wonder to see with what words, with what Eloquence, Arguments,
Countenance, and with what confidence he answered his Adversaries, and
maintained his own Cause: that it is to be lamented that so fine a wit had
strayed into the study of Heresy, if it be true that was objected against him.
-- When it was refused that he should first plead his own Cause, and then
answer to the railings of Adversaries, he said, How great is this iniquity,
that when I have been three hundred and forty days in most hard prisons, in
filthiness, in dung, in fetters, and want of all things, ye have heard my
Adversaries at all times, and ye will not hear me one hour? -- Ye are men, and
not gods; ye may slip, and err, and be deceived, and seduced, etc. When it was
demanded what he could object to the Articles against him? It is almost
incredible to consider how cunningly he answered, and with what Arguments he
defended himself. He never spoke one word unworthy of a good man; that if he
thought in his heart, as he spoke with his tongue, no cause of death could have
been against him, no not of the meanest offense. -- In the end Poggius says, O
man, worthy of everlasting remembrance among men! This Epistle is in
Fasciculrer, expetend. fol. 152.

Holland.
A Friend of Mr. Roger Holland's thanking the Bishop for his good will to his
Kinsman, and beseeching God that he might have grace to follow his Council; Sir
(said Mr. Holland) You crave of God you know not what, I beseech God to open
your eyes to see the light of his Word. Roger (said his Kinsman) hold your
peace, lest you fare the worse at my Lords hands. No (said he) I shall fare as
it pleases God, for man can do no more then God does permit him.

The Register asking him, Fox, Vol. 3 page 875.
Whether he would submit himself to the Bishop, before he was entered into the
Book of contempt. I never meant (said he) but to submit my self to the
Magistrate, as I learn of St. Paul, Romans 13. yet I mean not to be a Papist;
they will not submit themselves to any other Prince or Magistrate, than those
that must first be sworn to maintain them and their doings. Bonner telling him,
Roger, I perceive thou will be ruled by no good counsel, etc. He answered, I
may say to you my Lord, as Paul said to Felix, and to the Jews, Acts 22. 1 Cor.
15. It is not unknown to my Master, whose Apprentice I was, that I was of this
your blind Religion, etc. having that liberty under your auricular Confession,
that I made no conscience of sin but trusted in the Priests absolution, etc. So
that Letchery, Swearing, and all other vices I accounted no offense of danger,
so long as I could for money have them absolved. Pa. 876.
-- And thus I continued till of late God has opened the Light of his Word,
and called me by his grace to repentance of my former idolatry and wicked life.
-- The antiquity of our Church is not from Pope Nicholas or Pope Jone, but our
Churchis from the beginning, even from the time that God said to Adam, that the
seed of the woman should break the Serpents head, etc. All that believed this
promise were of the Church, though the number were oftentimes but few and
small, as in Elias days, when he thought there was none but he that had not
bowed the knee to Baal, etc. Moreover of our Church have been the Apostles and
Evangelists, the Martyrs and Confessors that have in all Ages been persecuted
for the testimony of the Word of God. --

After Sentence was read against him, Pa. 877.
he said, Even now I told you that your Authority was of God, and by his
sufferance, and now I tell you, God has heard the prayer of his Servants,
which has been poured forth with tears for his afflicted Saints, which daily
you persecute. This I dare be bold in God to speak (which by his Spirit I am
moved to say) that God will shorten your hand of cruelty, that for a time you
shall not molest his Church. And this shall you in short time perceive, my dear
Brethren, to be most true; for after this day, in this place, shall there not
be any by him put to the trial of Fire and Faggot. Which accordingly came to
pass. He was the last burnt in Swithfield.

Then he began to exhort his Friends to repentance, Pa. 878.
and to think well of them that suffered for the testimony of the Gospel.

The day that Mr. Holland and the rest suffered, a Proclamation was made that
none should be so bold as to speak to them, or receive any thing of them upon
pain of imprisonment. Notwithstanding the people cried out, desiring God to
strengthen them; and they prayed for the people and the restoring of his Word.

At length Mr. Holland embracing the Stake and the Reeds, said, Lord I most
humbly thank thy Majesty, that thou have called me from the stake of death unto
the light of thy heavenly Word, and now unto the fellowship of thy Saints, that
I may sing and say, Holy, holy, holy Lord God of Hosts-Lord into thy hands I
commit my spirit. Lord, bless these thy people, and save them from idolatry.

Hooper.
Mr. John Hooper in his exile writ a Declaration of Christ and his Office, and
a Declaration of the holy Commandments of Almighty God, etc.

In his Epistle (before his Declaration of Christ and his Office) to the Duke
of Somerset. See his Declar. of Christ and his Office, Printed at Zurick, An.
1547.
-- Because the right of every just and lawful Heir is half lost and more, when
his Title and Claim is unknown, I have written this little Book, containing
what Christ is, and what his Officeis, that every godly man may put to his
helping hand to restore him again to his Kingdom, -- who has fastained open
and manifest wrong this many years, as it appears by his evidence and
writings, the Gospel sealed with his precious blood. --

In his Declaration -- chapter 3. -- Jesus Christ in all things executed the true
Office of a Bishop, to whom it appertained to teach the people, which was the
chiefest part of the Bishops Office, and most diligently and straightly commanded
by God. As all the Books of Moses and the Prophets teach, and Christ commanded
Peter, John 20. and Paul all the Bishops and Priests of his time, Acts 20. --
Christ left nothing untaught, but as a good Doctor manifested unto his Audience
all things necessary for the health of man, John 4. -- He gave also his
Apostles and Disciples after his resurrection commandment to preach, and
likewise what they should preach, Go into allthe world and preach the Gospel to
every creature, teaching them is observe what I have commanded, Matt. 28. -- As
they did most sincerely and plainly without all glosses or additions of their
own inventions, and were (...) testimon^es of the Truth, and not the Authors
thereof. -- Always in their Doctrine they ta^ght the thing that Christ first
taught and Gods holy Spirit inspired them, Gal. 1.2 Cor. 3. Holy Apostles never
took upon them to be Christ's V^car in the Earth, nor to be his Lieutenant; But
said, Let a man so account of us, as of the Ministers of Christ, and Stewards
of the Mysteries of God, 1 Cor. 4. 1. And in the same Epistle the Apostle P^^
bids the Corinthiuns to follow him in nothing, but where he followed Christ,
chap. 11. They ministered not in the Church, as though Christ was absent,
although his most glorious Body was departed into the Heavens above, but as
present, that always governs his Church with his Spirit of Truth, as he
promised, Matthew. ult. Behold I will (...) with you to the end of the world. In
the absence of his Body he has commended the protection and governance of his
Church to the Holy Ghost, one and the same God with the Father and himself. --
It was no little pain that Christ suffered in washing away the sins of this
Church: therefore be will not commit the defense thereof to man. It is no less
glory to defend and keep the thing won by force, than it is by force to obtain
the victory. -- Therefore he keeps the defense and governance of the Church
only and solely himself, in whom the Devil has not a jot of right. Though the
Apostles were instructed in all truth, etc. they were but Ministers, Servants,
Testimonies, and Preachers of this verity, and not Christ's Vicars on earth,
etc. but only appointed to approve ^he thing to be good, that God's Law
commanded, and that to be ill, which the Word of God condemned. Seeing that
Christ does govern his Church always by his holy Spirit, and binds all the
Mi^isters thereof unto the sole Word of God: what ^bomination is this that one
Bishop of Rome, etc. should claim to be Christ's Vicar on Earth, and ^ake upon
him to make any Laws in the Church of God to bind the Conscience beside the
Word of God, and by their Superstition and Idolatry put be Word of God out of
his place? -- All, that ^^e not blinded with the smoke of Rome, know the ^shop
of Rome to be the Beast John describes in ^e Apocalypse, as well as the
Logician knows that ^ibilitate distinguitur homo a caeteris animantibus.
^hrists supremacy and continual presence in the church admits no Lieutenant,
nor general Vicar: ^kewise it admits not the Decrees and Laws of ^en brought
into the Church, contrary unto the lord and Scripture of God, which is only
suf^ient to teach all verity and truth, for the salva^n of man. -- chapter 4. --
This Law teaches man sufficiently as well what he is bound to do unto God, as
unto the Princes of the world, Row. 13. 1 Pet. 2. Nothing necessary for man but
in this La^ it is prescribed. Of what decree, vocation, or calling soever he
be, his duty is showed unto hi m^ the Scripture. And in this it differs from
m^^ laws, because it is absolutely perfect, and never (...) be changed, nothing
to be added to it, nor taken from it. And the Church of Christ the more i^ was,
and is burdened with man's laws, the farther it is from the true and sincere
verity of God^ Word. -- Though Basil, Ambrose, Epiphanius, A^gustine, Bernard,
and others erred not in any principle Article of the Faith, yet they did
inordinately, and more then enough extol the Doctrine an^ Tradition of men, and
after the death of the Apostles, every Doctors time was subject to s^d
Ceremonies and manners, that were neither pro^fitable nor necessary. --

-- Unto the writing of Scripture only, and on^unto the writings of men, God
has bound an^ obligated his Church. In this passage. I admonis^ the Christian
Reader that I speak not of the Lu^of Magistrates and Princes, that daily order
ne^ Laws for the preservation of their Commonuealth^ as they see the necessity
of their Realms or Citi^ require; but of such Laws, as men have ordaine^ for
the Church of Christ, which should be now an^ for ever governed by the word of
God. -- T^^^ Law must-prevail. We must obey God rather th^^ man. The example
hereof we have in Dauiel (...) the Three Children, who chose rather to burn
(...) the fiery Furnace, than to worship the Image the Nebuchadnezzar had made.
So did the Apostle^ Acts. 5. -- Cursed be those that make such Law^ and cursed
be those that with sophistry dese^ them. -- chapter 5. -- The Authority of Gods
word requires me to pronounce this true Judgment in the case of Images that
be not worshipped in the Church, that their presence in the Church is against
Gods Word, as well as to say, Sancta Maria (...) pro nobis.

-- The old Testament says, Exodus 20. Deuteronomy. 6. Thou shall make no Image. The
New says, that Christ came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it, Matthew. 5.
Christ therefore has left the commandments of the old Law unto the Church, in
which he says, Thou shall not make any Image. -- Of late years Images were in
the Temple, and honored with pater moster, heart and mind, leg and knee: Now
they be applied to another use to teach the people, to be Laymens books, as
Damascene etc. says. O blasphemous and devilish Doctrine! -- The most perfect
Churches of the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles used no such mean: and we
ought to follow them and the Word of God, writ by the Prophets and Apostles. --
The words of Gregor. ad Seren. Episcop. Massil. part. 10. Ep. 4. should move no
man, though he say, Quod legentibus Scriptura, hoe ideotis pictura praftat
cernentibus. This is but Gregory's opinion. Epiphanius was not of his mind, He
willed the occasion of ill to be taken out of the Church, as Paul commands, 1
These. 5. This Doctor was (as all men know) of singular learning and virtue.
Again against the Authority of Gregory the Great I set the Authority of
Athanasius the Great, who denies in express words the Images to be the Books
of the Lay people. Lactantius Firmianus cries so out against Images, that he
says there can be no true Religion where they be. Tertullian judges the same.
-- Loved we God we would be content with the Scripture. -- Shall not the
Patriarks, Prophets, Christ and his Apostles suffice the Church of God; What
although many learned men have approved Images, should their wisdom maintain
any contrary to the Word of God? -- Such as defend them have nothing but
sophistical arguments to blind the people with. The Scripture nor Apostles
Church used none. Had all Asia, Africa, and Europe, and Gabriel the Archangel
descended from Heaven approved the use of Images, forasmuch as the Apostles
never taught nor wrote any such thing, their Authority should have no place;
the Word of God solely and only is to be preferred, which forbids Images. --
chapter 10. -- The Office of Christ to sanctify us (according to John 17. I
sanctify my self that they may be sanctified) does abrogate all other things
that man's constitutions attribute any holiness unto, as bewitched water, etc.
for only Christ sanctifies, and all holiness we must attribute unto him. --
Sactaments must be used holily, yet not have this Office of Christ added to
them. -- chapter 11. -- In the latter days when Christ, as King was to be born,
the Angel decl^red the Power and Puissance of his Kingdom. He shall reign over
the house of Jacob, and of his Kingdom there shall be no end, Luke 1. Although
the Commonwealth of the Church has no certain place appointed, where it shall
remain, as it was appointed in the old Law, yet certain we be that this
Kingdom of Christ remains upon the Earth, and shall do till the Earth be
burned, Matthew. 16.28. 1 Cor. 15. Howbeit as Christ wan and obtained this
Kingdom in the later days without shield or spear, so does he preserve it
with his holy Spirit, and not with carnal weapons. My Kingdom is not of this
world, John 18. Meaning he would not reign in this world, as a Prince of this
world in pomp and pride, but defend his people with his holy Spirit, that the
Devil and the World should not break their patience, though many afflictions
and sorrows should fight against them for the Truth's sake. Christ does not
deny to be King of the world, but he meant not to reign worldlily, to the
hinderance and defacing of the Emperouts Dignity and Title, as the Jews falsely
accused him, as Cyrillus l. 12. c. 10. in Johannem says. -- This Kingdom
shall be ever perse^nted till the worlds end. Isaiah the Prophet described the
Church of this present life, saying, He will give you the bread of adversity,
and the water of afflictione but he will not remove thy teachers, chap. 30.20.
Thus the Church shall always remain but in affliction. I know such as favor
not the Truth, will interpret my words, that I condemn all Princes and Kings,
as enemies of the Gospel, because they peaceably enjoy their Kingdoms, whereas
I wish them always so to do to the glory of God: but of this one thing I will
assure every Prince of the world; The more sincere he is in the Cause of God,
the more shall be his Cross. -- God indeed preserves above humane reason his
Ministers, as he did Jacob from the hands of Esau, David from Saul, Daniel from
the ^ons, and Paul in the Ship, when there was no humane hope of salvation. --
Likewise he governs his Church with his only Laws. -- The only Law whereunto
this Congregation is bound is it he Gosrel, as Christ says, Joh. 4. The Holy
Ghost shall teach you all things, and brng to your remembrance all things which
I have said unto you. Here Christ binds the Apostles and all the Church unto
the things that he had taught them. -- Such as teach the people to know the
Commonwealth of the true Church by these signs, the traditions of men, and the
succession of Bishops, teach wrong. Those two false opinions have given unto
the succession of Bishops power to interpret the Scripture, and power to make
such Laws in the Church, as it pleased them. -- God has given the Civil
Magistrates power and authority to make such Laws for the Commonwealth as shall
be agreeable with reason, and not against Gods Law, and likewise power to
interpret the same Laws: but this is not to be admitted in the Church, unto
whom God has given the Gospel, and interpreted the same by his only Son,
taught the meaning and contents thereof himself. -- The adversaries of the
Truth defend many an error under the name of the holy Church: when the Church
therefore is named, diligently consider when the Articles they would defend,
were accepted of the Church, by whom, and who was the Author of them. Leave not
till the matter be brought unto the first original and most perfect Church of
the Apostles. If thou find by their writings, that their Church used the thing
that the Preacher would prove, then accept it, or else not. Be not amazed,
though they speak of never so many years, nor name never so many Doctors. -- If
either the Authority of Bishops, of the greater part should have power to
interpret the Scripture, the sentence of the Pharisees should have been
preferred before the sentence of Zachary, Simeon, Elizabeth, or the blessed
Virgin. Consider the true Church is many time but a small Congregation, as
Isaiah says, Unless God had left us a remnant, we had been as Sodom. Therefore
the interpretation of the Scripture is not obligated to ordinary power, nor the
most part. -- Beware of deceit, when thou hear the name of the Church. The
verity is then assaulted. They call the Church of the Devil, the holy Church
many time. -- Remember Christian Reader, that the gift of interpreting the
Scripture is the Light of the Holy Ghost, given unto the humble and penitent
person, that seeks only to honor God, and not unto those persons that claim
it by title or place, because be is a Bishop, or followed by succession Peter
o^ Paul. -- Remember therefore to examine all Doctrine by the Word of God; for
such as preach it aright have their infirmities and ignorance, they may depart
from the Truth, or else build some superstition and false Doctrine upon the
Gospel of Christ. Superstition is to be avoided, false Doctrine to be abhorred,
whosoever be the Author thereof, Prince, Magistrate, or Bishop. As the Apostles
made answer, Acts 5. We ought to obey God rather than man. -- chapter 13. -- The
Law is necessary for a justified man to teach him with what works he should
exercise his faith, will, and obedience unto God. We may not choose works of our
own wisdom to serve him withal. He would have us to be governed by his Word,
as David says, Thy Word is a light unto my feet: And Christ, In vain do they
worship me by the commands of men. --

In the second Declaration. See his Declaration of the holy ten Com. of
Almighty God. Printed Anne 1548. page 8, 9.
-- Moses commands, Deuteronomy. 4. that no man should decline from this Law,
neither to the right, nor left hand, i.e. That no man should add to, or take
any thing from it, but simply to observe it, as it is given or written to us.
From this right line and true rule of Gods Word man erreth diverse ways:
Sometimes by ignorance, because he knows not, or will not know, that only the
express Word of God suffices. He holds with the most part, and condemns
the better, as it is to be seen at this present day. This reason takes place,
it is allowed of the most part, and established by so many holy and learned
Bishops, therefore it is true, etc. Another way that leads from the Word of
God, is many times the power and authority of this world, as we see by the
Bishop of Rome, and all his adherents, who give more credit to one Charter and
gift of Constantine, than to the whole Bible. Another erreth by mistaking of
the time, making his superstition far elder than it is, etc. One says thus, My
Father believed, and should I believe the contrary? Page 11.
-- Whereas no Law at all should be spoken of conscience, but the only Word of
God, which never altered, nor can be altered, Mat. 5. Luke 10. Psalm. 18.119. If
Heavens and Earth made by word cannot be altered, how much more the Word it
self! Unto which Law, the conscience of man in matters of faith is bound only.
Page 13.
-- Such as can interpret nothing, will say, I have an ill opinion of God in
Heaven, and of the superior Powers on Earth, because I damn the Disciples of
the false Doctors with the Doctors, and take from all Powers on Earth authority
to prescribe unto their Subjects any Law touching Religion of the soul. As
concerning those that be seduced by false Teachers, St. Luke c. 6. Ezekiel 3.
and 13. judge as I do -- Both he that leads to damnation, and he that is led,
Page 14.
falls into the pit. -- Notwithstanding I believe, that in the midst of
darkness, when all the world (as far as man might judge) had sworn unto the
Bishop of Rome, Christ had his Elect, that never consented to his false Laws,
as it was in the time of Elias, 1 Kings 19. where God says, He had preserved
seven thousand that had not bowed the knee to Baal. Page 15.
-- As many as die before us, seduced by false Teachers without repentance, the
Scripture condemns: As many as believed them not, but trusted to the
Scripture (or else deceived, yet repented before they died) live eternally in
joy and solace and are saved, as John says Rev. 13. in the blood of the Lamb.
-- As touching the superior Powers of the Earth, it is not unknown to all men
that have read and marked the Scripture, that it pertains nothing to their
Office to make any Law to govern the consciences of their Subjects in Religion,
but to reign over them in this case, as the Word of God commands. Page 16.
Howbeit in their Realms they make what Laws they will, and as many as they
will; command them to be kept as long it pleases them, and change them at
their pleasure as they shall see occasion for the wealth and commodity of their
Realms: -- Unto the which superior Powers we owe all obedience, both of body
and goods, and likewise our daily prayer for them to Almighty God, etc. And as
many diverse Commonwealths as there be, so many diverse Laws there may be.
Howbeit all Christian Kings and Kingdoms with other Magistrates, should reign
by one Law, and govern the Churches of their Realms solely by the Word of God,
Page 17.
which is never to be changed. -- Thus Christ commanded his Apostles to teach,
and their Audience to hear the things he commanded, Matthew. 28. Mark 16. Page 26.
-- Moses prescribes unto his Audience seven Rules, wherewith he prepares
them to the receiving of the ten Commandments. (1) A right persuasion of Gods
word, that God will undoubtedly give the good promised to the good, and inflict
the evil threatened against the evil. Page 29.
-- (2) To have a right opinion of the Magistrates and superior Powers of the
Earth, to give them no more, nor any less honor and reverence than the Word of
God commands. -- For lack of this preparative the world has erred from the
Truth this many years. Men do not look what Gods Word says, but extol the
authority of man's Laws, preferring the decree of a general or provincial
Council before the Word of God. Page 30.
-- (3) Another preparative is obedience both to God and man. It were as good
nere read the Law, in case we mind not to be obedient. Page 31. Page 32. Page
34.
-- (4) To observe jus gentium. -- (5) To esteem the Doctrine of the
Commandments, as it is worthy. -- (6) A true and right understanding of the
Law, not to constrain the letter against the mind of the Text, but behold
always the consent of the Scripture. Page 36.
-- (7) To add nothing to this Law, neither to take any thing from it. -- If
thou judge that Gods Law contains one part of such Doctrine, as is
necessary for man's salvation, and the Bishops Laws another part, thou
contemnest and dishonourest the whole Law, and the Giver thereof, and offendest
against that command, Deuteronomy. 4.12. and Prove. Page 64.
30. -- Every thing that we do for the honor of God not commanded by his Word,
is as strange, and not accepted by God; as all good intentions, feigned works
by man, and all things commanded by general Councils, not expressed in the Word
of God, by the Patriarks, Prophets, Christ, and the Apostles, which be and ever
were before God the Holy and Catholic Church. Whosoever add any thing to their
Laws are the Church of Antichrist, Deuteronomy. 4.12. Revel. 22. Nadab and Abihu
offered strange fire, i.e. such as he commanded not. Page 68.
-- Read the Commentaries of Tho. Valois and Nicol. in Aug. de Civit. Dei, l.
4. and they will tell thee what superstition is, if thou believe not the
Scripture. Superstition (say they) is a superfluous Religion, what ways soever
it be superfluous, whether it be of the superfluity of the things honored, or
of the things used for Religion, or of the manner in Religion. This doubtless
is understood by the name of Superstition, from whence soever the name has its
rise; whatsoever thou do to please God Almighty, if it be not commanded in
his Word, it is superfluous superstition. Page 70.
-- The purpose end and will of the second Commandment is, That Gods pleasure
is unto us, that we do not profane or dishonor the true Religion or honor of
God with superstitious Rites or Ceremonies not commanded by him. -- I am a
jealous God. q. d. Page 77.
when we two were married together for the love that I bore unto thee, I gave
thee certain Rules and Precepts how in all things thou may keep my love and
good will toward thee, and thou promisedst me obedience to my Commandments,
Exodus 19. So honor me therefore, and love me as is stands written in the
Writings and Indentures written between us both, I cannot suffer to be
otherwise honored, than I have taught in my Tables and Testament. --

Against obeying of Gods Laws, Pa. 209.
the first Sophism or carnal Objection is, when men say it is no place nor time
to learn or obey Gods Laws, we be not in the Temple, etc. but in the broad
world, and must do as other men do, and rather serve the place we be in, and
ululare cum lapis, bark with the wolf, Deuteronomy. 29.30.
than speak of the Scripture: besides, it is too dangerous a season, let it
pass till the world be more quiet, etc. -- This Objection Moses breaks, and
proves that the Law should be always received, and in every place. -- Those
that observed it in the wilderness, God fed by miracle from Heaven, and
preserved all their apparel that it consumed not, Pa. 210.
nor perished in the wearing for the space of forty years. -- A second
Objection is, when men put from themselves the obedience of the Law unto
others, saying, Let the Priests, etc. learn and keep the Law, what should a
Prince, Magistrate, or Gentleman be so bound? Youth cannot be tie^ to so strait
Canons, it must not be so bridled, etc. This wicked acceptance of persons
Moses destroys, yea all (says he) stand this day before the Lord your God,
Pa. 211.
your Princes, your Tribes, your Elders, your Officers, and all men of Israel,
your children, your wives, and thy Guest, etc. No manner of prison is excluded
from the League. Pa. 212.
-- A third is presumption, when men know what is to be done, yet against their
knowledge presuming of Gods mercy, Pa. 213.
do the thing that is evil, saying, If I walk in the imagination of my heart,
and take my pleasure, there is no danger, etc. But (says Moses) the Lord will
not favor such an one, but then be angry, and kindle his ire against him, so
that every curse written in this Book, shall rest on him, etc. A fourth is
Animosity, Pa. 218.
thus reasoning with ones self, who knows what his last hour shall be? -- But
(says Moses) Secret things belong to God, but the things that God has
revealed to us and our children for ever, Pa. 222.
that we do all the precepts of this Law. -- A fifth, is Desperation, when men
think it is in vain for them to observe Gods Laws, there is no hope of their
salvation etc. It is impossible for him to return to God, and do all that God
requires, etc. Moses gives a remedy against this dangerous disease, Pa. 224.
shows the way to God, declares, That God is fall of mercy and ready to
forgive, Pa. 229.
etc. -- A sixth is the pretense of Ignorance, saying, The Scriture, the Laws
of God have so many mysteries, roo hard for our capacities, etc. Besides the
Doctors brawl and chide between themselves, and how should the unlearned
understand it aright? Who can tell (says another) whether this be the true Law
or not? If it were the true Law of God, then it should contain all verities,
and h^ve no deed of man's Laws. Now the greatest part of Christians in name say,
that this Law is not sufficient, except it be holp and aided by the Law of the
Bishops. -- Moses answers and says, Pa. 230.
This Law is sufficient, simple and plain, easy to be understood, a perfect
Doctrine, and required of all men; the Commandment that I prescribe to thee
unto day is not far above thee, nor put far from thee, etc. By which words it
appears, that God has made his will and pleasure simple and plainly open to
his people, etc. Yea the Law of God to do well by is written naturally in the
heart of every man, etc. Pa. 231.
though there were no law written, etc. man's conscience would tell him when he
does well and when ill. Pa. 234.
-- Farewell in our only and sole joy and consolation, Christ Jesus.

This holy Exile parting with Mr. Fox, Vol. 3 page 145.
Bullinger and his friends at Zurick, declared that the principal cause of his
return to his own Country was the matter of Religion, etc. Be sure (said he)
neither the nature of the Country, nor pleasure of commodities, nor newness of
friends shall ever induce me to the oblivion of such friends and Benefactors,
and therefore you shall be sure from time to time to hear from me how it goes
with me, but the last news of all I shall not be able to write; for there said
he (taking Mr. Bullinger by the hand) where I shall take most pains, there
shall you hear of me to be burned to ashes, and that shall be the last news,
which I shall not be able to write. --

When he was made Bishop of Worcester and Gloucester, Pa. 146.
the Arms allotted him (probably by his own appointment) were a Lamb in a fiery
Bush, and the Sunbeams from Heaven descending down upon the Lamb, rightly
denoting as it seemed, the manner of his suffering, which afterward followed.

After his return, in his Sermons he corrected sin, and sharply inveighed
against the iniquity of the world, and corrupt abuses of the Church. --

When he was elected Bishop of Worcester and Gloucester, he made humble
supplication to the King either to discharge him of the Bishopric, or to
dispense with him as to the wearing of such Garments and Apparel as the Popish
Bishops were wont to do. His Petition the King granted, as appears by his
Letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury, telling him, That the Rites and
Ceremonies he would be dispensed in were offensive to his conscience. Pa. 147.
The Oath also, used them commonly in the consecration of Bishops was against
his conscience, as appears by the Earl of Warwick's Letter to the Archbishop,
writ by the Kings desire.

In the beginning of Q. Pa. 149.
Mary's Reign, when notice was given him that he should be sent for to London,
and how dangerous it was for him to appear, he gave this Answer: Once I did
flee, but now because I am called to this place and Vocation, I am thoroughly
persuaded to tarry, and to live and die with my sheep.

When he was imprisoned in the Fleet, Pa. 150.
he writes thus: I am so hardly used, that I see no remedy (saving Gods help)
but I shall be cast away in Prison before I come to judgment. But I commit my
just cause to God, whose will be done, whether it be by life or death.

Winchester exhorting him to the unity of the Catholic Church, and to
acknowledge the Popes Holiness to be Head of the same Church, promising him the
Queens mercy; he answered, That forasmuch as the Pope taught Doctrine
altogether contrary to the Doctrine of Christ, he was not worthy to be
accounted a Member of Christ's Church, much less to be Head thereof; wherefore
he would in no wise condescend to any such usurped Jurisdiction, neither
esteemed he the Church, whereof they called him Head, to be the Catholic
Church of Christ, Pa. 151.
for the Church of Christ only hears the voice of her Spouse Christ, and
flies the strangers. Howbeit (said he) if in any point to me unknown, I have
offended the Queens Majesty, I shall humbly submit my self to her mercy, if
mercy may be had with safety of conscience, and without the displeasure of God.

Come Brother (said he to Mr. Rogers, who was sent with him to the Counter in
Southwark) must we two take this matter first in hand, and begin to fire these
Fagots? Yea Sir (said Mr. Rogers) by Gods grace. Doubt not (said Mr. Hooper)
but God will give strength.

The Sheriff telling Mr. Hooper he wondered that he was so hasty and quick with
the L. Chancellor, he answered, Mr. Sheriff, I was nothing at all impatient,
although I was earnest in my Masters cause; and it stands me so in hand; for
it goes upon life and death, not the life and death of this world only, but
also of the world to come.

In his Letter for the stopping of certain false rumors spread abroad
concerning his Recantation, by the Bishops and their servants. --

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all them that unfeignedly look for
the coming of our Savior Christ. Amen. Dear Brethren and Sisters in the Lord,
and my Fellow Prisoners for the Cause of Gods Gospel, I do much rejoice and
give thanks unto God for your constancy and perseverance in affliction, unto
whom I wish continuance to the end. And as I do rejoice in your faith and
constancy in afflictions that be in prison, even so I do mourn and lament to
hear of our dear Brethren, that yet have not felt such dangers for Gods Truth,
Pa. 152.
as we have and do feel, and be daily like to suffer more, yea the very extreme
and vile death of the fire; yet such is the report abroad (as I am credibly
informed) that I John Hooper, a condemned man for the cause of Christ, should
now after sentence of death (being in Newgate Prisoner, and looking daily for
Execution) recant and abjure that which heretofore I have preached; and this
talk arises of this, That the Bishop of London, and his Chaplains resort unto
me. Doubtless if our Brethren were as Godly as I could wish them, they would
think that in case I did refuse to talk with them they might have just occasion
to say that I were unlearned, and durst not speak with learned men; or else
proud, and disdained to speak with them. -- But I fear not their arguments,
neither is death terrible to me. -- I am more confirmed in the truth, which I
have preached heretofore, by their coming. Therefore ye that may send to the
weak Brethren, pray them that they trouble me not with such reports of
Recantations as they do, for I have hitherto left all things of the world, and
suffere^ great pains and imprisonment, and I thank God I am as ready to suffer
death as a mortal man may be. It were better for them to pray for us, then to
credit or report such rumors that be untrue. We have enemies enough of such as
know not God truly: but yet the false report of weak Brethren is a double
cross. I wish your eternal salvation in Je^^s Christ, and also require your
continual Pray^rs, that he which has begun in us may continue ^t to the end. I
have taught the truth with my ^ongue, and with my pen heretofore, and hereafter
^hortly will confirm the same by Gods grace with ^y blood.

Your Brother in Christ, J. H.
Newgate, Feb. 2. 1554.

When the Keeper told him he should be sent to Gloucester to be burned, Pa. 153.
he rejoiced very much ^ifting up his eyes and hands to Heaven, he praised God
that he saw it good to send him among the people over whom he was Pastor, there
to confirm with his death the truth which he had before taught them, not
doubting but the Lord would give him strength to perform the same to his glory.

Sir Anthony Kingston (formerly his Friend, then a Commissionre to see
Execution done upon him, coming to him a little before his death, bid him
consider that life was sweet, and death was bitter, etc. It is true (said Mr.
Hooper) I am come hither to end this life, and to suffer death here, because I
will not gainsay the former truth which I have heretofore taught among you. --
True it is, that death is bitter and life is sweet; but alas! consider that the
death to come is more bitter, and the life to come is more sweet; therefore for
the desire and love I have to the one, and the terror and fear of the other, I
do not so much regard this death, nor esteem this life, but have settled my self
through the strength of Gods holy Spirit, patiently to pass through the
torments and extremities of the fire now prepared for me, rather than to deny
the truth of his Word, desiring you and others in the mean time to commend me
to Gods mercy in your Prayers.

I thank God (said the Knight) that ever I knew you; for God did appoint you to
call me, being a lost child, and by your good instructions, where before I was
both an Adulterer and Fornicator, God has brought me to the forsaking and
de^esting of the same. If you had the grace so to do (said the Bishop) I do
highly praise God for it, and if you have not, I pray God you may have, and
that you may continually live in his fear.

The Knight and the Bishop parting with tears, the Bishop told the Knight, that
all the troubles be had sustained in Prison, had not caused him to uttes so
much sorrow.

A Papist telling him he was sorry to see him in that case. Be sorry for thy
man (said he) and Iament thine own wickedness; for I am well, I thank God, and
death to me for Christ's sake is welcome.

When he was committed to the Sheriff of Gloucester, Pa. 154.
the Mayor and Aldermen at first saluted him, and took him by the hand. Mr.
Mayor (said Mr. Hooper) I give most hearty thanks to you and to the rest of
your Brethren, that you have vouchsafed to take me a Prisoner and condemned man
by the hand, whereby to my rejoicing it is somewhat apparent that your old love
and friendship toward me is not altogether extinguished, and I trust also that
all the things I have taught you in times past are not utterly forgotten, etc.
For the which most true and sincere Doctrine, because I will not now account it
falsehood and Heresy, as many other men do, I am sent hither by the Queens
command to die, and am come where I taught it to confirm it with my blood. And
now Mr. Sheriffs, -- My request to you is, that there may be a quick Fire,
shortly to make an end, and in the mean time I will be as obedient unto you, as
your selves would wish. If you think I do amiss in any thing, hold up your
finger and I have done: for I am not come hither as one enforced or compel to
die; for it is well known I might have had my life with worldly gain; but as
one willing to offer and give my life for the truth, rather than to consent to
the wicked Papistical Religion of the Bishop of Rome, etc. --

When the Sheriffs fetched him from his Chamber to the place of Execution with
Bills, Weapons, etc Mr. Sheriffs (said he) I am no Traitor, neither needed you
to have made such a business to bring me to the place where I must suffer; for
if ye had willed me, I would have gone alone to the Stake, and have troubled
none of you at all.

When he saw the multitude of people that were assembled, he said unto them
that were about him, Alas! why be these people assembled and come together?
peradventure they think to hear something of me now, as they have in times
past; but alas! speech is prohibited me.

Notwithstanding the cause of my death is well known unto them: when I was
appointed here to be their Pastor, I preached unto them true and sincere
Doctrine, and that out of the Word of God; because I will not account the same
to be Heresy and untruth this kind of death is prepared for me.

When he was come to the place where he was to suffer, after he had begun to
pray, a Box was brought and laid before him upon a stool, with his Pardon (or
leastwise it was feigned so to be) from the Queen, if he would turn; at the
sight thereof he cried, If you love my soul away with it, if you love my soul
away with it.

In his Prayer he was overheard to say; Lord, I am Heil, but thou art Heaven; I
am swill, and a sink of sin, but thou art a gracious God and merciful.
Redeemer. Pa. 155.
-- Thou art ascended into Heaven, receive me Hell to be partaker of thy joys,
where thou sit in equal glory with thy Father; for well know thou
wherefore I am come hither to suffer and why the wicked do persecute this thy
poor servant, not for my sins and transgressions against thee, but because I
will not allow their wicked doings to the contaminating of thy blood, and to
the denial of the knowledge of thy Truth, wherewith it did please thee by thy
holy Spirit to instruct me, the which with as much diligence as a poor wretch
might (being thereto called) I have set forth to thy glory. And well see
thou, my Lord and God, what terrible pains and cruel torments be prepared for
thy Creature; such, Lord, as without thy strength none is able to bear, or
patiently to pass. But all things that are impossible with man are possible
with thee. Therefore strengthen me of thy goodness, that in the fire I break
not the rules of patience, or else assuage the terror of the pains as shall
seem most to thy glory.

When he was at the Stake, three irons made to bind him to the Stake, were
brought; one for his Neck, another for his Middle, and the third for his Legs.
He refusing them, said, Ye have no need thus to trouble your selves, for I
doubt not but God will give strength sufficient to abide the extremity of the
fire without bands: notwithstanding, suspecting the frailty and weakness of the
flesh, but having assured confidence in Gods strength, I am content ye do as ye
shall think good.

When he was first scorched with the fire, Pa. 156.
he prayed, saying mildly, and not very loud (but as one without pains) O Jesus
the son of David have mercy upon me, and receive my soul.

When the second fire was spent, and only burnt his lower parts, he said, for
Gods love (good people) let me have more fire. In the third fire he prayed with
somewhat a loud voice, Lord Jesus have mercy on me, Lord Jesus have mercy on
me, Lord Jesus receive my Spirit.

The Reasons of Mr. Hooper 's refusing the Episcopal Habits, etc. I find thus.
C. Why do not you my Lord use these innocent and harmless weeds? See Cabal p.
13, 14.



H. I put my self upon the trial of the searcher of Hearts, that no obstinacy,
but mere Conscience makes me refuse these ornaments.


C. These Ornaments are indifferent of themselves, and of ancient use in the
Church.


H. They are useless being ridiculous and superstitious.


C. Nay, my Lord, being enjoined by lawful Authority, they become necessary,
not to salvation, but to Church-unity.


H. Being left indifferent by God, it is presumption in man to make them
necessary.


C. By a moderate use of these Ceremonies we may gain Papists into the Church.


H. While you hope to gain Papists into the Church, you lose many Protestants
out of it.


C. You discredit other Bishops, who have used this Habit.


H. I had rather discredit them than destroy mine own conscience.


C. How think you, being a private person, to be indulged with to the
disturbance of the public Uniformity of the Church?

C. These are to desire, that in such reasonable things, wherein my Lord Elect
of Gloucester craveth to be born withal at your hands, you would vouchsafe your

WE do understand you stay from Consecrating our well-beloved Mr. J. Hooper,
because be would have you omit and let pass certain Rites and Ceremonies
offensive to his Conscience, whereby you think you shall fall in praemunire of
Laws; We have thought good by advice of Our Council to discharge you of all
manner of Dangers, Penalties, and Forfeitures you should run into, by omitting
any of the same, and these Our Letters shall be your sufficient Warrant and
Discharge.

In his Letter writ in Answer to one sent him concerning certain taken in Bow
Churchyard, Fox, Vol. 3 Page 116.
whilst they were praying. -- I do rejoice in that men can be so well occupied
in this perilous time, and flee for remedy to God by Prayer, as well for their
own lacks and necessities, as also charitably to pray for them that persecute
them. So does the Word of God command all men to pray charitably for them that
hate them, and not to revile any Magistrate with words, or to mean him evil by
force and violence. They also may rejoice that in well doing they were taken to
prison. -- Thus fare you well and pray God to send his true Word into this
Realm again amongst us, which the ungodly Bishops have now banished.

In his Letter to those Christians so taken Prisoners. --

The grace, favor, consolation, Pa. 1^^
and aid of the Holy Ghost be with you now and ever. So be it. Dearly beloved
in the Lord, ever since I heard of your imprisonment I have been marvellously
moved with great affections and passions, as well of mirth and gladness, as of
heaviness and sorrow. Of gladness in this, that I perceived how ye be bent and
given to prayer and invocation of Gods help in these dark and wicked
proceedings of men against Gods glory. I have been sorry to perceive the malice
and wickedness of men to be so cruel, devilish, and tyranical to persecute the
people of God for serving of God, etc. These cruel doings do declare, that the
Papists Church is more bloody and tyrannical, than ever was the sword of the
Ethnicks and Gentiles. -- Trajan the Emperor commanded, That no man should be
persecuted for serving of God: but the Pope and his Church have cast you into
Prison, being taken doing the Work of God, and one of the excellentest Works,
that is required of Christians, viz. whilst ye were in Prayer. -- O glad may
ye be that ever ye were born to be apprehended, whilst ye were so virtuously
occupied. Blessed be they that suffer for righteousness sake. If God had
suffered them that took your bodies, then to have taken your life also, now had
you been following the Lamo in perpetual joys, away from the company and
assembly of the wicked men. But the Lord would not have you suddenly so to
depart, but reserveth you gloriously to speak and maintain his Truth to the
world. Be ye not careful what ye shall say; for God will go out and in with
you, and will be present in your hearts and in your mouths to speak his
wisdom, though it seems foolishness to the world. He that has begun this
good work in you, continue in the same unto the end. Pray unto him, Mat. 10.
that ye may fear him only, that has power to kill both body and soul, and to
cast them into hell fire. Luke 12.
Be of good comfort, all the hairs of your head are numbered, and there is not
one of them can perish, except your heavenly Father suffer it to perish. Now
you be in the field, and placed in the forefront of Christ's battle. Doubtless
it is a singular favor of God. and a special love of him toward you, to give
him his pre-eminence, as a sign that he trusts you before others of his
people. Wherefore dear Brethren and Sisters) continually fight this Fight of
the Lord. Your Cause is most just and godly, ye stand for the true Christ (who
is after the flesh in Heaven) and for his true Religion and Honor, which is
amply, fully, sufficiently, and abundantly contained in the holy Testament,
sealed with Christ's own blood. How much be ye bound to God, who puts you in
trust with so holy and just a cause? Remember what lookers on you have to lee
and behold you in your fight, God and all his holy Angels; who be ready always
to take you up into Heaven, if ye be flain in his fight. Also you have standing
at your backs all the multitude of the Faithful, who shall take courage,
strength, and desire to follow such noble and valiant Christians, as you be. Be
not afraid of your Adversaries; 1 John 4.
for he that is in you, is stronger than he that is in them. Shrink not
although it be pain to you: your pains be not now so great, as hereafter your
joys shall be. Read the Comfortable Chapters to the Romans, 8.10, 15. Hebrews
11.12. And upon your knees thank God that ever ye were accounted worthy to
suffer any thing for his Names sake. Read the second Chapter of Luke, and there
you shall see how the Shepherds that watched their Sheep all night, as soon as
they heard that Christ was born at Bethelem, by and by went to see him. They
did not reason not debate with themselves who should keep the Wolf from the
Sheep in the mean time, but did as they were commanded, and committed their
Sheep unto him, whose pleasure they obeyed. So let us do now we be called,
commit all other things to him that calls us. He will take heed that all
things shall be well. He will help the Husband, he will comfort the Wife: he
will guide the Servants: he will keep the House: he will preserve the Goods;
yea rather then it should be undone, he will wash the Dishes and rock the
Cradle. Cast therefore all your care upon God; for he cares for you. Besides
this, you may perceive by your imprisonment, that your Adversaries weapons
against you be nothing but flesh, and blood, and tyranny, for if they were
able, they would maintain their Religion by Gods Word; but for lack of that,
they would violently compel, such as they cannot by holy Scripture persuade;
because the holy Word of God, and all Christ's doings be contrary unto them.
Ipray you pray for me, and I will pray for you.

Fleet, Jan. 24. 1555.

In a Letter to certain of his Friends. Pa. 156.
--

Now is the time of trial, to see whether we fear more, God or man. It was an
easy thing to hold with Christ, whilst the Prince and world held with him; but
now the world hates him, it is the true trial who be his. Wherefore in the
Name, and in the Virtue, Strength, and Power of his holy Spirit, prepare your
selves in any case to adversity and constancy. Let us not run away when it is
most time to fight. Remember none shall be crowned, but such as fight manfully;
and he that endures to the end shall be saved. Ye must now turn all your
cogitations from the peril you see, and mark the felicity that follows the
peril, either victory in this world of your enemies, or else a surrender of
this life to inherit the everlasting Kingdom. Beware of beholding too much the
felicity, or misery of this world; for the consideration and too earnest or
love fear of either of them draws from God. Wherefore think with your selves,
as touching the felicity of the world, it is good; but yet none otherwise than
it stands with the favor of God. It is to be kept; but yet so far forth, as
by keeping of it we lose not God. It is good abiding and tarrying still among
our friends here; but yet so, that we tarry no^ therewithal in Gods
displeasare, and hereafter dwell with the Devils in fire everlasting. There is
nothing under God, but may be kept, so that God, being above all things we
have, be not lost. Of adversity judge the same. Imprisonment is painful, but
yet liberty upon evil conditions is more painful. The Prisons stink; but yet
not so much as sweet Houses, where the fear and true honor of God is lacking.
I must be alone and solitary: It is better to be so, and have God with me, then
to be in company with the wicked. Loss of Goods is great; but loss of Gods
grace and favor is greater. I am a poor simple creature, and cannot tell how
to answer before such a great sort of noble, learned, and wise men: It is
better to make answer before the pomp and pride of wicked men, than to stand
naked in the fight of all Heaven and Earth before the just God at the later
day. I shall die then by the hands of the cruel man: He is blessed, that loses
his life full of miseries, and finds the life of eternal joys. It is pain
and grief to depart from Goods and Friends; but yet not so much as to depart
from grace and heaven it self. Pa. 157.
Wherefore there is neither felicity, nor adversity of this world, that can
appear to be great, if it be weighed with the joys or pains in the world to
come. I can do no more, but pray for you; do the same for me, for Gods sake.
For my part (I thank the heavenly Father) I have made mine accounts, and
appointed my self unto the will of the heavenly Father: as he will, so I will
by his grace. -- I am a precious jewel now, and daintily kept, never so
daintily; for neither mine own man, nor any of the Servants of the House may
come to me, but my Keeper alone.

Jan. 23. 1555.

In another Letter. --

Pa. 158.
The grace, mercy, and Peace of God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ,
be with you my dear Brethren, and with all those that unfeignedly love and
embrace his holy Gospel. Amen. We must give God thanks for the Truth he has
opened, etc. and pray unto him, that we deny it not, nor dishonor it with
idolatry; but that we may have strength and patience, rather to die ten times
over, than to deny him once. Blessed shall we be, if ever God make us worthy of
that honor to shed our blood for his Names sake: and blessed then shall we
think those Parents, which brought us into this world, that we should be
carried from this mortality into immortality. Col. 3.
If we follow the command of Paul, that says, If ye be risen with Christ, seek
these things which are above, where Christ sits at the right hand of God; we
shall neither depart from the vain transitory goods of this world, nor from
this wretched and mortal life, with so great pains, as others do. -- There is
no better way to be used in this troublesome time for your consolation, than
many times to have Assemblies together of such men and women, as be of your
Religion in Christ, and there to take and renew among your selves the truth of
your Religion, to see what ye be by the Word of God, and to remember what ye
were before ye came to the knowledge thereof; to weigh and confer the dreams
and false! yes of the Preachers, that now preach, with the Word of God, that
retains all truth: and by such talk, and familiar resorting together, ye
shall the better find out all their lies, that now go about to deceive you, and
also both know and love the Truth that God has opened to us. It is much
requisite that the Members of Christ comfort one another, make prayers
together, confer one with another; so shall ye be stronger, and Gods spirit
shall not be absent from you, but in the midst of you, to teach you, to comfort
you, to make you wise in all godly things, patient in adversity, and strong in
persecution. Ye see how the Congregation of the wicked, by helping one another,
make their wicked Religion and themselves strong against Gods Truth and his
people. -- Ye may perceive by the life of our forefathers, that Christ's words,
In the world ye shall have trouble: He that will live godly in Christ must
suffer persecution. be true; for none of all his before our time escaped
trouble: then shall ye perceive that it is but a folly for one that professes
Christ truly, to look for the love of the world. Ye be no better than your
forefathers. Be glad that ye may be counted worthy Soldiers for this War: and
pray to God when ye come together, that he will use and order you and your
doings. (1) That ye glorify God. (2) That ye edify the Church and
Congregation. (3) That ye profit your own souls. In all our doings beware ye be
not deceived; for although this time be not yet so bloody and tyrannous, as the
time of our forefathers, that could not bear the Name of Christ, without
danger of life and goods; yet is our time more perilous for soul and body.
Therefore of us Christ said, Luke 18.
Think ye when the Son of man comes, he shall find faith upon the earth. He
speaks not of being christened and in name a Christian, but of saving Faith:
and doubtless the scarcity of Faith is now more (and will, I fear increase)
than it was in the time of the greatest Tyrants that ever were. In Rev. 6. ye
may perceive that at the opening of the fourth Seal came our a pale Horse, and
he that sat upon him was called Death, and Hell followed him. This Horse is
the time, when Hypocrites and Dissemblers entered into the Church. under
pretense of the true Religian, etc. that have killed more souls with heresy
and superstition, than all the Tyrants that ever killed bodies by fire, sword,
or banishment, etc. and all souls, that trust to these Hypocrites, live to the
Devil in everlasting pain, as is declared by Hells following the pale Horse.
These pale Hypocrites stave stirred up Earthquakes, i. e. he Princes of the
world against Christ's Church. They have darkened the Sun, and made the Moon
bloody, and have caused the Stars to fall from Heaven, i.e. they have darkened
with mists, and daily darken the Sun of Gods word, Pa. 159.
imprisoned, and chaised, and butchered Gods true Preachers, which ^nch only
light at the Sun of Gods Word, that their light cannot shine unto the world as
they would: Whereupon it comes to pass, that many Christians fall from Gods
true Word to hypocrisy, most devilish superstition and idolatry. --

In his Letter to Bishop Farrar, Dr. Tailor, Mr. Bradford, and Mr. Philpot,
Prisoners in the Kings Bench in Southwark. -- I am advertised, that we shall be
carried shortly to Cambridge, there to dispute for the faith, and for the
Religion of Christ (which is most true) that we have and do profess. I am (as I
doubt not ye be) in Christ ready) not only to go to Cambridge, but also to
suffer, by Gods help, death it self in the maintenance thereof. -- I write this
to comfort you in the Lord, that the time draws near, and is at hand, that we
shall testify before Gods enemies Gods Truth. --

Yours, and with you unto death in Christ, J. H.
May, 6. 1554.

In his Letter to his Wife. Pa. 160.
--

As the Devil has entered into their hearts, that they themselves cannot, or
will not come to Christ to be instructed by his holy Word; so can they not
abide any others to become Christians, and lead their lives after the Word of
God, bu^ hate, persecute, rob, imprison, and kill them, whether male or female;
though they have never offended Gods or Man's Law, yea though they daily pray
for them, and wish them Gods grace; having no respect to Nature. The Brother
persecuteth the Brother, the Father the Son, and most dear Friends are become
most mortal Enemies. And no marvel; for they have chosen sundry Masters, the
one the Devil, the other God. The one agree with the other, as God and the
Devil agree between themselves. Genesis 21. Gal. 4.
-- As he that was born after the flesh persecuted in times past him that was
born after the Spirit, even so it is now. Therefore forasmuch as we live in
this life amongst so many great perils and dangers, the only remedy is what
Christ has appointed, Luke 21.
Ye shall possess yourselves in patience. -- When troubles come we must be
patient, and in no case violently, nor seditiously to resist our persecutors;
because God has such care of us, that he will keep in the midst of all
troubles the very hairs of our heads, etc. And seeing he has such care of the
hairs of our head, how much more does he care for our life it self? Their
cruelty has no farther power than God permits, and that which comes unto
us by the will of our heavenly Father, can be no harm, loss, destruction to us,
but rather gain, wealth and felicity. That the spirit of man may feel these
consolations, the giver of them, the heavenly Father, must be prayed unto for
the merits of Christ's Passion; for it is not the nature of man that can be
contented, until it be regenerated and possessed with Gods Spirit, to bear
patiently the troubles of mind or body. When the mind of man sees troubles on
every side, threatening poverty, yea death, except the man weigh these brittle
and uncertain treasures, that be taken from him, with the riches of the life to
come, and this life of the body with the life in Christ's blood, and so for the
love and certainty of the heavenly joys contemn all things present, doubtless
he shall never be able to bear the loss of goods and life. -- The Christian
man's faith must be always upon the resurrection of Christ, when he is in
trouble, and in that glorious Resurrection he shall see continual joy, yea
victory and triumph over all persecution, trouble, sin, death, hell, the Devil,
and all other persecutors; the tears and weepings of the faithful dried up,
their wounds healed, their bodies made immortal in joy, their souls for ever
praising the Lord, in conjunction and society everlasting with the blessed
company of Gods Elect in perpetual joy. Col. 3.
If ye be risen with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ
sits at the right hand of God the Father. When he bids us seek the things
that are above, he requires that our minds never cease from prayer and study
in Gods Word, until we see, know, and understand the vanities of this world,
the shortness end misery of this life, and the treasures of the world to come,
the immortality thereof, the joys of that life, and so never cease seeking,
until such time as we know certainly and be persuaded what a blessed man he is,
that seeks the one and finds it, and cares not for the other though he
lose it; and in seeking, Pa. 161.
to have right judgment between the life present and the life to come, we
shall find how little the pains, imprisonment, standers, lies, and death it
self is in the world, in respect of pains everlasting, the Prison infernal, and
Dungeon of Hell, the Sentence of Gods judgment, and everlasting Death. When a
man has by seeking the Word of God found out what the things above be, then
must he se^ his affections upon them. And this Command is more hard than the
other; for man's knowledge many times sees the best: men know that there is a
life to come, better than this present, etc. Yet they set not their affection
upon it, they do more affect and love indeed a trifle of nothing in this world,
that pleases their affection, than the treasure of all treasures in Heaven. We
must set our affections on things above, i. e. when any thing worse than
Heaven, offers it self to be ours, if we will give our good wills to it, and
love it in our hearts, then ought we to see by the judgment of Gods Word,
whether we may have it without Gods displeasure; if we cannot, if the riches of
this world may not be gotten nor kept by Gods Law, neither our lives continued
without the denial of his honor, we must set our affections upon the riches
and life that is above, and not upon things that be upon the earth. This second
Command requires, that as our mind judges Heavenly things to be better than
Earthly, and the life to come better than the present life; so we should choose
them before other, and prefer them, etc. These things be easy to be spoken of,
but not so easy to be used and practiced. -- Read Psa. 88. wherein is
contained the prayer of a man, that being vexed with adversaries and
persecutions, saw nothing but death and hell, apprehending not only man, but
God angry with him; yet he by Prayer humbly resorted unto God, and put the hope
of his salvation in him, whom he felt his enemy. -- In this command (possess
your lives by your patience) God requires every one to be patient, he says
not, It is sufficient that other holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles,
Evangelists, and Martyrs continued their lives in patient suffering the
troubles of this world; but Christ says it to every one of his people. By your
patience continue you your life, not that man has patience in himself, but
that he must have it for himself of God, the only Giver of it, if he purpose to
be a godly man. Besides, as our Profession and Religion requires patience
outwardly, without resistance and force, so requires it patience of the mind,
and not to be angry with God, although he use us that be his own creatures, as
him lists. We may not murmr against God, Pa. 162.
but say always his judgments be right and just, and rejoice that it pleases
him to use us, as he used heretofore such as he most loved in this world. Have
a singular care to this command, be glad and rejoice, etc. he shows great
cause why, because your reward is great in Heaven. Mat. 5.
Christ also takes from us all shame and rebuke, as though it were not an
honor to suffer for him, because the wicked world does curse and abhor such
poor troubled Christians. He places all his honorably, saying, Even so
persecuted they the Prophets that were before you. -- We may learn by things
that nourish and maintain us, both meat and drink, what loathsomness, and (in a
manner) abhorring they come to before they work their perfection in us, etc.
that whosoever saw the same would loath and abhor his own nourishment before it
came to its perfection. Is it then any marvel if such Christians, as God
delights in, be so mangled and defaced in this world, which is the Kitchen
and Mill, to boil and grind the flesh of Gods people in, till they atchieve
their perfection in the world to come? -- Raw flesh is not meat wholesome for
man, and unmo^tified men and women be not creatures meet for God. Christ's
people must be broken and all to torn in the Mill of this world, and so shall
they be most fine meant to their Heavenly Father. -- We must therefore
pat^ently suffer, and willingly attend upon Gods doings, although they seem
clean contrary, after our judgment, to our wealth and salvation, as Abraham
did, when he was bid to offer his Son Isaac, in whom God promised the Blessing,
and multiplying of his seed. Joseph at the last came to that which God promised
him, although in the mean time, after the judgment of the world, he was never
like to be, as God said he should be Lord over his Brethren. When Christ would
make the blind man to see, he put clay upon his eyes, which after the judgment
of man was a means rather to make his double blind, than to give him his sight,
but he obeyed and knew that God could work his desire, what means soever he
used contrary to man's reasons. -- To judge things indifferently, the trouble be
not yet generally, as they were in our good Fathers time, soon after the death
and Resurrection of our Savior Christ. Mat. 24.
-- Was there ever such trouble as Christ threatened upon Jerusalem? Toward the
end of the world we have nothing so much extremity as they had then, but even
as we be able to bear. --

In another Letter. -- I require you not to forget your duty toward God in
these perilous days, in the which the Lord will try us. I trust you do
increase by the reading of the Scriptures, the knowledge you have of God, and
that you diligently apply your self to follow the same* for the knowledge
helps not, except the life be according thereto.

-- I commend you to God, and the guiding of his good Spirit, to stablish and
confirm you in all well doing, and keep you blameless to the day of the Lord,
watch and pray, for this day is at hand.

In his Letter to his charitable Friends in London. -- For your liberality I
most heartily thank you, and praise God highly in you for you, etc. praying him
to preserve you from all famine, scarcity, and lack of the truth of his Word,
which is the lively food of your souls, as you preserve my body from hunger and
other necessaries which would happen unto me, were it not cared for by the
charity of godly people. Such as have spoiled me of all that I had, have
imprisoned me, and appointed not one halfpenny to feed or relieve me withal;
but I do forgive them, and pray for them daily in my poor Prayer to God, and
from my heart I wish their salvation, and quietly and patiently bear their
injuries, wishing no farther extremity to be used toward us: yet if the
contrary seem best to our heavenly Father, I have made my reckoning, and fully
resolved to suffer the uttermost that they are able to do against me; yea death
it self by the aid of Christ Jesus, who died the most vile death of the Cross
for us, wretched and miserable sinners. But of this I am assured, that the
wicked world with all his force and power shall not touch one of the hairs of
our heads without leave and license of our heavenly Father, whose will be done
in all things. If he will life, life be it; if he will death, death be it; only
we pray that our wills may be subject to his will. -- If we be contented to
obey Gods will, and for his commands sake to surrender our goods and our lives
to be at his pleasure, it makes no matter whether we keep goods and life, or
lose them. Nothing can hurt us that is taken from us for Gods cause, nor can
any thing at length do us good that is preserved contrary to Gods command. Let
us wholly suffer God to use us and ours after his holy wisdom, and beware we
neither use nor govern our selves contrary to his will by our own wisdom; for
if we do, our wisdom will at length prove foolishness. It is kept to no good
purpose, that we keep contrary to his Commandments. It can by no means be taken
from us, that he would should tarry with us. He is no good Christian that
rules himself and his, as worldly means serve; for he that so does, shall have
as many changes as chances in the world. To day with the world he shall live
and praise the truth of God, to morrow, as the world will, so will he like and
praise the falsehood of man; to day with Christ, to morrow with Antichrist. --
Glorify your heavenly Father both with your inward and outward man. If ye
think ye can inwardly in the heart serve him, and yet outwardly serve with the
world in external service the thing that is not of God, ye deceive your selves;
for both the body and soul must concur together in the honor of God; 1 Cor. 6.
for if an honest wife be bound to give both heart and body to faith and
service in marriage, and if in honest wives faith in the heart cannot stand
with a who rish or defiled body, much less can the true faith of a Christian in
the service of Christianity stand with the bodily service of external idolatry;
for the mystery of Marriage is not so honorable between man and wife, as it is
between Christ and every Christian. Therefore (dear Brethren) pray to the
heavenly Father, that as he spared not the soul nor the body of his dearly
beloved Son, but applied both of them with extreme pain, to work our salvation
both of soul and body: so he will give us all grace to apply our souls and
bodies to be Servants to him. -- Let us not deride our selves, and say our
souls serve him, whatsoever bodies do to the contrary for civil order and
policy. But alas! Pa. 164.
I know by my self what troubles you, viz. the great danger of the world, that
will revenge (ye think) your service to God with sword and fire, with loss of
goods and lands: but (dear Brethren) weigh on the other side, that your enemies
and Gods enemies shall not do as much as they would, but as much as God shall
suffer them, who can trap them in their own counsels, and destroy them in the
midst of their furies. Remember ye be the Workmen of the Lord, and called into
his Vineyard, there to labor till Evening-Tide, that you may receive your
penny, which is more worth then all the Kingdoms of the Earth; but he that
called us into his Vineyard, has not told us how fore and how fervently the
San shall trouble us in our labor, but has bid us labor, and commit the
bitterness thereof to him, who can and will so moderate all afflictions, that
no man shall have more laid upon him, then in Christ he shall be able to bear,
unto whose merciful tuition and defense I commend both your souls and bodies.

Yours with my poor Prayer. J. H.


In a Letter to a Merchant of London. -- I thank God and you for the great help
and consolation I have received in time of adversity by your charity, but most
rejoice that you be not altered from truth, although falsehood cruelly seeks
to disdain her. Judge not my Brother truth by outward appearance, for truth now
worse appears, and is more vilely rejected then falsehood. Leave the outward
show, and see by the Word of God what is truth, and accept truth, and dislike
her not, though man call her falsehood. As it is now, so it has been
heretofore: truth has been rejected, and falsehood received. Such as have
professed truth, have smarted, and the friends of falsehood laughed them to
scorn. The one having the commendation of truth by man, but the condemnation of
falsehood by God, flourishing for a time with endless destruction; the other
afflicted a little season, but ending with immortal joys. Wherefore, dear
Brother, ask and demand of your Book, the Testament of Jesus Christ, in these
woeful and wretched days, what you should think, and what you should stay your
selves upon for a certain truth, and whatsoever you hear taught, try it by your
Book, whether it be true or false. The days be dangerous and full of peril,
not only for the world, and worldly things, but for Heaven and neavenly
things. It is a trouble to lose the treasure of this life, but yet a very pain
if it be kept with the offense of God. Cry, call, pray, and in Christ daily
require help, succor, mercy, wisdom, grace, and defense, that the wickedness
of this world prevail not against us. --

In his Letter to Mrs. Wilkinson. -- I am very glad to hear of your health, and
do thank you for your loving tokens; but I am a great deal more glad to hear
how Christianly you avoid Idolatry, and prepare your self to suffer the
extremity of the world, rather then to endanger your self to God. You do as you
ought to do in this behalf, and in suffering of transitory pains, you shall
avoid permanent torments in the world to come. Use your life and keep it with
as much quietness as you can, so that you offend not God. The ease that comes
with his displeasure turns at length to unspeaka^le pains; and the gains of
the world, with the loss of his favors is beggary and wretchedness. --

In his Letter to Mr. Hall and his Wife. -- The days be dangerous and full of
peril; but let us comfort ourselves in calling to remembrance the days of our
Forefathers, upon whom the Lord sent such troubles, that many hundreds, yea
thousands died for the testimony of Jesus Christ, both men and women, suffering
with patience and constancy as much cruelty as Tyrants could devise, and so
departed out of this miserable world to the bliss everlasting, where now they
remain for ever, looking always for the end of this sinful world, when they
shall receive their bodies again in immortality, and see the number of the
Elect associated with them in full and consummated joys; and as virtuous men
suffering Martyrdom now rest in joys everlasting, their pains ending their
sorrows, and beginning their ease: so did their constancy and stedfastness
animate and confirm all good people in the truth, and gave them encouragement
to suffer the like, rather then to fall with the world to consent unto
wickedness and idolatry. Wherefore, my dear Friends, seeing God has
illuminated you in the same true faith, wherein the Apostles, and Evangelists,
and all Martyrs suffered most cru^^ death, thank him for his grace in
knowledge, and pray to him for strength and perseverance, that ye be not
ashamed nor afraid to confess it. Ye be in the truth, and the gates of Hell
shall never prevai^ against it, nor Antichrist with all his Imps prove i^
false; they may persecute and kill, but never overcome. Be of good comfort, and
fear God more then man. This life is short and miserable; happy be they that
can spend it to the glory o^ God.

In his Letter to Mrs. Pa. 165.
Warcop. -- I did rejoice to understand, that you be fully resolved by Gods
grace to suffer extremity, rather then to go from the truth which you have
professed. -- As you be traveling this perilous journey, take this Lesson
with you, practiced by the Wise men, Matthew. 2. Such as traveled to find
Christ, followed only the Star, and as long as they saw it, they were assured
they were in the right way, and had great mirth in their journey; but when they
entered into Jerusalem, whereas the Star led them not thither, but to Bethlem,
and there asked the Citizens the thing that the Star showed before, they were
not only ignorant of Bethlem, but lost the sight of the Star, etc. -- The Word
is the only Stat that shows us where Christ is, and which way we may come
unto him; But as Jerusalem stood in the way, and was an impediment to the Wise
men, so does the Synigogue of Antichrist, that bears the Name of Jerusalem,
i. e. the Vision of Peace, and among the people now is called the Catholic
Church, stands in the way that Pilgrims must go by through this world to
Bethlem, i. e. the house of bread or plentifulness, and is an impediment to all
Christian Travelers; yea, and except the more grace of God be, will keep the
Pilgrim still in her, that they shall not come where Christ is at all; and to
stay them indeed, they take away the Star of Light, which is Gods Word, that it
cannot be seen. -- Ye may see what great dangers happened unto these Wise men,
whilst they were learning of Liars, where Christ was. (1) They were out of
their way. And (2) They lost their Guide and Conductor. -- If we come into the
Church of men, and ask for Christ, we go out of the way, and lose also our
Conductor and Guide, that only leads us straight thither. -- Sister, take
heed, you shall in your journey toward Heaven meet with many a monstrous
beast: have salve therefore of Gods Word; therefore ready you shall meet
husbands, children, lovers and friends, that shall, if God be not with them, be
very lets and impediments to your purpose. You shall meet with slander and
contempt of the world, and be accounted ungracious and ungodly, you shall hear
and meet with cruel tyranny to do you all extremities; you shall now and then
see the troubles of your own conscience, and feel your own weakness; you shall
hear that you be cursed by the sentence of the Catholic Church, with such like
terrors, that pray to God, and follow the Star of his Word, and you shall
arrive at the Port of Eternal Salvation, by the merits only of Jesus Christ.
--

Hudson.
When Thomas Hudson of Ailesham in Norfolk saw the Constable come to his house
to apprenend him, Fox, Vol. 3 Page 869.
he said; Now mine hour is welcome, friends, welcome, you be they that shall
lead me to life in Christ. I thank God therefore, and the Lord enable me
thereto for his mercies sake; for his desire was, and he ever prayed (if it
were the Lords will) that he might suffer for the Gospel of Christ.

When Berry threatened him, saying, I will write to the Bishop my good Lord,
etc. O Sir, (said he) there is no Lord but God, though there be many lords and
many gods.

Will thou recant (said Berry the Priest) or no? The Lord forbid (said Hudson)
I had rather die many deaths then to do so.

When he came first to the Stake, Pa. 870.
he was very sad, not for his death, but for lack of feeling his Christ; and
therefore came from his Fellow Sufferers under the Chain, and fell down upon
his knees, and prayed; and at last he rose with great joy, as a man new
changed, even from death to life, and said, Now I thank God I am strong, and
pass not what man can do unto me.

Hullier.
Mr. John Hullier, Conduct in Kings College at Cam^ridge, suffered martyrdom
at Cambridge, April 2. A. 1556.

In his Letter to the Christian Congregation. Fox. Vol. 3. page 696.
--

It stands now most in hand (O dear Christians) all them that look to be
accounted of Christ's flock at the great and terrible day, when a separation
shall be made, etc. faithfully in this time of great affliction, to hear our
Master Christ's voice, the only of true Shepherd of our souls, who says, Mat.
24.
Whosoever shall endure to the end shall be saved -- In this time we must needs
either show that we be his saithful Soldiers, Ephesians. 6.
and continue in his battle to the end, putting on the Armor of God, the
buckler of Faith, the breast plate of Love, the helmet of Hope and Salvation,
and the Sword of his Holy Word, with all instance of supplication and prayer,
or else, if we do not work and labor with these, we are Apostates and false
Soldiers, shrinking most unthankfully from our Gracious and Sove^reign Lord
and Captain Christ, and leaning to Belial; for he says plainly, Whosoever
bears not my Cross, and follows me, cannot be my Disciple, Luke 14.
and, No man can serve two Masters; for either he must hate the one and love
the other, Mat. 6.
or else he shall lean to the one and despise the other. Elias also said unto
the people, Why halt ye between two opinions? 1 Kin. 18.
If the Lord be God, follow him; or if Baal be he, follow him. -- If Christ be
that only good and true Shepherd, that gave his life for us, then let us, that
bear his mark, and have our consciences sprinkled with his blood, follow
altogether for our salvation his heavenly voice and calling, according to our
profession and first promise. If we shall not, certainly (say what we can)
though we bear the Name of Christ, John 10.
we are none of his Sheep indeed; for he says manifestly, My sheep hear my
voice and follow me: A stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him,
for they know not the voice of a stranger. -- The craft and wiliness of our
subtle enemy is manifold and diverse, and full of close windings: -- At this
present day if he cannot induce one thoroughly, as others do, to savor his
devilish Religion, and of good will and free heart to help to uphold the same,
yet he will inveigle him to resort to his wicked and whorish Schoolhouse, and
to keep company with his Congregation there, and to hold his peace and say
nothing, whatsoever he think, etc. by that subtle means flattering him, that
he shall both save his life and also his goods, and live in quiet. But if we
look well on Christ's holy Will and Testament, we shall perceive that he came
not to make any such peace upon Earth, nor that he gave any such peace to his
Disciples, I leave peace with you (says he) my peact I give you, John 14.15,
16.
not as the world gives it, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled
and fearful. These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye should have
peace, in the world ye shall have affliction; but be of good cheer, I have
overcome the world. Luke 14.
The Servant is not greater then his Lord and Master; if they have persecuted
me, they shall also persecute you. If any man come to me and hates not his
father and mother, etc. yea and moreover his own life, it is not possible for
him to be my Disciple. Blessed be ye, that now weep; for ye shall laugh: and
woe be unto you that now laugh, Pa. 697.
for ye shall mourn and weep. He that will find his life, shall lose it.
Therefore the God of that true peace and comfort, preserve us that we never
obey such a false Flatterer, who at length will pay us home once for all,
bringing for temporal peace and quietness, everlasting trouble, etc. for these
vain and transitory goods, extreme loss of the eternal treasure and
inheritance; for this mortal life, deprivation of the most joyful life
immortal, and endless death most miserable, etc. -- I judge it better to go to
School with our Master Christ, and to be under his Ferula and Rod (although it
seems sharp and grievous for a time) that at length we may be inhetiters with
him of everlasting joy, rather then to keep company with the Devils Scholars,
the adulterous generation, in his School, that is all full of pleasure for a
while, and at the end to be paid with the wages of continual burning in the
most horrible Lake, which burns evermore with fire and brimstone, etc. --
What does he else, I pray you, that resorteth to the Ministration and Service,
that is most repugnant to Christ's holy Testament, there keeping still silence,
and nothing reproving the same, but in the face of the world by his very deed
it self, declare himself to be of a false, fearful, dissembling, feigned, and
unfaithful heart, discouraging, as much as lies in him, all the residues of
Christ's Host, and giving a manifest offense unto the weak, and also confirming,
encouraging, and rejoicing the hearts of the adversaries in all their evil
doing? by which he showed himself, neither to love God, whom he sees to be
dishonored and blasphemed of an Antichristian Minister, nor yet his neighbor,
before whom he should rebuke the evil, according to the command, Thou shall not
hate thy Neighbor, Lev. 18.2 Tim. 1.
but reprove him, etc. -- But God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of
power and love. Be not ashamed to testify our Lord, but suffer adversity with
the Gospel, Mat. 10.
through the power of God, etc. 1 Pet. 3.
Fear not them that kill the body, etc. Fear not, though they seem terrible
unto you, neither be troubled, but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Only
let your conversation be as becomes the Gospel, Phil. 1.
etc. in nothing fearing your adversaries, which is to them a token of
damnation, and to you of salvation, and that of God; for unto you it is given
not only to believe in Christ, but to suffer for his sake. -- In the Revelation
it is written, That the fearful shall have their part with the Unbelieving and
Abominable, Rev. 21.
in the Lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
-- Wide is the gate and broad is the way which leads to destruction, Matt. 7.
and many there be that go in thereat; but strait is the gate, and narrow is
the way that leads unto life, and few there be that find it. -- Thus I wholly
commit you to him, Pa. 698.
and to the Word of his grace, which is able to build surther, beseeching you
most heartily to pray for me, that I may be strong in the Lord and in the power
of his might, and stand perfect in all things, being always prepared and ready,
looking for the mercy of our Lord unto eternal rest, and I will pray for you,
as I am most bound. So I trust he will graciously hear us for his promise sake
in Christ.

Your Christian Brother, a Prisoner of the Lord, John Hullier.


In another Letter to the Congregation of Christ's faithful followers. -- Most
dear Christians, having now the sweet comfort of Gods saving health, and being
confirmed with his free Spirit, (be he only praised therefore) I am
constrained in my conscience to admonish you, as ye tender the salvation of
your souls, by all manner of means to separate your selves from the
Antichristian Company, considering what is said in the Revelation, If any man
worship the Beast and his Image, Revel. 14
and receive his mark in the forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of
the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured into the cup of his wrath, etc.
-- The Beast is none other, but the carnal and fleshly Kingdom of Antichrist.
-- What do they else but worship this Beast and his Image, who after they had
escaped from the filthiness of the world, 2 Pet. 2.
through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, are yet again
tangled therein, and overcome, using dissimulation for fear of their
displeasure, doing one thing outwardly, and thinking inwardly another: So
having them in reverence under a cloak and color, to whom they ought not so
much as to say, God speed; Joh. Ep. 2
and adjoining themselves to the Malignant Congregation, which they ought to
abhor as a Den of Thieves and Marderers, and a Brothel-house of most
blasphemous Fornicators. -- But this feignedness and dissimulation, Christ and
his Gospel will no ways allow. -- Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my
words in this adulterous and sinful generation; Luke 9.
of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in the glory
of his Father, etc. Cursed be the dissemblers, etc. Mal. 1. Heb. 6. Luke 6.
Ye were once enlightened, and tasted of the heavenly gift, -- And no man that
puts his hand to the Plough and looks back, is apt for the Kingdom of
God. -- They went out from us, but they were not of us; 1 John 2.
for if they had been of us, no doubt they would have continued with us. --
Wherefore, good Christians, for Gods dear love, deceive not your selves through
your own wisdom, 1 Cor. 3.
and through the wisdom of the world, which is falsehood before God; but
certify and stay your own consciences with the faithful Word of God, Psa. 145
Hebr. 3.
etc. Though Gods mercy is over all his works, yet it does not extend but only
to them that hold fast the considence and rejoicing of hope unto the end, not
being weary of well doing, but rather every day waxing stronger and stronger in
the inward man. In the Revelation, where it is entreated of the Beast and his
Image, it is said, Rev. 13.
Here is the sufferance of Saints, and here are they that keep the Commandments
and Faith of Jesus Christ; intimating, that God does use those wicked men as
instruments for a time, to try the patience and faith of his peculiar people,
etc. -- Peradventure you will say, What shall we do? shall we cast our selves
headlong to death? I say not so; but this I say, That we are all bound (if
ever we look to receive salvation at Gods hands) in this case to be wholly
obedient to his determinate counsel, etc. and then to cast all our care on him,
who works all in all for the best unto them that love him. Now thus he
commands, Come away from her my people, Rev. 18.
that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
-- Come out from among them, Pa. 699.
and join not your selves to their unlawful Assemblies; yea, do not once show
your selves with the least pa^ of your body to favor their wicked doings. --
Now choose you which way you will take, either the narrow, etc. or the broad
way, etc. I for my part have now written this short admonition to you of good
will, (as God is my witness) to exhort you to that way, which at length you
shall prove and find to be best; and I do not only write this, but I will (with
the assistance of Gods grace) seal it with my blood. --

Hunter.
Atwell a Sumner, Fox, Vol. 3 page 190.
telling William Hunter it was never a merry world since the Bible came abroad
in English: Say not so for Gods sake (said Hunter) for it is Gods Book, out of
which every one that has grace may learn to know what things both please God,
and also what displeases him. Could not we tell (said Atwell) before this time
how God was served? No (said Hunter) nothing so well as we may now, if that we
might have his blessed Word amongst us still as we have had. You must turn or
burn, (said Atwell) God give me grace (said Hunter) that I may believe his Word
and confess his Name, whatsoever come thereof.

Whereas you doubt of my belief (said Hunter to Wood the Vicar of Southwell) I
would it were tried, Page 19.
Whether that you or I would stand faster in our Faith. Yea thou Heretic (said
Wood) would thou have it so tried? That which you call heresy (said Hunter)
I serve my Lord God withal; I would that you and I were fast tied to a Stake,
to prove, whether that you or I would stand strongest to our Faith. It shall
not be so tried (said Wood) No (said Hunter) I think so; for if I might, I
think I know who would soonest recant; for I durst set my foot against yours
even to the death.

Bon^er telling him, Pa. 192.
that he was content he should keep his conscience to himself, so that he would
go to Church, and receive, etc. No (said he) I will not do so for all the good
in the world. Then (said Bonner) I will make you sure enough, I warrant you.
Well (said Hunter) you can do no more then God will permit you. Well (said B.)
will you recant indeed by no means? No (said H.) never while I live, God
willing.

Bonner asking him how old he was, he said, He was Nineteen years old. Well
(said B.) you will be burned ere you be Twenty, if you will not recant. H.
answered, God strengthen me in his Truth.

Bonner, Pa. 193.
even after Sentence was past, offering him, if he would then recant, to make
him a Freeman of the City, and to give him Forty pound in money to set up with,
or to make him Steward of his House, etc. Hunter said unto him, My Lord, if you
cannot persuade my conscience by Scriptures, I cannot find in my heart to turn
from God for the love of the world; for I count all things worldly but loss and
dung in respect of the love of Christ. If thou die in this mind (said B.)
thou art condemned for ever. God judges righteously (said H.) and justifies
them, whom man condemns unjustly.

When he was brought to Burntwood to be burned, his Father and Mother came to
him, and desired heartily of God that he might continue to the end in that good
way, which he had begun, and his Mother said unto him, That she was glad that
ever she was so happy to bear such a Child, which could find in his heart to
lose his life for Christ's Names sake. Then said he to his Mother, For my little
pain which I shall suffer, which is but short, Christ has promised me a Crown
of Joy. May you not be glad of that, Mother? With that his Mother kneeled down
on her knees, saying, I pray God strengthen thee, my Son to the end: Yea I
think thee as well bestowed, as any Child that ever I pare.

His Father said, I was afraid of nothing but that my Son should have been
killed in the Prison for hunger and cold, the Bishop was so hard to him.

The night before his Execution, he had a dream, that he was where the Stake
was pitched where he should be burned, and that it was at the Towns end, where
the Butts stood, (which was so indeed) and that he met his Father going to the
Stake, and that there was a Priest at the Stake, which went about to have him
recant, and that he said to him, Away false Prophet, and that he exhorted the
people to beware of him, and such as he was: which things came to pass
accordingly.

Whilst he was led to the Stake, the Sheriffs Son came to William and embraced
him, saying, William be not afraid of these men, who are here present with
Bills and Weapons, ready prepared to bring you to the place where you shall be
burned. William answered, I thank God I am not afraid; for I have cast my
account, what it will cost me already. Then the Sheriffs Son could speak no
more to him for weeping.

When he met his Father (according to his dream) his Father said unto him, God
be with thee Son William. William answered, God be with you good Father, and be
of good comfort; for I hope we shall meet again when we shall be merry.

At the Stake the Sheriff told him, That there was a Letter from the Queen; if
he would recant, he should live, if not, he must be burned. No (said William) I
will not recant, God willing.

Mr. Brown telling him (upon his desire to the people to pray for him as long
as he was alive) I will pray no more for thee, then I will pray for a Dog. Mr.
Brown (said William) now you have that you sought for, and I pray God it be not
laid to your charge in the last day; howbeit I forgive you. I ask no
forgiveness of thee (said Mr. Brown) Well (said William) if God forgive you
not, I shall require my blood at your hands. Then said William Hunter, Son of
God shine upon me. Immediately the Sun in the Firmament shined out of a dark
cloud, so full in his face; that he was constrained to look another way.

When the Priest came (according to his dream) he said, Away thou false
Prophet. Beware of them good people, and come away from their abominations,
lest that you be partakers of their plagues. Then (said the Priest) look how
thou burnest here, so shall thou burn in Hell. William answered, Thou lie,
thou false Prophet, away thou false Prophet, away.

When the fire was kindled, his Brother said to him, William, think on the holy
Passion of Christ, and be not afraid of Death. William answered, I am not
afraid. Then lift he up his hands to Heaven, and said, Lord, Lord, Lord,
receive my spirit.

Highed.
Mr. Highed of Essex being pressed by Bonner to recant, Fox, Vol. 3 page 196.
answered, I will not abjure; for I have been of this mind these sixteen years,
and do what ye can, ye shall do no more then God will permit you to do, and
with what measure ye measure unto us, look for the same again at Gods hands.

When his Articles and Answers were read, Pa. 198.
he said, -- Ye go about to trap us with your subtilties and snares: and though
my Father and Mother and other my Kins^olk did believe as you say, yet they
were deceived in so believing: and whereas you say Doctor Cranmer and others,
etc. be Heretics, I do wish that I were such an Heretic, as they were and be.

Then Bonner asked him again, Whether he would turn from his error and come to
the unity of their Church? No (said he) I would ye would recant; for I am in
the truth, and you in error.

Hus.
Mr. John Hus preaching at the honorable and very solemn Funeral of three in
Prague, Fox, Vol. 1 Pa. 778.
who had been put to death in Prison, for calling the Pope Antichrist, and
speaking against Indulgences, at whose Funeral was sung on this wise, These be
the Saints which for the Testament of God gave their bodies, etc. much
commended them for their constancy, and blessed God the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who had hid the way of his Verity so from the prudent of the world, and
had revealed it to the simple, who chose rather to please God, then man. This
occasioned his expulsion out of Prague, being before excommunicated by the Pope.

The Emperor having given safe conduct to Mr. John Hus to come to the general
Council at Constance, he promised to come, Page 786.
professing he was ready always to satisfy all men, which shall require him
to give a reason of his faith and hope, etc. and giving notice to all, that
could object any error or heresy to him to appear, and not spare him.

The Twenty sixth day after he came to Constance, Pa. 789, 790.
two Bishops, etc. were sent to him to bring him before the Pope and his
Cardinals: To whom he answered, I am not come to defend my Cause particularly
before the Pope and his Cardinals, but to appear before the whole Council, and
there answer for my defense openly, etc. unto all such things as shall be
demanded, or required of me. Notwithstanding forasmuch as you do require me so
to do, I will not refuse to go with you; and if it happen that they evil
entreat me, yet nevertheless I trust in my Lord Jesus, that he will so comfort
and strengthen me, that I shall desire much rather to die for his glory sake,
then to deny the Verity, which I have learned by his holy Scriptures.

When he came to the Cardinals, they told him they had heard that he had taught
great and manifest errors through the Realm of B^hemia, etc. You shall
understand (answered Mr. Hus) that I am th^s minded and affectioned, that I
should rather choose to die, then I should be found culpable of one only error,
much less of many and great errors: For this cause I am willingly come to the
general Council, to receive correction, if any man can prove any errors in me.

Some of the Articles presented to the Council against him. -- Pa. 791.
(4) He says that all Priests be of like power. (8) He holds this opinion,
That a man being once ordained a Priest or a Deacon, cannot be forbidden or
kept back from the office of preaching.

When several false witnesses rose up against him, Pa. 799.
he said, Albeit they were as many more in number as they are, I do much more
esteem, yea and without comparison regard the witness of my Lord God before the
witness of all mine adversaries.

He being asked whether it was lawful for him to appeal unto Christ, Pa. 800.
answered, Verily I do affirm before you all, that there is no more just, nor
effectual plea, then that which is made unto Christ; forasmuch as the Law does
determine, that to appeal is no other thing then in a cause of grief o^ wrong
done by an inferior Judge to implore and require aid and remedy at an higher
Judges hands. Who is then an higher Judge then Christ? Who can know, or judge
the matter more justly, or with more equity? In him is found no deceit, no^ can
he be deceived. Who can better help the miserable and oppressed then he?

It being in his Accusation, that he counseled the people to resist with the
sword all such as did gainsay his Doctrine, etc. he answered, That he at all
times when he preached, did diligently admonish and warn the people, that they
should arm themselves to defend the truth of the Gospel, according to the
saying of the Apostle, With the hel^et and sword of salvation; and that he
never spoke of any material sword, but of that which is the Word of God.

Some more Articles against him, taken out of his Treatise of the Church. Pa.
802.
(1) There is but one holy universal, or Catholic Church, which is the
universal Company of all the Predestinate. (6) A reprobate man is never a
member of the holy Church. -- (18) An Heretic ought not to be committed to the
secular powers to be put to death, Pa. 804.
for it is sufficient that he suffer the Ecclesiastical censure.

In his appeal. -- Forasmuch as the most mighty Lord, One in Essence, Three in
Person, Pa. 805.
is both the chief and first, and also the last and uttermost refuge of all
those which are oppressed: -- and forasmuch as the Lord Jesus Christ, very God
and Man, being compassed in with the Priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, wicked
Judges and Witnesses, etc. has left behind him this godly example for them
that shall come after him, to the intent they should commit all their causes
into the hand of God. -- O Lord behold my affliction, etc. thou art my
Protector and Desender. O Lord, thou have given me understanding, and I have
acknowledged thee.

For mine own part I have been as a meek Lamb, which is led unto sacrifice, and
have not resisted against them. -- Deliver me from mine enemies, for thou art
my God. -- I appeal to the Sovereign and most just Judge, who is not defiled
with cruelty, nor can be corrupted with gifts and rewards, neither yet be
deceived by false witness. -- I John Hus do present and offer this my appeal to
my Lord Jesus Christ, Pa. 806.
my just Judge, who knows, and defends, and justly judges every man's just
and true cause.

The day before his condemnation, when four Bishops were sent by the Emperor
to him, to know whether he would stand to the judgment of the Council, Pa. 816.
Mr. John de clum spoke thus unto him. Mr. J. Hus, -- I require you, if you
know your self guilty of any of those errors which are objected against you,
that you will not be ashamed to alter your mind to the will of the Council; if
contrariwise, I will be no Author to you, that you should do any thing contrary
to your conscience, but rather to suffer any kind of punishment, then to deny
that which you have known to be the truth. Mr. H^^ with tears answered, Verily
as before I have oftentimes done, I do take the most high God for my witness,
that I am ready with my whole heart and mind, if the Council can instruct me
any better by the Scripture to change my purpose. One of the Bishops telling
him he should not be so arrogant as to prefer he is own opinion before the
judgment of the whole Council; Pa. 817.
he said, If he which is the meanest or least in all this Council can convact
me of error, I will with an humble heart and mind do whatsoever the Council
shall require of me.

When they condemned his appeal as heretical, Pa. 819.
he said, O Lord Jesus Christ, whose Word is openly condemned here in this
Council, unto thee again do I appeal, which when thou wast evil entreated of
thine enemies, did appeal unto God thy Father, committing thy Cause unto a
most just Judge, that by thy example we also, being oppressed with manifest
wrongs and injuries, should flee unto thee.

Whilst they were reading his Sentence -- He interrupted them often; Pa. 820.
and specially when he was charged with obstinacy, he said with a loud voice, I
was never obstinate, but as always heretofore, even so now again I desire to
be taught by the holy Scriptures; and I do profess my self to be so de^^ous of
the truth, that if I might by one only word subvert the errors of all
Heretics, I would not refuse to enter into what peril soever it were to speak
it.

When the Sentence was ended, kneeling down upon his knees, he said; Lord Jesus
Christ, forgive mine enemies, by whom thou know that I am sa^fly accused,
etc. forgive them for thy great mercies sake.

When he was degraded, he spoke to the people ^h^s; These Lords and Bishops do
exhort and counsel me, that I should here confess before you ^ll; that I have
erred; the which thing to do, if it might be done with the infamy and reproach
of ^an only, they might peradventure easily per^wade me thereunto, but now
truly I am in the ^ight of the Lord my God, without whose great ^gnominy and
grudge of mine own conscience, I can by no means do that which they require of
me. -- With what countenance should I behold the ^eavens? With what face should
I look upon ^^em whom I have taught, where of there is a great number, if
through me it should come to pass that those things, which they have hitherto
known to be ^ost certain and sure, should now be made uncer^ain? Should I by
this my example astonish or ^rouble so many souls, so many consciences, endued
with the most firm and certain knowledge of the Scriptures and Gospel of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and his most pure Doctrine, armed against all the assaults
of Satan? I will never do it, neither commit any such kind of offense, that I
should seem more to esteem this vile carcass appointed unto death, then their
health and salvation.

When one of the Bishops took from him the Chalice, saying, O cursed Judas,
etc. We take away from thee this Chalice of thy salvation. But I truth (said
he) unto God the Father Omnipotent, and my Lord Jesus Christ, for whose sake I
do suffer these things, that he will not take away the Chalice of his
Redemption, but have a steadfast and firm hope that this day I shall drink
thereof in his Kingdom.

The other Bishops took away the Vestments put upon him, and each of them
giving him their curse. Whereunto he said, That he did willingly embrace and
hear those blasphemies for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Then the Bishops caused to be made a Crown of Paper, in which were printed
three ugly Devils, and this title set over their heads, Heresiarchs, A
Ringleader of an Heresy, and he saw it, he said, My Lord Jesus Christ for my
sake did wear (...) Crown of Thorns, why should not I then for his sake wear
this light Crown, be it never so ignominious: Truly I will do it, and that
willingly.

When it was set upon his head, the Bishops said, Now we commit thy soul unto
the Devil. But I (said Mr. Hus, lifting up his eyes toward Heaven) do commit my
Spirit into thy hands, O Lord Jesus Christ, unto thee I commend my Spirit which
thou have redeemed.

When the people heard his prayers at the Stake, Pa. 821.
they said, What he had done before we know not, but now we see and hear that he
does speak and pray very devoutly and godlily.

After he had prayed some while, being raised by his Tormentors, with a loud
voice he said, Lord Jesus assist and help me, that with a constant and patient
mind I may bear and suffer this cruel and ignominious death, whereunto I am
condemned for the preaching of thy most holy Gospel and Word.

When he beheld the Chain with which his Neck was to be tied to the Stake, he
smiling, said, That he would willingly receive the same Chain for Jesus Christ's
sake, who (he knew) was bound with a far worse Chain.

The Duke of Bavaria, Pa. 822.
before the fire was kindled, coming to him, and exhorting him to be mindful of
his safeguard, and renounce his errors, be answered; What error should I
renounce when as I know my self guilty of none; for as for those things that
are falsely alleged against me, I know that I never did so much as once think
them, much less preach them; for this was the principal end and purpose of my
Doctrine, that I might teach all men repentance and remission of sins, Clarks
first Volume of Lives, page 217. Leigh 's Saints Encouragements in evil times,
out of Luther 's Preface before Daniel.
according to the verity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the Exposition of
the holy Doctors; wherefore with a cheerful mind and courage I am here ready to
suffer death.

He told them at his death, That out of the ashes of the Goose (so Hus in the
Bohemian Language signifies) an hundred years after God would raise up a Swan
(so Luther in that Language signifies) in Germany, whose singing should
affright all those Va^tures, and who should escape their burning.

This Prophecy was exactly fulfilled in Luther, who rose up just an hundred
years after 1415 (the year when Mr. Hus was burnt) and though he so enraged the
Pope and his powerful party, he died in his bed.

In his Letter to the people of Prague. Pa. 823.
-- Be circumspect and watchful, that ye be not circumvented by the crafty
trains of the Devil; and the more circumspect ye ought to be, for that
Antichrist labors the more to trouble you. The last judgment is near at
hand, death shall swallow up many, but to the elect children of God, the
Kingdom of God draws near, because for them he gave his own body. Fear not
death, love together one another, persevere in understanding the good will of
God without ceasing. Let the terrible and horrible Day of Judgment be always
before your eyes, that you sin not, and also the joy of eternal life, whereunto
you must endeavor. Let the passions of our Savior be never out of your minds,
that you may bear with him and for him gladly whatsoever shall be laid upon
you; for if you shall consider well in your minds his Cross, nothing shall be
grievous unto you, and patiently you shall give place to tribulations,
cursings, rebukes, stripes and imprisonment, and shall not doubt to give your
lives for his holy truth, if need require. Know ye, Well Beloved, that
Antichrist being stirred up against you, devises diverse persecutions. -- But I
am in good hope, Pa. 824.
that through the mercy of our God, and by your Prayers, I shall persist
strongly in the immutable verity of God unto the last breath. -- I commend you
to the merciful Lord Jesus Christ, our true God, and the Son of the immaculate
Virgin Mary, who has redeemed us by his most bitter death, without all our
merits from eternal pains, from the thraldom of the Devil and from sin.

From Constance, A. 1415.

In his Letter to his Benefactors. -- I exhort you by the bowels of Jesus
Christ, that now ye setting aside the vanities of this present world, will give
your service to the eternal King Christ the Lord. Trust not in Princes, nor in
the Sons of men, in whom there is no health; for the Sons of men are
dissemblers and deceitful. To day they are, to morrow they perish; but God
remains for ever. He has his Servants not for any need he has of them, but
for their own profit, unto whom he performs that which he promises, and
fulfilleth that which he purposes to give. He casts off no faithful Servant
from him; for he says, Where I am, there also shall my Servant be; yea, the
Lord makes every Servant of his to be the Lord of all his possession, giving
himself unto him, and with himself all things. -- O happy is that Servant, whom
when the Lord shall come, he shall find watching. Happy is the Servant which
shall receive that King of Glory with joy. Wherefore well beloved Lords and
Benefactors, serve you that King in fear. --

In his Letter to the Lord John de Clum. -- The iniquity of the great Strumpet,
i.e. of the malignant Congregation (whereof mention is made in the Apocalypse)
is detected, and shall be more detected; with the which Strumpet the Kings of
the Earth do commit fornication, fornicating spiritually from Christ; and as is
there said, sliding back from the truth, and consenting to the lies of
Antichrist; through his seduction, and through fear, or through hope of
confederacy, forgetting of worldly honor. -- I rejoiced to perceive your mind
now to give over the vanity and painful service of this present world, and to
serve the Lord Jesus Christ quietly at home, whom to serve is to reign, as
Gregory says, whom he that serves faithfully has Jesus Christ himself in the
Kingdom of Heaven to minister unto him, as himself says, Blessed is that
Servant, whom when the Lord shall come he shall find waking, and so doing.
Verily I say unto you, that he rising shall gird himself, and shall minister
unto him. This do not the Kings of the world to their Servants. --

In another Letter. -- As touching death, God does know why he does defer it
both to me and to my well beloved Brother Mr. Jerome, who I trust will do
holily and without blame, and do know also that now he suffers more valiantly
then I my self a wretched sinner. God has given us a long time that we may
call to mind our sins the better, and repent for the same more fervently. He
has granted us time, that our long and great temptation should put away our
grievous sins, and bring the more consolation. He has given us time, wherein
we should remember the horrible rebukes of our merciful King and Lord Jesus,
and should ponder his cruel death, and so more patiently may learn to bear our
afflictions. And moreover, that we might keep in remembrance how the joys of
the li^e to come are not given after the joys of this world immediately, but
through many tribulations the Saints have entered into the Kingdom of Heaven;
for some of them have been cut and chopped all to pieces, some their eyes bored
through, some sod, some roasted, some slain alive, some burned quick, stoned,
crucified, grinded between milstones, drawn and haled hither and thither unto
Execution, drowned in waters, strangled, and hanged, torn in pieces, vexed with
rebukes before death, pined in prisons, and afflicted in bonds: and who is able
to recite all the torments and sufferings of the holy Saints, which they
suffered under the Old and New Testament, for the verity of God? -- And it will
be a marvel if any man now shall escape unpunished, who dare boldly resist the
wickedness and perversity, especially of those Priests which can abide no
correction. --

In another Letter. -- I desire, Pa. 825.
that if Audience be given me, that the King will be there present himself,
etc. And that you Right Noble and Gracious Lord John, with the Lord Henry, and
the Lord Wencelaus, etc. if you may, will be present, and hear what the Lord
Jesus Christ, my Procurator, and Advocate, and most gracious Judge will put
into my mouth to speak, that whether I live or die, you may be true and upright
witnesses with me, lest lying lips should say hereafter, that I swer^ed from
the truth which I have preached. --

In another Letter. -- My faithful and beloved in Christ, be not afraid with
their Sentence in condemning my Books; they shall be scattered hither and
thither abroad, like light Butterflies, and their Statutes shall endure as
Spider-webs. They were about to shake my constancy from the verity of Christ,
but they could not overcome the virtue of God in me. They would not reason with
the Scriptures against me, etc. And when I said I was desirous to be
instructed, if I did in any thing err, the chief Cardinal answered, Because
thou would be informed, there is no remedy but that thou must first revoke
thy Doctrine, according to the determination of fifty Batchelors appointed. O
high instruction!

-- These things I thought good to write unto you, that you may know how they
have overcome with no grounded Scripture, nor with reason, but only did essay
with terrors and deceits to persuade me to revoke and to abjure. But our
merciful God, whose Law I have magnified, was and is with me, and I trust so
will continue, and will keep me in his grace unto death. --

In another Letter. -- Beloved, I thought it needful to warn, that you should
not be discouraged, because the Adversaries have decreed that my Books shall be
burnt. Remember how the Israelites burned the Preachings of the Prophet Jeremy,
and yet they could not avoid the things that were prophesied of in them; Pa.
826.
for after they were burnt, the Lord commanded to write the same Prophecy
again, and that larger; which was done. -- It is also written in the Books of
the Macabees, that the wicked did burn the Law of God, and killed them that had
the same. Again, under the New Testament they burned the Saints with the Books
of the Law of God. -- Remember the sayings of our merciful Savior, by which he
forewarneth us; There shall be (says he) before the Day of Judgment great
tribulation, Mat. 24.
such as was not from the beginning, until this day, nor shall be afterward.
So that even the Elect of God should be deceived, if it were possible: but for
their sakes those days shall be shortened.

-- The Council of Constance shall not extend to Bobemia; for I think that many
of them which are of the Council shall die before they shall get from you my
Books. They shall depart from the Council, and be scattered abroad throughout
all parts of the world, like Storks, and then they shall know when Winter
comes what they did in Summer. I trust in God that he will send after me those
that shall be more valiant; and there are alive at this day that shall make
more manifest the malice of Antichrist, and shall give their lives to the death
for the truth of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall give both to you and me the
joys of life everlasting. -- This Epistle was written upon St. John Baptist's
day in Prison and in cold Irons, I having this Meditation with my self, that
John was beheaded in his Prison and Bonds for the Word of God.

In another Letter. -- I desire you, if any man at any time have noted any
levity, either in my talk, or in my conditions, that he do not follow the same,
but pray to God for me, Pa. 827.
to pardon me that sin of lightness. -- I look next day for the Sentence of
death, having a full trust that he will not leave me to deny his truth, etc.
How mercifully the Lord God has dealt with me in mavelous temptations ye
shall know, when as hereafter by the help of Christ we shall all meet together
in the joy of the world to come. -- I beseech you pray to God for our enemies.
--

In another Letter to a Minister. -- My dear Brother, be diligent in preaching
the Gospel, neglect not your. Vocation, labor like a blessed Soldier of
Christ. First, live godlily and holily. Secondly, teach faithfully and truly.
Thirdly, be an example to others in well doing, that you be not reprehended in
your sayings. -- Preach continually, but be short and fruitful. -- Never affirm
or maintain those things that be uncertain or doubtful. -- Exhort men to the
confession of their Faith. -- Against fleshly lust preach continally all that
ever you can, for that is the raging beast which devoureth men, for whom the
flesh of Christ did suffer.

In another Letter. Pa. 828.
-- O holy God, how largely does Antichrist extend his power and cruelty? But I
trust that his power shall be shortened, and his iniquity shall be detected more
and more amongst the faithful people. -- Let Antichrist rage so much as he
will, yet he shall not prevail against Christ. -- I am greatly comforted in
those words of our Savior, Happy be you, when men shall hate you, and shall
separate you, and shall rebuke you, and shall cast out your name as execrable,
for the Son of m^n, Rejoice and be glad; Luke 6.
for great is your reward in Heaven. O worthy, yea a most worthy consolation,
which not to understand, but to practice in time of tribulation, Jam. 1.
is an hard Lesson! -- Certainly it is a great matter for a man to rejoice in
trouble, and to take it for joy to be in diverse temptations. A light matter it
is to speak it, and to expound it; but a great matter to fulfill it. For why?
our most patient and most valiant Champion himself, etc. was troubled in
spirit, and said, My soul is heavy unto death, etc. and yet he notwithstanding,
being so troubled, said to his Disciples, Let not your hearts be troubled. -- O
most merciful Christ, draw us weak creatures after thee; for except thou
should draw us, we are not able to follow thee. -- Without th^^ we can do
nothing, much less enter into the cruel death for thy sake, Give us that prompt
and ready spirit, a bold heart, an upright faith, a firm hope, and perfect
charity, that we may give our lives patiently and joyfully for thy Names sake.

In another Letter. Pa. 829.
-- I love the counsel of the Lord above gold and precious stones. Wherefore I
trust in the mercy of Jesus Christ, that he will give me his Spirit to stand in
his Truth. Pray to the Lord, for the spirit is ready, but the flesh is weak. --
Know this for certain, that I have had great conflicts by dreams, in such sort
as I had much ado to refrain from crying out. I dreamed of the Popes escape
before he went; and after the Lord John had told me thereof, immediately in the
night it was told me, that the Pope should return to you again. I dreamed also
of the apprehending Mr. Hierom, although not in full manner as it was done. All
the imprisonments, whither and how I am carried, were opened to me before,
although not fully after the same form and circumstance. Many Serpents
oftentimes appeared to me, having heads also in their tail; but none of them
could bite me. These things I write, not esteeming my self a Prophet, or that I
extol my self, but only to signify to you what temptations I had in body and
also in mind, and what great fear I had, lest I should transgress the
Commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ. --

In a Letter to the Lord John de Clum. -- I pray you expound to me the dream of
this night. I saw how that in my Church of Bethlem they came to raze all the
Images of Christ, and did put them out. The next day after I arose and saw many
Painters which made more fairer Images, and many more then I had done before,
which thing I was very glad and joyful to behold. And the Painters with much
people about them, said, Let the Bishops and Priests come now, and put out
these Pictures. Which being done, much people seemed to me in Bethlem to
rejoice, and I with them: and I awaking therewith, felt my self to laugh, etc.
--

This Vision the Lord John and Mr. Hus himself in his Book of Epistles ( Ep.
45.) see meth to expound, and applies the Images of Christ to the preaching of
Christ and of his life. The which preaching and doctrine of Christ, though the
Pope and Cardinals should extinguish in him, yet did he foresee and declare,
that the time should come, wherein the same doctrine should be revived again by
others so plenteously, that the Pope with all his power should not be able to
prevail against it.

In the Forty eight Epistle, Pa. 830.
seeming to speak with the same Spirit of Prophecy, he has these words; But I
trust those things, which I have spoken within the House, hereafter shall be
preached upon the top of the House.

In a certain Treatise also by him written, De Sacerdotum and Monachorum
carnaliuns abominatione; speaking Prophetically of the reformation of the
Church, he has these words; Moreover hereupon note and mark by the way, that
the Church of God cannot be reduced to its former dignity, or be reformed
before all things first be made new. The truth whereof is plain by the Temple
of Solomon. -- As my mind now gives me, I believe that there shall arise a new
people, formed after the new man, which is created after God: of the which
people new Clerks and Priests shall come and be taken, which all shall hate
covetousness, and the glory of this life, hastening to an heavenly conversation.

All these things shall come to pass, and be brought by little and little in
order of times, dispensed of God for the same purpose: and this God does and
will do for his own goodness and mercy, and for the riches of his great
longanimity and patience, giving time and space of repentance to them, that
have long lain in their sins, to amend, and fly from the face of the Lords
fury, whilst in the mean time the carnal people, and carnal Priests
successively shall fall away and be consumed as with the moth, etc.

In another Letter. -- You know how I have detested the avarice and inordinate
life of the Clergy; wherefore, through the grace of God, I suffer now
persecution, which shortly shall be consummate in me, neither do I fear to have
my heart poured out for the Name of Christ. Jesus. -- If you shall be called to
any Cure in the Country, let the honor of God and the salvation of souls move
you thereunto, and not the having of the living or Commodities thereof. -- See
that you be a Builder of your Spiritual House, being gentle to the poor, and
humble of mind, and waste not your goods in great fare. I fear if you do not
amend your life, ceasing from your costly and superfluous apparel, lest you
shall be grievously chastised, as I also wretched man shall be punished, which
have used the like, being seduced by custom and evil men, and worldly glory,
whereby I have been wounded against God with the spirit of pride. And because
you have notably known both my preaching and outward conversation, even from my
youth, I have no need to write many things to you, but to desire you for the
mercy of Jesus Christ, that you do not follow me in any such levity and
lightness, which you have seen in me. You know how before my Priesthood (which
grieveth me now) I have delighted oftentimes to play at Chess, and have
neglected my time, and have unhappily provoked both my self and others to anger
by that Play. Wherefore (besides other my innumerable faults) for this I desire
you to invocate the mercy of the Lord, that he will pardon me. --

This Letter to this Minister was not to be opened by him before he was srue of
Mr. Hus his death.

In a Treatise De Sacerdotum, etc. Fox. Vol. 3. page 381.
before mentioned, he has these words, In writing these things, (and what else
I have written before) nothing else has moved me hereunto, but only (...)
love of our Lord Jesus crucified, whose prints an^ stripes (according to the
measure of my weakne^ and vileness,) I covet to bear in my self, beseechin^ him
to give me grace, that I never seek to glo^ in my self, or in any thing else,
but only in (...) Cross, and in the inestimable ignominy of (...) Passion. I
do not therefore doubt but these thing will like all such as unfeignedly love
the Lo^ Christ crucified, and will not mislike not a little all such as be of
Antichrist, durst not have so written unless the Lord Jesus Christ crucified by
h^ inward motion had so commanded me. --

Hyperius. Ward's Living Speeches, etc. page 155,

O what a difference is there (said Martin H^ perius) betwixt this and eternal
fire? Who wo^^ shun this to leap into that?
