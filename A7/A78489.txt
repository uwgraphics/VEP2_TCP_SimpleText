CERTAIN QVERES, And the Resolutions of the Trayned-Bonds, and Citizens of
London, Presented to the Honorable House of COMMONS.
Quere 1. Whether it be for our Liberties, to be contrary to our inherit
Privileges, forced forth to this War, begun and maintained against our wills.

Que. 2. Whether it be for the benefit of this City, or propriety of our
Estates, to have our Purses delusively drained, our Servants destroyed, and our
Trading prohibited.

Que. 3. Whether it be Pious Charity, when through our absolute Necessities, we
are enforced to refuse any of the aforesaid things, to have our poor Wives and
Children turned out of your lines of Communication; and the residue of our poor
Estates Sequestered to your benefit, and the Kingdoms ruin.

Que. 4. Whether it be not very requisite for your selves, or the major part of
you (for whom we are enforced to go) to go along in Person, in this or any
other expedition, we conceiving, A Close Committee of Twenty four to be
sufficient to stay behind to Project, with the help of Master Kilvert.

Que. 5. Whether it be by the Word of God, that you impose Contradictive Oaths,
under gentle terms of Covenants, upon the Consciences of men.

All which we desire you speedily to answer, or else we so all proceed to
this Resolution, Not only to refuse in modesty, for the preservation of your
cracked credit, but oppose, and scorn all your illegal Taxes, and assumed
Commands, we being now sensible, who are the greatest number; Choosing rather
to die like men, then live your Vassalls.
