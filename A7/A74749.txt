A Relation of the victory, which the Sweads have had against the King of
Denmarkes Forces in Jutland, As we have it by Letters of good credit, from
Hamborough, dated, Jan. 16 and 19.
WHat success the Swedes have had in the King of Denmarks Dominions, you have
heard of it heretofore, I must acquaint you now with a further progress they
have made. The Swedish General Major Coningsmarck having quartered for a time
in the Bishopric of Hildesheim, is now drawing with his forces into the
Bishopric of Bremen, the Bishop, who is second son to the King of Denmark,
being fled from Bremerfend to Stoad, the Swedish forces go on in taking one
place after another to Holstein and Iutland, and ^e^^ing all under
contribution, till frost came, ^^^y (...) of the marsh grounds, (...) possessed
themselves thereof, yet was without blows, the peasants in the place called
Wilster, had laid two Sconces upon the passage, which were assaulted by the
Swedish forces, whom they of Gluekstatt, understanding, sent out a Captain with
100 men to assist them, but coming too late, the Swedes being Master of the
first Sconce, the soldiers retired to the other Sconce, to join with them that
kept it, but contrary to expectation, they find that place forsaken by the
peasants, so they in good time shifted for themselves, but were taken short,
their Lieutenant slain: This day also we have news, that the Swedish forces
have made themselves master of Ditmarsh, there being some 150 peasants slain,
300 taken prisoners, and some 200 fouldiers, that did assist them, have taken
service under the Swedes: We have likewise news this day, that the 600 levied
horse of the King of Denmark, which lay in Iutland, having joined with the
Gentry of the Country and Sleswyck being together strong 1600 horse, and four
companies of leavied foot are wholly routed by the Swedes, at a place called
Colding, the chief commander taken prisoner, together with eight captains
more, and 400 slain in the place, in so much that the King of Denmark will
lose now all on this side the Beldt, and Gluekstatt will run now a great
hazard. We We have also news from Sweden by a ship, that came in eight days
from thence to Lubeck, that they have confiscated all Deanish goods in that
Kingdom, and that Gustavus Horn was marchlng with an army of 20000 men into
Schoven, which lies on the other side of Denmark, insomuch that the King of
Denmark will shortly be forced to say farewell Sound, but they that are good
Danish say, that Commissioners of both Kingdoms are to meet the 15 present at
Colmar, to accommodate matters.

A COPY OF A LETTER sent by his Excellency the Swedish General Torstensohn to
General Major Mortagne, bearing date in the head Quarter Middlefart Sconce,
the 14 of Jan. 1644.
MY expedition against the Danish horse, I have communicated unto you in my
last letter, whereupon I presently advanced and sat before the Camp, which
they had pitched here, into which the Danish horsemen had retired, which having
left there behind them their horses went in boats over the water, in the Camp
a considerable number both of leaied soldiers, and of the Peasants was drawn
together, and for three or four days together I caused the Camp fiercely to
he battered with the Cannons, meanwhile the Danish RIX MARSHALL ANERTW BILL
who was then there, betook himself with the Cannons, Colors, chiefest
Officers, and the least part of the Common Soldiers to Mittlefahrt leaving
behind him in the Camp the most part of the Soldiers, together with some
Captains and under Officers: But when this day I advanced with the main
strength of my Forces toward it, and the Forces that lay in the Sconce, saw
the strength of my Forces, they threw away their arms, and came running out of
the Camp to meet us, insomuch that the most High God showed us that favor,
that together with a great part of the Horsemen; we took also 4500 foot (amongst
which were a 1000 leavied Soldiers, which took all service under us) without
any loss, only some few were wounded, amongst which was an Ensign but the
Peasants, which were mounted by the Gentry, were stripped by some of our naked
Soldiers, and turned home, some of them freely desired to serve under us;
being now the Danish Forces are here by for the most part ruinated, and this
Country freed and cleared, that by Gods assistance We need not to fear them,
that on this side they will do us any hurt, for which fundamental blovv we
ought to give hearty thanks unto God Almighty, The Regiments are now gone to
their quarters, which I thought to communicate unto you, etc.

FINIS.
