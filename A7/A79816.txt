THE CITY ASS
WAs ever Ass so served as I
Am served, and fitted, but for why
I do not know, unless because
I love my Master and his Cause,
And know his Crib, and do him own,
And other Masters will have none:
Alas and alas my back will burst,
To bear such burdens I Am accursed.
Am I your Ass, or am I not,
Have you my service quite forgot,
Or was I wont for to complain
Of any labor, or of pain:
No, I did bear all quietly,
But now these burdens makes me cry,
Alas and alas, etc.
If I Am your Ass, pray what are you?
If I be none, then take your due:
Are you not fools, to make an Ass
Of me; for so it is come to pass,
The Fool and Ass are met together,
They did wander none knows whether,
Alas and alas, etc.
I bear and carry all that's laid
Upon my back, and more it is said
I must and shall, be it right or wrong,
Great loades upon me they will throng;
Yet must not speak a word at all,
Which if I do they me miscall.
Alas and alas, etc.
And every fool he will me ride,
Although that me he cannot abide:
And one my back and one my tail,
They will get up without all fail:
To be the first they all do strive
And being up, as mad they drive.
Alas and alas, etc.
Ruff riders they be, without care,
So they be up they will not spare
To beat and bounce my back and sides,
With long rould spurs the Fool so rides
That I am gal'd; my sides are sore
That I cannot bear a burden more.
Alas and alas, etc.
Your Ass I have been thrice seven years,
But six of these you still my ears,
Have plucked so often, that naught remains
But very stumpes for all my pains;
And now my tail you seek to have,
To kiss, or else make me your slave.
Alas and alas, etc.
About my neck a halter they
Will put, if I them disobey,
And will go hang me on a tree,
Or else they will imprison me,
And there I shall be like to sterve,
This is the way they use to serve.
Alas and alas, my back will burst,
To bear such burdens I 'm accursed.
And if I would have liberty,
I must compound (or for a Spy
They will me take, and Martial Laws
Shall seize on me about the jaws)
If I but come to see my Mate
From whence I came, oh this is hate.
Alas and alas, etc.
I twenty parts did gentily bear,
And I did tend at you know where
Each day this 6 years, least the dead
Should rise and frighten, as it was sed
Out of their Tombs, such was their fear
Who robbed the dead, lay buried there.
Alas and alas, etc.
Unto the Tower was I led
Near to the place where some a head
Dis lose, and I was in great fear
I should lose mine, if I came there:
But it fell out, that I went in
To watch the Armor kept so clean.
Alas and alas, etc.
To Kenton also they led me,
And Newbury also I did see,
And other places I do think,
Where I did want both meat and drink,
And yet I fasted once a week,
And for my straw I did go seek.
Alas and alas, etc.
From other things I did then part,
Which grieved me much unto the heart,
I plundered was of what I had,
That I their Ass was almost mad;
They not content, did me nickname
In every place, they did me shame.
Alas and alas, etc.
Then was I forced to covenant
Against my Master, and to taunt
My Tutors, all that did me teach,
And other friends I must impeach,
And gave unto my Brethren dear
To recompense them for their gere.
Alas and alas, etc.
Out of my Oats, and Hay, Excise,
They made me pay, or else it is lies,
My nose unto the grind-stone they
Did tie, That for my drink I pay;
Yet I was tame enough before,
But this was done to keep me lower.
Alas and alas, etc.
And I poor Ass they say served Mammon,
Because I loved that called Common,
And then my Book they took away,
And said I should without Book pray:
Then did I falter in my tongue,
Pleading my case, doing them no wrong.
Alas and alas, etc.
Lo what an ass they made of me,
When I did think we should agree:
I did them entertain in love,
And let them in: but how do prove:
My Master he is left behind,
And this is much against my mind.
Alas and alas, etc.
And now I thought I should be free,
And have an asses liberty:
A privilege which does belong,
Unto our charter very strong:
But now I find they change their words.
And use my Armor Guns and Swords.
Alas and alas, etc.
And seeing that its come to pass,
That I Am made their very Ass,
And have no thank for all my pain,
I am resolved once again
To shake it off, and pray good fellows
Do not believe what ere they tell us
Alas and alas my back will burst,
To bear such burdens I Am accursed.
O help I pray and that with speed
For never was there greater need
For me their ass a fool they make
But i will my master not forsake
I Will kick and winch and throw all down
That seeks to hurt my foot or crown
Alas and alas my back will burst,
To bear such burdens I Am accursed.
FINIS.
