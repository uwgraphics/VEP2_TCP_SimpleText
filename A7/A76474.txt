The Royal Conquest, OR, The Happy Success against a Potent Enemy.
As it was Sung in the Prophetess at the Queens Theater.
To a New Playhouse Tune. ^
Licensed according to Order.

1.
LEt the Soldiers rejoice,
With a general Voice,
And the Senate new Honors decree 'em;
Who at his Armies head,
Struck the fell Monster dead,
And so boldly, so boldly, and bravely did fr^e 'em.
2.
To Mars let 'em raise,
And their Emperor's praise,
A Trophy of the Armies own making:
To Maximinian too,
Some Honors are due,
Who joined, who joined in the brave Undertaking.
3.
With Flowers let them strew
The way as they go,
Their Statues with Garlands adorning;
Who from tyrannies night,
Drove the Mists in their sight,
And gave them, and gave them a glorious Morning
4.
Let all Glory and State
On his Royalty wait,
Great William the true Faiths defender;
Wheresoever he goes,
Still he conquers his Foes,
Mighty Cities and Castles to him does surrender.
5.
Let the Catholics frown,
While their Cause tumbles down,
It is not proud France can restore 'em,
Our great Monarch of fame
Will his Enemies tame,
For his army, his army does drive all before 'em.
6.
For they will die ere they will flinch,
Or give back an inch,
But fight under the Noble Banner,
Of that sovereign Lord,
Whose Conquering sword,
Shall crown him, shall crown him with trophies of honor
7.
Boys be Loyal to him,
Fill the bowl to the brim,
Heavens bless him from secret Malice,
Let the sweet trumpets sound,
As the Bumpers go round,
Likewise wish him, lads, wish him, safe home to his Palace.
8.
As he sails to the shore,
Let the loud Cannons roar
Like the Claps of invincible thunder,
Our joys to express,
For his Royal success,
Having filled the whole Kingdom, the Kingdom with wonder.
9.
For the Protestants they,
who in close Prisons lay,
Are Released by his Conquering Power,
when the French bloody Crew
He did rarely subdue,
Who was forced in Confusion to scamper and scowre
10.
Let the bells ring for joy,
While the French we destroy,
And make the poor tories run nimble,
And in time we'll advance
To the Kingdom of France,
where we'll make the proud insolent Tyrant to tremble.
Printed for Charles Bates at the Sun and Bible in Pye-Corner.
