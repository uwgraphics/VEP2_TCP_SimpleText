HIS MAJESTY'S LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE Lord Major, Aldermen, and
Common Council of the City Of LONDON.

London, Printed by Richard Cotes, 1646.

FOR Our Right Trusty AND WELL-BELOVED, THE Lord Major, Aldermen, and
Common Council of Our City of LONDON.
Charles Rex.

RIght Trusty and Well-beloved, We greet you well. Having expressed Our
resolutions to the two Houses of Our Parliament of England, and the Committee
of Estates of Our Parliament of Scotland, to give all just Satisfaction to the
joint desires of both Kingdoms, We have now likewise thought fit to assure the
two chief Cities of both Our Kingdoms, That nothing is more grievous to Us,
than the trouble and distractions of Our People, And that nothing on earth is
more desired by Us, then, that in Religion and Peace, with all the comfortable
Fruits of both, they may henceforth live under Us, in all godliness and
honesty; And this profession We make for no other end, but that you may know
immediately from Our selves, Our integrity and full resolution to comply with
Our Parliaments in every thing for settling Truth and Peace, And our desire, to
have all things speedily concluded, which shall be found requisite for that
end, That Our return to that Our ancient City, may be to the Satisfaction of
Our Parliament, the good liking of you, and all Our good people, and to Our own
greater joy and comfort. We bid you heartily farewell.

From Newcastle the 19 of May, 1646.
FINIS.
