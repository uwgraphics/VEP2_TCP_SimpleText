The Shepherds Lamentation.
To the tune of the plaine-dealing Woman.


COme Shepherds, deck your heads,
no more with bays but willowes
Forsake your downy beds,
and make your ground your pillowes:
And mourn with mo, since crossed
as I, was never no man:
Nor never shepherd lo, lo, lo, lost,
so plain a dealing woman.
All you forsaken woers.
that ever were distressed,
And all you lusty Lovers,
that ever love molested,
Your loss I must condole,
and all together summon,
To mourn for the poor so, so, soul,
of my plain dealing woman:
Fair Venus made her chaste,
and Ceres beauty gave her:
Pan wept when she was lost,
and Satyrs strove to have her:
But oh she was to them
so nice, so coy, that no man,
Could judge but he that knew, knew, knew,
she was plain dealing woman,
For all her pretty parts,
I never enough shall wonder,
She overcame all hearts,
and all hearts made to wonder.
Her breath it is so sweet,
so sweet the like felt no man,
Oh, Shepherds never lo, lo, lost,
so plain a dealing woman.
Her eyes did shine like glass,
to gra^e her comely feature:
Fair Venus she did far surpass,
she was a comely creature.
(...) she wa^ (...) coy,
(...) ever yet was no one:
(...) Cupid that blind bo, bo, boy,
(...) my plain ^^aling Woman.
So beautiful was she,
in favor and in feature:
Her well shapt limbs did show,
she was a comely creature:
What grief was this to me,
judge all true hearted young men^
To have so great a lo, lo, loss,
of my plain dealing woman.
Diana fair and chaste,
on her might well attend,
A Nymph she was at least,
and to Shepherds a great friend:
And oh she was so kind,
as never yet was no one,
A man could hardly fi, fi, find,
so plain a dealing woman.
So courteous eke she was,
I and so kind to all men:
What better pleasure could you wish,
then so plain a dealing woman:
But now alas shoes gone
it makes my heart to pity:
Oh there was never such an o, o, other wench
in Country or in City.
Kind Shepherds all farewell,
since death has me ore taken:
Unto the world pray ^all,
that I am quite forsaken,
And so to all adue,
go forth I pray and summon,
The ^^a^ting crew to mourn for me,
and my plain dealing woman.
Put on your mourning weeds,
and bring the wreath of willow:
Go tell the world I am dead,
and make the ground my pillow.
And ring, ding dong, ding dong,
ding dong, adieu,
Love you no more so so long,
but change each day a new.
Come Shepherds leave your sighing
and wipe away your tears,
And let us fall to piping,
to drive away all cares:
For though that she be gone,
that was so ^aic^ a good one,
Yet once more may we find,
as plain a dealing woman.
FINIS.
The Second Part of the Plain dealing woman.




YE Siluan Nymphs come skip it,
and crown your heads with Myrtle:
Ye fair Ewes come trip it,
on earths imbroydered kirtle.
And O you Driades,
which haunt the coolest Fountains:
Come leave your silken shadie groves,
and sport it in the Mountains.
For lo the Gods obtain it,
that wonders shall possess her*
And Nature did decree it,
when she with life did bless her.
The Queen of Love disdaind not,
fair Phillis for her feature,
For all the world containd not,
so rare a comely creature.
Diana made her chaste,
and Pallas made her witty:
The Goddess Ceres graced
her heart with love and pity.
The Muses did select her,
to grace their learned number:
And Venus did elect her,
the only beauteous wonder.
When Jove beheld her beauty,
his Leda did repent him:
Jove thought that in loves duty,
she only did consent him.
And Phoebus blushed to know it,
that Daphne had abused him,
For lo, her worth did show, that
desertles she refus^d him.
Pan was enamoured on her.
his Sirynx could not please him:
And when he looked upon her,
her very sight did ease him:
The Satyr mournd to miss her,
whom all the world admired:
Siluanus wished to kiss her,
whom greatest Gods desired.
Cupid his Psyche left,
to feed his eyes upon her,
Of Godlike power bereft,
that her he more might honor,
His bow and shafts he gave her,
wherewith she wounds all hearts
So well she does behave her,
like love in all his parts.
I list no more to praise her,
whom heaven and earth admire,
A loftier Muse must raise her,
whose verse can mount up higher:
A golden pen must write it,
dipped in the Muses Fountain,
And they themselves in^ite it,
upon their sacred Mountain.
Then O ye Shepherd Swains,
with garlands deck your bonnets,
And let the Arcadian pla^nes,
ring forth with Lyrick Sonets:
Come tune you rural voices,
to chant her matchless merits,
Whose fair exceeds all beauties,
the spacious world inherits.
FINIS.
