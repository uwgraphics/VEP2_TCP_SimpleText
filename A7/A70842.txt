The Anti-Protestant: OR, Miles against Prance.
Being a Solemn Protestation of Miles Prance, concerning the Murder of Sir
Edmordbury Godfrey, in direct Opposition to a late Protestation made by him on
the same subject.
WHereas by the suggestion of the Devil, worldly Interest, and my own Malice, I
Miles Prance most wickedly devised an horrid Story of the Murder of Sir
Edmondbury Godfrey, wherein (being beforehand secured both of His Majesty's
Pardon for the pretended Crime, and of reward for the Discovery,) I feigned my
self a Party, the better to gain Credit to my damnable Forgery. Now I the said
Miles Prance, do with unspeakable grief (though yet not without a firm belief
of forgiveness from Almighty God upon sincere repentance) hereby in the
Presence of the All-seeing and Heart-searching God, and of all Holy Angels and
good Men, solemnly and unfeigned avow and declare on my Salvation, That
whatever I deposed upon Oath, relating either to my own Knowledge and
Concurrence in the said Murder, or to any other Person or circumstance touching
the same; was wholly false, and the mere groundless product of my own Devilish
invention.

For all which my detestable wickedness I crave with a Repentant Heart, (the
Mercy of God) Pardon of the King, and forgiveness of those whom by my Hellish
Malice I have so hainously and unjustly accused.

The Substance of this Solemn Protestation as it is here set down, was made,
first before Captain Richardson Keeper of Newgate; And the next day, before His
Sacred Majesty at the Council Board, by MILES PRANCE.
