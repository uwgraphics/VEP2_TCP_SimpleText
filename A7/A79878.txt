To the Critical Censurer.
IF serious matter will not please thee, either
Naked or dressed in a simple rhyme:
I Will never wear in my Cap a Peacocks Feather,
That thou may call me witty or sublime.
To the Sober and Serious Reader.
IF in a little Map thou do desire
To see the use of Holy Scriptures hinted,
Read this and welcome; for I aim no higher:
For thee (although it was not Penned, yet) it was Printed.
To the Reader.
Christian Reader,
THE industry of man has contracted the whole Bible into so small a Volume,
that every one may make it their Pocket-Companion; that thou also may by thy
Industry make it thy Heart-Companion, I do not wish it more contracted, but thy
heart more enlarged. That which others make their Manual, do thou take for thy
Cordial; That which others read, do thou believe: That which others discourse
upon, do thou live upon; And let that which lies by others in their houses,
dwell richly in thy heart; Would thou have me commend this Word of God to
thee? I cannot as it deserves: Read it frequently, Love it ardently, and Live
by it continually, and it will sufficiently commend it self to thee, yet I have
endeavored in some measure to set forth the Beauty, Usefulness, Excellency and
Perfections of it in this ensuing Meditation.

By thy Word's Art
Hid in my Heart,
Both Battle and Reward I win. Psa. 19.11. and 119, 11.

Cannot I through weakness walk alone?
Thy Word, Lord, is
Strength to my knees,

With food which evermore abides.
Bless God (my Soul) that thus has given
Strength, light, guide, way,
Lest thou should stray
In this thy Pilgrimage to Heaven.
This Book, these Sentences, these Lines
Each Word and Letter
To me are better,
Then Chains of Pearl and Golden Mines.
It Is Heaven transcribed and Glory penned:
God's mind no doubt
Was copied out

purposes be such to thy Soul, as it is here set forth and described, or rather,
as it is in its self, viz. The power of God to the Salvation of Souls;
which is the hearty Prayer of, Thine in the Lord, JOHN CLARK.
