A BACK-BLOW TO Major Huntington, FOR His Treacherous accusation OF Lieutenant
General Cromwell, and Commissary Genesis IRETON.
Published for general satisfaction of all, who have unadvisedly received the
malicieus accusation against those active Gentlemen.
THat no man might be mistaken in judging what principles bear rule in this
Major; in the first lines of his discourse, he fully demonstrats himself to be
for the King, being no whit ashamed to avouch, (that which now all good men
blush at, to remember) that he took up Arms, in defense of the authority and
power of King -- and Parliament: which he receipts, as rejoicing this misterious
doubtful and ensnaring conjunction should be minded, rather then the just
disjoyning of them in the now Lord Genesis Commission; and is a mark that fails
not to tell you, that he is absolutely the Kings, as all others are, who use it
in these knowing times; most of them being as much in their hearts for the
King, as him self was in words for the Parliament, which he never failed in
all his writings to proclaim, but in deeds, this Major and his Majesty will
prove both alike to Parliaments.

And however he pretends him self tied both in duty and conscience, (under the
notion of rendering his true reasons of quitting his employment in the Army) to
accuse Lieutenant General Cromwell, and Commissary General Jreton, yet the
whole scope of his Narrative will manifest, that most officiously he does it,
in pursuance of the Kings service, as being hopeful thereby to work divisions
in the Army, and so because he has failed to make it wholly useful to him
(which he ever aimed at) yet possibly now by new distempers to make it useles
to it self, or if he failed thereof, yet to work new jealousies and quarells
betwixt the Parliament and the Army, either of wihich could not but be more
advantageous to the King, then any thing he could do for him in holding his
employment, and which is in deed the true cause wherefore he left it.

And for which the King is highly beholding to him; for to do him this special
piece of service, he has laid himself open to all the world, to be the most
(...) and perfidious dissembler that this age has known, and therefore though
he fail of his purpose, and that the service intended, be likely to prove a
dis-service, yet it were a great pity, that to officious a Traitor, should not
receive a Traitors reward from one hand or other; in the mean time, this is his
portion, he will be to himself like Cain, possessing a Conscience only to
torment him, all that have any thing of Christianity or humanity in them will
abhor him, nor is he likely to have a speeedy end of his vexation, but by a
Judas course: for he has endeavored to bring to destruction his most intimate
familiar friends, not for doing the things he says they did, but because all
those things were steered to an honester end then he intended.

And hence it is, he now complains to the Parliament, that he has left the
Army, because the principles, designs and actions of those Officers, which
have a great influence upon the Army, are (as he conceives) very repugnant to
the honor and safety of the Parliament and King -- dum, from whom they derive
their authority.

Having thus spoken, he thinks he is safe enough, from being suspected to be
for the King, and therefore as a most tender conscienced and well-affected
Major, he boldly proceeds and charges these Gentlemen, the Lieutenant Gen, and
Commissary General; with breach of Parliamentary trust committed to them at
Walden, that instead of reducing the Army to the obedience of Parliament, they
not only discountenanced those that were obedient, but encouraged the
disobedient, declaring that there had been lately much cruelty and injustice in
the Parliaments proceedings against the Army, that Commissary General Ireton
there framed the papers and writings sent thence to the Parliament, That
Lieutenant General Cromwell said, they were in a double capacity, etc.

Then, that at Triple Heath, they instructed the Soldiers to cry justice,
justice, -- then that they without allowance of Parliament, or knowledge of the
General, contrived and setcht the King from Holmby, that they animated the
private Soldiers and Agitators therein, and in securing the Garrison of Oxford,
and the Ammunition there, -- shows the Generals distike of removing the King,
and that the Lieutenant Gen, said, that if it had not been done, the King would
have been setcht away by order of Parliament, or conveyed away by Col. Graves
to London, etc. That Cornet Joyce affirmed that the Lieutenant General ordered
him at London to do that he did.

This is the substance of the first part of his accusation of these Gentlemen,
-- in justification of whom there needs no more but this; its known the
Parliament was so unhappy as to be steered by some politic men into a course,
directly opposite to the interest and freedom of the Commonwealth, daily
vexing and molesting conscientious people for nonconformity conformity to
Presbyterian Government, examining them ex officio, imprisoning them during
pleasure, and animated the City in their corrupt Remonstrance; by which all men
were excluded from office (military or other) that submitted not to the
Presbytery.

And when redress of these grievances was sought for from Parliament, the
influence of those Politicians was so great, that the Petitions of all the
honest parties grieved, were sentenced to be burnt by the common Hangman:
Whosoever accused any of these domineering men, was in danger to be crushed; as
Mr. Guerdon a Member of the House was, for appearing against Col. Hollis, about
his soliciting the King to come to London; some being imprisoned for appearing
therein.

Its known what libellous books, and scandalous sermons were published,
licenced and preached continually against the Army, and that diverse Soldiers
were then hanged, and some otherwise punished at Assizes and Sessions for doing
faithful and needful service to the Parliament, according to their Orders and
Ordinances: and whilst things were in this dangerous posture, and the Major
part of the Parliament wrought into this evil constitution, occasion is taken
to vote the disbanding of the Army, under pretense of service for Ireland.

Now its well known, that in all these evil times and declination of the House
of Commons from their first principles and practices, there was a considerable
number of the Members that opposed those time-serving men very boldly and
courageously, their debates were high and publicly known, both to the Army,
and all over the Land, and the worser party seldom carried any thing, but the
House was forced to divide, so that matters of the highest nature were carried
sometimes by six, and other times by three voices only.

In all which time, none were more openly opposite to whatsoever was illegal
or destructive to freedom, then the Lieutenant Genesis and Commissary Genesis so as
their judgments were fully known; and if they had not declared themselves, yet
if any had but put or imagined themselves in their cases, they might easily
have judged, with what safety to themselves, they could have consented to the
disbanding of the Army, when no sooner it had been done, but their much sought
for lives, had lain at the cruel mercy of their most wicked and malicious
adversaries, one of them having been more then threatened by a chief of the
faction.

Nevertheless, to entangle them thoroughly, and either necessitate them to
disobey the Parliament, or destroy themselves and all that any wise adhered to
them, who but the Lieut. General, and Commissary General, are appointed by
Order of Parliament to disband the Army?

In this case now, if they gave heed to the dictats of their own consciences,
rather then to that destructive Order of Parliament; have they not the Law of
nature, the proceedings of this Parliament against the King, and the Scots
first coming into this Kingdom, to justify the preservation of themselves, the
whole Army and their friends; had they not been Traitors to all these, and to
justice it self, if they had obeyed Commands so destructive?

And it must in conclusion be a received truth by all, that if any authority,
yea if Parliaments shall turn tyrants, even Parliaments themselves must and
ought to be resisted, otherwise what tie is there upon the supreme authority?

But this subject is so rationally and fully cleared in the Armies Declaration
of the 14. of June 1647, that it is needles here to infist upon, nor was Major
Huntington a protester against that Declaration; then it seems, he was well
pleased to see the Army and Parliament at so great a difference, as hoping in
time by that means, to make some fair advantage for the King his Master.

And what now does all this large accusation amount to? but that those who so
cunningly sought to entangle these Gentlemen, that which way soever they took,
they should be ruined, was by their wisdom circumvented, and the evil intended
fell on their own heads, as (doubtless) this evil will fall upon this Majors
head one time or other; and had he been but as wise as he is officious, their
ill success in their unjust attempts, might have sufficed for a fair warning
to him.

As for his singling out these two Gentlemen about removing the King, or any
thing else in his accusation, his malicious end may be easily perceived, these
having prevailed most against the King when he was at strongest, and through
them it is no less discernable, that he strickes at the General himself,
though in the narrative of this accusation, he would seem to exclude him; every
man knowing it, as unexcusable to hold, as to remove without or against Order,
they being all from head to foot, even the whole Army alike engaged.

And it had been an extreme weakness in them, to have hazarded the King out of
their own custody, perceiving the earnest desirs of their numerous and
malicious adversaries, to make use of him to the Armies ruin; all this wind
shakes not, and the Major might have spared his unsavory breath in blowing this
coal a fresh; all that he has said hitherto, being far better known to be
owned by the whole Army, then he can express, whereof he thought himself no
small one, putting himself forward, that so he might have opportunity to lead
to his own, and the King his Masters ends.

In the next place, the Lieut. General is charged to make it his business to
Court his Majesty, both by Members of the Army, (whereof this officious Major
was one) and several Gentlemen formerly in the Kings service, into a good
opinion of the proceedings of the Army, which then were really good and
justifiable; as also into a disaffection to, and dislike of the proceedings of
Parliament, (which then were really evil and destructive though not to the
Kings designs, which caused him so often to allege as this Major says) that
the power by which they fought, was the power of Parliament, it seems that
power was then used more for the Kings ends then every one knew, though well
known to the King, and now seasonablie remembered by this his Major, though to
little purpose.

For what follows? why that the Lieut. General promised, that the Army would
be for the King, in what, In doing injury to any? No, but in the settlement of
his whole business, What was that? Read but their Declaration of the 14. of
June 1647. and it will appear to be a work so heedfully proposed, as to the
freedom and security of the people, that the Lieut. General and his son
Ireton need never to be ashamed for that; And for what did he so work the King
(Major) and so promise him; Upon what condition? -- but that the King and his
party would sit still and not declare against the Aymy, but give them leave
only to manage the present business in hand.

Now what is it that troubles this Major in all this? Is it because these
gentlemen were so kind to the King? No, but that they have not been so
careless of themselves, as to give him opportunity to destroy them; for they
soon found that the King could better digest any principles, then those of
Independencie, and that they had good reason to awaite upon his wings, and to
keep good guards upon him, as perceiveing well where he had a mind to be; and
though the Major be pleased to make this a piece of a charge against them yet
had it been his own case, (and he honestly minded) he would have done no
less, nor would he have been diverted from so necessary a care, with the bigg
words or high looks of any.

But then he says the Parliament complied with the Army, after which the King
inclined to hearken unto the Armies desires, and not before; so it appears as
then the Parliament was his pilot, though as to the people, it had steered a
very dangerous course, but neither King nor Parliament can err in this Majors
divinity, his part it seems, is to charge only the Lieutenant Genesis and
Commissary Genesis and he is resolved to be true (as long as he can or gets by it)
against them, or till the King put him upon some other part or design.

Then he charge them, that at Caversham, the King was continually solicited
by Messengers from Lieutenant Genesis Cromwell, and Commissary Genesis Ireton,
proferring any thing his Majesty should desire, as Revennes, how much, he
says not, and such might be meant, as might not be prejudicial to any? next
Chaplains; and if the state were wise, what hurt could they do? Then wife
Children, Servants of his own, visitation of friends, access of letters, all
these were not evils essentially, and were proffered only upon condition of the
quietness of himself and his party, which doubtless they resolved to see
performed.

But then (which troubles the Major most of all) the King he says was further
promised by Commissary Genesis Ireton, that his negative voice should not be
meddled withal; and believe it, this is matter for any honest true hearted
Englishman to be troubled at* yea, he goes on saying, the Commissary General
should tell his Majesty, that he had convinced those that reasoned against it,
in the general Council of the Army; and all this they would do, that his
Majesty might the better see into all our actions, and know our principles,
which lead us to give him all those things out of conscience.

For that we were not a people hateing his Majesty's person or monarchical
government, but that we liked it as the best, (and that by this King) saying
also, that they did hold it a very unreasonable thing for the Parliament to
abridge him of them: often promising, that if the King would sit still, and not
act against them, they would in the first place, restore him to all these, and
upon the settlement of our own just rights and liberties, make him the most
glorious Prince in Christendom.

Here indeed, was too much comprised by the negative voice at the least, and
some contradiction too; for how could just rights and liberties consist with a
negative voice, or how could he be made the most glorious Prince, that should
be allowed so black a spot of tyranny, as is a negative voice, and which
therefore would enforce a belief, that the Major was mistaken, and reported
this story rather as he would have is then truly? but admit all be true, (which
will never be believed by those, who from much intimacy have had discourses of
a quite contrary nature from those Gentlemen) yet thus much may be said in
their behalf, that at this time the King made use of the present distempers in
London, and stood very high upon his points, and could not otherwise be drawn
to decline the party opposing the army, but upon such promises and workings, as
their too much fear of his party wrought from them, rather then any desire to
be officious unto him, in things so opposite to liberty and their own
judgments; doubtless they were full of care, and in great perplexity, having
begun so high an enterprise, that the like had not been in man's memory.

And its evident, the condition of his sitting still was all in all in these
promises, without which the King would not be satisfied; so if an error, it was
for peace sake, not for their own ends, but for public quietness -- But why is
the Major now troubled about these things, except because they are not
performed? he (it seems) has done nothing else but dissembled all this time,
for the basest of ends ambition and covetousness, even to betray his own
native liberties, and the just freedoms of the whole Nation.

And what if at the same time, all on the Kings part, was done only to amuse
them, and in time to be discovered to their disparagment, how if at that
instant or before, a Commisson were conveyed to Colonel Massy, how if the
King had before laid those Scots Eggs that now are hatched, and the King was
resolved to cast him self any way* rather then on the Independent interest, as
being incompatible with his, and that there was never any realitie on his part
toward them, what then Major? As for any offense this might be against the
Parliament, in the Parliaments sense, all they did was offense: so that all
this is only thus much, the King was (not so simple as he has been deemed, but
rather) too subtle for them in this state work, and not much neither, all
things reehoned.

And touching all the businesses which he receiteth about the proposalls, they
are but things of the same nature, for all that endeavored by these Gentlemen
thereby, was to keep the King and his party quiet, and all that he intended,
was first or last to divide, disparage, and weaken them by disputes and
debates, about pleasing him in those proposalls, and accordingly it soon took
effect, though not so much as was expected; but it had been greater and more
dangerous, if the Londoners had not been so for ward in their violent courses
against the Parliament, thereby putting the army upon speedy marches unexpected
returning, and urgent employment to pacify that tumult, which united them
beyond imagination: yet what by those disputes, and the diligence of the Kings
agents continually about the head quarters, it was verily expected, that at
Honnslow-heath, a very great part of the Army would have declared for the King.

As for all the rest of the Majors Narrative, to that at Colebrook, comes to no
more but this, the King saw his party in London was not able to compass any
design, they were so divided within themselves, and that therefore it was in
vain, to make those his enemies who had him in custody, and that the best
course he could then take, in pursuance of his intentions, was to seem wholly
theirs, upon such cunning terms, as in time would be like bones cast amongst
them.

They on the other side, perceiving all this crafty dealing, were yet forced to
hold fair with him, because his party might otherwise take fire, upon the
least distaste taken by him, which at that time might have much prejudiced
them, though done him little good; for he was wholly ordered by the Scots
counsel, who were then altogether unprovided, and resolved not to stir, till
the Army should fall into distempers; which as the King and his politic party
handled the matter, they knew would certainly be, upon their first freedom from
a visible adversary; as indeed it came to pass.

So that all the business about the proposalls, comes to this, that they were
used by these Gentlemen as a means to keep the King from stirring, and their
error was, in believing those could have done it: for the King did but seem to
regard the proposalls in all he did, but (in his heart) abhorred to come in
upon any such rearms, neither upon the Armies or Parliaments interest, as
resolving rather still to hazard all, then to have any bars or bonds upon
him, but such as he can break a sunder, or shake off at pleasure.

And therefore the whole series and carriage of this business, proves no other
but as a dream, the Lieut. General and Commis: Genesis were indeed over careful
to keep him quiet, that could not have been troublesome then, but to his own
ruin, nor did any thing make more for the Kings advantage, then his long
insisting, altering and tampering upon the Armies Proposalls, and Absolon-like,
holding discourses and intimacy with the Officers and Soldiers, to insinuate
himself in their favors, and steal away their hearts, chiefly in pretending
to cast himself wholly upon the Army.

By all which fraudulent means, jealousies were daily bread, with emulations
and divisions to purpose, which their present prevalencies and success, in
obtaining so ready a passage to and through the City, made the Lieut. Genesis
Commis. Genesis and others too much to slight and neglect, by which means, those
divisions so increased and grew to such a head, that although they were quit of
their fears from London, yet greater and more dangerous distractions remained
amongst themselves, as witness their Counsels at Kingston and Putney: which
also bread so great a discontent between the general Officers and Adjutators,
that the Officers knew not which way to resolve upon for their own security.

All which distractions were not a little fomented by Bartley Ashburnham,
Beswell and others the Kings instruments, with the chief Officers had most
correspondency, to the further dislike and complaint of the Adjutators, so that
heats were daily struck between them; all which made for the Kings design, who
as their differences increased, he ministers more and more occasions, keeps
(as it were) open house at Hampton Court, resolves and gives out, that he will
not depart thence, except to London, invites and intertains thousands both of
City and Country to visit him, ingratiates himself openly with Londoners,
Soldiers, and all resorters; and thus in effect, he becomes Master of his
Masters; nor could those who gave him this liberty to their own prejudice, now
restrain him, but to their greater prejudice: for at this time, his party began
a fresh, and (as if by direction) to take such heart, that his interest is not
only the most frequent discourse at head quarters, but openly maintained in all
companies, and what course then to hinder it appeated not.

Which intricat businesses thus occurring, made the Army not only to deal so
gently with their unjust opposers in Parliament, as finding the King upon their
divisions, was grown somewhat formidable to them, but to alter their purposes
so often about purging the House; for they having been loosers by their
gentleness to the King, were loath to hazard the making so great a party their
desperate enemies.

For now their work was made extreme difficult, the scean or face of things was
wholly changed, the grievances and cause of the people, which they had espoused
and undertaken, was quite laid aside, to the great grief of the Adjutators,
and all men who had affixed so great hopes on them, and they were forced to
take new Councels merely to preserve themselves.

So that all this Majors Narrative of what one said and did at one time, and
what another did or said at another time, either to the King or from him, or
concerning the Parliament, or any of the Members or Votes, comes all to
nothing, because necessity makes them so, against which there is no plea; but
all that can be said may be summed up in this total, the King was too sutle
for them in the art of King-crast, and their dear-bought experience (no doubt)
will warn them from dealing any more with him at that weapon, having another
so just, so tried a one, as yet in their own hands.

Yet as skillful as he was, they foiled him shrewdly at his own weapon in
getting him so suddenly into the Isle of Wight.

It seems, by so long practice with him they found, that he lay most open to
fear, and no marvel, having so guilty a conscience, so that although the
busslings of Martin, Rainsborrouh and the new commotions of the new Agents, put
them to much care and trouble, yet they made a seasonable use thereof, to
affright his Majesty out of his hold at Hampton Court, and from his more
advantageous resolution of coming to London, where he was daily and hourly by
his friends expected, by which so timely and needful an act, they secured both
themselves and the Agents party from such a danger, as would have put them into
new motions and further divisions: And though the business of the Agents ended
not without further trouble, yet was this conveyance of the King from Hampton
Court, the first and principal means that made way for union in the Army;
which that it proved so, seems to be this Majors extreme trouble and vexation.

For what is the cause of all these his stories? but by his renueing the memory
of all miscarriages, differences, jealousies, unkindnesses, weaknesses,
affronts, quarrels, slanders, arts, policies and the like, where with these
shattered times did most unhappily abound, to east them all again into new
divisions and distempers, which is still his Masters work, and without which he
sees (not withstanding all risings, revoltings and the Scots to boot) he is
not likely to prevail: and this most base and vile end, this unworthy Major
most labors with all his might, not only by lies, but by some truths more
maliciously used then lies, to compass his ungodly design.

But for all his mischievous have, he comes too lare, the burnt children are
sufficiently warned, no Tutor being so powerful as experience; the Officers
and Soldiers have learned at dear rates, to shun a Courtier as they would do a
Leaper, or as a penitent man would shun the tempter: so that old things are
past away, and all are become new.

The parliament and the Army are friends, and the Army are at unity within
themselves, all minding and intending the publik good and common freedom of the
Nation, all jarres and scarres are healed, all are hearty true and real
Friends, no by-names nor scandalous distinctions are mentioned amongst them; so
united are they in affection, though far distant in their present employment,
that whereas this Major thinks by this his treachery to divide them, or at
least to expose these Gentlemen, the Lieut. General, and Com. General to the
condemnation of the Army, and thereby to render them useless in these
dangerous times, when their experienced abilities are so much needed, and
possibly also to expose their lives to danger, as a sacrifice more pleasing to
his Master, then that of Sr. John Hotham his first, as these his greatest
opposers. -- all works the contrary, their present actions, fidelity,
magnanimity and ingenuous frequent acknowledgment of unadvised trusts to men of
corrupt principles, and their admitting into their hearts too great estimation
of the King and his parties power, contrary to that wonderful experience of
Gods mighty power and providence, which so mightily went forth and alongs with
them and their Armies, together with their great respect manifested to men of
integrity, though formerly at some distance, and their dislike of flatterers
and timeservers; This, this sincerity in them, has so renewed the affections
of the whole Army to them, that a hair of their heads (whilst they so
continue,) is not be touched, and the evil this unworthy Major intends against
them, turns to their advantage, yea and for any good he has herein done for
the King his Master, he had as good played the last Act of Achitophell, then
thus to have either acted, or Councelled or spoken against those gentlemen,
whereby he is become hateful to himself and friends, and useles to all parties.

Thus much may suffice, in reference to their actions and designs, somewhat is
yet necessary to be spoken, concerning their principles.

As first, he charges them to hold that every fingle man is judge of just and
right, as to the good or ill of a Kingdom. Put case now Major, the Parliament
(of whose honor you would be thought to be so tender) should Command you to
take up Arms and kill and slay such a man, or sort of men, admit your judgment
and conscience tells you, those men have done no wrong, or that those things
are just and good, for which the Parliament commands you to kill and slay them:
who is judge in this case? Are not you a murderer if you obey them? Who is
Judge if you obey them nor? Certainly, this principle would not have offended
you, had not your conscience been stifled with ambition and mercinary gain.

Their second principle he says is, that the interest of honest men is the
interest of the Kingdom, and the truth is, the interest of honest men is an
honest interest, and if the Kingdoms interest has not been so, or is not so,
yet that it ought to be so, who will gainsay? nor is an honest interest so hard
to be discerned in these discoursive and experimental times: But the
Lieutenant Gen might be confident, that those only were honest, who were
conformable to his judgment; for who thinks him not able to judge of public
right? Believe it, those that thoroughly know him, do testify his ability
sufficiently: And as for his engageing of Col. Rains borough; its well known
that Rainsborough is mettle past bowing or warping, and its an Argument, the
Lieut. Generals interest was certainly just, when Col. Rainsborough would
promise conformity to him and the Com: General.

Their third principle he says is, that it is lawful to pass through any
forms of Government, for the accomplishing of his ends; now its known, his
ends always proposed have been public freedom and safety, and who in these
knowing times is so ignorant, as to deny so undoubted a truth? Are not all
forms of Government appointed to those ends? Now, if any Government shall
become so far degenerate, as to neglect or betray the just liberty and due
safety of the people, does it not utterly expire in it self, and cease to be
any more a Government, but rather a mere confusion.

Is not Salus populi, suprema lex? Or is any form, Government, Argument, Law,
objection, or exception to be pleaded against the freedom and safety of the
people? No certainly: so that this principle being rightly applied and well
under stood, is so far from disparaging these Gentlemen, that nothing could be
an occasion of their greater honor, then that it may be recorded and related
to all posterities, the whole course of their actions manifested, this was
their undoubted principle.

Their 4 and last principle, he says is, that its lawful to play the knave
with a knave, such a phrase of speech any of them might occasionally express,
as being a common saying, but that they meant as he would have them understood,
appears not, it being generally taken in a more tolerable sense, as to
deceive the deceiver, which is excused by Hushies policy, in destroying the
corrupt Council of Achitophell.

But wise and good men may sometimes be more apt (in way of discourse) to speak
of such a thing, then at any time to practice it; and no doubt, but foresight
and resolution prevents the need of it, the success thereof seldom answering
the expectation, one evil, (yea the least) seldom escaping without producing
another; and so also it comes to pass, with those that make use of a K. to
catch a K. as may be seen by their using of this Major in all they employed
him; which may be a sufficient warning for them henceforth, to take heed what
sort of men they trust, there being hardly any vain glorious flattering or
covetous men employed by them, but one way or other they are prejudiced and
disparaged by them.

And though this treacherous Major (for a conclusion to his accusation) would
induce all men to believe, that if these Gentlemen thus principled shall
prevail by the Army, they intend to destroy the power and authority of
Parliament; (for which he says he engaged, believe him those that can) yet if
their demeanor toward the Parliament in general upon their late success,
and their gentle bearing toward their greatest opposers, from whom not one
drop of blood, nor one penny of money has been drawn nor taken, they all being
out of trouble, imprisonment, exile and fear, and so in all probability may
still continue, except they make to themselves new occasions, by contrivances
and Personal Treaties.

If these and the like carriages and inclinations in them, be duly weighed, it
will be impossible for any construction to be made, but that most earnestly they
desire to see the Commonwealth restored to a certain condition of just and
true freedom, safety and peace by this Parliament, according to the trust
reposed in them, and would rejoice that it might neither be deferred, nor done
to halves nor parcels, which (as all men see) does cause new and perpetual
troubles.

And these their just desires and resolutions being perceived by this Malignant
Major, has caused him at this time to appear in his colors, to acquit his
command, and to fall upon this course, to put the Parliament, Army and Kingdom
into further distempers, and there by to render them more incapable of making
opposition either against the Scots or other foreign forces or intestine
enemies, which have risen up in so many places for the King his Master, against
the Parliament and Army.

But it avails nothing, God is merciful, has fetched them home by
repentance, made them to see and be sencible of their errors, passes ever
their many failings and infirmities, remains with them still, blessing them
with success upon success even to admiration: and doubtless will continue so to
do, if yet they shall vigorously set themselves to do his work, in suppressing
all kinds of tyranny and oppression in whomsoever, and in clearing and securing
the liberty, peace and safety of the people, according to their many promises
and engagments, and for which just ends, God has raised, prospered and
preserved them, -- but let them henceforth beware of showing respect to persons
in judgment, and of that curse which certainly attends all those that do the
work of the Lord negligently.

FINIS.
