HIS MAJESTY'S Declaration to his loving Subjects of his Kingdom of SCOTLAND.
AS there has been no means left unattempted by some seditious persons, which
the malice and wit of rebellion could devise, to infect and poison the
affections and loyalty of our good Subjects of our Kingdom of England, and to
withdraw their hearts from us, by the most pernicious and desperate calumnies
that could be invented, to under-value and lessen Our reputation with Foreign
Princes, by injuries and affronts upon their public Ministers, and by
procuring Agents to be sent, qualified for negotiation, without Our consent;
and thus to expose Us and Our Regal Authority to scorn and contempt, by
assuming a power over Us: So these pernicious contrivers of these bloody
distempers, have not delighted in any art more, then in that by which they have
hoped to stir up Our good Subjects of that Our Native Kingdom of Scotland to
join with them, and to infuse into them a jealousy and dis-esteem of Our true
affection, and Our gracious intentions toward that Nation. To this purpose
they have used great industry to convey into that Our Kingdom, and to scatter
and disperse their diverse seditious pamphlets, framed and contrived against
Our Person and Government, and have procured Agents to be sent to reside there,
and to promote their designs. One of which lately resident there, one
Pickering, These are Pickerings informations, which We hope ^re ^^lse.
by his Letters of the 9. of January, from Edinburgh to Master Pym, assures him
of the concurrence of that Kingdom, and that the Ministers in the pulpits do
in downright terms press the taking up of Arms. And in another of his
Letters of the same date, to Sir John Clatworthy, worthy, he says, That the
trumpets sounded to the Battle, and all cried, Arm, arm. With many other
bold, scandalous, and seditious passages, very derogatorie from that duty and
affection which We are most confident Our good Subjects of that Our Native
Kingdom bear unto Us. To this purpose they traduce Us with the raising and
making of War against Our Parliament; of having an Army of Papists, and
favoring that Religion; of endeavoring to take away the liberty and
property of Our Subjects. And upon these grounds they have procured a public
Declaration, to invite Our good Subjects of that Our Kingdom of Scotland, to
join with them, and to take up Arms against Us their natural Liege Lord.
Lastly, to this purpose they endeavor as well in public, as by secret sly
insinuation, to beget an apprehension in them, That if we prevail so far
here, as by the blessing of God, to preserve Our Self from the ruin they have
designed to Us, that the same will have a dangerous influence upon that Our
Kingdom of Scotland, and the Peace established there; and that the good Laws
lately consented to by Us, for the happiness and welfare of that our Native
Kingdom, will be no longer observed and maintained by Us, then the same
necessity which they say extorted them from Us, hangs upon Us; but that We will
turn all Our Forces against them: A calumny so groundlesly and impiously
raised, that if We are in any degree conscious to Our Self of such wicked
intentions, We should not only not expect a dutiful sense in that Our Native
Kingdom of Our sufferings, but should think Our Self as unworthy of so great
blessings and eminent protection, as We have received from the hands of the
Almighty, to whom We know We must yield a dear account for any breach of trust,
or failing of Our duty toward Our People.

But as We have taken especial care from time to time to inform Our good
Subjects of that Our Native Kingdom of the Occurrences here, particularly by
Our Declaration of the 12 of August, wherein is a plain clear narration of the
beginning and progress of Our sufferings to that time; So the bold and
unwarrantable proceedings of these seditious persons, have been so public and
visible to the world, that Our good Subjects of Scotland could not but take
notice of them, and have observed, that after we had freely and voluntarily
consented to so many Acts of Parliament, as not only repaired all former
grievances, but also added whatsoever was proposed to Us for the future benefit
and security of Our Subjects, in so much as in truth there wanted nothing to
make the Nation completely happy, but a just sense of their own excellent
condition; a few discontented ambitious and factious persons, so far prevailed
over the weakness of others, that in stead of receiving that return of thanks
and a knowledgment, which we expected and deserved, Our people were poisoned
with seditious and scandalous fears and jealousies concerning Us; We were
encountered with more importunate and unseasonable demands; and at last were
driven by force and tumults, to flee from Our City of London for the safety of
Our life: after which We were still pursued with unheard of insolences and
indignities; and such members of either house, as refused to join in those
unjustifiable resolutions, likewise driven from those Counsels, contrary to the
freedom and liberty of Parliament; in so much as above four parts of five of
that Assembly were likewise forced, and are still kept from thence: Our Forts,
Towns, Ships, and Arms were taken from Us; Our Money, Rents, and Revenue seized
and detained; and that then a powerful and formidable Army was raised and
conducted against Us (a good part of which was raised and mustered before we
had given Our Commissions for raising one man) That all this time we never
denied any one thing that by the law we were required to grant, or asked one
thing but what by the known law was unquestionably Our Own, That we earnestly
pressed and desired a Treaty, that we might but know at what price we might
prevent the miseries and desolation which were threatened; That this was
absolutely and scornfully refused and rejected, and we compelled with the
assistance of such of Our good Subjects as came to Our succor, to make use of
Our defensive Arms for the safety of Our Life, and preservation of Our
Posterity. What has since passed. That battle has been given Us, Our own
Person, and Our Children endeavored to be destroyed, That unheard of pressures
have been exercised upon our poor Subjects, by rapine, plundring and
prisonment, And that confusion which is since brought upon the whole excellent
frame of Government of this Kingdom, is the discourse of Christendom: We are
very far from making a War with or against Our Parliament, of which We Our
Self are an assentiall part; Our principal quarrel is for the Privileges of
Parliament, as well those of the two Houses, as Our own; if a few persons had
not by arts and force first awed, and then driven away the rest, these
differences had never arisen, much less had they ever come to so bloody a
decision.

We have often accused these persons against whom Our quarrel is, and desire
to bring them to no other trial, then what by the Law of the Land they ought
to be tried: And we have been compelled to take up these defensive Arms for the
safety of Our Life, assaulted by rebellious Arms, the defense of the true
Reformed Protestant Religion, scornfully invaded by Brownists, Anabaptists, and
other independent Sectaries (who in truth are the principal Authors and sole
Fomenters of this unnatural civil War) for the maintenance of the liberty
and propriety of the Subject, maliciously violated by a vast unlimited
arbitrarie power, and for the preservation of the rights, dignity and
privileges of Parliament, almost destroyed by tumults and faction. So what
has by violence bin taken from Us, being restored, and the freedom of meeting
in Parliament being secured, We have lately offered (though We have not bin
thought worthy of an Answer) to disband our Army, and leave all differences to
the trial of a full and peaceable convention in Parliament; and We cannot from
Our Soul desire any blessing from Heaven more then We do a peaceable and happy
end of these unnatural distractions. For the malicious groundless aspersion
of Our having an Army of Papists, though in the condition and strait to which
We were brought, no man had reason to wonder, if We received assistance from
any of Our Subjects of what Religion soever, who by the Laws of the Land are
bound to perform all offices of duty and allegiance to Us; yet it is well
known that we took all possible care by Our Proclamations to inhibit any of
that Religion to repair to Us, which was precisely and straightly observed
(notwithstanding even at that time We were traduced, as being attended on by
none but Papists, when there has not in a month together not one Papist been
near Our Court) though great numbers of that Religion have with all alacrity
been entertained in that Rebellious Army against Us, and others have been
endeavored to be seduced, to whom We had formerly denied employment, as
appears by the examination of many prisoners, of whom We have taken twenty and
thirty at a time of one Troup, or Company of that Religion. What Our opinion is
of the Popish Profession, Our often solemn Protestations before Almighty GOD,
who knows Our heart, do manifest to all the World, and what Our practice is in
Religion, is not unknown to Our good, Subjects of that Our Native Kingdom. And
as We have omitted no way Our Conscience and Understanding could suggest to Us,
for the advancing and promoting the true Protestant Religion, having protested
Our readiness in a full and peaceable Convention of Parliament, to consent to
whatsoever shall be proposed to Us by Bill, for the better discovery and
speedier conviction of Recusants, for the education of the Children of Papists
by Protestants in the Protestant Religion, for the prevention of the practices
of Papists against the State, And the due execution of the laws against them:
So We shall further embrace any just Christian means, to suppress Popery in
all Our Dominions: of which inclination and resolution of Ours, that Our Native
Kingdom has received good evidence.

For the other malicious and wicked insinuation, that Our success here upon
the Rebellious Arms raised against Us, to destroy Us, will have an influence
upon Our Kingdom of Scotland, And that We will endeavor to get loose from
these wholesome laws which have been enacted by Us there: We can say no more,
but that Our good Subjects of that Kingdom do well remember with what
Deliberation, Our Self being present at the debates, We consented to these
Acts. And We do assure Our good Subjects there, and call GOD Almighty to
witness, of the uprightness and resolution of Our heart in that point, That
We shall always use Our utmost endeavor to defend and maintain the Rights and
Liberties of that Our Native Kingdom, according to the Laws Civil and
Ecclesiastical, established there, And shall no longer look for obedience,
then We shall govern by the Laws. And We hope, that Our zeal and courage in the
defense only of the Laws and Government of this Kingdom, And for the
subjecting Our self to so great hazard and danger, will be no Argument, that
when that Work is done, We would pass through the same difficulties, to alter
and invade the Constitutions of that Our other Kingdom: We find disadvantages
enough to struggle with, in the defense of the most upright, innocent, just
cause of taking up Arms. And therefore if we wanted the Conscience, We cannot
the discretion to tempt GOD in an unjust Quarrel: the Laws of that Our
Kingdom shall be always sacred unto Us: We shall refuse no hazard to defend
them; but sure We shall run none to invade them.

And therefore We do conjure all Our good Subjects of that Our native Kingdom,
By the long, happy, and uninterrupted Government of Us, and Our Royal
Progenitors over them, By the memory of those many, large, and public
blessings they enjoyed under Our dear Father, By these ample favors and
benefits they have received from Us, By their own solemn National Covenant,
and their obligation of Friendship and Brotherhood with the Kingdom of
England, Not to suffer themselves to be misled or corrupted in their
affections and duty to Us, by the cunning malice and industry of these
seditious persons, and their adherents: but to look upon them as persons who
would involve them in their guilt, and sacrifice the honor, fidelity, and
allegiance of that Our Native Kingdom, to their private end and ambition. And
We require Our good Subjects there, to consider, that the persons who have
contrived, fomented, and do still maintain these bloody distractions, and this
unnatural Civil War, what pretense soever they make of the care of the true
Reformed Protestant Religion, are in truth Brownists and Anabaptists, and other
independent Sectaries. And though they seem to desire an Uniformitie of
Church Government with Our Kingdom of Scotland, do no more intend, and are als
far from allowing the Church Government, by Law established there, or indeed
any Church Government whatsoever, as they are from consenting to the
Episcopal. And We cannot but expect a greater sense of Our sufferings, since
the obligations We have laid upon that Our Native Kingdom, are used as
arguments against Us here: And Our free consenting to some Acts of Grace and
Favor there (which were asked of Us, by reason of Our necessary residence from
thence) has encouraged these ill affected persons, to endeavor by force to
obtain the same here, where We usually reside.

To conclude, We cannot doubt Our good Subjects there, will so far hearken to
the treason and malice of Our enemies, as to interrupt their own present peace
and happiness. And God so deal ^^^h Us and Our Posterity, as We inviolably
observe the Laws and Statutes of that Our Native Kingdom, and the
Protestations We have so often made to this, for the defense of the true
reformed Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and the just Privileges
and Freedom of Parliaments.

FINIS.
