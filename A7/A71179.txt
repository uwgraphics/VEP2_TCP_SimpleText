JOHN TAILOR Being yet unhanged, sends greeting, to JOHN BOOKER That hanged him
lately in a Picture, in a traitorous, slanderous, and foolish London Pamphlet,
called A Cable-Rope double-twisted.

Thou Booker hang'st me pictured in a Boat,
Whereby thou shew'dst thy self the Hangman's Groom,
The Hangman shall hang thee, and men shall note,
That under Tyburne thou shall have a Tomb:
And lousy Ballad-makers Rimes shall sing,
There lies a Rebel, that reviled his King:
Thou hang'st my Picture, but I do foresee,
That (in revenge) the Hangman shall hang thee.
Gallogras Choka Cur dog Weasando Suffocatiorum. Printed in the Year, 1644.

Welfare an old Friend in a corner, but I have found an old corner in a
Friend, that in these hard times has sent me a True Loves Knot made of a
Cable-Rope double-twisted, and withal has most Emphatically, Mathematically,
Aquatically, and Emblematically hanged me in a Boat at London, and after that
(most strangely and transubstantially) he sends me a Rope to Oxford. This is
Booker's Ass-tronomicall Legerdemain, to hang a man first and send him a Rope
afterward, for the which courtesy I will send him a few small Lines, which he
may twist at his leisure, and hang himself after at his pleasure. But this
preludium is silly simple stuff, for though it may be suitable to Booker's
ridiculous Nonsense railing and reviling, yet it neither becomes me to write,
or my Readers to spend time in reading my writings if they were not better
seasoned with salt, poudered with pepper, sharpened with vinegar, and made fit,
and of some acute relish for the pallates of such capacities, as can make a
distinction betwixt A Very Knave, and A merry Knave.

Booker, all the world may perceive the implacability and inveteracy of thy
malice for thou can not be contented, to hang me, but thou persistest so
uncharitably toward me as not only to send me a Rope, but to revile me, with
the learned Titles of Rogue, Prick-lowse, Pagan, Metropolitan Villain, and such
other pretty Sirnames, which he learned from the Fish-wives scoulding College
at Billingsgate, and that he should be loath to foul his fingers to answer any
Pamphlet that comes from Oxford, but that through his sides the honor of a
Parliament is wounded: to which I answer, that Parliament at this time is a
mere Conventicle, or not the shade of a shadow of what it should be, and thou
thy self do manifest the imbecility of it, in that it had no other
fortifications but such rotten paper-walls as thy sides to defend it from the
shot of a Scholars or a Scullars pen; Sirtha, I would have thee know, that we
at Oxford are true Protestant pen-proofe, and the King, Queen, Princes, Peers,
Clergy, University, Army, Magistrates, and Commons, are slander-proofe, so that
neither your rebellious fighting, or reviling writing, can wound, blemish or
sully the Majestique luster of Royalty, in the Sovereign, or the obedient
expression of duty in the Subject.

But thou with thy Consorts, May, Wither, Britannicus, the Scout, the Dove, and
all the Rabble of lying and reviling Rebels, cannot so much as scratch or
touch my reputation, much less can they wound either Aulicus or Naworth, and
least of all can they batter with Elder-guns and paper-bullets either majesty
or loyalty.

Prince Rupert (or Robert) whom your sauciness is pleased to call plain
Rupert, as if his Highness and your Knaveship were all fellows at football,
you are so stupefied in impudence and unmannerly ignorance, that you give that
illustrious Prince, the scandalous, Turkish Titles and Terms of Saladine and
Saracen, with many other such base expressions: I do hold it a great happiness
to that noble Prince, that he has worthily deserved to be feared and admired
by you and all the rest of your rebellious and Traitorous Factions; you have
some reason to be angry with him, because he has so often beaten you,
(although he never did any harm to any honest man, true Subject, or
Protestant; yet such a stinckard as John Booker, Thou, that art a thing, that
out of thy imperious Clerkship to some Justices of Peace, to four or five of
which thou wast a directing Gizzard, under their wing, a vermin made up of the
fag-ends of fellonious cheating, filching, whoring, roguing, man-slaughtering,
and murdering Mittimusses; thy apparel only made of the shreads of Warrants,
thy diet out of the Scraps of roasted Recognizances, and thy whole life an
imitation of Binding over and Withdrawing, this has been thy Trade of old,
thou whilom Vnder-Stewards man to one of the Innes of Court, where thou did
fatten and batten with scraps, rumps and kidneys, and scraping of Trenchers,
and lately a Guild Hall Publican or Toll-gatherer for the maintenance of damned
Rebellion against God and the King.

And this Booker, this Thing, this Nothing, this any thing (except a good
thing) does flirt poison, and with stinking calumnies against the sacred Honor
of Princes, Religion, piety, and humanity, revile the King, Queen, and all that
sincerely love or obey either God or them.

If they were a Parliament, which thou so manifestest, they would show some
fruits of a Parliament, in hanging thee, with all thy Brothers (Knaves and
Libellers) that do make a daily and weekly Trade to vilify their Sovereign,
with the Queen and loyal Nobility. There is a Statute unrepealed yet, that
makes it no less than High Treason, or Treason in the highest degree; and that
Act being still in force, me thinks, should stop your mouth with a hempen
cullisse or Caudle. But your nickname Parliament does not only maintain and
retain a scattered Heard of scribbling Villains, but also they do allow most
respect, favor, countenance and means to him that can lie, rail and slander
most: therefore I conclude, if they were a Parliament, the sacred Name and
Honor of His Majesty should not be suffered to be abused so transcendently
(beyond all presidents) but that they would by Law and Parliamentary Authority
send ye all to Gregory's market, and feed Crows with your traitorous
mischievous Heads, and filthy, treacherous, rebellious, stinking, quartered
carcases: therefore no Parliament.

But do thou and all the rest of the Generation of Vipers cast never so many of
your Traitorous slanders upon his sacred Majesty and his pious sincerity, yet
his Royal and Christian constancy is so firm, that you do all justly deserve
an universal hanging, in not believing and belying his fixed and (never to be
violated) true Protestations, His Majesty is so well grounded in His Religion,
that He is resolved to maintain, defend, live and die in the Protestant Faith,
of which Faith His Father (of blessed Memory) and himself have been Defenders
above forty years, and which Faith you and your Faction have been Defilers
almost four years.

I wish you had the manners to forbear taxing His Majesty with Papistry, till
such time as you know Him to be no Protestant. Indeed He is in mind and body
compacted of such an unyeilding constitution (which your loyalty may call
stubbornness) that He will not bend or bow to your newfound Doctrine, so that
there is no hope that you will ever be able to make a zealous Brownist, or
devout Anabaptist of Him; therefore I advise you to be quiet, and let him be a
Protestant still, for you labor in vain, and it is neither in the power of
you, or the Devil your Master, to alter Him from being constant, pious, just,
merciful, etc.

Thou railest most delicately, against learning and the University, which in
one word or two I will answer with an old said Saw, Art has no enemy but
ignorance, as for the King, Queen, Peers, Clergy, University, Cavaliery,
Infantry, etc. Their own worths and virtues are their vindications, so that I
will not presume to say thou can wound their Honors, either through my weak
sides, or any ways else that thy hellish brain can invent, therefore I Will let
them alone to defend themselves, and turn once more toward thee in mine own
defense.

As when Christopher Columbus (an Italian) first discovered some small part of
the (then unknown) America, Vespusius (a Spaniard) sailing the year after, with
the Chart or Card, Compass, Mappes, and Mariners, that formerly Columbus had
used, the said Vespusius discovered more Land, as the golden Peru, and other
vast Continents, and at his return (being at dinner with Columbus and others)
Vespusius bragged that he had only found out that new and rich World, at which
words the Italian took an Egg in his hand, asking Vespusius, if he could make
the Egg stand on one end upon the Table, to which he answered, he could not do
it, then the other said that he could do it, and presently he put the Eggs end
into the Salt, and it stood upright; then the Spaniard said, that he could do
that trick as well as he, to which the Italian replied, so you could find
America when I have shown you the way. And much like have thou Booker answered
my Book, called [ No Mercurius Aulicus] thou have (like an Ass) yoaked thy
self with my Heifer, for thou have not the wit to plough without her, you play
with your Nody-grammaticall foolery in Anagrammatizing my name, (as John
Tailor, Join Halter) and fillest thy patched Pamphet with questioning and
cavilling, at changing [ o] into [ e] with such skimble scamble, simple,
froathy stuff, as would serve to give a knowing hide-bound Dog a comfortable
stool or two.

But as they are, and the condition they now are in, they have no other way of
supportation, but what proceeds from the black mouths of your zealous,
Atheistical, long-winded Preachers (or Tautologicall prating Lecturers) with
the aid of you and your holy Tribe of accursed Pamphlet mongers; it is you
that with your Spiritual and Temporal damnable Devotions, and infernal
practices, that do uphold the usurped Dignity of that Idol Dagon Senate; it is
you that bring oil to quench the flames of this afflicted Kingdom; it is you
that have bewitched, besotted, and picked the purses of as many as believed
you; it is you (and your instigations) that have raised and defended this
unparallelld and unnatural Rebellion; it is you that (by Innovations in the
Church) have almost made the glorious Protestant Religion invisible, and (to
cover your Villainies) with hypocritical and odious Lies, you charge the King
and his Honorable Counsel with Popery, it is you that defend the New Assembly
in their Synodicall Consultations, in framing and forging a new Alcaron, or a
Talmud; it is you that have made Knaves and Fools believe all this; it is you
that have banished, imprisoned, robbed or murdered as many as would not believe
all this, and my hope is to live to see you hanged for all this.

Therefore it is no marvel if they maintain you, for you are the only props
that uphold them, when you give over Lying then their Honor will lie in the
dust, and when they fall you will be in danger of sterving; for as Phocas by
the murder of his Master Mauritius (the Roman Emperor) gat the Empire to
himself, but was held in an odious estimation amongst all good men, so that
his usurped ill-got estate stood tottering, and his life in daily hazard (by
the friends of the Assassinated Emperor) at the same time, the Bishop of Rome
(Boniface) ambitiously sought to be Chief and Universal Bishop over all
Christian Churches, which pride of his was opposed by all the godly and zealous
Bishops in the World: but at last, the Murderer Phocas and the aspiring Pope
made a bargain, which was that the Pope should by his dreadful Thunderbolts of
Excommunication affright the People into obedience with the Emperor, so the
Emperor (by force of Arms) would bestow the Primacy of the whole Earth on the
Pope, this match was made, and the most significant application of it is, that
by as good right as Phocas reigned, by the like right does Bookers Parliament
rule, and by the same right do those forementioned Villains and they maintain
and defend each other, by Murder, Sacrililedge, Ambition, Treason, Rebellion,
and ruin of this ancient, famous, late-flourishing, and now most wretched and
miserable England.

Our Maremaid Tavern (thou say) is turned Alehouse (for want of wine) but
if any of the Planets told thee so, tell them they lied, for there is
sufficient of Wine in that House to make all the true Subjects in your Army as
drunk as Beasts.

Thou taxest Naworth and me with being blind, that we could not see but
mistake, and take Jupiter for Mars, this mistake might be an escape or fault in
Printing, and my Book was too small to have an Errata annexed to it. I answer,
that Naworth did no more know of the writing or printing of my Book, than thou
and thy Comrades do know how or when to be true Protestants or loyal Subjects;
but all the world may perceive thee to be stark blind in thy understanding,
that could not know the King from John Tailor, just as when a man casts a
stone at a Dog, the foolish Curre runs and bites the stone and never minds
the Caster; why, thou ignorant blind Buzzard, it was I, yea, it was I alone,
without either any or the least assistance from Naworth, Aulicus, or any other
that wrote the Book called [ No Mercurius Aulicus] wherein I told you truly of
your mistaking, villainous Prediction; I tell thee again, thou mis-believing
Infidel, it was I that galled and spur-galled thee to the quick, and thou
(like a blind Jade) could not see me alone that did it, but thou must fall a
snapping and snarling at the King, the Queen, etc. with others, who never had
such a thought as to think upon so villainous a poisonous Vermin as thou art.
Thou should only have meddled with me that mumbled thee; but it is the old
trick of your Pulpiteers and Pamphleteers, to draw the more attention, and
entice Coxcombs and Knaves to buy your damnable roguish riffe raffe, to mix and
blend some slanderous Lies, and Traitorous Ieeres against our Sovereign, and
his most gracious Government: for it is a Rule amongst you, that if there be no
Treason in the Sermon, or Lying Calumniations in the printed Pamphlet, the one
will never be liked and rewarded, nor the other be bought and sold.

And now Sirtha, I will tell thee of an Anagram of my Name, that describes or
emblems my courageous undaunted disposition, as John Tailor, O hearty Lion. It
may be Ioyn Halter may fall out to thee, and I may be the man that may join
it, but be of good comfort if the Dog killer do not mistake thee for a
dangerous Curre; then I am resolved to give order to the Hangman for thee. Thou
say, Thou will be silent hereafter, and that to answer AULICUS, NAVVORTH, or
my Self, were to relieve us. Sir, I know I have put thee to silence, I have
ramm'd up thy bawling chaps, for any more meddling with me, but thou medlest
most mischievously with the Planets, and make most Traitorous Expositions of
them; the Stars and twelve Signs will reward thy lying sophisticating
Calculations, with their malevolent Influences. Also thou recitest (to a
damnable purpose) the story of Saul, Agag, and the murdering of the Protestants
in Ireland, when all men of judgment do know that Ireland durst not rebel as
long as the Earl of Strafford's head was upon his shoulders: but those that
thirsted his blood, did also thirst for the Rebellion there and here too, and
all the murders and outrages in Ireland were occasioned by the Brownists and
Anabaptists, which Villains urged the Papists so violently to infest that
Kingdom. Should I answer every Babble, fable, or knavery in thy pestilent
Pamphlet, all my truths and refutations would not lie in one poor sheet, to
which this my rejoinder is limited, but for a conclusion I will send thee a
Medicine, a requital of the Cordial thou sentst from London to me. I wish
thee not to refuse it, for it will cure Diseases in any Rebel.

Let all these be bound up together in a Holland clowt as big as the palm of
your hand, and tie it fast with the Line of Communication, let it be watered
with the tears of oppressed and distressed Protestants, who are either undone
or imprisoned for being true Subjects, then take them and beat them well in the
Mortar of Common Calamity, with the Pestle of the Public Faith; when it is
well beaten, mix it with the Brains of Booker, May, Wither, Mercurius
Britanicus, Prinne, and two or three hundred Knaves Brains more, it is an
approved Medicine for the increase of Rebellion, for the grumbling in the
gizzard, the flux of the Tongue, or the melancholy mubble-fubbles, provided it
be taken fasting (upon a full stomach) at five of the clock in the morning
after Dinner
