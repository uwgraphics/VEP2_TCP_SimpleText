A Certain WARNING from a naked Heart before the Lord, to the earthly, wise,
great, and honorable Men, and Inhabitants of the Earth, and to all among them,
without respect of Persons, that know not the rock of Ages, the light, the
higher power, the sure foundation, the truth, the way, the life, which is the
grace that brings salvation that appears to all Men, as says the Scripture,
Titus 2.11. 4.12, 13.
Daniel Baker.
HEarken and hear O ye Men that shall dye, and let the spirit in Prison in
you, answer me: whether every soul is not to be subject to the higher power,
the light, which is higher then self, or the power of darkness: which is not
to be exalted above the light of Christ, (the gift of God in man) which is the
higher power, and whether your souls be excluded, (by the good spirit of God)
that spoke forth these words from such a good subjection, and whether the
everlasting light of Jesus, or word, or spirit of truth (that reproves the
world for sin,) and is not the world in man's heart, see Eccles 3.) evil doing
or speaking, (be not the higher power,) that is of God in man, as also is the
soul in man: to which the soul is to subj ct in all things.

And whether a measure of this power, or l^ght of Christ, or grac, gift, or
good spirit of God, that brings salvation with it, has not appeared to, and in
you: and to all men, to the end that your souls, even as others, without
resp^ct of persons, may become subject to it: when received, and no^ rej^cted,
seeing the scripture says it has appeared to all men: see, Titus 2.11.

And whether you think you can prosper, or do any thing that may be acceptable
or well pleasing to the invisible everlasting pure spirit of the L^^d God (that
is oppressed in you yet) till your first rebellious self-exalting deceiptfull
nature is changed: and so your precious souls become subject to th^s g^ft or
grace, or power: t^at's able (not only to change the first nature; but to save
to the utmost) of the everlasting God in you, which in any wise, (behold I
testify) to you never could, nor can, neither ever will consent to, or approve
of, the very appearance, or ground of any evil thought, idle, evil words,
evil way or action: or any thing of self, and whether he that resist^th the
power, does not resist the ordinance of God: and whether such shall not receive
to themselves damnation.

And whether it may not be very good, and profitable, and very whelsome, and
exceeding precious, and wholesome, to yield and subject to such a pure good
power, (the one thing needful,) which I say and testify is in you, though yet
oppressed, (oh that it might arise, and shine forth: when shall it once be, O ye
men that oppress, greive, and vex the good spirit of the most high, in your
selves and others, that never changes its nature, or property, though the
transgressing nature be near, that is to be over-tu^ned, and removed, which
rebels and has gone a whoring, or departed from this one good thing needful,
days and times without number, and this is the good spirit, or light, or word,
or power of the Lord God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, that will not
always strive with, or in man.

Wherefore be ye warned to cease to do evil (and to abstain even from the
appearance of it,) and so learn to do well, with and by subjecting to th^s
good, (one thing needful) that will surely try and p^ove all things, (the many
things) that offend (within and without you:) and this is the equal balance
of the true sanctuary least ye be devoured with, or by this sword, which is
the spirit or word of the everlasting God.

And know of a truth that the children of light (of the day) that believe in
it, do not expect the abollishing, throwing down, or breaking to pieces, all
idols within, and without you: and graven Images, and the dissanulling and
making void all unrighteous decrees, and Popish Laws, root, and branches, and
all oppressions, wicked covenants, and oppressors, Popish Priests, and their
successors, that are yet fed fat, with gifts, and rewards, together, with the
Popes maintenance, Tithes, Piggs, Eggs, and handfulls, and shocks of Corn, and
goods taken by force, like or rather far worse then the sons of Bel^all. 1 Samuel
2. Chap. 12.16. verses, oh, for shame let these things be taken away: and let
not the cry of the innocent come before any of you to be turned aside from
judgment any more, least the Lords fury break forth speedily in the midst of
you, and destroy you, and confound and overturn your counsels, and bring forth
deliverance some other way: which then shall be hid from your eyes to your
perpetual shame, and reproach, for the Lord our God is proceeding to do his
marvailous and quick work in the earth: and who knows whether you may become
serviceable in it, if so, it will be your honor, which is not of man, neither
of this world, that lies in wickedness.

Therefore, let your hands be strong, when ye, as on man every particular of
you bow down and subject to the meek, low, just, equal noble principle, or
gift or grace of God, yet oppressed in you: and so with it your hands shall be
strong and prosper, in throwing down all idols, and idols temples, and bells to
come down after the organs, which the transgressor set up, when they forgot the
Lord, and so did Israel see, Hos. 8, 14.

And these things you may know has fed and strengthened people's wicked vain
minds out of Gods fear, and from Gods witness in them and so it feeds them, as
the Tithes do the greedy covetous Priesthood of Englands dominions, I say we do
no^, neither cannot expect in any wise that these things can be swept away by
you till you come down to this, and the noble, just, equal, pure spirit of the
Lord God (yet oppressed in you) by it to be guided to speak and act for God which
only can make you truly honorable, or break you to pieces and reward you
according to your works, which if they be good then shall the work of the Lord
(the most h^gh God) prosper in your hands.

Wherefore lay aside all flattering Titles, and self-exalting spirits, and take
heed ye let not in (after ye have with the good single spirit cast out) the
Priests and Lawyers flattering fauning viperous spirits, that was and is the
same that did, and will betray and murder the just, wherefore do not forget but
remember that ye have not been only once warned of the things that now I write
to you, and come to the witness in you, and then with it to the Lords work
within and without you, and seek the honor of God only, and away with giving
and receiving honor with flattering titles one to another, for such are not fit
vessels to do the Lords work in, or by in this mighty day [of battle between
the two seeds] or such are in the unbeleife, they believe not in the light
that is arising in his power and greatness of his strength who receives not
honor of Man.

What have you not been here long enough and yet alive on this side the grave,
and have you not yet perceived the mighty invisible eternal hand of the Lord,
and his overturnings from time to time, and how he has smote you as in a
tempest or storm one against another as potters vessels, and who knows but you
are yet come to seats of government to do the Lords work with all your might
and strength, in his fear and dread to be ordered to do, or be isntrumental in
the way (as I have said) to do and accomplish what the Lord has determined
shall be thoroughly affected throughout the Land, or to be swept all away in his
fury and wrath and fires fiery indignation, if ye fail herein, doing or
accomplishing the work of the Lord our God negligently.

Wherefore come down to the eternal true and faithful witness in every of
your consciences, and let your souls subject to this which is the higher power
in you [least with it ye be broken to pieces and ground to powder by this sure
foundation the rock, and so your names perish and stink and rot, and so become
a hissing and byword to the present and futer generations] who have and do yet
pretend so much for the Lord God who is trying you, (O ye tall Seda s) and ye
shall be as truly waighed in the equal balance, even as them that went before
you, who all of you shall most assuredly give an account before the throne of
the Lamb (slain since the foundation of the world) when the book of every of
your consciences shall be opened, and an eye then will be opened in you which
the God of the world which his ministers of unrighteousness has so long
blinded and you shall not hide from, but read your selves, for a great cup is
preparing for you, and ye shall be sure to drink it up, even the dreggs of it,
and tremble and be astonished, and vomit and be confounded, and wish (together
with the cov^tous hireling Priests) that ye had never been born to have seen
this age, if you quit not your selves like men of truth of God, in being
faithful to what the et^rnall eye of the Lord makes manifest what is to be
thrown down and overtu^ned, and what is to b^ norished and set up within and
without you, and the faithful witness in you will also show you this, as to
it ye subject, and this eye being kept open in you as it is in the honest
hearted that hold fast their integrity and walk in it in and over these
Nations, it will behold its enemies afar off as well as nigh, and I say this
eternal eye has seen you, and what you from time to time have declared and
yet pretend to prosecure,

Now therefore say I again, to the h^gher power (the eternal eye the light in
you) b^ faithful and I say that will show you deceit in self with its
righteousness, friendships, honor, glory, worship, faith, rel gion, separation
that is without or out of the spirit, as is self and all that branches forth of
it, which is all to be denied and thrown down (within and without) by the hand
(the Cross) or higher power, to which the soul is to subject, in which the
father is and is to be worshipped in spirit and in truth as do the children of
light who dwell and walk in i^, and so shall you prosper, and the ^and of the
God of heaven will most assuredly then be with you, and this shall be honor
enough for you, and you will concent and seal to my testimony, when as you
become single hearted and faithful, and love nor your lives to the death, then
you may happily feel a Crown of life, Moses reward.

And friends break of your m^ghty sins by righteousness, if happily the poor
man's counsel or words may not fall to the ground, and yet bear with me if I
advise you to take heed (viz.) if you [who are in present authority, to you is
my voice] singly and faithfully do or act or become isntrumental to do any
thing as you are gu^ded, by the good, meek, noble, equal right spirit of God
which is the higher power, and ought to be so, in every of you and in every
man, male and female, although in its own most pure being it is so where ever
it is, but in reference to this, viz when the power of darkness gets over it,
and oppresses its ve^tue and opperation, and so stops and hinders its working
[which is long suffering, so is its nature] so the wicked powers of (hasty
self) darkness coming over and usurping, oppress and exercising Lordship
over the just power, then that is got up and is falsely called (by the unwis^)
the higher power, because its usurped and got into the place of the just power
that is oppressed under it, whose right is not to reign in Gods Temples where he
and his dark power (that was above the light) is thrown down, and they that
witness this cannot honor the devil, of whom proud Haman was a figure.

I say again take heed of a flattering self (love) exalting spirits, and this
is to be cast out from among you, and I say if any of you sing^y do any thing
of the Lords work, look not so back, as formerly ye know many with you have
done, but let it go so as if it had not been done by you, that the Lord God who
only is to have a^l the glory [which he in no wise will give to another or to
selfe] may have all the glory, and be strong and go on, and be a terror to all
slothful unprofitable servants (that have gone before you) and to all Idols
Idolaters false worships and to every evil doer (that's hurtful and
destructive to the Creation) and a praise to every well doer whose consciences
the light even the light of the Lord Jesus exercised, and this same gift or
grace of God or light in you, as to it you subject will faithfully show you who
such are, for with no other eye but this (by which they are guided) can they be
seen, and the Lord in the midst of his Jewels, has said I will guide them with
mine eye, so says the scripture, and this eye the higher power g^veth to the
faithful (the willing and obedient) a true discerning between the precious and
the vile within and without, blessed are and shall they be that do and shall
witness such a true separation.

And friends, it will redown more to your honor, and will become more noble,
then [that which scorners and fools count honor and nobility] to ride upon
pransing fatted horses, a figure of them that forget the Lord and his work, or
Pharaoh and his host that was and is to be overturned and swallowed up (because
of the oppression of the poor suffering seed) I say a figure of them who as
fatted horses are fatted for the day of slaughter the horses and their riders,
the Armor (the gorgeous apparel) and Chariots in wicked vain glory, pransing
and glittering proudly, trampling through the streets of the wicked City
filled with hipocrysy and deceit and unfaithfullness, and so to be laughed at by
scorners, wicked men and fools, even those ye count your enemies, and so
admired by fools, and this I am certa^n is not the honor that comes from the
Lord of hosts, and the Lords wrath and vengance will meet with and overtake you
and all that go on in this way greedily satisfying their ungodly lusts, and
this with somewhat else from my hand is and may be a sure and certain warn^ng
to you O ye Mountains before honor is humility in the light of the holy City,
and the Kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it, Rev. 21 2^,
24.

The time is come and coming that all the Sons and Daughters of fallen Adam is
to be turned to the light (from the darkness) to Gods spirit within them, from
which they have erred that's given even to the rebellious to instruct them, then
of necessity they must be turned to that from which they have erred which they
are to believe in, in which they are to worship the father in truth and in
spirit, and away with all false worship and idols and hipocrisy, and speak
every man the truth from the heart to his neighbor, and come to know your
rebellious nature changed, that ye may become just men of truth, meek and
merciful, f^aring God and hating covetousness and every evil way, word and
action where ever it appears or is brought forth.

And down with all cursed abominations, that's acted in and through the open
streets of this great wicked City (London) and all other Cittyes and
Market-Townes in and throughout this Nation, and her Dominions by the cursed
power of darkness.

The shows, the Lord Mayors shows (so called) and such like crying abominations
as is acted in Cittyes, Fairs, Towns, and Markets, in and throughout Englands
Dominions, and behold I tell ye, that the Lord even the everlasting God abhors
these things (and the power by which they are acted) which feeds the light,
vain, rebellious, defiled, wicked minds of people both of young and old, and
the Lords vengance is pouring forth upon the heads of the Priesthood of England
for lewdness (as in the days of old) is gone and go^th out from them into all
the earth.

Oh what a crying open shame is it for such who are called Magistrates, which
should be just men of truth, a terror to every evil doer, and for them to give
up their strength and means and precious time to uphold, exalt and keep up in
their course and time these heinous and most abominable, crying, horrible,
wicked abominations stuffed with pride hipocrisy and vain glory by which the
creatures are devoured and consumed upon the ungodly lusts (that war against
your souls) for which end they were not created, and the whole creation is
burdened and groans under all this filth.

And the terrible dreadful everlasting God will plead with vengance and fury
poured forth in his fires wrath because of these things, (and many of your
dillicate beds of ease will be a place of torment when the skillful physicians
shall be of no vallue) and ye would not receive warning nor instruction of
life, notwithstanding the Lord God the powerful God sent his servants and
faithful messengers to cry aloud the sound, and signs hereof from time to
time, has been heard and seen in and through the streets, and entered into the
secret chambers of your immagary, and so you have made light of the visitation
of the most high, and rather choose the ways, practices and customs of the
heathen, to which end a petition from the wise men of London to the late
Parliament (whom the hand of the Lord overturned and shattered to pieces) that
their heathenish ancient customs might be continued, or kept up.

Wherefore O London this is the cry that is to pass through the streets of and
in thy lewd light vain filthy polluted inhabitants of the Land, behold a swo^d,
a sword, a glittering sword, a bright sharp sword, its drawn, its furbushed
that it might glitter, pierce and be bathed into the bowels of the unstable
double-minded hipocrites and scornful, much flesh most assuredly by it with
fire shall be devoured as in the ancient days, for behold a mighty and strong
hand is lifted up with this bright sharp sword, which will slay and spare
neither on the right hand nor on the left, till the fiery z^al of the eternal
God, has performed what in his heart he has determined.

Wherefore woe, woe, woe to the earth with her inhabitants, horror and amazement,
astonishment, terrors, with destruction upon destruction is coming over the
heads of the priesthood of England, the Lord God with his dreadful hand will
make you a fierce terror to your selves, O ye greedy devouring wolves that have
made the herritage of the most high your pray, but behold the hammer is put
into the hand that will smite and break and shatter the rocks to pieces, and
race the h^gh mountains, so as there shall be none to hide or cover you, O ye
brutish pastors, and ravennous beasts of the Forest where the briars and
thorns are so plentifully brought forth, strong and terrible is the everlasting
powerful God the holy one of Israel, the eternal light and life of the house
of Jacob that will by his hand in his chosen perform these things.

Wherefore tremble ye Mountains, and shake terribly ye lofty Hills, turn
aside ye strong Oaks, get ye hence into darkness ye devouring Wolvish
unprofitable Servants, O ye Priests and grievous oppressing Lawyers of England,
and bow down O ye heads, gather together ye fatted Bulls and Haifers, and come
up to the Battle ye pransing fatted Horses with your haughty, proud and
scornful R^ders, for a loud, quick and terrible Alarm is sounded in the holy
Mountain of the everlasting holy hill of Zion, a fire, a consuming fire shall
be kindled in the bowels of the Earth, which will scortch with burning heat all
hypocrites unstable double-minded workers of iniquity, together with all
children of errogansy and pride the seed of falsehood of the whore, that well
favored harlot with her brats, the unclean unprofitable talkers, Babylons
Merchants, and they shall know with anguish and perplex^ty of heart and minds
which are defiled, that the everlasting light of Isreal's life is a rising in
the greatness of his strength (as in the days of o^d) to sta n the pride of
all glory, and bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth, and to bow
down the haughty under the prisoners of hope, for a great and large slaughter
shall be throughout the land of darkness where the unrighteous decrees and
laws have been founded, built up, brought forth and executed upon the innocent,
ye a great affusion of blood, fire, vapor and smoke shall increase up in the
dark habitation of cruelty, howling and great wailing shall be on every hand,
in all streets, the strong pransing fatted horses shall wax faint (with
wallowing with their riders) and fall in the great affusion of blood in the
night of darkness where there shall be no light but an horrible dreadful fierce
dark irresistible tempest, and furious and violent storms, in so much that the
gallant ships shall not be able with all their force and tacklin, strong and
skillful Mariners to encounter, who shall not in any wise hide their heads,
for fear and dread and horror and amazement with astonishment of heart shall
suddenly surprise them, even at the first appearance of the dark thick clouds
of this horrible and mighty temp^st at which men's hearts shall fail on every
hand, but the Lambs in the low vallyes shall be at rest hid.

Terrible thunders from the everlasting powerful God will be thundered forth
with bright and quick fiery lightnings from the highest heavens which will
rent, break to pieces, tear and split the ragged Rocks and sturdy Oaks, and
race the lofty Mountains, so that no hiding places shall be found to hide the
fruitless trees Briars and Thorns and deceitful rotten weather-beaten vessels
of dishonor that has long been trading with their deceitful Merchandise from
Sea to S^a, even from one proud Sea to another, notwithstanding many have
suffered shipwreck, and been overwhelmed and swallowed up of the mighty proud
merciless waves of the troubled Sea that cannot rest and the eternal eye of
the Lord the everlasting light of life has seen these things, and with his
pure breath of life are they spoken, and with his everlasting and strotched out
hand will he accomplish and perform what is in his heart, so shall it be.

Daniel Baker.
Two of the original Copyes of this was delivered, the one into John Ireten's
hand late Mayor, and another to the present Mayor that evening before the
heathenish idolaters with their idolatry, and cursed abominations from the
power of darkness which was too highly exalted and upheld and acted by the
great Men of the earth; oh foolish people when will you be wise, how long will
you thus tempt the eternal God.

Newgate this 26 of the 8th month 59

This is chiefly intended for those in present authority of the chiefest seats
of England, and for Mayors and Aldermen and Citizens of London, and all the
earthly Rulers in and throughout the Nations to read themselves and be ashamed,
and to lay aside their heathenish idollatrous customs, and to learn the fear of
the Lord which is to depart from evil, and not hate and persecute such that so
fear the Lord (the living God) and with his spirit reprove sin in the gate, and
therefore are become a pray (as in former days) to those that rebel against
the light, and turn aside the needy from judgment.

The Lord God of wisdom whom I serve in and with my spirit of truth knows
and is my witness that of his pure spirit was I moved not only to write to the
2 Mayors of the City of London, the next days work (being the 29th of the 8th
month) to stop them of their folly and vanity, but in no wise would they
receive warning, to the vexing and oppressing of the most pure spirit of God)
manifested, and many shall feel the weight of his hand that can span the
heavens, and fathom over, and comprehend the height and depth of darkness, I
say, I also was moved to go, and bear a testimony for the Lord at the Mayors
gate to the face of many of the Aldermen (who should be more wise) the words
which I speak as the Lord moved, were these at several times, as the horses
and their riders entered within the Mayors gate, where I stood saying.

The Lord God will stain the pride and glory of all flesh, the Lord God will
stain the pride of all glory as in the days of old, the Lord will smite the
great men of the earth with astonishment of heart, who forget justice and
judgment. And the Lord God has a controversy with all that forget the Lo^d
and his work.

The Lord will be avenged on the great men of the earth, that destroy and
devour the creatures, and the Creation upon their ungodly lusts, and forget to
do justice and judgment.

For which sayings I was buffetted and abused at the Mayors gate by the brutish
people, and violently dragged and carried away by Porters, and thrown into the
Poultery Counter (in the inner prison called the hole) without Mittimus, throw
him in (said the Mayors officer or Ma^shall, and let him lie like a Rogue, and
he was numbered with transgressors, and he made intercession for the
transgressors, lo he was taken from prison, and from judgment, and who shall
declare his generation, Isa. 53.8.
