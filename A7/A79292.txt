A PROCLAMATION, Concerning His Majesty's Coronation Pardon.
CHARLES. R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty since his Return to the Exercise of the
Regal Powers of his Crown has passed an Act of General Pardon, Oblivion and
Indemnity, and has also directed Charters of Pardon according to a form
prescribed to issue under His Great Seal, which have been sued forth by many of
His Subjects, wherein, as to the Amplitude of the matters pardoned, His
Majesty has far exceeded the Presidents of all former Coronation, and other
Pardons by any of His Predecessors, And also the limits of time to which they
extend, are nearer to the time of His Majesty's Coronation then has been used
in the former Examples, whereby His Majesty has granted his Coronation Pardon
in effect before His Coronation; Nevertheless, not willing to vary from the
Course of His Predecessors at their Coronation, and being well pleased with
opportunities to abound in acts of Grace and Clemency to His people, from whom
He does also expect Returns of Loyalty and due obedience on their parts,
whereof His Majesty does not doubt: Therefore the Kings most Excellent Majesty
does by this His Royal Proclamation publish and declare, that all and every the
Subjects of His Majesty's Realms of England and Ireland, the Dominion of Wales,
the Isses of Jersey and Guernsey, and the Town of Berwick upon Tweed, or any of
them may sue out Pardons according to the form already ordered and directed by
his Majesty, which is more ample in the things pardoned, and with fewer
Exceptions then have been usual in Pardons granted upon like occasion at the
Coronation of his Majesty's Predecessors, And is Graciously pleased, and does
hereby signify and declare His Royal pleasure to be; That the said Pardons
shall be extended in time further then the times limited by the Act of Oblivion
and his former Grants of Pardon, or either of them (that is to say) unto the
Nine and Twentyeth day of December now last past, on which day the late
Parliament did dissolve and determine. And to the end His Majesty's Subjects
may have sufficient notice to lay hold of His Princely Grace and Favor
intended herein, His Majesty is pleased and does declare, That the said Pardons
shall and may be sued out at any time within the space of One whole Year to be
accounted from the Twenty third day of this instant April, being the day
appointed for his Royal Coronation. Provided always, and his Majesty does
declare, That no person or persons in the said Act of General Pardon,
Indemnity and Oblivion, Excepted or not pardoned or reserved to future pains
or penalties as therein is expressed, nor such persons (not exceeding the
number of Twelve persons in the whole) which his Majesty for that purpose will
nominate and signify unto the Earl of Clarenden Lord High Chancellor of
England, within Twenty days next ensuing after His Royal Coronation; Nor any
persons guilty of Burglary shall be admitted to have the benefit of the said
Pardon. And whereas diverse persons in the said Act of General Pardon
particularly named, are thereby disabled from bearing any Office of Trust or
public employment within this Realm of England, Dominion of Wales, or Town of
Barwick upon Tweed, His Majesty wills and declares that His said Pardon
shall not be Granted to any of the said disabled persons, but with like
Exceptions and Disabilities in all things, and in such manner as are mentioned
in the said Act of General Pardon, and according to the true meaning of the
said Act, and no otherwise.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Three and twentieth day of April, One
thousand six hundred sixty one, and in the Thirteenth year of His Majesty's
Reign.
GOD SAVE THE KING.
