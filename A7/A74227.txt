THE COPY OF A LETTER SENT FROM THE RIGHT HONORABLE, The Lord PAGET, unto the
Honorable House of Parliament, declaring the reasons of his departure from
them, unto the KINGS Most Excellent Majesty at York.
IT may seem strange, that I, who with all zeal and earnestness have
prosecuted in the beginning of this Parliament, the Reformation of all
disorders in Church, and Commonwealth, should now in a time of such great
distractions, desert the cause. Most true it is, that my ends were the common
good: And whilst that was prosecuted, I was ready to lay down both my life and
fortune: But when I found a Preparation of Arms against the KING, under the
shadow of Loyalty, I rather resolved, to obey a good Conscience, then
particular ends, and am now on my way to His Majesty, where I will, throw my
self down at his feet, and die a loyal Subject.

PAGET.
