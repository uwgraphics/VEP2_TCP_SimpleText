THE AUTHORS To all the well-affected People of this NATION.
AS no Nation has met with more dangerous enemies, and against whom, greater,
sorer, and deeper designs and plots have been attempted for the ruin and
destruction thereof, then against this Common wealth: so (all things duly
considered) there is no people under Heaven unto whom the Lord has vouchsafed
greater deliverances: And a^ we thankfully observe the good hand of the Lord
going always along with us, so we are persuaded from the feeling experience of
former mercies, that he will never leave us until he ha^h perfected his good
work, marv^ilously begun in the Land.

And howsoever, we know the Almighty God without men or means, is sufficient
to carry on his own work, and to effect the same, when, and how, as it seems
good in his fight: Nevertheless, we take our selves bound, in obedience to
him, and of tender-respect to the Nation, both to foresee the danger, and to
provide all seasonable and lawful helps for the timely prevention thereof.

Now whereas among other Artifices and cunning courses, whereby this Generation
of men (going under the name of Levellers) have corrupted and deceived the
minds of people, and drawn them to disaffect the present Government, and to
make Commotions and hurliburlies in the Land. One main and special way has
been, by spreading seditious and scandalous Books, wherein are many fair
pretenses of Liberty, freedom, safety, etc. with much regret, tenderness,
and fellow-feeling of the Oppressions, Burdens, and Taxes of the People.

This being so, and a thing well known to us, we have thought it necessary
(whilst the Parliament and Council of State are employed with the great and
weighty affairs of the Nation) to do something in the like way of writing,
thereby to undeceive the People, by a (...), plain, and full discovery of the
deceits and falsehoods of these man: and that it may most evidently appear to
all judicious and rational People, that wheresoever in their Papers and
Pamphlets, they most show themselves to be lovers of their Country, and
profess greatest desire to have all things well settled, even there under Good
words they merely deceive the simple, and carry on a traiterous design,
against the peace, freedom, and safety of the Nation.

And we have the more hope that this work will do much good in the Land,
because there is nothing here produced upon hearsay, or taken up as a report
from others (howsoever much could be spoken this way, and for their proof it
is little else) but all out of their own Books, which are extant, and in many
men's hands, so that what conspiracy, sedition, treason, or other mischiefs
are here discovered and charged upon them: themselves are brought in, (even
their own mouths and hands) as witnesses.

For the rest which is to follow, (as we have promised it, so) we shall further
the expedition what we can. For the searcher of all hearts does know our sense,
our sighs and deep apprehensions, that any honest and simple hearted should be
misled and ensnared by such pernicious men: But as for such, as are thus
single and sincere, we make no question but by comparing things with things,
they will now see a great deal of seditious plotting and conspiring against
our Religion, Laws, Liberty, etc. which before they saw not, because covered
with the specious pretense of seeking to settle the Commonwealth upon Ground
of peace, freedom, and safety.

The Discoverer. Wherein is set forth (to un-deceive the Nation) the real plots
and Stratagems of Lievt. Col. John Lilburn, Mr. William Walwyn, Mr. Thomas
Prince, Mr. Richard Overton, and that Party: And the several seditious ways
and wyles a long time practiced by them, to accomplish and effect the same;
Namely, under the pretense and color of Liberty, and to take off the Burdens
and Grievances of the Commonwealth, a most destructive design is carried on,
to deprive the people of their Religion, Rights, Proprieties, Freedom, Laws,
Government, etc. and to bring a total and universal ruin upon the Land. And
so much is here clearly demonstrated, by reason and proof abundantly. The
First Part.
AS all vices use to clothe themselves with the habits of virtues, that under
those Liveries they may get countenance, and find the more access in the
w^rld: so especially in a Common wealth Treason and Sedition do commonly
present themselves under this color and cloak; taking up the Politic
pretense of Native birth right, common freedom and safety, as a weapon of mere
advantage, whereby ambitious, discontented, and self-conceited men, use to make
Commotions, and Mutinies, and to disturb (if not destroy) the present
Government.

And this is well known unto all men, who have any knowledge in History,
whether humane or divine, ancient or modern, foreign or domestic; that under
the plausible, sweet, and much taking name of Palam speciosa praet^xunt nomina

LIBERTY, with crying out against Tyranny, A^bitrary power, Taxes, Oppressions,
etc. Many pernicious plots have been c^rried on, to the great hurt and
prejudice of the whole Nation: yea, and unawares many honest and well-meaning
people, have been brought into a snare and pit^. Like thou who followed Absalom
in that unnatural conspiracy against his father, 2 Samuel 1^.11.
in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.

Thus the Pazzians at Florence to draw the people to their Conspiracy, Histo y
of Flor: and Ven.
Cried out in the Marketplace, Liberty, Liberty, although indeed it was to
b^ing them from freedom to very sl very. So Munzier seeking the ruin of
Germany, and to raise himself and his Confederates out of the dust and ashes
thereof, laid this down as his principle; S e den C^mmen^. l^b. 5.
Free Commoners, an equal and just G vernment, and every man a like in respect
of liberty, freedom, and safety. And this pleased the multitude so well,
that they followed him in rebellion and treason against the State, till at last
falling under the hand of Justice, came to see and acknowledge their great
wickedness.

We shall not mention any thing now out of our own Stories, but come to the
Sowers of discord and sedition amongst us. That these men c^mplaine against
tyranny, oppression, slavery, Jurisdiction of he sword, etc. and The picture of

for the Settlement of this Common wealth, upon the foundations of an equal
and just Governm nt. It is w^ll k^own, and so much their papers and writings
do declare. So that the work which we have here taken in hand, is to
Represent (in way of A DISCOVERY) to the Nation, what mischief and misery lies
hid (as a dunghill under snow, or a hook covered with a ba^) and is daily
acted and cun^ingly carried on, under a fal^e pretense of se^king the public
good: and this we shall do (by the good hand of G^d assisting us) in a
temperate and sober way, leaving opprobrious and bitter speeches to such men
who having a bad cause cannot otherwise uphold the same.

But before we come to particulars, we shall observe some few general things,
as giving much light to our present Discovery.

1. Prudentiall and wise Statists and Politicians have well observed, that a
conspiracy or sedition lies hatching a while like the Cockatrice eggs, and
usually before it breaks forth, it discovers it self by certain symptoms or
signs: and these ten are noted as most especial and un-fallable. In lotibulil

1. Private Conventicles. 2. Calumniations and vile aspertions. 3. Complaints.
4. A professed hatred against some men in authority. 5. A dislike and contempt
of the present Government. 6 Threatenings. 7. Contradictions. 8. Discontent at
the change of Magistrates. 9. Putting obstructions to the ex^cution of the Law.
10. Troubling and disquieting the minds of the vulgar sort. That these, even
all of them, a^^ in those m^n, and not a little, but as clea^ly to be seen, as
wa^ Gehazr's Leprosy on the forehead, we shall manifest in this following
Treatise, and do desire the Reader to take good notice of it; for doing so, he
shall the better know the tree by the f uit.

2. That they may bring th^msel^es into the esteem and favor of the people,
they pretend and make an outward show, as if no men in the Land were so tender
and sensible as they, of the heavy burdens of the Nation, and se^ke to have
the people dis-affict^d toward the present Government and G^vernour^, by false
and sl^nderous insinuations, as if the P^rliament m^gh^ and could ease them, of
Tithes, Excise, Free Q^^rter, and other Taxes and grievances, and will not. But
this is no new thing; for A^s^lom did the like long ago; 2 Samuel 15.4.
Oh that I were made Judge in the Land: Good soul, how he pitties the people,
and grieves to think that there are no better men in place; and were he on his
Fathe^s throne, the Kingdom should be settled upon the grounds of Common Right,
Freedom, and Safety. But for an^wer to their accusation, which is both false
and treacherous.

False; for 1. Not only has the Parliament declared at sundry times, that
there shall he upon the people no burden which they possibly can remove: but
likewise it is their work and daily study, to improve all lawful ways and
means, to the utm^st of their power, for the settlement and constitution of
this Common wealth, in safety, peace, and freedom.

2. For the things which they complain of, as the Oppressions and Burdens of
the people; If the particulars be rightly understood, as Taxes, Tithes, Excise,
and the rest; truly more for the present cannot be done: and if men would but
confi^^^^ in what condition we are, and how matters stand with us, both at
home and abroad, they would not blame the Parliament for this grievance, or
that burden, which as yet cannot be otherwise, nor remedied: These are Rules
and Maxims in Law, Reason and Nature. Ad impossible neminem obl^g^^s. l. si
quia ut gravia Syll^^.
No man can be bound to an impossibiliti^. Likewise, Rations naturales pro ^eg
bas amplectendas. L. Cum Ratio de ^o^da^^.
Natural Reasons are to be received for Laws. So again, In necessitatibus
leges non servari. l. ut gradatim, sect. 1. de Man. and honor.
In necessity the Law lawfully may be broken. And Omne inco^modum aliquo
commodo compensandum. l. 1. sect. fin. de aqua pluu.
there is no discomm^ditie, but has amends made with some commodity. All
which holds true here, and rightly may be applied.

3. And let it be well observed, how their practice here for all the world, is
as if a man should bind another, hand and foots, and afterward beat him,
because he does not go. Who but th^se men are the chief obstructors of
Reformation, and the settlement of the Commonwealth, and by their conspiracies
and treacherous designs, increase the Grievances and Burden of the people: and
then strike the Governors, because the work is not done. It can be proved, if
need be, that the Land is put to an hundred thousand pounds yearly charge by
their me^^^^, besides much prejudice and sufferings otherwise: and therefore
the free Commoners of England have just cause to declare and pronounce against
this Faction, for oppression and cruelty exercised upon their fellow-brethren;
and that Excise, Sesments, Free Quarter, etc. are the longer continued, and
things tending to public good not don, because of them.

It is a notable shift sometimes practiced by an old thief, being pursued with
hue and cry, to cry out, Stop the thief, stop the thief; thinking that no
body surely will suspect him to be the man, whilst they hear him to cry out
thus after another. These men have learnt such a trick; Lord, what a noise they
make against Tyranny, Oppression, Cruelty, etc. Charging others therewithal;
supposing, no doubt, that no man will imagine that they are the THIEVES, the
Tyrants, Oppressors, Murderers: howsoever the truth is, the Robbery is
committed by themselves.

2. Treacherous, to conspire against the Supreme Authority of England, and to
stir up the people, Picture of the Council of State, page 14.
to declare and protest against the same; yea, to move A Declaration of the
free Commoners of England.
Soldiers as well as others to rise up against the Parliament men, as so many
professed traitors, thieves, robbers, and high-way-men, and to apprehend,
secure, and bring them to Justice in a new Representative: And all this, for no
other cause, but because such things are not don, which at the present they
cannot do, yea more for such burdens and sufferings which by their occasion
and means are necessarily increased and continued in the Land.

3. Whosoever shall peruse their Pamphlets, shall see that they always speak
h^gh words, and give out the reproachfulst terms, and vilest expressions that
ever mouth uttered: Even as the swine spares not his mouth from any filthy and
unclean thing; so they spare none, whatsoever their worth, place, or
deservings be, if they stand in opposition to their design: they are Tyrants,
Nimrods, Beasts, Bears, Wolves, a pack of fawning and dawbing knaves: The
Parliament for seeking to suppress their treacherous and dangerous plots, are
said to be Picture of the Council of State, second Edition. p. 14. 17.
the greatest Traitors that ever were in this Nation, a dead and stinking
carcass; a factious company of men, treacherously combined together, to subdue
the Laws, liberty, and freedom of England: Greater Tyrants then ever the
King was, or that cruel Tyrant Duke D Alua: bloody Queen Mary (in comparison)
was a Saint to these men. A Declaration of the free Commoners of England.
. All their Votes, Orders, Ordinances, Declarations, and Acts, or that
hereafter they shall pass; they declare and protest against, as not binding to
the people.

It is far from our purpose to render evil for evil, or railing for
railing: to undeceive the people by a plain and true Discovery of them, Is
the thing we only aim at. And for this end we desire it may be here observed.

1. It has been the common practice of such men formerly, wanting Reason, to
use Railing: as froward men in suits of Law when their case fails, endeavor to
piece it up with rage and passion: Or like Cocks feeding upon garlic, overcome
others with rankness of breath, not with streng^h of body.

2. Although there have been in all ages some who have despised dominion, and
spoke evil of dignities: yet we may affirm it with all confidence, that there
is no president or example of any who have been formerly so immoderate, and
such excessive raylers against the highest and supreme Authority of a Nation
as these men are. When people are sincere, and are indeed against all tyranny
and oppression, and for Common-right, freedom, and safety, God is with their
mouth, and gives them what they shall speak, and it is ^ot his manner to leave
them to such a sinful and most abhorred course. There is a Beast called D^ron,
being pursued, and seeing no way to escape, by a natural craft casts forth
her dung against the hunters following her, and so hinders them from com ne
near, by reason of the corrupt smell and stink: thereof. It would be a pretty
devise, if these men against whom the Parliament is now proceeding, could by
casting forth reproaches and vile slanders, escape out of their hands.

3. Howsoever their accusa ions are heavy and many, yet their pro^fes a^e
still light and few: usu^lly ^t is J^stin. Insti. l. 1. Tit. 10.
Dom sticum T^stimonium, or hearesay, or their own supp^sing grounded upon no
likelihood or probable Reason at all: or whatsoever is produced for proof^,
relates not to the matter for which it was brought: and whosoever reads over
their papers shall find their d^^^ng to be thus every where. These men pretend
much skill in the L^w, now the L^w says, Pro^at ones deb^^^ esse luce
cla^^or^^ L. Sciant C.
Proofs ought to be cl^^rer then the noonday T^stes singular^t non prob^nt.
: Single testimonie^ prove nothing: Testis deponens de auditis non p ^b t.
I witness d p^sing upon hearesay is no proof: ^estis debet deponere per
corporis sensum, and non jud c^um intellectus. l. T^st ^. and l. qu Te^ (...).
sect. A^. F. d^ T^^.
not what a man thi^kes, but knows, stands good in Law. It is a true saying,
N^c^ns esse ^e^o pa e^t si ^^usasse s^ff ^^et.
None should be innocent, if it be enough, to accuse. How weak, uncertain,
improbable, yea most untrue their proofs are, we shall show hereafter to the
full.

But 4. this reviling men in authority, and to ca^l them tyrants, traitors,
thieves, murderers, etc. is an old State-destroying Strat^gem. Mutineers and
Incendiaries have made much use of it, and had great advantage by it. Machiavel
himself has it, and for ex^mple insta^ceth one M^^lius Capatolinus, who being
overcome with envy, and not able to endure the honor and renown given by the
Citizens of Rome to Furius C^melus for his valor and good service, addresseth
him else to the Common people, as well knowing their temper, M^^ic pa^e v^^eus

slanders and falsehoods, against some eminent and chief men, as to be Traitors,
Tyrants, The^ves, etc. Whereupon the people run together, make head, and fill
all places with tumults, and uproares, and no d^ubt great m^schiefe would have
followed, had not the Senate created a Dictator, who by examination sound the
treacherou^ conspiracy of Manlius!

So again speaking of Florence (his own City) M^ch^^^ls Discourses. li. 1. c.

Such men (says he) as had served the State best, and been employed in the
greatest affairs, were most slandered: of one they said he had robbed the Common
treasure; of another that he had not performed his trust in the Army; of
another that through covetousness and ambition sought his own Interest: hence
grew hatred, thereupon division, from division to faction, from faction to
ruin. And a little after, And this course (says he) namely, to raise up false
reports against men in authority, is a ready way whereby many do serve
themselves, as steps and helps to their ambitious end^: For being to encounter
with p^werfull men, they make the people their friends, by telling them they
will take their part against the Tyrannical Usurpation and Incroachment of
Great ones, and procure their Rig^ts and Freedom out of their hands. If we
compare time with time, and things with things, we shall find, that saying
most true; There is nothing new under the Sun; as the plots, conspiracies, and
treason of men now, are the very same with what formerly has been, so the very
way and course whereby former I^cendiari^s and Conspirators have used to effect
the same, is at th^s day, and by this party practiced to a hair.

4. In the last place, we shall observe what they say; Manif^station, page 8.
Could we have had any ^ssurance that what is d sired, should have otherwise or
by any have been don, and had not had some ^aste of the relinquishment of many
good things what were proposed, we should not have been so earnest for the
doing thereof. To which we answer.

1. Howsoever the Parliament has sat long, and not so much don for publ ck
good as has been expected: neve^thelesse, this cannot be justly cha^g d upon
the present House of Commons: for it is well known, the freedom and power,
which now they have, it has been but a little while in their hands: neither
have they been long in that capacity as now they are to manage and settle the
affairs of the Commonwealth: whosoever therefore shall duly consider, the
shortness of the time, the many oppositions, obstructions, and
discouragements, which the Lord has brought them through, and in what disorder
and confusion things lately were, what divisions in the Land, and the many
strong parties against them; and lastly, the many good things which they have
don, he shall see more cause to bless God for his goodness and mercy toward
us, in preserving us from the snare and pit, then to murmr or complain
against men, because this, or that, is not also don. There may be no fault
either in the Physic, or Physician, and yet the patient remain longer si^k,
then he desires to be.

2. For the many good things which they speak of, we shall show by and by what
they are, as the dissolving of the Council of State, breaking of the Army,
neglecting and loosing Ireland, opening the Press to all scandalous and
seditious Libels, and turning the Land into a wilderness. For other things
which truly tend to the freedom and safety of the Commonwealth, the
Parliament has not Relinquished, nor any one of them, nor ever will: but daily
endeavors, to free all men from all burdens and oppressions, and no doubt
(as was said) the Peoples Enlargement and Comfort this way, would be much the
sooner, were it not for the conspiracy and sedition of those men.

3. As delays are dangerous; so sometimes have makes wast: Festina lent, was
Augustus Emblem. Great stones are not laid in the building without some time
and great labor, because of their weight, but once placed remain long.
Charles King of Naples was surnamed C^nctator, Delayer, because he stayed till
opportunity was past: But Fabius the shield of Rome, was so called, because he
only stayed, till opportunity was come.

From Generals, we come now to a more particular Dij veri^. Till we saw their
Manifestation, we could not well tell, nor hardly guess, what for men in many
things they would have the world think them to be. There indeed they
Manif^station, page 6.
profess that they believe there is one eternal and omnipotent God, the
^^ther and preserver of all things in the world: And deny to be either
Atheists or Antiscripturists. But what Athieist for advantage and to serve his
own turn, will not profess as much, and more too? Valerius Max. l. 9.
Demosthenes being asked what in speech was most effectual, answered, (...),
hypocrisy, and being demanded the second and third time, gave the same answer.
Whether there be not hypocrisy here in their speech; Let these things be noted.

1. It is asserted by them, that New Law of Righteousness, page 64. Truth

Reason is God, and out of this Reason came the whole Creation.

2. The Sea Overios book concerning this thing.
immortality of the soul they flatly deny, and scoff as such people as
believe the souls immortality.

3. In the Levellers Creed, there is no Jesus Christ, no conception, birth,
life, death, burial, resurrection, or exaltation of such a one; New Law of
righteousness, p. 98, 99. 1^1
No heaven nor hell, No Angel, good nor had; No resurrection of the flesh; for
to take it so in the letter (they say) is a dream of our Preachers.

4. New Law, etc. p. 97.
All that we call the history of the Scripture is an idol; for there is no
other Adam, or Christ, Cain or Abel, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Canaanites,
Amalekites, Philistims: but what is seen and felt within every man. Hence they
say, New Law, etc. p. 78.
the public Preachers have cheated the whole world, by telling us of a single
man, called Adam, that killed us by eating a single fruit.

5. By their Principles men must leave off, New Law, page 112.

There is no use of Sermons, Sacraments, or prayer, Ibid. 82.

Witches, Sorcerers, Deceivers: Ibid. 115.
They and the people joining together in public worship is an ab^mination.
Ibid. 121. 138
Gathering Congregations, Church Fellowship, and all outward forms this (say
the Levellers) is to betray Christ into the hands of flesh, a deceit of the
Devil, the Government of the Beast, Antichristian captivity, and it is to be
under the tyrant flesh, a new bondage, a wrapping men in confusion, the mystery
of iniquity, and only to hinder Christ the great Prophet from rising.

It has formerly been held, that Prospera ^ueniunt colentibus deos, adversa
spernentibus, Live. lib. 5.
Religion, and the true worship of God, is much for the safety and prosperity
of a Commonwealth, and men's Rel gio neglecta aut pro^apsa, traxit semper r^m^:

When God is neglected, the Land is corrected. Into what pernicious and
damnable errors these men are fallen, and daily seek to draw others, what
heart without breaking almost can think thereof? and so much the more, because
God is highly dishonored, and exceedingly provoked to wrath, and the whole
Nation, for it suffers bitter things.

There is a City called Zaiton in India, where they bring hot meats to their
Idols, feeding their dumb-gods with the smoke, and eating the meat themselves.
Whatsoever these men profess concerning one eternal and omnipotent God, yet
they serve him just as the Heathens do their idols, give him no meat, no
worship, service, or religious duty, all that he has from them is only
smoke, and fitly may it be named smoke, for in truth their principles are
nothing else but the smoke of the bottomless pit.

6. That they are Atheists and Antiscripturists, or little better: Men who
regard not God, neither the Scriptures, nor any religion; it may be clearly
seen by the Agreement of the People, which they call, Manifestation, p. 7.
the standard and ultimate scope of their designs. Amongst all their Proposals
and Articles (which are thirty a^ least) there is not one thing proposed, for
the holding forth and furtherance of Gods public worship and service. Now who

Neither shall we find any where (saving among this generation of men) of a
model and platform of Government (though drawn up by Heathen) where Religion
was not look after, and had not the pre-eminence and first place. See Jewel
defense of the Apol^gie, 6 part cap 1 (...) p^g. 644. 64^

custom to say, Jam seq^^tu^ Institutio legu^rs Sacul^rium. Now fol^oweth an
order for Temporal laws.

They will have tithes taken away: it is well, but mark, whil^^ they do a
good works of ^asing the people of (...), they will do^ something that shall
deprive them of the knowledge of the truth. And this is apparent; For they will
not have it in the power of the Parliament to impose Ministers upon any of the
Respective Parishes, but shall give free liberty to the Parishioners of every
Parish to choose such ^s themselves shall approve. Here (Anguis latet sub
herba) is an artificial devise to fill all places with Atheists, heretics,
blasphemers, etc. and there is no remedy: For in case the people of some
Parishes will not choose any one to instruct them in the knowledge of Christ,
but will rather choose to live without Christ and instruction (as no doubt many
would do so in this case) or suppose they will choose one that shall instruct
them in the Turks Alcoran, or the Jews Talmud, or which is as bad (if not
worse) teach them the Leaven of Levellers; That there is no saving Christ, no
heaven or hell, no Angel or Devil, no resurrection of the body, and much more
to this purpose (of which we shall speak presently) now suppose all this, yet
the Magistrate must not stir, though it be in a public way to hinder the
spreading of any damnable heresies, or to promote the truth.

And this is one of the good things for which they complain against the
Parliament, as to relinquish: To grant men liberty of Conscience is not
enough, but they must not intermeddle at all in matters of Religion; but leave
things unsettled in the public, that so the people every where may turn
Atheists, or become Heretics.

Neither is this practice of theirs without example, the Munster Levellers did
the Nec enim id vertiginosis hominibus and ad tu ^as and res nova^d^s crectis
satis videbatur, Libertate^ conscientia^^^ sibi su squs impetrasse, qui^ potius

same. Liberty of Conscience granted them will not serve their turn, but
delighting in noveltie and mutiny, and being ambitious, they must govern and
dispose of all things, and set down what rules and Laws they judge fit.

What they are for Religion you have heard; we are next to consider how they
do express themselves concerning Levelling. N s^u reg^^^^e, qu^ nes^t d
s^^^la^e.
We prosesse (say they) that we never had is in our thoughts to level men's
estates, is being the uttermost of our aim, that the Common wealth be reduced
to such a p^sse, that every man may with as much security as may he enjoy his
propriety. Before we come to discover what this Levelling is, we d sire it
may be noted, that these s^^^e men do grant the thing lawful in it self; for
having set down what they understand by Levelling, Namely, an equalling of men's
estates, and taking away the Right and Title that (...) man has to what is his
own: They say to attempt an ind^^ing t^^ same is most injurious, unless there
did precede an universal assent thereunto from all and every one of the
people. As if they should say, the thing is good, only wanting means and
power at present it must be left till there be a fitter opportunity to do it.

It is one of Machiavels Principles, that Discourses, l. 3. c. 6.
in a Conspiracy against the State, the Complotters thereof must not pass the
number of thr^^ or four. That there is a L^velling design carrying on,
dangerous to the Commonwealth, it is too apparent, and howbeit, bu^ few are
acquainted with the bottom of the work, yet many are, much use of women as
well as men: some to dig, others to dream, some to raise sedition and
hurliburlies in City, Town^ and Country, others to cry out against tyranny,
and for liberty. And all this is to effect one thing, which is, as they say
themselves, thus.

1. They will New Law of righteousness, page 65.58.

any proper Land; particular propriety (...) devilish, the mystery of
Egyptian bondage, a destroying of the Creation, a lifter up of the proud
covetous flesh; a bringer in of the curse again, a mortal enemy to the
Spirit, and that which has brought in all misery upon the creature.

Here they show what their mea^ing is, when they say, A Declaration of the free
Commoners of England.
We declare and protest against all Enclosure of Fennes, Forests, Fields,
Moors, Heaths, Woods, Parks, Chases, which have been taken from the poor of
this Land: We are resolved to do our utmost to restore them again for the
good and benefit of the poor. That is, seeing no man may challenge either house
or land as his own, they will be ay^i^g and assisting each to other, and to all
and every man that shall j in with and assist them in this their Engagement, to
thrust every one ^u^ of his proper and lawful possession, and take the same
for the good and benefit of themselves.

4. It is another doctrine of theirs, contrary to the Law of God, of Nature,
and Nations, that New Law of righteousness, page 60. 61. 69.
no man is to be put to death for murder, or any unrighteous crime whatsoever:
nor to be imprisoned or punished any way; only such are to work and eat
their own bread; and be or they that shall inflict any other punishment upon
fellow creatures, is an unrighteous actor in the Creation: for it is a mighty
dishonor to our Maker, that one part of the Creation should destroy another.
Again; The true Levellers Standard. page 9.
He that will rule over, imprison, oppress, and hill his fellow creatures
under whatsoever pretense, is a destroyer of the Creation, and an actor of the
curse, and walks contrary to the rule of righteousness.

5. If their design hold, they will so Level the Nation, that there shall be
no Light shining in Buck. 1 par. p. 10, 11.
Corporations, Pattents, Charters throughout the Realm, in any City or Town,

Germane Levellers did, and by publishing so much, such as had little means of
their own, and all their hope was upon others, most readily received it.

But you hear them say, they approve not of this L^velling, unless there did
precede an assent from all the people: Here is a cloak so thin, that a man
may see through it; As if these men did not know and love Figures, though they
are ignorant of other learning, and generally hate it. All must be understood

In our Discovery, we shall now in the next place take notice, what these men
say of themselves, for their peaceablenesse, as to reconcile differences, and
to heal all breaches on all sides. An Agreement of the People. p. 1.
We bless God (say they) our Consciences are clear from adding affliction to

the peace and prosperity of the Commonwealth, the Land of our nativitie.

This being don according to their own desire, they afterward reproach i^, and
term the very same thing the faction of a ^^^^terous party of Officers of the
Army rebelling against the Parliament, etc. of pu^pose to flatter the
Malignants and Cavallier^ and by collouging with them to move them to sedition.
W^^ shall not call this a Machiavillian or Jesuiticall plot, for its too
gross, only it shows how desperate they are, as not caring what they say or
unsay, so it he for advantage, and to serve their own turn.

2. How busy they have been in the Army to raise sedition and mutiny amongst
the Soldiers, it is well known, neither has there been any remarkable
distraction or division therein, but by their means: and surely had not the
providence of God wonderfully appeared, they had ^re this time broken and
scattered the Army by their falsehoods and vile aspersions: they have acted by
that Principle, Make division and get Dominion. If a streams be divided, it is
weakened, and it will not be ^avigable when it is cut into many rivers. We
could give many Instances of their traiterous working to cut the Army into many
parts, and that constantly, and in all places through the Land. Besides their
Pamphlets and Libels dispersed amongst the Soldiers, speaking thus.

any thing to any man. And a little after; If you be wise, march not out of

These are the men that would be Instruments, so procuring the peace and
prosperity of this Commonwealth, and call themselves Peacemakers. Whereas no
Malignant can show self good will to the Land, or do more traitorously to
bring ruin and misery upon it. Neither is Mr Walwyn be^^nde-hand in this

And 3. That the fire which they have kindled in the A^^^ may burn till all be

away the water whereby i^ might be quenched: No otherwise then as a Thief, who
ma^ing with a traveller well armed, and perceiving himself t^^ weak for him,
would persuade him, that his weapons are ^^lawfull, and therefore should lay
them down; and this he does purposely to rob and kill the honest man. So these
men would persuade the Army, that The Peoples Prerogatives, page 53, 54, 55.

But wherefore is all this? but for this end, viz. when they have wrought

gross Contradiction, as saying, and unsaying; one while justifying, another

Non-se^ie, at obsurdities and childish passages concerning this thing. There
is enough said by themselves, even where they speak most against Marshall Law,
to justify the Armies proceeding by Marshall Law, and out of their own mouth
to condemn themselves, of ignorance, or malice, or both. For observe, every
Reader that has sense; Their (...) and grand Objection is, Thus no person
ought to be judged by Law Marshall, except in times of War: When there is no
burli-burlie in the Kingdom, no professed or declared enemy against the peace
thereof, ready to destroy it with fire and sworn, but all things are pe^^^ble
and quiet, etc. Marshall Law is not lawful.

Hence we gather (not as Petitio principii, but argumentatio exconcess^, as
they use to say) the lawfulness of Marshall Law by their own Grant. For seeing
they make burli-burlies in the Commonwealth, and declare themselves enemies
unto peace, are In^^ndlar^^^ and Mutiners every where, seeking by fire and
sword to ruin all things, of necessity there must be Marshall Law; their
seditious acting is enough to warrantie: and had we no other apparent enemies
^ut They, it would sufficiently prove, that there is no Act or Statute which
does prohibit the same in this very case. All that they say, may be framed
thus: If Marshall Law at sometimes, and as the condition of a Kingdom maybe,
is not to be exec^ted: ^hen is not Marshall Law at any time lawful, in what
condition (...) ease soever the Kingdom be: such reasoning, and theirs is all
one.

Besides, it ^^^ost evident, that they understand (...) Marshall Law is; for if
they did, they would not sp^^ke (...) ^o^^ntly of Note, that there is no
Statute which prohibits Marshal Law to an A^mie that has been in service and
once used it, so long as the State has upheld it, and stood an Army formaliter.

do recall it, as not having don any thing against lawful Magistrates, but to
Bears and Wolves, and the greatest Traitors that ever were in this Nation.

It is reported of one Theodorius, that having spoken reproachfully of Christ,
to excuse himself he taught, that Christ was mere man, and not God: So these
men, having notoriously abused the Parliament, to defend themselves, say that
they have not spoken against authority, but those Gentlemen stiring as
Westminster, who have forfe^^^d their trust, and so the people disabled from
all obedience and subjection to them. And here is Ma^^^^vels Maxim followed:

places with op^oated and Commotion. They have sought by false suggestions and

Again, they have sought to make discord between the P^^liament and the

and wor^, and at last kills him out of hand.

Before we come to a new discovery, there is one thing here observable: They
have published (and as they think) greatly to the dishonor of Lieutenant
General Cromwell, a speech of his spoken at the Councell-Table, and as they
set it down, it should be to this effect. Bona est misericordia sed non quum
est contra judicium. August. qu. 88. in Ho. Pro. 18.6, 7. and 22.10.

to be a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw-teeth as knives.

frustrate and make void all that work that with so many years industry,
toil, and pain, you have done, and so render you to all rational men, as the
most contemptible generation of silly low-spirited men in the earth, to be
broken and routed by such despiseable contemptible generation of men as they
are: and therefore, Sir, I tell you again, you are necessitated to break them.

Now be it so, that thus he has spoken: What ha^h he don? Was there not a
cause? Is not the thing true, and very necessary it should be don? Is there any
thing in the speech, but what Religion, Reason and Law allow, and strictly call
for it? If Sheba blow a Trumpet of rebellion, Joab justly may require his head,
and it is fit he should die for it. It is an undoubted Rule of Divinity and
Policy, that it is John 11.50. and 18.14.
more expedient that one man die, yea, ten, an hundred, a thousand, then the
whole Nation should perish. Melius est ut pereat unus quam pereat unitas.

a te, ne tu ^o^t. is p^niaris Cyp^ de ^^d pa. ^ te^.
Let the Magistrate punish malefactors (as Incendiaries, and Traitors to the
Commonwealth) least they for them be justly punished.

Whosoever they are that stand for such a generation of men, are like Tiberius,
who would have Caligula to reign, that be might destroy the people. It is
true, If men be ill affected to their Country, and would have all settled
Forms of Government overthrown, Christian Religion extirpated, all humane
societies destroyed, and men deprived of their lawful Liberties, Rights, and
Estates, they cannot desire or wish for fitter Instrument^, and for men that
will surer or sooner bring such mischief and misery upon a Nation.

Having answered to such things as they speak of themselves: Our next work
shall be to observe what they say of others; and here we purpose to take an
exact and full view of all their Tanto falsi testes pe^o^es sunt, quanto
p^^pinquare ve^^tati per calumniam v^lunt. August. de Festo Sancti Steph. Hom.
9.
Papers, Pamphlets, Petitions, etc. which they have published to the world, and
wherein they lay grievous things to the Parliament, the Council of State, and
the Council of War, with high charges, and accusations, against several
persons: and this we will do the more fully, distinctly, and in order, to the
end the Innocent may be quitted and cleared, their calumniation, falsehood, and
traiterous designs discovered, and honest-minded people no longer deceived,
through the hypocrisy and deceit of such men.

Two things are extant, Entitled, Englands New Chains discovered, the first
and second part: A title importing great oppression imposed upon them by the
present supreme Authority of this Nation: but wherein they felt or suffered
any such thing, as yet they have not showed, neither does their serious
apprehensions, or sad Representation manifest so much. Some children will tear
and scratch their Mother in the face, and then cry out as if they had been
beaten or abused; whereas there is nothing don to them, but only they wronged
their Mother. Many wrongs and injuries have they offered unto several men, and
afterward have cried out and complained, as if they were the sufferers; Whereas
Witness L. General Cromwell, who has patiently born Lilburnes reproaches and
scandalous speeches, and d^n him good for evil: as he acknowledges himself
thus: I must acknowledge you took compassion of me in my bonds and chains,
even when I was at deaths do^e, and was principally isntrumental in delivering
me from the very gates of death, in An. 1640. And setting me free from the long
and heavy Tyranny of the Bishops and Star Chamber, even at that time when I was
almost spent: and many particular respects since then, and one large token you
sent me since I came, etc. J^nahs cry out of the Whales belly, page 2.
nothing by the others was don to them, but a patient passing by of all their
insolences and abuses; and making good that Maxim, much agreeable to wisdom,
that just deeds are the best answer to injurious words.

We shall speak first, to the first part of their New Chain: Omitting
nothing, saving their vain repetitions, calumniations, idle, frothy, and
impertinent passages. First, they complain against erecting a high Court of
Justice for trial of criminal causes. To which we answer.

1. Were they not bent to sedition, they would not mention a thing which by the
Parliaments power may lawfully be don (and These will n^^ allow of tha^ Rule;
Auth^^tiatem ma^^^um etiam in illicius exc^sa^e. C. Dixit 14 q. 5.
they know it too) and for no other end, but to sooth and flatter Malignants,
and to provoke them to greater rage and wrath against the Parliament, and High
Court of Justice, for their late just proceedings against capital offenders.

2. Whereas they speak of persons pick^ and chosen as a usual policy to
introduce by such means all usurpations. Herein they discover great
uncharitableness, and extreme malice, and walk contrary to Scripture and Law:
The word of God teaches us when speeches or actions doubtful in themselves,
and may be taken either well or ill, we are to interpret them in the 1 Cor.
13.7. Deuteronomy. 22.25, 26, 27.
best part. So says the Law; Dubium in meliorem partem accipiendum L. cum
creditor. de furtis.
A doubtful action is to be taken in the better part. In re dubia benigniorem
semper fieri interpretationem. L. proxime C. de his quae intest. del.
Again; In a doubtful thing, the fairer interpretation must be made: So
again; Nobiliores praesumptiones semper in dubiis eligendas: L. merito pro
socio.
In doubts the nobler presumptions are to be chosen. But these Rules are never
followed by Conspirators against the Commonwealth: but on the other hand,
actions howsoever in themselves very good, (as was this high Court of Justice)
and cordially don, shall be depraved by malicious insinuations, as if by-ends
and self-interest were intended, or some public detriment would follow: and
this has been practiced formerly by 2 Samuel 10.3, 4. and 15.3, 4.
Incendiaries, proud Mat. 9.34.
hypocrites, and by the Job 1.10. Rev. 18.10.
Devil ((...)) the false accuser or makebate taught them. Besides it is well
to be noted, how in all the things set forth by this party, there is little
said, saving Inserunt querelas, and ambiguos de Magistratu sermones, quaeque
alia turbulenta vulgi. Tac: hist. 1.
forged insinuations against the Parliament, the Council of State, and the
Army, as if they would do this, and that, to oppress the people, whereas
nothing was ever so intended, neither had they any ground or cause for such
jealousies and aspersions, but have given them forth, of purpose to disturb,
unquiet, and trouble the Nation.

3. These men do see Englands new Chain, page 3.
the way of trial by twelve men to be a Constitution so equal and just, as
that they conceive it ought to remain unalterable.

But first, What if there should be thirteen or thirty, or more or less, were
it not as well and just: Rational men can distinguish between substance and De
minimis considerationem non habendam. L. scio de integ. restit.
circumstance, between what is necessary and essential to a thing, what
indifferent, and so may be don or not don (without danger) as occasion is. 2.
In other Countries for trial of criminal causes, their proceeding is not by
Quere, If the Judge only should examine the witnesses, and thereupon proceed:
whether it would not be for the profit and ease of the people: b^s^ness^^ so
^er (...) p^^ched, and p^obably more just and legal trials.
twelve sworn men, but otherwise, and yet equal and just in it self. And
howsoever we shall not speak against this way, yet this we affirm, it is to
be reckoned among the Error in sylla^a n^n vit^at actum. L^ qui habebat: A le
Manu test: doc.
adiaphorme^ or Ceremonies of the Law, a thing so indifferent, whether the
number be twelve or twenty, that the Magistrate may salely either continue it,
or change it as he sees cause. But 3. was it ever known before, that men should
be blamed, for their study, care, and wisdom, to do a thing well. If their
objection here against the high Court of Justice be duly weighed, it will
appear as evident as the Sun at noon day, that because the Parliament made
choice of, able, judicious, and conscientious men, and called many such
together, to the end they might proceed legally, impartially, as of sincerity,
as of God, in the sight of God, therefore they speak evil of them. Things
looked on under water, howbeit straight, smooth and fair, yet standing so,
appear as if they were crooked, rough, deformed: So this Generation of men,
looking upon the actions of the Parliament, the Council of State, and Army,
with an envious eye, they turn (like Spiders) the best and most wholesome
things into poison: For what the one does faithfully, uprightly, and for
public good; the other calls it hypocrisy, tyranny, self-seeking, New Chains,
etc. Pro. 27.4. ^^r fell ama^um per lingu e ^^^^mentum ^^ge^e not a^^ara non
potest. Bernard.
But who is able to stand before envy?

2. They complain for censuring a Member of the House for declaring his
judgment in a point of Religion.

Answ. 1. Here we may see, that saying to be most true; Fact^tus da^ (...)
^^nem, (...) super^^^.
It is easier to find fault, then to give a reason for it. What the Parliament
did in this thing, it was upon that ground, and Maxim i^ Law, that
D^l^o^^iarum (...) penitus remne^ las. l ae ^uissimum (...) usu fruct. l. (...)
pater sect. (...) simis de l. (...) 2.
all occasions of discord ought altogether to be taken away. The speech was
neither useful, nor seasonable, no way tending to the public good, but
dishonorable to the House, scandalous to our profession, and Religion,
obstructive to the present work of Reformation, and Romans 16.17.
causing divisions and offenses. 2. For the Reserve in the Agreement concerning
Religion: If they mean that the Parliament has agreed that any blasphemous and
heretical doctrine shall be propounded and defended in the House, we Naturalis
ete^^^n and jus gen^^^n dictat ac ^^^s^^it, ut religio nobis curae sit, and
omnia quae ad eam promovendam ac conservandam spectant pro virili procuremus.
J^ach^m: Sho^husi de Blasphem. l. 3. c. 35 p. 426.
know of no such thing: neither do we know what Reason that Member had, to
speak there what he did, until the House had declared that it should be free
for every Member to propound in Parliament points of that nature. 3. Here we
desire that all people in all places, will take notice, what Englands new
Chain is, and what the burden and oppression is, which they so much speak of:
Because the Parliament will not countenance blasphemy and heresy, suffer it to
be just fi^d in the House, and taught publicly cum privilegio, they cry out,
Tyrants, Murderers, Thieves: Indeed this is the great and grand business,
Religion and Orthodox Doctrines are not (as they desire and seek for) cast off
and utterly rejected.

A third thing which has brought England into new Chains, it, the Act for
pressing of Seamen, directly contrary to the Agreement of the Officers.

Answ. 1. There is Nulla tam sancta lex est, quam non oporteat, si salus populi
postulet, urgeatque necessitas mutare. Bod. de Repub. l. 4. Herman: Ki^chner.

some where) cited; it is expressly said, that where nec^ssitie requires, men
may be compelled to arm themselves and go to war. It is true, such as are
fit and serviceable, whether for. Sea or Land, Opera militaria debentur quoque

Frid: Wendelin: Inst. Polit. lib. 2. c. 17. page 242.
should serve the State willingly, whereby the Commonwealth might be defended,
and peace preserved: N^verthelesse, in case of refusal, they may be pressed and
compeld, Reason and Religion say as much, if necessity and the present safety
of the Land call for it. But this was the Parliaments case, and the reason of
that Act, namely, St. 15. Ed. 3. 7. St. 4. Hen. 4. 13. 25. Ed. 3 8
For the defense of the Realm, and sudden coming of strange enemies into it.

But 2. As in other things, so in this, their conspiracy and treason against
the Commonwealth, notably appears, in seeking the destruction of it both by
Land and Sea: For howsoever (as we said) the safety of the people required this
Act, neither was there any other way or means visibly to prevent eminent and
sudden danger. Nevertheless, they speak against it, cry ou^, New Chains,
Tyranny, Bondage, Oppression, etc. And why all this? But to make the Seamen
mutinous and seditious, as they have don the Soldiers: by falsehood and
traiterous insinuation to have them believe, that it is indeed oppression and
tyranny for the Supreme Authority of the people, to press men upon any
occasion, and by this means cause the Sailers to turn against the Parliament,
as against Tyrants and Oppressors, and not obey them as their right and
lawful Rulers: and this is their work all along. And therefore high time it
should be looked into; for as one truly says, Unhappie Prosperity, first
History, page 180. Indulgentia and lenet de Magistratus ^min sed tionis ansa
praebit: quia dum quicsc^re magistratus officia plebs vid^t, nullisque legumse

Instit. Polit. l. 3. c. 2. p 492.
A Magistrate who has discovered a Conspiracy, and seems fearful to remedy
it, is as faulty as the Conspirator himself.

4. They tells us, they Englands new Chain second part, page 14.
want freedom, and are in Chains, because the Parliament stops their mouths
from printing.

Answ. 1. Here we may use their own words, That it is a sure and radical
Maxim in Law, Nihil quod est contra rationem est licitum: Nothing which is
against reason is lawful. To which may be added; L^vim de sust. and sur l.
scientiam. cur ad A quid.
Against force and injury it is lawful to use defense: Likewise, Licet vim vi
repellere. When Demosthenes would set forth the improvidence and
incircumspection of the Athenians, presented to them an innocent Fool, who
being smitten on the cheek, laid his hand on the place where he had received
the blow; and being stricken on the other cheek, did the like, never using any
of his hands to defend himself from further blows. Such Idiots and
Silly-bodies they would have the State to be, stand still, and suffer them,
with their seditious and scandalous Libels to strike them as often as they
please, and through their sides to wound and destroy the Commonwealth. But
observe what they say in their own case; Overto^t Appeal, page 3, 4.
It is a firm Law and radical principle in nature, engraven in the Tables of
the heart by the finger of God in the Creation, for every living moving thing,
wherein it the breath of life, Overto^s Appeal, page 3.
to preserve, award, and deliver it self from all hurtful things, destructive
and obnoxious thereto, to the uttermost of his power. If this be true, surely
then, the Parliament should not follow a radical principle in nature, to
suffer them to publish their traiterous and licentious Pamphlets, seeing there
is nothing more hurtful, destructive, and obnoxious to the peoples safety
then the same.

2. Such as prescribe Remedies against Conspiracies, give this as the first and
principal, namely, Petrus Gregorius, lib. 23. de Remp.
To prevent and cut off (if possible) the occasion, that it may not break
forth. Clem. Templ. Polit. lib. 4. cap. 7. page 424.

see not that Books and Papers, containing calumniations and falsehood against
Authority (under what color or pretense soever, as for liberty, and to have
taxes and burdens removed) are fire, even wildfire in a Commonwealth, a
storm and whirlwind indeed, enough (if not prevented) to burn and throw
down all things: and to prove this, we need not go further, then the present
example of these As the firefly leapes and dances in the fire: so it is their

unhappy men.

3. Men who have acted by the Principles of Reason and Nature, (knowing
praevisa minus laedunt, things foreseen do less hurt;) have always been
careful to stop the publishing of seditious books: Hence Plato l. 10. de
Republ.
Plato, Plutarch. lib. de Civils administrat. o^e.
Plutarch, and the wisest of the Gentiles, in their Models and Platformes of
Civil Government, have evermore given order, that Famosi libelli convitia,
contumelia, detractiones publicae sunt a magistratu coercendae, ut pax inter
cives maneat. Plato. l. 11. de legibus.
infamous Writings should not be permitted, such as contained calumniations and
reproaches, and tended to mutiny and division; but the Authors and Promoters
thereof punished. Neither are there any Christian Libellos famosos, sive
pasquillos magistratus spargi prohibeat, eorumque authors and disseminatores
graviter coerceat. Keckerm. System: Polit. l. 1 c. 22. p. 358.
Statesmen, but in their Republics and Polities do say as much: And so much
has been ever practiced by all States. And in some of our own Statutes it is
declared, that 5. Ed. 6.11.
Whosoever by Writing shall affirm the King to be a Tyrant, an Usurper, etc.
it is high Treason. Again; Philip and Mar. 3. 1 Eliz. 6.
If any by Books, Rymes, Ballads, Letters, or Writing, shall publish false,
seditious, and slanderous things against the King or Queen, his right hand is
to be stricken off for it; and if he do so again, to suffer imprisonment
during his life.

And here we may Reason from the less to the greater; if for Writing falsely or
seditiously against the King, it be a crime deserving the cutting off the right
hand, or perpetual imprisonment; and to call him Tyrant or Usurper, be high
Treason by Law, it must needs then in our understanding necessarily follow,
that to write the like against the supreme Authority of the people, whose
power is greater then the Kings, and their place above him; is as high and
capital a crime, y^^ and by the same Statute deserves the like punishment. The
truth is, it is beyond our apprehension, how for words wri^^^ against the So

servant, the Writer by such a Statute shall commit high treason, and yet the
same words written against the So is the Parliament being the Representatours

Master not found so by that Statute. If Law be reason (as it must be, or else
it is no Law,) then thus speaks Law with Reason. Si id quod minus verisimile
est, verum est, and id etiam erit, quod magis verisimile videt^r. Pet. Fonsec.
Instit. dialect. lib. 7. c. 29.
If that which is less likely be true, then will that be also, which appears
more likely. That Statute which finds a man guilty of high treason, and justly
condemns him for it, for words against the infectour and lesser power: that
same Statute will find a man also, guilty of high treason, and justly condemn
him for it, for the like words against the superior and greater power.

4. Whereas they would help themselves by mentioning Stapleton, Hollis, the
Prelates etc. This is not tali modo, but a Sophisme, (...) ad illud quod dictum
est (...). Because Pilate did not well in condem^ing Christ: therefore he did
ill to condemn the thieves. But here we cannot but smile, to observe wherefore
they would have the Press open to them; namely because, so they would discover
all treacherous and tyrannical designs. And is there not probability for
this? Will not Satan cast out Satan? Has not the Parliament reason to believe,
that they who call them Thieves, Tyrants, Murderers, etc. declare and protest
against all their Votes, Orders, O^dinances, Declarations, and Acts, as not
binding to the people: Provoke the Soldiers and Commoners every where to insu
rection and rebellion: If they had more liberty to print their Conspiracies and
Falsehoods against the Parliament, Council of State, and the Army, and to
spread them all the Counties and Country over, they would do the State less
hurt, and better service.

5. We suppose they will now object no more against the Parliament for
employing that Englands new Chain, part second, page 14.
Apostate Judas (as they call him) at an Ex^cutioner to search after unlicensed
Books: being One Mr. Haide^ whom the Levellers have lately secretly murdered;
and Thomson the Arch-traytor was a chief actor in it.
themselves have don execution upon him; murdered him in a most barbarous and
cruel manner: and therein showed to the Nation what the Native birth right is,
the Common-Freedome and safety they talk of: If th y get power into the^^
hands, to stab and kill whosoever opposes them: and why not? seeing (according
to their Belief) there is no Heaven nor hell, no punishment or suffering after
this life, for murder, or any wickedness whatsoever. And so much appears by
that Atheistical and hellish Counsel suggested by Walwyn to a Woman lying
under a sore and heavy temptation. Walwyns Wile page 12. Note, that the poor
woman did as the wretched man persuaded her, strangled her self.
That it was ^b^se and ignoble thing for any one to lie under such trouble,
anguish, and perplexity, as could not well be endured, having so easy and
speedy a way of riddance out of it, as is before every man, and that it was an
honorable and valiant thing, for a man in such a case to put an end to his
life, by laying violent hands upon himself, being a far shorter w^y of ease,
then any other way.

We hope the And so for the rest following take notice how we shall show thee
their conspiracy against the State in every particular, one after another.
Reader does all along take notice, that there is not one thing which they do
take up against the Parliament, as pretending it to be a new Chain,
oppression, tyranny, etc. But it is clearly to be seen, that thereby some
great mischief and traiterous design is intended to the Land: There is
nothing of late more complained of, then this, about stopping the Press: But
how justly we have showed, and shall only add, that these men, who by their
seditious Writings, and other treacherous ways, have already made Commotions
and hutli-burlies amongst us, and have sought from time to time to destroy this
Commonwealth, are so far from being suffered to do so again, as that they
ought to suffer death for what they have don already: and so says the Reus est

5. But the great business is about the Council of State; at this they are
extremely offended: and no marvel, for they who seek to have all Laws, and
old Courts of Justice Levelled and put down, cannot take it well, that any new
should be erected, especially such a one, as they see is a main obstacle and
let to their Conspiracy and Treason, and a Court which they fear will be (
Jachin and Boaz) as two Pillars for the establishment and strength of the
Nation.

But let us now see their Reasons, wherefore they would have Englands new
Chain, page 12.
this present Council of State dissolved.

Ibid. page 2.
1. Because as the cause now stands they MAY design to perpetuate their power,
and keep off Parliaments for ever.

Answ. 1. Howsoever the Wolf sometimes keeps in, and shows not his cruelty
and rapine by his bloody mouth, yet long he cannot dissemble, but what is
within will appear: We have before given a hint of their slanderous
insinuations: Where things are right, and very good, and no just exception can
be made against them (as in this case here touching the Council of State) then
they seek to possess the people with jealousies and fears, as what MAY BE.
The plot indeed is too sh^llow, too absurd and foo^ish, wher^by any judicious
and knowing men should be deceived. It being no more then thus; A man should
throw away his meat, money, armor, etc. because such things may do him harm:
the expression whereof is conviction sufficient.

But 2. were not these men, either blinded with prejudice, or thought that the
people would take every thing from them without any consideration, it could not
be, that so groundless, ir^ationall and senseless an objection would have
been made: For what can the Council of State do in relation to the
Parliament, as either to keep off Parliaments, or to keep them on. The truth
is, they might as well have They a^e against all Courts and Magist^ates, as
against the Council of State; only they perceive the^e is no need to meddle
with such things; for if they can break the Parliament, Council of State, and
Army, all the Courts and Magistrates of the Nation must fall and be dissolved
therewith.
Petitioned the House, to dissolve the present Courts of the Chancerie,
Exchequer, and put down all the Judges, Justices, Mayors, and Constables in the
Land, for the C^uncell of State can no more hinder or keep the Parliament from
sitting then they: nay, if diverse circumstances be weighed, they are less able
to do the thing here suggested then the others can do; especially some of
them.

Thus not only do they declare a malicious heart, to make conclusions in the
worst part before they know any thing; but also show themselves desperately
seditious, as not to regard how improbable and impossible the thing is, so it
may make disturbance, and raise up the spirits of the people against their
Rulers. But enough of this; we will leave them to the censure of that Calum

Law, who being calumniators and detractors, set Burn Marks on their forehead
for infamous people.

2. They do object against the Council of State, because they are England n^w
Cha^^e, page 7.
p^ssessed with power to order and dispose all the Forces appertaining to
England, by Sea or Land, to dispose of the public treasure, to command any
person whatsoever before them, to give oath for the discovering of truth, to
imprison any that shall disobey their commands, and such as they shall judge
contumatious.

There is nothing in this which requires an answer, Would it be a good argument
to prove Mr. Lilburn a Coward or tray^or to the Army, because he was chosen
Lievt. Col. or rather because he was chosen to such a place it argues he was
thought then valiant, faithful, etc.
for the greater the matters are which are referred to the Council, it argues
the ability and faithfulness of the men to be the more, and the Parliament
knowing so much, has committed such great things to their trust.

But 1. Were not these men ignorant of Maxims in Law and Reason, they would
observe, that Cui Jurisdictio data est, ci quoque concessa esse videntur sine
quibus Jurisdictio expl^cari non potuit. Digest. Jurisdict. Tit. 1.
to whom a Jurisdiction is given, unto it such things are necessarily granted,
without which nothing can be don. When a man is Constituted, a Judge, Justice
of Peace, or Mayor, it must be presupposed, that he has power given him, to
officiate and act such things as appertain to that function or calling. But
observe the absurdity, and stupiditie of these men; they do not deny ( That
which is don by the Parliament is called first stable and sanctum, and is taken
for Law. Sm^th: Commonwealth of E^gland. l. 2. Ch 2.
neither indeed can they) but the Parliament l^wfully may erect such a
Council, only they find fault, because they have power to act the things
which properly belong to such a State.

2. It seems there is no way to escape the scourge of these men's tongues;
Because the manifold pressures and sorrowe^ of the people are not removed,
peace, liberty, freedom established; the Parliament for this, is every where
reproached by them. Again, Whereas the Parliament endeavors (and for that
end, is this Council of State erected) to take away the burdens, oppressions,
and miseries of this Nation, and to settle the Commonwealth of England upon
Principles of Righteousness, freedom, and safety, according to their
several Expresses and Declarations: for this also does the same party speak
evil of them. This shows they are men of some par^s, that they can as
handsomely put a reproach and scandal upon the Magistrates, for doing well, as
for doing nothing. But in the mean time, their hypocrisy and baseness is the
more obvious and manifest to all unbiassed and impartial people: for who,
unless men most impudent, would pretend a desire, to have burdens removed,
Ireland relieved, our Forces by Land and Sea well look unto, and provided for,
the public treasure carefully disposed of, and when they see all this is don,
to speak evil of the State, and for no other reason, but because the same is
don as they desired, or at least pretended so.

And to the end their malice and mischief to the Land may the more appear in
reproaching the Parliament for erecting this Council of State, Let it be
considered: 1. What (...). Zenop: 8. Poed.

Principles and Maxims set down by all judicious and learned Politicians in the
world. These particulars we could enlarge, but it needs not; for envy it self
can find nothing here, whereby to oppose, or to raise any contradiction, or
objection against these Assertions.

But 3. Their objection seems to lie chiefly against the persons, that is,
some particular Members of the Council of State, and this is more then likely,
even certain; and gives us an occasion to remember a pretty fable of
Demosthenes, how the Wolves made a league of peace with the Sheep, so that the
dogs might be removed; but when the dogs were put away, the sheep were worried.
There are in the Parliament, Council of State, and Army, some men whom they
perceive are special bars and lets to their pernicious designs: these they
would willingly have removed, to the end they might easily devour the poor
sheep of this Nation; their safety, freedom, laws; and so their Estates
become a prey to them.

But let us see who they are that the Wolves would have removed.

no doubt would do had they power) displaced all such Officers as stood in
their way, and set others in their room, whom they thought would help forward
their design, to ruin and destroy the Commonwealth.

2. The Judges of the Law. Here likewise we know their meaning: Its confusion

a land of darkness, as darkness it self, and as the shadow of death,
without any order, and where the light is as darkness: neither are they
ignorant of the ready way and means how to bring it in, and make it so: take
the light away, and darkness must needs follow: Remove men skillful and expert
in the Law, and there will be no need to bring in absurdities, non sense,
fooleries; for these things of themselves will flow fast enough, and overflow
the Nation. Again, that men should be excepted against, as incapable to be
members of any Civil Court, or Council of State, because Judges of the Law;
it is an objection we are confident, never before heard of, or propounded by
any one. What may be objected in regard of personal unfitness, is one thing:

in reference to his profession, Quatenus, as a Judge of the Law, and therefore
unfit, it is the most senseless thing that ever was uttered. It is no
otherwise then to make a man unfit to take the charge of a Ship, or to be
appointed the Pilate, or Master, because he is a skillfull and experienced
Seaman.

3. Treasurers of money: And why not? It will be time enough to give a farther
answer when we know the cause and ground wherefore such are excepted against.
In the mean while, we entreat the Reader to observe one thing usual with these
men, which is to mention many things, but not at all to the purpose for which
they bring them. Only amongst the ^t is a Cannon amongst the Papists, De

ignorant, whom they seek to beguile, they think it is enough if any thing be
spoken, because they will ^ot, or cannot consider the impertinencies, flashes,
and nothings, which they find in their Papers.

Their fourth Exception is against Members of the Lords House, and some of the
House of Commons, ^orward men in the Treaty, and decliners of the last
proceeding, concerning the King and Lords.

To which we answer.

1. These give occasion here, of verifying that Proverb; a ^er has need of a
good memory. The Parliaments proceeding with the K^^g, is one thing against
which they do Englands n^w Ch^i^e, second part, ^^g. 17, 18.
protest; and yet in this place d^e blame others for decli^ing it: thus the
thing which in themselves is a virtue and good, the very same in another is a
vice, and a fault: So that they are not in practice like a Ship in the midst of
the Sea, but rather run like Cart-wheels, easily to be followed by the f^ule
tracts of Note, none called more upon the Parliament for Justice against the

other end, but to make way for t^eir a^solute Dominion. Englands new Chain,

contradiction, falsehood, and hyp^crisie.

2. They are here at their old game, to make division between the Parliament,
and the Council of State: you have heard before, how they have been every
where else, and something they must do likewise here; for nothing is more
grievous to them, then to see an accord and union between our Rulers. Neither
do they regard to play the hypocrites before the world, so they may th^re^y
raise contention. But the truth is, their wiles and way^s now are so palpably
gr^sse, as there is little fear that any hereafter will be deceived by them,
unless it be some of their own faction, or We mean the Cavaliers.
such as seek to take advantage by their treachery to b^ing to pass their own
designs.

But 3. there are ^one ^f the Lords House, neither of the House of Commons,
Members of the Council of State, which did any thing in rel^tion to the
Treaty, or declined that last proceeding, but do rest satisfied in what is
don, are real, cordial, and true to the Land, and cl^ze unanimously with the
rest for common good: and therefore t^eir scrupling formerly of some things,
does no way dis^bl^ them from the present service of the State; especially
having been approved men, known to be faithful, and of right and good
Principl^s. Indeed had they been Levellers, restless and treacherous, and
sowers of sedition, there had been just cause of excepti^n against them: but
being men altogether of another spirit, peaceable, and Peacemakers, it was
well they were chosen; for n^ doubt (through Gods blessing on their labor)
much pr^fit and comfort will follow.

5. They except against such as were Judges in the Star-chamb^r, and approvers
of the bloody and tyrannical sentences issuing from thence.

Answ. We showed just now, that it is If the Reader desire to see this to the
life, let him observe their Book, entitled, The picture of the Council of
State; Wherein they have blotted four sheets, and published two Editions, and
not one word from first to last which comes near the matter to which they
should have spoken: and so much we shall manifest presen ly.
all one to these men, whether there be something, or nothing in their
Writings: for to a simplician, a superficious and shallow Reader, there is no
d^ff^rence or distinction made: sense or nonsense, reason or railing, all is
alike. Can there be imagined, an exception, more light, irrational,
groundless: For what if a man had been a member of the High Commission Court,
or of the Popes Conclave, this could not be any just bar, whereby he should
be disabled from any future office, place, or employment, if nothing else did
appear, and the person otherwise in every respect fitted and qualifi^d for the
work.

Thus we have answered their Exceptions, and vindicated the Council from their
Calumniati^ns. One thing yet remains, which concerns their Book, Entitled,
The Picture of the Council of State. Here is a fit place to discover the
vanity and folly of it, especially so far as the Council of State is any
way concerned in it.

And here in the first place we shall desire the Reader to take notice, of the
original and moving cause, wherefore the State apprehended them.

Not only had these men a long time, to the certain kn^wledge of the Council
of War, attempte^ We h^ve formerly in p^rt manifest^d so much, to with shortly

by several ways to make divisi^n in the Army, and likewise by the Parliam
nt were looked upon (and that for many reasons) to b^ g^e^t I^c^^diaries, men
most d^ngerous and seditious: but withal had m^de a traiterous Book, and
spread it abroad, and sought to draw others into the Conspiracy with them;
clearly tending to the loss of Ireland, and the utter ruin of this Nation by
a n^w war. This being known, and the great peril and mischief apprehended,
the Parliament thereupon (an Pe^^aru^ irrogatio tam ^^t c^ns^^vandae R^p:

fit they should, and high time it was) gave Comm^ssion and Order unto the
Council of State for the apprehending and securing of these mutineers. The
Council accordingly appointed some Officers of the Army to see the
Parliaments command ex^cuted: and because it was well known, that there were
some se^i^us people in and about the City, confederates with them, and ready
to make any hurli-burlie and commotion: it was thought the best and safest way
to prevent tumult, and other i^ c^nv^^^^ce, to apprehen^ them in the night; the
which being done, and the (...) brought before the Council, it was there
showed them by the Lord President, by what Authority they were sent for, and
the reason why: Unto which their Answ^r was required: And thus much in brief
for the occasion.

Now for their Answer, if it be obse^ved, either what they spoke to the
Council, or is contained in their additions since, with the many quotations of
Statures and marginall notes; it amounts to just nothing; for first i^ page 3,
4. there is only a frivolous relation, as when, and how they were apprehended,
and by whom, from page 5. to 17. Whatsoever carries any show of something, it
is thus, and nothing else: We are Englishmen, and so in a legal capacity to
claim the utmost punctilio, benefit, and privilege, that the Laws and
liberties of England will afford to any man in the whole Nation. We know not
what to make more of you, then a company of private men, being neither able to
own you for It is published by themselves, that the L. Presidet did not ask
them any question, as in way of trial, so as to proceed in Judgment, but to
report it to the House: In which words (howbeit, but few) there was enough said
to justify the Council, and to show their igno^a^ce, that they should not
observe them, as to speak something thereto.
a Court of Justice, because the Law speaks nothing of you. Again, The people
of this Nation have not betrusted the Parliament with a Law-executing power.

This is the most, and all, in all their tedious and long Discours^, which
looks like something, the rest is either railing at others, or boasting of
themselves. But is there one word in all this to the cause in hand? Is it not
Ignorantia Elenchi? and as the Proverb is, Ego de alliis loquor, tu respondes
de cep^^.
One asks for Garlic, and the other speaks of Onions.

For 1. Let it be granted, they are Englishmen, and so may claim the liberties
and privileges of the Law: yet it does not follow, but for Conspiracy and
Treason against the State, they lawfully may be apprehended. Again, say the
Parliament be not entrusted with a Law-executing power: yet no man will deny,
but the supreme Authority of this Nation, are entrusted with a Law-making
power; that is, they may Note, that th^re was nothing don by the Council of
State against those me^, intefe^e^ce to their own jurisdiction and power, but
as they were the Parliaments Commissioners, and had command and order from them
to act so and so: and therefore that which the Council did herein was no more
but what any other men in the like case might and ought to have done. For the
Parliament, without dispute, can empower and authorize any man or men to
apprehend and examine traitors, and finding cause, by the said delegated power
to commit them, that they may be tried afterward according to Law.
design and appoint whomsoever they think best and fittest to apprehend such
men whom they understand to be making sedition and raising war in the Land,
to the end they may be brought forth to trial, according to the known Law
provided in that case. But here they are silent, and no wonder, for indeed a
plain relation of the thing as it stood, had been enough to prove their
apprehension, examination, and commitment, all to be legal: But their manner
is, what is clear, to darken with a heap of confused words, or omitting the
matter unto which they should directly speak, to run away with some impertinent
and bything.

There is no other thing that we know charged upon the Council of State, as
for the slanders, falsehoods and treason set forth in that book, we shall very
shortly come to the discovery thereof: with the rest of their conspiracies and
seditions in their other Papers. At this time it shall suffice that we have
wiped off all their calumniations and reproaches against the Honorable and
great Council of this Nation.

The next place unto which they bring us, is the Council of War: and here we
find their main body, and the great ordnances planted, of untruth,
treachery, contradiction, sedition, and what not? In the first part of their
new chain there is very little, comparatively, to what is published in the
second part. We purpose (if God will) in our Discovery, to go through both,
that so the Nation may the better see and judge what a generation of men they
are.

First then of the Council of War, this they say: by their means Englands new
Chain, page 9.
after these fair bloss^mes of hopeful liberty, breaks forth this bitter fruit
of the vilest and basest bondage, that ever Englishmen groaned under.

Answ: 1. We may see in these men what Vincere consuetudinem, dura est pugna.
Aug: super Psalm. 30.
an hard thing it is, to leave a bad custom: when it is to plead for mutinous
Soldiers, and to encourage them in their refractorie and seditious courses,
then we shall hear them speak of good days, In their Letter to his
Excellency, April 27. 1649.
Times of peace, all Courts of Justice are open. But if it be to reproach the
Army, they can make their tongues to say quite contrary, nothing then but
bondage; yea, the vilest and basest that ever Englishmen groaned under: not
regarding what hypocrisy they show by their gross contradiction, so they may
do some mischief one way or other.

2. There is a Letter extant of Lilburnes, wherein he expresses himself to his
Excellency thus: Juglers discovered.
Truly (Sir) give me leave to tell you without fear or dread, had I come, and
could have got so many to have followed me, as would have enabled me with my
sword in my hand, to have done justice and execution, upon those grand
treacherous fellows, and tyrants at Westminster, that have not only tyrannized
over me, but the whole Nation; I should have made no more scruple of conscience
with my own hand to have destroyed them, then to have destroyed so many weasels
or poulcats.

If he would then have knocked down the Parliament Men like weasels and
poulcats, what would he now do? seeing the Nation was never in the like

But wherein are we brought to the vilest and basest bondage that ever

nothing out, which they have produced, and set down to prove the same. Englands
new Chain, p 8, 9.
At a meeting of No^e how they say not a General Council of War, but a
meeting of Officers: So that there are three Courts with they deny, and say they
are unlawful, viz. the Parliament, Council of State, and the Council of
War.

conscientious part of the Soldiery and others, it was insisted upon (as we
are from credible hands certainly informed) that a motion should be made to
this House for the procurement of a law enabling them to put to death all such
as they should judge by Petitions or otherwise to disturb the present
proceedings; and upon urging that the Civil Magistrate should do it, it was
answered, That they could hang twenty ere the Magistrate one. It was likewise
urged, that Orders might be given to seize upon the Petitioners, Soldiers, or
others, at their meetings. A Proclamation was likewise appointed, forbidding
Soldiers to petition you, or any but their Officers, prohibiting their
correspondencies: And private Orders to be given out for seizing upon Citizens
and Soldiers at their meetings.

Answ: 1. Seeing these things were brought to them but by report, it is beyond
our apprehension how such a bondage can be sufficiently proved by hearsay. 2.
At most (take their own relation which is false) the things were but only
insisted upon, and will that conclude the vilest and basest bondage that ever?
etc. But 3. for reasoning sake, let it be granted, that such things were not
only insisted upon, but by the Parliament had been granted, and afterward put
in execution; yet all this would not have amounted to the vilest and basest
bondage: for the English, since they were a Nation, have many times groaned
under a greater bondage. But we need not follow them so exactly, for the truth
is, they so much mind sedition and calumniation, as they mind not what
absurdities, contradictions and falsehoods may every where be observed, and
noted in their words and writings.

But more particularly: here many things forged and false are heapd together:
neither is there any one thing truly related by them. For, 1. It is an
accusation grounded upon a lie, that any thing should be spoken about putting
to death and no less a Reader, we have made a strict enquiry about this thing,
and it is avowed, that there was not any such speech: what might be in secret
they know not: but openly in the Court it is utterly denied.
slander that any man should say, they could hang twenty ere the Magistrate
one. We shall give the Reader here a just account of the thing as it was. Upon
many complaints made by some Soldiers of several wrongs done them in the
Country, it was propounded, whether it were not expedient that some course
might be thought of, for to prevent such miscarriages, specially seeing they
had not means to follow the Law, neither could they do it, by reason of
continual duty, and marching from place to place: besides, seeing the
Soldier either made satisfaction, or was punished, if he offended: why should
not the Soldier in some like speedy way be relieved? This was the whole
business which they by the Rule of multiplication, call putting to death.

2. For such which they speak of, not of the Army, they are careful to conceal
both what was said, and why: In brief therefore thus: The Officers observing
this party to be continually laboring by their Adjutators to cause more
division in the Army, besides the many former breaches which they had made,
conceived it was necessary that some speedy course and way should be taken,
that themselves, the Army, and the whole Nation might not be undone, through
the conspiracy and sedition of a few restless and unquiet people, this they
call bondage, and probably to them it seems no less. For as a sore eye looks
not without pain and grief on the Sun: so no doubt to them it is a Quem me^uunt
oderunt: quem (...) ^dit, pe^^^^se expetit. Cic. de offic: 11.
sore, a plague, a torment, an hell upon each to look on the Council of War
(we may add the Parliament, and Council of State) in the condition of
safety, peace, and honor, as then it was, and through Gods mercy is so still.

Sta^dard, page 5.
for a Law to have power in themselves to put to death any person not of the
Army as shall hold any discourse with Soldiers about their own and the peoples
just Rights and Liberties. To this there needs no further answer: only this we
shall add, if the insolences and bold attempts of some special Incendiaries,
had been in time more looked too, and suppressed, much misery and mischief, which
has since fallen out, would have been prevented.

It is true the Commanders of the Army have not been without their fear: for
they have foreseen this rising in seditious and treacherous plots from time to
time; but observe the notable craft of the Levelling party, whenever they
began to move in a way to suppress such things, they presently put an
aspersion and odium upon them, as that the Army would rule all, take all power
into their hands, hang up, and put to death all persons, etc. by which devise
they went the surer and faster on with their wicked intentions, till it broke
forth into this flame.

4. Forbidding Soldiers to petition: this also is false as they report it. The
Proclamation is extant: wherein they are not prohibited, only required
whatsoever they do this way, to do it peaceably, and in order; that so
whatsoever is just and honorable may be the sooner obtained, and all tumults
and divisions amongst themselves the better avoided. Thus we have heard their

Answ: It would seem something strange to hear a man charge the blood of Naboth
upon Eliah, who was so far from committing the fact, as that he sharply rebuked
Ahab for it. Where shall it be found, unless in these men's Papers, that an
action never done by a man, nor consented to, shall nevertheless be put upon
his reckoning, and others quitted? For the persons whom they do Note how to
make division in the Parliament, and to have our present Governors despiseable
in the eyes of the Nation, they always accuse some particular men, as if the
rest were only their creatures, and had neither judgment, honesty, or
conscience.
accuse all along, naming a prevailing power of the Army, Lords and masters
both of Parliament and people, such as have the highest Commands of Military
Power, a faction of Officers, etc. they have not had an hand in the things
whereof they accuse them: but as the burning of Rome was by Nero laid on the
Christians, and the Gunpowder pl^t upon the Puritans by the Jesuits; so, and
for the same end, that is, to have the guiltnesse condemned, they have spread
abroad this horrible falsehood: But in the mean time is not that rule useful in
reading their Papers? Nihil credendo, atque omnia cavendo. Cic. Orat. Post.

of allowance given to lying, for the good of the Commonwealth: but these men
use it another way, even thereby to destroy the Commonwealth, if possibly they
can.

And howsoever we are sure, that things of this nature, will find little
acceptance any where among people well affected; nevertheless whosoever shall
peruse, and well observe all their writings over, shall find little else
therein, but false aspersions raised up, without any ground or color of truth;
so that we may more truly say then the Vindicator of Walwyns Wyles, The
charity of Churchmen, page 5.
They have indeed too exactly learnt Machiavels rule, to spare not, to
scandalize and tradu^e their adversaries; for that though some of the dirt he
wiped off, yet part of it will stick, and they shall be sure not altogether to
loose their labors.

And for proof hereof, let these particulars (amongst many others the like,
which might be mentioned) bear witness, where the aforesaid prevailing power of
the Army are charged with the intolerable burdens of custom, conferring
Offices upon their creatures and relations: donation of hundreds and thousands
per Annum, betrayed their trust of Feofees for Bishops and Delinquents Lands,
purchased themselves great Estates, thirst after the blood of such Soldiers
and people as are of action for common freedom and safety, enslaved the
Commonwealth to their am ition, lust, covetousness, and domination, discourse
that the power must be reduced to one, are without any remorse at the dearnesse
of food and utter l^sse of Trade; brought a new and dangerous War upon the
Nation; taken away men's lives f r no other end but to make way for an a^solute
domination; brought the Land into a more dangerous condition then they found
it. All which things are known not only to be false, but mat^ers for the most
part wherein they never had to do; and for the re^t, such things as they
altogether and every way have acted to the contrary.

And no less untrue is the thing (as by them reported) concerning some
passages in relation to the King: so likewise for Coll: Rainsb^rough, Coll:
Ayred, Major Cob^et, Captain Bray, William Thomson, Lieu: Coll: Hen: Lilburne,
etc. they are all false and forged things as they relate them. When it is their
own case to be accused by others, and their Accusers say they have credible
people that heard the same, and will attest it, note their way of clearing: of
what credit, pray, is the testimony of an Enemy, in matters of obl^quy and
reproach, tending to the disparagement of another. Mr. Edwards had witnesses
for attestation of many strange matters he reported of pious and honest people,
and yet how deservedly were his slanders slighted, upon this ground, that men
of different spirits d^ very familia^ly hear with too open ears, and report
with such additions as their sp^een and dis-affection suggests against him they
malign: And as Mr. Goodwin well expresses himself in his Answer to Mr. Edwards
Gangreen. There is no reasonable man but will abate and deduct, and that to a
good proportion, from such reckoning^ and ^^e un^^ which are drawn up, and
given in to him by the hand of envy. Is this a In this little there is enough
said to ^ind ^a^e L: Genesis C^omwell from all ^ilbu^nes Aspersious first and
last: for suppose there had been credible people and witnesses for attestation,
yet it is evident the things were drawn up by the hand of envy, and so by
their own rule deservedly to be slighted: But seeing it is not only done by a
malicious enemy, but he brings no credible people, or witnesses for
attestation: Our enemies then being Judges of what credit i^ his testimony in
matters of obloquy and reproach, tend ng to the d^sparageme^t o^ another?
reasonable Plea, to vindicate a man against whom accusations can be proved by
credible people, and there are witnesses for attestation? it will then much
more hold good here, where the accusations are not only from enemies, and men
most malicious, but also no credible people, no witnesses for attestations, but
such things as their spleen and dis-affection suggests against those they
malign.

There are many other accusations of this nature, brought against the Council
of War, and Commanders of the Army; of all which we shall speak in our next
Discovery, and about Promises and Engagements made at New Market, Triploe
beath with the It is well observed by Mr. Hen. Den, that seeing most of the
Regiments of horse and foot did Petition his Excellency to send back their
Agitators to their respective Regiments, and according to their Petitions the
Council of Agitators was dissolved: that his Excellency cannot be charged with
violation of that Engagement: neither does there remain any obligation on his
Excellency to have continued or revived any such Council. Much less is it
warrantable in the Sould^ery of the Army to assume that power to themselves,
seeing they suffered a dissolution by the same power, by which they had their
constitution. The Levellers desig^e, p 4, 5.
Agitators, a thing much spoken of: At this time we shall only touch one thing
more, which is, that they would have the Parliament consider how dangerous it
is for one and the same persons to be continued long in the highest Commands of
Military po^^^ especially acting so long, distinct, and of themselves, as those
n^w in being h^ve d^ne, and such extraordinary ways, whe^eunto the^ have
a^^ustomed themselves, which was the original of m^st R^galities and Ty^annies
in the world.

Answ: 1. How often soever in other things they contradict themselves, yet in
these particulars we never find them changlings: As, 1. in making division, and
seeking to set difference and strife between the Parliament and the chief
Commanders of the Army. 2. In raising iealousies, and to have such suspected
whom they would have taken out of the way, as that they will degenerate into
Tyrants, etc. when there is no ground at all for any such insinuation. 3. In
every thing which they speak of, and would have to be done, there is some
mischief still intended against the safety and good of the Nation, let it fall
under what pretense soever of justness, fitness, providence, etc.

But 2ly, was not the motion reasonable and considerable, yea and very
seasonable for them to have had it so? For the wicked plot of this present
Rebellion was then in consultation, and they could not but see how dangerous it
was for one and the same persons to be continued long in the highest Commands
of a Military Power: But wherefore dangerous? because having ripened and
heightened the Soldiers to revolt from their obedience, there were none so
likely to break this design, and under God to preserve the Nation from that
bloody and cruel faction. And therefore they might well say, how dangerous is
it for such persons to ^e continued long? etc.

Now for conclusion, and to their glorying and boasting that their cause and
principles get ground: so that where there was one, twelve months since, that
owned their principles, they believe there are now hundreds. Howsoever we take
not this for a truth, but to be another device of theirs, to blow up the
sparkles of Rebellion, (and for example we refer the Reader to the When they
had laid such a foundation of lies and falsehood (wherein they have not been
inferior, if not beyond those enemies we had last to deal with) and had thereby
occasioned so many of Commissary General Iretons and Col. Scrcops Regiments to
revolt, and cast off their Officers (an Act not to be paralleld) and that their
business began to grow to a head, they sent their Emissaries and Agitators to
all parts (as we have good intelligence) pretending from one Regiment to
another, that each Regiment had declared, that so by that Artifice they might
draw each to declare. To the forces in Wales and the West they gave assurances
that the forces about London would revolt, and to those about London, that
those in Wales and the West would do the same. And to the forces in the North
used they the like arguments, and nourished also the distemper of the forces in
the South. A Declaration of the proceedings of his Excellency, page 6.
margin:) nevertheless it were no marvel though many (otherwise well-minded
people) should be deceived by such evil workers, who have carried on the most
dangerous and destructive designs against this Nation that ever were known,
and under the vizard and cloak of setting the Commonwealth upon just grounds
of freedom, liberty, and safety. But we are confident wheresoever this
DISCOVERER shall come, with the rest following, that the number in all places
will abate, and the honest minded every where will see their error, and
mistake; and bless God that the snare is broken, and their souls like birds
are escaped.
