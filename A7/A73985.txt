A Proclamation for the restraining of the Importation of Iron VVyer into this
Kingdom, and for the support of that Manufacture.
WHereas Iron VVyer is a manufacture long practiced within this Realm, and by
that Trade and Mystery many thousands of Our loving Subjects have been for a
long time well and honestly employed and set on work; And by means thereof,
great numbers of expert and skillful men in that Art and Science have been
trained up, who are now destitute of any other profession or means whereby to
get their livings.

And whereas English Wire, being made of the toughest and best Osmond Iron, (a
native Commodity of this Kingdom) is of much better use, then that Iron Wire
which comes from foreign parts, especially for the making of good
Wooll-Cards, without which no good Cloth can be made: And this has appeared
unto Us by the Certificates of diverse Clothiers, Card-makers,
Card-Wyer-drawers, and the Farmors of Our Customs, to whom the examination
thereof has been referred.

And whereas by the Wyer-drawers of diverse parts of this Our Kingdom, sundry
complaints have been made unto Us, that by reason of the great quantities of
foreign Iron Wire lately imported into this Our Realm of England, (whereof
also a great part is falsely and deceitfully made and wrought) Our said poor
Subjects who make Iron Wire cannot be set on work in their Vocations of
Wyer-making and Wyer-drawing, nor are able to continue in the exercise of their
said Trades, whereby so commendable and profitable an Art is like wholly to be
lost in this our Kingdom, and the makers of Wooll-Cards are much deceived by
that foreign Wire; and they who use those Cards much more: whereby great
prejudice will arise to Us and Our people, and to the whole Trade of Clothing
within this Realm, except some speedy course be taken for redress of so great
an inconvenience.

We well weighing the danger and prejudice that may happen to this Our
Kingdom, by being served only from foreign parts, with a Commodity of so
great necessity, and continual use as Wire is, either in time of war, when
little or none can be imported, or else when foreign parts shall find other
Markets or Vents for that Commodity, or when at their own pleasures they may
raise their prises upon Us, or serve Us, with false and unserviceable Wire,
which would tend much to the dishonor of this Our Nation, and disadvantage of
Us and Our loving Subjects.

And finding that sundry good Laws and Statutes have formerly been made,
prohibiting the Importation of foreign Wool-cards, and of the said foreign
Iron Wire, and diverse other Manufactures made of Wire, for the better
cherishing and encouraging of so profitable and necessary a Manufacture within
this Kingdom, but that the execution of those good Laws has of late been
much neglected; We taking these things into Our Princely consideration, by the
advice of Our Privy Council, have thought fit as well to prohibit the
Importation of foreign Iron Wire, and Cards made of foreign Wire, and of
Hooks and Eyes, and other Manufactures made of Iron Wire only, as to provide
that all Cards made within these Our Kingdoms and Dominions, be well and
substantially made, without any fraud or deceit: Do therefore hereby straightly
Charge and Command all and singular person and persons whatsoever, as well Our
own natural borne Subjects, as Denizens and Strangers, that none of them, nor
any other person or persons whatsoever, do at any time or times hereafter
attempt or presume to bring, or cause to be brought into these Our Realms of
England or Ireland, or any other Our Dominions, or into any the Ports, Havens,
Creekes or Places of any of them, any foreign Iron Wire, or Cards made of
foreign Iron Wire, or other Manufactures aforesaid, in greater or lesser
quantities, made or to be made in any foreign Part or Place whatsoever, or
any Wool Cards made within this Kingdom, and which have once been exported
from hence, upon pain of forfeiture of all and every quantity and quantities
of the said foreign Iron Wire, and Cards made of foreign Wire, and of other
the Manufactures made only of Wire as aforesaid, so brought or caused to be
brought in to Our said Realms and Dominions, contrary to this Our Royal
Commandment.

And Our will and pleasure is, that all such foreign Iron Wire, and Cards
made of Wire, and Manufactures of Wire aforesaid, which shall be imported
contrary to these presents, shall by such person and persons who shall seize
the same be forthwith carried and conveyed into Our Custom House within Our
Port of London, and other Custome-houses of that Port where the same shall be
seized, without selling, uttering, compounding, or delivering any part thereof,
before the same be thither brought and delivered as aforesaid, upon pain of
our high Indignation and displeasure, and of such further pains, penalties and
punishments as by the Laws and Statutes of this Our Realm, or Our Prerogative
Royal for the contempt of Our commandment in this behalf, can or may any way
be inflicted upon them, or any of them so offending, contrary to the true
intent and meaning of these presents: And to that end and purpose, We do
hereby require and command all and singular the Officers of Our Customs, or
attending the same, within all and every the Ports and Havens of these Our
Realms and Dominions, and the Creekes and Members of the same Ports, that they
and every of them do from and after the date hereof at all times forbear to
take any entry, or entries, or to take or make any composition or compositions
for any Custom, Subsidy, or other Duty, for, or upon any foreign Wire, or
Cards made of foreign Wire, or other the Manufactures made only of Iron Wire
as aforesaid, brought, or to be brought into these Our Realms or Dominions
from any foreign parts. And also that they, and all, and every other Our
Officers and Ministers do stay and seize the same, as forfeited and
confiscated, to the use and uses hereafter specified, upon pain of forfeiture
of their Offices, and of undergoing Our high indignation and displeasure for
their neglect herein, with such further pains and punishments as by the Laws
and Statutes of this Our Realm, or by Our Prerogative Royal, for the same
their contempts and defaults, may any way be inflicted upon them.

And whereas an use or custom has lately crept into this Kingdom by some ill
disposed persons, more regarding their own private gain and lucre, then the
good of the Commonwealth, to buy up old cast Cards within this Kingdom, and
do scowre, translate, and trim up the same, and sell them again to unskillful
country people for new Cards; by means whereof the Cloth made of Wool carded
with such Cards, is falsified to the great loss and hinderance of the
Clothier, the deceit and prejudice of Our Subjects, who do buy and wear the
same, and to the discredit of the trade of Clothing, being the chiefest and
richest Commodity of this Our Kingdom.

These are therefore further to require and command, that no person or persons
do at any time or times hereafter attempt or presume to Buy, Sell, Barter,
Vent, or put to Sale within any of Our said Kingdoms, or Dominions, or to
export into any foreign parts any old cast Wool-Cards whatsoever, upon pain
of forfeiture and confiscation thereof, and such other pains, penalties and
punishments, as by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, or by Our Prerogative
Royal can or may be inflicted upon them. But that the same old Cast Wool-Cards
being offered to sale be seized to Our use, by any Our Officers or Subjects,
and to be brought into Our Custome-houses within Our Port of London, or other
Ports aforesaid.

And to the end Our intention herein may take the better effect; Our will and
command is, and We do hereby declare Our pleasure to be, that such person and
persons as shall make seizure of any of the said foreign Iron Wire, or of any
Cards made of foreign Wire, or manufactures made of Iron Wire only, or of any
old cast Wool-Cards, translated or trimmed up, and put to sale as aforesaid,
contrary to Our Royal commandment herein signified, shall have and receive to
his or their own use and uses, one moyetie or half part of the said Iron
Wire, or Cards made of foreign Wire, or old cast Wool-Cards, or other
manufactures made of Wire only as aforesaid, so by him or them seized or to be
seized, as aforesaid, the other moietie thereof to be reserved to Our use.

And for the better execution of this Our present will and Commandment, We
do straightly charge and command all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs,
Bailiffs, Constables, Headboroughs, Tithingmen, and all other Our Officers,
Ministers, and loving Subjects, to whom it shall or may appertain, that they
and every of them, at all time and times hereafter, and from time to time be
aiding and assisting to Our said Customers, Collectors, Searchers, Waiters, and
to all other person and persons employed for the searching in any Ship, House,
Warehouse or Celler, and for seizing, taking, and carrying away of all and
every such Iron Wire, and Cards made of foreign Wire, and other manufacture
made of Wire imported, or hereafter to be imported contrary to this Our Royal
prohibition and commandment. And if any shall offend herein, or be found
remiss or negligent in the execution of the premises, and notice thereof be
given to Our Attorney general for the time being, that he do proceed
against all and every person and persons so offending, in Our high Court of
Star Chamber, or in any other Our Courts of Justice, or otherwise, by such
ways and means as are by the Laws, or Statutes of this Realm provided
against such as shall offend herein, contrary to the Law, and contrary to Our
Royal Commandment.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the seventh day of May, in the sixth year of
Our Reign. God save the King.
