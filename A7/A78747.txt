HIS MAJESTY'S DECLARATION To all His Loving Subjects, Upon occasion of his
late MESSAGES to both Houses of PARLIAMENT, And their Refusal to treat with
Him for the Peace of the KINGDOM.

Charles R.

OUr express pleasure is, That this our Declaration be published in all
Churches and Chapels within the Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales, by
the Parsons, Vicars, or Curates of the same.

Printed by His Majesty's Command at Oxford, by Leonard Lichfield, Printer to
the Universitie. 1642.

His Majesty's DECLARATION To all his loving Subjects, upon occasion of his
late Messages to both Houses of Parliament, and their refusal, to treat with
him for the peace of the Kingdom.
IF it had not evidently appeared to all men who have carefully examined and
considered Our Actions, Messages, and Declarations, how far We are and have
been from begetting or promoting the present Distractions, and that the Arms
we have now taken are for the necessary safety and defense of Our life, being
not taken up by Us till our Town and Fort of Hull were kept from Us by force of
Arms, Our Navy employed against Us to keep all foreign supply of Arms and
Money, when Our own here was seized and detained from Us, and an Army raised in
pay, and marching against Us, yet the late reception of Our Message of the 25.
of August, sent by Persons of Honor and Trust, will sure satisfy the World,
that we have omitted nothing on Our part that a gracious and Christian Prince
could or can do to prevent the effusion of Christian Blood, but that the
Malignant party, which have with great subtilty and industry begot this
misunderstanding between Us and Our good Subjects, resolve to satisfy and
secure their malice and ambition with the ruin of the Kingdom, and in the
blood of Us and all Our good Subjects.

When they had forced Us, after the neglect of Our Message from Beverley, by
raising a great Army, and incensing Our Subjects against Us, to erect our
royal Standard; that Our Subjects might be informed of Our danger, and repair
to Our Succor, though We had no great reason to believe any Message of Ours
would receive a very good entertainment, if those men might prevail who had
brought all these miseries upon the Kingdom to satisfy their own private end:
yet observing the miserable accidents which already befell Our good Subjects by
the Soldiers under their command, and well knowing that greater would ensue,
if timely prevention were not applied; and finding that the malice and cunning
of these men had infused into Our People a Rumor, that We had rejected all
Propositions and offers of Treaty, and desired to engage Our Subjects in a
Civil War, which Our Soul abhors, we prevail with Our self (for a full
expression of Our desire to prevent the effusion of Blood) to send a gracious
message to both Our Houses of Parliament on the 25. of August, in these words.

His Majesty's gracious Message to both Houses of Parl. sent from Mottingham
25. Aug. 1642 By the Earls of Southhampton and Do^set, Sir John C^lpepe,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir William ^^edall.
WE have with unspeakable grief of heart long beheld the distractions of this
Our Kingdom, Our very soul is full of anguish until We may find some remedy to
prevent the Miseries which are already to overwhelme this whole nation by a
civil War: And though all Our endeavors tending to the Composing of those
unhappy differences betwixt Us and Our two houses of Parliament (though pursued
by Us with all Zeal and Syncerity) have been hitherto without that Success We
hoped for; yet such is our constant and earnest care to preserve the public
Peace, that We shall not be discouraged from using any Expedient, which by the
blessing of the God of Mercy may lay a firm foundation of Peace and happiness
to all Our good Subjects: To this end observing that many mistakes have arisen
by the Messages, Petitions and Answers betwixt Us and Our two Houses of
Parliament, which happily may be prevented by some other way of Treaty, wherein
the Matters in difference may be more clearly understood, and more freely
transacted; We have thought fit to propound to you, That some fit persons may
be by you enabled to treat with the like number to be authorized by Us, in such
a manner, and with such freedom of debate, as may best tend to that happy
Conclusion which all good men desire, The peace of the Kingdom: Wherein as We
promise in the Word of a King all safety and encouragement to such as shall be
sent to Us, if you shall choose the place where we are for the Treaty, which We
wholly leave to you, presuming of your like care of the safety of those We shall
employ if you shall name another place; So We assure you and all Our good
Subjects, that (to the best of Our understanding) nothing shall be therein
wanting on Our parts, which may advance the True Protestant Religion, Oppose
Popery and Superstition, Secure the Law of the Land (upon which is built as
well our just Prerogative, as the Propriety and Liberty of the Subject)
Confirm all just Power and Privileges of Parliament, and render Us and Our
People truly happy by a good understanding betwixt Us and Our two Houses of
Parliament. Bring with you as firm Resolutions to do your duty, and let all
Our good people join with Us in Our prayers to Almighty God for his blessing
upon this Work.

If this Proposition shall be rejected by you, We have done Our duty so amply,
that God will absolve Us from the Guilt of any of that blood which must be
spilt, and what opinion soever other men may have of Our Power, We assure you
nothing but our Christian and Pious care to prevent the Effusion of blood has
begot this Motion, Our Provision of Men, Arms and Money, being such as may
secure Us from farther violence, till it shall please God to open the eyes of
Our People.


Our Messengers were not suffered to sit in the Houses, and one of them, the E.
of Southampton (against whom there was not the least color of exception or so
much as a vote) not suffered to deliver Our Message, but compelled to send it
by the Gentleman Usher, and then commanded to depart the Town, before they
would prepare any Answer, which they shortly sent Us in these words,

The Answer of the Lords and Commons to his Majesty's Message the 25. of Aug.
1642.
May it please Your Majesty,
THe Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, having received Your Majesty's
Message of the 25. of August, do with much grief resent the dangerous and
distracted state of this Kingdom, which we have by all means endeavored to
prevent, both by our several advices and Petitions to Your Majesty, which have
been not only without success, but there has followed that, which no ill
counsel in former times has produced, or any age has seen, namely, those
several Proclamations and Declarations against both the Houses of Parliament,
whereby their Actions are declared Treasonable, and their Persons Traitors; And
thereupon Your Majesty has set up Your Standard against them; whereby You
have put the two Houses of Parliament, and in them this whole Kingdom out of
Your protection; so that until Your Majesty shall recall those Proclamations
and Declarations, whereby the E. of Essex and both Houses of Parliament, and
their adherents and assistants, and such as have obeyed and executed their
commands and directions, according to their duties, are declared Traitors, or
otherwise Delinquents; And until the Standard set up in pursuance of the said
Proclamations be taken down, Your Majesty has put us into such a condition,
that whilst we so remain, we cannot by the fundamental privileges of
Parliament, the public trust reposed in us, or with the general good and
safety of this Kingdom give Your Majesty any other Answer to this Message.

Joh. Brown Cler. Parliament. H. Elsinge Cler. Parl. D. Com.


THis strange Answer might well have discouraged Us from any thought of
proceeding further this way, and informed Us sufficiently what spirit still
governed amongst those few, who continued still in both Houses, otherwise after
so many bitter and invective Messages and Declarations sent to Us, and
published against Us, We should not have been reproched with Our Proclamations
and Declarations set forth by Us, as the effect of such evil Counsel, as was
unparalled by any former Examples. We believe indeed such Proclamations and
Declarations have never been before set forth; but were former times ever
acquainted with such intolerable provocations? were there ever, before these
Twelve months, Declarations published in the name of either or both Houses of
Parliament, to make their King odious to the People? Have either or both Houses
ever before assumed or pretended to a Power to raise Arms or levy War in any
Cause, or can both Houses together exercise such a Power? Are those Actions
which the Law has defined literally and expressly to be Treasonable, or such
Persons to be Traitors, not so, because they are done by Members of either
House, or their appointment? And must not We declare such who march with Arms
and Force to destroy Us, to be Traitors, because the E. of Essex is their
General? Those whom We have or do accuse, We have named together with their
crimes, notorious by the known Law of the Land, (a favor not granted to our
evil Counselors) and appeal to that known Law to judge between Us: And now
that by this we should have put the whole Kingdom out of Our Protection (in
whose behalf We do all that We have done) is a corrupt Gloss upon such a
Text, as cannot be perverted but by the cunning practices of such who wish not
well to King or People, yet that no weak persons might be missed by that
Imputation upon Us, We sent a Reply to that Answer in these words,

His Majesty's Reply to an Answer sent by the two Houses of Parliament to His
Majesty's Message of the 25. of August, concerning a Treaty of Accommodation.
WE will not repeat what means We have used to prevent the dangerous and
distracted estate of the Kingdom, nor how those means have been interpreted,
because being desirous to avoid effusion of blood, We are willing to decline
all memory of former bitterness that might make Our offer of a Treaty less
readily accepted.

We never did Declare, nor ever intended to Declare both our Houses of
Parliament Traitors, or set up Our Standard against them, and much less to put
them and this Kingdom out of Our Protection: We utterly Profess against it
before God and the World. And further to remove all possible Scruples which may
hinder the Treaty so much desired by Us; We hereby Promise, so that a day be
appointed by you for the revoking of your Declarations against all Persons as
Traitors or otherwise, for assisting of Us, We shall with all cheerfulness
upon the same day recall Our Proclamations and Declarations, and take down Our
Standard: In which Treaty We shall be ready to grant any thing that shall be
really for the good of Our Subjects; Conjuring you to consider the bleeding
condition of Ireland, and the dangerous condition of England, in as high a
degree as by these Our offers We have declared Our Self to do: And assuring you
that Our chief desire in this is to beg^t a good understanding and mutual
confidence betwixt Us and Our two Houses of Parl.


This Message produced an Answer little differing from the former, like men who
had no other measure of the Justice of their cause, then their Power to
oppress Us, forgetting their own duties, they sharply inform Us of Ours in
these words,

The humble Answer and Petition of the Lord and Commons Assembled in
Parliament, unto the Kings last Message.
May it please Your Majesty,
IF we the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, should repeat all the
ways we have taken, the endeavors we have used, and the expressions we have
made unto Your Majesty to prevent those distractions and dangers Your Majesty
speaks of, likely to fall upon this Kingdom, we should too much enlarge this
Reply. Therefore as we humbly, so shall we only let Your Majesty know that we
cannot recede from our former Answer for the reasons therein expressed. For
that Your Majesty has not taken down Your Standard, recalled Your
Proclamations and Declarations, whereby You have declared the Actions of both
Houses of Parliament to be Treasonable, and their Persons Traitors. And You
have published the same since Your Message of the 25. of Aug. by Your late
Instructions sent to Your Commissioners of Array, which Standard being taken
down, and the Declarations, Proclamations and Instructions recalled, If Your
Majesty shall then upon this our Humble Petition, leaving Your Forces, return
unto Your Parliament, and receive their faithful advice, Your Majesty will
find such expressions of our fidelities and duties, as shall assure You that
Your Safety, Honor and Greatness can only be found in the affections of Your
people, and the sincere counsels of Your Parliament, whose constant, and
undiscouraged endeavors and consultations have passed through difficulties
unheard of, only to secure Your Kingdoms from the violent Mischiefs and
dangers now ready to fall upon them, and every part of them, who deserve better
of Your Majesty, and can never allow themselves (representing likewise Your
whole Kingdom) to be balanced with those persons whose desperate dispositions
and counsels prevail, still so to interrupt all our endeavors for the
relieving of bleeding Ireland, as we may fear our labors, and vast expenses
will be fruitless to that distressed Kingdom. As Your presence is thus humbly
desired by us; So is it in our hopes Your Majesty will in Your reason believe,
there is no other way then this, to make Your Self happy, and Your Kingdom safe.

Joh. Brown Cler. Parl.


Without any bitterness or reprehension of their neglect of Us, and the
public Peace, to express Our deep sense of the Calamities at hand, We yet
once more (hoping to awake them to a Christian tenderness toward the whole
Kingdom) sent to them in these words,

Who have taken most ways, used most endeavors, and made most real
expressions to prevent the present distractions and dangers, let all the World
judge, as well by former Passages as by Our two last Messages, which have been
so fruitless, that (though We have descended to desire and press it) not so
much as a Treaty can be obtained, unless We would denude Our self of all
force to defend Us from a visible strength marching against Us, and admit those
Persons as Traitors to Us, who according to their duty, their Oaths of
Allegiance, and the Law, have appeared in defense of Us their King and Liege
Lord (whom We are bound in Conscience and honor to preserve) though We
disclaimed all Our Proclamations and Declarations, and the erecting of Our
Standard as against our Parliament. All We have now left in Our Power is to
express the deep sense We have of the public misery of this Kingdom, in which
is involved that of Our distressed Protestants of Ireland, and to apply Our
self to Our necessary defense, wherein We wholly rely upon the Providence of
God, the Justice of (...) Cause, and the affection of Our good People, so far
We are from putting them out of Our protection. When you shall desire a Treaty
of Us, We shall piously remember whose blood is to be spilt in this quarrel,
and cheerfully embrace it: And as no other Reason induced Us to leave Our City
of London, but that with honor and safety We could not stay there, nor raise
any force but for the necessary defense of Our Person and the Law, against
Leavies in opposition to both; so we shall suddenly and most willingly return
to the one, and disband the other, as soon as those causes shall be removed. The
God of heaven direct you, and in mercy divert those judgments which hang over
this Nation, and so deal with Us and Our Posterity as We desire the
Preservation and Advancement of the true Protestant Religion, the Laws and
Liberty of the Subject, the just Rights of Parliament, and the Peace of the
Kingdom.

BUt as if all these gracious Messages had been the effects only of Our
Weakness, and instances of Our want of Power to resist that torment, they
deal at last more plainly with Us, and after many sharp, causeless, and
unjust reproaches, they tell Us in plain English, that without putting Our
Self into their hands, and deserting all Our own Force, and the protection of
all those who have faithfully appeared for Us according to their duty, there
would be no means of a Treaty, although Our extraordinary desire of Peace had
prevailed with Us, to offer to recall Our most just Declarations, and to take
down Our Standard, set up for Our necessary defense, so their unjustifiable
Declarations might be likewise recalled, their Answer follows in these words,

The humble Answer of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament unto His
Majesty's last Message.
WE the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, do present this our humble
Answer to Your Majesty's Messag^ of the 11. of this instant month of September,
when we consider the Oppressions, Rapines, Firing of houses, Murders, (even at
this time, whilst Your Majesty propounds a Treaty) committed upon Your good
Subjects by Your Soldiers, in the presence, and by the Authority of their
Commanders, being of the number of those whom Your Majesty holds Your Self
bound in Honor and Conscience to Protect as Persons doing their Duties. We
cannot think Your Majesty has done all that in You lies to prevent, or remove
the present destractions; nor so long as Your Majesty will admit no Peace,
without securing the Authors and Instruments of these mischiefs from the
Justice of the Parl. which yet shall be ever dispensed with all requisite
moderation and distinction of offenses, Although some of those Persons be such
in whose Preservation Your Kingdom cannot be safe, nor the unquestionable
Rights and Privileges of Parl. be maintained, without which the power and
dignity thereof will fall into contempt. We beseech Your Majesty therefore to
consider Your expressions, That God should deal with You and Your Posterity,
as Your Majesty desires the preservation of the just Rights of Parliament,
which being undeniable in the Trying of such as we have declared to be
Delinquents, we shall believe Your Majesty both toward Your Self and
Parliament will not in this Privilege, we are most sensible of, deny us that
which belongs unto the meanest Court of Justice in this Kingdom. Neither has
Your Majesty cause to complain that You are denied a Treaty, when we offer
all that a Treaty can produce, or Your Majesty expect, Security, Honor,
Service, Obedience, Support, and all other effects of an Humble, Loyal, and
faithful subjection, and seek nothing but that our Religion, Liberty, peace of
the Kingdom, safety of the Parliament may be secured from the open violence,
and cunning practices of a wicked party, who have long plotted our ruin and
destruction; And if there were any cause of Treason, we know no competent
persons to Treat betwixt the King and Parliament, And if both Cause and Persons
were such as could invite Treaty, the Season is altogether unfit, whilst Your
Majesty's Standard is up, and Your Proclamations and Declarations unrecalled,
whereby Your Parliament is Charged with Treason.

If Your Majesty shall persist to make Your Self a shield and defense to those
Instruments, and shall continue to reject our faithful and necessary advice
for securing and in intaining Religion and Liberty, with the peace of the
Kingdom and safety of the Parliament; we doubt not but to indifferent
judgments it will easily appear who is most tender of that Innocent Blood
which is like to be spilt in this Cause; Your Ma^stie, who by such persisting,
does endanger Your Self and Your Kingdoms, or We, who are willing to hazard our
selves, to preserve both.

We humbly beseech Your Majesty to consider how impossible it is, that any
Protestation, though published in Your Majesty's Name, of the tenderness of
the miscries of Your Protestant Subjects of Ireland, of Your Resolution to
maintain the Protestant Religion, and Laws of this Kingdom, can give
satisfaction to reasonable and indifferent men, when at the same time diverse of
the Irish Traiters and Rebels, the known favorers of them, and Agents for
them, are admitted to Your Majesty's presence with grace and favor, and some
of them employed in Your service; when the Clothes, Munition, Horses, and
other Necessaries bought by Your Parliament, and sent for the supply of the
Army against the Rebels there, are violently taken away, some by Your Majesty's
command, others by Your ministers, and applied to the maintenance of an
unnatural War against Your People here.

All this notwithstanding as we never gave Your Majesty any just cause of
withdrawing Your Self from Your great Council, so it has over been, and shall
ever be far from us to give any impediment to Your return, or to neglect any
proper means of curing the distempers of the Kingdom, and closing the
dangerous Breaches betwixt Your Majesty and Your Parliament, according to the
great Trust which: lies upon us, and if Your Majesty shall now be pleased to
come back to Your Parliament, without Your Forces, we shall be ready to secure
Your Royal Person, Your Crown and Dignity, with our Lives and Fortunes: Your
presence in this Your great Council, being the only means of any Treaty
betwixt Your Majesty and them with hope of Success.

And in none of our desires to Your Majesty shall we be swayed by any
particular man's advantage, but shall give a clear Testimony to Your Majesty,
and the whole world, that in all things done by us, we faithfully intend the
good of Your Majesty, and of Your Kingdoms, and that we will not be diverted
from this end by any private, or selfe-respects whatsoever.

Joh. Brown Cler. Parl.


THey will not believe We have done all that in Us lies to prevent and remove
the present Distractions, because of the oppressions, Rapines, and the like
committed upon Our good Subjects by Our Soldiers. Let them remember who have
compelled Us, and against Our Souls desire forced Us to raise those Soldiers,
and then if the oppressions and Rapines were indeed such as are falsely
pretended, Our poor Subjects who suffer under them, will look on them, and
only on them, as the Authors of all the miseries they do or can undergo. We
confess with grief of heart some discords have and many more may befall Our
good People by Our Soldiers, but We appeal to all those countyes through which
We have passed, what care We have taken to prevent, and what Justice We daily
inflict upon such Offenders: neither has the least complaint been ever made to
Us of violences and outrages, which We have not to Our utmost Power repaired or
punished, however those false and treasonable Pamphlets are suffered, which
accuse Us of giving warrant for plundring of Houses. Our Mercy and Lenity is so
well known to the contrary, that it is usually made an excuse by those who
against their Consciences assist this Rebellion against Us, that they choose
rather to offend Us upon confidence of Pardon, then provoke those Malignant
Persons who without charity or Compassion destroy all who concur not with them
in faction and opinion. How far We are from Rapine and Oppression may appear by
Our Lenity to the Persons and Estates of those who have not only exercised the
Militia (the seed from whence this Rebellion against Us has grown) but
contributed Money and Plate to the maintenance of that Army which now
endeavors to destroy Us, As of Nottingham, Leicester, and many other places
through which we have passed, many of whom then were and now are in that Army:
to let pass Our passing by Chartly (the house of the E. of Essex) without
other pressures then as if he were the General of Our own Army, and Our
express Orders to restrain the Liberty, our Soldiers would otherwise have
used upon that place, and his Estate about it. How contrary the proceedings are
of these great Assertors of the public Liberties, appears fully by the sad
instances they every day give in the pundring by Public warrant, the Houses of
all such whose Duty, Conscience, and Loyalty has engaged them in our Quarrel,
which every good man ought to make his own. By their declaring all Persons to
be out of the Protection of Parliament (and so exposing them to the fury of
their Soldiers) who will not assist this Rebellion against Us, their anointed
King, by the daily outrages committed it. Yorkshire, when contrary to the
desire and agreement of that County (signed under the hands of both parties)
they will not suffer the Peace to be kept, but that the distractions and
Confusion may be universal over the whole Kingdom, direct their Governor of
Hull to make War upon our good Subjects in that County, and so continue the
robbing and plundring the Houses of all such who concur not with them in this
Rebellion. Lastly, by the barbarous, sacrilegious Inhumanity exercised by their
Soldiers in Churches, as in Canterbury, Worcester, Oxford, and other Places,
where they committed such unheard of outrages, as Jews, and Atheists, never
practiced before. God in his good time will make them examples of his vengeance.

We never did, nor ever shall desire to secure the Authors and Instruments of
any mischiefs to the Kingdom from the Justice of Parliament, We desire all such
Persons may be speedily brought to condign punishment by that Rule which is or
ought to be, the Rule of all punishment, the known Law of the Land, If there
have seemed to be any interruption in proceedings of this nature, it must be
remembered, how long Persons have been kept under general Accusations, without
trial, though earnestly desired, that the Members who were properly to judge
such Accusations have by violence been driven thence, or could not with honor
and safety be present at such debates, that notorious Delinquents by the known
Laws were protected against Us from the Justice of the Kingdom, and such
called Delinquents, who committing no Offense against any known Law were so
voted only for doing their Duties to Us, and then there will be no cause of
complaint found against Us.

And for the Privileges of Parliament We have said so much and upon such
reasons, (which have never been answered but by bare positive Assertions) in
Our several Declarations, that We may well, and do still use the same
expression, That We desire God may so deal with Us and Our Posterity, as We
desire the preservation of the just Rights of Parliament; the violation whereof
in truth by these desperate Persons is so clearly known to all men who
understand the Privileges of Parliament, that their rage and malice has not
been greater to Our Person and Government then to the Liberty, Privilege, and
very being of Parliaments, witness their putting in, putting out, and
suspending what Persons they please, as they like or dislike their opinions,
their bringing down the Tumults to assault the Members, and awe the Parliament,
their posting and prosecuting such Members of either House as concurred not
with them in their Designs, and so driving them from thence for the safety of
their lives, their denying Us, against the known, established Law, and the
Constitution of the Kingdom, to have a negative voice, without which no
Parliament can consist, their making close Committees, from whence the Members
of the Houses are exempted, against the Liberty of Parliament, and lastly
resolving both Houses into a close Committee, of seventeen persons who
undertake and direct all the present Outrages and the managery of this
Rebellion against Us, in the absence of four parts of five of both Houses, and
without the privity of those who stay there, which is not only contrary but
destructive to Parliaments themselves. By these gross, unheard of Incasions
and breaches of the Privileges of Parliament, (and without them they could not
have done the other) They made way for their Attempts upon the Law of the Land,
and the Introduction of that unlimited, Arbitrary Power which they have since
exercised to the intolerable damage and confusion of the whole Kingdom. And We
assure Our good Subjects, the vindication of these just Liberties and
Privileges of Parliament, thus violated by these men, is not less the
Argument of Our present quarrel and undertaking, then Our own Honor,
Interest, and Safety, those being no way so securely to be preserved, as by
preserving Parliaments and their just Privileges. Neither is there any
Protestation to Our knowledge published in Our name of Our tenderness of the
miseries of Ireland, and Our Resolution to maintain the Protestant Religion,
and Laws of this Kingdom, that is not the Protestation of Our Soul, and
manifested in all Our Actions, and We hope that false Scandal, That diverse of
the Irish Traitors and Rebels, the known favorers of them, and Agents for them
are admitted to Our presence with favor, and employed in Our service, will
gain no credit with good men, who remember well the notorious imputation so
confidently and groundlesly heretofore cast on Us by M. Pym, of which as there
could never be the least proof, so We could never receive any satisfaction for
that high injury, which might have been a warning to them to have published no
more such untruths, if they had not found that truth and their End, cannot meet
together.

For the Horses taken for Our service, which were provided for the service of
Ireland, it is true We were compelled for the bringing Our own wagons from
Chester for the carriage of Our Munition to make use of them, being few in
number and of small value, after they were certified to be of no use for the
service, for which they were provided. And for the clothes upon enquiry We
find that some few were taken by Our Soldiers (but without order from Us)
going to Coventry, and as was probably believed for the relief of that place,
then in actual rebellion against Us, but how far We have been, and are from
diverting any of those provisions made for the relief of that poor Kingdom
(the thought of whose miserable condition makes our heart bleed) may appear
by our express command, given for the speedy transportation of 3000. suites of
clothes which we found provided at Chester, but neglected to be sent, and which
no necessity of our own Army here could prevail with Us to seize. And how bold
soever the reproaches of that kind have been upon us, We are consulent
malice it self cannot lay the least probable imputation upon us, for the
neglect of our duty toward that Kingdom. What one thing in our power have
we neglected or omitted, which might contribute to the assistance, or ease of
our poor Protestant subjects there? We first recommended the case of that
business to both our Houses of Parliament. We condescended to all
propositions made on the behalf offered to raise 10000. Volunteers (which if
then accepted had shortened that work) offered to venture our own person in the
service, what interpretation that offer of ours found, is known to all the
world, We parted with our Interest in the Land of the Rebels, to encourage
such who were willing to adventure in that business, and when money is raised
by our consent for that sole purpose, they have at once seized 100000. pound
particularly appointed by Act of Parliament for the relief of Ireland (our
Army being ready to perish for want of it) and employed it to maintain this
unnatural civil war at home. They have levied men and entertained Commanders
for that service, and then compelled them to join in this Rebellion, and to
march against Us, and though they have complained of Our keeping the Lieutenant
of Ireland some weeks with Us, (when in truth it was a season of extraordinary
business) after We had in vain for many months pressed his dispatch, yet
themselves now detain him, when his going is so necessary for the preservation
of that Kingdom. And no doubt these men (and these alone) by begetting this
miserable distraction of England, are guilty before God and Man of all the
insupportable calamities that Our Kingdom of Ireland endures. Let all the world
judge where the desire of Peace is, and upon whose account the blood and
confusion which has been shed and must follow, shall be cast, And whether the
several Proclamations and Declarations published by Us, have notbin extorted
from Us, by such unheard of Insolences and Injuries, which no former times
ever produced, neither can any sober man wonder, when We are publicly
reproached, traduced, and reviled to Our People (a practice never known till
this Parliament) that We endeavor by a true relation and Declaration of Our
Actions and Intentions, and of their Conspiracyes, who have vowed Our
destruction, to inform Our good Subjects of the cunning and malice they are to
encounter with; and when a Combination is entered into to destroy Us, and to
alter the Religion and Law of the Kingdom, and to that purpose an Army raised
and marching against Us, that We proclaim the General of that Army and such
who shall assist him in leavying a War against Us, to be Traitors, and have set
up Our Royal Standard, and requited all Our good Subjects to come to Our
defense. And yet both in that Proclamation and in all Our Declarations We have
never accused Our Parliament, but such factious, seditious members of both
Houses whom We have named, and whom We are ready to prove according to the
Rules of the known Law to be guilty of High Treason. We well know, and all the
Kingdom knows that of near 500. Members which the House of Commons contains,
there remains not now there 100. neither has above such a number consented
almost to any thing of which We have ever complained, the rest have either been
driven away by Tumults and Threats of the Persons whom We have accused, or out
of Conscience withdrawn themselves from their desperate consultations, and of
about 100. Peers o^ the Realm there are not above 15. or 16. who concur in
these miserable Resolutions, which disturb the public peace, many of which
being of desperate fortunes, have no other support, then the Commands now given
them to make War upon Us, and now these men must sit upon the lives and
fortunes of all the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of England, and because We
will not put Our self into the hands, Government, and disposal of them, all
Our good Subjects are envited and encouraged to Rebel against us, yet We have
been, and are still far from accusing all that small number of both Houses who
are yet left together, We believe many of them are misled by the cunning and
malice, and frighted by the power of those men whom we have accused, against
every one of whom We have evidence of matter of fact, that the known Law of
the Land determines to be High Treason.

And now that all Our good Subjects may see how desirous these men and their
adherents are to prevent the effusion of blood, and the lasting miseries of a
Civil War, they will make themselves so considerable, that except We will
recall Our Proclamations and Declarations whereby particular men named for
particular Actions (which the Law has defined to be Treason) are so accused,
and others warned from involving themselves in their guilt, and except We will
take down Our Standard, that Our good Subjects may not repair to Us for Our
defense, when so many Armies are raised against Us in several parts of the
Kingdom, and ready to destroy Us, and such of Our good Subjects, who dare
continue loyal to Us, and except We will return to London, from whence with
violence We have been driven, We must not be treated with, or receive any
Answer to so gracious a Message.

It can no longer be doubted by any man, who has not wilfully forsaken his
understanding, that it is no more a quarrel undertaken by the Parliament, but
contrived and fomented by the Persons We have named, and now continued solely
in their defense, to whose Ambition, Faction, and malice, the true reformed
Protestant Religion, the just Right, Honor, Safety, and life of Us and Our
Posterity, the Law of the Land, which has so long preserved this Nation happy,
the Liberty of the Subject established by that Law, and the glorious frame and
constitution of this Kingdom must be sacrificed. But as We have hitherto left
no Action unperformed, which in Honor, Justice and Conscience We were obliged
to do, or in Christian Policy and Prudence We could conceave might probably
prevent these Calamities, so We thank God he has given Us a full Courage and
Resolution to run the utmost hazard of Our life for the suppression of this
horrible Rebellion, in the which no disproportion of Power, Arms, or Money
shall discorage Us; And We hope that all Our good Subjects; besides, by the
Common duty of Allegiance, will be stirred up for their own sakes, for the
preservation of the blessed Protestant Religion, and for the upholding this
whole admirable frame of Government, which being dissolved, all their private
and particular Rights and Interest must be immediately confounded, to bring in
their utmost power and assistance unto Us in this desperate exigent. And We do
declare that whosoever shall loose his life in this Service for Our defense,
the Wardship of his Heir shall be granted by Us without Rent or Fine to his
own use, and We shall hold Our Self obliged to take all possible care for
the support, relief, and protection of all their wives, and Children, who shall
have the hard fortune to dye in this Service.

FINIS.
