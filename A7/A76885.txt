A SPEECH DELIVERED BY Sir Francis Bacon, In the lower House of Parliament
quinto IACOBI, concerning the Article of Naturalization of the Scottish Nation.

LONDON, Printed Anno, 1641.

A SPEECH Used by Sir Francis Bacon in the lower House of Parliament, quinto
Jacobi, concerning the Article of Naturalization of the Scottish Nation.
IT may please you (Master Speaker) preface will I use none, but put my self
upon your good opinions, to which I have been accustomed beyond my deservings,
neither will I hold you in suspense, what way I will choose, but now at the
first declare my self, that I mean to counsel the House to Naturalize this
Nation, wherein nevertheless I have a request to make unto you, which is of
more efficacy to the purpose I have in hand, than all that I shall say
afterward: And it is the same request, which Demosthenes did more then once,
in great causes of estate, make to the people of Athens, That when they took
into their hands the Balls, whereby to give their voices (according as the
manner of them was) they would raise their thoughts, and lay aside those
considerations, which their private vacations and degrees might minister and
represent unto them, and would take upon them, cogitations and minds agreeable
to the dignity and honor of the estate.

For (Master Speaker) as it was aptly and sharply said by Alexander to
Parmenio, when upon their recital of the great offers which Darius made,
Parmenio said unto him, I would accept these offers, were I as Alexander, he
turned it upon him again, so would I (says he) were I as Parmenio, so in
this cause: if an honest English Merchant (I do not single out that State in
disgrace, for this Island ever held it honorable, but only for an instance of
a private profession) If an English Merchant should say, surely I would proceed
no further in the union, were I as the King, it might be reasonably answered,
no more would the King, were he as an English Merchant; and the like may be
said of a Gentleman in the Country, be he never so worthy or sufficient, or of
a Lawyer be he never so wise or learned, or of any other particular condition
in this Kingdom, for certainly (Master Speaker) if a man shall be only or
chiefly sensible of those respects which his particular affection, and degree
shall suggest, and infuse into him, and not enter into true and worthy
considerations of estate, he shall never be able aright to give counsel, or
take counsel in this matter, for that if this request be granted, I account
the cause obtained.

But to proceed to the matter it self; all consultations do rest upon questions
comparative, for when a question is de vero, it is simple, for there is but one
truth, but when a question is de bono, it is for the most part comparative, for
there be differing degrees of good and evil, and the best of the good is to be
preferred and chosen, and the worst of the evil is to be declined and avoided,
and therefore in questions of this nature, you may not look for answer, proper
to every inconvenience alleged, for somewhat that cannot be specially
answered, may nevertheless be encountered, and overweighed by matter of greater
moment, and therefore, for the matter which I shall set forth unto you, will
naturally receive the distribution of three parts.

First, The answer to the inconveniences objected concerning the
Naturalivation.
an answer to these inconveniences which have been alleged to ensue, if we
should give way to this Naturalization, which I suppose you will not find to
be, which I suppose will not be so great, as they have bin made, but that much
dross is put into the balance, to help to make weight.

Secondly, an encounter against the remaynder of these inconveniences, which
cannot properly be answered, by much greater inconveniences, which we shall
incur, if we do not proceed to this Naturalization.

Thirdly, an encounter likewise, but of another nature, that is by the gain
and benefit, which we shall draw and purchase to our selves by proceeding to
this Naturalization. And yet to avoid confusion, which ever follows of too
much generality, it is necessary for me (before I proceed to persuasion) to use
some distribution of the points or parts of Naturalization, which certainly can
be no better, or none other, than the ancient distinction of jus Civitatis, jus
suffragii vel tribus, Jus Petitionis sive honoris: for all ability and
capacity is either of private interest, of Meum and Tuum, or of public
service, and the public consists chiefly either in voice or in office, now
it is the first of these (Master Speaker) that I will only handle at this time,
and in this place, and refer the other two for a Committee, because they
receive more distinction and restriction.

To come to the inconveniences alleged on the other part, the first of them
is, that their may ensue of this Naturalization, a surcharge of people upon
this Realm of England, which is supposed already, to have the full charge and
contentment, and therefore there cannot be an admission of the adoptive,
without a dismission of the former times, and conditions of all those, that are
native subjects of this Realm. A grave objection, (Master Speaker) and very
dutiful, for it proceeds not, of any unkindnesse to the Scottish Nation, but
of a natural fastness to our selves, for that answer of the Virgins, Ne forte
non sufficiat vobis and nobis, proceeds not out of any envy, or malign humor,
but out of providence, and the original charity, which begins with our selves,
and I must confess (M. Speaker) that as the Gentleman said, when Abraham and
Lot, in regard of the greatness of their Families, grew pent, and straightened,
It is true, that though they were brethren, they grew to difference, and to
those words, Vade tu ad dexteram, and ego ad sinistram; But certainly, I should
never have brought that example on that side, for we see what followed of it,
how this separation ad dextram and ad sinistram, Caused the miserable captivity
of the one brother, and the dangerous though prosperous war of the other, for
his rescue and recovery.

But to this objection, (Master Speaker) being so weighty, and so principal, I
mean to give three several answers, every one of them being to my
understanding by it self Sufficient.

The first is, The opinion of the number of the Scottish Nation.
that the opinion, of the number of the Scottish Nation, that should be likely
to plant themselves here amongst us, will be found to be a thing, rather in
conceit then in event, for (Master Speaker) you shall find these plausible
similitudes of a tree, that will thrive the better, if it be remooved into the
more fruitful soil, and of sheep or cattle, that if they find a gap or
passage open, will leave the more barren pasture, and get into the more rich
and plentiful, to be but arguments merely superficial, and to have no sound
resemblance, with the transplanting or transferring of families, for the tree
we know by nature, as soon as it is set in the better ground, can fasten upon
it, and take nutriment from it, and a sheep as soon as he gets into the better
pasture, what should let him to grase or feed, But there belongs more I take
it, to a family or particular person, that shall remove from one Nation to
another, for if (Master Speaker) they have not stock, means, acquaintance, and
custom, habitation, trades, countenance, and the like, I hope you doubt not,
but they will starve in the midst of the rich pasture, and are far enough
from grazing at their pleasure, and therefore in this point, which is
conjecturall, Conjecturall experience.
experience is the best guide for the time past, is a pattern of the time to
come, I think no man doubts (Master Speaker) but his Majesty's first coming
in, was the greatest springtide for the confluence, and entrance of that
Nation.

Now I would fain understand in these four years space, and the fullness, and
strength of the Court and Tide, how many families of the Scotch men, are
planted in the Cities, Buroughs and Towns of this Kingdom, for I do assure
my self, then more then some persons of quality, about his Majesty's person
here at Court and in London, and some other inferior persons, that have a
dependence upon them, the return and certificate, if such a Survey should be
made, would be of a number extremely small, I report me to all your private
knowledges of the places where you inhabit.

Now (Master Speaker) as I said, Si in ligno viridi ita fit, quid fiet in
arido, I am sure there will be no more such spring tides; but you will tell me
of a multitude of families of the Scottish nation in Polania, and if they
multiply in a Country so far, how much more at hand, for that (Master
Speaker) you must impute it of necessity to some special accident of time and
prace that draws the^ thither: for you see plainly before your eyes, that in
Geneva, which is much nearer, where in France they are invited with
privileges, and with the very privilege of naturalization, yet no such number
can be found, so as it cannot either be neerenes of place, or privilege of
person that is the cause. But shall I tell you (Master Speaker) what I think;
In all the places of the world, near or far of, they will never take that
course of life in this Kingdom, which they content themselves with in Poland;
for we see ir to be the nature of all men that will rather discover poverty
abroad then at home; There is never a gentleman, that has over reached himself
in expenses, and thereby must abate his countenance, but he will rather
travel, and do it abroad, then at home, and we know well they have good high
stomachs, and have ever stood in some terms of emulation, and therefore they
will never live here except they can live in good fashion, so as I assure you
(Master Speaker) I am of opinion, that the first which we now have, to admit
them, will have like as that contention had between the Nobility and people of
Rome, for admitting of a Plebean Commonwealth, whilst it was in passage it was
very vehement, and mightily stood upon, and when the people had obtained it,
they never made any Plebean Consul, not in 60 years after, and so will this be,
for many years, as I am persuaded, rather a matter in opinion and reputation,
then in effect, and this is the first answer, that I give to this main
inconvenience pretended of surcharge of people.

The second answer, England not peopled to the full.
which I give to this objection is this, I must have leave to doubt (Master
Speaker) that this Realm of England is not peopled to the full, for certain it
is, that the territories of France, Italy, Flanders, and some part of Germany,
do in equal space of ground, bear and contain, a far greater quantity of
people, if they were mustered by the Poll, neither can I see, that this
Kingdom is so much inferior, unto those foreign parts in fruitfulness, as it
is in population, which makes me conceive we have not our full charge;
besides I do see manifestly amongst us, the badges and tokens, rather of
scarceness, then of press of people, as drowned grounds, Commons, Wastes, and
the like, which is a plain demonstration, that howsoever there may be an
overswelling throng and press of people, here about London, which is most in
our eye, yet the body of the Kingdom is but thin sown with people, and
whosoever shall compare the ruins and decays of ancient Towns in this Realm,
with the erectments and augmentations of new, cannot but judge that this Realm
has been far better peopled in former times, it may be in the Heptarchy, or
otherwise generally the rule holds, The smaller the State the greater the
population Pro rato, And whether this be true or no, we need not seek
further, then to call to our remembrance, how many of us serve here in this
place, for desolate and decayed Buroughs,

Again, Mediterrane, not Maritime Countries surcharged with people.
(Master Speaker) whosoever looks into the principle of estate, must hold,
that it is the Mediterrane Countries, and not the Maritime which need to fear
surcharge of people, for all sea provinces and especially Islands have an other
element besides the earth and soil, for their sustentation, what an infinite
of people are, and may be sustained by fishing, carriage by sea, and
merchandising, wherein I do again discover, that we are not all pricked by the
multitude of people, for if we were, it were not possible, we should
relinquish, and resign, such an infinite benefit of fishing, to the Flemming,
as it is well known we do, and therefore I see, that we have wastes by Sea,
as well as by land, which still is an infallible argument that our industry is
not awakned, to seek maintenance to any our great charge or press of people.
And lastly, (Master Speaker) there was never any Kingdom in this World, had I
think, so fair and happy means to issue and discharge them ultitude of their
people, as this Kingdom has, in regard of that desolate and wasted Kingdom of
Ireland, which being a country blessed with all most all the dowryes of
nature, as Rivers, Havens, Woods, Quarryes, good Soil, and temperate climate,
and now at last blessed under his Majesty also with obedience, does as it were
continually call unto us, for our Colonies and Plantations, and so I conclude
my second answer, to this pretended inconvenience of surcharge of people.

The third answer (Master Speaker) which I give is this, I demand what is the
worst effect that can follow of your surcharge of people, look into it and you
shall find it none other then some honorable war, for the enlargement of
their borders, which find themselves pent, upon foreign parts, with
inconveniences, which in a warlike Nation, I know not whether I should term
an inconvenience or not, for the saying is most true, though in an other lense,
Omne solum forti patria. It was spoken of the patience of an exiled man, but it
is no less true in the valor of a warlike Nation, and certainly (Master
Speaker) I hope I may speak it without offense, that whenever we should hold
our selves worthy, and whenever just cause should be given, either to
recover our ancient rights, or to revenge our late wrongs, or to attain the
honor of our ancestors, or to enlarge the patrimony of our posterities, we
would never in this manner forget the considerations of amplitude and
greatness, and fall at variance about profit and reckonings, fitter a great
deal for private persons, then for Parliaments, and Kingdoms, and thus
(Master Speaker) I leave this first objection, to such satisfactions as you
have heard of.

The second objection is, The fundamental Laws of England and Scotland are
diverse and several.
that the fundamental laws of these Kingdoms, of England and Scotland, are
yet diverse and several, nay more that it is declared by the instrument, that
they shall so continue; and that there is no intent in his Majesty to make
innovation in them, and therefore that it should not be seasonable, to proceed
to this Naturalization, whereby to endow them with our Rights and Privileges,
except they should likewise receive, and submit themselves to our laws, and
this objection likewise (Master Speaker) I allow to be a weighty objection and
worthy to be well answered, and discussed.

The answer which I shall offer is this, The answer to the second objection.
It is true for mine own part (Master Speaker) that I wish the Scottish Nation
governed by our Laws, for I hold our laws, with some reducement, worthy to
govern, and it were the World, but this is that which I say, and I desire
therein your attention, That according to true reason of estate, Naturalization
is in order first and precedent to union of Laws, and in nature seperable, and
in degree a less matter, and not inseparable from union of Laws, for
Naturalization does but take out the marks of a Forreiner, but union of Laws
makes them entirely as our selves, Naturalization takes away separation, but
union of laws does take away distinction, do we not see (Master Speaker)
that in the administration of the World under the great Monarch God himself
that his Laws are diverse, one Law in spirits, another in bodies, one Law in
Regions celestial, an other in Elementary, and yet the Creatures are all one
mass or lump, without any vacuum or separation, do we not likewise see in
the state of the Church, that amongst all people, of all languages, and
Linages, there is communion of Saints, and that we are all fellow Citizens,
and Naturalizants of the heavenly Jerusalem, And yet never the less, diverse
Ecclesiastical Laws, Policies and Heirarchies, according to the speech of that
worthy Father, In vest varietas sit, scissura non sit, and these certainly
(Master Speaker) as they are the bonds of love they are the more special and
private bond, and the bond of Naturalization, the more common and general, for
the laws are rather Figura Reipublicae, then forma, and rather Bonds of
perfection, then Bonds of entirenesse, and therefore we see in the experience
of our own government, that in the Kingdom of Ireland, all our Statutes and
Laws, Poynings Laws.
since Poynings Laws, are not in force, and yet we deny them not the benefit of
Naturalization, in Gersey and Jernesey and the Isle of Man, our common Laws
are not in force, and yet they have the benefit of Naturalization, neither need
any man doubt, but that our Laws and Customs must in small time gather and
win upon theirs, for here is the seat of the Kingdom, whence come the
supreme directions of estate, here is the Kings person and example of which
the verse says, Regis ad exemplum, totus componitur orbis.

And therefore it is not possible, although not by solemn and formal acts of
estates, yet by the secret operation of no long time, but they will come under
the yoke of our laws, and so Dulcis tractus pari jugo, and this is the answer
I give to the second objection.

The third objection, is some inequallity, Inequality in the fortunes between
England and Scotland.
in the fortunes of these two Nations, England and Scotland, by the commixture
whereof, there may ensue advantage to them, and loss to us, wherein (M.
Speaker) it is well that this difference or disparity consists, but in the
external goods of fortune, for indeed it must be confessed that for the goods
of the mind and body they are alteri nos, or our selves, for to do them but
right, we know in their capacities and understandings, they are a people
ingenious, in labor industrious, in courage valiant, in body hard, active, and
comely, more might be said, but in commending them, we do but in effect,
commend our selves, for they are of one part, and continent with us, and the
truth is, we are participant, both of their virtue, and vices, for if they have
been noted, to be a people not so tractable in government, we cannot without
flattering our selves, free our selves altogether from that fault, being indeed
incident to all martial people, as we see it evident by the example of the
Romans, and others, even like unto fierce horses, that though they be of better
service then others, yet are they harder to guide and manage.

But for this objection (Master Speaker) I purpose to answer it, not by the
authority of Scriptares, which says, Beatius est dare quam accipere, But an
authority, framed and derived from the judgment of our selves, and our
ancestors in the same case; as to the point, for (Master Speaker) in all the
lives of our Kings, none uses to carry greater commendation then his Majesty's
noble progenitor King Edward the first of that name, and amongst his other
co^mendations, both of war and policy, none is more celebrated, then his
purpose and enterprise, for that conquest of Scotland, as not bending his
designs, to glorious acquests abroad, but to solid strength at home, which
nevertheless if it had succeeded, could not but have brought in all these
inconveniences, of the commixture of a more opulent Kingdom, with a less,
Laws nor Arms cannot alter the nature of climats.
that are now alleged, for it is not the yoke, either of our laws or arms,
that can alter the nature of the Climate, or the nature of the soil, neither is
it the manner of the Commixture, that can alter the nature of Commixture, and
therefore (Master Speaker) if it were good for us then, it is good for us now,
and not to be prized the lesser, because we paid not so dear for it. But a
more full objection, I refer over to that, which will come after, to be spoken
touching surety, and greatness.

The fourth Objection (Master Speaker) is not properly an objection but rather
a preoccupation of an objection of the other side, for it may be said and very
materially, whereabouts we do contend, the benefit of Naturalization is by
the Law, in as many as have been, or shall be borne, since his Majesty's
coming to the Crown, already settled and invested, there is no more then, but
to bring the Ante-nati, into the degree of the Post-nati, that men grown, that
have well deserved, may be in no worse case, then children which have not
deserved, and elder brothers in no worse case, then younger brothers, so as we
stand upon quiddam non quantum, being but a little difference of time, of one
generation from an other, to this (M. Speaker) it is said by some, that the Law
is not so but that the postnati are aliens as the rest. A point, that I mean
not much to argue, both because it has been well spoken, by the gentleman that
spoke last before me, and because I do desire in this case, and in this
place, to speak rather of Conveniencie, then of Law, only this I will say,
that, that opinion seems to me contrary to opinion of Law, and contrary to
Authority, and experience of Law; for reason of Law, when I meditate of it, my
thinks the wisdom of the Common Laws of England well observed, is admirable
in the distribution of the benefit and protection of the Laws, according to the
several conditions of persons in an excellent proportion, the degrees are
four, but bipartite; two of Aliens, and two of Subjects.

The first degree is of an alien borne under a King, The first degree of an
alien.
or State, that is enemy, if such an one come into this Kingdom without safe
conduct, it is at his perrill, the Law gives him no protection neither for
Body, Lands, nor Goods, so as if he be slain, there is no remedy by any
appeal at the parties suit although the party were an English woman, marry at
the Kings suit, the case may be otherwise in reguard of the offense, to the
peace, and Crown.

The second degree is of an alien that is born under the faith and alleigeance
of a King or state, The second degree of an alien born under a State, that is
Friend.
that is a friend, unto such a person, the Law does imparte a great benefit and
protection that is concerning things personal, transitory and moveable, as
goods and chattells, contracts and the like, but not concerning freehold and
Inheritance, and the reason is because he may be an enemy, though he be not;
for the State under the obeisance of which he is may enter into quarrel, and
hostility, and therefore as the Law, has but a transitory assurance of him, so
it rewards him, but with transitory benefits.

The third degree is of a subject who having been an alien is by charter and
denisation, The third degree of an alien subject.
to such an one, the law does imparte, yet a more ample benefit, for it gives
him power to purchase freehold and inheritance to his own use, and likewise to
enable those Children, borne after his denization to inherit, but nevertheless
he cannot make title, or convey pedigree from any ancestors peramount, for the
Law thinks not good to make him in the same degree, with a subject born,
because he was once an alien, and so might once have been an Enemy, Et nemo
subito fingitur, affections cannot be settled by any benefit, as when from their
Nativity, they are imbred, and inherent.

And the fourth degree, The fourth degree the perfect degree.
which is the perfect degree, is of such a person, as neither is enemy, nor can
be enemy in time to come, nor would have been enemy in time past, nor can be
enemy in time to come, therefore the Law gives unto him, the full benefit of
Naturalization.

Now (Master Speaker) if these be true steps and paces of the Law; no man can
deny, but whosoever is borne under the Kings obedience never could in aliquo
puncto temporis be an enemy, and therefore in reason of Law, is natural, Nay,
contrariwise, he is bound Jure nativitatis to defend this Kingdom of England,
against all Innovators and Rebels, and therefore as he is obliged to the
protection of Aliens, and that perpetually, and universally, so he is to have
that perpetual and universal benefit and protection of laws which is
Naturalization.

For form of pleading it is true that has been said, that if a man, would
plead an other to be an alien, he must not only set forth negatively, and
primitively, that he was born out of the obedience of our Sovereign Lord the
King, but affirmatively, under the obediense of a foreign King, or state, in
particular, which never can be done in this case.

As for authority, I will not press it, you know all what has been published
by the Kings Proclamation, and for experience of Laws, we see it in the
subjects of Ireland, in the Subjects of Gernsey, and Iernesey, parcels of the
Duchy of Normandy, in the Subjects of Callis, when it was English, which was
parcel of the Crown of France, But as I said, I am not willing to enter into
an argument of Law, but to hold my self to point of conveniencie, so as for my
part, I hold all, Naturales ipso jure, But yet I am far from opinion, that it
should be a thing superfluous to have it done by.

Chiefly in respect of that true principal of State, Principum actiones ad
famam sunt Componendae, It will lift up a sign to all the World, of our Loves
toward them, and good agreement with them, and these are (Mr. Speaker, the
material objections, which have been on the other side, whereunto you have
heard my answers, weigh them in your wisdoms, and so I conclude that general
part.

Now (Master Speaker) according as I promised I must fill the other balance,
in expressing unto you the inconveniences, which we shall incur, if we shall
not proceed to this Naturalization, wherein that convenience above all others,
and alone by it self, if there were none other, does exceedingly moove me,
and may moove you, is a position of estate, collected out of the Records of
time, which is this, That whatsoever several Kingdoms or Estates, have been
united in Soverainty, if that union has not been fortified, and bound in with
a further union, and namely that which is now in question (of Naturalization)
this has followed, that at one time or other, they have broken, being upon all
occasions apt to relaps and revolt to the former Separation.

Of this assertion, The first example which I will set before you, is of the
memorable Union, The union between the Romans and the Latins.
which was between the Romans and the Latins, which continued from the Battle
at the Lake of Regilla, for many years unto the Consulship.

At what time, their began about this very point of Naturalization, that war
which was called Bellum Sociale, being the most bloody and pernicious war,
that ever the Roman State endured, wherein after numbers of battles, and
infinite sieges and surprises of Towns, the Romans in the end prevailed, and
mastred the Latins, And ever as they held the honor of the war, so looking
back into what perdition and confusion, they were near to have been brought,
they presently naturalized them all, you speak of a naturalization in blood,
there was a naturalization indeed in blood.

Let me set before you again, Sparta and Poloponcsus.
the example of Sparta and the rest of the Peneloponesus their associates. The
State of Sparta, was a nice and jealous state of this point of imparting
naturalization to their confederates. But what was the issue of it, after they
held them in a kind of society and amity for diversyeers, upon the first
occasion given which was no more then the surprisall of the Castle of Thebes,
by certain desperate conspirators in the habit of Masters, there ensued
imediately a general revolt and defection of their associates, which was the
ruin of their State never afterward to be recovered.

Of latter times, The Union of the Kingdom of Arragon.
Let me lead your considerations, to behold the like events in the Kingdom of
Arragon, which Kingdom was united with Castile, and the rest of Spain, in the
persons of Ferdinando, and Isabella, and so continued many years, but yet so as
it stood a Kingdom severed and divided from the rest of Spain in privileges,
and directly in this point of Naturalization, or capacity of inheritance, what
came of this, Thus much, that now of fresh memory, not past twelve years
since, only upon the voice of a condemned man, out of the grate of a prison,
toward the street, that cried (...) which is as much as Liberties or
Privileges, there was raised a dangerous rebellion, which was suppressed with
difficulty with an army Royal, and their privileges disanulled, and they
incorporated, with the rest of Spain, upon so small a spark, notwithstanding
so long continuance, were ready to break, and sever again.

The like may be said of the State of Florence, Florence and Pisa.
and Pisa, which City of Pisa being united unto Florence, but not endued with
the benefit of Naturalization, upon the first sight of foreign assistance,
Charles the Eighth.
by the expedition of Charles the 8th. of France into Italy, did revolte,
though it be since again reunited, and incorporated.

The same effect we see in the most barbarous Government, The like effects in
barbarous governments.
which shows it the rather to be an effect of nature, for it was thought a
fit policy by the council of Constantinople, to retain the Provinces of
Transylvania, Valachia, and Moldavia, which were as the nurses of
Constantinople, in respect of their provisions, to the end they might be the
less wasted, only under Vayvods, as Vassals and Homagers, and not under
Bashaws, as Provinces of the Yurkish Empire, which policy we see by late
experience proved unfortuuate, as appeared by the revolt of the same three
Provinces, under the Armies and Conduct of Sigismond Prince of Transylvania a
leader very famous for a time, which revolt is not yet fully recovered, whereas
we seldom or never hear of revolts of Provinces incorporate to the Turkish
Empire.

On the other part (Master Speaker) because it is true, which the Logicians
say, Opposita juxta se posita magis, Let us take a view, and we shall find
that wheresoever Kingdoms and States have been united, and that union
incorroberate, Naturalization a sure bond.
by the bond of Naturalization mutually, you shall never observe them
afterward upon any occasion of trouble or otherwise, to break, and sever
again, as we see most evidently before our eyes, in our Provinces of France
that is to say Guyen, Province, Normandy, Britain, which notwithstanding the
infinite infesting troubles of that Kingdom, never offered to break again.

We see the like effect, in all the Kingdoms of Spain, which are mutually
Naturalized as Leon, Castile, Valentia, Andaluzia, Granada, and the rest,
except Arragon which held the contrary course, and therefore had the contrary
success, as it was said of Portugal, of which there is not yet sufficient
trial, and lastly we see the like effect, England never severed after once
united.
in our own Nation, which never rent asunder after it was united, so as we now
scarce know whether the Heptarchy were a Story or a Fable, and therefore
(Master Speaker) when I revolue with my self, these examples and others, so
lively expressing the necessity of a Naturalization to avoid a relaps into a
separation, and do here see many arguments and scruples on the other side, it
makes me think on the old Bishop which upon a public disputation of certain
Christian Divines, with some learned men of the heathen, did extremely press
to be heard, and they were loath to suffer him, because they knew he was
unlearned, though otherwise an holy, and well meaning man, But at last, with
much ado he got to be heard, and when he came to speak, in stead of using
Argument, he did only say over his belief, but did it with such assurance and
constancy, that it did strike the minds of those that heard him, more then any
Argument had done, and so (Master Speaker) against all these witty and subtle
Arguments, I say I do believe, and I would be sorry to be found a prophet in
it, that except we proceed with this Naturalization, though not perhaps in his
Majesty's time, who has such interest in both nations, yet in the mean time
of his Discendants, these realms will be in continual danger, to divide and
break again, now if any man be of that careless mind, Maneat mors ea, ea
cura nepotes.

Or of that hard mind to leave things to be tried by the sharpest sword, sure
I am, he is not of Saint Paul's opinion, who affirms that whosoever uses not
foresight and provision for his family, is worse then an unbeliever, much more
if we shall not use foresight, for these two Kingdoms, that comprehend in
them so many families, but leave things open to the peril of future divisions,
and thus have I expressed unto you, what inconveniences, of all others sink
deepest with me, as the most weighty, neither does their want other
inconveniences (Master Speaker) the effects and influence whereof, I fear will
not be adjourned to so long a day, as this that I have spoken of, But I leave
it to your considerations, and wisdoms, to consider, whether you do not
think, in case by the denial of this Naturalization, any Pike, alienation, or
unkindnesse, I do not say should be, but should be thought to be, or noised
to be between these two Nations, whether it will not quicken or exite, all
the envious, and malicious humors, wheresoever (which are now covered) against
us, either foreign or at home, and so open the way to practice, A binding
inconvenience.
and other Engines, and machinations, to the disturbance of this State. As for
that other inconvenience, it is too binding and too pressing to be spoken of,
and may do better a great deal in your minds then in my mouth, or the mouth
of any man else, because as I have said it does press our liberty too far,
and therefore (M. Speaker) I come to this third general part of my division,
concerning the benefit which we shall purchase, by knitting this knott, surer
and straiter, between these two Kingdoms, by the Communicating of
Naturalization.

The benefits may appear to be two, the one surety the other greatness,
touching surety (Master Speaker) it was well said by Titus Quintus the Roman,
The benefit of Surety.
touching the State of Pelopenesus, that the Tortoise is safe within her shell,
Testudo inter tegumen tutaest, but if there be any parts that ly open, they
endanger all the rest, we know well, that although the state at this time be
in a happy peace, yet for the time past, the more ancient enemy is the French,
and the more late the Spaniard, and both these had as it were, their several
postern gates, whereby they might have approach and entrance, to anoy us,
France had Scotland and Spain had Ireland, for these were but the two accesses
which did comfort and encourage, both these enemies to assail and trouble us,
we see that of Scotland is cut off, by the Union of these two Kingdoms, if
that it shall be made constant and permanent, that of Ireland is cut off
likewise by the convenient situation of the North of Scotland, toward the
North of Ireland, where the sore was, which we see being suddenly closed by
means of this salve, so that as now there are no parts of the State exposed to
danger to be a temptation to the ambition of Forreiners, but their approches
and avenues are taken away, for I do little doubt but these Forreners, which
had so little success, when they had those advantages, will have much less
comfort, now that they be taken from them, and so much for surety.

For greatness (Master Speaker) I think a man may speak it soberly, The
benefit of greatness.
and without bravery, that this Kingdom of England, having Scotland united;
Ireland reduced, the Sea provinces of the low Countries Contracted, and
shipping maintained, is one or the greatest Monarchies, in forces truly
esteemed, that has been in the World, for certainly the Kingdoms here on
earth, have a resemblance with the Kingdom of Heaven, which our Savior
compares not to any great Kirnell or nut, but to a very small grain, yet such
an one as is apt to grow and spread, and such do I take to be the Constitution
of this Kingdom, if indeed our Country be referred to greatness and power,
and not quenched too much with the consideration of utility and wealth, for (M.
Speaker) was it not think you a true answer, that Solon of Greece made to
rich King Croesus of Lydia, when he showed unto him a great quantity of Gold
that he had gathered together in ostentation of his greatness and might, but
Solon said to him contrary to his expectation, why Sir, if an other come that
has better Iron then you, he will be Lord of all your Gold; neither is the
authority of Machiavel to be despised, who scorneth the proverb of State,
taken first from a speech of Mucianus, that moneys are the sinews of wars, and
says, there are no true sinews of wars, but the very Arms of valiant men.

Nay more (Master Speaker) whosoever shall look into the seminary, The
beginning of Monarchies founded in poverty
and beginning of the Monarchy of the world, he shall find them founded in
poverty.

Persia a Countery barren and poor in respect of Media whom they seduced.
Macedon.


Macedon a Kingdom ignoble, and mercenary until Phillip the Son of Amyntas.

Rome had poor and pastoral beginning. Rome.


The Tuoks a band of Sarmathian Scithes, The Turks.
that in a vagabond manner made impression upon that part of Asia which is
called Turcomania, out of which, after much varieties of fortune, sprung the
Othoman family now the terror of the World.

So we know the Goths, Vandalls, Alans, Huns, Lombards, Normans, and the rest
of the Northern people, in one age of the World, made their descent and
expedition upon the Roman Empire, and came not as rovers to carry away prey
and begun again, but planted themselves in a number of rich and fruitful
Provinces, where not only their generations, but their names remain to this
day, witness Lombardy, Catalonia, a name compounded of Goth and Alan,
Andaluzia, a name corrupted from Vandelitia, Hungaria, Normandy, and others.

Nay the fortune of the Swisses of late years, The Switzers.
which are bred in a barren and mountenous Country, is not to be forgotten,
who first ruined the duke of Burgundy, the same who had almost ruined the
Kingdom of France, what time after the battle near Granson, The rich Jewel
of Burgundy, prised at many thousands, was sold for a few pence, by a common
Swisse, that knew no more what a jewel meant, then did Esopes Cock; and
again, the same Nation in revenge of a scorn was the ruin of the French
Kings affairs in Italy, Lewis the 12. for that King, when he was pressed
somewhat rudely, by an agent of the Swissers, to raise their pensions, brake
into words of choler, (what says he) will these villains of the mountain put
a task upon me, which words lost him his Duchy of Millain, and chased him out
of Italy.

All which examples (Master Speaker) do well prove Solons opinion, of the
authority and Majesty that Iron has over Gold, and therefore if I shall speak
unto you mine own heart, me thinks we should a little disdain, that the
Nation of Spain, which howsoever of late it has begun to rule, yet of ancient
time, served many ages, first under Carthage, then under Rome, after under
Saracens, Goths and others, should of late years take unto them that Spirit,
as to dream of a monarchy in the West, according to that devise, vidi Solemn
Orientem in Occidente, only because they have raised, from some wild, and
unarmed people, Mines and store of Gold, and on the other side, that this
Island of Britain, seated and named as it is, and that has, I make no
question, the best Iron in the World, that is the best soldiers of the World,
shall think of nothing but accounts and audits, and meum and tuum and I cannot
tell what.

(Master Speaker) I have I take it, gone through the parts which I propounded
to my self, wherein if any man shall think I have sung a placebo, for mine
own particular, I would have him know that I am not so unseene in the world,
but that I discern, it were much alike for my private fortune a tacebo, as to
sing a placebo in this business, But I have spoken out of the Fountain of my
heart, Credidi propter quod locutus sum, I believed, therefore I spoke, so as
my duty is performed, The Judgments is yours, God direct it for the best.

FINIS.
