and stabbed them, also that he said he is the Son of God, and if they put him to

THE Description of the MAN, etc.
THIS Roalond Bateman was borne at Pearet near ^ocester, in the County
Northampton, Anno. Dom. 1601. by profesion aday Labourer; having (at this
present) a Wife and a Child in the Pari^h of Saint Maryes Newington in
Southwarke, his Complexion rudy, Beard red, his statude indiffrent between
short and tall, his Apparill (at this present,) showing him to be a man of no
exraordinary quality; his behavior is extreme rude, Silv estrick and barborus
Steeld, as it wear, with a stupid impudency (and self conseit,) as appears
plainly to all that discorces with him for it is clear (to the industrious
hearer) that if he can read (at all,) it is but evry little yet two men of
great Literatu^e and Quality both of the Clergy and the Latin, (that examine
him about his Blasphemyus opinions,) he will fastudiously, with unparaled
Petulency say, that it is lost Labor for him to tell them of the Scripture,
for none but himself in the World knows the sense and meaning of it but the
relation of this belongs to the next divinition (concerning his oppinions) to
which I will briefly hasting concluding this, first (according to my promise)
with the cause of his commitment to prison which is onorable to speak, for he
says (with great a severity a beholding) that he would kill good LORD I
beceech thee protect them ftom danger.

Some certain Lords of the PARLIAMENT, when he came into Prison (which was on
Monday May the 13. he seemed to be drunk, (by all there present,) and
theref^re to prevent, misdemeanors, he was set (with both his feet) in the
stocks, thinking that by that puninshment he would return to his wits retract
his wicked words (though) the hopfull expection of Clemency and pardon, but he
on the next day, (and even sense) in stead of sorrow for his words did (and
still does) audatiously and obtinatly defended his damnable intention,
persevering still in speaking detestable and vilinous speeches, not fit by any
Christian to be rel^ted no more of this but (to proceed in his description,) it
is to humon reason a most miraclous and all together impossible things that a
man should as he has (by most certain Testimon^es, and if need requier
doposicions) of seven or eight men who are (and have been) not only daily
nightly, and hourly, but also monthly, with him. He has lived from the 13 of
May afforesaid to this present June. 7. (the date of this present wrighting)
and GOD knows how long he may live so (for he says he does not without the
eateing of any manner of food, and yet is at this instant every way it lusty
strong and cheerful as before saying he fe^t no hunger) as he did the same or
(rather the next) day after he came into the Prison, thus much concerning the
first d^vinition of the Man.

Second divinition his Blasphemyus opinions which are so many and several, (he
quotidialy or raither almost howery add^ng and changing that to set down all
exactly were to make a Divrnall of one and twenty days Fantasies, therefore
to show some thing of a story scarce possible to be puntually ^elared. I will
coursly epitonure what I can remember, and most in the house will just^f^e for
me of his stolid impudince and most abomin^b^e blasphemyus opinions such as I
have at sundry times anciqurarily colected from his examination be-fore persons
of good Le^rning and Q^al^^y,

1 Imprimiis in one examination ((...) to still) which was that he said he is
Abell the rightonal and the^ was slain from the begin^ng of the World, and
shall he slain again (for he says that he knows he shall be hanged very
shortly) and then there shall be peace in England (if he speak true I would he
were hanged quickly as a good Woman answered him) but he says that on the
third day, he shall rise again and walk about at Liberty never to dye again
a Gent^^-man a^ked him how he knew that was of his opinion; he answered? none
in the world but himself and King Charles who are both spiret only this
difference that (says he) I am as was Abraham, and the Kin^ Charles is my
son Isack he was further asked another time, how long he did think he should
continue this fast, he answered? forty days and forty nights, and it may be
more, but at the end of his fasting he should be hanged (as before said)
trancelated and then there would be peace in the Land, another demanded of him
whence he drew his opinions, (out of the Scripture quoth he?) what part (said
the oponent) in the twenty first Chapter of the Book of Genises quoth he? and
from thence he wen^ on with a d^bolicall naration of John the Baptist and of
Christ which (oh horable blasphemius) he said is not come in substance but is
shadow of all which unchristian a se^ti^^s being required par^ation he told the
Gentleman that if he should show him Scripture for ^t, they cold not understand
it nor any man but himself who alone had the Holy Ghost with him, one thing,
let me not om^tt to tell you (whilst it is in my memory and which I will l^nd
you my ^udgmen^s hearaf^er in the due Place,) when p^^p^e ^^me to see (and
hear) him, he will presently before he spe^kes any thing (as they would have
him) have recorse to the Words of his o^d Partion Judas what will you give me,
for he is not ash^med most inselent^y being related in the conf^dence of vox
populy to say I^e not s^y any thing for nothing pay and I Will say* (O w^se
Prophet or raither Prophet gatherer but I must judge of him hearafter; it were
both tedious and impossible to tell you all be to! to so ma y several sorts of
People that hourly flock unto him, for as I said before, he does so change and
so add (from his first pr^ncipales that he has almost a new saying for every
new C^mp^ny an^ so abom^nable^y impudent he is grown,) in his stu^id^^y that
whatsoever he s^ith you must not co^troduct, if you do he being unable to
de^^nd his Argument retreates to his common posture you cannot understand me
if I should tell you, and thi^ is al^ that you shall get out of him;
(whatsoever is objected against him,) Counsel h^^ (as many good people have
done,) to serve God and leave this life, and show for pardon upon rec^ntation
of his errors, then you do (as it were) use oil to quench fire for he s^ornes
your advice and says, ^^u are no^ capable of that which he means and knows
^he best learned men in the Land no^ expected he is so fool h^^dy confident in
these deirsion that he seems to defi^e nothing sooner then hanging the sooner
the better say I quoth a Woman to him, if then we might have Peace now I
remember this was mentioned before, but it is no great matte^ for he talks of
it so often that he seems at have more mind to it then heaven bless him from
beter fortunes, on Sat^day last in the afternone some of his fellow prisoners
in the hearing were talking with him about this Arguments, viz.

That about nine years hence he said all men and women must first fast as he
does now and after that they shall die and scone after r^se again and live
some an hundred and twenty years without eating of and sustiance and that some
others should never die but ^ive everlastingly on the earth as he shall three
days After he is hanged then it was demanded of him what he thouh^t of of the
general judgment day he answered? it would come in the intrum of those nine
years for do you not se quoth he that it is coming near to this present, when
the Father fights against the Son and Son against the Father, etc. thus
persumeth this ignorant fellow to talk of these mysteries which the eternal
wisdom of the father (as he was man) nor the Angels in Heaven neither can not
could set down the time when I think it is high time to leave him and his
blasphemyus follyes to the mercy any judgmen^s of GOD and our superiowes and
according to my promise and capasity I will spend my judgment upon him in the
ensuing third and last divition and make and end of the story.

The third upon him etc. with this in brief aluding to what you have heard of
his sayings and doings, that he is an absolute imposture and as far to be
credited as a true prophet or servant of COD, as were immediate four Fathers
Hacket, Atherington and Copinger Buell, with his Brother Farnum who were both
Weavers, about some five or six years sense be that in not with me is against
me says Christ but this man is not perfectly with Christ but rather a fore
ru^^er of Antichrist who shall deny Christ to be come in the flesh and he said
as I told you before that Christ is not come in substance but in shadow
therefore he can neither be true prophet not true Christian moreover by the fru
t you may judge the tree, and the Man by his words and works he is easly
deserned to be a false Prophet, if he will be cal^ed a Prophet being by nature
extreme proud and averissious as well appears by the promise and concerning
^ust of womem which was a point which I forget to tell you before he says that
no woman that commits adultery commits sin against GOD out an offense against
man and diverse erelidgious and unchristian words he utters to his audi nce:
that I will not marulat pure paper with all by which it is evedent that he is
not a man inspired with the Holy Ghost, as he most aregantly says, but raither
a Monster possessed with an unclean lying spiret, for briefly to avoid all
further contruercies in this point, we are promised ar the end of the World, no
true prophet for we ought to cheer and stick close to ^he Doctrine of faith
already received, but on the contrary we ^re warned to beware of false
Prophets, therefore if any man or Angel from Heaven (and the Divill can by Gods
permition tranceforme himself into an Angel of light, should teach us any
other Doctrine then what we have been taught from the b^gining of our faith let
him be an Athemy, therefore this permitious imposture holding and devolging
such opinions before mention^d qiute repugnant to Christ and his true Gospel
judge not Christan Reader amiss of me if I judge and condemn him and all such
brave like humores for psudo* prophets who forsaking the true Spiret which from
the beginning has been the Instructor of the true Church to teach and to lead
her unto all truth by Gods highly provocted judgment are g^ven over unto a
Reprobate sense, to believe all manner of Lies, Dreams, Delusions and
Fantasies, which the Devil that arch Lier shall direct unto them. now
concerning his maruilose substaining ftom food without impayring strength
changing of eyes or countinance, and not as yet feeling hunger as he says. I
confess it is beyond my Capasety, or the most learned Philosepher or Physician
in the Kingdom, to render and natural ^eason of it. But a French Gentleman
said that in his Country he has known the like and he said it is a particular
humor in a man which in our languish we call P^p^nderiaco which is a
self-conceite, some upon one humor some upon another, some obstaning from food
some from sleep, a third from coming not near the fire in the coldest
weather, all this to wine admitation and poppuler wonder, the enemy of
mankind, lending them force to do it, as he is said to be God Ape, so his
desiple in such things will seem to immitate the dearest and nearest Servants
of God see the south says of Egypt counterfeted the supernatural marcies of
Moses, so long as Divine power would suffer it. So Simon Magous contended with
Simon Peeter till his charm with his ncke were broken. so this Theasonic^ll
imposture makes no question but as the holy Prophet Elias our blessed Savior
fasted forty days and forty nights he would presume by his wicked Spiters
assistance to do the like unless the Hangman which the seems so earnestly to
wish for to break his neck in the intrume this gentle Christian Reader I have
according to promise sent thee from this house of care a short and brevi are
epitamy of a Subject requiring a longer exponsion but now I think on a little
of a bad matter is enough if not to much I confess the multitude of people
coming howerly to him was the sp^re of ^yt^ much leisure to be employed in this
task rail.

A Postscript of some things more then was promised.
IT is to you fond People whom I wright,
Whose iching ears, and hungery appetite,
After n^w fangles, new opinions and;
The new (invented) Sests (bane of the Land:
Who come to see, hear, and aplade this knave;
Whose fasting feasts your fancyes, as I have;
(With wonder) hears cheifely the famale Sects.
And many simple men to these Annex,
Unto his self conceits such Prophets that he;
(For Money) seems what they would have him he,
They Will swallow down his blasphemyus descorces
And hier him with exspence of their one purses:
And what an age is this which we now live in,
Are we true chiistians, raither Jews or Heathen,
When Christ his Word, and Doctrine is deparaved
Shall we hope by Christ ere to be saved;
Countinance such a man, nay pay him fort,
As though his blasphemy to us were sport,
All those which nothing give ^elle surce and baine,
Judge Reader is this not a Holy man,
FINIS,
