Every man that is of ye truth hearethe my voice. Ioa^. xviij.

Despise not the doctrine and warninge of the Prophet of God.

A Prologe into ye Prophet Isaye.
THis is the book of ye sainges and acts of ye prophet Isaye chefist of al
prophets / as co^cerninge ye office of ouerseinge / preaching / and diligent
watchinge over the congregra^^^ of god^ which office is nolesse pere^ouse t^e^
(...) boriouse. This is Isaye so often in theuangelists mouths / so familiare
with Joan baptist and Paul / and of fich autorite with Christ / yt he took this
book and opened it and red ye. Iwes a lesson thereof in their synagoge at
Nazareth. Luc. iiij. This book declarethe how faithfully Isaye watched and
waited on his flok / with what constancy he warned / how sharply he corrected
and rebuked and at last conforted the zagene. This prophet was in like
troublouse time and synful world as we are now: when destruccio^ and captivity
was at hand / and men were fled bakwarde from ye true worshype of god to ye
worshippinge of stocks and stones / puttinge al their confidence in vtwarde
work is and holiness invented of their own brains: when al was done with power
and tyranye / with out equite / trwe judgment / and good order Whereby we may
well see y^ merciful goodness of god which in so troublouse and synfula state
steredvp (as he does now) so excellent a wit and so fervent a sprite^
prophet.

When men ar given to sin and lust / then set they al their minds to
disgoyse their self / and so to play the hypocrites yt what so eur they do /
it shall be so kraftely handled / so colored / so painted yt it may apere well
and rightuously / ye and godlely done / be it never so cruel neur so ungodly:
and this their hypocrisy when they entende to stay it most with supersticion
and eloquence as with two strong pyllers (I will not set audacite between the^
/ for yt same hypocrisy is ye most vnshamefaced boldenes) then through
supersticion feign they godlynes / and by eloquence erudicio^ and knowledge. But
agenste this krafty effeminate mockinge monstre (as Isaye paynteth her) thus
stayed on and not aftyr his own doctrine and precepts / puttinge our vain
confidence in our works leauinge his commandments undone. Also in readinge
this heavenly Prophet / we must consider y^ we are the spiritual Israel and
Judah of the sede of Abraham by faith unto whom the law is given and promyses
ar made that god will be our god allalone sufficient if we be perfect and walk
in his ways Geness. xvij. Not withstandinge yet ar we aftyr y^ flesh the
very gentyles who^ god of his mercy has called into the place of the Iwes to
benamed his people. We must also remember in readi^ge this book that Isaye
preaches to us and not to the carnal Israel only. It is we that now labor
in like idolatrye and sin / let us therefore take his warninges and terrible
threateninges unto ourselves / there is now the same god / y^ same Christ
yesterdaye to day and the same to continue for ever. Hebre.xiij. the same
holygoste the same savior and that through the same faith / the same mercy /
justice / and judgment abydinge us: the carnal Israel before othr nations was
cut out of Abraham: but we by y^ spirit of election throw faith ar cutoute
of the stone yt is christ Isay.li. Israel descended into Egipte there
oppressed in hard seruitute: we descend into our own ways oppressed with
sin for the which we are under the danger of hell and death. Israel had
their pass over in the rememberaunce of their delyuerance out of Egypt we have
owr lamb christ offered for us into a perpetual memorial of owr delyueraunce
from sin hell and death. Israel for their unbelief was forsaken / blinded /
and assailed of the Madianites / Amalekts / of y^ Assyrio^s of y^ Antiochens
and Rhomans / which burnt their temple destroyed their land and led the^ into
captivity: we for our unbelief are not with out our spiritual Sennacherib /
Nabuchodonosor / Antioche / and our Rhoma^s continually fighti^ge against Christ
and us leadi^g us into captivity vndr their traditions / burni^ge y^ very
temple of god and dest-roying eury ouerseer or preachr plentuously find al
manner of riches yt may make for the edifyinge of Christ's flock: and take
away siche a bishop from Mosesbokis as Isaye is / and thexample yt he left us
to follow in expoundinge the law (the prophets interpret ye law and the
new testament expounds the^ both) and thou shittest up the law and put
it owte of mind.

Owte of Isayes schole it pleased god to send these two lights / that is to
say Joan baptiste and Paul: him to y^ blind phary says and to their blind
disciples the Iwes / and this to illumyn the gentyls sittinge yet in derkenes.
Joan baptiste with out doubt preached many a sermon to many men before they
flocked forth so fast to him to be baptized co^fessinge their sins / but
out of what prophets schole he was sent / the theme and argument of his
sermons / the roughe rebukinge and sharp threatening so freely so boldly with
out fear of man of what estate so ever he was plainly declares. Said he
not freely to the pharisayes and Saduceys. Mat. iij. For all they were in so
great opinion and autorite with the people for their vtwarde holiness / said he
not openly to these hypocrytes / O ye edders whelps who shall show you the
way to avoid the vengeance to come? And with Paul was there no Prophet so
familiare so ready to prove and to confirm his sayings as was Isaye / as it
aperethe in his pistels and sermons / especially in his pistle to the Romans.
Where in the nienthe and tenthe Chapit. When he came unto the calling of the
Gentyles into the place of the Iwes now fallen away and rejected (which
calling of the Gentyles and fall of the Iwes Isaye saw and prophesied here
most clearly) how thick (I pray you) alleged he Isaye be name bri^gi^ge i^
his full sentences and hol testimones garneshinge his pistle with thez as y^
stars ornowerne y^ firmament? so yt it may be thought he watrd not his
garde^s of any othr prophets ryuers so plentuously and so often / as he did of
Isayes sweet floudes runninge in them so puerly so plentuously and so swetely.
But what needs me to remember the servants when y^ Master of all broughtyn no
prophets testimones so sone as he did his prophet Isays the son of Amoz? As
when he came to Nazareth where he was broughtup and aftyr the custom entered
into their Synagoge on the Sabbath day and rosup to read his lesson / there
was delyuerde him the book of Isaye the prophet as ye may se Luce. iiij.
which he opened and fyndinge this place of Isaye in the.lxj. chap. read saying
The spirit of god is with me / for the lord has anointed me / and sent me
to preach his gospel to the poor afflicte and troubled in mind / to byndup
the woundis of the^ yt ar wounded and co^trite i^ heart / to shewforth
delyueraunce to men in captivity / and to open ye preson to men in hold / to
publesshe the time of grace decreed of the lord. and cetera. And when he had
read / he shitte the book and restored it to y^ ministre of the Synagoge.

And now at the last (the world corrupt with the same Idolatrye and like
abhominacio^ as it was in Isayes time and at Christ's coming / vhom therefore
there must needs abide like destruction and captivity / if we be not captyue al
redye) God of his infinite goodness has restored us his prophet Isaye
speakinge plain english which have been locked up long in latyne so yt the
lay man (I dare say) understood him not / nor yet parauenture many that
repute thez self learned. Now may we read him for the most part
gatheri^ge great fruit with out any great gloss / so yt we bring with us a
pure heart purged from all carnal affects asking understanding of god by
whose spirit it was al spoken: so that we knowledge our ungodliness our
Idolatrye and false worshipe with our lips / our hearts being far from god
which hitherto have: rendered fear and worship to him aftyr the doctrine and
co^maundeme^ts of men Isaye.xxix ethr side / y^ goodness of god has ever set
godlynes and erudicio^ / not this erudicion which is sone puftvp with y^ hastye
wind of vain glory / but yt which is i^fla^med with ye soft oil of charity /
yt ye godly learned might mor clearly se and pearse through ye vain vysare of
hypocrysy. Fore where ca^ supersticio^ bid her self but godlynes will find her
out? and how cannot pai^ted eloquence and bold babbling but fear godly
erudicion? Wherefore / when it was so yt in Isayes time vice reigned so sore
(but yet through y^ favor of hypocrysy it was taught for virtue) and curiouse
fables walked in yt stead of goddis word / the lord steredvp this heavenly
wit who^ he had made before to fight agenste this wylye effeminate monstre
with all her long tail / thinking it convenient for yt state of ye world to
bri^gforth so well appointed a prophet agenste so delycate an enymye: which
prophet shulonot only fight with strength / but also with prudence and polycye /
yt y^ spirit shuldnot want his aparel / and yt because in those days men
studied to painte their speech and to color their words. Whr for his
counsel (which cannot be deceived) took effect: and this prophet camforth a
man right godly / prudent / co^sta^t / vehement / learned / ientle / well
nourtred / and of a singler wit: which so stretched forth al ye powers of
his gifts agenst this visard hypocrysy and effeminate skorner for ye poor
chirches profit / ye his godlynes with erudicion / his prudence with humanite /
his constancy with vrbanite / his rebukinge with vehemence / al togithr might
fight in their place and time: so yt if thou woldst esteem all the gifts of a
prophet with pure judgment / set Isaye alone: to whose faithful office of
preaching and prophesying god joined so excellent erudicion and grace and gave
him unto us / unto us (I say) and not only to the people of Judah. Let us
therefore with thanks hear and read this godly Prophet diligently / in whom
we shall find the heavenly and clear solutions of al q^stions pertaining to
christen religion: here shall roying his people. Israel went dry shode thorou
ye sea / his enimes drowned: we are led suerly thorou y^ perellouse ieoperdes
of this i^^et and troublouse world so full of persecution / wheryn our Pharao /
this Leuiatha^ / this Dragon plays mocketh and takes his plesur for a time
Isaye.xxvij. but he is now in drowni^ge synking down to ye botome like lead
/ killed with ye breathe of goddis mouth / yt is to say with his almighty
word: for now is y^ day cu^ of y^ which Isaye their speaks y^ y^ lord shall
viset this inui^cible serpent Leuiatha^ with his hard / great and mighty sword
/ yt is to say with his eurlastinge word / which so mercifully now offered us
we do not only receive but violently resist it with sword fyet and watr and with
othr i^numerable and i^tolerable torme^ti^ges and ignomynes / Let us know lege
this greuouse offense committed against god / against his word / and y^
professors thereof: we are al sinners and wa^te ye praise (as says Paul. Romans
iij) yt shuldbe given of us to gad / yt is to say we wa^te yt faith wherbi he
would be glorified: then praysle and glorifye we God when we believe yt christ
is given us to dye for our right wis maki^ge as testifyeth paul Roma. iiij. of
Abraham / which made strong in faith gave this praise and honor to god /
assuerd and persuaded that he yt promised him was able to perform it and cet.
In this sentence is Isaye hole: whom to hear faithfully / to read freely and
diligently / to understand truly / grant us our mercyful fathr which would
al his elect to be saved and come to the knowledge of ye trutheby his spirit of
truth. Amen.

Burn no more goddis word: but me^ de it where it is not truly translated.

A note / for the clearer understanding of the Prophet.

ye must hold diligently in mind y^ storye of these.iiij. kings in whose
days Isaye prophesied / which storye begins at the.xv. Chapter of the
fowerth book of the kings where Azarias called here Ozias began to raygne
and so forth to ye reign of Josias: read also in the second book of
Paralipoin. from the.xxvj. to the.xxxviij. chap.

The division of this book according to these.iiij. kings / and what was
prophesied in each of their days.

Under Ozias / Isaye prophesied from y^ beginni^ge of his book unto the.vj.
chap Vndr Iotha^ he saw y^ vision of ye.vj. cap. Vndr Ahaz he prophesied from
the end of y^ sixte unto the end of the.xiiij. cap.

Under Ezechias he spoke fro^e the.xiiij. unto the.xl. chapter. The rest unto
the end of the book we have no certayntye whethr he spoke it vndr Ezechias or
in Manasses days his successor But this is certain that from the.xl. cap.
unto the.xlix. he prophecieth y^ storye of king Cyrus and the deliverance out
of y^ captivity of Babylon / and from the.xlix. unto ye bokis end / he
prophecieth clearly with out any figure of Christ and of his church /
notwithstondinge yet vndr ye for said kings he mixte his sayi^ges with many
clear prophecyingis of Christ and his kingdom.

The title of this book.
The vilsonor Prophecy of Isaye / the son of Amoz: which he prophesied upon
Judah and Jerusalem / in the days of Ozias / Iotha^ / Ahaz / Ezechias / Kings
of Judah.
The first Chapter.
Hear heaven / and listen earth: for it is the Lord that speaks. Childerne
have I noureshte up and promoted / and they have despyghtfully rebelled age^ste
me. The unreasonable ox knows his owener: and the very ass his masters
stall: but Israel is insensible / my people is with out understanding. Oh
synful nation / a nation laden with wikednes / a myschevous generation /
pestelent children. The very Lord have they forlake^ / and even him that chose
and made holy Israel have they provoked to anger / and are fled backwarde.
with what plage more shall I then smite you? since the more ye ar correkt y^
worse ye are. All your heads ache and every heart is full syk: from top to toe
is there not an hole place in all your body All are wounds / runninge sores /
full of botches and blaynes / which noman may cleanse or bynd plaster to / nor
yet sowple with any oyntement. your regio^ is desolate / your cites are brent
up with fire / your land before your eyes a strange nation devowerth: It is
wasted lyk as with a cruel host. And y^ daughter of Zion is left a lone lyk
an hovelin a vine yard / like a skoulke lodge in time of war / and like a
beseged cite. And except ye lord of powers had saved us a few reamnauntes /
we had be^ like So dome and Gomorre. Hear therefore the word of the Lord ye
princes of Sodom: And thou people of Gomorre / take heed to the law of owre
God saying thus: what have I to do with yower so manyfolde and so often
offeringes and sacrifices? I abhor yower burnt wethers: I am full of the
kidnese of yower fat beasts / the blood of oxen / of la^bes and gotes they
yrke me. When ye come to se my face / who requires these of feri^ges at your
hands? Is this y^ way to trede my temple? Offere no more (I pray you) your
gifts thus in vain. this ince^se is abhominacion to me: your festes of the
new moan / your Sabbath days / and solemn festes I may not a way with:
for full wyked are yower idle congregacions / yower kalendes and feries my heart
hatethe / yower fastes are all in vain: I am weary of these things / and it
yrketh me to se them. when ye shall stretch forth your hands I will hyde mine
eyes from you: And pray ye never so miche yet shall I not hear you: for your
hands are bathed in blood: wasshe ye and be clean / put a way your yuel
thoughts and crooked counsels out of my sight: cease to do hurt and study
for equity: seek justice / deliver the oppressed / avenge y^ poor fatherless
and defend is cause of the wedowe. Come hither (I pray ye) and let me be
proved (says the Lord). when yower sins were as red as skarlet / were
they not made as white as snow? And when they were as red as purple / were
they not made as white as woll? If ye will hear and be ruled / shall ye not take
your pleasure even of the best fruits of the land? But if ye will be steffe
necked / think ye not to be devowerde with sword? Suerly God has so promised
with his own mouth. But how is it thus come to pass / that this cite which
sometime was faithful / full of equite in the which justice was excercysed /
has thus changed her face like an harlet / and is now become a murderer of
her own innocent citesens? Thy silver is turned into dross / Thy wine is
marred with water / Thy rulers arbetrayers and bakslyders from God / even
fellows unto theves. All they love gifts / and are sentence sellers: they
restore not his right to the fatherless and the wedewes cause comethe never
at the^. Wherefore / thus says the lord god of powers and the mighty forth
leader of Israel. Ahlasse / I must neades ease my mind and be avenged upon my
aduersares. I shall suerly set my hand upon the: and I shall sees out thy
dross and try out thy pureste / and I shall take away all thy lead. Aftyr
this shall I restore the thy iuges and senators as they were before. And then
shalt thou be called the cite of rightwysnes and the faithful town. Thus shall
Zio^ now redeemed from captivity / be accustomed with equite and excercised in
rightwisnes: when the ungodly transgressors and bakslyders from the Lord
shall be alto broken and utterly peresshe And except ye be ashamed of your
stocks and Idols in wodes and hills in which ye delighted / and leve your
groves and gardens which ye chose for you: ye shall be like oaks whose leaves
fall a way / and like a garden with out water. For the glysteringe glory of
these images shall be turned into stubble and the makers of them into sparks of
fire: and both of them shall be burnt together / noman quenchinge them.

The second Chapit. the title prefixed
THe word which was showed unto Isaye ye son of Amoz / upon Judah and
Jerusalem. Thus shall it be in the last days. The hill of the house of the
Lord shall be so prepared and setvp / that it shall apere above all the tops of
wother hills: And then shall there flow unto it all Gentyls / and infinite
folk shall goforth saying one to a another: come and let us ascend unto the
hill of the lord / to the house of the god of Jacob / that he might teach us
his ways / and that we moughte walk in his paths: For out of Zion the law
shall goforth and the word of the lord from Jerusalem / that he might be a
judge emonge the Gentyls / and rule therewith that infinite multitude. And then a
none shall they cause their swerdes to be smyten into matoks and coultres / and
their spears into sythes and sykels: For the one nation shall no more lift up
swtrde agenste the other / nether shall they enymore excercyse them self into
battle. And now speak I unto the (o house of Jacob). Come near (I pray
you) that we moughte walk together in the light of the Lord. But wherefore do
I bid the (o thou unhappy house of Jacob) saying yt thou with thy people ar
now fledbacke from ye Lord: for ye are far worse then yower elders both in
soth sai^gs aftyr ye manner of ye palestyns / and in calkynge of men's birthes
ye pass eve^ ye very haithe^: for as soon as your land abounded in goolde and
silver / and ye knew non end of your tresure / as soon as it was replenesshed
with horsemen and chariets: a none was it full of Idols and images / eve^ ye
works of your own hands which ye made with your own fingers: ye / and ye
worshipte the^: But doiste thou (o man) faldowne before these Idols and
worshipest the^? ye / and yt so supersticiously / so steffly / yt no thing may
pluck ye from them? Get the hence quikly / go hyde the in the rocks of
stone / run into the chynnes of the earth from the sight of the fearful judge
and from the brightness of his majesty: which casttehdowne the high lokes of
the proud men and layethe the stowte full low / which shall be alone above al
exalted so mightily in the day of ve^geau^ce taki^ge. For that day of the
lord of powers shall take vengeance upon al pride and stowtenes / upon al
elacion and oppression: It shall reach unto the high Ceders of Libani and unto
the steffe oaks of Basan / it shall mete with all the high mountayns and hills
/ and shall come by all the high towers / and unto every wall of defense / it
shall stretche unto all the ships of the sea and unto what so eueris goodly
and plesaunte to be hold: and shall thrustedowne the proud countenance of man
/ and shall lay full low his high lokes. For the lord alone shall have the
victory in that day.

And the Idols shall be utterly destroyed. Men shall krepe into de^nes of stone
and into the chynnes of the earth from the face of the fearfuliuge / and from
the brightness of his majesty / when he shall prepare him to come and sinyte the
earth. Then then shall man castawaye his goolden gods and images of silver
which he had made him to worshipe the^: then shall he cast the^ to molles and
backs that he might the more spedely run into these kaues of stone to hyde
him self in the rocks from the face of the fearfuliuge / and from the
glory of his majesty: when he shall prepare him self to come and smite the
earth.

Cap. iij
YE can well beware and avoyde an haastye malencoly man: which does all
thing in a gareshe furye Se then ye take here good head: for it is ye lord
god of powrs that is now angrye / and will take a way from Jerusalem and Judah
all substance and strength / almaner of sustenaunce both of meat and dri^ke /
capytayne and soldier / judge and Prophet / the sage wise and senator / pety
capytaynes and men in authorite / lawyers and learned / masters of works and
orators. And I shall set babes (says ye lord) to be your princes / and wylye
effeminate skorners shall be your rulers. And the people shall do wrong and
violence one to a nothr / even neighbor agenste neighbor: the boy shall
countroff the sage / and the knave the noble.

Every man shall set hold on his brother which is of his fathers famylye saying
thou haste a good cote thou shalt be ower capytayne / for thou maiste abide
this hevye bronte: then shall he a non swear and say: I cannot remedy it /
for in my nowne house is there nether meat nor money: make not me then ye head
of the people: for Jerusalem shall fall and Judah shall go to wrake / for both
their speech / study / and thoughts / all are agenste the lord to provoke
the countenance of his majesty to anger. The hevye changing of their chere
bewrieth and betrayeth them: ye they declare their own sin like the
Sodomytes / nethr can they cloak it. woe be to their lyves / for grevouse
punyshme^t shall be their reward: by which punishment they now thus taught at
the last / shall say Blessed ar the rightwyse for they shall eat the fruits
of their study. But contrariwise: woe be to the ungodly and wykedman which
shall be rewarded accordi^ge to the works of his own hands.

O my people / full gredye tyrauntes and craftye brybers are thy rulers and
weak women have the in subjection. O my people / thy leaders are deceyvers and
lead the out of ye way / they trede out the steapes of thy fete. The lord
is comeforth to reason the matter / he is redye to be judge for the people: for
the lord shall come to try it by judgment with the elders and rulers of his
people saying: ye have brentevp my vine yard: the spoil of the poor is in
your house: wherefore sta^pe ye thus down my people togithr / and grynde ye
thus togithr ye faces of the poor? Even thus shall the god of powrs reprove
these me^ / saying: because the proud daughters of Zion go with so forth
stretched necks / with so false wynkinge eyes / and with so wanten and light
behavior: therefore shall the lord clippe the crowns of the daughters of Zion
/ and so make bare their beutye in that day: and the lord shall take from them
the beuteful glory of their aparel their chains and stomachers / their
partelettes / their armelets and burlettes their costelye broydred clothes both
gown and kyrtel / pomaunders / musk balls and earinges / ringes and
fro^tellettes set with goolde and perle / their cha^ges with their frockes /
their kerchews and pinnes their glasses and lawndes / fillettes and hearbendes:
And for their sweet savours they shall have stynke / for their costiouse girdles
they shall go loose / for their hear broyderd with goolde they shall be balde /
and for their soft stomachers they shall were sack and hayer: and fore their
fayernes they shall be son bre^te. yower housbondes / even the most strongest
of the^ shall be smyten down with sword in battle. Their gates shall express
their moorninge and hevynes / and these kareful women shall sit upon the grownde
desolate / and then shall seven we men set hold upon one man saying: what so
ever meat and substance we have / we bring it here all together to the in
commune / so that thou will let us be thy wyves called aftyr thy name to take a
way our obprobry and calamite.

The fowerth Chapter.
AFter this shall there arise that Joyful floureshi^g budde of the Lord: and
this noble and goodly fruit of the earth shall spring unto those Israelites
which shall escape and be saved: and the reamnaunte that shall be left salfe in
Zion and Jerusalem shall be called saints / even all those in Jerusalem which
are written emo^ge the lyuinge men. And then when the lord has washed away
the filthenes of the daughters of Zion / and with the blaste of his hot
vengeance has pourged Jerusalem from blood: the lord shall create a cloud
and smoke be day / and be night the brightness of flaming fire over every
buyldinge of the hill of Zio^ and over every congregation rowndaboute it / for
it shall be defended with all his gloriouse mighty power: that it should be in
time to come a tabernacle and a shadewinge place be day from heat / and also
a refugye and shelter to hyde us from te^pestes and rain.

The fyfte Chapter.
ANd now therefore will I singe unto my well-beloved friend a song upon his vine
yard. My well-beloved made him a vine yard in a plesaunte and a plentuouse
soil: which he closed rownde a boute with a stone wall / and he planted it
with the most nobleste vine: In the mids of it he set up a tower and made
there in a wynepresse: lokinge that it should make grapes / and it yilded
thorns. wherefore now O ye citesens of Jerusalem and al y^ ar of ye fond of
Judah / I report me unto you / decerne you between me and my vine yard /
what thing more could I have done to my vine yard which I did not to it? And
wherefore then (I lokinge yt it should have yilded me grapes) has it brought me
forth thorns? Suerly I shall show you therefore what I will do to my vine yard.
I shall go break up her fense yt she may be robbed and destroyed: I shall through
down her wall yt she may be trodden down with mennis fete: I shall leve her
desolate al a lone / noman to cut her / nor yet to dig her: She shall be
overgrowne with briars and thorns: and I shall forbid y^ clouds to geve her
any rain. But yet ye vine yard of ye lord of hosts is the house of Israel /
and ye me^ of Judah ar his goodly ple^tuous plants which (when he looked for
judgment) lo al wasful of iniquite: when he looked for equite: lo al was iniurye
and co^playntes. woe be to you yt join house to house and lay field to field
until there be no more rome left for you as thoghe ye would have ye world
all a lone. But ye lord of powrs roundeth me i^ mine ear saying: If these
great and fayer houses be not left a lone noma^ dwelling in them? ye / a vine
yard of.v. akres shall yilde but a fyrkyn of wine: and of.zo. bushells of sede
ska^t shall arise three. woe be to the haunters of dronkenes which rise erly to
drink / co^tinuinge in it till night being hot with wine: in whose bankets
there are harpes and futes taberet and pype washed with wine. but in the mean
time / the very work of the lord they behold not / nether consider they what
his hands have made. Be cause therefore that my people has no knowledge / they
ar sone brought into captivity / their nobles are made thynne with honger / and
the proud multitude peresheth for thirste: And for this cause the helles have
opened their insatiable throtes and their mouths gape be yende mesure / that
thither might descend pride / pomp / riches / and all that are addicte to
these vices. Thus is man plucked down / the stowte stoupeth / and high lokes
are abated: but the Lord of powers and the holy god is exalted and stableshed
into a gloriouse exe^ple of equite and rightwisnes / that the poor la^bes
might be fed of the thing appointed thez / and the stourdy strayi^ge rams
might go graze upon the baren deserte. Woe be unto these vain skorners which
draw unto them self wykednes (as ye would say) with a line: and pluk sin
also to them even with carte ropes: in whose mouths are al ways the se
sayings / let him work on fast / that we might once se it / let the mind of
Isreal's holy maker come to pass and be once present that we might once know
it. Woe be unto them that say that thing to be evel which they know to be good
/ and that to be good which they know to be evel: which reken derknes to be
light / and the light to be derknes / and that at is bitter / they say is
sweet / and sweet to be bitter. Woe be to thez that at wise in their own eyes /
and have understanding in their own judgment. Woe be unto these great
drinkers of wine / and to men hardye to receive dronkenes: which absolve ye
wiked for gifts and condemn the just for his rightwisnes: wherefore like as
ye tongue of the fire licketh in the stubble / and as the flame consumethe the
straw: even so / their rote putrifyed / the flowr of them shall vaynesshe a
way like duste which contempne the law of the lord of powers / and despise
the word of him that makes holy Israel: wherefore ye wrath of the lord is
kyndled agenste his people / and he has turned his hand to smite them / that
these hills might tremble / and their karcases might lie stinkinge like
dongehills in the high ways. And yet after all this shall he nothing abate his
wrath / but shall yet farther stretche forth his hand / and shall geve a token
to the strange nation a farreof / whistelinge the^ from the fartheste parts
of the earth: and lo / they shall come a none / and that swyftlye: There is not
one wearye or faynte emonge them / not one of them drowsye or sleapye / their
girdles a boute their raynes they do not once slak / nor yet unloose the
latchets of their shoes / their arows are sharp and their bows redye bente /
their horse howves shode as sharp as flyntes / and the wheles of their
charyets turninge like a whirlewinde. This nation roreth like a lion / and
grenneth like the lions whelps / they shall grenne and snatche up their proye /
nether shall there be one that may escape / nor yet any that may deliver them
They shall grenne upon the people of Israel at yt time like a fyerce sea. Then
if we behold the earth / lo / all shall be derkenes / and no refugye. If we
behold the stars: lo / they shall be derkened into ower hevynes with out hope.

Chapter vi
THe year in the which Dzias the king dyed: I see the Lord sittinge in an
high seat all above / and the train of his robe filled y^ temple. And the
Seraphims apered above over him / and each of them had siye wings: with two of
their wi^ges they kouerde their faces / and with two they kouerde their fete /
and with the the other two they flewe / and they kryed to each other saying:
Holy / holy / holy is ye lord of powers: all the earth be fulfilled with his
gloriouse majesty: ye and the posts with their windows were moved at the
voice of these angels kryinge and ye same house was full of smoke: then said I
/ Ah less / for I was a stonned in asmych as I me self being a man having
polluted lips / and conuersaunte with people having also polluted lips /
yet not withstandinge / had seen with my eyes a king / even the lord of
powers. Then one of the Seraphims flwe unto me bringinge a quick cole taken
srome the alter with a payer of tongues: and he touched my lips saying these
words: behold / as soon as this cole has touched thy lips thy in iquitie
is gone / and thy sin is purged. Farthermore I hard the voice of the lord
taking aduysmente on this manner: whom shall I send? Or who shall go on ower
message? And then answerde I: lo / here at your pleasure to send me And he
said: Go thy ways and say unto this people / ye shall hear verily / and yet
shall ye not understand / and ye shall see plainly / but yet shall ye not know:
Make gross and fat the hearts of this people / make thick their ears / and
kover their eyes / lest they see with their eyes / or hear with their ears /
or understand with their hearts and so be converted and saved. And here I
begane to speak for them saying: how long my lord? until the cytes (said
he) be destitute their dwellers / and not a man left in the houses / and the
grownde be laid void: For full far shall the lord baneshe the men / and
there shall be great destruction in the land: but yet shall there be left a
tithe in it to return a gene / so that their pasture shall be restored: and as
their oaks and line trees cast of their fruits / even so shall that holy seade
shoteforth frutefully emonge them.

The seventh Chapter.
THen was it so / that in the reign of Ahaz ye son of Iotham the son of
Ozias king of Judah: Rezin the king of Aram and Phecca the son of Romelie
king of Israel ascended to Jerusalem to lay sege agenste it: which at that
time they might not win: and then told they the house of David that the
Syryons were confederde with Ephraim / which tidings made Ahaz with the house
of David to tremble like trees in the wode smyten with wind. wherefore the lord
said unto Isaye. Have done and get the forth with thy son Iasus which is
left the / and mete Ahazat ye head of the over pole in the way towerde the
suffers field / and say unto him. Se yt thou be still and fear not / let not
thy heart melte at these two tails with their smokynge fyerbrandes / that is
to say at the furye of Rezin king of the Syrions / and of the son of
Romelye because the Syrions / Ephraim / and Romelis son have thus
myscheuously counselde and conspyred agenste the / saying. We will go up into
Judah and scourge them and translate them unto us / and we shall set the son
of Tabal to be king over them: For even thus says the lord: This thing
shall not rise nor come to pass: but Damascus shall be y^ head of Syria / and
Rezin shall be ye head of Damascus: and aftyr.65. years / Ephrai^ karyed away
shall no more be ye people: although now Samarya be head of Ephraim / and ye
son of Romelye ye head of Samaria: If ye beleve not / you are but gone to.
And besydis this / the Lord commanded him to say thus also unto Ahaz. Ask
the some token of ye Lord thy God / whether it be from ye deapest benethe or
from the highest above. And Ahaz answerde: I will not ask / nether will I
tempte the Lord. Wherefore he said. Hear then ye house of David / is it not
enough for you to veye men / but ye must wearye my god to? The lord therefore
his own self shall geve you a toke^. Behold / a maid shall be with child and
bringeforth a son and she shall call his name Immanuel. Boter and honey shall
he eat until he can eschew yuel and chose good: notwithstanding before this
child be thus waxen / thy land shall be desolated / for y^ which thou art so a
frayde of their two kings. ye the lord shall bring both upon the / and upon
thy people / and upon thy fathers house / siche days as have not ben seen
from the departinge of Ephraym from Judah: that is to say / he shall bring
upon you the king of the Assyrions: For the time shall come that the lord
shall whystle for a fly which dwells beyende the flowde of Egypt and for
bees which are in the land of the Assyrions / which shall come all hole together
and besege the even with in thy dry dykes at the kaves with in the rocks / in
every wode / and at every stertinge hole. ye in that time / the Lord shall
shave the with a raser / he shall hyer a raser beyende the flowde Euphrates /
even the king of the Assyryons: and he shall shave of the hears of thy head
and fete / and even thy very berde shall he wype of: then shall the time come
that a man shall live with a kowe and tway e^es / and for the plentye of milk
eat boter: for yet shall every on left in the mids of the land eat boter
and honey / and yet in those days a vine yard of a thousand vynes bought for
more then a thousand penys shall be turned into briars and thorns: For the
king of the Assyrions shall not come hither armed so thick with bow and
arows as the briars and thorns shall stand over all this region: Also every
fruitful hill which was wont to be delved and ploughed / then shall not a man
come to them for fear of thorns and briars / but shall serve to put in heardes
/ and beasts to graze in.

The aight Chapter.
ANd then said the Lord agene to me: take the a great roll and write in it
with a pen like a man Maherschalal haschbaz which is to say / haste the to
rob / speed the to spoil. Then I took me certain faithful witneses / vry
the priest and Zachary the son of Barachy: and came unto a prophetise which
had now conceived and brought forth a son: and the Lord spoke unto me. Geve
him this name: hastye robber gredy spoyler: for before this child can call
Dadye and Ma^mye he shall bare away the riches of Damasce and the proye of
Samarye / in y^ sight of the king of Assyrye. And agene the Lord spoke unto
me these words. For asmych as this people abhors the waters of Siloah that
flow so still / and has rather pleasure in this king Rezin and in the son
of Romely: Lo / the lord therefore shall let the great mighty flowdis break in
upon them / that is to say the king of the Assyrions with all his power:
which shall arise every where a bove their ryuers and run over all their banks
dryuynge into Judah / redowndyng and swellyngevp even to their throtes: And the
time shall come that the spreadinge a broad of their wings shall kover the
breadeth of thy land / O Immanuel. Get ye together / ye people into counsel /
and all ye of the fartheste parts of the land cast yower heads together /
haste ye together to take counsel: and yet shall all together be in vain.
Conclude ye upon any thing / and yet shall it not come to pass / except
Immanuel. Thus then said the Lord unto me taking me by the hand like a guide
and nourteringe me that I should not go in the way of this people saying.
Break not yower minds about any confederation with other for any help: for
although this people speaks of nothing but of coniurations and
confederations: yet let them not fraye you: but sanctify you the Lord of
powers: hi^ fear / him dread ye: for it is he that is y^ very holymakynge and
the stomblynge stone also: even a rock to fall at / snare and net to either of
y^ houses / that is to say to Israel / and to them that dwell about
Jerusalem: and many shall stomble at him / they shall fall / they shall be broken
/ they shall be trapt and taken. Now (says the Lord) rollvp this testemony /
and sealevp the law with my disciples. Now shall I look for the lord (faith
Isaye) which has hyd his face from the house of Jacob / and I shall trust in
him / both I me self and ye servants whom the Lord has geven me to be a
miracle and woundre in Israel for the lord of powers pleasure that dwells in
the mount Zion. And when men shall say to you (O my childerne and disciples
of the lord) ask counsel of the Pythonyts and soth sayers of sorcerers and
charmers: then answer you saying: do not every nation ask counsel and
knowledge of their own gods? shall they then ask of y^ deed to know things
concerning the lyuinge? get ye to the law and to gods testymones: for who
so ever speaks not aftyr these words they are not of y^ morninge light. If a
man be negligent and despise the law / he smyteth himself agenste a rok and
fails of his porpose / and when he thus failethe of his porpose / he shall be
angry and so fret himself that he shall curse his king and his god. And when
he shall look either upward or downwarde to the grownde: lo / all are full of
anguyshe derknes and tribulacion floteringe about him with the clouds of
error which shall not be taken from him that is thus grevously tangled in
anguisshe. (as it have been seen of late in the land of Zabulon and in the
land of Neptalim)

Chapter ix
First ye land was rid of Zabulon and Neptalim: 4. Re. 15
but at last it shall be right grievously scourged: The land of Zabulon and
Neptalim lay by the way from over Jordan to the sea / through Galile whereupon
then bordred the gentyls / the folk that walked in derkenes / which shall see a
great light / and over them dwelling in the region of ye dedly shadewe light
shall spring: thou shall multiplye the ge^tyls / and shall thou not therewith
also magnifye gladness? they shall be glad with y^ as men rejoice in their
reapi^ge and as me^ having victory / rejoice in deuyding of their proie. For
y^ hevye yoke of ye gentyls / and the burden of their shulders / and the power
of their tyrauntes / thou shalt break eue^ as thou once delyuerdst thy people
from the tyranye of the Madianites: Iud. vij
ye / and al vyolente roberye / al hastye insurreccion / and al cruel blood
shed shall fead the fire: For a child shall be borne for us / and a son shall be
given us / upon whese shulders / Impery and the governance shall be put / and
he shall be called the marvelous counseler / the mighty God / the father
everlastinge / the prince of peace: this king shall never have end in
encresinge his Impery and yet shall he therewith nouryshe peace / sittinge in the
seat regal of David / and in his kingdom / to maintain it in equity and
rightwysnes from thence into everlasting: the zele of y^ lord of powers shall
bring this to pass. The lord sent a word into Jacob and it fell into
Israel: which all the people shall know / even Ephraim and the citesens of
Samarye although yet of a proud heart they say thus: Ower buldi^ges of
brycke are smytte^ down / but we shall build the^ agene with four sqwared
stones: ower houses of wild figtres ar broken down / but we shall restore the^
builded with Cedre trees: wherefore y^ lord shall stere up Resin with other
enemes upon thez: whom he shall so dispose and order that Syrus shall come in
upon y^ front of Israel / and the palestines shall come in on their backs and
devower them with open mouth: and yet for all this shall he not swage his wrath
/ but shall yet stretche forth his hand: for nether the people returns unto
him that plaged them / nor yet seek they the lord of powers. wherefore y^ lord
shall kutof from Israel both top and tail branch and band al at once / by
the top understand thou the alderma^ and him yt bearethe rule / by y^ tail
understand thou the prophet that preachethe lies For they which preach this
people to be happy or blessed / are deceyuers / and they that are thought
happy emonge them are the most nyghest their destruction. Wherefore the Lord
delights not in their yongons and is unmerciful unto the fatherles and to
their wedews / for they ar al hypocryts and kursed and they al speak
folishnes: and yet for all this shall he not swage his wrath but stretche still
forth his hand: For their ungodliness burns like fire which is noureshed with
brambles and thorns / and the smoke of their pride fleethforth like ye smoke
of fire that is fallen emonge thycke briars: wherefore the land shall be burnt
in the wrath of the lord of powers / and the people shall feed the fire: for
noman shall spare a another. And if any man turn him on his righthande / he shall
sterve for honger / and if he turn him on his left hand to eats yet shall he
find no fode / every man shall eat the brawne of his own arms. Manasse shall
eat Ephraim and Ephraim Manasse / and then shall these togithr also eat Judah.
And yet for all this shall he not swage his wrath but stretch still forth his
hand.

Chapi. x.
WOE be to you that make ungodly laws / and set statutes to hard to keep / to
oppress the poor in judgment and utterly to beger my afflicte simple people
with strife and law / that the wedewe might be a proye for you / and to rob
the fatherless.

What then shall ye do in the day of visitation and destruction cominge from a
far? to whom then shall ye flee for help? Or where shall ye leave yower
glory for a pledge that ye be not cast into fetters or fall into emonge the
si^ayne? And yet for all this shall he not swage his wrath but stretche still
forth his hand. Woe be to Assure also the weapen of my wrath which holdethe
the rod of my indignacion in his hand: for I must send him emonge
hypocrytes / and to people that has deserved my Indignacion shall I send him
to rob and to spoil thez of all that they have / and to stamp them under his
fete like the dyrte in the streates: not with standinge / yet he himself shall
not so consider y^ thing / nether thus think it in his heart: but hitherto
looks his heart his lust is to destroy and to wype away with his sword not
a few folk / for thus thinks he saying with himself: Are not al other
kings and princes trybutares unto me? shall not I subdwe to me Calenum as
easelye as Charchamim? and as sone take Antioch as I have Arphad? and Damase as
Samariam? (as who say) I have gotten by my nowne power these kingdoms in y^
which Idols and karued images ar worshipped / and can I not then get Jerusalem
and Samarye? shall not I be as able to do to Jerusalem and to her Images as I
have done to Samarye and to her gods? Then the time shall come (says ye
lord) when I have fyneshed al my work in the mount of Zion and Jerusalem /
yt I must vyset and look upon this Ioylye bird and so fortunate a fellow even
upon the stout heart of the king of the Assyrions and upon his high look:
for thus he thinks of him self: by my nowne power and wisdom do I these
things: for I am wise: It is I that have taken away ye coostes of ye nations
and have spoiled their princes: and I like a gyaunte have plucked down men
sittinge a lofte: and the hosts of ye innumerable people with their substance
are al brought into my hands as eggs into a neste: for I have gatherd to me
every region of the earth even as scatred eggs are gatherd together into one
place / and there is not one in the mean time that dare move his winge / yt
dare open his mouth or once chatter agenste me. But (I pray you) does y^
axe glory agenste him that uses it to cut therewith? Or does ye saw
magnyfye it self agenste the drawer there of? this were as like as though the
rod should lyftvp her self agenste her bearer and the staff exalte it self
agenste the smyter as though it were no tree: Wherefore the Lord God of powers
shall send penurye into his plentuousnes / and fire shall krepe in under his
power and waste it: and the light of Israel shall be his fire / and Isreal's
sanctuarye shall be his flame / which shall kyndel and devower his briars and
thorns all one a day. Also the beutye of his wodes and hills shall be utterly
consumed / and in conclusion he himself shall be like a chased vagabonde / and
the reaste of his trees left in his wodes shall stand so thynne that a child
may tell and write them. And then the reamnaunte of Israel and they that shall be
saved pertayninge to the house of Jacob shall no more cleave to him as their
smyter: but by faith they shall trust to the Lord that makes holy Israel:
there shall but a few (I say) return / eve^ but the reamnaunte of Jacob (I
tell you) shall be turned to the mighty god / For although (O Israel) thy
people be like the sands of the sea / yet but a few of them shall be turned to
him: For y^ sentence of him that is rich in ryghtwysmakinge must neades
stand / wherefore dowtlesse the lord god of powers shall do this assuerde
thing even in the mids of all the world: For thus speaks the Lord god of
powers: be not a frayde of Assure (my people which dwell in Zion) for with a
rod verily shall he smite the and shall lyftvp his weapen agenste the like as
sometime did the Egiptions / but aftyr a little space / ye in less then a little
space the mesure of my indignacion and wrath for their sins shall be fulfilled
/ says the Lord: for then the Lord of powers shall sterevppe a scourge
agenste them as he did once agenste the Madianytes at the rock of Oreb / and
as he lyftedvp his rod upon the sea / and shall smite the^ as he smyt the
Egypcions. Then shall his burden be taken from thy shulders / and his yoke from
thy neck / and his yoke shall rotte for fat. But this Assure verily shall come
in first unto Aiath / and from thense shall he conne into Migron In Machmas
shall he nowmber his host / there shall he go over the foorde and so turn to
Gabaam / then shall Rama be a frayde / and Gabaa which is called Saules Gabaa
shall flee. The neaynge of their horses shall sownde over al y^ dawghter of
Gallim which shall be hard unto Lais and to low Anathot. but whiles Madmena be
a frayde se that ye citesens of Gebim pluckevp your hearts / for this one day
shall he yet taryein Noba / and from thence shall he turn his host towerd the
mount / y^ daughter of Zion and to the hyl of Jerusalem. But yet behold /
for the Lord god of powers shall cut of this gloriouse renown with great
fear / he shall cut down the talle men and they that are a lofte shall come
full low / the thorney places of the wodes shall he smite down with axes / and
the great high Ceder trees shall have a fall.

Theleuenth Chapter.
But at last shall the Gryffe comeforth of the stock of Iesse and the floury
shinge budde shall spring forth of his rote / which shall be endued with the
spirit of the Lord / even with the spirit of wisdom / and of understanding
/ with the spyrit of counsel and strength / the spyrit of knowledge and fear
of the Lord / and shall make him accept or of sweet savoure in y^ fear of
the Lord / for he shall not Judge aftyr the face nor reprove aftyr the fame
brought unto his ears: but shall avenge the poor with right wisnes / and reason
for the low oppressed of the earth with equity: The earth shall he smite with
the rod of his mouth / and with the very breath of his lips shall he
slaye the ungodly man: for rightwisnes shall be the gyrdele of his loins / and
trowthe and faithfulness shall gyrde about his sides / that the wolf might dwell
and acorde with the lombe / the leoparde lie down with the got / and likewise
the hey fore with the lion / and that every wild beast moughte agree with the
tame and become so meke that a little child might rule them / the kowe and the
female bear shall feed together in one heard and shall nourysh up their young
togithr in one place / the lion shall eat chafe with the ox / here ye young
babe shall play upon the Serpents den / and aftyr that it be weaned / it shall
put his hand into the neste of ye venoumse kockatrice. Noman shall hurt or
destroy other thorowt al my holy hill: for ye land shall swymme in ye
knowledge of the lordis worshipe as it were a sea flowinge over all: and then
shall it come to pass / that the gentiles shall seek this root of Iesse which
stands up for a sign emonge the folk: For his quiet habitacion shall be right
glouriouse. And then the Lord shall put to his hand agene to challenge and to
possess the reamnaunte of his people whom he reserved salfe from the
Assyrions / from the Egiptions / from the hard Arabens / from the yindes /
from the Elamytes / from the Chaldes from the Antiochens / and from the
eylands of the sea / then shall he geve a sign to the Gentyls and shall gather
to gither the scaterde men of Israel / and bring together also the dispersed
of Judah from the four quarters of the earth / Ephraim shall be eased of her
hateful aduersares / and the enymes of Judah shall be clean wyped a way: Nether
shall Ephraim envy or hate Judah / nor Judah shall invade Ephraim / but their
shall flee both together upon the shulders of the Palestynes towerde the weste
/ returninge both together to rob the chylderne of the East: the Idumes and
ye Moabites shall be at their beck / and the sons of Ammon shall obaye them /
and the Lord shall stop the tongue of the sea of Egipte and shall shake his
hand over this flovde with a vehement wind smytinge her seven mouths so that
men may go over her dry shod / and the way shallye wide open for the
reamnaunte of his people which were saved from the Assyrions even as it lay
open for Israel when they came up from Egypt / so that then / every one of
them shall say thus.

Chap. xij.
I Thank the (Lord) for thou wast wrath with me / but thy countenance now
changed / thou art merciful and counfortest me. Lo / God is my savioure / I
shall trust in him / and shall not fear. For the Lord god is my strength and
praise. It is he that will be my refuge. ye shall draw waters with great joy
owte of the wells of owr saviowr / and shall say in those days. Let us geve
thanks to the Lord / let us spread his name / Let us publeshe his plesures
to the people / and let us never forget that right high is his name exalted.
Let us sing unto the lord for he has done high things that they should be
known through all the earth. Lawghe and be glad from thy very heart / thou
that dwelleste in Zion for right great is thy prince which makes holy Israel.

Chap. xiij.
THe heavy destruction of Babylon which Isaye the son of Amoz saw before.
Lyftevp a token to the hill a bove krye to them / beken yowr hands to thez /
that the princes might co^vaye theirselues into withyn the gates. For I (says
the Lord) shall command my appointed messagers and call my mightyons that
delight in my majesty to fyneshe my wrath. And methought then that Iharde a
noise from the mountains like the noise of miche people swellinge and
clusteringe together eve^ a noise of men musteringe / as though the realms of
the ge^tyles had be^ gatherde altogether having the lord of powers for their
capytain / and as though they had come from far regions even from the
extreme parts of the world / ye as though both the Lord himself / his
ministers and vessels of his indignacio^ should have come to destroy y^ wholl
world. Howl ye therefore / for full nyghe is the day of the lord which shall
come upon us like a destroyer from the most myghtyeste: then shall every
man's hand have the palsaye / and their hearts shall faynte / they shall be
astonned / holden with anguyshe and dazynges in their heads they shall have
panges lyk women trauelinge of child / every man shall be a frayde of other and
their chekes shall glowe for shame / for behold / ye day of the lord shall be
present full of fyarcenes / Indignacion / wrath / anger / until their land be
brought into a wyldernes / and sin be castoute of it / for the stars and
the planets of heaven shalnot geve their light. The son shall be quenched in
his vprysing / and ye moan shall with draw her light. I shall (says ye lord)
look upon the malice of the world and shall punyshe the sins of the ungodly.
I shall abate the pride of the proud / and the wanten lusts of tyrants shall I
bring down. I shall make that a man shall be then more preciouse then ye
pureste gold. ye and that but a vile man shall be betr then a wedge of gold of
Ophyr. Wherefore I shall so sinyte heven that the earth shall shake from her
place. these plages (I say) shall fall upon Babylon at the Indignacion of the
lord of powers / and that in the day of his fyarce wrath: then shall a man be
as fearful as a chased do and as a flock of sheep whom noman can bring to
gither: one countreman shall flee to a another for help and every man to his
own land / and he that shall be fownde alone shall be steked: and he that abides
in the raye shall be smyt down. their chylderne shall be throne agenste ye grownde
before their faces / their houses shall be robbed and their wives defiled. For lo
/ I shall stere up the Medes upon them which shall set nothing by silver and but
a little by gold of whom ye bows of the young men shall be broken / they shall
have little petye of women with child and less shame to kill their chylderne.
And Babylon the head of al kingdoms / the beuteful flower of the Chaldes
shall be destroyde even as the lord destroyde Sodom and Gomor: it shall never be
inhabited nether any man shall dwell in it from age to age. The Arabes shall
no more pitche bothes there / nether the herdemen shall thithr bring their
flock / but wild beasts shall lie there / and their houses shall be full of
owls there shall inhabit Struthions / there shall scyppe these wodouses / there
shall krye these night ravens one agenste a another in the houses of Babylon /
and dragons shall there play in the palaces.

Chapter.xiiij.
ANd the time of his cominge is now at hand / his day shall not be long
differred. But yet agene the lord will be mercyful to Jacob / and shall yet chose
Israel / and bring them agene unto their own land: and strangers shall be
cowpled with them and Joined to the house of Jacob They shall take this strange
nation and lead them to their places / and the house of Israel shall hold
them for servants and handemaydes in the lords land and hold them in
captivity / under whose gyrdel they their self where before / and shall
command thez which before were their masters. And then when ye lord shall
geve the rest from thy labors and tremblinge and from thy grevouse
seruitute by which thou were thus holden under: thou shalt take up this
lamentable song agenste ye king of Babylon sayng / how is this extorsener
brought to rest with his golden tayes and trybutes? The lord verily has
broke the staff of the ungodly even the septre of these lordely rulers: which
when he is angry smyteth the people with a plage incurable / when he is chafed
/ he tameth these Gentyles and persu^th them still: so that now al ower land
is at rest and sings for Joy / ye the very fyrtrees and the Cedres of
Libani rejoice upon thy fall / sainge. Aftyr that thou were laid a sleep
noman clymed up to kut us down: hell trembled at thy cominge: Gyauntes and al
princes of the earth came forth to mete the / all kings of the gentyles rose
up from their trones / all these in course magnifyed the saying: Art thou
not wounded as well as we and made like us? but thy pride was plucked down to
hell with thy vain folyshnes. Mottes shall be strewed under the and worms
shall be thy koverled. How fell ye from heaven (lucifer) ye fayer son of the
morninge? ar ye now fallen so wretchedly to the earth which were wont to be
Emperowr over the gentyles? ye and that even when thou thus thoughtest in thy
heart. I shall ascend into heven and shall exalte my seat above the stars of
heven and sit in the congregation hill at the north side: I will ascend
higher then the clouds / and be equale with the most highest. But now art
thou plucked down to hell unto the most deapest plage of the earth: they
that se the come now nerer and dare tote ye in the face thinkinge thus upon the
/ Is not this the stout man that made the earth a frayde / that shoke the
kingdoms to githr / and made the world like a deserte? which betedowne cytes
and towns and would never let his captives come home.

How comes it to pass that whyls all other kings of al nations sleep
gloryously every one at his own house / thou art cast out of thy grave like
a plant out of kind? like the fleses of slain me^ dug through with
spears / ye like mean let down into dounge^s of stone / and like deed
karcases trodden under the fete. Therefore art thou not buried with them because
thou destroyedste thy nowne land / and sluest thy people. The posterite of
synful men therefore shall evermore be ignomyniouse / and men shall seek means
to make a way their chylderne for their fathers iniquite: lest they arise and
possess the kingdom / and fyl the land full of strong holds. I shall rise
upon them (says ye lord of powers) and kut of the name of Babylon / and all that there remain with the chylderne and their neves / says the lord: I shall
leve it for oters / and turn it into a fysshe pole / ye I shall swepe it with a
consuminge besome (says the lord of powers): ye / and besides all this ye
lord of powers bownde it with an oath thus to come to pass as he had thought
/ and to be as suer of this plage as he had decreed it. I shall break down ye
Assyrions (says he) in my land / and trede them down in my mountayns: the
yoke of Assure shall be taken from you / and yower shulders shall be delyuerde of
his burden / so stands it with the counsels which the lord has decreed upon
all ye land / and thus is his power stretchedforth unto all gentyles: for the
lord of powers decreynge any thing / who shall make it void? When he has
streched forth his hand / who may bend it back? In the year that king
Ahaz dyed God thretened one this manner by Isaye. Rejoice not al at once thou
Palestyne / as thoghe ye staff of him that smyt the were al to broken: for
out of the rote of the edder shall rise a koketrice / and out of him shall
spring a fleinge fire drake / and the poor shall eat of the best and nedyons
shall dwell in savegarde: But thy rote shall I quench out with honger / and he
shall slaye thy reamnauntes. yell out ye gates: krye ye cytes / and thou
palestyne be trowbled all over for there comes a smoke from the nor the /
whose thycknes and bitter violence noman may abide: and then what other
answer shall the tydinge bears of the folk make / but that the Lord has set
fast Zion / and his poor people shall cleve unto her.

The heuye vision that the Lord showed to Isaye upon Moab. I have seen that Are
Moab should be destroyed and laid full low / and that in the night / and in
the night also the walls of Moab should be throne down. These Moabites
ascended unto their high places called Baithe and Dibon where they worshipped
Idols / to weep before them. This lamentable howlinge of Moab was hard over
Na^o and Medeba / every man polled his head and shoue his berde. They stood
gyrte in sack in every korner of the town. Upon their house tops / and in
y^ streets every man kryed out and fell to wepinge. Hesebon and Eleale kryed
so loud that their voices were hard to Iahaz / and the soudgiers of Moab when
they should have blown up their trompetes to battle / for sorrow of their
hearts they kryed ah less for sorrow / ower hearts blede upon Moab fleinge
towerd Zoar that welthye bullok / and upon the hanging of the hill of Luhith
they clymed with wepinge. Also the way of Horonaim they filled with their
lamentable noise. The waters of Nemrim were forsaken and the grass was wytherd
away. Corn failed / and there was no grene thing left. And even aftyr this
manner the rest of their substance and goods their aduersares karied a way
to Arabye prosperously by ship. And to be short / the noise went through all the coostes of Moab so that from Eglaim unto Beer Elim all was fylle dwith
their howlinge.

The waters of Dimon were full of blood / for there lay the host waiting
like lions / both for them yt should have escaped from the cite / and for them
that fled from the field.

Chap. xvi
Then ye lord of ye land sent a souldyer from the stoney deserte unto the
hill of the daughter of Zion (for the daughters of Moab abode yet at the foorde
of Arnon like tremblinge byrds put out of their nestes) which messagere
required them thus saying. Gather together yower senators and take counsel
how ye might shadewe and defend us in this hot persecution / hyde them that
flee / and destroy not ye dispersed / let ower Moabytes fled unto you be
soukerde / hyde us from the face of the destroyer / for ower enymes trede us
down: this destroyer ceasseth not to waste us a way from the earth: For the
seat of yower kingdom is full of mercy / wherefore he that sittethe in it
must judge of faithfulness and trowthe as in the tabernacle of David / he must
seek equite and haste him to maintain the right. Unto the which request it
was thus answerde. Moabs pride is well known and how great it is His
Arrogancye and swellinge furye was never so great but his strength is now as
small. Wherefore let Moab complain of his fall to him self / that he might
all alone lamente / and that he also thus broken with sorrow might sit
complayninge and moorninge in vain at the fete of che brycke walls of Arnon
now cast down. Also Isawe those suburbs of Hesebon destroyed: The
vyneyardes of Sibme planted with ye most nobleste vynes which reched unto
Iazer and spread unto the deserte / her branches spread unto ye weste sea the
pears of Gentyles did kut down. Wherefore I wept for Iazer and for the
vyneyardes of Sibme / I waterde the vyneyarde of Hesbonam and Elealen with the
tears of my eyes / because that in their harueste and in the gatheringe of
their grapes their wont merry songs were gone / their mirth was laid in bed
/ both of field and vine yard / so that they could nether be glade nor sing:
ye treder in ye vine press trede out no more wine / their harueste and grape
gatheringe songs were laid down. Wherefore my belie murmuerde lyk an harp
for Moab / and even my bowels also for that bryk wall. For when Moab see that
her goods were in perell she weared her self going to her Idols in high
places and to her holy houses to pray / but non might help her. This is ye
word which the lord spoke then upon Moab: but now the lord speaks on this
manner. Aftyr three years / the power of Moab with all her pomp and riches
(which are very much) shall be taken a way / eve^ as an hyerde seruante his
years out served is quyte gone / and her reamnauntes shall be full few and of
small valewe.

Chap. xvij.
THe heuye affliccion which ye lord showed to Isaye upon Damascum. Damascus
shall no more be a cite / but throne down into an heap of stones. The cites of
Aroer shall be turned into pasture and layers for flocks of sheep and other
heardes so that noman shall fraye them a way Ephraim shall no more be strong
defensed / Damascus shall be no more a kingdom. Also the glory of the left
cytes of Syrie shall be like the glory of the chylderne of Israel says the
lord of powers / then shall the glory of Jacob be full thynne / and the well
lykinge of their fat bodies shall be full lean. For they shall be like a
gatherer of corn yet sta^dinge after the sykle which reapeth down the
handfulles with his Arm / but when he gathers or thrusts them together
(even in the valye of Rephaim) yet he levethe some what for the gleaners: they
shall be like one beatingeof olyve beryes which yet leveth two or three beryes in
the top and not passinge four or fyve in all the other bouwes says ye
lord god of Israel. Then shall man return unto his maker and his eyes shall
look unto him that makes holy Israel: and shall not look unto Altars the
work of their hands nethr shall he behold those things which his own
fyngers made / nether words / nor images. Then shall the strong cytes be left
desolate as were the ploughes and harows sometime (of the chananites) for fear
of the chylderne of Israel. Because thou have forgoten god thy saviower and not
remembered thy strong rock / therefore have thou planted the so fayer settes
and sown the so strange seades When thou plantedste them / thou waste rich
and in thy flowers and beleuedste to have had fulerlye fruits of thy seade: But
when the time shall come to gather and to possess them / thou shall reap
right plentuouse affliccio^ and sorrow. Woe be to this confuse clustre and
monstrose multitude of so proud people swellinge like the sea which haithen
host ryseth up like a fearce water.

But let this heady folk / be they never so many / never so unruly and lawles
swell / yet as soon as the Lord blames them and set agenste them / they
shall flee full far a way / and shall be wynnowed of the wind like the duste
of ye dry mountain / and like a whirlewynde at the coming of a storm: For
lo / like as at the eveninge they were mervelouse terrible / so before the
morninge shall they begone. This is the very end of them that scourge us / this
is the reward of them that rob us of ower goods.

Chap. x viij.
WOE be to the land whose ships are so swyfte / which land lies one this
side of the flowde of Ethiopye / which sends ambassiatours by the sea and
that in ships of reeds and bulrushes put upon the waters saying: Go yower
ways ye messagers unto a ye pyssed and ragged nation / people more fearful
then owers and far unlike / a vile nation and litel set bye whose land the
floudes devyde. But o ye all that dwell upon the earth and inhabit the rownde
world / take heed and look when ye se the sign lyfted up to you in the
hills / and when ye hear the trompetes blown up to bataile: For thus said
the Lord to me. I lay down to rest considering with my self in my house
in the myddaye when it was full warm like as a genste a shower of rain as it
is wont to be in harvest ceason / but yet before the corn be redye to reap
and the clusters of grapes be perfitly ripe: and there was one which kutdowne
the clusters with a kutting knyfe / and he kut a way even the branches also /
and took them a way: the resydwe were left as well fore the fowls of the
mountayns as for the beasts of the field / that ye fowls might lie there all
the somer and the beasts of the feldes all winter. And then shall there be
offered the Lord of powers a gift of ye pild ragged nation and dreadful people
far above us / a vile nation / and trodden vndr foot. Whole lands ye flowdes
deuyde: unto the lord of powers (I say) these gentyles shall be offered at the
place consecrated unto his name / even at ye mount Zion.

Chap. xix.
THe heuye afflicion which ye lord showed to Isaye upon Egypt. Behold / the
lord shall come rydinge upon a swyfte cloud into Egypt: at whose cominge the
Idols of Egypt shall sheake / and the heart of Egypt shall faynte in her own
body. For I shall set the Egipcions (says the lord) one agenste a another so
that every man shall fight with other / even brother agenste brother / cite
agenste cite / kingdom agenste kingdom / and the breath of Egypt shall be
broken in her belie / and I shall scater her counsel when she shall go about to
ask it of her Idols / wytches / soth sayers and diuyners. I shall betake Egypt
into the hands of cruel lords / and a violente king shall rule the^ / says
the lord god of powers. The waters of the sea shall synke away / and Nilus
shall be dryedup / their flowdes shall be drunk up / and their dykes and brooks
shall be full shalowe and fail / reed and rushes shall be wytherdvp / the medewes
and all the feldes a boute Nilus which were wont to wexe grene at the openinge
of her lips shall be dried up and of no valwe. The fyshers shall morn / and all that were wont to lay hokes and bend nets at their waters shall lamente:
the spynners and makers of lynyne / the sylke women with ye weavers thereof
shall be begerde and co^funded. At that made pondes and stwes shall break up their
banks. Also the counsels of the folesshe princes of Zoan and the wise counsel
of Pharao shall be turned al into felyshnes. How dare ye then be so bold to
say unto Pharao / I am come of a wise stock / and I am of an auncya^t noble
blood? where now / where (I pray the) are thy wise men? let them tell the
now (I pray the) what ye lord entendeth and has thought to do with Egipte.
The folyshe princes of Zoan and the proud princes of Mempheos begylde Egipte
with their noble high stock. The lord shall mingle the sprite of error
emonge thez that then should seduce Egipte in all things even as the dronken
and vomytinge man is brought out of the way. Egipte shall want counsel to
convaye her causes / she shall not know where she shall begin nor where she
shall make an end / whether it be upon ye land or sea. Then shall Egipte be
like women / fearful and asto^ned at ye lyftinge up of the hand of the lord
of powers / which he shall lyftup agenst her. Also te land of Judah shall be a
thondreclappe to Egipte / so that who so ever mind her to Egipte she shall a
non be sinayde with fear at ye counsel of the lord of powers which he has
decreede agenste her. Then shall there be.v. cytes in the land of Egipte which
shall speak the Chananytes tongue / and shall be sworn unto ye lord of powers /
of the which one is called Heliopolis. Also then shall there be an altar for ye
lord in the mids of Egipte entytlede to the lord to be into a sign and
testymonye for the lord of powers in ye land of Egipte / yt when they krye
unto him / for fear of their oppressors he might send them a saviowr and a
guide which might deliver them. The lord shall know the Egypcions and agene
the Egipcions shall know the Lord / then shall they worship him with sacryfices
and gifts. They shall vow unto the lord and perform it. Thus shall the lord
smite the Egypcions and heal them agene / thus shall they be converted to the
lord / and thus shall he be merciful unto them and shall heal the^. Then shall
the way be comenly hawnted from Egypt to Assyria / and the Assyrions shall
come to the Egypcions and Thegypcions agene to them / and they shall both
worship one God. Then shall Israel with Egipte and Assyria make all three one
blessed trinite in the mids of the earth / which trinite the lord of powers
shall bless saying: Blessed be Egipte my people / blessed be the Assirions ye
work of my hands / and blessed be Israel my inheretaunce.

Chap. xx.
IN the year that Thartan came to Azotum sent of Sargon king of the
Assyrions and had won by bataile and taken Azotum: ye lord spoke unto Isaye
the son of Amoz thus saying. Go and draw of thy sack from thy loins and
lose thy shoes from thy fete / which so doing / went naked and bare foot.
And the lord said: ye nakedness and barefote goinge of my seruante Isaye is a
token and a fore shewinge of a woundrefull thing that shall fall upon Egypt
and Ethiope aftyr three days: for so shall the king of Assyrye dryve the
captyues of Egypt and the baneshed of Ethiope / both young and old shall he
drive away naked and barfote: and shall vnkouer the arses of thegipcions being
ashamed of the Ethiops and Ehethiops of thegypcions / and then shall the
dwellers of this eylonde say: is this ower hope unto whom / we fled for help
to be delyuerde from the king of Assyrye? how shall we escape?

The.xxi. Chapter
THe grevouse affliccion of ye wild sea. There is an hevye vision showed me /
like as when a storm brought from the southe comethe owte from the deserte
that terrible land. Babylon shall be beseged rownde about and shall be utterly
destroyde. Come up Elam / besege it Mede / all their syghes shall I swage. At
these words my raynes were a stoned and panges came upon me like the pa^ges of
a woman traveling of child.

When I hard this I fell down / when I se it I was amassed. My heart trembled
and panted / I shoke for fear / and because this thing was derke to me al my
wits were a stonned. For even this noise was hard also: let the table be
laid suddenly / and the watch well appointed / eat / drink / arise capytaynes
and take ye to bukler and shylde. Then thus said the lord to me: Go and set up
a spy that shall tell what he se: which when he had diligently looked rownde
about / he espied a cowple of men cominge rydinge together one of an ass and
the other of a Camel: and this spy kryed like a lion / O my master / I have
stand here besely watchinge all day and have kept my stadinge diligently all this nighe to: And lo there are come a cowple of the which one has brought
this message and said / Babylon is fallen / Babylon is fallen in very deed /
and all the karued and graven Images of their Goddis ar braste agenste the
ground: these are the tydinges (o my felawes in work and office) which I
have hard of the Lord of powers to show unto you. The heuye affliccion of
Dume.

Me thought I hard a noise of one kringe from Seir saying: watch man what
haste thou espied this might? watch man what haste thou espied this night?
which me thought answerde.

The day is come / and the night shall come agene / and if ye be so desyerouse
to know / come agene then and ask. The hevye affliccion laid upon the
Arabens. ye shall lodge all night in the wode in the way to Dedamin: but o ye
cytese^s of Theme / bringeforth water for the thyrstye / and mete ye the men in
slyght with vytel: for they shall flee from the face of yerne / even from the
edge of the naked sword / from the presens of the bente bow / and from the
edge of the set field cominge upon them: for thus has the lord spoken unto
me: Aftyr this year all the power of Cedar shall have an end even like the
goinge forth of the service of an hyerde man / his years now served out /
and the reamnaunte of the Archers of Cedar shall be thruste into a full narowe
straighte. For it is the Lord God of Israel that has spoken it.

Chap.xxij.
THe hevye affliccion of the vale of the vision. What ayeldeth you thus al
together to clyme up upon yowr house tops / O cite full of woundringe / and
running together on heaps which sometime have ben so welthy a town? ye are
yet a live and yet areye but as slain men with sword in bataile: for all your
capytayns ar fled on horseback out of boweshote / ye / al thy princes are
slipte a way and fled full far from the. When I hard these things / I
said / Go yowrr ways from that I might weep bitterlye / nether be you about
to conforte me as concerning the destruction of my people: For this is the
day of tribulacion / downtredinge and confuse perplexite of y^ vale of the
vysion (the lord god of powers so throing down her walls that the noise
rebowndeth agenste the mountayns): And I saw y^ Elamytes taking to them their
quyvers and the horse men with their Charietes be^dinge their selves to fight
/ and Cir made bare their shyldes. Thy chosen valeys were filled with chariets
and the horse men assailed boldly the gates. Then the beutiful deckinge of
Judah was taken a way: and the house of ordinance made with the timber of
lybani was laid wide open / then shall ye se through chynnes into every korner
of the cite of David / yt shall be so sore shaken and rent: and ye shall gather
to gither the waters of the lower pole / ye shall also tell the houses of
Jerusalem / and break them down to defend the walls / and ye shall be
compelled to make a dyke between the two walls with the waters of the old
pole / having no consyderacion of the first making there of nor yet of y^
porpose of her first maker. Farther more in those days / the Lord god of
hosts shall call you to wepinge and moorninge to tearing of yower hear of
yower heads and to wearinge of sack whiles lo some men laughe and make merry
slaing oxen and sheep / eating flesh and drinkinge wine saying / let us eat
and drink for we shall dye to morrow: which thing when it came to y^ ears
of the Lord god of powers / he said. This same yower syme shall not be pourged
but by yower death. Farthermore thus spoke the Lord God of powers. Go thy
ways into this tresure house unto Sobnam president of the town house / and
ask him / what make thou here? Or who made the so bold to hew the here a
sepulcher? (For he had graven him a proud tomb out of stone and had made
him a cowche there in). Behold the Lord shall cast the out violently / and
shall array the with a new cote / he shall clothe the with a strange vesture
/ and tryndel y^ like a balle into a far and wide country and there shall
thou dye / there shall the pomp of thy charietes be ended O shame and sclawndr
of the house of thy Lord: I shall thruste the (says the lord) from thy
standinge / and shall put the from thy order. And after this shall I call my
seruante Eliakim the son of Helkye / and I shall put thy clothes upon his
back and shall gyrde him with thy gyrdle / and thy power shall I be take into
his hands / and he shall be the father both of the cite of Jerusalem and of the
house of Judah / and Ishall hang the kaye of the house of David upon his
shoulders / and when he shall open it / noman shall shitte it agene / and when
he shall shit it / noman shall open it agene: And I shall pitche him as fast
as a stake in the hygheste and faithfullest place / and he shall be promoted unto
the gloriouse seat of his fathers house. All the glory of his fathers house
and of his chylders chylderne shall they offer unto him / ye / and all vessels
both great and small with all manner of music instruments. These things (at
the warninge of the Lord of powers) shall be done even then when this stake
which was set in the most faithfulleste place and authorite shall be plucked up
/ and the burden that dependethe upon him shall be plucked up by the rote /
throne down / and broken: for it is the lord that spoke it.

Cha.xxiij. The heuye affliccion of Tyrus.
Bewail ye ships of Tharsis for Tyrus is utterly destroyed eue^ of ye
dwellers of y^ eyla^ds to mi^g from their own house to captive the^ The
cytesens of Cypres ar at rest / y^ mchantes of Sydon which were wont to have
recourse thither by sea and all that thither occupied now cease / whose pure
whete with all manner of good grain was thither brought from Nilus by sea /
fore it was the haven town of merchandise for alnacions. Sydon is a shamed /
the sea with all her power money shinge her saying: I would I had never been
mother to have brouht up her young me^ and decked her maidens: Egypt / as soon as she hear of this / shall bewail it even like Tyrus her own self. They
that are beyende the sea with the citesens of the eylandes all lamente these
grevouse affliccion saying was not this yower plesaunte commodiouse cite whose
auncyauntnes have be commended of long time? The goer from her into far
countres have noblye spread her name. Who would have thought that this hevye
chaunse should have happened to Tyrus the flower of cytes? Whose merchant men
were Princes / and the pears of the world occupied unto her The lord of
powers has decreed this to abate the pride of all stowtenes / and to pluck
down all the gloriouse of the earth: Pass over all thy land like a flowde (O
nymphe of the sea) and yet shalt thou not find the siche a another gyrdle. The
Lord which has trowbled the Kingdoms and laid his hand upon Chanaan to
destroy her strong pears / has now stretched forth his hand also unto
the sea saying. Thou shall no more be glad: For thou shalt suffer the
violence of the Cethens / O virgen daughter of Zidon. Wherefore arise and go thy
ways (although thou shall not there have any rest) for lo the land of the
Chaldes was a nation that had no felawes / and Assure first builded it / but
yet he left it for wodowses: he builded their strong holds and palaces /
but yet they brought them to naught. Wayle ye therefore o ships of the sea for
yower strength is gone. And then thus shall it happen also to Tyrus / it shall
be forgoten. lxx. years even a kings age / and after.lxx. years it shall
happen to Tyrus as to an harlet mynstrel / to whom men say / take thy harp
and go about in the cite (foul forgoten harlet) that with thy well playnge
and singing all manner of songs thou myghteste yet so be remembered and known
agene: even so I say shall it chaunse unto Tyrus / After.lxx. years / the
Lord shall look upon Tyrus and restore her to her own: which shall use her
feats of merchandise with all the kyngdoms of the face of the earth / and her
marcha^dyse and occupyinge shall be accept to ye lord / for they shall not be
hyd and muggerdvp but be turned from one to a nothr in Tyro / as it becomes
the cytesens of y^ Lord / into the refreshinge of the nedyons / and clothinge
of age.

Chap. xxiiij.
Behold y^ Lord shall waste and destroy ye rownde world / he shall wrythe of
her face and scater her inhabitours. And then shall ye lay people and preeste /
servant and Master / Maid and mastres / byer and seller / lendr and borowr
creditour and detter / be ala lyk non beter then a nothr. Full myserably shall
therthe be wasted and destroyed: for the lord has decreed it / therthe shall
wayle and fala way / the world shall be full feable and slide down. The proud
people of therthe shall faynte: for the earth is defyeled of her own
inhabitours in yt they have tra^sgressed ye law / they have altered ye
ordinances / and broken the everlasti^g co^uenaunte. Wherefore malediccio^ and
kurse shall devower therthe / because her inhabit^urs have offended: whereupon
they shall be mad / and very few mortal men shall be left a lyve. Wine shall
moorne / and the vynes shall faldowne / al men shall sighe sorowfully yt were
wont to be iocunde in heart. The myrthe of timpanyes / sweet songs with their
plesaunte harpes al shall cease. they shall not dri^k wine with songs. Bear
shall be bittr to the dri^kers / cytes given to vanyte shall be destroyed / every
house shall be shit up yt noman may go in. The skasenes of wine shall be kryed
out in the streates. All myrthe shall be gone / and the joy of the earth shall
fall a way / desolacion shall be left in the cytes / and mysery shall steke upon
the gates: for so shall it come to all the earth and to all the people as if
one should betedowne the thin resydue of the olyve beryes and pyke of the
reamnaunte of grapes after the grape gatheringe. And then they that shall be yet
left shall with loud voice extol the majesty of the lord / singing from
the sea and magnifyinge the name of the Lord God of Israel from the kaues and
eylandis. We hear comenlye songs sunge thorowte all the earth into the praise
of the rightwouse. And I me self say / Oh my barennes / oh my penurye / ah
less for sorrow / all the world is full of ungodly sinners / ye and that of
siche sinners which sin even of a set porpose so boldelye. Wherefore fear and
dread / pit and snare / gape fore the O dweller upon ye earth / so that he
that would fle to avoyde the fearful voice must fall into the pit and if he
krepeth out of the pit he shall be taken in the snare. For the wyndowes of
heaven shall be opened and the foundacions of the earth shall be shaken together
The earth shall give a meruelouse crack / the earth shall be sore broken / the
earth shall be violently shaken in sondre / ye earth shall stacker like a dronken
man and be borne over like a tente / For her sin shall lie full hevye upon her
/ and she shall fall / never aftyr to arise. And then this thing shall come /
the lord shall vyset the proud sprytes of the air that are above / and the
kings of the earth that inhabit the earth / and these shall be gatherde together
as men in bands to be cast into doungens and shit up in presons and be
punysshed for ever.

Even the moon shall be then ashamed / the son shall be confounded when ye lord
of powers shall reign in the mount Zion and in Jerusalem / acco^paned with
so gloriouse a sage multitude.

Chapter xxv
Lord thou art my God / I shall extol the and magnify thy name / for thou
doist things to be merueld at / according to thy auncyaunte counsels both
fast and faithful For thou turnest great cytes into heaps of earth / strong
defensed towns into ruin / and the houses of the ungodly thou pluckeste out
of cytes never to be restored: wherefore even the rude people must needs
glorifye the and the cytes of the cruel gentyles must fear the.

For thou art the weak mannis strength and the poor mannis might when he is
in destresse / thou art a refugye in tempests / a shadwe in heat / and where
the hastye violence of tyrau^tes break in like a whyrlewynde there thou set
in thy self agenste them like a strong wall. Thou art to them like ye
drowght in the deserte. It is thou that swagest the swellinge boldenes of ye
ungodly / thou put away the heat with the shadwe of a cloud / and
cuttest away the violent like a vine twygge Farthermore ye lord of hosts
shall feste al ye people in this hyl / he shall make the^ a plentuouse and a
delicate feste of ye most fattest and full of marye / with ye most best and
eldest wine / he shall take away ye veyle in this hill / even ye veyle y^
ha^geth before ye face of al ye people and ye koveri^ge which koverth ye face
of al ye gentiles: death shall he utterly devower / and ye lord god shall wype
away ye tears from everi man's face / and ye opprobrye of his people thorowt
al ye world shall he take away for it is ye lord yt spoke it. Also men shall
say in this day. Behold / this is owr god / we have trusted in him / and he
has saved us this is the lord in whom we-beleued / let us now rejoice and
beglad in his sauinge health / for it was his hand that favourde this hill:
But Moab shall be alto broken of him / as small as chafe to be cast into the
donghill / fore he shall stretche forth his hands agenste him even like a
swymmer when he swymmethe / and he shall thruste down his pride by the vertwe
of his power / he shall make his high walls of defense to rele / and lay them
full low upon the grownde and smite them to powlder.

Chap. xxvj.
And then shall this song be sunge in the land of Judah. We have a strong cite
/ a savior is her walls and hyrbolwerke. Opene ye her gates that the
rightwous folk and the lovers of faithfulness moughte enteryn: Thou which art
both Master and workman shall frame together peace / even ye very peace (I tell
you) for in the / men trust. Trust in ye lord for ever for he bends down
the stately cytesen / and the proud cite he castethe to the grownde / and in
process brings it into duste to be trodden under ye fete even of y^ poor
nedyons. Thou (lord) ponderste the pathe of the ryghtwyse whether it be just
and whether his way be eaven: wherefore we meruelat ye paths of thy iugements:
for in thy name / and at the rememberaunce of the / mannis soul is fed. I
desyer ye be night with all my heart / and with all my mind and spirit with in
me I haste me to the: for a non as thy Iugements were publesshed in the world
/ the inhabitours thereof learned rightwysnes: but the ungodly when he had once
gotten mercy / he learned not ryghtwysnes / but as soon as he is correkte he
synnethe the more and fears not the majesty of ye Lord. Lord they wilnot
see thy high power / but the time shall come that they shall see it and be
confounded / when thou shall devower them by the indignacion of the people and
by the fire of thy enymes. But emo^ge us (Lord) thou shall set peace / for it
is thou yt workest and fyneshest all things in us both ower thoughts and
ower deades.

O Lord ower god / although strange Lords contrary to the have been rulers
over us: yet not with standinge we remember the only and bear thy name i^ ower
minds. The cruel Tyrauntes which are now deed / live not: nether ar they
rekened in the resurreccion of the faithful. For thou haste so visited and
destroyed them that all their memorial should pereshe. But contrary wise / thy
folk (Lord) thou haste encresed / thou haste encresed thy people / glorified
and magnified them thorowte all the coostes of the earth. Lord / in their
tribulacion they seek the: Affliccion and sorrowful complayninge are to them thy
nourteringe: but in the mean time as a woman great with child when her time
is come trauelleth and kryeth for anguyshe and pain / even so are we (Lord)
in thy sight: we conceive / we travel / and in a manner we bringeforth health
through the spyrit / lest therthe shouldbe destroyed and the dwellers there in
should peresshe: But thy deed men live and ower dear beloved are in the
resurreccion: They are awake and right glad which lie in the duste: For thou
waterest them with the dew of light and life: but the habitacion of the
violente is fallen away. Go yower way therefore my people into yower secret
closets and shit the door aftyr you / abide / and suffer / even but a momente
till the wrath bepassed over: For lo / the lord shall comeforth of his place
to vyset the wykednes of thinhabitours of the earth / which earth shall
disclosse whose blood so ever she has drunk / and shall hyde no longer her
slain persons.

Cha.xxvij.
THe time shall come that the lord shall vyset Leuiathan / that invincible
serpent with his hard / great / strong sword / even Leviathan that subtel
serpente: and shall slaye this dragone of the sea. Then shall men hear this
song upon the amiable vyneyarde of Hemer / one answeringe a another / I the
Lord defend and water her in dwe time. I keep her day and night lest any
man invade her. I am with out all wrath: who then may so move me to be so
great an enymye to her that (my promise neglecte) I would set her a fire all at
once with thorns and briars? Or who may hold bak my strength / to pacefye me
and to reconcyle me unto her if I would not? But Jacob brought owte of
Captivity unlooked for / shall be roted agene / Israel shall budde and floureshe so
that the holl world shall be repleyneshed with their fruits. For shall not the
lord smite his smyters agene even as he was smyten? or shall he not slaye as he
was slain? what mesure so ever mengeue / the same shall they receyve agene. He
blows forth his vehement skorchinge wind. Wherefore the iniquite of Jacob is
pourged on this manner / and by this means he takes away all their synful
seade: as when he turnethe all the stones of their alters into powlder / when
their images worshipped in wodes and solitary temples be laid down / when
their strong cytes are destroyde / when their goodlye fayer cytes are left
desolate like a wyldernes for bullocks to feed theryn to lie and brose on the
bouwes: when their corn is brentvp / and the women which in their cominge
forth garneshed their cytes are defyeled: fore this people is with owte
understanding. Wherefore their maker wilnot pity them / and their potter shall
have no fansye to them. In these days the lord shall smite down all the
fruits from the fyerce flowde Euphrates unto Nilus the flowde of Egypt: and
ye chylderne of Israel one by one shall be gatherd together in to one place: And
then shall there blowvp a meruelouse great trompet / and they that had
perysshed in Assyria and been outlawes in Egipte shall come forth to worshipe
the Lord in the holy hill which is in Jerusalem.

WOE be to the proud crown of dronken Cphraim and to the fallinge flower of
her gloriouse beutie which is set in the top over the most plentuoust vale /
woe be to the dronkherds. Behold / the strong power of the lord comethe like
an hay le storm dryuynge down strong holds / and like a great shower of
rain dryuinge upon every part of therthe: even with mennis fete shall the
proud crown of dronken Ephraim be trodden down / and it shall happen to the
fadinge flower of her g^oriouse beutye which yet stands on the top over the
most plentuouse vale even as it happens unto the hastye fruit ripe before y^
harueste / which as soon as on espieth it he is redye to devower it before his
hand can reche it. Aftyr this / the lord of powers shall be a Ioyefull crown
and a beutifull garlande to the residwe of his people and shall be the spyrit
both of judgment to y^ iuges / and the spirit of strength to thez that shall
dryve his enemis from the gates. But yet even these also err witheoute
knowledge by the reason of wine / and are with out their wits for their
welthy dronkenes. ye their priests and prophets also err out of the way
for dronken welthynes. For they laden with wine / and drowned with lust / err
in preachinge / and offend in iuginge: for all their tables are so filled with
vometes and fylthynes that no part shall be left vnfylled. Which of them (I
pray you) shall be then able to i^structe any man or to teach the right
disciplyne to any of these chylderne newely weaned and plucked from y^ teate?
Or what else may they teach then clowtinge constitution to constitution /
throyng one commandment upon a nothr / inhibicion upon inhibicion / a little
here and a little whiles there. Wherefore lord shall speak unto this people
confusely and in a strange tongue unto who^ he said sometime. This shall quiet
thy conscience: this refressheth y^ weary and afflicte soul: It is this (I tell
the) that shall bring thy heart into a blessed peace and rest: but they would
not hear: wherefore y^ lord shall speak to the^ saying. Bid and command agene
/ forbid and forbid agene / a little here and a little whiles there / that they
might go backwarde / fall / and be alto broken / ye y^ they might fall into
their snares and be taken. Wherefore hear the word of the lord Oye old wylye
skorners / which play the Lords over my people which is in Jerusalem: for
thus think ye / we are at a bargain with death / and at a poi^te with hell /
that when any great myscheffe or plage comes / it shall not touch us: for
dissembli^g hypocrysye shall be our refugye / and with lies we shall be defended.
Whr for even thus tells you ye lord god saying. Behold I shall lay a stone
in zio^ / a touch stone / a kornerd stone / a preciouse stone to stablesshe ye
foundation: so yt whosoever evr believes and cleueth to this stone / shall not
lightly slide: for his equite and eavenes shall I try by plomet and squire /
and his rightwysnes shall be po^derd as in a payer of bala^ces. But an haple
storm shall take away your refuge which ye stablessed: and your defense
painted with kraftye lies swellinge waters shall bare away: and yor barge^ made
with death shall be broken / your apointme^t also made with hell shalnot stand:
for when this swellinge destruccio^ shall arise and come upon you it shall
swelowe you in and karye you a way suddenly. For when it shall begin erly in
the morning / it shall enduwr but the same day and night / and there shall be
siche a fear that it alone shall break even the hearts of the^ that do but
hear of this. Then shall beds be so narowe that noman may have his rest /
and the koueringes so skante y^ noman may be wrapped in them for the lord
shall stepeforth as he did in the mount of Perazim and shall roffle angerly as
he did in the vale of Gibeon to work his own work: he takes a meruelouse
strange ways / to bri^ge his own work to pass / full strange and wou^dreful
are his deeds. Now therefore dispyse not this warninge lesteyowr captiuyte be
the more grevouse: For I have hard of the lord god of powers that there shall
come a soden end and destruction upon all the earth. Lysten therefore and hear
my voice / give head and believe my words. Is not the tylman always busye in
duwe time to ploughe / to opene / and to kutforth his land to sow it? does
he not a non as he has made it eaven and plain sow his fetches or sprynkel
his Coomyn? and aftyr ward sow it orderly now with wh^te and then with barley
and so forth with other corn acordinge to the strength of y^ soil? And to do
these things duly in order do not his god teach and dyrecte him? for he
thressheth not his fetehes with a wayne / nor turns the carte whele upon his
Coomyn. But the fetches he thressheth with a flayle / and his Coomyn he beats
forth with a staff / and even so lykwyse he gryndeth his whete into bread.
Which he could never do with thresshinge it. For nether the violence of the
turninge of the carte whele: nor yet the tredinge of the beast^sfete may
grynde it into meal. And this thing is showed him of the Lord of powers
which is the most meruelste counseler and the gretest magnifyer of equity.

Chap. xxix.
WOE be unto y^ Ariel / Ariel / a cite sometime subdued of David.
Take yet a few years respite set some festes yet pass over awhyle / and
then suerly shall I besege Ariel. Then shall she be so heavy and so kareful that
she may welbe called Ariel. I shall co^pase the rownd a boute with tents and
castells and shitte the in with towers and drive up bolwerkes agenste the. And
thou shall be so low brought that thou shall speak even out of y^ grownde /
and as of one buried in the duste thy voice shall be hard. For thy voice shall be
like a sprite speakinge out of therth / so fayntly shall thou groan out of
the grownde. For the multitude of thy enymes shall be like the motes in y^ son
beams and the cruel multitude of them shalcome upon the like duste reased up
and karyed suddenly in the twinklinge of an eye. Then shall thou be visited of
the lord of powers with thondre / earth quakes / and fearful crackes / with
whyrlwi^des / stormey tempests / and with the flame of a devoweringe fire. But
now all this multitude of the gentyles being about to bring forth their
army age^ste Ariel / all this host / the compassinge about her / and her
besegers al appear abyet to be but a dream of an hongrye man dreaminge to have
eaten / which now waking is full hongrye having his belly emptye / and like a
thirstye man dreaminge that he drinks and a non as he is a wake he is full
faynte and dry whose desyer yet birneth for drink Thus (I say) appears the
multitude of al these gentyls as yet to be like / which shall fight agenste the
mount Zion. But then shall ye be amassed / astoned gapynge and beholdinge al
these things / ye shall be dronken / but not with wine / ye shall rele / but not
for dronkenes / for the lord shall power forth upon you the spryte of a deep
slomber / and shall shit up yower eyes / that is to say he shall kouer yowr
prophets and cheffe saying men: And al prophecyes shall be unto you even as the
words of a clasped book and sealed up: which if thou offerest unto a well
lettred man saying / I pray you read this book / he shall say / I cannot read
it for it is sealed up: Also if it be given to an unlearned man saying / I pray
the read this book / he shall answer the. I am not lettrede. Wherefore thus
says the lord. Because that this people draws nighe me with their mouths
and with their lips speak mich worship by me their hearts being far fro me
/ and because the fear that they owe unto me they give it me aftyr the
doctrine and the commandments of men / therefore behold / I my self shall do
to this people a thing to be merueled and woundred at a bo ve mesure: that is
to say / I shall destroy the wisdom of their wysemen and the understanding
of their men of most actiuite shall have a fall. Woe be to them that so depely
drown their selves in their own policye / that they think to hyde their
thoughts and counsels from the lord. Which hyde their enforcements and
studes in derkenes saying presumptuously: Who sethe us? or who knows us?
which yower presumpcion / is as though y^ potters claye should devyse with in
it self or that y^ work should say to her master. Make me not: and as thoghe
y^ pot should report upon hyrpotter / that he understands not. See ye not
now therefore to be even at hand that Libanus shall be turned into Charmelum and
Charmelus shall be rekened among y^ wodes? Even then shall the deffe understand
the words of the book / and the eyes of the blind (the derke cloud taken a
way) shall receive light: And y^ oppressed shall celebrate a glad day to y^
lord / and the nedyons shall rejoice in him that makes holy Israel. For these
violente tyrauntes shall be consumed / and these wylye mockinge hypocrytes shall
perish. And these that are so bente upon myschefe to lead men into sin for
the noonce goinge a bought to supplante y^ reprover that sits in judgment /
and through lies lead the rightwyse into a contrary pathe shall be kutof.
Wherefore thus says the lord the saviowr of Abraham unto the house of Jacob.
Let not Jacob now be ashamed nethr change his chere when he seithe even them
also whom my hands have made to be emonge his chylderne to sanctifye my name /
ye to sanctifye him that makes holy Jacob and to worshipe y^ god of Israel.
Which ge^tyls lately erred / but now have they the spyrit of understanding:
which before were barbarouse and fyerce but now ar they tamed and learned the
law.

Chap. xxx.
Fyghe upon these unnatural chylderne
goi^g out of kind (says the lord) which dare make a counsel with out my
counsel / and weaue a web nothing aftyr my mind / to heap sin upon sin.
For they goforth to descend into Egypt and asked not my mouth: trustinge to
Pharaos strength and in the shadewe os the Egypcions: but Pharaos help shall be
turned into yower confusion: and the confidence yt ye have in the protection of
y^ Egyptio^s shall turn ye to ignominye. yowr princes were in Zoana and yower
Ambassiatours came to Hanesam: But yet shall ye be all ashamed of y^ people
that may not help you: for they shall nether bring you help nor ayed / but
shall bring you into confusion and opprobrye. yower beasts went laden by the
sowth way / ye through a region full of perel and fear be cause of lions and
lyonesses / kocketryces and swyfte fleyng dragons lay there: yower mules were
laden upon their shulders with yower tresure: and Camels bore upon their
bunchedbackes yowr rich presents to people vnalbe to help you. For full
vain and unprofitable shall be the Egypcions help: wherefore I kryed upon you on
this manner / let yowr proud audacite cease: And now therefore go write this
thing in their own tables and record it in a book to endwer into a perpetual
testimonye to their posterite. For this people is stowrdie / they are false
chylderne / chylderne that love not to hear the law of the Lord. Which dare
say to the prophets / kare ye not for us and also to the saying men tell not
us of things to come / but preach us pleasant things look us out deceytes
/ say forsake this way / go from that way and at last take from us even
him that makes holy Israel / Wherefore thus says he that makes holy Israel.
For as myche as ye have thus abhorred my word trustinge in fraud and violence
cleuynge there unto / this same yower wykednes shall be yowr break and fall /
even like a relinge high holowe wall which comes down al at once year any
man beware: ye / yowr destruction shall be like the breakinge of an erthen
pitsherde whose fall and breaking noman shall pity / no although it be so small
broken that there be not fownde thereof so miche as would fetch a cole of fire
or take up a litel water from the pit / for even thus has the lord god
which sanctifiyth Israel promised saying. In sittinge still quyetlye shall ye
be saved: for in silence and hope stands yowr strength: but as for you / ye
never received it / but rather said nay not so: but we wylget us to horskacke
and so estape: but think ye so to flee and to escape? ye will answer / the
swyfter that owr horse be / the sooner shall we be out of danger. And I tell
you agene / that the faster ye flee / the swyftlyer shall yower persuers follow
upon you: so that a thousand of you shall fle at ye fear of one man or of fyde
at the most until ye be left as thynne as stand the trees in y^ hill tops
left for mastes of ship / ye shall stand as naked in sight as a mark in a
molle hill. Not withestandinge yet in the mean time / the Lord abyddeth with
long sufferinge to have mercy upon you / and suspendeth his counsel to then
tente he would be bountuously mercy full to you: for the lord god is full
rightwyse: And blessed are all men that wait on him: If ye thus do (O people
of Zion and cytesens of Jerusalem) ye should never weep: for suerly he would
have mercy on you / ye as soon as he hard the voice of yower kryige he would
help you. It is the Lord verily that gives you the bread of affliccion and
the water of heaviness. But yet will not yower master abhor you long / if ye
looked up with yower eyes reverently unto yower teacher and yower ears hear
the words of him warni^ge and tellinge you saying: This is the way / this
way see that ye go whether he se you swarui^ge either on the right hand or on
the left hand. If ye hear yowr master (I tell you) and will despise the
curiouse sylveringe of yower ka ruen Images / and through a way the costuouse
gyldinge of them even as ye would abhor clothes polluted with menstrwe / and
bid them walk strangers. Then shall he give rain to yo were sede which ye
shall commit unto the ground / and it shall bring forth fode from the
earth: and there shall be plentye and great abundance. And then shall yower
heardes feed upon yower broad medewes / yower drafte oxen and muses shall eat
fat prouendoure wen^w^d with the fan. Also diverse ryuers of waters shall
flow down from every high mountain and high hylle. But aftyr great
slaughter and ruin of towers / y^ moan shall be as bryghte as the son: and the
light of the son shall be seven times bryghter then it is and so great as is
the light of.vij. days altogether / ye and especially in that time when the
Lord shall bind together the break of his people and shall heal the gappe of
their wound. For behold / the majesty of ye lord shall come from a far /
his face shall brenne so bright that none may abide it / his lips shall be full
of indignacion and his tongue like a devoweringe fire / his breath shall be like a
swelling flowde arysinge up to the throat to take a way the haithen which are
given to vanyte / and to take a way the brydel of error being yet in the
chaves of the people: but you shall syngeas men in y^ vygils of holyfestes and
be glad in heart like them that go by the trompet blowers goinge forth to the
hyl of the lord even the rock of Israel. Also the lord shall put forth the
gloriouse power of his voice and shall show forth his threteninge arm with a
grymme countenance and with the flame of deuoweringe fire / ye and that with
an earth quake and a great hayle storm. Then shall the Assyrions be a frayde at
the voice of the lord which shall smite the^ with a rod / and the rod that
the Lord shall bend agenst them shall go through every foundation. Which rod
he shall lay upon them with tympanes / harpes and battle to overcome the^.
For even from the beginning huth he prepared the fire of affliccion ye and
that for the very kings / which fire has he made both deep and broad runninge
violently as in A great heap of wode whose violence the blaste of the lord
sets a fire like ye floteringe noise of brym stone.

Chap.xxxj.
WOE be to thez that godowne in to Egypt for help / which trust in their
horse / and put their confidence in their chariets because they are so many /
and in their horse men because their strength is mighty: but unto him yt
makes holy Israel they have no respect / and the lord never seek they / when
he of his infinyte wisdom brings affliccion upon men / and yet his word
makes he not void / he ryseth agenst the famylye of the wyked / and agenst
the help of eveldoers. The Egipcio^s verily ar men and not gods and their
horse ar flesshlye and not of ye spirit. Wherefore when the lord shall stretche
forth his hand / both the helper / and he that looks for help shall fall: and
shall be altogether destroyed. For thus has the lord spoken to me: Even as a
lion / or ye lyo^s whelpe roreth over her proye now taken / fearing nothi^ge
at the noise of al y^ herdmenkrying at him / no not once abashed at their out
shryte / so shall the lord of hosts come down to defend and fight for the
mount Zion and for her fytel hill. The lord of powers shall defend Jerusalem
like a bird flotteringe about her neste / kepinge / delyvering / awaytinge
and saving her. Come up agene (O ye chylderne of Israel) as far as ye have
gone down forsakyng yowr god / for the time shall come yt every man shall cast
a way their silver images and golden Idols which yowr ungracious hands have
made into yowr sin. Assure shall be smitendowne with sword but not with ye
sword of man / and ye sword shall devower him / but not ye sword of man / and
he shall fle from ye slaughter (his host taken) he shall overrunne his own
castle for fear / and his capitayns shall abhor and be ashamed of their own
baners and badges. These things has ye lord spoken / whose lau^pe is fed
in Zion and his fire is nouresshed in Jerusalem.

Chapter.xxxij.
Behold / a king shall reign aftyr the rule of rightwysnes and his chief
rulers shall govern and ordyr aftyr the balaunce of Equite: Which dwe
adminstracion shall be unto the subjects as shelter from the wind and defense
from the storm. Siche princes shall refresshe theirs even as sweet ryvers in
a dry place / and like the shadewe of a great high rock in a thyrstye land.
The eyes of the seers shalnot be deceived / and the ears of the hearers shall
take good head / and the hearts of the stockysshe fools shall understand
learinge: the stuttinge tongue shall speak distinctly and eloquently / also the
knave shalnomore be called Ientelman nether the nyggerde shall be called lyberall
/ but the knave shall think knauyshe things and his heart shall properly
convaye wykednes to play the hipocryte and to conspyre abhominacion agenste ye
lord / pylling and polling the hongrye soul / and taking the drink form y^
thyrstye. These are his myschevouse weapens / these ar his dedely counsels to
destroy to pylle and to rob ye poor afflicte with lyi^ge words / ye and yt
whiles he mynistreth ye law unto the^ / but ye Ie^telma^ co^ceyueth Ie^tel
things / by which Ie^tel and noble deads he arysethe and is beco^e clear. But
o ye rich cytes geven al to welthye ydlenes / arise and hear my voice. Geve
ear unto my words ye cytes that sit so fast and suer: for aftyr certain
days and years ye shall be troubled (o ye cytes so suer). When y^ grape
gatheringe shall be at a stay / and the gatherer of the fruits shalnot come you
shall be a stonned / o rich cytes in so welthy ydlenes / ye shall be amassed fore
al yower suer confidence to se yower self brought so bare / and yower bare
loins gyrte with sack. At the very soukinge teate shall there be waylinge for
y^ croppe of the year / and for thencrese of the vine yard: fore my peoples
feldes shall yilde them briars and thorns because that all the house holds and
cytes are full of vain mirthe and welthye wantenes. Their palaces shall be
throne down / and their cytes so full of people shall be left void: Their
towers and turrettes of defense shall be brought into perpetual dens into
battlinge places for mules and pastures for flocks. Until the spyret be powerd
into us from above / Charmelus shall be turned into a deserte / and Charmelus
shall be taken for a wode / and equity shall dwell in y^ deserte / and
rightwysnes shall inhabit Charmelum / and peace shall be the end of rightwysnes
/ rest and suernes shall follow rightwysnes for ever. And my people shall
dwell in the fayer house of peace / in suer tabernacles / and in rich beds.
Hayle / when it shall defcende / it shall fall only upon wodes and cytes / O how
happy are you which shall sow boldly and suer / ye and that by every
ryuersyde settinge the fete of your oxen and asses whother wards so ever ye
lust.

But woe be unto the that robbeste and destroyste wother: for shaft not thou thy

so shall thou be hurted agene / and as thou haste laid wait to destroy
wother / even so like manner shall thou thy self peryshe.

Lord have mercy on us / fore upon the do we depend. Thoghe it be so that
their power be bente to pursue us: yet be thou a present savyowre to us in
time of tribulacion. Let this people fle a way at thy angrye voice. Let these
haythen folk be scaterd and dispersed a way at thy busklynge up to ruffle.

Let their proye be taken a way from them / as men take away locustes /
when they gather a great multitude together and cast thez into a dyke. Be thou
exalted (Lord) which dwell above: Let Zyon be filled with equity and
ryghtwysnes. Let the faith be in her time: Let strength / health / wisdom /
knoweledge / and fear of the Lord be her tresure. Behold / the angels of
them krye witheowte / the angels of peace weep bitterly / the paths are
forsaken / the wayefayerers are gone / the conuenauntes are broken / cytes are
neglecte / noman sets by a another / the land now destroyed / lies
moorning the beutye of Libanus is cut down and turned into her shame / the
goodly pasture of Saron is like a dry deserte: the plentuous feldes of Basan
and charmelus are gone. Wherefore now shall I arise (says the lord) now will I
be exalted now will I be borne up an high. But you shall conceive chafe and
bringeforth stubble and yower own fyerye breathe shall devower you: the people
shall be burned like lyme / and shall be lyk thorns cut down sor the fire: Hear
therefore / ye that dwell a far what I will do / and ye that are nighe know
my power / The sinners are a frayde in Zion and tremblinge fear holds
hypocrytes saying / which of us shall abide in this devoweringe fire? which of
us shall continue in this perpetual burninge? But he that lives iustlye (I tell
you) and speaks the trwthe / he that abhors to do iniuryes couetuously /
and smyteth a way his hands from gifts / he that stoppethe his hears
lestet hey hear the desaightful oppression of thinnocent blood / and shit his
eyes lest he se evel: this man shall inhabit high places / this mannis
savegarde shall be in right high and strong holds of stone unto this man shall
there be geven y^ very pure fode / his eyes shall se the king in his gloriouse
estate / and shall look over the fartheste region: Also his heart shall delight
in the fear of god. But where is now the wise craftye scrybe? where is now
the deep sercheroute of the words of the law? where is the disputinge doctor
and teacher of young men? But here see thou no strange tonged people / nethr
yet of any hard speech to y^ which thou may not attain / but behold thou
Zion / ower solemn cite / let thy eyes look upon Jerusalem that rich
habitacion even the tabernacle which shall not be moved from her place / whose
nails shall never be plucked out / whose ropes al shall never wexolde / for the
majesty of the Lord shall abide there present with us. This is the place where
broad flowdes shall go full still rown^aboute in sight / in the which nether
rouinge galeys shall sail to rob nor yet any wothr charged ship of war:
for ye lord is owr judge / owr law gevr / the lord shall be ower king / it is
he yt shall save us / here shall the ropes and gables be so stretched forth that
they shall need never to be repayerde / The m^ste shall stand as styfe asthoghe
there were no sail bentevp / and then shall there be great proyes distrybuted /
when even the lame men shall catch proyes. Here shall there be non cast down
into his be^ saying / I am syke / but the people that dwells here shall be
quyte from all deceases.

Chap. xxxiiij.
Approach nighe ye gentyles to hear / and ye people come and take heed / hear
earth / and what so ever is in it / let ye world hear and al thing that
springs out of it / for the lord is angrye with all nations / and his
wrath is so kyndled agenste the power of them / that he will curse them and be
take the^ to death / so that their karions shall be throne away to lie and
stynke / and the mountains shall be whasshed with their blood: fore even the
beutifull power of the heavens shall be consumed / and shall be laid wide opene
like a book under the sky so that all their beuteful aparel shall fall down
like leaves from the vine and from the fygge tree: For even in the heavens will
I bathe my sword / and from thense shall it descend straight to Idumea / and
to the people whom I have appointed to my vengeance. Then shall the sword of
the Lord be bathed in blowde and in the fat and blowde of la^bes and gotes /
and shall be noynted with the fat of the wethers kydneys: for the Lord shall

THe deserts and wyldernes shall be glad / y^ dry land also shall rejoice and
flouresshe like a lyle: It shall flouresshe right plesantly it shall laughe and
rejoice more and more / and be beutyfull to behold. For the beutye of Libanus

the Gentyles shall knowledge the glory of the lord and y^ majesty of ower
God. Be therefore counforted ye syke hands / and be steffe / ye faynte knees /
speak unto the faynte hearted saying / be bold and strong / and fear not.
Behold / yower God shall come to avenge you and to reward you / ye he shall
come to save you. And then shall the eyes of the blind be illumined / and the
ears of the deffe shall be opened. Then shall the lame leap like an heart / and
the domme tongue shall speak praise / Fountayns and springes shall break forth
in the deserte / and sweet ryuers in the dry land / so that the dry land
shall have her pondes and the thirstye earth her quycke springes. In the same
dens where the dragons lay / shall grow sweet flowers and grene rushes.
There shall lie bypathes and the kings high way which shall be called even
the holy way. A polluted man shall not pass through it / for the Lord him

here shall be no lyo^ / nor any other nyouse best shall come up to this way or

everlasting Joy / gladness and solace shall acompany them but hevynes and
sorrow shall be fled away.

The.xxxvi. Chapter.
IT came to pass that in the.viiij. year of king Ezekias / Senherib King of
the Assyrions would come up to conquer and to take all the noble and strong
cytes of Judah. Wherefore this Assyrius sent Rabsacen from Lachis to Jerusalem
unto Ezekias with a great host: which Rabsace when he had laid his host at
the sluse of y^ over pole in the way to the fullers field / there cameforth
unto him Eliakim the sone of Helkie president of the town house / Sobna the
scrybe / and Ioas the secreterye son unto A saphe. unto whom Rabsace spoke
thus / Go yower ways (I pray you) and tell Ezekias how that the great king
of Assprye has spoken these same words: what is this thy confidence to which
thou stekest so fast? Art thou so folyssh hardye to think to have counsel
and power to wage battle? other in whom now at last trustest thou so myche
that thou dare rebel agenste me? I shall tell the / thou trustest to the ayed
and vpholdinge of this broken reed / that is to an Egypcion / to the which
reed whosoever ever leans / he pearseth his hand and boreth it through. Fore
even siche on is Pharao king of Egypt to all that trust upon him: but if thou
wylt say / we trust in the lord ower God: a suer trust in deed to trust in
him whose high places and alters Ezekias has taken away commaundinge Judah
and Jerusalem to worshipe before this alter. Be it in case (I pray the) that I
should geve the now (notwithstanding thy bargayn made with my Lord the king
of Assyrye) two thousand horses / art thou able yet of thy self to man them?
And how is it then / that saying thou art not able to abide the violence and
power even but of one of the least princes of my Lord / yet not withstandinge
/ will thou trust to the horse men and chariets of the egypcions? Think
thou that I of my nowne head am come up hither to destroy this land? It was
my Lord that commanded me saying. Go thy ways up to that land and destroy
it. Then spoke Eliakim / Sobna / and Ioas unto Rabsacen: speak unto us thy
servant (I pray the) in the Sire tongue / for we understand that languege /
and speak not to us in the Iwes languege lest the people now being at the
walls hear. Whom Rabsices answerde. Why / think ye that my Lord sent me
only to you and to your Lord to say this message / and not rather to these
kareful and miserable men that sit upon the walls that they should not be
constrained to eat their own dyrte and to drink their own piss with you?
Rabsace therefore proceeded stefly in his oracion kryinge with a loud voice in
the Iuwes tongue saing / hear what the great king the King of the Assyrions
commands. Thus commands the king / take heed lest king Ezekias deceive
you / for it lies not in his power to defend you / Nether let him persuade
you to trust in his lord / affirminge that y^ Lord with out doubt will
deliver you and that this cite shall not be delyuerde into the hands of the
king of Assyrye: se that ye obaye not Ezekie / for thus promyseth you the
king of Assyrie If ye will bear me so myche favor as to forsake him and
turn to me / every man shall enjoy still his own vyneyarde his fygge trees /
and every man shall drink the waters of his own pytte until I shall come and
lead you vll to a land as good as is this yowers / even a land wheryn is
plentye both o whete and wine: ye / a land al ready sown with al manner corn
and planted with ye best vynes. Take good head yt Ezekias deceyve you not
saying / the Lord shall delyver you. For / have therever yet any of the goddis
of the gentiles delyuerd their land from the power of the king of the
Assyrians? Where is now the God of Hemath and Arphad? Where is the god of
Sepharuaim? And who (I pray you) delyuerde Samaria fro my power? Which on
emonge all the gods of these kingdoms has delyverde their region from my
power / so that ye may trust to the lord to delyver Jerusalem from my hand?
At these words the kings legates were so put to silence that they had not a
word to answer. Then returned Eliakim the presydent of ye town house son
of Helkie / Sobna the scrybe / and Ioas Secreterye the son of Asaph unto
Ezekias their clothes alto cut / and told hi^ the oracion of Rabsacen.

The.xxxvij. Chapter.
THen king Ezekias hearing this / cut his clothes: and he clothed with sack
went into the temple of the Lord: and in the mean time he sent Eliakim the
president of ye town / Sobnam the scribe and the seniours of the priests
clothed with sack unto Isaye the prophet son of Amos which said unto him.
Thus commands us Ezekias to say unto the. The day of tribulacion / the
day of affliccion and blasphemye is now come even like as though the time of
delyueraunce of child were present / and strength to put it forth should
fail the mother. Verily the Lord thy god has hard the words of Rabsace /
whom his Lord the King of Assyrye has sent to blaspheme and to revyse the
lyuinge god with certain words which the lord thy god has hard / wherefore
thou must geve the to prayr for y^ reamnaunte which are yet left a live Then
Isaye answered ye servants of ki^ge Ezekie thussente and comen on this manner
Thus shall ye tell yower lord. Thus says the lord. Fear thou not for these
words which thou have hard / in y^ which the servants of the king of Assyrye
have thus revyled and blasphemed me / for lo / I shall send upon him but a
blaste of wind / whose noise as soon as he hears he shall return into his
own land / where I shall cause him to be slain with sword. Now was
Rabsaces returned and fownde the king of Assyrye making war agenst Lobnam
(for he had knowledge that he was removed from Lachis and it was reported also
of Tharhaca king of the Ethiops yt he shuldbe now come to make war with
him) which message when the king of Assyrye hard / anon he sent other
a^bassiatours to Ezekias with this commandment. Thus shall ye tell Ezekias
king of Judah. Take heed thy god deceive the not in whom thou trusteste
promysinge the that Jerusalem shall not be delyuerd into the hands of the king
of the Assyryons. For thou have hard what great acts the king of Assyry has
done to al kingdoms in subuertinge them / and dare thou have yet any hope to
escape? Did the goddis of y^ Gentyles deliver them whom my predicessours have
conquered? Could they deliver Gozan / Haran / Rezeph / and the Chyldern of
Eden / which hold of Thalassar? where is the king of Hamath / king of
Arphad / king of Sepharuaim / Hene and Aue? Then took king Ezekias the Pystel
of the hands of the Ambassiatours / and when he had red it / he went up into
the house of the lord / and opened it before the lord maki^ge his prayer on
this manner. O lord of powers / the God of Israel / which dwell at the
Cherubyms:thou art ye God which is the only god / even the god of all the
kingdoms of the earth / for it is thou that haste made both heaven and earth.
Bow down thy ear lord and lysten opene thy eyes and behold / Consider all the words of Senherib which has sent hither a blasphemous message / wheryn
he curses and blasphemeth the lyuinge god. Verily (lord) I know this to be
trwe / that the kings / of Assyrye have conquered all tie kingdoms and regions
of the other nations / and that they casted their gods into the fire / for
these were no goddis but the works of mennis hands made of tree and stone /
wherefore they have destroyed them worthily. But now (lord owr god) now save
us from the hands of Senherib that now all the kingdoms of the earth might
know that thou art the lord a lone. When the thing was at this point /
Isaye the son of Amos sent and told Ezekias these words. Thus has the
Lord God of Israel spoken unto these things which thou in thy prayer askedste
of me as concerning the king of the Assyryo^s. Thus answerth the lord agenst
him. O virgyn and daughter of Zion / the king of Assyrye has despised and
scorned the / he shoke his head aftyr the o daughter of Jerusalem: but thou
proud king / who^ revilest thou? whom curseste and blasphemeste thou? Agenste
whom krowest thou or lyftest up thy stately look? verily even agenst him that
sanctifies Israel. For (thy servants sent hither) thou reuyledst the lord
and have taken so stoughtly upon thy self this thing sayng / I shall kouer the
most highest mountayns and sides of Libani with the multitude of my horse men
and chariets / I shall cutdowne her high Ceder trees and her best fyr trees. I
shall enter through both her high mountayns and also her wodes and fayer
feldes. And where I find waters I shall dry them al up with the fete of my
host. Speak thou not now even thus to king Ezekias? sai^ge / have thou not
hard what acts and by what power I have done them in time paste and what I am
abonte to do now also? that is to wete / that I am about to subuerte thy cytes
be they neuerso strong and to bring thez into heaps of stones and into ruin
/ whose inhabitours shall quake for fear like handlesse men being confounded /
for they shall be like the grass of the field which now is grene and a no^ is
it thek for houses / ye which often times is withred before it be ripe. But I
know I know (says y^ lord) thy conversation / I know thy settinge forth and
thy returninge / ye I know thy furyouse rebellinge agenst me For this therefore
thy hasty conspyrison agenste me and for thy pride which al I well know / I
shall put a bridle upon thy nose and shall set a snaffle upon thy lyppes where
with I shall pluck y^ back agene by the same way thou camste But (o Ezekias)
this token shall I give y^ / this year shall thou eat siche as ye have in
store / the next year shall ye eat siche as shall grow of their self with
out tillinge or sowinge / but the third year ye shall both sow and reap
for ye shall plant vynes and eat their fruits And then they shall come agene
together which escaped being of the house of Judah / and their rotes sent
down into the earth / they shall yilde forth their fruteful high. For out of
Jerusalem shall come the reamnaunt that are left / and they that are saved shall
come from the mount Zion. These things shall the zele of the lord of hosts
thus bring to pass / wherefore thus promyseth the lord / as touching king
Assyrye. That in no manner of wise shall he enter into this cite / no not so
myche as an arowc shall he shote hither / there shall no shylde or buckler be
bente up agenste her. Nether shall they dygvp any bulwerke agenste her / but the
same way that he came shall he return. For unto this cite shall he not come
said the lord: for Ishal fight for this cite and shall defend it / (says the
lord) and shall save it for my nowne sake and for my seruante Dauides sake.
Then went forth the angel of the lord and smyt.v. thousand / an ho^dred
and.iiij. score / in the tents of the Assyrions / and when the people of
Jerusalem rose erly in the morni^ge / lo they lay aldede / wherefore Senherib
king o^ Assyrie departed and went his way from thence and abode at Niniue.
And after this / it chanced on a time yt as he worshipped his god in the house
of Nisroch: Adramesech and Sarezer his sons smit of his head with a sword
and fled into the land of Ararat. And aftyr this / Esarhadon his son reigned
for him.

The.xxxviij. Chapter
NOt long before these things were in doing / Ezekias was sore syke and
lykely to have dyed and then came there unto him Isaye y^ prophet the son of
Amoz / and said unto him. Thus says the lord. Set an ordyr in thy house / for
thou shall dyea^d not live. Then Ezekias turned his face to the wall and made
his prayer to y^ lord saying: Remembyr lord (I beseech the) how I have walked
before the intrwe faith / with perfect heart doing thy plesures. And thus
saying Ezekias wept sore / Then spoke the lord to Isaye on this manner. Go thy
ways and tell Ezekias. Thus says the lord / the god of thy father David. I
have hard thy prayer / I have seen thy tears: wherefore lo / I add yet unto
thy life.xv. years also I shall deliver the and this cite which I defend from
the hands of the king of the Assyrions. And this token shall be given y^ of the
lord that he will perform his promise. Behold / I shall bring back the
shadue of the dyall which shadne is now descended with the son arysinge in
Ahazdy all and shall turn it up agene.x. hours: then turned back the son
the same.x. degrees ascending agene by the which the shadue had descended
before. The tha^kesgeuinge which Ezekias ki^ge of Judah write aftyr he had been
sick and was now rekouerd from his sore. I had went yt I should have gone
to my grave in my best days / when I most desyerde the resydue of my age. I
said with my self I shall no more apere before ye lord god in this life. I
shall no more be co^uersante with the mortal men but shall be with ye banesshed
cytesens. My days are foldenvp and taken away fro me like an herdemannis
tente. My life is kutof like y^ weauers web: whylys I provided to live he kut
me of. He made an end of me on a day / I trusted at the least to have lived
unto the morrow / but he alto broke my bones like a lion / and made an end of
me on a day. Then chattred I like a swalowe / and murmured like a Crayne / I
moorned like a dove / lyfti^ge up my eyes unto y^ high god saying. Lord I am
sore handled / deliver me upon thy word. What might I think or what might I
say that he would do this miche for me? That I might yet peruse al my days /
ye although it be to my bitter pain. For I know verily (lord) yt this life
is saulsed with galle / and that my life is subject to all bitter myserye. I
know that thou make me heuye of sleep / and wakenest me agene. But lo / yet
shall I think that thou doste me great pleasure if thou grauntest me these
kareful bitternesses. Here thou stayest my life that it peresshed not whiles
thou castedste al my sins behind thy back. For nether men laid in their
graves praise the / nor yet y^ dead loaue the / nor they that descend into
their graves abide for thy faithfulness. But it is the lyui^ge man / it is the
lyuinge (I say) that prayseth the / even as I do now this day. For the
fathers lay forth thy faithfulness unto their chylderne. Sane us (lord) and
we shall sing ower psalms / all the days of ower life in the house of the
lord. Then commanded Isaye sayng / take the plaster and lay it upon his
botche and he shall amend. And then said Ezekias. Oh what a meruelouse thing
is this that I shall yet asce^de into the house of the lord?

The.xxxix Chapter
AT the same time / Merodach / Baladan y^ son of Baladan and king of Babylon
sent letters and presents unto Ezekias. For he had hard how that he was sick
and amended. And Ezekias was glad of the^ and showed the^ his tresure houses of
his silver and gold / of his rich spyces / and his fined oils and his
preciouse ointments / he showed the^ all the houses of his plate / and what
soever tresure he had.

There was nothing that Ezekie had other in his house / or thorowte al his
realm / but he showed it the^. And then came Isaye y^ prophet unto ki^ge
Ezekias sayng to him. What say these men / or from whense ar they come^ unto
y^? Ezekias answerde him sayng / they arcomon unto me from a far land even
from Babylon. And Isaye said / what have they seen in thy house? Ezekias
answerde / al yt I have in my house have they seen / I have showed them also
all my tresure.

Then said Isaye to Ezekias / hear the word of y^ lord of powers. Behold /
y^ days shall come that what so ever is in thy house / and whatsoever thy
fathers have gathred and laid up in store unto this day / it shall be taken
away and karyed to Babylon / nethr shall therbe any thing left says y^ lord /
ye and certai^e of thy chylderne which shall go forth of the and whom thou shall
begete shall be taken away also / and shall be come gelded men in the king of
Babylons court. And then said Ezekias unto Isaye. The lord turn it to good
that thou have now expressed: but in my days (said he) I beseech y^ lord
that al things might be quiet and suer.

Here begineth of king Cyrus Cha. xl
BE of good chere be of good chere my people (say the yower god). Se that ye
counforte ye hearts of Jerusalem / and tell them of their rest and delyueraunce
from captivity / tell the^ how their sins shall be forgeuen aftyr that they
have received their full chastisinge of the lords hand for all their sins.
Wherefore / there kryeth a voice saying. Prepare ye the way for the lord in
the deserte: and make the paths plain for yower god in the wyldernes: let
every vale be exalted / and every mountain and hyllbe laid low / let kroked
ways be made straight / and rowghe ways smothe. For the gloriouse majesty of
the lord shall appear which every man shall see / for the lord has promised
it. Farthermore the same voice commanded sayng: krye thou. And I asked hi^
what shall I krye? which answerde. That every man is but grass: and all their
gloriouse beutye is like a flower of the field. Grass as soon as it is wythred
/ y^ flower falls a way: And even so the people is but grass / aftyr that
the spirit of the Lord has blown upon them notwithstanding this grass be
witherd and the flower faded / yet abides the word of ower god for ever / yet
this voice commanded agene ^aynge. Go up into the high hill O Zion / which
preachest us good tydi^ges. Lyftvp thy voice as loud as thou may O
Jerusalem which preachest the gospel. Lyftvp thy voice (Isaye) and be not a
frayed / and tell the cytes of Judah saying. Behold / it is yower god / behold
/ the lord almighty shall come with great might / and shall rule by his own
power. Behold / he being clear and noble both in counsel and in his acts /
shall bring forth his riches with great triumph. He shall feade his flock
like an herdman / he shall gather his lamb^^ into his arms and bare the^ in
his besome. But the ewes great with la^be shall he well noureshe. Who has
concluded the waters in his fist and spanned the heavens with his hand / or
has holden up the weight of the wholl earth upon his three fingers? Who wayeth
ye mountayns in a payer of balaunces / and pondreth the hills in a payer of
scoles? Who has informed the mind of ye lord? or who has been of his
counsel to teach him? or of who^ has he fetched his counsel to be taught the
way of judgment to instruct him of any knowledge or to declare him the way
of understanding? Behold / al nations in comparison to him ar but a drope of
a bucket or a bateme^t of a balaunce. The eylandes ar but motes in y^ son
beam All the trees of Libanus are not sufficient to make him a fire: nether all the beasts theryn ar enoughe for his burnt sacrifyces / al nations compared
to him / are (as ye welde say) but nothing / and but a tryful. Unto whom then
will ye lyke^ God? or aftyr what fasshion will ye paynte or karue him? Can any
goldsmyth set forth his Image? or ca^ne he with all his goold and thin silver
plate cast him into any form that may represente him? Shall a keruer for any
ma^nis pleasure that folly shly delyghteth to behold his Image / and have not
wherwithe to make it of gold or silver / chose out a tree i^putrible to
setforthe his Image that cannot move out of his own place? are ye so blind
that ye se not these things. May ye not hear? were not these vngodlinesses
declared you even from y^ beginning? Were ye not moneshed of these things at
the laynge of the foundacio^ of the earth? Sit he not (of whom we now speak)
upon the ronnde world like as upon a balle / and are not we that inhabit it as
little locustes? Stretchethe he not forth the heavens like a cortayne and like a
tente that is fast pitched to be inhabytede?

Does he not bring princes to nothi^ge? and the iuges of the earth to duste /
so that they be never more planted nor sowe^ agene / nor yet their stock roted
in the earth? For a non as he has blown upon them / they are wythred away and
gathred up like the stubble with a whyrlewynde. But to what thing (I pray
you) will you lyken me? or aftyr what fasshion shall I be made / says the
holyon? lift up yower eyes into the sky above / and consider who made these
things which ledeth forth their a raye or apparel into so great a nowmber / of
whom he calls every one by his name.

For by y^ reason of his infinite power strength and might / there is not one of
thesehyd from him. Wherefore then should Jacob think and Israel say. My ways
are hyd from the lord / and my judgment scapeth my god? for is it possible
for the to be ignorant or not to have hard that God is everlasting? The lord
yt made the world labors not nether is he wearye nether is it possible his
wy sedome to be serched out. But he gives strength to the wearye / and hi^ yt
faynteth he restores right well. Chyldern ar weary and almost brethlesse / and
young men utterly falldowne / but to them that wait upon the Lord strength
is encresed / and out of thez shall growforth egles wings / so yt whiles they
run they shall not faynte and whiles they walk they shall not be wearye.

Chapter xl
LEt the eylandes lysten unto me and let the people take good heart unto the^ /

nether be compelled to slip a side into any bypathe? wohathe wroughte / made

of Abraham whom I lone. It was I that brought the from the coostes of the
earth and called the from the far regions thereof saying to the. Thou shalt

shall hold the fast with this same my faithful right hand. Behold as many
as provoke the to anger / shall be confunded and shamed / thy aduersares shall
come to naught and peresshe / so that he that shall seek for them / shall no
where find them. Thy enymes which dare move bataile agenste the shall be
destroyed. For I the lord thy God shall hold fast thy righthande / which
also now say unto the: fear not / for it is I that shall help the: be not a
frayde my little servant Jacob: fear not poor despised Israel / for I shall
help the says the lord / and I that makes holy Israel shall avenge the / ye
I shall trendel the like a wayne and like a neweshode carte to thresshe down

thirstye earth I watr with moist veins. I plant the wild waste ground with
Cedre trees / b^xe / pyne / and olyue trees / and ye dry land with fyr / elm
and plane trees. These things (I tell you) do I / yt men might understand and
knowwe / and yt al togithr might consider depely and expende yt ye hand of ye
lord has done these things and that he that makes holy Israel has created
these things. Stand to your cause therefore (says y^ lord) bring in your
strength says ye king of Jacob / ye let even those gods comeyn and show
you things that have sometime chaunsed and be done of old antiquite. Let the^
(I say) declare) you things to come or expound you things present that we
might ye betr know the^ and hold the^ in mind / I will speak even to your

gods Do good or yet evel / that we might al se and tell it forth. Behold /
year of nothing / and your maki^ge is of nothing: abhominacion has chosen
you. I verily shall stervp one from the north which shall come / and from the
east which shall call upon my name / and he shall come to y^ princes like a

him to be that rightuouson? but there was non that said these things before
or told the^ / nethr have there any man hard the words of thez. Behold
first shall I give Zion and Jerusalem to be evangelists and preachers but as I
remembyr there was not on of these that could se these before to give you

Here may ye se what men these ar al / syche are the deades of men / even sin

Chapter xiij.
Behold therefore / this is my seruante for you / unto who^ I shall cleave: lo

y^ people yt inhabit it / and life to those things yt ar in it / I the Lord
have called ye even for yt rightwysnes sake and led y^ hither even by thy hand
/ wherefore I shall preserve y^ / and give ye for an erneste to y^ people to be
y^ light for the gentyls / to open y^ eyes of the blind / to lead men in
bonds yt sit in derkenes out of custodye and presone / I (I tell you) am he
whose name is y^ LORD which give not my glory to any other creature / nether
yet my praise unto keruen images saying yt al things spoken of before ar come
/ and these new things have I told you before they came. Singe ye therefore
to y^ Lord a new dyte / let his praise rebounde unto y^ farthest coosies of
the earth / praise him ye yt sail on y^ sea and what so evr is in it / praise
him ye eylandis and al yt inhabit thez / the deserte with her cytes / the
towns also with ye dwellers in Cedar might lyftvp their voices. Let the^
reioise yt inhabit y^ high rocks / and from y^ tops of ye mountains let
thez clappe their hands for joy / let thez give y^ for deasmightenes / and
let them declare his worship emonge ye gentiles. For the lord shall comforth
like a valiant waryer and shall krye like a captain standing before his araie
ex horting and animati^g their hearts to battle putting forth his voice and
stretchinge forth al his stre^gthes and power agenste his enymes. Because I have
hither to held my peace / shall I be still and suffereur? nay verily: but I
shall krye rather like a woman traueling of child / I shall destroy and devowr
suddenly / I shall subuerte mountayns and hills / and shall dry up all their
fruit / I shall turn their ryuers into dry land / and their pondes shall I dry
up. I shall led the blind into a way that they yet know not / and direct
thez into a pathe of which they are ignorant / I shall turn ye derkenes in to
light before the^ and ye kroked into an eaven way. These things shall I do for
the^ / nethr will I forsake thez / let them therefore be turned backwarde and be
confounded with shame that trust in karuen images and that say to these cast
Idols: you ar our gods. Hear o ye deffe and lift up your eyes o blind /
for who is blinder then my ^uante? or so deffe as ar my messagers whom I sent
unto the^? Who (I say) ar so blind as the people of the lord and rulers of
the^? They are / as ye would say unto one / thou understand myche but thou
obseruest nothing or as one should hear and believe it not / full prone and
redye verily is ye lord to forgive for his rightwysnes sake to magnifye his
worshipe and his law and to make it excellent and clear / but this people is
for lorne and trodden under foot. Wherefore al their yongemen shall come to ye
rope and be thruste into deep presons. They shall go into proyes and noman
shall be minded to restore the^. Which of you so takes these things to beware
by thez and warned her aftyr? Who delyuereth Jacob to be trodden down / and
Israel into a proye / but the lord? But we verily are they yt commit these
fautes agenst hi^: we are they yt will not go i^ his ways nor obaye his laws.
Wherefore he power the ye wrath of his hevye indignacio^ upon us and grevous
batayls which assail us on every side: but yet we will not repent and amend:
these strong batayls vex us with burninge / but yet we regard him not.

The.xliii. Chap.
ALso thus speaks the lord which has created the O Jacob / and fasshioned
ye o Israel: fear thou not / for I shall redeem ye / I have challenged ye for my
nown self and geve^ ye thy name / yt thou should be mine / so yt when thou
passedste through ye waters I would be with ye / when thou wentest through the
flood esthei overwhelmed the not: when thou wentst through fire / it burned the
not / nethr yet the flame skortched ye: for I am ye lord thy god / and he yt
makes holy Israel / eve^ thy savior: I redeemed ye out of Egypt / the
Ethiopes and Sabeo^s I destroyed to save ye / because thou waste so preciouse
in my eyes and I setted so myche by ye and loved y^ so interely. I spent away
what so ever nacio^ or people they were for thy plesur and sauegarde / to
thente^t thou shuldst not fear / but yt I would be of thy side from ye east
shall I bring hithr thy seade and gathr y^ from ye weste / I shall say to ye
north / geve forth my people / and to ye sowthe / let thez not to come to me:
ye and yet farthermor / I shall bri^ge forth my sons from far lands / and
my daughters from ye coostes of ye world yt is to say every man mamed aftyr
me for hi^ have I created fashioned and made for myglorye: bring me forth
people / as well ye bli^de as the^ yt can se / as well ye deffe as they yt hear
/ let al nations / ge^tyls and iuwes be gatherd togithr and brought in to one.
Which of al these gods could tell us these things and have showed us the^ to
come? let the^ bring forth their witnesses and go quyte: for they yt shall hear
the^ / shall report yt at just is and trwe. Eve^ I me self (says ye lord)
take you to witnesses which are my chosen because your own co^scienses teach
you and eve^ y^ very self thing co^strayneth ye trowthe to be ascribed unto
me / so y^ ye now understand clearly yt I am he which have nethr pear before
me nor any match aftyr me / yt I am eve^ ye lord alone and yt be sides me
there is no savior / I warn / I save / I teach because ye should receive no
nothr. ye / I appele unto your own co^scienses to be my witneses (says ye
lord) ye I am god / and y^ I am he yt is from ye beginning of ye time / nethr
is there any yt may take any thing fro my hand / or un make yt at I make or
do. Thus therefore says y^ lord your redemer ye maker holy of Israel. For your
punishment shall I send unto Babylon and shall call to thez al their power / that
is to say ye power of yt Chaldes whose glory stands in practizinge of war
/ I am (I say) ye lord your holy makr / ye maker and king of Israel:
Farthermore thus said the lord which laid forth y^ way through ye sea and.
y^ pathe through great waters bringi^g forth chariets and horsemen / and hosts
with great power to lay the^ so a sleep al to githr yt they should no more rise
/ ye to quench the^ out like ye snyffe of a candel. Because ye ar evel
rememberers of old things and have no understanding of things paste / behold
/ therefore I shall make a new thing which shall flowresshe forth evyn by and by:
and will ye know it? I told you it before / and now shall I tell it you agene /
I shall lay forth away in y^ deserte and in ye flowdes. In ye wyldernes wild
beasts shall honor me / dragons and struthions shall knowledge me / I shall give
waters in ye deserts and flowdes in the wyldernes to give dri^ke to my chosen
people / even to this people which I have fashyoned fore my self to declare my
praise / for as for thou (Jacob) thou would not call upon me / and thou
disdaynedst me o Israel: for thou offredst not to me beasts into brent
sacrifices / nethr honouredst me with thy oblacions / thou boughtste me no
preciouse fragraunte spice with thy money / nethr with thy fat sacrifices dydst
thou embrue me / although I did not require siche sacrifices of y^: nethr
would I charge ye with incense and fume. But thou madeste me thy ^ua^te to bare
thy sins and thrustedste medowne lade^ with thy iniquites: when it is I only yt
do away thy vngodlynesses for my nown selfs sake / and thy sins do I forget
/ put me i^ remembrance and let us reason togithr / and show me yt thing
whereby thou trustest to be forgeuen and justified: as for ye first man thy
fathr / is first and formest a sinner: and thy intercessours between ye and me
have sinned agenst me / wherefore eve^ ye most holiest rulers have I slain /
eve^ jacob did I kyl and israel did I betake into blasphemye.

The.xliiij. Cha.
NOw therefore hear o jacob my ^ua^te / and israel my chosen / for thus spoke ye
lord which has made and fashioned ye / and has been thy help eve^ from thy
mothers womb / let it not grieve ye (my ^ua^t jacob and my very right israel
who^ I have chosen) because I will powerforth watr upon ye thirstye earth / and
flowdes upon ye dry land: I shall powerforth (I tell ye) my spyrit upon thy
seade and my graciouse blessinge upon thy issue / and they shall flouresh
mingled with you like ye grass and like ye oysyers by ye ryuersydes / one shall
say / I am named for ye lords own / and a another shall be named aftyr jacob /
and a another shall write with his own hand his name aftyr ye lords name and
shall be named aftyr israel. Thus (I say) spoke ye lord / ki^ge of Israel and
thy redemer / ye lord of powrs: I am the first and I am ye last / and besides
me is there no god / who has at any time be lyk me sith I am of everlasting?
name and show me i^ what on thing he might be compared to me? if there be any /
let the^ show things paste and to cu^ as I have done and yt with out fear
fault and stop / do not I eue^ of evrlasti^g declare and tell you? of which
thing I bri^ge you forth as my witnesses / is there any god besides me? is
there any shapr yt I know not? full vain therefore ar al thief facioners of images
/ and full unprofitable ar their study and labor / for they testify of their
own selves (sith their images nethr se nor yet have any other sense) well
worthy to be confounded and shamed. who then may sashion god? or who will cast
an image profitable for nothing? whr for all this felau shipe of image makers
may well be ashamed / let al men cu^ togithr before me / ye give me her al manner
smythes keruers with sich othr / and I shall make the^ togithr a like shamed and
astonned the smythe takes the yerne i^ his to^ges he tameth it in ye fire and
facioneth it with his hamer / ye and yt with al ye might of his arms / and
sometime he faynteth for honger and works so long with out drink yt he
falls down weary. Then comes ye carpentour and he draws forth a line upon
ye tymbr and smyteth it forth with chalk / he squareth he co^passeth / he
cleanses and karueth it until his work be like a man / ye like a well
proporcioned man to have his seat in the temple / he gets him (I say) to
ye wode to kutdowne Ceders to karye home ye hard pyne trees / oaks / and siche
othr trees of the wode / orels siche as he had set at home as some pyne trees
who^ the rain made to wexe which me^ use to kutdowne to the fire / he goth and
takes some of these to warm him with al / and with some he heateth his oouen to
bake in his bread / ye and of some of these trees he makethe him even a god and
worshipethe it / he makes him a karuen image and fallethe down before it:
with part of it he makethe his fire / with part he seethe or rosteth his
flesh and eat it when he has done and so is well satisfied: with part of it
he is well warmed / so that he now may say / the world is well amended / I
am well warm / I have been at the fire / and the rest of this timber he
karueth into a god and into an idol for him self / before this he falls
down / this he worshippeth / unto this he makes his vow / of this he ask
the his peticions / and prays sayng / deliver me for thou art my god And yet
these images have nether sense nor understanding: for they are so dawbedouer
that they nethr se with their eyes nor understand with their hearts. There is
noman that so comes agene to him self thinkinge theys images ar nether endued
with any of the.v. senses nor yet with understanding nor yet co^ syderth thus
/ part of this image have I burnte and upon the colles of it have I soden and
broyled my meat and eaten it / wherefore then of the rest of it should I make
me so abominable an Idolle and thus fall down before so roten a stock? vain
idleness and a folysshe heart has brought them unto this Idolatrye / and so
perverted them that non has his right mind or may thus think of him self:
may not I err / although I apere to my nowne self to do right well?
Remember well these things Jacob and Israel / for thou art my seruante who^ I
have fashioned to thentente that thou should be my serua^te never to be out
of my mind O Israel: I do a way thy iniquites even as I disperse a cloud /
and thy sins take I away like a myste. Turn the therefore unto me / for I
will deliver the. Beglad ye heavens whom the lord has made / rejoice ye
foundacions of the earth / clappe yowr hands ye mountayns / make merry wodes
with almaner trees / for the lord will redeem Jacob and upon Israel will he
sprede his glory: for thus spoke ye lord thy defender which has fashioned ye
eue^ from thy mothers womb / I am the Lord which al a lone makes althi^ges
which a lone have stretched forth ye heavens / which alone have set fast ye
earth. I skater the signs of these sothe sayers or astrominers / so yt they
shall divine i^ vain and be mad for anger / I turn these wysemen bakwarde
and bring their coni^g into foleshnes. But I ster up ye mind and ente^te of my
servant and the counsel or thoughts of my messagers I accomplesshe sai^g unto
Jerusalem / be thou restored i^to thy old state / and to the cytes of Judah /
be ye builded agene. It is I yt restore desolate places. I command ye deep
waters sayng / be ye dry / and her ryuers I dry up. It is I that say unto
Cyrus / he is my herd man / al things shall I acco^plesshe according to my will
/ it is I yt say unto Ierusalez / be thou builded agene / and to the temple /
let thy foundation be laid agene.

The.xlv. Chapter
THus (I say) spoke the lord unto his anointed Cyrus / whose right hand
(says he) I have taken that the ge^tles should fast down before hi^. I shall
turn their kings out of their armoure so that at his comi^ge they shall opene
their gates and shyt the^ no more: I shall go before the / I shall make eaven ye
roughe ways / brazen gates shall I break and bars of yerne shall I shake in
sondre: I shall give the tresure lyinge yet in derkenes and things which are yet
hyd preuely that thou might know that I the lord god of Israel have called
ye bename for my seruante Jacob and Israel my chosen: I have called the be thy
name and beutifyed the when as yet thou knew me not: I am the Lord /
besides whom there is no god: I gyrte the forth ward when as yet thou knewst
me not that men should know fro^e east to weste that with out me al things
are naught / and that it is I that am the Lord and no another / I fashione the
light and create derkenes / I make peace and bring forth trouble: It is I the
lord that does al these things. Heaven shall give down dew from a bone /
and the clouds shall rain down rightwylnes / y^ ertheshalbe opened and
bringeforth the sauyower: Ryghtwysnes also shall bud forth with him. Even I the
lord shall create this thing. Woe be to him that disputes with his makr / even
the potsherde with ye potter: shall the claye say to the potter / what thing
make thou? or thy work ^ueth to no use? Woe be to him that says to the
father wherefore will thou get chylderne? and to the mother wherefore will thou
bring forth fruit? Thus says ye lord that makes holy Israel and his maker
also. Ask me things to come upon my chylderne / and bid me tell you of the
works of my hands. I made therthe and created man there upon / I stretched the
heavens with my hands / and al her mighty host or beutyful aperel are at my
commandment. I shall stervp this king Cyrus with rightwysnes and al his ways
shall I direct: He shall edyfe my cite and let lose my captivity and that
persuaded nether by money nor mede says the lord of powers. Farthermore thus
said ye lord / the marchantes of Egipte of Ethiope / and the tributaryes of
Sabe shall come to the and shall be thine / they shall follow the / they shalgo in
gyves of their fete / they shall knefe before the and make their supplicacio^
and prayer unto the: for verily god is with the besides who^ there is no god /
how profounde and how depely hyd art thou o god eve^ the god and sauiowr of
Israel? let the^ beshamed confounded and go their ways togithr with ignomynye
al theys worshipers of Idols but Israel shall be saved in the lord with a
perpetual health: They shalnot be shamed ne noted with ignomynye for evermor / for
thus said the lord that created heavens eve^ god that fashioned therthe he
made and prepared it: I have not made it in vain / but to be inhabited / I am
the lord besides who^ their is none. Nethr have I spoken in hyd places nor in
any derke korner of the earth. Nethr in vain said I to the sead of Jacob seek
me. For I am ye lord speakinge that at just is and showing that at right is:
let them be gatherd to gither and come / let the the other nation escaped that is
to say the gentyles come also unto me. What understanding have they that fyft
up an image of tree and so pray to a god that cannot save them? Let them come
to me (I say) and let them agree in one and tell me who has showed them these
things before or who expownded thez first? Did not I the Lord besides whom
there is no god? It is I that am the rightwyse god and sauiowr besides whom
there is non Beturned therefore to me all the costs of the earth and ye shall be
saved / for I am god and there is no nothr. I swear be my self that rightwysnes
shalgoforth of my mouth / and my word returns not i^ vain / but every knee
shall be bowed unto me and every tongue shall swear and say: In ye lord stands
my rightwysnes and strength / unto him shall men come / but they shall be
confounded as many as speak agenst him. And all the sead of Israel shall be
justified and have their pleasure in the lord. Bell shall be broken down / and
Nebo shall have a fall / with whose heavy images ye poor beasts shall be laden
and weryed with their grevous wayght / these beasts with other bearets of
these stocks shall faldowne vndr their burdens / for they may not cast them of
/ and thus shall they be karyed into captyuite.

The.xlvi. Chap.
Hear me Jacobs famylye and all the reamnaunte escaped of the house of Israel /
whom I took even from their mothers womb and have borne the^ from their
byrthe^ ye and shall bare the^ unto their old age and in their bederethye / for
sithe I have made the^ / I shall also bear the^ / help the^ and deliver them.
To who^ (I pray you) will you lay me / lyken me / or compare me? Who^ am I
like? will you then (vain liars) go and way yowr gold or silver out of yowr
purse at a payer of seoles and hyer you a caster of metal to make ye a God
thereof for men to faldowne before it and so to worship it? which
notwithstanding yet must be laid on mennis shulders / be borne and se in his
place to stand fast and cannot mo^ se from his place: farther more let men
krye unto it and yet may it not answer nethr deliver them from their
anguysshe and trouble. Consider this and look upon yowr selves o brekers of
gods commandments and turn to a better mind / call to mind old things
done from ye creacio^ of the world that ye may se that I am god and that
there is no mothr god nethr any thing like me / which from the begi^ni^ge
show the last things and even from the creacion tell you things which are
not yet done: My counsel stands at a word and so do I acco^plesshe all my
plesures / I call a swyfte bird from the east and what so ever I wysdo from a
far it shall be done at a belt / for as soon as I se it / it is done. Hear me
ye proud me^ in heart and far from the rightwysnnes. I shall bring nighe my
rightwisnes nether shall it be absent / and my health shall not tarry / I shall
give a sauinge health to Zion / and my beutyful glory to Israel.

The.xlvij. Chapter
But thou shall godowne and sit in y^ duste O virgen the daughter of Babylon /
thou shall sit on ye ground and not in thy kings sete o daugher of the
Chaldes: thou shall no more be called tender and dylicate. Thou shall go take
the querne sweape / and griude out the flower of the corn. Thou shall cast of
thy preciouse tire and bonettes / thy shulders shall be naked and bare legged
shall thou wade through y^ brokes / thou shall not have one bratte on thy narse
and men shall se thy secrets to thy great shame. For I will take vengeance and
wilnot be entreded. These things has owr redemer spoken whose name is y^ for

still / go thy ways into some derke place for thou shall no more be called ye
lady of realms: I was verily so angrye with my people / y^ I scourged my
heretage and betoke the^ into thy power / and thou had no pity on the^ but
oppressedst ev^ their sage men with thy hevye yoke above mesure thi^ki^ge thus:
I shall be a lady for ever / but thou consyderdste not these things in thy
heart nether reme^bredst things to come: wherefore hear now these things O
Delicate lady which sit so suer and thus think with thy self. I am
lady a lone and besides me is there none / I shall not sit like a wedue
moorni^ge nor yet be destitute my chylderne. But yet shall these two things
that is to say to sit housband less and chylderlesse fall suddenly upon the
both on a day / they shall fall (I say) on ye to fynishe thy sorrow / both
for so great multitude of thy inchaunti^ge sothe sayers / and also for the
strength of thy so many helpers. For thou trustedst in thy nowne couetuou se
wylynes saying. No man sees me. Thy nowne wisdom and knowledge deceived the /
for thus presumedste thou in thy heart saying: I am lady a lone and besides me
there is no^. Sorrowful affliccio^ therefore shalco^e upon ye and fro^e when se it
shall spri^g thou shal't not know / and mi^able calamite unable to be a voyded
shall fall upon the. There shall come upon the unawares a soden subuersio^ / and
then (I pray the) flee to thy helpers and to thy ench aunti^ge soth sayers of
who^ thou haste great plentye / whom also thou have set myche by and have had
the^ in great reputacio^ even fro^e thy kradle / stand unto these (I say) and
look wheter paraue^ture thou maiste be helped and conforted of the^? for thou
have occupied thy self and weared thy self hitherto in their manyfolde
counsels: let these heauengasers and starrestarers (I pray ye) comeforth and
help y^ / and tell the from whence these news ar to come and fall upon ye.
Behold / they shall be like stubble / which aftyr it be set a fire noman may
help it / which stubble nethr is it profitable to make coals to warm ye / nor
yet to make a fire to abide by: Sychons (I tell the) shall these men be who^ thou
haste somyche set by and occupied and wearyed thy self with even from thy
yougthe / for every one of these aftyr his profession shall deceive ye / and in
ye mean ceason there shall not be one left ye may save ye.

Chap. xlviij
Hear these thi^geeye house of Jacob whose toname is called Israel / which
also ar come of ye same stock ye Judah came of which also swear by ye name of
the Lord testifye / affirm / and give thanks / and al by ye god of Israel /
ye although ye do it not of faith aid rightwysnes: which arenamed aftyr the
cytesens of ye holy cite which trust unto the god of Israel ye forde of
powers. Have I not don ethese things out of hand? ar they not nows fulfilled
which I told you of eue^ from ye begi^ni^g when they went out of my mouth
and I expounded the^ to you? Notwithsta^di^g I know full well y^ thou art hard
and how srefnecked and vnsha^faced thou art yet have I told and declared to
ye fro^e the begi^ni^ge things before they were done lest (I tell the) thou
should say. My idol told me these or my karue^ or cast images commanded
these things. Consider and behold al these whether you have prophesied the^ /
and whether it was not I that told you before certain news and secrets
which thou knew not of. And now I have created some a new of ye which
nether from ye beginni^ge nor yet now before the day of their creacion have
ye hard / because ye should not tell them: Lo it was I y^ knew the^ before /
farthermore I told you of some things which nether have ye hard nor known
before / nor never before were opened unto thy ears. For I knew that thou
should be a breker of my commandments / for even from thy mothers womb
have thou be called a transgerssour / notwithstondinge yet for my names sake I
differred my wrath / and for my nowne glory I defended ye yt thou should
not perysshe: For so it is I that pourged the / not for thy money / but at thy
most need I chose ye. For my nowne sake (I tell ye) have I done this / for I
give not my glory to any wother lest thou shuldst in any wise be profaned
and cast fro me: hear me Jacob and israel whom I have called. I am he that
has his being of him self / I am the lyrste and I am the fast. My hands
have laid y^ foundacions of the earth / and my rigthande has set fast the
heavens / when I called them anon they stood still. Be ye all therefore gatherd
together and hear / which of these gods has told you these things which
the lord has done by the king of Babylon and Chalde by whom he does his
pleasure and uses them to execute his power? It is Ialone that told you these
things before / and I only shall call and bri^ge him fort and make prosperouse
his iourneye. Come (I say) unto me / and hear this thing / have I ever yet
spoken any thing obscurely from y^ creacio^ of y^ world which am present and
eue^ i^ ye same article when al thing was made? For this cause therefore y^
lord god and his spirit sent me / and thus speaks ye lord thy redemr ye
maker holy of Israel / it is I y^ am ye lord thy god teachi^g y^ y^ shall
profit ye / directi^ge y^ in y^ way wheri^ thou shall go. And if thou
obssueste my precepts thy peace and rest shall swi^me like a floude and thy
rightwisnes shall arise like y^ waves of the sea. Thy sead shall be like ye sands
/ and the fruit of thy body like her grauel stones. Thy name shall not be cut
of nor yet banesshed from my syghte / ye shall goforthe of Babylon / ye shall
slipawaye from y^ Chaldeys with a ioyeful voice / which thing shall be told
showed / and preached unto ye vttermoste coostes of ye earth and it shall be
said. The lord has redeemed his serua^te Jacob so y^ they thirsted not when
they went through ye dry wilderness / for he drew the^ watr out of ye stone
/ he claue ye great rock and there flowed out watrs / but to y^ ungodly says
ye lord: there is no rest ne peace Of Messiah which is christ.

HEar me eyla^dis and ye people al a far take heed / ye lord has called me
fro my birth and fromy mothers womb he publesshed my name / he has made me a
mouth like a sharp sword / he has koverde and defended me with the shadue
ofhis hand / and hid me as a chosen shafte in his quyuer: he said to me /
verily Israel yet art thou my ^ua^t in who^ I will be gloriously deelared: and I
answerde / I shall labor i^ vayn and spend my strength with out fruit /
notwithstanding yet shall I offer my cause unto ye lord / and my diligent
labor to my god: Wherefore ye lord spoke which fashioned me his ^ua^te fro my
mothers womb to bring Jacob agene unto hi^ (ye although ye time should come
yt he will not be gathred to him) in whose eyes I am great which is my god and my
strength / and he said: It is no great thing for ye to be my ^uante to stervp
y^ trybes of Jacob and to restore ye destruccio^ of Israel / except I make y^
also ye light of ye ge^tyls to be y^ sauinge health sent fro me to ye
vttermoste coostes of therthe. Thus spoke y^ lord y^ redemer and makr holy of
Israel upon Christ conte^ned and despised of ye ge^tyls and ^uante to al y^
bare rule. Kings and princes shall se and rise up to worshipe for y^ lords
sake / for he is faithful / and for his sake yt makes holy Israel which has
chosen y^ o Messiah / and agene thus spoke ye Lord / in the time appointed shall
I come and be present with the and in the article of thy health I shall help y^
and save ye / and I shall give the into an erneste of ye promise tomy people to
restore therthe y^ thou myghtste challenge agene ye dispersed he retages and
say to the^ in bonds / go your ways out / and to the^ y^ ar in derknes:
comeforth into ye light / ye they might feade by y^ woye sides and take their
plesures in all their plentuo^se pastures / they shall not honger nor thirste /
y^ heat of y^ son shall not smite the^ / for their goyde shall tender and keep
thez ientely and shall give them drink at the veins of waters / I shall make
all my hills plain and ready ways / and my paths shall apere trodden for every
man. Behold for there shall come some from a far / some from the north and
from the sea / and some from the sowthe. Beglad heavens / rejoice earth / clap
your hands hills for joy: for the lord shall conforte his people and have
mercy on his poor afflicte. But here parauenture Zion will say: The lord
has forsaken me / and the lord has forgoten me: Shall the woman forgete her
young child borne of her own body? but if she forgete her child / yet shall
I never forgete the: for so / I have printed the in these my hands / thy
walls shall never fall fro my mind they yt casted the down shall come as fast
to build the agene / they yt destroyde the shall have continual course and
recourse unto the / lift up thy eyes and look about and see / al these gentyls

shall thou be or ned and arrayed with the^ as with a rich ornament and aparel /
even like a bryde decked in her clean costely array / for thy land which
lies desolate / wasted and lost / shall even by and by be to little to co^tayne
thinhabitours theryn / and they yt would devowr y^ shall be far baneshed / then
shall thy childern born i^ thy barenes speak to y^ / sayng: this place is to
narowe / let me have a place to sit i^ / and thus shall thou think: who has
begote^ me these childern since I am baren and a banesshed divorced wedue? who
has nouresshed and brought me up these chyldern? behold / I am sole and
forsaken / of whence then ar these? Thus therefore answers ye lord god: behold
/ I shall stretch forth myha^d to ye ge^tils / and to yt populose nacio^ shall I
lyftvp my sign and they shall bri^ge sons to the in their bosoms / and
daughters upon their shulderne shall they bri^ge y^ / and their kings shall feed
y^ and their queen's shall be thy nourses / they (their faces bowed down to
therthe) shall reverence y^ and lick of y^ duste from thy fete / and thou shall
know y^ I am y^ lord in whom who so evr trusts they are not confounded. Who
may take y^ proye from y^ strong / or ye captyue from ye mighty? but because
ye lord has so spoken it / both ye captyue shall be taken from ye mighty and
ye proye from ye strong / for I will defend thy cause against thy aduersarye
and save thy chyldern / thy enemes shall I feed with their own flessh / and with
their own blood shall they be dro^ke^ like as with sweet wine / by y^ which
ve^geaunce every flessh shall se yt I am ye lord thy savior and thy mighty
redemer o Jacob.

Thus says ye lord. Where is this testimonial of ye divorce of your mothr

your mothr divorced and put away / wherefore would noma^ receive me when I came
/ nor yet answer when I called? was my hand so cutof and shortened yt it might
not deliver you? or was my power so my neshed yt it was not able to redeem you?
which by a word only dry up ye sea and turn ye floudes into dry land / so
yt their fysshes be corrupt for want of watr and perisshe for thyrste / it is
I yt clothe ye heavens in a black moorning cloud and kour the^ with sak / the

and wakened me as my masters were wont to do to make me lysten and take heed /
it was y^ lord god yt opened mine ear / how then could I not but obaye? or
how could I avoid or slyppe bak? Wherefore I offere my back to the smyters
and my chekes to the twitchers / my face I turn not away from rebukes and
spetel / for y^ lord god brings me help / wherefore I shall not be confounded
/ but I set my face agenste them as hard as a flynte / for I know well yt I
shall not be shamed / for I have my defendr by me to deliver me: who then may
strive agenste me? Let us go and stand together before a judge / and if any man
will contend with me in judgment / let him come hither. Behold / the lord
god has taken up my cause to defend it / who then shall condemn me? lo / al
these thy Idols and gods shall be worn out like a garment / worms shall eat

he shall not ons fall by ye way whereby he may be hyndred to destroy nether

I shall put my words into thy mouth / and shall cast up my hand before y^ for

the^ shall know no peace / wherefore fulfarre is eqite exyled from us and
rightwisnes will not come nighe us: we looked and tarried for light / and lo what
derkenes is there? we waited for ye morninge / but lo we walk i^ ye derke mydde
night we go gropi^g by ye walls like bli^de me^ we grope as though owr eyes
were putoute / we sto^ble at none days as though we wa^dred i^ ye derke
morninge like old me^ half deed sto^bli^ge at their graves: we groan like
bears and morn continually like douves: we look for eqite but she appears no
where / we tarry for health but it is very far from us / and that because owr
wikednes is so encresed before ye and yt we are so synful / for our
transgressions we deny not / and our sins we knowledge / that is to say we
are sinners we are false liars agenst ye lord / we have forsaken our god / and
turned our backs to him / we have blasphemed him / and followed strange gods
/ we have conceived euel in our hearts and occupied our minds about false
words and deades. Wherefore equite has forsaken us and rightwisnes stands al
a far moornynge^ for trwthe is fallen down in the streutes and equity is
locked up / ye truth is cruelly handled / and he yt forsakes euel is torn in
peses / these things when the lord saw / he was not content yt there was no
equite / and he saw yt there was non yt would make intercession and it beruwed
him / and he turned hi^ self unto his own power / and cleued to his
rightwisnes / and a non he did upon him self rightwysnes as a cote of mayle
and put health upon his head instead of anhelmet / he did upon hi^ vengeance
for his vesture and kouerd him self with indignacion lyk as with a cloak / and
there was siche hatrede as is w^nt to be between two enimes revenging either
other / this armed he hi^ self to reward ye cruel tyraunts / wherefore they
shall fear ye name of ye lord from y^ weste and his majesty from ye east /
for he shall cu^ like a violent floude which the lord has steredvp with a
wind: but unto Zion and the^ which being of ye seade of Jacob repent the^
self and turn from their wikednes he shall cu^ a redemr says y^ lord. For I
me self says y^ lord shall make this conuenaunte and promise with the^ yt is
to say. My sprite with who^ I shall instruct y^ / and my wordis which I shall put
into thy mouth shall not fall from thy mouth nethr from the mouths of thy
childerne / nor from ye mouth of their childers chylderne here after into
everlasting says the lord.

The son shall no more be thy seruante to ministre to the light be day nether

The spirit of the lord god is with me / for ye lord has anoi^ted me and

excellent in rightwisnes / and a budde new spronge out to magnifye ye lord /
yt they might restore places desolate / occupye old forlaten houses / and

aliauntes might stand and feade your flockis and strangers be your tylmen
and vyneplanters / and yt you might be called yt prestes of ye lord / and yt
men might call you ye ministers of our god / y^ you might eat the substance
of the ge^tils and take your plesurs of their abundance for your great
confusion and ignomynye / they shall rejoice to have like perte with you / to
deuyde the rich heretage in their land / yt they might have gladness for a

like ye bride rychely apparelde in her ornaments / for like as there the

make rightwysnes and godly worshipe spring forth before al nations.

The.lxij. Chapter
Wherefore / for Zio^s sake I shall not rest / and for Ierusalems pleasure I shall
not cease until her rightwisnes be comforth and showed like ye shyning light
and her sauinge health brenneth like a laumpe. For ye gentyls shall se thy
rightwysnes and al kings shall behold thy glory / and shall call ye be a new
name which ye mouth of ye lord shall declare / and thou shall be like a
beutiful crown in ye hand of ye lord / and as a kings dyademe in ye hand
of thy god: thou shall no more be called ye forsaken / nethr shall thy land be
called enymore ye desolated / But thou shaltbe called Hephziba that is to say
my best beloved / and thy land shall be called Beula that is to say my wedded
wife. For the lord is anambred on the / and thy land shall be married to him thy
very housbonde / and as ye yongman marieth to him a maiden / s^ shall thy
chylderne be married unto the lord / and as ye brydegrome is ioyouse over the
bryde even so shall thy god be ioyouse upon the. Upon thy walls O Ierusalez /
shall I set watch men which shalnot cease day nor night preachinge the
lord. Farthermore / even you yt are of the comen people shalnot cease in
nomanr wise until Jerusalem be repayerde and till she be made the most praise
worthy in all the earth. The lord has sworn by his righthande and by the
strength of his arm that he will no more give thy whete i^to meat for thy
enymes / ne thr thy sweet wine for the which thou haste sore swette into dri^ke
for strange chylderne: but they yt gather it shall eat it also / and give
thanks to the lord: and they yt gathr it togithr shall dri^ke it also in ye
porches of my sanctuarye. Stand abacke and get ye a side which stand i^ ye
gates / give rome o prople prepare ye way / and take away al fto^bli^ge
stones / and setvp a sign for ye people: for behold the lord tells forth
these good tydi^ges unto ye vttermoste parts of the earth. Say ye daughters
unto Zion: behold thy Sauiowr is come. Behold he has brought with him his
riches / and his noble acts go before him and they y^ shall be redeemed of the
Lord shall be called the holy people / and even thou shall be called the
gretely haunted populose cite and thou shall no more be called the forsaken.

The.lxiij. Chap.
THen shall it be said: who is this yt comes from Edom / his clothes thus dyed
with ye red of Bozra? who is this yt goth so myghtely / so co^ely in his cote
armoure? I am he (I tell you) that warnethe and speaks rightwysnes and am
rich to save. wherefore then ar thy garments so red and thy clothes so wette as
though thou had trodden in ye wine press? The wine press (I tell you) have
I trodden al alone / and of all the people was there not one with me: I trod / I
trod down my enymes in my fervent wrath so yt they have thus sprinkled my
clothes with their blood and have thus spotted al my garments. For ye day of
vengeance which I had conceived in my heart and ye year wheryn I would redeem
is to^e. I looked round about / but there was not one helper / I was destitute
al hope / but there was not one that would sustain me: and then cleued I to my
nowne arm and feruoure which helpte me / and then I trod down the people in
my wrath and bathed them so in my furye that their blood ran down upon the
earth: The mercyes of ye lord I shall remenbre and give him thanks for all
things which he has give us / y^ is to say for the i^numerable goodness done
to the house of Israel / which of his mercy and goodness has given it the^ /
for he said / verily these men shall be my people / and these shall be ye chylderne
which shall not go out of kind For he was their Savior / and brought it so
pass that in all their tribulucion he would not suffer them to bescourged / but
would deliver the^ by his angel who^ he sent thez. And because he loved and
pytyed thez / he redeemed / he defended and bore the^ up from the beginni^ge of
ye time: but although they so rebelled and chafed his holy mind that he would
be turned into their enemy and fight against the^ yet he remembered the time
paste / he remembered even Moses and his people how that he led the^ out from
the sea like as the shepherde leads his flock / and how he gave the^ his
holy ghost / he remembered how he led Moses by his gloryouse arm / taking him
by the right hand and diuidi^ge the waters before the^ to get him self a name
for ever / he remembered how he led the^ through the depthe and through the
deserte like as by an even and plain way / that they stombled not / for the
spirit of the lord directed them like the beasts yt go in the field. So
leddest thou thy people O god / to get the a gloriouse name. Lokeforth
therefore fro^e heaven and from the holy habitacion of thy majesty and behold
/ how is it thus cu^ to pass / that thy zele / thy stre^gthe / thy plentuouse
intere petye and soste mercy ar so hardened agenste me? Thou art owr father.
Abraham knows not us nethr Israel knows us: but it is thou lord that art
owr father and redemr / thy name is of ever. Wherefore (lord) haste thou led us
fro^e thy ways? haste thou hardened owr hearts yt we should not fear the?
bri^ge us agene into thy favor for thy promyses sakes made to thy servants
which are of the trybs of thy heretage. It was not long that thy holy people
enjoyed thy sanctuary / for our enymes destroyed and spoylde it / and as for
us we have been thy people even from the begi^ni^ge of ye world / but as for
the^ they knew the not for their god / nethr were thy called aftyr thy name.

The.lxiiij. Chapi.
I Would thou would cleve insondre heaven and come down that the hills
might melte away at thy presens even as agenst an hot fire and that the
violent tyra^ts might be set a fire as is water inflammedde with fire: that
thy name might be known unto thy enymes / and these haithen might tremble at
thy presens. Descend (I say) with thy woundreful and vnwonte works unlooked
fore that these hills might consume in thy syghte: For from al times paste
there was noman that would hear or take heed / nether behold with his eyes
these things which thou haste done for men waytinge for the: but thou a lone
(O god) thou helpest him that boldly follows rightwysnes / and socourste them
that depend on the to go in thy ways. But lo / thou art now angrye because
we are sinners and continue still in ower sins and there is not one salfe /
for we are all like an unclean thing and all ower rightwisnesses are like
clothes polluted with menstrwe / all we fall like leaves / for ower iniquites
take us away like ye wind / there is no^ that will call upon thy name or
endeuer him self to hold the / wherefore thou hydest thy face from us and
scourgest us for ower wykednes. Now therefore when it is so that thou art ower
father / and we are but claye: thou art unto us as a potter and all we are the
works of thy hand. Be not so sore angrye (Lord I beseech the) nether
remember owr iniquites always / but rathr (I pray the) consider al us to be
thy people. Boholde / the cytes of thy holy land are turned into a wyldernes.
Zio^ is forsaken / ye and even Jerusalem is a deserte / owr holy temple which
was ower beutyful flower whereyn owr fathers praised the is brentvp / and all
ower plesaunte places are turned into wyldernesses. Wylt thou not (Lord) aftyr
all these things be entreted and bowed with prayer? will thou be still and
scourge us so grevouslye?

The.lxv. Chap.
MEn shall seek me which now seek me not / they shall find me y^ now seek me
not / unto whom I shall say anon / lo / lo / I am here at yowr hand / thus
shall it be said upon these gentyles which yet call not on my name: for I have
stretched forth my hands all this time paste unto a nation that believed not
which goithe not the right way ye is to say lives not aftyr my mind and
plesures / which also neur ceasseth to exasperat and to anger me eue^ to my
face offeringe their offeringes in groves and wodes and bre^ni^ge their incense
upon alters made of stone / they sit prayi^ge at tombs and shrynes / sleapi^ge
al ye night in chyrches full of images / they eat hogs flesh and unclean
potage is in their ^^^hes: they say / if thou co^est nighe the^ touch me not
lest I make y^ unclean / these me^ shall smoke at my wrath and be set a fyr to
brene for eur. Behold / these things ar decreed in my presens y^ I should not
forgete the^ but give you your reward whr for I shall lay yor wykednes and ye
wikednes also of your fathrs i^ your own bosoms (says ye lord) which bre^te
their sacrifices upon mu^tai^s and blasphemed me in ye hills: whr for I shall
meat out their iniq^tes age^ and turn the^ into their own bosoms. thus says
ye lord / as me^ will say to hi^ ye happens on an holy vine: pluk no grapis
of this / for it is holy: eve^ so shall I do for my ^ua^ts sakes because I would
not destroy the^ al: but I shall bri^gforth a sede out of Jacob and
thinheretour of my hyl out of Judah / y^ is to say my chosen shall possess it
and my ministers shall dwell there: sarone shall be filled with flockis and heardes /
and ye vale of Achor shall be layers for herdes of my people yt seek me but you
have betrayed ye lord and forgote^ my holy hyl / you garnesshed an altr for ye
gods of Fortune / and consecrated your offeri^g to ye god of tresur / I shall
therefore keep you i^ stor as tresur for ye sword / ye you might al be smitdown
with it because yt when I called you / ye would not answer / and when I spoke /
ye would not hear / but ye did evel i^ my sight and chosed those thigis which I
hated. Whr for thus speaks ye lord. Lo my ^ua^ts shall eat / when ye shall be
full ho^grye. behold my ^ua^ts shall drink / when ye shall be full thirsty: behold
my ^ua^ts shall be glad when ye shall be ashamed. Lo / my ^ua^ts shall rejoice and
singe eve^ for ye very health of their hartis but you shalkrye out for ye very
sorrow of your hearts and for anguysh of mind: ye shall houle as hou^dis / your
name shall not be swornby among my chosen: for ye lord shall slaye you / and call
his ^ua^ts by a nothr name. He yt shall be praised in ye earth let hi^ be praised
in ye true god / and he yt shall swer in ye earth let hi^ swer by ye true lord
for old enymytes shall be forgote^ and taken away (says he) out of my sight /
for lo / I shall make new heavens and a new earth and their shall be no mention
of ye old / nethr shall they enymor asce^de to me^nis hartis but these me^ shall
rejoice and enjoy these ye I shall make for evr / for lo / I shall make
Ierusalez right glad even from her very heart / whose people shall be joyful with
who^ I my self shall be glad / and merye with (...) people / there shall not be
hard in hireny wepi^ge or kryinge / nethr shall there be aftyr this ethr infant
or old mn yt have not their full days / but y^ yo^ge man at an C. years
shaldye / and ye transgressour of an C. years shall be damned / they shall build
houses and i^habit the^ / they shall pla^te vynes and eat of their fruits /
they shall not edify for a nothr to dwell in it / nethr plant for a nothr to
eat it / but ye life of my people and ye works of their hands shall be as
fresshe as ye tree of life / my chosen shall se many years and shall not labor in
vain nor bring forth their fruit with trouble / for they ar ye blessed sead of
ye lord and their issue shall abide with the^ / and ye time shall cu^ yt I will
answer the^ before they call on me. I will hear the^ while they ar yet but in
co^ceyuing their peticio^: ye wolf and ye la^be shall feed togithr / ye lyo^
shall eat hay with ye ox / but ye earth shall be meat for ye ^pe^t / there shall be
nomor trouble nor plage in all my holy hill says y^ lord. c. 66

THus says ye lord / heaven is my seat and ye earth is my footstool / where
then shall this house sto^de which ye (...) buy lde me? and where is this place
wherein Ishal rest? when my ha^dis made al these thing is and they ar rekened
emonge ye thingis which are made says ye lord: but to who^ shall I look? eue^
to ye ho^ble in spirit which tre^bleth at my speech / for he yt slays an ox
slays a man / and he yt slays a sheep ha^geth a dog / he yt offers to
me anvtwarde offeri^g pleases me as well as to offer me swynes blood / he yt
i^ce^se me does eve^ a like thing as to pray se and bless an idol / but these
me^ have chosen these thi^gis and their minds have delighted i^ these ways
and abhominacio^s / whr for Ishal eue^ lykwise chose out their skorners / and
those thi^gis yt they feared I shall bri^ge on their neckis because y^ when I
called / noma^ would answr: and when I spoke noma^ would hear: but they did
euel i^ my presens / and chosed those things which I reprove. Hear ye word of
ye lord ye ye tremble and fear at his speech / your brothrn which hate and
abhor you because ye call on my name say / let ye lord magnifye hi^ self yt
we might se your gladness / but siche me^ shall be co^fu^ded / ye / eue^ now
begi^neth ye voice of ye lord (as co^cerni^g ye destruccio^ of ye cite and

lame^tatio^ of a woman great with child before her pa^ges and labors cu^ when
she is bri^gi^gforth a man child who has hard siche thi^gis? or who has
seen siche thi^gis? do ye earth bri^gforth al on a day? or ar al folk borne at
once as Zio^ co^ceyueth and bri^gethforth her childern? do I destroy or do I
not rathr begette? do I not begette? and do I not make bare^ says god? beg lad
with Jerusalem and singe with her for joy al her lovers / rejoice with her even from
your hearts al her moorners: for ye shall souke and be satisfied at her teatis
of co^solacio^ / ye shall souke and be rep leneshed^xith her gloriouse
ple^tuousnes / for thus spoke ye lord / Lo I shall led forth peace to her like
af loud / and ye power of ye ge^tils shall I ledeforth like a great rising watr:
ye shall souke thr for and be borne in her bosom / and da^sedvpo^ her knees /
for I shall comfort you and eue^ in Jerusalem shall you receive co^solacio^ as of

your bones shall floureshe like a grene pla^t / and ye lords ^ua^t shall praise
his power / and his enymes shall he threaten: For lo / ye lord shall cu^ in fire

he shall cu^ in ye flame of fire / for with fire and with his sword shall he judge
eury flessh: and his welbe loved slain for his sake shall be e^cresed: but they
y^ vowed to make their self clean in groves / and they y^ eat openly emo^ge
the^ self hoggis flessh / my se / and sich othr abominable uncleanness shall be

ge^tyls as to y^ Cylicks / Lybes / and Lydees which are noble archers: I shall
send to Italye and Greece and to ye fardest eyla^ds which yet h^rd not my

bri^ging al your brothrn from ye multitude of ye ge^tils to be an oblacio^ to

ye lord: for as this new heaven and earth which I shall make shall abide in my

thr shall be perpetual festes of ye new mones and perpetual sabbath days / and
every flessh shall cu^ to worshipe before me says ye lord: and they shall goforth
