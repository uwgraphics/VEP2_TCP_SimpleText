A slanderous Libell (cast abroad) unto an Epitaph set forth upon the death of
D. E. Boner, with a Reply to the same lying Libell, by T. Broo.



Imprinted at London by John Day, dwelling over Aldersgate.

The Libell.
Who so sp eaketh that he should not:
must hear what he would not.
MArch forth in malice brauling Brook,
let taunting tongue have no restraint:
Spew our the worst thou canstinuent,
against this Boner blessed saint.
Spare not to speak most slanderous speech,
against this Prelate dead and gone:
Declare thy self like furious dog,
to bite and bark at every stone.
Reply.
At length I find thy lies I weigh not:
Truth bids me answer although I would not.
NO malice moved has my mind,
nor tauntingly the truth I pen:
No spite did cause me to depaint,
this Boner saint of Satan's den.
Where as the devil bears the cross,
a holy sort it should appear:
If Boner be a blessed saint,
then cruel Nero need not fear.
The slaughter house had open wrong,
that Boner was a Bishop made:
And Newgate lost his right that day,
so skillful he in Baylers trade.
No mad brain mood has me prouokt,
nor Boner dead I ought despite:
Which thou might see with open eyes,
but Boner like thou hatst the light.
But lo from thee now flascheth forth,
the burning sprite of Boners breast:
Which wonted was in wilful sort,
the law and truth with wrong to wrest.
Yet for I heard of some so fond,
to think that he was wronged much:
A piece (not all) of his leude lite,
I thought no shame or sin to touch.
I could have told the numbers, great
of vices vile the viper had:
Whose fury fell and frantic force,
often honest hearts with care has clad.
And Epitaphes do only serve,
the wightes enthrald by Atropos:
Which else the same of their deserts,
or good or badde might hap to lose.
Some praise the Lawyers judgments right,
some vaunt the warriors worthynes:
Some tell the virtues of the wise,
some show of Boners blouddynes.
Not I then like a furious dog,
in death have savage Boner bitte:
Nor raging I with stormy streams,
but calmely lo my floudes did flitte.
The Libell.
Thy railing tongue against good men,
is to well known seven years ago:
What slanders thou against him heapest,
if truth were known be nothing so.
Reply.
Thou do me wrong thus to accuse,
of flaundring any honest man:
Or now, or seven years ago,
name thou the wight if that thou can.
In railing thou art Boners child,
in scoffs, in scoldes, in slanders vile,
In lyings leude in Popery,
it seems thy dame did not begile.
Most like thy dad in every point,
yet bastard none for ought I know:
Nor maiden Priest as Boner was,
whose children liude not long ago.
The infernal sprites do dance for joy,
to hear this Boners babe thus baule:
And falsehode fleeres to find such friends,
as seek with lies the truth to gaul.
Is this the just reward I have,
that sought in silence for to hide:
The half of all his wretchedness,
which thou might shame to hear discride?
Thou show thy self even what thou art
a blessed babe of Baalams brood:
Not able to maintain thy part,
in slaundering swellest like a tode.
The Libell.
The law thou think is on thy side,
to rail at random as thou listest:
And for thy slanderous words thou hopest,
that none should thee resist.
Reply.
The law is on my side I know,
the perfect law of God it is:
Which to reprove thou have no power,
though serpent like thou subtly hiss.
This was the practice of the Jews,
to cloak their faults with false report:
Their cursed cruelty to hide,
and sinful sects for to support.
The Libell.
His virtues rare did thee displease,
for thieves against just judges speak:
Till Partha cut his fatal thread,
thy woeful wrath thou durst not wreake.
Does Gospel which thou do profess,
teach thee to dip thy pen in gall,
And so defame such learned men,
whom virtue does to honor call.
Reply.
Yea more then rare his virtues were,
for virtue none in him did rest:
As time did serve I sought to show,
the vices which I still detest.
If I in ought have Boner wrongde,
it is in that I not displaide:
Unto the full his wretched life,
and Pagan Pagentes that he plaide.
But now since that ye give the cause,
to thend you Papists should not think:
Your lying lips and slaundrous words,
from known truth should make me shrink.
In playner sort I justly prove,
that Boner for his great outrage:
Did Achab pass and Iezabell,
a Dioclesian of our age.
And if my verse seem somewhat sharp,
yet from the truth I will not swerve:
And vnprouokte of enuies root,
yield milder words then ye deserve.
Some thieves against just judges speak,
so Caiphas did against his Christ:
But if that thou call Boner just,
I well can prove thou shamefully lie.
He often for meede perverted right,
a cruel tyranne in his days:
He bolstered bawdry by his might,
and simonie by Romish says.
And thou do follow him apace,
to rail and rave without cause why:
The things thou can not justly prove,
thou fortifiest with a lie.
With spiders juice thy pen is wet,
no Gospells lore thy tongue does guide:
But Pluto or his younglinges skill,
the poisoned Pope high prince of pride.
By false hypocrisy we see,
did Boner clime to honors height:
And placed there unworthy he,
all virtues ways despised straight.
Yet London may his Minotaure,
his Boner boast for all assayes:
Since Becket never bred such bale,
nor half so well the Pope could please.
Why did ye not shrine him alive,
Saint Dunstane might have done the deed:
Sweet samt Fraunces or Boniface,
or Beelzebub for better speed.
The Libell.
We see how thou in Rethoricke roollest,
as one in Schemes and Tropes expert.
Frequenting of this figure rare,
which some men call sauce malipert.
What truth in preaching thou declarest,
I am content that other try.
In this thy work I can affirm,
that every line contaynes a lie.
And every lie so shamefully made:
sucked out from saucy fingers end,
That surely some unhappy sprite,
put to his hand to have it penned.
Reply.
Thou and thy Boner bounteles,
in natures one seem to agree:
Two happy wombes from whence the sprang,
the pestilent fruit of poisoned tree.
What Boner was right well appeard,
while wastfull will with might was matched:
Such would thou seem in power plast,
a bounsing boy of Hidra hatched.
Thy muse does march in slanderous sort,
fond rage does rule thy beastly brain:
Cease shameless tauntyng tongue to toil,
in Boners case with lies so vain.
I told a troth why do thou lie,
tho preacher none to far unfit:
Forbear to strive against the stream,
let reason rule thy wreastling wit.
Thou do abuse thy figure much,
that More so meant thou can not prove:
It is not sure Saucemalepert,
a knave of knavery to reprove.
Thou were but lately at the mill,
that ground thy lies yet somewhat gross:
Alas good sir how saucye I,
the serpents subtletie to disclose.
When as the Apostles did reprove,
the high priests, they were said to scold,
So I in telling Boners faults,
of thee am counted saucese bold.
But what if I should tell them all,
then might thou have a heavy heart:
Poor papist sure thou would run mad,
for why these few do make thee start.
The spirit that guided has my pen,
is tried truth I dare avouch:
You loath to hear his treachery,
because such faults your self do touch.
If virtue had remainde in him,
or were thy years replete with grace:
I would have reverenced you both,
but to brute beasts I give no place.
The Libell.
Did he five times with solemn oath,
his Clxistian faith deny?
Did he five times renounce the Pope?
O shameful famous lie.
Four times belike before his birth,
he did commit the crime:
And then the fifth thou do declare,
was in Lord Cromwels time.
And then was he but very young,
and knew not chalk from chese:
Perchance as loath as thou art now,
promotion for to leese.
Reply.
That sundry times he sworn was,
to maintenance of christian faith:
His hand does show forth coming yet,
but perjured papists this not wayeth.
First named Archdeacon of Leicester,
he swear unto King Henry's book:
Then elect bishop of Hereforde,
he swear again, the story look.
Then pastor he of London made,
against the Pope he took his oath:
And when our sovereign borne was,
he did the like know this for troth.
So at the birth of Prince Edward,
and at his coronation:
He swear against the Romish whore,
and her abomination.
I leave how stoutely he at Rome,
defied the Pope unto his face:
In Scalding lead he had been boylde,
but that he packt away a pace.
Thou say I made a famous lie,
but I have proved my words full true:
From those thy lines is truth exilde,
as from the rest which do ensue.
And for his years by thy account,
full fifty he in Cromwells time:
O shamels man the truth appears,
seek not with lies to hide his crime.
Thou say he lived fourscore and six,
but thirty one since Cromwell dyed:
Then fifty five was Boners age,
in Cromwells time, or thou have lied.
No baby then a knauish fool,
a crafty cloyne as now thou art:
Thy lines do show how he could clawe,
and for advantage play his part.
Promotion sure I never chose,
nor glutted am with worldly pelf:
But though I all at once should lose,
yet would I not forswear my self.
The Libell.
But after he was grounded once,
in wisdoms learned schole.
He did perceive and sore repent,
that he had playde the fool.
And calling then for God his grace,
for to inspire his heart:
Persisted still in Christ his faith.
till death did him depart.
Reply.
Thou art deceived he never learnd,
in schole by wisdoms sacred lore:
For to deny the gospel pure,
which he professed had before.
But Judas like he Christ betrayde,
a persecuting Saul outright:
As Cain his sins he did forthincke,
professing Ieroboams sprite.
And as the dog to vomit turns,
so Boner leaving wisdoms schole:
To wonted lewdnes made repair,
the longer life the greater fool.
Wherefore the Lord with drew his spirit,
and gave him up unto his lust:
Wherein he ran a ruthful race,
till he returned again to dust.
The Libell.
His years on earth with honor spent,
were three and forty double told:
But as for thee thou may be hangde,
ere thou be half so old.
Reply.
Herein the princes mercy shines,
our noble Queen sought not his blood:
As he did hers maliciously,
and stubbournely her laws with stood.
Her clemency a cureles heart,
she thought in time to truth should turn,
But vice had virtue chased so,
that grace by no means might return.
Full thirty years now have I liude,
but rather than I would become:
So quite deuoyde of shame as he,
I wish to God for speedy dome.
But thou pray for thy self I say,
for when both Pope and hope are past:
To feel thy wretched bodies weight,
a rope may serve thy neck at last.
The Libell.
Thou say that Papists lingering hope,
in Bishop Boner did depend,
Which now, since death did him prevent,
is come thou trustes to final end.
Well then I frame this argument,
a simile to thee again:
Since sundry of thy sinful sect,
by dint of death are slain.
As Calvin pillar of your Church,
whom you accounted wise:
In liewe of his false heresy,
was werried up with lice.
Since Luther, author of your sect,
whom Satan's schisms fed:
As dronken sot, with sursetting,
was dead found in his bed.
Reply.
The lingering hope the papists lost,
was great by Boners fatal fall:
If not consumed into care,
their pieuish pride it did appall.
That papists hoped their watchword shows,
a due unto the golden day:
Our God is good who than I trust,
shall put you papists by your pray. etc.
Sometime God does from anger stint,
he will not beat his children still:
As when he takes tyrants away,
which live in hope his church to spill.
Sometime for peoples sins also,
does God bereave their pastors true:
A token of Gods wrath to come,
and his displeasure to ensue.
So Boner taken away from us,
fortels the goodness of our God:
And Luthers death and Caluins both,
was to those countries then a rod.
Our Church on no such pillars stands,
on Christ the rock, our faith is stayde:
And though such worthy members dye,
our hearts thereby are not dismayde.
But O thou most infamous wretch,
I think the very devils of hell:
Do hide their face for very shame,
their son so lewd a lie to tell.
Did Calvin dye wearied with lise?
or like a Lamb with sickness pressed:
Beware least lise revenge these lies,
by wrath of God on that thy breast.
How Martin Luther yielded breath,
apparent is by good record:
And such a stately burial,
has wanted many a prince and Lord.
O stiff neckt Jew that never stentest,
Christ's followers for to defame:
With gluttony and dronkenes,
the troth is known and breeds thy shame.
But Boner was no surfetor,
by fast and prayer he pined so:
That uneath he had an eye to see,
for fat he scarsely well might go.
The Imber days he well obserud,
with fish from Sea and runnyng streme:
And that but base of common sort,
as Cunger, Brett, Pike, Carpe, and Breme.
He fasted often till hunger came,
he spared much the poor man's beef:
With Quail and Partrege he took pain,
fat Capons were his chief relief.
Instead of grosest Mutton pies,
the fattest Venson from park and chase:
Both hot and cold, and that good store,
with wine he washed down apace.
He had a care for Horse and Mule,
and kept their branne out of his bread:
On finest manchet that was made,
alas this sely Boner fed.
And since the Thames was somewhat far,
or Cundite water clear and fine:
His morning draught was Ipocras,
or else the purest Muscadine.
For norishing he loud a Pigge,
et non tam caute but I hear:
When hauty hearts were hard to have,
he was content with Fallow Dear. etc.
He watched when as he could not sleep,
he prayde that ye might hear him snort:
Instead of bordes on beds of down,
thus was this pynyng Prelates hurt.
To recreate his sprites he used,
Boules, Cards, and Tables, all day long:
And set upon his merry pin,
could sometime sing a baudy song. etc.
But since thou do delight to hear,
of such as dyed in distress:
Though Luther and Calvin both were clear,
lo here at least a mischeuous mess.
Pope Adrian, your blessed sire,
in breathing threats against a king:
An ugly Fly with sudden death,
his holiness at throat did sting.
The greatest foe that Luther had,
Eckius yelding up the ghost:
Did say: four thousand crowns preparde,
will this dispatch (a jolly boast).
A heavenly end no doubt he made,
he had some Cardinalship to buy:
He thought (as Boner) on his God,
which forced him thus on him to cry.
Cardinal Cretensius
dyed, with sight of a black dog:
In ruth ended Bomelius,
and Thornton that beastly hog.
Iacobus Latomus having made,
gaynst Luther an oration long:
Fell straight to desperation,
and ended so his woeful song.
Lord Poncher, and Minerius,
with fire of God were stricken so:
And while their flesh consumde therewith,
defied God as mortal foe.
Our Cardinal Poole in Grenewich house,
did bless the Dover Suffragane:
While kneeling down upon the straires,
receiude it like a holy man.
The blessing given the blessed fell,
down from the stairs his neck he brast:
I think the devil might have given,
as good a blessing with less have.
These were the patrones of your Church,
blessed bishops Boner like:
Great tormenters of Christ's flock,
O fear the Lord least he do strike.
The Libell.
Since Prince of Conde, all your hope,
your buckler and your shield,
As traitor false against his Prince,
was stayne in open field.
The Prince of Orange put to flight,
with all his band dismayed:
You heretics must needs confess,
your courage quite decade.
Reply.
Of noble princes for to write,
it is to far without my reach:
But if thou had a subjects heart,
then would thou use more seemly speech,
Thou show well thy traiterous mind,
unto thy prince and native land:
A rope, a rope for that parot,
or (Boners bounty) a fire brand.
I know the Prince of Conde slain,
and so your manly Duke of Guise:
The king of Navarre bid like pain,
Duke Mommorancy in likewise.
The Duke of Alba his son is dead,
what praise his father won that time:
I do not tell or need not write,
for why so hye I will not clime.
The Libell.
Thy slaundering him with tyranny,
in such a spiteful sort:
Might make some men which knew him not,
believe thy false report.
Thou say that from the face of some,
with claws he rent the hear:
But where, or when, or names of them,
that can thou not declare.
But when gave he reproachful words,
or such disdainful eyes:
Unto the Queens commissioners,
a whetstone for these lies.
Reply.
Thou breathyng forth with bashles brow,
of lewd lies lo a monstrous heap:
Do me accuse most wrongfully,
the shame thereof be sure to reap.
His tyranny does so appear,
again I need it not report:
How many ways in wilful wise,
or after what a shameless sort.
First clapped he men in prison strong,
till rigourous laws were framed whereby:
With cloak of right he might consume,
all such as would not Christ deny.
The law so made Christ's flock to spoil,
could Boners fury nothing swage:
But that his bloody hands must help,
them to torment in wilful rage.
Some with his fist he beat so sore,
upon the face that swollen black:
The selly souls condemned to dye,
did bring his mark unto the stake.
Poor Tomkins hand did Boner burn,
this tormenter not so content:
With cruel claws from of his face,
nigh half his beard the tyrant rent.
Most Tiger like wi^h Pagan paws,
the beard of Rough in rage extreme:
In shameless sort the tyrant tare,
how blessed he now may ye deem.
What should I need to name the rest,
they live that saw it with their eyes:
Yet falsely thou do me reprove,
a mill a mill to grind thy lies.
Of his reprochefull words unmeet,
the people are not ignorant:
And lo I would them now recite,
if that thy forged lies might daunt.
But tho I had a thousand proufes,
which would avouch my words for south:
They might not serve so shameless thou,
no truth may stop thy lying mouth.
A Papists gyse is this I find:
the truth with lies full ouertwhart:
First to assail with slanders weyt,
and last he scoldeth out his part.
Of his lewd life I loath to think,
to write it all it yerketh me:
Tho young I rather wish thee mend,
least old thou prove as ill as he.
The Libell.
Thy slanders all I could confute,
but present time will not suffice:
Yet will I somewhat touch his death.
because I saw it with mine eyes.
Thou absent at his death reportest,
his face both black and blew:
But all which saw it witness can,
how that is most untrue.
Happy art thou if after death,
God grant to thee this grace:
To have thy soul as clear of hew,
as was this Bishops face.
A doleful end (thou say) he had,
but there thou lie as in the rest:
For he persisted still in prayer,
while any breath was in his breast.
He cride God mercy for his sins,
which he by frailty had commit:
And armyng him with sign of Cross,
his soul to God he did submit.
Reply.
My slanders all thou could confute,
I slaundred not, why do thou lie?
Thou lackest time, nay truth thou wantst,
thy forged falshode for to try.
If that thine eye beheld his end,
a woeful sight to thee I fear:
Though absent, I have heard report,
of honester then thou, even there.
His keeper Way did it declare,
with other that beheld his end:
Now if they have not double tounges,
the truth they told they will defend.
Pray for thy self, I am not sick,
or else a better prayer make:
My soul (I trust) in better hew,
Christ to his mercy shall betake.
Thou do this bloody Boner wrong,
in calling him a Bishop still:
For he a beastly butcher was,
the selly Lambs of God to kill.
It Is known how long he specheles lay,
yet would thou hide but God will not:
Tho Papists cloak truth will disclose,
in spite of all their knauish knot.
When speech was gone, ye heard him speak,
and call for mercy at the last:
O shameless man think on the truth,
and call for help ere hope be past.
The Libell.
Doleful to whom was this his end,
to thee or him, to thee I smell:
For doubtless thou do stomach this,
that he should live and dye so well.
Reply.
And though his death more milder were,
then those his fellows I namde before:
I will not judge but God does know,
what wrath he kept for him in store.
The wickedness by you maintaind,
I hate as devil and deadly foe:
The men I no whit do envy,
let bloody Boner and babell go.
The Libell.
As for his burial in the night,
some malice there was shewde:
And yet unto his blessed soul,
what harm thereby ensued.
Your castyng him to homely pit,
in such a theeuish place:
Can hinder him nothing at all,
to taste of heavenly grace.
For Christ him self between two thieves,
did suffer bitter pain:
Whereby his glory was increast,
for ever to remain.
Reply.
It is a blessyng of the Lord,
to dye in peace in native land:
And that the fathers graves should hold,
the brethlesse corpse once turnde to sand.
But Boner could not that obtain,
for God did see it was not meet:
And causde the rulers to command,
a worser place, for him more fit.
Though Christ were erucified with thieves,
yet buried was in stately tome,
With costly oyntmentes very dear,
such was his heavenly fathers doine.
But though here were a thief at hand,
no Christ to dye or lie by him:
Wherefore as it behooves well,
to Satan lo I leave his lim.
The Libell.
Now farewell Brook, and if thou think,
for all thy learned skill:
That slaunderyng tongue can ought avail,
then hardly use it still.
But if thou know the devil it loves,
and God detestes the same:
Repent for that which thou have done,
and leave it now for shame.
FINIS.
Reply.
How ill a trothlesse tongue besemes,
in thee I see that do it use:
What slaundryng lyps do merit still,
thou do me learn by thine abuse.
Repentance none need I to crave,
for ought that I have done or said:
Gaynst thee or bloody Boner yet,
if that my cause be justly wayd.
But having cleared all thy doubts,
and truly answered thy demaundes:
I give thy gyrdes good leave to grase,
in black obliuions heavy laundes.
And thus of hidden name adieu,
thy pieuish peale so lewdly rong:
Declares thy kind for withered fruit,
from rotten stock has always sprung.
Thou do nothing degenerate,
from Papists kind and seed of Baal,
Thy grandsire is great Lucifer,
his son the Pope, ye liars all.
I was in doubt to use my pen,
in aunsweryng of so vile a beast:
But that I thought my silence should,
thy causeless pride have much increast.
Then henceforth know I do disdeyne,
one word to write against thy rhyme:
For lo, my hands I should but steine,
in touching such a piece of slime.
Now rail and rage in roystyng wise,
now scolde and scoff thy belly full:
Thy truthlesse tongue I force it not,
I leave thee wholly to thy Trull.
But yet I do beseech the Lord,
to mollify thy stony heart:
To plant repentance by his spirit,
and all the Papists to convert.
Fare well until thy golden day,
wherein I trust without delay:
All such as would their Christ betray. etc.
shall find a doom and judgment day.
Fare well.
FINIS.
T. Brook the younger.
