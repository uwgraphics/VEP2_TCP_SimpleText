seal of the Commonwealth AN ORDINANCE FOR Further doubling upon and finishing
the sale of Deans, Deans and Chapters Lands, and of Manors of Rectories,
Gleab-Lands, etc.
Whereas by one Act of Parliament entitled, An Act for sale of the Manors of
Rectories and Glebe-lands, late belonging to Arch Bishops, Bishops, Deans,
Deans and Chapters, It is enacted and Declared, That all Manors of Rectories,
impropriate Messuages, Tenements, Gleab-lands, Pastures, Meadows, Marshes,
belonging to any Rectorie impropriate, and Fee-farm Rents, issuing out of
Manors or Rectories impropriate, jointly or severally charged therewith late
belonging or appertaining to any Rectorie impropriate, Parsonage, Church,
Chapel, or Donative, late appertaining or belonging to any Archbishop,
Bishop, Dean, Dean and Chapter, Prebend or other person or persons or bodies
Politic, mentioned in one Ordinance of the ninth of December 1646. Entitled,
An Ordinance of this present Parliament for abolishing of Archbishops and
Bishops within the Commonwealth of England, and Dominion of Wales, and for
settling their Lands and Possessions upon Trustees for the use of the
Commonwealth. And in one Act of Parliament, Entitled, An Act of the Commons of
England in Parliament assembled for the abolishing of Deans, Deans and Chapters,
Canons, Prebends, and other offices and titles of or belonging to any Cathedral
or Collegiate Church or Chapel within England and Wales, to be abolished in
right of his or their said Office or function, should be and were settled in
the full seison and possession of the respective Trustees in the said Ordinance
and Act named, their Heirs and Assigns. And the said respective Trustees in the
said Ordinance and Act named were authorized and required to contract, bargain,
sell, alien, and conveigh all and every the Premises, and to execute all
powers and authorities in sale thereof, as they might have done in the sale of
any Honors, Manors, or Lands in the said Ordinance and Act mentioned. And
whereas likewise by one other Act, Entitled, An Additional Act, for the more
speedy effecting of the Sale of the Manors of Rectories and Glebelands, late
belonging to the Archbishops, Bishops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, etc. and for
the better encouragement of Lenders upon the security thereof, and of other
Lands and Hereditaments of the said Deans and Chapters, The Parliament did enact
and declare, that all and singular the Honors, Manors, Lands, Tenements and
Hereditaments, which by the said Act for abolishing of Deans, Deans and
Chapters, etc. were exposed to sale, and not contracted for before the five and
twentieth day of October, One thousand six hundred and fifty, (other then such
as by the said last recived Act were reserved from sale) should be and were
thereby declared to be part of the security for the one hundred and twenty
thousand pounds, which by the said forerecited Act was to be borrowed, and
should extend to secure as well the debts, principal and interest, which should
be doubled, as for the moneys which should be advanced and paid in to double
the same, and the interest from the time of doubling until the payment. And
that if the Manors, Lands, Tenements, and hereditaments (by the said Act for
abolishing of Deans, Deans and Chapters, etc. exposed to sale) so contracted
for before the five and twentieth day of October, One thousand six hundred and
fifty, should (according to the rates at which the same were contracted for)
amount unto a greater value than the moneys, debts and other charges, which
before the second day of October, One thousand six hundred and fifty, were
charged upon the same, or to be satisfied thereby, and it should be so
declared by the Committee for obstructions; That in such case the overplus of
the value of the premises so contracted for, should also be, and should be
accounted as part of the security for the said moneys: And it was also Enacted
and Ordained, that the Trustees in whom the same premises so intended for
security were respectively vested, and their heirs respectively should stand
seized thereof, and of the Rents, issues and profits thereof, until sale; And
of the moneys which should be raised by the sale thereof, unto and for the
uses following, viz. for the payment of the moneys and debts which should be
owing upon the security of the said premises, and all salaries and incident
charges, and the remainder thereof to the use of the Commonwealth, in such
manner as the Parliament should appoint; And that all and every the said Rents,
issues and profits of the premises, and moneys to be raised by the sale
thereof, should be paid and issued out to the purposes aforesaid, by the
Treasurers thereof, according to such warrant as they should receive from the
Trustees for Deans, Deans and Chapters lands, or any five or more of them, in
that behalf; And whereas by the said last recited Act all and every the
premises so appointed for security as aforesaid, were appointed to be sold,
and were absolutely disposed unto the said respective Trustees for that
purpose, as well for satisfying the moneys upon the said Security, and for
raising of moneys for the Service of the Common Wealth as also, to put a full
end unto that business, and the charge of Officers, and others employed therein.

And whereas nevertheless, some part of the Premises yet remains unsold,
there being so much already contracted for, as is sufficient to satisfy all
the Moneys due upon the former Securities: And whereas also former Contracts
could not be so exactly settled as to the precise sums, by differing
Securities, respectively charged upon the Revenue of the said Deans, Deans and
Chapters, and other the Premises aforesaid, whereby some sort of Debts, to
which the said Premises are liable, are more then provided for to a
considerable value, and the rest not applicable to satisfy such overplus which
does tend to the disadvantage both of particular Persons, and also of the
Commonwealth, by retarding the whole work. To the end therefore, a speedy end
may be put to the said Sale, and the Commonwealth eased of the burden and
charge thereof;

Be it Ordained by his highness the Lord Protector, by and with the consent of
his Council and it is Ordained by the Authority aforesaid. That over and above
the sum of three hundred thousand pounds, appointed to be borrowed upon the
Security held forth by the first recited Act, and over and above the sum of
one hundred and twenty thousand pounds more, borrowed upon the Security held
forth in the two last recited Acts, or either of them, the sum of twenty
thousand pounds shall be further borrowed upon the Security of such of the
Premises respectively, exposed to sale by the said Acts, or either of them, in
such sort as is hereafter expressed, by way of doubling the like sum, as
shall be due to any person or persons, Body politic or Corporate, for any
Money, Plate, Norl, Arms, or other thing advanced upon the Public Faith, or
which has been at any time allowed by any Act or Ordinance of Parliament, to
be doubled, as Public Faith; together with Interest upon such Public Faith
Debts, after the rate of eight pounds in the hundred, by the year, until the
stating of such Debts and Interest, by the Persons named and appointed in and
by an Act of Parliament, Entitled, An Additional Act for sale of several Lands
and Estates forfeited to the Commonwealth for Treason, to be Register
Accomptant or any of them which the said Persons, or any of them, are hereby
authorized to state accordingly. And after the stating of such Debts and
Interest, and doubling thereof, the respective Creditors to be allowed only
six pounds in the hundred by the year, for the whole of such doubled Public
Faith Debts, until the payment thereof, or defalcation upon purchase, In

Acts or either of them, save only what is hereby altered with restriction to
debts and interests as aforesaid, and all and every person and persons who
shall have their debts and interests stated as aforesaid, shall pay into the
Treasurers named in the said Act for sale of the said Manors of Rectories, or
one of them, the money wherewith he or they ought to double within ten days

or their Public Faith debts, unless he or they shall show good cause to the
Treasurers or any one of them for his or their faller therein. And be it
further Ordained, that both the Certificates or Receipts to be given by the
said Treasurers, or one of them, for moneys to be doubled upon the security

Bills for moneys or debts doubled or transferred upon the securities held forth
by any the Acts aforesaid, which were defalke able in payment for any purchase
made within the same former Acts or any of them shall be and are herby made to
be defalkeable in payment in manner and form following; That is to say, the
Certificates or Receipts for moneys to be doubled upon the security held

second Moity, other then such Bills or Receipts, as by his or their Contract
