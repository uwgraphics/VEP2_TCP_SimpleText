Dread Sovereign:
YOur most Loyal and most Devoted Subjects, Your Maj. General, Field Officers
and Captains, with all the Inferior Officers of Your two Regiments of Horse of
Your City of London, whiles some men's zeal through unrighteous Seducements,
seems a little cooled toward Your Majesty's Service, Do with all humble
boldness Remonstrate the Constancy of theirs; And in a deep sense of their Duty
and high Obligations to Your Sacred Majesty for Your especial Indulgencies to
this Your Native City, do Dedicate their Lives and Estates to Your Majesty's
Service, Hereby adding to their Oath of Allegiance, That they will not only
bear Faith and Obedience to Your Majesty, but upon all Occasions joyfully
employ and improve their uttermost power and vigilance with their Lives and
Fortunes to destroy Your Enemies in defense of Your Royal Person and
Authority, and securing all Your just, Civil Interests, with the Interest of
Religion as it is now established by Law, For your Majesty being eminently the
most Pious, Gracious, and Worthy Prince in the World, we cannot, without
exceeding all other Subjects in Loyalty and Affection, deserve the Title of

Your Majesty's True, Dutiful, Humble, and Obedient Subjects and Servants.
