Wherein is shown, the nature of it; the place where it is, so far as
probably may be conjectured; the several punishments of the damned therein,
and aggravations of the same; the justice of God maintained in sending the
wicked thither; with diverse other things.

PSALM. 917. The wicked shall be turned into Hell.


AMONG other parts of Scripture, none more excellent then The book of the
Psalms; inasmuch as S. Austin Psalmorum liber -- ut brevites dicam, communis
quidam bonae doctrinae the sunrus est. Prolog. in lib. Psalm.
calls it, a common treasury of good doctrine: and why Common? but that no
doctrine whatsoever, which is good and necessary to be taught, or learned, is
there wanting, as he renders the reason Quid autem est quod non discatur in
Psalmis? Non omnis magni^ (...)
; there is, says he, the magnitude of virtue, the square of justice, the
perfection of prudence, the rule of patience, the perfect knowledge of God,
predictions of Christ to come, the common hope of the resurrection, revelation
of mysteries, the promise of glory, fear of punishments. And for this last, no
place more pregnant then my Text,

The wicked shall be turned into Hell,

The punishment of all punishments Or^u^ malorum omnium extremum.

Plato Gorg. sive de Rhet. Cogita, homo, quo slibet mu^di cruciatus, intend
animo quasque saeculi paenas, quosque tormentorum dolores, qu^scunque dolo^uns

Catechizan rudibus, cap. 24


.

I am not ignorant that some (and they both ancient and modern) do understand
it of the grave, and their destruction by a temporal death: The Hebrew word
[Sheol] bearing both significations, as well of the Grave, as of the place and
state of the Damned. But I think it better (...). Nestor. Hom. II.
to take it in this latter sense, being led by these reasons.

First; because, as I conceive, it is David's purpose here to consolate the
faithful, and excite them to thankes-giving, by the consideration of Gods
dealing with their enemies and oppressors; Such as, in those times, were the
Philistines, Amorites, Moabites, Syrians, etc. that though he suffer them for a
while to be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides, using them as
Rods to scourge them; yet, those Rods shall not always rest upon their lot,
but, Tandem diphtheram inspiciet, at length he will call them to account, and
give them their reward; dealing with them as sometimes a Father does with the
Rod, after he has corrected his child, viz. break it, and throw it into the
fire Facit hoc Deus quod plerunque facit and homo. Aliquando iratus homo
apprehendit virgam jacentem in medio fortasse qua lecunque sarmentum, caedit
inde filium suum, ac deinde projicit sarmentum in ignem. Aug. in Psalm 74.4.
.

(...) Hesiod. (...). lib. 1.
. That pit which they have made for others, to procure their overthrow and
destruction, they shall fall into themselves; and so perish here: and more then
so Nec finire licet tantos sibi Morte dolores. Ovid. Metamor. lib. 1. fab. 10.
; hereafter suffer the vengeance of eternal fire in Hell, be turned thither.

2. Albeit, as Chrysostom Mors nomen tantum fidelibus. Hom. 29. in Genesis
speaks, that Death is only a Name to the faithful; the nature of it being
changed. (So as, it is no more now Interitus, but Introitus Ducit ad aeternam
te mors brevis, ut via, vitam; ut mors Interitus non fit, at Introitus. Owen
lib. 3. ad D. Mariam Neville Epigr. 77.
, not Meth but Thom, by inversion, which signifies perfection:) yet, being
common to them with the wicked, by the Statute enacted primo Adami, for all men
once to die Hebr. 9.27.
; were it here understood, it did not so fully set forth the judgment of God
upon the wicked, mentioned in the 16 verse, which is the verse before my Text.

3. A third reason I gather from the word here used Turned, Wherein the
Psalmist seems to allude to the form of the Sentence at the latter day, Go
ye cursed into everlasting fire.

4. The learned Weemse Exercitations divine: Exer. 15. page 138.
observe, that whenever this word [Sheol] is spoken of the wicked, and has
He locale added to it, (as here, Lesheolah;) it always signifies Hell, and not
the Grave.

My last reason is taken from the reading of the Septuagint; (unto whose
authority I cannot but subscribe -- Veterum digne veneror cum scripta virorum.
Ovid. Trist. lib. 5. Eleg. 3.
, when I consider, in how great account they were had among the Ancients,
esteeming them no less then Prophets Iren. adversus haereses, lib 3. cap. 25.

43 and 44. and in Psalm. 88.10.
: especially, seeing the writers of the New Test. honor them so far, as in
quoting the old to follow their translation Apostoliconsonant praedictae

, forsaking the Hebrew; only Matthew excepted, who writ in Hebrew, as S.
Jerome Lib. de viris illust. C. Ma^^^eus.
observes.) They reading it by a word which seldom (especially among
Ecclesiastic and Hagiographal Writers) is taken in any other acception, then
for Hell, the place of the damned. [(...)].

(...). So then; the Sense and true Interpretation of the words being (as I
hope) cleared Quod certias probamus, hoc and praedicamus securius. Bernar.
Apolog. ad Gulielmum, alias, Guillerm^ abbate.
; like the great City in the Apocalypse (...). 19.
, they may be divided into three parts: The Subject, the Adjunct, and
Application of the one unto the other, or Connection of both together. The
Subject, Hell; The Adjunct, The wicked; The Application of the Adjunct to the
Subject, Shall be turned.

Hell is the Subject; and here we will show you by way of preface and
explication, 1. What it is; 2. Where it is; 3. The Punishments of them that are
in it, shall be turned into it;


Before we come to the proof and application of the Proposition, that The
wicked shall be turned into Hell -- Jer quid (...) nisi Trifle. ^^^llus? Ovid
T^^f^. lib. 5. Eleg. 1.
.

And for the first; Hell may be thus described, to be

A place of infinite and extreme torment, created by God, and appointed for
the punishment of the wicked after this life, to the glory and manifestation of
his justice.

It is a place of Torment. Mat. 8.29. Art thou come to Torment us before the
time? say the devils to our Savior: i. e. to send us to the place of Torment
whence we came.

For it is certain, before the day of judgment, they are sometimes loosed from
their bonds, and permitted to come upon the earth, for our exercise, trial,
and temptation Lombar. lib. 2. distinc. 6. e. Thomas ^. quaest. 64. art. 4.
corp. art.
.

Again, it is said of the rich man, Luke 16. that being in Hell in Torments,
he lift up his eyes.

It was created by God too. John 1.3. All things were made by him, etc. But
when it should be created, is uncertain -- (...). Hom. non semel. Theiologi
certant, and adhuc sub judice lis est. Horat. de art Poet.
. He in S. Austin Respondeo dicenti, quid faciebat Deus antequam faceret
coelum and terram, non illud quod quidam respondisse perhibetur, Joculariter
eludens quaestionis violentiam, Alta, inquit, scrutantibus gehennam parabat,
etc. Conses. lib. 2. cap. 12.
who, being asked, What God did before he made the world? answered, He made
Hell for such curious inquisitors; spoke in jest. The Rabbis Lyra lib. contra
Iudaeos. circa med.
say in good earnest, there were seven things created before the world: The
Law, Repentance, The house of the Sanctuary, The throne of glory, The garden
of pleasure, The name Messiah, and Hell.

-- Et Credat Iudaeus apella Horat. Sermon. lib. 1. Sat. 5.
. S. Austin himself is of opinion, it was created the sixth day Quando est
praeparatus ille ignis, nisi perfectione creaturarum omnium? nisi forte
dicamus, post sexti diei perfectionem Deum aliquid creasse, quod absit, etc.
lib. 1. de mirabilibus Scrip. cap. 2.
, after God had finished all the rest of his works. Cornelius a La pide
(Comment. in Genesis 1.) referres it to the first day: forasmuch as the Angels, in
all probability, being then created, then sinned, and were cast into it; they
could not be cast into a place that was not. Others think, it was created the
second day, which was the first that had a Yesterday: from that in Esaias Cap.
30.33. vid. Lyra in locum.
, Tophet is ordained of old, or from Yesterday, as the word Meethmul.
signifies. But by the same reason Nil agit exemplum litem quod lite resolvit.
Horat. Sermon. lib 2. Sat. 3.
, we may as well conclude that it was Created the first day. The words
indifferently bearing both senses; either, that it was Created upon that day,
which first had the name of yesterday, (could be so called,) to wit, the first
day: or, upon that day which next succeeded it (was the first from it,) to wit,
the second day.

Some again would have it Created the second day still, but upon another
ground: because the same Epiphonema is omitted, which is added to the works of
all the other days; God saw that it was good Vid. Walther. harm. S. Scrip. in
Genesis 1, 6, 7, 8.
. Others (supposing it to be in the center of the earth) think it was created
the third day, when God adorned the same, and appointed the places or parts
thereof to their several uses. All that we can say is this -- (...) -- Menel.
Hom. Od. d -- Non est ultra narrabile quicquam. Ovid de Ponto, lib. 2. Eleg. 2.
, that the Scriptures herein are silent, and who shall reveal that which God
has hidden Quis enim revelabit quod Deus texit? Tertul. lib. de anima, cap. 1.
?

2. Where it is. And here too I meet with diversity of opinions: Some placing
it above the earth, because, where men sin they shall receive punishment. It Is
true; in this world, God, sometimes, in the punishment of sin, observes such
a ^orrespondence and pro^ortion, as, where it was ^ommitted, to manifest ^he
tokens of his displeasure, 1 Kings 21.19. In the place, etc. And Iose^hus
reports of Aristobulus, that, causing his brother Antigonus most cruelly to be
murdered; his disease (being sick before) suddenly so far increased, that
he fell into a vomiting of blood in great abundance: which one of his servants
carrying forth; he fell and spilt it, in the very place where Antigonus lately
had been slain Quidam e ministris efferens, divina, opinor, ita volente
providentia, prolapsus, in eo ipso loco effudit, qui Antigoni caedis cruenta
habebat vestigia. Antiq. lib. 13. cap. 19 Vbi Antigonus erat occisus, super
extantes adhuc caedis maculas cruorem interfectoris effudit. de bello Iud. lib.
1. cap. 3.
. Thus I say, God sometimes deals in this world. But, that hereafter it shall
be his general and constant course; I find no ground for it in Scripture, not
can imagine any in reason, especially, if the opinion of some (among whom is S.
Austin De Civit. Dei. lib. 20. cap. 16. -- Neque ego illi detrabere aufim
Haerentem capiti multa cum laud coronam. Horat. Sermon. lib. 1. Sat. 10.
) be true; that, the earth, after the resurrection (being purged from the state
of mutabilitie and corruption, wherein it now stands) shall lie open with
heaven, and so, be part of the seat of Saints beatified: which is the meaning
of those new heavens, and that new-earth we read of Esaias 65.17.66.22. 2 Pet. 3
13. Revel. 21.1.
; though, I know, some understand them otherwise (...). Evenus.
.

Some again think it to be in the Caves of ^he earth, and Conduits of the
Sea; also the most ^ast and spacious regions ^bove the superficies of ^he
earth: All these put together; fearing else, ^here would not be ^oome enough
for such (...) multitudinous number, ^s shall be turned into it; The number of
fools being infinite Vet. interp. ita legit locum. eccles. 1.15. Stultorum
infinitus est numerus.
.

I remember a story, how Julius Caesar creating diverse new Senators in Rome,
among whom was ^ne Laberius, and sending him into the Senate House ^o take his
place; Tullie, ^s he passed by, gave him this gird, You should sit by me, but
that I should sit too strait Reciperem te nisi anguste sederem. Brusonius, lib.
5. cap. 16.
: alluding to the number of the Senators newly made, which was so great, that
the house could scarce contain them. But there is no such thing in Hell, where
ere it is Stultitiae hoc magis est quam rectae opinionis. Vt Methodius de

As the Poet Ovid. Metamor. lib. 4. fab. 13.
describes it. It is capable of all that come, and never straightened, be they
never so many. Agreeable Quis Poetarum, qui non omnino de prophetarum font

to that of Solomon and the Prophet: the one affirming it to be never full
Pro. 27.20.
; the other that (...) is deep and large Esaias 30.33.
.

Others would have it ^o be, betwixt the upper ^egion of the air, and ^lobe
of the Moon; in ^he sphere and element of ^re: drawn by that axi^me of
Philosophy Erroremque suum quo tue antur habent Ovid. Fast. lib. 1.
, ^ullum violentum perpe^uum. Forasmuch as the ^re of Hell is everlasting, Hell
must either be in the ^roper place of fire, or it cannot be so.

Fire indeed, in its own nature, cannot last ever, ^ut of its proper place;
^et by a Superior and more excellent principle, ^t may: as this fire, being by
the justice of God, his power and providence preserved; which is excellently
laid down Esaias ^0.23. Tophet is ordained of old --, the pi^ thereof, is fire
and much wood, and the breath o^ the Lord -- does kindle i^ Besides; although
the Schoolmen Thom. supplem. 3 ae. quaest. 97. art. 6.
hold, the fire of Hell to be, ejusde^ specici, of the same kind with our fire
both Elementarie and culinari^ or focal: yet the ancient Tertul. Apol. cap. 48.
Orig. hom. 9. in diversos. Hieron. comment. in Job 20.26. Greg. Moral. lib. 15.
cap. 17.
(so far as I find) agre^ in the contrary, that it i^ not; but created by
God of purpose, and created so, as having naturally within it self a divine
subministration of incorruptibilitie; they are Tertullians words.

The Poets fained it to ^e under the earth; equal^ so far distant from ^^e
surface, as heaven is love it -- (...). Hesiod. (...).
.

And surely, that it is under the earth, seems (...) me, an opinion, the ^ost
probable. (For I ^n determine nothing ^ertainly Res est arbitrio non dirimenda
meo. Ovid. Fast. lib. 6. Non nostrum -- tantas componere lites. Virg. Eclog. 3.
: To use S. Au^ins Quod dicimus, fratres, non tanquam certus expono; --
Infernum nec ego expertus sum adhuc nec vos in Psalm. 86.13.
words, What I ^eake, my brethren, I ^e not speak as being cer^^ine; neither I
nor you ^^ve known Hell as yet, and I pray God we ever may.) The most
^robable opinion there^^re I say is; that it is un^er the earth.)

1. Because the Scrip^re seems to intimate as much; calling it Eret^tachtith,
the lower earth* Ezekiel. 31.18. speaking o^ it as a lower place; The way of life
is above to the wise, that he may depar^ from Hell beneath, Prov^ 15.24. But

lib. de Trinit. cap. 14. and 17. inter opera Tertul.
.

2. Heaven being a place of chiefest happiness, Hell of the greatest misery;
without doubt, they are directly opposite, and as far disjoined as may be.
The rich man, Luke 16. saw Abraham a far off, and Lazarus in his bosom. In
inferioribus terrae inferi esse perhibentur, unde and inferi nominati sunt.
Hieron. in Job 26.5. Vnde Inferi appellantur, si sub terris non sunt, merito
quaeritur. Aug. de Genesi ad literam, lib. 12. cap. 33. Inferi eo quod infra
sint Latin appellantur. ibid. cap. 34. Si idcirco Infernum dicimus quia
inferius jacet: quod terra a ^elo est, hoc esse infernus debet a terra. Greg.
dia^og. lib. 4. cap. 42.


3. The name Infernus imports it; so called, quia infra, or inferius jacet,
because it lies under us.

And S. Austin Sicut, secundum corpus, si ^onderis sui ordinem teneant,
inferiora sunt ^mnia graviora; Ita, secundum spiritum, inferiora ^ant omnia
tristiora. de Genesis ad lit. lib. 12. cap 34.
adds another reason, to this effect. As there is Gravitie and Levitie,
heaviness and ^ightnesse, in bodies; so is there answerably sorrow and joy in
spirits; sorrow answering heaviness, Joy ^ightnesse: now in bodies ^he
heaviest are the lowest; therefore in Spirits ^ikewise, the sorrowfullest are
the lowest; and, these being the Damned spirits* by consequence, Hel^ where
they are, the lowes^ place.

3. Follow now the Punishments of them tha^ are in it, shall be turned into it.

Tullie observes, tha^ the Poets, in his time* who writ of Rome, did us^
praeterire calamitatem Sinite hoc loco, Quirites, (Sicut Poetae solent quires
Romanas scribunt) praeterire me nostram calamitatem. Orat. 13. pro lege Manilia.
, to pass by the calamity, where any happened. I cannot do so, in speaking of
Hell; but must tell you the miserable calamiti^ of them that are there* and the
punishments (a^ least some of them) which they endure, (for Non mihi si linguae
centum sint, oraque centum,
Omnia poenarum percurrere nomina possem Virg. Aenoid. lib. 6.
.


^f I had a hundred ^ongues, I could not ex^resse the mall.)

Keckerm. System. Theol lib. 2. cap. 7
The usual distinction (...) into two; by some (...) they are reduced to ^hree
kinds. There is Poe^a damni, poena sensus; and ^oena separationis: The
pu^ishment of Loss; Sense; and Separation.

1. The punishment of ^osse; consisting in their ^eprival of Gods pre^ence, and
the joys un^peakable of Heaven. The ^hilosopher Arist. Physic. sive, de
naturali auscultatione, lib. 1. cap. 7.
puts Pri^ation in the number of natural Principles. It may be called a
Principle her too, being both part, an^ the beginning of their sorrow. They
that obey n^^ the Gospel -- shall be punished -- from the presenc^ of the
Lord, 2 Thessalonians. 1. ^ And S. Bernard Prius Benedicti vocabuntur in regnum, quam
Maledicti in caminum deijciantur ignis aeterni: quo acrius doleant videntes
quid amiserint. Sermon. 8. in Psalm. Qui habitat.
observes the method of the final sentence; that, The Saved shall first be
called into the kingdom^ of GOD, before the Damned be sent into everlasting
fire (It shall first be said, Come ye blessed, before, Go ye cursed:) t^
aggravate their grief by the sight of their loss. For as black compared with
white seems more black (...). Arist. Rhet. lib. 3. cap. 2.
. So the sight of that which ^hey have lost, makes that which they shall
sustain, much more grievous Sic nimirum sibi invicem collatacontraria, suae
quidem utrumque videtur suscepisse augmentum aliquod qualitatis: ut album nigro
si conferas, and hoc candidius, and illudtetrius apparebit. Bernar. d. l.
, to wit,

2. The punishment of Sense; consisting in those actual torments, which ^hey
suffer and endure. Which, as David speaks of Gods works, Psalm. 40.5. or Nestor
of the miseries they suffered at the siege of Troy -- (...); Hom. Od. g
, are more then can ^^e numbered. No punishment ^an be imagined, says Gregory,
which is there want^ing De poenis excogitari non potest, quod ibi non erit.
. You must not expect therefore, I should capi^ulate them all; Non mihi (...)
centum -- as I said before: I will only name ^he chief; dealing with ^he
rest, as Timanthes, in drawing the picture of Agamemnon mourning for his
daughter Iphigenia; who concealed his countenance, because he could not
express in it the greatness of his sorrow Vultum velavit quem digne non
potuit ostendere. Plin. hist. not. lib. 35. cap. 10. Cum patris dolorem se non
posse penicillo exprimere arbitraretur eximius artifex --, velamento vestis os

.

And the first is this; The scorching hear of fire. It is better to enter into
life with one eye, then, having two eyes, to be cast into Hell fire. Mat. 18
9. Go ye cursed into everlasting fire. chap. 25.41. And the rich man, Luke
16, is said to be tormented in a flame. Some have held the fire of Hell to be
no true material, and corporeal fire; But, qualem novit Deus: or else only
that extreme anguish, ^d compunction of Spi^, proceeding from the ^nse and
deep apprehen^n of Gods wrath (the ^rment of which is like ^e burning of fire,
and ^erefore by a Metaphor (...) called;) herein follow^g Damascene Orthodoxae

Well then; the fire of Hell is no Metaphorical thing: but a Material, true,

fire.

Now the pain of fire is great. But, what is our fire, to the fire of Hell? It
was the fond conceit of a Friar, that one might feel it burn seven miles off
(...). Aesop. fab.
.

Demonax the Philosopher being asked, what kind of place Hell was? answered,
When I come there, I Will write thee a letter, and let thee know Percontanti,
qualia putaret esse apud inferos: expecta, inquit, and simulatque; illue
vener^, perliteras tibi significa^o omnia. Krasm. Apotheg. lib. 8.
. And so, if the Friar had been there, or yet so nigh it, we might believe
him. Yet I think with S. Austin, that for vehemency of heat, it exceeds ours,
as far as It does fire that is painted upon a wall. And with S. Bernard, that
one spark of it does more torment, then if a woman should continue in travel,
and the very pangs and ^^roes of child bearing, thousand years together. ^his
is the first punishment per^aining to Sense, ^s I said, The scorching ^eate of
fire.

The second is, Extremity of Cold -- mista cum frigore flamma. Ovid. Metamor.
lib. 1. fab. 2.
, Mat. 8.^2, 13.42, 50.22.13.24.51.^5.30. There shall be weeping, and gnashing
of ^eeth. Weeping; from heat, the pain of fire: gnashing, from Cold: so the
Fathers Haymo in Mat. 8. Remigius in Mat. 13. Hieron. venerab. Bed. Raban.
Maurus in Mat. 24 Greg. hom. 2. in Evang.
. Some collect as much likewise, from the name Tartarus: (...), properly
signifying, to shake and quiver for cold Plutarch. opusc. de primo frigido.
. But, is not this a ^mitigation of their former pain? Cold being (...)
remedy against heat; the rich man Luke, 16. conceived no better cure for his
torment in the flame then that Lazarus should but even dip the tip of hi^
finger in water, and touc^ his tongue to cool it. A^ for this, it is a
parable, and therefore, according to the rule in Schools, no argumentative
Theologia parabolica non est argumentativa.
, being stretched beyond its en^ and scope. And, to the other, Thomas Supplem.
3 ae. q 97. art. 1 resp. ad 3^.
again^ makes answer; that i^ shall be no mitigation of their pain at all; in
regard, it shall not be, by the changing and transmutation of the body from its
former disposition and passion: but, by bringing a new passion upon it, the old
remaining. Which it does, says he, per actionem Spiritualem, by a Spiritual
action; For, by its natural action, being contrary to heat, it quenches it,
and mitigates the pain of it: but, by its Spiritual action (which it has from
the principal Agent, Gods justice, whereof it is the instrument, and whereby
it does agere in corpus, seize upon the body) it does not.

3. The third is Famine and Hunger. Luke 6.25. Woe unto you that are full: for
ye shall hunger. In the 24. of Jeremy Ver. 10.
there are mentioned three grand calamities; (...), Famine, Pestilence, and the
Sword. In the 14 of Ezekiel. Ver. 21.
four; these three and the noisome beast: How much more when I send my four
sore judgments, the Sword, the Famine, etc. And, as it is one of those which
carry account of the greatest punishments: So, neither is it the least among
them. David places the pestilence under it; choosing the one rather then the
other, when they were both put to his option, 2 Samuel 24.13. Jeremy preferres
the sword before it; Lament. 4.9. They that be stain with the sword, are
better then those that be slain with hunger. And Ulysses in Homer, of all
deaths makes it the most miserable; All deaths are miserable, says he: yet the
most miserable of all is to die for hunger (...) Od. m.
.

4. The fourth is Bonds and imprisonment. Mat. 22.13. Take him, -- Cast him
into utter darkness: but what must be done to him before? bind him hand and
foot. 1 Pet. 3.19. Christ by his Spirit preaching to the souls that are now in
Hell, but were alive in the days of Noah (says the learned Scaliger Notis in
N. Test ad locum.
:) is said to preach unto the Spirits in prison. The Angels too that sinned,
being cast down to Hell, were delivered into chains, 2 Pet. 2.4. Diogenes,
being asked, what was the best thing in a man's life? answered, His liberty
Lacit. de vit. Philos. lib. 6.
. And he in the Comedy, compares a captive to a bird in a cage: If once he
get at liberty, he will be past catching again Heg. Liber captivus avis

pose illam possis prendere. Lor. Omnes profecto liberi lubentius samus, quam
servimus. Plaut. in Captivis. act. 1. Scen. 2.
; that condition is so hateful to him. But, more grievous is it to a man, and
miserable he that is put into a loathsome dungeon, without hope of being ever
enlarged or removed. Such is Hell, and such they that shall be turned into it

. Betwixt us and you, says Abraham to the rich man, Luke 16. there is a great
gulf: so as they which would come from you to us, cannot. What is this gulf,
but, (as the Master of the Sentences Lib 4. distinct. 50. f.
expounds it) the justice of God, which holds them in chains, and will never
suffer them to be loosed?

The fifth and last is that Occultum flagellum Poena autem vehemens, and multo
saevior illis, quas and Ceditius gravis invenit, aut Rhadamanthus. Iuven. Sat.

set out, in their fiction of Tityus, who has Vultures feeding upon his liver;
which is mentioned by Lactantius Instit, lib. 7 cap. 21.
: And this is the Worm spoken of, Esaias 66.24. Mark 9.44, 46, 48. Non piguit

Aug de Civit. Dei. lib. 21. cap. 9.


. The greatness of which punishment, tanquam per transennam, we may see in
the shadow and first fruits of it in this life, by those that are distressed in
conscience. Master James Bainam (the Martyr, as he was afterward) having
recanted out of weakness, and abjured his opinions; openly in the Church
(bewailing his fall) among other things, entreated all good Christians rather
to die, then do as he had done: for he would not feel such a Hell again,
(so he termed it) in his conscience, as he did feel before he repented, for
all the worlds good Mr Fox Acts and Mon. vol. 2. page 300. Col. 1. Edit. ult.
; which puts me in mind of S. Bernards Infernus quidam animae rea conscientia
est. Sermon. 4 de assump. beatae Virg.
saying, A guilty conscience is a certain Hell of the soul. And Mr Greenham
In his grave Counsels, and godly observations.
mentions one in the like case, who said, his continual agonies were as great,
as the pains of a man, when the pangs of death are upon him: that he could be
content also, his body should live in burning fire till the day of judgment,
so he might then be assured of Gods favor Heu quantum poenae misero men's
conscia donat! Lucan. lib 7.
. Briefly thus; Dolor corporis, corpus doloris: dolor anima, doloris anima.
Bodily grief is but the Body of grief: the soul of it, is that of the Soul.
The spirit of a man, says Solomon, may sustain his infirmities: but a wounded
spirit who can bear? Pro. 18.14. And so much for the punishment of Sense.

The third is, the punishment of Separation; consisting in their being removed
from the society of Saints and Angels, and conjoined to the company of Devils.
Man, says the Philosopher, is a Sociable creature (...). Arist. Polit. lib. 1.
cap 2.
; that delights in company: and herein is his felicity (...), etc. Idem.
Ethic. ad Nicomach. lib. 9. cap 9.
, to have good company. But this, the Damned are deprived of. True it is; in
this life, good and bad are mixed together Mixta tenax segeti crescere lappa
solet. Ovid de Ponto, lib. 2. Eleg. 1 Genus humanum in duo genera distribuimus:
unum, eorum qui secundum hominem; alterum, eorum qui secundum Deum, viuant.

. Or, as the son of Syrach Ecclus. 33.14, 15.
expresses it, Good is set against evil; the godly against the sinner, and the
sinner against the godly: So there are two and two, one against another. But
hereafter it shall not be so: At the end of the world the wicked shall be
severed from among the just Mat. 13.49.
; When Christ shall say to the reapers, his angels, Bind the tares in bundles
to be burnt, but gather the wheat into my barn Ver. 30.
.

Now, all these punishments are aggravated further from three Circumstances.

The place where;

The manner how;

And the Time or Continuance how long; they must be suffered.

Now hope deferred, says Solomon, makes the ^eart sick, Prove. 13.12. ^f
therefore there were a^y hope of having their punishments terminated, though it
were after many millions of thousands of years, it were a comfort: but when
they are expired, there is never the less behind; they are even as new to
begin again. The Ancients express it thus Alsted. encyclop. lib. 6. Pneumat.
part 4. cap. 7.
; If the Sea were by many parts bigger then it is, and once in every ten
thousand years, biberet ex eo vel unica avicula unam saltem guttulam, A little
bird should drink but a little drop of it, at length it would be exhausted:
Or, if all the world were a mountain, and a Wren, once in every hundred
thousan^ years, should fetch a little of it in her mouth, i^ the end it would
be wasted; But of Eternit^ there is no end ever to be expected. Quanta haec
d^ratio! Consider this y^^ that forget God.

And thus you have the three particulars (thoug^ imperfectly Materia vires

, it might be paralleled with diverse other places: but I proceed unto the
reasons, which are twofold.

In regard of God. Themselves.


That in regard of God is his Justice. For, albei^ he have no pleasure in the
death of the wicked, Ezekiel. 33.11. Neither is willing that any should perish Vt
Agamem. apud Hom. (...).
, 2 Pet. 3.9. Yet, they living impenitently in the transgression of his Law,
and continual breach of his Commandments; (according to the eleventh article
of the Jewish Creed Credo perfecta fide quod Deus -- puniturus sit omnes
quotquot interdicta ejus transgressi suerint. Buxdorf. Synag. Iud. cap. 1. page
4.
, he will not suffer them to go without condign punishment.

But perhaps some will here object, Punishmen^ must be adequated to the fault
-- Adsit Regula pec catis, quae poenas irroget aequas: Nec, scutica, dignum,
horribili, sectere flagello. Horat. Sermon. lib. 1. Sat. 3.

finite and temporary) should be turned unto Hell, there to suffer ^unishments

And first I may say with ^he Apostle Romans 9.20.
, Nay but, o man, who art thou that dis^utest against God? It is not lawful
for mortal creatures to call his actions into question: even a heathen man
could affirm it (...). Theog. ver. 687.
. He gives not account of any of his matters Job 33.13.

2. I might say with S. Austin Adeo summa est justitiae regula Dei voluntas, ut
quicquid vult, eo ipso quod vult, justum habendum sit. De Genesi contra Manich.
lib. 1. cap 3. Quicquid fecerit justum est, and ex hoc quia fecit Deus creed
justum esse. In Psalm. 62. ver. ult.
, that His w^^ is the rule of Justice: So ^ a thing is just, even because he
does or will do it, we^ there no other reason t^ be rendered.

3. But to give so (...) cleerer resolutions (...). Achil. Hom. H. 1.
. Punishment (being a part o^ distributive justice) consists, says the
Philos^pher Arist. Ethic. ad Nicomach. lib. 5. cap. 3.
, in a Geometric^ proportion relating to a^ the circumstances of the crime, but
especially t^^ dignity of the person against whom it is committed. If one
strike magistrate (as afterward he makes instance Ibid. cap. 5.
, it i^ more then if he struc^ an ordinary man, and deserves extraordinary
punishment. Worthily ther^ore shall the wicked be ^djudged to infinite and
^ternall punishment, who ^nne against an infinite ^^d eternal Majesty, which
is, God.

4. They sin too, ^aith S. Austin Homo factus est malo dignus aeterno, qui
hoc in se peremit bonum quod esse posset aeternum. De Civit. Dei. lib. 21. cap.
12.
, against ^n infinite and eternal Good; to wit, Life eternal, which they
con^emne, and wilfully re^use.

5. Their disposition and desire of sinning, says ^. Gregory Quoniam peccator
peccat in Suo aeterno, ideo Deus punit ipsum in Suo aeterno. etc. Dialog. ^^b

, is eternal, (which he calls Their Eternity;) for if they could live
always, they would sin always: and because they sin in their Eternity,
it is just with God t^ punish them in His Eternity.

Suffer me a little, and I will show, what I have yet to speak on Gods
behalf Job. 36.2.
: to use his words whom some Hieron. quaest. Hebr. in Genesis 22. Philippus
Presbyter praef. in Job, and in cap. 32. Rupertus in Genesis 34. Lyra. in Psalm. 9.4
think (not without probability) to be Balaam.

And to all these I add another Solution out of S. Austin De Civit. Dei, lib.
21. cap. 11.
. Even in temporal, and civil Courts of men, few crimes but they deserve
punishment of longer continuance then the Commission of them. To think
therefore that the punishment of sin should be proportionated according to
the time wherein it is perpetrated, what greater folly Non sani esse hominis,
non sanus juret Orestes. Pers. Sat. 3, in fine. -- Dic quae dementia major.
Baptista Mantuan. Eclog. 1.
? Some faults, says that Father, deserve imprisonment, some proscription and
banishment: shall the party peccant be exiled, or remain in durance, no
longer then they are in committing? Mur^her is soon committed; so is
sacrilege, and several other sins: Shall the punishment in respect of time
and continuance be accordingly? Surely no; It is to be measured, as he
concludes, not by length of time, but the greatness of the offense Non
temporis longitudene, sed iniquitatis and impietatis magnitudine.
. And so much for the reason in regard of God.

Those in respect of them selves are Positive. Privative.


For that they Have; or for that they want, and Have not.

That which they have, is their sin and wickedness. Hecuba, the mothe^ of
Paris, dreaming when she was with child, tha^ she brought forth a burning
torch; told it to he^ husband Priamus, wh^ received answer from the Southsayer,
that, H^ whom she bore in he^ womb should be the caus^ of the destruction of
his country Quem in utero geslabat esset causa excidij suae patriae. Not. Com
mythol lib 6. cap. 23. Epist. Parid. ad Helen apud. Ovid inter Heroid. 15.
. Nothing so sure, but the sin which the wicked harbor in their breasts,
will be the cause of their destruction It is an observable plac^ in the 20 of
Job the 16 where Zophar speaking o^ the wicked, says, He shall suck the
poison of aspes^ Some Vetus interp. Xantes Pagninus.
read it, He shall ^^ck the head of aspes, (The ^ebrew word [Rosh] sig^fying
both Caput and ^enenum.) Now what is to suck the head of ^pes? The Aspe or
shee^iper engendring with ^e male, takes his head in ^er mouth, and (being
o^ercome with the plea^re of the act) bites it off; thereby he perishes: after
she has conceived ^re young within her, ^rditatis impatientes per^mpunt
latera occisa pa^ente, not abiding to stay their time, eat out her ^des, and
abortively de^ver themselves; where^y she perishes Plin hist. not. lib. 10.
cap. 62. Pierius Hierogl. lib. 14. cap. 20. Epiph haer. 26 ad finem. Aelian. de
animal. lib. 1. cap. 24.
. And (...) it is with the wicked; though wickedness be sweet in their mouth,
as it is ^ the 12 ver. they comm^ it with greediness and d^light: yet, it is
but as were a Sucking of t^^ head of aspes; they sha^ perish by it, it will b^
their everlasting ove^ throw, and destruction Plainly, Prove. 11.5. T^ wicked
shall fall by (...) own wickedness. Again^ chap. 13.6. Wickedness
verthroweth the sinne^ And again chap. 21.1^ God overthrows the wi^ked for
their wickedness.

Other reasons ther^ are again for that which they want, and have no^ as

1. Because they wan^ Christ. He that has u^ the son has not life, John
5.12. Neither is ^ere salvation in any over, Acts 4.12.

2. Because they want ^ith. He that believes ^^t shall be damned, Mark. 6.16.
Is condemned al^ady Quia certum est, asseritur ut jam praeteritum. Aug. de
agone Christiano. cap. 27.
, John 3.18.

3. Because they want ^e Sanctification and ^olinesse of life, without which no
man shall see the lord, Heb. 12.14. For, ^very tree that brings ^ot forth
good fruit, is ^ewen down and cast into be fire, Mat. 3.10.

Now for Application. And if The wicked shall be turned into Hell:

1. It serves for Conf^tation Nemo non, contrarium ejus quod probaverit,
reprobat. Tertul. advers. Marcion. lib. 4. cap. 15. Non sufficit nohis docuisse
quae pia sunt, nisi pijssima ea esse per id intelligantur dum quae impia sunt
refelluntur. Hilar. lib. 8. de Trinit. fere initio.
. And first (...) those who either deny or have denied, (directl^ too, in
terminis) that ther^ is any Hell at all (...). Evenus.
. (Omitting them who are (...) jusdem farinae, of the sam^ mold, and annihilate
it b^ Consequence, denyin^ the resurrection, the immortality of the Soul or
the like.) So did Cai^ the first wicked man; (among other things,) i^ his
conference with Abe^ (implied in the text Genesis 4 8.
, an^ supplied by some Targum Jonathan and Hierosolymit.
: No^ est judicium, non est judex non est ultio impijs, etc So did Epicurus,
holdin^ it to be but The fiction (...) Poets, and whatsoever (...) spoken of
it, to be under^^^od of this world, and the ^e that we now lead Lactan.
Instit. lib 7. cap 7.
: ^et one of them Lucret. -- Quaecunque Acheronte profundo prodita sunt esse,
in vita sunt om nia nobis. Et post pauca. Haec neque sunt usquam, neque possunt
esse profecto: Sed metus in vita poenarum pro malesactis. de natura rerum, lib.
3. fere in fine.
is ^f his opinion; together ^ith those anonymous ^ereticks in Irenaeus Lib. 5
cap. 26. Quomodo non confundentur qui dicunt Inferos ^idem esse hunc mundum,
etc?
. ^o did the heathen Pai^ms in Tertullians time; ^aking it a laughing mat^r Si
gehennam ^mminemur, -- proinde decachinnamur. Apol. p. 47.
. So did Almaricus ^^d his Sectaries; hol^ng, there is neither Heaven nor Hell:
but he that ^ath the knowledge of ^od, has Heaven within ^^mselfe; and he that
has ^ortall sin, has Hell ^ithin himself; Sicut ^entem in ore putridum, as
a rotten tooth in the head Osiand. Cent. 13. lib. 1. cap. 3.
. So did the holy Father of Rome, Bonifac^ the eighth; which wa^ objected
against him (among other crimes) in (...) Council held at Pari^ under Philip
the Fair Osiand. Cent. 13. lib. 4. cap. 7.
: -- Intestabilis and Sacer esto Horat. Sermon. lib. 2. Sat. 3.


So did his Successor^ in the seat and same impiety Dignum patella operculum.
Erasm. Adag. (...). Melanthius. Hom. Od. ^.
, Paul the third, who lying on his death bed, said he should now make trial
of three things, whereof he had doubted all his life, -- Pudet fari Catoniana,
Chreste, quod faecis, lingua. Mart. lib. 9. Epigr. 28. Grave crimen etiam cum
dictum est leviter nocet. Senec. lib. Proverb.
An anima immortalis, An sit Deus, An Infernus: I fear to English them x. So
does Costerus the Ie^ite Instit. lib. 5.
; holding that Christ by his descension ^to Hell has abolisht it, and turned
it into Para^ise: Something like that ^eresie in S. Austin Haer. 79. Al^a
(haeresis) descendente ad inferos Christo, credid^sse incredulos, and omnes
inde, existimat, liberatos.
of those who held, that Christ descending into Hell, ^ll the damned believed,
and were forthwith set at ^bertie. So do the Fa^ilists Rogers. Art. 5. Prop. 4.
holding there is ^o other Hell then the hor^or of Conscience in this ^ife, by
the sense and apprehension of GODS wrath: much like the opi^ion which S. Jerome
Epist. ad Avitum de error. Orig.
a^cribes to O igen, but how ^ruly I know not. And so ^oe many in these days;
^iving if as it were a mere fable Heu vivunt homines tanquam mors nulla
sequatur, aut velut Infernus fabula vana foret!
and bare flying report.

2. For Confutation o^ the Misericordians (o^ whom S. Austin in hi^ 21. Book
De Civitat^ Dei chap. 18.) who held that (though there be ^ Hell, yet, The
wicked shall not be turned into it. (...) shall indeed be shown them at the
latter day, and they shall be adjudged worthy of it: but by the prayers and
intercession of the Saints, find mercy, and b^ delivered from it; Mercy, as
S. James Chap 2.13.
speaks rejoicing against judgment. You heard before Quid opus est me diutius
in his tempus terere? Cum confutatio ac subverfio facilis (sit) ex praedictis,
etc. Epiph. haer. 32. in fine.
out of Gregory; tha^ the glorified Saints are so addicted to the justice of
God, that they ^nnot compassionate them, ^uch less intercede for them. And the
Master ^f the Sentences Lib. 4. distinct. 50. f.
ob^rves (by Abraham's ^nswer to the rich man, Luke 16. Betwixt us and ^ou there
is a great gulf, etc.) that, although they ^ee them in torments, yet, ^hey
neither pity them, ^or desire their delive^ance.

^. The second use is for In^ructio^; to show the mise^able Coelestis ira quos
premit miseros facit. Senec. Herc. Oetae. act. 2. Scoen. 1.
estate of all wicked ^hen, What though they ^rosper here, and flourish? Their
seed be established ^n their fight; Their hou^es safe from fear; They ^pend
their days in wealth, etc? as Job describes them, chap. 21 or as David, Psalm.
73 They be not in trouble (...) other men, they have man^ then heart can wish?
Thi^ is no true Happiness Nemo malus Foelix -- Iuven. Sat. 4. (...). Asinus
Sylvest. asino domest. Aesop.
(and false happiness, says S. Austin Falsi foelices very infoelices: falsa
foelicitas vera miseria est. Aug. in Psalm 86. ver. ult. Fallax foelicitas ipsa
est major infoelicitas. Idem in Psalm. 130.1.
, is true misery;) for Ad mala servantur no^ moritura: --

Their judgment lingers not, nor does their damnation slumber; their feet at
last shall go down to death, and their step take hold on Hell; it shall be
their portion.

The wicked, says my Text, shall be turned in to Hell.

And in very deed, this is the reason why the supreme disposer of all things,
does suffer them to enjoy such prosperity and outward happiness here in this
world, while his children (to use his words in Job Chap. 36.8.
,) are held in cords of affliction. See it plainly, Psalm. 92.7. When the wicked
spring as the grass, and the workers of iniquity do flourish, it is that
they shall be destroyed for ever. Vt vituli occidendi saginantur, says S.
Gregory Moral. lib. 22.
, They are fed as beasts for the slaughter. It Is folly therefore, as David
deemes it, Psalm. 73.22. to grudge, repine, or envy at it; a thing
nevertheless, which Gods children Obruit ingentes ista procella viros. Ovid.
Fast. lib. 1.
(even the best of them -- Quibus art benigna Et meliore luto finxit
praecordia Titan. Iuven. Sat. 14.
) are prone unto. As we may see in the same David, (otherwise, a man after
Gods own heart) in the third ver. of that Psalm. the 73. I was envious at the
foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. And in Job (the None such of
his time) by his Counterplea with GOD about it, Chap. 21. 7. Wherefore do the
wicked live, become old; yea, are mighty in power? And in that Prophet, who
was sanctified in the womb, by the like, Ierem. 12.1. Wherefore does the way
of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very
treacherously? Is it not better rather to Wish with Origin Ego opto, ut dum in
hoc saeculo sum, visitet Dominus peccata mea; ut ibi dicat etiam de me Abraham,
sicut dixit de paupere Lazaro ad divitem; Memento fili, etc. hom. 8. in Exodus
ad finem.
, that the Lord would visit our sins in this life; that hereafter Abraham may
say concerning us, as he did to the rich man concerning Lazarus; Son,
remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst good things, and Lazarus evil
things, but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented? Or pray with S.
Austin, Hic ure, hic seca, ut in aeternum pareas; Punish me here, that I may
be spared hereafter, and not punished eternally with The wicked, who shall be
turned into Hell?

3. The third and last Use is, for every one that tenders his own salvation,
and would escape the damnation of Hell Ecce quae maneat damnatos poenae
cognovimus: -- Sed quid prodest ista praenosse, si non contingat evadere? Greg.
Mor. lib. 9. cap. ult.
, to enforce Zophar's Admonition upon him, Job 11.14. If iniquity be in thine
hand, put it far away, and let not Wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles,
turning unto God by mature and true repentance.

When the silver cord is loosed, and the golden boule broken, our earthly house
of this tabernacle is dissolved; it will be too late Quando istinc excessum
suerit, nullus iam locus poenitentiae est: hic vita aut amittitur, aut tenetur,
hic saluti aeternae -- providetur Cyprian. tract. 1. contra Demetrian. (...).
Theocrit. Eidyl. d!
. Eccles. 9.10. Whatsoever thine hand finds (...) do, do it with thy ^ight;
for there is no ^orke nor device in the ^rave whither thou go. ^t was a
saying which our ^aviour, says Justin Mar^yr Dialogo cum Tryphone. (...).
, often used to his Disciples; As I find you, so I Will judge you: and S. Austin
Epist. 80. ad Hesychium. In quo quemque invenerit suus novissimus dies, in hoc
eum comprehendet mundi novissimus dies, quoniam qualis in die isto quisque
moritur, talis in die illo iudicabitur.
seems to scholie upon it; Every man, as the last day of his life finds him,
so shall he be found at the last day of the world, and as he dies so shall
he be judged. If he die godly; judgment shall pass upon him, as godly,
among those on the right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, etc. if he die
wicked, judgment shall pass^ upon him, as Wicked, among those on the left,
Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, for The wicked shall be
turned into Hell.

Oh what Lamentation will there then be! more then the mourning of Hadadrimmon
in the valley of Megiddon, or Rachels weeping for her children. Tunc humana
mali pendet commissa propago,
Incipietque suas ad coelum tendere palmas,
Et Dominum tunc nosse volet, quem nosse volebat
^ntea non, quum nosse illis foret utile tempus;
^lic quisque suae, etc.


^aith Tertullian Lib. de Judicio; Domini carm. conscript. cap. 10.
; Then, ^ey'le repent of all their ^isdeeds, desire, then, to ^ow God and fear
him which before they re^sed,) and (lifting up ^^eir hands to heaven) ^ewaile
the time that ever they were wicked; but ^^l in vain: Has not ^od himself
said it (...). Helenus. Hom. Il. e.
? that as he cried and they ^ould not hear, so they ^all cry, and he will
not ^are, Zachar. 7.13. A^aine, Because he called and they refused, he will
^^ugh at their Calami^e, and mock when their fear comes, when distress and
anguish comes upon them, Prove. 1.24. 26, 27.

Our only time and opportunity is, this life New, says the Apostle is the
accepted time, non is the day of salvation 2 Cor. 6.2. -- Nunc, nunc
properandus and acri Fingendus fine fine rota -- Pers. Sat. 3.
; Again Hebr. 4.7. To day if ye will hear his voice, harden no^ your hearts:
he limiteth says he, a certain day. Well then, you will say; If the time of
repentanc^ be only in this life, s^ I repent before I die, it i^ sufficient.
But wilt tho^ know, O vain man, tha^ though God has promise^ pardon to the
penitent, y^^ has he not promised, T^ ^^row, to the sinner that (...) off his
repentance, as it ^n S. Austin Noli dicere, Cras me convertam, cras Deo placebo
--. verum quidem dicis, quia Deus conversioni tuae indulgentiam promisit, sed
dilationi tuae diem crastinum non promisit. in Psalm. 145.8. Qui enim
poenitententi promisit indulgentiam, dissimula^ti diem Crastinum non
spospondit. Prosper. Aquit. lib. Sentent. ex ^gust. Sent. 7.
. The Hewes have a saying Schub iom echad liphne ^echa Alsted. Lex. Theol cap.
9.
, ^ent the day before thy ^^h: meaning that a ^n should repent pre^tly, in
regard, for ^ght he knows, that ^y, is the day of his ^ath, or if not it, yet
the ^^t, so as every day he ^y expect it Ne^ tam divos habuit faventes,
Crastinum ut sit sibi polliceri. Senec. Thyest. act. 3. Scoen.
. Besides, ^e longer thou put it (...), the less able shall ^ou be to do
it: Ne^r did He speak more ^^ly, Qui non est hodie, Qui non est hodie cras
minus aptus erit. Ovid de remed. amoris, lib. 1.
etc

The Devil, says Ve^rable Bid Diabolus in quanto diutius possedit hominem, in
tanto difficilius cum dimittit. Comment. in Luc.
, the long he has possessed a m^ does the hardlier let (...) go. Again, thy
sin^ grow stronger and hevier, and increase in number; which makes t^^ work
and task the gr^ter. There is a story this purpose, in vitis p^trum Lib.
Hieron ascript. at male, and (...).
(but for the tru^ of it I will not dispute of S. Arsenius, who ^ving in the
Wilderne^ of Syria, on a time hea^ a voice speaking un^ him, Go forth and I w^
show thee the works men: So going forth he^ ^aw a black Ethiope with a
hatchet cutting down wood, and making it into a bundle to take up and be
gone: it was so heavy that he could not ^ift it, what does he then, ^ut take
his hatchet again, and cutting down more wood, make it bigger? which while
Arse^ius wondered at, the Angel thus expounds it to him, This man represents
^very impenitent sinner, who to the bundle and bur^hen of his sins, which
^lready is importable, is continually, and daily ad^ing more.

Et jam tempus equum fumantia solvere colla Virg. Georg. lib. 2. in fine.
. It Is time we had done. Only one thing Sed tamen hoc dictis adjungo prioribus
unum. Ovid de Ponto, lib. 3. Eleg. 1.
is to be observed further in my Text (which I will but name:) that the
original word Iashubu.
does signify, to be re^turned, The wicked shall be returned into Hell.

The reason is, as Bellarmine In locum.
would have it, because they came from Hell (For God made man^ righteous, but
the Devil made him wicked: You ar^ of your father the Divel^ John 8.44.) and
therefore may be said to be Re-turned thither. But the bar^ and naked truth, I
take rather to be this; a Compound put for a Simple, ^eturn'd for Turned, which
usual among the He^rewes: So to ascend and ^scend, signify some^mes simply to
go and love from one place to another. Iephta's daugh^r, Judges 11.37 says
she ^till go down Iarad, descendit.
to the ^ountaines; The men of ^udah went down to the ^p of the rock, chap.
15.11. And Ios. 7.24. it is said ^^at Joshua with the Israe^tes took Acham, and
his ^ons and daughters, and ^rought them (vaijagnalu, ^ade them to ascend
Gnalah, ascendit.
) in^o the valley of Achor.

I will conclude my Sermon therefore at this ^ime, as Chrysostom concludes his
74 Sermon, Nolite gehennam incendere; nolite ignem inextinguibilem vobis
praeparare: Respiciamus, ut oportet, ad futura, oculorum lippitudine diligenter
detersa; ut and hanc vitam honest ac pie peragamus, and futuris bonis
potiamur, gratia and misericordia, etc.
o^ Homily upon Matthew (...)

Do not kindle Hell d^ not prepare for your selve^ the inextinguible (the
unquenchable) fire: Let a^ look, as we ought, to the which is to come, the
di^nesse of our eyes being diligently wiped away, that (...) may pass this
life both p^ously and honestly, and hereafter enjoy those good things which God
has prepared for them that lov^ him, by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ.

The title and inscrip^ion of S. Mathewes gospel is a Book; the Contents or
subject of that book is a Generation: the subject of that generation is se^
forth first by his names the one of nature, the other of office; so
di^^inguished by some: though indeed they be both names of office Traxit ab

David, the son of Abraham.

would have Book here to signify a Catalogue, Rehearsal, or Enumeration: and
so not ^o be the title of the whole history; but only of the Genealogy
insu^ng in the chapter. I rather think with Erasmus Annot. in locum.
; that S. Matthew begins his narration after a prophetical manner: the
Prophets usually beginning their books with the title; The vision of Isaiah
the son of Amos, The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, to whom the
word of the Lord came, etc. Yet says Theophylact In locum.
, he calls it not, as they, a vision, or The word of the Lord; but merely and
simply a Book. For first They, spoke to the unbeleeving, hard-hearted,
rebellious and disobedient; therefore backed their sayings with divine
authority, to procure the more reverence, and avoid contempt: He, to the
obedient and believing, and had no such need. 2. They, had those things which
they declared, revealed to their minds by the secret and inward inspiration of
the Spirit; therefore called ^^em visions: whereas he, ^ing corporally present,
(...) conversant with Christ the flesh, sensibly both ^ard and saw him act ^^d
speak that which ^ee relates; so that Fa^er.

Now, why would God ^ave the history of his ^onnes incarnation (with ^he rest
of his Word) ^ritten in a book?

A question which (as ^inon speaks in the Poet (...). Tryphyod. de Ilij
excidio.
) (...) am most willing to resolve; and the reasons (...) may be these;

1. That the Church, and we her children, night have a more cer^aine rule, as
well for ^octrines of faith, as matters of practice an^ good life Quadruplex
est effectus sacrae scripturae, sci: docere veritatem, arguere falsitatem;
quantum ad speculativam: eripere a malo, and inducere ad bonum; quantum ad
practica^. Thom. Aquin. in 2 Timothy 3. lect. 3.

1. For doctrines of fait^ If they speak not acco^ding to this Word, there

whether those things were so that Paul had preached, Acts 17.11.

2. For matters of pra^ise and good life. As ^any as walk according to ^is
rule, peace be on them, ^al. 6.16. This is the way, ^alke ye in it, Esaias 30.21

You see there have been ^ivers Falls Christ's, which ^ have collected out of any
little reading: and no ^uestion but others better ^ers't in stories and

how should she discover the Coven and prestigious impostures of such, but by
the Written Word? All things that were prophesied before of the Messiah and

, he only must be the Christ, that Savior and Messiah. Hence it is that his
Historiographers, the Evangelists, when they relate any thing, which he did or
suffered, cite the Scripture which foretold it; This was done that it might be
fulfilled which is written. Hence it is that to his two disciples going to
Emaus (one of them is named in the text, Ver. 18.

prophecy, etc, observes that the word written is said to be more sure then a
voice from heaven; whereof in the former verse. If Christ himself should
speak ^om heaven to us, as he ^id some times before the ^criptures were

that? for unbeleevers, who ^re always ready to con^radict him, and detract

they were both pious and profitable; yet, as I said b fore, not Testamentarie,

aforetime, was written for our learning, Romans 15.4. The Philosopher affirms,

2. Teaching the Church to answer God in this his care, by her reciprocal care
in keeping and preserving it from corruption. For this cause she is called The
pillar of the truth, 1 Timothy 3.15. Not architectonice, as the Papists would, as

, for it upholds her rather she being built upon it, Ephesians. 2.20. but
ministerialiter; because she is the publisher and preserver of it. The word
being taken ratione forensi: as in Law-courts and places of common justice,
there are pillars, upon which when Edicts are made, being writ in Tables, they
may be hung to be openly read of all. The ancient Jews were very zealous this
way, it being, says Josephus Apud nos autem positam legem divina voluntate,

3. Exhorting every Christian to get it. I will not say with Chrysostom
Quemadmodum arma regalia reposita, etiamsi nemo fuerit qui possideat, tamen,
ijs qui habitant in aedibus, multam praebent custodiam ac tutamen, dum neque
latrones, neque parietu^ perfossores, neque alius quispia^ sceleratoru^ audet
eam aggredi domum: sic ubicunque fuerint libri spirituales (Apostoloru^ ac
Prophetaru^) illino omnis expellitur vis diabelica, etc. hom. 3. de Lazaro.
, that, the Bible of it self does expel wicked spirits, so as the devil has
no power in that place or house where it is; but, without question, great is
the comfort that accrews, and benefit redounding by it. Blessed are the times
wherein we live, that it may be procured easily, and purchased at so small a
rate. It was once About the year 1518 at the beginning of the reformation.
here in England when Bibles were so scant, that one was usually sold for five
marks or more: and poor people that wanted money, were glad to buy pieces,
giving such commodities for them as they had; among the rest, the Epistle of
James, (which yet is but a little one, containing only 5. chapters) was sold
for a load of hay, as Mr. Fox Acts and Mon. Vol. 2. page 32. col. 1. Edit. ult.
relates. The word of the Lord was precious in those days.

And fourthly, being gotten, to read it. What are Books for but to be read

But some perhaps will object; I am not book learned, and cannot read, as
those in the Prophet Esaias 29.12. To which I answer, that, notwithstanding, God
has given them ears to hear it read. It is memorable which Mr. Fox Acts and
Mon. Vol. 3. page 757. Col. 1.
again reports, of a poor woman in Darbishire named Joan Waste, who being
blind, and having nothing to live on but her handlabour; yet spared so much as
would buy a testament: and because, by reason of her blindness she could not
read her self, she hired others with money to read unto her; covenanting
with them before, how long together, or how many chapters they should read, at
such a rate. And of Rawlins White Acts and Mon. Vol. 3. page 218. Col. 1.
, a fisherman in Wales; who in regard he could not read himself, caused a
little boy that was his son, every night after supper, to read some part of
the Scripture to him: by which means (with the working of Gods Spirit) he was
converted, and afterward became a constant martyr. Reading is of more effect
then by many it is taken for. You see what it wrought in him. The same author
Acts and Mon. Vol. 2. page 294. Col. 1.
relates too of John Tewkesbury, Leather-seller in London, that he was
converted by reading of the Testament translated by Tindall. Mr. Bilney
(Blessed S. Bilney, as Latimer used to called him Acts and Mon. Vol. 2. page

; insisting largely upon the first part of my Text. In those which follow I
shall be more brief, that I may not transgress the limits of time.

The subject of The book is a Generation. And why does the Evangelist call his
book, The book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, seeing he handles not his
Generation only, but manner of life, miracles, sufferings, death,
resurrection, and ascension also? Chrysostom Hom. 2. in Mat.
answers; because his Generation is the root; the head, the fountain, and
beginning of all these. Yet Remigius In locum.
says, he calls it, The book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, in allusion
to that which is written, Genesis 5.1. The book of the Generation of Adam: that he
might oppose one book to another, and the new Adam to the old; because the one
restored what the other corrupted Omnes Generationes [Toldoth] in sacra
Scriptura diminutae sunt (cum puncto loco literae penult.) praeter duas quae
plenarie scribuntur; sci: Istae sunt generationes coeli and terrae, Genesis 2.4.
Istae sunt generationes Pharez, Ruth 4.18. In quo ostenditur, quo licet in
primordio, omnia creata fuerunt secundum plenitudinem atque perfectionem; tamen
quia peccavit Adam diminuta sunt atque corrupta, and non revertentur ad decente
dispositione donec veniat filius Pharez i.c. Christus. Paulus Burgen. e Rabbi
Salmai, addit. 2. ad Lyra. Postil. in. Romans 5.
. But, who shall declare his Generation? Esaias 53.4. We must not think, says
S. Jerome Comment. in Mat. ad hunc locum.
, the Evangelist to be contrary to the Prophet; as though he begun to
declare that which the other says is impossible: in regard the Prophet
speaks of his divine generation, whereby being God of the substance of the
Father, he was begotten before the worlds; S. Matthew of his humane, whereby
being Man of the substance of his Mother, he was borne in the world. Or admit
that the Prophet speaks of his humane and temporal Generation; its ineffable
too, says Chrysostom Hom. 2. in Mat.
: so great a mystery, God incarnate. Or, Who shall declare his generation?
that is, But a few, says Remigius In hunc locum Mat.
, Matthew and Luke only Vel duo vel nemo --. Pers. Sat. 1. in princip.
.

The Generation of Jesus Christ (whereby, being the eternal Son of God, he
was in time borne of a woman, and became Man) is here, you see, asserted in my
Text.

Which makes good that saying of Paris in the Poet (trulier spoken then he was
aware of;) The gods, coming down from heaven, become men's guests, doing much
service many times, and diverse good offices for them, though they themselves
be immortal -- (...). Coluthus de raptu Helenae.
. The enemy of mankind, Satan, had not been justly or truly overcome, had he
not been overcome by Man. 2. God and man being separated, could not be united
again, or reconciled together, but by him that participated of both natures. 3
Our adoption so requiring; for how should man be made the Son of God, if God
had not been made the son of man? 4. So requiring too the justice of God;
Man having sinned that Man should satisfy. All which reasons are laid down by

Creed Credo perfecta fide quod Messiah ille veniurus ad huc sit. Buxdorf. Syn

, I believe with a perfect faith that the Messiah is yet to come. Yet many
(because he stays so long, and all ^he Prophesies are fulfilled, being
convict in their consciences) confess he is Borne; but somewhere lies hid, and
will not appear, by reason of their sins. Some of them say, he stays in
Paradise, being tied to the hair of the woman: for which they allege that in
Cant. 7.5. Thine head is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple,
the king is held (or bound) in the galleries. Others say he lies at Rome under
the gate of the City, among the leprous, and otherwise diseased: alleging for
it that in Esaias 53.4. He has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows, we
esteemed him smitten, etc Buxdorf. Syn. Jud. cap. 36. page 516.517. Lyra. in
Esa. 66.7.
. No marvel if the Apostle would not have us ignorant, that blindness is

2. To avoid and eschew sin. It Is a sweet passage in William of Lions; that
now since hrists incarnation, man has more reason to avoid it, and preserve
himself pure from it then before: great reason had he before, in regard of the
dignity of his nature, being created after Gods own image; but much more now,
in regard humanity is inseparably conjoined to divinity. Before, man was made
after the image and similitude of God: now, God is made after the image and
similitude of man, ((...), in the likeness of men, Phil. 2.7.) whereby his
nature is higher exalted Demonstravit nobis Deus quam excelsum locum inter

some, which signifies, vir, a man; because he was man. From the name of God,

son of Sirach; and Jesus surnamed Iustus, Colos. 4.11. But either they had
the name without the thing; it being imposed on them by custom, as other
names, at the will of their parents: or else, they were temporal Saviors,
delivering only from outward misery, corporal bondage, slaverie and
servitude: or types Dum Mosi successor destinaretur Auses filius Nave,

Son of God a Savior.

The Use may serve

1. For Instruction; to show that of our selves we are no better then Lost. The
Son of man is come to seek and to Save that which was lost, Luke 19.10, See
how they relate one unto the other: and you were, says S. Peter, as sheep
going astray, but are now returned unto the shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

; which signifies, perditi, lost Of Shamad, Ferdidit.
: whereas they are saved by him, being indeed lost without him.

2. To bind up the brokenhearted, and preach good tidings unto such as groan
under the burden of sin -- Quos diri consciafacti Men's habet attonitos, and
surdo verbere caedit, Occultum ^uatiente animo tortore flagellum. Iuven. Sat.

, giving unto them the oil of joy for mourning. Oleum effusum nomen tuum,
says the Spouse in the Canticles (1.3.) Thy name is as ointment poured forth.
Christ is Jesus, a Savior; and who is he that condemns, or shall lay any
thing to our charge? Does Satan like a sturdie sergeant take me by the throat,
and bid me pay what I owe to the justice of God? here is my counterpledge and
surety, who, in regard of my own inabilitie, will do it for me. This was it
that made Mary's Spirit rejoice, Luke 1.47. (for she was more happy, says S.
Austin Beatior Maria percipiendo fidem Christi, quam concipiendo carnem
Christi. lib. de sancta virginitate, cap. 3.
, in bearing him in her heart by faith, then in her womb by conception:) and
this was it that revived the heart of old Simeon, so as he desired no longer
to live; Lord, now let thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have
seen thy salvation. He is called, says Irenaeus Agnitio salutis est agnitio
filij Dei; qui and Salus and Salvator, and Salutare vere and dicitur and est,

3. For Confutation; of those who deny he is a Savior. So the blaspheming

Christum a Salvatore. Vt de Valentin.

Concerning the lawfulness of outward adoration by bowing of the knee at this
holy and salutiferous name, this name above every name, I purposely omit to
speak; not intending to write Iliads after Homer. It is largely handled by
that learned Prelate, and reverend Father, the late Lord Bishop of Winchester
Bishop Andrews, Sermon 9. of the resurrection, upon Philip 2.8, 9, 10, 11.

; Christ is not so much a name as an appellation, signifying anointed. From
(...), ungo. Which the heathen of old not understanding, pronounced it
Chrestus: calling his followers and professors also, Chrestians, not
Christians; as I read again in Tertullian Apolog. cap. 3.
, and Lactantius Institut. lib. 4. cap. 7.
.

Now there were three sorts of persons anointed in the old Testament Non solum
Pontifices urguento Chrismatis apud Hebraeos consecrabantur, verum and Reges
--. Sed and in Prophetarum ordine invenimus nonnullos simili modo consecratos,
etc. Eusebius. hist. Eccles. lib. 1. cap. 1.
. 1 Kings; so we read of Saul, David, Solomon, and others. 2. Prophets; So
we read of Elisha, 1 Kings 19.16. 3 Priests; so is the commandment, Exodus
^9.7. And the anointing of the Savior of the world, was to signify this his
threefold office Filius Dei quia verus Rex, and verus Pontifex, and verus
Propheta, ideo vere and Christus nominatus est: Cujus nominis per eos quos
supra enumeravimus, pontifices, Prophetas, and Reges, typus and imago
praecesserat. Eusebius. ibid.
: of being King, to rule and govern his Church; a Prophet, to teach and
instruct it; and Priest, to intercede and offer sacrifice for it; not bulls and
goats, but his own self, bearing our sins, as S. Peter speaks, in his own
body upon the tree. Nor yet was he anointed with material, typical, and
natural oil Christus non humanis opibus quaesita sumit urguenta, sed Paterno
spiritu infusus and unctus, Christus efficitur. Eusebius. ubi supra.
, so we read not in Scripture: But first, destinated and set apart to these
offices, which, as an honorificall relation, say the Schoolmen, does nothing
derogate from the Majesty of his divinity; secondly, received the gifts of
the Spirit into his manhood, whereby he was enabled to execute, discharge and
undergo them. So we read Acts. 10.38. that he was anointed with the holy
Ghost, and with power; Again, Hebr. 1 7. Psalm. 45 7. with the oil of
gladness, by which is understood, The holy Spirit Olco laetitiae in sacris
voluminibus, intellectu mystico Spiritus sanctus designatur. Eusebius. d.l.
Vng^oleo laecitiae non aliud intelligitur quam spiritu sancto repleri. Aug. lib
2. de incarnatione verbi. fere initio.
and that too he is said to be anointed with, praeconsortibus, above his
fellows. Above them two ways. 1. Intensive. They receiving it, in measure,
Romans 12.^. He, without measure, John 3.34. He, in fullness, Col. 2.9. They,
of his fullness, John 1.16. 2 Extensive; Melchisedec was King and Priest,
David, King and Prophet; Moses, so Samuel, Priest and Prophet: never any, King,
Priest, and Prophet, but only he.

, I might here (besides other uses) detect the impiety of them who (in effect)
deprive him of all these offices.

propitiatory sacrifice, for the quick and dead, for sins, punishments,
satisfactions, and other necessities, let him be Anathema.

3. For his Prophetical office. 1. By advancing their traditions to the same
dignity and authority with the Scripture. They divide the word into written,
and not written (even as the Jews have their Thorah Shebictab, and Thorah

The Son of David, The Son of Abraham.

Erasmus In locum.
notes that these words admit of a twofold meaning, either thus, The son of
David who was the son of Abraham: or may be applied to one and the same
person (which is prope^ in this place) to wit, Jesus Christ, who was the Son
both of David and Abraham. Now why are these two Fathers mentioned alone by
themselves, being singled and culled out as it were, from all the rest? Hereof
Chrysostom (or whoever was the author operis imperfecti in Matthaeum Hom. 1.
) gives two reasons. 1. Because the promise of Christ was made principally,
chiefly and most clearly to them. (As for Abraham; that in his seed all the
families of the earth should be blessed, Genesis 22.18. which the Apostle
expounds of Christ, Gal. 3.16. And for David; that of the fruit of his body he
would set upon his throne, Psalm. ^32.11. which S. Peter again expounds of
Christ, Acts 2.30.) 2. To show that the several dignities and prerogatives of
these two p rsons, by an original right did descend upon Christ. David was
King and Prophet, but no Priest; Abraham Priest As appears by his sacrificing,
Genesis 15
and Prophet Genesis 20.7.
, but no King: Christ, the son of both, all three, King, Priest, and Prophet,
their particular privileges being concentrick in him, -- Et quae divisa beatos
Efficient, collecta tenet -- Claudian. de laudibus Stiliconis, lib. 1.
.


A third is rendered by S. Jerome Argumento in Matthaeum.
; because Abraham was the first that received Circumcision, David the first
King whose election was according to Gods own heart (for Saul was chosen by
reason of the clamor, tumult and importunity of the people:) and so to show
(as Aquinas 3^. quaest. 3^ art. 2. corp. art.
adds,) that, Christ was sent, for salvation, both to the Circumcision of the
Jews, and election of the Gentiles. 2. It may be demanded, why David is put
before Abraham, The Son of David, the son of Abraham, and not rather, the
son of Abraham, The son of David, seeing Abraham was before him? First in
general I may say out of that learned Prelate Bishop Andrews Sermon 4. of the
Nativitie; upon Gal. 4.4, 5. page 29.
, before mentioned, that, in the idiome of the Scriptures, it is usual, two
things which are to be resumed again being set down, to place that last,
(without respect to the order of time In Scripture non est prius and posterius.
Proverbium Rabbinicum.
,) which is to begin the narration insequent; so here, The son of David, The
son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac, etc: but of this likewise in particular
Chrysostom Hom. 2. in Mat.
gives two reasons. 1. Because David was a King; and therefore to be preferred
as the more worthy and honorable -- (...). Telem. Hom. Od. a.
person. 2. Because he was more talked of among the Jews, being of later time,
and fresh in their memories; and though God made the same promise to both; yet
that to him, as more new, was more celebrated, the other, as more ancient,
silently pretermitted. Hence (as he goes on) they usually called him, not The
son of Abraham, but, The son of David, ( Mat. 9.27.15.22.20.30.21.9.22.42:)
and had an ordinary saying amongst them, Does not Christ come, etc. John 7.42.

The Use may serve

1. For Confutation; Use.
of those again who held that he brought his body with him from heaven. So
did the Apelletians, Valentinians, and Eutychians, as you heard. This very
argument of being The Son of David, The Son of Abraham, Tertullian Ipse
Matthaeus -- ut nos originis Christi carnalis compotes faceret, ita exorsus
est: Liber geniturae Jesu Christi, filij David, filij Abraham --. Qui haec
legimus and credimus, quam debemus and possumus agnoscere in Christo carnis
qualitatem? utique non aliam quam Abraham --; nec aliam quam David. Lib. de
carne Christi, cap. 22.
urges against that heresy.

2. For Instruction; doing us to wit, that God is faithful to perform all and
every of his promises -- Sanctus haberi, Justitiaeque renax, factis, dictisque
meretur. Juven. Sat. 8.
. If he say to Abraham, that In his seed all the families of the earth shall
be blessed, and to David, that, of his seed he will set upon his throne: in
the fullness of time, according to his promise Acts 13 23.
, shall be raised unto Israel, a Savior Jesus, The Son of both. He deals
not with us, as Penelope in Homer Od. b and n.
did with her suitors, (...).
-- (...).


Promised every one, put them all in good hopes but meant no such matter, never
intended to be as good as her word: has he said, and shall he not do it?
has he spoken, and shall he not make it good? Numb. 23 19.

I could easily here enlarge my self -- Consumere longa loquendo Tempora --
Ovid. Trist. lib. 5. Eleg. 13. (...). Aeneas. Hom. Il. ^.
: but, as S. Bernard concludes Aiebat Scaurus, non minus magnam virtutem esse
scire desinere, quam scire dicere. Senec. declam. lib. 9. declam. 5.
, his 23d Sermon upon the Canticles Sufficiant quae dicta sunt; ne in fastidium
veniant ea quae proferuntur ad laudem and gloriam Domini nostri, etc.
,

Let this suffice; lest it should be irksome what is spoken to the praise and
glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is God above all, blessed for ever.
