By the King.
His Majesty's offer of Pardon to the Rebels now in Arms against Him.
WHereas an Actual and Open Rebellion is raised, and several Armies marching
against Us, under the Command and Conduct of Robert Earl of Essex, and other
persons under his Commissions and Authority, who falsely pretend that what they
do, it by virtue of Our Authority, and for Our Service, and so seduce many of
Our weak Subjects from their duty and Allegiance, into this horrid and odious
Rebellion against Us; We do therefore declare the said Robert Earl of Essex,
and all such who by any Commission under him have leavied, or do command any
Soldiers, to be guilty of High Treason, and that this Rebellion is raised to
take away Our life from Us, To destroy Our Posterity, To change the blessed
Protestant Religion established by the Laws of the Land, To suppress the Law
of the Kingdom, and to take away the Liberty of the Subject, and to subject
both to an unlimited Arbitrary Power. And We do therefore will and command all
Our loving Subjects upon their Allegiance, and their Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy, that they apprehend the said Earl of Essex, and all such who by
virtue of any Commission under him have leavied, or do now Command any
Soldiers in any places of this Kingdom as guilty of High Treason. And to any
common Soldiers so raised, We do grant Our free and general Pardon, as to
Persons seduced by the cunning and falsehood of the Authors of this Rebellion,
if such Soldiers shall disband within six days after the publishing of this
Our Proclamation, so they commit no Hostile Act in the mean while against Us.
And if such Soldier or Soldiers shall within that time apprehend and bring
before Us, or any Officers of Our Army, the bodies of any of the Commanders or
Officers now in Rebellion against Us, he and they besides their Pardons, shall
receive such liberal rewards by Pensions or otherwise as their several
services in respect of the qualities of the Persons so apprehended shall
deserve. And if any Commander or Officer of any of the Armies now in Rebellion
against Us, shall within four days after this Our Proclamation published,
being convinced in his Conscience of his damnable offense against God and Us in
assisting this odious Rebellion, return to his Allegiance, and repair to Our
Army, and commit to Hostile Act in the mean while against Us, We shall not
only pardon him, but so far employ him as his quality and demeanor shall
deserve; Except all such persons whom We have before excepted in Our
Declaration of the twelfth of the last August. And We do hereby require all Our
loving Subjects of what Degree or Quality soever, upon their Allegiance, and as
they tender the cause of God, (the Protestant Religion being invaded, and
threatened to the rooted up by Anabaptists, Brownists, and Atheists) of Us and
Our Posterity, (Our life being sought after by this Rebellion) and of
themselves (the Law and Liberty of the Subject being in apparent hazard to be
subjected to an Arbitrary Lawless Power of a few Schismatic, Factious and
Ambitious persons) to assist Us in person, or with the Loan of Money, Plate and
Horses in this Our great necessity.

And We do further declare to all Our loving Subjects, That as We have and
shall take all possible care to prevent the sufferings of Our good people by
the Soldiers of Our Army, so whatever pressures shall unavoidably fall upon
them, by reason of the violence offered unto Us, in seizing and detaining Our
own Money and Revenue from Us, We do promise in the word of a King, to satisfy
them for the same as soon as God shall enable Us. And the better to encourage
Our good Subjects to aid and assist Us in this Our necessary defense, to which
their duty to God and Us obliges them, We do declare, That whosoever shall lose
his life in this Service, the Wardship of his Heir shall be granted by Us
without Rent or Fine to his own use, And We shall hold Our Self obliged to take
all possible care for the Support, Relief, and Protection of all their Wives
and Children, who shall have the hard fortune to die in this Service.

Given at Our Court at Edgehill, this 24 day of October, in the eighteenth
year of Our Reign.
Imprinted at London by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most excellent
MAJESTY: And the Assigns of JOHN BILL. MDCXLII.
