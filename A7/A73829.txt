A new Ditty, showing the wonderful Miracles of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, which he did while he remained upon earth.
To the tune of Triumph and Joy.
depiction of Last Supper

When Jesus Christ was twlue years old,
as holy Scriptures plainly told,
He then disputed brave and bold
among the learned Doctors;
Who wondered greatly at his wit,
As in the Temple he did sit:
For no man could compare with it,
his wisdom was so heavenly.
Then praise the Lord both high and low,
Which all these wondrous works does show,
That we to heaven at length may go,
where he in glory reigns.
At thirty years he then began
To rreach the Gospel unto man,
And all Judea wondered than,
to hear his heavenly Doctrine:
Such works he did as made them muse,
Among the proud hard-hearted Jews,
Yet evermore they did refuse
to take him for their Savior.
Then praise, etc.
For first of all by power divine,
He changed water into wine,
When at a marriage he did dine,
which made the people wonder:
Moreover with seven loaves of bread,
Seven thousand men he fully, fed,
Whereby his glory far was spread,
throughout the Land of Jury.
Then praise, etc.
And by his glorious power and might,
Unto the blind he gave their sight,
For which the Jews bore him a spite,
who sought for to destroy him.
The man which was both deaf and dumb,
Which never heard nor spoke with tongue,
By Christ was healed when he did come:
whose praise he then pronounced.
Then praise, etc.
The woman that was grieved sore,
With an issue of blood twine years and more,
Unto her health he did restore,
in a minute of an hour:
The Captains man that sick did lie,
Our Savior healed presently,
Although he never came him nigh,
his words alone did help him,
Then praise, etc.
Likewise he healed the Lepers ten,
Whose Bodies were most filthy then,
Yet none but one did come again,
him humble thanks to render:
And he that sick of the Palsy lay,
With shaking joints full many a day,
The Lord to heal him did not stay,
but straight his will fulfilled.
Then praise, etc.
The halt and lame that could not go,
But still remained in great woe,
Our Savior Christ did pity show,
and make them whole and lusty:
The man that was with Devils possessed,
And never lived in peace and rest,
By Christ his Word at length was blessed,
and they were clean cast from him.
Then praise, etc.
The widows son that dead did lie,
When Christ our Savior came not nigh,
He raised to life immediately,
unto her joy and comfort.
Then Mary and Martha made great moan,
Because their Brother was dead and gone,
Our Lord put life in him alone,
and he from grave came running,
Then praise, etc.
And more his heavenly might to show,
Upon the Sea himself did go,
And never none could yet do so,
but only Christ our Savior.
And when the Soldiers with great might
Did seek to take him in the night,
They were not able to stand in his sight,
till he the same permitted,
Then praise, etc.
But yet for all these wonders great,
The Jews were in a raging heat,
Whom no persawsion could entreat,
but cruelly they did kill him:
And when he left his life so good,
The Moon was turned into blood,
The Earth and Temple shaking stood,
and graves full wide did open.
Then praise, etc.
Then some of them that stood thereby,
With voices loud began to cry,
This was the Son of God truly,
without all kind of doubting:
And as they said, it proved plain:
For in three days he rose, again,
Although he suffered, bitter pain.
both heaven and hell h^conquerd.
Then praise, and.
And after that ascended he,
To heaven in glorious Majesty,
With whom God send us all to be,
for evermore rejoicing.
Then praise, etc.
FINIS.
