CHARLES R.

WE are so highly sensible of the extraordinary merit of Our County of
Cornwall, of their zeal for the Defense of Our Person, and the just Rights of
Our Crown, (in a time when We could contribute so little to Our own defense or
to their Assistance; in a time when not only no Reward appeared, but great and
probable dangers were threatened to obedience and Loyalty;) of their great and
eminent Courage and Patience in their indefatigable Prosecution of their great
Work against so potent an Enemy, backed with so strong, Rich, and Populous
Cities, and so plentifully furnished and supplied with Men, Arms, Money,
Ammunition and Provision of all kinds; And of the wonderful success with
which it has pleased Almighty God (though with the loss of some most eminent
Persons, who shall never be forgotten by Us) to reward their Loyalty and
Patience by many strange Victories over their and Our enemies, in despite of
all humane Probability, and all imaginable disadvantages; That as We cannot be
forgetful of so great deserts, so We cannot but desire to publish to all the
World, and perpetuate to all Time the Memory of these their merits, and of Our
acceptance of the same. And to that end, We do hereby render Our Royal
thanks to that Our County, in the most public and most Lasting manner We can
devise, commanding Copies hereof to be Printed and published, and one of them
to be read in every Church and Chapel therein, and to be kept for ever as a
Record in the same, That as long as the History of these Times, and of this
Nation shall continue, the memory of how much that County has merited from Us
and our Crown, may be derived with it to Posterity.

Given at Our Camp at SUDELEY Castle the Tenth of September. 1643.
