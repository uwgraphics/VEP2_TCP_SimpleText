An Account of Their MAJESTY'S FLEET, AND Also of the Turkey Fleet of
Merchantmen, (Homeward-Bound.) In a Letter from Aboard the Royal Sovereign, To
a Friend in LONDON.
17. July. 1691. SIR,
I Had just now the good Fortune of meeting this opportunity to pay my Respects
by this hasty Manuscript, and to give you this following Relation of our Fleet,
and Homeward-bound Turkey Ships.

When our Fleet hovered some small time off the Island of Vshant (as before
from Torbay) I wrote you what flender account then offered.

We made little stay on the Coast, but stood as directly for Cape Clear as
these lasting Westwardly Winds would permit, it lying about 15 Leagues to the
Westward of Kingsaile, the which we made Yesterday, and are just now fair by
it, with 86 Battelling Ships of War, etc. (God be praised) in good order and
health.

Just now to our very great satisfactions, we have a certain Account that 15
Sail of Men of War, two Fireships, and about 80 Merchant Ships arrived on the
second Current at Kingsaile, from Turkey, and other parts of the Mediterranian,
and that they had been the Friday before in sight of the French Fleet (who
sought them) and most fortunately took their Scout, escaping the danger (almost
by a Miracle) in a thick Fog, to the Port abovesaid.

Turveale being crossed in his expectation, through the loss of this Booty, we
conclude is gone toward their own Coast, and will not dare to see us this
Summer, if he can avoid it, for such a Fleet was never seen as we are like to
come home with, I hope, to the great content of all the Nation. I am,

From on Board their Majesty's Ship the Royal Sovereign, S.W.B.S. distant from
Cape Clear, July 8th. 1691. Fair VVeather and little VVind at W.S.W. we are
going to Kingsaile. SIR, Your very Affectionate Kinsman, and humble Servant.

LONDON: Printed for W. Haite. 1691.
