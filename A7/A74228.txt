portrait of Thomas Malet Come Friend, ARRAY your self, and never look,
To prosper in your Di-o-cease your Book
Medale with it less: for you must Arm
If you intend to keep your self from harm:
Vsenow your power only against those
That are the Kingdoms friends (but yet our foes)


portrait of Archbishop Williams Oh Sr. I me ready, did you never he are,
How forward I have been it is many a year,
Toppose the practice dat is now on foot
Which plucks my Pretnren up poth pranch and root:
My posture and my heart does well agree
To fight, now plyd is up: come follow me


portrait of Thomas Lunsford I Will help to kill, to pillage and destroy
All the Opposers of the Prelacy.
My Fortunes are growme small, my Friends are less
I Will venture therefore life to have redress
By picking, stealing, or by cutting throats.
Although my practice cross the Kingdoms votes.
