HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER TO THE PETITION OF The LORDS and COMMONS in Parliament
assembled: Presented to His Majesty at YORK, June 17. 1642.

LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.

To the Kings most Excellent Majesty The humble Petition of the Lords and
Commons in Parliament assembled.
YOur Majesty's most humble and faithful Subjects, the Lords and Commons
assembled in Parliament, have lately received a Petition from a great number of
the Gentry, Freeholders and other inhabitants of the County of York, assembled
there by Your Majesty's Command the third of June, wherein they declare unto
us, That having taken a resolution to address themselves unto Your Majesty in
the humble way of a Petition, for the redress of those Grievances which they
now lie under, they were violently interrupted and affronted therein by the
Earl of Lyndsey, the Lord Savill and others, and notwithstanding all the means
they could use to present their just desires to Your Majesty, yet they could
not prevail with Your Majesty to accept of their Petition; The Copy whereof
they have sent to us, with an humble Desire, That we would take such course
therein as may tend to the Preservation of their Liberties, and the Peace of
the Kingdom; And that we would address our selves to Your Majesty in their
behalf, that by our means their desires may find better acceptance with Your
Majesty; Whereupon, having seriously weighed, and considered the particulars
of those their Complaints and Desires, as they are laid down in their Petition;
And finding that the Grievances they complain of are the increase of the
Miseries formerly sustained by that County (which has well-nigh for three
veers last past been the Tragical Stage of Armies and War) by reason of Your
Majesty's distance in Residence, and difference in Counsels from your great
Council, the Parliament, begetting great distempers and distractions thorowout
the Kingdom, and especially in that County; The drawing to those Parts great
numbers of discontented Persons, that may too justly be feared do affect the
public Ruin for their private advantage; The drawing together of many
Companies of the Trained Bands, and others both Horse and Foot of that County,
and retaining multitudes of Commanders and Cavaliers from other parts; The
daily resort of Recusants to Your Majesty's Court at York; The great
preparations of Arms and other warlike Provisions, to the great terror and
amazement of Your Majesty's peaceable Subjects, and causing a great decay of
Trade and Commerce amongst them. All and every of which particulars are against
the Law, which Your Majesty has made so many and so frequent Professions to
uphold and maintain. And the Lords and Commons finding on the other side their
humble desires to be, That Your Majesty would hearken to Your Parliament, and
declining all other Counsels whatsoever, unite your Confidence to Your
Parliament, and that Your Majesty would not divide Your Subjects joint duty
to Your Majesty, the Parliament and Kingdom, nor destroy the Essence of Your
great Council and highest Court, by subjecting the Determinations and
Counsels thereof to the Counsels and Opinions of any private persons
whatsoever; That Your Majesty having passed an Act, That this Parliament shall
not be dissolved, but by Act of Parliament, Your Majesty would not do any thing
tending thereunto, by commanding away the Lords and great Officers, whose
attendance is necessary thereunto; That Your Majesty having expressed Your
confidence in the affections of that County, You would please to dismiss Your
extraordinary Guards, and the Cavaliers and others of that quality, who seem
to have little Interest or Affection to the public good, their language and
behavior speaking nothing but Division and War, and their advantage consisting
in that which is most destructive to others. And lastly, that in such
Consultations and Propositions as Your Majesty makes to that County, such
may not be thrust upon them as men of that County, that neither by their
fortune or residence are any part of it.

All which their humble and most just desires being according to Law, which
Your Majesty has so often declared should be the Measure and Rule of Your
Government and Actions; And we Your Majesty's most faithful Subjects the Lords
and Commons fully concurring with the Gentlemen and others of the County of
York in their Assurance that those desires of theirs will abundantly redound to
the glory of God, the honor and safety of Your Majesty, the good of Your
Posterity, and the Peace and Prosperity of this Kingdom; we humbly beseech Your
Majesty graciously to hearken unto them, and to grant them; and that you would
join with Your Parliament in a speedy and effectual course for the
Preservation of their Liberties, and the Peace of the Kingdom, which duty, as
we are now called upon by that County to discharge, so do we stand engaged to
God and man for the performance thereof by the trust reposed in us, and by our
solemn Vow and Protestation; And Your Majesty, together with us, stands
engaged by the like Obligation of trust, and of an Oath, besides the many and
earnest Professions and Protestations, which Your Majesty has made to this
Purpose to Your whole Kingdom in general, and to that County in particular;
the Peace and quiet of the Kingdom (as is well observed by these Gentlemen and
Freeholders of Yorkshire in their Petition) being the only visible means
under God, wherein consists the Preservation of the Protestant Religion, the
Redemption of our brethren in Ireland, and the happiness and prosperity of
Your Majesty, and of all Your Dominions.

His MAJESTY'S Answer to the Petition of the Lords and Commons in Parliament
assembled, presented to His MAJESTY at York, the 17 of June. 1642.
HIs Majesty having carefully weighed the matter of this Petition presented to
Him at York on Friday the seventeenth of June, by the Lord Howard, Sir Hugh
Cholmely, Sir Philip Stapleton, Though He might refer the Petitioners to His
two last Declarations, wherein most of the Particulars in this Petition are
fully answered, or might refuse to give any Answer at all, rill He had received
satisfaction in those high Indignities He has so often complained of, and
demanded Justice for; Yet that all the World may see how desirous His Majesty
is to leave no Act which seems to carry the Reputation of both his houses of
Parliament, and in the least degree to reflect upon His Majesty's Justice and
Honor, unanswered; Is graciously pleased to return this Answer:

That if the Petition mentioned to be Presented to both Houses of Parliament
had been annexed to this now delivered to Him, His Majesty might have
discerned the number and the quality of the Petitioners, which His Majesty
has great reason to believe was not in truth so considerable as is pretended:
For His Majesty assures you* That He has never refused any Petition so
attested as that would be thought to be; But His Majesty well remembers, that
on the third of June, when there was upon His Majesty's Summons, the greatest,
and the most cheerful concourse of people that ever was beheld of one County,
appearing before Him at York, a Gentleman (one Sir Thomas Fayrfax) offered in
that great Confluence a Petition to His Majesty, which His Majesty seeing to
be avowed by no man but himself, and the general and universal Acclamations
of the people seeming to disclaim it, did not receive, conceiving it not to be
of so public a nature, as to be fit to be presented or received in that place:
And His Majesty is most confident, (and in that must appeal to those were then
present) that what ever the substance of that Petition was, it was not
consented to by any considerable number of Gentry, or Freeholders of this
County; but solicited by a few, mean, inconsiderable persons, and disliked, and
visibly discountenanced by the great Body of the known Gentry, Clergy, and
Inhabitants of this whole County: And if the matter of that Petition was such
as is suggested in this, His Majesty has great reason to believe it was
framed and contrived (as many others of such nature have been) in London, not
in Yorkshire; For sure no Gentleman of quality and understanding of this
County, would talk of His great Preparations of Arms, and other warlike
Provisions, to the great Terror and Amazement of His peaceable Subjects, when
they are witnesses of the violent taking His Arms from Him, and stopping all
ways for bringing more to Him: And if there were no greater Terror and
Amazement of His Majesty's peaceable Subjects in other places by such
Preparations and Provisions, there would be no more cause to complain of a
great decay of Trade and Commerce there, then is in this place* But His M^ has
so great an assurance of the Fidelity and general Affections of His good
Subjects of this County, (which He hopes will prove exemplar over His whole
Kingdom) that He has great cause to believe, That they do rather complain of
His Majesty's Confidence, and of His Slownesse; That whilst there is such
endeavor abroad to raise Horse, and to provide Arms against His Majesty, and
that endeavor put in execution, His Majesty trusts so much to the Justice of
His Cause, and the Affections of His people, and neglects to provide strength
to assist that Justice, and to protect those Affections.

For any Affronts offered by the Earl of Lindsey, or the Lord Savill to those
who intended to petition His Majesty; His Majesty wishes that both His Houses
of Parliament would have examined that Information, and the credit of the
Informers, with that gravity and deliberation, as in Cases which concern the
Innoceuce and Honor of Persons of such quality has been accustomed, before
they had Proscribed two Peers of the Realm, and exposed them (as much as in
them lay) to the rage and fury of the people, under the Character of being
Enemies to the Commonwealth, A brand newly found out (and of no Legal
signification) to incense the people by, and with which the simplicity of
former times was not acquainted; And then His Majesty has some reason to
believe, they would have found themselves as much abused in the report
concerning those Lords, as He is sure they are in those which tell them of the
Resort of great numbers and discontented Persons to Him, and of the other
particulars mentioned to be in that Petition; Whereas they who observe what
resort is here to His Majesty, well know it to be of the prime Gentlemen of
all the Counties in England, whom nothing but the love of Religion, the care of
the Laws, and Liberties of the Kingdom, besides their Affection to His Person,
could engage into great Iourneys, Trouble and expense, Men of as precious
Reputation, and as exemplary Lives, as this Nation has any, whose assistance
His Majesty knows He must not expect, if He should have the least Design
against Honor and Justice; And such witnesses His Majesty desires to have of
all His Actions.

For the declining all other Counsels and the Uniting His Confidence to His
Parliament, His Majesty desires both His Houses of Parliament seriously and
sadly to consider, that it is not the name of a great or little Council that
makes the Results of that Council just or unjust; neither can the imputation
upon His Majesty of not being advised by His Parliament (especially since all
their Actions and all their Orders are exposed to the Public view) long
mislead His good Subjects, except in truth they see some particular sound
advice necessary to the Peace and happiness of the Commonwealth disesteemed
by His Majesty, and such an instance He is most assured, neither can nor shall
be given, and that they will think it merit in His Majesty from the
Commonwealth to reject such Counsel as would persuade Him to make Himself
none of the three Estates, by giving up His negative voice to allow them a
Power superior to that which the Law has given Him, whenever it pleases the
major part present of both Houses to say, that He does not discharge His trust
as He ought, and to subject His, and His Subjects unquestionable Right and
Propriety to their Votes, without and against Law, upon the mere pretense of
necessity. And His Majesty must appeal to all the World, who it is that
endeavors to divide the joint duty of His Subjects, His Majesty who requires
nothing but what their own duty, guided by the infallible Rule of the Law,
leads them to do, or they who by Orders and Votes (opposite and contradictory
to Law, Cuffome, president and reason) so confound the affections and
understandings of His good Subjects, that they know not how to behave
themselves with honesty and safety, whilst their Conscience will not suffer
them to submit to the one, nor their security to apply themselves to the
other. It is not the bare saying that His Majesty's Actions are against the Law
(with which He is reproached in this Petition, as if He departed from His often
Protestations to that purpose) must conclude Him, there being no one such
particular in that Petition alleged, of which His Majesty is in the least
degree guilty, whether the same reverence and esteem be paid by you to the Law
(except your own Votes be judge) needs no other Evidence, then those many, very
many Orders published in Print, both concerning the Church and State, those
long Imprisonments of several persons without hearing them upon general
information, and the great and unlimited Fees to your Officers, worse then the
Imprisonment, and the Arbitrary censure upon them when they are admitted to be
heard; Let the Law be judge by whom it is violated.

For that part of the Petition which seems to accuse His Majesty of a purpose
to dissolve this Parliament contrary to the Act for the Continuance) by
Commanding away the Lords and great Officers, whose attendance is necessary,
which His Majesty, well knows to be a new Calumny, by which the Grand
Contrivers of ruin for the State hope to seduce the minds of the People from
their affection to, or into Jealousy of His Majesty, as if He meant this way
to bring this Parliament (which may be the case of all Parliaments) to nothing;
it is not possible for His Majesty more to express His affection to, and His
Resolution for the Freedom, Liberty and Frequencie of Parliaments, then He
has done; And who ever considers how visible it must be to His Majesty, that
it is impossible for Him to subsist without the affections of His People, and
that those affections cannot possibly be preserved or made use of but by
Parliaments, cannot give the least credit, or have the least suspicion, that
His Majesty would choose any other way to the happiness He desires for Himself
and His Posterity, but by Parliaments. But for His calling the Lords hither,
or any others absenting themselves, who have not been called, who ever
considers the Cumults (which no Votes or Declaration can make to be no
Tilmults) by which His Majesty was driven away, and many Members of either
House in danger of their lives, the demanding the names of those Lords who
would not consent to their Propositions by Message from the House of Commons
delivered at the Bar by Master Hollis, with that most tumultuous Petition in
the Name of many thousands (among many other of the same kind) directed to the
House of Commions, and sent up by them to the House of Lords, taking notice of
the prevalence of a malignant Faction, which made abortive all their good
Motions; which tended to the Peace and Tranquillity of the Kingdom, desiring
that those noble Morthies of the House of Peers who concurred with them in
their happy Votes, might be earnestly desired to join with that honorable
House, and to sit and Vote as one entire Body, professing that unless some
speedy remedy were taken for the removeall of all such obstructions as hindered
the happy progress of their great endeavors, their Petitioners should not
rest in quietness, but should be enforced to lay hold on the next remedy which
was at hand to remove the disturbers of their Peace, and (want and necessity
breaking the bounds of modesty) not to leave any means unassayed for their
relief, adding that the cry of the Poor and needy was, that such Persons who
were the Obstacles of their Peace, and hinderers of the happy proceedings of
this Parliament might be forthwith publicly declared, whose removeall they
conceived would put a Period to these distractions; upon which a great number
of Lords departing, the Vote in order to the Ordinance concerning the Militia
was immediately past, though it had been twice before put to the Question, and
rejected by the Votes of much the major part of that House. And whoever
considers the strange Orders, Votes and Declarations which have since passed,
to which whosoever wo^ld not consent, that is, with freedom and liberty of
language and reason profess against, was in danger of Censure and
Imprisonment, will not blame Our Care in sending for them, or theirs in coming,
or absenting themselves from being involved in such Conclusions. Neither will
it be any objection that they stayed there long after any Tumults were, and
therefore that the Tumults drove them not away: If every day produced Orders
and Resolutions as illegal as, and indeed but the effects of the Tumults,
there was no cause to doubt the same power would be ready to prevent any
Opposition to those Orders after they were made, which had made way and
preparation for the Propositions of them, and so whosoever conceived himself in
danger of future Tumults (against which there is not the least provision) was
driven away by those which were past; And His Majesty has more reason to
wonder at those who stay behind, after all His Legal Power is Voted from Him,
and all the People told, That he might be with modesty and duty enough deposed,
then any man has at those who have been willing to withdraw themselves from
the place where such desperate and dangerous Positions are avowed; which His
Majesty does not mention with the least thought of lessening the Power or
Validity of any Act to which He has given His Assent this Parliament; All and
every of which He shall as inviolably observe, as He looks to have His own
Rights preserved, but to show by what means so many strange Orders have of late
been made, And to show how earnestly His Majesty desires to be present at, and
to receive Advice from both Houses of Parliament (against whom it shall never
be in the power of a Malignant Party to incense his Majesty) His Majesty
again offers His consent, that both Houses may be Adjourned to another Place,
which may be thought convenient, where His Majesty will be present, and doubts
not but the Members of either House will make a full Appearance; And even the
Intermission which must attend such an Adjournment may not be the least means
of recovering that temper which is necessary for such Debates.

And this His Majesty conceives to be so very necessary, that if the minds
and inclinations of every Member of either House were equally composed, the
License is so great, that the mean people about London and the Suburbs have
taken, that both for the Liberty and Dignity of Parliament, that Convention for
a time should be in another place. And sure how much soever the safety and
security of this Kingdom depends on Parliaments, it will never be thought, that
those Parliaments must of necessity be at Westminster.

His Majesty's Confidence is no less then he has expressed (and has great
cause to express) in the affections of this County, an instance of which
affections all men know, His Guard (which is not extraordinary) to be, and
wonders that such a legal Guard at His own charge, for His Person, (within
twenty miles of a rebellion, and of an Army in pay against Him) should be
objected by those, who for so many months, and in a place of known and
confessed security, have without and against Law kept a Guard for themselves at
the charge of the Commonwealth, and upon that stock of money which was given
for the relief of the miserable and bleeding condition of Ireland, or the
payment of the great debt due to Our Kingdom of Scotland.

For the resort of Papists to the Court his Majesty's great care for the
prevention thereof is notoriously known, that when He was informed two or three
of his intended Guard were of that Religion, He gave especial direction, with
expressions of His displeasure, that they should be immediately discharged, and
provided that no Person should attend on him under that Relation, but such as
took, the oaths of Allegiance and Supremary, that He commanded the Sheriff to
proceed with all severity according to the Law against all Papists that should
come within five miles of the Court, and if notwithstanding this, there be any
Papists near the Court, (which his Majesty assures you he knows not, nor has
heard but by this Petition) He does hereby Command them to depart, and declares
to all Officers and Ministers of Justice, that they shall proceed fleictly
against them according to the Law, and as they will answer the contrary at
their perils.

For the language and behavior of the Cavaliers (a word by what mistake soever
it seems much in disfavour) there has not been the least complaint here, and
therefore it is probable the fault was not found in this County. Neither can
His Majesty imag^^e what is meant by the mention of any men thrust upon them
in such Con^ultations and Propositions as His Majesty makes to this County,
who are neither by there Fortune or Residence any part of it, and therefore can
make us Answer to it.

To conclude, His Majestle assures you He has never refused to receive any
Petition, whether you have or no, your selves best know, and will consider what
Reputation it will be to you of Justice or Ingenuity to receive all Petitions
how senseless and scandalous soever of one kind, under pretense of
understanding the good peoples minds and affections, and not only refuse the
Petition, but punish the Petitioners of another kind, under color that it is
a crime, that they are not satisfied with your sense, as if you were only
trusted by the people of one opinion, to take all pains to publish and print
Petitions which agree with your wishes, though they were never presented, and
to use the same Industry and Authority to keep those that indeed were presented
and avowed from being published (though by Our own Authority) because the
Argument is not pleasant to you; To pretend Impartiality and Infallibility, and
to express the greatest passion and affection in the Order of your Proceeding,
and no less error and misunderstanding in your Judgments and Resolutions.
He does remember well the obligation of His Trust, and of His Oath, and desires
that you will do so too, and your own solemn Vow and Protestation, and then you
will not only think it convenient, but necessary to give His Majesty a full
Reparation for all the scandalls laid upon Him, and all the scandalous
Positions made against Him, and that it is less dishonor to retract errors,
then by avowing to confess the malice of them, and will see this to be the
surest way for the preservation of the Protestant Religion, the redemption of
Our Brethren in Ireland, the happiness and prosperity of your selves and of
all Our Dominions, and of the Dignity and Freedom of Parliament.

FINIS.
