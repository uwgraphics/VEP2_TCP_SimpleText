A PROCLAMATION For Apprehension of Edward Whalley and William Goffe.
CHARLES R.

FOrasmuch as Edward Whalley, commonly known by the name of Colonel Whalley,
and William Goffe, commonly called Colonel Goffe, are, amongst others, by an
Act of this present Parliament, Entitled, An Act of Free and General Pardon,
Indemnity and Oblivion wholly excepted from Pardon, and left to be proceeded
against as Traitors, for their execrable Treasons in sentencing to death,
signing the Instrument for the horrid murder, or being instrumental in taking
away the precious Life of Our late dear Father of Blessed Memory.

And forasmuch as they the said Edward Whalley and William Goffe, having
absented and withdrawn themselves, and fled, as we have been informed, to the
parts beyond the Seas, are now, as We certainly understand, lately returned
into Our Kingdom of England, and do privately lurk and obscure themselves in
places unknown; we therefore have thought fit, by, and with the Advice of Our
Privy Council, to publish the same to all Our loving Subjects, not doubting of
their Care and forwardness in their apprehension; And We do hereby Require and
Command, as well all and singular Our Judges, Justices of the Peace, Mayors,
Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Constables and Headboroughs, as also the Officers and
Ministers of our Ports, and other Our Subjects whatsoever, Within Our Realms of
England, Scotland, Ireland, or Dominion of Wales, and all other Our Dominions
and Territories, to be diligent in Inquiring, Searching for, Seizing and
Apprehending them, the said Edward Whalley, and William Goffe, in all places
whatsoever, as well within Liberties as without, whom if they shall happen to
Take and Apprehend, Our further Will and pleasure is, That they cause them and
either of them so Apprehended, to be safely carried to the next Justice of the
Peace, to the place where they or either of them shall be Arrested, whom We
straightly Command to Commit them and either of them to Prison, and presently
Inform Us or Our Privy Council of their or either of their Apprehensions.

And We do hereby further Declare and Publish, That if any Person or Persons
after this Our Proclamation published, shall Directly or Indirectly Conceal,
Harbor, Keep, Retain, or Maintain the said Edward Whalley and William Goffe, or
either of them, or shall Contrive or Connive at any means whereby they or
either of them shall or may Escape from being Taken or Arrested, or shall not
use their best Endeavor for their and either of their Apprehensions, as well by
giving due Advertisement thereof to Our Officers, as by all other good means;
We will (as there is Just Cause) proceed against them that shall so neglect
this Our Commandment with all severity.

And lastly We do hereby Declare, That whosoever shall discover the said Edward
Whalley or William Goffe, either within Our Kingdoms of England, Scotland,
Ireland, or Dominions of Wales, or in any other our Dominions and Territories,
or elsewhere, and shall cause them, or either of them, to be Apprehended, and
brought in alive or dead, if they or either of them, attempting Resistance,
happen to be slain, shall have a Reward of One hundred pounds in money for each
of them so brought in, dead or alive, as aforesaid, to be forthwith paid unto
him in recompense of such his Service.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Two and twentieth day of September, in the
Twelfth year of Our Reign.
