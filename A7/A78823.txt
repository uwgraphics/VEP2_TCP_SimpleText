A Copy of Colonel Rossiters Letter, who took the KINGS Packet.
SIR,
I Have sent (with these two Letters to the Speaker of the House of Commons,
and to the Committee of both Kingdoms) two intercepted Letters, going from
Newarke to Belvoyr, which I send enclosed: The last night a party of the Kings
horse broke into Linsey, but I hope that our party there are strong enough for
them; being Major GIBS Regiment, and Captain PEARTS Troup. The sickness is
certainly in Newarke, and the increase of company there is like to increase it.

Your Servant, EDW. ROSSITER.

Dear Sir:
I Am commanded by the Lord Gerhard, to send you this order from the King, and

amongst them, a most faithful servant, called

A Copy of a Letter from the King.
[ By His Majesty's own command, and subscribed Edward Waller.] To Sir Gervase
Lucas Governor of Belvoir.
CHARLES R.
Trusty and well beloved, We greet you well: Whereas We have for the present
thought fit to dispose our Horse in this [ Newark,] and all other Garrisons in
these parts, whereby they may be ready for any service, [ whether to lie still,
to march into Yorkshire, to break into the Association, or releeve Chester,
if the Irish come in time.] Our pleasure and command to you therefore is, that
you immediately provide in that your Garrison [ Belvoir] fit accommodation for
General Gerhards Horse, being about three hundred, besides your own; and that
you assist them in levying, and bringing in provisions for the supply, both of
horse and men, out of the several Towneships allotted for their provisions,
during their stay with you. Herein We expect you shall employ your best care
and diligence. And so We bid you farewell.

From our Court at Newark, October. 6. 1645.

Here we see (by the Kings own Letters) that he, and all the Council about
him, are so put to it, that they know not what to do. It seems the Kings
design is not then absolutely resolved on, and therefore the chiefest care
they take, is to quarter them where the may be ready for any service.

We may see what a sad condition the King has brought himself to, and that
especially in these five respects.

1 That he has but one Army left in the field, and dare not himself quarter
within two hundred miles of them, and yet they retreat before further West.

2 That all the associate Counties are utterly against his coming amongst them,
and will allow him no relief.

3 That the King should block himself up in a place where the Plague is, and
so many people there, (for Colonel Rossiters Letter says) the sickness is
certainly in Newarke.

4 That the Forces, Moneys, and Helps, which the King most builds upon, should
be from foreign Popish Kingdoms.

5 That yet he should be so hardened, that he will not comply with the
Parliament, to end the Wars.

You see here what the King commands in this Letter, fit accommodation for
three hundred Horse, besides their own, who are of themselves such a burden,
that the Country is undone by them, Assessements must be made for horse, and
man, when as they have not only assessed, but plundered and robbed the Country
most barbarously for their own maintenance. And now Gerhards men (who are many
of them Irish Rebels) must be further provided for also by them, the most
absolute theevish plunderers in the Kingdom, as it is well known in Wales,
where they have had the woeful experience of them, and yet Lucas is commanded
by the King to assist them.

My Lord:
I Received (together with your Lordships Letter) a double comfort, both the

21 53 65 26 43 60. For the present, I shall only inform your Lordship, and
humbly desire you to acquaint his Majesty with the condition of this place,
and the strong necessity there is of a speedy and powerful relief: I know it
is usual for men to recommend the safety of those places where their own
commands lie, as of highest concernment to his Majesty's service, but truly I
have wholly drawn my thoughts from any such partiality, and only consider this
place now as really it stands to His Majesty's affairs, both in this Kingdom
and Ireland, to this place, wherein it is inferior to (none other that I know,
drawing with it all Wales, Lanca-shire, with the North of England; and what
supplies His Majesty can expect, either out of Ireland or Scotland. The two
Princes when they had united their Forces and relieved Beeston castle and
Chester, were earnestly entreated by me to clear this Country, before they
departed out of those petty Garrisons that infected Chester, but other
considerations (at that time) hindered the effecting of it, and therefore with
a promise that the Army should continue in distance till Chester were furnished
with Victuals, and Ammunition, I was contented to return and undertake the
government of that Garrison, but the business of Hereford intervening, P.
Rupert was suddenly called away before either Ammunition or Victuals could be
brought into Chester, and (together with his Highness) marched away the
remainder of the old Irish Regiments, with some other Horse and Foot, the
number of at least a 200. so that I was left in the Town only with a Garrison
of the Citizens, and mine own, and Colonel Nastons Regiment, which both
together made not up above six hundred men, whereof the one half being Mastons
men, I was forced soon after to send out of Town, finding them by reason of
their Officers (who were but ignorant Welsh Gentlemen, and unwilling to undergo
any strict only) far more prejudicial then useful. The Rebels finding the
Prince retreated with his army, and the County emptied of all soldiers, but
such as was necessary for keeping the Garrisons, returned with all their Ports
to block up Chester on all sides, which ever since they have continued. The
Welsh (though they have men for member and Arms sufficient to beat the Rebels
out of Wales, yet) either they will not or dirt not stir, notwithstanding the
many orders I have sent them: The ^^^th is, so long as that cursed Commission
of Array, or (at least) such Commissioners as are put into it, have any power
there, the King must expect no good out of North Wales, and I am confident were
it not for the Castles which are well provided both with men, victuals, and
ammunition, that country had long since taken part with Brereton and
Middleton. Thus your Lord sees I am left in a condition neither to offend
others, nor to defend my self, pressed by a considerable Army of the Enemy, to
join with the Lanca shire Forces and Cheshire, This character deciphered is
thus: All is, if speedy relief come not: the want of powder will be sufficient
to blow me up, there being not full eighteen barrels in the store, nor any
public Magazine of victual, nor any money for public service.

the more fully related my condition to your Lordship, to the end that if any
misfortune should befall me before relief come, it may appear how little
accessarie I have been to it; and for those poor means I have left to
maintain this place, your Lordship may be assured I shall improve them to the
uttermost for his Majesty's service; and how unfortunate soever I may be, I
shall leave an account of my charge befitting an honest man, and one whom (I
hope) your Lordship shall not blush for to own for your Lordships most humble
and faithful Servant,

John Byran.
C. A. 1645.
Here you may see who bears the sway? popish Digby and his smiles are the best
comfort at Court; and that they may stand in his good opinion, a great honor,
Digby being (by the Queens means) the Kings right hand and you see how his
thoughts burden him, in which condition he has no comfort but what his hopes
are in Digby, a sad condition for England to have a company of Papists that
sway all with the King, and are not those exceeding blind buzzards that will
follow them up and down, like so many tantany piggs, to be fed like the old
London Apes: but mark the design: for that is the meanest thing to be looked
after.

1. Chester has been kept against the Parliament for the conveying of supplies
to his Majesty out of Ireland and Scotland. From Oneale and from Montrosse and
you so that he gave an account of some Irish that Rupert when he was at Chester
took out of that Garrison and says that which his highness marched away to
the remainder of the old Irish Regiments? the Irish rebels have come over
thither several times.

2. The Parliaments forces he calls Rebels; because they come against those
Irish; If they should prevail, all Protestants should be used by them no
better.

3. The protestants that are of the Kings Commission in Wales he would feign
have removed: that they may be all papists, and such as will comply with the
Irish rebels, and obey his orders in Joining with them against the Parliament.

October 9. 1645. DANIEL ONEALE.

This letter is from Colonel Daniel Oneale a Popish priest, and an Irish
rebel, who was protected in the Kings Army when he broke out of the tower, and
has since been a great agent for the King in Jreland, this General Oneale is
near alied in blood to Philome-Oneale, to the great Okconeale. and most of the
chief of the plotters that first raised the rebellion in Ireland, and he is
the only man made choice of the act for the King with the Marquis of Ormond, in
Jreland: and there is very secre tintercourse between Digby and this Daniel
Oneale, as you may see by their private carrestors, nay you may see that he is
a man highly esteemed on, for he tells Digby of miscarriages, and bids him have
a care hereafter whom he does trust.

But we may here see how their wheles have been going: and what they have
secretly plotted for the ruin of the protestants, and the Parliament, and the
Kingdom.

1. General Leshly and the Scots with him were largely offered if they would
come in to the King, but that would not prevale here. The like was here to
entise the Scots that were in Ireland, to persuade them to come over into
England, to join with the King against the protestants here, but that would not
prevail there neither, and when more Scots came over into Ireland they were
tried too, but still in vain.

2. Then the Marquis of Ormond he does what he can do, with the Irish Rebels,
to persuade them to send over some aid to the King, and he could not prevail
of himself, and therefore this Daniell Oneale he must help in the business,
and you see what account he gives of his prevailing. The words are thus. J have
got the most refractory part of the supreme council that were against the
Marquis, (that is those who hindered the going on of the treaty) and who are
they? they are the Clergy (he says) that is the priests, and Jesuits and
Friars, of Ireland for a party to conquer us here, whilst Oneale himself
subdues them that the protestants in Vister, with his Army there.

3. The Marquis, and the Irish Rebels had so plotted the business, that in the
first place a peace must be had with the Irish Rebels else it will be
prejuditiall to his Majesty.

4. In the next place the most eminent protestants in all Ireland they must be
strictly looked to, and secured for fear of acting any thing against the
Papists, Sir William Parsons Sir Adam Loftus, Sir John Temple, and Sir Robert
Meridith, although they had been persecuted before, and each of them bound in
ten thousand pound bonds a piece, not to depart the Kingdoms: and to be ready
when they shall be called for at ten days warning, yet that would not serve
their tu^ne^ they must be kept close prisoners, because (being true hearted
honest protestants,) their liberty does his Majesty much hurt; and he charge
the Duke of Richmond and Web his secretary to be the cause of it, though very
unlikely and he beseeches Digby that he will not let his Majesty be sold to
preserve any but the duchess of Richmond, and she must be palpably disposed
to, now you must understand that if it be for such as are disposed for the good
of the Catholic Religion, they care not how the King is bought, and sold for
such.

5. There is a great unity in the Church but we have not the key to unlock it,
but it is about hasting the Irish Rebels to the King, and trading with
foreign papists for Arms, and Ammunition,

6. All this while there is a correspondency between the Marquis of Ormond,
and the Queen; and she must strike the stroke in placeing the chief officers
in Ireland, as well as in England; and perticulerly the vize treasurers place
of Ireland, which is Sir Adam Loftus his right, though the Queen be resolved to
have him out because he is a protestant, and to put some Irish Papists in, in
his room, it seems Spencer looked for it, but Oncale here you see hopes to
get (...) from him, and therefore knowing well, that Digby will do his utmost
in the behalf of such an active Papist he tells him thus, I have some hopes now
(says he) that your Lordships intersession for me will not be as fruitless as
I immagined. And thus the papists are one for another all they can to have the
greatest places of trust and power in their hands, and have prevailed much in
it.

7. In the last place he tells Digby that if the King durst clear Cheshire, and
Lancashire before any thing else be done, then the Irish will be wholly
unservisable to him for England: And (the truth is) if we take Chester, as is
hoped the Irish will hardly land in Ingland for the future.

Now if we way these things well, we may see how blind malignants are, who will
not see what a snare the Papists have laid for us, and how much it concerns us
to rise all as one man to Join with the Parliament, and with our persons lives
estates, goods, and all we have, add and affect them till this popish party be
totally subdued.

There are other letters which the Lord Digby sent to the Lord Byron from the
King taken by Sir John Gell, which letters are to encourage him to hold out
Chester, that be shall be made field martial, Governor of Conway and
Commander in chief of all the forces in Wales, with directions what to do in
case that he be put to straites, much is written in Ciphers, and diverse
perticulars of great consequence are discovered therein.
