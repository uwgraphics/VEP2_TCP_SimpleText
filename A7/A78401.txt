A Letter from his Excellencies Quarters of a Discovery in Sir Thomas Fairfax
his Army, the Enemies thereof.
SIR,
RAgland Castle being so happily surrendered, this I believe will be the last
opportunity, that I shall have to present you with the Affairs of this
unconquered, and untained Army in relation to the Watts of this Kingdom, which
(through Gods Blessing) they have brought so near unto a period.

But to our Intelligence, On Wednesday last, Aug. 19. The Castle was
surrendered to his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax: The Enemy were no sooner
marched forth, but his Excellency entered the Castle, took a view of it, and had
some conference with the Marquess, and afterward went that night to Chepstow,
where he was liberally entertained by the Committee, and came from thence
yesterday to Bath.

The Castle of Ragland was as strong a Piece (as I have seen) encompassed with
a deep Moat, besides the River. There were in it near five hundied Officers,
Gentlemen and Soldiers (a List of the chief of which I have enclosed.) Diverse
of the Officers and Soldiers refused Passes, saying, That they could go any
where without Passes; so that many of them are not comprised in the List.
Twenty Pieces of Ordnance, not above three Barrels of Powder; but they had a
Mill with which they could make a Barrel a day, which would supply them
sufficiently. There was in it, great store of Corn and Malt in several Rooms;
the true quantity whereof, I cannot give yon, and therefore will not trouble you
with conjectures. There was also store of Wine of all sorts, and Beer; The
Horses they had leftwere inconsiderable, and those almost starved for want of
Hay, of which they had none, and not many Oats; so that the Horses eat their
halters for want of meat, and were tied with chains. Those that marched forth
had not the least incivility offered to them by our Soldiers, who (as formerly
during this War) were very punctual in observing the Articles. And now, let
all the Enemies of this Army (for It has many) produce any unworthy Action
offered by It, since his Excellencies first taking the field: Nay, let them
search Histories of precedent Ages, and produce an Army who have behaved
themselves with so much civility and fidelity as this has done: And I am
persuaded, thar although some being swollen with Envy and Malice seek to blast
Its reputation, and to cast a color over Its Actions; yet they shall appear
as so many ungrateful Cataliues, when the fame and glory of this Army shall be
precious and illustrious in the esteem of Posterity, as these who have freed
their Country from that Bondage and Slavery, which otherwise would have
inevitably fallen upon them. Then will the Parents tell their children the
memorable Stories of this Army, and the wonderful workings of God by this Arm
of Flesh, and how freely these their Noble Ancestors hazarded themselves for
their Countries Peace and Freedom. But I have held you too long with these
undigested Notions, And therefore crave leave to break off, and subscribe my
self

Bath, August 21. 1646. Your real Friend, and Servant, VV. C.
I had before forgotten to acquaint you with the great store of Goods and rich
Furniture, which we found in Ragland Castle, which the General ordered, that
faithful and discreet Gentleman Mr. Herbert, Commissioner of the Army, Mr.
Roger Williams, and Major Teulidale, to Inventrize, and in case any of the
well-affected of the Country could lay just claim to any of them, either as
plundered from them, or were forced to bring them in thither, they should be
restored unto them: Also Capt. Robert Blethen is appointed Governor.
