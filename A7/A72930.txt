A Wench for a VVeauer.
A Wench for a Weauer here you shall find,
In defending his trade brought her to his mind.
To the tune of hang up my Shuttle


The Weauer. IT chanced on a day,
as I was walking,
In the pleasant Month of May,
with my Love talking:
Most friendly arm in arm,
the weather being warm,
I swar^ I thought no harm,
as I am a weauer.
The substance of my speech.
as we were going,
Was I did this maid beseech,
my request in wooing
Grant me thy love quoth he,
or one sweet smile from thee,
Say walking unto me,
thou honny weauer.

The Maid. The Maiden then replide,
sure you are but jesting,
You needs must be denide,
of your requesting.
Without you can declare
your wits then do not spare,
How I Will live out of care,
you being a weauer.
For the common speech is rife,
that I Will implore
To be a Weauers wife
is to live poor.
Then clear but you this case,
why a Weauer is counted base,
Then you I will embrace,
none like a weauer.

The Weauer. My own true love and dear,
since we came hither,
These slanderous words I Will clear,
lets go together.
If the Bark from the Tree you pill,
the root you needs must kill,
So through husbands that are ill,
disgract are weauers.
Yet there are more as well as we,
that have disgraces,
As you may plainly see
in diverse places.
For the richest of you all,
if your means begin to fall,
Then your trades worse then all,
as well as weauers.

The Maid. Then I see it is poverty
that breeds thy slander:
Yet I have heard of thee
thou have been Commander.
Tho gone now are those days,
and other bears the swayes,
Yet thou have had the praise
none like a weauer.
Seeing thou have resolved me
of what I asked:
All the world plain man see
you are vainly taxed.
Yet show me the ground of all,
and how you first did fall.
That I may speak of all,
in praise of weauers.

The second part.
To the same tune.


The Weauer. MY Love at thy request,
thou shall command me:
For why I love thee best,
then understand me.
Fortune sometimes frowns,
he raises and pulls down
As well Cities as Towns,
then why not weauers.
Canning Street you know,
where cloth is selling:
Weauers have made like show
in their houses dwelling.
Tho they be gone and dead,
and Drapers crept in stead,
Yet I heard and read,
there dwelt brave weauers.
Jack of Nuberie,
tho he be dead and rotten,
Of Weauers famde was he,
he should not be forgotten.
Two hundred and fifty loomes
to maintain he presumes,
That he noreth now the tombs
of worthy weauers.
Cheapside amongst the rest
shall not be forgotten,
There are some that make jests,
to see them broken.
It is silke-men that do break,
they cannot hold they are so weak,
And more would go to rack,
were it not for weauers.
Be not so proud in heart,
although you flourish,
Give Weauers due desert,
for we do them nourish.
A Weauer they cannot want,
if they should their heart would pan^
And they would feel more want:
then love a weauer.
To write more then is my share
I should be sorry:
The truth I will not spare,
I have read a story
Of a Weauer that was a King,
whose same through the world did ring,
Which makes me merrily sing
speak well of weauers.
In those Golden days,
weauers had pleasure:
None like them then had praise,
they gained much treasure.
Weauing did so excel,
none like them did so well:
Of all trades they bare the bell,
speak well of weauers.
If any offended be
at this my writing,
That no eloquence he see
in my inditing:
Pardon me for this time,
though simply now I rhyme,
For here I mean to clime
in praise of weauers.
Thus here I end my song,
and eke my story,
I hope I have done no wrong,
if I have I am sorry.
Then how say thou my love,
my constant heart then prove:
From thee I Will never move.
then love a Weauer.

Tho: Neale.
