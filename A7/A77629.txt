Advertisement to Booksellers.
WHereas The Four Oxford Cullies, having run Themselves and Porter out of
breath, and finding that their illshap'd Testaments, etc. will not answer their
expectation, they have lately among other things Pirated a certain Book called
Elegantiae Poeticae, and offered it to Sale for 1 s. 4 d. in Quires:

THis is to give notice, That of the true Proprietors of the Copy, the said
Book may be had at 12 d. a single Book in Quires, of a more perfect Edition,
having three Sheets more of Matter than the Oxford Print.

Brought down to Oxford by a London bookseller, and dispersed there in
Stationers shops about 10. March 1679/80.
