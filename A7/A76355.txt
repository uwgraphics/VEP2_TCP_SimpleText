THE BELGIC BOOR.
A New SONG, to the Old Tune of Chevy Chase.
GOd Prosper long our Noble King,
Our Hopes and Wishes all;
A fatal Landing late there did
In Devonshire befall.
To drive our Monarch from his Throne,
Prince Naso took his way;
The Babe may rue that is newly born,
The Landing at Torbay.
The stubborn Tarquin void of Grace,
A Vow to Hell does make,
To force his Father Abdicate,
And then his Crown to take.
And eke the Royal Infant-Prince
To seize or drive away;
These Tidings to our Sovereign came,
In Whitehall where he lay.
Who unconcerned at the Report,
At first would not believe,
That any of his Royal Race
Such Mischiefs could conceive.
Till Time which ripens all Things, did
The Villainy disclose;
And of a Nephew and a Son
Forged out the worst of Foes.
Who by Infernal Instinct led,
A Mighty Fleet prepares,
His Father's Kingdoms to Invade,
And fill his Heart with Cares.
Our Gracious King desires to know
What his Pretensions were,
And how without his leave he durst
Presume on Landing here.
Declaring what was deemed amiss
Should soon amended be,
And whatso'er should be desired,
He would thereto agree.
And for a speedy Parliament
He does forthwith declare:
The surly Brute not minding this
Does to our Coast repair.
With several Thousand Belgic Boors,
All chosen Rogues for spite,
Joined with some Rebels who from hence
And Justice had taken flight.
Who armed with Malice and with Hopes,
Soon threw themselves on Shore;
Crying our Religion and our Laws
They came for to restore.
Then Declarations flew about
As thick as any Hail,
Which (tho no Word was e're made good)
Did mightily prevail.
We must be Papists or be Slaves
Was then the General Cry;
But we'll do any thing to save
Our Darling Liberty.
We'll all join with a Foreign Prince,
Against our Lawful King;
For he from all our fancied Fears
Deliverance does bring.
And if what he declares prove true,
As who knows but it may;
Were he the Devil of a Prince
We'll rather him obey.
Then our Allegiance let us cast off,
James shall no longer guide us;
And tho the French would bridle us,
None but the Dutch shall ride us.
And those who will not join with us
In this Design so Brave,
Their Houses we'll pull down or burn,
And seize on what they have.
These growing Evils to prevent,
Our King his Force does bend;
But amongst those he most did trust
He scarce had left one Friend.
O how my very Heart does bleed,
To think how basely they
Who long had eaten Royal Bread,
Their Master did betray.
And those to whom he would been most kind,
And greatest Favors shown,
Appeared to be the very first
Who sought him to Dethrone.
O Compton! Langston! and the rest
Who basely from him ran;
Your Names for ever be accursed
By every English man.
Proud Tarquin he pursues his Game,
And quickly makes it plain,
He came not to redress our Wrongs,
But England's Crown to gain.
And over his Father's mangled Fame,
His Chariot proudly drives,
Whilst he good Man, although in vain,
To pacify him strives.
But he Ungrateful! would not hear
His Offers tho so kind,
But caused the Noble Messenger
Forthwith to be confined.
He brings his nasty Croaking Crew
Unto his Father's Gate,
Dismissed his own, makes them his Guard,
O dismal Turn of Fate!
Also at Midnight drives him thence,
O horrid Impious thing!
Were such Affronts e're offered to
A Father and a King.
A King so Great! so Good! so Just!
So Merciful to all!
His Virtue was his only Fault,
And that which caused his Fall.
Who now is forced his Life to save
To fly his native Land,
And leave his Scepter to be grasped
By an ungracious Hand.
Hells Journey-men are straight convened,
Who rob God of his Power,
Set up themselves a Stork-like King,
The Subjects to devour.
And to secure his Lawless Throne,
Now give him all we have,
And make each Freeborn English Heart
Become a Belgic Slave.
The Bar, the Pulpit, and the Press
Infatuously combine,
To cry up a Usurped Power,
And stamp it Right Divine.
Our Loyalty we must melt down
And have it coined anew,
For what was current heretofore,
Will now no longer do.
Our Fetters we our Selves put on,
Our Selves, our Selves do bubble;
Our Conscience a mere Pack-horse make,
Which now must carry double.
O England! when to future Times
Thy Story shall be known,
How will they blush to think what Crimes
Their Ancestors have done.
But after all, what have we got
By this our dear-bought King?
Why! that our Scandal and Reproach
Throughout the World does ring.
That our Religion, Liberties,
And Laws we held so dear,
Are more Invaded since this Change
Than ever yet they were.
Our Coffers drained, our Coin impaired,
That little that remains;
Our Persons seized, nay Thoughts arraigned,
Our Freedom now is Chains.
Our Traffic ruined, Shipping lost,
Our Traders most undone;
Our bravest Hero's sacrificed,
Our ancient Glory gone.
A Fatal Costly War entailed,
On this unhappy Isle;
Unless above what we deserve,
Kind Heaven at last does smile.
And bring our Injured Monarch Home,
And Place Him on his Throne;
And to Confusion bring his Foes
Which God grant may be soon.
