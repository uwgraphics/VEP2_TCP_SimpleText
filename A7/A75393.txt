Another Relation of a miraculous Victory obtained by the Lord Fairfax against
the Earl of Newcastle.
BY those that came out of Yorkshire it was this day informed that about
Tuesday last the Lord Fairfax obtained a great victory against the Earl of
Newcastle in a place called Barnham-Moore about twelve miles on this side
York, in which place the Lord Fairfax slew (as is informed by those which say
they were eyewitnesses) at least fifteen hundred of the Earl of Newcastles men,
and took one thousand prisoners, with great store of arms and ammunition, and
put the rest to flight, and was in pursuance of them when the party that
brought this relation came from thence, and it is thought the Lord Fairfax will
become Master of the field, and that it will be a good means to settle the
peace of that County: for after the late victory obtained by the Lord Fairfax
against the Earl of Newcastle near Wakefield, the said Earl came against Leeds
to besiege the Lord Fairfax with a great part of the forces which he had at
York, the Lord Fairfax maintained not only the quarters which he had before, as
Leeds, Halifax, and other places in those parts, but forced the enemy to
retreat, and enlarged his quarters, by which means he met the enemy in the
field, which the Malignants boasted he durst not do, and so it pleased God to
give unto him this victory also, which as though J doubt not but will be
ratified by ensuing relations, yet for the present, because J am the first that
have written of this matter, and unwilling to write the least untruth, whereby
the Kingdom might be misinformed, J shall omit many particulars touching the
said fight at Barnham, yet it is reported that the Lord Fairfax took at least
2000. arms, and six pieces of Ordnance, and many of the prisoners taken are
persons of good quality, as Colonels, Captains, and at least forty Colors,
besides many other Officers.

This victory has so dishartned the rest of the Popish army about York, that
some of the Frenchmen and others which the Queen brought over with her, do wish
themselves again in their own Country: and it is informed, that Sir William
Fairfax is with a considerable number of men marched toward York, in which
voyage there is no doubt (through Gods mercy) but he will find good success;
for except the County of Lancaster, we have not the like experience of Gods
goodness to the poor Protestants of England as in this County, for as in
Lancashire, so in Yorkshire there was great store of Papists, and malevolents,
and certainly if the Kings army could have gained love in any place, it would
have been in this county, which was the place where the army first gathered
together against the Parliament, and yet at that time before any act of
hostillity against them, and the design was carried with as much secrecy and
subtilty as possible could be, under a color of defending the Parliament, and
liberty of the subject, it pleased God to give the greatest part of this county
such a discerning spirit that notwithstanding all the fair shows and
pretenses were made to color those wicked designs which were at that time
intended against the Parliament and whole kingdom, which have since been
brought to the birth in the city of London, though God in mercy hitherto
infatuated their Counsels, so that they have been brought forth according
(...) their desires, yet this County even at that time, which was before either
the murdering of his Majesty's good subjects, plundering and robbing them of
their goods, burning their dwelling houses, Corn hay, etc. all which is
apparently known to have been put in practice in many Counties of this
kingdom, by those that heretofore pretended they took up arms for the honor
and safety of his Majesty's person, the rights and privilledges of Parliament,
and the liberty of the subjects, all which pretenses they have violated and
broken, and not only by the practices before mentioned, but by sundry plots and
secret conspiracyes (as is most apparent to the whole kingdom) have endeavored
the ruin and destruction of the Kings Royal Majesty, the very essence and
being of the Parliament, the destruction of the state and kingdom, and to
bring his Majesty's good subjects into utter bondage and slavery yet (as I said
before) the County of York before any of those things were put in practice did
for the most part declare that they would not take up arms against the
Parliament, and have ever since showed themselves very constant and resolute
for the cause, and if all other Countyes would (now his Excellency is advanced
toward Oxford) rise and join themselves into body for the aiding of his
Excellency in that design, a sudden period would be put to the present
distractions, but if men will strive to make the breach greater between the
King and his Parliament, or stand as Neuters, they will be a means to bring
ruin and destruction upon themselves and the whole kingdom.

FINIS.
