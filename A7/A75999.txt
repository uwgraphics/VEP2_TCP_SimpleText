Alas pore Parliament, how are thou betrayed? This is the Plot the Kings party
boasted of, that should take whether God would or no: You see though they care
not what they speak,: yet they know what they speak. We have brave Generals
that fight for the King, and make pore honest people pay for their own
destructions: One of them has wrought finely in the dark a l^^^^^ while like
a Devil, but the other has showed himse^^e an open enemy, and therefore is
the more to be borne with; he has made use of Rouges, Cutpurses, Players,
(...) and Tinkers to forward a Reformation, and the other has culd out all the
honestest Youth in the Kingdom to keep them from Action, or for slaughter.
Neither of them work, but make work; when they should do, they undo, and
indeed to undo is all the mark they aim at. Do ye think Greatness
without Goodness can ever thrive in excellent actions? no, Honor without
honesty stinkes: away with it: no more Lords and ye love me, they smell of the
Court.
