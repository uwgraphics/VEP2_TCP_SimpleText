A brief DESCRIPTION Of the two revolted NATIONS HOLLAND and ENGLAND.

Against their true and lawful Kings, Laws, and Statutes, to the dishonor of
GOD, and the loss of their own Souls forever.

Who are now in open Rebellion, oppressing their Fellow-Subiects by Excises,
Taxes, Assessements, and Extortion; exceeding all Turks, Jews, Heathens,
Infidells, Pagons, Traitors, and Rebels.

A brief DESCRIPTION Of the two usurped STATES, ENGLAND and HOLLAND.
THe Condition to the Hollander is churish, as their Breeder Neptune, and
without doubt very ancient, for they were bred before Manors were in fashion,
yet what they have not they do account superfinitie, which they fay mendeth
some, and marreth others: they should make good Justices, for they respect
neither Person nor Apparel, a Boar in his liquid sloppe shall have a^ much
respect and good usage, as a Gentlman in all his Braverie, for he that is
Courtly or Gentile, it amongst them like a Merline after Michaelmas amongst the
Crows; they wonder at and envy, but worship no such Images, marry with a
silver Hook you may take these Gudgeons presently; the love of Money being as
natural to them as Water to a Goose, or Carren to a Crow; but our English
State Cormorants go beyond them in cursed coveting of men's Estates, for they
devide the wealth of the whole Kingdom into three parts, and they have gotten
two parts to themselves, the Crown and the Church Lands, and of the third
part, what in Excise, Composition Money, and other Taxes, they have two parts
of that, so they have left the whole Kingdom but a third of a third part to
live on; and yet they are not satisfied but cry like Hell and the Grave, cry
more. The Dutch are generally boreish, yet none but may be bred to a
Statesman; so out English Saints at Westminster, do intend to follow them, for
as much as in them lies, they go about to beggar and banish the Gentry, that
Dick and Tom, Will and Iock, Ralph and Harry, may be all in all. They have one
gift, not to be nice conscientious, and so are our States, and can as well as
they turn out Religion to let in Policy; their Country is their God they
worship; so England is the Idol of our States; War is their Heaven, so
spilling of blood is ours; Custom is their Law, and the sword it ours. They are
seldom deceived, for they trust none, and so by consequence are better able to
keep a Fort then wit it; yet they can do both as well as we: they shall abuse
a Stranger for nothing, and we one another as little; nothing can quiet them
but Money and Liberty, and (then like us) when they have them both, they abuse
them; but if you tell them or us so, you awak our fury, and you may sooner calm
the Sea, then convince that into a compass again; They are like us, they love
none but those that do for them, and when those leave off, they neglect them;
all that help them not they hold Popish, and take it for an Argument of much
honesty to rail bitterly against the King of Spain: so our westminster
masters account every one Malignant that does not adhere to their Faction, and
not only villifie our late K* they murdered, but also rail against his Son
our King, that is or ought to be. But certainly, this is the badge of an ill
Nature, that when they have once cast off the yoke of Obedience to be
most-violent against those to whom of right they owe all respect and service;
grateful dispositions (though by their Lords they be exempted from service)
will yet be paying reverance and affection: I am confident, had not the Dutch
been once the Subject of Spain, they would have loved that Nation better then
any other; and it is a sufficient ground to continue their eternal hate, to
know the world remembers, that they were once the lawful Subjects to the
Catholic King: so there is nothing vexes and angers our Westminster Rebels,
then that the World takes notice of their Rebellion against their lawful King
of blessed memory, and that his Son lives to scourge them for it. Their
Shipping is their Babell which they boast on, for the glory of their Nation:
it is indeed a wonder, and they will have it so, but we may hope, they will
never be so mighty by Land, least they show us how doggedly they can tyrannize
where they get the Victory, witness at Amboyna and Leyden; it is their own
Chronicle buisines that tells you, that at the siege of Leydons a Fort being
held by the Spaniard, was after by the Dutch taken by assault; where one of the
Dutch in the fury of the slaughter, ripped up the Captains Body, and with a
barbarous hand, toare out the yet living heart (panting among the reeking
Bowels) and then with his Teeth rent it (still warm with blood) into gobets,
flung it over the battlements indefience of the rest of the Army. Yet our
barbarous Blood-suckers of England, have our gone them in cruelties, witness
the butchering and unhumane useing of that ever to be praised noble Lord, my
Lord of Northampton at Hopton-Heath: the barbarous massacring in cold blood of
Col. Stanhope in Shelford Garrison, and Sir Ch^rls Lucas, and Sir Geo: Lisle at
Colchester, cum multis aljis, O bloody Tigers! the Scithian Bear could not
have been more savage. To be necessitated unto cruelty, is a detraction to be
strongly tempted to it; but to spleen, rage, and mad it self in cold blood
upon a resistles enemy, shows nature slept in the liquid gall of Passion, and
beyond all brutishness, and displayes the unnoble tyranny of a prevailing
Coward.

Their Navies are the whip of Spain, where with they pull away his Indyes,
Nature has not bred them so active for the Land as we, but at the Sea, they
are Water-Devills, to attempt things incredible. A Turkish Man of War is as
dreadful to them, as a Falcon to a Mallerd; from whom their best remedy is,
run away; for if they come to blows, they want the valiant stoutnesse of the
English, who will rather expire bravely, then in a cold resistance, yield to
the lasting slavery of becoming Captives to so barbarous a Conqueror.

Their Government is Anarchy, and there had need he many to rule such a rabble
of rude ones, they began that diabollicall Anarchicall Government, and we have
followed them, and being good Professors have out-gone them in their Art; for
they only threw off the Yoke of Obedience in crossing the Designs of their
King, in bringing in that cruel unjust Court of Inquesition: but we by a more
cruel, unjust, and unheard of Court, have crucified our K. Their taking up
Arms, was to preserve the lives of their Nobility, whose deaths they supposed
was intended by the Duke de Alua: but we have taken up Arms to destroy our
Nobility out of the Land; they only banished their King, and abolished His
Royal Power out of some part of His Dominions, but we have most barbarously
Butchered our King at his own Gate; and banished his Son and Heir, our King
that ought to be, out of all his Dominions. Tell them of a King in jest, and
they could out your Throat in earnest: but our Westminster Saints have another
way (for those that tell them of a King) which is to hang them by a LAW of
their own making; the name of a King being as hateful to us both, as Images
to a Jew, old age to a Woman, or a Surplugs to a Noncenfermist: None amongst
them have Authority by Inheritance; that was to percell out their Country into
Families; but they are chosen (as our King did use to prick Shreiffes for their
Countries) not for their fullness of Wit, but for their Wealth they have to
bear it out with, which they so ever affected, that they will walk the
streets (like out Usurers, when they go to a Baudy-house) all alone
melancholy, and if they may be had cheap, shall daube his faced Cloak with
two penny worth of Pickled Herrings, which himself shall carry home in a
string. Their Justice is strickt if it cross not policy; but (like our
Grandees) rathes then hinder Trastick, tolerate any thing; there is not under
Heaven such a Den of several Serpents as Amsterdam is, nor in all Europe such
a Nest of Saint-Devills as in London. you may be in either of these what Devil
you please, so you push not the States with your Horns; they are each of them
an Universitie of Opinions, which grows here confusedly (like as in a
Nurserie) without order or prunning: If you be unsettled in your Religion, you
may try all, and take at last what you like best, as the Camolion changes into
all colors but white, so they admit of all Religions but the true; yet the
Papist only may not excercisi^ his Religion in public amongst the Dutch, yet
they plead this not for hatred of it, but Justice; because the Spaniard will
not tolerate the Protestant, and they had rather show a little spleen, then
not cry quit with the Enemy. Their Excise is their Exchequer, which they so
strictly observe and gather, that you cannot eat a Sallet without paying six
several Excises for it, yet one good Commodity they have by it (that without
Taxing or Pouling of them) it pays all the Souldrey both by Sea and Land, and
defrayes all other Charges of their Commonwealth both at home and abroad; but
we English are not so happy, for though our Excise will treble theires, and
their Expenses treble ours, yet our blessed States makes us pay Tax upon Tax,
and like cruel Egyptian Taskmasters, makes us make Brick without Straw; but
the reason is, (I give it you in their owns Language) they say, it is sit that
every one of this pious lunch, (I mean the Parliament) should have a hundred
thousand pounds in ready Money by them, that if the King do unstate them
(which I trust in God he will do shortly) they may escape away to the Land of
Promise beyond Sea, if Prince Rupert catch them not by the way and Hoyle them
against their wills: In their Families they are all equals, and you have no
way to know the Master and Mistress, but by taking of them in Bed together, it
may be they be they; otherwise Malkin can prate as much, laugh as loud, be as
bold, and fit as well as her Mistress; Father and Son are there undividialls,
for no demonstration of duty or authority can distinguish them, as if they
were created together and not borne successively; and for the Mother, the
Daughter bedding her goodnight, and kissing her, ^s punctual blessing; your
Man shall be saucie, and you must not strike him, if you do, he shall
complain to the School, and have recompense, so in England, they are taking a
ready way to bring in a Parity, Like to like says the Devil to the Collier,
and Joane is as goody as my Lady: and for Children, they asking their Parents,
do you see me? and they answering, yes, I do see you, and will remember you,
is punctual Blessing. Marriage is honorable among them (but as it is now with
us) Sans Ceremony their Opinion is, that Marniage was ordained only for
procreation of Children, and that none ought to marry but those that are
fruitful, which makes them give such Liberty to their Children, that many time
they go to be married with a Child in their hand, which their Husbands never
knew the getting of, and yet it is held no dishonor for her Husband; for then
he may be confident she is not barren, and their marriage is lawful:
Bawdy-Houses are as frequent as Taverns are with us, and hang up Bushes as well
as they, to let the people that pass by, know what Occupation they are of; to
conclude, there is one thing among them very comendable, (which to our shame in
England we have not) that is, though they have many poor yet they have few or
no Beggars, for they provide for them, be setting those at work that are able,
and maintaining them that are not, in convenient places.

FINIS.
