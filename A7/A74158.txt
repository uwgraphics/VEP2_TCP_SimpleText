blazon of the Commonwealth
Thursday the Tenth of September, 1657.
HIs Highness the Lord Protector and His Privy Council, being very sensible of
the Hand of the Lord, which for some Months past has layen sore upon this
Land, in the present Visitation by Sickness throughout the Nation, which calls
upon all men to Repent and turn from their evil Ways, and in a Solemn manner to
Humble themselves before the Lord, and to seek his Face and Favor, His Highness
and the Council have thought fit to Invite and Stir up all that fear the Lord
in this Nation to the said Duty of Solemn Fasting and Humiliation; and for that
end have appointed Wednesday the Thirtieth day of this instant September, to be
observed in all places within England, Wales, and the Town of Berwick upon
Tweed; not doubting but all who have a due sense of the Tokens of Gods
Displeasure, will be excited to the performance of this necessary Duty, in such
a manner as is suitable to the present Dispensation, and may not become a
further Provocation.

Hen: Scobell, Clerk of the Council.
