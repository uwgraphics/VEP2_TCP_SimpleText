The Muses congratulatory Address to his Excellency the Lord General MONCK.
AWake ye sacred Quire the night is past,
Auroras Mantl's spread, have, have
Your early ioys to this Triumphant fate,
Of the great Rescuer our Albian Advocate
At heavens just bar, whence he received command,
TO advance to the stiffned Pharo'hs of the land.
The peoples suffrages in's hands he brought,
It Is Moses they cried by whom we are taught
The way from Egypts task's, thus heavenly armed,
H' approacht their Courts, it is Monck, who soon alarmed
Their fatted souls, the Locusts and Flies says he.
The giddy factions that spread the Isle may be
Good tests of heavens dislike, your troops of oaths,
Are mustered all against you, yet here is those,
Would feign raise more, such Saints in armor they
Would beat God with his own weapons, and would pray
Him from his throne. Having now corrected
These hard Taskmasters, he soon directed
To the wearied People, his Message was ease,
In the room of civil war to bring them peace,
Th'unlimited bounds of joy at this great change,
Had soon arrived the Senate, the events were strange,
And dreadful there, hard hearts would not relent,
But straight two forc'rers with their Tackle were sent,
To countermiss this truth, to possess the world,
These were but knacks in State, we must be whirld,
With various streams, but straight were their charms,
By all rejected, never the Churches arms
More cheerfully embraced her fathers, then the people him,
Who brought their news of freedom which had been
So long an exile, nor did this prophet fail,
In his Embasage, for soon the black veil
Of horrid Tyrarany's withdrawn, the chains gone,
The prison doors stand open; the Jesuits run
To Rome again, and shiftless here have left
Their new raised force, Infant Schisms bereft
Of Parents, whose errors be confuted,
Enough with silence, never points were thus disputed,
Yet reason it is, no argument needs the Sun,
TO disperse contracted vapors, appear, it is done,
The Pulpits and the Press of late have been
Filled with learned arguments against their sin,
But all in vain, Divine and savory reason
That taught obedience, was soon made treason,
By the law of arms; The Counsels and Synodds all
Of former Churches gave rules to call,
Such heritiques to answer but we broke,
Our Fathers rules, we gave the fatal stroke,
To pious order, our zeal was sacriledg,
In State, our tenures all turned villanage,
These Tories of the Church he quickly tames,
Swarmed legions of furies he soon reclaim's
His holy soul abhorred to hearken to,
Phanatique dreams, he chaste the dreamers too,
Nor is this heart without attendants fit.
His valiant hand, and prudent head may sit,
In the chair of presidents, records must be
Great George bigbelly'd with thy history,
How innocently subtle have thou wrought.
Thy just atcheivments, wisely have thou caught
Our Isreal's foes, insnares and chaind them fast,
From preying on their brethren, thou do cast,
Their darts in their own breasts, thus by thy hand
Our twenty years red sea, is now dry Land.
The Royal and the Noble blood was spilt,
A sacrifice for sin, yet O their Guilt.
Restless it was until inferior veins.
Had given attendance in their Masters trains,
Our hands besmeared with blood our hearts all filld;
With mortal Feud; our word, Kill or be killd.
Thus foundst thou us; readier to devour
Then spare, Alas we would lost all legal power,
Lo Moses in the Gap here timely stood,
Three Nations conquered, without stain of blood,
This great Physician stopped our bloody stream,
And no vein pricked, has subtly culled the Gem,
And not defaced the shell, his valiant hand
Still was of the Lifeguard to his hearts command,
The Danish and the Norman conquests were
Founded in blood, great Princes to their Chair
Have stepped on slaughtered Subjects, but records
Yield not thy equal, yet no bloody swords
Were ere taken from such valiant cruel hands
But rivers of blood fell: The world amazed stands
At thy great acts which yet receive this Crown,
It Is in the Kingdoms right not in thy own:
Go on great Statesman get eternal praise,
Thy hand, the sword; thy head shall wear the Bays.
Could thy just soul dispense with others right,
All Nations sure would covet thee, how light
Thy Scepter would be thought; Here Is bound in thee
Volum's of Government, in Epitomee
Treasured all earthly thrones, what more's in art
Thy head's the Senate House, thou Senate art
Now in thy journey by the Angel led
We leave thee with thy Israelites; they are fled
By divine hand in this great straight of time;
And if they murmr, think, it is the old crime
Bright Moses saw, to Canaan must they go
Their Fathers rights and freedoms must enjoy.
Great Deliverer speed on thy numerous fame
Vast Pyramids support the Ensigns of thy name,
Have through the Desert and yet timely stay
At Sina's Mount, and there thy tribute pay
To Heavens great seat; All finished, thou will find
Heroic soul, thou have pleased thy Makers mind,
And pregnant fame in all age shall shall be proud
To aggravate thy Name, no sullen cloud
Dare to eclipse it, unless't suspected be
Apostate England near kept such Loyalty.
