HIS MAJESTY'S FAREVVEL SPEECH Unto the Lords Commissioners at Newport in the
Isle of Wight.
MY LORDS,
You are come to take your leave of me, and I believe we shall scarce ever see
each other again: but Gods will be done, I thank God, I have made my peace
with him, and shall without fear, undergo what he shall be pleased to suffer
men to do unto me.

My Lords, you cannot but know, that in my fall and ruin, you see your own,
and that also near to you; I pray God send you better friends then I have
found.

I am fully informed of the whole carriage of the plot against me and mine; and
nothing so much afflicts me, as the sense and feeling I have of the sufferings
of my Subjects, and the miseries that hang over my three Kingdoms, drawn upon
them by those who (upon pretenses of good) violently pursue their own
interests and ends.

These words His Majesty delivered with much alacrity, and cheerfulness, with
a serene Countenance, and a carriage free from all disturbance.

Thus parting with the Lords, leaving many tender Impressions, (if not in them)
in the other hearers.
